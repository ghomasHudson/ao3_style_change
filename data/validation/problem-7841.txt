So why would I be any different
He glances between the Betas, and Clint breaks the mould as well, by just staring at Tony, waiting for an answer, instead of trying to shush his mate for his rudeness.
"I don't know him very well," she says. "Not as well as you. Do you think he'd mind?"
"You don't get to pick?" Clint says around the wad of chewed up pastry in his mouth.
Tony squirms, limbs loose and uncoordinated. Steve is, quite suddenly, reminded of how hard and insistent his own cock is. Tony is gorgeous like this, messy with his own come and sweat and slick.
"So," he says, after a moment. "I'm in heat."
"Fuck," Tony gasps, thrusting down hard and taking Steve deeper. His hole flutters and clenches around Steve, and he feels himself already growing close. "Later, you can mount me later, Steve, I'm not going to—"
," Tony snaps, and Rhodey chuckles to himself as he leaves the room to, presumably, check on the status of their trunks.
"He likes engineering," Steve said, his voice small but proud. "I wanted him to have something he likes."
Tony can't help the shiver, the way his eyelashes flutter as though his eyes want to roll back into his head – again. God, he'd come so many times in the last three days he's not actually certain how it is that he's able to walk right now. Plus Steve's amazing, ridiculous, huge-but-not-terrifying-at-all-after-the-first-time-anyway cock had felt so good inside him, had made him feel things he hadn't known he could feel. God, it had been the most amazing heat, the most amazing sex on the planet.
Tony's whole body tenses, but he doesn't ask any questions. He knows what's coming.
Tony finishes his intense orgasm, whole body going slack against the bed. His face is turned to the side, and Steve watches his eyelashes flutter, watches the blooms of colour on Tony's cheeks soften as his breathing slowly returns to normal.
Steve reaches down and tests the water with a hand, pours more of the boiling water in. Another test with his hand, then he takes the basin and hangs it back over the fire.
? To want you this much?"
"But now I live here," she says, sweeping an arm up to gesture around the room, to indicate America. "Steve is very kind to me."
It would have been better if Howard had disowned him, probably.
"You were beautiful," Steve tells him, pressing a kiss to the top of Tony's head. "More beautiful than I imagined."
"They're specially trained," Steve says, glaring at Bucky. "For political diplomacy and – stuff."
"Right, but he's still an Alpha," he says, watching as Pepper packs up a small bag to take with them. Perfumes and creams and candles. There's more in his chambers – a whole trunk of toiletries designed to help him be as attractive and demure as possible.
"Yes," he says. "Yeah, I definitely could."
Tony swallows hard, eyes suddenly hot. It's got to be his heat coming on. "Of course not, you hardly know me."
She stares at him, pursing her lips. "I said something," she says.
"But I have it now," Steve soldiers on. "I'm just… I'm just trying to say that I'm not… I know what you – what you learned. What your lessons were in. I know you were sent here like some kind of, I don't know, property. And I want you to know that I don't… think of it like that. I don't
"Gorgeous," Tony murmurs, throat hoarse from the size of Steve's cock.
They walk through the halls quietly and make their way out to the grounds, headed for the enchanted garden. The snow on the cobbled streets has started to melt, leaving puddles in its wake. They walk with distance between them, and at one point Tony walks around a puddle while Steve walks around the other side of it entirely.
a surprise about the whole thing is that Tony is in the bed by himself, wrapped up in a cocoon of comfortable blankets. His skin feels tacky with dried sweat and slick and semen, but it also feels blessedly cool.
They don't talk much about her past, but Steve knows she feels a kinship with Tony. She'd grown up in Krasni, and Steve thinks she'd been slated for the same kind of fate as Tony had been, as an Omega Consort, before she'd defected and moved to Starkland, fighting beside Steve in the war. He doesn't think it had been as coveted a position in Krasni, though.
"I know, I wish it could be any other way," Steve says, arms tightening around Tony's body. "I wanted to – it doesn't matter. It'll only be for a couple of weeks."
"I won't hurt you," Steve reminds him. "I won't do anything until you're ready for me."
Steve makes his way out to the aviary, fairly certain Sam will be out there tending to the hawks and the ravens. He's not disappointed.
Steve smiles, and takes a deep breath. He lets Tony's scent wash over him, the heat of his body against his warming him from the inside. He puts a tiny bit of pressure on Tony's jaw, nudging his face to turn, and Tony does, tilting his face and turning his torso and pressing his lips against Steve's.
"Thanks, Natasha," Steve tells her as she goes. "You're always here to tell me when I'm being a moron, and I appreciate that about you."
Their dinner the other night had been awkward, but at least Tony knows a little bit more about some of the people in the palace. Not that he's seen much of them – he's mostly stayed in his Chambers with Pepper and Rhodey, trying to stave off his heat.
Not that he could have
"Fuck, no," Bucky growls, humour suddenly dissipating. "Do I need to remind you that you have your
"I can only imagine they told you it could hurt to prepare you in case you were bonded with an Alpha who wasn't gentle," Steve says, trying to keep the anger out of his voice. He hates that he has to have this conversation, that Tony doesn't already
"Well, I mean, there were rumours. About the elixir you'd taken, and what it had done to your… well, your cock. And your knot."
He doesn't test it, for now. He watches as Steve moves over to the basin over the fire, picks it up and pours some of the hot water into the bath.
afraid of me," Steve says, but he smiles a little to take away some of the sting. "It's okay, Tony, I'm not mad. I just want to find out why you're scared, so I can try to help."
"Oh, god, Steve," Tony moans, shifting against the mattress. He looks like he's trying to get away and get closer at the same time. "What are you – oh, god."
"Don't we all, pal," Bucky says, clapping him on the shoulder.
"Please," Tony whines, clenching his eyes shut.
"I should have asked," Tony repeats. "Instead of – you said to build aqueducts, I should have –"
"He's probably not a monster," Rhodey grimaces. "I think we'd have heard that much."
"Tony, wait," Steve says, running a hand through his hair roughly. "I know I – I'm not very good at this," he admits. "I don't want you to think… I don't know what I said, but I just want to. Well, I want to get to know you."
Tony kisses him again, and he wants to say 'forever', he does, but it's so hard, hard to admit that he does want Steve as much as he does.
Bucky gives him an unimpressed glare. "I'm saying this shit to wind
," he says, his voice shocked and delighted, and all his own training flies out the window as he leans forward in excitement, clasping a hand over her wrist. "Were you at the Academy? You can't be much older than me, how could I have missed you?"
"So," he says. "Tell me about your day."
heat, at that–"
"Yes, Steve. The words you should have used are 'I like you, Tony. I like you a lot. I think you're gorgeous and I'm ridiculous and stupid and I'd like you to sit on my lap'."
"No, it's not – I mean, yes, but it's – it's just too much, please," Tony gasps.
"And how to take an Alpha's knot down their throats," Bucky snorts, completely ignoring Steve's glare.
Steve picks up the contract again, tuning out their bickering.
He goes slack all at once, and Steve drops to the bed, keeping Tony's hips locked to his. He groans, shivering, and pets over Tony's arms and back, soothing the Omega's sweaty skin.
"I'd love to," Ms. Potts says. "Prince Anthony, will you require anything else this evening?"
As far as Steve knows, she hasn't been off her suppressants or taken an Alpha lover for as long as he's known her.
"One of the things they taught us, in our classes, was the language of flowers. Have you heard of the concept?"
"I'd love some wine," Tony says, and he sounds relieved.
What if Lord Steven doesn't like him? What if Lord Steven casts him aside and sends him away? If he's sent back to Howard in disgrace, there's no telling what Howard would do to him.
Another wave of the heat catches him off guard, and a bead of sweat sprouts at his hairline.
"Or, you know, the elixir that gave him his health and strength must have also made him feral and, well, you know how theories start in small places like this. Some of the townspeople think you might even be dead, though the staff keeps sending food up with Ms. Potts."
Tony, face on fire with a pleased blush, reaches blindly to his left and pulls out a stalk of sweet pea. He shoves it forward gracelessly, and Steve takes it from him.
"I don't – I don't know what else you want me to
"I'm saying – I trust you. If you don't – I know it's really invasive, and it's not
eight days? Oh god.
Steve sets Tony down on a chair, pressing his hips down into it. "Stay here," he orders, and Tony wants to disobey, wants to stand up just to be ornery, but he doesn't. He stays on the chair, even as Steve straightens up to his full height, naked and glorious in the firelight. Steve watches him for a moment, as though to ensure Tony will obey his orders, and Tony gives a little shiver. He wonders what Steve would do if he did disobey — would he turn Tony over his knee? Would there be punishment? Or would Steve be sweet and gentle and solicitous, as he's been up to now?
"That's not part of the deal," Steve tells him. "The point of the Omega Consort is to strengthen our political ties to King Howard's kingdom; that means they choose which one based on which ties it will strengthen."
Instead, he finds himself doodling in a little notebook, his pencil scratching across the page. Pepper and Rhodey leave him to it, reading their own books or watching the scenery go by.
rights and it just
Steve gives him a look, and the sparkle softens a little into a warmth Steve hadn't even dared to hope he'd see. He flushes with pleasure at it, then continues talking. "Do you… have any questions about that?"
what you care about," Bucky tells him, standing up and getting in his face. He doesn't raise his voice, though – Bucky almost never does.
"What do you mean?" Steve asks.
Tony blinks again. Right. Ready.
"Good, I'm a terrible babysitter," she says. "I'm just checking in to make sure you're okay."
Steve huffs out a laugh. "Of course I thought about this."
Tony whimpers, clenches down experimentally, then tilts his hips up. "Please, Steve, fuck me," he says. "Fuck me and knot me."
Steve rolls his eyes. "Put them closer to Anthony," he says. "Not a lot of point having him far away from them."
Steve glares mutinously at him for a long time. "I hate this."
Pepper comes in, and closes the door before they've cleared the hallway.
Tony pulls back slightly, searches Steve's eyes. Maybe he's trying to reassure himself that Steve really doesn't want him to finish the blowjob. Maybe it's reassurance that Steve won't hurt him. Either way, he seems to find what he's looking for, and he pulls back, hands going up over his head and behind his neck to unclasp the halter of his bodysuit.
"No, Bruce is
"Nothing," Tony says. And it's true – it doesn't matter what they
"What do you mean?"
– fluttering around his head.
Tony's hands are long-fingered, delicate and sure as they pick up his utensils and cut away a tiny little piece of elk from the steak on his plate. He uses his fork to bring the tiny morsel to his mouth, and Steve finds his gaze lingering there, on Tony's smooth, pink lips.
beholden to you, he's your
"–Yes, because he
Wilson takes him to a high stone wall, and a heavy wooden gate. Pepper and Rhodey follow along behind them, of course.
"Is it alcohol? Because I feel like alcohol is the only thing in the world that's going to settle my nerves."
There's a stone barrel nearby, and Steve stalks over to it and shoves the bundle of plants into it, pushing them down toward the bottom.
She grins this time. "Still."
Steve blinks at him, looking stricken. "Oh, Tony," he says, and Tony can't help but glance up. He's expecting pity, but he doesn't think that's what this is. It's sympathy, maybe. But not outright pity. "I'm not disappointed in you."
He knows half his urgency is a direct response to the scent of Tony's heat. Their bonding may have been arranged, but his body already recognizes Tony as
that. I want to get to know you, as a person. You're an Omega Consort, yes, and all that that entails but, Tony… first and foremost, you're my bondmate."
Steve blinks at him.
Steve growls, surging forward to push Tony down onto his back in one quick movement, driving into him hard and fast.
He should ask, he supposes, if Tony would like anything. A bath. Food. More wine. But right now Steve just wants to hold him for a while, so he decides that can wait.
"I want to give you whatever you desire," Tony says, and Steve can hear it – it's
"What?"
"Not in the middle of winter, they don't," Bucky says.
And Steve has always been awkward when it comes to dating, so going into this knowing he and the prince are already bonded is making it that much more daunting.
"Dinner?" Rhodey asks, stepping forward to catch Wilson's scrutinizing gaze.
"That's it, sweetheart," Steve praises, carrying him across the room, out into the washing room. The bath is there half filled with water. There's a large basin over the fire, the water hot and rumbling.
And Steve doesn't want that. Howard isn't a

"And now you have," she tells him. "Maybe not the way you intended, but you have."
Although, some days exile doesn't sound all that bad.
"Yes! The Chitauri!" Steve agrees, pacing faster and gesticulating wildly. "Did Sam tell you that Redwing spotted
. Science and math and engineering. He wanted to take things apart, learn how they ticked, then put them back together better than they'd started off.
And Tony's never
"The way you phrased it, Steve… it sounds like you were trying to let him down easy. Like you'd gotten your knot off, had the contractually obligated heat sex, and now you're done with him."
It sits heavy in his belly, mostly because he's sure he's said something to offend Tony. But he'd been compelled to tell him that he hadn't contracted with King Howard to get some kind of sex slave, that
"I don't know what you said to him," she says, heading straight for his wardrobe and pulling out comfortable working clothes. They're still fine, as far as linens go, but not as fancy as his usual wear. "But whatever it was, it worked. He brought me the team this morning. Said you were to have whatever you needed for the aqueduct project. Men, tools, supplies. All of it."
"No, but you knew that already. If only you'd just let him forget about our silly little fishing villages, I'm sure he'd like you much more."
Tony swallows, glancing down at Steve's cock, then back up to his face, as though searching for a lie.
His chest is tight. It's not so much a feeling that he can't get enough air in, more that he feels like there's too much air in his lungs, so there isn't room for anything fresher. He purses his lips and blows air out between his lips in a steady stream, inhales and does it again.
"You're disgusting," Bucky says, but it sounds more like flirting than chastising. "Steve doesn't get to pick an Omega, they already chose him one."
Steve reaches out, takes hold of his wrist. He doesn't hold it hard, but his hand is warm and solid and it freezes Tony in his tracks.
But knowing she's an Omega, and one that had lived through the Krasnyygorod training programs… well, he feels a kinship with her.
Tony blinks at him, brows furrowing. "I don't…"
Steve sits quietly for a moment, going over it in his mind. If he pulls back, tries to look at it objectively… okay, well, he supposes he can see it. The way Tony had been nervous around him that afternoon in the garden. How he'd shut down when Steve had suggested that Tony definitely didn't have to sleep with him, nope, not at all. How he'd let himself fall apart in Steve's arms those nights they'd been together, shutting the whole world out and getting lost in each other's bodies.
"You heard the lady," he says, gesturing down the hall. "Let's get to work."
"That's
"What?"
"God,
"You are more than a Consort, Tony."
Tony manages to keep himself from drinking it directly from the pitcher, a personal victory he doesn't manage every day, to be honest.
Tony steps down into the packed snow, taking his customary place between Rhodey and Pepper.
Tony whines, tries to pull back down, but Steve shushes him, hauling him up so Steve can kiss him.
"Not really," Steve shrugs.
"Is To – is Prince Anthony in?"
it says. It's from Steve.
"I'm good, thank you, you can go."
"If you keep that up I'm going to have to fuck you again," Steve says, voice rough with sleep. "You're insatiable, aren't you?"
"I need you," Tony cries. "I need – I need more, harder, please, it's not enough –"
. Everything was all about politics and glad handing and sucking up to dukes and earls and regents.
"When do you leave?" he asks, dreading it.
"Have you?" she arches an eyebrow at him. "What do you know about your new bondmate?"
Steve sets the kingdom and his closest advisors to frantic preparations. They need housing for the soldiers, they need to reorganize the community stores to sort out the new supplies.
"Don't be lewd, Tony." She rolls her eyes, but the fragile paleness to her face is fading. She looks less heartbroken and afraid for him now, which had been his goal – he's afraid enough for himself without adding her fear to the mix. Her eyes take on a mischievous glint of their own. "I meant your ballroom dancing lessons. You were always quite good with a rhythm."
They begin to head back down the row toward the gate, Steve trailing slightly behind Tony. When they get back to the beginning of the row, Tony turns, and is shocked to find that Steve's hand is full of another bouquet. A new one.
"I like you," he says, softly, to no one. Practicing. "Tony, I like you so much."
"I liked the sex," Steve says, even as he's horrified at the words coming out of his mouth. "With you."
"It'll be fine," Pepper says, handing him a small vial of rosewater. "Use this if you must, but I'm sure they'll offer us a chance to freshen up before we have to meet Lord Steven."
Tony snapped his head at Clint and pointed an accusing finger. “I. Am. Not. A. Carpenter!”
So, remember the time where I mentioned that I'll be posting twice a month, turns out it actually meant I'll be posting twice a month at most. But you did notice that I try to update monthly, I try not to leave a month unattended, except maybe for the month of November.
There was a flurry of limbs and papers, mostly blueprints, and before Steve could register what happened, he was lying on his back beside a broken hoverboard and was staring back at a pair of very brown eyes. His messenger bag was digging at the uncomfortable portion of his back, and he was pretty sure he was lying underneath a once smooth blueprint.
It was either Clint intended for Bruce to hear that, or the building was just too quiet that he heard him say it.
Clint stared at their front door that was covered in duct tape to cover the hole Bruce created. He blinked at the drawn peephole on the gray surface of the duct tape and stared at the note taped next to it.
Clint just stared at him.
Closing the door behind her, Natasha glanced around. No one had returned yet, or maybe they were already there but in their respective rooms.
As he placed the other muffins inside the fridge, not before sticking a note that says:
. Steve thought. “Well there must be a reason.” He said instead, trying to reach out on Bruce, desperate rather.
Suddenly, a very uncomfortable feeling settled on the pit of his stomach, remembering that his scars were on display. And those were not pretty scars at all. Living alone (technically) for years turns out to be a pain in the ass when it comes to living with other people.
"Take me hard, this time," Tony gasps against Steve's skin. "Take me and mount me and — and show me I'm yours."
of me."
for him. That Howard had thrown him in. Like the thirteenth roll in a baker's dozen. Like a, like a free sample. Like an inn's daily special, designed specifically to use up ingredients that would go rotten soon.
"I have to go," Steve says after a few long, deep breaths. Tony shivers at the rumble of his words against Tony's tender throat.
"You'll change your mind," he finally says. His voice is quiet, as though he's admitting it under duress. "Once you get to know me, you'll wish you didn't."
Bucky rolled his eyes. "Fine. Your bondmate. Whatever. Anyway, Clint said you set him up with a bunch of tools, a workshop, and some engineers?"
"Are the rest okay? I didn't know your favourite flower."
And they need to set aside a room in the palace for the Consort and his valets.
"Yes, sweetheart, you're so, so good. You're perfect," Steve tells him, feeling his knot start to swell again. His orgasm builds in the base of his belly, his balls tightening. "I'm gonna come in you, honey, give you my knot again."
Tony pauses thoughtfully, using a knife to smear a tiny bit of butter onto some bread. "I'd heard… well, I'd heard something about an elixir? I heard a lot of things about what it did to you, which obviously aren't true, but I wondered, is there any truth to it at all?"
The next day, Steve is in his office going through their ledgers, trying to concentrate. He's not having a lot of luck with it – he's thinking about Tony, and about what Sam had said to him last night. A knock on the door, thankfully, interrupts him.
. He has all that and more."
Steve knows what that means. It's an invitation, Tony's way of letting Steve know he can fuck up into Tony's mouth. But no, that's not what he wants. He's too close to coming, and he wants his first orgasm with Tony to be in the hot, slick heat of him where he can knot, feel Tony clenching around him as he comes on the thick bulk of it.
As he slips into the steaming water, he sighs. As overheated as his skin feels, the water is soothing.
Not that the Academy had been
Tony wakes slowly, coming back to himself in stages. First he becomes aware of the sounds in the room — Steve's soft breathing, deep with sleep. There's a fire crackling in the fireplace, and children playing in the courtyard outside.
Steve lets out a light, frustrated sound. Tony flinches, so Steve takes a deep breath. "Sorry, I'm not mad at you, I'm mad at… the world, I guess. I hate this. I hate that I have to sit here in our bonding bed and explain to you that it's okay for you to have thoughts and opinions whether I share them or not, and that if you express those thoughts and opinions I won't punish you in some way. I hate it."
"Your highness," Natasha says, dipping her chin lightly in a loose approximation of a bow, and gracefully moving to sit at the table with him before he can even stand to greet her more politely.
"Why are you afraid of me?" Steve asks him.
Tony turns to Rhodey, trying to keep his panic tamped down. "Can you go see how long until my trunks are up here? I need clean clothes, I need, I don't know, everything?"
Should he have asked the kitchen for a different kind of wine?
fine. He'd thought… he'd thought Steve had liked him, at least. A little. But Steve had only wanted him because of his heat, because of the smell of his arousal. It had been biology, nothing more.
," Tony tells him.
"Deal with it how?" Tony asks, voice small.
"What?" Steve asks, feeling uncomfortable under the scrutiny.
"Great," Tony says, taking a few halting steps toward the main gate. Steve doesn't reach out to stop him this time. "I'll see you for dinner tomorrow, then."
"Yes?" Steve didn't understand the disconnect. He'd said exactly what he meant. Why was Bucky
"That's good progress," Tony agrees. They'd been making huge strides lately with the war — they'd even managed to push the Chitauri army out past the borders of Asgard, which had been enough to earn them the support and alliance of Odin and his troops. The Prince, Thor, had been out to visit a few weeks ago on a diplomatic mission, and if Tony hadn't been mistaken, there had been sparks between the towering blond prince and one of his engineers, Jane. Tony imagines they'll be seeing quite a bit of Thor, which suits him fine.
"It's okay," Steve says, bringing both hands up to cradle Tony's face, to keep his gaze on Steve's face so he can see the truth of his words. "It's more than okay, Tony, because I want you, too. You're beautiful, and funny, and you take me so well – of course I want you."
Pepper rolls her eyes, setting out bits of meat and cheese and pulling out a – thank god – flask of coffee. "You know exactly what I mean, Tony. The servants were talking – before I reminded them that they would be better suited to respect their lord and their prince both – earlier and
All my life I've only wanted
Tony thinks. "Like I can't handle it when you go. You're going to have to go, and I'm going to have to stay here, and it will be fine. It will always be fine."
to come to me, but god, Tony, I want you."
"What are you apologizing for?"
"I get the feeling that whatever I just said, you heard something different," he says, keeping his warm, dry fingers looped around Tony's wrist. It feels like a firebrand.
"He's essentially been bought and sold to you, in his mind. You could be a monster, you could be vicious, you could be infirm or old or weak or ill or hideous. He didn't get any kind of a choice. You went into this knowing you were getting a trained Consort, and they're guaranteed to be a lot of things – beautiful, deferential, polite, smart, and yes, sexually gifted. He's coming here after a life of having no agency, no autonomy."
"Those aren't for you," he tells her, pulling the platter an inch away from her. She rolls her eyes.
"So far away from Prince Anthony?" Pepper asks, looking concerned.
"You thought about this?"
Pepper is looking around with wide eyes, as well.
"Anemone," Tony says. "That's one of the ones with two meanings. On the one hand, it's fading hope, or having been forsaken. Or, if you look at it as a positive thing, it's 'anticipation'."
"Alpha, Alpha, Alpha," Tony moans, limbs going limp even as his hips shift and rock, as though he can't take any more stimulation but his body is seeking it out anyway, desperately.
"Then I suggest you get off my lap, stand up and take it off yourself, because I'm going to tear it off you in a second," Steve rumbles, burying his nose in Tony's jaw and nipping at the skin again.
And smash me while in my derriere?
Steve keeps his face open and honest, so Tony nods. "I trust you," he says, and Steve's heart thumps in his throat. That, he knows, is all he can ask for.
"I'm sorry, Tony, we didn't mean to wake you," Steve says, ushering Tony back into the bedroom. Tony's own cheeks heat up a little – had coming out of the bedroom somehow made Steve look weak or foolish in front of one of his subjects? Maybe Steve had wanted to keep their heat-related activities under wraps. So no one would know he'd taken pleasure in Tony's body?
. Tony keeps his face frozen and closed, keeps his eyes on the path in front of them. Ignores the way his eyes are hot, the way his cheeks are tight.
"Right," Tony says. After a moment, he reaches for the top of his shirt, and starts fumbling with the button. His hands are trembling, a little. "So, we're going to do that."
much with it.
"I shouldn't have insulted your kingdom."
"Welcome to America," says the dark-skinned man, smile broadening. "You must be Prince Anthony. It's a pleasure to meet you." The man dips his head in a small bow – not quite enough of one for decorum's sake, but about as much as Tony could honestly stomach right now.
He dips a finger into Tony's hole, watching Tony's whole body shiver and his hole quiver and wink, trying to draw him in deeper.
up, asshole. The kid's gonna have enough trouble when they get here, going from the Capitol and the training academy to the middle of nowhere."

"Tony," Steve says, face screwing up in horror. "Tony, no, that's not – I'm just saying, you're not
have tried, so Tony wishes him luck with that.
When Wilson gets to the door, he steps aside and gestures to it. "He asked if you'd come in alone, actually, if Ms. Potts and Captain Rhodes were okay with it."
"Oh god," he whimpers, giving Pepper his best puppy eyes. "Can you do it for me?"
," Natasha says, and Steve can
He turns back and gives Tony an apologetic smile, but the moment that had been there before is gone. "I'll be back as soon as I can," he says. "Be... well, okay?"
Tony swallows roughly, eyes locked on Steve, whole body thrumming with anticipation of something he doesn't know.
"I don't want you to tell me what I want to hear," Steve says, sliding his hands around to Tony's back, and then, finally, to his gorgeous, full ass. He squeezes it in his hands, basks in the scent of slick arousal. "I want you to tell me what
Rhodes arches an eyebrow at him, then backs away from the door. "I'll let him know you're here."
He's lit lanterns around the room, and the soft flickering light is warm and romantic. But what if Tony doesn't like it? What if the room is too small? Too hot? Would Tony rather he open the window and let the cool air in? Especially with his heat.
Tony can't speak for a moment, and when he does manage to get words out, his voice is thick and cracked. "They're beautiful. Steve – your highness – they're lovely."
"I hate both of you very much," Steve sighs, biting into a pastry. It's good. Lemony.
Pepper pauses. "I don't know. It hurts for some, and not for others. You'll just have to breathe, and relax, and hope."
Tony grins, though it's still a little shaky. "Probably not a bad start, no."
He busies himself with fixing their tea, then brings her a cup and saucer. He sets hers down in front of her, and takes his own to a chair, sitting down to face her. Part of him would rather be alone, if he's honest, to lick his wounds after the afternoon with Steve in the garden, but this is going to be his life, now, here in America. Being alone in his room. He'll wish for the company at some point, so he might as well have it now.
sex kitten?"
Tony sighs, and takes a long, slow sip of his wine. "I really didn't mean to offend you, or insult your kingdom," he starts, straightening his shoulders as though preparing himself to walk to the gallows. "America is lovely, and you should be proud of it."
"How?" he asks, simply. He doesn't want to finish the sentence, to say the words out loud. 'How did you escape? How did you survive?'
Her eyes flash. "It's not
Tony stares at him, stunned. "No, I–"
And Steve had said he'd be gone for weeks, but somehow Tony hadn't thought it would feel so long. But it has been almost two weeks, and he's spent most of the time in his rooms, finding ways to excuse himself from any of Pepper's planned outings. He takes his meals in his room, reads his books, and thinks about all the engineering he
He doesn't get to finish the sentence – Steve seals their lips together again, stopping him and plundering his mouth for a long moment. He tears away breathlessly. "No," he says, panting. "Never think that. I didn't know you, I didn't know how amazing you'd be, and I will be forever, forever grateful that Howard brought you to me."
"Your highness," Clint says, bowing. "It's nice to meet you."
Tony thinks about Steve's searching eyes, the way he'd taken Tony's hands in his, the way he'd called Tony 'sweetheart' even when he hadn't been fucking him. The way Steve had held him, like he'd been something precious.
Will his Alpha allow him his own room? His books, his tools, the many things he enjoys tinkering with? Or will he be locked in a dungeon between heats? God, the possibilities are endless, each more horrifying than the last.
He shifts his hips again, feeling a low twinge in his belly, a hint of desire. It's not urgent, so he just rocks his hips back, feeling Steve's limp cock against his ass, teasing himself and thinking of Steve inside him.
"Oh, I'm an idiot."
"Come here," Steve tells him, and Tony does. He expects Steve to get in the bath so Tony can wash him, clean him of the sweat and come and slick from Tony's body. Instead, Steve kisses him soundly and pushes him toward the tub, helping Tony step over the side and into the wonderfully hot water.
"So," Steve says, once the young man leaves them alone again. He gestures to Tony's plate. "Eat up."
"I know that, and you know that, but literally no one else does." Bucky holds up a hand to stop Steve's next protest. "If you don't give a shit how the rest of the kingdom sees you, think about it from
Steve snorts, burying his face in the crook of Tony's neck, trying to get himself under control. "Is it too much?" He asks cheekily.
"Fuck, yes, please," Tony whines, and Steve takes his cue, starts rocking forward over and over, pushing his knot into Tony's prostate. He watches, fascinated, as Tony spirals higher and higher, wilder and wilder, and then his whole body goes tight as a bow string and he comes again.
Steve is rescued from his floundering when Ms. Potts clears her throat, drawing both their attention across the room.
Tony is sitting in his rooms by himself, flipping through an architecture book and feeling bored and lonely and rejected, when there's a knock at the door. Thinking it must be Rhodey, Tony simply calls from the chair, "Come in!"
Steve leans in and swipes his tongue across the bare entrance, over the slickness and tight muscle. Tony lets out another ragged moan, and Steve sighs because now he can really taste Tony, with nothing in the way.
Once the contracts are received in Starkland, it doesn't take long for word to come back. In a few weeks' time, a caravan of soldiers, supplies, and Steve's new Consort will arrive. They've already set off from the Capitol, according to the note King Howard had sent by raven. They'd travel around the mountains, and be through the swamp lands in no time while they're frozen over.
He feels another hot flash, feels sweat prickle across his brow.
"Do you have a lot of security threats?" Rhodey asks, glancing around the large room. This one is furnished a little more decadently, with rich red and gold rugs and bedclothes. There's a large window with heavy drapes, but it faces west so Tony can look out over the sea.
It makes my night then it makes my day.
God. He's such an idiot. It had been bad enough when he'd thought that Steve had had his fill, had fucked the needy little Omega and was no longer interested. But now, to find out that Steve had never
When Steve finds himself walking down the corridors of the castle toward Prince Anthony's hallway, he wants nothing more than to turn tail and run. He's faced down Hydra hordes, warriors and beasts and he's even faced down Natasha on a bad day, but the idea of meeting his Omega Consort has him tied up in knots.
Steve blinks. "Not impenetrable, but, I mean, apparently it accelerated how fast I heal from things. Why?"
He's denied an answer when the same kitchen boy comes into the room bearing a tray with small cakes on it, and Tony stares at the table while the boy, aggravatingly, seems to take his time in clearing their plates and placing the cakes in front of them.
Steve loves the little quirk of personality, and decides he needs to see more.
"Of course I'm sure," he says, belatedly realizing there had been an extended pause. "I feel like I'm gonna crawl out of my skin."
"He's a young man who has never had agency over himself or his future," she argues, and the lightness of her tone is gone now. "He was sent to the academy for the sole purpose of learning to please an Alpha – an Alpha that he knew from day one he would never get to
"Fuck, Tony, fuck," Steve cries, and Tony doubles his efforts, drawing Steve's orgasm out until he's spent and whimpering.
After the panther king in Wakanda
"You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen," Steve admits in a whisper, and he feels his cheeks flush because that had been entirely too honest. He sits up straight, putting his hands on Tony's hips and pulling him to stand closer to the sofa so that Steve can rest his forehead against the bare skin of his belly. He inhales deeply, savouring the scent of Tony's skin and the waves of heat and arousal, before pressing an open-mouthed kiss just above Tony's navel. "Tell me what you want," Steve says.
his Omega. Maybe it's not been the most traditional bonding, but it had happened. Steve does wish he'd had more time to get to know Tony before his heat, but there's a part of him (a rather large part, as a matter of fact) that's glad his heat has come so they don't have to wait anymore.
"It's fine," Tony says. He keeps his tone light, keeps the edge out of it, but he wants to scream, to yell. It's
"–Don't be crass, Tony–"
Steve gentles his tone, sitting all the way up and placing a gentle hand over Tony's, locked together. He squeezes a little, then brings his other hand forward to pull Tony's hands apart. He brings one up to his mouth so he can press a light kiss to Tony's palm.
But what he wants isn't important, especially not in the face of what it means for the hundreds of people in the kingdom who need what King Howard has to offer.
But when i got my hands on him
They keep walking through halls while Wilson points out the kitchens, the dining hall, and they begin to move into the residential wings.
His eyes meet Steve's right away, and he chews on his lower lip.
"It looks like it'll blow over in a stiff wind," Tony says grimly, putting his notebook into a satchel beside him. "God, isn't there a place we can stop first? So I can, I don't know, freshen up or something?"
"Sure," Steve says. "But what I did… what I was able to do. I didn't do it alone, Tony. I didn't – I didn't
When Steve's knot is fully formed, holding him tight and flush inside Tony's body, he rocks forward a few times, grinding it against Tony's prostate.
"I know," Steve says simply. "There's no rush, though. I want you to do what you want to do. If that's building weapons, even though you don't have to, even though it's more than I have any right to ask of you, then you do that. Until you decide to do the aqueducts, we've been doing fine like this."
Steve groans, pressing kisses against Tony's throat and collarbone as Tony slowly rides him.
"Is it?" Bucky asks.
Tony smiles, and it's back to one of the more natural ones. "Everything's fine, Mr. Wilson."
"Tony, then," she says, taking a sip of her tea. Tony stares at his for another moment before he takes a drink – not because he has any particular desire for tea, but because it's in front of him and gives him something to do with his hands.
His problem now is that he's aware of the cost.
Steve moves forward, letting himself sink onto a small bench near Sam. "Well, I mean, we ate food and neither of us choked, so sure. We'll call it a success."
Tony starts slowly, carefully, trying to gauge Steve's reaction as he slowly pushes Steve's thighs further apart, Steve moves his legs willingly. Tony glances up to check his facial expression, and Steve is watching him raptly, eyes glued to Tony's mouth as he licks and sucks and bobs his head.
Steve sounded.
+++++
It doesn't matter. He'll go to Steve, he'll have dinner with him, and he'll take his punishment like a man.
Tony doesn't say anything, but the hunch of his shoulders seems to relax a little.
Tony comes first, but then he comes again and again, seated and stuck on Steve's big knot as Steve comes, fills him, claims him and marks him and stretches him wide. They're covered in slick and come and sweat, and Tony can do nothing but writhe and jerk as he comes again and again, his body possessed by the Alpha holding him so closely.
God, no, he'll come too soon. But he can't tear his eyes away.
Steve hadn't wanted him at all. Howard had just wanted him
Steve pulls his fingers out and takes hold of the base of his own cock, shifting down so he can angle himself. He lets the tip of his cock slide across Tony's hot, slick entrance, but he doesn't push in yet. Just gives Tony time to get used to the idea, to relax.
Steve sighs, jumping back to his feet restlessly. He begins to pace as he talks. "I don't want to ration our stores. I've
Which is how Steve now finds himself nervously fiddling with silverware at the table in his rooms, fidgeting and pacing as he waits for Tony to join him for dinner.
+++++
wasn't what he'd wanted out of this deal. But he'd also had the wherewithal to make sure he hadn't told Tony that Steve had never
"So who did they choose?"
"Please, Steve," Tony moans, and Steve doesn't make him wait any longer. He doesn't have to bend his knees because the bed is high off the ground. He slides his cock back into Tony's body, revelling in the tight heat of it.
But Tony hasn't been able to separate truth from rumour. For example, according to one tale, not only had he defeated the Red Skull, but he had then proceeded to crack open the Skull's, er, skull, and bathe in his jellied brain matter.
Steve studies him again, then reaches down and picks an alstroemeria stem. He presents it to Tony with a half-smile.
There's a fireplace in the corner with a large cauldron. There's already a fire under it to heat the water inside, and there's another cauldron of water beside that, likely room temperature.
Tony does as he's bid, sitting stiffly on the sofa beside Steve. Steve turns his body part way so they're almost facing each other.
terrified of you."
Steve sits back against the pillows, leaning over to set his wine on the bedside table. "Tony, how do you know how to build an oven? And how to make it work like that, so you can heat the water, and keep it warm?"
Tony shakes his head. "I'm
"Stop," she tells him. Her tone softens. "I'm not saying you'll hurt him. I'm saying you have the
"It's not alcohol," she says, and Tony opens the jar and sniffs it. Apples, cinnamon, pears.
He gives his head a quick shake, following Pepper out of the room. Rhodey brings up the rear, and the three of them march to Tony's rooms. It feels oddly like marching off to war.
"Different colours of carnations have different meanings, too," Tony says, doing his best to dance around the subject without outright lying. "A red carnation is love and pride, while pink is the love of a woman or a mother."
Steve blinked. "But that would have made it sound like I had an expectation that he would. Like I was telling him he
"Oh, it's nothing you did, Cap. He's probably been afraid of you for years."
Steve's brow furrowed. "He's supposed to act like that, he's trained to–"
"The flowers here, in the garden. Will you tell me what they mean?"
"But you're his
"Steve?" Tony asks, stepping forward unsurely.
Tony stands proudly beside the doctor out in the main square when he makes the announcement, surveying over the men and women that are now, apparently, his subjects. Lord Steven – Steve isn't there, though.
"That's it, honey," Steve murmurs, picking up the pace. He can already feel the base of his cock swelling, his knot forming and preparing to lock them together. He wants to see Tony come before that happens, so he reaches between them and wraps his hand around Tony's cock, stroking in time with his thrusts as he picks up the pace, fucks into Tony's body harder and faster.
. The sweet scent of some perfume, light in the air, but underneath it, oh, the spicy, musky odour of Tony's heat-slick.

And no. When Tony thinks of it like that, when he thinks about Steve, he knows. Steve wouldn't mind.
"I don't give a
Tony glances up into Steve's face, feeling a pressure in his chest he can't identify. The truth is, he's touched. No one has ever gone to the trouble of giving him a gift before, even if it is a bundle of poison oak.
"What are bathtubs like in Starkland?" Steve tries.
"Prince Anthony is just about finished dressing," Rhodes tells him. "He'll be out shortly."
His eyes are a rich, dark brown, and Steve wants to study them, to see if they really fleck gold in the candlelight, or if it's just his imagination.
So Howard and Maria had tried over and over to conceive an Alpha, or even a Beta, but each pregnancy after their Omega son, Anthony, had ended in miscarriage – until the last. Maria had died during childbirth, and the infant had died soon after.
He'd always excelled at that, anyway.
"We don't do things in the shadows in America," Barnes tells him. "We're honest around here – about what we do, what we want, and who we are. Can you say the same?"
want him to want to sleep with you?"
He nods. "Yes," he says, stupidly.
Steve checks the mirror again to make sure his hair is still neat. He can't sit still, but that's okay because he doesn't even know what time Tony will be coming to him.

"Absolutely. Now, let's get some liner on your eyes, make him

“Yes, pardon for the discomfort,” Thor said.
“That’s too harsh for a person who you’ve only met days ago, and haven’t even talked to yet,” Steve retorted.
“Oh for the love of all things—”
“No wonder the kid’s got issues,” Tony muttered, earning him a piercing glare from Steve. The shorter man only shrugged, as if trying to get a raise out of him. “Sooner or later he’s gonna have a relapse.”
“Okay,” Tony squeaked quickly, which was funny considering who he was, before jerking his head back towards the door.
Sometimes he found himself wanting to ask Tony if he’s the only one feeling weird around Steve, but Tony follows his own ridiculous schedule—which Bruce couldn’t follow for the life of him. He could probably count in one hand how many conversations he had with Tony.
“You have got to be kidding me,” she groaned.
Natasha shifted on her seat and crossed her legs, raising a challenging brow at her therapist.
Bruce nodded in acknowledgment “You’re early.”
Telling how much of a shit he used to be was starting to sound like a stupid decision now that Clint was revisiting the memory of Bruce’s breakdown in his room.
The girl snapped off from her trance and immediately retracted her hand. “Sorry!” she said before going back on dabbing at Bruce’s nose, this time more careful. “I just—”
. He should be pissed, he should be angry, but honestly, Clint wasn’t, and in fact, he couldn’t really feel anything. As if a part of him knew they were bound to find out about it.
It used to have a name plastered on the front of it, either the owner was too lazy or just plain cheap, because through time the letters disappeared—mainly because the place was a close friend of any visiting rainstorms that loves to take a souvenir, and the only thing that’s left was the letter A. The place became known as Building A.
Natasha stared at him blankly before crossing her arms over her chest and leaned back. “I know that Tony’s course is Electrical Engineering and has the habit of tinkering loudly in his room, he also have this weird hatred for Hammer Tech. I know that Thor has an unhealthy liking for Pop Tarts and that he’s very easy to please because he seems to be interested in about everything.” Natasha narrated. “Clint’s deaf and likes archery, also can be an annoying asshole like Tony, and can’t seem to afford a single Stark Tech. I know that Steve has a notebook filled with his drawings and has a liking on cooking. And I,” She straightened her sitting position. “Am the Mysterious Lady that everyone kept on calling as a ghost for the first few weeks, I always seem to be out of the house and looks to know a lot more than any of you do, and I also seems to hold grudges against nicknames.”
Staring at the door, he remembered the happenings from last night.
“Oh, so you where joking, ha ha, very funny,” Tony said annoyed as he rolled his eyes, involuntarily getting way too close at Steve. His breath hitched,
“Have you ever felt like you have to prove yourself?” Clint suddenly asked.
ran away,” Clint pointed out munching down a tuna sandwich.
He glanced at Loki, the kid, and at Thor, then decided to keep quiet about the fact that they look nothing alike. But gazing on the look the others were sporting, he knew he’s missing something. Is there something they knew that he doesn’t?
Clint paused, the realization setting in.
Natasha did her best not to roll her eyes. Stereotyping is an awful thing to do, but she couldn’t help it whenever she’s around him. “No, he was making a racket and I couldn’t sleep.”
Kudos and comments are much appreciated!
Tony is not one of those people who try so hard to make small talks that end in disasters, he's usually the person that people tries to engage in small talks, but the guy looked like he’s about to face three board exams in three minutes at the same time. Tony’s pretty sure it’s illegal to look stressed like that at the first month of college.
Thor frowned, she did really great with Thor—then again Thor would befriend even a cactus if he had no other choice. So hearing that she’s not really good with people was a little surprising. “Really? I think you’re pretty great at it.”
“The toaster’s right here—"
“I killed my dad.”
He picked it up and glanced at the fridge.
Ignoring the pain from his head, Clint bolted down the stairs. Hearing aids cost a fortune, especially Stark hearing aids, he can’t handle losing one. He could barely sustain himself with his lousy part-time job. Even though he wanted to give up so bad at some point, he just can’t. Going back there, to that kind of life, he can’t do that anymore.
“Hey, hey, hey, whoa!” Tony suddenly exclaimed. “No one told you to move out, no one’s moving out.”
Bruce had half a mind to ask Tony if he was serious, but he found himself staring at Tony then back at the stranger, then back again at Tony, then back at the stranger, before raising both of his arms, as if surrendering. He doesn’t know if Policemen usually barge in carrying heavy boxes, but he’s not asking. “I promise you, I barely know him.”
“Stop being a douche,” Clint retorted. “I think you forgot that I’m feeding you,” he reminded.
Steve was suddenly pulled out from his thoughts when he heard someone calling his name. Snapping his head towards the voice, he saw Clint waving his hand at Steve. Spending his free time always alone suddenly felt depressing and someone asking him to come over made him…
“Need help?”
“Yeah, well, tell that to your still tomato of a face,” Tony gestured at Steve. “Seriously, that is a talent, no one could stay red that long, you know that right?”
“Are you all guys aware that it’s four fifteen in the morning?” she asked.
Natasha noticed the small smirk Tony had on his face and she actually had to stop herself from doing the same thing. The thought that Tony thinks he had his own joke that he could only understand, the joke being no one knowing who he is when his name is the leading brand all over the globe, and yet Natasha also knew about it without him knowing entertains her in a cynical way.
“Listen, you don’t have to—”
“Have coffee with them,” Jane said. “To be honest, it’s usually the first step.”
“Oh, thirteen,” Clint said. “I’m sorry.”
“Alright then—”
Tony blinked a couple of times. “Well, if you put it that way, it sounds stupid.”
“I was home-schooled actually,” Thor replied as he went back to smiling.
“Are we getting on with the tour or not?” The man asked instead, running a hand through his brunette hair.
Tony made a beeline towards the fridge and pulled out his now empty milk carton. He gave it a little jiggle before cursing, “It already has a fucking name on it dammit” before throwing it in the trash bin.
The two blonds immediately turned towards the sound and saw Tony standing by the open door.
Steve almost laughed,
Doesn’t it always?
Clint blinked unimpressed, then took a bite, then blinked again—more unimpressed. “I shouldn’t probably be saying this, but you should lay off the coke and get back to school.”
Bruce thought if the event that had happened after his breakdown was good; finding yourself in the ER while everyone waited outside. As far as he’s aware, none of it was good, all he got out of it were two broken doors, a broken mirror, and people walking on eggshells. “How would I know if there is?”
“Then why stop?”
For a moment, she thought he caught her looking at him, but the guy appeared to be more preoccupied at judging the place.
“Why do I feel like a disgrace to Uncle Sam?” Tony asked.
“It’s you’re brilliant idea anyway, you open the door.” Clint said and Tony gave have a incredulous look.
A note was taped on the box:
“Yup,” Tony said. “Electrical Engineering.”
She was fortunate enough to land a decent job a shady nineteen-year-old could ever get. And just to get her therapist off her back, she agreed to attend college.
Grinning, Clint dropped his bag on the ground and grabbing the remote under one of the cushions before dropping down on the couch beside Thor. Well, there was a sizable space between them but Thor couldn’t really care. For some reasons, its working and he still couldn’t believe it.
Tony raised his hands as if surrendering. “Well I’m outta here.” He announced slowly backing away, Clint grabbed him by the left arm, and yanked him back in the room.
It only started on Bruce, then Tony, then Steve, then the next thing he knew, he was secretly watching all of them wander around the building. He watched them create stories about him and the lady being a ghost, how Tony asked Bruce about his milk being empty again, how Steve always follows his inhuman schedule and how Thor, well, be Thor. Everything about the guy was already amusing.
“Wanna watch Walking Dead?” Clint suddenly asked, “I heard there’s a marathon going on.”
He had a feeling that the statement was also for him.
Kudos and comments are much appreciated!
notice, h also looked down at the boy’s feet, only to find it barefooted. He didn’t notice it before, due to the fact that the slacks was too long for the boy, but now he did. Clint groaned and rubbed his temples, he’s having a Thor episode again. “You know, you shouldn’t have ran away from home.”
Tony turned and saw mister blonde and muscle standing by the stairs. Tony wondered how he looked like, must be stupid enough to make this hundred pounds of muscle stand awkwardly by the stairs. Steve, was holding a bundle of clothes and a towel hung on his shoulder, and it didn’t really help the situation.
Maybe it just instinct moving, but there was a flurry of movement as the teenager tried to bolt. Bruce was only able to recognize Thor shouting something—maybe his native language, and Clint cursing like a sailor, but one thing’s for sure, whoever this kid is, he’s not suppose to get away.
The kid, who appeared to be named Loki (What is wrong with their parents?) yanked himself out of Bruce’s grasp, but was only able to send them both sprawling on the ground. It wasn’t a graceful fall to be exact, considering that both of his hands were occupied, with one keeping his nose intact.
“I waited, in fact, I was what people describe as ‘geeking out’—did I use the term correctly? Nevertheless, I was excited. The whole day I daydreamed of the answers that will come forth to my question. Alas, when I came back, the refrigerator was bare and it holds no answers to my question.”
“Are you his best friend or something?” Bruce asked, because in all honesty, he couldn’t see it happening.
“Then just buy what you usually buy.”
Clint didn’t say anything for a minute and to Thor, it felt like hours. “Is this about the hearing aids?” he asked, “because it’s fine, I’m not mad.”
She was about to climb up to her room when she caught something from the corner of her eyes. Frowning, she made her way at the couch and grabbed the blue notebook wedged on the sofa cushions—how she managed to see it was one of the attributes she liked about herself. Sometimes it has its downsides, but it comes really handy especially from peeping Toms.
“Natasha,” Steve said, answering the amused expression Tony had schooled on his face.
He stood still for a moment, but curiosity got a better of him and he found himself straining his ears to hear the conversation. He was able to register that Clint was there, and the person the shouted was really Thor, and two other voices Bruce isn’t familiar off.
She wanted to correct him that they weren’t roommates, they don’t share a room after all. Instead, Natasha found herself saying: “I threw my slipper at Tony the other night.”
Steve would give nervous glances every now and then, Tony for his part looks really uninterested, Clint was the only one the kid would talk to—in all honestly talking wouldn’t even be the word to describe the how they communicate—Bruce was never really good with reading people, therefore he doesn’t really know where Natasha stands. But everyone never asked, never spoke anything with why Loki was even staying with them.
“Well, pizza and popcorn sounds good for a movie night.”
Jane fought of the embarrassment growing in her stomach, she’s talking to Thor for heaven’s sake. Of course, he didn’t mean it like that. She really needs to stop assuming.
But the thing that he’s lacking was the fact that he’s not that familiar within his base of operation, considering that Clint was still running after him.
Bruce’s frown went back to his face, “But seriously, do you really talk like that? It’s the 21st century.”
Tony glared at the mountain of boxes he placed on the side of the truck and glared at the other boxes still inside the truck. It wasn’t the fact that he had a lot of stuff—the boxes barely contained any of his clothes, it’s just that most of them just contained his tools and ‘creations from hell’ (Pepper’s words). If possible, he’ll box Dum-E up in a heartbeat.
“Care to explain?”
Tony leaned closer to Thor and whispered, “How old is your brother again?”
“Pass,” Clint replied terror-stricken.
Everyone’s far from him, but he could live with that.
Natasha stared at the living room, watching the dispute Thor was having with Loki while the other three watch, “You don’t,” she simply said. “Sometimes, others would,” she paused as she continued to stare at the others. “Thor told us the last time he left his brother alone, he ended up waiting outside the emergency room.”
Tony just pointed at the note.
“Tony you rat bastard,” Clint muttered smiling.
“How was your day?”
“Calm down my friend,” Thor tried to reason but Bruce only smashed his head backwards hitting Thor square on the face. Impressively, Thor’s hold didn’t budge. “Ouch, that hurts.” He said, not at all even hurt.
he thought as his whole back ached.
“To be fair, no one asked you to come here,” Loki said still in the midst of suffocating from Thor’s embrace, “We don’t know you.”
Clint rubbed his temples before pulling out his phone. He was going to miss his next class but who cares, he was failing anyway. Putting his phone away, he stood up, startling the kid. “C’mon, the line’s short,” Clint said gesturing at the hotdog stand.
“Good,” he said. “We’re good.” Wanting to change the topic, his eyes landed on Bruce’s bag. “What’s with the bag? It’s a weekend.”
She didn’t know how long she stood there, but in the end, she ended up fisting her raised hand instead. Shoving both hands in her pockets, she exhaled and left. What was she going to leave anyway? For Clint to use earplugs? Bruce already did it anyway.
Instead, Thor said yes.
Steve paused before shrugging. “Well, we did sign up for this.”
Bruce wondered if living with a vampire, two ghosts, and a robot is a good thing to tell his children someday.
And he calls himself a genius.
But Thor was trying.
Maybe they were right, maybe he never should have given up therapy. But then again, it was making things much worse than actually helping. He couldn’t count the times he contemplated punching his therapist’s face whenever he would jot something down. But maybe he should have, then he would’ve been sent to jail even with his age—because killing his father wasn’t enough, apparently—then maybe, he wouldn’t be right at this moment.
“Oh, okay, wow. Um—” Bruce continued to scratch the back of his neck. “So sorry about, the hitting you part, by the way, also don’t do that, we don’t use that as a greeting here.”
Climbing back to his room, Steve glared at the finished painting perched on the middle of his bedroom and wondered if he should just throw it away. It looked worse than ever, it just felt so blank. Like it was telling an empty story.
He continued to trudge down the road as he continued to speak through the phone. “Anyway, that’s about it,” He paused but was still walking. “I would really want to hear back from you. Oh, and if you deleted my number again, it’s me, Thor, your brother.”
And so, Tony explained the whole marathon situation. How after getting back from the university, he found Clint and that weird guy, Thor, watching The Walking Dead and how he thought that maybe watching with them wouldn’t be so bad. How he suddenly came aware that all six of them were suddenly crowding the living room. And how Clint left a note asking them about doing it again.
“Yeah but—” He didn’t get to finish what he said as she’s gesturing at Steve that he was blocking the door.
“How much for the pizzas?” Natasha asked as she purposely ignored Steve’s eyes boring on her. He did it first, she couldn’t see why she can’t do it too.
That moment, when Natasha saw the foods in the fridge with the name ‘Clint’ taped at the front of each, she only raised a brow and rolled her eyes.
“You know, you don’t have to force yourself.”
Anyway, I was dead set on using the comics for Thor's life, but then i realized it would only work if I made Thor suffer amnesia, but we already had Captain America for that 'hospital related' backstory. And so I decided to watch Thor a few days ago and used that instead. I hope you liked it!
she asked.
“Morning,” Steve greeted as he made his way towards the fridge.
“So,” Clint said. “Tony called you.”
Grabbing his wallet from his nightstand, he wondered if he had enough money to make spaghetti.
“I chose to forget things, but I also chose not forget the reason why I have to.” Natasha pushed herself off the fridge. “Breaking that mirror isn’t nice, but if you look at it differently, there’s something good that came out of it. Forgetting that means forgetting the good that happened after that.”
Natasha raised an eyebrow and cocked her head slightly to the right. “As far as I’ve known there’s only one fridge and you’re standing in front of it.”
Steve didn’t know what to reply—for starters he doesn't know or care who Pepper was, instead, he just continued picking up the scattered papers.
Yeah, yeah. I know most of the writers here have jobs and they're still able to update weekly. And honestly, I can't really give you an excuse. It's just that, I write really, really slow. In a day, I'll only be able to write for an hour, which usually ends up consisting one paragraph, before giving up and deciding to continue it tomorrow.
“Oh, right, I, umm, sorry.” Steve replied sheepishly as he edged away from the fridge for Natasha. Suddenly conscious about the time, Steve looked over his wrist watch and found that it's still too early for any of the classes to start. And for some odd reasons, the thought made him strike up a question—considering that Natasha’s the kind of person you would rather not ask anything—Steve wondered why he had the sudden guts to do it.
Anyway, Comment and leave a Kudos!
Clint was quite for a minute, the boy taking that as the end of the conversation and giving back his full attention on the food in front of him. “Or maybe,” Clint said, voice a lot lower than what’s normal. “It’s a side affect.”
As soon as she told her therapist, he actually thought it was a good idea to live with other people. He just doesn’t know Natasha was doing everything to avoid them at all cost. Her job was a good excuse when classes haven’t started yet, and once classes did start, avoiding them would be a walk in the park.
Natasha’s eyebrows furrowed for a second, but didn’t ask.
“Crisps,” Peggy repeated. When Steve just stared at her, Peggy sighed and grabbed a bag of chips at the shelf that was facing the shelf of popcorn. “Crisps,” She said holding the bag out.
“Loki,” Bruce started, but couldn’t bring himself to continue.
Tony isn’t stupid, he knows the difference between a routine and stalking. And with the look that Steve ended up having whenever they cross paths together proves Tony’s hypothesis. The hoverboard incident made some sense now. Though how he managed not to notice a walking supermodel like Steve was beyond him.
Biting his lower lip, Tony closed his bedroom door and grabbed the first pair of clean clothes he laid his eyes on.
Thor blinked.
“How do you get others to notice you?” Thor asked.
“Oh, you can just all call me Pepper,” She replied smiling at everyone.
Anyway, I just turned a year older last... few weeks Hahahaha! I kinda hoped that'll mellow down the furry of my late update. I mean, birthdays, you should enjoy it before it becomes something you'll hate to even think about.
Again, it went to voicemail.
Leaning back—with Bruce getting notably rigid, Natasha found herself with a project in mind.
Bruce winced, Tony definitely did not made things better, Natasha only rolled her eyes.
Clint’s not stupid, he wants to prove that he’s just like everybody else. That even if he’s a freak of nature: raised in a circus, a brother who wouldn’t give a shit about him, a thief, and the fact that no one would be waiting for him anywhere, he still wants to prove that he’s like anybody else. He wants to leave his previous life, forget it rather, prove that he can reach so much more. Even when he’s well, not…
The last part was added as if it was just an unimportant afterthought, but Thor didn’t know that.
A circus freak.
It’s not her position to meddle, but her therapist did advise her to get herself involved. Okay, maybe he meant a different kind of involved, but he should take this as a win, considering that she had made it her life mission never to accept any of his advice.
The girl stared at them.
Being deaf isn’t really a huge hazard for Clint. Sure it can really be annoying at times, but being deaf for most of his life, it’s only normal to get used to it. Clint wasn’t really born deaf, it’s just like any other cliché childhood story where he got it from an accident.
“I told you there are ghosts here. And there’s two of ‘em,” He hissed. “I can’t stay here Pep.”
She learned not to be attached, but maybe she could make an exception at people who aren’t so bad. She was still scared, yes, but a bigger part of her was enjoying it. Besides, like her, she noticed everyone was taking baby steps.
“Guys, shut up,” Clint warned.
Remember when I said I'll only be able to update twice a month then suddenly not updating the whole month? Yeah, about that... I'm sorry?
Before the kid could do so much as kick him on the face, Thor crouched down beside them and yanked Loki away by the collar. Bruce took Clint’s hand as he helped him up, before proceeding to inspect his nose.
“So? How would you feel?”
The nameless boy glared even harder. “I’m sixteen.”
In the end I may have enjoyed writing Thor a bit too much. He ended up having the longest chapter so far.
They stayed like that, waiting for Bruce to calm down. But he never calmed down, in fact, they suddenly noticed that the small noises he was making were whimpers. Turning to look at him, they saw that Bruce was finally seated on the floor while his other bloody hand covers his face.
There was a crash, that sounds like glass braking, and Steve immediately found himself knocking on the bathroom door. “Bruce,” another knock. “Bruce, are you alright!”
Natasha shook her head. “Not that.”
She was never really good at giving advice, much less to a person interested in a polyamorous relationship. Plus, giving advice in a very public place is easier said than done, they should really start hanging out in a café or something.
The first floor contained a fridge and a kitchenette by the far corner, next to it was another door. Near the kitchenette was a long dining table, the young man couldn’t help but raise an eyebrow at the owner. Was he expecting the tenants to eat together like a freaking family or something?
At this point, he didn’t really care if they don’t go to the same university.
“That’s because he didn’t,” Clint, again, pointed out which made it a lot confusing.
“Scared of a little underwear are we?” Tony teased. “Don’t worry, you might be an endangered species at this day of age, but I’m pretty sure cohabiting with one isn’t so hard.”
She had that look again like Thor was an interesting specimen. “I was joking,” she laughed. “But, that must’ve been some kind of problem, to get you looking like that.”
He sighed and scribbled something on his clipboard. “Have you joined any extracurricular activities?”
“Clint always eats chips, he might get tired with this easily.”
He was thinking any logical explanation why a hearing aid was on the bathroom sink when his too idle brain realized something.
Steve stared at her retreating form, asking himself
“The usual,” Steve replied as he glared at the dark shades of the image he was creating.
Before he could excuse himself to grab his hearing aids up his room, Tony threw him a box. He immediately caught it, before he could ask what the hell it was, Tony was out the door.
Then a distant memory of Loki watching in front of the TV with rapt attention resurfaced from his head, the view of being on top of the mountain was illuminated through the screen. Bruce found himself slowly backing out from the scene when he heard Loki say something about how beautiful the world looks and what would it feel for people to kneel before him.
But as soon as Howard had received Lord Steven's signed agreement, he'd taken away Tony's suppressants.
When they get to Tony's rooms, Rhodey stays at the door while Pepper whirls into action. She's laying out tools on the tables – a shaving blade, creams and gels and perfumes, kohl liner. She dumps a pile of lacy underthings on the bed, and Tony's face goes red again. She's seen it all – hell, she'd picked most of it out. And at this point, Tony doesn't have a lot of modesty left. But still, now it's all
"He wants me to… build aqueducts."
"Oh, yeah," Tony says, a little strangled. "This is gonna be fine." Then he slides his mouth back down, sucking Steve all the way into him. He swallows and licks and bobs, taking Steve deep in his throat, over and over.
"In time," Steve says, suddenly pushing up and to his feet, looming over Tony. It's alarming, exciting, and Tony is urgently reminded of Steve's strength, his size, the way Steve can hold him down and take him and god, he needs Steve in him now.
He sounds like an idiot.
"Nah. I just never liked bullies, and if anyone was a bully, it was Hydra. So I went to see an apothecary in the village. I didn't expect… I just wanted to be healthier, really. So I could do my part and fight. But he had something different, something special. It made me healthy, sure, but it also made me taller and stronger and faster."
"What do yellow carnations mean?" Steve asks, taking another step closer. Tony can almost smell the tang of clean earth, fresh sweat, even coffee on Steve's skin.
It makes Tony feel powerful and beautiful.
"I will do those water pipes," Tony tells him, surprised at the sound of his own voice. No defiance, but also no bravado, none of the subservient tone he's used to hearing out of his own mouth around his Alpha. "The aqueducts, all of it. Just like I said."
running water. He said he could do that here."
He rocks forward a little, pushing his knot against Tony's prostate, and Tony  screams, cock pulsing between them again.
an Alpha into wanting him by shaving and curling and lifting and colouring. That he's the one that has to do all the work.
"Oh, but it's so
"From a Chitauri scout troop?" Tony tries to make his tone dry, but doesn't quite succeed.
"He's not here," Pepper says, sounding thoughtful. She looks like she's about to say something else, but then her face changes, taking on a polite but scrutinizing smile looking over Tony's shoulder.
"You can't know that," he says back to her, knowing his voice sounds miserable. "In fact, you're more likely wrong."
"You're working," Tony protests half-heartedly, voice still rough with sleep.
"Tony," Steve says. It's gentle, but it's still insistent. "What's wrong?"
His knot is swollen, big and hard and Tony wants to feel it inside him, but he has to wait now. Not that he would trade it – watching Steve come like that, watching Steve come not because of using Tony's body, not from fucking him, but from what Tony had done to him, how Tony had pleasured him.
"Well, sure, it's not
"Do you want that, darling? Want to be mine?"
Barnes studies him. "Why are you here?"
"Steve is kind to most people," she shrugs. "I'd hoped he would be kind to you, too."
. Steve drives his tongue into Tony's mouth, hunting his taste and heat and slickness. Tony sighs, rocking forward on Steve's lap.
, that I don't expect him to just be a warm body to knot–"
"Please, please, please," Tony cries, clawing at Steve's shoulders.
about his virtue," Steve growls. Bucky doesn't back down, though – if anything, he leans in, nose to nose with Steve.
, Tony, to let you think for even one second that I don't want you. I want you with every fibre of my being, every breath and thought and and beat of my heart."
"Gather your things," she tells him, and her voice takes on an edge. It's a warm edge, though. It's a tone that's telling him what to do because she knows him, knows him well enough to know that he's frozen now, not sure what to do. His footing is uneven, and he doesn't know what to do with this new information.
"Fuck, Tony, god, you should have – are you okay?"
. He's a
"Your highness, if I may?"
Of course, Tony's own pleasure in it will be more theory than practice. He thinks that if he can manage to satisfy Lord Steven, that will be the most important thing.
News of the day, his
Tony shakes his head, but he doesn't say anything.
Steve's face falls a little, and he looks confused. "Is something wrong?"
Bucky crows out a laugh. "I bet they teach them to call fucking 'bond-strengthening discourse,' too."
Steve blushes. He knows that. He's known it since that afternoon. He can see it in the dampness on Tony's upper lip, the brightness of his eyes. He can smell Tony's pheromones, the slightly spicy, sweet scent of slick and heat. But somehow, having Tony say it so bluntly, so openly, makes him shy.
As Steve fucks him, hard and fast, Tony's ass leaks slick and Steve's own spent come. Transfixed, Steve reaches down and swipes his fingers through the pool of it and brings his fingers up to Tony's lips.
Natasha had been right – he needs to treat the man kindly, but Steve would be doing that anyway.
Steve nods. "So I guess King Howard isn't my very biggest fan."
He'd tried showing his father some of his designs, once. Mostly they were weaponry, because he'd been hoping that might interest Howard enough to actually look at them. But instead, the King had simply crumpled them up and thrown them out, throwing Tony out of his drawing room.
A slow smile stretches across Tony's face, and it's filled with hope. It looks beautiful on his face.
It's made of lace, and the lace instantly makes him think of his afternoon in the garden with Steve; it has beautiful, delicate flowers embroidered through it.
My eye is drawn towards tall men
"And if I could give you a team of strong men. Men and tools and whatever else you needed. Could you do that here?"
He could go to Bucky, but he feels like Sam will be the better bet.
doing because he's just an Omega bitch there to service his Alpha's knot.
"No," Tony gasps, hitching his hips back, thrusting down onto Steve's cock. "No, god, please don't stop."
"And what do yellow carnations mean?"
"What??"
Steve watches the birds for a long moment, chewing his bottom lip thoughtfully.
"I think they called it 'bond-strengthening discourse', but yeah."
. No, not at all, Tony – I wanted to let you know you don't
"No, no, she wasn't looking for – she was trying to schedule the prince's appointment."
Well, okay, that's not strictly true. That's just not something he wants to do
– putting together two cups of tea.
A slow, wicked smile spreads across Steve's lips. "I'll show you," he says. He pushes Tony's hips down to the bed, none too gently, and manhandles him so one knee is pushed up and out, spreading his thighs wide apart. Tony flops down onto his belly, unable to hold himself up against Steve's pressure, and Steve buries his face, finally, in the lace between Tony's cheeks.
Tony feels his cheeks heat. Had Steve done it on purpose? Left Natasha at home to talk to Tony, convince him that Steve wasn't the kind of Alpha he'd read about in school? That Steve would let Tony do what he wanted, have what he wanted?
"The plight of your people," Bucky says, popping the last of the pastry into his mouth and licking crumbs off his fingers. He wipes them off on his jeans, then reaches forward for another copy of the contract so he can flip through it as well. "Though, I still think you can probably find a better way if it makes you that unhappy."
"Of course," Steve finally says, tearing his eyes away from Prince Anthony's. He gestures to the hallway behind him. "I was – I was hoping to take you to dinner, Prince – Prince Anthony."
"Okay, well, um, I'll start," Steve says. "I guess you know I fought in the war."
"You think Howard's gonna send you contracts for an Omega Consort with some poisoned baked goods? Coulda just sent an assassin, it'd be simpler."
Tony cries out again, and Steve knows he's coming a second time already, his whole body jerking and pulsating as he writhes on Steve's knot.
"What is this place?" Tony asks, whirling around to take the rest of it in. The gate has closed behind him, and the stone wall is surrounded by lush rosebushes. An honest-to-god peacock wanders by across the stone path. There's even a fountain in the centre, with white flowers and lilypads in the water. He can hear the singing of frogs. "It's
a heat before. God, here Steve is, thinking about himself, when Tony's going through his first heat, about to have his first Alpha.
"What's security like here at the castle?" is the first question Rhodey asks as they step through the large front doors. The entry hall is dimly lit, but decorated warmly.
She glances back at him as she heads for the door, but he doesn't meet her eyes. "I don't know what I said," she says. "I'm sorry."
"I'm not going to let your stubborn attitude ruin this contract," Howard had growled at him. "You'll stop taking the potions now, and by the time you reach America, you'll go into heat within a few days, and you can consummate the bond and then you won't be my problem anymore."

And Tony
"Well, all flowers have a meaning. Giving a certain type of flower can convey a message to the person you're giving it to. It's more than just 'flowers are a present'. Each individual flower has a meaning, and some of them, together with other flowers, have an entirely different meaning."
No, that's a surefire way to get himself sent back to Howard in disgrace, to spend the rest of his days in exile.
do for entertainment? When you're not busy with your, um, your duties?"
Tony starts talking about the weather as they eat, keeping his bites small and far apart. Steve feels awkward, not sure how to get back the easiness they'd had the last time they'd been in this room together.
Steve rolls his eyes. "The elixir didn't do anything to my dick, Tony."
The servants tell Pepper, and Pepper tells Tony, that the whole team had arrived back, and brought their Chitauri prisoner with them. They'd been unable to glean any information from him, and brought him home so they could continue their interrogation.
"Do you think he'd mind?"
but it wouldn't look as nice, you're right. Fine, you're re-hired."
Tony nods, jerky, breathing hard above him. Steve reaches for his cock between them, wraps his hand around it and starts to stroke. After a minute, it starts to swell and harden under his touch, and Tony starts making breathless moans, his hips twitching slightly.
"Love, love," Steve moans, spreading his legs, and Tony is struck by an idea.
"Well…" Bruce starts, and Steve pushes up from his chair, looming as well as he can in the well-lit room.
"No," he says, voice warm as he nestles in more closely. "You never did, did you?"
thing Steve wants is to take Prince Anthony through to his bedroom.
Tony's return kiss is beyond enthusiastic, his lips and tongue desperate and hot – either uncaring about the taste of his own slick on Steve's lips, or excited by it. He surges up, pushing Steve back on the bed, rolling over to straddle him. Tony's fingers work frantically at Steve's clothes, pulling his shirt up over his head, then working at his pants. He pulls them down and off in a hurry, moving with them, then looks up at Steve's body. Steve doesn't shy away, unbothered by his nakedness. His cock is standing tall and proud, slick at the tip with pre-come.
in the middle of their Omega's heat, and their
"Please," Steve says, not sure if he's begging her to translate the apparent communication breakdown between the two of them, or just to put him out of his misery altogether.
Tony sighs again. "In Starkland, they've built aqueducts. It's an amenity I've grown quite fond of, and it hadn't occurred to me that other parts of the kingdom might not have the same thing."
Tony looks him up and down, eyes catching on his dick. "Oh," he says, softly. He swallows roughly.
Tony lets out a shaky chuckle. "Not really, but I'll go along with it."
While regular men were fun to play with
Back when he'd thought Steve might want him, even temporarily.
"I want you, I've wanted you since the moment I saw you and I will want you every moment since," Steve whispers into Tony's mouth, pulling at his clothing and kissing bare skin.
"So if you want to fill a pot, or a bathtub, or anything, you just go to the spout and turn it on – when the valve is open, water pours out. When you close it, the water stops."
"Yeah? Did I hurt you, sweetheart?"
"Well,
"Oh ho ho ho," Clint says, sitting up gleefully. "Is this where you get to choose which Omega you're going to stuff your –" he's cut off when Bucky shoves a pastry into his open mouth. Clint barely lets it faze him, just humming thoughtfully and beginning to chew the oversized mouthful.
what they mean. "They're very nice."
"What if he doesn't like me?" Tony asks, his voice quiet. He hadn't meant to say it, but once the words are out there's nothing he can do to suck them back in.
"–and I want him to know that anything from here on out is his
"I grew up pretty sick," Steve finally says, keeping his tone light and gentle. "I was never well. I was a wisp of a thing, I could barely climb a flight of stairs. But I wanted to help with the war."
"It's definitely happening tonight," Tony says, barrelling through the open door to Pepper's chambers. Rhodey follows after him, and Tony ignores the eyeroll he gives Pepper.
tell you that I liked being with you. That I like
"You're a menace," He breathes, and Steve huffs a laugh another gentle kiss pressed against Tony's collarbone.
"Would you like some tea?" he asks her, already heading for the cabinet. He has a kettle of water over the fire already, having thought maybe he'd see Pepper for tea after dinner.
Tony's head jerks up at that. "Weeks? Not – not days or – why weeks?"
"No, Tony," she says, with a small smile. "I think it's about y–"
Steve grins, reaching up to kiss Tony's soft, full lips. "I'll carry you to the bath and back, I swear."
It's probably a trap.
He fucks into Tony from below, speeding up the hand he's using to stroke Tony's cock. Tony cries out, spurts come up over his chest, shivering with another orgasm.
The child had been an Alpha.
"It's too much, I can't – I can't take it," Tony whines, even as his cock throbs, desperately trying to get hard again. His ass clenches around Steve's cock.
"Are you sure?" she asks.
Steve blinks, feels his cheeks heat. Off to a great start, then.
"I want you, too," Tony moans, arching his back. Steve nips at the thin skin at his collar bone, and Tony cries out. Steve can feel his cock, hard between them, has hard as Steve's own. "I didn't think I'd – but I do, god."
"Yeah?" Pepper asks, eyes warm and twinkling happily as she slides into the chair beside him, leaning her head in conspiratorially. "He was good to you?"
, Steve," she says, giving him a soft smile.
"Did he, you know, feel bad about it?"
"I've got you, sweetheart," Steve rumbles against the column of Tony's throat. "You're okay."
"Okay."
Tony steps into the hall and closes the door behind himself, disheartened when Steve takes another small step back, keeping his distance.
Steve stays outside the tub, reaches for a bottle of rose-scented soap and a sponge, then methodically and gently begins to wash Tony. He takes care with it, holding Tony's arm up in the air to scrub every inch of skin clean.
+++++
"Oh, love, we're not nearly done yet," Steve says, the words a growl and a promise and a threat. Tony moans into the kiss, shifts, and sure enough, Steve is getting hard again already. His knot hasn't even gone down and he's hardening, and Tony's mouth waters, his ass gets even wetter, because he knows it's going to be soon, that Steve will fuck him again.
"Your highness."
"So I had an interesting visit in my office this morning," Bruce begins, looking mildly uncomfortable. Of course, 'mildly uncomfortable' is Bruce's default state, so Steve doesn't think too much of it. "From Ms. Potts, the prince's valet?"
Steve growls triumphantly, rolling them to the side and hitching one of Tony's legs up so he can fuck into the Omega's body more deeply.
"I remember," Tony murmurs, and Steve hates the little flash of hurt in his eyes, wonders how he'd missed it the first time.
Tony blushes again. "I don't mind," he says quietly, then adds a moment later, "Steve."
There were rumours that he was the recipient of some magical elixir that had made him immortal, 10 feet tall, then made his cock so big no Omega could take his knot.
"They didn't get a word out of him," Natasha continues. "Honestly, I thought Clint would have done better."
The young man dips into a shallow bow, the red silk of his shirt shining in the low light. His eyes fall to the floor, submissive and deferential.
"Not right now," Tony says. "Maybe in a little while."
Steve stares at the doorway for a long time.
Tony cries out, but so does Steve. He sinks in to the hilt, keeping his eyes on Tony's face for any signs of discomfort. Tony blinks up at him.
"But we just –"
"What do you
"I don't need a babysitter," Tony says petulantly as she brings the two cups back to the table, setting one in front of Tony. She sits back down and stirs her own tea lightly with a spoon, and Tony thinks it might be entirely calculated, because he doesn't think she added anything to her tea besides water.
"I was fine. I… talked to Natasha. A little. It was fine."
"What do you mean?"
All Tony
, not if the presenter doesn't
"My love, my Omega, mine," Steve murmurs into the back of Tony's neck, both of them twitching with aftershocks. "I love you."
. He's fully aware of how soon they'll be in America. How soon he'll be face to face with his new Alpha.
Eugh. God, he'd hated school.
know that. But he doesn't know that. You gotta
Steve raises an eyebrow. "Well, what did you hear?"
And a bondless Consort? He'd be relegated to the streets in no time, nothing for him to do about it but beg for scraps in bad neighbourhoods.
He crawls into bed without cleaning his teeth or anything else, burrowing under the blankets. He wants to hide, to die of shame.
His thoughts are interrupted when Natasha comes into the drawing room. She's been away on a scouting mission through some of the more isolated villages on the outskirts of the province, both to keep an eye out for Chitauri or other enemies, and to check in with the communities to see what aid they require from their lord.
He gives up Steve's mouth, though he can't help but nip at the full, swollen bottom lip with his teeth as he lets go. Steve groans and lifts his head, chasing Tony's lips, but Tony kisses his way down Steve's neck, across his chest. He pauses there, peppering kisses across the broad, muscular chest, sipping and lipping at Steve's nipples. Steve pushes his hips up, grinds his cock against Tony's thigh, but he keeps his hands on the bed to allow Tony to control everything happening. Tony rewards him by moving lower, licking and sucking his way across the ridges of Steve's muscles, down to the V of muscle that leads to his cock.
"You're stunning," Steve breathes, hands clenched tight around Tony's hips to help him lift and drop. "Gorgeous."
Steve's eyes look sad for a moment. "I don't want that to be your life," he says quietly. "I don't want you to feel like you can't say something to me, okay? We're bondmates now. I'd like if, maybe, we could even be friends. If you have something you want to say, I want you to feel comfortable saying it." Steve holds up a hand to forestall Tony's protest, though Tony's not sure what would have come out of his mouth anyway. "Maybe not yet, I'll understand if you need time. But one day, and hopefully soon, I hope you'll feel like you can do that with me."
"And there were rumours of your – well, I mean–" Tony blushes dark red, casting his eyes down to his plate. "That's about it," he finishes lamely.
Tony rolls his eyes. "Hardly overly perceptive," he says.
Steve studies him for a moment, as though he could see what Tony had talked to Natasha about – her past, suppressants, what it's like being an Omega in America – on Tony's face. And for all Tony knows, maybe Steve can. "I'm glad. I thought you two might get along."
"Yeah," Steve sighs, still staring down at him. "You are. You're beautiful."
He'd worked out fairly quickly how much of an insult Anthony is to Steve, but he's yet to figure out why King Howard would make
," Tony cries, hands grabbing desperately at Steve's biceps. "Steve!"
"Well, the poison oak is basically everything else," Tony says with a light laugh. Steve's smile widens, and Tony bites his lower lip to try and tamp down his own smile.
before," he says. "It's a heat. A bonding. A knotting. And, god, Nat, you should have seen him this afternoon. He's so… I've never met anyone like him. He's brilliant, but he has no idea how beautiful he is."
"Your cock is huge," Tony laughs, breathless. "I'd heard stories, and I've had it in me before, but Jesus."
"Steve, god, Steve," he whimpers, burying his face in the blankets on the bed.
"Tony, I'm not going to punish you," Steve says, testing a theory.
Tony convulses almost immediately, his whole body seizing and shaking, jerking under Steve's. It's amazing and beautiful and the most erotic thing Steve has ever seen, the deep, full-body orgasm Tony can have on his knot. He'd thought the first time might have been a one-off, but to have it happen again is thrilling, and Steve wonders if Tony will come on his knot like this all the time, if Tony will let Steve fuck him like this even after his heat.
"Hello." Tony's at the door, looking soft and beautiful. He's dressed down as compared to the day before, though he looks a little flustered. "It's good to see you, my lord."
Tony's cock swells with it, and he'd thought he couldn't possibly, thought he'd been spent and exhausted, that there could be no more arousal or desire for him, but he'd clearly been wrong.
He knows part of it is that he's coming close to his heat.
Bucky reaches out and brushes a hand over Clint's head, gently, but it seems to be out of reflex because his eyes are still dancing, his grin wide. "Omegas are rare, right?" he explains. "But they also don't come with a whole lot of benefits for a family – they gotta come up with dowries, find an Alpha or Beta of good standing to take their kid on and bond them, the whole deal. So some parents who don't want to have to deal with all that, they just send their Omega kids to this special school out in East Starkland so they can learn to be sex slaves."
"I told you, it doesn't matter that you're an Omega. No one here knows how to build aqueducts, or how to keep water basins heated all day. No one but you. Being an Omega won't stop you, here. If you have the manpower and the tools, would you be able to build it?"
"Yes, the staff has been great," Tony says. "I haven't met many of the townspeople, but I hope to in the coming weeks."
"So you'll be consummating in your rooms, then?" Bucky says slyly.
Bucky nods, taking another large bite of the raspberry cream pastry. "You're right, that would be stupid. Okay, tell you what – I'll eat all the pastries, and if I don't die you'll know they weren't poisoned."
. He's not a piece of
"Only mine," Steve agrees, and he's rolling Tony over, hitching his hips up so Tony is on his hands and knees, presenting properly, the way he'd been taught, and Tony shifts his legs apart, shows off his hole, knowing it's wet and open and begging to be filled.
"Lord Steven," Wilson grins. "We don't really stand on formality around here – at least not with those of us who knew him during the war."
And somehow Rhodey had managed to figure out the most terrifying thing about this whole situation, and decided not to pull any punches in letting Tony know it. Because that really
"Please," Tony whines, shaking his head. "Please, please, Steve, it's too much."
"Bruce. You told her it was unnecessary." He doesn't even make it a question this time.
"It does say that," Steve says, still stupidly.
what to expect. And he hadn't been able to bring himself to ask about Steve's knot, because how exactly do you bring that up over dinner with your new bondmate? "Oh, hey, I heard the potion you took made your knot the size of my head can you not shove it in me please?"
He shoves the thought away, unable to deal with the possibility that Tony's heat is the only reason Tony would be in Steve's bed. It's true, at least, that his heat is the reason Tony had
Steve feels like he could be sick. He hadn't really thought about the implications of agreeing to a Consort from the kingdom. He hadn't given any thought to the person on the other end of the bonding contracts.
"Fucking — harder," Tony says, pushing his hips back to meet Steve's thrusts, and Steve obliges, his big, thick cock and his half-swollen knot stretching Tony, opening him wide and he knows if Steve pulled out, his hole would gape, he would feel so empty, and he wants Steve to stay in him forever, always.
you want?" Tony asks, his voice impossibly quiet. Timid.
"You know you can't say stuff like this when the Consort gets here, right?" Steve says, making it more of an order than a question. "I won't have you making them uncomfortable with this kind of talk."
"Did he?" Barnes' face is implacable.
him, with no regard for his own dreams or desires."
A thought shoves its way into his mind. "You said it wasn't about the aqueducts. Steve giving me… this."
be in Starkland."
"Maybe I'm not," Steve tells him. Tony blinks at him, eyes wide.
"I would love to," the prince says, taking a deep breath. He flicks a small smile up toward Steve and Steve feels his heart pound at the beauty of it. He needs to see it again, and he resolves himself to finding ways to make Prince Anthony smile as frequently as possible.
Natasha opens the door with a sweet smile.
"I really don't care," Steve tells him, then heads down the hall back toward his office.
Some of the outer provinces apparently had more relaxed laws about Omega rights. As in, apparently sometimes Omegas
He longs for home. He'd hated home, but at least he'd known what to
But now Steve's gone, and Tony's here alone.
+++++
Steve leads him into the dining room and pulls out a chair for him, tucking it in as Prince Anthony sits down. He takes a deep breath, then goes around to the other side of the table to find his own seat. It's a smaller table, but there's still quite a bit of space between the two of them.
"But I'm gonna have to get used to it, first," Tony says, and with a wink he crawls onto his knees between Steve's feet, wraps his beautiful, graceful hand around Steve's erection, and leans forward to let the head of it slip between his plush, slick, pink lips.
"I'm ready," he says, and so Steve pushes forward, feeling the release, feeling Tony's body open and accept him and take him all the way in.
, he's been building weapons," Bucky said, crossing his arms smugly. "Weapons like Clint has never even
"At the very least," Steve says, voice low, "I'd like for us to try to be friends?"
Steve blinks. "What?"
But how could he not? The idea, even the
"Here, Tony," Pepper says, pulling a small jar of preserves from her cloaks. "This will settle your nerves."
Tony stares at it. Alstroemeria means friendship. Respect and trust.
Tony sighs. "Fine.
Tony claws at the bedding, breath coming in huge sobs now.
His cheeks grow hot, and Pepper's smile grows as though she can read his mind and pick out exactly which thought had made him blush.
When they get to the end of the row, Steve is smiling again.
"It's probably intensified by your heat, Tony. Not that I'm not happy to hear about you wanting me – feel free to repeat that."
"Nothing – nothing special, really," Prince Anthony says. His eyes take on a panicked look. "I don't – what do
," he reminds her. "Don't forget that part, I think it might be the deciding factor in all this. Not just anyone is accepted to the Academy, you know. And I probably would have flunked out years ago if my father wasn't the king."
Tony wakes up slowly. The light filters in from a gap in the draperies, showing off an entirely too sunny spring day.
"I was," Steve agrees. "I went to the front, put together a team, and we fought our way into Hydra's castle and defeated the Red Skull."
He doesn't sleep, though. After a few hours, he rises, heads for the trunk at the foot of his bed. He finds charcoals and paper, and he begins sketching.
"This is me making a choice," he tells them. "A choice about how everyone else's life is going to go after this."
?" Steve asks, keeping his voice hushed.
Tony rolls his eyes. "You might as well call me 'Tony'," he says, frowning. He's kept most of Steve's friends treating him more formally than that, and he's not entirely sure why he's not doing the same with Natasha. Maybe it's the way she's made herself at home. Or the way she's managing to disrespect all his personal space boundaries while still managing to be quite respectful.
G5 - SIZE KINK - TONY STARK
"So they taught us some other skills. I… made use of those skills, to get out."
Tony sits up, pulling away from Steve – which is wrong and horrible – and lets the sheets pool around his middle. He stares at the blankets, folding his hands together tightly, and refuses to make eye contact. "That was rude of me, my lord. I'm sorry."
“I suppose you’re finally out of ideas?” Thor asked.
“Actually, my friend, it’s—” But the guy already left. “It’s, Thor.”
“You broke the mirror,” Tony countered, then paused to have a short look around the room, “And also the wall behind it, but hey, silver lining, at least we can have the peephole that Clint’s been wanting." He pointed at the front door.
Clint frowned,
“I do not agree with that statement,” he said.
“What exactly is this place?” The man asked. “Is this a dorm or something? Because I don’t think this is an apartment or a boarding house.”
Bruce was silent, but his breathing was ragged, it’s like all of his pent up energy’s finally gone and he was left with nothing but emptiness. “What are you, my therapist?” He asked Natasha, to Steve’s surprised, in a mocking voice. “Who are you guys for me to tell you? We just live in the same building, we’re not friends, we’re nothing but strangers.”
“Bruce,” Natasha said, which seem to snap the guy’s attention.
Tony stared at him, then shrugged. It was obvious the guy needs a few lessons with lying, but Tony couldn’t really care. Steve’s business is his business. “There’s this thing called exaggeration, our generation tends to use that.”
Nope, Steve's a mess and he needs to start picking himself up.
She likes it when she’s right.
Bruce was the last to come, and he looked like he was going to drop dead any minute. But as soon as his eyes landed on the group of people huddled in front of the Television, Bruce snorted and made himself comfortable next to Steve on the floor.
Clint sighed. “Listen, dude,” he said. “I don’t know you, and I could barely buy my own food these days.” Because apparently, what they say with burning through your money in you teenage years was like throwing away a condom,  was quiet true. “So wherever you got that big ass idea that I’ll go buy you a hotdog with a glare that could probably kill a rabbit, never go back there again.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The older man winced, “I honestly have no idea,” he said. “I just inherited this place, and no one wanted to buy it from me so I used it instead.”
“Shut up,” Clint immediately said. “So, the thing is, one’s a god, one wears an armor that could rival any weapon, another is the peak of human perfection, one is a shape shifter who could turn into a monster when angry, and an assassin that was trained when young.”
Bruce blinked when the stranger just turned to look at him unfazed—though the dark surroundings weren’t helping.
He glanced around his surroundings and realized that he knew this part of the city. He took a different route, knowing that he’ll end up colliding with the kid at the intersection.
. It was… good."
"I know you said you weren't hungry," Steve says. "But I wanted a snack. Help yourself."
"But it's permanent?"
"Right now," Steve says, voice sad. "I have to go right now."
He can feel the irritation, the warmth of it prickling under his skin like an itch. His body is preparing itself for heat by making him moody and overly hot, which is quite frankly just a little over the top, he decides. Isn't it bad enough that, as a male Omega, he has no property rights, no bonding rights, and no reproductive capabilities? He has to have mood swings and uncontrollable sexual desire on top of it?
Natasha moves out into the hallway with Ms. Potts, then closes the door, leaving Steve alone with Tony.
want to sleep with me."
Tony grimaces a little. Tries to imagine what it had been like.
There's a plate of pastries on the bedside table, and — more importantly — a pitcher of what smells like coffee, which is still warm.
"Good, because whatever it is, I've heard it."
Steve paces around the room again, moves the wine bottle to a different spot on the table. It shouldn't be so close to the edge, it might fall.
Steve uses his fingers and his tongue to work Tony open, licking and thrusting and sliding in and out. He pushes in, deeply, with his fingers, rubs the pads of his fingers over Tony's prostate, and Tony howls, his whole body bowing on the bed. Steve can feel his balls and cock pulsing, feel the hot dampness of Tony's come hit the inside of the lace where he's still covered. Tony writhes, his hole clenching around Steve's fingers, and the sudden rush of slick coats Steve's lips and chin. He licks it up messily, revelling in the taste of Tony's obvious pleasure.
At the same time, he can't help but wonder… will Steve like him? Will Steve, maybe, find him attractive?
"Yeah," Tony gasps. "It's – it's intense, but I'm okay."
But this year, the harvest had been so poor, and the winter so far has been hard. He hadn't wanted to do it, but Steve had known that he would have to seek help from King Howard in order to keep his people alive.
It's enough to make Steve's cock throb inside him, more come spurting in, and Steve's balls pulse as he empties himself again. Tony cries and cries until the aftershocks start to settle, and he lies bonelessly under Steve. His body shivers from time to time, but he's barely conscious.
Steve watches as, inch by inch, the tanned V of Tony's chest is put on display for him. When he gets to the bottom, he shrugs the shirt off, and Steve's cock jerks in his pants, throat going dry.
"–It's not the middle, Pepper, I finished my heat, he's a lord and he has important things to do–"
"Good," Steve says, tearing his eyes away. He cuts off a substantially larger piece of meat for himself, thrusting it into his mouth before he can say anything else inane.
"Careful, doll, Steve's 80 per cent convinced they're poisoned," Bucky tells him.
Tony swallows, cheeks flushed red.
He arrives at Prince Anthony's bedroom door, and takes a deep, fortifying breath before he reaches up for the heavy iron knocker and announces his presence.
"–Did something happen to him? Did you say something? Why would he leave–"
"That's good," Steve says, wondering if he can jump through that window at the end of the hallway and survive the landing. He gives his head a small shake, then remembers his manners. "I trust you had a comfortable journey?"
"Not much," he admits. "It's Anthony Stark."
," Tony says.
"Anything," Steve promises him, claiming Tony's mouth again.
"I know," Steve sighs. "I know, it's fine. Just let me –" Steve stands and turns around, coming face to face with Tony, who's standing in the bedroom door.
Tony continues to blink, no less confused. "I don't understand."
Which, he supposes, means at least one of the service staff must have seen him and sent for her.
, really dense."
Steve reaches forward and helps him peel it down his body, helps him work it down his hips, his legs, and all the way off. Steve's eyes roam hungrily over Tony's nudity, gazing at every inch of bare skin. Tony's pretty cock is half-hard again, his ass freshly slick. Steve lays them down, covering Tony's body with his and settling between his legs. He lines their cocks up together, rocking his hips slightly. Not enough to get either of them off, just enough to tantalize. He kisses Tony, slow and deep, then trails kisses all over his cheeks and jaw.
He knows he's just nervous. He's nervous about the conversation, about saying the right thing – about
Like he was some kind of pet to be taken care of.
"I learned a lot about the world when I was at the academy," Tony says, looking down at the cobblestone path. "Some of it more useful than others."
"Oh," Tony says, and Steve can hear the underlying, unspoken questions.
Steve chuckles, pride and lust pooling low in his belly, and Tony's cheeks turn scarlet at the admission.
"He's been very kind," Tony admits.
"Exactly," Steve growls, surging to his feet and capturing Tony's mouth again. He keeps his hands on Tony's sweet rear, pulling them together so their groins grind together. Tony is just as hard as Steve is, and suddenly Steve wants all the fabric out of the way. He lifts Tony up by the hips, and Tony's legs automatically wind around Steve's waist. He's light enough, and Steve is strong enough, that Steve can carry him that way, so he does, moving across the room toward the bed. It's huge, dressed in soft grey fabrics. Steve keeps kissing him as they walk, letting Tony writhe in his arms, rolling his hips and grinding his cock against Steve, until they reach the bed.
Tony to be nervous. He wants Tony to be comfortable, and happy, and safe.
"The Alphas and Betas brought their chitauri scout home with them," she says with a little eyeroll. He can tell, she's trying to put him at ease by grouping the two of them together, as Omegas, as unspoken as it is. He's ashamed to admit that it does help. He does feel more at ease with Natasha than with anyone else around here. He's used to spending time with Omegas, after all. It's the rest of them he barely has a handle on. "They questioned him for days out at the border."
"Of course," he says, taking his tea cup back into his hand and sipping from it. It tastes like ash. He gulps it down, then – blatantly ignoring good manners – reaches out to take hers. It's only half-drunk, but he takes the two cups and stands up from the chair. "I'm quite tired, Natasha. I should head to bed."
Tony looks at his glass for a moment, before glancing back up to Steve. "Should we toast to something?"
She grins. "He's gonna love it," she says.
what it is, I don't know why you gotta make him explain it."
She leaves Tony alone with his thoughts then, by himself in the coach. It's only mildly warmer than outside, so he wraps the furs and blankets around him more snugly.
"You know, I never wanted to be a lord." Steve flops down on his armchair in the drawing room, suddenly overcome with a feeling of petulance about the entire thing.
"Am I?" Tony asks, arching an eyebrow before catching himself and staring back down at the table.
"I fought my way out," she shrugs. "They'd decided on an experiment. You see, the Krasnyy sex slaves are a highly sought-after commodity, among Alphas in countries with no moral compass. Or, I suppose, among Alphas that can get away with it. The government wanted to find out what would happen if they trained their whores as double agents – to get them into the bed of a high-ranking Alpha somewhere and have them steal secrets or assassinate their enemies."
"I'd like that," he says. "We can go now, if you want."
The possessiveness slams into his chest, and he growls, biting into the soft, tender skin of Tony's lower belly, teeth digging into lace, before soothing it with his tongue.
"Like what, Tony?"
Pepper blinks at him for a moment. "Gone?" she asks, face paling. "Tony, what do you mean, he's gone–"
"Your highness," Steve's friend – he'd called him Bucky? But that can't be right – bows slightly, then stands and peers at Tony. His gaze is sharp, interested, and searching. Like he's trying to see through Tony into the very core of him.
"Show me," Steve says, pulling away and standing over the bed again. He takes a step back to give Tony more space, manages to pull his hands away from that skin. "Show me what's mine."
Buff men, you see, get me panting over
"That's nice, Tony, but–"
"Is sex on the list?" Bucky asks slyly. Steve's cheeks heat, but he nods.
He can wait for his own pleasure, if the trade off is seeing the look in Steve's eye, right now. Naked want and desire and surprise, like he hadn't expected Tony to do that for him, hadn't expected Tony to give him that.
The rest of the trip is hard and boring and, yes, cold. They make their way around the mountains and through the swamplands. By the time they get through to where the farming villages and towns begin, Tony has gone through almost all the books he'd brought along for the trip. He has more in his trunks, of course – science and math and engineering texts that he'd had Rhodey procure for him in secret because, of
Anthony had been 15 at the time, and King Howard had sent him to boarding school away from home.
"Let me love you," Steve says, gripping Tony and holding him still, catching his eye, and he's serious, he's gentle and loving and he wants to love Tony.
"I just don't want him to feel like I
It's slower this time, but no less heated. With Tony above him the scent of his arousal in the air, Steve can't think of anything else. His tongue licks into Tony's mouth, and Tony reaches back behind himself to take hold of Steve's hard cock.
"I'm not going to hurt him," Steve says, and it comes out more fiercely than he'd meant it to. "I'm never going to hurt him."
God, he's terrified of that. He knows what to expect but he doesn't
"It's not
"I… enjoy reading as well," Prince Anthony says, looking as uncomfortable as Steve feels. "I'm afraid I don't have a lot of practice at running, my lord, but I could –"
Tony almost spills his tea over his lap. "What? Does Steve know?"
Wilson gives him a look. "We take security very seriously here. I take it you're Prince Anthony's bodyguard? We received a note saying he would be coming with a small staff."
nervous.
"Great," Steve says.
Doesn't want Tony.
Tony throws his head back, crying out and coming, spurting between them even as he clenches and squeezes Steve's cock. Steve growls, wrapping his big hands around Tony's narrow hips, and pulls him down harder, grinds Tony into his lap and onto his cock, groaning deep and low in his throat as his knot swells, as his cock pulses and he comes, spurting his seed into Tony's wet, shivering body.
"Well, growing up in the royal family can be hard," she tells him. "You're in the public eye all the time during your formative years. It has to be even harder when you're an Omega, and when there are no other heirs to the throne."
"That's not at all contradictory," Steve says, sarcasm dripping through.
, so he lets it stand.
. Do you think
"He seemed terrified of you because he
"That… elixir you were given. Did it make your skin impenetrable or something?"
Steve holds his arm out before he can stop himself, and after a bare moment's hesitation, Prince Anthony steps forward and slips his hand into the crook of Steve's elbow.
"It doesn't matter what you want," she interrupts him. "What matters is that Anthony will be coming here under duress. That's a choice you made for him, that he would be bonded forever to an Alpha he's never met."
"So, I asked the kitchen to roast some elk for us, if that's okay?"
He works until the small hours of the morning, and then he finally falls into a dreamless sleep.
, christ, and you don't have to do it if you don't want to."
Bucky pinched the bridge of his nose. "Jesus save me," he muttered. He took a deep breath and turned back to Steve. "I'm going to spell this out for you as easily as I can, I know the big words can be hard for you some days."
"Don't move, honey," Steve says, doing his best to hold his own hips still. "Give yourself a minute, get used to it, okay?"
She laughs. "You'll be fine, Tony. Lord Steven seems sweet."
"You're stunning," Steve tells him. "And you're
Bucky smiled at him. "Well, your lordship, Clint's been keeping an eye on your boy for you."
there had been a false alarm the night before. And the night before that. But now, Tony's sure. He feels a cramp low in his belly, a barely-there moisture in his crack as his hole starts to slick. He feels hot and feverish, distracted and floaty.
"I told you," Steve says, lips brushing against Tony's skin and the lace as he talks, "I wanted to make you feel good. Does this feel good?"
"Have Sam send it with Redwing," Steve says, rubbing a hand over his face tiredly. "I want it there as soon as possible, and Redwing moves faster than any of the ravens. We need things to move quickly, now."
"So, you think you could get more from him? The scout?"
Tony turns to Pepper, eyes wide. "I have been on the road for two weeks, Pep, I need a bath more than I need
"I just wanted to tell you that," he says lamely, gesturing toward the door. "I'll… get out of your hair."
He reaches for a pen and signs his full name on the line.
She gives him an unimpressed look. "I just came from there. He was moping, so I didn't stay after I told him what I'd learned."
with him–"
Tony wails, whole body bowing and tightening as he comes, and that's enough to push Steve over, too – he shoves forward, grinding his hips into Tony's plump ass, burying his cock deep inside him. His knot swells, stretching Tony's hole open and eliciting a wail of pleasure and triumph from both of them.
"I see," Tony says, eyes shuttering.
"Course it is," Tony grins, leaning down to peck at Steve's lip. "Told you they'd work."
Steve wants to
Tony cries out, keening as Steve fucks him, and Steve can watch his body ratchet higher and higher, tensing as he gets closer and closer to coming.
Tony stares at him, flabbergasted. Steve is panting by now, heart pounding as he pours all his emotion out on the table between them, hoping it's not too much, hoping Tony will feel even a little bit the same.
Actually, the whole crowd seems disinterested, and Dr. Banner speaks as quickly and as quietly as possible, looking nervous and uncomfortable, and then… it's over. Banner is walking down the steps in the square, off the raised area, and Tony, with nothing better to do, follows after him, blinking.
. It's what he's been taught to say, what he's been trained, and that's not what Steve wants. It's probably a defense mechanism – if Tony is feeling unsure, he'll fall back on those habits, that training, but Steve doesn't want Tony's training. He wants
"Have the exam?" Steve says.
He feels another rush of hatred and anger for his father. He hates the whole situation, the process of it all.
Tony ignores that. "So how can they be preparing for a war without planning one?"
The only thing Steve can think of is that Anthony's lineage is to blame – Any other Omega, in the event of Steve's untimely death, would then go back to belonging to their own family. That could give that Omega's Alpha father grounds to challenge for the inheritance of reign over America. Sending Anthony, King Howard's only offspring, all but guarantees that America will revert back to King Howard.
"I'm… I'm good," Tony says, and it's an honest answer. Steve lets his thumb slide back and forth on Tony's skin where his arm is wrapped around his waist.
"I mean, I, uh, I have a pretty high metabolism, so I tend to eat a lot? But, well, there'll be plenty, so you don't have to worry about that." God, could he sound like any more of an idiot?
you appreciate it."
"He's a prince, Nat."
been thinking about running, even though his thighs had tensed, his breathing sped up as though he'd been getting ready for it. "You can do this. You're strong, and smart, and he's gonna love you."
The light teasing manages to cover half the distance to the palace, and when Tony looks up again he can almost make out the features of the bustling townspeople waiting at the gate to welcome the weary travellers.
"So, are you finding everything to your liking?" Barnes asks, jumping back into the conversation. "Need anything? Everyone's treating you okay?"
Tony moans as Steve's gentle fingers press at his hole, slipping in slowly. Steve pumps his hand a few times, lips sucking at the lobe of Tony's ear, and Tony can feel Steve's cock hardening, thickening and lengthening at the small of Tony's back. He whines, tries to bend forward to present, but Steve just keeps touching him, fingering him and kissing his ear, his neck.
"Yes, love, again," Steve says, and his voice is warm, proud, kind, but his hand is cruel, taking Tony past the limit, past what feels good until it's too much, too sensitive, and then Tony comes again, crying out and jerking helplessly in the water, while Steve fucks him with his big, sure fingers.
going to punish you," Steve tells him, putting some of that royal command in his voice. He doesn't bring it out very often, but he's done arguing about this, and they've barely even started. "I am
"What would you ever do without me?" She says, laughing prettily. "I'm not even sure you could put on your own waistcoat without me."
Tony smiles at him, then, and it's warm. "Steve, then. How may I be of service?"
Tony's head jerks back slightly. "I'm not afraid of you."
"Not — oh — not in heat," Tony says, arching his back and pushing into Steve's clever hand. He'd never imagined an Alpha being so interested in Tony's pleasure, in touching Tony and stroking his cock and watching him fall apart. He'd expected an Alpha who would use him, fuck his ass and knot him at his own leisure, but Steve had upended every expectation Tony had come here with. "Just want you."
At least Sam's less likely to tease him for his absolute uselessness when it comes to wooing a guy who is already
"That's good," Tony says, at a loss. He has questions, but he can't ask them. "That he's kind to you."
"And that's the fucking
"It is literally anything but
Steve waits in the hallway, fingers drumming nervously on his thigh.
He slides the hand still on Tony's waist up his chest, tweaking a nipple through the fabric of his shirt on his way up to Tony's throat. He slips two fingers into the neckline of the shirt, thumbing the top button idly as he keeps a firm grip on Tony's hair, holding him immobile.
"It feels so good, honey," Steve whispers against his lips. "You feel so good. I need you, sweetheart. Tony, I need to feel you."
. She'd come here to tease the hell out of him.
"Mmm," Tony says, answering with another little wiggle of his hips.
"Why are you here, Natasha?" he asks her again. She hadn't answered him the first time, only told him he'd chosen the wrong shirt and made him go change, then she'd mussed his hair up a little. He'd had to take a minute to smooth it out again.
"I thought – God, Steve – I thought you were trying to – you didn't ask for me," Tony gasps.
Tony reaches for them, but he stops himself before he can actually touch them.
Steve. And those nights he was in heat, when Steve worshipped and ravaged his body in turns – that would be a thing of the past. Tony would be nothing but a disappointment.
"Tony. I hope you're well?"
"Please, Steve, please," he whines, grinding down. "I need – I need you – please."
Steve grins. "So which is the poison oak?"
"Six-two, but thank you," Steve smiles.
"I have Pepper and Rhodey," Tony says, mildly affronted on their behalf. "He's been my bodyguard for years."
Steve laughs breathlessly, pressing light kisses to whatever parts of Tony's skin he can reach. "Rest, sweetheart," he whispers against Tony's damp skin. "Rest, and when you wake up we'll have a bath and eat."
Tony reaches for one of Steve's hands, takes it and places it on the back of his head, bobbing earnestly.
"They've built pipes and basins, to bring water from the river into the populated parts of the kingdom. Cities, towns. They have valve systems so you never have to carry water – the aqueducts do it for you!" As Tony speaks, he seems to warm up to the topic, and the anxious tightness in his muscles relaxes. He starts to move his hands in the air in front of him, gesturing as he talks.
Tony sucks his bottom lip in between his teeth and worries at it for a moment. "I do," he says, finally, voice barely above a whisper. "I do want you."
"Sure, but do you think that's the first time he ever thought of the Alpha he was going to be bonded to? You gotta remember, Steve, he spent years at that Consort academy. He's been training for this, learning how to be what you want from him. But think about it – they don't know what Alpha someone's gonna be sent to, so they have to cover all their bases."
"He told me to call him 'Tony,'" he finally says. "He said – he said I could call him Tony. Instead of Prince Anthony."
