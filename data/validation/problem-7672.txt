It was a long, cheerful evening and one of a kind engagement party.
" - I am the Captain of the Avengers! When I swing my shield, no crook can feel safe!"
Or...
"What? You think I went through all this trouble and won't even taste it?" Tony laughed, seeing Steve's surprised face. "Besides, it is romantic to share a milkshake like that, don't you think?"
“Arrow?” Steve repeated, not able to contain his surprise. Seeing drag queens out of drag was a whole new experience.
“Stevie?”
Steve laughed and nodded, agreeing, not imagining anyone else in that role. Sam could do some amazing things and uniquely combine flavors. There was no one better for the job.
“Tadaam!” Red Velvet smiled, looking at Steve in the mirror. “This is how I start my drag. I like to do it at the beginning, it keeps hair in place while doing makeup,” she said, running a hand over the cap as if checking if it sat right.
"What?" Tony continued laughing, somehow oblivious to his own attractiveness. "Nah. He is just doing his job."
“I am not,” came from behind the room divider. “I am bisexual.”
Steve frowned, of course, knowing that. “But it is just 3 pm,” he said, not wanting Tony to leave yet. The show was supposed to start in six hours.
"I guess you will be switching schools now?" Steve asked sadly. He would understand if the traumatic events would make him want to leave, but Steve would still miss him.
"Well, you're squeezing my arm kinda hard. And you squeak."
Steve nodded, silently chewing on the piece of meat. Since his dad died, years ago, he saw his mom closing in, struggling to find a place for herself. If a bit of makeup was what she needed to feel better, Steve supported that wholeheartedly.
Steve read the text, feeling that he might know the author.
“You know what.”
"Pshhh. What?" Tony snorted in humor, but his face changed when he saw how alarmed Steve looked. "I don't know. I don't think so? But we don't exactly have anyone else to compare, you're one of a kind," Tony smiled kinder.
"Oh, right!" she said, suddenly remembering that the time was passing and her shift would soon start. "Hey, come to my bar, we will talk some more. And we could meet one day and catch up. I have to get ready now," she reached her hand for the aloe and Red Velvet tossed it to her. "Thanks! I will see you both later!"
“Hmmm,” Steve hummed in understanding, waiting for Tony to continue, but he didn’t say anything more. Tony had no problems with voicing out his needs on his site, but face to face with Steve, he was fumbling and struggling for words. Anonymity gave him a sense of control which was being stripped away from him, layer by layer. Maybe with time, Tony would open more, and it was on Steve’s side to nurture that vulnerable mindset until Tony would feel strong enough and confident to voice out his true needs.
Dating Tony was great. Each day, Steve felt more and more in love with the quirky brunet, enjoying both the female and male sides of his boyfriend. It was exciting and refreshing and so different from the previous relationship Steve's had. Of course, it wasn't all sweet, and sometimes they had some disagreements, but always found a way back to each other, and it just made the bond between them stronger. Their dating time wasn't that long, but Steve already felt that Tony was the one for him and by the way Tony smiled at him, touched him, slept curled into him, he could feel that Tony thought the same about him. It was a good, mature and honest relationship. There wasn't a thing he would be afraid to tell Tony. He was an open book.
"Um, yeah, but I met Bucky a few weeks ago. He is back in town."
Tony eyed his set with amusement. “Oh, an old-school journalist,” he laughed gently, leaning into his seat, and Steve couldn’t see it, but by the movement, he was sure that Tony crossed his legs for a more comfortable position. “I don’t see that often anymore.”
"Hey, I will be going," Steve said, taking Red by the elbow and interrupting the discussion over a fashion magazine and material samples about if Red could pull off a dress with an open leg or not.
“Ahhh, not sure if I want to give you access to that sort of power,” Tony teased, opening the app. “Huh, people kinda hate you.”
Sarah arrived about ten minutes earlier than Steve asked her to, firm in her belief that it was better to be a bit earlier and wait instead of being late and making someone wait for her, a view she successfully passed to her only son. That's why she expected Steve to already wait for her and she really wished he did, not understanding why her son asked her to come. Sarah looked from her phone to the brightly shining neon, unsure if Steve gave her the correct address. The name was the same, but the reality didn't match her expectations. The Pitted Olive in her head was a name suitable for an Italian restaurant and not for something that looked like a night cocktail bar. Besides, her son didn't drink a lot of alcohol and was more of a beer guy than a cocktail person, so why he invited her to a bar and sounded so urgent about it?
"Um, pops, I just -"
All you. Steve swallowed thickly again. He reached for one of the pillows on the sofa and hugged it close to himself.
"Eh," Peter whined in disappointment, leaning over the door frame, longingly looking at the ceiling and imagining the pterodactyl circling around it. That would be quite a sight.
Wearing Steve's Captain America suit, swinging a toy replica of Steve's shield, was Peter. The suit hung on his smaller frame, but it wasn't enough of a hint and Peter still wrapped himself in it, doing an impression of Steve on the battlefield, poorly flailing the toy shield around in front of Ned and MJ, who was basically dying from laughter.
"Then how about I call you my lady?"
"Full body," Red repeated with a wide smile. This time, Steve felt that his blush went all the way down to his toes. Full body was a whole lot of smooth skin.
more surprises! let me know if you guessed correctly Arrow's and Tootsie's identities. hope you like this chapter!
"We have our own plans! And the walls are pretty thin, so keep the gross stuff to the minimum!" Bucky added.
“Wha— how did you know?!” Steve asked, minimally leaning his head away and that made her stop again.
Steve sighed heavily, hearing more noises, Peter's outraged voice and Tony's louder one. Soon it became ridiculous and he chuckled to himself.
A month after this event, Steve finally saw the first commercial. It started like all Avengers related commercial, with Hulk first busting the wall, then the rest of the Avengers following, until they all were gone, and then, after it was clear, a cartoon Figaro jumped out through the wall, and trotted to the camera, looking into it, and pawing at the picture. Steve smiled. It was cute. And then they showed the plushies, all in different Avengers suits, and school supplies, and an abundance of colorful t-shirts, as not all clothes items made it to the production line, or maybe Tony was saving them for later. A sign "
“I think both will look great on you,” Steve said, and Tony almost whooped in excitement, pleased that Steve walked into such an obvious trap, “but you usually wear sparkling materials, so it is better to go with a matte finish, to not overpower the dress. And the rose color will go better with your skin tone, than the cherry one.”
“Pardon?” Tony asked, his voice sounding a bit cold.
Tony gulped down the coffee and reached for the water. “Go ahead.”
“I am taking you out for a very late dinner,” he said with a charming smile, pulling Red Velvet to a sitting position. “I can’t allow my lady to be hungry.”
"Mhm," Tony hummed contentedly, turning to better face Steve and wrapped hands around his, officially, fiancé's neck, pressing their bodies together. That short bathrobe and a ring on Tony's finger - it was everything Steve wanted to see for the rest of his life.
“What?” Steve stared.
For a second, Red Velvet didn’t do anything. She didn’t move away either, which was a good thing, but Steve couldn’t say anything from her eyes. Those beautiful eyes, with icy blue irises, hiding the warmest shade of brown. Steve was torn, not knowing which look he loved more.
(See the end of the chapter for
And he finally got his kiss. Nice.
"Oh my gosh..." Tony shivered, curling closer to Steve's body, when a warm finger started to play between his butt cheeks, testing and finding his opening, circling it. "Hah... HAH!"
On the couch were his parents and at the first sight, it looked like Iron Man and Captain America got into a fight and were wrestling. The truth was very different, and Steve, with the widest grin spread across his face, kept reaching hands forward and grabbing at any part of Tony with tickling fingers, Tony letting out a screech each time the move was successful, guarding himself.
"Tell what?" Tony asked, closing the door, and Steve caught the glimpse of Bucky waving his hand in front of Clint's eyes, trying to get a reaction.
“Shut up, I wanted to make a good first impression,” Tony ducked his head down, feeling embarrassed again.
"Nooo…"
"Hey, so want to go to my place and eat what my mom made?" Steve asked in a playful tone after the kiss ended.
"Good boy," Steve praised, and Tony rolled his eyes dramatically, shutting them close the next second when the finger was back inside him. Moving slow, finding the right places, and soon a second fingers joined, filling him up nicely. Tony curled, whimpering through closed mouth, the feeling of fingers slipping in and out so good.
After a few minutes, Tony came back, holding in his hand a tall glass with a pink milkshake inside.
"You hold still!"
"Something is bothering you," Tony said, reading correctly through his husband, not making it a question, just a statement. He frowned at Steve, not liking the way he sighed and lay down on his back next to Tony, preferring to look at the ceiling than at his lover. "What? Steve?"
"He is in the director's office - with Stone - they got into a fight - as soon as Steve came - he was waiting for him - we have to go!" Bucky decided, taking Tony's wrist and pulling.
"Sorry, coming through! Ooops, watch out with that soda!"
“Hey, Red!”
’ three hardest words ever. The answer had came seconds later and Steve was terrified to look at it, afraid of losing his best friend. None of that happened and Sam kept it short and precise. ’
"Okay, you are in my bakery now, so you either stop being a smartass and I will let you have another roll, or you can get your stuff and go home, you have an evening show," Sam gave Bucky a choice.
"HAH! Ah! Come on! Aaah!"
“Good,” the guy smiled. “Let’s start this again. I am Tony Stark,” he said, extending his hand to Steve and Steve shook it. Softest hands ever. “But I would prefer if you didn’t mention my name.”
"Nicely?!" Steve squeaked out, the pain still prickling his nerve endings. It wasn't an experience he wanted to repeat. How Tony could do it to himself every month?
"What's so funny?" Tony asked in a harsh tone, not understanding what was humorous about this situation.
The second time Steve woke up was not so long after the first time, maybe around 30 minutes later from the first one, and was much more abrupt. Steve smelled smoke. He sat up on the bed straight away, eyes darting around and trying to spot the flickering flame, his mind racing to get to Tony and get him out and alarm the other Avengers.
"Hah... Hah..." Tony let out a long breath, feeling overwhelmed and blissful, and allowing Steve's hands to guide him until he was snuggly pressed to his husband's front. "Mhm," Tony hid his face into Steve's neck, needing a moment to compose himself and enjoying being wrapped in muscled arms he knew so well.
The dinner went surprisingly well. In the beginning, Tony was still tense, but Sarah went out of her way, to make him feel welcomed and accepted, and before the dessert, Tony got back his charisma and chatted with Steve's mom just as easily and comfortably as during their first meeting. And maybe that was the reason why, when Steve was asked to go to the kitchen and get the pastries, he lowered his guard down, and walked back into the living room, almost spitting out the cream puff he had managed to push into his mouth.
“I am fine,” Tony said, not meaning it, his voice coming out squeaky. “Can we - excuse me, I have to go,” Tony rambled out, sending a sorry look in Pepper’s direction and trying to walk out of the conference room as calmly as possible. It felt like the whole world was spinning around him, making him feel nauseous. Tony stumbled to the window and pressed his face against the cool glass, trying to soothe his heated skin and get his thoughts back in order.
"Leave the bike, and get under the car! The engine needs some more tweaks!"
Long story long…
"That's great news," Steve smiled back, knowing that Tony was one of the best students and if someone was able to save the family business and look for new solutions, it was only Tony. "You are one of the top three students at school, right?" he said, teasing the teen just a little bit.
Tony didn’t understand anything. Maybe he clicked and shared something by accident. There was a slight possibility that his account was hacked. Maybe -
Tony sniffled for the last time and lifted the sunglasses a bit to wipe his eyes. “Let’s go back. I have an evening show to get ready for.”
Steve just laughed, leaning back in his chair. His eyes lingered for a while near the table with desserts, where all kids were crowding, taking advantage of the 'make your own milkshake' station. Milkshake did sound good, but Steve checked earlier and sadly noticed that there were no dairy-free options and he didn't want to risk a stomach ache during vacation. It was weird how all of his sicknesses vanished after taking the super-soldier serum, yet somehow he remained lactose intolerant.
"Hah!" Bucky laughed, bringing attention to him. "You know what also has layers? Onions."
Steve was taken by surprise, when a pastrami sandwich and a glass of orange juice appeared in front of him, while the guy received a small cup of strong coffee and a glass of water. The sandwich looked and smelled delicious, with coleslaw and pink pastrami neatly stacked inside on a thin layer of yellow mustard and a side of cut gherkin, yet he still kept staring at the guy in front of him.
Another thing to smell. Steve faked a smile and moved closer, taking a sniff of the ball in milky blue color with the shop’s name stamped on it. It wasn’t that bad. It smelled sweet and subtle.
"Maybe later," Steve started walking out of the kitchen. Sam always offered him free pastries and Steve was grateful, but sometimes it felt as too much. Although, he wouldn't say no to some cheesecake. "Hey, I will see you this evening, right?"
"What?!" Steve asked, and it came out harsher than he wished it did.
“I am just saying,” Steve said, grinning a bit too broad, knowing that they were heading into a dangerous topic, and leaned closer, minimizing the distance between him and his friend, “the world changed, Sam. Masculinity and femininity are not that far apart anymore. And who would be better to talk about this than a drag queen?”
"Oh God," Tony slumped in the armchair, holding Peter close and letting him eat. "Yay," he cheered quietly, sounding exhausted. "Good boy," Tony praised, looking at Peter with adoration, tears drying on his cheeks.
“You told your mom you are gay?!”
Tony was bored. So, so bored. He caught a glimpse of Pepper sending him a scolding look and straightened up in his seat, pretending to pay attention. He just wanted to go back home and curl up next to Steve, feeling Steve’s fingers stroking his hair and maybe, if he got lucky, Steve would rub his belly, using just enough pressure to make him smile and feel like melting. He started to smile at the thought and Pepper sent him a confused look. Uh oh. He better control himself. Tony grinned sheepishly at Pepper and set his face in a schooled, thoughtful look, trying to focus his attention on the meeting. Just half an hour more… It was all ending statements, so it was nothing bad if he decided to check his social media, right? Cautiously, Tony took out his phone and unlocked the screen, keeping the phone under the table. A new tasting video from Thor, with a package of sweets sent from the Netherlands. Tony made a mental note to drop later to Thor’s floor and ask if he had any stroopwafels left to share because they were amazing with black coffee. Clint commenting on funny cats videos, Tony added it to his watch later list. As usual, his own social media were bursting with notifications, people raving over Iron Man and asking for more videos of Steve training routine, which, Tony couldn’t blame them, the sight of his boyfriend working out was heaven. He even decided to check his Tumblr, curious if anyone sent him some more tips or maybe just left him a nice message -
"Good," Steve smiled, laying next to his husband, his nose pressing into Tony's cheek. From up close, Steve could see some dark circles under his lover’s eyes, showing sleepless, uncomfortable nights, but his eyelashes and brows seemed thicker and darker and lips somehow got fuller. Not mentioning that his skin got softer and smoother and had some almost pearly glow to it. Tony would deny it all, blaming it purely on Steve's love for him and claiming that he was a mess, but Steve knew better. Tony looked just divine.
Tony started to smile in relief. It was really happening. Steve accepted one of Tony’s darkest secrets and even wanted to take part in it. Tony could barely wrap his mind around it, already feeling excited and giddy.
"Tony-"
“Sure. You like it and I like tickling you too. It’s a win-win, right?”
"HEY, TONES!" the man called into the workshop. "Some guy is asking for you!"
"Good, thanks," Steve smiled back, breathing in the scent of fresh pastries. Yesterday was a great night. It still felt a little unreal to him, having a fiancé, but seeing the engagement ring on Tony's finger while he had leaned down to kiss his sleeping queen and went out to get some fresh bread for breakfast was a very real reminder. "Do you have any brioches today? I want to make French toasts for Tony's breakfast."
“It is how I usually show up. I think it would ruin the experience if I entered as a male and walked out as a female on the stage,” he explained himself with a shrug.
"No amount of makeup will help that face," Tootsie grumbled out, teasing her friend, and Lady Mint snorted so hard, the prosecco came out through her nose and more laughter followed.
“Um. It would be better if I just showed you. I want you to meet them.”
Steve decided to not say anything more, only kept a gentle smile on his face as he let his pouting husband first into the elevator and followed selecting their penthouse. Their date night, coinciding with Halloween, something Tony might have matched earlier, was kind of a disaster. All movies in the theaters were horrors and modern horrors were not what he remembered from when he was growing up. The stories were repeatable, movie effects were tacky and the acting was horrible. To add to the offense, the restaurant they wanted to have dinner in, had an emergency and was closed for the day. Tony was irritated and hungry and just wanted to go home, order pizza and spend the rest of Halloween on the couch, eating miniature sized candy bars. Maybe watch some movies from Peter's childhood, because watching Peter roll in his blanket and rompers and babbling happily always cheered him up and Peter's embarrassed groans were a bonus.
The introduction was late and happened in the wrong order, but it was enough to bring the carefree atmosphere back.
Like that one time…
"Nonsense, he likes the attention. Our cat diva," Tony brushed Steve off. Steve only growled, knowing that there were two divas in the room. "And tell me that this isn't the cutest thing you have ever seen!" he turned to Steve with a smile, holding two pretty plush toys of Figaro, one in Captain America gear, the other one in Iron Man suit.
"What?!" Tony shrilled out, not believing that Steve would go so low to first turn him on and then deny him. That was really, really low. Unworthy of Captain America.
Wrong.
“Okay,” he heard a chair being pushed to the back on the soft carpet and saw Red Velvet sitting in front of the vanity station. “Now to show you how the magic happens! Yet first, I have to introduce you to the least attractive part of drag,” she said, opening the drawer on her left.
“Hi,” Steve smiled, happy with his boyfriend coming back.
Well, that escalated quickly…
"Hey, don't tell anyone!" Steve called, needing Clint to keep the big news to himself.
"You should be," Tony said back, sounding and looking in pain. Steve didn't have to ask to know that Tony was afraid. He was afraid for his family. Afraid how far Stone would go. Steve couldn't let that continue. He wouldn't allow that kind of harassment right under his nose.
"Thank you for telling me this, Tony," Sarah said in a warm tone, putting her manicured hand over Tony's fist, trying to soothe him. "That required a lot of courage. You are a good person and you make my son happy, that's all that matters to me."
“True,” Tony agreed, “But it doesn’t hurt to find out again,” he said and lowered his hands, fingers running over Steve’s stomach, hips, ribs, and over any other spot he could reach, searching for the best, giggliest reaction.
“Ah hahaha… Ohkahay!” Tony agreed, shielding his stomach with one hand and using the other one to reach for his phone. “Uhh… Should I update and delete it?” Tony asked. With everything working out so great, there was no reason for him to keep that account. No more secret lusting, when he had it all in real life.
"Oh my God, get out!" Tony panicked, not liking what he was seeing, and easily identified as an allergy attack. Roses? The scented candles? The new silk sheets in red color sprayed with essentials oils? There were too many variables and there was no time to analyze them all before Steve's head would swell like a tomato.
Except for the terrible morning, Tony had a pretty good day. He aced another assignment, no surprise here, managed to eat lunch in peace with Tiberius, and his henchmen disappearing somewhere. He just needed to get home safely. When the last bell rang, Tony hurriedly left the class, hoping that it was a good sign that Tiberius wasn't present during lunch break and maybe he could have some peaceful afternoon.
"I work with Tony, we have a business together," Rhodey said his story.
Red Velvet seemed speechless, while the crowd laughed at the playful remark. Steve had to bump his shoulder with Red's, trying to break her out of the trance, and put the mic to her lips, urging her to speak.
"Good job," Steve praised, playing with the short hair at the back of Tony's head. He kissed his husband's temple, feeling his heart swell with love and just ecstatic from the shared moment and how well Tony listened. It was a true partnership, where they both cared about their needs and Steve just loved his husband more and more. "You can talk now, by the way," Steve said, remembering that he never called off the
"Hm?"
Steve took off his shirt, Tony doing the same, and then lay down in bed, flat on his back. It could be sexy, but none of them thought about it, and then Tony followed, lying on top of Steve, lining himself in a way that his stomach was on top of Steve's. Tony let out a relaxed breath, sinking into his husband’s heat and closing his eyes.
The day could end in a very different scenario, and yet it had the best outcome. Steve couldn't be happier and when he was leaving his mom's house, holding a hefty grocery back full of treats his mom had prepared and insisted on Steve taking it, he saw his mom and Tony, heads close to each other and engaged in a conversation that looked secretive.
"And now, I would like you all to meet him," Red said into the mike, trying to be louder than everybody, "you probably already seen him," she added in a playful jab, meaning Steve's almost stalking her, "but it is the first time you will really meet him, my personal Prince Charming, my future husband, Mr. Blue Velvet! Come on, hun!" she called, gesturing at the silver curtain.
"HAH!" Tony's head jerked up, sparkles showing in his eyes. Bingo. Steve indulged his lover with few more precise moves, watching Tony's face became heated, moans and gasp falling from his lips and when they reached the desired level of loudness, Steve slowly withdrew his hand. "Wait-what?" Tony asked, eyes opening wide when he felt the unwelcomed emptiness. "What the fuck, Ste-"
“Oh,” Steve said, carding his fingers through the short hair on the back of Tony’s head. Tony shivered, just slightly, from the light touch, smiling against Steve’s skin and Steve felt an urge to touch him all over. This time differently, more aware and more intimate, paying closer attention to the reactions. “So… you wanna do it?”
"Seems like a decent guy."
"Do you like it?" Tony asked, straw still in his mouth.
Steve smiled, hearing the bathroom door open. "Warmed up your spot," he said, rolling to his side of the bed and waiting.
“I know,” Red Velvet finally spoke, going in for more kisses.
" - dad, seriously, listen to me-"
Tony giggled, holding a cup with coffee in one hand, and blueberry pop tart in the other leisurely leaned against the bed frame. "Just temporarily. My girls are coming over and I think you will get bored."
“Yeah, okay,” Steve agreed in a small voice, hearing Red Velvet leave. His stupid body had to betray him in such moment.
Steve blinked, smiling from the couch at his husband, showing tired, blue eyes that sparked in amusement. “But you still ate it, right?”
"I can feel you smirking, if you don't put me down right now, you will be sleeping on this damn couch for the rest of the month!"
“Your mother?”
"You came here for your order?" Sam asked, straightening up and wiping hands in his apron. The dough was resting under a clean cloth, needing time to rise. "I had to test out a few recipes before I came up with a one I was pleased with," he handed Steve a pink box with a bow and the bakery's logo stamped in one corner.
“GAAA HAHAHA!”
"Yes, Friday?" Steve asked, luckily not smelling any more smoke, but having a feeling that he might not like what he would hear next.
"Hey, Steve, how's your head?"
The crowd cheered, the loudest being Wanda and Pietro, but maybe because they were the closest. Steve could feel how tense Tony became, but he didn't move away, allowing Steve to take the lead. When the kiss ended, Tony stayed close to the other man, putting his heated face in the crook of Steve's neck, needing a minute for his racing mind to calm down. They had kissed in public. Again. It was some big steps for him.
"You must be really somewhere else right now. Not that I am complaining," Red Velvet finished putting the earrings on and reached for the transparent lip gloss, applying a shiny coat on top of the red lipstick and smacked her lips together with a wet sound, "but it is the first time when seeing me change didn't give you an instant boner."
"I can't believe, you sold our cat," Steve said in a heavy voice, eyebrows drew together and jaws clenched angrily. This wasn't right.
Tony scrunched his nose. "Not that I am not in the mood to get drunk and listen to grunge music, but I was hoping we can go home. I need a proper bath, I feel like I still have some mud in my ass crack."
"No, just hurry up, before soup gets cold!"
“Um, excuse me!” Steve called, stopping the walking past by waitress.
"I will see you later, babe!" Steve smiled, turning in the direction of his apartment.
Steve smiled wider, the love in his eyes not changing a bit. "Sure. I found you attractive enough to put a baby inside you, didn't I?" he asked playfully and Tony scoffed. A scoff didn't suit his face. Steve decided to fix it by fluttering his fingers over Tony's cheeks delicately.
"Good night," Friday replied, sounding relieved.
"Okay, I am done."
"Thank you, honey," Steve leaned in closer, kissing Tony and strongly tasting coffee on his husband's lips. Well, Tony had to somehow keep himself awake.
Watching Tony transforming into Red Velvet… That was something Steve didn’t know he needed in his life, but he couldn’t wait to see it.
"I am not sure how I feel about objectifying me, but I will take it as a compliment."
"Why are you doing this?" Tony asked in a timid whisper.
“Yeah,” Tony said to himself, but mock saluted Coulson on his way out, making the agent’s steps lighter.
“Vanilla and orange blossom. I had a feeling you will like it,” Tony smiled, adding the bath bomb to the pile in the basket.
"It is from your friend, right?" Red Velvet asked and she took out one cupcake, turning it in her hand and looking at it from every angle. It smelled like cocoa and the white frosting was swirled out perfectly. "It is cute, but I am not actually a fan of red velvet cake," she smiled gently.
Sarah sat down, her face clouding with worry.
It wasn't like Tony to be a considerate sleeping partner - Tony could flop all over the place, kick the covers down or pull them to himself and wrap with the material, creating a cocoon. Other times, he tended to crash into Steve, rolling into his sleeping body with force and holding, looking for his husband's sleeping form and being a clingy octopus. Even if that usually woke Steve up, it was comforting and Steve quickly fell back to sleep, lulled by the sound of Tony's breathing and his warmth, unlike on those nights when Tony wrapped himself in the covers, and Steve had to wrestle some material from underneath him. So, even if Steve woke up, he decided to not give it away, because Tony clearly didn't want to disturb him. Tony tried to be all sneaky and quiet, slowly moving to the side of the bed, almost sliding, trying to evenly distribute his weight and not let the mattress dipping give him away. It would be a success, if not for the final part, when, probably he stepped on something on the floor, most probably the socks he had carelessly thrown to the floor the evening earlier, and spectacularly slipped and tumbled down the bed, landing on the floor with a loud thud and a bit back curse. Still, Steve didn't react, and Tony did neither, just staying still and out of Steve's line of sight. The moment continued, and Steve felt alarmed, thinking that Tony wasn't a klutz, but he had a history of unfortunate accidents while not fully rested, and Steve feared that maybe his husbands slipped so badly he somehow managed to bang his head, but before that thought could fully form, there was Tony's head popping up over the edge of the bed and very, very slowly, Tony stood up, taking his night robe and quietly tiptoed out of the bedroom.
"Kamala!" a dark-haired teenager with a hair neat stretched over his head popped out from the backspace. "Did you finish putting together the boxes?"
Red Velvet nodded.
Steve was still wrapped in blissful sleep when he felt it. The dip of the bed, the thigh pressing against his leg, radiating characteristic heat. Someone looking at his face and leaning in, soft breathing hearable in the quiet surroundings. Steve thought that wakening up by a kiss was a quite good scenario, a scenario he would happily follow. It just wasn't this scenario.
“Will you calm down?” Sam hissed, sitting at the other end of the table. The grip Steve had on an empty glass of Long Island Ice Tea was alarmingly tight and Sam began to worry that some accident involving shredded glass and blood might happen soon.
"Good?" Steve asked, pulling the thin covers over Tony, covering the whole baby bump in the sheen material.
Steve laughed to himself, watching pleased looking Sam handing a hungry Bucky another roll, his friend biting right into the soft, baked goodness. Bucky wouldn't be Bucky if he didn't add something, and he kept muttering more things that had layers between the bites, including ogres and, for some unknown reason, witchers. They chatted for a bit longer and when first customers started to line up, Steve took his bag with bread and headed home, back to his fiancé, his steps as light as air.
Before Steve had a chance to say goodbye, he was dragged into Red Velvet’s changing room.  He was still processing what he heard and just had to ask.
Steve felt his face blushing and looked at his shoes in panic. He had no clue how to explain this all.
From there it went smoothly and Red Velvet performed a spontaneous singing duet with her fiancé before singing her usual repertoire, Arrow did a magic act out of her routine, Tootsie sang some heavy songs, and even Lady Mint and Bianca got talked into performing. Halfway the night, Sam had sneaked out to his bakery, and with Rhodey's help, rolled in trays of white sheet cakes, covered in vanilla buttercream and decorated with piped out roses and written congratulations to Red and Steve and everyone got a slice, wishing the newly engaged couple all the best.
Speaking of Tony, he could use his boyfriend’s advice… Steve checked his phone and knew that Tony was still stuck in a business meeting, and won’t be back for an hour or so and as much as he wanted to not think about the Twitter issue it kept coming back to him. What was he supposed to write on Twitter? Something that wouldn’t give too much about him, but would be safe and entertaining. He needed inspiration. Maybe a walk would clear his mind but as Steve was getting up, he noticed Tony’s tablet laying at the edge of the coffee table.
The joke was on him, though.
"I am not a makeup artist," Tony confessed, voice coming out strained and pained, "I am a drag queen. Well, three times per week I am a drag queen, sometimes four when I have to fill in someone's shift," Tony tried to joke, but stopped immediately seeing the analyzing look Sarah was giving him. "So, yeah, that's who I am," Tony ended, looking down at the album in his lap, fingers once splayed over the photo from Steve's childhood, curling into a fist from nervousness.
"You know, you had been showing me a whole lot of your world. How about I show you now some of mine?" Steve said, standing behind the chair and putting his hands on Red's shoulders.
The laughter was gone when they noticed the two people standing behind Peter. Ned looked absolutely mortified, and MJ curled in herself, just to hold her laughter in better.
“HAAHAHA! Stoooop,” Tony tried to swat Steve away, feeling too blissful to move. Of course that a long, intimate tickle session changed into an amazing make out. It was incredible how the tickle foreplay increased their appetite and how wonderfully responsive Tony became.
Everything seemed to go well and Steve's heart was beating a cheerful melody. Even the expected, sour look Loki had sent him after he had entered the club, didn't bring him down. He stopped in front of Red's changing room, combing a hand through his hair, rehearsing in his mind what he wanted to say.
"And let me guess, you must be Steve's mom! I can tell because you both have that lovely face structure," Lady Mint said friendly and Sarah just couldn't take eyes off of the colorful and beautiful person next to her.
"Stop talking," Steve ordered. Tony's eyes became even wider at the commanding tone and he stared at his husband, blinking in confusion.
When Steve walked back into the apartment, it was barely after 9 am. He knew that Tony liked to sleep in after his shows, and Steve was really surprised when he heard Tony's voice, high and excited, coming from the bedroom.
"Uhhmm, before you go, could you help me with something?" Tony asked in a sultry voice, sitting up and smoothening hands over the covers in a slow, long move, until he was laying flat on his belly, legs crossed delicately in the ankles. Eyes having that helpless, pleading look that made Steve feel weak in the knees immediately. It was almost hypnotizing.
"Groossss," Tony complained, scrubbing off layers of mud off his skin in the bathroom. "How many bruises I have?" he asked, turning his back to Steve.
“It will be better if we drizzle some honey on it, trust me,” Steve said, standing up, “you have honey?”
“Sorry if this isn’t what you expected,” Tony turned to him, when Beth was gone, losing the battle over if Tony should or should not eat, and Steve blinked in confusion. Expecting what? The mouthwatering sandwich or the mouthwatering man in front of him?
This was.
"Always."
Tony shook his head, strong enough to let Steve feel the movement.
It was when Steve finished his drink and put the empty mug away with a quiet sound on the nightstand table when Tony spoke.
"Huh?" Steve asked, wiping his mouth when the rest of the cupcake was gone. "What do you mean by that?"
Steve grinned cheekily. Of course, Sam could think that, seeing how many difficulties Steve had with coming out to his best friend. He started time after time, always backing up the last second, until one evening, after a lot of self-loathing and guilt, he sent a text message to Sam’s phone. ‘
“Are you holding tweezers?” Steve murmured out in his half-awake state, not bothering to open his eyes. He was not falling for the same trick again.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You can call me Rhodey," he said, nodding first to Sarah and reaching her hand to her, before shaking Sam's hand and Sam introduced himself, while Lady Mint sat next to Sarah on a chair that had been pulled out for her by Rhodey.
One cleaning and few pills of Claritin later, they ended on the couch, Steve's head settled on Tony's lap, as he still felt a bit fuzzy. Tony put some movie on, but Steve didn't pay attention, going over what just happened.
Steve completely froze. Please, not now.
Tony and Rhodey kept talking about something, but Steve pretty much muted the whole conversation out. It felt like he walked into an entirely different world.
Steve's tensed shoulders jumped when Friday addressed him. Oh right. He was living in a highly technological building, if there would be a fire, Friday was the first to know and could activate the complicated line of sprinklers. False alarm.
Okay, time to snap out of it.
Or maybe more than one slice.
“You remember that shop where I bought the flowers and candles?” Tony said suddenly and Steve looked at him. Tony’s eyes were fixed on the grave and hidden behind the sunglasses, but Steve could still see some sadness in the brown eyes.
"Tony... You look beautiful," Steve said in a love filled voice, adding a third finger, and Tony's eyes snapped open when the build up was reaching its climax. It was incredible how he could feel every stroke, not distracted by his own voice, and how focused and thorough Steve was, finding every sensitive spot. Just staying quiet was becoming more and more difficult as the heat in his body was increasing, pooling in the pit of his stomach, and when Steve's fingers pressed on his sweet spot and held, Tony's body started to shiver and there was this wonderful rush in his head, causing his limbs to go all stiff and hips snap forward when he came for the second time. Different, quieter, but so deep he could feel it in every nerve ending on his body.
That calmed down Steve a little bit. The minutes before the show started were always killing him. “Thanks, Arrow,” he answered, of course knowing the waitress’ name. He knew all names of the employees of the Olive.
With a smile on his lips, Steve trotted to the door, but changed his mind last second and sat back on the couch, where he had a nice view of his lady getting ready. Red raised her eyebrow at that.
"Sorry, ma, it slipped my mind."
Steve shrugged, understanding that what he wrote, did sound menacing, even if it wasn’t his intention. “Just write that we are fine and your boyfriend plans on fulfilling your each and every one tickle fantasy.”
Tony would stay mad if it wasn’t for the soft and adoring way Steve was looking at him. Unfair. “Morning.”
"Uh, yeah, you never forget the first guy who busted your lip," Bucky said, pointing at the left corner of his mouth, where he had a thin, pale scar. "He had the boniest fists."
Sam, engrossed in a conversation with a pretty young girl behind the bar, turned around, blinking surprised when he saw Steve's mom. "Mrs. Rogers!" Sam called and waved back, turning to Tootsie to tell her a few words, before he took his beer and came closer. "Hello, Mrs. Rogers," he greeted her properly, leaning down so Sarah could smooch his cheek.
"Yeah," Steve smiled, leaning on the counter, with a bright grin. "Soooo... Blue lips, huh?"
Steve almost had a heart attack out of joy. The moment was magical, but before he could truly embrace it, Red Velvet took out the mic from the stand and began walking on the stage.
Tony trotted to the door with an excited smile, and opened it, looking into the changing room. "Where are you going?"
"This isn't your business!" Tony yelled, sounding in pain.
"I already put an order for your drink, because opposite to you, I am a good, loyal friend," Tootsie summed up their conversation.
"Sure. Just make it quick, honey, I have a show to perform."
“Yeah,” he laughed, and Steve made a mental note to use female pronouns towards Tony while he was in the club. “Good times.”
“Well,” Tony fluttered his long eyelashes playfully, taking the compliment with a smile.
"Nothing!" Tony chirped, smiling brightly. Steve narrowed his eyes but smiled back in the end. Someone was in a good mood.
"Now I keep wondering if you would barge on the stage and kiss me during mid-show."
"Tony," the guy, Rhodey, scolded his friend, in a lot softer voice than he used to talk to Steve earlier.
"I think we should switch," Tony laughed, having Wanda's face smushed against his face. He would happily discuss the remaining of the game with Wanda, and let Steve have his guy time with Pietro. And boy, Steve had a lot of points to discuss about the game, considering how heated the discussion above his head was.
"No, she likes Tony, the makeup artist," Tony sighed, "what if she won't like me as your boyfriend? What if she thinks that I am messed up in the head and corrupting her darling little boy and stopping him from living the picture-perfect life with a loving wife, five kids and a dog in the backyard?"
Oh, it would be so easy to get an upper hand again. Steve didn’t know if Tony was just terrible at self-defense, but he left his torso completely in the open and just one, well-measured poke and Steve would have a lap full of a giggling Iron Man. But he didn’t want to spoil the moment, quite fond of their new play.
"Well," Steve brushed his cheek on Tony's fluffy hair, "you know how to be a pain in my ass," he said in humor and felt a warm puff of air on his neck and the way Tony's shoulders rose and fell with a short laugh. "Just for the record, I am never again giving you any space," Steve growled, his words colored with some playful tones.
"Bye!" Steve smiled, watching the door close behind his friend. He couldn't stop smiling. It was great to be reunited with his childhood friend. And he couldn't wait to introduce Bucky to Sam.
“That’s my room,” Velvet said, stopping in front of the door with a golden star in the upper part, with a ’Red Velvet’ written in a curly font. She reached into her pocket for the key.
"Sorry!" Steve laughed, "me and Bucky were best pals in childhood until his family moved to Ohio."
Steve felt something fuzzy in his chest. That was his Tony - always doing some small, sweet things for him.
"You are not eating with me?" Steve asked, taking a fork and easily cutting through into the fluffy pancakes.
"Oh, you are a drag queen too?" Sarah beamed, more and more intrigued.
Tony smiled. “Wear a jacket.”
"You started it," Steve grinned broadly, not going subtle and tickling and tickling and tickling, enjoying the way Tony squirmed between his hands, unable to escape and helpless with laughter.
Steve smiled, feeling that he had an upper hand in this matter and handed two lipsticks back to Tony. “I work in an art supply store, Tony. I can tell shades of red apart,” he explained, sounding smug and Tony smiled cheekily.
Steve's shoulders jumped after hearing the voice. He looked at Bucky, full name James Barnes, his best friend, standing near his locker and getting out of the books needed for today's classes.
"Stop staring."
Fine. Both could play this game.
"So, can I come back to bed?" Steve asked, making his voice lighter to try and brighten the atmosphere.
“Good show, Red!”
"Don't worry, dear, if I didn't want people to look at me, I wouldn't dress the way I do," Mint said, fixing her hair and making it even puffier. It brought attention to her nails, long and painted with mint color nail polish with some crystals at the tips. "I met your son once at Red's apartment. You have a very charming son, Mrs. Rogers."
“How thoughtful of you,” Steve praised in an exaggerated way, kissing his husband’s jawline.
"That was fun, right?"
"You're gonna be so smooth after this," Tony hummed enticingly, still rubbing the stripe making sure it would catch as much hair as possible. "I won't be able to get my hands off of you," he said, leaning his warm weight over Steve's, the cool satin feeling pleasantly slippery and soothing on his skin.
Steve looked back, and scoffed, at Figaro who stood on his hind paws, and was curiously glancing inside the box.
That was nice. The flickering lights in the background, coming from their private Christmas tree reminded Tony that he should be nice too. “Thanks for the pizza. I was getting hungry down there.”
"Mhhhhm," Steve hummed, not agreeing or objecting, just enjoying the treatment, after Tony made his touch gentler. That felt nice. He half-closed his eyes, catching a glimpse of Tony's drying, already softly curling hair and wondering if he would leave it like that or slick to the back with a handful of hair gel. Steve preferred Tony's hair in its natural state - soft and bouncy.
"Snickering at me," Steve complained, trying not to sound too pathetic. Judging by the giggle behind him, he obviously failed.
"What?" Red asked, smiling in an amused way.
"Please, no details," Sam sighed, warning Bucky who grinned mischievously.
"Uh? Yeah, sure, why?"
"Ha-ha," Steve fake laughed, causing Tony to laugh back, just real and honest. Beautiful. "No need to rub in my face that I ruined our Valentine's day."
"I don't sing."
Sarah looked alarmed at the sudden change of tone and the serious look on her boy's face.
There was a buzzing sound and he pushed the door open. “After you,” he encouraged Steve to go first. Steve did so, entering the spacious, well-lit corridor.
“Hey, Loki!”
"Just you and me, Tony," Steve smiled, keeping Tony trapped in his arms and using both hands to tickle whichever ticklish spot he could reach on his boyfriend and there was a lot of them. "You and me," Steve repeated, and as quickly as tickling started, soon it ended, Steve ending his play with a deep kiss, that lasted and lasted until Tony became limp in his arms, pressing back to Steve and never wanting to lose that feeling.
Sam turned his eyes away from the bartender and looked irritated at his friend.
The mattress felt like a marshmallow. He felt like sinking in and not being able to get up anymore, the softness swallowing him. Steve usually preferred to sleep on a firmer surface, but since Tony's pregnancy started to show, they had to switch to a softer mattress, one that would accommodate Tony's rounder shapes. Steve wriggled his butt more into the pre-existing groove, trying to deepen it, for Tony to sink right in whenever he would finish his evening routine in the bathroom before a night of sleep. A glass of iced water nearby, air conditioning on low, filling their bedroom with cool air, all it was a good start of a full night of sleep. And Tony absolutely needed a full night of sleep.
Steve shuddered. "Loki," he confessed, hearing Tony's pearly laughter in return.
"That was interesting," Tony smiled, hooking his arms with Steve as they started to walk their way.
"What do you mean your family…?"
“You know me so well.”
"Honey?!" Tony called from the kitchen table, arranging the fresh veggies around the homemade dips, when the doorbell rang, "can you get that?"
“Can I get you, boys, anything else?” Arrow asked, gently taking the empty glass from Steve’s clutches and on putting it on the tray she was caring, a single strand of red hair slipping out of the green hood. Arrow’s thing was fantasy looks. She rocked it in green cape going down to her nicely shaped butt, and a belt with big buckle was hugging her waist, bringing out the feminine shape of the body clad in a green leather suit.
"Yeah. I think that there is like thirty minutes left before he shows up," Rhodey answered Tony with a mischievous grin as both men enjoyed the growing panic in the teenager.
" Peter sang, loud and proud, squaring his shoulders and raising knees high with every step.
"I think," Steve started in a heavy voice, feeling his throat becoming dry, "I think I like you this way," he twirled a wet strand of brown hair between his fingers, before tugging it behind Tony's ear.
"Sure, he is," Steve agreed, just for the sake of agreeing. He would have a close eye on Loki too. Just in case. Yet, if it would ever get to a confrontation, he would prefer to face Thor, the bodyguard who usually stood in the front of the Olive. Loki seemed like a type that carried a hidden blade in his pocket and wouldn't hesitate to use it. At least, he could dodge and block punches, knifes not so much. "Do you want to get a drink? I think Bucky's show is about to start," Steve asked. He had no more plans for today, and ending the day at the club seemed fitting.
"Meow!"
"You fell asleep half way through the movie!"
"Ugh, this sucks," Steve said in dismay, sniffling, the stuffiness in his nose not going away yet.
Steve didn't know a lot about love. He never really experienced it, rejected by most of the girls back in the times before he got the serum, while his time with Peggy, the girl he truly felt close to, was cut short and the blossoming feeling never developed. After waking up in the 21st century, Steve didn't expect to ever fit in, not even mentioning finding love, but a miracle happened and he and Tony found each other. That, that Steve could call love. That warm, soothing feeling whenever he looked at Tony, was close to him, and listened to his voice. Their love was growing and filling his heart and soul with something he never experienced before. Steve wouldn't call himself an expert on love, but he knew that what he was feeling towards Tony, that was true love. Pure and passionate and everlasting.
the very first chapter! if you would like to read more of this fic, let me know, as this is still a work in progress. will have some references to Ru Paul’s Drag Race and the beginning is based on my very first contact with drag culture, which was a scene in Friends.
“No, Steve, I - ” Tony walked into the bedroom, trying to make his voice strong. Just remember what he had planned and it would be fine. “I want to talk first, okay?"
“Oh, so you did it for my well being?”
"Besides," Bucky swallowed the bun down, "someone had to help Sam get out of the dress anyway."
“Tony - ” Steve started, sitting up straight, pulling shoulders back.
“Wow,” Sam said, genuinely surprised. “And how did she react?”
"Hello."
"N-no. Just in a hurry to class," he said, wanting to be left alone. Just please leave him alone.
"Why do I even bother with having interns?!" Tony complained loudly, just for the sake of complaining. "Watch them for me, okay?" he said quietly to Rhodey, using a softer voice. Rhodey nodded, walking for starters to Harley, who seemed to be getting overwhelmed.
"You want a tummy rub?" Steve filled in with a smile. The cute thing about Tony, among other things, was that he really, really liked having his belly rubbed. Steve found it surprising at first, but it quickly became one of his favorite things too. There was something really sweet about the way Tony's face relaxed and his whole body became soft just from few strokes over his stomach. Heck, Steve wouldn't be surprised if this whole thing was a trick to get a tummy rub, because, for some reason, Tony couldn't ask like a normal person.
“Velvet?” Steve repeated.
“You wear a jacket,” Steve smiled back, walking into the bathroom. It didn’t make sense and was all playful and Steve felt light as air.
“No need to be. Although, my condolences to you.”
“Hmm...what makes you think that?”
They will win. They have to.
He texted.
, he thought as he too allowed the drowsiness to settle in his mind,
He’d almost lost what he didn’t know he even had. His soulmate was here with him, holding on to him, and had never given up on him. Not the time when he absconded to track down the most lethal assassin in history, not the time when he took down an entire governmental agency in his pursuit of the assassin, not when he continuously berated his soulmate in front of their shared team, not when he lost trust in the man and let everybody know it, not when he betrayed his soulmate in favor of others and attacked him viciously. Not even when the world ended did this man leave his side, and now, now he’d failed Tony again, in such a way that he wasn’t sure he could come back from after expending all of the chances he’d never earned.
"Now, as I was saying," Sarah clapped in her hands, "shoes off, hands clean and we can sit to dinner -"
His and his dad's project was completed and they successfully recreated a breathing, living pterodactyl.
“Damn straight, I am straight,” Sam remarked in a low grumble, his eyes going to the bar area where Arrow was leaning and placing an order. “Straight as an uncooked spaghetti noodle…” he said, his voice losing its anger and getting a softer note that sounded a lot like longing when he watched a person behind the bar. Big, frilly dark hair, dark eye makeup, pink lips. She laughed hearing the order and started to prepare the drink for Steve first, moving smoothly and gracefully, the bright pink fur bolero and giant silver hoops in her ears, not constricting her movements in the slightest. Underneath the fur was a silver top with leopard print on spaghetti straps and knowing her, she had to wear small shorts and boots going way past her knees. Sam couldn’t help but stare.
"Huh?" Steve looked up from his bowl of sugar frosted cereal. They had such a lazy, long morning changing into afternoon, that none of them felt like preparing a proper breakfast, settling on Tony's secret stash and choosing something to go with the already lazy day. They even stayed in bed, getting crumbs all over the bedding. "You are kicking me out?"
There was no answer, but a surprised scream of pain. Stone whipped around and was shocked himself when a fist collided with his face and the pain and impact made him stagger.
"You read my mind," Tony giggled happily, letting Steve pull him up from the bed. It was high time for them both to spend some time together and a shared breakfast was a good start.
No matter if the Panthers would win the game or not, he was going home with the grand prize anyway.
"I should still check on Tony - "
"Steve asked me to come. He said he has something important to tell me - oh," she gasped, suddenly realizing where she was. "Oh, is this where Tony works?"
"It is my wig," Tony laughed, reaching his hand into the bathtub, taking out the long, wet hair. It was the knee-length wig, the one with perfectly straight, silky smooth hair, Steve found incredibly sexy on Red Velvet, but he might reconsider that statement after today. The black strands were hanging down miserably, dripping with water and it was like something pulled out of a horror movie. The view sent a shiver down Steve's spine, and Tony didn't seem bothered, used to it. "I am washing them," Tony explained simply, pointing Steve's attention to more plastic containers stacked on the washing machine, full of black hair of different texture.
"Ekhem," the guy coughed, pointing Tony's attention to himself.
Tony didn’t understand. He remained still, waiting for Steve to talk more.
He didn't let anyone on his plan and so far, everything was going good. The only person who knew what was about to happen was the owner of the Pitted Olive, an exceptionally somber-looking guy named Nick Fury, who, as Tony had told him, was once a very famous drag queen back in the day called Madam Wrath. A very fitting name.
"Only if you leave," Tony said, sounding humored by his young lover's playful behavior. "It is not fun to gossip about you while you are here."
There was an excited whooping from the crowd and Tony looked at the screen with the score, seeing a heart in the frame, scanning the crowd for couples.
“Write to this one that I don’t like them either,” Steve hissed, looking at the last comment.
Tony listened, staring at Steve. It all made sense and it was quite frightening.
"If you are lucky," Tony sighed, yet, he still took a hot dog, because he was hungry after all that running. Steve was undeterred. He looked forward to watching the game and managed to get some really good seats. The tribunes were filling up with people and the basketball game was about to start, just when Tony was finishing the first hot dog.
Steve launched forward, Peter screeched, and Tony laughed as he watched his husband attacking their son, holding him trapped in his arms and drilling fingers into Peter's stomach and under the arms, sometimes squeezing at the thighs and knees when Peter tried to kick him.
"I don't like bullies," Steve replied immediately. Tony curled in himself, hoping for a different answer, but it was a stupid, naive thought to start with.
"That's going to the Avengers group chat!" Steve called, grinning in an evil way, and walking out, already typing on the phone. "And maybe to instagram," he said, and Tony shrieked in protest. "Oh, only to the stories, it will disappear after twenty-four hours!"
“Tony—”
"Negative!" Tony called back, and Peter kicked his legs with another ear drums ripping scream, not liking this position.
Really, increasingly difficult. He couldn’t distance himself from the topic that ran so close to his heart and affected directly one of the people he cared about the most. Steve was good and kind and didn’t deserve bad things happen to him for being himself.

"I didn't sell anyone," Tony replied lightly, not seeing the whole drama of the situation.
“Oh, babe…” Steve sighed softly, reading more posts, some screaming nervousness as Tony was pouring his heart out, feeling miserable with his inability to tell Steve the truth, some so heartwarming and oozing happiness when Tony was describing Steve’s last tickle attacks and how incredibly good and completed it made Tony feel.
"Ewww," Tony laughed, his nose scrunching in disgust. That was one mental image he didn't need to picture. "What if you get hungry?"
"I am glad you're home!" Steve kept smiling sunnily and all kinds of emotions washed over Tony. Steve really missed him. And Tony did miss Steve too, but he had a reputation to uphold.
Steve’s eyes caught on some text among the images and gifs. A separate post.
"Oh, don't be a baby!"
Tony didn't move but saw Figaro zooming across the room, chasing the free scrunchie, happy with getting his toy back. Tony wasn't that happy.
Steve stretched, he opened his eyes and looked around, before his eyes locked with Tony's. His husband was sitting in the middle of the bed on his knees and holding a tray and singing gently.
Tony laughed, his eyes crinkling at the corners. He just wanted to have a calm, afternoon nap. Just him, warm covers, and some sleep. When Steve had decided to join, it was even better, because the super soldier serum made him a living furnace and Tony liked the idea of being cuddled into something nice and heated. He just didn’t expect that his nice and heated thing would gently poke all over him, finding sensitive spots and wriggling fingers into them.
“Wait, what do you understand?” Steve asked, feeling that they might be not on the same page.
“You do?” Tony asked, voice trembling with excitement.
Steve was blushing. Blushing so much his face would melt off. Why Tony had to be so loud.
"This is great," Steve said, drawing away from the hug. "You changed so much."
“The same, please,” Steve asked politely.
“I thought you wanted to sleep. Why are you not going to sleep?” Steve asked in a teasing voice, glancing at his boyfriend and replacing his mouth with hands, softly brushing over the warm skin.
