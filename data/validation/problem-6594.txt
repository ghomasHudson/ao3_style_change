“Of course,” Tony replied. He slid his phone from his pocket and sent a quick text to the general manager of the St. Regis. Rhodey would need a room there tonight, if he wasn’t coming back to the mansion.
“Right. Of course, it would be. I’ve been very happy with his work in our tutoring sessions, and more than that... The truth is, I wanted to talk to you in person because—” Tony leaned forward over his desk. “In addition to being a great kid, Peter is a genius.”
Howard Stark's voice boomed inside his head, reminded him: “Never let them see you cry, boy. Never let them see they’ve got you.”
“You don't,” Tony said, as gently as he could. Rogers’s eyes went sharp, focused. Tony went on: “You think he's smart—really, really smart—and you're proud, because it means he has options. He'll go to college, graduate in four years, maybe go on for his Masters. Good kid. Smart kid. You call him a ‘genius’ out of love, because you're his dad and good parents always think their kid is extraordinary. But Peter
His big hand slid onto Tony’s thigh, up and up, and Tony leaned back with a heavy sigh. The street noise was muffled, the privacy panel up between the driver and the back seat. “What should I call you?” Tony asked.
When the time finally came to call it quits, Peter’s nerves skyrocketed again. He hovered. He was dancing from foot to foot while Tony packed away the last of their equipment and locked the cabinets along the far wall.
“Anytime,” Rogers nodded. That was a hell of a lie, but he was still wearing that small smile. He made a little humming sound, almost nervous, and then clicked his tongue before saying, “Let me give you my number. I’ve got yours from Pete. We can hash out details, come to some kind of agreement about the college courses.”
Steve washed and rinsed his short hair quickly, then scrubbed at the sweat across his chest and under his arms. He could feel the tension in his own shoulders, and he needed to relax enough to sleep. Steve soaped up the fingers of his right hand so that he could try to coax a response out of his tightly-wound body; it always helped quiet the noise, when he could manage it. His cock responded, but his mind wasn’t there. He'd spiraled too deep. Steve closed his eyes, leaned back against the shower wall, and tried to draw up a suitable fantasy.
at materials chemistry until college, I bet, and I don’t want Dad to—to be put off by your jokes and stuff. Okay?”
“Ahhhh—no. No can do. Under normal circumstances, BFF time is the best time. You know this. Right now, though, I need to have sex, and you remain strictly off the menu.”
“What are you going to do, Rhodey?” Tony shot back. Tony Stark always shot back. “You going to knock me out? Throw me over your shoulder, carry me home like your trophy kill?
Steve came. He came hard enough that he had to sit down, curled up awkwardly on the floor of the too-small cast iron tub. He bit hard on his lip to stifle the moan.
He’d barely gotten his stuff into his locker when his cell phone went off, trilling its factory-set ring. (He couldn’t stop Peter and Bucky from messing around with the personal numbers, but insisted they leave his work-related ringtone alone.)
I'm pleasantly baffled any time my fics are bookmarked or subscribed to, and this fic is building subscriptions like I’m offering Gift with Purchase. (Shameless fanfic joke.) Thank you! This fandom is always interesting and engaged, so I don't know why I'm surprised.
“True,” Tony nodded, smiling back. “But you’ll lose it all in legal fees when I bury you in defamation paperwork.”
—was running calculations, probabilities, worst-case scenarios. He couldn’t sort the data into anything useful because it was moving too fast, and his heartbeat was too loud, and he’d just been standing with Rhodey in the lobby of the St. fucking Regis, and none of this made any
That was an awfully hard point to refute, as Tony knew exactly what college did to a 14-year-old. Still, Peter wasn’t Tony. He was kinder, and more cautious, and a hell of a lot closer to his parents. “What
Mass shooting—Steve’s brain shied away. (Of course not. He’d be en route already.) He knocked his skull against the tile once, trying to clear his head.
“Steve,” Tony acknowledged, nervously. He waved Rogers toward the chair on the other side of Tony's desk. “Thank you so much for meeting with me. As I said, Peter’s a great kid. Funny, nerdy, a little quiet until you get to know him, and then,
Tony sighed, and threw back the last of his scotch. “I hire people to listen to me. It’s efficient. Are you coming or not?”
“I like you!” Peter blurted back. They blinked at each other for a moment, and then the kid blushed red. “You’re—I just mean—you’re a really good teacher, Mr. Stark! I’m learning so much! And the stuff we’re talking about isn’t anything like what my friend Ned is covering in his advanced classes, they won’t even be
, they were going to get away with this. They were going to kidnap the most famous man in the country.
“Dad!” Peter interrupted, bounding into the room just as Steve got his coat hung and his shoes toed off. “How was the meeting? Did you like Mr. Stark? Did he say anything about underroos, because he just thinks it’s funny—”
Steve Rogers was painfully stoic; he hadn’t even smiled while Peter babbled his ‘goodbye.’ Whenever Peter talked about his father—before today’s nervous anomaly, at least—he spoke with warm affection. There was love there. Trust. It was hard to picture dorky, chatty Peter connecting with this unexpected Adonis, but Tony figured he’d seen weirder.
Tony grinned his relief as he got to his feet. “Please do. Let me know what you decide. My email is always open.”
He caught Rhodey’s eye one last time before the car door shut, and then watched his best friend turn back inside through the darkly tinted window.
Steve hung his belt in the hall closet he used for his own. He got the shower going, and avoided looking in the mirror. It wasn’t a good day for mirrors.
“Right. That. And Obie’s losing his fucking mind, really, because the DOD are drooling all over themselves, waiting on the Jericho. The fucking Jericho! And what am I supposed to tell them when I don’t deliver? Sorry Uncle Sam, I tested this thing, and it’s scary as shit, and I grew a conscience all of a sudden?”
“I’m going home now, with that man over there. And, potentially, that blonde girl at the bar, if she’s into that kind of thing—”
“Let me take a picture of you kissing me, and you won’t need to pay me,” he smirked. “I’ll eat for a year on the royalties.”
Civil demonstration was pretty unlikely. Steve couldn’t imagine Fury would let them sleep on that sort of thing, were it happening tonight, and he hadn’t been briefed on anything significant upcoming.
, Captain. He's more concerned with fitting in, with convincing everyone that he's a ‘normal’ kid, than he is with his own potential. And I'm sorry, but that...” Tony’s nostril’s flared. “That's something he learned at home: Toxic humility.”
Tony laughed out loud, but wasn’t tool enough to admit that. Lucky Rhodey texted, actually. He had to meet Bruce in less than an hour, and Bruce had very limited tolerance for Tony’s (mostly imaginary) love life. He pulled off his glasses and rubbed both eyes, leaning back precariously in his rolling chair.
Steve flipped both boxes open on the counter next to the stove, and pulled a bag of mixed greens from the fridge. He filled three bowls with lettuce, tossed in a handful of baby carrots, and then stuck his head out the back door to holler for his son.
“I’ll see you at home,” the Captain replied. He wasn’t quite amused, but his eyes were warm. “Tell Ned ‘hello’ for me.”
, holy fuck, and the size of his arms. Tony wanted to shove his dick down that long, tan throat. “What’s your rate, beautiful?”
“You want money? Ransom? I’ll transfer the funds right now. You don’t need to take me anywhere. I’ll give you as much as you want.”
Steve sighed—the annoyed kind—as Peter’s eyes pingponged between them. “He’s handsome, obviously, you’ve seen his picture before. But he’s got no filter, he’s sarcastic, he thinks he knows better than everybody else—”
And it was good. Pete came back inside, pink-cheeked and smiling, and Bucky had cheese trailing from his mouth, stuck to his stubble, and it was
Steve frowned. It’d been more than a month since he’d spoken to Chief Fury directly, and never in his off-hours. He ran a hand over Goldie’s head, absentminded, while his brain cycled through increasingly thorny possibilities.
They adjourned to the living room couch. The dining room table was always covered in projects: Lego starships, 3d puzzles, Pete and Bucky’s epically long games of
He was... yeah, hands-down, the most beautiful human being Tony had ever seen, and he’d slept with actual supermodels, back in the day. This was now, officially, awkward as fuck.
“Wade fucked off again, calling in ‘sick.’” Phillips’s air quotes were the stuff of legend. “I’m stuck here ‘til closing. What’s your excuse?”
Something in Tony flushed hot and cut deep. He leaned into the taller man and dropped his voice, hissing, “Fuck you, Rhodes. Fuck you, and the self-righteous horse you rode in on! I’m not 16 anymore, and you’re not my self-appointed moral compass. Do you know what my week looked like before you got here, yesterday?”
I welcome corrections for spelling, grammar, and the like. Please refrain from concrit comments, as it derails my work (while I obsessively research canon and reevaluate plot because I am a perfectionist with ADHD). But feel free to ask questions and geek out about canon callbacks.
Steve tossed the sweaty uniform into the wash basket and scrubbed a hand through his hair. He didn’t know why he was maudlin today. He just kept hearing Mr. Stark saying ‘
His house was dark, too, but he could hear the TV was on in Bucky’s bedroom down the hall. He called out an all-clear, just in case Bucky was up. Then he got back into the shower, closing weary eyes under the spray.
, do those floodgates open.” Tony stopped himself, wincing a little in self-deprecation. “I can relate to that. You’re obviously doing a great job at home.”
Steve typed out a group text to his team (slowly enough to make Pete twitch), letting them know about the morning meeting. He got back several immediate responses, but didn’t bother waiting for Clint; he’d be waiting all night, and Natasha would make sure his sharpshooter showed up. Goldie watched him patiently as he finally shut off the phone. Steve offered her his wriggling fingers. She licked them twice, then turned toward the door of the gym. “Sure, girl. I’m done here.”
Tony let that declaration sit for a moment before he smiled, a bit apologetically. “You obviously love your son, and you want the best for him, but Steve—” The look on the blond’s face didn’t invite continued informality. Tony recovered with: “Captain. This isn't Peter's best. Not even close. The most he lets himself imagine is an ordinary life. An ordinary life for an extraordinary mind.”
The prodigal escort returned, wool coat slung over one arm. Rhodey smiled at the guy, tightly, and they both followed Tony toward the front lobby of the St. Regis Hotel.
“I actually know that,” Tony agreed as he raised a placating hand. “I don't always, but this time I do. I'm not enjoying this conversation, like,
“I want to say, ‘Looking forward to it,’” Tony said, “but you’ve kind of doom-and-gloomed the whole thing for me.”
The police chief grunted, “Going to need your whole team in the war room, first thing tomorrow. We’ve got a situation.”
Bank robbery? Maybe. If they managed to connect a few to the same crew, that’d definitely be worth Special Ops’ time.
Peter, it seemed, was incapable. He drummed his fingers against the desk. His eyes darted, again and again, to the door. He made an odd little whistling sound between his teeth, until Tony was tempted to gag him with his yellow Hufflepuff scarf.
“We don’t want your money,” Indy told him. The man with the gun took a step back, making room for Tony to exit the hummer.
Where would Indy go? What was he going to tell the police? He was on camera leaving the gala with Tony, wasn’t he? Rhodey had seen the guy, up close and personal. When Obie realized Tony was missing, that was the first place everyone would look.
But Steve had shown up before his surgical transition, and Old Phillips (the owner) never batted an eye. He’d never commented on Steve’s spotty facial hair, his wrapped chest and sloped shoulders—only advised him to increase his protein and try out the rowing machine. When Steve went back to the gym two weeks after top surgery, Phillips only huffed, “Don’t be tearin’ out stitches, you damn fool! Come back when you can lift your hands higher’n your head.”
. But it was the three of them, together, ‘til the end of the line, watching TV and reluctantly eating the salad Steve made.
Tony grabbed the business card, memorizing the phone number almost faster than he could read it. He flipped the card.
Please consider leaving a comment if you're following along, and feeling up to the interaction. I try to respond to every one.
Tony laughed appreciatively, and then moaned as Indy squeezed the head of his cock through his silk boxers. “Do that. Mmm...
(Steve chopped the thought short. It didn’t matter. Mr. Barnes had been dead for twelve years, and he’d loved Steve. In his way.)
“Yeah!” Peter’s brown eyes lit up. “Riri Williams! She’s a freshman at Columbia. Mr. Stark says she reverse-engineered some totally classified tech, and she was supposed to get in trouble, but Mr. Stark heard about it and got her into Columbia instead! Isn’t that cool?”
Steve ignored gender for a moment, because he wasn’t interested in making any more decisions tonight. Instead, he pictured somebody on their knees. His mind’s eye couldn’t see much—tan shoulders, long fingers, dark hair—as the formless partner knelt between his spread legs. Steve flicked his cock softly, imagining a warm tongue. He dug fingernails into his own thigh, imagining they were some other man’s hands.
“We had a good meeting. He’s an interesting guy.” Steve said. He dialed open the gun safe in the dining room closet, and stowed his equipment inside. Peter rocked back and forth on his feet (heel-toe, heel-toe). Steve shot him a raised eyebrow. “You were really that worried?”
. “Even if you don't want to advance him through his other subjects, he's ready for college-level science. I'm the only teacher here who can give him that. I want to. And I’d like to pair him up with one of my students from Columbia, to meet with them both here on campus—Principal Potts has already okayed it, if you agree. Peter should probably advance in math, too, if you're open to it. I can help you find a mathematics tutor from the university, as well. If you want.”
to pull out his phone. Jesus, he was pretty. His jaw was sharp and square, his lips full. Warm brown eyes and black hair, slicked back. Those
him, breathing each other. It’s sweet, it’s perfect. It’s a moment Steve wishes he could bottle up, like a perfume, so it would never fade.
He turns around to find Steve holding a short glass with a very appetizing caramel-colored fluid inside. His brain isn’t fully functional because that’s Steve, looking gorgeous and smiling sheepishly while offering him a glass of his favourite scotch.
Tony starts walking back to the sofa, trying really hard not to stumble or slur and failing miserably at both. “You know, everyone’s always giving
, and that makes Tony uneasy for a second. He doesn’t like that look. “They’ll be here in a few minutes, they left the compound a while ago.”
, apparently!” Steve can’t help raising his voice, throwing his arms in the air and then resting his hands on his hips. His head falls forward as he takes a deep breath, apparently trying to regain some self control. He manages to do so because when he speaks, his voice is a lot softer. “Do you really think I’d ever lay a hand on you?”
Steve blushes as his grin widens, clearly ashamed and taken by surprise at the blunt compliment. Tony wants to jump behind the bar counter and hide there for the rest of the evening.
“I knew you’d break.” He viciously smears the come dripping out of Tony and pushes it back in, hole still loose and open. “But do you know you’ve broken
Tony takes his hand off briefly to maneuver the wheelchair so he’s as close to the bed as he can be and resumes his position, hand lying softly over Steve’s arm. He drifts off as ‘Love Lies’ plays in the background.
“We are!” Steve quickly snaps out of his own sad internal monologue, eyes wide. “We are, Sam. You’re- you’ve been the closest thing to a best friend I’ve had since-” He doesn’t say his name. He can’t deal with that right now. “I just thought… maybe you’d feel uncomfortable around me if- I didn’t want to lose you.”
Natasha lets out a tired breath. “Steve, I've known Stark for a long time now. Studied him, his behaviour, his personality, his severely unhealthy coping mechanisms... I
“There’s nothing there” Tony says, rubbing his eyes in exhaustion. “JARVIS scanned the whole thing when we took it down.”
Steve’s hand travels from his side to his belt, working on it with an uncharacteristic lack of nervousness.
have feelings for you. Even if he’s never said it out loud, his actions speak louder than any words ever could. Stop overthinking this. Take a chance and
Tony’s anger dies down a little, although there’s still a controlled, sad rage behind his eyes. He pushes Steve off with uncanny strength.
But Steve doesn’t move. It’s a little insulting how he’s just standing there looking concerned for him, like he’s not carrying sixty pounds of steel in his arms.
He tried not to think about it but Steve’s look of disappointment and anger was embedded in his mind like a tiny splinter under the skin. Everytime he brushed past the memory it stung like a bitch. He knew what Steve thought about one-night stands and his
Tony’s gaze snaps up and after a second, he frowns, confused. “Why what?” he slurs and Steve feels sickened.
God, he needs to talk to him. He’s not sure what he wants to say, but there’s something heavy weighing on his chest. He definitely wants to yell at him for putting his life at risk by shielding him. He was wearing a suit of armor, for God’s sake! He would have been just
The brunette’s ready to jump on him again but Steve places both hands on his chest. “I don’t mean that. I mean… I don’t want
The second Tony looks down and sees the blond dipping his head down to lap at the head of his cock, he loses it.
Then suddenly, there’d been a voice in the background. A male voice. Steve had snapped his head in the screen’s direction and his gut clenched in an uncomfortable knot.
There’s a loud sound and he feels his body go off the ground and hit the wall. Everything goes dark.
Steve can’t see him, but he just knows Tony is taken aback by this because he falls silent and there’s no sound of footsteps. He’s just standing there, probably trying to figure out what the hell is going on.
Him and Rhodey walk through the big glass doors and immediately Tony’s surrounded by people greeting them. He talks to them as his eyes wander around the room: everything’s been decorated in Christmas fashion since the holiday season has already taken over most of the city and Tony mentally winces.
“I--” Steve really doesn’t want to talk about it but it has nothing to do with trust. He fears if he says it out loud, it’ll become too real to ignore, and he wants to forget what he saw. It hurts a little less if he avoids it. “There’s no reason for me to be angry at Tony.”
“You’re right,” Steve said.  For a moment, he felt heavy.  Weighted down, like he was wearing his armor again.  He could feel his gait change slightly with the sensation, and his hand tightened in the air around a phantom shield. “We weren’t always as we are.  We did only barely survive.  Maybe we won’t next time.  Or the time after that. Maybe you will last until the stars fall again.  Freedom is dangerous, I’ll grant you that.  But, an unjust society knows no true peace.  What you call safety, peace…it’s nothing more than an illusion.”
Which… yeah, Steve sighed.  Sure, it was a trade-off, but still, it had to hurt, and it gutted Steve to think of Tony hurting over what people like this who had no idea what he was like dissecting his every more and syllable.  If these idiots on TV knew Tony at all, they’d know how hard he was trying to do what was right.  Maybe find a bit of redemption, if that was even a thing these days, not that Steve really thought Tony needed it.  Steve was willing to bet none of the people on the TV had ever had to watch young men and women die because of a war that served only the enterprise of war itself.  Tony was
“No,” Bruce replied. “Didn’t make it that far.  Met people who were going, though. Or trying to. Crossing the Dark Sea isn’t easy, even if you make it to a safe port and find a ship willing to risk angering the rest of the world by doing it. Etta and Xaros are sending out patrols, did you know that?”
“Yeah,” Steve replied.  He sighed and ran a hand through his hair.  His stomach swooped, then twisted.  “Hard to believe it’s real.”
“So…you’re saying we left quirky behind and blew right through to eccentric?” Tony asked, then leaned up on his toes and pressed a light kiss to Steve’s lips.
Unfastening the clasp at the rear of the circle of metal, Tony pulled it aloft and tossed it on the bed.  Steve blinked at the sudden loss of weight, with an accompanying feeling of being revealed in a way that headdress had protected today.  He sees me, Steve thought with a light, buzzing sensation filling his ears, disconcerting him for a moment.
,” Steve ground out as a white-hot anger spike through him, followed by surprise that the King had apparently taken some kind of interest in him, enough to ask Zola in the first place.
“Lucky week more like it,” Stane said.  He tossed his own bet into the Don’t Come pile, essentially betting against Steve’s roll.  Steve rolled an eleven and the woman next to him whooped excitedly.
“Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Steve!  What the---???  We’re going to get arrested. This…this has to be illegal.  Somehow.  Damaging a…a state forest.  Or something.  Fuck.  What the—what the hell were you thinking?” Tony demanded, voice rising in panic.  “How did you even—how?  That’s not possible.  Shit.  Holy shit, Steve.  We’re in so much trouble.  Fuck.  It wasn’t even in neutral.  This isn’t possible.”
And really, why should he be in there?  It wasn’t his place just because of what happened between them.  Sure, they’d gotten better with each other since New York, and particularly, in the time since Steve and the rest of the Avengers moved into the Tower.  Hell, next to Bruce, he probably spent about as much time with Steve as anyone, going over some of the tech upgrades or helping him work the new gadgets Tony provided to the team, dissecting missions, coming up with ideas for what the team might be able to use in the field, or some problem that needed Tony’s help to fix, that kind of thing.
Steve tried to nod without thinking, but the movement just sent another burst of pain through his nipples, so he stilled himself and watched Tony.  Tony grinned, all wolf’s teeth in the firelight, Steve thought, a shiver running over his skin.  It would not be soft and easy this time, the way it sometimes was with Tony, but hard and brutal, because Steve was here to be used, all open and ready like this.  This was his punishment for leaving Tony’s bed.  To be literally chained to it and used the way Tony wanted, not even able to use his voice for anything other than the little sounds of pleasure Tony liked, to be able to control how much pain was worth whatever he could manage to do with his body other than to lay there and take it.
Water’s not like that, Steve thought sometimes, when the therapist sat quietly with her legs crossed and her heel swaying slightly as she waited.   He thought she knew most people didn’t like silence, wanted to fill it, ride it out on nerves and pressure, but he had kept quiet, kept still, kept low and hunched, for far longer than the SHIELD-mandated hour he had each week with her.
He wondered if Tony even liked the soaps.  Or cared.  Probably not, he thought, poking at the slightly dry chicken with his plastic fork.  It wasn’t like they were anything special.  He should get Tony something special.  Stop obsessing about the soaps.  It was just, he didn’t buy a lot of things on his own. Someone at SHIELD did most of that for him, and he let them, because he didn’t want to explain it was all so overwhelming and different and just the act of making a decision about which soap to get nearly had him breaking down in the middle of the canned food aisle.  Probably not what they wanted to hear about Captain America. Not exactly confidence-inspiring.
“You don’t have to like it, Tony.  It’s okay.  I keep…sorry.  Sorry, nevermind.  We’ll just…we’ll find you something else,” Steve replied, glancing out the window at the house, then forward, where Happy was studiously scrolling through his phone, having gone temporarily deaf, apparently.
Whoever lived here, however strange such a person may be and whatever their intent towards him, Steve couldn’t avoid the wave of pity that washed over him as he watched the little owl in its golden cage. How sad must it be to have your only friend be one you created? Would they be so driven to reach out that he resorted to something nefarious?  Would they refuse to help Steve? Steve hoped that wasn’t the case, but solitude created its own monsters.  There was no need for fairy tales.  Of course, none of that mattered if he couldn’t find whoever it was who lived in this strange place. The owl hooted again and clicked its wings once more, as Steve dropped his hand from the cage with a defeated sigh.
“It—it is,” Tony said.  “Nice.  It is nice.  It’s not fancy or, you know.  Like this.  But…it’s nice.  I—we—have a deck.  Steve, he put a telescope out there for me.  There’s a pond.  We keep our pet fish there.”
“Can I, ah, can I get a picture of the two of you? If it’s not too much trouble?” the man asked.  “It’s for the Vegas Sun.”
you.  He will be so pleased to see you today.  He will think you the most beautiful sight.  He always does.  I can tell.  Now, you must get ready,” Cam continued, shaking the robe a bit in encouragement.
“Just…do what he says, okay, son?  It’ll be easier if you just go along with it.  Don’t—don’t make this harder on yourself than it needs to be,” Howard admonished, though he wouldn’t look at Tony.  There was something lacing his voice that on anyone else, Tony would have called sorrow, but there was too much belligerent hope there, too.
“Think these are done?” Tony asked, lifting the lid and poking a long, two-pronged fork into the center of one of the hamburger patties where it sizzled.
His Omega was unhappy and wouldn’t look at him and wanted to sleep, just sleep, with him and would just meet him back at the Tower, no big deal.  Except that it meant he was going to leave Tony after a battle, after he’d been in danger and something could’ve happened, and he was just going to walk away and
“This is…personal.  The, ah, detoured weapons thing is completely separate. Where’s our internal investigation on that stand, anyway?  That’s taking way too long.  Ask Obie for an update, would you?” Tony asked.  He glanced over at Steve, who was cradling his backpack in his lap and seemingly distracted by the myriad seat options.
Not like when he made his escape, anyway, Steve thought bleakly. Tony had warned him what would happen if he tried such a thing. Had Tony suspected, even then? Did he now? Steve wasn’t sure. He wasn’t sure if Tony would let himself think it, even if he was clever enough to guess Steve’s mind. Perhaps his saving grace, in the end, was that Tony didn’t want it to be true.
He’s dating, Tony thought numbly, running his thumb up and down over the stack of chips in front of him, feeling the ridges rub against his skin.  He asked Nat to set him up.  Barely a day after breaking it off with Tony.  Moving on awfully quickly there, Cap, Tony accused silently.  Anne from R&D…Anne from R&D…Anne from R&D needed to get a big new project.  At the Shanghai facility.  He looked up guiltily at the thought, though no one except Rhodey was paying him any mind.  Rhodey was watching him with a sharp, fierce look that held something too close to pity for Tony to return.
“You were so good, sweet one.  So good for me,” Tony rasped out, voice thick and heavy to Steve’s ears.  He bent over and took Steve’s mouth, tongue thrusting in deep, swirling and curling around Steve’s, exploring unhurriedly until he finally drew back, and wet his own lips with Steve’s taste.
He checked down the hall again, but nothing had changed. Well. He couldn't just stand there in the kitchen all night, he thought with a frustrated grimace. Picking his steps carefully as he went, he passed Steve's door, and made his way into his room. He stood there on the threshold of his room, feeling foolish as he rocked back and forth on his feet, unsure whether or not he should shut the door.
“Steve.  I’m coming at this as someone who watched what being without you did to him.  You don’t want this?  You want to turn your back on this man that I know—I
Slowly, Anto tapped at the lion, then pointed at Steve.   Steve’s mouth turned down and his brow drew together in wrinkly lines.  Anto couldn’t help stare at it for a moment, then mimicked him and felt his own brow.  It, too, felt wrinkly. No wonder the clan thought he looked odd, he thought, blinking at Steve.  Tapping the lion, he pointed at Steve again. “Seev,” Anto said.
“Exactly.  See?  You finish my sentences.  We’re, what do they call it? In sympatico,” Tony said, snapping his fingers and pointing at Steve.  “So, we’ll just have our date, wave to the crowd, take some pictures, et cetera, et cetera.  Nothing really all that different from the past couple of nights, right? Except for the explicit acknowledgment of feelings.  Which we are both having.  That…that might make it different.  Maybe.  A little.  I don’t know. But, don’t be nervous, because we’re only going to be watched by everyone in the restaurant, a bunch of people online, the Vegas police, the FBI, my murderous pseudo-Uncle, and probably a few terrorists.  So, you know. Relax.”
“Would you like that?  Your mouth on me, your tongue, cleaning up the mess that is there because of you?” Tony asked, all husky-voiced.  Steve didn’t know how to answer, so he didn’t, just dropped his eyes, and he thought that was okay, too, by the soft, approving hum that vibrated through Tony’s chest.  “You would be gorgeous, no doubt.  Your pleasure is beautiful to behold, my darling.  Brighter than the sun warming the sands.  I don’t imagine I will ever tire of seeing it.”
Tony looked down at the watch that glinted from his wrist.    It wasn’t exactly what he hoped for, but it was undeniably beautiful.  He should probably start looking at other things the same way.  Be satisfied with something unexpected and wonderful in its own right, and quit wanting things he couldn’t have.
“So, I’ll be bleeding out slowly, instead of quickly, then,” Tony said, a spasm of pain contorting his features as he shifted to look down at the gash.  “You ever think the things we’re grateful for leave a lot to be desired these days?
“Tony, whatever it is, I mean it, you can tell me,” Steve replied as gently as he could because whatever it was, Tony was clearly deeply upset about it.
“No idea what you mean.  I hate him already,” Tony grated out through his teeth.   Rhodey just shook his head and rubbed at his chin with one hand, trying to cover a fond smile.
It was the evening of the fourth day, just after Steve checked the last of the seed stores to make sure no vermin found a way in, that Steve ended up at the point where the road diverged.  Wagon grooves in neat, parallel lines pointed off towards town, while a stone-strewn, overgrown path cut between two large boulders that towered above Steve’s head.  That wouldn’t have been so disturbing, except that he had no memory of how he came to be there.
“Shut the fuck up, Stark!” he heard Decker shout from down the hall.  Tony’s mouth flattened into a thin line as he shot Steve an annoyed look.  Steve rolled his eyes, but shook his head slightly in apology.
“I’m gonna get shit-faced tonight, pretend it never happened, and tomorrow, I’m finally going to buy my guy something nice,” Brock told him.
“I’ve already arranged things.  With SHIELD.  In case something happens,” Steve cut in before Tony could ask more about what had happened.
“What is this?  Tony?” Jarvis replied.  Tony could hear the frown in his voice.   It made it worse and better, though he didn’t know how that could quite work.  “Tony, answer me please.”
“Where’s he going now?” Fury asked uselessly over the intercom as Tony let go of Steve’s hand, which he’d been holding through the pass-through slot, and stalked to the door of the observation room.
“I think I have to at least go see him one more time,” Steve was saying as he shoveled a forkful of eggs into his mouth while an anchorwoman chatted on the television about an upcoming festival causing potential traffic delays.
He wouldn’t have wanted Brock to do it.  That was the rub.  If Tony had aimed his offer at Brock, Steve would have told him exactly where he could shove that kind of offer.  He didn’t want Brock to do that with Tony.  Steve blinked and frowned down at his hands curled into his lap while Brock snored softly next to him.  He didn’t want Brock to do that with anyone was what he meant.  It was just weird to think about Brock with Tony, that was all, since Tony didn’t seem to like Brock very much.  Of course, he didn’t really know Brock, not like Steve did, and if Tony did get to know him… actually, something told Steve time would not really fix Tony’s impression of Brock.  Which bothered him.  Steve wasn’t sure why Tony’s disdain for Brock bothered him so much, but it did.
“Look at me,” Tony’s voice commanded loudly into his ear, and Steve’s eyes snapped open finding Tony’s steady gaze like a beacon. “This is me, making you feel this way. Me, Steve. Who loves you more than anything. I’ve got you. Give this to me, Steve. Let me, please. Please, let me.”
“Now, we’re talking,” Tony said cheekily. “Look, gorgeous, it’s not using me if I want it. Pretend there’s no, ah, transaction involved, if that helps.”
“Oh.  Right,” Steve replied, frowning a bit, then shaking his head with a small, light laugh.  “So, they are.”
. I am, quite literally, going to tear this ship apart.  Oh, I’ll put it back together, don’t worry,” Tony said at Steve’s slightly alarmed look. “I’m just saying, I’m a lot to handle.”
“That does sound like a good plan.  Doesn’t it?  What do you think?” another voice said, this one a lot deeper and steadier than the other two.
“You really aren’t going to report on this whole thing with me and Steve?” Tony asked with a skeptical wince.
Tony pulled his cock almost all the way out, then thrust in hard as Steve’s cock spasmed in his hand.  Steve felt the sudden warm rush of Tony spilling himself inside him. Tony went still, groaned, head tossed back as he came.  His hips juddered, and he thrust in a few more times, chasing the feeling, then let his head fall forward against Steve’s back, breathing hard and heavy.
“Okay, so, can I just say that, a lot of what you may have possibly heard, that was probably from the TV,” Barnes said, holding up his good hand in front of himself.
“Which works out, because Tony loves it when Steve’s all protective and doting.  Eats it up.  Probably because no one really had his back when he was a kid, so he associates someone taking care of him with showing their love, and all that demonstrative crap makes him feel more comfortable in the relationship,” Rhodey said.
“No shooting the other Avengers,” Steve admonished as he opened his book back to the page he’d been reading.
“Must have—“ Steve began, then broke off as Tony’s hands came up to wrap around the curve of Steve’s waist where the skin was bare.  “Been difficult for you to endure,” Steve managed, swallowing thickly around the last as Tony’s hands moved up, light fingers tracing over Steve’s ribs, then down his arms, threading through his hands and over his thighs.
He looked away, then let his gaze trail back to the creature.  It was watching him with a careful, sad-eyed look. Again, Steve wondered how much it really understood.
“Ignore him.  He lost his sense of amusement along with all his hair,” Josiah said, pantomiming a whisper to Cam behind his hand.
“Haven’t enjoyed a meal more since this cheeseburger I had a year or so ago,” Tony replied as he approached. He took a moment of pleasure watching the Chef’s face squelch together with the effort not to comment on that one.  Smiling, Tony threaded his arm through Steve’s, mainly because he could, hell, was even supposed to when you got down to it, though he recognized he was more than a little buzzed from the champagne.  “Feel like rolling the dice, gorgeous?”
“Literally, nothing has shown that wouldn’t work, and you can’t tell me it’s a worse idea than Nat and her poetry slam thing,” Tony smiled gamely at Steve’s lame attempt to reset the mood. “Alright, so, this never happened, I wasn’t here, blah, blah, blah.”
“I don’t mean to make it an argument, Tony,” Steve said, running a hand through his hair and shifting a bit in his chair.
“Just see the world the way you want it to be instead of how it is?” Tony demanded, cutting him off.  “Do not make more of this than it is, Steve. I’ve no wish to regret the gesture. But, that is all it is.  A gesture. No,” Tony said sternly, holding up a hand when Steve opened his mouth to argue. “Enough. Speak of something else.”
, just as he was. He didn’t know what that made him. Perhaps he was just as unnatural as Tony, to want something like this, but he couldn’t bring himself to care, not when pleasure coursed through him like a raging river, washing everything else away.
“Predictive technology and varying degrees of digital access and why we screwed the pooch on that in Afghanistan. Not what a journal said, what
“Stop,” Steve ordered in a sharp, whip-cracked tone.  Rumlow flinched.  Steve found he liked that. He wasn’t sure who he was talking to.  Probably himself.  The Anthony who haunted him, with his pasted-on smile and terrible suit and small act of defiance that said more than either of those, was gone, and Rumlow was staring at him, wide-eyed.
“Really?  That’s…that’s great, Tony,” Steve said with obvious relief.  “Does that mean you found something to connect Stane to the weapons?”
“Yeah, oh,” Tony repeated.  “Actually, we, ah.  After some discussion with management,” Tony began, taking the last step onto the landing.  “It’s just not the right time for this kind of major restructuring.  The stock would take at least a forty-point hit, and we have outstanding contracts that need our resources.  This, the reactor thing, it’s not even more than a prototype, and…well, it’s just not the right time.  Maybe one day, you know?”
To Steve’s surprise, there was a woman at the door. She was older, middle-aged, he would guess, short and round, almost like one of those people in the Wizard of Oz, not that Steve would ever say that, though she wore a crisp suit and blue spectacles that made her eyes look a bit like a fish’s.
Tony hadn’t made him feel like that, though.  Not once.  Well, not until the next morning, anyway, and that wasn’t something Steve could really hang on Tony.  It was his own insecurities doing that to him.  But, certainly,
The next morning, his shoulder was considerably better and his resolve was strong.  He shortened his morning run a bit, but still did it, took a quick shower that was only a shower and made it down to the kitchen in time to have breakfast with most of the team.  It was a little after nine, and Steve knew from experience that Tony wouldn’t make it down for a bit.  Steve eyed the dwindling coffee.  Seeing Clint set his empty cup on the table, Steve grabbed the coffee pot and poured the last bit into one of Tony’s obnoxious “Kiss Me, I’m Iron Man” mugs.  Sure enough, a bit later, Tony stumbled in, looking blearily at the room, raising a questioning eyebrow at Steve, who responded with a succinct, “Better.”
“Hey, Tony,” Steve whispered over the wind that was washing through the branches above in long, lazy gusts.
“It—he’s lost a lot of blood,” Bruce said carefully.  Too carefully.  It was the caution, that beat of hesitation that burned a crater through Tony’s gut. In that second, he thought he might hate Bruce.  Really and truly hate him and his willingness to give in so damn quickly. Tony wanted to rage at him, demand he stop being so fucking careful and just say it.  Say Steve was going to be fine.
Anto didn’t know why he was thinking of the grass-bear now, when he had a job to do, though probably because the man was making that face at him again. He bent over to look at the man’s leg where the gashes were now long, thick welts of skin, clearly visible, but no longer the angry red color they had been for so long.  The man pointed at his leg, then made a sound. A word. It was a pleased-sound, that much Anto could tell. Curious, even. He wanted to tell the man that he hadn’t been sure that would work, but the skin had refused to stay together in a simple wrap and brace, and the idea had occurred to him as he watched one of the other Omegas force a long, thin branch in and out of a deer’s bladder to hold the end open while it dried.  He wanted to tell the man that he had splinted his leg to keep him from moving it too much and tearing the careful stitches, but that it was ready now, he thought.
He sucked in a sharp breath that squeezed his lungs and echoed in the car with a soft gasp that he hadn’t meant to let escape.  The watch was…extraordinary.  He could see that immediately.  Not just a little, not just in the way something beautiful catches the eye, but in the way the right thing, the perfect thing, the thing you wanted but didn’t know you wanted until you saw it, is instantly recognizable.  It was the solution part of an equation falling into place after staring at the numbers until they shifted to truth.  It was the sky on a clear night from the corner of his window where he could see the universe over the hedges.  It was the smell of lemons under everything, the feel of a finely starched shirt under tweed, even on hot days, rough against his cheek.  Right.  Perfect.  Something that belonged to him in a way that the rest of the world would never be allowed to.
“I don’t know what I’m doing,” Tony admitted, pressing his face into Steve’s shoulder so the words came out muffled.  “I know it’s crazy.  I
Tony looked up at Steve, caught his eyes for a moment, blue and watery in the morning glare, and was hit with a sudden, ferocious surge of want. Not sexual, not really.  Or, not only, Tony amended.  He wanted this, with Steve, this thing where he woke up and Steve was there, and they talked about their day and maybe flirted a bit, except with slightly less international espionage and more kissing.  He just had to get from Point A to Point Steve Forgives Him For Being A Massive Douche For a Couple Decades Culminating In the Deaths of God Knows How Many of Steve’s Fellow Soldiers.
“God, you’re the most perfect thing I’ve ever seen,” Tony breathed out in a rough scrape of a voice that sounded like steel against a sharpening wheel.  “Beautiful.  So beautiful.  My soldier.  Look at you, God, you’re so good, Steve, so, so, good, my treasure, mine, my beautiful one,” Tony chanted, eyes glazed over, hand’s holding Steve’s cheeks in an iron grip. He was rocking his hips hard into Steve’s mouth, quick, stuttering thrusts that left Steve breathless and choking, the pain in his nipples singing through his muscles and deep down, deeper still, behind his cock, where his balls drew up and tightened.
“I hardly think I’m one to ask about the provenance of the divine as to who you can love,” Tony chuckled ruefully, then canted his head to the side and smiled softly at Steve.  “I know that I love you.  I am not a man, not anymore, but...I hardly think a god who would deny what is between us is worth worshipping.”
“Do you believe the universe fights for souls to be together?” Tony asked, trying to keep his voice steady and tell himself the answer wasn’t everything.
It was part of the deal they all made to do this, that one day, they may go out on a mission and not come back. Or worse, one of the team wouldn’t come back. You had to make peace with that. He knew that. Hell, he’d
“If any of those people cared more about him than the mission, I’ll eat that drone in there.  That I…totally did not take from Research,” Tony said.
It took Tony a full three heartbeats to understand what she was implying.  He counted, because he could hear them in his head, pounding against the base of his skull behind his hears.
There were, in fact, four suits waiting for him at the Hotel Galaxy’s front desk when Steve stopped to ask about deliveries.  Steve tried a couple on and settled on a deep blue one that seemed to fit the best.  Brock whistled appreciatively when he stepped out of the bathroom, so Steve figured it was good enough.
“No!  I’m not Newt.  I’m…Hicks. And Bishop. Kind of.  Anyway,” Tony shrugged.  “I’d just shout ‘Airlock’ at him, and he’d get it.”
Steve honestly wasn’t sure what to think.  He looked back at Happy, waiting nonchalantly by the car.  Bucky and Clint shrugged.
“It’s---alright, fine.  Fine.  My mom has the Mercedes version of it, you know.  Guilt is a really expensive habit, fair warning.  But, you know, whatever.  It’s good.  I love it.  Really,” Tony spat out in a near-shout.  “You don’t have to.  Just.  There’s that. You don’t have to.  I’d rather…if you do stuff like this, then I have to know, okay?  I can’t…look the other way.  Its sitting in my garage, and I
This was about Tony.  He really should’ve seen that little TED talk coming a mile away.  They wanted to talk to Steve.  They wanted to tell him things, for his own good, of course.  This was about how they were like Steve, how they understood Steve, and just wanted to help, because they were all on the same side here.  The side of keeping things as they should be.  Everything in its place and a place for every thing.
He finally cut the water off and stepped out, wrapping a towel from the rack around his hips and using a smaller one to rub the excess water from his face and hair.  Swiping a hand over the glass to clear the condensation, he stared at his reflection in the mirror for a long moment, studying his face and deciding it was probably a good idea to shave.  A few days’ growth of stubble had resolutely appeared along his chin and jaw in awkward spikes of various sizes.  He thought it might not look bad if he let it grow in, but right now, it just looked like Dr. Seuss drew on his face with a fine-pointed sharpie.
Steve stared at him, trying to see if his mind could come up with something, but while the guy looked somewhat vaguely familiar, like something he’d glimpsed out of the corner of his eye, but never really seen, he was drawing a blank.  “No, sorry.  Sorry, I just don’t really have time to…pay attention to…” and he really didn’t know how to finish.
“Yeah.  Well, just one.  For now,” Steve said carefully, still sculpting his rice.  Honestly, it was just annoying.
Steve watched her walk away until she disappeared around a corner, then slowly ducked back into the elevator, letting the doors slide shut.  Was that true?  He thought back to his meeting with Tony’s parents.  His mother had been...concerned.  That was one way of putting it, anyway.  And yet, she had apparently been in favor of Tony Bonding with Steve just as much as the father had.  Maybe even moreso, just...in a different way.  He frowned, remembering what Tony had said about his father.  About his father and alcohol.  What would Tony think? Would he hate that Steve could do this?  That he
“I was thinking,” Steve began, glancing quickly over at Shellhead, who seemed to be staring off at nothing, preoccupied with his own thoughts.  “I was thinking that tomorrow, we head back.”
“They just say that stuff about you because they don’t really know you,” Steve said with such easy assurance it almost made it believable.
Steve could hear the lie, but didn’t challenge it.  They wouldn’t talk about it. The time wouldn’t come.  His secret was valuable to Fury in some unfathomable way.  Part of some chess match Fury was playing where Steve was a piece to move around, and Anthony… Anthony probably didn’t even register as a pawn.
Steve had been adamant that the animal had to be sent on its own until he came back from hunting one morning and found Dummy standing between Tony and a hungry lynx, hackles raised, a fierce growl rumbling from his chest. From that day forward, Dummy was a part of their own, strange little pack, even if Steve didn’t say anything.
“You’re all loose for me,” Tony observed.  Steve made some kind of sound in the back of his throat. It was all he was capable of at the moment.  He sucked in a sharp breath, then arched his back so hard he half expected to hear a snap as Tony breached his hole with a piece of ice.  Coldness seeped into him, sending a shiver cascading up his back as the ice started to melt inside him while Tony rubbed the excess around Steve’s rim with his thumb.
Steve shut the door on the Bucky and Clint still arguing about proper candy etiquette and walked down the stairs and out of the building.  Happy was waiting at the curb next to a vaguely European-looking car that Steve couldn’t identify for the Tony car bingo he was mentally playing.  He’d put Ferrari in the center square before he really got a chance to know Tony, and now realized he should’ve gone with an Audi or something more like a Saleen or Shelby.
“Love you, too, Tony,” Steve replied, lifting his head enough to place a quick kiss on the tip of Tony’s nose. “I want you to know how much. Let me show you. Please,” Steve added, sounding nervous, but there was an eagerness under it that made Tony’s breath catch in his throat. “Let me.”
This one isn’t quiet, Steve thought to himself, and felt his chest tighten with warmth.  Troublemaker, Steve mentally repeated, the thought almost seeming to float in his head on a bubble of a laugh.
“You would just follow me,” Steve said, remembering Bucky’s words. A smile started to curve his mouth at that, what had once seemed impossibly absurd having the air of the inevitable now. Tony would do it, too, Steve thought with a surge of fondness. But, he shouldn’t have to follow. He would let Steve lead, but he would always see the world from a vantage Steve knew he could not. I will walk the path, Steve though, but Tony was made to fly above the world, and you can only truly see where you are going when you have both.
He turned the shower off and stood there dripping in the steamy air for a moment, letting his skin cool.  Happy Alpha, happy life.  What a fucking crock of shit. Whose happy life?
One of the guards opened the carriage door and set a small step down on the ground outside.  Cam hopped out first, then waited dutifully outside the carriage for one of the servants to extend the carpet to the carriage.  He held out his hand then for Steve to climb down.  Steve honestly wasn’t sure if he could walk, let alone do so with any dignity.  It was far worse now than when they’d stopped for a relief break earlier, and Steve had barely managed to make it to the copse of trees for a moment’s privacy before he collapsed against the side of a big oak.
Pain stabbed through him, and he jumped, his legs instinctively would have closed, but Tony’s hands held him firmly apart.  He felt a pull, just underneath the pain, a heady rush of release, and then a spike of pleasure all the way down the length of his cock.  Steve reached blindly for Tony’s head, winding his hands into Tony’s hair and holding him there as Tony drank.
Okay, that wasn’t fair, either.  He couldn’t put this on Tony. Tony already put too much on himself, and it wasn’t like Tony had done anything wrong, no matter what he thought.  Steve was an adult, he made his own decisions. All Tony did was make an offer.  It was hardly Tony’s fault that Steve was...confused. Tony was...he was wonderful and caring and--and anyone would be lucky to be with him. He certainly didn’t need to be doing this kind of thing if he craved companionship or...whatever his reasons were.  He could just...meet someone.  Do this with them.
“I knew I liked Stan,” Tony remarked with a huff of a laugh, looking up at Steve, who was hovering between the sofa and the door, like he wasn’t quite ready to go.  He stood up and walked the few steps to his small kitchen, before lifting his gaze back to Steve.  Watching Steve walk out was not high on the list of images he liked to have, but, well. Woo.  Slow.  All that jazz.  “Goodnight, Steve.”
“Zola does not want him to know that you were sent to Lord Hammer,” Kadina said.  “There are many things Zola does not want the King to know.  There are many things other people do not want him to know.”
“Good Tony,” Tony mumbled, twisting his head to the side and closing his eyes against the onslaught of sensation.
“He thinks this is some reaction to trauma kind of deal.  Wants me to talk to someone. Says he knows a guy who specializes in—“ Tony stopped.  Swallowed.  Tasted sand and had to resist the urge to spit.  Someone who specializes in captivity trauma.   Refugees.  POWs.  “Things like what happened.”
“Well, this was…unexpected. Definitely.  But, fun,” Tony announced, gaze darting around the room for a bit before finally settling on Steve for a quick moment.  “You ever need a cheap model comfortable with casual nudity, let me know.  For a good time call, and all that.”
“No, he does not say these things. Not to me.  General Rhodes, perhaps,” Cam said.  “Everyone, they want something from him, you know?  Even now, they are all crawling around the Castle like ants, hoping for a crumb before he leaves.  He gives you things so that you do not ask. I think, he does not want you to ask. Not you.  Me, this is okay,” Cam finished, wobbling his head a bit as he considered it.
This was his purpose, and it was so clear, so very clear—it was pure, and true and right, he thought, and maybe for the first time understood what that really meant. Steve, their family, if they got to have that, the team, what they could do together, this was what mattered, not the right foods or right kind of towels or all the pillows in the world—well, those were actually fairly important, come to think. But, point being, this, this thing that welled up between them and existed as if it had a space of its own and made them more than what they had been before…this was purpose, his purpose,
“You’re doing so good, my beautiful one,” Tony whispered, voice low and almost melodic, Steve thought.  Like there was a tune to it that Steve couldn’t place, but it distracted him from everything else for a moment.  “You look so gorgeous, with my cock tucked so nice and warm in your mouth.  It feels amazing like that.  I love looking down at you while I work, seeing your mouth stretched around me, keeping me warm and ready,” he continued, stroking a hand through Steve’s hair, then down the side of his face, cupping his cheek, the way Steve liked.  He wanted to lean in, but he wasn’t supposed to move, so he didn’t, but felt the pressure of Tony’s hand, a little harder than usual, as he held it there, and that was close enough.  “You’re perfect, Steve.  So good for me, even though I know it is difficult.  But, you’re doing so well.  A little while longer.  Can you do that for me?  Tap my leg if you can.”  Steve tapped the side of Tony’s leg, though it took a moment to get his hand to cooperate with what his mind was trying to tell it to do.  He could stay like this.  He would.  It hurt, he ached, he wanted to move, but he wanted to be good for Tony even more than any of that.  “Good.  Good, Steve.  You’re taking it so well, look at you.  So still and good for me.  You’re beautiful, truly, my love.  So beautiful like this.  So very good.”
“And you,” Peggy continued, rounding on Maria, who flattened her hand against her throat.  “How long has this been going on?”
“There is a gift waiting for you in your rooms.  Something to occupy the long hours without my company,” Tony told him with a sideways grin.
The problem was, however twisted things had gotten between him and Steve, God knows he’d never quite managed
“I flew,” Tony rasped through a mouth that tasted like sand and blood.  He squinted up against the glare of the sun haloing Steve’s face where he knelt in front of him.  Hands, warm and soft and familiar, cradled the sides of his head, while deft fingers gingerly poked and prodded.  Tony slumped forward and let his head rest against Steve’s chest, breathing in a long, shuddering breath that was half-sob, one hand winding into the bulk of Steve’s uniform, just below the star.
“That...that wasn't...” Tony began, turning around in a circle on the sidewalk because he didn't know what the hell was happening, so three circles and just sitting the fuck down and breathing into a paper bag sounded like a great plan. “He's got a box of stuff. Like, stuff about me. Us,” Tony told Rhodey, a frown forming as he glanced back down the street, looking for someone who was definitely otherwise occupied, doing exactly what Tony had asked of him.
“Yeah,” Steve said, rubbing the back of his hand lightly across his cheek where it puffed up, “I was heading back here, and who I assume was this Batroc guy and a few of his friends jumped me in an alley not too far from here,” Steve told him.  “Speaking of, JARVIS, can you let the police know there are some men in the alley behind the NoMad they need to pick up?”
“Lie to the public, Tony.  About a personal relationship.  Generally, nothing illegal about that,” Matt responded.
“I won’t make the same mistake with you,” Steve replied. Stane just let out a low huff of a laugh and crossed his arms over his chest, regarding Steve with an assessing look that somehow managed to fill Steve’s stomach with dread.  This man was evil, maybe not in the wild, terrible way Schmidt had been, but his soul was just as black, only he could hide it far better.  Steve thought that might be the more terrifying side of evil, the one that didn’t hold you at swordpoint, but instead, held out its hand as a friend.
“Steve, he…” Tony began, dragging his eyes back to Jarvis, mouth curling into a grimace.  Tony pressed his lips together, feeling his jaw tighten.  His throat clicked as he swallowed.  The urge to roll his eyes, crack a joke or otherwise deflect was nearly overwhelming.  Saying it out loud, that made it more true somehow, like the world would absorb the knowledge and reorder itself around it.  It could never be taken back, not really, not once it was said.
Steve sighed again and raked a hand through his wet hair.  The boy wasn’t wrong, Steve knew.  This…distance between him and Tony wasn’t sustainable if Steve had any hope of getting out of the city, Steve told himself.  That was the easier story to tell himself for why he so desperately wanted to seek Tony out, to explain, to soothe, to—he didn’t know.  The idea of Tony in pain, hurting because of Steve’s words, even if they carried truth, it didn’t sit well with him.  His own nights were fitful, plagued by lack of sleep, long stretches of aching need without release and dreams of cold hands pulling at him, covering his mouth until he woke up choking on air and reaching for a warmth next to him that was no longer there.
Steve would be here soon, and undoubtedly freak out. Not without a modicum of justification, Tony could admit. His mouth curled into a rueful, slightly annoyed grimace at the thought. Coulson had probably already filled Steve in on the details, so there was no point in trying to put a spit-shine on things. He hadn't only dug his own grave, he'd bought the shovel and headstone. Here lies Tony Stark. He was given an inch and took a mile.
“Good?  I think good.  I’m sure I’ll get my Yelp review from Barnes later.  ‘Didn’t totally fuck it up.  Four out of five almost-exes would still recommend ghosting him.’  But it seemed to go well,” Tony said with a shrug.  “I need to be back at five,” Tony told him, glancing down at the watch on his wrist.  “Take me back to the Tower for now.  I’m feeling inspired.”
“He will probably slit your throat in the night,” Bucky said, turning to regard the Omega, who was looking between them, eyes wide, words Steve didn’t understand tumbling out of his mouth while Yinsen tried to tell the Omega what Steve said.
After missions mostly, when they both were wired with unspent energy, still walking some line too close to death to call life.  Sometimes after Steve got back from one of his many fruitless Where’s Bucky? searches.  Cap was like a fucking gerbil on a wheel when it came to Barnes, not that Tony paid that much attention.  But when he returned, inevitably Barnes-less, Tony would find himself announcing that he was going to his workshop, and sure enough, like clockwork, Cap would show up sometime later. Tony would have himself loose and open already, slick and waiting, or maybe push Cap down on the workshop sofa, get down on his knees and pretend this was something they both wanted for other reasons than whatever it really was.  Point being, things had been fine between them. True, Cap didn’t come around for the other stuff as much, or, well, at all, when you got right down to it, which, admittedly, was probably for the best, considering they’d both agreed to keep this whole thing between the two of them by the simple inaction of not saying anything.
“I was thinking sofa,” Rogers responded with a laugh.  “But, I’ll put it on the list,” Steve promised, and damn if he didn’t pull out a small spiral notebook and write it down.  “So, ah, Coulson.  He’ll take care of getting the cabin stocked, and we’ll have your things packed up and sent over.  Anything else you need, just let him know.  He’ll take care of it.”
“It’ll be alright, Tony,” Steve said, leaning low, next to Tony’s ear.  He took Tony’s hand and gave it a soft squeeze.  Tony nodded, then cast a furtive, grateful look up at Steve.
“Ayuh, I guess I do,” Steve nodded.  “Am I dreaming?” Steve asked. It seemed a reasonable question.  This whole night was unquestionably unusual, and Steve had always had vivid dreams.  Peggy used to say he lived a greater life in his dreams than he did when awake, and he thought about that now, as he stared at Tony across the small space between them.  Maybe he hadn’t had enough of the tea before he fell asleep.  Maybe he had just enough to loosen his mind and this was the result instead of the usual, dreamless sleep.
“I…did not know what that was, and I’m sorry I ever opened that drawer that I do not know about,” Tony replied.
I didn’t know it was like this, Steve thought, somewhat dazedly, blinking as he watched Anthony step into the room and grip the back of one of the conference room chairs.  Had it all been just a few seconds? It didn’t seem possible. He’d thought he had known, because he had wanted Anthony, wanted someone, anyway, and it had been easy enough to make Anthony that someone, so he had thought he understood what it meant to want to be someone’s Alpha.  But this was…he was off-center with the force it, the driving need to move worlds for Anthony, to see him happy, to take care of him, protect him, belong to him. Erskine had warned him, all those years ago, hadn’t he? Had it been a warning? It seemed like a promise now. Prophecy.  He didn’t know.
Tony shifted, widening his knees a bit and lowering his weight a bit and wound his hands under Steve’s legs, lifting them slightly to find the right angle, then pulled out and plunged in again, the head of his cock slamming against Steve’s prostrate, making Steve’s own cock jump and sending a fresh spurt of fluid across Steve’s chest.  Tony picked up his pace, withdrawing enough to feel the slick pressure as he thrust in again and again.  He knew he wasn’t going to last long, not with Steve clenching around him, almost sucking him in, and the soft, low moans that were echoing from Steve’s throat that Tony wasn’t even sure Steve was aware he was making.
But, it had been good, or he thought so, until Steve had come to see him in his office three days ago and told him they needed to stop, or, rather, he wanted to stop and got all Boy Scout about owning up to it.  Which, hey, fine.  Not like anyone had made any promises or, hell, actually used any real words, so fine.  Steve was done with this, whatever it was.  No problem.  Consenting adults and all that.  They’d both had fun, or some version of it.
“Perfect,” Tony murmured, drawing back his hand.  Steve’s body thrummed with warmth at the word. A single word, and that was all it took. It should bother him, he thought, but the thought, like so many others these days, was distant.  Tony picked up the strap and held it across his open palm where Steve could see it.  “Thirty strokes, unless you move, and then I’ll add to it.  You can be as loud as you need. There is no one in this part of the Castle, and the guards have been warned not to disturb us, no matter what they hear.”
“They won’t. We’ll get them ready.  We will,” she reiterated firmly when Matt looked to object.  “He has to talk to them, Matt.  There is blood in the water, and they know it.  That thing with Christine?  Sure, it was below the belt, but they don’t care.  They just care about why it wasn’t them getting access. We need to give them something or they’ll go find it.  A press conference will buy us at least a news cycle.  Dump it on the weekend, and that’s a couple of days before they have to come up with something else.”
“I know,” Tony said, his voice brittle, half a sob.  He choked out a bitter, scraping laugh. “I know.
“That’s...you’re not...that isn’t JARVIS, is it?” Tony asked, looking over at the alien.  “You interfaced with his voice system somehow, is that it? With this...stuff, this nano-gel or whatever it is.  So you could talk to me? In like, five minutes. Wow, that’s….actually, you know, that might actually be the hottest thing you’ve done, and that’s saying something.  Anyway, okay, so, you’re saying this will heal me. Gotta ask you to go into a bit more detail here, ‘cause, ah, from where I’m, ah, laying, I have to admit, I’m a little skeptical.  I mean, it isn’t the first time someone offered to fuck me into feeling better, but, ah, going to need some specifics here.”
“Steve, I didn't ask for this,” Tony began, then stopped, because his eyes caught the wording on the order and, as it turned out, this was the point where it was all just too much. “I didn't—this wasn't me. I swear it. This—Steve. This wasn't me.”
“Stabbed me in the neck,” Tony repeated, emphasizing each word, “Got my bodyguard signed up to be a Goonie, and left. Now, you and Spy Barbie are what?  Painting each others’ nails and braiding your hair?  Was there at least a pillow fight?  There is in my head now, just so you know,” Tony said, tapping a finger against his forehead and scrunching up his face.
Tony had gotten up this morning, ordered Zola to him and had that overseer sent to God only knew where, because of what Steve had told him last night.  That much Steve knew to be true.  Steve wondered what tale of innocence or ignorance Zola had woven to avoid a similar fate.  He wondered how Tony would react if he told him about other things.  Hammer.  Zola. This Lord Stane, whoever he was.  Though, what had those men truly done in this world?  Would the King even see such things as an evil or was the issue with Lucien more a matter of personal inconvenience?  Sending away one overseer was hardly an indictment of a system that allowed such things, after all.  The King still ordered Steve to his bed, Steve reminded himself with a fissure of disquiet.
“Bullshit. Wanting it and believing you deserve it are two different things. Trust me on that. Steve, you got nothing to prove here,” Bucky said, startling Steve from his thoughts. “Not to Stark. Not to anyone. The crazy bastard adores you. The people think it’s fantastic that one of their own is going to marry the King and have his ear. The military has apparently decided to start every sentence with “Captain Rogers needs,” and—“ Bucky cut himself off, eyes flicking up to catch Steve’s, voice going hard as he continued. “And people who needed to be dead are fucking dead, and you need to leave them there and let them rot. Don’t even pretend not to know what I mean. That’s over. It’s done—it’s—“ Bucky broke off, voice going ragged. His gaze left Steve for a long moment, staring at something that wasn’t there, before he turned back to look at Steve again. “There is no reason for us to stay here any longer except whatever it is you’re creating in your head.”
“We both have a lot of should-haves, so let’s not do that to ourselves, how about? It’ll drive us crazy and not get us anywhere,” Tony suggested, rubbing his hand over his mouth to cover his frown.  “Ah…what about you?  Ten years…anything I should know?”
Talking art ended up being a great conversation about various contemporary styles that Pepper was trying to incorporate into Tony’s collection.  He met Rhodey, who told wild stories about Tony’s younger days and bonded with Steve over a shared love of comics, as well as several other close friends and associates.  The wine was flowing the food was delicious. There was a bit of a celebratory air to the evening, though Steve suspected a lot of it was relief on Tony’s part to be finally be past this step and moving on to something concrete.  After dinner finished, the group dispersed, and Tony disappeared with Rhodey and another gentleman down to the garage to ogle the cars.   Pepper was in deep conversation with a shrewd looking man from SI’s logistical division named Phil.
He was too wound up from the dreams, the voice in his head, and the night-walking, letting his mind wander far afield, when he needed to focus on what, if anything, was here that might offer him any answers. That was all.  No wonder he was unsettled.  Even one of those was enough to unsettle even the most stalwart soul.  He grimaced and shook his head again, where it almost seemed like some of the fog had leached into his mind, tinging everything with a sort of murky thickness that made thinking clearly something of a challenge.
“Please, can we just—can we talk about this?  Really talk about it? I’m not—I’m not doing so good here, I know.  I didn’t want this to happen like this. You have to believe me, I never meant for you to find out like this.  I should have told you before we—before last night. I know. But, I don’t want to lose this. Us. If there’s any way to—to salvage this, I think—God, Steve, I think it’s worth it.  I think there’s maybe something really good here, and I—I know I fucked this whole thing up, but can you just—just give me a chance, here? Please? Rhodey will, he’ll—I don’t know, explain better, or—or something,” Tony tried.
“You don’t have do to that, Tony,” Steve replied.  Tony could hear the, not weariness, not really, but a sort of burnt-out edge to Steve’s voice, the way a used matched crumbles into ash when it is finally just done.
Anyway, point being, Steve’s room looked like a hotel room where you weren’t staying long enough to bother really unpacking, and Tony wasn’t sure what that said.  Where were the mementos?   The pictures of his family?  Army buddies?  The useless, random things that you kept for no good reason until you stopped having a reason to keep them?   Someone lived in this room, but the room wasn’t lived
“How well and how quickly you dive for cover?” Tony asked, clearly bemused.  Steve shrugged his shoulders.  “So, do tell.  What did my stalwart soldier do?”
“Basically the same,” Steve sighed heavily, putting one hand up on the treadmill’s bar, suddenly feeling unmoored.  He looked away, then back up at Natasha and smiled flatly.
“You don’t have to do this if you don’t want to.  We can turn around,” Steve told him for probably the thousandth time since Tony announced he wanted to see his parents after Jarvis’s recent visit.
“I would like that,” Steve replied carefully.  He would like that.  To get out of the city.  On such a trip, they would be surrounded by guards, yes, but not by walls.  Not by miles of sprawling civilization between him and some semblance of freedom.  It was an almost impossibly perfect opportunity.  No scaling walls or slipping past guards.  Just walking off a bit too far one day and disappearing into the mountains or forest, something he and his team had done countless times.  He could live off the land until he found a friendly ship’s captain or one greedy enough not to care that the payment came in the form of a slave’s collar.  It wouldn’t be easy, true, but it would be eas
Steve closed his eyes again.  It was easier to go mad without staring at it in the light of day, he supposed.  In Steve’s mind, the fantasy-Anthony leaned over and curled around him, all limbs and soft warmth, burying his head into Steve’s neck.  He could almost feel the heat of breath there, making the skin just below Steve’s jaw prickle.  “
“Think you that I cannot?  Do you really believe that we simply allow those who have served this House to be pushed out as soon as the luster has worn off?” Tony asked, voice laced with disbelief.  “Royal concubines retire to live their days in comfort in the Old Palace.  Even those who have bought their freedom or chosen to be sold to a favorite patron often return there, in time,” Tony explained.  “It has always been thus, and so it will always be. You would, undoubtedly, find it quite pleasant there, should you—that is, were you to—in the event that you should find yourself there. Some day.”
“Ha!  Is that not remarkable?  We should be honored to have something of your own design, Your Majesty, most honored,” Lord Rand announced with a booming voice.  Steve privately thought Lord Rand saw a way to draw the King back to the Ridge more than anything particularly useful, but he supposed he couldn’t blame the man for disbelieving what Tony could do.  If Steve hadn’t seen it for himself, he wasn’t sure if he would believe it, either. “It would certainly save money on slaves for the wheel,” Lord Rand continued. “Seems the stonemaster is always asking me for more.  They go through them so quickly down there, you know, and only a certain sort can man the wheel. Hard to find those at a price that makes it worth the investment, particularly when they don’t tend to last very long.”
“Mine as well.  A soldier, at least, though not a knight,” Steve replied. Rhodes slowed and looked Steve’s way, then back at the guards.  He reached out to place a hand on Steve’s arm, urging him to slow as well.  Rhodes opened his mouth, stopped, a grimace twisting it, and closed it again.
“Okay.  If you want,” Steve said after a beat.  Steve gave him a lingering look, then pulled out his chair and sat back down, though he didn’t go back to eating, just let his gaze dart to Tony, then to anything else in the room that wasn’t Tony.   He’s nervous, Tony thought with a pang.  Minus the threat of bodily injury, he might be just as nervous as I am, though, come to think, it had been at least a couple of weeks since he’d genuinely given any thought to that possibility.  The idea had seemed to narrow, more and more, in his mind until there was just a splinter of it left, still there, still something he could worry at when he thought on it, but most of the time, it wasn’t something he was consciously aware of anymore.
Brock leaned back in the booth, making the plastic squeak underneath him. He balled up his napkin and tossed it on the table, his face pulled into a frown.  “You’re serious.”
“Huh?  Oh,” Steve said, in a way that Tony knew from his own experience was code for ‘Fuck, Busted.’  “I’ll patch it up tomorrow.”
Steve had been saying that for a while now. They were taking a different route back to his people than the one he and his friend took on their Journey. A faster one, though more dangerous, but the only way they might make it before winter arrived in full force and made travel impossible.
The same thread, Steve thought hazily as he drifted into slumber. The same thread. Forged in blood and ash and bound by something more, something strong.
He wanted to tell him.  In that moment, dear God, he wanted to tell him so badly.  Whatever wall he’d built between Tony and the rest of his life had never seemed thinner for that one, quick breath, scraped down to nearly nothing, Ms. Romanov’s admonitions be damned.
“You come on my cock, or not at all,” the King panted, then pulled almost all the way out and drove in again, finding that spot deep inside Steve that made his whole body spasm and quake with pleasure.  Steve closed his eyes, felt his body relax, go limp, the muscles lax, and the wave inside finally crested, rolling over inside itself and bursting against the shore.  His cock pulsed as he came, and he shook with the force of it, muscles clamping down around the King’s cock.  He felt the King’s thrusts falter then, and his hips jerked.  He pushed down on Steve’s back and hooked an arm under his waist, lifting and spreading him as he slammed into Steve a few more times.  Then, Steve felt liquid warmth fill him in quick spurts, and the King thrust lazily, in and out, until he had spent all of his seed.  He collapsed on top of Steve, sending them both to the bed, each panting hard and soaked in sweat.
“I don’t know.  Italy’d be nice, I suppose.  See all the sights.  Paris, London,” Tony said with a shrug as he chewed on another bite of pizza and washed it down with a swig of lemonade.  “Switzerland.”  Switzerland, where CERN was located.  CERN, with its large hadron collider, its superconducting electromagnets, its cryogenics systems, its antiproton decelerator finding antiatoms, studying antimatter at the edge of science.  Switzerland would be glorious.  Well, obviously, it wouldn’t, because no way they’d let an Omega go all Bill Nye on their particle accelerator, but it would be neat to get close to it, maybe take a tour.
“No, no, of course not,” Ross cut him off, waving his hand. “The King’s safety and happiness are, naturally, of paramount importance.” He gave Rhodes an easy, almost patronizing smile, that made Steve immediately dislike the man. He glanced at Rhodes and thought Tony’s friend felt much the same way.
“You didn’t…you always made me happy,” Steve said, but Tony could hear the weakness that threaded through that denial.
“Yeah, well, you’re not exactly getting any sauce yet, either, Lothario, so step back,” Rhodey pointed out with a nod towards Steve, who had moved past Natasha into the small kitchen area to open the various take-out containers.
“You designed the armor. I, ah—I like it.  Always have. It’s beautiful.  The lines, the colors, the way it moves,” Steve said, and Stark nodded, dropping the burger back down to his plate and wiping the napkin from his lap over his mouth.  “The first time I saw it, I remember thinking, that was it. That was what the future was supposed to look like, not this—I mean, it was just, you know, really, ah… impressive.”
He’d woken up on the fourth day feeling like he had the worst hangover of his life, his dick red and chafed and so damn sensitive it hurt to touch, his hole loose and raw around one of the dildos that was still shoved up inside him, being utterly useless.  Someone helped him into the bath and cleaned him up, but the cold water stung at the abraded skin, and left him shivering and curled into a ball on the mess of a bed, just barely able to muster the energy to hate life.
Steve groaned and let his head fall back for a moment as Tony’s mouth worked, tongue flicking and flattening over the slit, then deftly pushing his latex-coated tongue inside the small folds of skin.  A harsh cry escaped Steve’s throat.  His hand went to the back of Tony’s head, fingers wanting to curl, to grip, to hold onto something solid while his body went boneless and tight at the same time.  He resisted the urge until Tony moaned, a thrumming, pulsating sound that vibrated up and down Steve’s cock.
“Right? It comes from someplace deep underground,” Tony told him. “Out of the mountains, most likey, but no one really knows. Long before my people ever arrived here, it was considered a sacred place. There was even a temple built over it. There,” he continued, pointing, “you can still see part of the old wall.”
“Nothing,” Steve replied, then glanced away and flattened his mouth.  “He had me crawl to him.  That was all.” The words hung there, between them, for long moments.  Steve could feel the heat of the forge.  It felt stifling all of a sudden, as if it was creeping into his nose and down his throat, burrowing into his lungs, all this heat, everywhere.  He could feel a sweat dampening his brow, but when he brought a hand up, his skin was cool to the touch.
“We’ll talk about that out there.  Later,” Tony was saying, drawing Steve’s attention back to the man in front of him.
“Can’t a guy like melted cheese?” Tony asked, pulling his hands out of his pockets and spreading them wide in front of him, all innocence. “Have to take a raincheck on the omelette, though, thanks. I’ve actually got an SI thing I need to work on that’s being incredibly uncooperative with my genius,” he continued, tapping lightly at his chest. Steve wondered sometimes if Tony realized how much he did that. “Look, ah… actually, the reason I came down here was that I wanted to suggest a--well, an alternative. To the whole bleeding on the floor thing you’ve got going.”
Standing still was out, so he settled for pacing back and forth along the cracked pavement in front of the steps to Steve's building, drawing curious glances from passersby who were too cold to actually care what Tony was doing. Down the street, a truck's horn blared at a woman pulling a cart full of grocery bags behind her across the intersection's crosswalk. The abrupt noise jolted him like a buzzer sounding at a gate, making his heart hammer out its echo in his chest. He was really going to do this...this whatever it was.
The little bit of cash Steve was able to get off his credit cards didn’t last particularly long, but he did get a lucky pull on a slot machine that left them up for a while. Brock parlayed that into a couple of games of craps where he came out ahead and then wanted to try his luck at the poker table. Steve watched for a bit, meandered around and tried the roulette wheel and lost, then sat down on a stool in front of one of the quarter slots--Grandpa slots, as Brock liked to call them. To be fair, there
“What?  Having a deeply personal, somewhat awkward conversation in front of our friends while they pretend to ignore us and stuff their faces as some kind of distraction so we’ll talk?” Tony asked with a small smile.
,” Tony replied, not quite sure what he was asking for, but wanting it anyway.  Steve would know.  Steve would take care of him.  He licked his suddenly dry lips, and watched Steve’s eyes darken to deep blue marbles as they followed the movement.  Oh.  He hadn’t meant it that way, but then he did mean it that way and didn’t know what to do with that.
“I think we’ll go with ‘Vaguely Cherry-Flavored Latex Taste’ for you,” Kirk mused and tore one of the red packets off at the seam, then opened it with his teeth and pulled out a dark pink colored condom.   “Hmmm…let’s see what we have here, shall we?” Kirk said and reached up to tug at the elastic waist of Steve’s sweats.  Kirk tugged a bit at them, then grinned.  “Tighty whities.  Oh, fuck me, I knew it.  You’re like some God-damned, red-blooded, American fantasy come to life, aren’t you?  I’m going to have you put on one of those plaid shirts and khaki get ups you have over there and fuck me while quoting Fight Club and talking about how Atlas Shrugged changed your life.”
“Good shot,” Tony murmured, voice rough and low, looking up at him with bleary, wide eyes as Steve pulled his pants up.  Once Steve had himself situated, Tony leaned forward and rested his head on Steve’s knee until his breathing evened.  Steve was stroking his hand through Tony’s hair before he quite realized what he was doing.  He stilled his hand, only to find Tony lifting his head to look at him accusingly, so he kept on while Tony settled his head back against Steve’s thigh.  “I should go,” Tony said, though he made no effort to move.
A slave rushed over and held a silk-draped parasol over Steve’s head to block the sun.  Steve had to physically force himself not to roll his eyes at the gesture, and instead, thanked the young man, who nodded exuberantly, but refused to look Steve in the eye.
Steve jolted at the blunt words and the promise they carried with them. He let out a muffled cry in surprise as the movement jerked at his nipples, sending spikes of pain-filled want down to his cock. His eyes widened, and he groaned again, pulling a bit at his chains as if he could find some small sliver of relief that way, though there was little give to be had.  His mouth watered around the chain.  A small rivulet of saliva spilled out the corner of his lips, onto his chin. He was going to drool all over himself like a child, he thought with dawning horror.  He sucked at the chain a bit, trying to swallow, but it was hard with the chain draped through his mouth.  He caught Tony watching him, and realized that Tony probably knew this, which made it excruciatingly worse and infinitely better at the same time.
Tony let out a breath, his shoulders stiffening slightly, back straightening. Sometimes, Steve could see the mantle of his position settling on Tony like a physical act.  Steve knew the feeling well enough, after all.
The edges of the puzzle, the pieces he had never conceived could even exist, fell into place, not one by one, but all at once, slamming into him with a singular, burning knowledge that felt like the kind of pain you get when you stub your toe and have to wait those precious fractions of a second for the hurt to get to your brain, but you knew it was coming. Oh, it was definitely coming.
“Hmmm…yeah, I guess…wait…what?” Steve said sharply.  Then suddenly he was remembering that night a week ago.  Bucky chasing him down the stairs, grabbing him as he was leaving.
.  For a little while, he could be Steve Rogers again and stop being whoever it was he was slowly becoming.  Whatever it was with Stark, that, and Steve’s own innate stubbornness kept him here this long, when all good sense said to get the hell out.
“Sorry I’m late.  I know you hate that,” Steve said, giving her a flat smile.  She laughed a little, though, her eyes warming.
“What the hell, Tony?” Rhodey demanded brusquely. Tony winced and drew the phone away from his ear. “You’ve got cops and Feds all over the hotel. I’m watching you perp walk out of the police station on repeat on CNN. They’re saying you tried to bribe Stern? Fox News has you selling weapons on the black market, and God that picture they’re using is the one from Bali in ’09.   You look like shit. They wheeled Stern out and put him in an ambulance, by the way. Got some paparazzi swearing you decked the guy. Now they’ve got ‘copters following it like he’s OJ.”
Steve wasn’t sure why he was making this into some kind of test for himself, except that it was the first thing Tony had asked of him, really and truly asked of him.  Well. Other than to stay away.  Tony asked for that first, even if not in so many words.  Steve was trying to give him that, too, but the things on the list were...they were connections, he supposed.  Tangible things that Steve could give to Tony, and Tony would, he would
Not that it had gone badly.  The opposite, really.  Steve’s lack of anger over the garage, his delight at the idea of Tony’s ‘bots, his disinterest in, well…Tony, all these were good things, as far as Tony was concerned, but since when did he get to have nice things?
“I’m sure he is,” Steve said as he slung his legs up onto the bed and shifted back against the pillows, wrapping an arm around Tony and pulling him to his chest.  “But, I bet the government has an absolutely brilliant plan to get him acclimated.”
Steve looked over to watch Tony’s mouth open, then close as he watched Natasha and Rhodes depart, catching his eye and turning his face into the palm of Tony’s hand as it stroked through his hair. Dimly, he heard the others talking, the occasional spurt of laughter punctuating the conversation, but it was muffled, like he was hearing it from underwater, he thought, a fissure of unease snaking through him.  He opened his eyes, not quite sure when he had closed them, and felt the weight of Tony’s gaze on him, which seemed right, comforting and familiar, so he let his eyes fall closed again, the murmur of voices lulling him, drowning out the other thoughts that would fill his mind until there was nothing.
“Yes. Please,” Steve said, but then reached up for Tony and pulled him down into a sloppy, wet kiss that ended with Tony grinning against Steve’s mouth as he slowly pulled himself out, then pushed back in again with a gasp.  Steve closed his eyes and bit his lip as Tony got his knees under himself and began thrusting in earnest, pounding into Steve with deep, hard thrusts.  His body rocked with the motion, finding the rhythm Tony was setting.
But…these nights, and they were always, nights…these nights, when Steve got home after a mission, still in his uniform bearing stains he didn’t want to talk about, hair unkempt, eyes unfocused, breathing hot and hard, but his hands scrubbed clean…Tony knew there was some wall there that Steve didn’t want him to cross, but he’d get home, and he would have
“Looking at it,” Tony said. On his phone screen, the man suddenly moved forward and bent down, inspecting Covi.  He poked at it, making the camera wobble. “Pick me up, Hot Stuff. God, that’s meta. Anyway, look at the phone number. Right there!  Big numbers! Oh, there you go,” Tony said as Hot Roof Guy scrunched his face up in confusion for a moment as he looked down at the drone.  Tony hit one of the app’s buttons and the little drone hopped forward a bit, earning a startled laugh from Hot Roof Guy. “That’s it, there you go, look at the cute, little cobbled together science project and be impressed.”
“Got you something,” Steve said after a long moment.  He reached around behind his seat and plucked a small gift bag from the floorboard, dropping it in Tony’s lap.  “I hear it’s traditional.”
And Tony’s Alpha probably knew what to get Tony for his birthday, Steve thought ruefully.  What did Tony like?  Robots.  Space.  Building things.  Cartoons?  Maybe.  Comic books.  Superheroes, though Steve wasn’t going to touch that one right now.  What else? MIT, Steve remembered with a flash.  That had been the name at the top of the screen on Tony’s tablet this morning over breakfast.
“Thought you were going to get some sleep,” Steve reminded him, which gave Tony and out, and damn if he wasn't certain that was the point.
“You should hear Bucky, though,” Steve told Shellhead, who swam along beside the Marvel with a look of avid interest on his face.  “He’s just as Irish as I am, but he can do a high society accent just as pretty as you please. And Nat, his wife, she speaks all kinds of languages.  Her family came over from Russia. They were fur traders, or so she says. If you can believe her, they just walked right over and claimed an island for the Czar way up north in Alaska, then kept right on walking, I guess, and made their way across Canada to New York.  I don’t know if I believe all that, to be honest. She also once said she’s the illegitimate daughter of Alexander Romanov, the Russian Emperor, and she fled an arranged marriage. Nat’s hard to get a read on and tends to let other people do the talking. Kind of like you, Shellhead,” he added with a smile and a nod.
“Your Highness, please, I—“ Steve began, lifting his eyes to the King’s again, a plea there that he couldn’t quite put into words.
“Didn’t think you’d like what?” Tony heard himself ask.  His voice sounded strange, garbled, the words floating away on the wind like they were in those little cartoon text bubbles.
doing breaking into my father’s study—well, my study now, seeing as how he managed to drive himself into a tree on a deserted road with zero traffic.  Can’t
Steve coughed, a low, wracking sound, and for a moment, Tony couldn’t figure out what was so off about it. Then he realized everything was wrong about it. He’d never heard Steve cough like that before. Hell, probably no one had in a good seventy or so years. “Okay, so they tinkered with the serum, huh,” Tony said, trying to keep his voice mild and even and quell the desire to just outright panic. Fuck. Fuck-ity, fuck, fuck, fuck. He could hear the undercurrent of worry threaded with fear in Steve’s carefully measured voice. It wouldn’t do any good for Tony to come unglued just because they were captured, and Steve was…well, whatever he was. Tony had pictures. Wait, better to rephrase that, he mentally corrected. Tony had seen pictures. Sure, those were in his private collection, but, the point was, he was well aware of what Steve had looked like before the serum. For research-y type reasons, he’d studied them. Because, science.
“Hey, aren’t you Tony Stark?” a student on the row in front of them asked, giving Tony a speculative look.
“It was…I liked it, Tony,” Steve assured him, catching Tony’s gaze for a moment before dipping his head back to his arms with a rush of heat to his cheeks.  Liked it, he thought. Small words, for something far grander.  He didn’t know how to express what he felt about last night.  It had hurt and felt good.  He’d been not scared, but…concerned, he decided after a moment’s thought.  Concerned about it.  The chains, so like and unlike the ones he wore on the road here from Rumlow’s, and yet completely different.  Being held down, but in a way that felt like being cherished instead of being a prisoner.  The…thing Tony put in him, how full he’d felt, how invaded and open and taken, the same thing and not the same thing as when Zola’s overseer used something similar to open him for Tony’s use.  He didn’t quite understand how one thing could be experienced entirely differently, but there it was.  Tony, he supposed.  Tony was the difference.
Steve groaned and let his chin fall to his chest.  He looked down at the King’s hand working his cock.  Humiliation burned through him, but God, he wanted release so badly, even if he wasn’t supposed to want it.  He didn’t know what that made him.  He wasn’t supposed to be this, but here he was, thrusting against the King’s hand for all he was worth, begging for it, the way Zola told him he should.
“Okay,” Steve agreed.  His eyes dropped back down to the sketch and the pencil started scraping across the surface of the page again in small, swooping lines.  Must be doing the hair, Tony thought, tracking the movement.
He climbed onto one of the tables and lay down on his back, letting Cam rub the scraper over his skin, then wipe him down, while other attendants took special care of his hands and feet, cleaning under the nail beds and shaping them, scrubbing and buffing until they shone.  A cloth was placed over his eyes, and water poured through his hair into the catch basin on the floor, then strong fingers massaged shampoo into his scalp, followed by more warm water to rinse.  Shaving was next, though he waved the attendants off when they made to lay the blade on his groin.  Tony did not mind that, he thought, remembering the way the King seemed to like to trail his hand down the line of hair beneath Steve’s stomach and rake his nails through the coarser hair that framed his cock.  He flipped over onto his stomach and let Cam repeat the process on his back, until he was clean and largely denuded, skin slick and gleaming with scented oils.
“I know.  Which makes me want to give it to you even more. See?  Irony.  Hey, don’t give me that look.  You were the one out playing a fucked-up version of Gift of the Magi with your little shopping spree.  Did you really think I cared about that stuff?” Tony questioned.  “I know I complained sometimes.  I know.  I’m not saying I’m proud of that, but, Steve, I went from never having to even think about money to thinking about it constantly. If I missed some things in the transition, well.  I was trying, okay?  Maybe I was terrible at it, but I tried.”
“Your idea or that come from someone else?” Steve asked and took Tony’s silence for answer.  “And you can stop them.  Stane, Pierce, Stern and whoever else is involved,” Steve continued.  He turned towards Tony, one hand braced behind him around the metal bar that wrapped around the middle of the elevator.  It was cold and solid in his hand, something to hold onto in that flicker of a moment when the bottom of the elevator felt like loose sand shifting under his feet.  He made himself look down at the gleaming metal bottom of the elevator car where nothing moved except their oddly truncated reflections.
Tony fished them out of his jacket pocket, along with his phone, and threw them across the car to Rhodey’s waiting hand.  He tore the parking ticket off the Audi’s windshield and shoved it in the glove compartment as he slid inside, letting his head fall back against the head rest.
Goddammit, Rhodey, can’t I just mandroid myself in a cave one more time instead?  It’d be a fucking hell of a lot less terrifying.
“No. This is crap, Matt. There wasn’t anyone else up there. I swear it. This is one of Stern’s cronies lying for him, the bastard!” Tony shouted, standing up and pushing away from the table. “No way. No way he gets away with this.”
“Tony.  I can’t, this isn’t right,” Steve insisted. “Why? Why this? Ask me for something I can do or give you or—”
“Wow, it’s almost like there is some kind of a pattern there,” Pepper said with a slight smile.   Not for the first time, he was struck with just how remarkable she was.  He’d taken the loss of their relationship hard, though he had realized some time ago that it was the loss of her in his life he feared more than the loss of her in his heart.  Which probably told him a lot.
“Tony, Steve—“ Natasha began again, then her head jerked to the side as heavy footsteps thudded against the metal loading ramp.  Tony bent at the waist and pushed himself up enough to see over her shoulder, one hand clutching at the slash that split his chest.  He winced at the movement as the skin tugged, the dull ache that had settled there turning into a sharp sting of pain, but it wasn’t as bad as it could have been, he knew that much.  Thanks to Steve, and damn if that didn’t send a flood of warmth through his chest, wrapping itself around the wound like a sponge.  Steve would have done the same for any of them, Tony’s mind supplied, less than helpfully.  But he hadn’t.  He’d done it for Tony, and that, Tony thought with a grimace, well.  Damned if that didn’t have the annoying by-product of making all these feelings bubble far too close to the surface.
So, we have making Steve happy and keeping Steve safe, Tony thought to himself.  It surprised him, just how much he wanted both of those things.  He could do this.  For Steve.  For both of them.
“I see you remember,” Tony said with a low chuckle, before his expression turned into something darker, possessive, his eyes roving over Steve in a way that made Steve’s cock ache and leak, heat twisting and clawing at his insides.  He was Tony’s, and when Tony looked at him like this, it felt real, this belongingness.  “Take off your clothes and get into bed.  On your back.  Hands above your head. Legs spread as wide as you can at the knees.”
“It wasn’t about that-” Steve cuts him off but he doesn’t get a chance to explain himself any further.
“I know it’s a lot to take in, Cap, but trust me. Things are very different now… If I’m being honest, I was kind of hurt that you didn’t want to talk to me about it, you know?” he says, taking his hand off Steve’s back and resting his elbows on his knees. “We’re friends… or at least I thought we were-”
The blond’s left alone on the roof, with his back against the wall, still trying to catch his breath and figure out what the fuck has just happened.
life. He’d been trying to distance himself from that image, subconsciously trying to make Steve see him as something other than a slutty manwhore who would get in the sack with anyone that glanced his way. It had never seem to make much of a difference to Steve that he stopped fooling around, but he hadn’t even been in the mood for it the past few months regardless. He’d been starting to notice a shift in his preferences when it came to checking out people, too. They were always blond, tall, strong guys. Preferably with light blue eyes. It took Tony an embarrassing amount of time for a genius to put two and two together, but once he did, that’s all he could see when he looked at them: Captain fucking America.
Here's some lovely artwork I commissioned to the amazing Umikochann. Go check her talented works on her Tumblr @umikochannart !
Rhodey sighs. “He’s still under. He’s healing fast, but Dr. Cho thought it best to keep him sedated… to help with the pain.”
“Maybe he does. Maybe he doesn’t.” Then he leans forward to lock gazes with Steve. “There’s only one way to find out, though.”
Steve swallows thickly and Tony immediately loses the grin. There’s a panicked look on the blond’s face that tells Tony he is, in fact, dead serious. They stay silent, looking at each other, their breaths coming back to normal. Tony’s mind is blank.
Tony can guess what is coming next. He sighs and stands, barely able to catch himself before he stumbles forward.
, Tony is desperate to know. He tells himself he just wants to hear his friend say that he accepts him just the way he is - wants him to say the words Howard never did. That’s what he tells himself, of course. Tony is actively avoiding giving the other explanation a second thought.
Tony launches towards Sam and grabs him, pushing him away from firing range, behind a wall, then throws himself head first against the shooters. He barely registers Widow dropping from her hiding spot up on the ceiling and a red, white and blue blur passing just a few inches from his faceplate. Steve’s shield smacks the walls and returns to his hand as he runs forward next to him, fending the mercenaries off as he approaches him.
Tony yells in surprise when he feels a set of teeth dig into the soft skin of his right cheek while a hand roughly grabs the other one, hard enough to bruise.
With an annoyed growl, he gives up his search for a replacement mug, messily grabs the boxes of capsules and walks over to the elevator. He stops once he’s in front of the doors and lets out a sigh before pressing the button.
to be by his side. He guesses that shows how much Tony Stark’s word is worth. He gets to the top and pushes the door open, the icy wind of the New York winter night hitting his face and dialing down the anger a little.
“Stop overthinking, I can hear the gears in your brain turning.” Nat commands him softly from the couch, eyes still closed.
The lady quickly steps in and rudely grabs Tony by his forearm, dragging him away. Steve’s eyes follow the both of them as the woman loudly chatters Tony’s ear off and the brunette shoots him an apologetic look.
anyone. Your thrusters don’t exactly come with a silencer, Tony,” he calmly explains. “If they smell something’s up, they might not go through with it at all or worse, they’ll retreat and we’ll lose them.
be bluffing, but then again, this is the man who blasted half of his Malibu mansion when he was being an ass on his birthday party due to the imminent threat of death by palladium poisoning...
“Man, you’re so obvious around him!” He pats his friend on the back. “Honestly, I think the only one who still doesn’t notice is him.”
trying. He’s glad he hasn’t mentioned the texts to his friend, though. He could imagine what his reaction would have been if he had confessed Steve had been sending him little texts all week.
He suddenly remembered the promise he made to Steve and smiles broadly. “Well, don’t you worry your pretty little head with that, I’ll m-”
“You would never lose me over something like this, Steve. We’re friends, this would never change that.” He lays a hand over Steve’s knee and pats him, with a genuine kind smile on his face that says
.” Nat stops him with a frown, looking at him in disbelief. “Are you seriously telling me you’re gonna weasel your way out of this by blaming it on alcohol?”
Also, bear in mind that the characterizations of Howard and Joseph are taken straight from the comic canon which do not match the MCU storyline.
Tony lays on his bed, the image of Steve’s clenched up jaw and condemning gaze still painfully fresh. He’s already kicked the guy out as politely as possible.
He opens his eyes when he feels the warmth of the body on top of his leave him, only to discover Tony’s looking at him in pure panic.
His expression and tone of voice brings back memories from the battle at the HYDRA facility and Tony’s first reaction is to try to get up again. Rhodey quickly gets to his side, though, and presses a gentle but firm hand on his shoulder to keep him down.
It’s been a few days already and after battling Helen ad nauseam, he’s been finally allowed to get on a wheelchair and let into Steve’s room.
‘Steve’ swirls the digit around until he finds the bundle of nerves and Tony practically jumps off the bed.
He bites his tongue at the pain in his chest as he sits up, legs hanging off the edge of the bed, ready to grab the IV pole and make his way to Steve’s room, when Rhodey stands in front of him, blocking his path.
“Hi, Nick,” he had greeted them with deliberate fake enthusiasm. “I woke up this morning with a strange feeling in my stomach. At first I thought it was the hangover, now I can see it was my body trying to warn me about this...” — Fury narrowed his eyes in warning — “...pleasant surprise.”
“Fine” Tony drops the tool he’d been clutching onto the work table and crosses his arms over his chest. “Long story short, remember the debriefing with Fury, the one where I was on video call from Malibu?”
To Steve, it had felt like the whole compound had suddenly started shaking. Time had stopped and so had his lungs. It felt like diving into extremely cold water: a harsh, crippling sensation of pain and an inability to move a single muscle. Tony had just turned around slightly, his expression barely registering any change at all.
to us, to the team, when it does? It’s too…” he struggles for a second to find the perfect word. “It’s
Tony’s mind immediately fills with flashes from Afghanistan and a shiver runs through him. Rhodey can easily read Tony’s reaction, so he doesn’t go into more detail about that. “Also, he put himself between the armor and the blast so he took some pretty nasty blows.”
Rhodey doesn’t even dignify that question with an answer, he only nods his head as a sign for him to start talking.
He can’t help it. He squeezes the hand in his as a little treacherous tear escapes the corner of his eye, so subtle it’ll surely go unnoticed. Tony stirs in the wheelchair, slowly waking up and wincing when he moves his head to the other side. The song changes as they silently stare at each other.
“Here’s how this is going to go. I’ve gathered all the information I needed, so this is gonna be out little goodbye party, Tony. You will do as I say and maybe, just
‘Steve’ grabs his head with both hands and starts ramming in and out of his mouth, as if Tony was nothing but a warm, wet hole for him to use.
“Is this public knowledge now? Does everyone know about my fight with Cap?” he asks as he gives up and drops the boxes over the counter, going for the coffee pot instead. “Because you’re all being incredibly biased and may I remind you,
Rhodey goes back to his chair and sits leaning forward, resting his arms on his thighs and rubbing his hands together nervously.
, Jesus Christ, Steve!" She laughs bitterly, “I’m the one everyone expects to sound like a lifeless robot, not you.”
“I’m sorry, didn’t really- I didn’t feel like running today,” Steve answers, trying to sound casual, although he already knows that’s not going to work with Sam.
Stark holds his gaze and the grip on his forearm for a couple of seconds before he slowly releases him with a snort, shaking his head. Steve resumes walking and tries to hold back the tears as hard as he can.
Tony’s urge to scream at the man for putting his life in danger evaporates as he stares into the blue pools of his eyes. The way Steve’s looking at him… Judy Garland talks about a place somewhere over a rainbow that sounds beautiful so Tony just squeezes back and offers a tiny little smirk.
‘Steve’ grows tired of his silence and slaps him hard across the face, making his head turn to the side.
“Yeah, it’s not pretentious or douchey at all.” He shifts nervously, his eyes darting everywhere across the room trying to avoid his reflection.
Steve’s anger washes away all the sudden, his heartbeat going a thousand miles an hour. The air in the rooftop has stilled, he can’t hear the traffic anymore and he feels time has suddenly stopped. Tony’s just standing there, his back to him, unflinching, unmoving.
! He also wants to apologize, because he knows barging in and going against the plan did not just put him in danger, but the rest of the team as well. He wants to- he wants to finish that conversation. He really wants to hear what Steve has to say…
Steve feels a twinge of cutting pain, closing his eyes as the words slice through him like a knife. He could never think of Tony that way,
“Yeah, I do.” She looks down at her nails, inspecting them. “How many one-night stands have you seen Tony bring to the compound, though?”
“I--” Steve stops abruptly. He goes back as far as he can, searching through his memory for an unfamiliar face in an oversized t-shirt clutching a coffee mug. He frowns. “Well, uh--”
“I’ll tell you why you can’t think of any.” Nat cuts him off as she leans in, like she’s about to share a big secret. “Because there are
He mounts him, still fully clothed, and starts kissing his back. Tony lets out a content sigh. He feels Steve’s mouth traveling lower and lower, kissing and licking, massaging his sides with his strong hands. Tony lets out a moan when he feels Steve’s knees squeezing his legs together tightly, his lips over his lower back and then...
." Tony can feel his eyes tear up as a shiver runs through him. He feels naked and exposed for a brief moment. "I don’t think my father was a bad man, Tony. I think he was a
“I do apologize, Captain Rogers, but I am not authorized to disclose that information at the present time.”
He physically bites his own tongue to prevent anything else from coming out of his big mouth and grabs the towel sitting on the bench, walking towards the door ready to storm off the gym without even looking back, but Tony in his infinite stupidity has the audacity to grab his forearm as Steve passes him by.
Tony’s blasting AC/DC in the workshop as he works on new designs for Hawkeye’s arrows so it takes him a few seconds to register the noise behind him.
He closes his eyes with a sigh and as soon as he does, he sees Steve’s face full of disapproval and his outraged flared nostrils. He wants to punch him for some reason.
Sam sighs and they signal Rhodey and Hawkeye to cover them as they both take off and fly right through the windows over the entrance. They barge in on the mercenaries and Tony immediately understands he’s made a mistake. They’re fighting amongst each other but as soon as they lay eyes on them, they open fire against him and Sam.
starts playing the moment is broken and Tony realizes the hand holding is lasting way too long, so he gently lets go. He might be still sleepy, but he could have sworn Steve’s smile faded a little.
“He left the party in a rush, which meant he was fleeing from something. His face was a deep shade of pink, and it wasn’t from the alcohol, so he was embarrassed. Also he had dried his eyes but the sclera was reddish, so he must have cried. Then you came down, practically bursting through the door and frantically looking around the room, so you were chasing after him,” she explained as if it were the most obvious line of thought. “I’m guessing… you guys had a fight, one thing led to another, you kissed and then he ran away ashamed.”
Rhodey stands up from the desk he’d been leaning on and shakes his head in defeat. “Well, I don’t care
Steve sighs sadly. No, that’s not what he wants. He’s about to turn around and leave the roof when he notices it’s… some sort of garden. This peaks his interest so he carefully steps forward, helped by the dim city nightlights below him. There’s little knee-high shrubs emerging from the ground and sinuous spaces filled with white and slate stones. Steve spends some time admiring it, it almost looks like he’s staring at a city from up high in the sky, the way an eagle would in the middle of its flight.
He swallows thickly and his gaze falls to the ground. Tony finds himself rooted to the couch, eyes watery and fists clenched.
He had managed to keep it together, if he said so himself. Tony had gone back to Malibu for a few days. “You can call me in if there’s an emergency” he had said, gotten into his armor and flown away. No explanations, no additional information on his sudden decision to leave. Steve had been preoccupied. He had wanted to call him, text him,
. He needs a plan, a strategy. He needs to calculate his options and the possible outcomes, consider how to best approach the situation…
The first concern on the genius’ mind, however, had been whether or not Steve’s sweet words before he passed out that night had been nothing more than the sedatives talking. Tony confronted him about it as soon as Steve woke up again, the drugs fully out of his system, and he reassured him.
for fuck's sake. He'd just... stood there! And let Tony kiss him! Probably too shocked and disgusted to even
Steve nods and Fury’s hologram vanishes. Maria explains further details about the facility’s location and its structure, as well as the surroundings. Steve eyes the data, already coming up with a strategy and instructions for each team member, taking into consideration their abilities. Hawkeye will be up high and provide a large visual, Widow and him can sneak in after the mercenaries and slim the group down in stealth. They need to be careful and let them approach whatever it is they’ve been ordered to retrieve so they can get their hands on it first. He can’t have Rhodey, Tony or Sam flying around and blowing their cover, so he figures they should wait outside for his word. When the time is right, Tony and Sam can barge in and join him and Nat. Someone should stay with Clint in case things go wrong and Rhodey’s suit is heavily armed, he can also cover them if they get unexpected company. He warns them, though: minimum casualties. They still need these guys alive and taken into custody.
Steve notices his own nostrils flare and his hands turning into fists. He has to leave this building,
. He's so utterly confused right now. He wishes he knew where Steve's feelings were coming from, but he has no goddamn clue and Tony
, Tony.” He grabs his neglected cock firmly and smears the precome over the head with his thumb. Tony’s hips jerk off the bed as he moans loudly and he feels his face catching fire. ‘Steve’ laughs again, pleased. “You want this.”
smells like the only bear around here is you,” he says, minding his step as he makes his way towards the genius. “Jesus…”
The elevator dings in the background and Tony frowns, looking at the clock. 2:12 am. The little color left on his face leaves him when he turns around and a very serious, very elegant still-in-his-military-uniform Steve Rogers walks through.
there's something else." Steve sighs and closes his eyes, like he’s getting ready to blurt something embarrassing out . “I don’t want- I don’t want to be like other fellas.”
Tony clears his throat, finally getting a bit of a grip on himself. “So, how are you enjoying yourself?”
Tony turns in his chair, an astonished expression on his face, only to see Steve grinning wildly with his gaze glued to the sketchbook.
last night. I wanted you to know who was fucking into that gorgeous mouth of yours, into your tight little ass...” he pushes into Tony savagely, hitting the back of his throat with the head of his cock and earning a choke from the man underneath him. “Ah, God,
When the meaning behind his words finally sinks in, Steve looks at him horrified. No - Tony squints, trying to focus - he’s not just horrified. He looks angry.
The silence that follows Steve’s words is thick one, uncomfortable and tense. Tony is still not facing him, but his movements have stilled. He seems to recover fairly quickly, though, as he returns to his tinkering with the blue screens in front of him.
“Hey,” he cuts him off, palms in the air as a sign of surrender “I’m the one who acted like an idiot. I didn’t- I should have waited-”
Tony can’t help the tears of both anger and pain fall down his cheeks. He keeps his gaze fixated stubbornly on the wall on top of him, while his mind is works at a fast pace going over all the possibilities. He could try kick him off of him, but he’s literally a replica of Steve, so he’s way too strong for him. He wonders if he could call the suit, but he can’t motion properly with his hands cuffed to the headboard. And even if any of his plans worked and he managed to get away from this man, there was still the threat upon the real Steve’s life.
“I- I didn’t feel like being around Cap for a few days, okay?” He throws his hands in the air, defeated. “It’s no big deal, I’ll get over it. I just- I need some time to myself.”
He’s leaning onto the bar, in a more secluded corner, happily chatting with a very handsome young man. He sips his scotch gracefully and grins a cocky smile at the guy, lifting a cocky eyebrow - his signature seductive move. The young stud closes in a little and places a soft hand on Tony’s forearm and the genius laughs out loud.
, you know?” Tony whispers and Steve can see his eyes are suddenly a little brighter in the dark, something glinting in them. “I believed that…”
He opens his eyes slowly, the left one hurts a bit. He can feel the IV line on his arm as well as something warm and heavy enveloping his hand. When he looks down his heart skips a beat and the weight on his chest lifts a little. Tony’s sitting on a wheelchair, head slightly tilted to the side in what must be a very uncomfortable position for his neck and he’s…
Tony flinches like he’s just been stabbed in the gut. When Rhodey leaves, he’s left standing in the middle of the workshop, angrily tapping his foot against the floor. He remembers sneaking up to the kitchen, stomach roaring in hunger, and seeing the pot roast sitting there in the tray. Something warm had briefly spread through his chest but was quickly drowned by the anger he still felt.
Steve feels all the blood leave his body when Tony’s expression suddenly turns cold and he narrows his eyes, like he’s just figured out something.
So here they are, back in the workshop together. Steve has his sketchbook with him as usual, and The Clash plays in the background at an acceptable volume for the super soldier. He’s insisted that Tony plays his music - or at least, the soft ones - because Steve wants the man to enjoy himself as much as possible, given the fact he’s still nursing broken bones.
He turns around, startled at the familiar voice behind him, and immediately he can feel his body tense up. Tony’s there, by the door, gracefully leaning against it and contemplating the garden.
Steve keeps rubbing circles on his wrist with his thumb and sending shivers down Tony’s spine. The honesty and the intensity behind his damp blue eyes is soul-crushing and he needs to look away, but Steve’s tongue travels between his lips as they part and his gaze lowers to Tony’s.
“You’re in pain,” Tony responded carefully after a long pause, each word stunted with all the things Tony wanted to ask and didn’t really want to know.
Help, Tony wondered dumbly. What kind of help? No one said anything about help. Help with what? Was there something—was he supposed to—to get himself ready? Of course, that, yes, fuck. He could do that. He knew what to do, or the mechanics of it, at least. Some Alphas probably didn't want to do that themselves, which, okay, fine, he could handle it. Wasn't like he hadn't tried with his Heat, getting himself as slick and open as he could while he tried to find relief.
Three hours of working on the coding for his next 'bot, currently known by the highly original designation of U because Tony had fallen asleep on the keyboard and left a long line of text that eventually got whittled down to the first letter, and the lines of numbers in front of him had started to bleed together as they trailed off across the edge of the screen. Tony swallowed a sip of cold coffee from the styrofoam cup next to his touchpad and stylus, and rubbed at his eyes, covering them for a moment while he waited in vain for the burgeoning headache to go away. Giving up on accomplishing anything for the night, he shut off the workstation and gave Dum-E a pat on the, well, claw, as he walked by.
“Everyone got that?  We all on the same page?” Steve asked the rest of the bus, his voice going icy and brittle in a way that didn’t sound like a Steve who Tony knew.  “Good. This is my stop,” he ground out and stood up, shoving past Tony and towards the bus’s middle door.  “Rhodes is three cars behind us, trying to make a Bentley look unobtrusive in Brooklyn.  You can get out here and wait for him,” Steve told him without turning around.  “He’ll get you home.”
“That’s former Director, Obie, and you know how government work is, Obadiah.  Never can keep to my calendar. I haven’t seen you since…well, since the funerals, I suppose. Such a terrible thing.  I didn’t get to speak to you very long after. How have you been?” Peggy asked.
Another blow, and then another, the strikes coming faster.  The silence was punctuated only by the clap of the strap meeting his skin and his count.  Eight, nine, he thought he sobbed out ten as Tony laid them atop each other, right across his hole, sending the metal cock thrusting hard, pinging that spot deep inside him.  Pain and pleasure threatened to overwhelm him.  His cock throbbed, all but forgotten, and his ass ached with indescribable agony, but it was good, too, all of it, like everything with Tony, this mix of everything Steve wanted and horror at wanting it.
DUM-E had managed to pick up the water bottle, and was trailing tiny droplets of water from the top as he wheeled himself over to the garbage can.  U had his claw opened wide and arm extended in what Tony would describe as an expectant look, like he hoped maybe Tony would set something else on fire for him.  Well, chances were pretty good on that, at some point, Tony could admit.  Patience, young Padawan.
“What were you doing with him?” Steve asked carefully, almost like he didn’t really want to know the answer.
Panic clawed its way up Steve’s throat. It tasted like seawater, he thought, though that thought was quickly pushed to the side.  Washed away, he thought with a tide of hysteria behind it.  They couldn’t come here, they couldn’t find him like this, he had to leave, he had to leave, escape, it had to be him, he had to be the one to leave, not them, not them coming here and seeing him like this and, knowing, knowing what he was, knowing what he wanted,
