"We should get Cap his cure," he said softly.
“No, wait.” Cap shook his head. “No, it has to be Peter. He said he couldn’t bring the boyfriend to his school. Then he said the reason was because he had a bunch of psycho bad guys.” The blond rubbed his forehead. “Wait, why would he worry about villains finding out about his boyfriend if their villains didn’t know who HE was himself? It must be Spider-Man…I guess,” Cap added, cringing a bit.
Bruce looked at him the way he usually did when Hulk was giving running commentary inside his head.
Wade hesitated, thinking the question over very carefully, blue eyes locked on Peter. After a moment, he forced a laugh.
Clint got up immediately and dug for a pair of pants in the dresser.
"Our minds think alike, friend!" Thor laughed and swooped them down to the ground, placing Clint carefully on his feet again. "You may wish to stand clear."
“Bruce, why don’t you stay in the room with Clint? Hulk likes him. I think,” Steve told them with a frown. “The brochure said the beds were hammocks, so at least there’s not much to smash.”
Thor stepped over to the cell door and offered Clint a hand to help him step out, like he'd been imprisoned for days and was finally granted a pardon.
He wasn’t, so the blond hung his head over the back of the couch and reached for the box.
"I'll take care of all of that," the billionaire said, a bit exasperated. He held up a hand. "Listen, guys, Doom's probably got Steve naked strapped to a table somewhere, and not in the good way. It's been over an hour since I left—we don't have time for chit-chat!"
Deadpan, Bruce pointed to the right.
The Hulk snorted and grumbled under his breath, but relented and did not try to attack Clint. In fact, he stepped up closer to the archer and got a wicked little smirk.
“I’ll stay, Peter,” Matt added in, patting the hand on his shoulder. “I can call work and let them know I’ll be out for another day.”
"No I didn't," Deadpool said, rubbing his head again. "Really? Well that's just...stupid." He continued to himself. "Because it said steak the first time!" He told no one in particular, glancing to the side and waving a hand to dismiss the thought. "Tch." Seemingly resolving his one sided argument, he turned back to Peter. "Whatever."
He could only imagine the insanity that would happen if he and Tony actually tried anything like that. Not that they would. They had to worry about the team and keeping their reputation in the green.
“I know, right?” Clint told him sharply.
"Uhhh," Peter mumbled, painfully aware of both Cap's and Tony's gazes on his back. Or maybe Wade's. It felt like spotlights were on them. Jeez, did Wade have a crush on Cap? Peter didn't want to hear about that if he did!
“Peter was acting weird, but he wouldn’t lie about something like that,” Tony said, frowning in the direction they had gone. “Did you notice Matt’s missing his sunglasses today? And Peter kept having to lead him around by the hand, too. Yesterday he had a white cane.”
“Lake, definitely lake,” Tony called up to him, waving toward the left fork.
"That's not very comforting, you know," Peter sighed, taking a bite out of the naked hot dog again and chewing. It wasn't so bad when he looked out to the city instead of watching Wade watch him eat.
Tony said that last like it would be really annoying to have to actually admit they needed SHIELD's help. It probably would be for him.
“I’m sorry, is this the D loop?” The man asked.
"PIZZA!"
"I doubt it. When you go missing, they tell the President—when I go missing, they roll over and go back to sleep." He paused next to Bruce, also checking the shop's hours. "Hey."
Cue more muttering from Clint.
"Why are you s-so sure t-that he's evil?" Steve asked, stepping in after him. He waved a hand at Tony tiredly.
"Yeah, Bruce. We'll just need a minute or two."
"Oh, that's alright." Bruce held up a hand. He then held his hand up above his head, which shielded about four inches of his hair from the raindrops. Ah, well.
“Are we?” Clint asked, pushing down the irritation of being lost in the woods with Wade. “We’ve been ‘heading’ to the shortcut for twenty minutes. We only hiked for two hours! Why the hell aren’t we just going back down the trail?”
“It’s alright Peter,” Steve assured him, pulling on a careful smile and extending a hand to Wade. “I’m Steve and this is Tony. What’s your name, son?”
Uh-oh. Realizing that “you two” meant Loki didn’t know he was in a group three-person thing, Peter flushed, wondering if the other guy he had in mind was even Matt or Wade.
Clint followed quietly, pizza balanced on one hand and blanket held with the other. He seemed eager to escape the policemen devouring babies.
Bruce followed silently behind the others. The lights were flickering softly. Neither Clint or Cap should've been walking right now, and that made HIM the most able person here. That was worrisome.
Tony wasn't much of an arrowhead craftsman; it turned out to be more of a pointed tip with only one actual barb on the side.
"He's asleep," Bruce confirmed, running a hand through his hair. "And it doesn't really matter if it's unbalanced, because we made a deal. Hulk knows I keep my promises, and it's why HE keeps his promises." He smiled unhappily. "He's got more of a life than I do, anyway. Look, I don't know what to do with myself after two days without changing into him. I've been on the run so long, it's not like I have any family or...well, I-I'd say the Avengers are my friends, but they don't get to talk to me much, do they? You know me better than anybody else here. So, it's fine. This is just how it is."
Peter sighed. Speaking of ice, Wade was walking on the thin stuff.
“In this weather?” Thor chuckled. “I suppose frozen things DO bother you very little…” He stuck out his hand and Mjolnir flew to it easily. Shouldering it like an ax, the Asgardian shot Loki a smile and was silent for a moment. “If you are truly here just to vacation, as we are, then this would be the first day in a long while that we met and were not enemies. As always, I hold out hope that it could be true.”
He turned to Steve and clapped him on the shoulder. "Let's do it. Starting now."
"We could...go to your room." Clint shrugged a shoulder. "You know, just to relax. Maybe eat some more pizza. Stare at paperwork."
"Cupid, you come outside with me, you get struck by lightning," the Hulk told him, seeming more amused than anything. Unfortunately, when he smiled he looked rather like he was happily plotting to smash Loki's head in, so that didn't really make the blonde relax any.
"The uh, other me ran off. Shouldn't you follow him or something?"
This week-long vacation had been in the works for months. Nick Fury himself had suggested it and had been working on it for months, guarding it as closely as any other secret. It took careful planning and dozens of highly encrypted messages, coordinating heroes from all over the place to cover the Avenger’s usual area of operation.
“Yeah?” Peter sighed, his shoulders slumping defeatedly as he shoved the backpack back on. “So I’m gonna ruin that, too. Great, I feel even worse now. Thanks.”
"Does he value you?" Ouch. If he had to ask...
"Have you still not put the pieces together?" Doom grumbled, lowering his hand. He seemed a bit deflated by such a response, actually. "Thor, too, is only a pawn in the schemes of Doom. He is the key, however—the one who can deliver what I desire demands the Asgardian in return. Childishly simple to do!"
"He did that in the car," Clint told her with a shrug.
"Yeah. I know," the Hulk said flatly, closing his eyes. He quickly shrank back down to Bruce—and slumped to the floor.
It only dawned on him afterward that the wink might have been taken differently than he wanted it to be. That was probably a good thing, considering how his flirting record was going today.
Pulling on a casual and somewhat sleepy appearance, Clint wandered in past them into the hallway. The moment he was out of sight, he darted all the way down the hall to he and Bruce’s room, which was at the back across from the Team parents’ room. Hopefully they didn’t have to listen to any more of Steve and Tony’s ‘differences of opinion’, as Cap put it, while on vacation.
“Okay,” Tony’s voice replied immediately, the irritation in his voice clear for the entire team to hear. “Danger or no, when I say that, you’re supposed to all come charging to my location. Right? Right. That’s how teams work.”
"Gah!" Peter grumbled and rubbed at his eyes with both hands, ducking back inside the room. Hopefully Aunt May was still asleep right now. It was too early for her to be up, and if the power came back on before she noticed, that would be perfect.
"I bet that's him!" Loki said, dashing for the stairs. About three steps. He paused, clutching his side. "Ugh." Glancing back, he waved a hand at Bruce. "Well? Go get him!"
"We could sabotage our own treasure hunt," Bruce mused. "Use the team thing to get the two of them together, have you lure them to some specific place, and lock them in...or something..."
Peter silently apologized to Wolverine for getting his name mixed up in all this. Jeez, it was a good thing none of Spider-Man's loony villains thought to gas him with onion fumes, or he'd be a goner!
Heading back over to Clint, Peter gestured worriedly to the blond’s bleeding arm.
"Pills?" The Jotun sat up on his elbows, taking the glass. "Worth a shot." He took the useless pill and laid back down, stretching an arm over his head and smiling at Bruce. It was worth the sting in his side when Hawkeye growled.
He managed to keep things to a whisper, but was starting to get nervous. Cap and Tony had been gone for a few minutes--it couldn't take that long to get hamburgers from the freezer. Were they deciding whether Wade was in fact Deadpool, the crazy mercenary they kept hearing about in the police reports? Jeez, thank god Tony didn't have his suit right now so he couldn't just jump right to the database with the face recognition software...
"I mean, us New Yorkers, hot dogs are a tradition," Peter added quickly with a nervous smile. "C'mon, Wade, looks like I don't have to shove you back on the train right now after all."
They suddenly heard hurried footsteps in the hallway above them.
"Not right now," he admitted, picking up the round metal piece on the other end and holding it up near Loki's chest. "He's very weak, and he seems exhausted."
Who the hell was this guy?
The web yanked on his wrist abruptly, threatening to pull him backwards in the water.
"Woah!" Wade snickered as they whizzed past the building. "Take it slow, baby—we don't want to end up bug splats. The window cleaners have enough work to do," the cheeky merc said sweetly in his ear.
"Hold it," Tony said, grabbing his shoulder. Really, he wasn't even going to comment after Thor went and said that?
There was most definitely a look exchanged between the two of them, Tony shaking his head the tiniest bit. Probably didn’t want to cause a scene in front of “civilian” Matt, Clint was guessing. Hilarious.
“Good morning!” The teen announced his presence just seconds later as he hurried around the bushes Deadpool had just burst through. Peter was wearing a white tank top and a pair of red and blue trunks that looked an awful lot like his Spider-Man suit’s colors. He had a blue backpack slung over one shoulder. “C’mon, Wade, they’re still having breakfast.”
Miss Marvel made a great centerpiece for the medical room—especially since she glowed. After finding Cap dragging Tony up the stairs from the basement, she had insisted that it was better for everyone to be in one place for now.
"You know, we should probably check on Cap," Hawkeye suddenly realized aloud.
"Sooo...should I call the other Avengers in, or you got this?" Spider-Man called dubiously.
“Sure. That sounds fun.”
“Does Wade do that?” Cap asked, frowning and putting space between him and Tony. It’d be just like Deadpool to expose Peter to the public. A man like that had no respect for the secrets of others.
“Alright, everybody!” Cap called, stepping outside of the cabin with a duffel bag slung over his shoulder. “Let’s load up. I’d like to be home before dark. Did everyone use the bathroom?”
Captain America followed them, scotch glass in hand. Doom probably would have used some kind of mechanical 'virus.' Nanobots or something science-y like that. But if Tony didn't understand it, it must be an actual virus. T'Challa wasn't supposed to be home for days, so he crossed his fingers that the two brilliant men in front of him could figure it out.
"Thor will find him, Cap."
“I’ll be honest, I’m not sure if Peter knows or not. He’s been caught up with helping people, work and applying to colleges. Can you believe some of them turned him down?” Matt shook his head, adding, “I’ll take mine black, please.”
Bruce looked sort of distant as he placed a hand carefully onto the Jotun's side near the arrow, moving his shirt aside with the other to inspect the wound.
Carol grabbed the Enchantress’ leg and flung her back at the mansion.
"Did he say what he wanted? Why take us three?"
"Where's Tony? Can I come out yet?" Clint, the one in the pajamas, groaned.
Tony rolled his eyes.
Glancing at Deadpool, Clint suddenly felt bad for the guy. He was so dumb, he’d never see it coming.
“Ever since I woke up, I started learning about the new world and what issues people are worried about today. Things have definitely changed, but I’m learning.” He gestured after Tony and stood. “Excuse me, Peter. I’m sorry, but I really need to talk to Tony.”
Stepping in after him was…Steve. The blond man carefully turned and shut the door behind him, casting a glance in Tony’s direction. As he noticed that Tony was awake, he gave a small nod in Daredevil’s direction.
"Foolishness," Doom grumbled, stepping past him and swooshing his cloak out to the side with a toss of his hand. "To suffer is your choice, then. You are fortunate to have the hospitality of Doom—many others have never seen the inside of these walls."
The Hulk frowned and looked off to the side. Then he leaned over Loki and poked at the hem of his shirt.
He hadn't meant to destroy it, though. Bruce really loved fishing, and sooner or later he was probably going to be pissed once he found out Clint had taken it. And once Cap figured out Clint had never handed it back to him in the first place...
"That guy had a shotgun, what happened to it?" The blond grumbled, shivering in his blanket.
"Hey big guy." Johnny grinned. "We were just in the neighborhood and decided to drop in." He leaned to look around Thor. "Is the Hulk in there?"
“We aren’t together,” he told Steve, adding a shrug to make it seem more casual than bitter.
"And she loved me riding her—" Deadpool began but was cut off by a hand tightening around his neck. "All...night..." He croaked.
Peter smiled at Wade and Matt one last time and stepped back. Jeez that was a lot of handsome side by side. He had to play it cool or he was gonna make a fool of himself once he got back to New York. Maybe the old Parker bad luck streak was finally broken?
"You are SO lame." Deadpool let go of him, sitting up. A beep sounded from the mercenary's belt, catching his limited attention span for a moment. He pulled out a tiny TV and poked at it.
"Tony, he w-wanted Thor."
He almost sounded excited.
Dammit. He had to get his shit together.
Bruce had collapsed to the floor promptly upon being zapped. The drug in his system ought to have kept the Hulk at bay, prevented his pulse from quickening, but electricity could start or stop a heart entirely...
Peter raised his eyebrows at the door locking part, moving over to lay Wade carefully in the nearest hammock and then sit in front of the two Avengers.
Or be pressed against the one man in the galaxy that Steve found remarkably handsome.
Matt ‘stared’ at him for a long moment, lost in thought.
The marshmallow he was roasting burst into flames suddenly, flaring up bright. Whoa—how much sugar was IN these things? Peter pulled it back and blew on it, sighing.
Bruce went along easily, blinking.
"I...got a little sleep last night."
That guy was so creepy, she thought to herself, following after Tony. He was just so...spidery.
"This is why I didn't want you to leave alone..." Bruce sighed, gently feeling around the arrow wound on Clint's side. "Never mind. I-I can fix this."
"Careful, s-some...wires are still exposed," he gasped.
“’Cause the shortcut will get us there in half that time. Duh!”
He and Clint had decided—well, mostly Clint had decided—to sit out there and wait for the shop to open again. Apparently those sandwiches were REALLY something. It had been pouring rain at the time, and if not for being too exhausted to walk, Bruce wouldn't have agreed to this. Now he sat there, wet and shivering on the bench and pretty sure his scruffy beard made him look homeless.
"Heeey...how are you doing? I thought you'd be showing up, but I figured Deadpool would be with you," he mused.
Rumors about he and Tony being together had been going on since the Avengers formed. Something about the way the two leaders worked together set minds aflutter. Tabloids and newspapers alike were trying to get concrete evidence either way. Peter had heard about it at work a couple of times, as some of his co-workers had camped outside the Avengers mansion with telephoto lenses last Valentine’s Day. As Steve started to sit out buns, he looked back at Peter.
"A-hem. Captain America and the other Hawkeye need us to go rescue them right now," Carol interrupted. "What if they're being tortured somewhere, or they're DEAD?"
"Woo hoo! I wonder if that creepy undead grandma survived the nuclear blast? Man, she was so scary—I hope she comes back and eats Stella. You know, premarital sex and all that."
It sounded like Tony might actually like him—which was so unexpected that Cap wasn’t sure what to do except quietly stand there and see what Peter wanted to talk to him about. Please, God, let it not be about Tony.
“Planned what?” Steve asked, crossing his arms over his chest.
"It will not stop bleeding!" The slim demigod growled, sitting up and glaring down at his side. Now that he wasn't sporting his Clint disguise, he looked crazy pale. As he lay back down, he held a hand out to Thor. It was an odd move for Loki.
"Alright Doombot, step away from the nerd." Hawkeye nocked an arrow, aiming it at his double.
When the archer returned, Bruce was back where he’d been standing before, and casually helped set the last few rocks into the ring.
As tempted as he was to hold Tony’s hand, Cap resisted. In a moment or two they’d be down on the shore with both Thor and Bruce, though. When else?
“Alright, capitano! What’re we making?”
he thought tiredly. At least they had a whole bottle with them.
Tony wiped wet hair out of his eyes and shook his head.
"Wait a minute, l-let it sink in."
“Was it a bear?” Steve asked, alarmed as he stepped up to Hulk.
A fire truck pulled up, and a fireman jumped out to set up his hose.
"Deep breath, Bruce. I need your help." Captain America gave him a firm nod. "Jarvis t-told us that Miss Potts is outside for some...reason. It doesn't m-make any sense. I'm on my way to check on her...but I might need back up."
"Um." Cap paused for a second, face flushing faintly. "I j-just...How do I u-undo this? Your power is g-getting very low."
Taking note of the fun reaction that he could get from the actual Hawkeye, Loki smiled at Bruce sweetly.
“Of course,” the AI replied easily.
“Barton, what are you DOING?” Steve asked, leaning to grab the tackle box. Both blonds stared each other down for a second before Clint relented.
“Oh sure! In fact, we hang out sans the mask too,” Deadpool said, turning to flash Peter a cheeky grin.
"It's the only tower in town," he replied distractedly, focusing on getting them down to ground level. They could walk a few blocks—then Deadpool wouldn't have to be all cuddly all the way there.
The blond froze, staring at the buttons being undone. What...in Midgard.
"Jeez, did Deadpool tell you about me?" Peter shot back dubiously.
"Are...you alright?"
"You will all be well taken care of," Doom said, as if offended they might think otherwise. While staying in his DUNGEON.
"Probably serrated. I was in a hurry, so I didn't look at the tip much." He leaned down and looked at the arrow in Loki's side. "Hm. Looks painful."
It was hot enough that the rock was warm against his back and Clint took the opportunity to lay down.
“How’s the ‘mermaid’ sandwich taste?” Chewing, Clint checked on his treasure hunting buddy.
Looking excitedly to Peter for confirmation, Cap sipped on his coffee.
Bruce blinked a few times, and the green in his eyes seemed to melt away, leaving the brown that had been underneath all along. He groaned softly and brought a hand up to his forehead.
Tony blinked at them, then shook his head.
If it was Peter, they were in trouble if he had spotted them standing like they were. Then again…
Rolling her eyes, Carol headed out the door.
“If that’s Hulk, tell him he’s just gonna have to deal with me and you being a thing.”
Bruce blinked, glancing down at the blond's hand over his and then back to his face.
"Hah," Tony muttered, swigging his root beer. "So you admit you've been avoiding me. Great, that makes me feel better."
“Oh, yeah, of course I do!” Peter’s sort-of-boyfriend looked at him for help and then coughed. “I can eat my weight in tacos.”
Cap took a breath. No. He couldn’t stay stranded out here with Tony. Sooner or later, he’d give in to temptation and admit to his feelings. Gambling the most dear friendship he’d ever known wasn’t something he was willing to do.
“S-so, Cap and Tony must be having trouble in p-paradise!”
Clint stared down at him, trying to judge which one of Spidey’s crazy baddies was tall and blond.
Oh boy, Pepper thought tiredly.
“Sure!”
"Maybe we should wait and see? If we barge in it might make him run off—at least this way we know where he is."
“Hey,” Clint protested weakly, frowning at the shirt as Wade hurried to join his boyfriend.
“Oh? Aye, of course…” Taking his hand, Thor shook it heartily, smiling. “I am glad to meet you, Matt.” Growing solemn, he added worriedly to both Matt and the others, “I have had little luck in locating Peter. I flew over the mountaintop twice and the only clue I could find was…well…” Releasing Matt’s hand, he turned and picked something up from the table beside the campfire.
Clint smirked to himself, but didn't comment. Instead, he looked around the darkly lit room, his blue eyes pausing on the high ceilings.
Thor looked after him, but did not follow. The bathroom was just one door down the hallway, and now that the mansion was shielded, they didn't need to watch either Clint so closely.
“Weird, I didn’t think you or Hulk could sunburn.” Clint started gathering up the cards and stacking them into a deck again. “I suppose it’s just more proof that you guys are totally different people.”
Tony had given up on trying to call or text Peter before Cap and the others even left. The camp was very quiet with just him and Peter’s apparent lawyer friend Matt, who had stayed put in his chair. The campfire crackled softly, and the metal coffee pot clinked as Tony picked it up from the table near his tent.
Bruce looked at the two of them rather blankly. Had Clint been saying what he'd thought he heard? The Hulk was pretty sure he had, because he was commenting on it in Bruce's head.
Beside him, Peter heard Wade sniffle too.
“You mean Bruce actually managed to hit something?” Came the dubious reply. Tony seemed to think the team was pranking him or something, because when Steve came into view with Wade and the arrow sticking out of him, Peter heard him add in bemusement, “Wait, seriously? Oookay, first aid kit’s right here—you patch him up while I call 911.”
To his surprise, there was no protest. No pursuit or even so much as a comment from behind him.
"Tony, are y-you alright?" Within seconds, he was at Tony's side, looking him up and down for damage. "We were starting to worry."
"What took you so long? The power's been out for a couple hours."
"Who would capture them?" Thor hurried after him. "It is Captain America, so perhaps...the Crimson Head?"
Peter decided now wasn't a time to gripe about how he actually hated mixing ketchup and relish. He shot a piece of web up to the nearby stoplight, swung them across the street the way they had come, and proceeded up the sides of the buildings, zig-zagging them back and forth between two as they climbed higher.
“What? Pft! It was totally self defense! Stop getting off topic!”
"Only Tony can scan him like he did for you and the other Hawkeye," he told the blonde quietly, looking up at him. "In his armor. He can't do that until the power's back on or Cap's cure is done, though."
Loki froze. Well. That had backfired.
Peter hurried after, sitting next to Cap since Tony still had Clint to keep him company. Bruce had stooped to grab a long stick from the pile of driftwood they were using for the fire and then headed off down the beach, using it like a walking stick. That left Cap pretty much alone on this side of the fire with Peter. Laughter echoed through the night as the volleyball game started up again.
Peter stared up at him.
"Do you seek to detonate him while you are away?" Thor looked at it worriedly.
HOW? How was kind-hearted, innocent, mild mannered Peter Parker involved with those two?
“We trust you to make your own choices, Peter,” Cap said as he moved closer to rest a hand on the dark-haired man’s back, giving Tony a pointed look before he continued. “I’m glad you have someone you can talk to. There’s certainly something to be said for having trustworthy allies."
If there was any truth to THAT idea, then it must have been very difficult to balance. The moment Bruce’s heart rate increased, he’d change to the Hulk. There was a chance that Hawkeye and Bruce had never actually been together, then.
The scientist blinked and quickly looked away from him, down the hallway. Was that a bit of a blush on his cheeks?
"Uhh. Okay." He took Bruce's hand and knelt down beside him, mumbling, "This feels...formal."
“Good morning. You’re up early. It’s not even eight.” Cap told him brightly, pouring more batter into the iron before he went to get a cup of coffee for his friend and handed it to him.
"Did you two just get electrocuted?" Pepper stared at them worriedly.
"Don't worry mom—we put the sharp sticks away." He glared at the mortal man he was using for support, who smirked back.
Again, Steve glanced at Tony, grateful that Matt couldn’t see him doing so.
Bruce stepped over and reached a hand out, touching Clint's forehead lightly. At arm's length, like he had to keep his distance.
As Deadpool was pulled up onto the roof, he gave Peter another big hug, smashing the hotdogs onto his back.
“I heard it too,” he admitted, speaking softly and sitting up. He frowned. The laugh reminded him of a few people, and none of them good people.
What was wrong with him? He was going to make himself anxious at this rate, and that would be a stupid thing to do. He was too smart to do that, especially out here.
"Hey, Cap," he said, waving.
"Yeah, I noticed," Clint chuckled, walking over. He paused in front of Bruce, looking down at him. "I can tell. Look. We can skip the sandwiches if you want. I know...uh." He shrugged a shoulder, mumbling and staring down at his feet. "You know."
Propping an elbow on Hulk’s head, Hawkeye sulked. Where were all the bad guys? Why was everything so PEACEFUL and QUIET? He needed someone to shoot at to take his mind off of the idea of him and Hulk making out!
Loki heard Hawkeye’s voice first.
"Is it permanent?"
"Yes, I'm just checking something," Bruce replied absently, focusing on the computer screen. He did not turn around, and the clack of the keyboard actually disguised Loki's footsteps as he slipped away.
"Oh yeah—like I want to go get wet again." Clint eyed the hovering hand. "Come on. We'll take a pizza."
"Man, I thought you guys were all goody two shoes. When'd you start harvesting organs?"
"Ooh, a couch? I love sleeping on couches," Peter said cheerfully. "This's your vacation I crashed, Cap--it's the least I can do to sleep on the couch and let you have your hammock. Besides, a couch is kind of cramped for somebody like you to fit onto, isn't it?"
Tony had that suspicious look again, but he suddenly smiled and waved at the campfire.
This only seemed to anger Loki. He moved closer as well, looking down on Clint with a sneer.
"You really shouldn't be on your feet right now. Why isn't Tony with you?" He gestured to the lights overhead. "The power's back on, sort of."
The Jotun sat down willingly. First, he had to get away from the monster and his shoulder angel. Then, he had to find that lab. Breathing carefully, Loki stared down at his side and then up at Bruce, mustering up his best puppy-eyed look.
“Uh,” Clint started, taking the offered pills. He didn’t have any water so he just tried to think of lemons. Yuck. As soon as he managed to get the pills down, he gave Bruce a nervous smile. “You okay there?”
Clint deflated, stepping lightly into the elevator.
“If you mean from ‘across the water’, then yes, I’m pretty sure that’s who he meant,” Bruce said, poking the first aid kit with one finger like it might jump at him. He glanced at Clint and then back at it, and for no apparent reason, his eyes were glinting green again. “Sorry I can’t turn back into Hulk so you have something more comfortable to sleep on. Steve and Tony made it sound really important for me to stay me all weekend.” He shrugged as if to add ‘I have no idea why.’
“Sure thing bugs!” Wade practically shouted, spinning away from Hawkeye and trotting off like he hadn’t a care in the world.
"Me?” Matt asked, quirking an eyebrow. “You know me. I’m very good at reading people. Wade’s all over the place, but he always has you on his mind. I say give him a shot. He’s not so bad. An acquired tasted, for sure.”
"SPEAK, or you will anger Doom!" The masked man already sounded angry, to be honest.
“Don’t just blame the Hulk, either,” Tony said grimly. “Thor said you were in a bad mood yesterday, and you’ve been avoiding even camping near us all weekend. First their tent got flattened, then Matt’s cane and glasses disappear? No way that’s a coincidence.” He frowned, waving his hand at Bruce for emphasis. “Everybody has a lousy day once in awhile, that I get, but what kind of twisted person takes that out on the one normal civilian and DISABLED person around?”
The brunette switched the phone off of speaker and held it up to his ear, laughing nervously.
Tony frowned and looked over his shoulder in the direction of the metallic sound since the voice was kind of muffled by rain. He didn't stop leaning on the car, though. The voice didn't SOUND like any super villains he knew...
“Uh, yep, yeah, we should find him,” Peter said quickly, blushing as he recalled how he’d felt watching Loki flirting with Matt just a few minutes before. “Hey, uh, Matt, listen. I kind of wanted to say something before we find Wade again.” He glanced down the hallway to be sure Thor and Loki weren’t still within earshot. They had already disappeared into their room again. Peter did his best not to follow where THAT train of thought was headed.
Seeing Loki struggling, Thor blinked and slipped an arm around his shoulders, helping him sit up carefully.
“Found some! Whoa, what a hike, man,” Deadpool announced, coming back into their tiny campsite and proudly dropping a literal handful of twigs onto the pile beside the fire. He plunked down beside Peter and grinned at him, slinging an arm over his shoulders.
Thor rushed to his friend’s lab. Pausing only once he was inside the lab, he spotted Tony seated on the floor.
His fiance looked just as regretful about not being able to kiss him, frowning.
“We’ve managed to tell exactly one person about us,” Tony continued, tossing his hands up in the air. “Meanwhile the Hulk’s knocking trees down, Thor’s playing double agent, Hawkeye’s about to pass out from blood loss, and then there’s PETER over there with way more game than I ever had at his age! So much for a vacation, huh? Loki’s just the smug horny cherry on top.”
“It's a date.”
"Is who scary?" Pepper sighed, only half-listening. She was bothered by how Bruce had said that Tony "fixed the power and had to stay there." What had he done?
Okay. He’d known that already, right? Spidey was apparently in a throuple situation. But good God, in front of Cap and Tony? Was Daredevil suicidal?
Cap didn’t follow Peter, turning to stare at Tony with alarmed blue eyes.
“Blessing for what? Destroying Spider-Man’s career?”
Peter's alarm sounded off loudly. It was barely beginning to get light outside.
Clint started toward the cabin again. It wasn’t like he was in a hurry to be around everyone else, it was just hard to make love confessions over the roaring storm.
Watching Tony’s back as he left with Wade, Cap wasn’t sure what to think.
“Shh! We gotta talk. Come on.” Clint waved for the kid to follow him and took a few steps back down the hallway, hoping that he’d get the idea.
Feeling exposed, Cap cleared his throat to address his new partner.
“Doesn’t that make it hard to sleep?” Cap asked, worried. “Do you have to focus on staying stuck to the roof?”
"Get off my bike."
"Doom didn't just want you guys to trade back for an Arc reactor, did he."
Had drunk Clint been braver than sober Clint? Because that would be really bad…
“Two hours and twenty three minutes,” Steve told him, drifting up to Tony with a big smile. The blond man treaded water easily, circling around Tony. “Don’t tell me you want more coffee? Let’s paddle out farther and I’m sure you’ll feel more awake.”
“Maybe you should let him wake up on his own?” Steve called after him. “God,” he sighed, stepping over with Tony. “What about bears?”
“About that,” Steve began, stopping at Thor’s side and looking up at him gingerly. “Would you be able to stay a bit longer? There was some trouble in camp last night and Tony and I have to talk with Hulk before he hurts someone.”
The second archer frowned at him, then back to Tony.
“Just one,” Matt chuckled, gesturing toward the cabin. “I should go change.”
There was indeed a hotdog stand there, even so early in the morning. A tall, gaunt man stood behind the stall, bony white fingers holding a hotdog in one hand and a bottle of ketchup in the other.
Behind Thor, not far down the beach, Peter noticed a gaggle of young kids racing with a bucket full of water carried between two of them.
"Look, we went out, waited for the shop to open, he freaked out, we came back and he freaked out again." All true. Ish.
“If they really are together, I think we should know about it.”
“Oof! Thanks,” Tony managed, muffled by his shoulder. Despite himself, he sounded a little less grumpy now.
Spider-Man crossed his arms, watching this.
“I mean, that’s what you guys are doing,” Peter pointed out, shrugging. Wow, maybe he could get away with hiding the fact that he and Wade were dating after all if Cap and Tony thought that was all that was going on. Maybe if they thought it was a ‘just friends’ situation they wouldn’t go digging too deep into Wade’s history. Hopefully.
He couldn't see Bruce in the water behind him--he must be underneath the surface. A wave washed over Clint, and the whole world seemed to sway along with it.
It was so strange having a whole actual conversation with Bruce. There were no papers or fishing poles in sight, and he was focused right on Clint, his greenish eyes fixed right on—
"If you insist." Grumbling under his breath, he hauled Loki off of the couch, almost toppling over from the Jotun's weight. "Hey, hey. Stay awake." He patted Loki's cheek.
"That's not a good idea." Bruce frowned. "An Arc reactor at that size doesn’t replenish that fast. If it runs down, his heart will fail—and he KNOWS it, too." Steve was pretty sure not ALL of the green in his eyes was due to whatever hand stabbing he'd mentioned. In fact, his eyes were looking greener by the minute.
Steve watched him go with a sigh.
Tony sighed.
"I hate anchovies," Clint muttered darkly as he hugged his blanket up to cover his chin.
Running his hand over his face, he sighed.
"Yeah," Hawkeye mumbled, pulling out his card out now that it worked again and pressing the button. "Hey Thor—you alive out there?"
"They both know Hulk better than me, but I'll do my best," Bruce promised. "We've got to figure out what's going on with them. Once we do, promise me we'll talk it over before we do anything to try and mediate, okay?"
“Very well, perhaps a documentary is on somewhere,” Jarvis mused. The TV screen flickered through various channels a few seconds at a time.
Not usually a good sign.
“Well…” He mumbled.
Puffing the fire out with one breath, Cap frowned at him.
The Hulk went back over to the couch, too—to check on Loki, annoyingly enough.
Tony glanced after the last of the buttons.
“I was on my way down the trail from that scenic overlook by Peter’s campsite,” he said quietly, “and I ran into a bear.”
Taking a breath to settle his thoughts, Cap couldn’t help a glance back at the bonfire. Tony and Clint were drinking together right then, joking and chatting away. If they WERE dating and had had problems, hopefully they were all solved with a drink and a smile.
The stairwell was like a big cave—echoing far off thunder and pounding rain on the roof. It was almost surreal.
"I do know how to meditate, Clint." Bruce sighed, looking at him with a blend of sadness and exhaustion. "I'm worse at it when I'm this tired, though. I-I'm so tired...of all this." He brought a hand up and rubbed at his forehead, covering his eyes.
The last was added so casually…
"I knew it," the demigod growled.
Steve sat up a bit, wheezing.
“Uh, nothin’. Just forgot my sunscreen,” he lied thinly, glancing at Bruce, his eyes drifting to the man’s regular clothes. “You know, I have a couple of spare shirts if you want to wear something that won’t make you SWEAT to death.”
Steve shifted to the side a bit to bring Tony closer.
Bruce looked nonplussed about Wade’s antics, as usual.
Bruce stood there gripping the pizza box tightly, listening to his heart thud speedily in his chest. It was just somebody at the door, he told himself, glancing that way very carefully.
"No, I'm fine!" Loki insisted. "It looks a lot worse than it is." Or not. He couldn't remember the last time he had actually bled so badly. "Besides, I know you don't have a Ph.D." He snorted, trying to sound amused.
Without any hesitation, Thor took his brother's hand and squeezed it reassuringly.
A thought came to Cap’s mind suddenly—did Matt know if his two friends were dating?
Clint hopped down and came over next to him, giving a small shrug.
“I won’t play your sick games!” Deadpool announced, leaning to take Peter’s hand in his. “He’s mine. Back off!”
Bruce took hold of his shoulders and steered him back over to sit on the couch.
“That’s an interesting thought, but you’re dead wrong.” Slinging the pair of jeans over his shoulder, he gestured back at the door with a hand. “I’m not the one you should be talking to. That’d be Wade. He and Peter were friends way before I came along. There’s no way they aren’t dating.”
"Does that mean I'm free?" The Clint with the blanket asked, half stepping out of the cell. "Um, where's Bruce anyway?"
As soon as he explained the plan, he cringed. No, no, no. That meant Bruce was talking to Cap—who he may have a crush on. Then again, if Bruce wanted to matchmake Tony and Cap, how serious could it be?
Turning to Matt, Peter offered his arm. “If the weather’s still messing with you, hold onto me and c’mon—I had a second part of the plan to send Hawkeye and Dr. Banner out in their kayak for some time alone, and it might not be too late to still pull that off.”
Was that the Spidey Sense tingling just thinking about that talk with his ‘dads’, or just nerves?
“Our cabin,” Steve said from beside Tony, turning to look back at the building. Then he was looking at Tony. “You don’t think it’s…Peter’s friend?”
“Why the hell are you worried? It looks like they kissed and made up. Enjoy the peace and quiet while it lasts—they’ll find something to bicker about again sooner or later.”
"Why would you even want to?" Bruce asked. "I'm not that attractive. I'm kind of a mess."
Honest conversations with Steve were easy when it was honesty about anything but the two of them. What was he even thinking, saying all of that to Steve outright? If he'd just stayed ambiguous about whether he might have feelings for Steve or not, the man probably wouldn't be able to tell one way or the other. Tony was pretty good at putting on the cool and collected facade.
“Daredevil?” Cap asked, his voice still sad. He looked after Peter, frowning. “He’s a vigilante.”
Bruce looked at him with a bemused little smile, like he'd just been asked something ridiculous.
"I don't actually know who did it," Johnny said, leaning over to stare into the card closely. "Everybody's gone and Herbie's trashed."
Loki took a deep breath, meeting Bruce's eyes with what he hoped was a calm gaze. He hadn't noticed the scientist's stubbly beard before. Then again, he didn't look at him very much. The Hulk should be able to break out of whatever the field was, right? If not, Loki might be stuck in there too. To be fair, he hadn’t actually tried getting out of Ms. Marvel’s dome yet.
Clint pinched the tip of his tongue with his teeth, taking a breath.
Clint didn't seem to notice though.
It was a silly thought, but if a villain had actually fallen in LOVE with Peter, there was a chance that his goodness might be a catalyst for change. Some of the villains in the world had gotten that way through no fault of their own and maybe, just maybe, one of them wanted a way out.
Scooping Peter up against him, Wade dipped him dramatically. Just as Peter was beginning to wonder if he’d get dropped, Wade leaned to kiss him.
With the campfire and the stressful conversation, Peter hadn’t noticed that some clouds had moved it to cast shadows on the beach.
Both sets of footsteps stopped behind Peter as he heard Wade speak again.
“You ripped all of these,” he heard Cap say, sounding distraught.
"Are you injured, ma'am?"
The rain and wind howled across their little sandbar, making loud hollow thunks on the upturned kayak behind them, and there was no other sound but the waves.
Bruce busied himself with working on some mixtures, hopefully for Cap's cure. Now that the power was back up, he probably ought to take advantage of it.
"You're supposed to be unconscious by now," the driver grumbled back at them. Not panicked, just irritated, like he was complaining about the bad weather or something. He jerked his arm away, tearing his shirt sleeve in the process, and took the wheel again with a snicker. "Forget it—we're almost there."
"SHHH!" Deadpool hushed, struggling to try and put a finger to Peter's lips. "Don't tell Wolvie!" He whispered loudly.
"Okay, fine, we'll go get some hot dogs," he said.
Deciding to save Tony, Steve stepped up beside him and turned a couple of pages of the paper to the article about Hulk and Hawkeye—instead of the one about Steve and Tony kissing.
“Not Rogers!” Loki laughed, leaning forward to give Peter a very sly smile. “The archer.”
"Sitting in a boat...bobbing on the water and just being. I've never even caught a fish."
"A third Hawkeye," he said flatly, frowning. He wasn't really unhappy to see Hawkeye, but the Hulk was laughing his green butt off somewhere inside Bruce's head. Of all the people to develop an attachment to, he had to pick the one all of the imposters pretended to be.
The previews started on the TV, showing trailers for some pretty silly movies. In the lineup was 'The Hand that Crawled,' 'Attack of the Sharkgods' and 'Zombies Arr Pirates 2.'
Tony peeked over the rock and out at the demigod. Sitting back down, he scooted closer and leaned against Steve’s side, hugging around his waist with one arm.
“WADE! I’m Wade!” The man said quickly, still shaking Steve’s hand. “Sorry, short attention span.” He laughed nervously and finally let go of Cap’s hand, offering his hand to Tony next.
"Huh?" Bruce was taken aback by that reply. "Robot? Oh. No, no—l-listen, I have no doubt that I'm talking to the real Clint. That didn't even cross my mind..." He shrugged halfheartedly. "I was worried about the other guy...maybe smashing your bed up, too. You know?"
"I know, I—we—thank you. It was a bad idea," Cap said nervously, walking with more purpose. "We should just stay focused on what's important, then. Like saving the world," he added a bit sadly.
“That’s what sunscreen’s for,” Clint muttered.
"Huh? You say something?" Peter glanced at him, making his eyes extra wide and blinking to feign innocence.
Tossing his hands up, Clint spun and plunked down on the edge of the balcony. It overlooked the beach, giving him a clear view of where everyone was.
"Well, you are a little...thin," Clint said, looking Bruce up and down. He shuddered, his teeth chattering. "I guess I b-better go back to b-bed."
"Hey, I know you're busy with work AND your regular job, so if you can't it's okay," he said easily. "But if the guy's gonna sue you KNOW it'll take him longer than a couple of hours."
"Ah...I don't really remember much about last night," Bruce admitted, smiling uneasily. He glanced up at the bed and then began to get to his feet. "Why would they think that?"
"It m-must be the storm," Cap rasped. "The mansion's back up s-systems will come on soon."
Crinkling the faded card in his hands, Cap stared down at his words, considering each one very carefully. It was a good thing the note card was so small or he would have rambled on forever.
A third Hawkeye? Was there some Skrull factory in a warehouse somewhere, just making Hawkeyes to confuse them?
"Look. I know you guys think I'm the fake! The other me gets to run around free, but I get locked up? You're gonna be sorry when he shoots Tony!"
“I’m all for acceptance, but if they’re really together, I think we should have a talk with Peter without Deadpool there,” Tony said, frowning. “He’s a teenager. I don’t think it’s overreaching for us to be concerned about him dating a dangerous guy who’s way too old for high school.”
Letting go of his bow, Clint crossed his arms. It wasn’t his place to tell Peter he was dating an idiot or that cheating was the worst. He’d leave that to Cap and Tony.
Encouraged, Peter waved his hands as he spoke to try and illustrate the scene.
There was a loud scream as a random burglar was devoured by another baby.
"C'mon, you know the kid better than that. There isn’t an evil bone in his body," he pointed out, "and he doesn't stand there and let other people be evil without stopping them, either. Are we talking 'code names' secretive or 'even I don't know who he really is' secretive?" He stopped short, eyes widening. "What if he's with a SHIELD agent!"
Shrugging, Peter turned to Wade and held the plastic disc up.
Tony Stark’s voice snapped Hawkeye awake from his well-earned and much needed cat nap. Something in Tony’s tone of voice told Hawkwye that it REALLY wasn’t as important as falling back asleep. He and Hulk had been out on a very boring patrol. Not even the bad guys wanted to do anything with the damned heat of the day. It had been above the mid-90s all day, sapping what little energy Hawkeye had.
As sudden as the weight had appeared, it let up and Peter glided forward.
"I think Cap better be on the team opposite me, or that's just not fair," Peter said sheepishly, coming over to stand with Wade. He shot Cap a look that was way more apologetic than necessary for that suggestion, adding, "Uh, if you even wanna play with us."
Deadpool went soaring off the roof top too, being punched in the face by a very angry Wolverine.
Well, nobody would guess THIS guy was Spider-Man, at least...or capable of things like climbing skyscrapers without accidentally killing himself, either. Ugh.
"That's what I said."
“What if THAT Hawkeye was the fake, you ever think of that?” Clint snapped sarcastically, glaring daggers at Miss Marvel.
"No, I just almost fell down a staircase, that's all. Tony..." She turned to him unhappily. "Realistically, how long 'til this arrangement fails and hurts you?"
We'll be posting one chapter per week on Tuesdays for this fic, and you can expect at least 10 chapters and 40,000 words before all is said and done. Without further ado, please enjoy some domestic Avengers shenanigans. Comments and kudos are always appreciated! ♥
"HULK," he rumbled out, moving closer. "Not puny Banner!"
No, wait. That was Thor!
Tony jumped up enough to grab the frisbee out of the air, despite how fast it was traveling. He shook his hand out, wincing good-naturedly.
"Glad you made it, boys."
"Still. It had to be boring," Loki sighed. "Why are we going downstairs?" He didn't know exactly where the archer's room was, but he did know that it was upstairs.
"I'm going to go check on Thor and...the Clints." Carol headed out the door.
Peter cringed as a twig cracked under his sneaker the moment he put his weight down onto it. Out of instinct, he hopped onto the side of the nearest tree, sticking a hand to Wade’s chest and hauling him behind the trunk to keep him out of sight.
"I'm Peter--nice to meet you! I think we'll be around for a couple weeks, judging by how much luggage everybody brought. I kind of came with at the last minute," he explained awkwardly.
“Whoa,” Clint mumbled, frowning. “Well, THAT'S depressing.” Tugging Bruce along again, he gave in and held his hand. Whatever. The guy didn’t have a problem with it yesterday.
The inside of the cabin was dark. Either nobody bothered with turning the lights on or the power was out. Considering how expensive the resort was, it was much more likely that no one was there.
Gulp.
Bruce looked at him and exhaled slowly.
The blond raised an eyebrow.
Not waiting for a reply, Loki made for the door as fast as he could without outright running. The door wasn't entirely melted open, though, and he had to slow down to climb out of it, ending up crawling on all fours on the other side before getting to his feet. He grabbed his side, finally standing up. What he would give to just teleport home. Maybe he should?
The car coasted into the green light, and for a moment it was too bright to see anything.
Peter stuck a web to the ceiling and hung from it upside-down, narrowly escaping being hit by Thor's charge into the room.
"Sure, but he's the fake."
"Super senses, especially touch, smell, and.." Tony glanced the way Matt and Wade had gone dubiously. "...Hearing." Right. There was no way Daredevil hadn't been able to hear every word they'd said standing this close, even if it was pouring rain.
The blond smiled back, cell phone forgotten for a moment. His smile was surprisingly warm. Clint swiped his hair back too and gestured down the street as he tucked the now wet phone away.
“While we’re on the topic of dating…” Turning on his heel, Clint grabbed the front of Deadpool’s shirt and yanked him close. “You hurt Peter and I’m gonna put you through a wood chipper. Got it?”
Peter felt a little tingle up his spine. Now was that the Spidey Sense or just old-fashioned being creeped out?
That left Thor, who wouldn’t look behind the couch without a good reason—just like he wouldn’t TAKE the box without a good reason. He hadn’t heard about the box being here and therefore, he had no motivation to move it.
"We're friends too, right?" Clint tried, holding out his arms wide. "Let's go smash stuff in the training room. Work out some of that rage."
Somehow he doubted it was a proposal. That would be kind of priceless, actually. The blond man didn't finish his sentence though, instead leading Tony to the door.
"Hey, he's red..." He mumbled something under his breath and then leaned back down to look at Spider-Man. "Hotdogs?"
Disturbed by the idea that Peter would date anyone like himself, Cap focused on the task at hand.
Okay, bad phrasing. Whatever.
“Man, I liked those shorts,” Clint quipped, climbing painfully to his feet and offering Bruce his hands to help him up.
Loki sighed, turning his attention back to the Hulk.
“A little time alone sounds fantastic,” he murmured, leaning in to reply to Steve just because it was a nice excuse to get that close to him. They’d had to act strictly professional around the other members of the team for weeks. It was driving him crazy.
"Well, yeah, but everybody knows who you guys are," Peter said glumly. "He's actually a huge fan of you, Cap, he wasn't just saying that. I think he has Captain America socks somewhere."
With a frown, Steve pushed Clint aside with very little effort and reopened the trunk, fishing out the tackle box. He dropped it into Clint’s arms.
"Why are you helping me?"
Watching the two of them move to start another game up, Tony did his very best not to give Cap any side eye. He would just be looking glum, he'd been looking glum for over an hour now. Too bad getting drunk on root beer was not a thing.
Cap frowned at that thought.
“Court case? Are you a lawyer?”
Pepper looked up at him and nodded.
He shot Steve a meaningful glance as he said it. Matt was safer sticking with them than on his own, between the super villains and the local bears.
“Hey, I’m not Wolverine!” The merc argued. Grabbing Peter, he hauled him a few steps away to whisper to him. Loudly. “What the hell is this guy’s problem!”
Tony followed, still lugging the last two suitcases. Whether he liked it or not, Clint needed a break. He was probably going to be a lot more cheerful tomorrow morning when there was fresh coffee.
“No, Peter’s too smart for that. There has to be another explanation.”
The big green Avenger paused in crumpling a car up like an accordion and actually did turn to look at Hawkeye, snorting in annoyance.
Clint stared, snapped out of it when he tipped his coffee and spilled it over his hand. Shaking his hand quickly, he couldn’t help staring.
Just across the thinner Southern section of the water sat a campsite with big brightly colored tents in a circle. There had to be at least four or five. In the middle of the camp sat a fancy barbecue grill, a handful of folding chairs, stacks of coolers and lots of other camping gear.
Shucking the poor onion of its dry skin, Wade slammed it down on the table and chopped it in half with one slice.
Snatching the gauze from Peter, Clint quickly wrapped his arm. They’d be back at camp in an hour, according to Deadpool, so it didn’t have to be perfect.
Tony gave up the pretense of paddling, leaning on his kayak oar and frowning at Steve's back.
"No, but I'll need a needle," PJ Clint continued. He looked up at Bruce. "Can I borrow one of yours"?
Spotting Tony near the campfire that Clint was erecting, Cap wished he could just walk up and take him in his arms.
"He's bleeding everywhere," Bruce said of Loki, glancing back at the archer. "Please, just let me dress the wound first."
“You must have missed the sign,” Cap said nicely, gesturing back down the trail. “This is the C loop.”
Bruce glanced at him and fidgeted in his seat. He wished he had some papers or something just so that he could fidget with those instead—a better excuse than just wringing his hands.
"Sorta," Peter said, trying not to give away that he really wasn't expected here in the least. "The Avengers are on the move today—the Hulk trashed town TWICE, Iron Man was flying around earlier, and Thor just flew here now, so I'm checkin' in to see if they need a hand or anything."
"Gee, thanks."
Thor was a big fan of coffee.
“I used to hate the guy,” he continued, focusing on the coffee with a small frown. “We’d fight all the time and everything. Now that I’ve gotten to know him, though, I realize he’s different than people treat him. You probably get a lot of that, yourself, I’ll bet. People just assume you’re a crazy evil guy and forget there’s a person in there, and that most people need love.”
"My only plan is to hang out and try not to look at my phone. I have to keep it on in case Aunt May calls," he explained guiltily, glancing at Tony. The billionaire gave a little snort.
"Ooh, sarcasm," Tony replied drolly.
He sighted a very disheveled-looking Bruce Banner, dressed in what looked like pajamas, stepping over to pile another blanket around Clint's shoulders. Both of them had damp hair, like they had just been out in the weather, but Dr. Banner didn't seem to have caught the chill that Clint had.
Unable to help a smile, he stepped around Tony to give Thor a hug.
Bruce sighed and took a seat at the table, leaning on it heavily with his arms folded in front of him.
"Man! This place is huge! You know, I'm rich too. Maybe I should build a mansion and get a team together. We can totally call ourselves the 'Revengers!'" Deadpool did a fist pump in the air. "Awesome!" He noticed that Pepper had kept walking and chased after her, practically making circles around her as they walked. "So, they aren't like, scary, right? Are they gonna make us take a chaperone?"
"Hm?" Clint hummed, crawling into bed. Pulling the covers up to his chin, he deflated with a sigh. "Cap and me got kidnapped so they're making Thor babysit me until Tony and Carol get Cap and me back. That’s the gist."
Peter stepped out of the cab and leaned close to the window so that it looked like he was paying their taxi fare to Aunt May. She was already making her way up the front steps and readying the house key.
“Oh right. I forgot about him,” Cap mumbled, rubbing the back of his neck and glancing back out to sea. “He bit our kayak on our way out to the sandbar.” Turning his gaze to Tony, Cap gave him an easy smile. “I suppose we shouldn’t go racing through his home. He’s not bothering anyone where he is.”
“Are you alright?” Cap asked, noticing the blood on his hand and then the arrow. It didn’t even take a second for him to be frowning at Hawkeye. “You told me you scouted and that nobody was camping over here. Good god! We need to get him to the hospital!” Taking Wade around the shoulders, Cap hauled him back toward the campsite, Clint hurrying after him.
"Speak for yourself," Loki grumbled, stepping in closer to Bruce. It could be fun to watch the Hulk throw his teammates through walls, but at this range he'd probably be first in line. However, lots of fun could be had in darkness. He smirked, which probably looked very eerie in the current lighting.
Shrugging, he waved at Bruce.
“—Haven’t been sleeping, at all. I miss my bugsy-wugsy! I even went down to your neighborhood yesterday just for the feels. There was this old woman crossing the street and I HELPED her. She was like REALLY old and called me Spider-Man. DAY. MADE.”
So Tony had rigged the Arc reactor in his chest to supply the basic systems for the mansion. It had enough power to do so for quite awhile, but he couldn't really move away from the cables hanging out of the electrical panel he'd pulled open, in the meantime.
“Good morning!” Thor’s voice echoed across the lake. A glance told Tony that Thor was nearly to the far shore—and making a line straight for the rich campers. He had bigger things to worry about right now.
"Enjoy." He took a long drink from his coffee and examined one of the papers he was half sitting on.
The blond didn't reply at first, looking up at Bruce from under wet hair, confused.
“You should cover that,” he commented over the shush of the falling rain.
“Where is Thor, anyway? And Dr. Banner,” Peter said, glancing around.
"I AM calm!" Clint rubbed a hand through his now tousled hair, squinting and trying to think back on the night before. "We watched a movie and…Whoa!" He sputtered, yanking unsuccessfully on the blankets under Bruce again.
Loki took the glass gingerly. Thor was being his usual overly nice self, but for some reason, the super villain didn't seem to mind. He sipped the glass while leaning awkwardly on his elbow, trying not to put any pressure on his side.
That didn't remind Carol of anybody...
"Yeah, I'll get to that in a minute. First, how's Cap doing? Where is he?" He stepped through the living room door as he said it, and spotted Steve sitting there on the couch.
“Do you see him?” Matt asked, brushing his hair away from his face.
Tony and Bruce were already in a hushed discussion about the readouts on the computer screens, Tony pointing and explaining something. Bruce looked at the readouts worriedly and began to type. What they said may as well have been Greek to Steve—he didn't understand a word of it.
Clint followed the footprints.
“I—” Cap said, stopping himself and looking at Peter. “I suppose. Look, please at least add the bread crumbs and the minced onions.”
"I like fishing..." He sighed again.
"The Fantastic Four are in big trouble—at least, it looks that way, since they're all gone except Johnny. Can we come in?"
"Well he certainly hasn't been in his BED in the last 48 hours..." Jarvis was right back to droll again.
As if on cue, soft footsteps sounded on the steps behind him. Bruce paused beside him on the same step, a rolled up beach towel under one arm and a weary expression on his face. He followed Clint's gaze out toward the beach.
Loki noticed Bruce as he leaned on the back of the couch more heavily, looking over at Hawkeye to see if he'd found a blanket yet. Hawkeye had apparently tried the bathroom instead, returning with a puffy white towel in hand. He offered it to Bruce with a smile.
"I hear word only through what others tell me," Thor sighed, sitting back down. "It would seem that the Captain ails from a poison of some sort. Banner and Stark are working feverishly to create an antidote."
Now Wade’s jealousy over Matt getting attention made even more sense. Whatever Matt said about it, it sure didn’t seem like Wade was okay with sharing if they weren’t with each other…
Dropping the blanket aside, he ran his fingers through his hair in a futile try at making it behave. “And what’s up with Bruce? He just ran off! Forget about bears, now he’s out there with Loki and doesn’t know it. I thought about bringing Identicards, but no, I talked myself into thinking this was gonna be a nice quiet normal camping trip where the biggest thing we’d have to face was telling the team we’re engaged!” He looked like maybe he wanted to pull on his hair, but instead sighed and propped his chin up on one hand. “I just wish we noticed Loki this morning when we were all in one place.”
“Nervous? Are you two together, or do you just like him?” The question would have sounded rude if Cap didn’t look so worried all of a sudden. He pinched the marshmallow off the stick with a graham cracker and added another piece of chocolate on top—Cap really seemed to like to double the chocolate—offering it to Peter next.
He turned to Spider-Man and sighed in good-natured resignation. "Look, kid, as long as your aunt won't freak out if you're gone for a week, you're free to stick around with the Avengers here. You have to lose the suit, though, we're all going low-tech and normal for this."
Bruce turned and looked at the two of them.
"Bruce's analyzing it right now," Tony assured him. Glancing after Pepper as she closed the door, he placed a hand on Steve's shoulder and patted it lightly. "Have a seat, you look exhausted. I could get you some actual water, even, if that'll help."
“I’ll do my best, Bruce, but Tony and I had a…disagreement. I’m not sure he’ll want to talk to me. But I’ll try,” Cap told him adamantly.
Still, now he had to say something.
Surprisingly enough, Clint returned with an armload of kindling and dumped it next to Tony.
Clint was the most foul-mouthed grouchy saint on earth, Tony thought—then glanced quickly at Thor again. Brother? Oh no…
“Ah, man! Loki’s such an asshole!” Stepping past the very obvious Hulk prints, Deadpool squeezed into the half of the tent door that was exposed.
“Aye, that was my thought as well!” Thor chimed in, giving Bruce a big pat on the back and smiling. “Since we need not wait for the coffee to brew, what say we make our way there now?”
Did Wade need to breathe?
A guy as perceptive as Daredevil had to be in denial to think Peter had no reaction to him. The shy smile in the rain the day before came back to Tony's mind, and Matt's handsome, genuine smile back. Yeah, he hadn't imagined that.
Peter would have rolled his eyes if Loki wouldn’t have taken it the wrong way. It was WAY too late for Wade to get away with not even being seen, here, and he had to know it. Denial would get him nowhere once they finally got to talk about this incident.
Speaking of Peter…
"Friendship. Sure, because that's all it is," he grumbled, unable to keep from sounding bitter. "We're in the only place Daredevil can't eavesdrop, and now you don't have anything to say? Really? I think we can handle sticking crayons in the sand and talking at the same time."
Dropping it at his feet, he slumped back and watched the chaos. Despite being soaked and hungry, Clint felt a bit sleepy. All the hiking and swimming must have burned up the last bit of energy he had.
He heard Hawkeye cough and saw him drawing his bow. Before he could fire, he slid down to his knees. Whatever was in the gas affected him too.
Panicking, Peter grabbed Wade around the waist, shot a web into the treetops, and pulled them both up and hopefully out of sight.
"Thank you," he hissed. With that, he got up off the couch, only to be stopped by the real Hawkeye.
“Do you have any maps?” Clint asked the shop attendant, trying to smooth out his frown. It was part of the plan for he and Bruce to go buy something to make flags. It was NOT part of the plan to have Peter along. He had hoped to stop and have ice-cream again, maybe get a chance to hold Bruce’s hand, maybe even…
"I think I already know what you're going to say," he sighed, sifting sand through his fingers. "Hulk hasn't ever had a connection with anybody the way he does with you. Well, except..." A dark expression moved through his eyes like a cloud passing over the sun, and he shook his head, focusing intently on the sand in his hands. "No, actually, not even then."
"Hail, my friends!" Thor smiled, draping one of Cap's arms over his broad shoulders and holding the other blond around the waist. "Come, you must be seated. Iron Man told me that he would follow shortly."
Thor was only just stepping out of the tent, though, and turned around after Tony noticed him. Shrugging on his flannel shirt, he gave the Avengers co-leaders a concerned look. “I assure you, the exploding marshmallow debacle from last night was my own doing. If anyone should be sat down and scolded, it is I!”
Leaving Bruce for a moment, he hurried to check their room and found it empty. It wasn’t like the cabin was big or anything, so he returned to his…boyfriend?
He promptly found himself slapped on the cheek, and the lighter snatched out of his hand. Pepper shook a finger at him.
"Tony. Good to h-hear your voice," Captain America rasped. "You s-shouldn't—"
Steve was actually just standing there, silent, waiting to see what he said.
“I know because awhile back some tabloid assumed the same thing about Cap, and the Bugle was ALL OVER Cap’s reaction, which was complete disgust,” Peter said, wiping sopping bangs out of his eyes. “He made an official statement not to use him to promote hate. And then not long after that, Stark Enterprises made some gigantic donation to support LGBT kids. I didn’t really know Cap or Tony at the time, but I thought that was pretty awesome of them.”
"Wh-what's the verdict?" Steve asked, glancing at the computer displays around Tony.
"Tony. H-he takes care of you, doesn't he Ms. Potts?" He looked at her expectantly.
Steve knew how this worked. Doom would probably pick one of the weaker prisoners, say non-superhumans, and use them as a bargaining chip. The least he could do for them was to play along for awhile and spare Pepper from being harmed, too.
Clint made a grunt, waving a hand in Tony’s direction before shuffling off. It was unclear if that was an ‘I’ll get firewood’ grunt or an ‘I have to pee’ grunt.
Doing a sudden 90-degree turn, Peter swam for the nearest bit of shore instead.
Apparently, Steve took that to mean that he really was dying. He stared back sadly, still holding Tony’s hand tightly. The look on his face told Tony that there was a massively sappy or encouraging speech around the corner.
"Y-you're gonna give me whiplash," Spider-Man whined, glancing nervously at the claws on either side of him. They very narrowly missed jabbing his shoulders. "If you stab me, you're gonna feel really bad, 'cause I'm one of the good guys."
"He didn't get you, so he didn't get everybody," he pointed out, leaning his head back to Johnny's chest to look up at him upside-down. "If it's even Doom."
"This could be serious. I need you to sit down."
“Tony just told me he likes me. I’m so sorry to ask, but I don’t know what to do and…I feel nauseous.”
“Swings both ways?” Cap asked slowly, trying to think of what it meant on his own. After a long pause and some squinting, he gave up. “Um, I suppose,” he said uncertainly, clearing his throat. “I’ll talk to him again and see if I can at least get a name. That would be a good place to start.”
“I hope he calms down after some sun.”
Tony was on the floor in the far corner, wearing only his black undersuit with the blue glowy lines all over it. Pieces of his Iron Man armor were all over the floor. Pepper sat beside him, holding one of the gauntlet-like hands of the armor and looking at it unhappily. Her hair and clothes were damp.
"I'll go check," Steve repeated, stepping out the door abruptly.
Giving a tiny wave at Loki, he smiled nervously.
Puffing out a sigh, Cap sat back down. He ran a hand over his face and turned back to Peter.
Matt sighed under his breath, tucking the phone back into his jacket.
He glanced at Clint guiltily. "That's not all, though. I told Cap you were pretending to flirt with me to misdirect anybody from how you feel about Tony. So, uh, Cap thinks there's something one-sided going on with us, and Tony thinks we're dating. We're probably going to get yelled at either way." He laughed tiredly, shaking his head.
“You may want to follow them,” Cap told Peter, gesturing after the two men. He flipped a patty and then sat it aside on a plate.
"Thanks. I think." Clint yanked the shirt off of his face and sighed. After putting it on, he looked back up at the roof. "Now, where's the food? Ah! And don't drop it on my face!" He added quickly to the roof, holding his hands up to protect his face.
“That’s perfect,” Cap told them from across the big pile of sand, only glancing up for a second. He’d been working on making the castle gate for a good five minutes, frowning and patting the sand hard enough that he probably had to start over a couple times.
“Why would the two of you side by side bring me any discomfort?” He kept his voice low so that Bruce wouldn’t hear him, Steve noticed. “Here or on Asgard, why would that be so?”
“Alright, sit down for a second,” Clint told them. “We’ve got some ideas.”
"So we don't become bug splats," Spider-Man said promptly, dusting himself off and starting down the street without waiting for Deadpool to head that way. "C'mon, I think I saw the sign you were talking about."
Wolverine yanked Deadpool up to be face to face with him, snarling.
"Don't fight in here," the scientist managed a bit faintly. The man was obviously trying to breathe deeply.
"Doom found the card. I'm sure of it," Steve groaned. "We may be here for some time. Maybe I can convince him to let you go..."
“It’s fine,” Bruce said uneasily, glancing at the chair. He didn’t move to sit down, instead sort of wringing his hands. “Why do we need to talk?”
“You’re still bleeding!”
"I think we should go back to the mansion," he said instead, swiping his hair out of his face again. "I-I think sneaking out like we did was a mistake—we're going to worry people. If they think I could just run off, they might decide to lock me up, you know."
"I thought I'd start a bonfire on the beach," Bruce explained, stepping out and then waiting for Clint to follow him. "The beach at night is nice--most other people will go away until morning, and it'll be quiet. Maybe we could scout for a good bonfire spot while we're outside."
“Are you kidding?” Peter raised his eyebrows, pointing up at the sky. “Blame mother nature! We thought Thor was upset about something, but he says he didn’t do it.”
He couldn’t believe it! Hulk had gone into their camp last night and threw a TREE through their tent! Now HE was worried that Hulk was mad at them.
The laughing from the frisbee game had eventually stopped, and the bonfire was no longer crackling. It was just him and the waves rolling in. Sounded like the stars were making the wave noises. Starwaves. Spacewaves. Nice.
Those two really were the parents of the group. If they had an explosive divorce, where would that leave New York? Or the planet, when the next alien conqueror came in?
Tony couldn’t even imagine what it would be like to just ride around in somebody else’s head and watch them live their life, unacknowledged even while present for nearly everything. What a disturbing thought.
The taxi finally came to a stop—so abruptly that the passengers nearly smacked against the cage divider. The driver popped his door open and hurried away across the room like a bomb was about to go off.
Bruce stopped where he stood, looking back. The rain was soaking his hair down to his forehead, but he didn’t particularly seem to mind. It WAS warm rain. The air was so humid it was practically steamy out there. Catching the archer’s lighthearted expression, Bruce quirked an eyebrow and then stepped back, right into Clint’s space. There they were, standing near the top of the stairs getting rained on, faces just a few inches apart.
“While the recent pictures have been proved to be faked, it’s hard to fake a videos from so many different networks!”
Tony glanced after him with a small frown, then snapped right back to making the shiny eyes at Clint. Peter was obviously talking to somebody he knew--it was more irritating that he had his phone on him at all.
“How’d you really meet Peter? He told us you didn’t actually go to college.”
"Well, it's pretty unusual," he agreed, getting to his feet again. "I just don't want to have to think much...and anybody sitting in the rain for hours just for a sandwich sure isn't thinking."
"Captain..." Steve coughed, trying to speak louder with little success. "Captain A-America."
"Anyone alive in here?" Steve called out into the smoke. The air smelled like burning chemicals.
Matt’s expression barely changed as he squeezed Peter’s hands in return.
The mutant jumped after Deadpool, yanking him back out of the wall as the merc cracked his head back into place.
"Hey."
The redhead chuckled at the question, adjusting the blanket around his shoulders.
"No! Just, y'know, around it." Tony made the shape of a dome with his hands, the syringe and large needle still held in one.
“I worry about you, like anybody else in the team,” Clint told him honestly, bracing his arm up for Bruce. “Besides, Hulk’ll tell you that I bleed all the time. Er…well, I guess you’d know that.”
"Well, I have no idea where we're going," Bruce said reasonably, still trying to keep his hair from dripping water into his eyes. It was an uphill battle, and he was rolling backwards.
Carol cringed.
Well, wasn't that convenient. Ordinarily Peter would've questioned it a little more, but right now he just wanted Aunt May as far from Deadpool as possible. Leading his aunt by the arm, he popped open the door of the cab and gestured for her to get inside.
In his weakened state, there weren't many options besides jumping out the window or hiding somewhere, and he was sure Doom had cameras all over the place in here.
Great, he’d just be barging in on everybody’s vacation if he disturbed Hank and Jan, too. Resigned to being awkward, Peter turned and knocked on the leftmost door first.
Steve pulled his hand away from Tony before he remembered that Thor knew about their secret.
“You shouldn’t drink that! Sugar will spoil your appetite. There’s plenty of real food here.” The captain turned and quickly started to take sandwich fixings out of the fridge, placing them on the counter. “Do you like ham and cheese?”
"Alright." Glancing at Tony with a very serious look—as if he'd never see him again—the first avenger pressed the needle against his arm.
His forehead felt warm to the touch and his cheeks were flushed pink.
“Do you see my glasses?” He whispered as Cap’s voice drifted over from the Avenger’s campsite. Peter, Wade and Matt had camped out under a giant tree, but it was still in sight of the campfire and tents.
“No, I’m good. I can hit things once we’re back home. Do you wanna go swimming?”
“About a teaspoon,” Cap replied. There was a pause, then he added quietly, “I should go talk to Clint before we have a big green problem.”
“This is a bad idea,” he grumbled, glancing over at Tony, who was driving.
“You do like to sleep on top of me when I’m the Hulk,” Bruce pointed out, quickly turning to lean his arms on his knees again. That meant he was facing off to the side from where Clint sat. Even from the side, his eyes were practically glowing. Maybe the smexy smile had been overkill.
“No, cousin,” Loki told him quickly, quirking an eyebrow. Leaning a hand on the gate bars, he tipped his head curiously. “He hasn’t called lately. Is he alright?”
Well, Jane Foster was officially an ex, if they'd ever actually been dating in the first place.
“Can you imagine Hulk being stuck in a tiny snow cabin? No, at least this way he has an ocean to splash around in.”
“I apologize. I didn’t mean to overstep boundaries, just...” The captain sighed, glancing after Lola. “Something about that woman bothers me. She seems like she’s after something.”
There was the distinct metallic sound of Mjolnir flinging toward them at frightening speeds. Thor caught the hammer easily, gripped it by the leather strap, and began to swing it in circles. The lawn flattened from the wind power for a moment before they took off into the air quite fast.
"Mm? Yeah, but I gave her surgery." He did a fist pump in the air. "Now baby got back!" Hopping lightly off the roof and rolling to his feet, the mercenary slapped a hand on Wolverine's shoulder. "Thanks for the loan, man!"
“Whoa, hey! I know a shortcut! It’ll get us down there super fast!”
Swallowing a bit too fast, he decided to bite.
“Not recently. They seemed like they wanted some privacy.”
The Hulk shrugged.
"Just how much did he bleed?" Tony paused in the middle of wrapping an arm around Steve's waist, noticing the bloodied bandages on Loki's side. "Didn't Bruce patch him up?"
“Here,” Bruce added, picking out some pills and offering them to him. “While those sink in, maybe I can just clean up the blood a little. Carefully.”
Tony shot Cap a smile. Good call, Steve, he thought. With Clint along, Peter and Wade would have to behave themselves.
“Whoa—Cap, what’re you doing!” Tony’s hands were on his shoulders, pulling him backward. “Jesus, it’s just a meatball recipe, it’s not worth it!”
“Love is not for me. It never will be,” he said after a moment, sliding his feet off of the other chair and sitting up again. Glancing at Peter’s coffee, Loki put on a careful smile. “This was nice. If you get sick of your overly heroic allies, you are welcome to come over here. We’re doing something called minefield tonight, if you’re interested. Oh, and you can bring your boyfriend.”
"Ah. Sure." He gingerly grabbed around Thor's waist and looked up at him again. He felt like he should talk about something else to keep his mind from wandering, but he couldn't think of anything.
“As long as Clint didn’t drink it, yes.”
"Loki. Now is not the time for games. If your curiosity must be satisfied, then ask the Captain when he returns—do not torment my ally."
"Thanks for telling Thor to watch them—Bruce wouldn't leave." She frowned at the scientist.
“I hear there’s a sunken boat out there,” Wade said in the sudden silence. “An old man tried to hide a chest full of jewels, but he got caught and was never heard of again! Behind the waterfall. To the North. Definitely not in the South of the lake! So, bugs, we gotta hike around the lake and go North!”
“I’m saying you changed me, Cap,” he pushed on, not daring glance up at Steve’s expression. Did he understand yet? This could all still be in the realm of friendship—and yeah, they’d had a great friendship, too. It wasn’t what things had turned into, though. Not for Tony, at least. “I used to avoid looking ahead at all. Then, when you started leading the Avengers too, I’d look ahead and I’d see you. ‘Great’, I’d tell myself, ‘the perfect person to take care of it all once I’m gone someday.’ Then I started seeing me right beside you, even way ahead. Us.”
"But I'm not cabbage..."
Was that a joke? It was said pretty seriously, if it was.
"—and the man ate—"
"Um, Tony? Is Miss Potts alright?" He asked, guilty that he had completely forgotten about her. Hopefully, she had gone home to her place and wasn't stuck somewhere in the haunted house that the mansion had become.
It was all just to entertain himself until his actual plan happened, he thought reassuringly to himself as he scrolled the news again.
"If you want to stay, we will," Clint said with renewed determination. There was a sigh in the dark. "Hang in there, buddy." There was a long pause before a loud rumble sounded above them. As the lightning flashed, Bruce could see that Clint was glancing in his direction.
"Jarvis, do y-you know if Tony is on his way back here yet?" Maybe Tony did take a detour. A long one.
“Are we really gonna do this again?” Peter wondered aloud gloomily. “I care about you both. Nothing’s changed, here. I’m just asking you not to completely tank any respect Cap and Tony have left for me—if they have any left at all. They figured out Wade’s Deadpool within minutes of meeting him, Matt. Minutes.”
The storm had gotten way worse. The magical residue had ended abruptly, leading to a dead end near the river. Whoever had left it had worked really hard to cover their tracks.
The archer looked tired with all the small bruises and eye bags. If anyone needed some time off, it was the regular humans in the group.
"He took Captain America instead," the redhead explained, glancing at the blond in concern. "Did he say he was going to talk to me, too?" She definitely sounded worried about that possibility.
"Did I...did anybody get hurt?" He sighed, his shoulders slumping.
"Frightened? At last you realize the gravity of your situation." Clint would have laughed again, but he found his chin abruptly captured in a VERY firm metal grip. Doom turned the blonde's face sideways to look toward him and added ominously, "You do not ask the questions here, DOOM asks them! What do you know of Thor?"
Thor exchanged a look with Loki before reluctantly stepping after Tony and heading for the door.
"You're right," he said apologetically, "I just didn't want to interrupt his chat with that other guy that came off of the train. Everything been okay while I was gone? Need me to get anything from the grocery store on the way home?"
"Well, you certainly can't. Thor's already missing—I'm worried Doom took him. I doubt Doom would come after Miss Potts again, but we can't risk it." He coughed every other word, but was determined to talk anyway. Leaning back against the door, he caught his breath, wheezing.
Bruce glanced back up the steps uneasily.
"I know what Doom did." The Clint in the black tee turned away. "And I don't want to talk about it."
Cap and Tony looked bedraggled, Peter noted with worry. Cap was missing the shirt he’d been wearing over his tank top, and Tony’s hair had a lot more curl to it after the rain washed every last bit of gel out. Neither of them looked miserable, though, and that was a good sign. In fact, they were both smiling.
Recalling his first conversation with Lola and how it was all about wanting to have a summer fling with Thor, Peter blushed.
"Yeah, but he tried to talk to me. He asked why you changed to him." Clint snorted, rubbing the back of his neck. "Then he changed back without a fuss." The blond looked puzzled and then smiled up at Bruce warmly. "I think that was a first."
“He does seem extra worried,” Bruce said thoughtfully, looking down at him. He fidgeted with his hands, focusing on them instead. “Usually nobody worries about me, unless it’s worrying that I’ll turn into Hulk at the wrong time. It’s…strange…to switch back and forth so much again, after letting him drive for so long.”
"Okay..." Bruce side-stepped around so that Clint could see him and reached and swiped sunscreen from both hands onto Clint's arms. "You'd better get your ears and nose, too."
He could see that Matt wasn’t convinced, but the redhead sat back down, gripping his walking stick.
The Hulk somehow managed to skid to a stop without crashing right into him. He did stop VERY close to doing so, though...and folded his big arms over his barrel of a chest, curling his upper lip at the blonde in front of him.
Peter blinked and then crossed his arms.
Thor slipped an arm around Loki's waist to support him, but frowned.
"Then I'll carry you," the Hulk said in a tone that did not invite any arguments. "You struggle, you bleed."
“I’m taking a break,” Clint announced from behind them. When Peter looked, the Avenger was already settling onto a rock.
Oh no.
God, he was still talking?
"That's d-disgusting, Clint."
"Banner says stay awake."
Thor clapped a big hand on his shoulder, nearly knocking him over.
“I think I can put off getting yelled at by Jameson for a few more days,” Peter said immediately, stepping back and grinning. “Lunch and the danger room with you guys sounds like way more fun.”
"We've got a whole bunch of flags for people to pick up, but first somebody has to go out there and set them in place," he continued, trying not to sound like he'd rehearsed this. "Since you guys are the team leaders, I figured maybe you could do it and mark down the locations on the map along the way." He directed both of them with a hopeful look. Cap had completely buckled under the gaze of the sad puppy eyes earlier, but Tony was the more cynical and suspicious of the two, usually.
“Huh? Tied up with a note is what I do with bad guys, Wade!” Peter gestured to Hawkeye. “He’s an Avenger, he’s one of the good guys—AND he’s hurt.” He paused, glancing at Clint nervously and shaking the pill bottle a little. “I don’t know, maybe we should turn back. A treasure hunt can’t be much fun when you’re bleeding everywhere.”
Glancing at Bruce, he couldn’t help thinking about how it might be with him. Hey, they had both never been with a guy and they were alone, Bruce was kinda cute and scruffy…and holy shit, what the hell was he thinking?
"I promise no funny business. Maybe a neck massage—but nothing weird." He shrugged, holding his blanket close.
"We should all get in one place, figure out who's causing the trouble, and deal with them," Bruce said dully. He made it sound so simple...
With a dramatic sigh, Loki flipped his hair back over his shoulder.
"Whoa. Just like that?" The blond grinned, happily going toward his room.
Well, that had come out sounding a little awkward. Technically he WAS always in his room, but...yeah. Bruce prayed the sandwich shop would magically open now and interrupt them.
As the big blond man was heading off, Peter heard a woman clear her throat behind him.
“Well, alright, but you’ll have to stick close so I can hear you.”
Steve didn't move from the chair, his eyes scanning over the room. It made sense for there to be a less theatrical part of the castle. Even Modok and Loki must have had a normal place they lived in. It was hard to imagine someone trying to take over the world, then going home to play the piano.
As the kids squealed happily and raced Peter’s way, he saw the woman raise a hand ominously.
Doom was sitting right there. A super villain. He should be fighting him. All he had to do was wait until Tony got back, though. Steve sighed softly, slipping off into dreamland.
If he stayed this calm for much longer, he might just revert back to Bruce Banner, Spidey thought, blinking. For a normal guy, Hawkeye was pretty darn gutsy to be down there on ground level with the Hulk.
"Hey, uh, pretty night out," he said lamely, with a slightly cringing smile. "Oh, man, that sounds like I'm trying to hit on you!" He shoved his phone into the pocket of his borrowed jeans and then held up both hands. "There's not like a hurricane warning or something, is there? You're packing up like sirens are going off," he observed.
“Wish I didn’t relate to that particular situation so much. Hero types like the Avengers have relationship problems like everybody else. In fact, half the point of this trip was to break the news about Cap and me to the group really gently, one person at a time.” Why was he telling this guy that part? It wasn’t like Matt seemed to care if Tony and Steve liked him, so he wasn’t likely to keep any secrets from Peter for them, either.
If anybody could cure a Doom virus, it would be Banner.
"Yeah," he said glumly, rubbing his neck. "Um, how you doing over there Cap? Any chance of breaking outta here soon?"
Still staring at him, Wade slowly shook his head.
“Hey, don’t you have a few days off? Can I come over? I wanna test out your danger room!”
"...Spider-Man then drove the Hulk through the middle of town—right into the Avengers mansion." Peter could hear the reporter’s voice blaring from Deadpool’s handheld TV. Why he didn’t just use his cell phone, who knew.
"Virgin margaritas are a thing. I doubt he's ever been on an all-expenses-paid vacation before, and it's not like we don't have space for him." He paused, glancing down the beach. Two figures were just getting their feet wet in the ocean foam. The bright pink lettering on Peter's shirt was a pop of color even from this far away. "We should make sure he calls his aunt, though. Don't want to freak her out."
“D loop’s that way,” Tony said pointedly, gesturing for the guy to turn around and go back where he’d come from. He definitely sounded a little more irritated, even compared to how irritated he’d been about Loki before. “Cap, if we don’t hurry Thor’s gonna beat us back to camp, here.”
"The third Hawkeye...isn't real." Clint mumbled, leaning up off of the wall. He wrapped an arm around the other archer's neck and looked at Bruce. "He monologues."
Taking a long step away from Tony, Cap put on a careful smile and pointed across the kitchen.
"It's nothing that's wrong with you. I can't have that kind of relationship with my...condition." He sounded so frustrated and sad about that that Loki was pretty sure he wouldn't be picky about gender if he could be with ANYBODY at this point.
Okay, that felt like an opportunity to say something about how hot Tony was. All Clint had to do was say it. Just start the conversation rolling that way.
Realizing that Peter had spoken to him, Cap came out his thoughts abruptly.
“I thought that it was obvious?” Steve told him, sipping his own soda. “I figured it was a better strategy than more arguing--” Cap cut himself off and shook his head. “We’re doing it again. Look, I don’t want to lie to everyone that we’re together when we’re not. YOU said that earlier and it made sense. You’re right. Happy?”
"Who am I supposed to go to for help? I doubt we want to bring the Hulk over here." She sighed and shook her head, her hair drifting in the wind around her.
Wait.
“It’s not—” Steve began, eyes locked on the tiny card as it spun farther out of his reach. Resting a hand over one of Tony’s on his shoulder, Steve steadied himself. He’d already decided not to tell Tony how he felt. Handing him a letter felt easier, less wounding. As if Tony scoffing at his carefully written words would be easier to endure…
"Deadpool already follows me around everywhere—are people gonna start blaming me for everything he does, too?"
“No way! The night’sh young!” Clint told him, scoffing and hiccuping at the same time. He batted a hand at Cap, then stumbled off down the beach toward where the others were playing frisbee.
"The Hulk isn't showing up, but I'll come watch YOU train if that's less boring. I need to get out of this room—it's starting to feel like prison."
“It really did,” Matt whispered from Peter’s other side, watching Cap lower the kayak into the water with a splash. “Is Thor on standby?”
“Sure, whatever,” Hawkeye grouched, spinning on his heel and storming out of the room. The Hulk followed after him, shaking his head.
Turning in a swish of green cloak, he walked off without another word, leaving them to their own devices.
“I know that I’m not the man to say this, Tony,” Cap sighed, giving up on fixing his hair. “But who are we to tell them who they can be with? I thought homosexuals were normal in this day and age. We were fighting aliens a week ago. I feel like that—”
Distorted by the shimmering reflections on the water, Tony noticed that that little gray cloud had grown bigger like it was trying to spoil the perfect weather.
Loki placed his fingertips against his forehead, sighing deeply.
Peter wanted to linger there and have coffee and muse over how both of these men wore dark scary-looking suits with pointy bits when fighting crime, but the responsible thing to do seemed to go and talk to Thor as quickly as possible. Leaving them to chat, he slipped away down the hall, only to realize he had no idea which room was Thor’s, either.
Deadpool leaned out the window, plucking off his mustache.
Looking around the shore, Steve was surprised that Bruce was no longer there. They’d been so caught up in talking to Thor that he’d somehow slipped by.
“Maybe it’s for the best.” Rubbing his neck, he gave Tony a shrug.
“You can run.” Clint pushed him away.
"No touching," Hawkeye grumbled, separating their hands.
“Uh, who’s asking?” Tony pressed, taking a long sip from his drink.
"We have to watch all of these!"
Any subject change was good. No more sexy sunscreen application.
Taking a big step back from the door, he looked down the hallway back toward the kitchen area and sighed. Well, the goal was to strand the Avengers co-leaders together for awhile, and on that note, mission accomplished. It had to be pretty miserable stuck on a sandbar in this weather, but he tried to be optimistic.
Thor stepped into the elevator and crossed his arms.
Clearing his throat, Cap hoisted the food he was holding up.
"I'm not going to get sick," the blond man was chanting to himself, teeth chattering.
Still lingering near Peter, Clint gave him a glance and whispered down to him.
"It was a bomb," he said after a moment, looking at Clint.
"...What?" Bruce's eyes were half-lidded, still very near sleep again. Abruptly, he realized that he and Clint were huddled as close as they were, the vest draped over them like a private little tent, and the archer's amused blue eyes were looking right into his.
Maybe if Thor put his hair up?
Staring at it for a moment, Cap peeked inside the passenger window to talk to the driver.
"Well, listen, he's safe while he's with us on vacation. We just talk to him this week, get a better idea of what we're dealing with, and go from there," he said. "Or YOU talk to him, because he talked to you so he knows you already know. Pretty sure this is a 'swings both ways' situation--takes one to know one--but if he said gay then gay it is." He groaned. "Swings both...that's the kind of joke he'd make about himself, isn't it?"
Johnny, who had been quietly poking through everything in their kitchen, raised his head at the mention of pizza and gave Peter a thumbs up.
"Aha." He pulled out a small silver case. "I think these are them. I patched Cap up a few times." Offering them to Bruce, he smirked.
Distant blue eyes glanced up at him from where Steve was seated in the sand and the blond man shook his head, taking the root beer bottle.
“You wanna look for that bonfire spot? We can do it while swimming, if you want.”
"Okay!" Hawkeye suddenly came over and moved Bruce aside, half dragging Loki off the couch. "I'll take you to your room."
Hawkeye, who had been quietly confused the whole time, stepped up next to Thor, drawing his bow at the newcomer.
"Is it strange to anybody but me that Wade and Peter act like Matt gets the final word on everything? Don't answer that," he told Cap, sighing. "Look, I trust your judgment..." He hesitated for a moment, wishing he could elaborate on that but knowing, KNOWING that Daredevil was somewhere nearby eavesdropping. "...So I guess those two are sticking around and we're having a boat race. Please tell me there's a pot of coffee waiting for me in the kitchen."
"When I last saw him, he was quite well," Thor assured Steve, leading him over to sit down right where he'd been sitting just a minute ago. Seeing the medical supplies on the table, he glanced at the others worriedly, wondering which of them the items had been used on.
"How much basil?" Tony's voice made him freeze and listen closely. C'mon Logan--err, onion. "Is there a measurement to this, or just...pinch?" Peter took the minced onions and started to mix them with the bread crumbs, trying to pick out any hint of a sniffle from Tony. His voice sounded a little watery, but there was absolutely not one sniffle to be had from him. Maybe it was a matter of pride or something?
“Oh, um, Clint, no,” Bruce stammered, dropping the sandwich aside and gripping his friend’s chin. “Clint, you’re going to choke! Spit it out!”
“Alright. We’ll talk to him. Right now,” Steve paused, taking a deep breath. “We need to think about how to thank Clint for going along with them. That man is a saint.”
Bruce mumbled something about water and retreated from the couch to the kitchen. Thor made it look so easy to be social. It probably WAS easy for him—he didn't have to worry about killing people by accident.
The crazy mutiny plan had actually helped. Mission accomplished.
Bruce mumbled some sort of agreement and slowly sank down to rest his head on Clint's shoulder. Thinking of the peaceful boat on the water had agreed with his sleepless state; he was in danger of dozing off.
“We’ve gotta get him out of there before he causes an incident—Cap and Tony will hate him forever,” Peter muttered under his breath, knowing Matt could hear him just fine. Wade was basically impossible to kill, but Peter didn’t particularly want to see him get hurt, either. Matt’s shades and cane were NOT impossible to destroy, and there was that to worry about too.
"Oh, this can't be good. Well, this is the only recent explosion lately, so wherever Bruce is, he hasn't Hulked out yet." He gestured to the bombed building.
If Bruce got hold of it, the freckled scientist was going to spend all week sitting by the water and ignoring Clint.
It’d be a great excuse for him to spend time with Bruce, but wasn’t that creepy when Bruce didn’t know? Maybe he should just come clean and get rejected now rather than later.
"...Ow," the billionaire mumbled.
"Hey, Hawkeye, are you in there?" Tony's voice came from the other side. Strangely enough, it sounded like he was still speaking through his Iron Man suit.
"Why'd you run, stupid? You're all bloody now."
"Maybe..." He began, and then trailed off, shaking his head. No, bad idea. Thinking tomorrow was best.
Cap knew Thor wasn't sure who exactly it was, but they were armed and making demands, so an enemy was a safe bet.
Thinking back too, Cap just smiled at him, trying not to remember how Tony’s clothes looked when they got wet. The man had a very classy chassis.
“Hey!” Hawkeye yelled, sprint toward them. “Thor, don't! That's Loki!”
"Ah...don't, I-I'm fine. I was out in the weather for hours last night," he explained a bit awkwardly.
“Me?” Clint offered, staring at the ring of green. The whole Hulk thing was tied to Bruce’s pulse. There had definitely been a couple times where Clint had poked, prodded, stabbed or pinched Bruce to get the Hulk out.
Why couldn’t Clint just ignore Bruce? Natasha was hot, and sometimes she even flirted back. That was close enough to a relationship. Kicks, winks and the very occasional kiss. Pft, who needed actual companionship, anyway?
She pressed a small remote she pulled from her suit somewhere. Who knew where, considering how form fitting it was. After pressing a few more buttons, a hole opened under her in the shield.
Following his gaze, Peter flushed.
Thor, he realized rather uncomfortably, hadn't looked away either. The thunder god turned and picked up the blanket from the couch after a moment—then wrapped it around Loki's shoulders and hugged him warmly. No comment, just the hug, and he didn't seem likely to let go any time soon.
"Lots of criminals move around in the dark—I do!" Deadpool grinned, for once his large mouth visible. He noticed that Peter's hotdog had been scraped off. "Hey. You got rid of the good stuff."
"That guy thinks whatever he's doing is the best thing ever," Tony said drolly.
Bruce patted the backpack he wore, suddenly looking very tired.
The injured demigod turned and gingerly lowered himself onto the couch.
"When I have no use for you, I will consider it," Doom declared grandly.
It was just past six when they arrived. There were already a bunch of people milling around in camp, using a fancy espresso machine powered off of a generator.
The Shield agent slid off his chair, shuffling towards the door.
Dropping the towel onto the bed, Cap flipped on his TV on his way to his dresser. That last fight in the sewers had left him smelling awful. It was kind of Thor to give him a chance to go home and shower off the filth.
"Owwww!" The merc groaned childishly. He sat back down into the seat, rubbing his head. "You aren't going to give the city a crawl? Maybe...bug the neighborhood villains?" Wade poked Peter's cheek playfully. "Maybe...maybe," he chuckled into his hand, as if his jokes were actually amusing, "swing by the Bugle?"
The nice brief moment of distraction from his own woes evaporated as Peter swung into sight of the campsite. In the dark it was hard to see, but he was pretty sure there was a gigantic tree laying right across the tent.
“Don’t worry about it,” Clint told him.
So when the masked man promptly demanded, "I will trade them for one Arc reactor," nobody saw it coming.
Watching him as he crossed the room, Loki didn't move, instead putting on one of the scowls he saw Hawkeye use.
"Really. It takes up most of your face."
“Just let me put on some real clothes, and I’ll come along. Unless you think he’ll talk more easily with only one of us there.” There was a thought. Cap was so good at being patient and reasonable and not making snap judgments. On the other hand, Tony was the one with more dating and relationship experience (any, actually), so maybe they had this backward?
Good God above, how was New York going to take the news?
His aunt shook her head a bit, but got into the cab, followed by Peter.
"It probably doesn't need to be this big, though. This's the titanium needle I have to use on Cap since he's too tough for a normal one," he mused.
"I'll live, Captain. Do Tony and the others know where we are?"
"Seriously? The guy's crazy—and I have a girlfriend!"
Taking them with some decidedly sheepish body language, the young hero climbed out of the car in his full crime-fighting costume.
And one stowaway spider.
Sure enough, Cap came into view, gesturing to something and frowning.
Behind Cap, across the lake, the glampers seemed to be waking up. A half dozen people had emerged from the tents, gathering in their fancy chairs. The scent of fresh coffee drifted out over the lake on a gentle breeze, momentarily pulling Tony’s attention away from Steve’s struggle to accept the truth.
Ms. Marvel stopped and hovered beside him.
“Go rent your own, jerk!”
Pretending to turn to leave, Cap spun and drenched Loki with a splash of water.
It was becoming clear that there was no way Loki could slip away unnoticed. All his plans for fun and games and not bleeding fell to pieces.
“Okay, well when my phone has a charge again I’ll text you guys,” he told them. He almost just turned and walked off, but they were standing so perfectly side by side, so lined up for it… Impulsively, Peter stepped closer and hugged them both, one arm around each. “This was really fun—thanks for sticking around.”
"Sort of the second option," Tony said, arching a brow. "Why, is this too leisurely for you? No tech, no work, no idea what to do with yourself?"
Clint looked up at him.
"Don't worry, the sandwich place will open soon," Bruce had begun, replying to the first statement. At the second part, though, he froze. Did he just imagine Clint saying that? Even if he had, his heart was thudding in his chest at the possibility, and he could hear that familiar distant ringing in his ears as all other sounds began to fade away.
Tony yawned, trailing his fingers through the clear lake water. He’d been expecting the water to be chilly, but it was very mild. The pleasant surprise wasn’t having much luck overriding the worries in his head, though. Thor had taken the news of the engagement in stride, and that was nice. He’d been the one Steve and Tony had worried about the least, though.
Hawkeye stood up and grinned at Bruce.
Thor looked at him sadly.
The first one glared at the other.
“To my room—but you gotta keep him quiet,” Clint told him, nodding to Wade.
“Aww,” Clint cooed dramatically, stepping over to pat Bruce’s chin with a hand. “I miss you too, buddy. We’ll find something to do. Don’t worry.”
"I'm surprised you didn't find me out."
Tony shrugged a little, looking at the kayak dubiously.
“…I can hear your heartbeat.”
“…I guess we should have told you,” he said slowly, shoulders slumping. “Wade and I, well.” Matt chewed his lip, frowning harder. “We sort of…broke up last week. We’re okay dating you—just not each other. You know. We’re so different and Wade’s such a…” Swallowing whatever he had been about to say, Matt pulled on a half-assed smile. “We’re still friends, though.”
“Cap’s worrying has been in overdrive lately. I think he’s finally done putting up with my crap. I mean jeez, who cares if I eat breakfast!”
Tony restrained himself from rolling his eyes again. Bruce was eternally tired, and had already been silently sleeping in the back seat when Tony had arrived. If he didn't get into the car on his own, who had moved him? Hawkeye, probably?
is a good thing to check out.
“Alright, jeez,” Clint said tiredly, crossing his arms. “We’re kinda in the middle of something, so…” He looked pointedly at Peter.
So, he DID think Tony took too long doing that. Ouch. He looked at Steve and lowered his glass, growing very serious.
"And what is that?" Loki asked sweetly, leaning in closer. He wasn't bothered by the electricity—at least, not that he would let Doom see. It made him flinch inwardly, instantly bringing up lots of memories of being zapped by Thor.
"Like I said, I don't want Thor to tag along." He slid an arm over Bruce's shoulders to better guide him. "And it's easier to blend in without a demigod following us around."
"Jarvis, put the suit away. I've got science to do."
“Have a nice day,” Cap told her, though there was no hint of sincerity in his voice. As soon as Lola sauntered off, Cap turned back to Peter with his arms still crossed. He didn’t say anything, just gave a very suspicious look.
"His brother? The Jotun known as Loki?"
“Actions?” Clint asked drolly, crossing his arms and leaning on the door frame. “We’re playing cards.”
Popping a couple pain pills, Clint tossed the bottle back to Peter. After a very long drink of water, he shook his head at them.
“I was actually here just to camp with my boyfriend,” he admitted, deciding to be honest with Loki. “I didn’t realize the Avengers were right down the hill from us, though, and our campsite kind of ended up getting Hulk-smashed, so we’re tentless.” He glanced around the very expensive-looking camp with its army of beautiful cabin tents and smiled sheepishly. “Your camp’s really nice, by the way. Thanks for inviting me in even though I just sort of…dropped by.”
"If you both claim to be the real Hawkeye, how can you dislike the other? You are like twin brothers," Thor reasoned, gesturing to the Clint with the blanket around his shoulders. "But you are not children—share with one another."
"Something bad happened here."
Pepper sighed.
“Hey Peter,” Cap called to him, slowing the kayak’s arrival with a paddle. They came in fast enough that Tony bounced in his seat. Cap stepped out into the water, pushing the boat up a bit. “Sorry we took so long.”
“Is anybody actually listening—” Peter began, but was cut off to Thor.
“Let me get that,” Cap said, kneeling and beginning to start a fire. “I know bears wouldn’t bother the Hulk, but I still don’t want Bruce to have to go through getting bitten or clawed.”
"Yep," Tony said unenthusiastically.
Wow, gloomy, Peter thought, sighing and getting out of bed. He flipped the light switch. Nothing changed, though—the power must have been out.
There came a sigh and the rattle of chains from the other cell.
"Sure, leave it to me."
"Oh don't worry, I can take it!" Peter grinned, heading for Wade's side of the trampled sand area they'd been using for frisbee games. "Hey Wade, how's it going?"
Cringing, from both pain and the fact that he had failed to sneak past, Loki turned back to look at him.
“Tony,” Cap said softly, sitting his root beer bottle aside. “Honest to god, Tony, I thought the same thing—”
She crossed her arms.
The X-man came over, smirking eerily to himself and petting the bike's seat affectionately.
Thor, meanwhile, was eating popcorn and looking disturbed about the whole subject matter (but unable to look away, Bruce noted.)
“I’ll throw you off this cliff,” Clint growled back.
“Yeah, that’s kinda hot.”
"Soo..." Clint began, hand still firmly on Bruce's shoulder. "Do you think Thor's up there or is that just regular old thunder?"
"—With Thor," Hawkeye chimed in. He pulled out his card, but it was knocked from his hand by Loki.
"Lead the way." Bruce gestured for Clint to step past him and down the sidewalk.
“Mission…Stoggers?” Peter asked, trying desperately not to sound strange. He still had to explain, maybe if Matt had all of the info… He did his very best not to consider Matt’s apology an actual rejection. Wade sure looked happy.
"Then let me go, Bruce." The blond sat up as much as he could, closing the distance between them. He tilted his head up at the brunette, eyes tired but still sharp. "You know I'm me. Please."
Feeling unsettled, Tony turned and reached over to grab Steve’s hand. This whole incident had really seemed to leave Cap sad and silent.
“Eh,” was the only response from Clint as he took the gauze. Pressing it into the messy cut, he nodded to Peter. “Just tie something around it.”
“Unimportant since there’s no possibility one of us wasn’t a consenting adult when we got together,” Tony countered, sitting up. Good God, they must be bad at hiding this if the blind guy had already picked up on it, but that wasn’t as important as the actual point of this conversation. “So how about it? How does an adult with a professional job like you wind up having a ‘things went from there’ date with a seventeen-year-old kid still in high school?”
Tony only half-heard him, the gears still turning in his head. Oh, no. What if MATT was the guy Peter liked and couldn't tell? The guy had followed Wade all the way here from New York, and had known Peter was here too...
Noting that the newly arrived Iron Man hand wasn’t a threat, Loki looked back to Thor. He leaned against his shoulder to whisper to him.
"Oh, him," Tony said nonchalantly, sipping the coffee again. He went still for a long minute and then sat up, frowning. "Waitwaitwait, PETER Peter? Peter Parker Peter?"
"I stabbed myself," Hawkeye admitted guiltily, like a child confessing to stealing a cookie.
“Look, I guess I better just come out and say it,” he said as bravely as he could. Ah, who the hell was he kidding? “I-I kinda like—”
"Hey, we should check on Cap on the way," he suggested, tucking the card away.
"Ah! Put me down!" The demigod struggled briefly, giving up at the sudden stabbing pain in his side. He sighed. "I need to sleep this off."
Pepper! Doom had kidnapped Pepper?
“Nice try, but—” Wait. Was it September already? It was. He and Steve had been so caught up in first secretly dating then secretly being engaged that they had somehow completely forgotten about it. Apparently Peter had, too, or the air of angst would have been impossible to miss…
Steve leaned to watch the ripples, frowning. Was Thor trying to catch Loki’s attention?
“Camping,” Clint said, his tone silently implying the childish ‘DUH.’
Hawkeye looked frantically through his arrowheads. How was it that Amora had the emergency Hulk stuff? He was pretty sure that it was uniquely his—but who knew. The other two had stolen everything else about him, why not his arrows?
“Alright, let me clear that up then—it’s none of your damn business.” No, technically, they weren’t together. So he had nothing to hide. Team leader or not, Cap wasn’t allowed to tell him who he could or couldn’t date, though.
Beside him on the adjacent medical bed, Loki looked at Thor, now that the giant rage monster was gone.
Tony looked up, nonplussed, as the God of Thunder flew off into the blue sky with Loki’s dark curls trailing out behind them.
The rain pounded musically onto the roof of the cabin, mingling with the occasional swooshing gust of wind. With the heavy clouds outside, it was practically pitch black inside. The air felt thick and muggy, humid from the thunderstorm. Swiping wet hair out of his face, Peter laughed sheepishly.
Wade reached for him from the shallows, clinging to a rock.
Somewhere, a clock began to ding. Three times, four times…
"He stabbed me!" Clint growled, pointing accusingly at his double, who was dressed in his Hawkeye outfit.
Spider-Man tossed Ms. Marvel a little salute and hopped off the side of the building.
Slowing down to make sure Matt safely followed the curve of the trail, Steve frowned and looked at the blind man.
"Pepper said something like that, too," Tony said worriedly. "...I better get back to Steve now. C'mon, you won't be in a dungeon, you'll be in a comfortable room. I'm not some tyrant dictator or something." He waved for them to follow and headed for the elevator.
"It seems Thor did not care to aid his friends," Doom commented drolly, placing the tray on the table and selecting from the beakers of colorful green and yellow liquids there.
Steve frowned at him.
"Uhh. No. No, we are not a couple, Thor." The trickster carefully readjusted his intonation as he noticed that he was starting to sound like himself.
"The one consistent thing between all of you is that you don't get along," Bruce replied, sighing. "They could attack you—one already did. You're real enough to me..."
That might be for the best if Cap kept thinking of Tony all the time.
Bruce definitely kept glancing around at the people as they walked, sticking close to Clint's side. He had a carefully neutral look on his face, and seemed to regret leaving his hoodie behind in the cabin. When they reached the water, he practically charged into the waves like he was escaping dry land.
Bruce led the two blonds to the medical room and helped Loki sit down on the nearest chair. Then he promptly turned and grabbed the medical tools he needed from the tables.
Now what was he supposed to do? Bruce actually seemed like he wanted to spend time with him. The scientist had even made it sound like he might skip fishing and hang with Clint by choice. That was nice.
Clint leaned back against the wall, crossing his arms.
"Yes. There are three of you now."
“Why would Matt lie to me about that part?” Tony sounded almost hopeful he had been lying, though. Wade just seemed like a real oddball during their campout, but the name Deadpool held all sorts of other darker connections. “I asked him directly, Cap. He confirmed Peter’s with Wade, and he used the word ‘dating’ about him and Peter, too. I’m not sure about Matt and Wade being with each other, but Peter seems to be their common ground.”
The Hulk glanced back, then scowled.
“Good morning, Mr. Stark. Mr. Rogers.”
"This doesn't look good," Cap wheezed, punching a hand through the cage to reach for the driver. The taxi swerved as the driver realized Cap's hand actually had gone through the metal cage. The side of the cab scraped against the tunnel wall with a deafening squeal while they continued to careen downhill. Cap grabbed the man's arm and wrenched him to the right, turning the wheel with him.
"Finally, some super heroes thought they had him," Peter valiantly narrated on. "They used someone as bait--a mutant who would heal from any injury, so they'd just keep growing a new skin every time the thief took theirs!"
"Oh yeah? I guess he probably wouldn't admit it if he did, but I've never even SEEN him on a date," he confessed. "So maybe he's on this vacation to get away from things, huh?"
"Maybe we missed him.”
“You saw Wade?” Peter sat up.
Out of the corner of his eye, Steve saw Bruce duck in and quickly rearrange about half of the campfire’s shape before Clint got back with the last rocks for the fire ring. Now the wood was in more of a point, leaving air for the fire to breathe—probably far more likely to actually work.
"Hello..."
“Is Wade Deadpool?” Tony asked, ignoring the halfhearted attempt at small talk. Gulp.
Lightning flashed outside. The storm still hadn't gone away yet.
"You!" Wolverine snarled at Deadpool.
"No," Loki said slowly. "I just think there are more important things around here than me. Like curing Cap before Tony's heart melts out of his chest. Or hunting down the evil me that jabbed me in the stitches." He frowned at the last one.
The archer was shaking, himself. He had been in cold, wet clothing for way too long. Hopefully he could find Bruce before either of them died. Something caught his eye in the forest and he waved to Thor.
“Well, I’m grateful that you’re all alright. We ran into Loki early this morning and tried to get everyone back to camp, but we couldn’t get through to you.”
"One of you WILL tell me what I want to know."
Thor glanced over at them and gave a little grin.
"Bleh!" The mutant (mutate, actually) groaned, spitting mud out of his mask. "Hulk sandwiches?!" He jumped to his feet. Obviously the fall didn't hurt him. "See you later, baby bug—I got some sandwiches to eat!" With that he took a single step and landed face first back into the mud and leaves that had washed up at the bottom of the roof drain.
When the day had come when the Avengers had to pile into an SUV and try to RELAX, Steve Rogers was struggling with the idea. Tony heard the big blond man plead one more time for the Fantastic Four to call them for any reason before the man finally put the phone down.
Popping the top off on the edge of the counter, he toasted Steve with it.
“Exactly. He told me that his friend Thor wouldn’t mind me joining the game, so I did. It’s as simple as that. And, since Thor is not here, I’ll leave you three to your family time.”
"Yeah! He had to be the hero." The shirtless blond sighed, rolling his eyes. “Not really a surprise, you know, since it’s Cap.”
"Over here," the scientist sighed, stepping out of the bushes and half-leaning on the nearest tree. He looked all scratched up, like maybe he'd gone back to himself mid-leap and flung a ways, and was soaked to the skin. Of course, since he wasn't wearing anything else, he had little choice in the matter.
"Hawkeye, give me your c-card." Cap sipped the water.
“You’d rather sit out there in all of that than talk to me?” The words would have been hard to hear over the storm if not for Cap’s excellent hearing. Tony sounded snarky in an over-the-top way that seemed a little forced. “Seriously?”
"Hey, the cards aren't working, but the shield's still up! We tried waving Carol down, but she's not around." Clint was talking fast, dropping the soaking wet captain onto the couch beside Loki. "I'm going back out there!" Without waiting, he spun back around and headed for the door. The agent was shaking again like he had been yesterday, but didn't seem to care if he got sick. The fool.
