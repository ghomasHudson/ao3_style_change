Peter quickly got up to try to close the window, but it was stuck. Ben soon came to his aid and with their combined strength they managed to close it. Peter kneel down on the ground and started picking up all of the pictures as fast as he could. With Ben quickly joining him.
Johnny responded with a sigh.
"I'm sorry, Peter, your dad got stuck in a meeting but he will greet you later tonight".
Ben rolled his eyes at him. He looked at the board and notice something crucial.
"Wait, what?!".
"How is that not bragging? "
"Not sure, I'll keep you posted". He said with a shrug as he took a bite of his burger.
"The fact that you didn't grab your bag before it was thrown into this mess" The mystery boy then gestured to the ever-growing pile
"Okay, everything's okay you know everything you need to know, he's your pops, he's going to like you no matter what...he likes you...you can do this."
Johnny pointed out, he was spread out on his top bunk with his lower body on the bed and his top half hanging from it.
"Sleepover?"
After a long discussion, whether they should inform a counselor about this or not and a series of pulley systems they finally managed to get everything down from the roof and into the cabin.
Steve's blue eyes fell fondly on their tangled hands
Peter replied with a laugh.
Ben only shrugged.
" You're adopted? That's not that weird."
"Favorite? he's your only godson"
right away he could tell this wasn't going to be like the other matches, sure a lot of kids came in and tried to beat him with the attack-to-kill technique, but this kid was fast, and it looked like he knew what he was doing. Peter was spending all his energy deflecting all the blows he was receiving. Waiting for an opportunity to show itself so he could deflect, but he ended up walking backward, up the stairs, still trying to dodge every attack. He ended up falling when he took a misstep and thought there was an extra step, and that's when the mystery boy poked him on the chest, earning him a point and a cheer from the audience. Peter quickly got up and noticed that the boy had not yet climbed the stairs, he took the higher ground to launch his sword straight into the boy's chest earning him a point and cheers of his own. He and the mystery boy were tied, and whoever got the next point would win the match, which made things more intense, the other boy quickly made his way up the stairs, as they continued fencing on the outside of the cabin, Peter noticed that this guy was leading him into a dead end, he tried thinking quick, the hall was too narrow so he couldn't go around him or he would lose immediately. He looked up and saw the wooden ledge and somehow convinced himself to jump on it. He was very proud of himself for being able to pull that off, sure he wasn't the stereotypical wimpy nerd (he was close but not quite) but he wasn't that athletic type either, he liked rock climbing with his dad, and he was in the junior gymnastic team, something he got teased for a lot but he didn't care he loved it. And he love the feeling of being up on the edge, he could hear some of the kids gasping and cheering him on while the counselor was screaming out"Okay!" as they tried to make their way through to the crowd of excited children, to make sure Peter and this boy didn't hurt themselves. Unfortunately, his moment and his victory was short-lived, because his opponent took advantage that Peter was distracted by trying to think of his next move, and poked his stomach with the thin sword, The poke made him lose his balance, and Pete ended up falling off the ledge, but luckily or unlucky for him, he didn't hit the ground, he hit the water. Right below where he had been standing there was a large wooden sink that was filled with water.
Steve wasn't sure how long he simply lay there, trying to rally enough strength to move without blacking out again. He knew it was imperative that he move soon, or his body would eventually begin to heal itself around the intrusion. It had happened before with bullets, and he'd been forced to undergo surgery to reopen the wound and remove the offending piece of metal. It didn't help that his post-serum metabolism rejected any form of sedation.
Steve wasn't sure when his body betrayed him, but at some point his eyes had closed. Confusion, hurt, and worry plagued his mind as he slipped soundlessly back into darkness.
Steve felt slightly sick. He resolved to send Clint a check for the damage he'd done to the car. He didn't remember much of what had happened last night (if it had really only been one day) but he did remember being soaked in his own blood, almost drowning in it.
Something must have alerted the other man to Steve's whereabouts this time, because he knew he wasn't on his own cell. "Where's your phone?"
An involuntary moan rumbled up out of Steve's chest, and the metal-clad hand on his neck tightened painfully. He tried to push away, planting his fists on the immovable chest in front of him, but whatever was in control of his boyfriend's mind would have none of it. Soon, Steve wasn't going to be able to breathe, and his mind cleared enough to let him know that was a problem.
The words were so calm and final, like it was the only possible solution.
"Steve?"
He didn't want to think about how he'd screamed, how he'd sobbed like a child through treatments and surgeries and endless needles, catheters and blood-soaked bandages changed twice a day by nurses he didn't recognize.  He didn't want to remember.
If it hadn’t been abundantly clear before, he knew now for sure: he didn’t have the strength to say no to Tony. He could add that to the long list of things he no longer had the strength for.
"Nothing, Tony. Don't be so defensive."
Steve adjusted the borrowed jacket around his abdomen, paranoid that Tony would be able to see through fabric and leather to the marks hiding beneath, and practiced his casual smile.
They'd traded blows; bone-crushing, no-holds-barred hits landing left and right as they danced around the chaos that was the two assassins and the black ops team locked in battle around them, turning the small space into a warzone.
Tony answered by swiping another glass off the countertop, this one empty, and chucking it straight at Steve.
He caught inchoerent snatches of light and sound as he was half-carried, half-dragged out to the deceptively plain-looking SUV that was the assassin's current form of transportation and deposited gently into the front seat.
"Well, I can't help it." Tony took a long swing of his juice, emptying the bottle. "You're creepin' me out, doc."
In so many ways, Steve was always gone.
"What he said." Bruce nodded his head towards Hawkeye, raising one arm to wipe his forehead with the back of his wrist. His hands were covered in blood. "Wasn't looking so good there for a bit, Cap."
The first swing of the crutches sent blood pumping back through stiff muscles, and Steve bit his lip hard at the sensation.  By the time he reached the door, he felt a little short of breath and paused to catch his bearings. He found himself gripping his crutches hard, channeling pain and frustration through the unfeeling metal.
Tony grins.
"Oh, come on, guys, did you
But here, now, he doesn't feel like a leader. He feels like a man that is in love and finally knows the man he loves better than he'd ever thought possible. This is a Tony that's putting himself out on the line, lying down on the wire if that's what it takes to make Steve feel safe. If that's what it takes to let Steve make the last leap. Steve sees the desperate whisper that Tony's trying to make him understand, and, for the first time, Steve thinks he might be brave enough to take that leap with him.
at him.
Steve manages not to choke on his tongue at that, but it's a very near thing. "Colonel—"
They finish their drinks with their hands wrapped firmly around their mugs, pointedly not speaking as they take their time. Eventually Steve can't avoid this any longer and he gets to his feet, ready to head back to his floor. Natasha surges to her feet beside him, hands coming up as though to sign something to him only to stop short before they can form anything more than the beginning of his callsign. Steve smiles, small and bleak and tries not to let her hesitation get to him. Her face tightens and she starts signing, confidence and poise restored.
Steve nods and looks away before Tony can read more into his expression than Steve wants him to. He gets to his feet and steps out of the control room, not letting himself look back. He knows Tony must be signing at him, knows JARVIS would be calling after him if he could hear, but if Tony really wants to keep him here, all he has to do is have JARVIS close and lock the door in front of him, and as that doesn't seem to be happening, Steve lets himself walk on through. They can worry about the rest later. Right now, Steve just needs some time to think.
Steve forces a smile.
"He's saying something about a party he threw at MIT, Rhodes, says it was better than any party you ever could have—"
Something pulls in Steve's stomach at the possessive, but he pushes it down, too busy focusing on the way Tony smiles and moves, the parts of him that he's come to know so well over these past few weeks. He reaches out without thinking, wrapping a hand around Tony's waist and pulling him in close.
Tony's grin goes radiant and Steve can't help but return the expression in kind.
Tony inhales sharply, leaning in to kiss Steve again. When he pulls back, he closes his eyes and leans his forehead against Steve's. "Steve, I…"
Steve stiffens in response. "Your what, Tony?"
Tony's eyes go wide. He reaches out a hand toward Steve's sketchbook, pulling it back a moment later.
Tony raps Steve sharply on the head before his thoughts can spiral too much deeper.
Steve turns Tony in his arms, leaning in to kiss him soundly. "I do, Tony. So much more than I can say. I want to be yours. And I want you to be mine."
have to make this the first thing I see after almost a month without being able to see a damn thing?"
Steve fills half a sketchbook with Tony over the next three days, the drawings interspersed with his pointed scribblings at the surprisingly few members of their team that don't speak ASL. Clint and Nat are both fluent, correcting Steve and Tony when they make a social faux pas in their rudimentary understanding of the language. Fury seems to know just enough to be dangerous, better at understanding than at signing himself. Steve catches both Tony and Clint throwing glares at the director when he barks at them for something they've signed at one another. Steve just chuckles when that happens, earning him glares from all three of them.
"It's not a big deal." Tony leans back, grinning up at him. "I have a feeling we're going to want that footage in a few years."
"I love you too."
"Tony—"
Steve smiles, pulling Tony in close and burying his face in Tony's neck. "Well alright then."
Tony doesn't answer with words. He just pulls Steve in close. That speaks louder than words ever could, and, frankly, Steve can't find it in himself to mind.
Steve sees the words Tony isn't speaking in the lines of his face. Has Tony's face always been this expressive? Steve can't honestly say. For all that he's spent hours watching Tony and learning his every move, he's also been drawn in by Tony's flashy words. Anything to draw attention away from who Tony really is. Who he is down to his core. Steve's fallen into those traps before, letting Tony throw him off the scent of an injury or weakness until Steve catches on to what he'd done. Usually it's too late to do anything to help, and it rankles, but Steve's been putting on a brave face for his team since before his current teammates were born. He knows his role, his purpose, and he'll fulfill it to the best of his ability.
Steve nods, but doesn't expect anything to come from it. Things so rarely do.
"Never mind. Forget I said anything."
When Steve looks up again to find Tony, he's sitting on the table in front of Steve, staring down at the contents of his sketchbook. The moment his hands still, Tony looks up at him, looking caught out. He lifts his hands and signs a quick
Now, watching the easy way Tony uses his hands to communicate his thoughts where his lips will no longer suffice, Steve finds himself fascinated anew. The flex of his wrist as he signs is different than the flex when he's reaching deep inside a car engine. The arch of his fingers as he flips Clint off mid-sign is different than the way they curl around a screwdriver in the lab. There's something deeper, different, foreign and strange about watching the way that Tony moves through the world without his voice. Steve isn't sure if he hates it or loves it. Hates the way Tony occasionally pauses mid-sign as though to find a missing word. Loves the adorable look of confusion on his face when that happens. Hates the way the team sometimes ignores him without the sound of his voice to make him heard. Loves the way Tony turns to him in those moments, exasperated and looking for companionship that Steve always offers. There's so much Steve can suddenly see in every expression on Tony's face that he never noticed before. New expressions to categorize and understand the way he's never had to before. He's always had Tony's voice to balance out any question of his features; without that Steve finds himself noticing minute shifts in Tony's face that he's never had to notice before. More than once Steve has to hold himself back from reaching out to smooth away a wrinkle in Tony's forehead, desperate to see one of the small, genuinely happy smiles that so rarely grace his features. Each one feels like a blessing, and Steve just wants to see it all the time.
Rhodes makes eye contact with him once more, a pointed reminder of the words he'd said earlier, before he glances over at Nat and tosses a wave in her direction. "Try to make sure these two knuckleheads stay out of trouble, hmm?"
He reaches for his sketchbook, opening it up to a blank page. He spends the better part of two hours sketching DUM-E and the other robots, trying not to let his attention stray to Tony too often. He does glance over plenty, though, unable to keep his eyes away for too long. Eventually sharp angles turn to gentler arcs, sharp lines to smoother curves, DUM-E to Tony in all his glory. It's not that it's never happened before, it's that this is the first time it's felt this inexorable, this impossible to resist. Tony's been everything for so long, it's just never felt this obvious before.
Rhodes waves him off. "Just don't make him cry and we'll be fine, Rogers." Tony squawks, but before he can pull away, Rhodes tightens his hold on Tony's shoulders. "You got that?"
Tony flushes at the sign Steve throws back at him.
Nat's eyes go wide, and Steve knows she knows. He's already on his feet, turning toward Tony when she whispers, "Steve?"
Natasha tilts her head, a thoughtful look on her face.
Steve lies.
Steve rolls his eyes, knowing that this is just Tony downplaying his genius the way he does when he's done something that really is for himself. He crosses the room, tapping Rhodes on the shoulder to make it clear that he and Tony aren't alone anymore. Rhodes tilts his head up toward him, looking somewhere to Steve's left. He sees Rhodes' lips shape his name. "Yeah," he says, trying to keep his voice low.
Steve shakes his head.
Tony grins, though Steve can see from the look in his eyes that, if he had his voice, he'd be laughing his ass off. Steve just smiles back at him, chest warm with the kind of affection that Tony always brings about in him.
Steve leans in, kissing the corner of Tony's mouth. "I'm yours, huh?"
Tony tilts his head to the side. Steve feels like he can see the play of every last emotion on his face, calm and clear and perfect in a way that Steve's never been able to parse before all of this. Even if he never gets his hearing back, at least he'll have this.
There's no ringing in Steve's ears when he comes around. He shakes his head and winces at the way it rattles his brain in his skull. There's pain there, an ache under his skin that has him worried for his companions. He gets to his feet, unaware that anything is wrong until he starts shouting for Tony and Rhodes to get back in the air. The second Tony's field name slips past his lips, he knows something's wrong. He reaches for his throat. His heart is beating a sharp rhythm in his jugular as his strategist's brain works overtime. He calls out for Nat who turns to look at him. It confirms the suspicion in his chest. He closes his eyes for the briefest of moments before shaking his head at her. Her eyes go wide with understanding and she turns away. He can see her hand come up to her ear and can imagine her shouting into the coms, taking charge immediately. As she does, Steve turns to his own set of problems.
He's too late.
she signs once he's taken the mug from her.
Tony drags Rhodes off to his workshop as soon as they make it back to the Tower. Steve doesn't begrudge him that, but he does get antsy within the first few twenty minutes of being back at the Tower in his own room. When the nerves and silence get to be too much, he grabs his sketchbook and heads down to Tony's lab. Tony turns to him as soon as he starts to punch in his code. Tony's face flickers with something like concern, but he waves off Steve's answering concern. He signs rapidly into the air between them, too fast for Steve to catch, but he sees the way Rhodes tilts his head to the side as though listening to something.
Clint stops pacing and whips his head around to face Steve. Bruce and Doctor Cho both turn to him as well, and Steve can tell that they think he was laughing at something one of them said rather than at a particularly funny thought. He waves them off. He sees Bruce's lips move, but he still can't hear anything. He thinks he can make out a few of the words, but nothing that's enough to be able to respond. Bruce sighs and turns to grab something off the table beside him. He scribbles a few words on Doctor Cho's pad and hands it to Steve.
"You're damn right you do."
Steve turns away and heads over to the couch in the corner that has long since been dubbed as his. He flips his sketchbook open and turns to a blank page. He glances up at Tony and Rhodes, letting his pencil start to sketch the easy arc of Tony's hands and the attentiveness in the way Rhodes watches him. Steve wouldn't be surprised if Rhodes has half a dozen signs learned before this whole ordeal is over. There's fluency and ease in the way Tony signs, but Steve doesn't let himself look too closely at the signs themselves. That's a conversation for the two of them, and Steve won't intrude on it.
"Steve?" Tony's voice is hoarse from disuse, but Steve doesn't give a damn. It's the most beautiful thing he's heard in weeks. He looks up at Tony, heart in his throat as he tries to find the words.
Tony reaches out again, but not for the sketchbook this time. He slides his fingers under Steve's chin, turning him toward Tony and tipping his chin up. He pulls away only to sign at him.
Fifteen crumpled up sketches later, Steve decides that he might have left the room a bit too soon. He's missed the debrief by now, no doubt, and at this point all that would be left would be everyone's mission reports. He leaves his floor and makes his way to Natasha's. He raps on the door to her apartment and she opens it with a curious expression.
Natasha pulls away, her eyes wide and worried.
Natasha goes on staring into his eyes, as though looking for other unknown secrets that he might be keeping from her. Then she settles back into her chair.
He becomes so engrossed, committing the movements to memory, that he misses it when everyone starts to file out of the exam room. Tony catches him by the elbow, tugging just enough to get Steve's attention. Steve looks up at him. Tony's got an amused grin on his face, and when he pulls his hand away, he signs a quick
It's not that Steve's never noticed Tony's hands before. He has. Covered in oil or dirt or blood, Steve's spent hours watching the way Tony's hands work. Tony's always been handy, and Steve knows that better than most. He's spent days down in Tony's lab watching him work on the suits and the team's gear. He's learned more about car maintenance and the best way to solder together Nat's Widow Bites and the tension and flexion Tony puts into Clint's arrows than he ever needed to know. Steve knows the bend and flex of Tony's wrist and the delicate, powerful arch of his fingers.  Steve knows Tony as intimately as he is allowed, and that has always had to be enough.
Tony's eyes are glassy. "Yeah?"
The place is almost as sparse as his, but in a less military way. There's something here that speaks to years of privacy and caution. It tightens something in his chest, weighing him down as though to pull him under; Natasha's made a life that works for her despite all the pain and trauma she's faced, and Steve… here Steve is worrying about his place in his team-slash-family. He settles down on the couch in her living room, thighs spread and hands clasped between his knees. He can't hear Natasha moving around in the kitchen behind him but he can imagine that's what she's doing. He wets his lips, parting them as though to speak. He stops short, though, when it occurs to him that he'll have to wait for her to come over to the living room before he'll be able to see her response. So he waits.
Tony was slumped against the bed when Steve came back fully to himself, small whimpers escaping him at every moment Steve made. Steve navigated them to one side of Tony’s large bed, spooning up behind him, happily feeling a drop of come slide down from Tony’s ass, just further proof of how thoroughly he marked him.
friend excites him.
Steve watched avidly, fucking Tony through the last pulses of his come and then let go of the heat that had been building inside him, flicking pleasure through his body like trails of flames. His hips stuttered and then stilled as he shuddered through his orgasm, coming inside Tony with a deep growl that faded into a satisfied sigh.
It’s too late for them and Steve knew this already but god, it hurts to have Tony say it to him, no matter how soft and full of pain it is.
Steve shrugged, unconcerned about the red smear decorating Tony’s gray shirt. “I wanted to see how everything went,” he said casually. “Any hecklers?”
Tony was not an insubstantial person, but when compared to Steve? He was small, and Steve loved it. He loved caging Tony in with his body, pushing him down into the bed and rutting into him until he came forcefully. He loved that he could pick Tony up and then throw him onto the bed, over and around him in an instant, ready to express the overwhelming desire that only grew as he watched Tony crawl towards him on the bed, ready to be taken just like Steve wanted.
Natasha gives him a knowing look as he throws on the leather jacket and he refuses to blush.
“You fucking slut,” Steve rasped, “you’re so tight for someone who likes getting fucked like this. You stay nice and tight for me, baby?”
They talk. Finally.
He meets Carol and he’s weary. Steve is there and all he can think is
Tony’s happy and Steve can’t even bring forth the resentment he feels he should have after he sees the soft, loving look Tony gives his daughter. Tony’s retired, he’s done, and Steve has no right to drag him back into the fray when he has so much to lose.
Pepper said looking straight at Tony who had been telling Ben cheat codes for the game through the whole match.
"He knows what he did."
"I don't regret it, but it's just... Well, like you said crazy"
"Yeah, like maybe we could build a pillow fort in the living room and watch some movies, you know could be fun."
"That one? I was actually thinking about our camping trip from last year"
Ben was anxiously waiting for Happy to pick him up, he was playing with his hands, trying to remain calm.
"Come on", his pops cave in and closed the door to the apartment. They walked down the stairs and out of the building, as they approached the park Peter decided to pick up the conversation of the other night
" Thanks".
" it's just really frustrating not knowing anything"
"...Right, I'll go check that out, um spiderling, why don't you go upstairs, unpack and get some rest?"
Ben asked as he grabbed one of the potato chip bags and put it in the middle of them.
Peter said as he grabbed Ben by the shoulders again.
"Also, when my dad goes down to the lab, go with him, he won't ask you to accompany him, but I always do, and we both love it. If you don't, he's going to think you're mad, but trust me is super cool, because he normally ditches his work and does cool experiments with me, also just because he looks like he's not paying attention to you he absolutely is, so be careful what you say when you think he's distracted, and last but definitely, not least there is uncle Rhodey, doesn't live with us or anything, but he visits us as much as he can, always shows up for my birthday, and he's known my dad since college, so he might also know something. So if he shows up, feel free to ask him, if you can't get anything out of my dad, also, Happy and I are forever stuck in a war of snarky comebacks, so don't make me look bad.
He didn't want to think about that, he didn't want to hate his pops or his dad, he wanted to enjoy their time together not resent it, plus he had a mission he decided to push back the tears and ignore all those feelings.
"It will be when you bump into a wall, due to how filthy those glasses are".
"Are you going to be okay without it?"
"You evil little genius" Happy shot him a warm smile
Maybe he should have listened to Ben about the time difference.
What was happening with Ben?
"Um...Pete, that ain't happening. "
"Remember that black car we saw when we first arrived?"
"Yeah, we became really close you could say we're basically Brothers"
He kneeled down and said in a low voice
Peter saw how his pops face lit up."Really? that's perfect, I'm on my way to the old one right now"
"I never asked, what house are you in?"
The three boys were watching everything unfold from a window that was located in the back of the cabin.
That made Ben laughed and it also served to make the atmosphere much less awkward.
"More like freezing, and don't worry about it, you know what, maybe I should tell one of the staff
"Nothing," they both said at the same time with knowing smiles.
"Well when you have a spot open in your schedule, let me know, and we can discuss your plans for next summer, Mr.Stark"
Happy started closing the divider but saw Peter's puppy dog face in the mirror, he looked away because even knowing it was fake he was a sucker for that face.
Steve added.
"You really did miss them, huh? and yes, one where hopefully, I don't feel like a paint cover sardine "
The blond once again beamed with joy, as he grabbed Luke by his hoodie.
Peter playfully pushed him.
"This was the first I time saw him."
"Alright, I'll be able to get you lenses tomorrow so lay low until then".
Years later, and I still regret not making this an omegaverse, it would have saved so much trouble, but it's too late for that.
"Get a good look at it, Benny, because this might be one of the last times you see our little studio"
it was now Ben's turn to look at Peter in shock, before running over to the wooden trunk and getting out an old book. He flipped through the pages until he found the picture of his dad.
"Hold on!"
"Maybe you do".
"I don't know what you're talking about, this is all you,"
"To be honest kiddo I much rather hear about camp."
"Are you truly capable of going five seconds without listening to yourself talk? look I'm not saying that... well of curse I'm pissed off, you dumbass, you took it without permission...yeah... but...okay, yes, it was nice just- ask next time, no, not yet, I'll tell him soon".He didn't notice that Ben was standing in the doorway. He debated for a second before speaking up but in the end, opted to
"Likewise, now are you ready to see your aunt blow your pop's mind?" She spoke in a cool soft tone.
"See, told you?"
"Because when I say pops, I'm talking about you."
Tony grabbed Ben's wrist and made him salute Pepper,
"Now, is it me or did you grow a few centimeters, or so?"
"Huh? I don't stare"
"How old were you?
"How did they go?"
Ben took off his glasses and put them on the nightstand as he got under
"We missed you around here, your pops has a stick-up... he is a stick in the mud" "Nice save"
"for example, I'm a Gryffindor but I definitely have Hufflepuff tendencies."
"I can do it"
Peter bit the inside of his cheek at the question
the boy lit up at the mention of take-out.
"Grate".Steve picked up Peter and placed him on his shoulders. As they both said goodbye to them and continued on their way.
"Well, it's been a while since I sang it to you".
He cupped his hands around his mouth to make a makeshift megaphone and yelled out. "Hey, Luke!"
"No, there was this blond lady, I think she was a nurse, but she didn't stick around either. But the reason I asked, was that I know that the mission is to confront our parents and figure out what happened, but what if we add, getting them back together to the list? Think about it, It's been over 10 years and they haven't married someone else, there has to be a reason for that."
"Uncle Bucky told me this would be a good idea to say hi to you ".He said in a shy smile, both his pops and uncles broke into uncontrollable laughter.
Peter was laying his face on the table, he felt very tired, he didn't even put on his eye contacts, The plan was to get up ten minutes after his pops left for his run, and would put them on then and get ready for the day, but he had slept in, which meant that plan went out the window, so right now he accepted that he was blind, he figured this wouldn't be a problem and he would just put them on when he brushed his teeth and maybe being tired would help him not be grossed out.
"Okay, Peter you can do this".
He grabbed the bottle of champagne and poured it into two glasses handing on to his new husband and raising the other in his hand.
"The hell is this!"
"Eww, yes please."
The atmosphere in the room
"Yeah, yeah fine a hundred percent fine."
"Regular tired or car tired?" He took a minute to answer, as he rubbed the back of his neck."The second one I guess?"
"That doesn't sound healthy"
They both laughed before they gave each other a long goodbye hug.
"And...my parents passed away... a lot more happened, that I can't tell you right now".
Steve patted his head and put him aside before getting up
"Really!, you promise?"
Tony had a habit of setting up barriers, that were as cold and thick as iron. That usually led him to the road of isolation and self-destruction, closing himself off, only showing his true emotions in the most destructive way possible. And when he was like this, figuring out time travel or Steve walking through that door in the next five minutes, was be much more likely, than to get him to open up. But, not all hope was lost. Tony knew well, that the only reason why he hadn't emotionally checked out at this point, was because of one thing, or better said two things. His boys were keeping him afloat, they gave him a reason to wake up in the morning, and to keep going, but despite the immense love for his sons, it didn't change the fact that he grew even more tired with every passing day.
"And maybe I can tell you more about how I met your dad"
"Eww"
They said at the same time as they revealed their two half of the picture. That when they were brought together, they form an image of two young men, one with dark black hair another with light blond, the two of them were lovingly staring into each other's eyes as if they were the only two people in the whole world.
"I do, "The taller boy replied with a raised eyebrow and a grin on his face.
"I guess I'm just tired, it's been a really exciting month, plus you know I think the time difference is getting to me."
They both sat at the same time, which caused them to freak out, even more. There was silence between the two until finally Peter slowly lifted his arm and extended it to Ben, it took a few seconds, but eventually Ben did the same. As they touched hands, they didn't discover the secrets of the universe or even felt a static shock go through their bodies, but it still felt weird shaking hands. Johnny slowly made his way up to Peter, handing him the case that contained his glasses. Peter put them on and gave Ben a double look hoping that maybe his blurry vision was playing a game with him, but as he locked eyes with him again, it was confirmed this kid was his clone with shorter hair.
Peter looked at Ben dead in the eyes
Luke and Danny along with the rest of the campers looked up at him then back at Ben.
Peter didn't break eye contact with Ben, as he slowly pulled out a jar of peanut butter.
"No one, don't worry about that right now". He paused and walked over to him "Were you looking for me?"
"Wow, slow down, sport, I promise I'll tell you everything but first, " Peter noticed as a malicious smile appeared on his dad's face."Stay here with your uncle Bucky,"
"Yeah, that'll show us."
"Speaking of friends, you have known my Pops since I was a baby, right? got any good stories?"
Ben's eyes widen he knew this song, his pops would actually sing it when he had nightmares, and every time he would ask where it would come from he would just say somewhere special.
"Yes, now It's only me, dad, Jarvis, Pepper, and Happy not just because they work for us, but, as you can see, because they're all our family."
"You think so?"
"Yeah?"
"Like a canary, thanks, uncle buck".
"To only do it to my uncle Bruce when you suspect him of stealing your yogurt?
Peter watched as everybody got off the bus, he told himself that everything was okay and that he had to calm down.
The soldier almost choked on his drink, his face visually flushed.
He pulled the list from his phone and started reading it in a deadpan tone.
Peter jumped up when he heard his pop's voice who was standing in front of him ."What are you doing in the closet?"He looked at him with a spaced-out look.
"Seems about right."
"Last but not least, various pictures of your family that includes your dear old dad, Pepper, Jarvis, your uncle Rhodey and Bruce, and of course yours truly in case you get homesick?"
how was this possible, he thought his uncle was in a different country and even then, New York was one the biggest city in the US, and they had just happened to be here in a small diner in the middle of Brooklyn in the same time?  the probability of this happening had to be insane and yet here he was, did his uncle Bruce know about this all of this, he had too, right? he and his dad had known each other for years and his dad really only had four friends,  he probably did and there was a big chance he never met his pops, after all, he met Bruce when he was 5 or 6 long after his pops left.
Peter tilted his head, confused by the question. He was in the middle of opening the jar, so he had to put it aside, he licked the peanut butter off his fingertips then cleaned his hand on his shirt, so he wouldn't get the picture dirty.
Ben Extended his hand to help the boy out of the water but instead of lifting him, he ended up falling himself.
The couple continued to slow dance a similar, the tighter they seem to hold each other the easier it was to temporary let go of the lingering fear of the future and get lost in the bliss of their young love as the band continued to play.
Steve held him tighter, it felt as if he thought, that Peter would suddenly turn to dust if he let go of him. "There are still things I'm not ready to tell you but..."
Danny replied innocently, which cost the other two boys to share a malicious smile."I feel like I just walked into a trap," That response made the other two boys break into laughter.
"Spidey?"
" I know."
"But pops, that's what they're waiting for, they want me to put my guard down so they can attack"
"You'll see."
"At least not yet" He heard Natasha say as he grabbed his arm and kissed his cheek."But that is going to change real soon right, sweetheart?"
Ben smiled back at him.
Peter was being vague, he didn't want to reveal too much about his dad, it's not that he didn't trust Ben, he just didn't like how people treated him differently when they found out that the "S" in his name, stood for Stark.
"Here".  his dad stood behind him and helped with his posture.
" Yes ma'am"
Peter had met Johnny about two years ago when his dad and Johnny's brother in law were working together, the two boys quickly became friends, although they mostly talked online, due to the fact they lived in different states, and this was the first time they were able to hang out that didn't involve a lab or conference.
"No, not someone like him, exactly him,"
"You know? you should really enjoy moments like this because I only got like one year of cuteness left".
"...so...do you guys want to get something to drink....or?
Been looked up and was brought face to face with the man in the photo, it was an older version of him, but it was still the man that he had been wanting to meet since he was 9 years old and he was finally here, he was finally here with his dad.
" isn't it obvious, think about it four eyes, who wasn't there for breakfast, who did you make jump in the river naked?!" Jhonny pointed out as he collapsed next to Peter due to exhaustion.
"Wait are you serious?"
"You are a horrible influence on my son".  his pops sounded defeated as he patted Peter's back to signal him to sit down properly."Your food is going to get cold".
Steve laughed and gently nudged him.
"Okay, and what did I tell you about just throwing things around like that...Ben!" Steve let out a sigh of defeat when the boy rushed out before he was done talking.
"Now, you listen carefully, my dad cannot cook, I'm serious, if he offers to cook for you say no, he's just trying to be nice, but I repeat, do not let him cook, trust me I am doing you a favor... oh, and nicknames, he loves giving nicknames."
Peter's smile became impossibly large.
"That's a classic rookie mistake, anyway, I'm Danny. "
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, let's just say that the postage may say New your but it truly came from your father's latest questionable life choice" Jarvis replied with the same annoyed tone as before.
Peter put the phone in his mouth and got up to try to get whatever was under him when he managed to get it, it turned out to be a shoe, he threw it to the other side of the closet and sat back down.
"Yeah, It's the one way in the bottom, do you need any help getting it out-?"
Danny added
Peter nodded his head, swallowing dry.
"I couldn't hate someone who hates Oreos with peanut butter."
Ben said with pride for his dad.
Bucky said before pulling him in for a hug. At first, Peter stood frozen but eventually, he hugged him back.
Peter took a step back not wanting his pops to notice he had contacts lenses on, but this didn't stop Steve, that grabbed his wrist to keep him in place
"That was so gross...I loved it, can you please tell another one?"
Steve said as he buried his nose in Peter's head.
He put them on, they were Big thick frame glasses with no prescription on them, and they were almost identical to Peter's.
"Well, thank you, I do try"
Steve said without looking up from his food.
"Just touching it".
Steve said with the same tone as the kidnapper as he unpacked a box of take-out
"Dad...What?..nevermind?".Ben knew that he had to go through with the mission, he just didn't want all he was feeling to explode out of him like a volcano.
At first, Peter found himself glued to Steve's side, and just like in the car, only responding with two or three-word answers to all of Bucky's questions, but as the day went on something interesting happened. He found himself connecting more with his uncle than his pops.
Ben asked in a small voice as they were fixing the picture with tape.
"Alright, I'm going to go order and get is a table, but don't think I'm not coming back for a re-match."
Ben's face went serious.
Steve turned to him and gave him a long look, his smile dimming down as he arched his eyebrows."Are you really not going to tell me?"
Ben's jaw dropped
"Jokes on him because while he is off being productive I get to see my favorite godson and bring him his favorite take-out."
"Me too".
"...What?"
He picked up his comic book, to show the other boy the damage it had suffered, the book, in this case, was a graphic novel adaptation of a new hope.
Out of habit, Peter pressed his finger on the middle of his forehead as if he was pushing back his glasses.
~13 years later~
" Well, of course, I was going to pick you up, I've missed you like crazy, plus I had to make sure they brought the right kid home."
"Wait, dad, can I asked you something else? He said playing with his hands
Some kid yelled from the back while he made his way through the crowd. Peter turned around taking off his helmet so he could get some water, while his mystery opponent started suiting up. Peter, however, didn't pay too much attention to his new opponent, instead, his attention was on Johnny, who was cheering him on from afar. Peter waved and smiled, at his friend, before putting his helmet back on and turning around to face the other boy.
Peter said with a shrug.
Miles let the basketball fall to the ground when he spotted what had happened to their cabin.
"Well maybe don't stay up all night, what was it you said monster hunting?" He shook his head but still laughed as he placed breakfast on the table and took his own seat.
Peter promised his friend before letting go of him.
This time it was Peter making his dad laugh.
Peter shrugged his shoulders and nodded
The two were sitting in the middle of the living room in their pillow fort, there was a random Disney movie playing in the background and a plate of freshly baked cookies in the middle of the two of them.
"What were you doing with the photo albums?"
Steve pulled Tony's smaller frame to his much bigger one and placed his hand on his waist while Tony rested his head n Steve's shoulder as they started to move along with the music.
"Like uncle Sam and Buck, when you and my dad were married did you act like those two, you still owe me a story"
He could still feel that weird anger and sadness building up inside, especially as they looked through the photos but didn't feel like talking, he wasn't sure what he wanted but he just ignored it and kept going.
Peter did a summersault on his bed and landed on the ground on the other side and answer the phone ."Benny, you won't believe what just happen, it's huge"
"Happy, what are we close to right now?"
Peter pointed to a picture of his house and the diagram he drew of it
Peter looked down where he kept his phone, still worried about his twin, but he told himself that things couldn't have gone too bad, after all, if they did, his dad, would have wasted no time in calling, to tell him he's grounded, until the age of 50, and that he was on his way to pick him up, or Ben, would have tried calling himself. Regardless, something had happened, but he would have to wait until the end of dinner to find out what it was,his anxiety was crank up to eleven, and the strings of messages, also serve as a reminder, that his first day was almost up and he didn't get any information that was useful to the mission, he still wasn't actually sure how to talk to his dad, let alone ask him something without sounding suspicious, but he remembered that Ben told him that if he couldn't get stuff from his dad he should ask his uncle Buck.
The silence stretched on for what felt like ages.
Only to come face-to-face with the subject of all of his deepest fears. Tony was standing directly outside the door in the hall, his presence and sudden movement so entirely unexpected that Steve recoiled without meaning to.
Clint's silence was loud.
He stepped forward again; came so close that Steve could feel the warmth coming off his skin, smell his familiar scent. His hand lifted slowly and for a brief instant, Steve felt relieved at the thought of Tony touching him again. But the other man stopped, fingers hovering a centimeter from Steve's face.
Longer than intended, but still not over.  Part Three will be the longest one yet.  My planning skills may need some work.
Steve shrugged Clint off and stood. He pretended not to need the steadying hand that quickly returned to support him, holding him upright and giving him space at the same time. In that moment, he cursed himself for all that he was putting Clint through. The archer didn't deserve this.
Depressed, guilty Tony? A little harder to handle.
"Clint." Steve reached out with his words, trying to placate, to soothe whatever damage he'd inadvertently done. "I know what you think—"
Tony hid his hurt well, but it was there, flickering brief and deep across brown eyes. The brunette dipped his head in a nod, allowing a moment to pass before he spoke.
Clint pursed his lips. "Something's gotta change, Steve."
He swung back, his momentum leaving a fist-sized dent in the concrete because Tony wasn't stupid, and he knew how this was going to play out just as well as Steve did: maybe better. They traded blows; deflections and blocks, all so expected and sure it made him sick. Occasionally one of them would connect with the full force of their respective weapons—Steve his raw strength, Tony his suit—and one of them would go flying. They'd torn Tony's loft apart, just like this, more times than they could count. Some things never changed.
" This looks fine." He said to himself, he was in the middle of admiring his work, when his door flew open, and before he knew it he was being grabbed and placed over an unfamiliar shoulder.
That was all Peter could say, he was glad she was on their team.
"Got any with me and pops when I was a baby, or better yet...even one with my other dad in it?"
He stands on the platform, everything ready to go, his heart beating a constant echo of
He’s done.
They fall back into old habits of banter and flirting. Tony makes a comment about his ass and Steve feels something slot back into place in his chest. There’s a part of him that almost doesn’t want this to end because he
Pepper knows. They get engaged and Tony refuses to lie to her. She smiles at him sadly and tells him, “I know, Tony. I always knew.”
Tony whimpered, his hips canting back unconsciously, and Steve’s cock trailed along his ass, catching just barely at his hole. Steve grinned ferally at the noise, and did it again, reveling in the needy sounds he was eliciting from Tony.
Steve smiled, chuckled and Tony thinks
Steve growled, low and dark. “You teasing little shit, you know how I feel about you parading like that in front of me.”
Tony nodded, turning his face to try to look back at Steve, showing the desperate tears of need shining in his eyes and Steve smiled savagely, finally reaching down to press firmly at the sensitive spot right underneath the head of Tony’s cock. Tony came with a wail, back arching and ass tightening around Steve’s cock, shaking as he spent himself over the sheets, come dripping from his cock.
“Yeah,” Steve breathed, sprawling lazily on the bed, one hand twining in Tony’s hair so he could tug, arching his back, “fuck yourself just like that. You’re so good for me, baby.”
He never could hide anything from Bucky.
Tony was sobbing into the sheets, incoherent moans and curses mingling as Steve ignored his pleas for a hand, a mouth, anything to help him come and chased his own orgasm instead. He felt pleasure rippling through him at every twitch, every clench of Tony’s ass around him.
He stands through Tony’s anger with a quiet acceptance that surprises even him and refuses to let himself react to the vitriolic words Tony flings at him. He’s tired, so tired, and he just wants his team back.
They go to space.
He thrust into Tony, every movement hard and purposeful, his hips snapping forward. The sound of their skin slapping together was obscene in the otherwise quiet room, the heavy pants echoing through the squelch of lube as Steve fucked into Tony, completely out of his mind with the need to come inside Tony, to make him cry with desperation.
Steve decided that he would show Tony the video of the heckler begging and apologizing as Steve forced the words out of him later, after Tony had gotten used to Steve and his ways. Steve fought down a wave of dizzying heat at the thought of Tony watching Steve carve symbols and blatant messages into others’ skin.
The moment that he recognizes the dark warmth resting heavy on his heart is like a punch to the gut. He feels unbalanced without Tony there to challenge him, draw him out of his dark thoughts and push away the guilt that haunts him at night.
Tony looked over his shoulder, pulling his fingers out with a soft squelch. “Like what you see?”
Tony’s eyes widened for a second, shock filling his expression. “I-I didn’t know… Steve, someone is going to put it together if you keep doing this.”
Tony always knew he loved Steve.
He misses Tony.
He regrets a lot of things but acknowledging the complicated feeling that sometimes feels like it’s been inscribed deep into his bones only after all the pain and struggle sometimes overwhelms him with grief.
He leaned back just enough to see Tony’s hole and line up, pushing inside in one smooth move and groaning loudly at the feeling of Tony’s muscles, just barely loosened, gripping his cock tightly. Tony cried out, his pleasure accompanied by a sting of pain as Steve pushed inside, unafraid of
Steve pulled Tony against him, vowing not to move until he physically had to. He buried his nose in Tony’s hair, closing his eyes and feeling sated for the first time in a week. He felt Tony take a deep breath and then whisper, “We can’t keep doing this.”
Tony gasped out a semblance of affirmation and Steve felt satisfied, acknowledging the curl of heat inside him signaling an impending orgasm. “Are you going to cry for me, Tony? Are you going to beg me to help you come?”
“Strip,” he commanded, stripping off his clothes with precision, tossing them to the floor, eyes fixed on every inch of tanned skin that was revealed, his gaze wandering appreciatively over Tony’s lean muscle. Tony threw his clothes to the floor and looked up at Steve from his place on the bed, want burning in his stare and Steve felt powerful, preening under Tony’s needy gaze.
He lets Steve go with a smile and a quip, standing tall with Sam at his back and Steve knows they’ll be okay.
doesn’t want to lose Tony again.
Tony could only manage a keen as Steve nailed his prostate, his strokes more fast and shallow to push against it, searching for the tears that he craved to see on Tony’s face. “You only open up for me like this,” Steve growled, straightening and grabbing Tony’s waist, never once losing his rhythm, “just for me, do you understand?”
, his choice made long ago with a smile and
He misses the easy camaraderie of those first few years. He dreams sometimes about finding Bucky earlier, bringing him into the Avengers. Tony fixes him and they stay a family, no fighting, no pain.
He can’t live here with the anguish and the memories and Morgan who reminds him so much of Tony. Her curiosity, mischievous smile, and quiet strength under the weight of her father’s death showcase the absolute best of Tony and Pepper combined. She doesn’t know Steve outside of the stories her dad told her and Steve smiles at her through his tears.
"I can't believe you." Steve shook his head, batting away another glass—a bottle, this time—that came sailing towards him. It shattered against his hand and sprayed against the bar. He absently brushed the shards of glass off his sleeve, eying the growing mess distastefully. "I think your immaturity just reached new levels. Congratulations."
Steve swallowed, hating the way he felt.  Hating that he barely felt anything, hating that he felt it all. Sadness. Emptiness. Weariness. The three emotions cycled themselves to exhaustion through his heart, just as they had every day since he set foot back on American soil.
Tony’s voice was close to his shoulder and steeped in poorly-concealed alarm, and Steve ducked his head in embarrassment.   Of course the racket he’d just made had been more than enough to bring the other man running.
"Steve would like that."
To Tony's credit it only took him a few beats to regain his composure after seeing the medley of bruises and bandages around the soldier's stomach, and then he was working the buttons of Steve's jeans with expert fingers.
Standing with some effort, Tony leaned on the bar and seethed down at that stupid package with that stupid wrapping paper and that stupid bow. He remembered buying it; remembered why he'd picked out that ridiculous wrapping paper, even. What he didn't remember was why he hadn't given it to Steve already. From the shadows and light seeping in through the glass, it must have been late afternoon... and the soldier wasn't home. Whatever fight they'd had last night must have been a real doozy.
But he wasn't holding his breath.
Steve was shocked into silence.  His head was spinning.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You need to... get rid of some stuff..." He slurred at Clint, because if he said much else he might crumble.
"Huh." Clint said nothing more.
"What's the occasion?" Steve asked hesitantly when Tony didn't seem to notice his entry.
wrong.”
He didn't blame Tony for this... How could he? Sure, this time Steve had taken the harsher-than-usual brunt of their dysfunctionality, but it could have just as easily been the other way around. He was lucky, if anything: lucky it had been him to hit rock bottom, and not Tony. At least Steve could survive this.
some panicking part of Steve’s brain demanded, a command that got lost somewhere before reaching his lips.
He must have been quiet for too long, because Clint was giving him a veiled look of worry.
He was scared that one day, he would turn around and Steve would dissolve before his eyes. He would fade out of this reality and back into the one from which he'd been ripped. This would all be some cruel dream snatched from his grasp, and the ghost he'd fallen in love with against his will would simply melt back into the pages of time.
"I know."
Steve knew Tony. Inside and out. He knew that once the man made his mind up, he would move heaven and hell to make it happen. The soldier saw that same determination, that same blind, inspiring conviction in the billionaire’s eyes now.
Steve had never admitted it because it was cheesy as all hell, but that first kiss had truly changed his life.  He'd never felt anything like it. Chemistry and tension and
"I can see that," said the doctor quietly, eyes darting, drinking in everything that wasn't there. He finally turned dark eyes to Tony, that ever-present half-smile giving the billionaire the impression that the doctor had a secret to which he wasn't privy. "Didn't like the color scheme?"
Finishing his busy work in the kitchen, Tony joined the soldier at the kitchen bar, their shoulders brushing in the cramped space. Steve’s coffee was light with creamer and sweet with sugar. Tony’s was black.
Steve strained awake, every muscle in his body aching with tension, coiled up and ready for release.
A skyhook had been used to transfer soldiers from one plane to another. Steve, Natasha, and Clint had rappelled onto a cargo transport mid-air in the dead of night and taken out the black ops team en route to crash a peace treaty signing in Israel.
At a loss for words, Steve caved in at last to the unbearable burning in his side and shifted his weight onto his right food in an attempt to ease the stress of standing.
"M'drunk." Said Iron Man, and Steve bravely repressed a grin.
Dumbstruck for a beat too long, Steve searched the other man’s face for a lie he knew he would never find.
"You're inclined to get drunk," Steve retorted with what was, to his mind, the irrefutable logic that should have ended the conversation. There was no point in trying to have any kind of peaceful interaction with the other man when he was in this state. But old habits were hard to break.
When push came to shove, Steve still hadn't been strong enough to resist him.
Steve nodded, certain now that the blackness had somewhat receded from his vision that he was in no imminent danger of passing out.
He fought his way back. Sifting through color and thought, throwing out elements that were clearly fabrications of his own mind and memory, latching onto the lifelines of what he assumed to be truth.
It made him feel more like himself, his old self. The immortal, the soldier.  The Steve of
He did.
As soon as they'd managed to get the soldier stretched out on the too-large bed without making him pass out again, Tony went back to giving Clint the cold shoulder and Clint tried his damndest not to snap the billionaire's neck on the spot.
“I’m not a kid anymore,” slipped out of him for reasons he couldn’t have explained.  It definitely wasn’t what he meant to say.
"I was thinking of keeping it local, actually." Tony narrowed his eyes. "Maybe something a little retro."
“Whatever you go through from here, whatever you’ve been through... I’m gonna be there for all of it. We don’t get a lot of second chances, and I’m damn sure not wasting this one.”
Steve swallowed hard and pressed his aching head back into the borrowed pillow. He couldn't help but wish for Tony's familiar smell in the fabric, the cologne and musk that were so uniquely Tony, usually tinged by equal parts engine grease and alcohol. The billionaire wold call him crazy if he knew, but when Steve was hurt—physically or emotionally—there was nothing in the world that sounded better than curling into his lover's arms and scent and simply existing. No words, no pressure. Just being. Healing.
"Oh, no." Bruce waved him off. "I've gotta drive."
Four short, endlessly distant years ago, waking up half-dressed in each other’s beds had been full of smiles and laughter and obscene implications. Now, Steve couldn’t believe the brunette could even look at him, let alone touch him. The soldier was broken, incomplete, disgusting. He was nothing short of repulsive.
Steve stood by the bar, and waited silently.
"Please, Tony," He pretended not to notice how weak his own voice was, or how faint tremors ran through his fingers, a hand that was usually so strong and sure. "You're going to be—"
Clint spared a last long, lingering look at the super-soldier, his expression torn. A moment later he turned away and disappeared down the hall.
“I couldn't,” the soldier broke open in hitched breath and halted words, dropping his heavy head into his hand, hiding his face. He forced himself to go on. “I wasn't strong enough. I missed you like hell. I wanted you, of course I did. But not like this.”
He knew he should push him away... should keep this whole, perfect person away from his jagged edges and poisonous heart.  He couldn't bring himself to do it just yet.
The soldier wondered again how Tony could read him so well... could provide everything he needed in an easy heartbeat without ever being asked.   Past all the bullshit and hesitation and straight down to the truth of it all.
It just didn't seem worth the effort.
Completely speechless, Steve sat where he was expected to sit, wrapped his hands around the warm coffee cup in front of him, and floated half-aware in his own mind. Between the intoxicating smell of a fresh-cooked breakfast—an odor he couldn’t recall ever smelling in his apartment before—and the lull of pain medication that was mercifully in full effect, he didn’t think he really had the energy to do much else.
Tony, predictably, had a possessive streak a mile wide, but considering theirs was a brand new relationship at the time and he wasn't keen on nuking it right away, he made a valiant effort not to read anything into the growing friendship. Sure, he made regular jabs about the pair, and was particularly vicious about the archer when he was inebriated, but Steve had never given him any reason not to trust him.
A funny, queasy feeling grabbed hard at Steve's gut as he wondered what might happen if Tony realized that he was wearing Clint's clothes. Though honestly, that really should have been the least of his concerns at the moment.
Bruce looked at him. There was no animosity there, or blame or hostility of any kind... simply the amused, slightly condescending glance of a man who knew infinitely more than his student.
When he pulled one out to sit down, it creaked loudly.  Steve winced.
The single window overlooked the complex parking lot, where rows of carports housed the tenants' vehicles. Steve had to squint for it, but he was eventually able to pick out the dark SUV Clint had picked him up in... yesterday? The day before? The assassin was leaning in the passenger side, wielding rubber gloves and a large bottle of bleach.
"I'm not leaving him."
He reflected wryly on his boot camp days as he trudged the final two blocks to the familiar shining tower in the slowing drizzle, reminding him of long hours and miserable runs in heavier rain than this. He wondered if the army had changed in the last several decades as much as the rest of the world had. Perhaps they'd managed to retain some of the dedication, sacrifice, and patriotism that had first drawn him to their ranks all those years ago.
, he’d never been a heavy drinker.  Somewhere during the last few years that had changed. He told himself it was better than the meds, the mind-numbing limbo where he spent his mornings floating helplessly, a broken soul anchored to a broken body by a thin string of willpower and morphine.
"You're not immortal, Steve." Clint's face was shrouded in the darkness, shadows hiding his eyes. "You can be hurt."
"Shit, he's awake."
"Uh-huh."
Steve wasn't sure what that meant.
But it was the moment he'd been waiting for.. and he was going to find a way to fix it. He had to.
"I think you've got more than one home waiting for you." Clint hadn't noticed the soldier's mental lapse.
Tony missed nothing, his eyes flickering downwards to take in the change, and quickly upward again. It took him no time at all to understand that Steve was injured past a few ugly bruises and rain-drenched clothes.
"Hey. Still here, Cap?"
"Did you just punch me?"
"I don't think I need to see any more." Steve approached carefully, reaching for Tony.
It took him a moment as he sat up, gripping the edges of the mattress hard enough to make it creak in protest, to notice Clint standing in front of him with a heavy black jacket in his hand. He accepted it gratefully with shaking hands, and didn't protest when Clint gently helped him pull it on.
"I hurt you," it was a statement not a question, and as much as Steve wanted to deny it, he couldn't look Tony in the eye and say that it wasn't true.
Steve managed to catch Tony's wrist as he reached for the soldier's shirt again.
“Steve,” Tony said urgently, a strange softness in his voice, “I didn't know—I had no idea...”
"I don't know who that is." Steve studied the shot glasses on the counter, mentally gauging how much liquor Tony had consumed in his absence. This was an old game anyway, particularly when Tony had any amount of alcohol in him. It no longer bothered him much, oddly enough.
Feeling anxious and inexplicably sore, Tony resigned himself to not having any answers. But when Steve got back, he was sure as hell going to have some serious explaining to do.
He dropped the gift-wrapped box onto the table and started making drinks.
It took weeks for that one to blow over. Weeks of avoidance and heavy silence and Steve waking up screaming in the night.
His voice fell flat in the wreckage.
"Shit," echoed the deeper voice. "The sedatives won't—"
It damn well broke his heart.
He’d never dreamed those nights would end.  Young and oh so naive, he’d taken it all for granted.  They had been fireworks in the night sky.... Burning and brilliant and invincible.  Fleeting. Immortal.
They barely exchanged another half-dozen words as Tony dressed and groomed. Jarvis eventually alerted him that Miss Potts was waiting in the lobby.
“That’s your cue,” Tony prodded.
“I thought you needed this. I thought you needed space, told myself that had to be it. But I was wrong, okay?  I just didn’t know
The soldier drew in a sobbing breath, and immediately regretted it. Agony rolled over him in nauseating waves, and his vision turned black.
"Sorry about the clothes," Steve mumbled in place of a reply, feeling exhausted. "I'll have them cleaned and sent back."
Tony pretended to be busy in the kitchen just long enough to watch Steve limp—and he hid it well—out of sight.
Steve stood in place uncertainly, watching Tony in silence. There was no way the billionaire was buying the lie. The question that remained was simply how far he was going to push it.
"In the morning," the billionaire revised firmly, sensing the soldier's need for blissful oblivion, "get some rest. I'll be here when you wake up."
Tony leaned in, touched his forehead to the soldier’s in a shatteringly familiar gesture. It made Steve’s chest clench for an entirely different reason.
"Rogers..." The archer began, one hand twisted in the opposite sleeve. His eyes darted towards Tony, and he seemed to re-think whatever he'd been about to say.
"I would have done anything," Tony swore, "
Tony took his time setting his glass down on the bar, and then advanced on Steve so suddenly that the super-soldier wound up falling backwards onto the couch. His muffled sound of surprise was muted by a mouth crashing into his, all sharp teeth and hot breath and unrestrained feeling. They had an on switch and an off switch, and nothing in-between.
Panting for air, Steve curled his fingers tighter into Tony’s sleeve, unwilling to let him go.  Now that he was here, warm and solid and real, the idea of letting him slip away for even a moment was senselessly terrifying.
"This looks stupid..." He muttered to himself around his glasses, examining the black and white illustrations. "What does he see in these guys?"
Panting with exertion past spasming muscles and a screaming phantom pain that emanated from the place his right knee had once been, Steve stood.  He wavered there for a moment, blinking at the angry sunbeams jutting through half-closed blinds. A faint knocking sound was manifesting between his temples, reminding him that he was dehydrated and probably several hours past due to take his morning medications.
Glaring daggers at the billionaire, Clint did as instructed, backing away hesitantly. He clearly didn't feel completely comfortable leaving Steve alone with his boyfriend but he was going to have to accept it sooner or later, and he seemed to know it.
"Try using a chute next time, Cap." The mechanical voice in his ear was all the proof he needed that he wasn't dead and hallucinating. Relief flooded his senses. Tony had him. Of course Tony had him.
Steve's resolve to be truthful crumbled. He'd shaped his life around protecting the man who stood in front of him now, looking at him like the answer to the one question could make or break him.
Small details, maybe, but they were all signs the soldier hadn't been the last one in and out of the cramped room during the night.  The whole thing was surreal, and Steve felt his face warming with embarrassment as he dragged a rough hand over his eyes.
“I know,” the soldier admitted, and the words cost him.  “I can’t lie to you. But the truth Tony... it’s ugly.”
"Eleven o'clock. You're welcome." The archer approached the bed, squatting by Steve's side to examine the red-stained dressings wrapped around his abdomen.
The soldier wondered, not for the first time, how different things might have been.
The coffee vanished quickly, Tony’s a little faster than Steve’s. The brunette poured them each another mug, cleared away the plates, and loaded the seldom-used dishwasher within minutes. Maybe Steve’s brain wasn’t moving like it used to, or maybe he just wasn’t used to getting anything done quickly or easily these days, but the brunette’s effortless grace still impressed him.
When Steve finally opened the bathroom door, he wasn’t quite ready to face his ex-lover, but not quite ready to hide forever.  The only way out was through, he told himself. The stark contrast of the cool air in the hallway against his damp, too-warm skin made him shiver. He tried not to hesitate too long. Stalling wasn’t going to do him any good fighting this particular battle.
Steve hesitated.
Steve was sweating again by the time he made it back to the mattress, sitting shakily and reaching for the now-clean boots that sat nearby. He didn't answer.
Steve squinted up through the falling raindrops at the church, nodding once to he knew-not-who.
Tony returned that evening to an empty, eerily quiet apartment. Steve's cell phone sat, forgotten as usual, in its charging cradle on the shelf. Tony picked it up with a gentle smile. It was an expression that faltered when he saw the two missed calls from Clint Barton, and that was suddenly all it took to sour his mood completely.
I know this was two weeks in the making so thank you for your patience.  This part was tough to write, and not just because it's almost twice as long as the last two.  Mostly because the "ending," the part where things work out and everyone gets a (somewhat) happy ending, still hasn't happened for me yet.  A girl can dream, right?
Tony paused for breath, shaking his head, at a loss for words. Steve saw cracks in the armor, the reality of a man who’d been hurting just as much as he had been.
Steve fumbled for the pill organizer which had been miraculously returned to its home by the faucet since the previous night. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d needed them this badly. Steve knew that at least some of the added pain he was feeling was psychosomatic; it was borne of stress and the sharp claws of anxiety currently sunk into his lungs. That didn’t make him any less eager to down the handful of medication and wash it down with sink water.
Steve took his time in the bathroom, splashing his bruised face with cold water and running his fingers through his hair, trying to shape the image in the mirror to fit the one he wanted Tony to see: a super-soldier who was healthy, confident, and put-together. It wasn't really working, if he were to be completely honest with himself. Instead he looked like he'd gone twelve rounds with the Hulk and had a wardrobe change somewhere in the middle.
Thick black smoke billowed out of Steve’s lungs and reached for Tony, ready to suck him in and consume him like it had every other part of his life.  Terror rippled through the soldier’s chest.
Steve tried not to sound as exasperated as he felt, while wondering if running through the familiar lines would ever produce a different result. Their script was getting stale, but the super-soldier could barely keep up with his lover when he got like this, all snide remarks and veiled jabs and illogical rants. Steve was a simple man of simple words, and Tony knew it. It was why they played these games. Because Tony needed to feel in control—powerful, like his suit—and this was the only way he knew how.
"Bruce." Tony opened his arms in welcome as the doctor stepped off the elevator, "to what do I owe this pleasure?"
Clint nodded. Silence reigned between them, made less uncomfortable only by the barrage of rain against the window. At least the hail had stopped, Steve thought gratefully. Now he could hear himself think.
“Why don’t you understand?”  Steve gasped, “why...”
Relief flooded the green eyes swimming before his vision, and deceptively strong arms were under his own, hauling him upwards into a fresh barrage of mind-numbing pain.
Just like every other time he'd staged this internal monologue, he received no answer.
“Yeah, why don’t you put some hair on that chest and we can talk,” Tony returned easily.
"I don't know," Clint's tone still held that uncharacteristic gentleness, a sound that would have been more unnerving to the solider if he'd been fully aware of his surroundings.
Walking
The next day, Tony 'accidentally' locked Steve in a Hulk-proof glass chamber he'd been working on for the Avengers. He'd treated himself out to a nice dinner that evolved into an all-night party.
Tony held him. Steve was sober enough this time to feel it. To truly remember that it was everything the soldier had needed and feared. He was almost dizzy with the relief of being back in Tony’s arms.  Back in the only place he’d ever felt like himself, like someone who belonged.
"Well, I guess... what did happen, Steve?" There was that all-too-familiar undercurrent of bitterness hiding in Clint's voice, but it was clear that he was also making a real effort to understand. To be supportive and withhold his judgment, for what that was worth. The olive branch was clear.
The soldier clutched at the jagged, bleeding edges of himself and pulled them together tight like torn flesh.
Steve laughed despite himself, and there was no humor there.  He couldn’t get a grip on how ruthlessly his heart was aching, how torn he felt. Balancing on an edge that was just waiting for the right push to crumble.  There was something raw and selfish in his heart, pushing him to accept the hand being held out to him like a lifeline in a storm because he
Working his jaw, he glared across the room at Steve's forgotten cell phone. Not that his boyfriend ever answered it even when he had it on him, but at that particular moment, Tony would have killed to be able to call him.
Maybe it was supposed to be closure.  The same closure he’d been so sure would never be granted to him.  Maybe that’s all it was.
Bruce nodded knowingly, and that put the billionaire on edge even more.
Clint clearly hadn't expected such an easy surrender, and Steve could hear his surprise in the moments of quiet that followed.
He knew he should resist, that he should try harder.  He was just having a hard time remembering exactly why.
He realized, with sudden, astounding clarity, that maybe he had been the one who had been lying to himself all along.
Tony followed her to the register and paid for the DVD's while Pepper stepped outside to take a call. At least he could give himself an "A" for effort, he congratulated himself inwardly. He even had the cashier gift-wrap the box in an obnoxious white and blue polka dot print that looked slightly retro if you squinted at it. Steve would appreciate that, he hoped.
his brain told him.
The soldier thought of Tony in a Turkish hangar, frenzied and panicked and waiting for air clearance.  He thought of reaching for Sergeant Barnes’ bloody hand through the rubble, and realizing the gloved arm wasn’t attached to a body anymore.  He thought of being weak and alone and wishing, ashamed, that he was strong enough to die.
Some days, he really wished he could join his boyfriend in alcohol-induced temporary insanity. That way, neither of them would remember the conversation the next day, and they could nurse a hangover together. Somehow, that seemed like a simpler option.
Tony was standing in front of him in an instant, looking so damn pained that Steve regretted saying anything at all.
He thought about how smoke tasted like blood and failure and
There was a loud ringing in his ears, and he knew Tony was talking to him because he could feel the vibrations thrumming through the chest pressed against his cheek. He could
Tony used his thrusters on Steve. This had never happened before, because despite their mutual brutality and aggression, neither of them had ever actually wanted to hurt the other. They avoided lethal tactics by unspoken agreement, and part of that was the thrusters on Tony's suit. Not because they were strictly dangerous, but because when they fought like this, Tony didn't hold back. And at full strength, those thrusters were deadly.
Voicing his pain like this was not something he had been prepared for, and as humiliating as it was... it felt like lifting a weight off his chest.  Giving voice to thoughts that had never seen the light of day, confessing his sins at Tony’s altar. It was chance he’d never thought he’d have.
It didn't.
"I'm so sorry, Steve. I'm sorry I wasn't there. God knows I tried to get to you, I was so damn
As if the coffee wasn’t enough, two glasses of orange juice had materialized out of thin air onto the countertop, and Tony must have walked down to the grocers on the corner because Steve knew for a fact he’d never had any in his refrigerator.
"Don't hold back, Captain." Tony, now thankfully earthbound, was laughing, barely able to stand up straight. "Don't pull your punches just because my bones can break."
Lips parted, panting, Steve felt the words escape him.  Whatever remained of his self-preservation choked at him like a hand around his throat.
"Barton," Tony greeted, if greeting it could be properly called. Steve could have chipped the ice off of his boyfriend's tone with a chisel if he'd had a mind to. "What do you want?"
The warring halves of Steve’s brain tugged at him mercilessly as he ate, demanding answers.
Clint had been strangely silent, until Steve prodded him for some response.
He followed Tony out into the entry just as the elevator doors opened.
"I have to... have to go." Steve came to the conclusion slowly, but made no move to sit up. He didn't think he'd be able to quite yet.
“I love you, kid.” The billionaire finished his tirade, shrugging helplessly. “God help me, I never stopped.”
The pills... those were the band-aids doctors slapped on dying men.  The pharmaceutical catch-all for a pain and misery that no-one wanted to admit was truly incurable.  Steve wasn’t ready to accept that yet.
That was a variable Steve had never considered. Not that he had held any reasonable expectation of keeping up the ruse for long, but this was still a bit abrupt. He'd needed time, preparation...
He was there, but he wasn't there. Steve lived in a world of shifting shadows that ran its course parallel to his own; an alternate view of even the simplest moments, the briefest touches, that left the pair looking inwards from two sides of the same mirror.
In and out.
, urgently whispering that he might not survive without it.  The fighter in him railed, the stubborn spirit that even wounded and dying just wanted so badly to latch onto anything it could find to keep going.  To keep struggling.
"Good," Tony played along; nodded and forced a smile that wasn't meant to fool anyone. He turned and made his way up the short flight of steps to the kitchen.
Hyper-conscious of his boyfriend's gaze, the soldier found himself physically incapable of meeting Tony's eyes now, or even glancing at his features to determine his reaction to what he saw. Even he hadn't taken the time to examine the full extent of his own injuries; not without the comforting barrier of cloth to cover the worst of the wounds on his torso.
But Steve never would have had the guts to lean in the first time they kissed.  He could walk into a warzone unflinching, but he damn sure wouldn't have been brave enough to pull Tony into the dark kitchen of the banquet hall for a private moment, at two in the morning after the awards ceremony had long ago wrapped up.  Steve wasn’t that brave.
Steve felt his face burning. He wordlessly took the crutch back and leaned it against the wall by the light switch.
"Was this me?" Tony finally made a vague gesturing motion to Steve, his tone too loaded with meaning. There was something dark and unfamiliar in his voice, like he was dreading the answer more than anything.
As the soldier painfully levered himself into a sitting position, the events of the previous night came pouring back into his consciousness.
A sound that was needy and desperate came from his throat and it didn’t stop Tony, thank god it didn’t stop him.  The burnette only pulled him closer. Fingers that didn’t shake threaded through his hair, tugging him in, deeper.  Surrendering was too easy.
Steve showered robotically, changing into the neatly-folded clothes he had long ago learned to keep in the bathroom cupboards instead of in his own closet. Anything to minimize footwork. The lukewarm water helped to clear his head, and by the time he finished combing his tousled hair and brushing his teeth he felt moderately more composed.
“Oh, good. Don’t worry about it,” Tony was bending deftly, picking up the hated aluminum with an ease Steve hated and admired, “just glad you’re okay.  You definitely made me jump there, kid.”
Steve swallowed. "Yeah, well we'll see about that."
And all the while, his mind screamed at him that it was wrong, that he couldn’t inflict himself like poison on someone he loved so completely... because the possibility was terrifying.  The possibility that instead of Tony saving him, the soldier ruined him instead. Sucked him down into hell with him, where the demons screamed in the smoke.
"I know." Clint hesitated, and reached awkwardly for Steve's arm. "That's what really freaks me out."
"I understand that I pulled you out of his building covered in blood and glass. I understand that Banner pumped four pints of blood back into your body before he was convinced you'd wake up again." Clint was angry—it was in his voice, quiet and cold. In the line of his shoulders and the color of his eyes.
It was also tough to limit myself to a three-parter, when this is a subject I could probably write about indefinitely without feeling satisfied.
The soldier knew he was playing a dangerous game.  He could feel himself slipping father and farther down that slope every day.
With a jolt of panic, Steve realized he was dangerously close to hyperventilating.  He struggled to calm the jagged breaths he was sucking in too fast, his chest refusing to expand.
"This is all we are." Tony hissed, encroaching into Steve's personal space again, until they could feel one another's breath on their skin.
It shouldn't have worked between them as well as it did.
He fell.
“Tony—!” The name broke from his lips. It was the same name that had slipped unbidden from his mouth every night for four long years.
"I don't know, Stark." The doctor shrugged, his eyes fixed distantly on the windows. "I guess we'll find out."
Steve stared down into his glass, thinking distantly that the orange was the brightest color in the room.
For not the first time in the past twenty-four hours, he thought over the events of that disastrous night and tried to make sense of them; tried to understand that key moment at which he had made the fatal mistake. There was something—there must have been something—that he could have done to change all of this.
Morning dawned, harsh and bright and entirely too early for Steve's pounding head.
The wind that swept down ninth street was chill and oddly peaceful, just brisk enough to keep silent bystanders from losing themselves in the memories and emotions that were cohabitants of places like this. It was a much-needed anchor in a sea of nostalgia, a balm to wounds waiting to reopen.
Steve's grip, slick with blood, slipped.
He couldn’t have said with confidence how much time passed.  He only knew that at some point his brain told him to move and he obeyed.
Less than a mile into his trek the soldier found himself pausing for breath on FDR Drive, leaning heavily on the nearest wall and trying to look casual about it. Despite the raging storm the crowds had scarcely abated. Granted, they appeared now decked in more practical boots, coats, and umbrellas, but the untimely weather had no effect on the fact that rain or shine they had somewhere to be.
"Yeah. Did it work?"
Steve frowned, walking towards the counter. "You need to... feel powerful?"
He felt it again that night, in the shadowed half-light of his bedroom with Tony curled around him.  The brunette’s arm was draped across the soldier, holding him close even in sleep.
“I am
Fury would just love that hitting the news...
"I'll make sure to put a pot of coffee on," Tony bit back, faking a smile and not offering to show the archer out.
Hawkeye said something in rapid Russian. He sounded relieved, but beyond that, no sense could be made of the phrase.
Clint was singing out loud to himself, toneless and lazy. He leaned back in a metal chair and peeled an orange with a knife the size of his arm, impaling the blade in the table when he finished with it. Steve watched him silently, paying undue attention to the way deft fingers picked the piece of fruit apart.
Tony had already disappeared into his massive closet by the time Steve limped into the room, and the other man emerged a moment later with the appropriate garments—namely, a pair of dark blue pajama pants and a white t-shirt. He dropped the things onto the bed and approached the soldier, gesturing impatiently for him to lose his clothes.
By all accounts, Steve was gone. Not surprising, really. Most of their fights ended like this. They'd have another one in the morning—on a smaller scale as Tony bemoaned a hangover—or better yet, they'd pretend it had never happened.
"Tony..." Steve mumbled in the beginnings of protest, his heart physically aching for his lover. He didn't want to leave Tony like this, but exhaustion was pulling at the corners of his mind, and the new waves of pain from a doubtless-reopened wound urged him to give in to it.
One of his targets, the enhanced merc—had his opening. Cold steel slid between sinew and tissue.
"How long?" The soldier rasped.
The smoke that reached out for Tony flinched back, curling and billowing and fading slowly into white.  The soldier didn’t know what that meant.
It was not a word he said when he was awake. It was not a name he allowed his waking mind to dwell upon. It was a soul-deep ache that came upon him when he was sleeping and unguarded, when the deepest, realest parts of his heart yearned for a man he had once loved with every fiber of his being.
The fight had been short enough. Guys with that much bulk, that much raw, untrained strength, tended not to have a lot going for them in the brains department. But sometimes, they got lucky.
It was hard for Steve to look at him, hard to make eye contact. He couldn’t hold it for long.
Steve didn't look at Tony for the next few minutes as the billionaire gently, almost clinically stripped his boyfriend of his borrowed, water-logged clothing and helped him into the more familiar dry garments. Steve didn't miss the fact that Tony hadn't touched the bandages yet, though he was just as sure that his boyfriend hadn't forgotten about them either.
The archer had never moved, never turned a moment's gaze towards Steve. He flipped the magazine in his lap and took a bite out of his orange.
"What happened, Steve?"
"You don't need to worry about that."
his brain churned out warnings in rapid-fire succession, desperate to delay the downward slide.
The brunette's mouth was dry and his throat begging for another drink, but his last glass had somehow vanished from his hand, and the bar seemed so far away. He wasn't sure if he could make it all the way over there with the room spinning like it was. So decided, he stayed put, letting his helmet-clad hair drop back against the arm of the couch.
"Working on it. Keep him still."
"I'm fine, Tony," Steve's own throat was closing up, and this was the last thing he needed and he really hadn't expected things to go this way.
"It's fine," the words were clipped, signaling the end of the conversation, "unharmed, in fact."
“Please,” Steve choked out, broken by the moment and unable to tell what he needed or wanted or was even asking.
"Dammit, Steve!" The archer hissed, "you came inches—moments from..." The archer's voice cut off, and he swallowed hard, seeming to need a moment to compose himself. "If I had been a few minutes later—if you hadn't called me; if I hadn't answered my phone—"
Steve awkwardly cleaned abandoned clothing and paperwork off the two rickety stools pushed under the bar.  He wasn’t sure he’d ever actually used them before.
Tony was rambling again. Steve allowed his mind to wander. Specifically, to how he was going to get Tony to bed and this mess cleaned up before Pepper came in tomorrow and turned those knowing, slightly disapproving eyes on him. She never said it outright, but Steve was fairly certain that she didn't particularly approve of this. He couldn't blame her, honestly. He probably wouldn't have either if he were in her shoes.
The soldier approached and sat quietly down next to the archer, glancing at the single broken arrowhead Clint was turning over and over in his hands. Their knees touched, warm through canvas and cloth. Steve crossed his arms tight over his chest and leaned back, letting the stillness and warmth act as a gentle balm to his raging headache and crashing adrenaline.
"Steve?"
“Some of us don’t get second chances Tony,” Steve felt the anger that bubbled up, all the ways he hated himself for what he’d lost rushing ruthlessly to the surface. “I’m not the same person—I’m not even a whole person anymore. Goddamnit
"Let me help you get him to bed," Clint was saying, his reluctance to help Tony with anything clear, "he just needs to rest."
"Well, it's always lovely to see the rest of the freak show." Tony grinned, stepping behind the bar. "Can I get you a drink?"
... I knew you were going to leave anyways, I couldn’t... couldn’t go through that—”
"This—what happened—it wasn't his fault."
Tony Stark was no idiot. Most of the world knew this, and were constantly reminded by grandiose expos, elaborate inventions, and aggressive advertising campaigns.
A door creaked in the darkness, startling the soldier upright. His chest was heaving for the oxygen his sleeping mind had deprived himself of, his eyes wide in the semi-gloom.  Smoke filled his mouth, filled his lungs, came pouring out of him like poison, hellbent on consuming everything it touched.
“Not true.”
"Paris Hilton."
"We're not doing this, Tony." Steve's tone held resignation and carefully guarded sadness as he reached for the drink in the iron-clad hand. "Not tonight."
"You didn't mean to," Steve pleaded, "it was an accident. These things happen."
"Come on," Clint was at his side, prying the golf club out of his hands and taking its place under Steve's heavy arm.
"You, uh... you'd better get that," Steve nodded, smiling wryly as he was reminded of Clint's over-protective presence. He could only imagine what conclusions the archer would jump to if he wasn't able to reach Steve right away.
it, but for the life of him he couldn’t make out a sound.
“Sorry,” the soldier mumbled awkwardly, gripping the porcelain sink for balance and sanity. “I just—I dropped it—“ he gestured dumbly to the floor where his fallen crutch lay wedged between the tub and the counter.  He hated that he was too humiliated to even form a complete sentence.
“Steve?”
Dumbfounded, Steve stared into Tony’s eyes, like he’d never seen him before. Maybe, he thought, he never really had.
"Steve?" He questioned urgently, brows furrowed. "You with us?"
Steve. Steve.
Few things in the chaotic new world of 2012 were as ugly and colorless as sleep.
Steve's jaw was hurting again, and he made a list of all the angry and hurtful things he wanted to say; building behind his tongue, scratching at his lips and begging for air. He locked them away and moved on.
"Clint..." Steve found the name hard to mumble past split and swollen lips, and he licked the chapped skin experimentally. "What's... what's going on?"
"Yeah, see that?"
"Tony, stop..." The gasped words were garbled against that searching mouth,which may have been a mistake because it made the other man moan back and press both hands hard into Steve's neck, almost crushing him. He could feel the bones grinding together, creaking under the unbelievable pressure. The sounds were lost in the wind.
Tony was, by now, an expert at observing others while seeming completely engrossed in his own activities, and it was a skill that came in handy on a regular basis where Steve was involved. For example, he chose to occupy himself now by perusing the morning paper. Subsequently, he ensured that Steve downed his entire breakfast before he snatched both their bowls away and tossed them in the sink.
When Tony finished, drying his hands with a faded dish towel he must have fished out of a forgotten drawer, he rounded the small kitchen island. His hand landed on Steve’s arm, pulling him gently to stand. He shouldered the blond’s weight and guided him to the couch.
“I don’t care,” Tony shrugged almost dismissively, “I really don’t.”
“I’m not a soldier anymore, Tony,” Steve had to make him understand, “I’m not myself... I lost everything that
Steve spent the next hour in agony-induced delirium, the pain seeming to build with every moment he spent in consciousness. But conscious he remained, counting every one of the forty-two stitches that were pulled through his inflamed and bleeding side, clenching onto Clint's hand and trying his damnedest not to hurt him, tying to simply remember how to breathe.
"Yeah, I got that."
He thanked her, his voice heavy with sarcasm, and tucked them into his jacket as they returned to the car.
Steve didn't offer to stay.
"Steve?" A face intruded upon his shaky vision, all worn lines and soft green eyes.
"Guys," Steve tried to interject, dreading the course this conversation was taking. Needless to say, his words had very little effect.
Tony shrugged one shoulder, wondering why he felt like there was something huge he was missing here. "Out doing whatever Steve does, I would suspect. We don't exactly keep each other on a running satellite feed. It's a little something called 'trust'."
"We, are doing just fine." Tony made sure to stress the 'we'. "Happy as larks, and all that."
He was hyper-aware of the sensation of a needle sliding, slick and cold, through his torn flesh.
Why couldn’t Tony
He couldn't resist hoping as memory flooded back in that maybe, his lover hadn't even noticed he was gone yet. If he had some time, he was sure he could get back and fix this... this mess. He wasn't sure what time it was; what day... But it couldn't have been long if he was still in this much pain.
Steve wasn't sure what to feel.  He knew he hadn't imagined it; knew that it hadn't been a twisted figment of his own dark imagination fueled by alcohol and countless pills.  He’d had enough of those waking dreams to know what they felt like. To know they were empty and numb and hollow.
Tony was kneeling in front of him now, eyes bright with concern and something else undefinable.
Clint didn't look amused.
Steve's gaze slid sluggishly across to the figure hunched over his side. It took him a moment to recognize Doctor Banner. He hadn't seen the other man in months.
Steve recoiled with a cry of pain as heat and light and force combined to blind him, and for a moment it was all he could think of and this wasn't real, because they didn't fight like this. They didn't try to hurt each other. It just happened.
He can’t.
Tony says that he saw this coming and a strange mixture of vindication and sorrow is warring through him as he makes plans to save the world.
. Pepper cries into his shoulder and he grips her tightly, refusing to let go of this lifeline he desperately needs.
This isn’t how Steve imagined it going.
Tony’s eyes were half-lidded, his arm shaking from his obvious need. Steve felt a growl bubble up in his chest at the sight of Tony scrambling to please him, only him. “Faster,” Steve ordered, “I want to see you fuck yourself faster.” Tony complied, a needy moan escaping him. “Turn around, I want to see your fingers sliding into your pretty hole.” Tony whined, but obeyed, shuffling around until Steve was staring at the two fingers now stuffing Tony’s hole, stretching it in preparation for the cock currently twitching against Steve’s thigh.
Tony absorbs that revelation and then makes sure she knows that it’s done. It’s in that box locked away in his mind and it’s not coming back.
He holds his breath and leaps.
Tony sat back, rubbing his temples with his fingers. “You can’t just go around killing everyone who’s mean to me.”
Steve gazed up at him, knowing that his eyes were still steely and unyielding. “You do when I’m coming over.”
Steve held Tony’s hips, rocking him down against his lap, pressing the thickness of his hard cock against Tony’s ass. “I don’t care,” He said, eyes dropping down to the red stain on Tony’s shirt, completely unashamed at the arousal that swept through him at the sight of the blood marking Tony. The blood that he had pried out of that asshole just moments before was now dried against Tony’s skin, the shirt ruined.
The first thing he laid eyes on as he stepped up to the "A" labeled shelf was a thin-bound box set that read "Abbott and Costello".
All the breath left his lungs in a painful whoosh as an iron band closed tight around his chest without warning, stopping his fall so abruptly that it made him dizzy. His good hand came up automatically to grip the new support, eyes screwed shut as he tried to get his bearings. He'd never felt so out of control in his life.
"I'll be there in a few minutes," Barton promised, "stay where you are."
By the time the soldier realized that he was drifting out of awareness, the lull of darkness was so tempting that he had to claw his way back with effort. He couldn't abandon Tony like that, couldn't scare him that way by letting go. Not yet.
It seemed like years before Clint was shaking him again, slapping his face harshly and commanding him to return to full awareness.
For the first time in years, something familiar stirred in the soldier’s gut.  A passion and warmth that he hadn’t come close to feeling since the last time Tony’s lips were on his, since that weight held him down, tethered here in reality.  Since those hands wrapped around his arm, his wrist, his neck. Always touching. Always there to hold him down, next to Tony. Where he belonged.
