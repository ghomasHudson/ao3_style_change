“I technically am still in the vehicle.” He said seriously before his straight lips began to curl into a guilty, adrenaline fuelled grin. He couldn’t believe just how good it felt to actually get out of the apartment and do some actual police work!
Steve could taste himself on Tony’s tongue and the idea almost made him hard again. It was having a similar effect on Stark who was moaning at the feather-light pressure his dick was receiving from simply their torsos being pressed together.
In the millisecond you have before you explode your brain immediately jumps straight to, “Oh shit!”
He scolded himself again, “Stop it.” He sniffed and buried his face into the pillow, “Oh, Tony.” He groaned out.
. Steve didn’t want to admit that he was beginning to lose patience; his whole life he’d prided himself on being patient and calm but the concept of having to sit through another Die Hard movie again made him want to be blind instead of deaf.
Steve smirked slightly in response as he recognised her from a couple of cases he'd worked in the past.
Steve rolled his eyes again, a motion a found himself expressing several times a day when around Stark,
Quite an argument had been woven around the situation and Tony just wanted to please Steve in anyway possible, “I’ll do it if it makes you happy but if you even have an ounce of a second thought let me know and it’ll be like it never happened.” He felt unsettled as he agreed it.
He sighed, “Look, just listen okay. You’ve reacted badly to this but you’re not understanding what I mean. I don’t want us to break up, I don’t want you to start a relationship with anyone else, I don’t want a thrupple.” Tony chuckled as it was a word he’d taught Steve only a few days before, “I just want you to be happy and as healthy as possible. Sex is a normal part of life and it’s important you release that tension.” Tony was about to interrupt but Steve placed a finger over his lips, “All I’m suggesting is that you go, every few weeks or so, find someone in a bar or call whoever and just enjoy yourself. It doesn’t need to be more than that.” His eyes were pleading.
“D’you need a ride?” Tony smirked as he prepared to take to the air again.
Only an hour later he was dressed and stepping out the door of the tower. He looked back up and swallowed thickly at the thought of Steve being alone while he was out with a stranger. However, the drive in his guts had him moving towards the nightclubs. Hopefully he’ll be back within a couple of hours so he could make it up to his partner.
There was a moment of silence, they stared at each other until Stark filled the gap, “I always pictured you sleeping in a full pyjama suit, buttoned fully up.”
“Oh, I’m sorry... thank you, Tony.” He lowered his newspaper to look directly into Tony’s face.
All eyes were on Clint and he started with a breath steadying sigh, “Alright everyone, I have to start with a confession... When I first heard about Steve and Tony’s relationship I didn’t believe they would make it a week, let alone 5 years.” Some of the crowd chuckled, “I still partly think they’re not really together and this is all one large prank on me.” The laughter scattered from table to table, “This is despite almost everyone I spoke to telling me that there was something about them that just made them perfect for each other. It took me nearly 5 years but slowly they began to show me what made them so undeniably perfect for each other. Mostly their balance,” An image popped up on the screen of Steve holding Tony above his head, it had been done as a bet where Tony bet Steve he couldn’t hold up above his head. Both of them had known he could but he wanted the experience,
He squinted into the technology and managed to get his fingers amongst the wires and pistons. He found the solution almost immediately; a wire had gotten wrapped around the mechanism that pushed the leg back into a straight position after it bent to take a step. He wiggled them apart and re-tested the movement. It was now smooth like it was designed to be but being this close up Stark could identify several components that could be altered or upgraded. His mind was already whirring at potential changes he could make in his lab and the thought of having such a worthwhile project excited him.
It was the sudden ringing of the doorbell that snapped him from his trance and forced him to manoeuvre off the soft cushions to see who had decided to make his day unendingly more interesting. At this point, a single letter, even a bill, would brighten his gray day: at least he’d be able to spend a few minutes reading over what was written there.
The other detective acted flirty and put on doe eyes, “Did you just call me ‘Tony’? You’ve never actually called me by my first name. Does this mean we’re official? Wait, on the marriage certificate are we going for my last name or yours because quite frankly Mr Stark-Rogers is obscene.” He didn’t want to try and figure out how he knew Steve had never used his first name but hearing him say ‘Tony’ felt right.
“Stark, the top brass are demanding more progress on the Rogers case. We need to start acting offensively in our evidence building. I need you to go undercover in a coffee shop close to Rogers’ hide out to try and get some more intel. At this point, any piece of information would help.” He passed the file across. It had details of Tony’s undercover identity and the coffee store he was to pose in.
The smile made his stomach clench slightly as Steve rarely displayed such a charming and light-hearted grin around him. He felt himself flush as Rogers continued staring at him with soft eyes.
Tony sighed, he knew Clint was right but he also believed that any information on Rogers’ situation in that building could only give them power. He knew he couldn’t be offended by Clint’s assumption about him sleeping with witnesses or others on cases as he’d accidentally done so a couple of times before and he couldn’t deny that Steve Rogers was one of the most attractive criminals he had even dealt with.
"But now we have to deal with a body." Natasha rolled her eyes. She complained as though it was a inconvenience but not a hardship.
“Thank you for the offer but I’d rather not be on my own right now.” He mumbled.
The man spoke, “At ease, soldier! Look, I’m sorry about that little show back there, but… we thought it best to break it to you slowly.”
Steve’s large fingers twisted into Tony’s hair as he threw his head back.
He could hear the archer lowering his bow, “I know you won’t take any of my advice but at least think about it, okay?”
As if scolding himself for being a terrible nurse, Tony leapt up and rushed to grab Steve's drink. He carefully brought it to the man's lips. Steve tried not to notice how intently the billionaire stared at his mouth.
Steve smiled to himself and snuggled back down against his partner, “I haven’t needed them since you’ve been sharing a bed with me but they’ll always be handy for situations like this.” He swallowed before adding, “Thank you for saving me that night.”
He slipped closer to the man and raised the gun to aim towards his head.
The boss stood from behind his desk and strode over to the cop, he held out a large hand and offered a reassuring smile, “Detective, I’m so glad you could make it. We’ve been looking forward to your visit for some time.”
"Why would you need me?" His grey eyes scanned the area outside the car. If this was a trap he was taking people down with him. His fingers twitched in an instant desire to grasp his blades, "You have... her. What's her name?"
Stark grabbed his arm to stop him, “You're the one recovering from a freaking gunshot wound. I don't need my beauty sleep in order to run well!”
The large man, who currently seemed more like an over grown puppy, stopped in front of his teammate and smiled, “I don’t know if I could ever thank you.”
Despite some of his past actions and mistakes, Tony wasn’t stupid but actually quite the opposite. He knew that Rogers would begin to interweave truth with lies to  blend them together and conceal better. It was a typical charade that all Detective’s are taught to be aware of during their training as criminals could be just as smart as the Detectives questioning them. Although, Stark was smarter than most as he had finished school early and entered the Academy a couple of years early so he hoped he’d be at an advantage.
Steves smile caused creases around his eyes and he couldn’t stop smiling all the way to bed. Sometimes being deaf was incredibly isolating but every now and again someone will reach out and make a difference.
Tony could think of one problem, “Rogers has seen my face... several times. He knows me.”
"You know, I do really like Pina Coladas," Tony smiled.
"Well somebody could have told me this previously! 2 days ago he was nearly dying so I didn't exactly expect him to be up to his old tricks," The billionaire defended himself, "Anyway, why don't you just go to his house and bring him back?"
The billionaire was about to question the man when the music kicked in and his jaw dropped. How could he suddenly be dragged back to 5 years ago by one simple song.
It wasn't very often Natasha had the word 'tried' associated with her. She was a 'doer' person. She gracefully dumped herself in one of the the chairs at the table.
Steve leant back to distance himself from the fumes. As he was doing it, he had to repeatedly remind himself that this guy had been murdering innocent people and planning to murder many more to test his drugs and nuclear weapons. Shield had dug up more dirt but Steve honestly didn't want to know it all. He’d rather do his job and move on.
A crease formed between his brows, “Where am I?”
Tony laughed and extracted himself after a quick kiss,
Tony turned to Steve and signed,
He leant forward until their foreheads touched and he took a deep breath, “I got to a bar and I couldn’t stop thinking about you. Every person I looked at were just so unattractive just because they weren’t you. I love you and the thought of being intimate with anyone who isn’t you just isn’t right. And I know you don’t like sex and I’m perfectly okay with that. Snuggling with you is a thousand times better than a night with a stranger. You’re my everything so don’t feel like you need to sort me out. You are enough.” He allowed their lips to bump together before they kissed properly. He ran his fingers through his partner’s hair, “I should never have agreed to it in the first place.”
Tony realised it was now his time to make his apologises and explain his actions, “I should have thought it through and considered what it would do to you. I regret not doing that… I’m sorry.” His natural instinct had him wanting to make a joke to lighten the mood but he had nearly lost Steve once already so didn’t want to risk it again. He had always been criticised for acting like he had no heart and he was ready to prove everyone wrong.
Steve huffed a laugh, “I know you think that everything I can do is a result of the serum but I was a Captain before the serum. I led a large squad and had a reputation for helping out and doing what I could.” Tony could sense that Steve was glossing over the details of his heroics, “So he thought it would be worth testing the serum on me. Besides, I was a guy who couldn’t exactly say no since the alternative was death by infection. He said that there was a chance the serum could restore my leg but it didn’t... I don’t think he really believed that it could but maybe my belief was all it took to seal the deal.”
The more he dwelt on it, the more it broke his heart but he had to remind himself that it was for the benefit of their relationship. Unless... Tony found someone else out there who could give him everything the man craved. Steve could become obsolete.
"The Genetic Mutations conference? 2 - no, 3 years ago?" He suggested with a smile. His brain was doing that thing which Steve was relying on: filling in details or creating false facts to fit the evidence, "Of course, I remember you!"
Passing it over, Steve pulled himself out of the bed so he could sit on the edge. It felt somewhat intimate to be in a room with Tony while he was topless. He silently thanked the Lord that he’d chosen to wear pyjama pants to bed tonight as he often didn’t.
He moved back to again holler up to the empty window when a familiar voice stopped him.
Clint threw his arms in the air exasperatedly, "He's a master assassin! Did you really think you could just leave him in a room alone? You know how stubborn he is!"
He had to act fast.
“What’s wrong?” Tony asked while handing him his jacket and buckling up his own belt. He could sense Steve was already retreating back into his head where he would panic about what had just happened and their relationship. He didn’t know what they were but he knew that he wanted something more.
What happened when Clint had tried to assassinate Steve Rogers...
The assassin slid down and pulled the blanket up. Tony couldn't help grinning as he left to find where he'd put the man's painkillers.
He couldn’t understand why he was feeling so down as he loved his job, his colleagues and helping the citizens of New York. The other detectives were all at their desks or in the small kitchen area chatting before they got down to work. He could feel Steve’s absence and he knew that everyone else could too despite his senses being especially heightened toward the missing detective.
Now it was Tony’s turn to cry as he leant in and kissed Steve. He held the man gently to avoid touching his battered body but the kiss transferred all the emotion Tony couldn’t say and didn’t even know how to begin describing.
Steve returned the file to the other man’s desk but didn’t place a response. He wanted to see how confident Stark was about Steve definitely turning up. Would the man still go without a definite answer or skip the event?
"Look, Clint isn't exactly well known for coming up with inventive phone passwords and I'm calling because you said you didn't know who I am."
“Good afternoon, Deputy Rogers.” Tony smiled while giving a lazy salute in his partner’s general direction.
“So that is fine in times of need but not to leave the head space?” Tony summarised whilst scratching his beard.
“Yep.” He chuckled.
Tony had to blink a couple of times as he followed Steve’s signs; in the man’s frustration he was accidentally signing faster and faster. It dawned on Tony for the first time that Steve had been slowing down his ASL. He probably didn’t need to do that now Tony knew it pretty well but the sudden pace change gave him whiplash.
Steve felt a squeeze around his hand just before they walked through the door which caused him to peer across gratefully to his partner. They smiled before dropping hands and entering the room. Today wasn’t the day to reveal their relationship when it was all so new.
He opened his eyes when he felt Steve’s lips pressing against his. The kisses were less frantic and desperate but had instead become gentle and fond. He felt Steve card his fingers through Tony’s short hair and it sent a gentle shiver down his spine.
"I can't do it." Natasha leant forward, her chair squeaking as she moved, "I've already been given a mission and besides you'd probably need a specialist for this."
“It’ll be okay. You can get through this.” Tony offered even though he knew that the words would mean nothing.
“Tony pretended to arrest me in front of a room full of people.” Steve mumbled out as he tried to dry off his shirt even though it was unsalvageable. She frowned in confusion, “It was an abuse of power and humiliating.”
Steve had felt like he’d trapped Tony in their relationship as he hadn’t felt comfortable to disclose his asexuality until they’d been talking for a few weeks and were on a date. He felt this especially since Tony had always had such a playboy reputation so he clearly craved and needed sex. It was integral to his character. He’d seen the papers and blog posts about the man pre-their relationship and didn’t want him to have to change for him.
Steve, however, was faster thanks to his new prosthetic and managed to catch the Tony by the elevator. He grabbed the man’s hand and pulled him back towards the bedroom as he placed luscious kisses on his lips. Tony went willingly as Steve’s mouth put him into a trance.
Tony smiled and rested his head against Steve’s shoulder while watching him sign.
"Clint seems to think you can hold your own. Says you're the best in the business."
Already regretting his brains inability to keep quiet, Tony lowered his head to prevent Steve from getting a good look at his face, “When I asked for your name you said ‘Just Steve’... it was a joke.”
The mock look of offence was almost realistic but Clint couldn’t sustain it and laughed, “I hear wedding bells.”
The touch, his smile and purred words went to Tony’s head as the criminal said, “I’m especially pleased that you could make it. It’s always a pleasure, Detective.”
The static sound of the microphone being turned on caused Tony’s heart to drop; why did they even allow Clint to be best man? Mostly because he and Steve had agreed that Bruce would not want to give a speech and Thor would be himself and nobody would understand his Asgardian references. That left Natasha or Clint and the former had claimed head bridesmaid.
“Did you not hear what I just said?” Steve ran his fingers through his hair and flopped back against the couch wearily.
“Are you trying to say I can’t do my job properly?”
“Clint was clearly right. You really don't know me at all.”
His assailant was running as fast as his legs could carry him but had significantly underestimated how well Steve could deal with a simple bullet to the shoulder and blood loss. He didn't realise Steve would be instantly burning for revenge.
The soldier sat opposite Tony but turned his chair to face the area where Fury would be talking to avoid eye contact. Miscommunication was running rampant as Steve thought Tony pitied him for his leg and Tony thought that Steve was just being a cold ass despite his attempts to help him.
“Aw, shucks. I should have known you’d side with him.” With a sigh he pushed off the boxes and knelt down to begin clearing up his mess until Natasha placed her boot on a document he was collecting up.
The doctor sighed, “It wasn’t going to.”
It was a week later when Steve felt his cell phone vibrating against his thigh. He cursed it silently before dropping his gun and slipping the cell out of his deep pocket. His eyebrow raised slightly at the number he didn't really recognize and, shuffling along the floor in his crouching position, slipped further into the darkness of the alley to answer it.
The nurse left after checking his vital signs and explaining everything she was doing all the way through. As she talked him though each of his injuries she didn’t draw attention to the constant tears. She placed a button in Steve’s hand and told him to press it if he needed her. He nodded gratefully.
Steve took the cup and stood for a moment. The silence encouraged the awkward tension between them until the mob boss finally said, “Okay then... Thanks for the coffee, Marvin.” The tall man spared a glance for the name tag. He turned and was gone in seconds, the ringing of the bell over the door was the only thing that proved that Steve had even been there.
"Of course I could if I wanted. Easy enough but it's safer for him to remain hidden so I'm not risking his life simply to drag him back here just because you have a thing for him."
Steve gets called to Shield base and meets the Avengers for the first time.
As he was peering at the bedside table, he hadn't notice the bedroom door silently swing open. The fellow assassin stood their assessing the injured man's actions. Clint was so oblivious to him that the sudden appearance of a voice made him jump.
Grinning, Stark answered, “Yeah, and I like kissing you too. But seriously you’ll have to tell me what you’re okay with since I don’t want you to ever feel uncomfortable around me.”
“And I do?!” He stood up to his full height and peered down at the other man.
In chapter 2, Tony hinted at an argument the boys had had where Steve turned the lights off to stop it. Here it is!
He had only just received his drink when a figure appeared beside him. Usually he would wave off anyone approaching him when he had only just arrived but tonight he felt like letting loose and didn’t want to do that alone. His new companion seemed happy to dance too. With each sip of his drink, he could feel the tight muscles that had been contracting across his shoulders gently releasing.
Steve didn’t remember falling asleep but he did remember the pain starting to ebb around the time that the sky was transforming itself into a faint orange. He blinked awake but his eyes felt heavy and he fought to keep them open. His clock beside his bed read 7:34 and he cursed his internal body clock for being so consistent. He could do with a couple more hours of sleep after the trauma of the night before.
When you’re growing up, you’re told that you’ll find a partner, get married, have babies and live happily every after. Nobody seems interested in all the complexities that come in between. However, Tony and Steve were beginning to find out how complex it can be but maybe they’ll find their own solutions.
Steve barely looked up at him when he left. Sighing, Steve was ashamed of himself for acting this way but he could practically see Stark’s thoughts forming. He knew that the man was only trying to be nice to him because he felt sorry for the poor cripple who needed help. Steve threw the newspaper aside despite its innocence in the situation. One thing he knew was that Stark hated him 24 hours ago but now is acting differently due to him being perceived as an invalid and Steve couldn’t accept that.
The backpacks were heavy on their backs, stocked with supplies and water. Steve could hear that further back in the unit someone’s pack was making a slight noise that echoed each step. It distracted him for a moment; perhaps it was a button colliding with a tin mug strapped to the outside of the bag to save room, maybe it was the dog tags of a fallen soldier clicking against others man’s on his chest. Steve shook his head and forced himself to concentrate but it was hard in the heat of summer with sweat dripping down his spine. Perhaps if he had had a better night’s sleep or drank more water today then it wouldn’t have happened but whatever led him to the mine must have had a plan for him. Maybe, one day, he’d even call it destiny.
“Just Steve.” The man answered and moved again to join the queue of people waiting for their drinks.
"You clearly don't know the first thing about him! Or assassins in general!" The blond man ran his fingers through his hair causing it to spike up. "Captain is stubborn and fatally independent while assassins are the sneakiest and most deceptive bastards you can ever meet!"
The soldier frowned at the man, “Break what?”
Scenarios began to flash in from of his eyes: Steve could be lying bleeding on the floor or collapsed in the shower. Panic raised up as Tony began considering more possibilities: He could have been kidnapped by someone wanting revenge or being murdered by them right now. With that in mind, he swiftly opened the unlocked door and burst into the room. Belatedly realising that he was definitely defenceless.
He jabbed a finger in Tony’s direction before turning on his heels and marching over the the light switches.
Tony’s shoulders sagged low as he breathed out slowly, “I don’t know… It’s Steve.”
Tony got the feeling in his chest that he’d been played which he knew was almost certain before he entered but nobody like for it to be made so blatant.
The man smiled slightly, “Your reputation precedes you. You don’t think we hear of what happens on the field? No, many talk of Steve Rogers and all you’ve accomplished. Your resistance to this infection and all your sickness before display your body’s strength and preservation. We need a leader who knows what’s its like to be the little guy. We need you.”
5 years later-
Tony looked up at him but went back to mapping the pale wounds across the man’s body. He didn’t speak to allow Steve to explain.
He moved around the dance floor, swaying and dancing. He span Tony around as the smaller man laughed and grinned. Steve wasn't the best singer but his voice was workable and it made Tony smile which was the main thing.
“Not anything?” He blanched, “Stevie you’re not the type to stop off somewhere after work for a quickie.” The disgusted look on Steve’s face at the word alone was conformation but his cheeks flushed even darker and Sam instantly knew, “Oh man, don’t tell me you didn’t leave work? Oh god, you did it in the precinct.”
Steve blinked slowly at this. He swallowed slowly before realising that it was probably his turn to explain, “I’ve always slept naked. It’s just more comfortable.” His statement fell awkwardly between them.
It took Steve's mind a second to click who's it was before he released his statement, "And yet you're still here." It wasn't delivered as fiery as he'd wanted as his throat was dry and sore. The other person huffed a laugh despite it.
"What the fuck! Are you okay? What was that?" Tony rambled out, shocked at the piercing sound of gunfire. The genius had only ever associated that noise with bad news, following which he'd usually have to run away. There was a slight sound of quick movement on Steve's end.
Despite not seeing the other man’s face, Tony could hear the laugh in his voice. It would have been almost undetectable if Tony wasn’t so familiar with his voice from so many interrogations, “We actually run a charity here. We offer work to down-on-their-luck civilians and veterans. It’s mostly just making little things that then get sold to pay their wages and keep them afloat until they can get established somewhere else. It gives them wages, good references and a reason to get up every morning.” They made it to the floor where tens of men and women were sat at the tables making anything and everything from lamp shades to baskets. Steve glanced at the Detective solemnly, “A program like this would have really helped me a lot when I first came out of the military.”
“Do you need a doctor then?”
The men wrapped up their conversation and left the room leaving Steve ducking out of sight. Slowly he rose and clicked his back from the awkward angle. He sighed and continued sifting through the files he had been browsing. He knew Detective Stark had a reputation for sleeping around and being a ladies man but he didn’t realise he liked men too. Steve worried that it was because people viewed him as being old fashioned and conservative that prevented Stark from divulging this. He always felt out of the loop when they all did fun things or hung out together. He was always unaware of them doing things until he saw them posting about it on social media during the night. Even though he only had a close relationship with Natasha he wished they included him more. The thought that his team didn’t actually like him broke his heart slightly.
"Of course, let me just grab my notebook.” He said to gain some more time.
"What's up? What's got you so riled up?" Stark's natural curiosity bubbling to the surface.
Smiling, the hero replied, "It's not too bad when I'm caught in it with you."
It must have been the loud flash of thunder that caused Steve to bolt upright in bed with his heart racing at 10 times it’s usual pace. The darkness surrounded him closely making his panic intensify and the loud crashing of the storm outside didn’t help the situation. The pitch black drew him unwillingly back to the war zone where the silence of night always felt ominous and foreboding as though they were merely waiting for attack. Blinking rapidly, the ex-soldier frantically attempted to fight the draw of a flashback.
“You’ve really fallen for him.” She commented, softly knowing that this was information that Steve had probably been subconsciously denying for weeks.
Sitting on his bed, he peered down at his prosthetic leg as anger bubbled up in him. He balled his fist up and struck the metal which caused a cracking sound from the device. Steve had always wanted to do more, be more, help more but his amputation had taken him out from the field where he fought amongst his men. He’d been given the serum and bumped up to super soldier and never saw his team again. He didn’t even know if they were still alive. Maybe Stark was right, without the serum he would have been dead years ago from a surgery caused infection, nothing heroic. It was then that he reaffirmed that he would never claim the label of a hero.
"Welcome, Doctor. Enjoy your night here at Wright laboratories." The man opened the door to grant the guest access.
Steve’s eyes followed the lines in between the floor tiles as he answered, “I guess it’s not so bad. Out of everyone I don’t mind that it was you.”
The voice spoke again, "Do you really not know who I am?" When Steve again didn't comment the caller sighed, "Didn't you ever get taught that a conversation has to involve two people? Unless you want to get carted off to an insane asylum for talking to yourself... it's Stark. Tony Stark... Iron man from the Avengers."
“What are you doing here?” Steve asked.
The director left the room with the others following quickly. Steve, the last to leave, turned and gave an unsure wave to the scientists remaining in the room. He signed,
He stepped back to allow Tony entrance and followed the man through to the small apartment living room. While Steve apologised for the mess and began to shuffle together the papers, Tony was trying to put into a percentage just how much tidier Steve’s apartment was than his.  He tried to figure out what their age gap was because his apartment looked more like a college student’s den than an actual adult’s home like Steve’s; there was even a real plant on the window ledge.
"We need your help." He stated plain and simple. Not beating around the bush nor any bells and whistles. Steve had a logical brain; he fed off facts, "I would have been here sooner but you're a hard man to find."
The billionaire jumped when Steve finally spoke as he didn’t know the man had woken up yet, “It was a mine.”
Unsure of what was happening, Steve stood blankly in his bedroom as Tony hurried around the room whilst he assembled extra blankets and pillows until the bed looked not too dissimilar from a nest. Finally he placed the candle on Steve’s bedside table and instructed the man to climb back into bed which the soldier did obediently. Moments later, the genius sat down on the other side of the bed; he was sat up leaning against the headboard and his science journal on his lap but he peered down at the other man.
The clouds had dumped the worst of the rain in the 10 minutes they were running and the sun was now beginning to win over. The two men stepped back out to the street.
They walked home hand in hand while their conversation kept them distracted from the sodden shirts and drops dripping down their faces.
Barton squinted suspiciously. He inspected the man as though he could sense malice from the surface. He didn't speak for a few moments but Cap seemed happy enough to allow him to roam his body. He sure knew what it was like to just need to fully figure someone out.
Steve peered down at his lap for a moment and swallowed thickly. For a brief moment Tony thought he’d screwed it all up and had missed his only chance with Steve but suddenly the man looked up at him and grabbed his hand.
That night, he slept easier than he had in weeks. However, little did he know that within a handful of months he’d end up under the ice and have to endure the longest sleep of his life.
"Why do you use a gun?" The voice asked.
“You really shouldn’t make excuses for him.” He murmured but Natasha could tell he was already considering her point of view. He rubbed his fingertips across his lips as he thought.
Still grasping Tony's hand, Steve led them through the streets in the direction of their sanctuary: the tower.
"How did you get my number and why are you calling me, Mr Stark?" He whispered back, voice as cold as ice. He'd been promised by Clint and Shield that nobody outside of those he'd confirmed would have access to his cell number. He wanted to avoid situations like this exact one.
“I am so sorry! I promise it won’t-“ He got interrupted by Tony’s mouth on his.
Steve slunk through to his lounge and dumped himself down on the couch. Wilson perched nearby to continue prying like a good friend should. The detective rubbed his hands over his face wearily.
“It-It wasn’t me.” The man declared in an attempt to fix the damage done to his rapidly decreasing reputation. “I didn’t do anything.”
Natasha touched his arm, “Get him to medical immediately. I think he’s still breathing!”
“Detective.” Tony greeted stonily as he passed her to reach the coffee pot. He’d been trying out the new technique of acting as she did towards him until she was forced to break her icy exterior and be friendly towards him. So far, 5 weeks in, it had gone largely unnoticed by her. “How is detective Rogers?”
“Grow up will you, Stark.” Steve huffed, wishing he had never brought up a subject which allowed Stark to go on a boasting spree. As if his ego needed boosting any more.
The younger man's lips curled slightly in the corners at the obscure reference. Even Steve, someone who tends to avoid too much tv, could understand that. He slurped at the water until the cup was nearly empty and he could feel the life being returned to his throat. He had the energy to appreciate that Stark understood Frankenstein to be the scientist though, not the creature.
He was mulling over the lack of danger in the room when his eyes fell upon Steve sprawled, on his stomach, on his large king size bed completely naked. Tony blinked rapidly, realising that this was the very first time he’d seen his crush completely without clothes and he definitely wasn’t disappointed. He blinked a couple more times before snapping himself out of the trance and running over to the man to check he was actually breathing. The man was littered with bruises and scratches so there was nothing to prove he was still alive. He held his cheek close to Steve’s mouth until he could feel gentle breath. Relieved, he nodded and backed away. He closed the door gently, ensuring that the click of the door handle wouldn’t wake the man.
The conversation had risen, fallen and collapsed into nothingness repeatedly. It was only a couple of days since Tony had upset Steve in the club and hadn’t yet managed to form an apology for the unintentional hurt he had caused. Rogers, while liking to think of himself as the bigger man, hadn’t even attempted to engage in any of the conversation Stark desperately attempted. He was happy to boil in his own pile of misery while peering out the window of the car aimlessly.
Tony blanched, “Steve?!” for some reason, he had never expected Detective Rogers to be the type of man to be proficient in evasive driving like that. He began to argue again the man but Steve raised a hand to silence him.
However, Tony must have moved slowly as the sudden hand in his check made Steve startle. He wasn’t ready when the lips gently touched his but quickly, his brain caught up and he leant towards the other man to deepen their kiss. The short, dark hair felt so soft against Steve’s large hands. The taller man hummed in contentment as he’d wanted to kiss Tony since the first day they met and he’d been incredibly nervous leading up to their first date.
Steve didn’t have to answer. He just slipped his thigh back into his leg and stood up.
"That one time you tried to kill me." Steve finished neutrally.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t think-“ Tony started but as soon as the phrase ‘didn’t think’ slipped out Steve was furious.
"How did you do it?" Steve had only just placed the cell to his ear when an unfortunately familiar voice burst out. "I've been trying to figure it out for days. The autopsy came back clear but there wasn't a single mark on him." Stark barely breathed as he enthused rapidly.
“Impossible.” Rogers muttered against the other man’s lips. The taste of beer was still dancing across Tony’s lips. He leaned in to deepen the kiss again but Tony’s witty mind was interrupting Steve’s intention.
Suddenly, the man began to turn as though to check on the supposedly sleeping genius so Tony allowed his head to drop and opened his mouth just a touch; he’d been reliably informed by many bed partner’s that he slept with his mouth open. There was a moment of silence as Steve must have been looking across at him but it dissipated quickly as Steve continued dressing. He had to perch on the edge of the bed to get his pants on but was gentle to ensure he didn’t wake up the secretly-awake man.
He was in pain but he didn’t feel much different physically. The fog in his brain made it harder for him to work out what had happened and the men on beds either side of him were both asleep and not a nurse in sight. He swallowed thickly but his dry throat made the action uncomfortable.
Somewhere over the last two days, Tony had had the violent epiphany that he was not made for the barista lifestyle; he’d burnt himself more times than he could count, got orders mixed up and even tripped and thrown close to boiling water over his boss. Luckily for him, being a barista didn’t have to be his calling but it was the calling of his fake identity, Marvin Short, and he’d donned glasses, worn a wig and shaved his goatee especially. Hopefully, the burns and general fuck ups wouldn’t give away his total inadequacy.
"Natasha? She can't do it."
Stark's 180 was so suddenly he could have received whiplash and, despite his desperate attempts not to, his face blushed red. The man began to stammer and stutter as he headed off towards the coffee machine to pour himself a cup and more intentionally avoid eye contact with a master spy.
“Good night, Tony.” The tired man murmured back as sleep began calling to him again.
“That’s on a need to know basis and guess what, you really don’t need to know.” He mumbled.
“You guys should unionize. Get better conditions than this literal mouldy cellar.” He joked but Romanoff didn’t laugh or even react to him speaking.
The blond man then left. He packed his things from Tony’s room and left the tower. The genius didn’t try to stop him or convince him otherwise; he could see that Steve had been hurt one too many times to just throw out a promise he didn’t know if he could keep. He wouldn’t ask for the man back until he could be certain he could stand by it.
It was getting close to the time and Barton was beginning to get mildly anxious. No matter how much he trusted Steve there was always the risk that the assassin had decided against helping Shield.
“I’m not… We’re not... Anything.”  The detective stuttered, uselessly. He’d known Sam since back in his army days and never once had he ever been able to slip a lie past him.
—————
"S? Your real name starts with an S?" He cried out in excitement, ignoring the sighs coming from across the line, "Does Clint know it?"
Rogers blinked and slowly rose from his seat with his arms placed defiantly on the desk in front of him; the pose made the muscles in his shoulders and upper arms stand out. His chair squealed along the tiled floor as he moved it back with his legs. The detective peered into the other’s eyes.
, Tony signed as he sighed. They both flopped down on the couch,
Grinning, Stark resisted the urge to slap the man’s ass.
Tony spoke up cautiously, unsure whether the man was dead or unconscious, "Is that Professor Wright?"
If someone was to ask how they got here they probably wouldn’t be able to narrate the whirlwind romance that had swept them up. Now here they were waking up together in Stark’s unnecessarily large bed in his unnecessarily large penthouse. The genius had an arm wrapped around his still sleeping partner. He gazed down at the man with a smile, thinking about how the last month had completely changed his life.
Tony raised an eyebrow and had to wonder whether it could be considered normal to get slightly turned on by such an image. There was no denying Steve was a good-looking man but his body had never had such an instinctual response to something the other man had said before. The detective sighed and realised he didn’t have time for any of this, especially contemplating his sudden attraction to his colleague.
Natasha smirked at the face Stark was pulling as his ego got smashed into tiny, tiny pieces. The genius span his chair around with his mouth open in hope of getting support from the team but they were all chuckling silently. It wasn't very often Tony Stark got told he was irrelevant to someone. His mouth fluttered open and closed desperately.
“Did you just call yourself a ‘good-“ Steve started chuckling when Tony cut him off by capturing his lips in his. Needless to say, no more talking was done for a very long time.
The blond suddenly perked up, “You couldn’t?”
“Bet you weren’t impressed.” She smirked as she crossed her arms and stuck out her hip. Her red hair moved slightly in the breeze of the old fan that Steve had propped up on a wonky shelf. He would comment on the way it made her look like someone from a shampoo commercial but he wasn’t quite sure if their friendship had exceeded that boundary yet. She was hard to read.
Meanwhile, Steve lay sound asleep in his bed after another dose of painkillers to fight back the annoying aching of his shoulder. At least everyone at Shield would be off his back... or so he thought.
The rush hour chaos had passed some time before and by the time the cafe had recovered from the influx of customers it was dark outside. Tony was cleaning up for the night when he began to haul a bag of trash out the back to their industrial sized garbage cans. The door of the cafe clicked closed behind him and he was wielding the bag into the can when a large figure stepped out from the inky darkness.
He could hear the squad squawking around like headless chickens and, while for many of them it was only their first time out, he wanted to believe he’d taught them better. He was about to think it through more when one of the men carrying the stretcher stumbled, despite Steve being light, and a jolt ripped through Steve’s leg. That gave him the first opportunity to identify the area with the most pain even though every single part of his body was on fire. Something had happened to his leg.
“I wanted to go but I don’t know if he’d appreciate my visit… He’s so much better than me.” If being stoic wouldn’t work then he’d have to attempt sharing his feelings and being friendly to her in order to break her cold exterior.
"Cap? It's me, Clint. Look, I know I told you to wait on the Professor Wright thing but Shield are getting impatient. I've looked into it and it really does look like they're up to something so go ahead." The spy had asked Steve to wait before assassinating the man because he wanted to check over the company to ensure it really was evil. Needless to say he found more than enough evidence to prove Shield's point. "Anyway, do it as soon as you're well enough for it. Get better soon."
? Steve mouthed, surprise radiating through his body. He hissed between his gritted teeth when his brain seemed to catch up with the pain in his side. The couch groaned as Steve dumped himself back down. He noticed the mug and cold press that Tony held in his direction. He signed,
She had to physically restrain herself from rolling her eyes, “I’m pretty sure Steve would be more than happy to see you.”
“And my leg?” He asked when the mention of infection reminded him of his new stump.
Her smile tightened her cheeks into little apples,
Steve blinked at the man for a moment, “Are you using your ‘Living with PTSD Seminar’ knowledge about my relationship?”
Tony frowned and looked across at Bruce, “Nobody thought to tell me?!”
The security guard’s desk was empty as the watchman must have been out on patrol. However, Steve had been in agonising pain for nearly 30 minutes and nobody had returned so the man doubted he’d be saved.
Tony coughed, “I’ll just need to... uh, pop in the shower first.”
“Steve, you can’t be serious!” Tony was pacing back and forth at the foot of their large bed. His hair was ruffled from running his fingers through and he looked thoroughly confused. This wasn’t what a person expected to be confronted with within 10 minutes of waking up.
The door she stopped at seemed to appear almost out of nowhere on the wall since they’d been walking such a long stretch with nothing. Natasha took one last distrustful look in Tony’s direction before opening the door and entering.
They had instructions to storm the house at 10 o’clock so were doing recon while their back-up positioned themselves around the corner. Stark would swear that Detective Hill could sense the tension between him and Steve that morning which is why she recommended to the Captain that they co-pilot the raid. Unfortunately, her plan had failed as neither of them were prepared to be in a situation like this together.
Tony could see that Steve was resisting the smile that was trying to wiggle onto his lips. But the man resisted it valiantly.
A short and sweet final chapter: Steve finally tells Tony about how he lost his leg.
Tony smiled back. How could he refuse when he still had so much to make up for?
Clint’s spiel continued for nearly 30 minutes, in which time he had the audience laughing so hard that their sides hurt, crying along with him and falling in love with Steve and Tony all over again. When he wrapped up the room applauded for several minutes and the newly weds were pleased as it allowed them to compose themselves and wipe away their tears.
Her eyes slid up to his, "Well, in that case, you're looking at the handy work of our latest teammate." Natasha folder her arms and leant back in her chair to watch for signs of shock and astonishment which didn't come, "You're not surprised?"
So, out of frustration and a sheer lack of willpower to continue fighting with the device, he had ripped it off and climbed into bed despite the early hour. He was just considering how nice it felt to be free of the prosthetic for a while so he could move his body freely under the sheets when the door suddenly opened and Tony marched in.
Steve was woken up by gentle touches on his abdomen and he blinked his eyes open to peer down at whatever was causing the tickling sensation. He saw Tony’s fingertips ghosting across his skin and paying particular attention to the serum-faded scars that littered his right side in particular. The soldier frowned until he looked down at Tony who was resting his head against Steve’s shoulder and was touching the scars with reverence and curiosity.
"Okay, we have a pulse but barely. We need to get to the nearest hospital stat." The medic instructed again.
“I came round like two hours ago but the house was all locked up. It waited for a while but got pretty soaked through in the rain so used the spare key you gave me. I was starting to worry about you since I know you were supposed to finish three hours ago.” Sam Wilson rushed out to explain.
It was the same as every other fancy event he'd ever snuck into. Dim lights, a posh orchestra and champagne flutes floating around on silver trays carried by staff. Hundreds of people stood around talking and munching delicately on 'nibbles'. He glided between them to further integrate himself in the group. His fingers snagged a glass of champagne as he passed. Pain medication and alcohol were probably a bad idea but there were certain decisions that Steve didn't reflect over. Besides, he’d probably look out of place to wander the function without a drink in hand.
He seemed reluctant to interpret this one to Steve but the soldier encouraged him.
your public need you.
Quickly, Tony’s eyes glanced up and down the corridor to check that they were alone. He stepped closer to his friend to ensure he could keep his voice low. The last thing he wanted was to be overheard by a stranger.
Must be some weird assassin thing because Tony would use his name all the time to just prove he knew it.
“Yeah, exactly.” Stark spread his palms open as though everything had been explained.
Steve chuckled, “We only arranged it with you yesterday.” He gestured to a large leather chair that sat adjacent to the mahogany desk and Tony sat obediently.
“Less talk of the newlyweds and more about this week’s cases!” Captain Fury snapped over the chatter of the room before moving on with the set tasks and started dishing them out.
Then he ran.
. He ensured he mentioned his pride as he could foresee the next question asking if he was going to try and hear.
“I don’t know, Steve… It’s a pretty dangerous call out.”
“Okay, that’s basically a signal transmitter so it gets the leg ready for anything you are about to do and more. Give it a go.” Tony stepped back to give him space to explore.
"You're not." He laughed.
------1 week later
Steve huffed a laugh, "Of course they do but sometimes they want someone reliable. Who they know will do the job. Anyway, I have to go now, Mr Stark. Please do not contact me again."
Steve knew they were there but didn't move more acknowledge them. Director Fury, on the other hand, seemed more than happy for the assassin to just stand there so he could assess him and the immediate vibes he got from the large man. Eventually, Clint coughed in sign for Steve to just turn around already.
“Did you want to take this candle back to your room? The back up generator should be running soon but the storm is tampering with it.” Stark offered.
She led him over to the living room and encouraged him to sit down while never taking her eyes from his clearly distressed face. He continued to dry the droplets of water from his blond hair.
“You’re hard to kiss when you’re happy. Be sad, for me… Just one minute of sadness.” Tony chuckled as he felt Steve’s lips curl up even further.
“So?” Nat encouraged as she flipped through some random files. He eyes scanned the irrelevant information in an impressive display of her acting skills.
Despite the doctor’s uncertainty regarding the re-establishment of his leg, Steve knew he’d jump at any opportunity of potentially getting his leg back and getting back to the war with his men. He’d felt bad leaving them. Besides, he had just been told that his body was still fighting a possible fatal infection so surely his sickly body could use all of the help it could get.
He rushed to his room and threw on his usual ‘going out’ outfit that actually rarely got used and prepared himself for a night in the town. It felt strange heading out on his own as Bucky had accompanied him the last few times but Barnes was on active duty again now so Steve was without a companion. He tried to ignore the seed of anxiety that was planted in his stomach at the idea of being alone in a club or bar as he didn’t want to seem like the lonely weirdo out looking for friends.
Tony's phone buzzed a deep monotone as the assassin hung up on him for the last time. He peered down at his phone almost in shock. Maybe Cap was right, maybe he really didn't know him at all.
They suddenly jumped as the silence of the room was harshly disrupted by the nurse bustling in with his latest dose of pain killers. His bright smile and conversation dissipated the heavy atmosphere of the room and allowed Steve to shake off these bizarre thoughts about his co-worker and place them, once again, to the back of his mind.
Tony touched his arm and Steve looked over at the man. He signed,
He snuck in the front door and luckily didn't run into any familiar faces but he still had 3 flights of stairs to climb so wasn't getting his hopes up yet. He'd been pretending to work of the military (which he did used to) but said he was more a paper pusher than a fighter (which wasn't and isn't true).
The taller man grasped the other’s hair to guide their lips back together. Their teeth clashed as they rushed to get closer and deepen the kiss.
There was a few moments of silence until Tony burst out, "Well, I like him. Can we keep him?"
Tony's eyes darted back and forth between Natasha and the words for a couple of moments before asking outright, "And this is so terrible because?"
Detective Stark picked up on the sudden change of attitude half way through the sentence and suddenly realised that Steve, as a social workaholic, definitely didn’t benefit from been cooped up all day with nothing to do. He was a man of action and do-gooding not a couch potato.
“You were in the briefing with us, Nat. Of course you know.” He sighed, turning his back to lean against the towers of dusty boxes. He didn’t even care that the dust would leave a mark on his freshly ironed shirt.
“I’ll call a medic when we get up.” Stark murmured, as he’d never seen someone in so much pain. They hadn’t been on a mission in almost a week and it was the middle of the night so the genius couldn’t figure out who or what had hurt the soldier. What he did know though was that something inside him wanted to crush whatever had hurt him.
They met eyes and smirked, “Looks as though you’re right, Stark.”
The quick pick up at SHIELD ended up being significantly longer than he'd anticipated but for the better as word had gotten around that Iron Man was on a mission and someone had procured him a high speed jet. It allowed them to reach Delaware twice as fast but that still wasn't fast enough for Stark.
Stark’s cheeky smirk only increased, “Did your mom not raise you with manners?” He shouted to be heard over the music, “It’s rude not to say hi when you bump into someone you know or were you a little occupied elsewhere?!” His eyes ghosted suggestively across to Steve’s dance partner.
He raised his left hand in the air and flashed the band of metal in the harsh light of the precinct. With a smirk carrying through his tone, he called back to his friend, “I think it works both ways...Nobody thought I’d manage to bag a respectable man like Steve!”
"Wha? Noo. There's blood everywh-" His sentence dipped off suddenly as he dipped in and out of consciousness.
“Why did he arrest you?” She desperately needed some clarification.
The trees around them rustled in the light summer breeze which, while pleasant against his warm cheek, made it harder to listen out for enemies nearby. His unit followed closely, copying his lead. He had successfully navigated the majority of this French forest without being spotted or fired at which meant that he was counting the mission as 99% completed. Just the last stretch before they are in the clear which led to their camp. He could almost taste the cots and fires around the corner.
Tony knelt in front of him similarly to how he did a week before. From such close proximity to the man’s perfect body the inventor could see the scars ranging in size littering the torso. Lifting the man’s pant leg, he rolled it up until he had full access to Steve’s amputation site but he could tell by the way Steve clenched his fist that the man felt vulnerable being so exposed. Tony rested his hand on the other knee to reassure him of his purely good intentions. Hadn’t Steve learnt by now that something about that first night tonight had changed the way they viewed each other?
He didn’t remember being moved but when he woke up next he was in a different room and it must have been night as darkness shrouded his surroundings. The soldier, heart beating heavily, peered into the darkness as an uneasy feeling in his subconscious told him that something lurking in the blackness had awoken him. Eyes struggling to adjust, he squinted.
Steve couldn’t hear the man edging forward over the intensity of the pain and only realised the other man’s presence when an uncertain hand touched his shoulder. Unprepared for the contact, Steve jumped in surprise and it triggered a fresh wave of agony that sent him withering on the floor.
Of course Steve knew about mines. They learned about them in basic training and it was difficult to be in the army for even one day without seeing the damage a mine could do. However, all the learning and knowledge behind mines goes completely out of the window when you trigger one.
“I’ve only been on bed rest for a week and a half but by this point, any face would do.” Despite his sarcastic comment a slight smile was beginning to spread across his face. Company was company, “Please, come on in.”
-The next morning-
“How am I supposed to know what he expects me to do?” Tony rolled his eyes.
Tony nodded at Steve to confirm that his condition had been met so they followed Nick out towards the media room where they held all of their broadcasts and interviews.
“Mr Rogers,” Stark spat as he braced himself against the table, “We were fine without you. Don’t you think it’s time you retire?”
His shoulder was throbbing as though the bullet was still inside him but he grit his teeth against the pain. He had essentially a vat of morphine in his medical kit for this exact reason.
Clint answered, "He is good. He's the best there is." Slight defensiveness filled his tone, "He's alive but taking time to recover, we think. We know he's definitely alive as we were taking care of him for the first few days but Cap can be elusive when he wants to be. And we didn't tell you because you would have insisted we bring him here and he would have rather died."
“It should do. The chip is reading all the signals your leg would have received and is relaying them to the prosthetic so it moves exactly how you remember.” Tony shrugged from where he was watching it all unfold. He’d never particularly liked Steve Rogers so if you had told him 6 months ago that he would spend days working on a prosthetic for the man then he would have called you a liar. Somewhere and somehow between then and now, his opinion of the soldier had completely flipped. He could identify with the man’s pain and his struggle with his prosthetics as Tony had had issues with the Arch reactor several times before.
Steve’s eyebrows rose as Tony placed his hands under the leg with the gentlest touch Steve had ever witnessed from the man. With only a guiding force, Tony turned Steve’s leg slightly to the side so he could take a look at the mechanics which allowed the joint to bend when the man walked. He bent the leg and easily saw that it was overly stiff so the function that sprang the leg back was broken or hadn’t been adequately repaired.
He wasn’t focused enough to try and not look pathetic when he scurried over to the low light of the candle and get as close as he could. Once he was situated by the light source he could feel the nightmares of the war drift further away and he could try to respond to Stark as a normal person.
However, Clint didn't join in. Instead he looked stone eyed across at his long-time friend and slowed the dark car to a stop by the side of the road. He sighed, a hand reaching up the rub at his temple. Steve squinted suspiciously.
Every single head in the briefing room snapped around to stare at the confessing detective. It may not have been a confession over the leaked information but it certainly was a nugget of information that many of the employees in the room found more interesting. Under the weight if their gaze Steve lowered his head so his gaze could follow the gaps in between the tiles. He wasn’t ready to see the judgement in their eyes. He thought he already knew what he’d see: disappointment and disgust at the precinct’s most successful detective being homosexual.
Hopefully, their argument wouldn’t jeopardise the team.
The other man paused in his pacing to throw a disgusted look at Steve. He spoke after only a heartbeat though, “You’re being irrational. I don’t need sex, Steve. I need to be here with you.”
“Why you?” Tony asked, his voice was uncharacteristically subdued.
He then spoke. He knew Steve couldn’t hear it but wanted to get his thoughts out there without judgement or potentially scaring Steve away.
Despite what the others kept suggesting, Tony had actually fully realised his feelings towards Rogers had developed beyond mere friends. He wasn’t as emotionally stunted as they all believed. Stark lifted his fist until it was only millimetres away from the wood of the door but he couldn’t bring himself to knock. They’d been back from the mission for over an hour now and Steve had occupied Tony’s mind for every second of that. The Captain had sustained some hard blows and, from where he was watching from the relative safety of the suit, Tony knew the man would be left pretty beaten up. It took every fibre to his being to stop himself running straight to Steve’s room as soon as he was out of the suit.
Steve lays down his boundaries but ends up feeling guilty and self-conscious of his sexuality. A lack of communication leads Tony to do something he doesn’t want to do. They’ll quickly learn the value of communication.
"Watch out, Mr Stark, if you head gets much bigger-," A loud shot suddenly echoed down the phone line making the genius jump, "It'll put strain on your neck."
“Shut up, Stark. Where were you, Rogers?”
“We agreed to meet somewhere for drinks and he was-“ He started.
“Is it really a good idea to put me and Stark together on this one? I heard Romanov had something she wanted help with and I really feel I’d be more suited for that.”
He continued typing then peered up again when a detail of the case (It happened to be the criminal’s red car) made him think back to that moment where he was taken completely by surprise. Detective Stark frowned when he noticed Steve had disappeared but his belongings were still scattered around his desk. He shrugged it off and forced himself to stare at the screen until the case was completely written up. It was going well until five minutes later he realized he needed the file of a similar case they did last year. He sighed and headed towards the file room.
The inventor placed a suspiciously-leg-looking device on the end of Steve’s bed and stepped back.
The soldier stood and Tony followed his motion. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a patch that didn’t look much bigger than a postage stamp. After peeling the backing off, Tony reaches up to position the sticky patch behind Steve’s right ear. His hand lingered there for a moment as their eyes met again. Steve’s heart began to race.
Steve huffed out a breath and looked helplessly around the room,
When the fireworks started some time later everyone joined them on the balcony but the men continued grasping onto each other tightly and they knew that they’d never want to let go.
"What the hell was what?" Wind whipped past the receiver as he began to run full speed away from the murder scene. If he hadn't been an idiot and left his silencer in America then it wouldn't have been such a speedy get away.
As a result of their surveillance, neither were particularly surprised when the first obese drop tumbled from the heavens to land only yards from their feet. They shared a look that was interrupted by a further droplet landing directly on Tony's forehead which shocked them both. Steve laughed at the indignation expression plastered on the billionaire's face.
He snatched up the phone and answered before his mind could keep track enough to preplan his speech, "The genius Tony Stark speaking?" He'd meant it humorously but his tone had definitely not conveyed that intention and he was partly glad when he heard the slurred, slow response.
"But then, how did you and Clint meet?" Stark piped up, looking suspicious.
Clint burst out from somewhere at the back, “Who’d have thought someone would actually have the ability to tame Stark!” The room vibrated with the chuckling of the crew and Tony couldn’t help but smirk. It felt good to be back.
The old man tried to run but Steve was quickly on his tail. A thug aimed for Steve to stop his pursuit but Tony shot at his arm causing the man to drop the gun. This allowed the taller detective to grab the drug lord and handcuff him in mere seconds. Once the commotion was over the two boys peered around the bar and suddenly Stark scoffed a laugh.
The detective sighed and prepared himself for what he knew would be a huge series of questions.
"Careful, if you inflate your ego much more your head won't fit it out that door." Voice still rasping, he joked on. In inclined his head towards the door. "Can I have some water?"
-The next day-
The work he was putting into regaining his ability to walk kept him busy in the day but nighttime was completely different.
“It’s just so strange. I never do this kind of thing.” He blushed.
Creeping up the stairs, he moved silently but with efficient speed until he met the only lit window; it wasn't exactly bizarre that it was alone as it was past 3am. He peered inside and haltered. The room was small but definitely didn't look as he'd been picturing inside his head for an apparent assassin. A small couch and coffee table sat in front of a small television which was positioned beside a large bookcase stuffed with novels. A baseball cap, sporting the local teams colors, was hooked over the top edge of the case. There must have been a mistake.
Tony smirked and stated with a wink, “Nice to know I have this effect on you. Can come in handy…” He trailed off suggestive and Steve immediately knew he’d gotten himself in trouble with this one.
Clint gave a huff, "I always said he was good." The spy undoubtedly knew that Steve only dumped the body here as a slight fuck you to Shield and their pushy demands. He'd slipped in undiscovered while hauling around a body. If that didn't give cause for Shield to up their security then what would?
"If you're dead I'm going to find a way to bring you back to life so I can kill you." Stark huffed under his breath after he broke down the door and rushed inside. He was quickly followed but the medic who was instantly on Captain searching for a pulse.
Steve shivered as he felt Tony’s breath ghosting over the sensitive skin in a tempting taster of what was to come. He didn’t have to wait long as the man grasped tightly onto the base of Steve dick making him suddenly gasp. The genius’ other hand massaged firm circled into the man’s scarred thigh just above the amputation site to encourage him.
"And yet you travel around the world hundreds of times a year and interact with thousands of people." He defied his logic.
The shorter detective lowered his mouth further down until his lips brushed the base of the shaft, taking the whole of Steve’s impressive size into his mouth before humming encouragingly. His own member was pressing up with increasing discomfort as Steve’s reactions were doing all sorts to the heat in his lower stomach.
He was back at Shield in under an hour and so far, nobody had even glanced at him twice.
"Any word from our assassin?" Fury demanded, impatience leaking from every pour.
Steve smiled and nodded before burying his head into the crook of his partner’s neck. He was too sleepy to plough through a conversation right now. They hadn’t exactly slept much since being together.
It was only 20 minutes later that Tony emerged from the bedroom, his suit from the night before was creased as he’d not taken it off and he looked pretty disheveled from being up most of the night. He paced over the where Steve was sat at a table with a newspaper in front of him.
-soon after-
Google didn’t exist when Steve Rogers was growing up so he never had the opportunity to google whether he was normal or not. If he’d had someone there to guide him a little bit better in the sexuality department then maybe he would have felt a lot different about himself. Luckily, a certain Tony Stark might be exactly the person he’s looking for.
The sound of a car being launched through the air and crashing into a building broke the air around them and they snapped apart.
Steve slapped away his hand and bitterly spat, “Stark, I’m fine. Don’t start acting like you care now.” Shakily, with Natasha’s hands supporting him, Rogers pushed himself up onto his feet whilst leaning heavily against the wall. Tony peered up at him from where he was still kneeling on the floor, unsure of how he could ever make this right.
It was the sheer frustration of not knowing that forced Stark’s eyes open and he had to lift his head a fraction to see the other man. An eyebrow raised as he was confronted with a sight he wasn’t particularly prepared for:
“You don’t need to.” Tony answered, he was accidentally displaying his softer and more vulnerable side again, “Anyways, that’s all I wanted to give you. I’ll hit the road so you can get back to bed.”
Eventually, with a slight smirk, Tony reached up and pressed his lips against Steve's. The man responded instantly, pulling Tony impossibly closer and deepening the kiss. He carded his fingers through the short hair and the other responded with a contented moan.
Tony saw the tall blond stumbling to talk so stepped in to defend the man. He didn’t know why he felt the need to help him but something in his core pulled him to intervene, “C’mon, Captain. We all know goodie two shoes would never-“
“What do you want?” The genius huffed.
"When is he going to do it?" He asked, turning straight back to business, "Does your Cap know we are waiting on him? We can't infiltrate the laboratories until Professor Wright has been dealt with."
The soldier fired back quickly while tucking himself back under the blanket, “And I’ll just tell them that you climbed into my bed unprompted.”
Open mouthed and wide eyed, Stark stood stock still staring at Steve’s scarred and damaged stump, “What the fuck. What the fuck? What the fuck?” His eyes flicked between the amputation and the twisted prosthetic leg that lay distorted on the carpeted floor.
Almost as though he knew Tony was his only viable option, Steve sighed and sat down on the curb to began pulling up the leg of his pants, “My leg... they tried to repair the damage from last night but something isn’t right.”
"What?! How did he get past me?" Gobsmacked, Stark began to race towards the elevator. How on earth had the assassin managed to sneak behind him in the 5 minutes he'd left the room? He hadn't even left this floor so the man must have passed through the same room as Tony was in to leave.
"Jarvis? Where in the tower is he?" He asked quickly. Cap was injured so the last thing he needed was to be wandering the tower freely. He could collapse at any moment.
Natasha was in a bad mood. Not only did she have 4 more weeks before the only person she actually liked in this precinct returned from his recovery but also her case had essentially gone belly up as she had wasted so much time following a false lead. It wasn’t easy to make Natasha Romanov feel like the fool but these crooks had successfully done so. She directed her scowl at her dark coffee as she leaned against the counter in the break room. Little did she know her day was about to be made significantly brighter by hearing a single piece of information.
“No!” Steve’s hand grabbed the genius’ wrist and, not realising how tightly he squeezed, begged, “Upstairs. Please.”
“Thank you for letting me know all of this.” Tony muttered after their kiss.
Clint had only one thing to say after Tony had spent twenty minutes explaining the situation to him, “You realise that you’re a mug, right?”
Natasha was the first to recognize the man but didn't recoil at the idea. She stepped closer and gently touched his shoulder which caused his graying head to flop forward. Bruce made a sound of confusion and disgust in the back of his throat.
One month later.
“Tony!” A voice hissed in a whisper, “Did you know about it?”
"When you watch him for as long as I have, you'll learn he has a method." But she didn't seem to care how stalkerish that sounded.
The doctor then began to explain his new invention: a super soldier serum. In depth, he explained its potential and what the good doctor hoped it would achieve. There was great stress placed on its restorative abilities and how it will completely transform Steve’s body and remove any trace of the infection currently threatening his life. As the doctor talked Steve drug addled mind slowly grew clearer and he could follow easier.
“We didn’t do ‘it’.” He argued back weakly but by this point Sam had already deduced the sequence of events that had occurred at the office.
He had to consider the possibility of this being a hallucination when he spotted Steve Rogers sat on the couch in a vest and gray sweats. The blond head was resting against the back of the couch and his eyes were closed. Tony’s eyes noticed that the super solider’s arms were clasped around his midsection and would shake when the man groaned. The oversized popsicle was clearly trying to ride out some pain. He was about to turn and leave when he remembered his own remanence of the mission was paining him too and he hadn’t noticed Steve in the medical bay with the rest of them afterwards.Fury always ensured that Stark got seen to by medical professionals despite his attempt every time to run back to the lab.
The crowd was parting to let a small boy through to the front. He must have only been 8 or 9 but was brave enough to come right to the front and stand across from where Steve was sitting. His tiny Captain America costume melted the man’s heart.
A fat raindrop splattered in the corner of his eye as he peered up into the increasingly dark storm clouds. Large puddles spread across the street, constantly rippling from the torrent of water descending from the sky. He hoped it would ease up soon as it was making the butterflies in his stomach increase tenfold. These were not exactly ideal conditions, especially for a newbie.
The man, the file had called him as 'Cap', rolled his eyes but in a jokey manner, "A gun? Why do you use one?"
When he was close enough to the doctor he placed his dark brown satchel beside his leg and gripped the man's hands tightly in a handshake. And the laws of social behaviour meant that the doctor imitated the same action, placing his own bag close to Steve's and grabbing the man’s hand.
“You don’t go doctor?” Tony used rudimentary signals to accompany his words but Steve seemed to understand.
“Anyway, is there a reason you’re visiting?” His blond bangs fell over his forehead as he leant his head in a puppy-dog way, concern making him frown.
“D’you mind a slight detour to the hospital on the way home?” He tried to smile but the ache of his ripped stitches was beginning to wear through the hum of the feel good adrenaline. He internally cringed knowing that his doctor would be less than pleased to find he’d ripped his stitches for the second time in a week and a half. In his defence, what was he supposed to do while at home? A workout only seemed reasonable at the time.
The man came immediately and his hand was almost on the cup when Tony, maybe due to the thrill of being so close to fooling him or maybe due to stupidity, said, “Or maybe I should have called ‘Just Steve’.”
Steve pouted, “Why ruin the fun? Especially when I can think of so many better things to do with your handcuffs.” A mischievous glint flashed in his eyes.
Both men scrambled to pull themselves off the floor and justify their actions but the captain wasn’t having any of their nonsense today. He raised his hands to silence them and with his mouth in a scowl pronounced,
“Come here.” The soldier ordered. Tony obeyed as he climbed onto the bed until he was straddling the thighs of the taller man. He could feel the cool silicone of the prosthetic under his legs but his attention barely noticed it; he was far to distracted. Steve leant up to kiss Tony while his hands removed Tony’s last article of clothing, his shirt, and demanding hands explored the tight form underneath.
It seemed so bizarre to see such a large man, who usually stood over 6 foot and as a solid mass, collapsed on the bed in the dull apartment completely limp. One hand was still splayed over the bullet entrance hole but the life-saving pressure had been released a significant time ago. The man's eyes were closed but, in his unconsciousness, he seemed completely free from pain and worry despite the smears of blood on his handsome face. It had managed to spread everywhere; all over the assassin himself but also the dark bedsheets had been stained with it and a hand print shaped mark decorated the wall.
He was about to close his eyes when he heard a snuffle of a snore from behind him. Turning to face the usually empty side of the bed, he realised that Tony Stark, a man with which he shares a mutual hatred, was sleeping beside him in bed. The soldier frowned slightly until the pain-distorted memories of the night before came filtering back: Tony had helped him up to his room and refused to leave until Steve was asleep. However, it now appeared as though the man had taken on the burden of being babysitter in case Steve needed anything in the night.
Coulson was beginning to look over at them suspiciously so they swiftly closed the fake searching-through-files task and retreated back to their desks. Steve felt like Natasha had so many more questions to ask though so he would probably be called back in the room within the next few hours. As they left, however, a thought arose to the man and he turned to her to ask,
Steve kicked down the door, sending it reeling back into the wall, and they shot inside both shouting, “NYPD! Stay where you are and drop your weapons!”
Tears were threatening again. He rarely took the time to think about what it had been like to be raised deaf in a hearing family and the challenges it brought for them.
That was it. Steve wasn’t about to let this guy get away.  He leapt from the passenger side to run to drive the vehicle, ignoring the stinging pain.
“Late night?” He hypothesised out loud, to which Steve gave him a half-nod half-shrug.
Tony Stark, on the other hand, had become anxious regarding their introductions as Coulson had practically delivered a 35 minute presentation on how Stark could sometimes be an ass (phrased a lot more democratically) and as a result, Tony, offended by Coulson’s comparison between him and Steve, didn’t want Steve involved with the team at all. Besides, Stark had practically been raised on Captain America hero worship from his dad so was just about sick of the man already. As far as he was aware, the man hadn’t done anything to deserve their praise and respect.
"Stark!" She snapped, "Don't do that. I could have killed you!" Which they both knew was not an exaggeration as Natasha always travelled prepared.
Steve could tell someone was in his apartment when he arrived home. He opened the door silently and breathed quietly as he could hear movement from deep within the building. He’d never had anyone break in before but he had heard of other police officers who’d experienced criminals breaking in for revenge. The detective snuck in further and could see a figure in the lit kitchen rummaging through his refrigerator.
“Right,” He spoke to the empty apartment; his voice echoed throughout the dark rooms, “If they won’t invite me then I’ll just have to make fun for myself.”
Steve, on the other hand, wiggled out of his lover’s grasp to instead reach up and switch on the row of lights that still adorned his large kingsize bed. The bulbs released a warm yellow glow that chased away the darkness.
He was contemplating this when he noticed that Steve was beginning to stir so he dropped a kiss on the man’s forehead. It made him think back to the first time he woke Steve up and the man had been so defensive. This time, Steve’s eyelids fluttered open and he smiled.
"Not exactly." Steve muttered as Natasha also spoke.
They both sang the final line together, "I'm the love that you've looked for, write to me, and escape."
A voice called over the speaker with an alarm blaring behind her, "Intruder on floor 3. West wing. Floor 3. Unidentifed male."
The Detective peered back up at the building before shaking his head slightly and beginning the walk back to where he left his car. He knew he had to get back to the station to break down everything that had happened with the team.
"Do you mean blood?" Tony questioned as he desperately tried to get a grip on the situation. "Do you remember exactly where you are?"
They go on their first stake-out together and things turn out differently than either expected.
Opening his mouth several times, he resembled a goldfish as he frantically searched for words, “I can’t.”
Once again the staff laughed. Tony felt a comfortable warmth settle across his chest at the reminder of his friends here in the office. Even though Steve had moved on things didn’t have to change for him. He still had his partner, still had his friends and still had the job he loved. As he lowered his hand the gold band glinted in the light again and he peered down at his hands with a gentle smile. The golden glint contrasting the light brown of his sun darkened fingers.
“WHICH MOTHERFUCKING ASS LEAKED THE PROGRESS OF THE JENSEN CASE?!” The captain’s voice echoed into the room milliseconds before he kicked the door open and strode inside. He slammed his fist down onto the podium and peered around the room, his eye resting on each employee in turn. The accusation was placed against each and every individual in that room without exception, “Let’s start with Stark and Rogers since they were the primary detectives on this case. So, gentlemen?”
“He has to do it. He got hurt in the last mission and the public want to know what has happened to their favorite hero.” The eye-patched man sighed, “He just needs to let them know that he’s made a full recovery and answer a couple of questions.”
“I still don’t see it? He’s always been a ladies man.” He peered after the still slightly swinging door reflectively.
The weapon was instantly hit from his grip sending it on the floor under this assassin's feet. In his mind he cursed himself for jumping blindly in while assuming it was some petty thief behind the wheel. He swore out loud until he noticed the grinning little shit sat behind the wheel.
He was stood in front of the other man was now another dilemma, how to wake a dozing, deaf super solider? Would a tap leave him with a broken arm? He was yet to learn how reactive Steve was when waking up. However, out of desperation, he gently tapped his foot against Steve’s. It worked a charm; the soldier leapt up from the chair, nearly hurtling straight into the smaller man. Only his strong arms stopped Tony, and the items he held, from tumbling to the ground.
Tony flopped down at his desk, the chair wheeling back slightly under the force of his weight, just in time for the start of his shift. As his first day back he wanted to start off on a good footing going forward which he nearly blew by being so close to being late.
“A freak?” Tony cried out, he leapt off the couch to instead kneel in front of Steve. He grabbed his his hands in his, “You’re completely normal! You’re asexual.”
The two men jumped out the car and darted towards the house at full speed. They could hear the van, carrying their back-up, close behind them. Charging the door, Steve led in first and shot into the first room on the right with Stark close behind him.
“Do you miss it... your leg, I mean.”
Clint suddenly burst out laughing and Tony couldn’t have been more angry. The inventor continued, “Don’t you dare laugh at him!”
Steve turned his head and leant it to the side,
On the flight he got everyone on board up to speed with what had happened. The medic had looked concerned at the news while Natasha merely rolled her eyes at Steve's antics; Surely he should be at least trying not to die while he has the whole of America relying on him. He could do it later.
He leant against the door frame, "But you're clearly more proficient with a bow. Surely you get that it's pointless to put yourself at a disadvantage just because it's 'what you're supposed to use'." He placed air quotes around the final words.
“What have I done?” He demanded, steeling himself.
“I have to do my job. I’m a good detective so I will get you.”
“How’d it happen?” Leaning his head, he looked like a puppy as he enquired.
Steve rose and peered down at his lover,
Tony made a sound of surprise, “I didn’t know you still had them.”
He’d always though that he knew Steve Rogers. He’d practically been raised on Captain America stories as a kid and had glamorised the man his whole life. How had his father not mentioned that Steve was an amputee? He was missing close to his whole leg and the genius had never even suspected a thing.
He watched Tony for some time. His heart was swelling up with love and admiration as he glanced down at the gentleness of the other man.
Within 24 hours, Steve was being prepared to undergo another procedure but this time with the hope of recovering what he’d lost or at least maintaining his life. They had to speed through the beginning stages as the infection in his leg was fighting against them.
A couple of mornings later, Tony was actually on time for the first time in his entire career. He sat at his desk waiting for praise from his co-workers. Despite this, they ignored him in an attempt to deflate his over-inflated ego. He crossed his arms and pouted in defiance.
They were just scraping up the last morsels of their dinner when Tony coughed slightly and knew the brief silence was perfect timing. Steeling his nerve, he began,
Steve knew he was about to embarrass himself but sucked it up and spoke anyway. Natasha was his closest friend in their department so if he couldn’t share with her then he would have to just let it boil inside, “We may have shared a bed…” Her eyebrows rose further as she could tell there would be more, “And there may have been-“
A nurse hissed as he was brought to her. Her inhale of breath didn’t reassure Steve in the slightest.
"Name?" The guard on the door glanced up and down at Steve.
As he got closer he could see the cause of Steve’s unusual behaviour. The man was still attempting to run whilst leaning down with one hand grasping into his prosthetic leg as though he was trying to hold it together. Stark frowned and landed next to the soldier. Something inside of him told him just to continue on without the soldier but another part of him was reminded of the pain of Steve’s phantom pains only shortly before.
“Doing what? What does your ‘friend’ do?”
The genius was peering up at the soldier with a confused and slight ‘What-the-Fuck’ look plastered in his face, “What’s going on?”
The noises of the medic tent finally broke through the din and he heard nurses, glass bottles and pained cries. He’d been in to visit plenty of times but, luckily, never for anything himself.
Fury continued, “Everyone will be getting a course of ASL sign language to aid communications but maybe for now you try to keep the one sided arguments to a minimum, Stark.”
Once the smaller detective returned from where ever he was hiding, Steve purposefully kept his eyes solely on his own computer screen despite being able to sense Tony’s gaze frequently drifting across the precinct. Steve was going to teach the man a lesson in humility if it kills him.
The detectives and staff at the precinct were cowering in the briefing room despite the majority of them being completely innocent; some of them had never even watched online movies illegally.  They were all more than aware that any second now Captain Fury would storm through that door and release his wrath of holy thunder upon their heads. Tony and Steve shared a look from across the room as even their rivalry couldn’t withstand this kind of tension. Any kind of solidarity was positive.
He hesitated with one hand against the cold metal of the door in a mental conflict he was sure the hospital had witnessed many times. But for Stark, it wasn’t death or illness that lay behind the door but rather a pissed off colleague that he liked more than he wanted to admit but didn’t know how to pacify. Surely, this blunder, worse than all the rest, couldn’t be rectified by someone as socially inept as Tony Stark. All he knew was that he wouldn’t be willing to forgive quickly if the roles were reversed. Although, Steve had always been the more moral of the two and usually took the higher ground. By the time he had actually convinced himself to enter the room he was half sold on the idea that maybe it should be Steve apologising to him but even he could tell that was his usual behaviour of trying to back out of every awkward social setting in which he couldn’t use defensive humor coming into play.
There was a beat of silence where everyone glanced awkwardly at each other. Tony’s brows twitched but he’d committed this far so roared on,
Tony felt pleased with himself as he drank down every trace and worked Steve through his orgasm. The soldier laid back with his eyes closed and chest heaving to catch his breath.
Steve sat up, the blanket fell from him and, upon the reveal of his muscled chest, Stark was reminded that Steve was, in fact, definitely not a grandpa. He felt his eyes linger on his body but snapped himself out of it immediately as he remembered that it was Steve and they had a complicated relationship.
Despite the party, Steve and Tony couldn’t stop thinking about the best man speech. Clint had made it so personal and special for them. They’d need to thank him profusely.
Fury was waiting for them by the time everyone had settled down, “First let’s welcome Detective Rogers back” Natasha clapped the loudest despite her face reflecting no emotion. Steve blushed from where he was sat in the seat beside her, “Okay, now. First things first, Stark and Rogers, you two have a case this week that’ll need some undercover work.” He paused to make time for both men to protest but none came. He pretended not to be surprised as he continued. There had be rumours circulating the office that there had been a 180 in Tony and Steve’s relationship but this was the first instance he had seen that confirmed that.
"I didn't lose him. He walked out!" Tony puffed his chest and began to defend his honor as it really wasn't completely his fault. If they should be blaming anyone then it should be Cap himself for being an idiot.
Steve blinked at her dumbstruck. He couldn’t even respond due to how overwhelmed he was.
It took a few minutes more before they broke out of the forest and picked up pace as they headed towards the hospital tent. He could hear people they passed by mumbling his name or calling out to him. Captain Steve Rogers was a popular man on base and everyone knew him or had heard of his heroics, despite his small stature, so it was quite a scene to see him being hauled into base on a stretcher.
Another customer laughed out of awkwardness, “Ah, that was awkward as hell... Anyways, do you know where my latte is? I ordered it twenty minutes ago.” Stark eyed the man with a frown before bustling off to make his shit attempt at a latte.
“I’ve been waiting to do that for weeks.” Steve admitted.
Steve struggled to gather his thoughts as his emotions were flying all over the place. He had to wait a moment before he was able to sign. A stinging in his eyes almost distracted him but he pressed through.
“I mean… At least there is one.” Steve suggested with what was left of his optimism.
, Tony replied before kissing him gently,
“You need me?” Steve asked from the floor, mid-stretch.
“I’m fine, Stark. Don’t make a big deal out of it.”
“The storm has caused a power cut.” The soldier provided but had to confine in Tony further when the engineer frowned and leant his head in confusion, “I... I have a lamp I keep on by my bed but there’s no power...” He recognised that he sounded pathetic but he’d only just avoided a panic attack so had no energy to maintain a macho exterior. He’d never been so personal with Stark.
“You’re upset?” Tony sat on the edge of the bed and cupped Steve’s cheek like the other man often does for him, “Oh, baby. Don’t be. I couldn’t go through with it.”
Did he feel as though someone had dropped his body from the 10th floor of a building? Yes. The aching had penetrated right into his bones and the wound itself pulled at the stitches with every step or mere movement. That's without mentioning the weariness that caused him to blink heavily every couple of seconds.
They passed throughout the rest of the large building without incident and most of the rooms appeared to be either staff rooms, offices or rest rooms. If Tony didn’t already know how crooked Rogers was he may have been tempted to drop all suspicion against the man as it seemed squeaky clean.
There is a nsfw scene in this chapter but before it starts  the sign ‘=======‘ is used so feel free to skip that part if you’re uncomfortable.
“Hey! Look, I’m sorry. Just… Everyone knows you’ve got with every person within a 20 mile radius of your apartment…” Clint justified with a semi-apology in his eyes.
Steve frowned and slowed his breathing to avoid detection. Whatever they were about to say about him he was emotionally ready. He steeled himself in case he would have to jump up and defend himself like he had done countless times in his life.
They sat mirror image, each at one end of the bed facing each other with their legs crossed underneath them. Steve looked unsure, despite Tony’s regular reassurances that it was totally normal, but Tony’s enthusiastic eagerness to learn helped dispel the worst of the anxiety.
The soldier smiled, “Thank you, Tony. For then and for now.”
So I've already got 11,000 words for this story but have just realised that I hate the direction it's going in so I'm changing it! Be patient more is coming!
In the end they managed to stop laughing and stop messing with the lights but both of their stomach muscles cramped from the exertion. They smiled at each other as the tension had been diffused.
Sighing, Steve flipped open the file and blinked at the bright yellow post-it note that glared up at him. It was tacked directly on the first page so there was no chance of it being over looked.  Written in Stark’s cramped scrawl it stated:
“But if it’s the last thing on your Want To Do list then it’s still on the list. The last thing on the list is still a thing to be done...” Clint’s words remained with Tony long after the spy had dashed off without even saying goodbye.
Steve froze and frowned.
Looking up, he was about to open with his usual “Hi, what can I get you?” When his voice suddenly lodged itself in his throat.
She leant her head, “He can’t do all of those things and still be a good detective?” She challenged, "Besides, he's never flirted with me."
Slipping back into the coffee store, he called his colleague, Clint, to see what he thought of the whole situation.
Steve couldn’t help but burst out into laughter and grin ear from ear. His instantaneous panic after the kiss was beginning to melt away as he peered at Tony’s reflecting smile. His underlying feelings bubbled up to that monumental moment.
It was in that instant that Steve knew that today had been his last day with both his legs. However, he also knew that he was lucky it hadn’t been his last day alive.
The man’s lips were moving rapidly and it looked like he was calling to someone in between talking to Steve. In that moment Steve bet himself that Tony had talked to him the whole time he’d been in hospital despite his lack of hearing. Although, on reflection, somewhere in his subconscious he had a vague memory of someone manipulating his hand to form letters from the sign alphabet like a code. If he had been more conscious then he would have heard of the device that Tony had begun to develop which looked like a smart watch and would turn anything said on the intercom into text so he could be alerted to danger.
Tony stood up and Steve followed. The shorter argued,
“Don’t worry about it. It’s nothing.”
"Of course it was, dearie." Her watery eyes peered up and down his body. Making a clear comment of his outfit. She winked.
Steve’s ears followed the sound until his eyes adjusted to the room and he noticed Tony huddled at the table with a small flickering candle and some sort of science text spread open. The genius was squinting against the low light to read his paper but his eyes were currently looking concerned in Roger’s direction.
“Are you kidding?! That was the greatest surprise of my whole life!”
Tony stepped away from the board and squared his shoulder in front of where Steve was sitting, “Look, Mr Perfect. I know this isn’t your case but if you could take your head out of your ass for once, that’d be great! The rest of us have cases too.” He folded his arms and mentally prepared himself for the backlash.
Steve’s mouth fell open as he gazed around at the flashing billboards and modern cars. Blue eyes took it all in thoroughly but a part of him was still in disbelief. His tongue darted out to moisten his dry lips, an anxious habit he’d never managed to break.
He hissed through his gritted teeth to steel his nerves before knocking on the door. His stomach did a flip as he listened. However, after waiting a couple of minutes, he knocked again but slightly harder. He listened again, brows furrowed so hard that they almost met in the middle.
She left to fetch water and towels to mop him up while they waited for the doctor to come and make his assessments. It stung as she wiped away the majority of the debris and softly she apologized every time he took a sharp inhale of breath.
“Thanks, Clint.”
Tony smiled gently at Steve but the man’s eyes were glued to the screen. All was forgiven.
The memory of it brought back bad memories as he could still remember the absolute all-consuming nature of the pain, the panic of his troops and the feeling of complete helplessness as he was stretchered back to base. He’d only recalled the actual event a handful of times and that was mainly because he had no choice.
He had hardly finished his sentence when a clap of thunder rocketed through the city and echoed around the buildings. As if it was waiting for that cue, the rain then descended in a thick and steady sheet; the heaviest rain Tony had ever witnessed. Suddenly, running seemed like the only option.
Sam took Steve’s smile as a sign of agreement so circled back to the main issue, “Who is it?”
"Я в России." The accent melted into the words smoothly, burning all evidence of his Brooklyn origins. He quickly translated for the other man, "I'm in Russia."
As he looked back to Fury he could see a small smirk on the man’s lips. He was enjoying this.
He stumbled upon the room almost by accident as the detective had been more than convinced he’d taken the wrong left somewhere along the line in this maze of a building. He had mentally prepared himself for half a day lost in just trying to navigate before he finally lost his wits and surrendered to the knowledge of the medical staff bustling by. He wanted to wait until the last moment though as he wasn’t a quitter and wasn’t about to become one.
Barton threw his hands up innocently, "Actually, I saw you running so I was coming to get you. It's your fault you don't look where you're going." He smirked, "Didn't your mommy tell you to always look both ways before crossing the street?"
“I’ll let you in on a secret, Mr Stark... I don’t trust myself either.” Rogers stood up from the interrogation table whilst sliding his jacket onto his muscular shoulders in one smooth movement, “But my word is all you have. Good day, Officer.”
They peered at each other for a second to gage whether this was a prank before laughing.
Steve pulled out his medical personnel ID which, luckily, came with an old and blurry picture. He flashed it quickly to prevent the guard truly inspecting the card. This what all the hard work in the park had been for. Luckily enough, him and the good doctor did share a couple of similar features like the blond hair and strong jaw.
The two detectives nodded eagerly. Steve was raring to go but Tony was excited to get back out there with the man considering how well the last chase ended. Within a couple of days they were all set up and ready to move into the hide out.
He left the body there, hidden behind a box of test tubes, to slip into his next costume and inhabit his next persona. In the boiler room he slipped on a blue overall bodysuit, which he knew would be there from previous tour of the building, and high-visibility jacket. He stole a large trolley for transporting large boxes and a huge box with ‘Champagne glasses’ etched on the side. He changed and pushed the trolley back to the body where he loaded it in the box and used the disguise to slip out the trade entrance which was pinned open for party staff to come and go to collect food or champagne.
“How did you even know there was only one bed?” Steve asked as the realisation dawned on him.
Tony reached across the table to tap Steve chin up,
Tony chuckled gently. He wasn’t about to tell Steve about all the places he had done something sexual. His reputation for being promiscuous wasn’t completely without basis but he wasn’t ashamed of that. It did make him laugh, however, at the idea of him getting with Steve Rogers especially with all his preconceived ideas of the man. A few months ago he would have never even been able to imagine Steve doing anything even remotely naughty within the precinct confines.
