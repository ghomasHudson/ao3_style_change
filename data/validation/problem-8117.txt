“Probably the fact that a line cook is now walking around with tech that should not, on the record, exist yet,” Tony chimed in.
“Friends?” he supplied.
It was a simple, mindless command. All the Avengers were on the common floor, setting the table for dinner. Natasha placed the silverware while Bruce handed Clint some bread rolls. Steve ordered Tony to pour him something he’d like, and he followed the command automatically. It wasn’t until Tony’s hand curled around the old fashioned, that he had the sense to chuckle at his reaction.
Steve’s stomach churned and he hunched against his apartment door as soon as he closed it, feeling a physical pain from everything that had transpired. He needed to get back in that building. Again. He was right back where he started, only this time he was on Stark Tower’s radar.
“--and it was crazy, brazen as all hell really. What can I expect from someone who goes around claiming to be a long dead American Hero?” Tony threw himself on the deck chair.
“You’re right.”
Steve pressed his lips together but knew his smile peaked out through the edges. This man he’d chosen to go through life with could barely sit still. Steve wrapped a hand around Tony’s wrist and pulled him over the back of the couch with little finesse or warning. Tony flopped onto Steve’s chest, their knees knocking together, their thighs slotting like puzzle pieces.
“Good afternoon, Captain,” Coulson greeted in the doorway. His expression dropped into a frown when he took in the scene Steve made. “Problems?”
“I’m not in the business of raiding private citizens,” Steve replied, even though he’d like nothing more than to raid Stane’s apartments--not for tech, but to make him pay for what he did to Tony. These two, though, did not need to know that. He tried to lead the conversations into the things he did need to know. “Stane seems to be running that company with a singular direction.”
” Steve asked, eyes still fixed on their counterparts. “Also, hi, wow, what a surprise! I mean, I’m sorry, where are my manners? It's a pleasure to meet you, if not a bit surprising. ”
Steve’s brow furrowed.
Tony was
For tvd1992
Tony looked up at Anthony. “I guess it really wanted to return home? E.T style.”
A hot flush spread up the back of Steve's neck, and he opened his mouth but no words came out. How was he supposed to explain that he'd been admiring Tony's body out of nothing but confusion and surprise without it sounding weird?
“You? The adult?” Bucky snorted. “You just put a pillow on a damp floor.”
Steve smirked over his shoulder and kicked off. The broom pointed toward the clouds and they were off. Tony’s stomach dropped as they shot up, the wind hitting his face an entirely new sensation. But flying, he knew, and the joy of it built until he bellowed out a shout.
When they landed, Steve grabbed Tony’s hand and led them to the penthouse they now shared. As soon as the door closed, he pushed Tony against it, hands running along the armor the way he’d been imagining midair.
“Mine,” Steve whispered. And Tony beamed, tumbling forward and connecting them with a kiss.
He had told Clint, he wasn’t ticklish but he had to find out for himself. Maybe he should try his feet or behind the knees. He tilted his head, James’ silent but his hands still wandering. Up, up, up, to his sides and Clint tensed, realizing what was about to happen.
“Not!” Tony came over to him, tugging at his arm until Steve budged from the spot, laughing. “Not what we’re here to see.”
Steve smiled. “Well see, that’s something.”
It was a simple, mindless command. All the Avengers were in the common floor, setting the table for dinner. Natasha placed the silverware while Bruce handed Clint some bread rolls. Steve was ordered to the bar by Tony, and he followed the command automatically. It wasn’t until his hand curled around the whiskey, that he had the sense to blush at his eager reaction.
also helped with motivation.
It was Tony stumbling backwards with a whispered curse that startled Steve back into action. In two strides he was by Tony’s side and wrapping his arms around him. The blood soaked into the carpet; Steve clenched Tony tighter to his side and reached over to Stane's still body, feeling for a pulse.
Steve bucked his hips up, in part because he wanted to see Tony’s reaction and also because now that he knew how good they felt together he needed more.
The man paused again, like he was waiting for something to happen and that’s when Tony found his tongue.
“He has no way of knowing where we are,” Steve assured, but his stomach still churned with unease.
Tony nodded. “The helmet will stop me from getting shifted but you’ll have to fly blind.”
Well, it
With arms back around Tony, his own voice muttered assurances Tony hadn’t asked for into the silent hotel room. Steve shifted them just enough so he could peer at Tony, whose wide eyes fixed on absolutely nothing. They’d won, but here was the cost of that victory right in front of Steve. Tony had killed a man. It was in self-defense and, in Steve’s opinion, more than justified. None of that meant Tony wouldn’t carry the memories of taking a life with him for the rest of his own.
Tony.
The thin chain of balled metal ran between Steve's fingers. For decades it had been holding his dog tags around his neck. But ever since that first night Steve had handed Tony the flat metal tags, they’d been his--a remnant of Steve’s past brought to the future through Tony, turned into something beautiful now. As he’d sketched, he designed the chords of blue leather around the chain so delicate, yet enduring.
“Me too,” Tony whispered back. “All the seasons greetings and adrenaline really inspired me. Along with your face.”
It was too soon–they’d only shared their first kiss last week. And for them to be torn apart before even having a chance to–
The force of Steve’s grip broke his mouse which thankfully made Rumlow shut his mouth before Steve’s fist had to do the job. Under his anger was one bright line of information: They didn’t know that Tony was missing, even if things were off at SI, even if the nanomask had turned up, they didn’t know it had anything to do with Tony.
Tony turned and threw his arms wide, showing off the spacesuit like it was haute couture. His grin tapered off when Steve couldn't manage anything but a scowl in return. "What's wrong?" Tony asked, his voice tinny and strange through the speaker on the suit.
Tony froze, jaw almost dropping. “Kudos for the deadpanned sass. I like you. You should ask the other me out.” And before Steve could stutter a reply, he pulled the broom from his hands and swung a leg over it. “What next?”
Today, Tony had woken to an empty bed, the smell of coffee barely hinting in the air. It was one of the days Steve had to take Harley to his morning robotics lab, at an ungodly hour before his already early school day started. Their home might have been empty, but there was a text message waiting for Tony on his phone from Steve.
"You're far too beautiful to be this uncomfortable in your own skin."
Steve had been heading to begin with, or off him entirely.
“It was an honor to meet you both,” Steve the professor replied.
Steve slowed them, lowered to the first rooftop he could find. He tripped over the landing but managed to secure Tony onto the concrete. Relief wouldn’t come, not until he ripped the mask off and saw Tony breathing. But the only thing he found was Tony’s blank face and closed eyes.
“No,” Steve replied anyway, pulling out the earbud. “Just distracted by the news.”
“I need you.” Tony twisted the pliers one last time, then smiled. “To do something for me.”
Rumlow’s gaze was on the phone in his hand, but Coulson had his eye on Steve, more precisely, Steve’s hand, still crushing into the mouse.
The gemstone hovered, floating next to them as they flew back over the forest towards the castle and the hut. Tony wondered if he was imagining the heat that radiated from the stone, the hum so like the ring. There was a connection between the stone and this world, like there had been between the ring and Tony’s. He wanted to tinker, just like he’d wanted to do back in his workshop, but more than anything he wanted to return home. To Steve.
Steve took a step closer to Tony, the suit rolled over Tony’s shoulders and he took a matching step towards Steve.
If in the armor he appeared cold and distant, in the white cotton shirt and pajama pants, Tony looked softer than Steve could ever remember seeing him before. Steve knew for sure he’d never found his rambling...cute, for lack of a better word, before.
That afternoon, energy buzzing under his skin, Steve went for a walk. His feet naturally led him to the sidewalk where he first saw Tony. The suits in the windows had changed, and he found himself wondering what Tony’s opinions on the clothing would be, if anyone had even asked him his opinion on what he wore or if his Alpha decided everything.
With only a tiniest reference to the man, Steve’s face broke into a bright smile. “Don’t tell him I told you this, because he already teases me about it, but his turns are even smoother than mine, you should see--There. How he leaned into the arc of the curve. When we get up there, that’s what we’re going to try to do.”
“--the deal was set! Fifty thousand units for three mill.” A pause, then the man turned red. “No! Do you know who I am? I may be one member of the board but the rest of the Stark Industries execs will toe whatever line
The next morning, with his mind on Tony, Steve rolled out of bed and into his shower. He knew what he had to do, the plan coming together easily as soon as he’d decided where his priorities lay.
Steve walked over to Tony, and sat down next to him. He took a deep breath. “What happened?” he couldn’t help but ask. Tony’s cheeks were flushed and his hair looked like it’d sweated then dried over again, like he’d recently been for a run, but it was more than obvious that wasn’t the case. “Are you hurt?”
“What the hell is this? Who are you? Why are you wearing my face? Where the hell am I? Why are you shouting at me in convoluted Latin?”
Happy needed JARVIS to start giving him some sort of secret warning signal or something, but at least today, Tony was distracted enough that he could slip out undetected.
Tony snorted. “That's how me and my Steve started off too.”
Stuckony + relinquish, expectation, punish by Anonymous
Steve felt cold inside; he wanted to rip down every shelf, pull the pages out of each book, burn it to the ground. He took a deep breath, but it was too full of too many scents to do anything to calm him. “What does that mean?”
“It was my mission, Tony!”
Steve felt a cold clench in his gut.
He let one hand squeeze, while the other slid in, tracing over Tony’s hole. Then, with one well aimed press, he pushed his undersuit-covered finger into Tony, just a minute breach, and thick spurts of come shot into Steve’s mouth so hard they hit the back of his throat.
“Hey,” Bucky said, casual, like they hadn’t just been risking their lives.
Forcing his eyes open, he could tell right away he was in a forest. The trees were thick and varied, beech, oak, pine, and sycamore all around him. As he looked around, he realized he sat towards the edge of the forest, a large field peeking ahead of him between the trees. The wind picked up, a piercing shriek that Tony realized wasn’t the wind at all but a scream coming from above him. He shuffled to his feet, moving towards the sound instead of away like he could hear Steve in his mind ordering him to do so. But this wasn’t the battlefield--at least, he didn’t think it was...he crouched low as he got to the treeline, wishing desperately he had more in his possession than just a ring. Maybe if he focused on working on the nano-suit instead of tinkering with magic artifacts.
Tony hissed, pulling his hand back. His blood moved, spreading onto the gem, pooling into the slice that cut across its black-red surface. The ring heated and hummed some more, the energy no scans could detect only increasing in force. It shook and shook until it shot out of Tony’s hand and onto the workstation. The ring spun, clanking against the metal, and Tony took a step back, then another.
Steve’s attention was still on the floor of the hut, but he finally looked up when no one said anything after a moment. Steve tried to catch Anthony’s eye first, a tense pull across his forehead as if he was willing Anthony to look at him. It didn’t take long for Anthony to cave and when he did Steve’s face softened and he stepped closer. Tony knew, if this had been his Steve, he’d be reaching for Tony’s hands right now. This Steve bumped his shoulders against Anthony’s. “We all know that I’m going to help him.”
Steve had his lips pressed together, suppressing a smirk. His hand had dropped onto his thigh, and Tony watched it rub up and down, slip a bit against his inseam. Tony swallowed, met Steve’s eye again just long enough to see the blue dancing in the lights, before looking away, back to the screen. A half-formed answer fell from him, filling the silence, and he just barely managed to keep his voice even as the plug slipped over his prostate.
“Very good, Tony.” Then he pushed Tony back so his ass dragged along the seat and he saw stars, the vibrator pressing even deeper. By the time he recovered, Steve had his pants unbuttoned and was pulling out Tony’s swollen cock. The first drag of Steve’s tongue around the tip almost had Tony believing he’d be able to last. But then Steve sucked down long and hard, so that Tony hit the back of his throat. His hips jolted, shifting the plug along his prostate and then Steve swallowed around his cock, muscles constricting and Tony was done for. His hips raised into Steve’s hands, cock pulsing as Tony fell over the edge, shivering with each wave of pleasure that rippled from his prostate to the tip of his cock.
Tony’s cheeks lit up with tingles that spread to his forehead and chin. It took a second for the sensation to clear, and he knew by Steve’s reaction when he wore his own face again.
“No need to worry.” Anthony waved away his concern with his non-wand holding hand. “Simple concealment charm.”
“I-uh,” Steve had nothing to say to Obadiah Stane. He fixed his worried stare on Tony instead. “Are you alright?”
Behind him he thought maybe he heard Tony's amused snort.
One could argue, it was none of Steve’s business. The omega was obviously bonded to the alpha, even if the bond was one-way. That bite was all society needed to overlook the transgressions that Steve had witnessed on the sidewalk. But Steve wasn’t society, and waking up decades in the future, he’d been disappointed by what had changed and what had very much stayed the same.
Steve cleared his throat and pasted on a smile, trying to mask his frustration. “You know me-- getting used to this machine.”
The man dropped them off at the curb and left with his new multi million dollar trinket, pulling away with a screech of his tires against the asphalt. Tony sat in the first armchair he saw while Steve went to inquire about vacancies. Luckily, no one asked questions, no one seemed to care. The benefits of New York City.
“Kim, Seokjin,” Tony picked up after.
Tony didn’t say anything for a moment and when he did it was through a pasted on smile, his gaze fixed on the far wall of the library. “You haven’t seen this room before, right? It’s one of my favorites. None of the other residents are really one for books, so it’s usually empty. Look around. Take something or somedozen, no one will notice.”
Behind him Anthony chuckled. “Can’t resist playing tourist?”
A...sporting event?
For maythecat12
Thanks for reading! More to come this weekend.
“They really don’t teach alphas much at all when it comes to omega sexual health do they?” The pharmacist shook her head.
Tony sucked in a shocked gasp, eyes widening. “Uh--?” he managed.
Stane growled. “You’d really let me shoot you for this used up, mouthy, piece of ass? He probably charmed you with promises of riches and his wet cunt, but look what he’ll go and do as soon as he gets a chance. He’ll run.”
“No,” Tony replied, closing his fist around the ring and watching the man wearing his face, this other version of him that went by Anthony, keep his gaze on Tony’s hand before his eyes shuddered closed. Tony continued, “But I’m starting to gather that this ring is more than it appears. A Horca--Horcru--”
“Hey!” Somehow Tony had moved without him noticing, tugged on his hand, not letting go. “You don’t have to run away. I’m not mad. About any of it.” Tony scented the air, a small sniff but an intentional one. Steve’s scent gland throbbed and he had to bite his lip against a moan. Their hands were still clasped together and Tony looked at him from under his impossible lashes and smiled, private and vulnerable. “I like it,” he whispered. “I like you.”
“They make supersoldier strength headphones now?” Coulson asked, clearly already knowing the answer.
The second Steve came through the door, he was all over Tony. Steve crowded him up against the wall, their feet tripping together. Tony felt hot breath against his neck and immediately spiraled down into the wonderful, hazy place where all that mattered was Steve.
Steve nodded, pointing at the woman who had cut him off. “Exactly that. She started on the cleaning crew and left her wallet at home. I dropped her off but she needs it to get on the train.”
“Tony, I’ll ride with you anytime.”
but he didn’t think so.
The hallways were empty as they walked through them and when Tony commented on it, Anthony shook his head. “They’re all at Hogsmeade right now. Or outside in the Quidditch pitch--Steve sometimes holds practice matches over the weekends.”
Bucky shrugged, slid onto the couch next to Clint and tucked the blankets around them both. “Whatever you say, marshmallow. I know you like to be comfortable for movie night.”
“Six hours until the ship initiates sleep--” Steve shut his mouth as the sudden realization hit him. He shot up from the
“Who the fuck cares?! Get the fuck out!” Stane pulled out his cellphone and pressed a button. “Security! Ninetieth floor. Now.”
“Lock the door,” Steve ordered. “And don’t let anyone in, even us unless they say the codeword, um, Gimbap. Got it?”
“So then how did it come to life--oh. My blood. I cut myself on it and it came to life right after it.”
Tony looked passed Stane towards Steve, cheeks wet with tears but once he focused on Steve his eyes blazed to life. Stane turned his back on Tony, so he could face Steve. “You,” Stane growled, stepping closer and knocking his chin back as he surveyed Steve through the most superior gaze.
Steve wrapped his arm around Tony’s side, tugging him into a hug. “Look at that, our mothers make some beautiful music together.”
The water was a lake, calm and still except for the group of cape-clad children playing along the shore of the far end. He’d focused on the capes, but his mind was still trying to process the sight of the castle behind the lake. It reached so high it blocked the sun and it seemed like it had more towers than he could count. Near the lake, he could see a hut surrounded by a pumpkin patch, and it was the sight of huge pumpkins in what was supposed to be midsummer that made Tony start to laugh uncontrollably.
But then - a spark of red in the sky. Falling, always falling, and Steve felt the pressure build, the anger and unrelenting need to
A one-way bond was enough to tie an omega and all his assets to an alpha for the rest of their lives. There were some protections in place if another alpha was to touch the omega, but for his own alpha? There was little legal recourse.
Tony narrowed his eyes at Steve but Steve could see the amusement dancing at the corners of Tony’s mouth, at the way his hands had come over the back of the couch too, drawing lazy patterns up and down Steve’s chest, pulling the hem up to reveal a strip of his lower stomach, which Tony traced a finger over too. “I said, there’s been a mixup here.”
Steve shrugged one shoulder, feeling immensely put on the spot. "Don't die in space, Stark."
Steve was thrown because he really wanted to explain the Captain America thing, but Tony was starting to turn in on himself just remembering their conversation in the library. The conversation that led to the suppressants. “I didn’t mean to overstep,” Steve added quickly. “If you want to throw them in my face or whatever, I understand.”
Tell him. “No. I, uh, well..”
Obadiah Stane was mere floors above him, so accessible yet completely untouchable because as much as he wanted to save Tony, he hadn’t been asked to fight this fight. All he could do were little things. Little things like slide the pharmacy bag from his coat pocket and hand it over to Chef Ana.
“Why do you always think I’ve done something!?” The accusation painted annoyance all over Anthony’s face. They were like a match ready to strike and light into spark at any moment. It was a familiar antagonism, one Tony really wished they’d resolve the way he and Steve had: by pushing each other against an alley wall after shawarma.
“Well,” Tony leaned in close to Steve so the others couldn’t hear. “Pulling a Jimin doesn’t sound like getting kidnapped by shapeshifters, and none of them seem worried so--”
“Probably.”
Then a deep breath rattled Tony's frame. "He's gone."
Steve walked around the side of the floor. Most workstations were empty but a few had people working in them. No one seemed to care about Steve though, barely looking up as he passed by. The mannequins holding the masks were, thankfully, unmanned. It’d been a while since he performed any sleight of hand, but he was confident no one noticed when he slipped one into his bag.
Could he mean the nanomask? Steve didn’t let his eyes bug or hands shake even though he suddenly realized Coulson stood between him and the only exit. He tried to think of something other than the mask, something he’d read about in SHIELD’s files. “Jericho doesn’t seem like Howard--”
“Right,” Steve didn’t need anything else. What Tony wanted, Tony would get. “A hotel then. I know of one near my apartment. Outside of Manhattan. He won’t be able to find us. I won’t let him.” Steve kept his words purposely vague in case Stane had cameras in here too. “Can you walk?”
“On your knees,” Steve growled out, eyes flashing. His hand dug into Tony’s hair and guided him roughly to the floor. He knelt, legs spread, the backs of his feet pressed against the wall.
“Of this?” Tony stepped on his toes and brushed their lips together, just the faintest of touches but it sparked between them an electricity that shot over his mouth and down to his heart. He knew Tony felt it too because when he stepped back he whispered, “Wow,” into the space between them.
Steve growled, low and deep in his chest. He’d heard of the medical exams, it was such a normal part of the omega life that he’d never really thought much of it, until now, like many things that had to do with Tony. Back in the forties, there were clinics in every city, it must be the same now. Though he couldn’t imagine Tony going to a public clinic. Steve's eyes shot to the chaise lounge and a mental image followed, one of Tony laid out on it, a doctor with a gloved hand opening him up, checking his slick glands and milking his prostate till completion.
“You’ll show me how thankful you are when we get back to the Tower.”
“We have a complicated relationship.”
Somewhere in the floors far above him, Steve was sitting in their living room or laying in their bed or getting off in the bathtub, finger pressed on the vibrators’ controls as he thought about Tony. The unrelenting vibrations kept him hard and on the edge. His pants kept his arousal hidden, but he still stayed behind his desk, even though he usually tried to leave his office as quickly as possible, eager to be back in R&D, or with Steve.
Steve clenched his jaw against Tony’s defense, turning back at the computer because he couldn’t give himself away--but apparently Coulson didn’t seem to have much of an appetite for Rumlow’s crass claims either. He curled his lip in disgust. “Stane is an idiot who doesn’t know what he has with Tony Stark.”
Steve swallowed, suddenly feeling like he got caught doing something he wasn’t supposed to be doing, instead of watching a charity sporting event. Not knowing what to say, he managed a, “You looked good out there.”
“We need to move forward as if they did,” Steve said.
Steve nodded and tried not to move an inch of his body. Tony, on the other hand, came alive, shifting and dragging his hips along Steve as he moved into a sitting position. “Look, if you’re unable to even sleep next to me because you’re so, I don’t know,
Steve immediately put up his hands and fell to his knees, attempting to appear as small and non-threatening as possible. “It’s me,” he whispered then tore off the mask he’d almost forgotten was still affixed to his face. He’d usually take it off, once he and Tony were somewhere private. Now, Tony flicked his gaze through his hanging fringe and stopped shaking at the sight of Steve, but didn’t move any closer.
Tony shook his head. “The ring. Steve had told me to take it to Strange, but I had to poke it. I always have to poke. I was just looking at it and it came to life almost--You said it had a piece of a soul?”
His hands started to roam back along Steve’s chest, tugging his shirt up as they went. Following Tony’s lead he tried to lift his hands, but that only resulted in him hitting the back of them against the capsule ceiling. Steve laughed, breaking their kiss but it was okay because Tony’s chuckle set vibrations where it pressed into his jaw and down his neck.
“Using the Battle of New York against me?” Tony gasped with dramatic flair. “Well, I’ll be.”
“If you say so.” Bucky shook his head with a smile.
To say the man was in a grumpy mood was an understatement, Clint glared at him from under his mountain of blankets. “I have a broken arm, not a fever.”
A week passed.
They’d kissed the day before and he hadn’t seen the man since. The ambient sounds of the park and the scratch of the pencil usually helped with his focus, but it seemed Tony broke through even his most reliable defenses. He remembered the pressure of his lips, his taste...then they had parted. Tony had pulled away first, pupils blown wide, and excused himself to a meeting with a twist of regret in his smile.
James shrugged, eyes trailing over Tony. “This would’ve been more likely to have given me a sugar rush, than put me under the table.” He placed the drink to the side and took off his shirt. Tony let himself stare back, it was one of the perks of this new….thing they’d started. That didn’t mean James hadn’t caught his gaze, though, or smirked at him from under it.
“I want to touch you,” Tony whispered in his ear, warm breath caressing his cheek.
The hand ran down Steve’s leg, over the arch of his foot, and off the end of his toes. A satisfied little groan that sounded suspiciously like “mine” slipped out of Tony’s mouth, then Tony's footsteps padded softly out of the room.
Then he took out the sleek remote and flicked the vibration back on.
Steve couldn’t blame his warming cheeks on the sun this time. Still he stepped forward, grabbing a brush of his own and pulling up next to Tony. He dropped his gaze pointedly to Tony’s snug, red breeches. “Not to inflate your already enormous ego, but that may be impossible.”
“I want to--Fuck. Look.” Tony’s breath made his shoulders shake when he inhaled, deep and determined, before lifting his eyes and meeting Steve’s. “You told me that you were going after intel.” Tony gestured at the couch. “Stop hovering like one of us is going to snap. Yes, I’m not overly fond of alpha scent. Any alpha’s. But I’m capable of separating things in my head.”
Light fingers danced down Steve’s side, then tucked up under his shirt. The cotton t-shirt and gym shorts he wore suddenly seemed naked and exposed as he blushed under the gaze he knew he was subject to.
A warm weight under Steve’s arm shifted closer, back fitting against Steve’s chest and waist dragging against Steve’s hips. His body reacted, blood beginning to flow south and brain ticking to life--Steve jolted up and off the bed, tripping out of the exit of the capsule and hitting the spaceship floor hard.
They decided to stick close to BTS even after the threat was assessed, as a precaution. Plus, having some of the best seats in the house, and a good vantage point of all stage entrances, made it worth the late night hours.
It reminded him of Tony.
“You sure you’re not the one that needs help?”
“I think you like me watching.”
Since it seemed in both his reality and his own hallucinations there were no threats, Tony started to walk along the treeline. He let the shouting fade behind him, heading towards the sound of splashing water. Maybe he could follow a river to something that made any sort of sense.
“When it comes to space, we both know I’m the expert. Come on, Captain, it’s like I’m getting beamed up to the center of the Milky Way every other financial quarter and--”
He followed it down the white-walled hallway. There were doors shut along each side and Steve found himself testing each doorknob, but all of them were locked and empty. Eventually, the scent started to fade and Steve pivoted on his heel and pushed open the door next to a stairwell sign. Walking up, the door to the next floor required a keycard, but Steve easily pushed it open and repeated his search on that floor, and the next one, and the one above that, every one was empty but the scent grew.
set, do you hear me?”
Holographic screens popped to life around them, reflecting the image over and over - a closeup of his bicep
Anthony swung his gaze from Tony to Steve. “You’re going to help him,” he spat. “Because that’s what you do.”
A frigid shiver ran through Steve at the thought of Stane doing the absolute worst. Would he kill his own omega? It’d break their bond, and it didn’t seem like Stane wanted that. He’d known Tony his whole life, surely he cared somewhat--No. This wasn’t a rational man. There was no certainty for Steve here, only fear and an ache because Stane could kill Tony. His hands could fit around Tony’s slender neck, he could beat him to death, starve him, shove him off the balcony hundreds of stories high.
Steve cleared his throat and Jimin’s gaze swung to him, a quick swipe up and down in a admiring way Tony was familiar with but then all business. “Codeword, yes,” Jimin said. “Gimbap.” Jungkook followed with the codeword and they were cleared to join the rest of the group.
“Good, Tony. So good.”
“You deserve to hear it nonetheless.” Steve stepped close, and Tony winced again, following it this time with a curse.
“You as well,” Tony found himself saying, even if he had no idea who these pop stars were twenty fours ago outside of recognizing a few of their ear worm choruses after Clint had played him their latest album in the common room.
More than just the Iron Man boots spilled out of thin air, wrapping around his calves and legs. “Like you could.”
“What are you--?”
“You agree so prettily.”
Tony took a deep breath and wished desperately for his armor, but at least this area was even more isolated. He walked down the hallway until it broke off with one path continuing straight and the other going left, he turned the corner left and slammed right into another caped individual, this one an adult, who had been more focused on the book in his hands than his own path.
Tony snorted. “It’s a bomb, well a series of bombs. Stane had me--I helped sometimes, it meant I could be in the workshop and…” Tony trailed off and Steve didn’t press him. He looked so exhausted, despite his earlier nap, completely folding in on himself. He should let the man rest, go back to his apartment for the night, but he also wanted to watch over Tony.
“Ana told me where you were, but if you want to be left alone...”
Steve barely looked like he could get past the fact that there were two Tonys, let alone grasp that there was something that connected their worlds in his flying equipment hut. He kept flicking his gaze between the two of them and Tony would have given up a significant part of his very large fortune to read this Steve’s mind right now. With his brow furrowing and his neck flushing red, Tony wondered if the thoughts were turning to the many,
“You weren’t joking,” Tony whispered, backing away, taking his warmth and his scent with him even as it tinged and soured with fear and confusion. “You. Alive....but, how?”
“Don’t,” James growled the word under his breath. The sound rumbled from his chest to Clint’s, at all the places where they were pressed together. With James hovering over him, Clint knew it should feel threatening. James’ hold was tight on his waist, their thighs slotted together, James had him surrounded. The man had been trained for decades, honed to be dangerous; Clint couldn’t care less.
The lead slashed across the page, ringing in his ears. They could have talked more then, set boundaries to separate their play.
Clint slunk into the dark kitchen, sock-covered feet silent on the tile floor. He tiptoed by the fridge, around the espresso maker, over to the bread basket that held Clint’s prize. Nat had brought them into the tower last night with strict orders to keep them untouched till morning.
“I know, but it helps a bit, yeah?” He wanted to do something..
As soon as Steve recovered, he searched for Tony. He was spinning through the sky in a freefall and Steve wished desperately to be closer, so much so that it felt like he actually had moved towards Tony.
“For us, too.” Tony gestured towards the bed, where his Steve had the sheet pulled up. He probably wasn’t wearing any pants either.
He let out a heavy breath, and pinned Tony with a glare. "You think" - the camera flashed in a series of photos - "you know everything."
“We won,” Tony whispered right before his knees buckled.
Steve swore again. He’d been impulsive in the past but this surpassed it all, definitely for anything he’d done this century. And Tony hadn’t even believed him.
“Tony.” Steve breathed and reveled in the feel of Tony’s hold moving along with his inhale, arms tightening around Steve’s chest as it expanded with it.
He’d never been to the ninety-first floor before--it was part of the private residence, Steve knew that much. He swallowed and crushed the post-it in his fist. A barrage of thoughts ran through his mind: Had Tony done it? Had he confronted Stane, even though he told Steve he’d wait, that he’d let Steve be there? It was Tony’s fight, but they'd agreed Tony wouldn't go alone to confront his horrific excuse of a bondmate. Steve’s mouth soured at the word, reminding Steve of Tony’s scent when he was distressed.
They’d been playing the game in companionable silence for some time when Tony, hand hovering over his rook, looked up to Steve. “They put me on prenatals.”
Steve hummed. “I was there. I like to see how far technology has come. Is that a problem?”
He clenched his eyes closed and wished he could disappear and reappear back on earth. Behind him, a stunned Tony remained frozen, at least for a second, and then he started to laugh. Steve tensed but didn’t move. Tony could do whatever he wanted. Far be it for Steve to dictate how he reacted to Steve's uncomfortable attraction to his presence.
“Are you kidding me right now Tony,” Steve snapped, his last nerve had fizzled seconds ago. “This is four months, you seriously want to be stuck here. With me. For four months?”
The orchestra crescendoed into the middle of the first act and Steve shifted in his seat in Tony’s box at the Met. Every movement pressed the plug into a new angle, and he floated between pleasure and mortification as the opera faded into the background.
The van had been doing its best, not stuttering against the accelerator as much as Bucky had expected. Slow and steady.
“And you’re sure that none of them got a look?” Tony asked. The last thing they needed was one of the members or their close staff to have already turned.
Tony may've been asking him a follow-up question, or inquiring as to why he was staring at Tony's half naked body, but it didn't matter because before Steve could think it through, he sputtered out a a flimsy excuse, more random consonants than actual words, and walked out the room.
He shifted in his seat, uncomfortable, trying to keep his eyes from darting around too much.
Steve had seen plenty of naked men in his life - he'd been in the army - but they'd all been grimy, bloodied, and ungroomed, deep in the heart of battle. Tony was anything but. He was always impeccably manicured, from what Steve could normally see, but now it was clear that his whole body was as carefully groomed as his hair and nails. It seemed that the clippers didn't stop at Tony's chin, and Steve was momentarily stunned to realize that it was even possible to trim your hair "down there" without - uh - damage...
On the battlefield he gave the orders.
“I hope they’re still in Korea,” Namjoon said. “But they could’ve followed us.”
Thank you so much for coming along on this journey with Tony, and thank you so much ferret for betaing along the way.
Tony’s whole body lit up like someone had flipped his circuit switch. His grip against the podium tightened, the only outward sign that he’d even noticed Steve at all. But Tony knew Steve was well aware of the effect he had him, even as he slid in the front row, close enough to the stage that Tony could see him in the dark theater, the outpouring of stage lights glinting off his smile. It was bright, but nothing out of the ordinary, not a flicker of deviousness or mischief. Not a hint for Tony to follow, of what he might do next.
(See the end of the chapter for
“So I bullied my way into your bed?” Tony hummed. “Sounds like me.” He laughed and Steve was struck at how much he’d always loved his laugh, even when he wanted to punch him in the face. And right now punching was far from his mind. Tony’s laugh morphed into a smile, into a bit bottom lip, into his tongue coming out to wet the bitten skin. Steve knew he was staring, knew he wanted to do more than stare. “What are you going to do with me?” Tony whispered.
Steve pulled back, just far enough to blow cool air over the damp kiss marks. “No,” he said, considering. “I don’t think you’ve properly repaid me.”
Sitting across from him with a sporkful of vaguely curry flavored astronaut food frozen halfway to his mouth, Tony caught Steve watching him and narrowed his gaze. “What? I’d ask if there was food on my face but I’m pretty sure whatever this is would cause a mild burning and discomfort if it got anywhere near my ageless beauty. The days of experimental skincare practices is far behind me, well, not far far but far--”
“Jericho, shmerico,” a voice said from beyond Coulson.
“Lower your hand once the ring is in place then turn around and pull your pants over that plump ass of yours, so I can do the finishing touches for us. If you’re already whimpering from this alone, I don’t think I can trust you once you put those greedy fingers of yours anywhere near your prostate.”
“I’m going to need a little more information than that,” the pharmacist prompted with a smile. “Is your omega, and you of course, looking for family planning?”
Steve, half dazed from arousal, followed Tony’s suggestion. As soon as their hands moved and their cocks dragged together for the first time, a whimper broke from his throat and his hand’s grip tightened automatically, making both Steve and Tony gasp in unison.
“Good.”
The clock in the corner of the monitor rolled over to 9:04 and Tony pressed the "Join Meeting" button.
“Among other things. Another SHIELD Agent joined the conversation, mentioning something called Jericho. It was in the files too.”
Somewhere along the songs they’d turned to face one another, the darkness allowing Tony to be bold, he wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck.
“I said to come in. Didn’t I?” Tony snapped then winced. “Sorry. It’s just--”
People always assumed that would transfer to the bedroom, as well.
It was only when he floated past the first rooftop that he realized he was flying. He caught his reflection in a building window across the street and saw the truth of it, even if he couldn’t believe it: there were wings sprouting from his back, large white expanses of feathers shifting in the wind to support his weight. It all happened in a moment and then he focused back on Tony, Tony who was starting to get worryingly close to the ground. From there, instinct won over, pushing away all of Steve’s questions. It had to be the serum, some unexpected consequence that hadn’t manifested until this all-consuming need rushed through his body to save Tony.
Nobody in any of the laboratories or universities seemed to notice a thing, taking notes diligently as he summarized the presentation. At any moment, he expected Steve to pull back; he built towards the edge, the ring tightening as his balls drew up. He waited for Steve to relent, flip the switch, his whole body tensing and that only shifted the plug, and he stumbled over his final words. He heard applause on the other end of the screens, silence from the auditorium. He wondered if anyone else was watching in the auditorium today, they hadn’t been when he started but maybe now they could see the beads of sweat along his brow, watch him grip both sides of the podium and try to catch his breath. It didn’t matter if they saw or not, he was about to fall over the cliff. It seemed like this time Steve didn’t want to make him wait, wanted to play him like an instrument on stage, watch Tony’s head fall forward as he came with a shuddered breath into his pants.
Back out in the hallway, he handed Tony the clothes and watched him wince and hiss as he pulled on the sweatpants. Steve’s fists clenched as he walked around the man, providing him a bit of privacy by separating Tony from the hallway with his body. It wasn’t until he stood behind Tony that he saw the slashes across his back, thin lines but deep. Steve shuddered at what instrument could make that incision.
“Steve!” Tony managed between laughs. “Stop!” He tried to push him away, down towards the foot of the bed–towards where he’d
By the time he finished sorting out his clothes, Steve was in their living room, grabbing leftovers out of the fridge and putting them into Tony’s briefcase. As Tony walked towards the door, Steve met him, handing him the briefcase with a peck on the lips, the domestic scene a complete foil to the erotic display from a few minutes ago.
Anthony nodded. “This was a entirely surreal adventure.”
His to take care of.
Tony shot him a half-smile. “Been hard to sleep since you ran out here to find a cure for my, what did I call it? Narcoleptic subspace.” He smiled and Steve met it with a smile of his own and then Tony’s eyes fell to the box in his hands.
Tony nodded, walking through the doorway, a gust of frigid December air hitting him in the face. The cold weather didn’t seem to matter to the fans that had been waiting outside since the early morning hours the night
“You’re so--” Tony turned him, hands gripping his biceps.“--Tense. Get the camera and follow me.”
the one at risk of getting pulled through space and time.”
“Soon! Very--I can’t direct it though. I thought I’d be able to turn it away from him but I can’t touch it at all. I need a way--”
“So, what do you think?” Tony asked, because why else would Steve have followed him here if not to talk tactics?
Anthony smirked, it looked to Tony like he was gathering his bearings from Steve’s confession. He sighed through the smirk. “Someone’s got to defend it, since you seem keen on throwing it away.” He knocked their shoulders together like Steve had before, and didn’t move away. Instead he looked at Tony, expression serious. “How sure are you about this?”
The reactor was heavier than Steve expected. A thick, braided cable ran from its base into the casing cut deep in Tony’s chest. Steve cradled the device, intensely aware of the power he held in his hands. His heart pounded so loudly he was sure Tony could hear it. He wanted Tony to hear and know the effect he had on him.
“Don’t make me physically remove you.” Steve’s fists clenched at his sides, he wanted to shake this man far more often than he should.
“Good boy.”
Their counterparts flushed, and Tony laughed, extricating himself from Steve’s arms to walk back over to the portal. “I guess this is where we part.”
This time, he again smelled the lingering scent of Tony. It was almost stale, as if it’d been hours since he walked these halls, but the sour didn’t tinge as much, and there was no whiff of Obadiah Stane by his side. Alone, Tony’s scent lightened with tints of honey.
“Have you--” he moaned as Tony chose that moment to roll his hips. “Gah--Can’t think when you do that.” Tony’s chuckle was deep and satisfied, and went straight to Steve’s cock. “Didn’t think you thought about this at all,” Steve managed.
“Yeah,” Tony agreed from the other side of the desk. A two-on-one assault. “We’re just protecting you from yourself.”
They were still crouched in the remnants of the cage, Tony shaking again, completely naked in front of him. Steve whipped off his jacket and held it out towards Tony, but Tony didn’t move to take it. He just stayed frozen; the only movement he was made a continuous tremble.
“Somewhere magical.” He smirked.
“I’d apologize”--Steve bit his lip, just briefly, then continued even as his cheeks pinkened--“but I find I kinda like the thought of distracting you.”
“What is it?” Steve couldn’t help but ask as they descended.
. The praise shot straight to Steve’s core and he sucked in a slow breath, keeping his hands steady as he snapped the device back into one piece.
“You’re insatiable.” Tony, sprawled out next to Steve, rested his chin on his palm as he turned onto his side. “I bet I can find a way to wear you out. Roll onto your stomach, let me see your ass for a moment.”
Steve arched into Tony, breath panting even as Tony pulled away, eyes narrowing as he waited for an answer.
Steve pulled Tony closer. “Are you concussed?”
“People love our sass.”
“Oh nothing. Just make sure your phone is on you.”
“You wouldn’t have us any other way.”
“He saw,” Tony barely managed through a raspy breath.  “The footage from the Tower security. He watched it all. Figured out our pattern. The mask didn’t matter.”
“Crap,” Steve reprimanded himself. The man that got on the train next to him shot him a glance but a mumbled swear was next to normal when it came to New York’s subway system. He hadn’t meant to flirt with Tony, though. Yes, he was an attractive omega, Steve wasn’t blind. But he was obviously in need, and what he needed
Tony caught him looking. He knew because he could sense his gaze even behind the sunglasses. Could see Tony’s squint in his periphery; it was pinned on him, watching him watch the cuffs.
“Based on the data provided in the files provided by SHIELD, the helmet along will keep their powers at bay.”
A bullet whizzed by, very intentionally in front of his trajectory. Tony followed it back to its source because only one man on the ground today was that precise. Perched atop a skyscraper was James, leg up and sniper resting across it. Pure relief flooding Tony, stopping in his throat and breaking free as a sob. Between breaths he was halfway across the sky and flying straight into the man’s arms.
“Professor Rogers is not one of those people.”
“Well, yes--” Steve began.
Tony smirked and shook his hand. “That wasn’t what I brought you down here for, though. It was just along the way. Just here,” Tony said.
He clenched his hands into fists and turned towards SHIELD. In the end, it was no decision at all, he promised Tony they’d wait, so they would wait.
“You’re not up for another mission.” Coulson didn’t have to ask, he knew Steve’s schedule, knew what he’d have to research on SHIELD’s behalf.
He tried floors at random, but none of them led to Tony. All that planning, for nothing.
Tony nodded, already wondering what he could possibly be planning.
Tony paused, hands clenched in the fabric over Steve’s heart, their faces only inches apart. His eyes flicked down to Steve’s mouth. Tony didn’t demand, not this time. Instead, he tipped his gaze back up to meet Steve’s and asked, “May I?”
“Huh?” Tony managed, hips jerking forward under the onslaught of stimulation. Steve pushed him back onto the seat.
“Can we help you?” the man asked, friendly and somewhat curious. Exactly what Steve was hoping for.
“Steve, shut up.” And then Tony leaned in, closing the space between them with a soft press of his lips against Steve. He pulled back after a second and sat back letting out his breath. “Yes, you still stink to high heaven.” Tony shot him a smirk, the first he’d seen since they left the Tower that reached his eyes. “So it’s a good thing I still think you’re pretty.”
“I need you.” Tony twisted the pliers one last time, then smiled. “To do something for me.”
“It’s hard to determine which battles are yours to fight, and it’s not my decision to make.”
Tony’s fingers fumbled over it, pulling it from the wood. He held it out and Steve had to tug a little to get it out of Tony’s grip. “You know what this is, yeah?”
“Do you think possibly--?” The pieces started to fall together.
“My bludgeon guard?”
He was only halfway through the presentation.
Steve opened his mouth, then closed it again. He pressed his lips together, almost pointedly not looking towards the sky. When he finally spoke, it was tight, strained. “I guess there’s similarities and differences, between both worlds.”
Thanks for reading!
If he had, would he have burned the Tower down to get to Stane?
“I have to go,” Steve whispered, and before Tony could react, teeth bit into the ample cheek of his ass, and Steve contradicted his own words by sliding a well-lubed finger into his ass and saying, “Put on your collar.”
Two weeks into the unrelenting summer heat, Tony invited them to the pool. It was a foregone conclusion before he even finished the question--anything to rinse away the persistent layer of sweat that stuck his t-shirt to his chest.
“Of course you do.”
The world disappeared; Tony was safe here, in the curve of Steve’s body, surrounded by nothing but him.
“We should.” Tony’s hand hit the box of chocolate at his side and Tony reached for a piece, holding it up for Steve. Warmth from Steve’s lips wrapped around his fingers, cutting off the chill of the wind.
He took a deep breath, trying to consider what to do next, and was hit with the familiar sour aroma. It was faint, but Steve would know that scent anywhere, it’d fixed itself into his sensory awareness right there during that moment on the sidewalk.
Tony stroked harder, a whimper breaking from his throat.
He was due at SHIELD and dressed in his tac suit, knowing Coulson would have a car waiting. It would take him to headquarters and he’d have a small window of time to achieve his goal.
Steve didn’t know how long he’d been napping, but the light that kissed his eyelids was softer than when he had first closed them, so it must have been a while. A slight rustle of clothing next to him let him know he hadn’t woken naturally, but the sudden increase in his heart rate meant it was Tony crouching down next to the couch. Steve kept his eyes closed, waiting.
Tony floated, even as Steve pulled away, his hands running up Tony’s back to stroke through his hair. “Hey,” he heard Steve whisper, turning his head to see him crouching by the bedside table. The leather cuffs were in his hand, a questioning eyebrow raised. The words from earlier circled in Tony’s mind and he could easily read the question on Steve’s face.
“But it belongs to your world. And now it’s back. And I'm here too” The conclusion left him with an intense chill of fear. “With no idea how to return.”
Steve nodded, moved back and let Tony lead them to the elevator. He pressed the button not for the lobby but for the crew floor--the kitchens. “They aren’t--”
“How’d you end up?” Steve was looking at him now, the intensity of his gaze almost a physical weight.
Tony hummed and told Steve how beautiful he looked, and it made him want to look at Tony, touch Tony. As soon as he had the thought his hands moved, curling around Tony’s cock and cutting off his compliments midway through. “Oh god, Steve, yes, that feels so good. Your hands are so big, fuck.” Steve’s hips jerked in Tony’s hand at his words. The way he felt under Tony’s touch made it hard to focus on Tony’s own cock, but Steve followed the pace that Tony set and soon they were both gasping and moaning, air turning hot and heavy in the capsule as they kissed.
James’ fingers kept their unrelenting tickling, both of them laughing as James leaned in close breath brushing against Clint’s ear. “Oh, I dare.”
“Come here.”
“Tony,” Steve whispered, unable to hold back, all the horrors compounding and Tony was at the center of it. This would be bad enough, if it was a perfect stranger, an enemy even, but to Tony. To

“Tony, this is a
“Brooklyn.”
“I’m...sorry.”
“Well actually only one of us is meeting him face-to-face.” Tony beamed.
Back in the limo, Tony’s words had sent a shiver down Steve’s spine. Now, surrounded by all these people, the memory alone sent a shock straight to his groin.
They didn’t have to wait long, as it seemed like the members were taking precautions and not interacting with anyone too long, or too closely. The sea of gazes moved along with the young men until they landed on Steve and Tony. It was only then that Tony heard whispers of people noticing them. Hummed recognition, a brief “Captain America and Iron Man,” but it was quickly disregarded as their Idols came nearer.
“Hello?” a hesitant voice broke in--Namjoon, Tony recalled. “Are you guys the shapeshifters? You’ve been out there for a while talking.”
Tony moved without warning, standing from the bed and coming over towards Steve. He sat next to him on the sofa. Steve could hear him breathing through his mouth as he turned towards him.
The elevator chimed. “...they’ll be upset anyway. I sent a goat instead of Iron Man,” Tony tucked his phone under his ear and headed for the kitchen. “I don’t care, I’m here in New York and-- Oh, Steve! You opened it. Pepper, I have to go.”
Silence hung in the air.
James’ hands tightened on his hips, thumbs tracing over his waistband, ducking under the hem of his shirt. He didn’t say anything, just held Clint’s eye.
“I think I may actually miss the snow, once we leave here,” Steve said, looking over the white covered grounds of Tony’s Vail cabin.
“You better not have grabbed the plum pie.” The voice was gruff, familiar.
should’ve worked on you.”
“That brings back that one time Steve and I roleplayed---”
Steve took a deep breath and pushed aside the phantom feeling from the memory of Tony sleeping beside him--more than beside him, practically cuddling--but it didn’t seem like Tony remembered any of it. When Steve continued to gape at him Tony tried again.
A wicked idea popped into his mind, and he reached around Tony’s ass, the tail of his chestplate still covering but there was room for Steve’s hand to slide under it, moving so that his fingers pressed the undersuit into his crack.
“Good aim,” Steve teased. “You missed my face.”
Tony hummed, looking at him from the corner of his eye, a faint blush crossing his cheeks. “Maybe.” He pointed a finger in Steve’s face, wagging it. “If you’re good.” Steve tugged on Tony’s finger, making him laugh and grab Steve’s hand to pull him along. “Over here is the stuff my parents collected during my father’s involvement with the Manhattan Project.” There were plates of sheet metal, some wiring, none of it that looked like much to Steve but apparently had something to do with one of the most famous weapons projects of all time. Even though he had no idea what he was seeing, it carried with it an aura of importance, and Steve really wished he could focus on it but a part of him was still focused on trying to think of a way to tell Tony the truth. Tony was here, showing him private, intimate details of his family, and he still had no clue who Steve really was.
“Are we already missing two?” Tony asked Steve, whose eyes narrowed.
Forty-eight hours ago Steve had no idea it could be like this but now he rolled his hips up to Tony’s hand and hissed, “Yes,” into the darkened confines of their sleep capsule.
God he hadn’t tasted enough of the man, hadn’t ended enough of their arguments with heated embraces–
They finished in twenty minutes. The distraction did nothing to eradicate the phantom feel of Tony in his arms that morning. When he’d still been under the haze of sleep Steve had tugged Tony close because he’d felt so warm, there in his hold. Behind the helmet, Steve knew there was a wild head of curly brown hair. Steve had felt tickling at his nose as he nuzzled in the strands. The cold hard lines of the armor hid the lithe legs that had run along his own in the artificial morning light of the dormitory capsule.
“Hey, it’s okay--” he held his hand up, trying to stave off Steve’s panic. “I’m okay. About to be on my way home.”
The words hit Steve like a lightning bolt, landing in the back of his chest behind his heart. The collar in his hands, it hardly seemed like enough now, but it was everything he had. He wrapped it around Tony’s neck, fitting it loosely but secure. Held. Tony was already on his way there, eyes glossing over and grin slack with pleasure.
Tony put his hands up. “It’s nothing like that! I hadn’t considered it before, I swear, and now I have. Blame it on the multiverse travel-induced concussion.” Agitation tightened his throat. He caught his counterpart’s gaze and let the truth of his words show. “You know I’d do anything to be with the ones I love, because you’d do the very same.” He held Anthony’s gaze until he nodded and then Tony continued, “But I will not, ever, hurt that man or any of his counterparts that may exist in any multiverse. You
Death.
Steve bent down to kiss Tony solidly on the lips, and he smiled dopily at him, leaning into his broad chest. Happiness radiated from them both, and with the way Steve was gazing at him, Pepper was sure she had no real reason to be concerned.
Tony waited.
“You would say that, America.” Tony smirked, eyes dancing under the lights of the mustelid display. “But trust me on this one,” he leaned closer to Steve, making the hairs on the back of his neck stand up, as he whispered conspiratorially in his ear, “It’s all about the ferrets.”
Between panting breaths, Steve’s hand reached into the dip of the bed, feeling for Tony’s cock as he thrusted it against the sheets. The hand closed into a fist around the base.
Once he had felt this urge, and then it lay forgotten under the War and ice.
“Yes.”
Anthony rolled his eyes, and Tony chuckled at the familiar expression. “Let’s go find Professor Rogers.”
Happy heard the elevator doors open and looked up to see Tony and Steve amble in, still in pajamas, clinging to each other. Well, shit. He wasn’t expecting that. Not the two of them together, and not this early in the morning.
Tony felt the buzz under his skin, the arousal thrumming low, even as the plug stretched him wide. With every shift, he felt the suit brush against his cock, teases of fabric against bare skin. The plug allowed the seam of his pants to rub against his rim and Tony had never felt more taken care of. Steve leaned in again, another soft kiss then a wink, before he was ushering Tony out the door. “Wouldn’t want to miss your first conference call. Nine am, wasn’t it?”
Steve reached for his own spork and gripped it hard, mind racing for a lie about why he’d been staring, because he couldn’t tell Tony that he’d been distracted by his mere presence. For one, it was embarrassing and two, Tony would never let Steve live it down. “I was just marveling at your ability to get any food into your mouth between all those words you were chewing on.”
“Michael. He’s in Scotland for...a photoshoot and came by to visit. We go back to primary school.”
The alarms blared overhead, alerting everyone on the launch pad that time was running out. Steve pushed Tony towards the exit door but Tony was ready for it, the Iron Man boot materializing on his foot and fixing him into place. They glared at one another.
A whine spilled from Steve’s throat as he turned his head into Tony’s neck. “Jesus, Steve, you’re- fuck you’re hot like this. I thought we could make it till the end but- no, no, that won’t be happening.”
“Okay.” Steve couldn’t help but agree to that.
The wind hit his face like a slap but it didn’t take long, only a few strong beats of his wings, and he was under Tony, bracing for impact as the metal armor hit his arms.
And Tony was so good, even though his breath went ragged as parts of the armor fell away, allowing Tony to follow his order and slip his cock through the slit of his undersuit. The rest of the armor remained, and Steve could grip its shoulders, before Steve dropped to his knees before Tony.
“So you’re both geniuses then.” Steve looked back up towards Anthony. “Don’t tell him I called him that either.”
Tony could see it, and he didn’t know what was hotter: the image or Steve suggesting it; blood rushed to his cock. The idea of waiting here, fucked out, however Steve left him. Used, owned, claimed, desire flooded him as Steve bit at his collar.
So, he shouldn’t have been surprised when the plug started to vibrate, only for a second, just short enough for him to wonder if he imagined it but strong enough to make him gasp aloud. “Sorry, stubbed my toe.”
Reaching out, his hand hit an empty bed.
The rest of the emails he made it through with fewer platitudes, short and to the point with the endless vibrations distracting him.
speak English, even if it’s just every other word.”
“Yeah, I--” His words were broken off by the sound of the elevator chiming and the heavy steps of SHIELD agents rushing down the hall. “And that’s our cue to leave.”
He still hadn’t opened his eyes, but he could imagine Tony’s lifted eyebrow well enough. Of course he latched onto Steve’s final sentence. “If it’s not
“Whoa now. Overdramatic is an omega stereotype.” He shook his head
“What–? Tony we’re on our way to the estate upstate.”
Steve yearned to learn the scent unaltered, to know how it felt to be the cause of it--He cut the thought off, guilt washing away all the intrigue, all the reactive arousal. His body responded to the stimuli that was Tony, but the reality made him lock it down tight, deep inside himself. “Is there anything I can do?”
“It could be,” Tony couldn't resist muttering under his breath, and he wished he had more self-control than he did when both of their accusatory glares pinned him to the spot. “Anyway! Yes, Anthony is right, I am a lost multiverse traveller, shot here through a soul piece and looking for something to shoot me back to my reality.”
Tony’s hands had been resting in his lap and they clenched at that news. “So it wasn’t that he didn’t tell me, it was that he didn’t even know. After all that time. After all this.” He looked up at Howard’s collection. “I don’t know which one’s worse.”
Brown eyes met Steve’s from across the room. Tony smirked and Steve’s hand clenched helplessly around the red and gold ball.
technically morning, even if the sun hadn’t risen yet.
Tony sucked hard, swirling his tongue against the head, swallowing down as much as he could. Steve bucked forward relentlessly, barely letting Tony gasp in a breath between unforgiving thrusts.
Steve swiped his tongue against Tony’s fingertip before pulling back. “Maybe five more minutes,” he said, before another bolt of lightning cut across the sky, this time followed by thunder. “Or maybe three.”
Which he didn’t. Tony wasn’t his.
"Oh, Steve." Tony reached out and settled a hand on Steve's hip, leaning in. Steve let himself be drawn into another kiss, a proper one this time. "Now, that was a 'don't die in space, Stark' kiss," Tony proclaimed.
“It’s really impressive.”
There was no response.
Tony let out a huff and then melted into Steve’s chest. “I guess this is nice.”
There hadn’t been many amenities when he’d first moved in but after two years the apartment reflected Steve Rogers more. His dining room table was half mission report, half art studio, the fridge was stocked and the large laptop with a standard sized keyboard sat on the coffee table.
. Tony, quick and sharp and beautiful, narrowed his eyes in question and the expression just made Steve soften into an easy smile and run a hand down Tony’s thigh, wanting to touch him, assure him. The fact that he could do that now, allowed to know Tony this way sent a thrill through him, made all of it so much more important. “Guess we’re both going to have to be.”
tech, actually.”
Steve pulled him close, looking happier than Tony had ever remembered seeing him before. “Feels like Christmas,” Steve said, pushing Tony against the door.
Tony pulled his t-shirt off, revealing smooth skin wrapped around tight muscle, and the web of scars that surrounded the arc reactor. Steve wanted to reach out and touch, but he wouldn’t. He wouldn’t touch, or move, or
Tony started to thrust into the air above his hips now, spurred on by the way Steve’s neck smelled and how he tasted when Tony ran his tongue against his pulse.
Steve pulled back the denim to reveal a pair of tight, white briefs. "Oh." The camera clicked rapidly. "Your ass looks divine in those."
“It is an ancient artifact,” Tony replied. “But I expect and prepare for SHIELD to be as frustrating as possible. I don’t expect them to be in the bodyguarding pop stars business.” Overhead, the endless holiday music rang through the PA  system and Tony did his best not to clench his jaw. The holidays were a fraught time, regardless of work, but something about having to be in such close proximity to Steve set an itch under his skin unlike other years. It wasn’t a bad itch, just one that left him hyper focused on the way Steve looked, and spoke, and breathed.
Steve stretched out on the floor, nestling his bare skin against the plush rug. He still tingled from head to toe after three mind-blowing orgasms. Every time his eyes caught sight of Tony’s hand for the next week, he was going to have to push away an erection. Those talented hands; Steve wondered if he’d be able to handle the feel of Tony’s mouth or his ass, when even the thought of them made Steve’s spent cock twitch inside his briefs.
But this was more than just relaxation.
“You’re doing so well,” Steve murmured into Tony’s ear. “You look stunning, all dolled up and shaking. I bet you want me to unzip your pants right here and take care of you."
Anthony exhaled through his teeth. “Ha! This is so, very me. You sure you weren’t just avoiding the chance we'd say no?”
Except, when the stairwell door broke open on the floor he’d last seen him on, it was abandoned. Pulling in a deep breath through his nose revealed nothing but cleaning supplies and the adrenaline of late night business dealings.
Steve’s eyes fixed on Tony but he wouldn’t look up to meet them, head hanging low, strands of clumped hair obscuring his face. There was a nasty bruise on the side of his torso, his hands were splayed on the ground before him, helping him stay crouched in the small space. Each of his nails were bloody like he’d spent a long time trying to claw himself out.
