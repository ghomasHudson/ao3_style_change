Steve let out a small contained laugh, looking away before facing Tony again. Tony cocked his head to the side as he watched Steve’s expression change.
“Stark. Rogers.” Before the two men could directly address their issue, Fury’s voice filtered in through their earpieces.
Steve knew it would be awkward working with Tony again, but he tried to make the best of it. He thought maybe they could repair their relationship somehow, maybe becoming friends again at least.
“Okay everyone. I want you to meet the newest member of our team. Steve Rogers, a decorated military vet who now studies law at Columbia University.” Fury reached out across the table in Steve’s direction. Everyone else in the room turned to stare at him.
However, Steve wasn’t sure what to do; calling Tony out would only give Obadiah a reason to commandeer the Synergy program away from him. Steve took a deep breath before scrolling through queued sequences from past simulations to correct some of the inputs to at least stop the device from shaking.
Bruce struggled against Thor, eventually breaking out of the hold with ease, which would have been more difficult for anyone else who had been subjected to one of Thor’s hugs.
“But it’s totally okay if you splooge right away. Practicing is just one of the fun parts.” Tony smiled at Steve who made a face at the word “splooge”. Tony leaned inward to kiss him on the cheek before climbing on top of him to straddle his legs.
Steve reminded himself.
. Please arrive at Stark Industries in the Research and Development department at 8am. There will be a security pass for you in the lobby.
A splash of water coupled with riotous laughter hit Steve in the face as he opened his eyes to find Tony splashing water in his direction. Steve grinned as he splashed Tony back before trying to grab him to pull back to his side. Tony barely struggled as he let Steve drag him through the water, straddling Steve once more as he took a moment to caress his face before kissing him.
Tony attempted to retain his smile but he couldn’t stop his emotions from overrunning his composure; no one had ever been this direct with him before, especially after a serious fight.
“And yet, he sprinted out of the penthouse like I was toxic waste.” Tony had turned his head to only retort his friend before looking upward at the ceiling.
“Doesn’t look good?” Obadiah interrupted, “Dr. Banner, please, I’ve never pegged you to be the one peddling false hopes.”
much shit to do today.” Tony grinned at Steve as he filled his plate before pouring a cup of coffee.
“I guess we can divide and conquer.” Tony walked past Steve to point to the living room, “why don’t you see what’s in the living room and I’ll hang out in here. Just separate things and I’ll take a look at them when you’re done.” He patted Steve on the shoulder before returning to the box he was rifling through prior.
Tony lingered at the entrance, amazed with how great Steve and Peter looked together. He watched them as Steve showed Peter the rest of the recipe for dinner. Steve turned slightly, noticing Tony in the archway watching them.
“You and Peter are great together, Tony.” Steve offered, yet his expression was timid.
“Tony?” Steve finally asked as he continued to rub.
“I’m sorry, Steve. It was the way you asked.” Tony let out a self-satisfied sigh as he finally got Steve to look at him.
“We got it, Tony,” Steve answered as Tony finally settled down, “thanks to you.”
“Aren’t you going to say something?” Steve had meant for the question to sound like a joke, but it came out more distressed.
The following morning, both Tony and Steve were on their way to the west coast in Tony’s private jet. The jet, which Tony explained to an especially skeptical Steve as soon as they took off, was piloted by a computer, allowing Tony to focus on his amateur spying skills. Both men were in the main cabin, strategizing about the event. The main cabin was divided into two symmetrical areas divided along the long axis of the plane: each side had two seats surrounding a table. The back of the cabin contained a mini bar packed with some pre-prepared meals. Steve had flown first class once before but flying in a private jet alone with Tony was on another level he still had trouble fully comprehending.
After a second, Gamora’s hand looked to be on the verge of squeezing the trigger, sending Obadiah into a wave of panic.
Steve still looked uncomfortable, but Tony continued. “Look, Steve…” he paused, “I mean it when I say I want us to be friends…I really do…” He nodded as he stared back intently at Steve while also trying to tell himself that.
Steve’s eyes widened. “What?”
Rhodey motioned for them to follow him as he rolled his eyes. “Come on, you two. You’re going to make my head explode.”
The question sent a sharp pain through Tony's chest. He sat rigid in his chair, clenching the armrests with both hands before straightening up. He attempted to compose himself but Obadiah's unwavering smug expression and willingness to aggravate him at every opportunity was over running his composure.
Tony tapped on the top of the car before looking back at Steve. “I’ll talk to you later, Rogers.” He gave Steve one last reassuring smile before sliding into the car.
“I say this out of love and deep respect because you are one of my dearest friends,” Tony began with a deep sigh, “but slap my phone like that again and I’ll throw you out too, Banner.”
“…all I know is that Thanos wants the device but he’s jamming it on purpose…that’s all I know, I swear.”
Tony hopped off the bed in a huff. “Yesterday, I had to help you to the bathroom
“It’s nice for you to join us, Stane.” Thanos walked up to Obadiah’s chair as he struggled.
leave, Tony.” Steve repeated, his tone the severest Tony had ever heard it be.
Tony groaned even louder. “That sounds like the
, this is probably more on Steve than you. Maybe he was embarrassed? I don’t know him that well, but my conversation with him at Thor’s party suggested that he wasn’t the type to take things too casually.”
Bucky finally sighed loudly. “Fine. I’ll let him know you were here.”
“Do this again, or I’ll have to trim the team down,
Steve hung his head low before exiting the kitchen.
Steve sighed as he realized that he couldn’t back out of the trip. He told himself that maybe he might be able to get some alone time with Tony on the yacht.
Tony reached over to give Bruce a semi-hug with his free hand. “Banner, I’m just giving you a hard time. Where are you planning on romancing the lovely Ms. Romanov?”
Steve pulled out of Tony, but rubbed himself against his body a bit longer, kissing Tony slowly for some time before flipping back onto his back. He panted a few times as Tony snuggled up against his body, hugging Steve for a minute or so before Steve turned onto his side, turning Tony with him so that he could spoon him from behind. Steve laid his hand on Tony’s chest, feeling his nipples as he kissed his neck.
Peter nodded as he jumped up from the bed, grabbing his things. Tony waited, smiling to himself before he followed him out of the room.
Without more comment, Tony coughed again as he got up to walk back to the kitchen to look through more boxes. They remained silent for some time until Steve found another box with a diary hidden underneath a mound of papers.
Steve sat near the edge of the furniture; he felt like scooting closer toward Tony but was hyper self-conscious of how it would be perceived. After all, Steve was still embarrassed about the whole kiss situation at the event.
Steve laughed. “I’m okay, I ate earlier—or well, unless you want to?”
Sam mimicked his friend’s sense of annoyance. “Yeah, okay, Steve.”
Bruce sighed heavily. “Maybe…”
“It’s all right, I can see myself out.” He tried with a faltering smile.
“He’s good…we, uh, went to the New York Hall of Science Sunday. Thanks for asking. Rhodey’s watching him for me tonight.”
“I…w-will you excuse me for a second?” Steve jumped up from the table before Tony could answer him.
Tony used his body weight to push Steve onto his back. He then climbed on top of Steve, straightening up as he rocked his hips forward. He leaned forward slightly to rest his hands on Steve’s chest. Steve’s body instinctively rocked upwards into Tony’s, but he tried to restrain himself once he realized he was rolling his hips faster.
“Ready?” Steve asked, pointing behind himself at the plane.
Steve took his time sitting up in the bed before responding. “Of course, Tony. I don’t think you would have asked me to marry you if there was even a possibility that I would say no to adopting Peter. You care about him and only want the best for him.”
“Did you also jam up the device at the precinct?” Natasha asked.
“He does it a lot!” Peter happily chimed in.
Despite how worn he looked Clint managed to shuffle around a little in the bed to get more comfortable.
The two waited a bit before proceeding further through the space; they were still taking in the sight of the foyer of the penthouse. Having worked not too far away from it, Steve had fantasized once or twice about what his lab mate’s penthouse actually looked like, but whatever he had imagined in the past had done the real thing a severe injustice.
“Oh, well…Tony…”
“J.A.R.V.I.S.,” Tony called, “I need to disarm this thing!”
Steve smiled to himself as best as he could considering that he still had Tony in his mouth. He felt a hand run through his hair, prompting him to move his free hand up Tony’s front, feeling his abdomen. Tony pushed upward into his mouth, but Steve could tell that he was trying to restrain himself. Tony’s body felt tense, but Steve tried to convey that he was fine by glancing upward at Tony as much as possible, continuing to feel his body.
Tony stared back at him, too shocked to really answer. His mouth bobbed open a few times as he tried to comprehend Steve’s reaction.
Tony ran a hand through Steve’s hair. “Steve…” he tried but was too overcome with emotion.
Tony perked up at the question. It should have been a good sign that Steve seemed interested in his personal life as it related to Peter, but Tony was still hung up on Steve not being completely honest with him.
"Steve said he was well enough to go to the thing tonight."
“Fuck it.” Tony let out as he walked over to pick up his phone. He tapped the call button to phone Steve.
serious, Rogers.” Tony firmly added.
“Sorry about that.” Steve appeared about five minutes later, taking his time sitting down. He looked solemn, but not upset.
“That’s too bad. I wonder what Thor thinks.”
Happy had driven Steve and Tony back to the Tower. Tony had been completely silent in the car, and he continued to be equally silent in the elevator. Steve could tell something was bothering him, but he wasn’t sure how to approach it without upsetting Tony even more.
Natasha waited a second or two before addressing Clint. “How are you feeling?” She asked softly.
“Steve,” Bucky started, “we already talked about this, but you gotta talk to Tony.”
“I’m going to take a shower,” he then turned to shoot Steve a conniving grin, “feel free to join me if you want.” He added with a wink before walking to the bathroom that was connected to the bedroom.
Tony thought again. Tony moved his head away from Steve who continued to kiss him. He couldn’t say his thoughts out loud; they had just confirmed the status of their relationship.
Natasha stepped forward as if she were about to slap Loki again which caused Loki to fidget in his chair as he continued.
Also, learning that his lab partner had gone out of his way to defend him in front of Obadiah had been certainly unexpected, but of course Steve had only done so as a loyal team member. There’s no way he was interested.
“You hadn’t said anything since then, so I thought it was off the table. I’m glad it’s not.” Tony looked at Steve before moving inward to kiss him. Steve eased up and kissed him back.
Steve’s remained steady; he only gently freed himself before patting Tony on the knee. He swiveled around in his chair to slide over to his usual console. Tony watched him for a brief moment before rising out of his chair to walk to his console.
Tony sighed. He looked away from his friend, trying to find something interesting to rest his eyes on; he wasn’t sure if he should tell Rhodey about last night. However, after letting out one more sigh, Tony turned slowly to face Rhodey who now looked concerned.
T’Challa let out another jolly laugh before patting Tony on the shoulder. “Of course!” He then turned to a degree as his voice lowered, “my sister informed me about the work you all are wanting to do with Synergy while here at the resort…”
“I’m not better than anyone I know, and I haven’t gotten to know yet. Just human.” Steve was serious as he retorted his friend’s otherwise kind statement. He hated being the center of attention and any egoistical behavior that came with it. It was more or less the same with being called “Cap”.
Tony had to prevent himself from expressing amazement at Steve’s offer. He was sure he definitely looked goofy trying to act cool in front of a crush.
May nodded, conveying that she knew what Tony was referring to. “Really? That hasn’t happened in a while…”
Steve remained silent, knowing that Tony was referring to the time Obadiah accused him of sleeping around with Tony before they got close. However, the sudden shift in Tony’s tone was jarring; he told himself to wait a moment or so before responding.
Bruce and Tony were walking through one of the glass corridors after one of the team’s weekly Project Synergy meetings. Tony had been avoiding Steve most of the morning and during the meeting; he was still too nervous to ask him over for dinner.
Steve furrowed his brow. “I don’t know. Fury ended the simulation after you left.”
Steve sighed. “I forgot that had I told him before coming out here that I wasn’t looking for a relationship…but I had said it because he thought he was the reason why Sharon and I weren’t seeing each other anymore…”
Steve’s eyes widened with fear, terror, horror, dread, practically any synonym one could possibly think of as soon as he recognized J.A.R.V.I.S.’s voice.
“It’ll be stable enough for a small attack…so it’ll still emit the reactionary blast,” Bruce added, “but like I said, if Thanos is planning for something big, we’re risking the device’s stability.”
again.” He ominously ordered.
Tony shook his head as he walked away from the balcony. “It’s been a week, Banner. He should have reached out. He knows how screwed up my relationship with my dad was.”
Tony frowned at Steve before getting up to get water for the both of them from the mini bar.
“Don’t worry about it,” Tony kept his hand out, “I’ll show you how.” His expression returned to its usual shade of confidence.
“We’ve been looking through your company files and we’re very impressed, Mr. Lieber. You seem like someone we could do business with.”
Tony was standing in Bruce’s lab, examining a projected image of whatever they could surmise of Thanos’s weapon.
“No, we didn’t sleep together, Sam.”
Tony nodded wordlessly, too stunned to really respond as he let Steve kiss him again. They kissed each other for a moment or so before Steve gently pushed Tony onto the bed. Tony held onto Steve as he scooted them both up the bed to meet the headboard.
Loki’s comment made everyone pause as they watched him then turn around to stare at the projection. After a minute of painful silence, Loki turned to face the group again, but his expression looked panicked.
He turned around to face the middle of the office, nodding. After a minute of barely listening, Obadiah looked at his watch, noting the time passed in what he thought was an unnecessary conversation.
Tony heard Bruce groan loudly. “I know you’re making a joke as a way to alleviate the serious conversation we just had so I’m going to let that one slide.”
“Last name?” A technician asked as she acknowledged Steve.
“I’m going to go out there, gather intel on the buyers then toss Obie out on his ass.” Tony answered coolly, eyes still fixed on the data.
“Of all of the people I’ve had the opportunity to work with, Tony Stark is perhaps the most fascinating.” Thor offered.
“Tony. Thanks, but—"
“Tony…” Steve whispered, feeling the tension between them finally let go. He placed a hand on Tony’s face and the other on his hip, massaging gently as he pushed Tony up against the back of the sofa.
He ran a hand through his hair. “It’s interesting. I can tell you that.”
“It’s strange that Obie would be in contact with low-level buyers. He would have to prove to the board that he has a big enough client base to redirect the company…” Tony grappled with himself but deliberated aloud for Steve.
“Tony’s been doing a great job and you know all of this is only because
back to the bed.” He motioned with his hands to demonstrate Steve’s failed excursion to and from the bathroom.
“What, Tony?” Pepper asked.
“Mr. Stark, I’m concerned about Peter.” He began, staring disconcertingly in Tony’s direction.
Tony looked up at Pepper. “Obie sent him one, of course.” He looked away, “how the fuck I am going to make things work with Steve if I can’t even keep it together in front of Ty? I couldn’t even make things work with you, Pep, and you’re the most understanding person I know.”
Tony, suddenly realizing that he definitely messed up again, jumped up from his seat pointing toward the café counter.
Steve shook his head. “No, I miss you, Tony.”
Tony frowned as he glanced back at Steve again. He really didn’t need this bullshit on top of everything else.
“Of course, I would love to watch Peter!” Tony glanced briefly at his phone to ensure that he had indeed called the right person.
Tony grinned before reaching downward to unzip Steve’s pants. He felt around a bit, eliciting a sharp inhale from Steve. Tony looked at Steve, lingering before he finished unzipping his pants. He rubbed the back of Steve’s neck a bit longer before adjusting his body so he could lean downward near Steve’s crotch; he could feel Steve’s heart beating wildly.
“I don’t see what’s so funny, you two.” Steve huffed as he looked back and forth between Tony and Peter with his arms crossed.
“In a couple hours. Should get us back in time to get a few hours in the lab.”
“Oh my god…I want to feel you, baby…” He let out as he pushed himself upward into Steve’s body.
So, in an effort to free himself from the negativity, Tony turned on his usual charm that he saved for press events and mingled. However, with each conversation, in due course, Tony’s mind wandered back to his relationship doubts.
Loki sighed; he looked downward at the floor before looking upward at Tony. “Dr. Thanos. He used to work here ages ago.”
letter, Sir.” The computer’s usual unemotional tone managed to add emphasis to the word “mailed”.
Steve’s expression turned curious as he stared at Tony, clearly thinking that Tony was about to say something more profound.
Steve exhaled. “We were…she died the year after I started law school…she had breast cancer.”
Tony nodded as he continued to rub his forehead; he could feel his chest constricting with pain.
The team had gathered to visit Clint at Mount Liberty Hospital. The group looked on from a window in the hallway as Dr. Strange and some nurses whirled around Clint’s bed. Strange stopped to talk to a nurse before walking out of the room to greet the team.
And despite how serious the situation indeed was, everyone else took a moment before nodding or making small sounds of agreement with Clint’s statement as Natasha maneuvered the helicopter away from the island again.
"Do yourself and Mr. Rogers a favor. Your inevitable break up will only hurt the company once you go into one of your famed bouts with depression. We need to have you clearheaded and focused." He reached over to pat Tony on the shoulder and Tony flinched from the contact.
Tony knew he would only drag Steve down further into his misery, and Tony cared about him too much to do that to him. Especially when Steve had his whole life ahead of himself and would certainly find someone better suited for him.
Tony smiled back as he let her take his hand. He could feel her sincerity. “Okay, then. Now you gotta get Rhodey to force Bruce to discuss his personal life.” He joked, hoping it would mask how he felt on the inside.
Tony sighed. “Rogers, it’s fine. We just need to switch some of the wiring.” He nudged Peter in the side to get him to agree with him.
Bruce ran over to him, trying to get him out of the lab. Tony struggled, trying to get back to Steve, but Bruce practically manhandled him, dragging him away from the lab as Tony continued to scream for Steve.
As he was slipping into bed, Tony’s phone buzzed on his bedside table. He flipped it over to see that he had received a message from Steve.
Natasha stared at him for a moment or so before it became obvious that he was unwilling to cooperate.
“Why can’t we meet in the lab?” Clint was practically sitting on one of Natasha’s legs as the two sat on top a small desk in the corner.
“Tony…” Steve uncrossed his arms as he approached Tony, eventually meeting him at the elevator. He stopped right in front of Tony before gently placing his hands on Tony’s arms. Tony freaked out internally as he looked slightly upward at Steve, not entirely sure what to expect.
One awkward moment, however, stuck out in Steve’s mind. The board had decided it was necessary for the team to document their entire project from start to finish, so Steve was unfortunately caught in a few candid photo ops. The awkward moment happened when Bruce snapped a quick photo of Steve and Tony, standing right next to each other with Tony lightly touching Steve on the shoulder.
Bruce nodded slowly. “…I’m really sorry, Tony. But maybe you and Steve should talk first before doing something drastic…” He offered quietly.
Tony sighed as he turned a few degrees to look at Bruce before turning to face Fury again. “It’s only been built once. Could have been a problem with the circuity.”
Tony nodded.
And now that Steve was about to begin a new time sucker embodied in the form of Project Synergy, the two friends were particularly adamant about getting Steve out before they would see or hear little of him. Sam had started a job at a new law firm and could only hang out on the weekends and Bucky could only visit occasionally. Also, Bucky was in town for just a short while and Steve
Tony sighed before hanging his head. “Yeah, well, at least it’s for a better reason this time…” He joked.
“No offense to Dr. Banner and his capabilities, but you’re the best brain we have on this project, Stark. I think Rogers would benefit learning a thing or two from you.”
Tony smiled back. “It’s only great because of the company, Rogers.” He held his glass up for Steve to cheers and they clinked their glasses together. Eventually, the two waded through a comfortable silence, just one of the many they had prior till now that you can only truly have with someone you trust or are beginning to.
Pepper watched Tony eat another piece of fruit. “…I talked to Obadiah about Loki’s termination…” She volunteered, her voice lowering as she inched closer toward Tony.
Tony groaned as he sat down on a free, undamaged patch on the floor, staring at the diary. It was more than cosmic cruelty that Steve had ended up in the hospital while the diary essentially came out unscathed.
Tony, in order to stop himself from kissing Steve back, placed a steady hand on Steve’s before freeing himself. This time he looked upward and stared intensely, trying to plead with Steve.
dad couldn’t even get the device to work, so he never had the chance to prove otherwise.” Tony countered sharply.
Steve laughed as he cracked open the can. “I don’t even know what that is.”
Thor nodded. “Of course. My brother lives for drama.”
Peter gave Tony a thumbs up before tapping on the tablet again. The main component of the robot flashed a light before blinking steadily. It lifted itself up slightly before slowly roving toward Steve.
“Thanks, Pepper.” Tony stared at his phone for a second or so after Pepper hung up. He smiled as he rejoined Steve in the lab.
“…but,” Tony clapped his hands together “this thing
Steve joined Tony at the console as they listen to Fury finish explaining their assignment. His heart started to thump with excitement.
He laid down, turning over onto his back as he listened to the shower run. Steve thought about the way Tony was looking at him which elicited a warm feeling inside. He turned his head a bit to look at the bathroom door, thinking about Tony showering, imagining Tony standing naked in the shower, touching himself while possibly thinking about him. The feeling prompted by his imagination grew as Steve could feel himself getting hard just thinking about Tony.
Tony nodded before looking away, feeling his face turn even more red as he could feel Steve staring down at him.
“Hey, Peter,” Tony injected into Steve and Peter’s energetic conversation, “have you shown Steve that comic you’ve been working on?”
Sam laughed nervously. “Of course, we talk about you, Cap. We care your well-being.”
“Tony…to be honest, I’m really embarrassed…” Steve thought back to the dream he had about Tony before waking up in his bed. He took a deep breath, before looking upward to face Tony who looked sullen. Steve had never seen him look so sad before.
Tony sighed loudly as he pulled out his phone to connect to J.A.R.V.I.S.
Tony inhaled as he covered his face with his hands. He peered through his fingers before lightly slapping his desk.
Thor sighed once more. “I know that the owners usually hold gatherings—”
Steve turned his head to look slightly away from Tony before addressing him again. “I think we would be doing a disservice if we stop the project.”
“Steve!” Peter interrupted, tugging on Steve’s pants, “we brought a salad!” Peter pointed to the dish Tony was holding.
“Steve’s a really good cook.” Peter added causally, his eyes focused on his game play more than anything else.
“…are you guys getting back together?”
Bucky laughed as he patted Steve on the back a few times. “Yeah, but you’re better at other things, like I wouldn’t survive if you didn’t cook for us. And you’re a great artist and shit.” He shrugged with a grin.
He decided that now wasn’t really the time to tell Steve how he felt. All of the shit that had happened over the past week or so was too much to process and he didn’t want to cause any more tension with Steve over a series of misunderstandings.
“…I stopped drinking so much…because…I sort of went on a…bender…after we broke up…”
They said goodbye to each other before Steve heard the call end. He sighed to himself again, resting his hands on his hips before opening the door to find Tony still sitting on the edge of the bed. Steve walked into the room, but he stayed near the door.
“I’m just paranoid, I guess.”
An unexpected force nearly launched Steve out of the bed. He woke up instantly, turning to the other side of the bed to see that Tony was awake, out of the bed, and feverishly dressing.
Tony turned to look at the rest of the group behind him before stepping closer toward Steve and Thor. “We have that board event coming up this weekend, so we should act as if business is usual, okay?”
“I mean, I miss being with someone, you know, it’s nice having someone to come home to after work or whatever—.”
But as soon as he opened the door to the bedroom, he found Tony sitting upright in the bed, surrounded by unfurled and furled rolls of schematics.
“What’s up?” Fury asked as they entered the space before walking up to the main helm.
Tony yawned as he looked around the room before turning to look directly at Steve, placing a hand on his chest as he moved inward for a kiss.
“I can shower in the guest room bathroom next to my parents’ room and you can take the one in here.” Tony fished out an outfit and grabbed a towel before heading to the bedroom door.
"Am I late? I thought this meeting didn't start until 12:30?" Pepper asked as she sat down at the table next to Tony, not only confused by the time of the meeting but also by Tony and Obadiah glaring at each other.
“Well that makes you a better person than the rest of us, Cap.” Steve could always count on Sam to lighten the mood, especially when Bucky spiraled into one of his overly protective stints.
Tony nodded before carefully shuffling Peter around so he could scoot closer to Steve. He moved his chin forward to kiss Steve. Steve smiled as he kissed Tony back before settling.
Tony worried to himself, groaning again.
“I feel like I could never get comfortable…maybe it was because we couldn’t see each other as much.”
Steve looked away from Tony as he finally let Bucky drag him back to the dance area. He had been watching Tony the entire time during the ceremony and ever since the reception started, but he told himself that he needed to relax and let Tony come to him when he was ready.
The team was standing in a suite Tony had created to test out simulations. Fury was above them on a landing, while they positioned themselves in arena-like area below, with Fury leaning against the railing to look downward at the team. Steve was standing near Tony, while everyone else, in their pairs, was huddled at the other end of the arena.
Holding onto Tony’s wrist, Steve pulled him close. He slowly dragged his hand along Tony’s wrist to his shoulder then to his face, cupping his cheek gently. Tony inhaled sharply as Steve closed the gap between the two of them by moving his face closer toward his. Both men closed their eyes as Steve leaned downward to kiss Tony, drawing him nearer with his free hand while the other stroked Tony’s face.
Steve smiled back, nodding. “Just let me know when you want me, and I’ll be there.”
“Barton—well Barton, what
Tony looked up at Steve; he was sure Steve could read how shocked he was, thinking Steve was only there to end things between them.
“—if you keep moving back and forth like this you might end up scratching the car,” Steve waved Tony off to finish his statement, “we’ll show you what to do.” He then lightly caressed Tony’s arm to get him to relax.
“Okay, why not.” Steve answered as casually as possible.
Tony chuckled. “Sounds like a spy thriller.”
Steve nodded wearingly, but he managed to smile at Bucky’s encouragement. Bucky patted him on the back once more before rising to walk back to the kitchen, now talking about their plans for that early evening with Sam.
“If it’ll make you feel any better, I’m asking you as your team leader, and not as—well you know.” Tony continued to smile which finally settled Steve.
“I have to be there at 8am. Wanna stick around and drive me to ensure I get there on time, dear?” Steve smirked. Bucky rolled his eyes while Sam chuckled.
Sam scoffed. “Are you serious, Cap? You should have stayed. It’s so obvious he’s being polite like you like.” He got up from the table to head toward the living room, laughing loudly again.
Tony nodded slowly. “I’m sorry, Steve. I’m just trying to talk about you and me, that’s all—”
“Bureaucratic nonsense.” Steve answered with his best stage confidence, which earned a flashy grin from Tony.
“You know, Natasha asked me the same thing.” Steve peered at the two as he took another sip out of his beer. He wondered if he should be worried that everyone kept asking him about Tony.
Although it had been clear since that night that their relationship had progressed into something more, Steve noticed about a week ago that Tony was still too awkward around him, often finding excuses to get Steve to stay over at his place. However, Steve, learning from their previous bouts of miscommunication, finally told Tony late one evening that he didn’t mind it and actually enjoyed spending the night with him.
Something about the tone in Steve’s voice made Tony want to crawl into the deepest hole and die the most painful and loneliest death.
“But I do think it went better today. I think you and Steve might end up making a great pair.”
Sam made a small noise of disbelief as he squatted immediately into a defensive position, hurriedly looking back and forth, trying to find the source of this dispassionate, non-human voice.
Tony nodded, knowing full well that Steve was ultimately referring to whatever Obadiah was up to.
“What do you like to do in your class? I mostly sketch.” Steve asked.
“So, are you and Pepper still on the outs?” Tiberius calmly responded, staring directly at Tony.
Absolute silence fell between the two before Steve joined Tony at the balcony. He kept his distance, but he was close enough to Tony to keep his voice low.
Tony blinked a few times. His mouth popped open and shut close a few times as he struggled to figure out what to say. Sam only chuckled, but he was kind about it.
“Come on, Steve! It was just dinner.” Sam huffed.
“Nice job today, Steve. I
Steve continued to stare at him with concern. Tony wanted to look away, but he couldn’t; something about Steve’s expression felt strangely cathartic.
Tony gasped. “Fuck, Steve. I’m going to come…”
“Uh, but I thought I was working with Dr. Banner?” The statement morphed into a question as Steve looked at Bruce with a confused look on his face. Bruce just shrugged.
Tony leaned forward with another moan. He placed one hand on Steve’s chest as he continued to touch himself.
Tony took another deep breath. “It’s funny…” he looked at Steve before looking down at the box in his hand, “…when I saw you try this on when we went out to my folks’ house in the Hamptons, I knew immediately I needed to get it resized…I wanted to get it fixed after we got back…” he looked up at Steve again who was listening, but his expression had changed; Tony knew he knew that he was referring to the fight they had over his dad’s diary, “and I know I already apologized about this, but I’m so sorry about the diary, Steve…I know you were trying to help…”
“Yeah, and you should see the lab. I’ve never seen a setup quite like that before.”
“Careful.” Steve managed as he held onto Tony.
“What Sam?” Steve sincerely had no idea what Sam was trying to hint at.
Bucky shrugged. “You know him better than I do, but from the way I saw you two before you broke up and the way I see you guys now…there’s something…” he took a step toward Steve, “don’t give up just yet, Cap. Give him some time.”
“Okay, I’m rich, but I’m not
“Oh, I wouldn’t have expected that. That’s cool though.” Sam reached into the fridge to retrieve a beer for Steve who begrudgingly accepted it. He had promised his friend and he needed to follow through. Besides, he suddenly felt like celebrating anyway.
Tony nodded as he waited for Steve to finally get to door. Steve fumbled a bit as he tried to open it as if that was the first time he had ever unlocked their apartment door.
Tony inwardly whined.
Peter clapped his hands together with glee. “Deal!”
“I’m sorry, Dr. Banner, but it looks like the board’s wanting us to consider these options and they’re unfortunately leaning toward the open contract…”
“Tony…”
“Obviously, this is something you would like to keep.” Steve smiled back at Tony.
Steve was cautious of adding to the tension between Tony and Obadiah, but he couldn’t lie to Tony either.
Tony groaned. “No, Banner. First, it’s Queen
Thor hoisted Loki over his shoulder before walking over to Steve who was now standing upright, but still somewhat reeling from being smacked in the face with kitchenware. Loki screamed for Thor to put him down as Thor marched out of the building.
Bruce never let his smile fade as he turned around to exit the office.
Steve nodded. “Thank you so much, Dr. Strange. I don’t know what we would do without you.”
Loki rolled his eyes, thinking the message was probably another email from Thor checking up on him, even though he had been sent home with a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent for constant surveillance. He placed his sandwich down on the counter before walking over to the table, picking up the tablet and swiping to view the message:
“I mean, who could resist this face…” Tony whispered as he leaned even closer to kiss Steve.
Steve hummed to indicate that he had heard Tony, but he never broke away from the kiss. Tony swallowed a lump in his throat as he demanded himself to play cool and not tell Steve that he loved him.
“J.A.R.V.I.S.,” Peter began, “please inform Tony when he said we would leave for Malibu.”
“Damn, Tony. Okay, I won’t break into your office anymore.”
“Okay, whatever, Tony.”
“No worries, Mr. Rogers. Nice to see you again.” Mr. Beck stood up out of his chair to shake Steve’s hand.
He waited as Tony slowly looked up at him; his face was streaked from a few tears. “Peter’s parents died the same way mine did…”
The statement literally set Steve off guard, but then he grinned to recover.
Peter made another whiny noise as he glanced upward at Steve. Steve made a sad face as he recorded the score with his fingers.
Bruce shrugged the saddest shrug Tony had ever witnessed. “No, Tony. I can’t.”
Obadiah scoffed. “I’m only looking out for the company, Anthony. We need to keep our investors happy or there won’t be a Stark Industries after this. We must get ahead of this before the press does.”
“There’s an ongoing investigation, but that’s all I can say since this is connected to the government.” Tony answered.
They worked in not absolute, but near silence for the next few hours.
“It’s okay…” Tony finally let out. Even if Steve had just been all over him because he was drunk, wouldn’t that be a good sign? Tony considered it. He attempted to weigh the pros and cons, but Steve was making it difficult for him to focus.
Peter nodded quickly. Tony’s face twisted with confusion as he looked at Steve before looking back at Peter.
There was something more to the comment that Steve had trouble deciphering, but he let it go. After some minutes passed, J.A.R.V.I.S. informed them that May was in the lobby and on her way up to the penthouse.
Clint, who was sitting at the conference table next to Natasha, leaned into his friend’s personal space.
On top of that, Tony hadn’t been looking forward to being in the same room with his so-called surrogate father, Obadiah Stane. The two had been bumping heads lately, to say the least, and the last thing Tony needed to deal with was an unflinching Obie who thought he knew how to run the company better. Also, Tony was still too awkward around Pepper to have a normal conversation since their breakup last year, even when it came to discussing business. Nick Fury had been the only person in the interview process that Tony wasn’t on the outs with, which wasn’t saying much.
“You gotta relax, baby. It’ll hurt if you don’t.” Tony said quietly.
“Dr. Banner, I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“Hey, Mr. Beck!” Peter happily greeted as the boys watched one of their teachers approach their robot.
Steve wasn’t sure what to do. Should he touch him? Would Tony even prefer to be comforted that way given their current tension? They sat in silence with only the music playing softly in the background before Tony reached over to grab another record. Steve watched Tony turn the record over; in the corner was a neat signature. It was faint, but Steve could discern that the signature belonged to an “H. Stark.”
Steve shuffled around a bit. “Didn’t realize I was that easy to read.” He was smiling, suggesting he hadn’t taken any offence to Tony’s assertion.
Now Synergy was possibly being taken away from them and Steve had trouble trying to parse through his emotions as it related to Tony and the project. From their conversations, Steve knew that Tony would do his best to keep the team safe, but Steve never thought Tony would give up so easily. Something about it, along with not hearing from Tony all week, bothered him.
Bruce and Shuri nodded before the trio broke up to work in various places in the space. Before walking over to the table she usually stationed herself, Shuri rejoined Tony at the console.
Thanos kept grinning as he interlaced his fingers. “Just long enough until he delivers us the device. Then we’ll cut him loose.”
“Sure, I’m close with my friends, but it’s not the same, of course…” Steve trailed off as he cupped his hands together.
“You know what…” Tony started as his voice grew quieter, “you can help me with something that is more work-related…”
“How’s everything? Seeing anyone new?” Strange crossed his arms as he studied Tony, backing away slightly to look at him more directly.
Tony froze as soon as he recognized the voice. It was Tiberius Stone.
“I should have given these to you this morning before going in, but I was…distracted…” He never looked up at Steve as he handed him the tablet.
Tony sighed as he turned his head slightly to face Sam who was looking downward at his drink.
“...I talked to Peter about us…and he told me he really likes you.”
haven’t you managed to find out for me, Obadiah? Hopefully, this meeting will be more productive than the last.”
“Rogers, it’s fine. I don’t mind taking you. Actually, I prefer doing it so I can make sure you do your home exercises correctly.”
“I’m sorry I’m late. The traffic is bad.” Steve ran a hand through his hair that had been tussled a bit from having to deal with midday New York traffic.
Bruce rolled his eyes. “Steve looks good in everything.” He admitted clumsily.
“Of course, Tony. I’m not questioning you. I think we’re all just on edge.”
Tony had never felt so mortified in his entire life, and that was saying a lot. He had to steady himself by placing his hands on the table in front of him.
Everyone continued to stare at Clint before looking back at Thor.
Pepper inhaled deeply before answering. “You can make it work, Tony, by talking things through. I know how much you care about Steve. I can see that you two belong together…you just have to try.”
He sat there for quite some time before rising to get back down to the lobby and the reception. As he arrived in the lobby, he found Bucky waiting for him.
Natasha grinned before crossing her arms. She looked across the room to where most people were congregated. Steve followed her gaze, noticing immediately that she was looking in Bruce’s direction.
To: Erik Selvig (
As the elevator door closed and flew down to the lobby, Bruce and Tony stood in silence, both too weird to really comprehend the travesties that were their respective dating lives.
The hallway was really a glass corridor; Steve could see Stark Industries employees working in various labs along the hallway as he approached the conference room. Once he reached the door, he stopped briefly to regain his composure; he had never been so nervous before.
Tony nearly lost that edge as he willed away his thought, trying to focus on Steve. He reached downward for his cock, squeezing his eyes shut, thinking about coming all over Steve than telling him that he loved him.
Steve scrunched up his face. “Why can’t we try tonight?”
of your team members have been seriously injured. And both, I might add, on company property.”
Bucky’s facial expression had barely changed, but Tony could feel the unmistakable tension between the two of them as they stared each other down.
“On the 2
“Rogers, save it.” Tony angrily interrupted motioning toward Steve with one hand, “not only do I have to deal with you snooping through my things, you’re insubordinate on top of it.”
“I’m usually better at holding my balance…” Steve muttered, finally getting up to sit down in his seat. His face was rosy but that was mostly from feeling Tony squeeze his body before letting go.
“I probably would have ignored you then, Rogers.” Tony scooted closer toward Steve to wrap his arms around his waist. “I’m glad I met you now. Yeah, my past was pretty wild and I’m amazed that I came out more or less okay, but I wasn’t ready to be with someone like you…”
“W-what’s going on?” Obadiah gasped.
Steve hung his head, sighing to himself again. “…I understand, Tony…really I do…and I shouldn’t have raised my voice and I should have chosen my words more carefully, but, Tony, of all the things to bring up? And, I know I already said this, but you know I’ve been seeing Sharon—”
Peter held up his Tony Stark original wristwatch. “Not yet. I have ten more minutes.”
Tony tasted whatever was on the spoon, considering Peter’s statement. “I actually said
“Tone! Nice work.” He slapped the desk.
Bruce shook his head. “I don’t know, but we can use the device to generate some equipment to find it. Natasha has the equations for trackers S.H.I.E.L.D. uses.”
Tony mouthed the words to the song as he watched the computer run the numbers for the program. He swayed from side to side in time with the music, motioning a bit with his hands. Tony then half crossed his arms so he could rest his chin on his fist. As J.A.R.V.I.S. finished with the diagnostic test, Tony noticed something off about the sequences.
“But with caution of course. Remember the last time, Gamora?”
He slid his phone into pants’ pocket before plopping down into his desk chair. He finally decided that he would ask Peter if they could have dinner with Steve.
This was the first time they had seen each other in person since the night Tony had made a move on Steve. Serendipitously, Tony had gotten caught up at Stark Industries with a few projects that needed to roll out before leaving for the wedding, and Steve also needed to finish some prep work for a few cases before they left, so neither had been at Stark Enterprises for some time.
He slapped Steve hard on the back, disregarding that Steve had been in a major accident. However, Steve barely flinched. Tony instinctively moved toward Steve to pull him away from Obadiah.
“Uh, no…why?” He almost asked in a rattled-sounding voice.
Steve rolled his eyes as Bucky laughed. “Well you can go out
Steve carefully removed the Synergy device from the bag before placing it on top of the bedside table. He pressed a few buttons before addressing Tony.
Tony stared up at Bruce as he sighed again with grief. “No. And I really don’t plan on it.”
Shuri pushed herself away from the table to retrieve her work bag. “Also,” she produced a chip from the bag to show to Tony and Bruce, “I looked through those schematics your father had drawn up and created a backup plan with the failsafe codes embedded.”
idea, Rogers.”
Clint squeezed his eyes shut as he appeared to try to recount the night. “…it was super late, so most of the labs were empty, but…” He trailed off before continuing, “…I remember seeing someone in the lab next door…I didn’t recognize him though…”
“I should check on Banner.” Natasha motioned with her glass toward Bruce’s general direction before walking away.
“Hey, Bucky.” Tony walked into the foyer, “what’s up?”
“You know, I can already tell I’m going to enjoy working with you.” Tony offered as he crossed his arms. He stared at Steve for a second longer before spinning around to face the console.
After arriving back in New York from Berlin that evening, Steve, Tony, Bruce, and Rhodey met up with the rest of the Synergy team and some other Stark Industries employees at a nice restaurant and bar Tony had rented for a private gathering.
Tony smirked as he crossed his arms. “The picture I have of you is almost complete. You’re innocent on the outside, but a little dangerous on the inside, right?” He continued to grin at Steve who seemed to be playing along.
He groaned to himself has he covered his face with a pillow.
Steve took a deep dramatic breath, causing Tony to side eye him. “Jesus, Rogers. Don’t be such a big baby.” Tony joked before wrapping a hand around Steve’s waist to pull him in close.
Steve laid down on top of Tony who then pushed upward, letting his hands travel down the length of Steve’s backside. Steve moaned as he pushed sharply down into Tony’s body. They kissed each other before Tony turned his head to the side to address Steve.
He sighed once more as he placed the tablet he was holding on the console. “I was originally given the command to do whatever I needed to do to get into the lab, but I couldn’t do it…Loki must have attacked…Mr. Barton after I left that evening…”
Peter looked up, wiping his eyes. “Can…Steve stay, too?”
After a moment or two of thinking about the night his parents died, Tony moved his hand away from Steve to rub his forehead. He counted to himself before inhaling then exhaling.
Tony glanced at Steve with a confused look, making it obvious that he didn’t remember the teacher’s name. However, he regrouped quickly as he reached out a hand to greet Mr. Beck.”
Tony sighed as he kissed Steve before plopping down onto the bed to lie next to him. “Yes, Rogers. I would tell you if I weren’t.” Although Tony wasn’t entirely sure if he would but said it anyway so that they could have a stress-free night and not discuss all of Tony’s relationship trauma.
Bucky sighed; he looked behind himself before facing the bed. “Sam should be here any minute. He had a deadline today and his boss is being a jerk about letting him leave early to see Steve.”
Thor nodded. “You will understand when you’re inside.”
“You’re better than you think, especially with the Synergy device, Rogers.”
dismantling anything, Obie, until all the options have been considered.” Tony sharply corrected.
Steve sighed. “Nothing. It was just something Bucky said to me.”
Tony coughed before answering. “Yeah, it used to belong to my mother’s father…been in the family for years…”
“Is there an issue with your schedule, Sir?”
“…uh, having Steve around means a lot…and he’s great with Peter.” He casually shrugged.
“It is 8:10am, sir.”
Steve nodded again, closing his eyes as he felt Tony gradually push downward into his body. As Tony kept rocking forward, Steve closed his eyes as the feeling between them escalated. Steve felt like he could feel every bit of Tony; he tried to restrain himself, but his body was overreacting from Tony’s movements.
…Tony wiped his eyes before shielding them as he cried some more.
. Sorry if that makes me sound naggy.” Bucky huffed as Sam nudged him in the arm again. “Also, stop jabbing me in my arm, Sam. I’m fully aware of how annoying I’m being right now.”
Steve watched the console in front of him light up with data. Holographic images of the event unfolded along with information regarding the location of the rest of the team. He felt a hand on his forearm.
“I really care about Steve…a lot. I feel terrible that he got hurt because of me…I-I just…” But Tony couldn’t continue; something about talking about Steve out loud like this was debilitating.
Tony squinted his eyes as he let Obadiah’s words shoot painful jabs throughout his body. Maybe Obadiah was right; Tony couldn’t even say out loud that he loved Steve.
Unfortunately, the mood at the party was a bit somber; after learning about Loki’s arrest, the team was now doubly anxious to protect the Synergy device. As a precaution, Fury had some of the team stay behind in case there was another incident.
Steve let Tony pull him toward his body; he tried to smile back but was now too embarrassed.
“Shit. My jacket, shoes, and keys are still out in your living room, aren’t they?”
. Tony snickered to himself as he jogged to catch up with Pepper.
“What? Rogers and Stark??” He then nearly rose out his chair, “am I the
“What? What’s wrong?” Tony asked, looking terrified.
“How’s the resort?” Clint wedged himself between Fury and the screen.
He felt like hiding underneath the blankets and covers; there was no way he was going to be able to get Tony out of the apartment without confronting Sam.
“Yes, Tony.” Steve whispered, closing the gap between them.
“Project Synergy.” The title flashed across a projection on the wall behind Fury. A diverse group of faces looped in the background as the title continued to fly about. The images moved from the center of the room to the side walls as scenes of various types of natural disasters, human ailments, and catastrophes filtered throughout the room.
“What time do we need to leave again?” Steve asked through a yawn and a stretch.
Tony leaned toward May as soon as Peter was out of earshot. “We had a situation last night…”
“I want Obadiah to resign. I don’t trust him around Project Synergy.”
Steve thought.
Tony opened the door to his dimly lit bedroom, walking up to the edge of the bed before falling over with a loud groan. He turned over onto his back to look up at the ceiling, thinking about Steve and the dinner. Strangely, his brain then translated that into the conversation he had with Pepper a while back about the fallout of their relationship which made him groan even louder.
the splash.”
Steve nodded as he struggled to wipe his mouth before lying on top of Tony as he kept feeling himself. He felt Tony rubbing his back, pushing upward into his body, before pulling his briefs down. Steve let go of himself to pushed back, moaning as he felt Tony’s leg now up against his exposed cock.
“So, uh, “Clint coughed, but he was grinning at his friend, “you get that date with Banner yet? You two were working late last time I was conscious…”
Steve let out a pleasant-sounding noise as he began dragging Tony’s tank up his body—
Peter was in the process of packing some books and games. “Yep!”
As soon as they were left alone in the room, both Tony and Pepper met at the breakfast table. Tony lingered near Pepper who was still smiling at him. She then reached over to pull him into a hug.
Steve laughed. “Thanks, Tony. That sounds like fun. I’ll be there.”
“Good start.” Tony added.
Synergy, Barton.” Tony jumped up to the front of the room before Fury could answer him. “You know, the wave of the future, blah, blah, blah.” Clint looked even more confused than before.
“Okay then…” Steve started, staring back up at Tony, knowing full well what Tony was trying to get at, “if you’re so eager about it…why don’t you come in and find out?”
“Uh, Mr. Stark?”
“Rogers?” Steve could hear Tony calling for him in the bedroom, “are you sure?”
“You didn’t have to do that. What if it were a letter of regret?” Steve rolled his eyes as he accepted a full plastic glass from Sam, who was still grinning ridiculously.
“Tony, we’re close…there’s no denying that…I just want you in my life, that’s all.” Steve made sure to definitively punctuate the end of his sentence to convey his sincerity.
Tony tried to wiggle out of Steve’s grasp, but the latter was stronger than him. “It
Steve inhaled once more before shuddering; he gasped a quiet and unexpected “shit” before convulsing on top of Tony. Tony, after hearing Steve swear while coming, couldn’t help himself as he let go.
“So,” Tony clasped his hands together, looking intently at Peter’s principal, “how do I make this better?”
Tony nearly dropped his drink as Rhodey walked in front of his view of Steve, “Pep sent me over here to get you ready for the presentation. Are you ready or just daydreaming?”
Tony sighed as he took a second, knowing that he needed to remain calm. “Bucky, please. I really just want to make things right with him, okay? Please just tell him that I came over to talk, all right?”
“Oh wow, Tony. This is amazing.”
the one who broke up with me, so I don’t really understand why you’re acting like you want to fix things between us. It’s too late.”
Obadiah lingered before acknowledging Thanos. “We have one more closeout meeting with board before Anthony is officially taken off Synergy.”
Steve nodded again before turning around to walk into the living room, spotting a few boxes stacked in the middle of the space up against the fireplace. The living room had more than enough furniture in it, and there were a few paintings off to the side underneath a cloth sheet with one painting sticking out. Steve squinted to see that the painting looked to be a wispy depiction of a coastline somewhere. The room was also lined with half-filled floor-to-ceiling bookcases, with more books at the foot of the cases. There was also a record player in one corner, half covered in plastic with some records stacked next to it.
“…you have physical therapy twice a week, so, I’ll take half days on those days to drive you there.”
Tony woke up suddenly, complete with an unconstrained yawn. He glanced around the bedroom before noticing that Steve was nestled on top of his chest, still sleeping soundly. Thinking about last night, Tony smiled as he gently pushed his body into Steve whose leg was hugging his legs. Steve squirmed a little before making a few noises, signaling that he was in the process of waking up.
Tony chuckled as he posed thoughtfully. “Easy. Neil Armstrong.”
Clint and Tony seemed to tolerate each other, but it didn’t appear as if there were any hard feelings between the two. But Steve could sense that Fury was definitely putting up with Tony and vice versa. Natasha seemed to also tolerate Tony, but at times Tony appeared to tease her just to get a rise out of her. Yet, Natasha didn’t seem to take it personally, so Steve figured that she also knew Tony well or well enough not to take him too seriously.
“I’m trying to be that older, wiser friend…” Tony let go of Steve to wave his free hand around as he laughed nervously, “well, maybe not so much the wiser part…actually could we forget I said anything about the older part as well?”
“Hey!” Bucky had suddenly appeared at the threshold of the entrance to the kitchen. Sam quickly motioned for him to chill in front of Steve who was facing away from him.
“I’m going to make breakfast.” Steve walked to the door, opening it to relieve an excitable teenager.
Tony took his time looking directly at Steve. Not only had Steve accepted the invite, he looked grateful for it. Tony could hardly believe his eyes.
“Actually…” Steve continued, “I didn’t think I was your type, Tony…”
Steve held the diary out for Tony. “…I know you wanted me to throw this out with the rest, but—”
As they danced, Steve drew Tony close to his body; the atmosphere between them drowning out the ambient noise surrounding them. Tony placed a hand on Steve’s chest, caressing him lightly before looking up at him slightly as Steve simultaneously looked downward at him.
Bruce put his hands up in a halting position. “Okay, come on, Tony. You’ll thank me when you’re out in the field together. You may even get that date.” He grinned, wildly.
Instead of responding physically, the crowd’s murmuring increased as everyone looked around, confused by Tony’s command.
Steve nodded, taking another step toward Tony. He knew he needed to give him some more time, but he felt compelled in the moment to show Tony how much he cared about him.
Tony stared at Rhodey as if he didn’t understand the question. “What?”
“I love hearing from Sam, but it would be nice to hear updates about Steve Rogers from the man himself.” He motioned toward Steve with his beer before drinking out of it.
“…we should go about our days as if we don’t know about the list of sequences or how potentially dangerous Thanos’s weapon is becoming. Thanos will no doubt get suspicious and do something drastic if he thinks we’re onto him…until the device is finish, that may be our best bet.”
“Tony, I think if we get the robot to face away from us, we can disconnect the wiring from the back.”
After about an hour of awkwardly getting ready, Steve and Tony arrived at the restaurant. The host led them to their table which was outside on the balcony overlooking the water. Steve pulled out Tony’s chair for him, which caused Tony to turn red. Steve waited for Tony to settle before sitting down across from him.
Peter nodded as Tony paused. “…Steve told me he misses you…” He shrugged, not really sure how Peter would take that bit of information.
Steve let go of Bucky as he inhaled deeply. “They…I think…Tony and I…” He tried, but the image of the teddy bear laying in the bed of roses strangled his thought process.
Bucky eyed Steve before laughing again. He patted Steve on the shoulder. “Yeah,
naughty.”
They stayed like this for some time, but instead of going any further beyond light kisses, both feel asleep gradually, with Steve still on top of Tony whose arms were wrapped around Steve’s body.
Steve waited a second before leaning inward to kiss Tony. He felt Tony run a hand up his side until it met his neck, massaging him as they felt each other. Steve turned the two of them at an angle before gently pushing Tony down onto the bed.
“…he’ll make a full recovery. I’ve never seen anything like it…” Strange scratched his chin, clearly thinking deeply, “…those heat resistant panels absorbed most of the blast...still...its depth and size would have killed almost anyone else…”
Sam nodded as Bucky clapped his hands together. “Hey, let’s try to enjoy Sam’s last day of freedom.”
He couldn’t look back at Steve; he knew if he had he would have probably changed his mind and ruined their relationship.
Tony sipped gingerly out of his cocktail. He was perched against the bar counter with one elbow rested on the surface. Bruce had been rambling on and on about the algorithm, but Tony was barely paying attention; he was too busy watching Steve talk to Thor and Clint.
“You know how Bucky is. He’s a little overprotective. He just asked. That’s all. And I probably shouldn’t have told you that.” Sam grimaced as Steve sighed heavily.
Tony had to prevent his mouth from hanging open at such a blatant statement.
“…I also spoke to Dr. Selvig…” She concluded.
Tony’s practiced neutrality fell away as he immediately picked up on Mr. Beck perhaps referring to his relationship with his own dad.
Bruce took another moment before responding. “…Tony…I’ve never heard you complain about Steve before…”
Steve kissed Tony back. “Sorry, we had meant to have dinner ready by the time you were done, but we worked on homework first so we can take the rest of the night off.” He smiled over at Peter who nodded enthusiastically.
Bruce perked up as soon as Tony finished his statement. “Nice, Steve. You’re really getting a hang of the device.” Whatever tension he was feeling could only be broken by some good ol’ active scientific experimentation.
Steve gasped, having trouble trying to keep control over himself, as he pushed back onto Tony’s finger. Tony squirted lube on a second finger, entering that one in slowly as he used his free hand to hold Steve still. Steve moaned more as he felt both fingers, eagerly waiting for Tony to hit that spot again, reacting to Tony feeling inside of him.
Steve reassured him with a compassionate expression as he crossed his arms. “Well I care about you.”
"Bruce! Tony! I found a piece of the core."
As the test finished, the equations that had been previously incorrect were now operating normally. Tony’s face hardened as he tried to mentally resolve why the numbers had been wrong in the first place. It was a small enough anomaly but considering all the shit that had gone down when the device blew up the precinct, Tony figured he should take the device up to the penthouse to tinker with before getting ready for dinner.
“Uh,” Tony rested his hands on his hips, “you know being a spy is your
He told himself.

“Steve! The key! Do you have it?” Tony had grabbed the collar of Steve’s suit with his good arm.
“Yeah, of course, Tone.”
“So, what happens next?” Steve interjected, “will Peter need to take this class over?” He had placed a hand over Tony’s who grasped it tightly from his brief heated moment with Mr. Beck.
Peter rolled his eyes. “No...” Dragging out the word as much as possible.
Obadiah stopped Tony with an outstretched arm. “Anthony, good job anyway.” He sneered, making it clear that his tone was deeply sarcastic.
Steve nodded slowly, still waiting for Tony to finish his thought.
Tony laughed as he leaned forward to kiss Steve. “It’s fine. I haven’t done this in a while so we should take it easy for a bit as we get use to each other.”
He had been so wrapped up in analyzing the core through sketch that he almost didn’t hear Tony call for him.
“That sounds like a plan to me,” Tony added before pointing in Clint’s direction, “Barton, go with Thor and Romanov to S.H.I.E.L.D. We may need more eyes on Loki…I don’t buy that he’s telling us everything.”
Tony nodded again, feeling himself panic. “Uh…well…I’m definitely not seeing anyone else or even thinking about it…if that’s what you mean…”
Tony had hired Riri Williams as his research assistant about a few months ago after she completed her undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering from Columbia University. It seemed only right considering she was the one who had figured out early on that the chip Howard Stark had originally constructed for the Synergy device was actually a key that triggered the device’s emergency wiring. She was working on a few projects for Tony but the most pressing was now this documentary a film crew had contacted Tony about a while back.
Steve stared at Bruce intently. “I can’t leave him.”
“I’m going to have to contact Hammer to figure out this Thanos mess.” Tony said to Steve as he undressed before crawling into the bed. Steve nodded, doing the same.
“I’m so sorry…I screwed up…” he repeated, “I didn’t realize…I didn’t realize what we had until it was too late…I am so sorry….please forgive me…” He looked directly at Steve who also looked exhausted and emotional. Steve took a step forward, but Tony shook his head, trying to signal that he wasn’t finished.
“I’m sorry that you won’t get a good night’s sleep, Rogers.” Tony joked, trying to turn his head so he could look at Steve.
Tony cringed as soon as he spotted his pseudo business rival, Justin Hammer, greet him with open arms. Hammer was standing at the table he had reserved for them at an overly priced restaurant in midtown. Tony lingered a few feet away from the table, glaring at Hammer. Hammer stuck out his hand for Tony to shake who ignored it before sitting down at the table.
“What, Rogers?” Tony asked, unable to help himself from smiling.
, Rogers.” Tony seemed to be already in a state of feigned dismissiveness before Steve had a chance to answer him.
“Hey!” Steve and Tony turned around to see that Bucky was back out on top of the airstairs, waving at them to get their attention.
“…has created its newest tech, the Synergy device.” Tony then motioned behind himself as a holographic image of the device appeared above the stage. He walked around it as he continued to speak, and the device spun around and pulled apart in unison.
“J.A.R.V.I.S., run the sequence, please!” Peter shouted once more at the computer.
. Tony thought.
Steve laughed as he let Tony’s hands roam along the side of his body. “Like, seriously,” Tony started again, “weren’t you in the military? Also, Synergy?”
worse.” As Steve opened his eyes, he saw Tony smiling at him. Steve tried to smile back, but something about Tony’s expression looked pained. He forced a smile anyway.
“No. I just have better aim.” Steve nudged his friend with a lively jab as they grabbed their jackets before leaving the apartment.
About a week ago, while working late with Tony, Steve realized there was something more to his relationship with his lab mate, maybe something beyond a friendship. What that entirely meant, he wasn’t sure. He hadn’t told anyone how he was feeling, not even Sam or Bucky. He had always been this cautious; he wanted to explore where this was going first before jumping the gun.
“…I shouldn’t get into the middle of it…Shuri told me to stay out of it…but I feel like I need to say something…” Sam began.
The whispering set Tony off who then pushed upward sharply against Steve. His thrusts quickened with Steve’s as both men pressed against each other until both bodies began trembling. They continued like this for a moment or so before Tony could feel his body succumbing. He held onto Steve as tightly as possible without hurting him.
Tony perked up. He sat up straight, watching Steve before answering. “Rogers. I said it was fine.” He answered in a harsh tone which caused Steve to recoil somewhat.
Everyone chatted for a bit before the group began heading out. Tony lingered, staying behind with Bruce and Natasha. He watched Natasha and Bruce walk toward the exit together; Bruce noticed before nearly jumping out of the way.
Tony smiled as he semi-hugged his friend. “Thanks for that bode of confidence, James.”
Tony slapped his armchair, almost dropping her phone. “Pep!” He scrolled through the photos to find more information about the buyers. He looked up at her with a thoughtful expression.
Steve shuffled some more, but never really moved from his spot. “Okay…I haven’t…” he began.
Tony crossed his arms as Bruce continued. “…I was planning to tell you that I had told him, but I didn’t want to upset you more with the change in plans…”
, and Tony has volunteered his resources to help his kid win his school’s science fair. Some cute moments between father and son transpire, but also Tony gets ahead of himself which may or may not result in Peter’s project destroying the school’s gymnasium.
“J.A.R.V.I.S., what time is it?” Peter asked, still smiling and bouncing.
“Yeah, sure.” Peter barely let out as he hopped out of the car but was internally grateful that Tony had been right about the trip.
. You’re a mad scientist hell bent on destroying the world.
It took some time getting Steve out of the hospital, but Tony drove him to Stark Tower, setting him up in his bedroom before he drove out to Brooklyn where he picked up some extra clothes for Steve. Tony then picked up Peter who was excited to find out that Steve would be staying with them for some time.
“…because…you…broke up with me, Tony…”
Steve motioned for Tony to follow him to the table in the kitchen space. Tony waited for Steve to take a seat before sitting down, shaking his head at Steve's comment. Steve smiled at him as he waited and Tony felt even more horrible for what he was about to do.
I’m home! Can’t wait for this weekend 😊
He watched Peter slowly look up at him and smile a little, although it was clear that he was timid about being put on the spot.
Peter giggled as he hoped off Tony’s lap to pick up his notebook that had ended up on the kitchen floor. He vigorously flipped through a few pages until he found what he was looking for.
She nodded at both Steve and Tony, “Nice to meet you, Mr. Rogers.” She then waved her hand to have them follow her inside. “This way, please.”
The desk manager nodded before laying out the suite keys. Everyone moved around the desk to grab their keys as more staff employees appeared to guide their to their suites.
T’Challa smiled slightly. “It’s more than all right. I set aside some space for the team to work whenever you get a moment.”
“Banner? What are you doing back there?” Tony asked, genuinely confused.
“Uh, what?” Tony turned his body to face Rhodey after having been too caught up in snooping on Bruce and Natasha.
“…uh, so…” Tony sniffled a few times, squeezing his eyes shut as he tried to get himself to calm down. He felt a hand slide around his waist.
Tony shook his head a few times before answering. “Not really. I’m just stressed out per usual.”
Whoberis and Lupho looked at one another before exiting the room together, leaving Steve and Tony alone, both wondering to themselves how strange this whole thing turned out to be.
“Oh, yeah. First day jitters are a bitch.” Tony added as he walked back over to the console that had been on fire.
Neither one really addressed the other until it was time to leave. But both kept overthinking dinner.
“Tony, wait!” Steve held the door open before running toward Tony’s car.
The robot’s arm interrupted Steve by almost breaking the table in half. Steve and Tony rolled out from underneath the broken tabletop, spotting Peter who was on the other side of the auditorium with Ned.
Everyone’s body shifted to the side as the helicopter veered toward the island. As soon as it landed, Tony jumped out, running back inside Middleton’s main building toward the conference room. Bruce tapped on his tablet to watch Tony’s movement…
Bruce was standing near Tony as the latter tinkered with the Synergy device at a table. They were both in Tony’s lab late into the evening when most of Stark Industries’ employees had already left for home.
Tony and Steve had a good rhythm going until some of the figures appeared miscalculated. Steve could only tell because the device’s usual exciting color glowed strangely, shaking uncontrollably with each input. He had encountered this as a possibility in the algorithm and knew that if he kept entering in incorrect information it might jam up the device.
“The presentation would have been better if I had you up there with me, Rogers. You could tell everyone that the thing isn’t that bad once you give it a try.” He winked at Steve.
Tony nodded as he worked, but the robot began to spin around again almost bucking him off. Tony pulled the blue wires out which caused the robot to stop spinning and turn off, but the force of the last spin caused the robot to topple over. Tony managed to let go before the robot fell on top of his body. He rolled to the side as sparks shot out from the robot as it powered down.
“Come here.” Steve said gently to Tony, resting his hands behind his head.
“I was calling from the foyer, but it looks like everyone’s busy in here.” He teased before kissing Steve.
“That’s it.”
“…I’m-I’m really sorry about last night, Steve…that won’t happen again…” Tony started back up, “…but I wasn’t sure I would hear from you outside of work…you know since I can’t seem to keep my hands to myself…”
“Oh, I didn’t know you and Ms. Potts were close.” Steve responded. The statement sounded more factual than anything else, but Tony immediately clammed up.
“Briefs.” Steve quickly answered.
“Like I said. Don’t worry about it, Rogers.” Tony kept his back to Steve as he continued working.
“Okay, let me know if you need anything, all right?” Steve continued to smile.
Steve looked over at Tony, seemingly waiting for him to join.
The comment made Steve laugh as he let Tony walk ahead of him, and Steve laughing made Tony’s face turn red from how much better he was beginning to feel.
“We have an hour,” Tony continued, “before we really need to do some work, if you’re interested.”
Tony rolled his eyes before he looked at Steve. “Rogers, I’m not the one who said we were barely work colleagues.”
Steve smiled. “I thought you would be busy all day, so it’s really great to see you.”
Tony nodded. “That’s a good idea, Banner. But hopefully he brings one of his friends and not a date.” He joked, of course unaware of the magnitude of such a decision.
“Remember that comic book series Peter’s been working on?” Tony held the sheet out for Steve, “he told me he added you to it and wanted me to give it to you.”
A goofy smile attempted to assert itself across Tony’s face. He used walking over to a console and pretending to study some data on a tablet to steady himself before asking Steve about dinner.
Rhodey laughed. “He sent me a message last night that it went well and they’re planning for round two in the near future. He didn’t send you anything?”
“J.A.R.V.I.S., play one of my favorites.”
Tony finally remembered that that might be a huge and unfortunate possibility.
“This is great, Tony. What are the next steps?” Pepper had to tear herself away from gawking at the image like the rest of the board. She smiled sweetly at Tony which he appreciated; it gave him something to focus on instead of worrying about Obadiah trying to intimidate him.
The team looked at one another before slowly nodding or verbally agreeing with Shuri’s suggestion.
Youthful laughter finally woke Steve up. He opened his eyes, groaning; he had just fallen asleep about an hour ago. He sat up in the bed, finding Tony and Peter no longer in it. He yawned, hearing the laughter again, before taking his time getting out of the bed.
Steve grimaced. “S-sorry…”
Tony placed his tablet on a nearby console. “Do you think I should introduce them? Steve asks about him all the time, but I’m really not in the mood to have Peter meet someone I’m kind of seeing and then have things fall apart like they always do.” He sighed miserably.
The investor looked relived as she listened to Obadiah ramble on some more about the project. They discussed some other business items as Obadiah rode the elevator down to the lobby with the investor. He escorted the investor to her car, lingering as he watched her driver whisk her away down the street. Obadiah then looked downward at his wristwatch, smiling to himself.
“Would you like to meet one of Synergy’s finest?” Tony clapped his hands once as he addressed the crowd. Everyone cheered and clapped again as Tony motioned for Steve to join him.
“…wait a goddamn second…” Fury breathed, tapping on his earpiece again, “Hill, set up a video conference with the Synergy team, but I’m sending something to you in the meantime…”
Tony was in sitting his office, pretending to look through some documents Pepper had sent him that he needed to sign. He groaned loudly to himself as memories of the Hamptons house during his childhood kept popping into his head. The memories were then followed by the last argument he had with his dad before his parents died.
“Mr. Stark,” Peter’s teacher greeted Tony right away as soon as he opened the door to the classroom, “nice to see you again.” He gestured for Tony to take a seat in front of his desk.
Strange shook his head slowly as his grinned. “Tony, you would not be able to handle me.”
Peter shuffled around to get comfortable. “Is…Steve your boyfriend?”
“Jesus. That was a wild night.” Tony sounded harsh and weary, but Steve could tell that he was probably also grinning. He closed his eyes to steady himself before turning around.
“Oh my god, Tony…” Steve breathed, holding onto Tony tightly as their hard cocks rubbed up against each other, with Steve’s still inside his boxers.
“How can I help you?” The guard asked, trying to see past the package.
“…you have to promise me
“This explosion is all over the news!”
Tony stopped what he was doing, making a face at Steve as he slid to lie next to him. “Uh—”
Obadiah looked back and forth between the two women, hesitating.
Steve nodded as Tony spoke.
Tony held up a facial alteration device, just one of the few he and Shuri had constructed to test out before the press event.
“…I know we just started seeing each other,” Tony started; he looked downward before looking up at Steve, “…and I know we sort of already talked about this...but how are you so cool about me having dinner with an ex? I would be freaking out right now.” Steve could tell that Tony was only teasing, but something about the question seemed odd.
Obadiah grinned before laughing to himself. He crossed he legs before resting a closed fist on top of the table.
From the sound in Bucky’s voice, Tony could tell that he was being straightforward, although he was still irritated by their earlier exchange. Tony glanced at Steve before answering Bucky; he knew Steve would want him to be civil.
Steve shook his head as he limped past Tony, motioning for Peter to follow him to the kitchen. “It only is if you don’t know what you’re doing.” He winked at Tony before giving Peter some instructions on how to prep their pizza.
He walked over to one of the dressers, opening the top drawer before continuing. “If he asks, just tell him I went with the plan.” He chuckled as he turned around with a huge sheet of paper.
Steve glanced over at Tony who was fidgeting a little but managed to settle into a comfortable stance with his arms crossed. Steve remarked to himself how handsome Tony appeared, but this time he didn’t reprimand himself for thinking so.
Tony rolled his eyes as he followed Steve out of the conference room.
Steve thought with determination, turning his computer on to check emails before picking up a task that he needed to finish before lunchtime.
Steve smiled at him, but then turned around to face the stove. He heard Tony shuffle around the kitchen before settling at the island.
Steve reassured himself.
Steve looked past Tony as he took a deep breath. He then looked directly at him, drumming up the courage to sound as sexy as possible.
“…hey, Sam…” Bucky’s tone dropped as he walked slowly into the kitchen to perch himself against a counter.
“Of course. It’s perfect.”
It had been painfully obvious from the time the two had first met each other that both Natasha and Bruce were attracted to one another. Yet, neither one admitted it. Tony, with the help of Rhodey from time to time, would tease Bruce about it, but would also try to give him advice. Tony appreciated how cautious his friend was; he wished he could exercise the same judgement when it came to relationships.
Steve inhaled as he took a hold of Tony’s hand and squeezed gently. “Sure…that would be nice, and I know how you feel...”
Bruce chuckled. “You are one of my closest friends, Tony. So, don’t act
Tony straightened up, looking at Steve before rushing out of the room. Steve glared at Thanos before following Tony out.
different.”
Steve sucked on him for a moment longer before letting go. He then laid down on top of Tony, humping his body, letting out ragged gasps in between.
Tony took in a deep breath; being with Steve was definitely what he wanted, but he wanted to take things slower than he was apt to do.
Tony walked through the lab as J.A.R.V.I.S. ran a list of items that hadn’t been irreparably damaged from the explosion. He walked around for a few minutes before he spotted something J.A.R.V.I.S. had missed, seeing something poking out from the debris.
Tony laughed before posing thoughtfully. “Yet, I was right, wasn’t I?” He reached over to mess up Peter’s hair, causing Peter to groan again.
Steve nodded as he kissed Tony once more before Tony led them to his bedroom. As they entered the room, Tony kissed Steve, dragging him to the bed. The force of the pull caused Steve to fall on top of him, but they hardly missed a beat as they continued to make out, the energy between the two of them becoming more passionate with every move.
Steve nodded as he rubbed Tony’s arms. “That’s okay…I don’t mind doing this…”
Tony, without really considering the consequences, seized the opportunity as he thought back to the memory of Steve saying something similar to him a long time ago.
a stalker—Well, that’s unless you want me to be.” The statement came out more flirtatious than Tony had intended but that didn’t seem to bother Steve either.
“Let me know when you get back to your place.” Tony asked softly.
“Tony.” As soon as he sat down, Steve reached over to pinch Tony’s leg, but he was laughing.
Tony waited a second or so before sliding his phone back into his pocket. He walked up to the nearest console to finish his work.
He sighed as he pinched the bridge of his nose. “Don’t we need him to do all the legal shit? Why would hanging out in my lab help him with that?”
“Yes…” Steve answered, wondering to himself if he should continue, “has…Tony done this before?”
“Let’s check out the rest of this party, shall we?” Tony kept grinning at Steve before heading toward the door.
Steve nodded before turning his head to kiss Tony. Tony kissed him back, slapping his ass again, kneading it with both hands before settling on Steve’s hips.
Tony crossed his arms. “If it’s all right with his mom, then it’s fine with me.”
As soon as he entered the last set, the vibranium core glowed as the device generated the parts needed for the machine. Everyone in the room huddled around to see the device create the specs.
“Tony?” Steve walked into the bedroom, “I’ve been looking everywhere for you. I forgot how big your place was…I thought maybe I missed my chance to talk to you in a non-work setting.” He shrugged, smiling as he put his hands into his pockets.
Bucky then leaned against a counter, smiling at both Tony and Peter before looking directly at Steve.
“And this is my brother, Loki!” Thor clapped the shoulder of a shorter, but thinner looking man who had walked past their huddle. He winced as soon as Thor grabbed him and practically forced him against his side.
Steve pushed his body more into Tony’s. “Ah. Yes,” Tony started as he began to wake up fully, “I guess it is morning.”
“…Steve…I should have told you this before….” He gulped, struggling with what he wanted to say.
Fury shook his head. “No time for jokes, Stark. I need to end the simulation. We received a call from Doctor Strange; he’s running a medical clinic in Harlem and he’s come across some mysterious virus that his team can’t seem to wrap their heads around. They’re hoping the Synergy device could assist with generating some more equipment and supplies to support the staff.”
my brother. I’m adopted and it was clear from the very beginning that he was always our father’s favorite.”
“Tony…” Steve turned red again, looking away.
“Yet, we haven’t had any issues. Rogers is excellent with the device.” Tony kept grinning, thinking back to watching Steve work with the device in the hospital room.
“Well, well, well. I’m finally having a nice lunch with Tony fucking Stark. Lucky me!”
Steve scrunched up his face. “Okay,” he then patted Bucky on the shoulder, “I’m going to find Tony.”
had multiple orgasms in one setting before?”
Steve nodded as he followed Tony who made sure to say goodbye to the appropriate people before quickly marching out of the lounge.
“Okay, we get
Tony pulled a clicker out of the inner pocket of his blazer. He smirked in Fury’s direction who only crossed his arms as he rolled his eyes.
Steve’s body felt tight as he moaned softly.
After speaking with Natasha, Tony had everyone meet him in the conference room while Natasha had gone back to S.H.I.E.L.D. to question Dr. Selvig, and Pepper had proceeded to go about normal company business in order not to alarm the rest of the company about Dr. Selvig’s arrest.
Steve smiled down at Peter whose eyes shone with glee. “You’re working on a comic? Can I see it?”
“Uh, where do I need to be?” Tony asked quietly.
Tony walked in a group with Bruce, Natasha, Rhodey, and Pepper. He looked around as they approached the reception, trying to avoid Steve as much as possible. The live band began playing while the bridal party ushered out to the middle of the space to dance.
Tony nodded slowly as he leaned up against Steve. They swayed for a few moments longer before Tony let go of Steve, feeling Steve take his hand again as they left the space and out the venue before walking toward their suite.
“Rogers, keep score. I can already feel this getting heated.” He joked.
Tony shook his head as he slowly sat down on the couch, hyper aware of how close he would be to Steve.
“Stand by, Rogers.” Tony then read the sequences off for Steve.
“Nice to meet you.” Loki responded with a sly smile. Something about it felt strange, but Steve couldn’t quite place it.
“Stark. Rogers.” Fury’s voice appeared suddenly in both Tony and Steve’s earpieces, “we need the both of you at S.H.I.E.L.D., ASAP. We got Thanos.”
Obadiah whined to himself.
Steve nodded back again, taking his time approaching Tony. “Tony, I understand how you feel, but please also remember that you’re amazing…” he smiled at Tony as he took another step toward him, “you’re a great dad,” he took one more step forward, “and a great friend and teammate, Tony.”
“Goodnight, baby. J.A.R.V.I.S., lights, please.” Steve felt the bed shift a bit, as the lights in the bedroom dimmed, knowing that Tony was sitting up in the bed still working with his bedside table lamp on.
the doozy for you all this evening.”
Steve shook his head a few times. “…no, I really think I did something else…”
As soon as Tony approached the lab, he slowed down, straightening himself out before entering. Upon entering, he found Bruce standing next to a console, patiently waiting for him.
“Thanks, Steve!” Peter bounced around, trying to give Steve a hug, but he was too excited.
“As I was saying before, Stark Industries is teaming up with a government division called S.H.I.E.L.D. to test new technology that will assist the populace on the ground. No longer will the average citizen have to wade through bureaucratic tape to see change.”
Bruce shuffled back and forth on his feet; Steve could tell that Tony’s decision to bring him instead bothered him also.
"Anthony! Come in." Obadiah energetically motioned with his arms for Tony to join him at the table.
“Tony, if you do this…” Steve paused.
Steve shook his head. “No, it’s okay, Tony.”
Everyone at the table looked at each other quickly, however, Tony kept smiling at the reporter.
“I…really appreciate that, Steve…I love you, too…”
Everyone nodded back as Tony tapped on his earpiece again. “Romanov, it looks like we’re in a tricky situation. Stand by and we’ll meet you guys out by the helicopter.”
Tony nodded, somewhat relieved that the government was planning to pick up Synergy despite Obadiah’s efforts.
Tony lingered before gently breaking away.  “Ah, well…oh, you shaved your face!” Tony awkwardly motioned with his hands to draw an invisible beard around his own face, “the uh, beard was kind of growing on me…”
Steve laughed to himself. “I don’t care. We’re a team.”
As Tony sat off the side of the bed to remove his shirt, he heard Steve exclaim “oh!” before laughing to himself.
Tony groaned, pushing faster as he came into Steve. Steve moaned as he felt a slick sensation inside of him, but as soon as Tony pulled out and laid on top of him, Steve felt a familiar sudden emptiness and immediately thought he had an accident.
“Yes, if you’re free, of course.”
“I’m going to just hang out for a bit before ramming the shit out of you because ‘a’, you’re soft and cute and ‘b’, it won’t be fun for either of us if you get hurt. But mostly it’s because you’re soft and cute.”
Steve looked down and away from Tony, taking in a deep breath before looking up. “…are you doing this because…I told you that I love you?” He asked quietly.
Ned finally responded by nodding quickly.
“Tony," Steve commanded, coolly yet sternly, “you need to fix this
“Steve and Tony fucked last night.” Bucky interjected without any preamble, causing Steve to groan again and cover his face.
As Steve’s body began grinding against his, Tony couldn’t stop his thoughts from racing. He could just say out loud that he loved Steve. He, Steve, and Peter could officially become the family they’ve been acting like up until that point. Everything would finally make sense and Tony would finally be with the right person.
Steve smiled at Tony, ignoring his hand to give him a hug instead, causing Tony to melt right on cue.
Steve’s face remained soft as he scooted closer toward Tony to give him a kiss. Tony kissed him back, but then pulled away to turn onto his back again. He definitely felt the pain in his chest now, but something about Steve’s calming energy managed to fend off a full-on attack.
“Okay. Now that we’ve gotten introductions out of the way, let’s begin, shall we?” Fury clapped his hands together as everyone took the remaining seats at the table. The lights dimmed as Fury began explaining Project Synergy, holding a clicker in his hand. Steve could barely control his excitement as he whipped out a notebook and a pencil from his knapsack.
“Yeah, it’s great that you all managed to keep your project going. I hope it all works out…” Sharon offered, clearly unaware of the specifics of Stark Enterprises and Synergy.
Tony shrugged. “I don’t know, Rogers. The kid likes spiders.”
However, before their conversation could go any further, Thor burst through the conference room door, nearly knocking both Tony and Steve over. Bruce and Clint piled out of the room to chase after him.
Steve smiled as he shook his head. “Okay, maybe not that devious…”
Tony waited before answering. He continued to stroke the back of Steve’s neck. “Steve…it’s okay. That doesn’t matter…honestly,” he laughed to himself, “I could jerk off to just thinking about you smiling.”
Kids. They grow up
Bruce nodded as he patted Tony on the shoulder. “I get that, Tony. But maybe Steve’s trying to process what’s going on before trying to have a productive conversation?”
Steve nodded as he pulled his fingers out which prompted a gasp from Tony. Tony moved to lie completely flat as Steve leaned forward. He pulled Tony’s body toward his, lifting him a little to get a better position.
“Come over around 5:30. I need to make sure Peter works on his homework before he goes to bed.” Tony watched Rhodey rise out of his chair to head toward the office door.
Tony sat up straight at the word “romantic”, almost knocking himself off the table. The rubber ball flew past his head.
“Any news on those tapes?” Bruce said as he closed the door.
“I apologize for Anthony’s short fuse,” a small smile marred his expression before he continued, “unfortunately, he’s been that way since he was a child, I’m afraid.”
“Tony! Are you all right?” Steve asked, reaching his arm out for Tony to grab.
Hey everyone!
Peter nodded quickly. “Yes! Steve is great!”
I’m sure that’s not true. 😊
Natasha cleared her throat to get his attention. “Dr. Selvig.”
Tony grinned as he found his notebook he kept for Peter’s quota. “You think you’ll be able to stump me again, Parker?”
Steve moaned as Tony continued to finger him; he felt himself losing control as Tony slid the finger in and out of his body. As the feeling intensified, Steve couldn’t help himself from rubbing vigorously against the mattress, moaning louder than he had ever before. He could feel Tony rubbing his body with one hand while the other continued in and out.
It was also interesting to hear Tony talk about the project and see how he interacted with other people. He seemed a bit like Steve had imagined based on their first encounter, but there was something human about Tony when Fury mentioned the original team and Howard Stark. He wondered to himself who this person meant to Tony because whomever he was, Tony acted like a completely different person, albeit briefly.
Steve nodded, holding Tony’s arm before turning to leave the lobby. He waved at Tony as soon as he exited, watching Tony wave back.
Tony kept his eyes on the road as he smiled, albeit timidly. They sat in silence for a while longer; Steve figured that Tony would talk to him when he wanted to so he kept the conversation to a minimum and would only contribute if Tony initiated.
“…well, actually you might be fine,” Tony cleared his throat, “…because you know…your build.” There again was that hint of hesitancy in Tony’s voice as he finished his statement, but Steve brushed it off.
“Come on, Tony.” Steve begged, trying to turn away from Tony again who managed to prevent him by holding onto his arm.
“Buck?” Steve asked, staring intently at Bucky.
like?” Sam smirked. He placed Steve’s drawing to the side as he got up from the table to grab a beer from the fridge.
Steve crossed his arms behind his head. “We’re not even married yet, and we’re already doing parent things.”
Steve nodded again before reaching out a hand to place on top of Tony’s hand next to his body.
Tony only sighed loudly, more to himself than to Rhodey’s explanation.
“Oh wow, Tony…” Steve let out.
Tony was in the lab working a little later than usual to keep his mind occupied before the dinner with Steve later that evening. Steve had left about an hour before to get ready. Needless to say, the two men were awkward around the other the entire day; both made sure to convey their sincerest enthusiasm for the dinner without sounding too desperate.
Sam shrugged, but he seemed like he was easing up a bit. “Yeah, she’s great.”
Tony nodded as he watched Steve leave the space, grappling with balancing his swarm of feelings before calmly walking to the console to work for a few more hours.
weekend, Banner. I can’t switch up the plans now.”
The staffer nodded slowly before pointing behind himself. “Okay, well, let me know if you need anything else. The keynote is scheduled for later this evening…uh, and we’ll have you do a presentation on the Stark Facial Convertor tomorrow afternoon, if that still works?”
annoying,” Nebula cut Obadiah off as she turned to address Gamora, “this is your mess.” She pointed at her sister before marching out of the sitting room and out the penthouse.
Tony slapped Bruce a little too hard in the chest with a backhand, hardcore rolling his eyes. However, Bruce barely flinched.
“Anthony, I need to speak with you.” Obadiah walked into the room and took a seat in front of Tony’s desk. He undid the button to his suit jacket before settling down, looking around as he investigated Tony’s office.
During the final round of interviews, Steve had finally met Tony Stark, the man in charge of Project Synergy. Meeting Tony Stark had never been a life goal of Steve’s, but the idea was cool, nevertheless. Well to his friends at the very least. Sam and Bucky Barnes (Steve’s oldest friend from childhood) were completely obsessed with their more reserved friend’s chance to work with a celebrity. They had seemed more excited for him than he had been for himself.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Yeah, I know, J.A.R.V.I.S.” He groaned again as he leaned back into his chair.
After accessing the damage from afar, Tony knew it would take a while to clear out the debris from the lab due to the extent of the damage and any sensitive material that may be exposed. However, it wasn’t until earlier that day the team went to visit Steve had it been discovered that some faulty wiring in the Synergy device had caused the explosion.
Tony turned slightly to look at Steve, smiling shyly before leaning over the side of the bed he usually slept on. He shuffled around a bit, pulling some things from out underneath the bed until he found the thing he was searching for. Tony sat up straight, breathing deeply, trying to steady himself so he wouldn’t forget what he wanted to tell Steve.
“Tony, it’s okay.” Steve stepped into the room. He sat down on the other side of Peter’s bed before the nine-year old reached out for him. Steve, caught off guard, paused before hugging Peter back.
“Hey…” Sam stopped in his tracks abruptly, making it obvious that he could feel the tension in the room.
The team busied themselves in the conference room as they generated material and equipment Natasha, Clint, and Thor needed to help people get off the island safely, while the rest of the team worked to track Thanos’s weapon.
“Tony, you know what I mean. I wouldn’t have chased you for your money or fame. I wouldn’t have treated you poorly…”
And probably the most troubling, at one point in his life, Tony also thought that he might have been in love with Tiberius, but Tony had been so blinded by his own insecurities to realize Tiberius was actually emotionally abusive.
“You’re fine when someone thinks you’re messing around with Bucky, but you flipped the fuck out when it was with me? Okay.” Tony ultimately concluded.
Tony turned his head to look directly at Steve. “Well…I’m glad you didn’t…you saved my ass, Rogers.”
“No problem, Steve.”
Tony’s smile widened a little, but then he shook his head. “No, your buddy just got married. You should really hang out here, Rogers.”
“Oh, hey, Sam…” Tony greeted.
“Hey!” Loki struggled against Natasha, attempting to wiggle free but she was stronger than he had anticipated, “I’m trying to help! I swear to god I told you all what I know this time!”
The ambassador was lying in a bed, hooked up to various machines. He was breathing deeply with the assistance of a mechanical ventilator. One of the nurses passed Steve and Tony with a small tub full of bloody bandages as he walked out of the room. It became terribly clear that if they didn’t do something quickly, the man would die.
Tony nodded, clenching his chest, counting to himself to calm down until the pain seemingly subsided. Steve held onto him, which appeared to ease his body somewhat. After a moment, Tony finally calmed down enough to sleep with Steve still holding him.
Steve scooted closer toward him, pulling him close to his body. “…you can be the same with me…I’m not going anywhere…”
“Don’t screw this up, Loki.” Obadiah wagged a finger at the carrier who was now taking his cap off with a wide grin.
It was later in the week and Tony was having an emergency meeting with Pepper in her office; Pepper was sitting at her desk with Tony sitting on the opposite side, trying to look as relaxed as possible.
“Thanks, Tony.” He smiled back; almost sure he wasn’t blushing.
“Yep!” Peter answered, still trying to stir with the giant spoon.
“Tony, I’m really sorry…but I haven’t mentioned to Sharon that we used to date because she and I have only been on a couple of dates—”
Tony sighed as he closed his eyes, trying to tell himself to stay focused on Steve and not any of his worries. Steve waited for him, slowly caressing his side. Tony sighed again as he turned his head to look at Steve.
“Steve invited me over for dinner tonight…”
Steve eventually smiled back with a nod. “…that’s really nice of you, Tony.”
But of course, he still wasn’t mentally prepared to deal with this surge of emotions; he kept telling himself that their relationship was just repairing itself.
She rose from her chair at the table, rounding it before leaning on the edge. She carried one of her tools with her, twirling it around and around in her hands before she continued.
A group of scientists were standing in front of their colleague who harangued them for the latest mishap. The disgruntled scientist waved his arms about in a fit of frustration.
Steve nodded a few times without verbally responding.
Tony gasped and moaned with every movement, running a hand through Steve’s hair. Steve used his other hand to hold Tony still, but he wiggled underneath Steve as he sucked his cock.
Tony laughed as he kissed Steve, almost dropping the ring box. He quickly grabbed it before sliding his family’s ring onto Steve’s ring finger. Steve smiled at him as Tony settled them both to lie back down on the bed. Tony, caught up in a wave of emotions, starting grinding against Steve’s body, feeling him all over as he felt Steve do the same.
Steve looked downward at the city as they departed. “Thor and Bruce should be at the hospital when we get there! We’ll get the equations when we reach the hospital!” Tony added.
“I’m tired and I hate board events.” Tony let out as he walked away from Steve, but was truly bothered by his interaction with Tiberius.
Steve sighed loudly. “…I’m a little embarrassed that you found us like that,” Steve took a deep breath as he heard Sam laugh quietly, “and…I’m not being hush-hush, Sam. I’m just not sure where Tony’s at with all of this…” Steve slumped further down into the couch.
Steve unbuckled the strap to his helmet as he dismounted from his bike. He stared at the innocuous warehouse façade of Stark Enterprises, still debating whether if he really wanted or should continue working with Synergy.
Steve shook is head. “Actually, I…uh, told her I, uh…wasn’t ready to be in a relationship…”
“Yes! I learned five things.”
Steve sighed heavily as he sat down on the edge of the bed, hanging his head, wallowing in agony.
“…I used to mess around with this guy in my twenties and early thirties, but stopped it long before I started dating Pepper, actually…” Tony turned to face Steve, “I feel like I really made a change after I started seeing her…”
Bruce grinned as he rested his hands on his hips. “Also, please just call me Bruce, Steve. Not only are we work colleagues, you’re seeing one of my best friends.”
“Okay, so you already know the deal, Parker. Five things. And today’s reward is letting Steve stay over tonight.” Tony pulled out a stool before settling, extracting a tiny notebook from his back pocket. He looked up at Steve with a smile before writing down that day’s date on a fresh page.
Tony coughed before scrolling through the equations on his tablet.
“…uh well,” Tony began, reminding himself of his plan to get Steve back, “I suppose that only makes sense…”
The lights flicked on as Tony broke out into a run that ended with him launching his body to land on top of the bed. He settled, sprawled out like a starfish, kicking his loafers off by flicking them across the room. He closed his eyes as he remained as still as possible. He thought about Pepper and how lonely he felt, which elicited a distressing moan as he turned over to face the ceiling.
Steve remained looking at Tony. “Of course…that felt really good. I never felt like that before…” He answered quietly.
“We can go to bed if you want…” Tony whispered.
Tony nodded as he reached downward to caress Steve’s face. “I get it. But we’ll take it easy, okay?”
Steve patiently watched the man shuffle about, more curious than anything else by Bruce’s intensity. He was still a little confused by Synergy and its goals, but it helped seeing the device they were tasked to use. Steve had never seen anything like it, let alone the elaborate presentation one of the interns probably cobbled together the night before.
“Does…,” Steve began slowly, “…Dr. Strange know we’re seeing each other?”
“Nice job.” He whispered to Tony, now able to do so without his mic picking up the feedback.
“Didn’t tell me what, Bruce? I have no idea what you’re talking about.” Steve responded.
Steve shook his head as he walked toward Tony again. “Tony, please, I don’t know why you keep saying that.”
Thor sighed heavily. “It is some hangout spot. It is supposed to be ‘hip’, so I am told.”
Shuri chuckled. “Eh, I’ve been here so many times, but I think everyone is having a nice time.” She looked at Tony before looking at Steve, both mumbling about how nice the resort was.
Bruce shook his head, his expression hardening again. “Shit, Tony…” he looked directly at Tony, “the device isn’t generating the detonator…” he tapped on the tablet, “it looks like it's being held up by the last unfinished round of safeguards…”
“Games?” To Steve, Tony was the one who would get angry any time they got close.
Tony carefully helped Steve out of the car. Earlier that day, Sam and Bucky had visited Steve at Tony’s, using it as an opportunity to check in on their friend while also bringing him his nicest suit for the evening.
“Okay, let us know when you’re about to leave so we can assemble the parts.” Bruce answered.
Both Steve and Tony looked away from the other before the conversation switched back to Synergy and Steve’s contributions to the team. Tony stayed for another hour or so before announcing it was probably time to relieve his babysitter, and Steve volunteered to show him out. They shook hands before Tony hopped into a car he ordered. As Steve reemerged in the apartment, Sam was standing in the kitchen perched against a counter, arms crossed and wearing the goofiest grin.
Part Two (a short story):
Tony moaned quietly into Steve’s mouth as their kiss moved slowly. Tony’s hand that had been placed on Steve’s back was now on his waist before he slid it downward to rub Steve’s hip. Steve pulled Tony even closer, which caused Tony to rub a little against his leg. The kiss deepened between them before Tony broke away, somewhat surprised by the intensity.
“I…uh…I’m going to get some work done in here for most of the day before going to a meeting.” He awkwardly tried. He was doing his best again to mask an eventual panic attack.
“I’m sorry,” Tony began motioning for Steve to come in, “Obie was just in here being an asshole per usual.”
Tony tried to maneuver past Steve, but Steve blocked his path. Tony then backed a foot away. “Steve, I have to get back to the city—I have to check on Peter.”
“I’m too busy to date.” Steve quipped. It was true; Steve was too busying trying to figure out his growing feelings for his lab partner to really consider dating anyone else.
“…just seeing…having you around…it makes me wish…I had the same thing…” Tony sighed to himself, feeling ready to give up.
Tony peered downward over the balcony, watching numerous couples whirl around in the space designated for dancing. Tony turned to smile at Steve who nodded; Tony couldn’t help himself from expressing how enamored he was with how great Steve looked in a white and black tux.
Tony rolled his eyes before crossing his arms. “Not great.” He shrugged.
“Down the hallway, last door on the left.” J.A.R.V.I.S. replied.
Bruce nodded, thinking deeply before answering. “I’m working on something that will dissolve the material we use to construct our labs' hardware and software.”
“…Tony?” Steve repeated slowly, taking his time entering the kitchen.
Bucky nodded before patting Steve on the shoulder again. “Just take it easy. You guys used to talk all the time before.”
Steve smiled. “I wouldn’t have let you go to this thing, or at least put up an effort, if I thought this was too dangerous. Also…I can keep track of you, Tony.”
“I am so sorry, Tony. I care about you so much…”
Steve nodded. “That’s definitely true for me as well.”
Steve glanced at the rest of the group who had been watching them the entire time. “Tony…”
Steve shuffled around before smiling. “Well, working in Tony’s lab really helped a lot.”
“I think you owe us an explanation.” Thanos answered sharply.
Steve nodded while looking around the space as if that were the first time he had ever been there. He then turned around to face Tony who was lingering near the elevator.
Tony then shuffled around, trying to get comfortable. “Uh, Steve…” he started, smiling weakly, “…thank you…for coming back for me…”
Steve inhaled deeply. “No, Tony…I just want to move on…okay? So, do you want to go?”
“Uh, Mr. Stark?” The intern looked around the room as his voice trembled with intimidation, “I-I need your signature…”
“Fuck, Steve…” Tony moaned.
he thought back to that moment in the cocktail bar which quickly translated into a goofy smile, relieving any weird feeling he had about his serious conversation with Pepper.
Tony unbuckled his seat belt, lingering a bit before reaching over to stroke Steve’s neck. Steve breathed deeply as he accepted a kiss from Tony who then moved his other hand to rub Steve’s leg. Tony kept rubbing until he bumped against what felt like a semi-hard erection through Steve’s pants.
Bruce glanced at Steve as he grabbed another tablet to scroll through data. “Oh, you know, he’s probably trying to keep himself busy before the trip this weekend.”
Tony sighed. “Really? That could have been an email or a text convo.” Obadiah laughed loudly before leaving. “I miss our one-on-ones, Anthony, so I seize the opportunity whenever it presents itself!” Obadiah practically shouted out in the hallway. “Also, I would love to see Peter!” He added.
Steve nodded as he closed the door before sitting down in his desk chair. “Thanks.” Was all he could manage in a situation he had never thought he would find himself in while pushing for a deadline in the middle of the week.
“Okay…” Bruce answered, “if Tony comes by, I’ll just let him know.”
Steve rubbed a hand through his hair a few times. “Uh, well I think a combination of both. I was thinking we could walk around a bit, maybe relax by one of the pools…later Sam wanted the bridal party to take some pre-wedding photos…and then I think T’Challa’s throwing a huge party for everyone later tonight.”
"A few years…" Tony glared back at Obadiah, telling himself to remain calm, "but I don't know what that has to do with Steve going to the thing tonight."
“Wow, Rogers,” Tony looked around Steve’s office as he walked in further, “this is super nice.” He sat down in front of Steve’s desk, still grinning which both irritated and charmed Steve at the same time.
Nevertheless, Steve laughed before shaking his head. “It’s nothing, Tony.”
Tony let his body topple over to the floor so he could lie down on his side. His earlier tipsy feeling intensified as his body’s low tolerance to the alcohol exacerbated his emotions. Tony held the diary against his chest, crying to himself before sniffling quietly. Eventually he drifted off to sleep after settling from his fit.
“I know, Tony. I’m doing the best that I can when he asks for more details. And I know this sounds trite, but if you keep doing this great work, the board will be on your side—uh, not saying that anyone’s against you, of course.”
Steve looked at Tony suspiciously, but then regained himself. “This could be serious, Tony.” He responded as they reached the other side of the den where Thor had a huge built-in bar. Natasha and Clint were standing at the counter, chatting.
Tony waved the intern off before addressing him. He pointed back at Steve as he stormed out of the conference.
Can’t wait.
“So…you and your mother are close?” Tony asked, his voice faltering.
A few hours later and Tony and Steve were back in their lab. They had taken Tony’s helicopter to the abandoned factory and ran a few sequences through the device. While they worked, Tony continued to quiz Steve on details about himself. As Tony was giving Steve a hard time about what he liked to do on his days off—which, as you know, mostly consist of staying home and making dinner—Steve noticed that it was nearly time for them to head back.
Steve cleared his throat. “I…uh…there should be a security badge for me. Steve Rogers.”
“Uh,” Tony started, clearing his throat a little, “I’ll need to schedule a meeting with the executive committee to officially tell them about…well…you know…you and me…”
“My bed’s been screaming for your ass, so I have motivation to get back in one piece.” Tony offered casually.
Steve nodded. “Uh, yeah, I would like that.”
“You know, Tony. You really
“That’s why we need to stop it before he deploys this weapon at the expo…I have a plan…” Gamora then pulled out a mini tablet from her back pocket, tapping on it to show her sister the list of sequences.
Peter made a cheerful sound before answering. “Okay!”
“Well we know that it can handle the energy generated by the vibranium core and that it doesn’t take much to construct a core.” Tony slid the image of the device to the side as he pulled up an image of the vibranium core, complete with a dimensional scale. Steve leaned closer toward the image. He was completely captivated by its color and intensity.
Steve thought, his annoyance seeping.
Tony reached over to pat Steve on the back as they proceeded to walk to the front of the room. “Yep, I think we’re good to go.”
Steve quickly followed him out of the bathroom, finding Tony trying to get dressed.
Tony shuffled around a few times, choosing to just come out with it. “I…after…we…broke up…I, uh…” Tony stopped to rub the back of his head before he continued, “…I had some issues…”
“I'm not usually like this…” Steve repeated as he kissed Tony.
The atmosphere between both men was awkward at best; Steve hadn’t spent the night over at the penthouse since the night he told Tony that he loved him and they still hadn’t discussed it. Steve would visit to spend the day or have a meal or two with Tony and Peter, but Tony could never get him to stay the night.
“Tony, you’re great. Steve’s lucky to have you.” Was all Bruce concluded with before Tony heard him tapping on his tablet.
“I’m not really an artist.” Steve knew the statement was ridiculously false, but he was also human, too. Who doesn’t fish for comments occasionally?
Steve sighed as he sank further into the tub so that just his head hovered above the water. “I only went to one so far and I feel well enough already.”
Fury sighed heavily as he watched his agents scour the remnants of Thanos’s abandoned testing area. Ever since raiding the lab the day before, S.H.I.E.L.D. agents had been searching all over for any sign of Thanos’s super weapon, however, they had yet to find anything substantial.
Tony nodded. “He’s supposed to be speaking to the press at Stark Tower. I radioed Pepper and Rhodey before coming out here…I don’t want to spook him and have him end up doing something drastic.”
if you deserve it, Captain Rogers.” For a brief moment it felt as if Steve and Tony were the only people in the room. They immediately stopped whatever was going on between the two of them as soon as Sam let out a little too loud, uncomfortable-sounding cough.
Steve sat back down in his chair, watching Tony laugh on the phone with Peter.
Obadiah squinted with another quiet laugh before leaning backward in his chair. He looked at Steve before looking down at his desk, shuffling around a few things before he continued.
“I think we should keep both options open for the moment,” Fury had leaned forward to answer Obadiah as Tony took his time even acknowledging the comment, “we have a meeting after this with the team to discuss these future plans.”
“Since we know that the device can be easily manipulated, have your person proceed, but wait for further instructions.” Thanos coolly commanded.
“The device has been upgraded.” Tony chimed in. He walked around toward the other side of the table near Bruce and Natasha. “The Synergy device was just a pipe dream for Howard. We’re going to make it a reality. We now have full access to a crucial material resource to make it happen.”
“…but I think it looks good on our end for Synergy…” he motioned toward Tony with his drink, “…we just can’t have any more accidents. But I don’t think I need to tell you that.”
Once inside the building, Steve steadied himself before pressing the number to the penthouse, which was left unmarked for security purposes. He took his time pressing then waited. The intercom clicked before buzzing, indicating that the private express elevator had been unlocked for Steve to access.
“Excuse us.” She motioned for Nebula to follow her into Obadiah’s kitchen.
“Over what?” Pepper asked softly. Tony could tell from her tone that she was sincere.
Obadiah tossed that day’s newspaper onto the conference table as he shouted, pacing back and forth in front of the room, packed with the Synergy team, Rhodey, and Pepper. The force of the toss slid the newspaper to the center of the table.
He continued to search until everything hushed around him; his vision was shielded by a blinding light…
“Drop us off over there, Rogers.”
Tony leaned backward in his chair as he pursed his lips together. “Of course, it doesn’t, Obie. Fury and his agents sound like they have the security part handled.”
Steve straddled Tony, not really making an effort to move any time soon. Both looked at each other for a minute or two before Steve realized that he was basically sitting on top of Tony with his hands on his shoulders and Tony holding him firmly at the hips.
Tony squinted before answering. “That I actually don’t know.”
“Oh and, if you’re interested,” Tony began, walking up to the table to join Bruce, “there’s a place here at Stark Industries for you. We could use someone like you on Project Synergy, Shuri.”
Although he was smiling, Steve looked tentative as Tony handed him his drink.
Steve smiled up at Tony as he rested his hands on his hips before moving one upward to bring Tony down closer to his face.
Loki looked back and forth between Thor and Tony, his face working with constructing any possible lie he could conceive. Natasha interrupted his mental dealings by slapping him across the head.
going.”
the thought had entered Tony’s mind so quickly that he almost said it out loud, and his chest began to hurt almost immediately.
“Oh wow, you smell
“Harvard?” The scientist eyed his colleague as if he didn’t believe him, “
The two lingered before chatting a bit more about work, returning to their respective consoles as they worked together to catch up on some leftover tasks.
“Just talk to her.” Tony started.
Loki frowned at the message, recognizing that the email had been sent from Obadiah.
“Tony, I-I’m sorry.” He sounded hurt.
Steve’s eyes widened, becoming instantly uncomfortable by his friend’s assertion.
Strange was standing over Steve’s hospital bed, flanked by the rest of the Synergy team. As Strange continued, everyone quickly glanced at Steve before returning their undivided attention toward Strange.
Tony attempted to stop him from getting away by reaching an outstretched arm but then he quickly pulled it back.
Tony laughed nervously, relieved that Shuri seemed unaware of last night.
“Uh, yeah.” Tony finally focused his attention on Rhodey who was trying to direct him in the direction of the temporarily built stage for the presentation. Tony let Rhodey guide him toward the stage, all the while he was becoming nervous that Steve was there.
Bruce hung his head low before looking back up at Tony. “I’m so sorry, Tony, but I had promised a colleague of mine that I would attend a conference this weekend. I thought it was next weekend.”
Steve nodded with a smile, shaking Rhodey’s hand. “Thanks, Rhodey. I appreciate that.”
He pointed to the other side of the bed where there was a bedside table. Tony took his time before walking toward the table, reminding himself not to be weird, play cool, don’t say something stupid or do anything stupid.
“…I should have told you this a long time ago…” Tony leaned in closer to Steve, “but I felt this way about you long before you said it and I still feel the same…”
Steve smiled widely before his face relaxed. “You talked to Peter about us?”
“Hey…” Tony inched closer toward Steve as the group slowly broke up after the photo, “I think I’m going to head back to our suite to chill for a bit…maybe do some work. Feel free to do your own thing, though.”
“Turn it up!” Tony drunkenly shouted.
“I’m getting a bad feeling about this situation, Tony. I don’t think it’s unreasonable for me to be cautious.” Steve opposed, letting himself be pulled by Tony toward the main part of the house were most of the party guests were mingling and dancing.
Steve shifted back and forth on his feet as he crossed his arms. “I can go back with you, Tony, if you want.”
Thanos then penetrated the scientist’s personal space. “Any more questions?”
Steve blamed himself.
doing it right and it’s
However, it appeared that Tony had picked up on Steve’s palpable trepidation because he stopped what he was doing to look at Steve.
Tony nodded with half a grin; Steve realized that he was trying to lighten up the mood.
“Wait a second, Tony.” Bruce said as he watched Tony slam the door to the guest room before pacing back and forth, “what’s going on?”
“…we need to use Synergy to stop whatever this weapon is capable of…the only thing is if we push the device beyond its current limits to combat whatever Thanos is cooking up, it could make the device unstable even with the vibranium core…”
Steve laughed back as he reached for the salad. “Thank you. That was really nice of you both.”
“…uh…” Tony started, “…I would…really like that…Steve…” Being with Steve was what he wanted, he just needed to work for it again.
Strange opened the door out into the hallway. He looked back and forth amongst the team before speaking. He was smiling, albeit his expression was weary.
Although Tony looked wrecked from the night before, Steve couldn’t help but stare. Then his dream popped back into his head.
Tony nodded, but then hung his head low. He could feel Steve inching closer toward him, but not too close.
Steve nodded as he accepted the tablet.
Steve crouched down near the device as he readied himself. He had done this so many times that it finally felt like second nature to him, but obviously he couldn’t concentrate as well since he was so focused on the past weekend and Tony’s current behavior.
He waited a bit before continuing. “I just had a meeting with Obadiah…”
Steve turned around from the sink to see Tony walking into the kitchen, sulking. Peter and Ned had retreated to the former’s bedroom to finish their game before dinner.
Everyone turned to look at Tony who was on the opposite end of the conference table from Obadiah. There was a brief pause as everyone expected Tony to respond to Obadiah directly, but the longer he waited the more restless the room became.
Steve nodded as he let Tony hold onto him. Tony looked up at him with a smile.
“Well…” Bucky started again, “
“Yeah, whatever, Banner.”
Tony couldn’t help his face from expressing how shocked he was. “Rogers, you can’t be serious. You are
Obadiah laughed quietly. “I heard about your great work today and I think the board would agree that you would be the best to represent this project and Stark Industries during some of our upcoming promotional press conferences.”
Steve worried to himself, yet something about the phrase “with me” was a tad unsettling. As he ruminated on Tony’s question, Steve began to torture himself again over what he could have possibly done to ruin his relationship with Tony.
As he walked away from the scene, Tony couldn’t help but stare back at Steve, completely transfixed that they had just made out again. However, he needed to stay focused or their little act would be quickly discovered.
“…Steve…I…screwed up…” Tony began crying to the point that his body could no longer restrain itself.
“Hey,” Tony placed both hands on Steve’s chest again, “slow down for a sec, soldier.”
“Good morning.” Steve whispered as he reached to caress Tony’s face with both hands.
They stayed out for a few hours before returning home. Steve had his phone on silent the entire evening and hadn’t glanced at it. He remembered, as soon as he said goodnight to Sam and entered his bedroom, that he was supposed to call Bucky and update him about his day. He figured he could do so first thing in the morning before going into the lab.
Tony nodded, feeling his emotions bubble up to the surface again. “Thanks, Steve…”
Fury rested his hands on his hips. “I think that’s fair. Okay, so we’re locking down the device.”
“Oh my god, Banner. You’re such a Debby Downer.”
Peter sighed as he watched his dad. “Tony, I think I got it.”
“Peter!” Steve shouted and waved.
Obadiah gathered up his lunch plate before rising from the table to throw the trash away. He then walked over to Tony who was now sitting, before sitting on the edge of the table.
Tony took a bite of his food. His eyes instantly lit up from how delicious it was.
Steve couldn’t help but be entranced by Thor’s storytelling, although he made a face at the phrase “my lucky hammer”. He watched the blond giant wave his arms around as he told Steve about his last camping trip.
“The one happening on Roosevelt Island. I’m sure they sent you something. It’s supposed to be the biggest thing happening this year.”
Steve grinned. “It’s not so bad, actually. I thought he would be a complete jerk, but he’s more overly confident than anything else.”
Peter nodded with a broad smile. “Tony, do you think it’ll get through the doors?”
Peter frowned a little, but ultimately nodded back with a contained smile. Tony finished what he was doing before jogging to stand next to Peter.
“…I’d…like to see you try…” He whispered.
Reticent, Steve nodded as he hung his legs off the edge of the bed before finally rising. He looked around before exiting, realizing that he had no idea where Tony’s home office was, but he felt too mortified to ask. He took a deep breath before continuing.
Tiberius winced before visibly taking the hint. He smiled at Tony before backing away, holding his hands up in retreat.
“Rogers, you’re with me. I’m going to use this presentation on the face thing to calmly alert everyone about what’s happening.” Steve nodded as followed Tony out of the conference room.
Steve nodded promptly and wordlessly as his hands squeezed Tony’s ass. Tony stroked Steve’s cock with one hand while touching himself with the other. He leaned over toward one of the beside tables to find a tube of lube before rubbing some all over Steve.
Tony groaned again as Peter continued to jump up and down on the bed.
Steve sighed as he looked back at the bedroom door again. “Yeah…I think I’m getting the same impression…”
Steve took one last look at himself before walking out of the restroom which was not too far away from the space he share with Tony at Stark Enterprises. He approached the entrance, feeling awkward about wearing the suit out in the open like that, before entering the space.
“Rogers,” Tony began, “set yourself up a few feet away from the explosive. We shouldn’t need to get close.”
“I don’t know whose fault this is, but this can’t happen again. We had a deal, Stark!”
“Okay, so let’s scan what’s in here, then we can order something to eat.” Tony called from the room.
“Thanks. Greatly appreciated.”
Tony laughed. “It’s the nickname I made up for Rhodes behind his back.”
“Hey, watch
Tony laughed, looking back and forth between Steve and Peter. “Can I help?”
“Hey, Tony.” Sam nodded at Tony. Tony nodded back before looking back at Steve.
“Are we still on for tomorrow?” Steve whispered as he tightened his grip.
“We gotta start small before thinking big, Barton.” Fury coolly explained. Steve also thought it was a little ridiculous that they were replicating something so trivial, but he didn’t question the need for practice.
“So, what’s the verdict?” He asked, clapping his hands together before rubbing them.
“Okay, first,” he held up one finger, “don’t ever jump on this bed like that again. You’re going to break it and will have to spend the rest of the summer paying it off. Second,” Tony held up another finger, “you’re going to make me a cup of coffee and bring it here. I will drink that cup of coffee before going out into the kitchen. As soon as I get to the kitchen, you’ll make me another cup. After I drink that, we’ll get ready to leave. And third,” Tony held up a third finger, “make sure you’re ready to go.”
“Peter!” Tony waved for his son, “let’s move.”
Steve looked around self-consciously before nodding. “Um…sure…but I don’t really know how.”
“You called me ‘Mr. Stark’ the first time we officially met.” Tony gently reminded Steve of the team’s orientation day at Stark Industries.
Steve shook his head; he knew he wanted to stay with Tony. He slowly approached Tony before wrapping his arms around the latter’s waist, pulling him close. He could feel Tony’s heart beating fast against his own.
Tony nearly slapped the edge of the desk with delight. “That’s my girl! What did you find out, Ms. Spy?” He never felt himself grin so hard in his entire life.
Steve was holding solidly in position, but his face was telling a different story as Tony finally looked at him. He had never seen Steve this upset before.
“Romanov, keep us at a safe distance just so we know we got this thing.”
Steve leaned into the half hug as he whispered. “Tony, I don’t want to sound paranoid, but—”
He turned to face Loki, who was standing in the threshold of the entrance to his lab. His expression was marked by an unsettling grin which Steve found extremely unnerving.
Tony’s face began to hurt from smiling so much, but he couldn’t help himself. He took his time walking back to his bedroom, thinking about Steve all along the way. As soon as he opened the door, he took his time visually soaking in the remnants of his time with Steve embodied in how messy his bed looked before they left. Tony kicked off his shoes, stripping down to his briefs before sliding into the bed, wrapping himself in the sheets as he smelled the pillow Steve was lying on.
Everyone nodded or responded verbally to a degree before heading toward their intended destinations.
“No,” Tony angrily responded, “Selvig’s been cooperating with S.H.I.E.L.D. since the damn tapes. And
After placing the plates on the counter, Tony turned around to lean up against the counter. “Uh, Steve…I need to tell you something…”
taken a photo of the tech, there was a possibility the image could be leaked, and Tony had way too many enemies to keep track of who would love to steal the Synergy specs.
The two friends walked over to Clint, Natasha, Fury, and Thor. They had a few lively conversations, one of which Steve learned that Fury had been married for over twenty years. He realized that he never really saw Fury having a personal life since, well, he was so private. Steve then met two other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Maria Hill and Phil Coulson, both of whom appeared very serious when introduced. Agent Coulson, however, after a cocktail, gabbed to Steve about how much he liked comic books. Steve also learned that Thor was in a relationship with another astrophysicist named Jane Foster, talking nonstop about her research.
“…look, I wouldn’t worry about it. We have the schematics and the surviving hardware.”
"Tony..." Steve couldn’t help himself; he felt his body give in as Tony thrust into him.
Tony took a moment before answering. “I would love to go. Thank you for inviting me.” He grinned as the band finished the song. They stopped dancing but lingered before pulling apart.
Tony glanced at Steve with a grin before patting him on the shoulder, taking advantage of the opportunity to rub it a little, but not too much.
Rhodey chuckled. “Pepper let me in.”
“…maybe he’s sorry?” Peter’s expression had turned thoughtful.
Both Peter and Tony hustled out of the kitchen to greet May at the elevator. Peter shouted with glee as soon as he saw his aunt emerge from the elevator.
“Leave me. I need time to think.”
“And, uh, thanks for the offer, Sam, but I should really get home. I need to relieve my intrepid babysitter.”
“Yeah, yeah. Good job, kid.” Tony winked at Peter, “but you still got the check, right?”
Everyone settled before they began to eat. Tony asked Peter about his day, prompting Peter to give both Tony and Steve a lengthy rundown that involved him and his best friend, Ned, discovering that there was something amiss about the latter’s cat.
“Also!” Tony waved his hands around, “you can bring a plus one—or not! It’s totally cool either way.” He smiled unnervingly at Steve as he told himself to stay calm.
“That looks good to me, Parker.” He patted Peter on the shoulder before they ran from out underneath their cover.
“You guys on break already?” Clint barged into the lab as he interrupted Tony. Thor came in right after him as Natasha took her time entering. She looked over at Steve and smiled. Steve turned a shade of pink almost immediately.
Steve nodded as he leaned inward to kiss Tony, taking his time like he had earlier. Tony breathed deeply as he accepted the kiss from Steve, wrapping his arms around his neck as he pulled him in close. Steve laid on top of Tony as Tony used his legs to draw him in nearer. Steve kissed Tony on the lips before moving to kiss the underside of his chin. He then gently turned Tony over onto his side as he laid behind him, rubbing Tony’s chest from behind.
Tony’s inner self demanded.
He shuffled a bit before reaching up a hand to stroke Steve’s face, hesitating before continuing.
They chatted a little longer before hanging up. Tony stared at his phone, smiling to himself before calling a car for Steve.
“This is so epic!” Ned jumped up and down with glee.
Steve nodded. “Yeah I still need to remind myself that Tony’s famous and not just my lab partner and teammate.” He joined Sam in cleaning up.
“We need this rushed to get scrubbed.” She said curtly.
Tony laughed nervously. “Yeah, chill, Cap.”
Steve was fuming. He knew working with Tony would be challenging, but that was just ridiculous. There was no need to get so upset over something so insignificant.
Steve nestled his nose even more into Tony’s neck as he tightened his grip around Tony’s cock. He was trying to give himself a moment before he went any further.
“Almost ready to go?” Tony sat down on the edge of Peter’s bed.
Steve nodded as he scrolled through pictures of the suites on his phone. “The suites are so big it’ll be like we’re living in our own apartments anyway.”
As the lights in the bedroom dimmed, Tony stared at the ceiling thinking about the inevitability of dying alone before he remembered he needed to text Steve about tomorrow. He fished out his phone from his pants and stared at Steve’s contact profile for a second or two.
“I’m too old for this!” Tony cried as he rolled onto his back, holding his arm that Dr. Strange had to reconstruct after the Roosevelt Island explosion.
“Okay, team.” Tony clapped his hands together. “Even though the device is on lock, let’s not let that stop us. We have that promotional thing coming up, but I need you all to keep working on your individual tasks.”
Rhodey chuckled. “Oh yeah? How’s Steve?” He leered, leaning forward across the table.
Tony turned slightly to squint at Steve. He shook his head a few times as he yawned before rising from the bed. He yawned even louder as he stretched his arms out.
Peter, still holding onto Steve, turned his head to nod at Tony. Tony laid down, motioning for Peter. Steve waited before they were situated to lie next to them. It was a tight fit, but all three of them hugged up against each other.
“We thought the first few cases might have been the flu, but then the symptoms turned into something more serious. This past week alone we’ve received more than fifty people at the clinic and the numbers are rising.”
Tony, feeling himself losing control over his anger again, shook his head as he tried to steady himself and not confront Obadiah for purposely curating a confrontation while using Pepper.
Bruce sat back in his chair. He pretended to ponder by crossing one arm against his chest and resting the other on top to stroke his chin. “Well, I already said he’s blonde, but he’s tall and
Upon entering, Steve and Thor were met with a nicely dressed woman standing in the foyer. She stood defiantly with her arms crossed.
Steve hung his head as he tried to come up with a good reason. “Yes, Tony.”
reckless.” Steve uncrossed his arms to point defiantly at Tony who was inches away.
Tony nodded as he helped Steve sit up in the bed. He walked over to the other side of the room to grab a wheelchair.
“Turn it up!” Tony sang louder than before.
The two men walked through an empty hallway that was attached to the foyer; it looked as if the rowhouse had been subdivided to fit a subdued bar-like atmosphere. As they continued, the dimmed lighting increased with intensity; they heard some instrumental music playing in the background, beginning softly before reaching a comfortable level for people to chat over.
Natasha nodded as she walked over to settle next to Bruce. “That’ll give S.H.I.E.L.D. some time to sniff out any boogies.” She looked at Fury.
Peter nodded enthusiastically. “Yes! She’s okay.”
“Tony, I told you. I have it. Just read the figures.” At this point, Steve and Tony were elbowing the other out of the way of the device. The bickering between the two began to bother the rest of the team.
Tony sighed as he removed his sunglasses. “Yeah the current owner wants to turn it into a house museum or something,” he turned slightly to look around the property, “even through there are
Hey, Steve. Great first day, right? I’m looking forward to working with you. Meet me in the lab at 8am tomorrow. Hope you have a good night.
Omg, over 100 kudos! And over 200 hits since the last update! You all are making my day. Thank you so much for reading and I hope you continue to enjoy the story.
Sam was sitting at the kitchen table. He was smiling widely while taking a huge bite out of a giant breakfast burrito. Steve stopped short near the kitchen as Tony continue to stop in front of him. Both shuffled around awkwardly: Steve looked around himself as if he had forgotten something and Tony felt around in his pockets as if he were searching for something.
seeing someone right now, I wouldn’t be interested, so have one of your goons dump a bucket of iced water on you or something.” He waved Tiberius off.
Obadiah turned toward an officer. “Scour the lab and the surrounding areas. I don’t want this getting back to the board.”
After describing what best he could about Thanos’s intended plan, Fury had put Loki into protective custody on the condition that he would no longer leak Synergy secrets. Tony had been even more frustrated with Loki’s detailed responses; he didn’t understand why or if Loki was protecting Obadiah. Tony wanted to move quickly to prevent Thanos from further sabotaging Synergy, but he needed to gather more intel to prove that Obadiah was also complicit.
Steve laughed back, even louder this time. “Yeah, Sam’s grateful T’Challa took over most of the planning…”
. Steve wished.
“J.A.R.V.I.S.” Tony’s voice cracked as he called for the computer, “send an email to Banner and Shuri. Have them meet me in the lab tomorrow.”
“Rogers is great,” Fury started, “would have loved to have him out in the field during my military heyday.” He offered, seemingly unaware that he had interjected between Tony and Obadiah's tensed moment.
Sam and Bucky glanced at each other, shrugging before pretending as if Steve hadn’t dropped a bomb on them.
Steve turned slightly to look at Tony who was staring at Mr. Beck. “That works for us, right, Tony?”
“I’m so sorry, but I want to help, for real this time.” Loki pleaded as he backed away from Tony’s thrashing.
“Uh, my closest friends are also in the military.” Steve awkwardly volunteered. “Or one of them still is.”
After another minute of awkward silence, Steve sensed that Tony had left the space. Steve sighed heavily, placing his hands on the table to brace against. Now he was definitely sure he couldn’t stay working on Synergy with Tony.
“You better hope for your own sake, it doesn’t.”
The elevator finally reached the penthouse and both Steve and Tony virtually fell out into the foyer as the doors popped open. Steve held onto Tony, gripping him tightly. Tony moaned even louder into Steve’s mouth, completely caught up in the moment. To regain some control, Tony placed his hands on both of Steve arms, trying to get him to slow down for a second.
“Who’s they? Thanos?” Tony questioned as he calmed down.
“…sorry…” Tony said quietly, preventing himself from attacking Steve. He took a hold of Steve’s hand, now struggling with speaking from being overwhelmed by his emotions.
?” Tony had lunged toward him but both Steve and Thor managed to catch him before he could grab Loki.
Tony inhaled sharply, which hurt more than he realized it would. Maybe it was true they weren’t right for each other, but Tony still had trouble accepting it. If he couldn’t make things work with Pepper, then who could he make it work with?
“So…what is it?” Clint asked as he leaned further back into his chair. Steve thought he was close to falling over.
Steve inhaled deeply as he attempted to salvage the conversation before it escalated. “…I was too concerned with what people may think about me possibly sleeping with my employer who just so happens to be older than me—”
Steve sat up, staring intently. He took a moment before responding. “Tony…are you trying to break up with me?”
“Tony…” Steve started, feeling Tony smile through the phone, “…so Sam and Shuri are having a thing a couple days before the wedding…it’s for the bridal party…but we can bring a plus one…” He squeezed his eyes shut as he waited for Tony’s response, now instantly regretting his proposal.
“…and as you all know…” Tony walked over to a console, “we’ll need to keep everything Synergy here at this warehouse, Stark Enterprises. Nothing leaves this space. Understood?”
Steve shook his head, wiping his eyes as Bucky walked up to him to pat him on the shoulder.
“What else was I supposed to do? Everything was fine until this morning…he thought I just wanted sex from him…”
Peter nodded. “Only if he’s cool like Rhodey and Bruce.” He said with a smile.
“Uh, I think it’s time for me to take my leave.” He said to himself, jumping up from behind the table, first trying to walk past the fight, but then breaking out into a run to get away as quickly as possible.
The guard eyed the carrier before exchanging glances with his colleague. He then held up one finger before dialing Obadiah’s office phone.
Bucky shrugged. His face looked grim which caught Steve off guard. “That’s because I have to suffer through a fancy event to spend time with you nowadays.”
Tony sighed heavily as he slumped down into an aluminum chair near the console Bruce was stationed.
Steve reached out to give him a hug. “Let’s get some sleep.” He whispered.
Steve moaned quietly as he pushed more into Tony; Tony’s scent and thinking about being as close to him as possible sent a surge through the base of his body.
Sam snorted. “You do that a lot also.”
“Nice to see you as well, Colonel.” Steve held out his hand for Fury to shake.
Tony grinned. He placed his tablet on the bedside table. And suddenly, as he leaned to the side with his arms crossed, there was that alarmingly charming smile of his.
Tony watched Bruce work, annoyed that his friend knew him too well.
“...but thanks…I really appreciate that…” Tony finally let out, smiling back.
“That’s not him. That’s just someone who
Steve reached over to give Tony a half hug. “I’m so sorry, Tony…”
Sam nodded as he drank from his bottle. “Hey, there’s your in, Cap. You should offer art lessons since you’re an artist.”
Tony chuckled to himself as he waited for Steve. “You can go a little bit harder, Rogers.”
“Wow, it never ceases to amaze me how fast this thing works.” Bruce’s voice filtered in through both Steve and Tony’s earpieces. The voice was soon followed by the appearance of Thor and Bruce as they entered the room. They were carrying the replicated pieces and a broken machine.
Steve nodded before rising from his seat to head to the back of the cabin to retrieve some coffee from the built-in bar. He came back to their seats to find Tony fiddling around with the controls on his chairs.
Tony sighed again as he looked at Natasha. “Romanov, get Fury. He needs to hear this. Also tell him to just keep this between himself and the team.”
“Good Evening, Mr. Barton.” J.A.R.V.I.S. greeted Clint.
been caught up in the moment. Although he felt initially weird about pretending to be married to Tony, knowing that his more unreserved spy partner had suggested so in order to get a rise out of him, the thought had grown on Steve as the night progressed. Upset with himself for misreading the situation, Steve had thought that maybe the moment on the dance floor would serve as the perfect opportunity to show Tony how he truly felt. However, he had no idea Tony would react so poorly.
“The shit you pulled put one of my people in the hospital,” he shoved the tablet into Loki’s face again, “you better fucking talk
The plan was for Obadiah to deliver Thanos’s weapon to the island, yet Obadiah wasn’t too clear on the details; both Thanos and Nebula had been extremely cryptic when they kidnapped him and forced him to carry out this task.
Tony turned his head to look at Steve who was expressing his sincerest concern. That was something about Steve that Tony had always appreciated: Steve was aware of his issues but chose to stick around anyway.
Tony took a deep breath, realizing that he might have made a bigger deal about the museum visit than he should have earlier that morning.
Tony grinned before sauntering to the opening of the helicopter. “Sounds easy enough. Okay, Romanov, take me down!”
“What’s…is it…what time is it?” Tony mumbled, trying to wake himself up fully. He sat up halfway in the bed, slowly moving side to side as if he were stuck in quicksand.
Tony panicked internally, feeling his fight or flight response kicking in.
Steve wondered to himself, trying to calculate when Bucky would have had the opportunity to do such a thing.
Tony made a pleasant-sounding noise of approval. “Good idea, Rogers. Let’s avoid any unnecessary danger while we’re at it.”
“Turn it up.” Rhodey called back.
Tony’s eyes widened even more as he felt like his brain and heart were about to explode. “Uh, well…are you sure…?”
“That was nice work.” Fury motioned behind himself at Agent Hill and Agent Coulson, both nodding sternly.
The thought was weighing heavy on his mind.
Tony nodded slowly, looking around Steve’s office again before resting his eyes back on Steve. He sighed before continuing.
"Right, of course."
“Eh, I’ve had more eventful days.” Shuri answered casually, prompting Bruce to dipped his eyeglasses with curiosity.
Steve blinked a few times before gauging the reaction of everyone else in the room. Both Clint and Thor appeared a bit perplexed. Natasha’s expression hadn’t really changed since Steve first met her and both Bruce and Tony were grinning uncontrollably.
Steve could tell that Tony was trying to sound lighthearted, but he could also sense that Tony was too upset to continue. It didn’t offend him, however; actually, it made him appreciate the moment with Tony even more. Also, Steve was afraid he would make a mistake if they went any further. He was very attracted to Tony, but he knew if they ended up having sex, he would just be terrible at it, possibly ruining the evening.
“Tony? Are you all right?” Steve asked, clearly surprised to be seeing Tony unexpectedly.
Steve sighed. “I’m not that polite.”
Their waiter appeared again with their food saving Tony from any further embarrassment. The two remained quiet for some time, eating in silence save for a few non-related remarks.
“Whatever we find goes through Pepper then to you. You’re a sucker for chain of command, Obie.” Tony mocked, although he managed to sound not as nasty as he had intended.
activity…”
Tony laughed again but this time it was subdued as Steve could tell that he had picked up on his apprehension.
A blinding, flashing light reflected off Obadiah’s safety visor shields.
Tony stared at Peter, struggling with whether he should be honest.
“Tony!” Pepper nearly shouted, causing Tony to motion for her to keep her voice down.
“There are a few people I would like to introduce you to, Mr. Rogers.” Obadiah wrenched Steve away from Tony, nearly dragging him toward a group of people on the other side of the loft, “you’ll recognize some of our board members and some of Stark Industries longest standing investors, but we thought it would be good to have you talk with a few potential ones…”
The three shuffled around plating their food until everyone was ready to head into the dining room. There was a long hand-crafted dining room table in the middle of the space, large enough to seat at least twenty people. Steve noticed that Tony had arranged some chairs at the head of the table so that the three of them weren’t too far apart from one another. Tony helped Peter with his plate and his chair before motioning for Steve to sit down next to Peter. Steve blushed again as Tony pulled his chair out for him.
Just wanted to say that I'm so grateful so many people are continuing to read this story and enjoying it!
original.”
Bucky shook his head. “All this just because you read his dad’s diary?”
“It looks like the buyers are planning to attend this event out in Malibu this weekend.” Tony was mostly talking to himself, but he was loud enough for Steve to hear.
Tony nodded, smiling a little. “Well, thanks for coming.”
Bucky rolled his eyes as he stepped out into the lobby. “
“You have a
Steve was watching the movie, but he was also thinking about the last simulation run through. This second time, both he and Tony seemed to be working fine like they had his first day. It was almost as if the impatient Tony from before was an anomaly.
Steve nodded with a smile, but he found himself unable to verbally contribute; he was too captivated by this brief interaction between Tony and Peter.
Steve laughed quietly as he watched Tony slide underneath the sheets. Tony couldn’t stop himself from smiling at the sight of Steve in his bed as he leaned over to kiss him, taking his time before readjusting himself.
“Okay…” Tony answered after a moment.
Tony nodded wordlessly as he crossed his arms.
Bruce joined her. “Yeah, whatever he was referring to could be obsolete with this current iteration…”
Tony shook his head. “No. It says in the file they’re based internationally, but I’m sorely aware of most if not
Tony’s face immediately transformed from jovial to quite solemn, so solemn that Steve feared he might have said the wrong thing.
“Steve,” Bucky groaned before continuing, “I should have talked to you about this, but I talked to Sharon about you and Tony after you guys first went out…”
Steve turned over onto his side as he wrapped a hand around Tony’s waist. “Tony…remember when you told me I could be vulnerable with you?”
As Tony finally reached Steve’s apartment, Steve waited a bit before getting out.
“Right, Anthony?” Obadiah grinned with his self-satisfaction blatantly obvious.
Tony waved at Happy before he drove away. "Ready to go in?" He had turned to face Steve.
Peter nodded as he tapped once more on the tablet.
“…sorry, Steve…” Tony quietly apologized.
“Rogers, I had no idea you knew how to cook.”
Rhodey turned to glare at Tony. “Speaking as your closest friend, you can’t keep pulling this shit, Tone.”
noticed he’s into you.”
Steve once whined to Bucky and Sam. That question had earned him an audible gasp from his best friends who have been trying ever since to figure out how to kidnap him and dump him off in the nearest Apple store.
Tony moaned as he continued to come, hugging Steve’s neck, tighter than usual from the feeling. Steve finished before lying next to Tony who was a mess from the both of them coming on his stomach.
Bucky laughed again as he patted Steve on the shoulder. “But I’m glad to know that you’re taking care of yourself. As long as you do that, you can have all the fun you want.”
Steve nodded. “I think that’s his way of dealing with things.”
Tony shook his head as he walked away from the console again, pointing behind himself at the projection.
Steve laughed as he stepped into the shower, wrapping both hands around Tony’s waist before pushing him up against the back wall, feeling along his body as Tony kissed him. Tony turned them around so that his back was facing the showerhead. He kissed Steve once more before washing the soap out of his hair as Steve held onto him, rubbing his back.
“I like Tony—a lot, actually—but we’re not sleeping together, okay?”
Obadiah tapped on his desk with one finger as he leaned back into his chair. “…I’m aware that Howard’s schematic notations are difficult to understand…the man was never transparent…I’m sure your father’s team of scientists are more than capable—”
The team hadn’t gone on any other field missions since their first assignment. They mostly worked in the lab or ran practice simulations. But Steve and Tony had been working perfectly together on anything they were tasked to do. Well “perfectly” might have been too strong of a word to describe it: although the two managed to work without causing any problems, it was obvious that a difference remained between their opposing personalities.
Something about the way Bucky looked and his particular phrasing puzzled Steve, but he only nodded back instead of dwelling on the moment.
“And like I said, you can talk to me about it whenever you’re ready. I know since taking Peter in you’ve been getting better, but I also know it still helps to talk...”
Everyone nodded, except Thor who only groaned to himself.
Tony punched a button to the private express elevator once they reached the bank. Once inside, the shaft of the elevator skyrocketed to one of the upper floors of the tower. Steve nearly fell over, but his practiced balance saved him while Tony calmly stood rigidly in place, seemingly used to the speed of his building’s elevator.
“You didn’t know that, Rhodes. But thank you.” Tony smiled as Rhodey wished him a good night. He walked back to the table to find Steve paying for the check.
“Yeah…I know…” Steve finally let out.
Steve waited again, realizing that he had unintentionally upset Tony even more. “I didn’t say you were old, Tony.” He then shuffled a bit so that he could face Tony more directly, “I said you were older than me. Also, that’s not the point. The point is that you’re my employer.”
“I hope Sam didn’t give you too much shit about Saturday morning.” Tony was smiling, but he felt empty inside from trying to navigate his feelings.
Sam rolled his eyes again. “No, I mean, any time anything in conversation remotely relates to you, Steve manages to bring you up somehow. Nowadays he’ll just tell me something about you without even any context.”
Suddenly, the door to the school’s main building burst open and a herd of children came piling out. Steve looked around, spotting Peter jogging out with one of his friends, engaged in what appeared to be the most liveliest of conversations.
Tony laughed, ignoring Steve with a hand wave. “Rogers, you want help, or not?”
“Yes, we should properly welcome our new team member!” Thor shouted even louder behind him.
“Are you sure you didn’t know how to dance?” Tony smiled at Steve.
He kept backing out of the room before spinning around to get to the living room area. He was embarrassed that they were in the situation they were in while attending a wedding at an upscale resort on a private island.
Tony nodded. “I hope that’s all right…”
“Uh, my sincerest apologies…” Thor began, “…but I am very uncomfortable…”
Tony could feel Steve smiling as they kissed. Steve broke away from him, but his face was still close.
Also, while preparing the food, Tony had been grappling with himself over whether he should tell Steve about what happened after they broke up. He stopped for a second to stare at his phone which was sitting on top of the island next to the meal he had spent all morning preparing for himself and Steve.
“I got the idea from my dad…” Tony added, “he made a comment once about wanting to be able to download memories…”
As the group continued to chat about Clint and the promotional tour, Tony silently seethed. This ridiculous project that he didn’t even want to work on in the first place was turning out to be the fucking nightmare he knew it would become. Whether Obadiah was involved or in cahoots with some black-market weapons dealers was beside the point; based on this incident, there could be a myriad of enemies and competitors who were trying to sabotage Synergy.
“It is nice.” Tony lingered before turning to face his console. They continued working until Fury called the team in for another run at the simulation.
“We don’t have to tonight if you feel uncomfortable…” Tony offered.
The voice on the other side of the receiver rose in earnest which twisted Obadiah’s face into irritation. He nodded his head emphatically as he prevented himself from sighing with frustration.
Tony laughed again as he kissed Steve before sitting up straight. “I suppose you’re right, Rogers. But the suits are great, am I right?” He winked at Steve before rising from the bed, wiping himself off with a tissue before zipping up his pants.
“I can’t leave him like that! I have to see he’s okay.” Tony struggled against Steve, but Steve still managed to hold him in one place.
Bucky shook the board member’s hand after she introduced herself. “Pleasure to meet you.”
“Tony, thanks for the offer, but no…” Steve sat up rigid in his chair, “I haven’t heard from you in over a year…” Now there was no way Steve could stay cool without confronting Tony.
“Barton was attacked last night…he was doing some work in your lab before someone assaulted him.” Fury coolly explained.
“Excuse me,” Steve cleared his throat, “I have a prescription I need to pick up.”
Tony stared at Steve before looking away again, feeling his eyes well up with tears. “I couldn’t, Steve…”
“I don’t think I could be any quicker. Nice work, Rogers.”
Steve suddenly shuffled off the bed as he walked over to his overnight bag. He rummaged around until he found a tube of lube and a condom. He turned around and nervously held up the items for Tony to see.
Tony frowned at the monitor before checking the time on his wall clock. He had scheduled a meeting with the former Synergy team later that day at Stark Enterprises and Tony needed most of the day to psyche himself up before seeing Steve again.
