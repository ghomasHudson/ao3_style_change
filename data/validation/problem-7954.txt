“Yes, we need to talk about this.” Steve says, frowning. He looks at Bucky. “Let’s- c’mon, living room.”
Tomorrow, he thinks. Tomorrow will be the day he starts taking the chances he should have all those years ago.
“Doubt it,” Rogers smirks, and sure, he’s probably right, but that doesn’t mean Tony has to admit it.
"No," he admits. "I came back here for you. I never told you how I felt about you. Then you were gone, and I missed my chance."
Steve’s in a plush chair facing out the window, sketchbook in hand, which is just so
“You didn’t have to go,” Steve says, voice quiet.
"What, we can't have a breakfast date?" Tony asks with a sly smile, and now Bucky's really suspicious.
Probably.
“Nice to meet you, Mr. Stark.” Bucky accepts the hand and shakes, smiling as well. “Heard a lot about you.”
“Yeah?” He tries to muster up some interest, but he really couldn’t care less about whatever woman Stark’s seeing. He feels like that makes him petty, but he’s had enough to drink that he doesn’t care. “You in trouble?”
Sinking into the couch, he sighs. This was ridiculously impulsive, and now he’s starting to see all the risks.
"Pretty much?"
Bucky’s not surprised anymore; Stark has effectively broken down any preconceived notions Bucky had. He nods, a smile on his face.
“I can’t,” Bucky sighs. “Stevie, I can’t. It’s- it’s too much right now.” Steve nods, seeming to understand.
“He’s a nice guy,” he hedges, “we’ve had fun together.”
"Me too," Steve admits, downing the rest of his coffee, which is ice cold now. "You can come by if you want. I'm sure Tony'd like to see you."
Steve to sleep with Bucky, but it also feels like something that should happen, and he’s not sure why.
Losing Tony was the most painful thing Steve had ever experienced; more painful than downing the plane in the ocean, more painful than losing Peggy, Bucky, anyone else, or anything else.
“You don’t have to ignore him,” Bucky says, nodding at the phone. “It’s fine, Steve.”
Tony found Steve on the balcony of their room, a cigarette between his lips. It was a habit from the past that got bad back in the army, but ever since arriving in the future and being told how bad they were for you, he claimed that he was trying to quit. Tony’s team of publicists told Steve he couldn’t smoke in public at all. The face of American goodness couldn’t have a smoking problem, apparently. In his defense, he did cut down quite a bit after he and Tony mated since Tony hated the smell since it reminded him of Howard. Now, he saved it for when he was truly in distress and in need of a break.
Steve felt Tony take his hand, give it a squeeze, and then press his lips to Steve’s knuckles before mouthing, “thank you.” Steves’s small soft smile said all by itself that it was no big deal.
Peter’s face lit up. Gosh, that kid is cute, Steve thought.
“No, that’s what happened,” Steve affirmed. “It was upstate in a home lab. We figure it was someone playing with something they don’t understand, but we want to make sure that’s all. We don’t need an alien tech-powered supervillain,” he explained. “Not a big deal,” he assured.
“Wonderful, and what are we making?”
“Mmm,” he hummed. “Sorry.”
“And who’s fault is that?”
Steve couldn’t understand why those two weren’t together. He knew alpha and beta relationships were slightly unusual, but ever since he woke up in this new world, he didn’t see a reason for anything to be usual anymore. If people could handle the rest of the craziness happening in the universe, certainly, there seemed to be no reason why they couldn’t accept and alpha and beta couple – or an alpha and alpha or omega and omega couple for that matter.
Steve’s chest rumbled possessively, “sounds like a plan.”
The floor was empty when he got home which wasn’t really a surprise as Steve had guessed Tony would still be in his lab since it was still only just before three o’clock, so Steve headed for Tony’s lab where his mate could usually be found. Steve knew he could just ask Jarvis where Tony was and didn’t have to go looking, but for some reason, Steve liked the feeling of just knowing where Tony would be without even asking. It made him feel closer to Tony without really even having to do anything.
“Of course.” And with that, they were already back on the jet headed back for Shield. Natasha played her classical music, Clint turned off his hearing aids, and Steve studied to dirt in the small tube. It looked, in all ways, like normal dirt which was exactly what made him feel uneasy. In the time that he spent since waking up in the future, he came to realize that nothing was normal. Some things only pretend to be for the sake of image. While he knew in most cases it was impossible, he liked to know what he was getting into upfront.
“Sir, Natasha is calling to inquire about the results of the analysis of soil samples,” Jarvis said, interrupting their conversation.
“Love you too,” he muttered, still in a state of shock. “Oh, Steve!” He hollered as he was sure Steve had already made his way to the elevator since he was already dressed for the day, “Peter’s having dinner with us tonight!”
“You’re fine,” Tony answered.
“Oh really?” That seemed to cheer him up. “That’ll be great because then we can make dinner before Peter comes. I was thinking maybe we could cook together... I don’t know pull out one of my mom’s old recipes.”
“I’m going to take a shower.”
“Maybe including him in some of you and Tony’s day to day stuff every once and a while would help him adjust.”
“Six.”
“That’s good to hear,” Natasha said. “I’m sure it will take some time to get used to everything.”
“Oh! I know, Jarvis, play the Princess Bride!” Peter exclaimed.
“I know,” Tony whined, leaning into his mate’s warm touch.
Peter calmed himself for a moment.
“I think I can get behind that,” Steve chuckled and kissed the head of soft brown hair beneath him. “You need a haircut,” he noticed.
“Sorry, Nat.”
Taking it in stride he answered, “consider it already done.”
Steve reached over to where we had set two cups of coffee in their eccentric mugs. It had become a new hobby of Tony’s to grow his collection of ever growing mugs – something which had become much worse since Peter entered his life and found out his mentor could be instantly cheered up with a silly mug, or brought to tears by one that read “Word’s Best Dad” given to him on Father’s Day. Steve thought it was an adorable quirk and thoroughly enjoyed selecting mugs each morning. Today he’d chosen an MIT mug, which Tony assumed was his based on the small amount of cream, and a Star Wars one, given to him by Peter that featured Yoda making some pun of Christmas which had Steve’s black coffee in it. They did this every morning. Coffee in bed and talking about their day, spending some quality time together before having to actually start the day.
She thinks I’m lying. “May, please be reasonable,” Tony begged for the second time in their short conversation. “He’s in no state to talk right now.”
“A new adventure?” Tony mulled it over. It was getting lonely in his lab when Steve went to shield and all he had was his bots and Jarvis to keep him company. Maybe, the whole pregnancy thing did pop into his head a lot while he was down there and there was nothing stopping him from going down a self-loathing train, but, “What do you have in mind?”
Natasha knew how important Peter was to Tony, and Steve also knew Natasha was worried about Tony since their conversation. Everyone knew Peter was good for Tony and vise versa, and no one was going to encourage them to spend less time together. “Fine,” she said, “but soon, Tony, we want to figure out what we’re dealing with.”
“Tony!” Steve exclaimed and sighed. It was good to hear his voice.
“No, May, Peter is just fine, well, kinda.” Now it was Tony who was feeling flustered. He was sure that explaining this kinda thing was supposed to be easy, but since it was Tony, he couldn’t do anything the easy way.
Dinner went smoothly, besides both Peter and Steve eating enough food for four people each, according to Tony, but Steve could see the smile in his eyes as he poked at his salad – he hated salad but made himself eat it anyways.
“I will. I promise.”
“I’m sorry, Nat,” Clint cooed and snaked his arms around her from behind. “Can I make it up to you later.”
“Oh my God, please don’t cry,” Tony begged.
Tony couldn’t see the relevance but tried to keep going. He did business before. He’d been charming before. “Of course you do, but please, May, I promise he comfortable right now. The minute it’s over I’ll bring him right over myself.”
Natasha and Steve had always shared a special bond; although neither could really understand why their friendship had grown so strong, both were glad that it had.
Never one to beat around the bush.
Tony was caught off guard for a moment at Natasha showing worry openly before he replied, “I always do. Bye, Nat, I’ll let you know the moment I’m done.”
Steve kneeled down to Tony’s level before laying over him. “I’m sorry,” Steve murmured low into Tony’s ear, making Tony shiver, before moving over to where the almost accident would have occurred to plant a soft kiss on his forehead. “Is there some way I can make it up to you?” He placed another kiss on Tony’s cheek and lowered down to his throat and put one more soft kiss right on Tony’s mating mark.
“What are you talking about?” Tony finally asked.
“Peter, we want you to do stuff, and we love that you are so willing to help anyone in need. All we want is to make sure that you’re okay. You are way too important to us, both of us,” he emphasized, “to lose. Do you understand?”
“So I think finding something, a new adventure so the speak, would take your mind off things. We can keep trying, but hopefully, if you have something else to look forward to... I don’t know, maybe it just wouldn’t be all you could focus on.”
“Believe it or not, Natasha, he will. That’s what mates do.”
“She doesn’t hate,” Steve explained, “she’s just not used to sharing him.”
“Woah,” Steve said catching Tony. “I can change my clothes first, or shower or something... I know you don’t like the smell.”
Just to tease him he shifted a bit while saying, “Hey, I saw Star Wars, didn’t I?”
“I wanna talk to him,” she said suddenly.
Oh, that’s what she had meant. Feeling quite embarrassed Tony said, “May, I would call, but they’re going to think that it’s some sort of prank if I-“
He was woken up suddenly by a familiar smell. Heat. I thought Tony wasn’t due for another month, he thought, must have come early. “Tony, baby,” he whispered. He ran his fingers through Tony’s waves. They were lucky that Tony didn’t immediately need any kind of relief that wouldn’t be emotionally scarring in front of Peter. Typically, for the first couple hours he just wanted attention and to be touched. “Tony, your heat is starting. Gotta wake up. I’m gonna bring you to our room and take Peter to his.” Tony just whined and nestled deeper into Steve’s chest. “C’mon, babe, I promise I’ll take care of you, but you gotta wake up.”
“Steve!”
“I’ll be on my very best behavior,” Steve affirmed, finally getting up off the floor to stand up straight-backed with his face far too serious. Tony rolled his eyes dramatically, but walked away and left Peter and Steve alone. “Cm’ere, kid,” Steve said. Peter let himself be wrapped up his a big hug. “Let’s go upstairs, yeah?” Peter nodded along. They started walking towards the elevator. “And now, what’s this about food poisoning?”
“Tonnnyyy,” Peter whined, but Steve cut in.
“Uh, yeah maybe,” he said, giving it some thought. Maybe Bucky could come to dinner tonight, but Peter was coming... Tony was very protective of him, treating and protecting him like his own baby.
She answered after three rings and sounded like she usually did, flustered. “Tony, is everything okay? Is Peter hurt?”
That certainly hadn’t been what he’d expected.
Steve, the poor thing, looked very uncomfortable from having a very under-age omega attached to him with no sign of leaving. To add to his horror, Peter began grinding on the alpha. Steve who had been trying to at least hold the boy steady raised in hands in surrender and yelped. Peter, however, was using his super strength and stick and was going nowhere.
“Steve! I could have hit my head!” he whined, still lying on the floor.
When Steve came up behind him carrying the whole box, he felt grateful. Maybe his mate would know how to do this because he was sure as hell didn’t.
“No need to apologize.”
Tony panicked, “he got his heat! That’s all.” May didn’t respond for a minute. “Peter’s an omega, May.”
“You’re not selling me, soldier,” he advised. “Wasn’t sales Captain America’s original profession?”
“My alpha!” Tony snapped. From the bedroom, he could hear Steve snickering. I’m going to kill him... Peter whined and wiggled again. After I put my kid away.
Putting it out against the railing Steve muttered, “Sorry, babe.”
”Steve!” Tony yelled. ”Do something!”
Tony threw Steve off of him with a sudden and forceful shove that startled Steve even more than the kid walking in on them making out on the floor of the lab.
“Where’d my alpha go?” Peter said, slurring his words.
Tony gripped Steve’s shoulders and stared him dead in the eyes before saying, “Steve it’s not me.”
“You’re going to join me.”
“Your heat is not about my, sugar. At least that’s what I was taught about how to treat an omega.”
“It’s not that bad,” Tony said, trying really hard to get over to stench. He knew somewhere beneath the smoke had to be Steve’s scent. He pressed his face into Steve’s chest and took a long, deep breath. There it was underneath it all, cedarwood and the earth after it rained. It wasn’t fair that a person could smell so good.
“Right, right,” Peter said while still looking down and kicking his shoe. Peter was 15, still awkward, and the only reason he didn’t have his baby fat anymore was because of the spider bite. Steve was sure or else he would have presented already. This was why Tony insisted on keeping Peter completely away from anything dirtier than holding hands, something Steve had to be reminded of a lot because he was, as Tony described him – touchy. He said that children who hadn’t even presented yet didn’t need to be exposed to that, and although Steve argued that modeling a healthy relationship in which people were comfortable with each was important, Peter was Tony’s baby. He had no place to argue.
“I know my nephew,” she interrupted.
“We’ve only been mates for six months,” Steve replied casually.
Tony forgot he hid packs in there, figuring Steve would rather die than go rooting through an omega’s heat supplies. He hadn’t anticipated this, but looking at Steve he could tell he looked nervous.
He could do this... right?
”Like what?” he cried. ”He’s stuck to me, and trust me if I could get him to be not doing this, I would!”
“She hates me!” he repeated. It’s the only thing that made sense. She blamed him for Peter being Spider-Man and blamed him for if the kid so much as had a sniffle. It wasn’t his fault that the kid was an omega. Was that it? Did she really have those prejudices? Was that why she didn’t like him either, a dislike of male omegas? He knew it wasn’t uncommon, and he’d faced enough of it when he was running Stark Industries. It just didn’t seem right, but there didn’t seem to be any other options.
“You are the most capable man and omega I’ve ever known,” Steve said sincerely. His hands were back on Tony, soft and reassuring. “You can do this. Peter is going to be looking up to you even more now, and it will mean a lot to him if you help him settle in.”
Both their heads turned to look at the kid sleeping restlessly on the couch.
“How could I not when you smell so good?” he teased and ran his hands through Tony’s hair who was hiding his face in Steve’s chest.
“I can’t do this, so can you explain all this and take over for me?” Tony spat out quickly and looked away, feeling incredibly ashamed.
”If I’m pulling, and you're pushing, somehow, we're going to get this tiny horny child off of you!” he said, out of breath from yanking at Peter because Goddammit if he wasn’t going to get his kid off of his alpha immediately.
“Oh okay,” he said. Steve could hear the disappointment in his voice. It made his heartache.
“Hmm, can’t remember maybe you could remind me.”
“And while you’re doing that, who will be making sure you’re okay?”
“Peter! I’m so sorry,” Tony explained.
”That's a very disgusting way to phrase this situation.”
“And look what it’s done to you. Before we know it, you two will be dressing the same and-“
“Okay,” Tony said and nodded along.
Steve shifted into concerned mate mode. “Okay, babe, what is it?” Steve held his face tenderly and looked deep into his eyes. God Tony didn’t deserve this man.
“Thank you,” she said and sighed, probably out of relief, and continued, “I have to go, but tell Peter I love him more than words and that I’ll pick him up after my shift is done.”
It was good to hear that Tony was looking forward to sharing something special with him and Peter – a family dinner. “That sounds perfect, sweetheart.”
“Of course, and we can start your spidey project in the morning together,” Tony answered.
“Of course.”
Hi, friends, I realized that it had been a minute and so this was going to be longer but I wanted to get some content out there. I hope you don’t mind waiting too much, though, because I try really hard to proof read and put out content that’s worth the read.
“Yes please,” Peter answered. Steve poked around the fridge and found the makings for a ham sandwich. “Ham sandwich?” he asked.
“It’s Spider-Man!” Peter protested.
“Table’s set!” Peter yelled from the dining room.
“She hates me,” he concluded.
“Right,” Steve said, sounding only slightly disappointed while letting go of Tony and going inside, leaving Tony alone looking over the city. He pulled his phone from his pocket and dialed up May.
“I know,” Tony answered. Their banter seemed to be making the situation less awkward because it got a small giggle from Peter even if he did still seem a little uncomfortable. Steve never really had a dad around to see kissing his Ma, but had some random person been kissing his Ma, he was sure he’d feel embarrassed as well.
“Peter tries to keep Kosher,” came an answer from the hallway. Steve looked to see Tony walking out with clean clothes and damp hair. “But why are you trying to spoil his homemade, family dinner that we’re all about to make and enjoy.”
“Wouldn’t you be more qualified to do that?” Steve asked uncomfortably.
“Steve.” Natasha had a distinct talent for getting people to talk of which even Steve wasn’t immune.
“May, he won’t want to leave his nest,” Tony tried to explain carefully.
“Okay,” Steve chuckled.
“What?”
“I could smell your distress all the way from the kitchen, babe.”
Steve simply laid down on the ground with his hands behind his head and said, “that’s what I’m best at.”
“Oh no, no it’s okay,” Peter mumbled while looking at the floor. Steve noticed that his cheeks had turned bright red from embarrassment.
“And I’m gonna go call May and let her know about the kid.”
“The work I do is exciting and groundbreaking, and – and-“
“I know you are,” he said softly. He wanted to reach out and hold his mate, but he knew that the smell would gross him out. Feeling guilty for not providing his typical care he asked, “wanna tell me what’s wrong?”
“May, this isn’t something I planned,” he defended. He knew May thought he was a bad influence, but this was a bit much even for him.
“What time is Peter coming over?”
“It’s easier to ask what he has seen,” Tony said while getting comfy on his alphas chest.
Steve conceded, “alright.”
Getting pregnant, as it tuned out, was hard. Tony knew from the moment he presented that male omegas had a harder time getting pregnant due to unpredictable cycles and limited research. Tony wasn’t much good at paying attention to the “squishy sciences”, but he also never gave much thought to getting pregnant. After all, why would he need to? All his life he detested the idea of finding a nice alpha to settle down with and start popping out kids for, even though only knows it’s all his parents wanted for him. He wanted his own life where he’d be respected for his intellect, not just his body. He’d be a genius, not just somebody’s mate. He wanted to work and make a difference in the world, to know that the world was different, not just different –better, because he was on earth. It was all he wanted really. Mates, especially alphas, were a distraction from all that, or so he thought.
Steve smiled. There were certain skills that Tony’s mother, Maria, had instilled in Tony that remained with him today, and although Tony might not like to admit it, they were sacred to him. Steve always felt honored to be included in the tradition of making the old fashion Italian food.
“Too busy spending time with the mate to watch the news, eh?” Clint interjected while giggling.
“That’s the thing. Couldn’t find a body. Only drag marks leading away into a nearby forest,” Clint replied.
Shield had a strange effect on Steve always. Something about the cubicles where people worked away like drones gave him an uneasy feeling. He knew that the employees were handling more sensitive information than most government workers would ever see in their entire lives, and yet the bored looks and mundane expressions as they typed away was... unsettling. He felt like he was watching people deteriorate in front of him. It wouldn’t surprise him at all if suddenly someone dropped dead in front of him, but instead of a huge commotion, everyone would keep working while a team specifically assigned for such a problem would appear to collect the body and replace it with a new one, like a faulty piece of machinery.
And he was cut off because Steve was reaching for something in a top cabinet. He was reaching, stretching, giving Tony a perfect straight on view of his ass, and Tony wasn’t looking because Tony isn’t gay. Tony liked women. Countless of them, well certainly more than he could remember, could attest to the fact Tony loved women.
“Got ‘em,” Iron Man announces in return, repulsors taking out two Doom-bots simultaneously.
Admittedly, Steve wasn’t sure how they went from agreeing with each other to at each other’s throats, nearly literally, but he’d be damned if he was going to back down.
“I guess we’ll find out.”
There was a commotion outside the room and then the woman reappeared. “I thought they were yanking my chain,” she said.
, clearly he wasn't
“A hospital? Seriously?” Tony had, fortunately, stopped trying to get up, as stupid as he could be about self-injury he wasn’t a masochist.
The boy seemed a bit startled that he was being addressed, in a way only known by those who are used to living their whole lives unnoticed are capable, but managed to respond with an echoed, “Hi.”
“Tony!” Steve watched as a Doombot grabbed Iron Man out of the sky by his ankle. As he ran in the direction of the offending robot he hoped he was imagining the sound of cracking bones in the comm as the bot whipped Tony through the sky like a ragdoll, dropping him to the ground when Steve’s shield cut through its chest. Tony normally would catch himself rather than just falling to earth but this time he had just crumpled. Thankfully the drop hadn’t been a long one.
“‘Sailor?’ No, I’m an Army man, Sailors learned from
with someone who wants even less to be there than me...”
He was almost pathetically grateful when Stark's armor proved to be in a different direction than Steve was ultimately headed.
3 chapters in a week. Are you proud of me? I'm proud of me.
Maybe Peggy had broken him. No. That wasn't fair. He was probably always broken, not only wanting what he couldn't have but wanting what was already someone else's.
"Unless Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect."
Oh, this was bad. This was very, very bad. Tony had a brief moment, as his gauntlets lifted away from the turbine, to think,
He was a soldier, he was used to awaiting orders, the military is one unending cycle of hurry up and wait. So, awaiting orders? He could do that. What he couldn't do was sit around and wonder if, after over half a century, the world would even have a

Turns out: flying in a circle watching a RPM count go up  gave one
Stark seemed angry, overtly angry, and Steve couldn't help his annoyance that Stark even thought he had a reason to be so angry. If anyone had a right to be angry in this situation it was Steve. But, no. Instead he had to put up with Stark's piss poor attitude, jump out of a plane after him, and break up a fight between two friendlies.
“The armor will hold it in place well enough,” Tony replied, obviously trying for flippant but hitting way off mark when he was forced to make another pained sound.
"Right," he said, as Jarvis switched the HUD to battle red, "Army."
But several
“Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark?”
"No, Brucey-bear, not a chance," Tony knew where his insta-friend was going and waved his hand dismissively to cut it off, "You've heard the stories. I grew up on them:
Peter watched them walk away, or at least he watched Cap-, no Steve, walk away. No way that just happened...Did it? He looked at the card in his hand. It shimmered like it was printed in pixels instead of ink. No day would ever be able to compete with this one as the: Best. Day. Ever.
“And how is sitting on me going to accomplish that?”
"Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea."
There’s a period of awkward silence, where Tony thinks he’s gone toe-to-toe with congress committees and board panels and Nick Fury and, on one notable occasion, the god of mischief but this 10 year old kid will be the silent awkward death of him, before Tony realizes the source. There is an elephant in the room that he calls himself an idiot for taking so long to identify. “So what brings you here, Pete? You don’t look hurt or sick to me.”
“I’m on it,” Tony lands next to him for a moment so Steve can wrap his arm around the armor’s shoulders in what the Clint has dubbed “the hug and fly” before taking off. The name is pretty accurate and every time there was a brief moment where Steve wondered what it might feel like without the Iron Man armor in between them.
Steve had been

was a bad thing so he happily took Stark's directions.
“Then sit there,” Steve nodded his chin at an empty section of floor by the far wall.
“There is one a few blocks from here, it’s closest.”
"His name is Phil."
New war, new team, new enemy, same strategy.
Clint was eating what appeared to be a full loaf of toast, the guy
He glanced over at Natasha and Barton. Career soldiers and spies really weren't a good basis for seeing what was normal or not. But this was war and war, for better or worse, was something Steve could do.
he thought and immediately felt guilty for doing so.
“Why?” was Steve’s next question, though it was clear he is leery of the answer.
“Situation under control. Iron Man contained, Captain.” Peter jumped off Tony's lap to do his report, “Look! He gave me an access card.”
. At this point Tony couldn’t handle
They arrived in less than a minute. There were significantly less Doombots than where they left the rest of the team but it appeared they have had more time uninhibited because the street around them is in complete disarray. Tony hovers a few feet above the street and loosens his grip on Steve to let him drop down.
Tony was always many things when he donned the Iron Man armor. He was invincible. He was powerful. He was
“SHIELD is still an hour out thanks to that collapsed tunnel, this is faster.”
So their landing wasn't exactly smooth but Barton could hardly be blamed for that. Losing one of two engines tends to wreak havoc on the handling. But all in all an alien army couldn't be too different from a terrestrial one, especially since their weapons seemed pretty similar to Hydra weapons.
In his lap Peter cringes like he was hoping not to have to answer that exact question and Tony once again thinks that this is a kid who is so very accustomed to being looked over that his natural state is one of invisibility. Tony knew exactly how it felt to be 10 and invisible. “The library’s closed and this is as good a place to hide as any.”
“Mr. Stark,” even though he’d read Anthony “Tony” Stark’s file and knew he was the face behind the metal mask Steve couldn’t help that Howard’s face flashed in his mind as he said the words. He was ashamed of himself for it. He’d spent a good amount of time familiarizing himself with Tony Stark’s presence and influence in this new time in order to avoid just such a happening. There was no way a man as enigmatic as Howard Stark left much room for a son to stake his own claim. Tony Stark doubtlessly wanted to make his own name in the world. From what Steve could see the world wouldn’t let him. Everywhere he looked was Stark Technologies and following close behind was talk of Tony Stark’s “new direction.” Steve wouldn’t say he felt sorry for him but it was a close thing. Stark was clearly brilliant
And there was Tony once again throwing himself in harm’s way.
Saving civilians was going to be a lot harder in this cynical age.
The woman looked up from her clipboard for the first time. She looked at Tony, then Steve, then stared wide-eyed at the armor in the corner for a brief moment before fleeing the room.
God, he was going to have to start a list.
“JARVIS?” Tony gritted out from the bed.
Steve just looked at him in confusion before the one-eyed man took a grip on Steve’s hand and showed Steve his own wrist.
"You and me both, pal," Agent Barton responded, deadpan and straight faced.
"Put on the suit."
They were right back in each other’s spaces, in each other’s faces and this time it was not the anger that was strongest.

“I’m not your mom,” Steve’s back says to him, he was already back at the stove making something that crackles, probably bacon or sausage because he was 40’s like that.

“I’m counting on you, Avenger,” Cap saluted back then proceeded off to the front desk to get Tony checked in.
Never had it taken longer than the actual length of the explosion to get his mind off of personal things and into mission mode. But in the aftermath Stark was the first thing Steve saw and the first thing he thought of.
Typical. Stark was treating this whole thing like one big joke. Like a supposed Norse god was invading Earth just for his personal amusement.
It was a full minute before Steve looked up from his wrist again. By this time the armed men surrounding him had taken a more relaxed stance and the man was looking at him with shadows in his eye.
Being Iron Man, wearing the armor, normally cleared his head, but right now he's lucky he remembers which engine
This new century was a little easier to handle with Tony by his side because he knew that even if he didn’t understand, Tony would. While Tony did, on occasion, use this advantage against Steve he would never let his unfamiliarity get him in trouble. He’d tease him about not knowing what palates or calisthenics were but when lives were on the line he’d take him step by step through the finer points of wifi. Bucky would have laughed at this sentiment. Even with the super soldier serum, Steve still needed someone to look out for him.
Didn't this day just keep getting better and better?

It took Steve a moment to figure out what he meant but when he did, he agreed. The mark VII was unique from older models in that its increased mobility meant it had to be removed as a unit. In a word: standing. Without prompting Steve took one of Tony’s arms over his shoulder, trying to take as much of the other man’s weight as he could without impeding the armor. Tony was gritting his teeth hard to keep from crying out but if a cry still escaped Steve didn’t say a word.
he is. There’s her soulmate. “That’s nice. It’s a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?” She was already so in control, even when she wasn’t.
Just like breathing after the serum, same action preformed in a new way with new tools.
Tony knew he was babbling again. He could hear it, sort of, in an off-in-the-distance way. His mouth was rattling off a short hand version of his thought process, words tumbling out in half-hearted coherence while his mind flitted around like a magpie gathering up the various pieces to compile the grand picture. And there was Steve each step of the way, giving just the right stepping stones, leading by following, until finally, "Son of a bitch."
“But, Mother,” he said, “I don’t have numbers. I have stars.”
"And there's one other person you pissed off." As Loki raised his staff it was clear now he considered them a threat, considered Tony a threat. Perfect.
“You know, you swear like a sailor when you think no ‘sensitive ears’ can hear you,” Tony’s smirk is audible through the comm line as he takes out the Doombot that took Steve by surprise.
The woman just raised an eyebrow at his hand but simply went about taking Tony’s blood pressure.
airplanes it's quite another. This...this was really bad.
this. He had known before any of them that Bruce was loyal enough, good enough, strong enough. Tony’s evaluation was one to heed. True his strategies were all action no substance but he saw solutions, resources, Steve how have never had considered. Deep in his soul that incomplete part of him felt just a little less hollow. He only hoped Tony could forgive him for all those horrible things he didn’t mean.
This trip over the Atlantic was incomparable with the last one. His name was once again going to be associated with death and destruction. No matter how much he tried to separate himself from his history in war to make the Stark name mean something he could be proud of, there it was again: war and horror and "Stark" right in the middle of it.
sound like a scolding housewife at that moment.
It completely boggled his mind that the first thing he’d done, after the Hollowing Commandos had officially received sanction, was to ditch the tights for some heavy-duty leather yet here he was: 70 years into the future and in tights again, like someone had looked at his USO costume and thought, “Yep, those are some swell threads right there.”
If it weren't for...just everything he probably would have found the whole conversation comfortable. Even still, their humor reminded him of Bucky, it was bittersweet but as it stood..."It's been a long day."
It didn't take long for taking on Loki's forces on his own had lost its novelty. Where were they? He was pretty sure he signed up for backup for this part. Of course he's awesome, the Iron Man was a work to shock and amaze, but this was an army. From space.
his second was to let Natasha speak first. He wasn’t blind he could see on her face when she revealed Dr. Banner’s identity to him how much it had cost her. Dr. Banner likely returned because it was the right thing to do but Steve wasn’t naïve enough to think it had
"Son, just don't." Steve knew he was being a bit frank, and probably a bit terrifying as well if the way the agent scrambled off the jet was any indication.
That was it. Tony Stark was insane, insane with a death wish. Why else would anyone purposefully attempt to aggravate Doctor Banner? Stark was going to get everyone of the helicarrier killed and all he did was laugh. “Is everything a joke with you?”
"That's what happens when you're born in 1918." It was almost like Steve was the straight man in a vaudeville routine. Steve. Straight. Wasn't that a laugh.
“Uh-huh,” Tony voiced disbelievingly, like the Hulk would sit out a fight like this, “Or you’ll be suiting up with the rest of us.”
awfully that Rogers would just let him spin around a bit for the heck of it. Something must be...Oh. That guy.
not a sentence he was going to say aloud. “Just me and this awesome suit I designed flying around.”
“Who?” he asked, even though he wanted to ask when. Like maybe it was wrong, maybe they were off, maybe Bruce was his soulmate, maybe he wasn't alone, even though he knew otherwise.
The first thing Tony had done once free of the Iron Man was look at his wrist. The second was to punch a wall because
Before he could protest again Steve had gathered him, armor and all, into his arms and was marching determinedly toward the hospital.
"In heroes."
sorry for my
“You are special, my little one,” she said between clicking steps, “you’re soul is already complete.” While Tony pondered that in the best way he could, his mother fluttered off to finish her plans for whatever social occasion had arisen.
“You know what. I can think of a much better place to hide than a library,” Tony says and accesses a small sliver of a panel on his chest plate, pulling out what looks to be a business card and hands it to the kid, “Here. Use this to get entry into Avenger’s Tower.”
"Don't worry about Stark," Agent Romanoff said, coming up behind him, "Coulson'll make sure he gets to the briefing on time."
It was a long flight back to the Helicarrier and Tony was getting antsy. He was resolutely not thinking about the fact it had been well over 5 hours since he’d last checked his timer. He knew from stories that that the countdown could jump around based on the decisions made on either side and with it this close to the wire it was only the presence of the alien called Loki that kept him from removing his gantlet. Assuming it hadn’t jumped about with the unplanned trip to Germany than at some point during the short fight with Loki he had met his soul mate. But instead of getting to know the person he’d spent his whole life thinking didn’t even exist he was stuck here with an alien and the man he’d envied his father’s affection for.
Son of a bitch.
It was Bruce, in the end, who broke the silence. "You’re too hard on him you know.” He paused before clarifying, “Captain Rogers. It has been a crazy couple of weeks for him.”
It was the last kindness his mother ever gave him.
“That’s Iron Man.” the boy stated, obviously not because Steve didn’t know but simply just to have something to say.
“JARVIS access card format to biometric settings for current holder,” Tony says as Peter turns the card over in his hands, “Access code ‘Avengers’ omega level.” The surface of the card shimmers in the florescent lighting flickering a moment before tiny digital font demands the card holder’s name.
What was it about Stark that made Steve want to protect him and hit him all at the same time?
Far too soon before coffee Tony walked into the kitchen of what had become the commons level of the Avenger’s floors. He had a hangover the likes of which could cripple the Hulk and the only cure was coffee. Lots and lots of coffee. However, that didn’t explain how he came to be there despite starting the night before in Miami.
“I’ve seen worse,” Agent Romanoff’s voice comes over bringing with it no clarity and no comfort. In fact, it sounded like
Unfortunately that meant his oh so helpful brain wanted to focus on the good Captain.
When he was 17 he built Dummy to ease the emptiness that clawed at his soul. He didn’t feel complete. So he built and learned and excelled to keep the emptiness at bay. Maybe, if he was accomplished enough, smart enough, good enough, someone would still love him, without needing to be the other half of his soul.
, he was thinking about Stark
Agent Barton's suit did nothing to hide his zeroes. Somewhere out there he had a soul mate he was going to have to explain today to but at least he had one.
His words no longer felt like his own but it didn’t matter, he took a step into Rogers’ space and it felt good, it felt right. It made something flare in Tony’s chest to be in his face, the closer he got the brighter it became until all he could see were blue eyes and that enveloping blaze.
of the man in front of him being on anyone’s ”Threat Watch List” was the most laughable idea Tony had ever heard. So really he was controlling himself with that angry bees line but seriously. When was the last time the man ever took a swing at someone who wasn’t an enemy of the free world?
“We’ve got reports of more Doombots on 71st,” Coulson’s voice comes in steady on the comms but Steve knows the man is swaying on his feet with inaction.
“It…never had numbers before,” Steve’s voice was barely above a whisper, the sound was nearly lost to him over the never ceasing bustle of New York City but apparently not lost on the other man. When Steve returned his gaze to the man’s face he saw comprehension there, trying to look like understanding. The look clearly took actual effort.
It wasn't long before a woman in scrubs entered the room eyes glued to her clipboard like it was telling her a grave and secret untruth. Steve took one look at her and knew what Tony’s reaction would be. He had just enough time to resign himself to seeing Tony once again flirt despite all circumstances before Tony lived up to his expectations.
Tony stood abruptly. You don't send your one good eye into battle without making sure he made it out.
"He was out of his league. He should have waited. He should have..."
Captain America was not the type to leave a guy hanging. Sure they hadn't been getting along the greatest but, hey, they didn't work together
He was having so much fun in science-land with Bruce that he hardly even noticed when Captain Your-Daddy-Loved-Me-More walked in. At least, that was until Rogers more or less demanded his attention with his comments.
Working together Steve felt the rightness he had first felt when they were agreeing with each other in the lab, but there it had been an echo, a faint outline of potential. Out here, just the two of them, it was blinding. How could anyone encounter that rightness and not want to claim it for themselves?
“Put on the suit. Let’s go a few rounds.”
After a few moments, painful it seemed on Tony's part, of gently manipulating his ankle, the woman announced, "Well he was right about one thing, his ankle isn’t broken.”
“I-I don’t see how that’s a party.”
belonged to other people, tore him apart with guilt. Never mind neither of them knew
Then there’s Steve and life as a genius billionaire superhero was apparently not crazy complicated enough. It was not like he was against being into guys but why this guy and why
“You see,” Bruce said, like it hurt him a little to do so, “I don’t get a suit of armor. I’m exposed. Like a nerve. It’s a nightmare.”
“Thanks, Mom,” Tony snarked at him, reluctantly picking up his fork, knowing from experience he wouldn’t be allowed any coffee until he’d eaten at least some of what he was presented. He’d tried sneaking past Steve to get coffee before and apparently his super-soldiering skills extended to the kitchen as well.
"The room is yours to use until they get here," she said, "I'll get your discharge paperwork."
“I’m sorry, isn’t everything?”
. Then Stark's voice reaches him, "Cap, hit the lever," and he remembers. He has to live. Has to save Howard's son.
So when Fury made a reference to The Wizard of Oz Steve was more than happy to point it out. And if he turned to Stark while he said it, it was only because he was standing behind him and Steve couldn’t see him. Steve did not need Stark’s approval, nor did he want it…He was more than a little glad when the science twins headed off to the lab area waiting for them. Tony Stark was even more confusing to Steve than the rest of the 21st century.
Steve Rogers was distracting.
Steve just frowned harder at his statement. After assuring himself Tony was seated safely on the floor he turned to a nearby young boy, clearly on his own and clearly intent on the interaction between them. “Hi.” Tony was a little more than puzzled by this turn of events.
Tony dropped himself in a chair next to Clint. It was a sausage fest in the kitchen that morning, or at least, Tony guessed it was morning since there was breakfast food present. Neither Thor nor Natasha were present. Thor because he was in New Mexico “aiding in the repair of the Bifrost,” which Tony was
"I think he peed his pants a little," Agent Barton chimed in from where he was flipping switches in the cockpit.
. No one could see Tony Stark break. He was invincible. He was Iron Man. He was a
Nearly 20 years later he met Pepper Potts and while she wasn’t, couldn’t be, the other half of his soul she was the other half of his mind. She remembered everything he forgot or never tried to remember in the first place. She completed him like a limb he hadn’t even known was missing.
Then Dr. Banner looked back at them his eyes told the sadness of his secret, “I’m always angry.”
Back Before, he’d always felt larger than that his skin, bigger than his bones, stronger than his flesh. Bucky had told him he had a Napoleon complex. He’d told Bucky there was no historical backing for the idea that Napoleon was short.
missed hearing where that sizable hickey came from. Tony stopped in his observation of his tablemates when Steve shoved a plate of eggs in front of him with a look that clearly stated that the Star Spangled Man had a plan to shove said eggs down the genius’ throat should he try to once again skip out on breakfast.
"We are
"Is that what just happened?" Steve fought to keep the truth of his annoyance under wraps. No one needed to know Steve Rogers was being eaten alive by loneliness when Captain America was needed for battle. He would just carry on the way he had during the War, shoulders back, chin high, heart breaking.
This time it’s Tony’s turn to shrug, “Cap hates bullies more than anything. We’ll keep you safe.”
“Stark, so help me God, you make one more wisecrack…” Steve couldn’t even think with that man around. He wouldn’t just
Or at least more of it.
count as flying under his own power. It was flying under the power of his brain. It was his brilliance that gave him the ability, it was his arch reactor that made it possible.
It was not the urge to hit Stark that burned hottest it was…it was…
Tony was so used to being the smartest person in the room, so used to looking down to everyone, looking someone in the eye was a
“Yeah,” said Bruce, “I definitely didn’t expect that…”
As humble as Steve tried to keep himself, he truly wasn’t used to people questioning his orders. He hadn’t realized how much he had taken the wartime authority of the stars and stripes for granted until he had a police officer looking him in the eye and asking, "Why the hell should I take orders from you?"
There were intervals where Tony’s words summoned, like a call to Mass. They beckoned him come worship at the altar of his own deep-rooted insecurities like no other force had, not Before and not since. He kept his focus of the battle but those words resonated around his head like the cry of a bell, sharp yet
Minutes later, he leaves, never to return.
Somehow, Steve heard him, paused. “Tony?” He sounded exhausted, and Tony wondered if perhaps they had a chance after all.
. And look at what it has cost.”
He paused. He’d meant to lead up to this. Take them through the steps so they’d all see it this time. So they’d all agree. Maybe he shouldn’t say anything yet. But then… Tony had always had this sense, always known when the math would run true, long before any computer could catch up. Like he could taste the truth of it. Hear it sing to him. It was the most beautiful sound in the universe. And now he felt it simmer up inside of him again, the one taut thread of possibility keeping him sane. To hell with it.
,” he whispered, his voice still painfully hoarse. “I’ve tried, but it doesn’t- I can’t think-”
They walked more corridors to an anonymous door. Rhodey knocked. The door opened a crack, Nat, and she stepped outside when she saw Tony, blocking his view.
Steve loses his breath, loses all thought, finds himself slumped on the floor with a circle of worried faces around him. He apologizes but the faces stay with him. They think he’s a soldier returned fresh from a war and he laughs, bitter, because in truth he would give anything to have a war to return to instead of the empty peace awaiting him, anything for another chance, just one chance to make things right-
May intercepted the dubious offering, laying it on a nearby table. “Let’s hold off on that for a minute. I need to ask Tony some questions about how he’s feeling first.”
In the silence beyond the machines, Steve could easily follow the soft tread of steps returning to his side; with a rustle of fabric, he felt something soft settle over him. The blanket was still warm and smelled of motor oil and cinnamon.
Tony stared at him as if deciding whether to believe his words, then glanced around and shook his head. “I don’t…” He looked back at Steve. “Did we just win?”
“Thank god, I’m starving,” the other man said, then turned his back on Steve and began foraging, chattering as he did. “So T’Challa handed over Zemo to Ross, but he’s headed back to Wakanda with Barnes now.” He slammed the door of the microwave a little harder than necessary. “He took Rhodey with him, if you even care.”
“Yes, I am, and you are too,” Tony answered. “So don’t give up on me yet. You gotta finish the job, use that Gauntlet, Steve.”
Steve stares back at him, then notices. Tony is wearing an all-black suit. Tony hates all-black suits, says they’re boring, says they’re only good for-
“He has his reasons,” Tony said, his mouth grim. He and Bruce always did have a bond above and beyond the rest of the team. Science bros, they called it. Well, Tony called it, loudly and enthusiastically. Bruce pretended to endure the nickname, but Steve hoped he enjoyed it too.
“How long?” Tony asked, suddenly needing to understand. When Steve had known. How long he’d been waiting.
“Ty, slow down,” Tony tried. When the blond man ignored him, Tony felt a surge of anger that for once he didn’t squash. Windows everywhere. He wouldn’t dare.
. All possible futures after that point would be undone. Tony had carefully suggested that Nebula or Thor could, in fact, preserve this future if the rest of them wished to survive, but the idea of continuing on in this brutal reality with just a vague hope that things were better
He surfaced slowly to find someone was combing gentle fingers through his hair, humming softly. Like he was a sick child, someone in need of comfort. People didn’t… do that. Not to Tony Stark. He automatically opened his eyes to look for witnesses, ready to tell whoever it was to back the hell off, but instead of a stranger he was stunned to see Peter’s radiant aunt leaning over him.
“Huh,” Tiberius said, his cold blue eyes sliding away in dismissal. “We won’t linger, then.”
But when Tony turned back, there was a trembling smirk across his face. “Talk to
“What happened?” she asks. “Steve,
Tony was dying.
The Soul Stone shook her head. “Everything.”
“Eh,” Tony said, waving a hand in dismissal. “I’ve heard worse.”
, Steve thought. The despair rose up in his throat.
“I know,” Tony whispered back. “Sorry.” A pause. “Technically though, that promise was more regarding the fight with Thanos than a perpetual commitment...”
Steve felt something stir within him, but couldn’t put a name to it. “I… don’t know,” he said eventually. “I just woke up.”
It was too late, he realized. The Tony who would have argued with her, who would have fought for her, the man she deserved: he was six months gone, wiped out with the snap of a madman’s fingers. Pepper, alive, was already a gift beyond measure. He could survive letting her go.
Tony was studying him with such care. “Some people would consider that a miracle,” he said.
. “I’m saying you don’t have to pretend,” he said gently. “Not for me.”
Tony checked his own hands; no discernible growth. But he asked. “How long was I out?”
He came fast with a stuttering cry, his orgasm both joyous and shattering, Tony the only thing holding him together. After, Steve buried his face into Tony’s neck and gripped him tight, his body still trembling violently. As he waited for the dizziness to fade, for the world to settle back around him, he felt Tony trace the contours of his face, his fingertips gliding softly over Steve’s closed eyes.
“Yeah,” Steve said.
Captain Steve Rogers groans as consciousness returns. His body is so depleted that lying on the floor feels oddly appropriate. Almost pleasant. Yet as awareness floods back, it brings a burst of unwelcome clarity.
A few days after his talk with Strange, Tony asked Friday to calculate the odds not only of Steve’s successful revival, but also of Steve remembering everything that had happened up until his death. When it took her a week just to estimate how long it would take her to complete the calculation, he figured he was better off not knowing.
Tony didn’t move. “Good morning.”
Tony stood, but kept the suit activated. “Aren’t you freezing?”
Tony barked a hard laugh. “It’s the end of the world. I think we’re out of time.”
“Aside from Vision? Wanda, Sam, T’Challa, Rocket’s tree friend. Thor is alive but… he’s not doing well. Bruce thinks it’s shock. Hasn’t spoken a word since it happened.”
Shuri shot him a cool-it glance that she must have learned from her mother, but eventually she nodded. “I finally had a couple days to complete the analysis on his sample. The serum… I believe it was originally based on the same elixir that grants the Black Panther their powers.”
Yet despite his best efforts, the rest of the memory eluded his grasp. Steve knew if he asked for specifics, Tony would tell him, but unable to stomach such humiliation, he scrambled for safer territory. “Uh, was Sam here earlier?”
“Excellent,” Tiberius said, but he was irritated, Tony could tell. “We’ll have an extra invite printed. It was a pleasure meeting you at last, Bruce, but Tony and I really need to get going. Long drive home.”
“Uh,” Steve said eloquently. “Surprise?”
“Mrrow,” he growled, and opened his eyes. Tony was standing by the window, the dark-haired woman again at his side.
Distantly, Tony heard Wilson’s voice over the comms. “Cap, report?”
“I know, I know but… I can’t, Tony, I… The future, it’s… There’ll always be a fight, and this means there’ll always be me, so I’ll have to keep fighting, and I can do it, I can fight but every time it takes more and it’s blocking me out, he’s blocking me out so there’s room for nothing else and there’s nothing left except fighting and waiting and watching everyone go on without me and it’s too much, I can’t, I’m not- I’m tired, I don’t want to fight anymore, please don’t make me fight, Tony, I’m nearly gone, it’s gone, there’s nothing left and
in his ear encouraging him to take bigger risks, giving him a suit so he can fight bigger crime. But what’s your endgame here, Stark? You gonna offer him a spot on the team? Give him a fancy pen so he can sign away his future to someone like Ross? Or did you even bother to
Steve knew it was rude, but he couldn’t help staring. Earlier, Tony had been utterly distraught, yet now he looked so peaceful. Steve wanted to memorize the exact way Tony’s eyelashes curled against his cheek. The curved lines of exhaustion pulling at his mouth. He longed to draw every detail. Keep him forever.
Luckily, Steve has an answer prepared. “Because your world got screwed the second Loki escaped with the Tesseract. There’s no telling how much danger he poses, even with Thanos neutralised.” He looks around the table, halfway believing his own words. “I’m here to help clean up our mess.”
Clint sat up, delighted to indulge in his favorite topic before a fresh audience. “It’s all of his usual bullshit, but now his diva ass doesn’t bother to show up for anything involving the Avengers until we’re already on the field. He literally phones it in to briefings, bails on press conferences, he flat-out refuses to train with us. This past year he’s spent all his time either out west or off with Stone getting his rich ass kissed by paparazzi.  Honestly, he’s been acting like he’s above the team ever since his buddy Ross fucked us with the Accords, and I’m over it.”
He sighed and quit punishing the reinforced punch-bag. The Queen had requested his presence in her private lab, if he could spare the downtime, and Steve was happy to oblige. The pleasant ache of fatigue in his muscles was already fading as he took a quick shower. Dammit. It was a sign he needed more vigorous exercise than he’d been getting lately, and he made a mental note to ask Thor to spar with him tomorrow. The Asgardian’s usually ebullient self was still much reduced, but he might agree to the challenge. He’d ask Clint, if not. The loss of his family had stripped everything from the archer except an inexorable thirst for revenge; until the team’s intervention a couple weeks in, he’d been running himself into the ground with twenty-hour shifts while volunteering on the hottest missions. Steve worried about him the most, but he had no solutions beyond what they were already doing.
clear,” the super-soldier whispered. “You and I both know you are a sniveling coward who will say anything to save his own neck, but eventually, you will find yourself thinking back on this moment as if it’s in the past, and you may start to think of revenge.”
A gnawing ache woke him from the deepest sleep he could remember in years. The hunger was back.  Tony opened his eyes to the morning light, blinked once, twice at what he saw. Steve.
Getting sassed by a rodent would have been one of the top things Steve missed about this future, if he could miss anything about this future. As it turned out, time travel via Infinity Stone was nothing like the movies, with their alternate timelines and, uh, something about a cartoon man and donuts? Tony had tried to explain it once. Basically a wormhole or quantum machine could theoretically create a tunnel back to the past and let someone travel through, but the future they left would continue to exist independently, even if the traveller’s individual experience branched off into an alternative future.
Steve’s jaw was visibly clenched. “I’m sorry.” He hesitated. “Is it okay if I hug you?”
Steve’s chest clenched tighter, a stabbing echo of his childhood asthma attacks, shame and fear the worst torment even as the air itself became his enemy. People often called Steve Rogers brave, always called him honest, but under the weight of Tony’s raw gaze, his resolve stumbled, and something weaker than the truth fell off his tongue.
Tony shut his hanging mouth with an audible click. “Uh… Okay. Huh.”
They followed her inside. Rocket was standing a respectful distance from Thanos’ Gauntlet. Tony let out a low whistle once he caught sight of it. “Guess that’s why he left it on the shelf.”
As if Steve needed an explanation. People can talk. None of his business. He sat anyway. He could be calm.
“Then I am sorry,” the faceless man said. “The terms are absolute. Beloved life is the price. A soul for a soul.”
But somehow it was worse.
When Steve’s vision cleared, Schmidt had vanished.
Perhaps Tony thought so too. “Take it back,” he said.
And Steve doesn’t mean to let it slip so casually, had meant to break it to him gently in private, but the question
Time passed and he could have been anywhere, but Steve wanted to see Nebula try on the Gauntlet before they left, and so Tony was there in the hut when the android picked up the golden glove and put it on for the first time. Just in case, Eitri had made it also large enough for Thor, but the metal artefact fit over her right hand - for balance, she’d mockingly insisted - as if grown there. Nebula stood tall, gave a curt nod to signal her readiness. Satisfied, Steve made to leave, but Tony hung back, something about the sight deeply bothering him.
They clung to each other, messy sweaty bodies adrift in an infinite universe.
“Hulk,” he said, then his throat closed up because this was so wrong, so
“This all started with me,” Steve said hoarsely, acid regret in his throat. “With Siberia, with me lying to you-” He broke off to steal another breath from the mask, internally cursing his every weakness, past and present.
“Partially,” Steve admitted; the other man dissolved once more into giggles that Steve had to work hard not to enjoy.
that far ahead?”
“Oh, great,” Tony mutters, then fixes Steve with a glare. “Okay, Samurai Jack, that was Bruce’s theory, what was mine?”
, and then Steve was kissing him back, was in fact pinning Tony against the bathroom door and devouring him, ravenous, his mouth eager enough,
“Your leader carries the Space Stone, what I once knew as the Tesseract. This is one of six gems…” the faceless man began but Tony rolled his eyes and cut in.
“Um, and I brought you a sandwich, Mr Stark, in case you’re hungry,” he heard Peter add. “Sorry if you don’t like falafel, it was the only one left.” Judging by its appearance, that was for good reason, but Tony realized he was hungry enough to eat it anyway.
“Going super-galactic, surprisingly not a five-star experience,” Tony muttered tiredly.
, you can’t put me under. I don’t want to- please, Tony, don’t let them put me under-”
, holy and free. Over time, Steve had found his own path to the wilderness; there he had found the artist waiting, impatient, beyond control, but somehow, miraculously, his; in that wild place, Steve had made his home, building deep roots amid the mysteries.
Muscle by muscle, Steve forced himself to relax, closing his eyes against the stinging spray of hot water. His mistake was embarrassing, and all too clear in hindsight, but at least there was an obvious remedy available to him.
“Another mask?” Steve asked. His voice was so faint.
“What the fuck, what the fuck…” the billionaire was muttering to himself, but the Captain had already commanded Steve to move forward towards the structure; even in his shock, Tony was quick enough to keep pace at Steve’s side.
With Tony at his side, the modern world felt welcoming in a way he’d never expected. Really, Steve had grown to rely on him so much, losing his guidance would-
The next time he woke, he sat up on his own, so suddenly it startled Rhodey onto his feet.
A part of him thought he might never stop; his words seemed to spill forth in an endless flood, his mind spinning visions of the life he and Steve would spend together, scenes so vivid he could almost watch them unfold on the blank walls around him. Steve refused to succumb to sleep, but despite his best efforts, he couldn’t keep his eyes open. Tony couldn’t look away.
“Sometimes he terrifies me,” May admitted. “Sometimes, I look at him and I am so scared for his future that I can’t remember how to breathe. But what Peter does, everything he chooses to do, it all flows from the very best part of him. And that means I couldn’t shut Spider-Man down if I tried. I would be destroying exactly what makes Peter’s heart so special-”
“Steve, please, just stop a second and talk to me,” he said urgently. “This was never the plan, what the hell are you doing?”
Red Skull shook his head, raised placating hands. “I do not seek to offend. Truly. But now I understand your quest, I believe I have good news. The Soul Stone is here.”
Given the last time Tony had seen the man he’d tried to kill him, it was a bold move. Decent, really. And Tony didn’t have it in him to refuse. “Thanks,” he said, and stepped into the small room. It too looked basically unchanged, except now, someone else’s stuff was scattered around, stuff he hadn’t seen before. Boots here. A metal arm there. Last time, Steve must have cleaned up before Tony got back from Titan. Funny. He’d never mentioned it was Bucky’s room originally. Made a certain sense. Close as he could get.
strained, given the situation, Tony wouldn’t have blamed him. But no, he sounded cool as Christmas.
Tony felt as though he was falling through the ground, the revelation throwing his understanding into new, desperate configurations. So it couldn’t be Nebula. But then… Thor had kept his distance from everyone since losing his people, losing his family. Everyone except Bruce, but… oh god. The Hulk. So it couldn’t be Thor, either. That only left…
Yet Tony chose not to comment; instead he began to speak, low and soothing, rattling off facts about the space network, thoughts about his suit, his myriad ideas about how to find the lost Soul Stone. Nothing really personal, Steve noticed, but he couldn’t blame Tony for his reserve considering Steve’s own betrayal had helped to shatter that line of communication forever. He lay back and closed his eyes, concentrating on the lilt of Tony’s chatter; of course, sleep soon came calling, but this time Steve resisted. He’d gone two long years without the sound of Tony’s voice. He could sleep later.
There was real concern in her voice. Tony felt like clawing it out of her throat. “Maybe you and your boyfriend should just mind your own goddamn business,” he snarled, imagining the two of them discussing his misery, curled up snug and precious in their own cosy lives.
“Steve… eyes fellas?” Tony felt like his mind was melting. Sure, he’d known how much Steve obviously loved Barnes, but he’d figured Barnes to be a special exception, not Steve’s general rule.
Steve kept his gaze steady on Tony’s face, looking up at him. “See, Tony? You’re not alone anymore. Please, just tell us how we can help.”
She was the first to
Tony laughed, and it was the most beautiful sound he’d ever heard. “Cap! Language.”
Steve opened his eyes, wanting to sneak a look at their faces, watched as one by one they had the same idea, met his gaze, each other’s. Only Tony still had his eyes closed, directly opposite him, and Steve let himself look at the billionaire’s face, let himself savor the sight. Job within the job. Tony opened his eyes, looked around at everyone else. Then Steve. Only Steve.
“Fuck you,” the other man said, his gaze alien and cold and wrong. “You don’t ever say his name to me again.”
Rhodey took one long breath and put his hand on Tony’s arm, and he knew. But his friend confirmed it anyway. “Pepper’s gone. I’m so sorry, Tony.”
But Tony was shaking his head, of all things looking panicked. “

“Get naked,” Nat added, then flashed a tiny smirk. “As it were.”
Enough. “On your feet, soldier,” Tony commanded. He stood in front of Steve, blocking his view of the horrific reports, and held out his hand.
Tony froze in place, shoulders rigid; he slowly swung round to face him. “The airport,” he said coolly, his expression unreadable. “Suit got taken out. He fell.”
“You’re Thanos,” he said, knowing but wanting to be sure.
“Siberia was tough on him, you know,” Tony heard Barnes say, and he blinked at the former assassin. “He hated fighting you.”
When Peter burst through the door, it took a sharp nudge from Rhodey before Tony could bear to open his eyes, Bruce shooting to his feet as if on guard.
“The Mark VII weighs close to half a ton with me inside,” Tony, faceplate up, began to squirm a bit as if this emphasized his point, “put me down before your arms fall off.”
Then Stark has his hand on Steve’s shoulder and that is…not ok, “You know damn well why. Back off.”
Rounding on themselves and bringing back to the same conclusion over and over again: soul mate or no, he had to break it off with Pepper.
Clearly Stark was thinking around the same lines because as soon as the jet landed he stormed off.
“Captain,” came the response bearing no inflection. Steve wasn’t sure if that was the armor or not. He had hoped that his past experience working with a Stark would help him in dealing with some of the issues he’d read about in Tony Stark’s file but as they boarded the quinjet with Loki in hand he wasn’t so sure.
"Was he married?"
But Bruce didn’t know “exposed.” Exposed was not the raging power to take down anything in your path. No. Exposed was trusting your life to anyone who knew about the little light in your chest. Exposed was having that trust turned back on you. And he told him so…in so many words.
to get the call to action. He was
"Stark, I'm here!"
It was at that moment Tony realized that Steve has been talking all this time and was expecting an answer to some unknown question. So he shoved an unearthly amount of eggs in his mouth. His hangover’s just making the whole world a little more wibbly-wobbly than usual, yep, that’s it, he’s not avoiding Steve’s question at all.
It was hard to reconcile the man currently sitting at the controls as the same man who had led the attack on his friends and coworkers just hours ago but it was clear Agent Barton wouldn't be forgetting it anytime soon. Steve felt bad for pitying him and even worse for how much better it made him feel to know someone was having a worse day than him.
Even as the armor curled around him, Tony could still feel Rogers' hand at the small of his back. God, what he wouldn't give for a moment to
“Oh no, please don’t say that, you’ll just encourage him.”
His secrets had secrets but he kept them for a reason, always a reason, so what could possibly be his reasoning behind hiding this from them. In the end it really didn't matter because there was no mistaking what he'd seen on Fury's face.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t move, you’ll only make it worse,” Steve said, taking out a series of Doombots with a ricocheting action with his shield while engaging another one with his fists.
Why did he have to be so...everything his father had ever said he was and more? Why couldn't Tony just
As he watched the son of his dead friend circle the large meeting table spouting gibberish he was almost grateful for the distraction. Timers were everywhere and he needed something, anything to keep his attention from another missed chance. And Tony Stark seemed to come custom made for distraction, firing off words and ideas faster than Steve could find a reference point. It was dizzying and frustrating but it was distracting and he was exactly what Steve needed.
“You don’t know that it’s broken.” The look Steve gave him was aimed to shut him up and would have but Tony deigned to ignore him. Instead extending his hand towards the woman, “Tony Stark.”
"Loki needs a power source."
Steve turned to join Tony in staring at Clint as Bruce chipped in, spoon paused half-way to his mouth, “Does that make the rest of us their children?”
Even before Steve engaged the hostile he was already sick of this. He knew what his countdown read, he’d taken a good long look at it before donning his new red gloves, he was supposed to be meeting his soul mate in mere seconds but instead he was battling an alien with horns and a scepter.
Of course Rogers had to speak up, ruin his Bruce-buzz. If Tony wasn't so off kilter with the world in general right now he'd examine what kind of karma lay in store for people who got annoyed with Captain America but for the moment he just wanted to stick out his tongue and say, "Shut up, Rogers, no one was talking to you," like he was 5 years old again.
Steve just sighed, and Tony wondered what the super-soldier was thinking, but he didn’t share. Instead, Steve got to his feet, Tony following suit, their hands now fused together at a strained angle. The super-soldier studied the newly reshaped Gauntlet, Tony standing awkwardly behind him. It wasn’t lost on Tony that Steve was even now avoiding his gaze. His fuckup on Vormir was clearly still in play, and there was no reason for that to hurt so much, but it did.
Happy paused. “I think she has some things to say that you might wanna hear, so… Anyway it won’t be for another couple of weeks, I’m on that Australia trip with Pepper first but soon as I get back, I’ll let you know what day she’s thinking…” Another pause. “I know you’re busy but I really hope you can make it this time, it would mean a lot to the kid. And it’s been… It’d just be good to see you, Tony. Uh. Okay, bye.”
“Shall I connect you, boss?” Friday asked through his earpiece. Discreetly. Carefully.
?” Tony demanded, pushing Steve away just enough so he could see his face. “
“What can I do, boss?” Friday asked quietly.
Yet whatever Ty was planning, he realized, soon it wouldn’t be Tony’s problem. Soon, he would be… A giddy determination rose up through him; he turned to Steve. “I’m ready.”
Right now, Tony is bleeding out on Titan, and Steve has no way to
Steve’s sigh was strong enough to tickle. “Then I guess it’s been around six and a half years.”
“But the serum fixed me, it could fix a lot of other people…” Steve said, his mind whirling with unfamiliar possibilities. Up until Shuri’s request, he had somehow assumed Erskine’s formula was an unreachable part of his past. A relic, buried in time. Not something that could affect any future but his own. But it would be selfish of him to keep such an opportunity to himself.
“Hey,” Steve murmured, his words still a little foggy. “You made a friend.”
“I’m glad you’re here now,” Steve told him.
“It didn’t have to be you,” Steve said.
Into the silence, Steve Rogers stepped forward, shield raised. “We will remember him ourselves,” he told Thanos, his voice calm and strong. “Right after we defeat you.”
All he could hear were children squabbling over the best way to die.
Peter. In a blast of pure panic, Tony considered smashing out a window to escape. He could deploy the suit before he hit the ground.
“Tony…” He heard Steve sigh his name like he’d used to, exasperation and fondness and rebuke in one. Perhaps for the last time.
“Wakanda,” he heard Tony agree. “They’re on full alert. Uh, also, Thanos lied. Thor’s alive, and he’s on his way home.”
“You think
All the furniture was gone except for the bed, the walls entirely replaced by giant screens that were playing videos of-
that kid, he’d
And so, when he could stand, he returned to his post. Tony knew there was no place for him by Steve’s side, but leaving the injured man alone was unthinkable. When the morning came, when the others returned… Then, he’d go. And he’d make sure Steve would never have to look at him again.
Patience, Bucky had advised. That never had been Steve’s best attribute. But he’d learn. If it helped earn Tony’s forgiveness, he would learn.
Tony doesn’t reply, just turns his face into Steve’s chest as if to hide. Steve holds him until he falls asleep, then settles him on the couch. As Tony sleeps, he lights a fire for the first time in weeks, then breaks open one of the least-awful MRE packs to heat some stew. Then he sits on the floor, slouching against the wall, and watches over the flames.
It was enough. Steve cut him off with a kiss that tasted of surrender then took himself in hand, and Tony helped guide Steve home. As the first delicious stretch intensified almost to pain, Tony groaned Steve’s name aloud. The other man drew in a sharp hooked breath and closed his eyes, but kept pressing deeper, careful yet relentless. It was so close to too much, but also not enough. Tony reached up and gripped Steve’s head in his hands, watched how concentration painted lines on his face, adored him. And then Steve was fully within him, and it was too much, and it would never be enough.
“Barely twenty,” Tony answered. “It’s not even noon yet.” Steve just nodded. “Everyone sends their regards,” the other man went on, fidgeting with his sleeve. “And Nat reported in again. The whole planet’s on high alert but so far, no sign of activity. And, uh, Barnes left a message. He said, ‘please tell Stevie to remember the Mrs Temper incident’.”
He was so, so sorry.
Somewhere, he could hear a woman talking. She sounded worried, so Steve forced his eyes to open. Tony had backed away until he was standing by the wall. As far away as he could get. A dark-haired woman had her hand on his arm, and Tony was shaking his head.
“…oh yeah?” His voice sounded thick with an emotion Steve couldn’t identify, but when he looked up, Tony was smiling. “How do I know you’re not just saying that to get in my pants?” the other man teased, and Steve’s heart soared with awe at how even now, in this strange new arena of intimacy, Tony could stay so irrepressibly
Days pass.
“I know she will,” Tony said, and that won a smile from the young Queen. “And if it’s magic you need, maybe the wizard can help you out. Talk to Nebula and Thor. Whoever goes, they can bring the message back to him.”
look that would appear on Steve's face when Tony told him that he loved him-
The super-soldier froze at his touch, silent; then he grabbed onto Tony’s encircling arms as if he were drowning, and they sat together wordlessly, watching as the sun set the horizon ablaze in one last wash of ecstatic color.
Slowly, Tony stopped listening, unable to keep up with Steve and the team’s responsible words; instead, he let himself fade, his mind drifting through wistful memories like a child wandering through empty rooms, leading his exhausted body onward into sad, scattered dreams.
“Shuri took my blood,” he found himself saying.
“I’m sorry,” she said. Tony glared as if offended by her pessimism, but Helen held firm. “That will take time, and…”
“A full day and a half,” came an answer from across the lab. Shuri was sitting at a large and complicated-looking interface, her rapid movements suggesting she was busy. “Which is almost insulting, given how good I am at fixing you white boys. There were a couple times you tried to die on me.” She paused long enough to glance over her shoulder. “Don’t try it again.”
Ignoring Steve and the assassins’ quizzical gaze, Tony pulled out his phone, quick fingers popping the case. “Great job, Fri,” he said. “Now get your ass clear.” Tony connected the hidden component and turned the phone back over, waiting for Friday’s confirmation she’d removed all traces of herself from the building’s network. Only then did he enter the command.
Oh. “Technically that’s three conditions,” he found himself pointing out.
The young doctor looked deeply uncomfortable. “I’m so sorry, Mr Stark, but I really thought-”
Rogers didn’t answer, and for one horrifying moment, Tony wondered…
, and, in service to the metaphor, Tony was
Yet as the minutes slipped by and Tony stayed gone, a restless unease rose within him, wearing away at his equilibrium. The serum hunger soon drove him towards the kitchen, where he spent a busy hour raiding the freezer and cooking the best meal he could assemble. Yet despite his enhanced appetite, he struggled to clear his plate, and had to force himself to swallow. Cleaning the kitchen and checking over his gear ate up another hour or so, but eventually he ran out of distractions. He found himself back by the window, staring without seeing as the ocean waves rose and fell.
“You led him to the Soul Stone,” Steve said, Captain’s voice forcibly level. “Can you show us where it was kept?”
Tony’s mouth snapped shut, pure shock on his face. “You… what?”
“But are you
In one quick motion, he had pulled off his visor, was standing, was leaning over Steve and then- oh, god- he was tasting Steve’s lips against his own, hearing the hitch in other man’s breath,
“Ah, the Captain,” the alien said, an odd note of reverence entering his voice. “Man out of time. I must confess, your story moves me deeply, for I too have suffered the loss of an entire living world. I too have been cast out, left to wander without a home. Therefore to you alone, I will show mercy.”
It was cruel, how good grief looked on him.
“He wasn’t that bad, at first,” he whispered. “I didn’t really… It all felt so…” He broke off, shaking his head. “It was too hard to explain. Then he started getting worse, but it was too hard to talk about. He slipped up a few times, but people just see what they want to see.”
“I know,” he said. “You said you were gonna fix it. But I still don’t understand what ‘it’ is. Can you… could you take me through what happened, out there?”
There were several welcome faces gathered in the mess hall for the evening meal, but Sam carefully kept them at bay, leaving Steve to eat without interruption. Good.
And as usual, when Steve lost his focus, grief surged forward, spilling memories into the void of his misery.
“Get the fuck off me, Ty,” Tony snarled, breaking his arm out of his fiancé’s grip and stopping dead.
, Tony, no, you
“Nonetheless,” he said, and shrugged. She neither argued nor threatened him, which was her equivalent of a thank-you bouquet.
“I yelled at you.”
Bruce’s glance slid away, and for one dizzying moment Tony thought his friend was going to decline. But Bruce came through. “I’ll always be there for Tony,” he said instead.
“-sorry to wake you, Steve,” someone told him from far away, and something sharp pinched his hand.
“Right doesn’t mean not-stupid,” the billionaire snapped, then gritted his teeth, not wanting to literally order the super-soldier back to shore but too uneasy to stand around waiting either. “Ugh whatever, you do you, but Bruce wants water so…” He let his words trail off as he grabbed one of the empty containers and dipped it into the water, forcing out the air bubbles. The suit made the job easy, even on his own, and he hoisted the full container out of the river without any difficulty. He grabbed the second and dunked it too in the water, but as he picked it up, the container was propelled from below by Steve. Staggering back under the unexpected momentum, Tony swung the container safely to one side and turned back to find an annoyed Steve dripping on his rock.
“You don’t remember me?” the Soul Stone asked, a glint of merciless ice in her eyes. “How unmannerly. But I know you, Thanos, son of A’lars. To win my favor, you freely murdered the one you loved. I know exactly who and what you are.” Gamora gasped and backed away from her, Tony placing a comforting hand on the child’s shoulder.
,” Steve blurted out; the denial had launched itself straight from his gut, bypassing all conscious thought. Only by focusing desperately did he manage to avoid embarrassing himself further. “I mean… Tell me what happened with Thanos.”
There were the sounds of an indignant scuffle before a second voice broke through. “Hi, can anyone hear me? Hi, this is Bruce Banner, uh, I’m actually from Earth, hello.”
“Only if they survive,” Shuri muttered, and Tony winced at the razor-sharp truth in her words. Rocket had told them how close the Guardians had come to dying using just the Power Stone. Since Vision had used the Mind Stone for years without any negative effects, Tony believed Nebula’s synthetic body stood an excellent chance of wielding all six Infinity Stones without disintegrating, and he reckoned her mind would hold together through the power of pure spite. On the other hand, Thor had shrugged off a direct blast from a star without a scratch, so even if the android failed in her vengeance, the Asgardian would be on hand to attempt the Devastation’s undoing.
As the alien ship came into view, the small crowd grew dutifully quiet. Tony felt rather than saw someone slip in behind Barton, and turned his head automatically. And there
Tony sits neatly beside him. There is still something tentative about his movements. Something weary in his eyes. Shuri says the healing will never really end.
“…what is this?” he manages.
Tony sent mental apologies towards his friends, knowing the rumor would be all over the papers in the morning. Yet he’d rather be indiscreet than risk Ty taking against Bruce. “Never quite got started before he left, but I’d put money on it still.”
“You’re in a temporary pocket of unreality that stands outside of space and time,” she said smoothly. “I am the Soul Stone. None of us are alive as you understand it, but we all possess an awareness of our existence, within our spheres of specific interest. I myself am patterned after all that is alive which in turn patterns all that lives; this invites me to develop certain characteristics that resemble what you call consciousness. You might say that I am awake while the others merely dream. As for the rest of your questions, well,” and here she grinned. “That would be telling.”
eyes - had automatically turned to Tony, just in time to see the dart of pure terror cross his face.
- and suddenly Tony was very glad of the nanobots encasing him, preserving his dignity.
Instead of explaining, Dr Palmer tossed him the phone and waved him out of the room so she could finish her work on Steve’s array of machines. Tony lingered near the doorway, and Steve watched him listen to whoever was on the phone as two masked nurses started swapping his bed’s standard fabric curtains for four large plastic sheets.
“Take me to him, Rhodey.”
Tony was full of complaints, had suggested the android open a portal to the top of the mountain so they could walk down instead. Nebula had refused, saying it wouldn’t feel right. That there was something waiting. Something… holy. That revelation had shut Tony up. Mostly from the existential crisis it had provoked. Finding someone or something had cut a trail around the mountainside hadn’t helped.
? With the situation on Titan so fragile, Steve still clinging desperately to him every night as they slept, and Tony halfway losing the ability to breathe whenever the super-soldier left his sight? This was no time for… complications. Setting aside the minor issue that was Steve’s total lack of interest in men who weren’t Barnes, once this future was erased, they’d both forget everything anyway. And it felt worse somehow, knowing that they’d both forget. If in some universe they ever did… get complicated… he thought it would deserve to be remembered. At least, Tony would want to remember. Steve probably just wanted to get back to Barnes. Just as Tony would go back to Pepper.
Tony’s mind kept spinning on the word, marveling at how syllables could fit together so well when Steve’s ribs-
03:57, Tuesday 3rd July 2018
But they all knew the answer, even before Red Skull confirmed it. “I am sorry for your loss.” Nebula turned away, the blue glow vanishing, and she crossed to the edge of the mountain, staring dully at nothing.
“Steve,
“Tony? What happens now?” the other man murmured, in that broken, wistful voice that Tony had secretly hoped to never hear again.
“Okay fine, fine, but jalapeno to ghost pepper, how spicy we talkin’?” Tony asked, winking at the nearest wide-eyed journalist.
Tony watched the super-soldier look around, misery threatening to sink him right through the floor. He didn’t need to look at the screens. There had been so many videos he didn’t remember.
name. They’ll be far too busy watching the legendary perversions of the infamous Tony Stark.”
Hours pass.
He’d just started work on the mandatory pudding when the alarms began.
They’d won.
Steve closes his eyes against the raw hurt in Tony’s voice, how lost he sounds.
It was a sensible idea, except that if Steve woke to find Tony anywhere near him, he’d consider it more a nightmare than a comfort. Yet the team would need to rest before the next attack, and so Tony nodded, aghast to find all of his words had deserted him again.
Steve looked it over. Clean in and out. No problem. “Not for long.” Tony made a face but didn’t stop him as Steve broke the end off the arrow and pushed the rest clear through. The pain was a blaze of wildfire, but it passed, and Tony was waiting on the other side. There was a smear of Steve’s blood on the billionaire’s face, a look of which Steve did not approve, and Tony held still while Steve wiped it away.
, but I’ve no idea where to go from there.”
he realized, half-panicked at what that could mean.
And the screens changed, now showing-
There was a mask over his face, and Helen’s soft voice was telling him to inhale slowly, to relax, count to four. Steve opened his eyes, suddenly greedy for every moment he could reach, every sight he could savor. But he couldn’t see… “Tony?” he tried to say, barely recognizing his own voice.
He wanted to smash everything and let the nothing in.
Tony has to clear his throat before speaking. “For what it’s worth,” he says, “I’m really glad you did.”
Clint is silent. Then he yells. Points out what Steve has done. The danger of them knowing the cost ahead of time. The cruelty when in order to beat Thanos they’ll
Steve looked down at his body, his arms. Remembered Thanos, the battle. Looked up at Tony, who for some reason was sitting in a chair by his bed, huddled into a blanket. Steve could see something like worry in the man’s dark eyes. Something like pity. A hot, desolate panic bubbled up through him, that Tony should see him so compromised. That after two long years of ignoring Steve’s existence, only now would Tony deign to look at him.
“Are you okay?” Steve asked eventually, and Tony met his gaze before barking a short, ugly laugh.
After about an hour’s climb, they arrived.
“Just you,” Steve whispered. “Only you. Please.” He heard muttered voices around him, then Bucky and Sam were gone, and it was just Steve and Tony, Tony who was still with him, still there. For a long minute they sat quietly together on the floor, limbs entwined, and it should have been peaceful but Steve could still feel his mind dripping away, sliding deeper into some unfathomable abyss, an opposite sky into which he could sink and lose himself, filling with emptiness forever and ever. Some distant part of him admired the irony that, of all things, he might be running out of time; then the sick stab of panic arrived, and he sat bolt upright to look Tony in the eye.
It wasn’t a hard question, but Steve actually had to think about it. “Can I just say ours? I kinda don’t see a difference anymore. If it affects him, it affects me.”
For the tiniest of moments, Stark’s eyes met Steve’s, then flicked heavenward in exasperation. And Steve couldn’t help but give the tiniest grin in response.
, thought Steve. Unable to speak, he just stared at Tony, a fuzzy sort of sunshine rising within him.
“Speak for yourself, Mistoffolees,” Tony muttered. He hadn’t really meant for anyone to hear, but Shuri laughed heartily; no one else bothered to respond. For some reason, Tony thought of Peter, of how even after two years, the kid was still too awed in his presence to fully laugh at his jokes; Tony found it both awkward and adorable.
And the Soul Stone
“Right here,” he heard, and Tony was there, by the glass. He hadn’t seemed this close before, he hadn’t… Steve gazed up at him, his chest heaving with wishes-
“I’m so confused,” Bruce said, “but sure.”
When he was first rescued from the ice, people with kind faces kept asking him how much he remembered of the crash. Whether he had been awake when he’d hit the water. If he’d felt the ice. Steve had told them he’d been knocked out on impact, that he hadn’t felt the water rise, that he’d slept through the ice.
“Did I?” Tony asked softly; with a sick, free-falling sensation, Steve realized that Tony had never actually confirmed the accusation. His
Like hope itself, Rogers charged out from inside the Sanctum, shield raised to strike Thanos. Tony kept struggling. Something was wrong, but he couldn’t quite-
Thanos growled, unable to break free despite his prodigious strength. “Name yourself, sorceress,” he roared. “Who dares interfere?”
Tony nodded, because there was nothing else to do. The wizard frowned, studying him.
?” the billionaire asked, snapping back into his usual intense focus. Steve followed, just a beat behind.
Halfway through trying, Tony threw up from the pain and it became clear to both of them that the correct answer was, in fact, no. Steve placed him carefully back on the ground, bracing him upright when he slumped dangerously forward. Tony would have thanked him for the help except he couldn’t stop his teeth chattering enough to form the words.
“The ship is not in range of our broadcasting capability.”
“Your, you know, brave warrior routine.” Tony waved his hand then leaned forward, the… look back in his eyes. The
And Steve saw the attack play out in his mind, movie-clear, even before Thanos grasped the arrow buried in his thigh, wrenched it free, sent its impossibly sharp edge hurtling towards Tony’s unprotected neck.
The Captain closed his eyes, and endured.
Even now, in the cold light of day, it was physically difficult to be over
A soothing voice among the voices is murmuring reassurances, stroking his brow. Nat. He doesn’t realize he says her name out loud until she responds, asking him about Tony, why he’d mentioned him, what he knew. Tony’s on Titan, he tells her. He has to get there, he says. She wipes his tears away, promises they’ll find a way, but he can hear doubt in the voices. Then, they fall silent. The Captain suggests defensive measures. Steve ignores.
The difference between success and failure proved to be Peter’s second idea, which was to ask Thor for advice about the Reality Stone. The Asgardian king had told them of the Stone’s ability to take on a host, and after consulting with three of Asgard’s finest surviving healers, he had volunteered to do so. His godly ability to withstand the Stone’s power had allowed Strange to successfully channel its magic into the past through the Time Stone and restore the serum back when Steve was still alive, thus granting him time to heal and, through some nonsensical twist of sorcery, bringing Steve back to life in the present. It had taken some time for Steve to wake, but once his revival proved the idea worked, Strange and Thor had immediately left for Wakanda, hoping to do the same with the rest of Earth’s casualties. Unfortunately, they found that without the third factor of the serum’s healing properties, the standard human body could not withstand the procedure.
on his
Watching.
The ice turned to him with love in its eyes, smiled before kissing his forehead - he blossomed at its touch, and Steve awoke, Steve looked, Steve saw.
“It’s never-
Dr Palmer leaned over him. “The transfer can be stressful so I’m going to give you something to help you stay calm. Is that okay, Captain Rogers?” Nice. She was nice, to ask first. He gave a quick nod, and a few seconds later, he felt his fear dissipate.
Cold. He was… cold. Peaceful. Someone was talking. A woman.
“You mean someone saw him hurt you?” Steve was horrified. “Why wouldn’t they do something?”
“Night, Bruce, Natasha,” Tony said. Tiberius gave a quick nod goodbye, already disinterested. The others watched in silence as they left.
Lungs burning, he had to pull back, Tony beneath him; lips flushed, eyes soft. He heard Tony breathe his name, voice rough, but Steve squeezed his eyes shut, helpless to resist as everything changed; as nothing changed.
Upon their return to the Compound, it was agreed that Tony would send a cover message to Stone detailing how he’d left the hospital too soon, collapsed on the way home and was receiving emergency treatment at the Compound. Tony then spent the whole day in bed with Steve, each content just to hold the other close. This time the other man rested while Steve talked, racking his brain for stories from his childhood, both the good and the laughably bad.
Sam was still talking. “How about we head to the lab, have Bruce or Shuri look you over-” No point. No help. Not them. Not…
“I- I can do that.” Friday had already loaded up a restraint pattern that he could modify. Holding his breath, Tony released the nanobots in a careful spray, then watched as they encased Steve’s body in a hard-shelled cocoon, leaving only his face exposed.
That was a surprise. “You’re a Clarke fan?”
all the time? That I’m just some fake trying to, I don’t know, manipulate everybody?”
“Okay,” Tony said, trying not to sound as terrified as he felt, and closed his eyes. By reflex, he squeezed Steve’s hand inside the Gauntlet, and was unaccountably cheered when Steve squeezed back before counting them down.
want your cock in my mouth.”
Yet enduring the cameras was the last hurdle on the schedule before the official launch could begin, and so Tony tried to keep his expression loose and comfortable as T’Challa finished up listing the Wakandan influences on the space network’s design. Again. Over the past year, Tony had seen the King handle constant petty disbelief about the true extent of Wakanda’s technological contributions. Such disrespect should have been a headline-grabbing outrage, but sadly, this was America.
“We decided to give you an epidural to control your pain,” Helen explained. “That means we put medication in your spine that will block the pain signals reaching the brain. You will feel numb everywhere below your arms, but don’t worry, the effect is only temporary, and you should find it much more comfortable to breathe from now on. Can you lift your arms for me?”
his low, desperate groan.
Steve sighed, then pressed his lips to Tony’s hair. “I hate it, but I agree.”
“I want…” Steve trailed off, trying to consider his answer honestly. Tony waited, just out of reach. “I want to be with you.”
Relief flooded Tony, kept him buoyant through the introductions. “Ty, you’ve met Natasha, this is Bruce Banner. Bruce, this is my fiancé, Tiberius Stone.”
Fuck, Steve thinks. Of course. Of course. Thor hasn’t been there yet, the BiFrost can’t reach it. He should have thought of that. Why hadn’t he thought of that? They’d been returned to the last moment before the end of the world, and that meant right now, Tony is…
. He could definitely answer for this. “Tony, it just… At first it just seemed too horrible to be true. I thought Zola was lying to mess with me. Then Nat gave me Bucky’s file, and I saw how Hydra had used him… It seemed to fit, but Tony, without proof, I just couldn’t be sure. And maybe I didn’t want to believe it, but I also didn’t want to hurt you by bringing up the past without good reason. You know you hate it whenever I bring up Howard-”
“Aha, the real reason Captain America went on the run.”
“Wait, New York?” Barton interrupted him, a dangerous edge to his voice. “You’re saying your cult is based in
Wide-eyed, Peter’s words spilled out faster and faster. “Sorry I kinda disappeared there for a minute Mr Stark but I thought I recognized this place so I went to check outside and I was right, this is the hospital where Aunt May works, you remember her, Mr Stark? Of course you do, but anyway she was meant to be off today but when I called she’d actually come in already to help out in case people panicked and there were injuries with the alert and everything so when I called she was upstairs and she’s on her way down to join us, if that’s okay?”
Somehow that hurt worse than annihilation ever could.
Steve can only look at him, there in the firelight.
“Sorry,” Steve said, not at all sorry as his merriment eased into a contented smile. He was lying with his eyes closed, the afternoon sun kissing golden highlights into his hair, and Tony kinda wished he had a camera - uh, camera, picture, wait, yes-
“Hey,” Tony answered.
“Hi,” May echoed, studying his face. Then she backed off, busying herself with an I.V. drip beside the… hospital bed?
Sam said nothing, but Steve could feel the concern in his gaze. He ignored it, instead retrieving his shield, wiping the mud off with his sleeve, wiping his sleeve clean on his pants.
Sleep brought him impossible dreams.
Tony didn’t have time to respond, because next thing, the door had opened and Peter had bounced halfway across the room before checking himself in dismay.
Steve’s gaze was fierce and shy and flawless. “…touch me?”
Steve stepped back and grabbed the billionaire by the shoulders. “You are not facing Thanos alone,” he said desperately, scrutinizing Tony’s face for a sign that his words were getting through. “Not now, not ever.”
Tony stepped back, brown eyes wide. “No, don’t be sorry, I mean…” He exhaled, pulled a face, then pointed to the bed. “Okay, time out. You, sit.”
“Tony,” he mumbled.
“Fuck you,” Steve mumbled.
“I’m warning you, Rogers,” the other man said, a glimmer of threat back in his eyes. “Leave me the fuck alone.”
One last time, he uses the Space Stone, returning to the very place his real life began. Steve steps into the carefully calculated darkness of the warehouse, nanobots obscuring his face to avert recognition, altering his uniform to match. Yet there is no one to see him as he replaces the Tesseract and leaves. There is no one to notice him while he makes his way to Peggy’s office and lays the letter on her desk, thick with details of Bucky’s capture, Hydra’s infiltration of SHIELD, this Steve’s location in the ice.
“You…” Steve bowed his head as the realization hit, then he raised himself on his elbow and stared down at Tony as if he was still the key to saving the universe. “You really think you could?”
Slowly, bitter realization clicked into place, and Tony forced himself to look up. Steve had placed his body between Tony and the relentless images and was now glaring over his head at the largest screen on the wall-
In his arrogance, Thanos had never expected a direct attack here on his home-world, and so they had managed to catch him off-guard, the Gauntlet nowhere to be seen. Once more, Thor had hit him with a chest strike, but this time there was no escape for the Mad Titan. His roars of agonized outrage were now echoing around the small valley in which he’d made his home, but Steve felt a distinct absence of pity for the wounded alien.
“Uh.” Tony blinked, then frowned. “Wait.
“At least we know if I go in first and don’t die, we’ll have a shot,” Tony murmured, then gasped. “Uh, kinda need to breathe here, soldier.”
“Good,” Steve whispered, eyes full, but still he managed to crack a smile. “Because I want all of you, Tony. Disaster or not. I want everything.”
“Quite the opposite, I guess,” Tony said. That was pretty funny, but nobody laughed.
, he realized.
His eyes widened in shock, and he collapsed onto a nearby couch.
They put him somewhere soft, soothing voices in his ear. He could feel arms around him, warmth on either side. Could hear crying. Maybe his. Maybe not.
“Tony,” Steve sighed, content against his mouth.
“Sympathy is free,” Steve told him, then sighed. “It was very hard on him.”
But right now, caught up in the sick thrill, Tony didn’t care.
Tony flinched back, as if struck by a blow, and looked at Steve as he never had before; there was something worse than shock, clearer than disappointment in his eyes. As if Tony was only now seeing the truth of what he was. And everything he wasn’t. Tony shuddered and his gaze slid away, as if repelled by the very sight of him, and Steve’s heart crushed inward with the loss.
“Stark! It is good to hear your voice,” the first speaker bellowed over Bruce, cheerfully oblivious. No one else it could be.
Steve blinked, then waved towards the refrigerator.
But it was still the end of the world.
Steve was staring at him as if he’d never seen him before. “You- you want to…? But I thought you had plans, you know, clean energy, saving the universe?”
Tony smirked, suddenly keen to lighten the mood. “Well duh, I know that
Unable to help it, Tony snorted a laugh into Steve’s neck. “Objection, libel, outrage, bias,” he said, then wriggled to one side so he could watch Steve’s face. Despite Tony’s joking tone, the other man seemed determined to stay upset; Tony planted a gentle kiss on the corner of his mouth, hoping to soften the tension he found there.
“Flattering as the idea is to my ego,” Tony said gently, “no, Steve, I don’t think that would work. But you don’t need to rush to find your answers. The question’s not going anywhere. You have time.”
Tony leaned forward. “Why sign
This time the Space Stone takes him to Morag, where he watches Rhodey put Starlord in the dirt. All things are possible so once they’re out of sight, Steve drags him back to the
“Right doesn’t mean not-stupid,” Steve said, and now it was Tony’s turn to laugh, sounding like life itself here under this strange claustrophobic sky.
, Tony thought.
?” she demanded.
That awful huffing noise emanated from the faceless man again, and Tony suppressed a shudder. Steve was a living picture of fury, raising his shield as if to strike his old nemesis. “You dare laugh?” the super-soldier questioned him, voice lethal.
Rocket glanced up from a nearby console. “Looks like he fixed the moon, too, fancy man.”
Across the weird bowl, Stark’s smile had faded. “Before you start with the yelling, Rogers, my suit is still on patrol, I can see everything Friday sees from right here,” and he tapped at his sunglasses, the lenses faded to clear in the gloomy indoor light. “I just had a thought I couldn’t shake, and since Thor’s off on vacay, I needed Dumbledore’s input.”
Tony thought back to how sick he’d been with his cheeseburger binge right after Afghanistan, and nodded. He sat with Rhodey in their comfortable silence and let his thoughts wander. Accelerated healing always felt peculiar. Waking up with the pain erased, his mind still raw but his body left eerie. Disconnected. Like the way he knew he should eat but wasn’t actually hungry yet; the way he should be a post-apocalyptic mess but felt a hollow calm instead. He could feel a suffocating urgency raging within, but somehow he was sitting beside it, watching. He knew he could dive in, should dive in immediately and let the momentum take him. It was what was going to happen, after all.
Tony, watching from the Sanctum’s rooftop, had leaped into flight before the suit had fully deployed, and managed to catch Wilson three seconds before he smashed into the ground. “Gotcha,” he murmured, swinging the other man to disperse his momentum before releasing him to roll safely along the ground.
“-not improving,” Helen was saying, and Steve saw Dr Palmer was hovering behind her, reading the machines.
Steve shakes his head. “I don’t pretend to understand the intricacies, but our working theory -
“The… the Tesseract,” Steve stammered. “It brought you here?”
Tony nodded, his awareness both yearning for and recoiling from the chaos around his edges. Like a painful tooth his tongue just had to poke.
“It’s just twenty minutes,” Tony said, trying to reassure himself more than anything. “Piece of cake.” He reached into his pocket for the phone. Usually he had Friday on hand to place calls for him, but today he needed the phone.
Right now, the super-soldier was sitting across the room with Rocket, Bruce and Thor, listening to the forced cheer of their conversation without contributing; Tony was sitting with Nat, Barton and Rhodey, doing most of the babbling. Rhodey had his arm slung around the back of Tony’s chair, clearly still stuck on his plan for protection detail. He’d loudly punched a wall after hearing Nebula’s blunt report and had refused to leave Tony’s side since, even following him to the bathroom; admittedly, Tony had been glad for Rhodey’s company last night. Otherwise he’d have gone looking for Steve and probably said something stupid and fucked everything up even worse.
Ty was staring at him, his face a frothing mix of fear and suspicion and outrage. “In case it wasn’t clear,” Tony told him softly. “You can’t control me anymore. Right now, my AI is shredding every scrap of blackmail material you possess. And not just on me, but on
“I’m sorry,” Steve said.
14:47, Thursday 28th June 2018
,” Tony mocked him, the dangerous glint back in his eyes. “Okay, Rogers, then talk.” He pushed his plate away despite having eaten nothing. “Let’s start with how you knew Hydra murdered my parents and you didn’t tell me.”
The previous autumn, at the care home, Steve had finally asked, and she’d agreed. In fact, she’d said she would always have agreed, then scolded him for waiting so long. Her nurse had scavenged an antique frame so Peggy could keep the drawing by her bedside. That had been a good day.
“Christ, Rogers, could you just shut up and let me
“His Shittiness tried to steal your car,” Clint informed them, then shrugged. “I made him dance.” The archer looked the very picture of nonchalance, but when Tony hugged him, he blushed.
, Ty-”
“We found Thanos.”
for a second. He himself had been blindfolded during the ordeal; Ty had ordered Steve’s double not to speak, then bathed the other man in his own cologne to fool Tony’s senses. The tycoon must have also slipped him something heavier than usual, because Tony’s memory had been confused upon waking, fragments jumbled into each other. But he remembered screaming his safeword. He remembered Ty’s eerie silence. And the pain.
Tony squinted at the ceiling, suspicious. “New York was six years ago. But six and a half for us, I guess.”
Nor did he note the continuing absence of Doctor Strange.
When they got to the large, gaudy gates, Tony stopped the car in his usual surveillance blind spot. Steve glanced over, his eyes full of unspoken sympathy.
-” Steve could have happily stayed there in Tony’s arms forever, but he sat up, struggling to make sense of the other man’s stammering words.
“Hnghhh
Still afire with that glorious impatience, Steve soon took over fucking his mouth, hands carefully gripping the back of Tony’s head, demanding just the right angle, the right speed. And as ever, inspiring heroics on Tony’s part; years without practice had left him a little rusty but he opened his throat and tried to keep up, taking as much of Steve as he could. The barrage of relentless sensation was overwhelming, exhilarating; Tony was on the ground but he was soaring; it felt like the best parts of flying, of fighting, falling without fear of crashing, and the giddying thought came that he could be happy living the rest of his life in devotion to this, only this; the thought made him hum happily around Steve’s length.
Oh, sure, on Friday he’d gone along readily enough with the team’s schedule, following commands without a fuss, otherwise ignoring Steve’s entire existence but in a polite sort of way. He’d left early to continue his lobbying on Asgard’s behalf, promising a punctual return.
Thanos was shaking his head. “Too many… people. Finite resources. Collapse… inevitable, unless someone… Someone had to…” He broke off, coughing, and Steve tried to get a grip on his own anger.
have to do-”
Steve tapped his freshly shaved chin in response. “Strategic recon.” His smug grin grew wider. “Turns out it’s considered standard bathroom issue here.”
speeding safely away, but then the super-soldier pulled him into his side, held him tight, and Tony thought that maybe this would be better, either way.
,” he whispered, “was the hottest fucking blowjob in the entire history of the universe.” Steve gave him a proud sloppy grin in response.
a quick learner,” Ty drawled; an avalanche of humiliation slammed into Tony, memories of long hours spent in front of the mirror, Ty endlessly scrutinizing his every expression, correcting his face, his words, his gestures.
The shame would have sent him reeling, but Steve pulled him close; Tony was unable to resist burying his face against the other man’s comforting bulk, all the while wishing he could fly away, or disappear.
Relief was a sunburst.
The confirmation dislodged something within Tony, his rage now a steady inferno, snatching the opportunity to burst free. “Funny you should say that,” he snarled. “I seem to recall plenty of suffering when you were sobbing that I broke your heart.”
of such cruelty, searching his face desperately for a sign, for hope, for doubt. Anything.
No, it was the finality that hurt the most. The fact that their paths, so long intertwined, had finally, hopelessly, diverged.
There was a flash of orange light, and just like that, they were gone.
“Oh, you want to
It’s difficult to go back, even now, but Steve Rogers has one last mission to finish and therefore he goes.
And then Tony leaned down and kissed him, soft and sweet.
. Every day had ended the same, with Steve bored and unsatisfied, trudging back to the empty apartment his mother had worked so hard to keep. A small angry part of him still wishing it would burn to the ground. Becoming Captain America hadn’t been just a job or a privilege. It had been a fairytale.
That sad expression belonged on a vertical Steve, so Tony swatted him gently on the nose, much to the other man’s astonishment. “Hey, no moping in the cuddle zone,” Tony scolded. He let his voice turn serious. “We’re okay, Steve. Everything that happened before. It’s… done. I’m over it.”
and testing the technology’s limits. Granted, Rocket had made some digs about how no one in space would ever think to use such primitive technology and that’s why it was so effective, but after Okoye introduced him to the business end of her spear, his apology to the young Queen had sounded adequately sincere. Shuri had just rolled her eyes and told him to have some manners or she’d personally show him where they kept the trash. Steve’s ears had caught the raccoon muttering something snarky about pandas, but the Queen’s rebuke did manage to shut him up. At least for a few days.
More specifically, it was the way they shared a bed now, and that felt… right, but from the glances he was getting here and there, he wasn’t sure it was right. No one had mentioned Pepper where Steve could hear, but he saw Rhodey subtly check Tony’s hand for his engagement ring every morning, as if to be sure he hadn’t removed it. Hadn’t forgotten her. As if Tony could ever forget Pepper. They were the strongest couple Steve knew.
Tony shut his eyes, eerily drained. “You and me both,” he said.
, Steve thought - “-just talk to me?” he asked instead.
“My bad, babe,” Tony answered. “Medical discharged me late, everyone else had left for Norway already but I figured I’d come pick you up first.”
Steve knew just what to do. He held out his free left hand, waited. Tony reached out with his right hand, and they linked fingers. Serene within their circle, Steve bent down until his forehead pressed against Tony’s and closed his eyes. They took a breath together, then a second.
“Thanks,” Tony said. “And, you know. For saving my life.” On Titan and after, any hint of sentiment had earned him a warning look or worse from the android, but she accepted his words now with a nod.
, Rogers,” Tony gasped, shoving him away so hard that Steve sprawled out on his ass. The other man made it a few more steps alone, but by the time he reached the stairs he had to sit, collapsing with a graceless crash. Tony buried his face in his hands and cried, visibly shaking. Each sob wracked his whole body, the painful spasms visible even through his armor.
The other man sat heavily. “Sure. I mean, technically I’m not allowed to leave yet anyway, so…” He shrugged, as if unaware of how
“She wouldn’t tell me,” Tony said, shaky with aftermath. Steve looked down; their hands were still entwined. That seemed important.
Schmidt shot a glance at her, and huffed another painful laugh. “Sorrow’s child, be at ease.” He hesitated, turned towards Steve. “I think you will appreciate my lesson, Captain Rogers, more than most. In my former life I sought the Tesseract believing its power would make me strong, but my desire proved only my weakness. In truth I was seeking protection from my own fear, indulging in my own greed for control, rejecting the humanity of all who stood in my way. I can never atone for the evil I unleashed upon those innocent souls. The hideous bargain I tried to make; their lives for my comfort. I thought that is why the Stone brought me here. I thought that was my penance. To watch so many others make the choice I so easily made, but also to experience the cruelty that is betrayal, to witness the cost of sacrifice when made upon a loving heart. Even the Mad Titan cried, Captain Rogers.”
Nothing left but ashes in the wind.
“I think I want to,” Steve said anyway. “If you don’t mind?”
- when he looks up to see Rogers joining them at last.
Tony was cursing at him now, scared fingers pressing down on the wound on Steve’s shoulder, and Steve wanted to tell him that it was fine, that if half a century of ice couldn’t do the job then a simple arrow wouldn’t kill him. Instead he watched quietly as Tony took care of him, as both the blood and the swearing slowed to a trickle and stopped.
“It’s not rocket science, Cap,” the other man said lightly. “Although if it was, you’d be in luck, cos I’m excellent at that too.” He paused, then asked. “Do you want to touch me?”
After, Pepper kissed his forehead and told him she was proud of him; they sat together, then, enjoying an unfamiliar but comfortable silence, until Shuri returned and gave Tony the all clear to leave the lab. The Princess also offered him a replenished nanobots reservoir before she left, but he opted out. Not that. Not yet. Bickering pleasantly, Pepper helped him dress, the only option some soft loose Wakandan clothes that at least had a pleasing lack of itchy seams. Last time, the delay in getting back to Earth had left him with a lattice of angry tissue permanently etched into his side. This time, the wound had healed to a spooky degree, with only a faint scar marking the spot.
Almost, he opened his mouth to tell Steve right away, but then he closed it again.
Natasha leaned against the door and folded her arms, halfway to a fighting stance. “It’s not you I’m worried about.”
,” Tony choked out, leaping to his feet as if to flee the room. But instead he turned his back to the window, wrapping his arms around himself as if he couldn’t stand upright alone.
Steve slowly approached the groaning man, now bleeding heavily from his broken nose. “Hi,” he said softly, then reached down and grabbed Ty by his injured arm, hauling the tycoon effortlessly to his feet.
By the time Rhodey pulled him aside and asked if he was okay, it took everything left in Tony not to scream. That made it seven since breakfast alone; seven individual people stopping to check up on him, as if they all didn’t have something better to do, more important, more useful. But once more he swallowed his frustration, nodded, smiled. He even summoned up a joke and a wink, enough to send his best friend away comforted.
Of course, he’d been the one to save them all, had instantly seen the threat, alone on the battlefield, and made the unthinkable choice. Accepted the cost. Bruce had figured it out afterward from the energy readings, had explained this final gift he’d given them, one last solution to a problem nobody else had foreseen.
Steve looked away at the sunset again. “Did you ever want to? Call, I mean.”
There was an exasperated familiarity in her voice that Tony envied. Peter was lucky to have someone who knew him that well. Who would love him anyway. He glanced down to his hand, noting the neatly placed needle, then squinted up at the I.V. stand beside his bed. The label font was too small to read unaided; he tapped his chest but Friday must have started the nanites recharging while he was out. “What’s in the bag?” Tony asked, trying not to sound suspicious.
“I’m going to live forever,” he blurted out. Tony blinked, looking so confused that Steve hacked out a laugh, an awful cheerless sound. “Shuri said. The serum changed me, Tony. It wasn’t the ice. I can’t age. So I won’t die.” Broken. Wrong.
Spider-Man nodded, also breathing heavily. “Uh, so Mr Stark? Were either of those the guy?”
Preoccupied with guilt, it was only after she’d left and he was walking along a random corridor alone that he realized he had no clue where Steve might be. He nearly asked FRIDAY for the super-soldier’s location, but then remembered she hadn’t been installed here yet. Everything in the Wakandan palace looked the same, and yet it felt nothing like the place he had known. Tony spotted some familiar faces who stared at him without recognition, counted many unfamiliar faces; his ears caught snatches of cheerful, ordinary, wonderful conversations as he passed. Wandering these halls was like walking through a dreamworld, and the weirdness soon began to stretch him thin.
