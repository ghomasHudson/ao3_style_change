Peter chewed his lip, impatiently flipping his pencil around his thumb. It had been over three hours since Uncle James had knocked on his door out of the blue, telling him that there had been an accident during Papa's space mission and that he and one of the other pilots had been hurt. Peter had seen the bright flash of yellow light out his window earlier, but the angle of his room was such that he couldn't figure out where it had come from until Uncle James explained that it had been launched from somewhere in Meridia, and had targeted the second of the three space-faring aircraft as they returned through the atmospheric barrier.
"Our?" Thanos said, looking up towards the sky in surprise just in time to watch Dad slam several stories of a destroyed building right on top of him.
"Well…" Tony slowly walked around the hologram, muttering to himself as he took it in. The particle was definitely complex, but didn't appear to be any more so than the calculations for building his miniature arc reactor inside the Afghanistan cave had been.
And yet, even in his terror, even as he struggled against what had to be absolutely excruciating pain in his attempt to keep himself whole, his last words were meant for his daddy, to help comfort him.
"We just need to," he finished.
"I know it has," said Grandma. "And it's okay to be sad about it too. It used to make your papa pretty sad to have to watch all of his friends play stickball and hopscotch when he was too sick to participate."
"Yeah, that kid's had something like that coming for a long time. He's been a thorn in Pete's side ever since they were in kindergarten, and for some reason he's not all that scared of me," Tony said with a scowl. "When they were in fourth grade he even swiped one of Pete's inhalers once after their gym class, and then two days later Pete wound up in the hospital with pneumonia."
"I'll be there soon, little guy, just gonna talk to Dad a bit first," Steve said with a nod. "Don't start without me."
"Eh, I let Pete do most of the work. He's always been pretty enthralled with that metal arm."
"It's probably them, Pete," he finally said, ignoring the stab of fear piercing his side. "Actually, not even probably."
“You know what this probably means,” Natasha says as she takes a sip of her tea.
Tony said on a gasp as Steve dipped his head to capture his lips. Steve let out a soft moan as his tongue found Tony's, not realising until that very second just how badly he needed him.
"Oh God," he gasped, shivering as he broke out into a cold sweat. He reached blindly for Tony's pillow, hugging it to his chest and burying his nose in it, allowing the comforting scent of his husband to wash over him, driving away the madness. He could still feel the excruciating pain in his broken bones, still see Peter's face as he sneered at him, his beautiful brown eyes completely blank, not knowing who Steve was, who
"Yeah, I'd say the chance of being shot at from orbiting super-helicarriers wouldn't be something that I'd enjoy very much." Tony bit his lip, he was going to have to tread carefully here. "But, Steve… even though we managed to stop Project Insight, and Obie and Killian, HYDRA has still managed to control us through our own fear since then, don't you think?"
"Huh?" Steve said, hissing as Tony cupped his cheeks with his calloused hands, inspecting the skin of his face and neck.
He was just gathering up all of his papers and discarded coffee cups when JARVIS spoke up again.
"Too late, kid," Uncle James said with a smirk. "Now, what do you feel like having for dinner?"
“Uh huh,” Peter says as he tosses the useless pair of goggles into the trash can next to his bed.  Then he picks up his bag and slings it over his shoulder, remembering at the last minute to grab a towel from the bathroom.
"Dad…"
irks me to admit," the colonel continued. "The fact that this new class is being taught by a civilian liaison instead of one of our own should have absolutely no bearing on you or any of your squadmates' behaviour during such class, is that understood? I don't wanna hear so much as even a hint of a whisper of insubordination, you got that? You can think what you want about civilians all you want, just don't you dare let any of those thoughts be loud enough to be heard. Is that clear?"
Steve tipped his head back against the pillows, breathing in slowly as he chewed. "Tony, that's… this is… well, it's just brilliant! And you said that Peter came up with this?"
"I'm fine, JARVIS," he finally said. "I just—I just—"
"Aren't those the things that Tarzan swings on?" Sam asked, confused.
"But it is fucking necessary!" Tony yelled, his heart lurching when Steve jumped back. He knew better than to yell at Steve, or at Peter, for that matter, and yet had been doing so far too often lately. His face fell as he reached for Steve's arm, relieved when Steve didn't try and pull away. "Honey, I'm sorry. You know—you know I'm not upset at you. I'm just—I need to get on top of all of this shit that's been going on lately, and you know I don't believe in coincidences, so—"
Peter's lips twitched. He was going to have to tread carefully.
Instinctively, Peter stepped back, his hand covering the front pocket where his phone sat. "Um… why?"
Which to Papa, would probably be even worse.
"Master Peter is currently sleeping peacefully, Captain," JARVIS answered, his calm voice such a sharp contrast to Steve's roiling emotions that Steve nearly burst into tears. "Would you like me to wake him?"
"Shit. I really have corrupted you," Tony breathed as he wrapped his legs around Steve's slender waist.
level, Grandpa had always emphasised.
And even then, even if they did manage to get through the rather thin atmosphere, what next? The Q-ship Tony and Peter had arrived in was as state-of-the-art as Tony had ever imagined a spaceship could be, and even it had taken several hours to get to Titan from Earth. Which meant that unless Quill's ship had a warp drive, or whatever happened to pass for one where he came from, the journey could very well take weeks to complete.
"Mmm." Tony tipped his head back, thudding it against Peter's headboard. "Go to sleep, hon, yeah? I'll be fine."
my mom said that instead of us going out to Hawaii next summer to visit my grandparents, you know, like we always do, we're gonna pay for them to fly here," Ned said, groaning in frustration. "Apparently my grandma really wants to see New York City for some reason."
He was just on the verge of sleep again when a sudden piercing noise blared through the otherwise silent room. Tony startled, bolting upright on the bed before he even realised what he was doing.
"No one's gonna get you, Pete," Tony said firmly. "I
“Shh, honey,” Dad murmured, stroking Papa’s hair.  “Steve, we can’t change what happened.  None of us can change what’s happened.  What we can do is take the edge off the pain that those memories are causing you.  You’ll still be here with us.”
"Yeah, yeah, I know it," Phillips said, waving a dismissive hand. "You've probably already heard this story, but before Rogers got that serum of his, he was just as bad off as your boy. Kid was so sick that he could barely sit up anymore, all wheezing and hacking and coughing up blood. His skin was as pasty as freshly fallen snow, and his lips were as blue as the clear morning sky. By the time Sarah and I brought him here to the base for the procedure, I had to practically carry him into the room."
"Actually, Quill is just fine," said Gamora as she stepped up next to Quill.
Howard simply couldn't accept the fact that Tony had surpassed his level of intelligence, and since Howard knew he couldn't collect Tony like he'd collected so many other brilliant scientists, he simply chose to ignore him instead.
Fidgeting again in his chair, Steve tipped his head to the side, caressing the back of Tony's hand with his thumb. Tony's skin, which had been very dry and crepey when he first returned, was finally starting to regain its usual softer, supple feel, which hopefully meant that his severe dehydration was starting to correct.
"Dad?" Peter asked. "Um… are you okay?"
"Steve," Tony said, or more like whined when Steve's warm hands slid even further down to his waist, spending what seemed like hours teasing the skin just above his ass. Tony made an impatient noise in his throat, glancing back at Steve just in time to see the grin stretch across his full lips, his face flushed and his blue eyes nearly blown black.
"Dad?" Peter asked when Tony didn't respond. "Please?"
Tony's trembling hand raked through his hair as he pinched himself hard on his side, making sure that he wasn't still dreaming or something.
"Don't!" Steve yelped. He winced, holding up his hand in apology. "Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to snap at you. I'm just—I'm just—"
"As a purely defensive measure," Tony said firmly. "And one that was very effective, I might add."
And then, before anyone could move or even react, Thanos opened up one of his portals and disappeared in a cloud of billowing dust, leaving the eight of them stranded on Titan.
And how disappointed he is now that it’s gone.
If he were truly brave, he would’ve said, “No.  My needs are important too.”
Tony knew he never would, though.  He was way too much of a coward.
"Very good, my dear. One of your best yet, I believe," a vaguely familiar voice said from somewhere behind Steve. His Captain's instinct tried to tell him that he should turn around and investigate the source of the voice, but he was too frozen with grief to even move.
"Oh, you know," Steve said as he reached for Peter's hand. "He's so strong, Nat. So much stronger than he should have to be. And this—"
Which was very likely the reason why Barnes had asked Steve to ask him to look at Barnes' arm, rather than asking Tony himself. Tony knew Barnes still thought that he had to walk on eggshells around him, and if he was being truly honest, he really didn't know how he felt about it. On the one hand, according to Steve, Barnes didn't hesitate to dive right into a huge vat of fire to rescue Peter at the end of the bunker battle, and Tony knew Steve would never lie to him about something like that.
"Peter?" Liz interrupted, one hand on her hip as she eyed him pointedly. "You might wanna pay attention here?"
Peter tipped his head back against the seat, trying to keep his tears contained. He could feel his papa's worried blue eyes practically boring a hole through his skull via the rearview mirror, but he really didn't want to get into it right there in the truck.
"Uh huh." Peter watched as she got into her dad's car, breathing in deeply. He couldn't remember the last time he had been so afraid of an upcoming conversation.
"Pardon me, Captain, sir," JARVIS cut in. "But Sergeant Barnes wishes to report that all is currently well at the theatre. Master Peter and Miss Stacy are holding hands and she is leaning against his arm, but they are otherwise enjoying the movie."
Image Papa cried.
"And we got to know each other. He wasn't impressed at all that I was a pilot. He almost seemed repulsed by it, actually, so—"
"Okay, but… what about?" Peter asked with a frown. "'Cause it looks like you're about ready to pee your pants or something."
And Peter had long since suspected that Obie was padding the books somehow too.  Even if he’d never found any concrete evidence to back his suspicions.
A huge thank-you to my awesome betas, allthesinnersandthesaints and jehbeeh 💖
Peter thought. Then he picked up the datapad and resumed his coding.
"Yeah, I know," said Bucky. "Just not by us."
"No!" Scott exclaimed, scrubbing a shaking palm down his face, which was covered in a thick five o'clock shadow. "Ah, I mean, no, thank you, Agent—Agent Romanoff. I've probably drank enough coffee in the last three days to fill the Pacific Ocean, so—"
"Well, that's pretty easy," said Tony. "I was asked."
"Ah, yeah, he was a pretty brave fellow," said Papa. "Always putting his men first and never afraid to stand up to Washington when he thought they were wrong. I wasn't too involved with the Naval side of things during the war, but even our relatively small Army unit got the occasional word of what he was up to."

"Stay behind me," he whispered as he peered through the peephole, drawing back in surprise when he saw his SHIELD colleague Hank Pym standing between two burly Langaran Safety Officers. Howard sucked in a deep breath, attempting to school his features into his normal look of disdain undercut with just enough curiosity to not be noticeable that he wore whenever he had to deal with Pym and one of his many tantrums, outbursts that had grown even worse since the death of his wife.
Apparently nature was trying to force Steve into a rest day from running, since his alarm was due to go off in less than three hours.
"All right, Tony, we're almost there," Bruce said from the U-shaped command set-up, elbowing Thor in the side when he tried to peer at the monitors. Next to Thor stood Natasha, furiously taking notes on a notepad while Clint read over her shoulder, his left hand clutching Pietro's elbow.
"But I still don't want you exhausting yourself with all of this, okay? You want to still work in it, fine, just don't overdo it. You need to save up as much of your strength as you can."
A challenge that Steve had readily accepted.  His ongoing mission during the war had always been to rid the world of HYDRA, and now, seventy years later, he and his team were more than ready to see it through.  He, with Tony’s help, had already commandeered all of the intelligence from his former bunker prison, including a complete copy of HYDRA’s New Order Manifesto that had been left behind by none other than Arnim Zola himself.
He also deserved a helluva lot more than to live beneath the shadow of a father whose common tabloid nickname was the Merchant of Death.  But just like Tony had had no control over his future while growing up under the shadow of his own father, it wasn’t Peter’s responsibility to set himself on the right path going forward.
Pepper’s brow furrowed as they reached the ornate wooden door to Tony’s office.  “That's actually what I’m trying to tell you, Mr Stark,” she said.  “Mr Stane is waiting for you in your office.”
"Oh. Okay," Peter said with wide eyes as he picked up his pencil. Being the only child of two only children, Peter really had no experience with sibling dynamics. Even Ned was an only child.
"I am going to assume that question was rhetorical, sir," JARVIS said after a short pause.
Dad rolled his eyes. "Well, thank God for that. So why don't we all take our positions, yeah?"
"All right. Should we tell him that, just in case he's wondering?" Steve asked, chuckling.
“Good.  I think I’ll do the same,” said Tony.  Hooking his many coffee cups onto his fingers, Tony quickly dropped them off in the kitchen and raced to his bedroom.  He pointedly avoided the mirror as he peeled off his smelly, coffee-stained t-shirt and pants and headed directly for the shower, his heart thumping in the way it always did whenever he was hyped up on too much caffeine.  He let out a loud, almost salacious groan as the hot water began pelting down onto his sore muscles, fighting against the strong urge to lean back against the wall and close his eyes for a stretch.
Which was more than he could say for Steve at the moment. During their last conversation earlier that day, Steve had already been shivering so badly that he'd barely been able to speak over the chattering of his teeth. Tony had ordered him to try and rest, to conserve both his energy and his oxygen, and Steve had told him that he would try, but Tony didn't honestly expect him to be able to do so.
Steve cuts her off with a raised hand.  “Nat, please.  I know you’re trying, but… I’m just not ready.”
"Oh, great. That's great," Scott said. "'Cause I just remembered that I probably should give Cassie a call and let her know that I got here, and—"
As soon as Beck was gone Tony slumped back down into his chair, loosening his tie and pressing his palm to his chest, where Steve's dog tags hung beneath his dress shirt. He was going to have to tell Steve about this, but he would have to time it carefully. Steve's three-steps-forward-two-steps-back progress was too tenuous for Tony to want to upset it.
Phillips had informed Steve's team during their patrol briefing the day before that once it was determined that each of them had demonstrated the appropriate proficiency with the normal flight operations of the X-302s, they would then begin special simulator programs to prepare for a possible extra-atmospheric launch, which was apparently fancy science-code speak for space travel.
Steve sighed, his gaze firmly on the full platter of eggs and bacon in front of him. "I'm fine, guys, really. No need to worry."
Pulling back on the handle, Bucky stepped back, allowing Steve to reach inside the tank and grab onto the collar of one of the soldiers, yanking him out and launching him twenty metres away, where he landed with a rather sickening
"I've placed you there next to George, Peter," she said.
As soon as the door closed behind him, the scene began to break apart again, this time turning into a room with a bunch of folding chairs all situated in a circle.  Most of them were occupied with people, including Uncle Bucky—whose hair had grown so long it was hanging in front of his eyes, making him look almost spooky.  They were all listening intently as Uncle Sam spoke from his chair near the front, telling them some kind of story about luggage.  Peter looked around the circle, searching for Papa, his shoulders sagging as he finally noticed him standing in the back of the room leaning against the doorway.  He was bouncing on the balls of his feet, his arms crossed tightly in front of him and his lips stretched into a thin line.  Peter had seen him stand like that a bunch of times before, usually when he was struggling to keep himself together.
"Okay, and how quickly do you estimate we could be ready for launch?"
"That's my boy," Steve said proudly. "That does still mean that you need to stay out of our room until Dad's feeling better though, okay? We can't risk you getting whatever he's got."
Tony dropped to his knees next to the cot, trying to ignore the way the cat was glaring bullets at him.  “Steve, honey, I am so sorry!  I messed up and I messed up bad.  I didn't—I never should’ve—that was so shitty of me, and I’m—look, Steve, Pete and I, we’ve been worried sick about you all weekend, so if you could—if you don't mind, um… I’m gonna just touch you on your shoulder here, okay?”
Peter gave a quick nod, clearing his throat. "Yeah, I've—I've heard that before."
“Will do.  I’ll see you soon.  I love you.”
Uncle James gave a nod. "Exactly."
"Hey, babe," Tony said, his expression an odd mixture of grimness and satisfaction. Steve planted a quick kiss on his cheek, then glanced at Bruce's monitor, which was covered in lines and lines of Russian text that Natasha was busy translating.
“Pretty sure you’d think just about anything would look good on Papa, Dad,” Peter said.
Steve was so completely awestruck by his beloved that he barely noticed when Colonel Phillips appeared at the front, shooting Peter an affectionate wink. Not even three seconds later Bucky stepped forward, taking his place off of Peter's left-hand side as James stepped up next to Peter's right.
“Yeah!” says Clint.  “‘Cause I’m convinced we’re spending more on duct tape to fix the goddamn targets than it would cost to replace ‘em!”
"Yes sir, but I'm afraid Mr Hammer has just recalled several of the suits back inside the structure," said JARVIS. "It appears that he underestimated the ease with which you were able to take them out."
"Impeccable," finished Tony. "You're right, it would. We'd have to time it down to the very last millisecond. But we can do it." Tony paused, taking hold of Steve's elbows. "Honey, we're the Avengers, and you have trained us very, very well. We can
"Then we storm the prison," Tony finished.
"I told you you would die for that," Thor said, low and tight as he pushed the blade of his axe even further into Thanos' chest. Thanos let out a harsh cry of pain, one so terrible that Steve shivered.
"Copy that!" Natasha said as she and Wanda took off running towards the huge machine, followed by General Okoye. Ducking underneath a leaping war dog, Steve's heart fluttered as Wanda suddenly levitated into the air, bright red peals of light emanating from her hands.
Tony hesitated, unsure as to just how much he should divulge at the moment. As a matter of fact, he did have several theories as to what HYDRA might have been working on, with each one being even scarier than the last.
So far, based on what Peter had already found, HYDRA had apparently been trying to use the CTX-616 to convert ordinary people into a controlled, enhanced army, a process that coincided with the arrival of Aldrich Killian. Killian had taken the drug and altered it into the form that had given him his super strength and pyrokinetic abilities, but didn't affect his memory like the CTX-616.
classify these devices as anything resembling a ‘toy’,” Tony said, low and tight.  “These printers are manufacturing medications that are vital to the well-being of the people the Stark Relief Foundation is trying to—”
"Then let's kick his ass!" Dad stated, his armoured fist slamming against whatever shield Papa was carrying, the ear-splitting sound reverberating throughout the massive prison.
"Oh boy," Peter muttered as he was suddenly yanked off his feet. He shimmied up the web rope, the suit diving and swerving like a wild bronco trying to buck off its rider as Peter climbed up onto its back.
"I don't know, Sam," Papa snapped, his jaw tight enough to cut glass. Papa did
It had been a particularly bad spring for allergy and asthma sufferers that year, and Steve had been having even more trouble breathing than usual for most of it, blowing through his expensive nebuliser treatments and rescue inhalers in a frantic attempt to keep himself from having to be admitted to the hospital. Ma had had an especially rough few days as well, pulling three double shifts in a row as she tried to get ahead on some of their neverending bills, so Steve had tried to hide his growing distress, keeping himself shut up in his room most of the time so as to not worry her. It wasn't until a few hours after he had completely run out of his medicine that he realised he was literally gasping for air, barely able to drag his weak, skinny body from his room to the kitchen before collapsing against the very same table where Ma was trying to balance their books.
he begged, finally getting the suit to shift just enough to avoid crashing into the wall before guiding it to a semi-smooth landing on the concrete floor.
“Okay, buddy, okay.  I get it.  I’m going.”  Pushing himself up to his feet, Tony adjusted the pillows under Peter’s injured hand and patted him on the shoulder.  “I’ll be in the lab.  You let me know if you need anything else, yeah?”
"Mmm, I think you're right," Steve said. He let out a soft moan as Tony's lips found that sweet spot of his right below his jaw, his eyes fluttering closed at the sharp bolt of sensation that shot through his body.
“I want to keep going, Tony,” Papa said again.  “I can do this.”
"Yeah she is," Peter said rapidly. "I mean… yeah, she is. She… um… invited me to her house for dinner tomorrow, but—"
"Yeah, I know that. But you also know that I'm gonna worry about you anyway," Steve said, rather petulantly. "I just can't help it. Not after—"
And Tony shuddered to think how in the hell Steve would've been able to adjust to the twenty-first century without Peter's help. Everything from learning how to use a microwave to shopping for groceries and clothes to using a smartphone and driving a modern car, in those earliest days it had been Peter who Steve had leaned on the most. One of the fondest memories Tony still had of his two boys was that first night that Steve made dinner for the three of them at the Malibu house, and both he and Peter regaled Tony with stories about their afternoon adventures in the pool as they all ate together.
"Whatever it takes, babe," he said. "We've all got your back."
And it was even one of Peter's favourite colours, Spider-Man red.
"Um… did we just lose?" Quill asked, his right arm tight around Gamora's shoulders.
"Well, then maybe he won't come here after all," said Quill. "Asshole's only interested in finding the stones."
"Damn," Tony murmured once he finally released him. "It's too bad that we have plans, 'cause you are looking especially hot at the moment."
The only thing missing was the medallion he'd been wearing around his neck, the medallion he had revealed had contained the Time Stone.
Tony let out a groan, scrubbing his palm down his face.  “Yeah, J, I know.  But you heard me right.”
And that's when things
"Yes, I promise." Then she gathered up her school bag and opened the car door, their hands slowly sliding apart as she stepped out onto the sidewalk. "I'll see ya soon."
In fact, he'd had to remind Steve a few times that even though he was a bit smaller than him and didn't have super-soldier serum coursing through his veins, he wasn't made out of glass either.
Steve just desperately wished that he could erase the image of Tony's out-of-control suit crashing into the stone wall of that Miami bunker from his mind. It was that image, accompanied by the horrible sound of metal slamming against stone at forty kilometres an hour that constantly haunted Steve's dreams and had terrified him during their recent missions.
"No. Never," said Steve. "So… you really think it's true, then? Pym is a scientist. Maybe he had some kind of shrinking tech or something?"
"And you'd probably be much worse than you are now," insisted Steve. "Which is even more reason to rest, don't you think? It's much easier to fight off germs when you let your body rest."
"Well, I should hope not," Tony retorted. "Otherwise all those fancy words you said at our wedding were just that. Words." He jerked his head towards the food, his beautiful brown eyes twinkling in the soft light of the hologram. "But you've always been a man of both words and action, so I guess I have no choice but to believe you."
Steve's lips twitched. He personally hadn't enough encounters with regular civilians to formulate an opinion of them one way or another, but he knew the same couldn't be said for some of his predecessors, or even his teammates. The pilots in the Langaran Air Corps were rather proud, as were pretty much all the members of the Langaran military, and with that pride came the tendency to look down upon some of the non-military members of society.
"Since Sam went to all the trouble of arranging it, then yes, I'm afraid so," answered Steve. "Hopefully it'll be quick, so we can get to Ma's a bit earlier. When I called her after my shower she told me that Peter's been pretty tired today."
"I don't know, but we don't have time to find out," Tony said through his rising panic. He powered up his right repulsor, aiming it directly at the crack that was already starting to fill in. "JARVIS, give me forty-eight percent power and find me the weakest spot on that crack right now!"
Something needed to change, and the sooner the better. Unfortunately, aside from the new security measures he was enacting, Tony had no idea where or how.
Peter shrugged.  “Yeah.  Something like that.”
I’m always eager to hear what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  😊
😭 = I got you right in the feels
"And then what?" Dr Strange asked Thanos as he got to his feet. "After the snap?"
that it's an involuntary response, buddy," said Tony. "Like breathing."
"Nowhere," Peter said as he gave his head a hard shake. It didn't do to dwell on things he couldn't change, right? Wasn't that what Papa was always telling him?
"No," Steve interrupted. He cupped Tony's face in his hands, his blue eyes boring into Tony's like lasers. "Don't you even say it, sweetheart, 'cause it's not true."
"He owed it to your papa?" Tony asked. "Why? 'Cause he was killed?"
"Um, the San Francisco 49ers?" Peter had gone over the Super Bowl teams with Uncle James and Uncle Sam on the flight out to Italy, so they were mostly fresh in his mind.
Papa's throat bobbed as he swallowed, cupping Peter's cheek in his hand. "You're right, little guy. You're absolutely right that people need to fight back against discrimination like this. But Peter, this is HYDRA, and you're just a child, you have your whole life ahead of you, and—"
"Well, I'd mourn if I lost my AirPods, so I guess I can understand that," said Ned. "So then if Nidavellir is a real place, do you think Atlantis is real too?"
"Captain Rogers will be exiting the atmosphere in exactly five seconds, sir," JARVIS said. "Four… three… two… one… enter. Reacquisition of radio signal will occur in approximately forty-five seconds."
Flushed and panting, Steve's eyes narrowed at the plastic disc clutched in his hand as Tony turned in his arms to see Clint about ten metres up the beach, nearly doubled-over with laughter.
"You most certainly are not!" Steve retorted. "JARVIS, can you tell me Tony's body temperature, please? And his heart and respiratory rates?"
After exchanging pleasantries with the newsstand owner, Steve and Sam headed out onto the street, bustling with its usual New York City foot traffic. Several people recognised Steve as they passed, which likely meant that his photograph would wind up being printed in at least one of the magazines that he always saw displayed in the grocery store checkout lanes. Again.
"Honey, no one besides you, me, and a select few others know how smart Pete is, so—"
"This must've been what happened when he was taken out of stasis and given a new mission," Steve said, his Captain's voice wavering ever-so-slightly. He wrapped an arm around Peter's shoulders, tucking him close. "Sam, keep going, we're almost there!"
He had imagined the whole damn thing.
child!" yelled Dad. He huffed out a sharp breath as he took hold of Peter's shoulders with shaking hands. "You're
Pulling out the handlamp, Howard flicked it on, shining the bright beam of yellow light directly towards the door of his office just as Maria appeared in the doorway, letting out a surprised gasp as she threw her hand up to cover her eyes.
"Good," answered Steve, and Tony could hear his smile in his voice. "I like using it."
"Oh," murmured Peter. "Thank you. That's really nice of you to say."
"Yes, sir. It was myself and Colonel Rhodes who were sent on the mission."
"Nat and I can be there in about three hours if we drive, which'll probably look the least suspicious," Clint said. "The Quinjet will be faster, and we probably shouldn't all head directly there or someone'll figure it out before we want 'em to."
"Goddamn Obadiah," Tony spat out against Steve's chest. "I should've seen it coming, so why didn't I? There were so many signs! So many signs that I fucking
But he couldn't. As much as he hated to admit it, Tony's plan was the only way he could think of to rid the universe of Thanos for good.
I am really looking forward to hearing what you guys think!  I’ll admit my confidence is a bit shaky, I’m pretty sure I had twice as many kudos on Pieces at this point in the story, so if you’re enjoying this story and haven’t left me a kudos yet, I’d really appreciate it if you did!  And comments are always appreciated.  Questions, theories, I love them all!  I really love discussing my stories, so please, even if it’s just an emoji or keysmash, I’d love to hear what you’re thinking!
"Hey, don't call my dad an asshole," grumbled Peter. "And what aren't you wanting him to suspect?"
It wasn't even the thought of standing up to Obie that scared him.  That wasn't even in Tony’s top ten of the things he feared most.
"It's a common custom for pilots to carry photos of our loved ones in our cockpits while we're flying," he explained. "And since we haven't had a chance to take a real family photograph yet, I decided to draw one instead."
His second and third trips into the tunnel, where he witnessed himself and Peter spending Christmas in the hospital when Peter was six years old, and later answering some very difficult questions from an adolescent Peter about why Tony allowed Obadiah Stane to bully him, hadn't helped at all.
Fury tilted his head, pondering. "I would," he said. "Who're you thinking?"
Peter gave him a nervous smile. "All right, then that's what I'll do."
"That the Toomes girl?" Dad asked.
"Dad, what happened? Did you and Steve have a fight about me or something?"
"Now, now, now, I thought we'd decided we weren't gonna do that anymore!" protested Sam as Tony took off, his wings flying open a second later. "I'm pretty sure you have an unfair advantage there, Iron Man!"
Tony sniffed, giving a barely perceptible nod. "Sometimes I really hate when you're right."
"Yeah, yeah. Let me know the moment you find something, but don't just blurt it out if Steve's around either. The timing's a bit critical, okay?"
Silence fell across the table, punctuated only by the sound of shifting chairs and tapping fingertips.
"Don't know if it's good or not, Tony, but I've at least got a location," Clint replied. "About three klicks away from Jekyll Island off the Georgia coast."
Steve smiled, so widely that his dimple, which had been missing in action ever since before he left, finally reappeared.
There was no way he was going to allow Steve to sit in some HYDRA holding facility until Monday, because he knew without a doubt that there was no way Steve would even still be in that holding facility come Monday.
"As long as it works," Peter reminded him. "But if it doesn't work JARVIS should be able to tell you as soon as you test it out."
, that as my brother and I got older, we would choose the 'proper' person to marry. Well, my brother did. His wife was the daughter of one of my father's colleagues, and his wedding was considered to be one of the most highly sought-after invitations that year. My father ended up inviting over three hundred guests, and all of it was paid for by the Air Corps."
Uncle Bucky shot him a playful frown as he eyed the chessboard. "Well, I guess that's better than being the crazy one."
"Who?" Sam asked. "Bruce, who's coming?"
Not taking his eyes off the thumbnail, Tony gulps down some more coffee and clicks on the video, watching in awe as Steve wins his Olympic Trial race by a full half a second.  As soon as the race is over, Tony clicks on the next video, this one a replay of Steve’s Olympic victory in the 100-metre freestyle.
"Oh? And what gives you that idea?" he asked as he picked up a pencil, twirling it between his fingers.
“Argh!”  Peter dropped his head, burying his face into his squashy comforter so he could let out the scream he’d been holding back.  “Okay, okay, so… if you're saying that we can’t tie Obie to these bullets that way, then…”  He trailed off as his fingers began flying over the keyboard.
"All right." With a nod at T'Challa, Steve, Thor, and Bucky all made their way towards the palace, pausing about ten metres from where the Soul Stone lay buried beneath the ground's surface. As soon as they were in position, he tapped the star in the middle of his chest, his heart quickening as his suit generated something that resembled a radar image, the location displayed as a bright yellow blinking dot.
"At the moment, huh?" Tony said with a grin. He wiggled his ass up against Steve, smirking when a low growl rumbled up from Steve's chest. "Well, just give it a few more and we'll see how you're doing then."
"I am sure that Adrian Toomes was involved in most, if not all of the diverted wreckage," Tony said evenly. "Now, as to where he stood in the chain of command that was involved in diverting the tech in the first place, we still don't know, as Mr Toomes is still refusing to talk. But what I can say is that all current Damage Control personnel have been re-vetted, and that the convoys should be able to proceed on schedule from both the D.C. and New York sites."
And, come hell or high water, he was
Whether the people in charge would actually believe that he had anything to do with it would be another story altogether, especially since no one but a few select people knew of his intelligence, but Peter was trying to not think too much about that part. It's not like the government didn't already know how precarious his condition was. They were the ones who'd allowed him to get so sick in the first place.
Steve breathed in, shaking his head. Phillips had always granted him a bit of leeway since he'd been so close with Steve's father, and Steve knew better than to push too hard against that, but…
"Well… yeah, I have, but not when I'm supposed to be on my way to a mission briefing, doofus!" Tomis insisted. "Dude, sometimes you just gotta suck it up!"
"Tony—"
"Yeah, bud?"
"And I have no doubt that you're right about that," Papa said as they reached the exit doors. "Peter, you'd better zip up your jacket, little guy, it's still pretty brisk outside."
"We need to turn the ship around," Strange shot over his shoulder. "Right now."
"So it should've been a piece of cake," Lang continued. "And as soon as I flew overhead and realised that it wasn't just some old warehouse, I should've turned around right then and there. But I didn't. I thought all you guys lived in the Avengers' Tower full-time, so I thought I could still do it."
"You want me to stay with you?" Bucky asked as Sam, Thor, and Natasha all headed off in the direction of the jet.
“I see,” Steve said with a smile.  “But from the tone of your voice, I’m guessing that you think your strategy is the better one?”
"Well, I think it's just gonna be you and me for the school run this morning, little guy," he said as they stacked their dishes in the dishwasher. "As long as that's okay with you."
"Oh, thank you!" Peter whispered. "Now, if you don't mind—"
This time, there was nothing to bury. No way to say goodbye. No way to find closure.
"Yeah, I'm enhanced, I guess you'd call it," Peter answered. "And so's my papa and some of my uncles, but my papa's been hurt real bad so my dad and the rest of the team needs my help." He huffed out a sharp breath, pressing his forehead against the window. "Can you please just let me out of here? Please? I promise that my dad will be able to help both you and your brother once all this is over, but that's not gonna happen unless I can get out of here."
"I'm guessing so since i've never seen her before," answered Peter. "What'd you say her name was?"
"All your fault," Steve breathed into Tony's neck. He hefted Tony into his arms, carrying him over to the couch in the corner of the lab and settling him on his lap. "This wasn't why I came in here, you know, ach tá tú dodhéanta seasamh in aghaidh."
And yet somehow, O'Brien managed to cause not only all of the remaining high-ranking military officers to fall into line behind him, he also managed to completely transform the country from a civilian-led republic into what essentially amounted to a military dictatorship in only a few short weeks, one that had remained firmly in place for the last twenty-eight years.
And that was all that really mattered.
"Sure thing."
Steve tipped his head back against Tony's shoulder, his eyes fluttering closed. "Yes. To us. So what are we gonna do about it?"
"And then, if you guys can figure it out, we could try and fix things," Steve whispered. "Scott said that since time works differently inside this Quantum Realm, and so if we could figure out how to navigate it, we could then reverse the snap and bring people home."
And now, he didn't know what to do. The Wanda girl seemed to have some kind of manipulative powers over both mind and body, and while Steve had a feeling that she was just as much a prisoner of HYDRA as he was, his first priority had to be freeing Tony.
"Mr Lord," Quill repeated with a chuckle. "Star-Lord is fine, Mr Man."
Now it was Tony’s turn to blush, completing his own stupidly lovesick look.  “Love you too, babe.”
"I do believe that your telephone is currently in your hand, Master Peter," JARVIS answered.
"Yeah, must be a Stark thing," Peter said, holding up his camera. "You mind if I get a few pictures? I already took some of Papa."
"Nah," Gwen said with a shake of her head. She grabbed onto the end of her ponytail, giving it a light tug. "My father's side of the family still lives in the Bronx, and my mom's is in Jersey. We don't see each other that often though. My dad and his brothers don't always get along."
"Will you just hush for a minute?" Tony asked quietly. Steve nodded, barely daring to blink.
Unfortunately, based on his sample size of two—
Tony's throat was tight as Steve backed away, allowing Tony to take his place.
"Wow, Liz's house is nice!" Ned exclaimed from next to Peter, his jaw dropping in awe. "No wonder she likes to have parties!"
"I'm really sorry," Peter added, as if his sentiments would somehow help. "It's not fair that you have to go through all that."
"Huh?" Dad croaked, his eyes flicking rapidly between Peter, Blaster Guy, and Green Lady. "I never said—?"
him slip away again?"
Because, who would've thought?
"Not anymore!" Thanos said as he raised the gauntlet again, the glowing stone jumping briefly from red to purple as he swung his arm, knocking T'Challa out of the way as easily as if he were a piece of paper.
"Nuh uh. Don't you be trying to give me excuses, buddy, I know you too well," Dad cut in. "You keep telling yourself that it's just one more file, but then it'll be just one more, and then just one more, and so on, and so on, and—" He paused, letting out a sort of morbid chuckle. "Can't say that I don't know where you get that particular trait from, but… it's probably not the best thing when it's a school night, don't ya think?"
"I'm gonna take some to Dad now, okay, little guy?" Steve said. Tony had been napping the last time he'd checked on him, when he'd brought in the humidifier and VapoRub, and had woken only a few moments ago. His fever had spiked a bit while he'd been sleeping, but not high enough to worry Steve more than he already was.
"They are indeed, sir."
"You—you look really pretty tonight," Peter whispered to Gwen as Ned's guess of Colonel Mustard in the parlor with the candlestick was quickly shot down by Betty. She was wearing a bright blue sweater that complimented her blonde hair and green eyes beautifully.
"A shower? Jesus, Steve, how hot was the goddamn water? You look like you washed yourself with sandpaper!" Tony's eyes narrowed when Steve didn't answer, and he let out a heavy sigh. "Were you dreaming about the ice again? Is that it?"
And this time, there would be no coming back.
I didn't mean—oh God, I’m so sorry—I didn't mean—!”
"Please, sweetheart," Steve murmured when Tony propped himself up, staring at him with lust-blown eyes still laced with concern. "Please… I don't wanna think right now. I just wanna feel. Please—"
"Not exactly," Tony said quietly. "Look, I'm not saying that I'm suspicious of the guy, I'm just—"
"Tony," Steve said with a frown. "I know you and Howard didn't get along that well, but I doubt that he was disappointed in you."
But Steve had shushed him with a gentle finger against his lips, followed by a soft kiss.  “No,” he’d murmured.  “I know what you're gonna say, and none of it’s true.  You're it for me, sweetheart, and I’m gonna prove it to you.  Whatever it takes.”
And being just a second too late to save Gwen.
"Yeah, I know, but the science still applies, Dad," Peter cut in. "The writers of Star Trek consulted with some of the top scientists from around the world, and they all agreed that you can't make course corrections at warp. It would tear the ship apart."
It didn't help that Sam wasn't there to reassure Steve that things would be fine again someday. For how much Tony liked to joke about Steve's "giddy optimism", for Steve, ever since he'd met Sam it had been him that Steve had turned to whenever he needed to hear some encouraging words. Sam had understood what it was like to be a soldier, and the various struggles that soldiers faced when trying to adapt to the civilian world, and Steve had been missing his blunt but always truthful ways of seeing things terribly lately.
"Y-yes," Steve stammered, clearing his throat. "Yes, thank you, Gwen, I appreciate you telling me this. And I'm very sorry for your own losses as well."
"Yeah, we'll see," muttered Tony, and Steve didn't have the heart to chastise him. Even with O'Brien no longer in charge, the blackouts would have to continue until Steve was able to deploy the tesseract, and he knew there'd be no way Tony would be able to sleep alone in the dark without him.
"I'll get him, Papa!" yelled Peter, taking off towards the second alien, who was flying through the air completely vertical. "That is such a not cool way to fly," he muttered under his breath, veering to dodge a billboard that came careening towards him. "The aerodynamics have to be horrible!"
Once he was showered and dressed, Steve headed back to the kitchen to find Tony helping Peter with the last of his snacks. With Peter's metabolism almost twice that of a normal sixteen-year-old boy, most of the time his daily food intake surpassed even Steve's, and he and Tony had already had to bring him extra food during the day three times since the beginning of the school year.
As it was, there was probably enough Kevlar in the uniform he was currently wearing to almost classify it as armour, but Steve wasn't about to say anything. Aside from the images of the devastating space battle that Tony often saw in his nightmares, Steve knew that the memories of his condition once the team found him in the hidden HYDRA bunker were a very close second. Right up there with Peter as he lay comatose in his hospital bed after the battle down in Miami.
Dad groaned as he got down onto his knees on the floor, holding on to Peter's shoulder for leverage as he searched.
"Ah." Tony smiled as he glanced up at the drawing of the bird and her three chicks that he'd tacked up onto to the corkboard behind his computer. "More birds?"
"Oh God, Pete, I'm so sorry," Tony whispered, his armoured fingertips massaging the back of Peter's neck. "Buddy, I'm sorry. I'm just worried about Papa, and—"
"That's for sure," agreed James. "I know you didn't see him much down in Georgia, but he was damn good during that fight. He'll be the least of our worries."
"Whoa, you actually spent the night together?" Bucky cut in. "That's awesome!"
"No, Papa, I'm not gonna!" Peter stated, cringing as Dad flew back up, hitting the alien repeatedly with his repulsor blasts as Papa jumped forward, trying to take out the alien's hammer with his nanite shield. Peter knew that Papa had to be already off-kilter since his regular shield was probably in its usual spot back at the Tower. He could create a shield with the nanites in his suit, but he couldn't use it to attack since he couldn't throw it at anything.
Just like she wasn't able to save herself from the same fate several years later.
Steve's eyebrows knitted together over his bruised, bloodshot eyes, prompting Tony to squeeze his hand. "Sorry, hon, I shouldn't've said that."
It was literally history in the making.
Tony gave a shrug. "Best I can do on short notice, and it's gonna be rough as hell. We won't be able to see much more than some fuzzy outlines, but it'll at least be better than nothing."
"I don't know," replied Bruce, so forlornly that Tony couldn't help but wince. Stepping through the hologram, he ruffled through his scattered piles of papers, pulling one out that was so creased and bent and covered in coffee stains that it was barely readable. "We're doing everything right, or at least from what I can tell. But we just can't seem to nail down this final variable, which means—"
Only this time, there was no explosion.
The first two files he downloaded turned out to be more supply lists, with his frustration almost boiling over into rage when the third ended up being yet another page of the HYDRA manifesto. Against his better judgement, Peter decided to read it anyway, the knot that had been sitting down in the pit of his stomach ever since he'd gone to bed growing larger and heavier with each passing sentence.
"Okay," said Peter. "So… then what happened?"
"Sounds good." Tony tilted his head up, pressing a lingering kiss to Steve's lips. "'Cause I got some pretty big plans for you tonight, babe."
"You must've been so relieved," Steve said. "You were so exhausted."
But not even three seconds after hearing Peter's voice, sick and weak as it was, Rhodey was practically a new person. His shoulders were more relaxed, the lines around his eyes and across his forehead were fainter, and then, only another second later, Tony even heard him laugh for the first time in weeks.
"Hey!" protested Uncle Bucky. "I thought I was your fun uncle!"
Now, though…
"Oh, holy shit," Tony rasped. "Steve, she just—she just completely locked him inside there, and—"
"Well, we'll be heading out to the field again tomorrow afternoon if you wanna come," said Bucky. "Pretty sure Carol said that she'd be available too. We could have two on two."
Peter shrugged. "Eh, I don't know. Pretty sure none of us have come across any mermen yet, so… who knows? Maybe that's one mythical place that's actually still mythical."
"I said I'm
protested Tony. "I just… have a few years of experience on you, that's all."
But while Tony is rather proud of how he’s managed to pull himself together in the years since he drove out of that circle drive for the last time, he still wouldn't dream to call himself ‘good’.  A label like that can only be assigned to someone who actually deserves it.
"Yeah, I know! Just a sec!" Peter answered as he shoved his trigonometry textbook into his backpack, carefully zipping it closed. Then he patted his back jeans pockets, and his hoodie pockets, and his front backpack pockets, searching for the stupid phone that he couldn't seem to find. Again.
“I love you too, honey,” he murmured.  Then he pressed a soft kiss to Steve’s lips and stepped back, taking his hand.  “What do you say we go change into some more comfortable clothes and then go pick up our kid, yeah?”
And that had been
Bucky shot Steve a questioning look. "Okay, but I thought Tony had a son?"
"It went fine," Steve answered, proceeding to fold an entire piece of bacon into his mouth. "Just did a couple extra laps is all."
"Ah, yeah," said Bruce. "Why wouldn't we?"
“Yeah, let’s hope so,” he says softly.  Then he clears his throat, reassuming his “Captain’s voice”, as Peter likes to call it.  “All right.  As soon as you guys have flushed out the last of the soldiers, then head back to the jet and wait for us.  Do not follow us into the building until I give you the all-clear.  Understood?”
Steve was quiet for a moment, not quite sure how to respond. It didn't surprise Steve in the least that Peter had sensed the ship's presence before he saw it, as his Spider Sense had never let him down before. It didn't even surprise him that Gwen had begged Peter not to go. She loved Peter, of that Steve had no doubt, and would never want him to deliberately place himself in danger.
A repulsor blast suddenly shot past Steve, blowing away part of the wall behind him.
"Then don't," Tony murmured into Steve's ear. He hiked his legs up higher, his knees hooked over Steve's hips. "Come for me, baby. I wanna see you."
"Honey, you didn't have to do that," protested Tony.
"Hey, sweetheart," he said, with only the slightest hint of a wobble. Tony could tell that his teeth were still chattering, which he chose to take as a good sign. "How're you holding up?"
"Then, yeah," he said. "I guess it would. Why?"
"Wakanda is a very technologically advanced country," Steve added. "Which means that they have means of defending themselves that we currently don't."
"That's 'cause he's too damn smart to be impressed by something like that," Tony muttered.
Because if Tony had been in possession of such a suit on
Because no matter what, they were in it—whatever
He had to be better than nothing, right?
But hopefully the six-hundred and fifty million dollar science experiment—plus change—would help them both find a bit of peace.
"I'm here to help you, gentlemen. I'm here to save the boy."
"Rhodey, Sam, target just below the neck!" Tony called as he dodged yet another repulsor blast, screeching to a halt before launching another missile. "That's the only weak spot I've been able to find, so we gotta exploit it!"
"No. It didn't."
Much to Tony's annoyance, the ensuing hours somehow didn't see a need to go by any faster than before, almost taunting him with their complete lack of consideration for his patience and stress levels. Outside the base the days went by as they always did, with the nightly curfews still in place while forces loyal to Colonel Phillips stamped down the small remaining pockets of resistance. The base brig actually had a net decrease in occupants, as several of the people being held had been detained without charge simply out of suspicion, with General O'Brien and his immediate circle being housed together in one semi-large cell and guarded by no less than twenty men.
It was a long shot, but at the moment it was all he had.
"Yeah, I guess," Lang muttered, wringing his hands. "So… are you guys gonna turn me over to the FBI now or something?"
Natasha grinned. "Thanks, I think the twins are going to love it. I know it's only high school, but this is a pretty big deal for them."
"Dr Cho doesn't know for sure," Steve answered, grateful when his voice didn't wobble. "She said it wouldn't be as long as his first one, but… he's pretty banged up, Nat, so—"
Tony thought miserably.
Steve offered Tony his arm once he'd locked his office door, trying and failing to ignore the warmth spreading across his chest as they made their way outside and headed towards the ball field. The night was beautifully clear, the air crisp and cool and the stars shining brightly as Steve spread the blanket out on a flat stretch of ground and sat down.
“Oh Christ, honey, of course we can.”  Tony grabbed onto Steve’s hand and headed for the door, remembering at the last second to turn back so he could snuff out the cigar still sitting on the desk.
Peter whimpered, hating how small he sounded. "Please, don't yell! I can't—I just can't take it!"
"Well,
“This is all I could find,” he says as he hands Steve one of the bottles.  “I’m guessing they’re leftovers from whenever Strucker and his goons tested this place out.”
“Captain,” Thor says as he grabs hold of Steve’s shoulder.  “Captain, I am here, but I am afraid I’m going to have to ask you to move.  You see, I cannot release the tether, so—”
Peter thought.
"And I'm sure you can guess the rest, mo grá, you're pretty smart," Steve murmured. He was already cursing their twelve-plus hours flight time. "But why does your undersuit have to be so form-fitting?"
“Yeah, Dad.  I know,” Peter says, a bit impatiently.  “I finished my math before you picked me up from school, so all I have left is chemistry and history.”
"All right, little guy, take this carefully," Steve said as he handed Peter a stick of cinnamon. Still overwhelmed by the sheer number of choices in the grocery store spice aisle, Steve preferred to stick with what he knew as much as possible. Which meant buying actual cinnamon sticks and grating the amount that he needed instead of relying on the powdered stuff that seemed to be preferred now.
"Yeah, it's better to be safe than sorry," Steve said after a short pause. "We'll just keep most of our big equipment on the jet."
“Allow me to introduce StarkTablet version five point one.”
"Is there something that you'd like to share with the rest of the class, Mr Stark-Rogers?" the teacher suddenly said. Peter gulped, ducking down into his hoodie as the entire class turned to stare at him.
"We can't afford to think like that," Steve finished. "Who did you see at the hearing?"
Gwen bit her bottom lip, shifting nervously on her feet. "It's for a physics internship," she said. "At Oxford."
"So the bottom line is, we don't know for sure," said Steve, his free hand clenching into a fist at his side. He could feel both Tony's worried eyes and Sam's concerned ones boring into the sides of his head, so he was trying very hard not to give into his welling panic. The team needed him to be their Captain, not the blubbering mess he felt like being at the moment.
“You guys, Obie got arrested!” Peter exclaimed, lifting his head.  “Ned saw it on one of his news apps!  You did it!”
There was no way Steve could allow that to happen. He, and Tony as well, simply had to believe that just like their country—no, actually their entire
"Yeah, whatever," Tony mumbled, briefly squeezing his eyes closed. He was starting to panic again, and now was really
“Tony!  You were—you were barely—!”  He breaks off, rubbing his palms up and down Tony’s arms.
"And only on weekends, buddy," said Tony. He planted a quick kiss on Peter's forehead, jerking his head towards Peter's corner of the lab. "Now, go get your books so you can get started on your homework, yeah?"
Winter Soldier's eyes flicked up towards the colonel, his upper lip twitching into a defiant sneer as his metal fingers curled around the arm of the chair. "Нет," he said again. "Я не соблюдаю."
"Yeah, Uncle Sam always knows who owes who what," said Peter. "We should start calling him the human ledger or something."
"Yeah," Tony said with a chuckle. "Who would've thought, hmm?"
Gwen raised her eyebrows, nodding. "Okay. Well—"
All he'd ever wanted to do was serve his country, the very same country his own father had given his life for, and protect his family that he loved more than his own life. Almost every single decision that he'd made since he had turned eighteen years old had been toward one or both of those ends, so how could Davis not see that?
"Wait!" Steve forced past his clenched teeth, barely able to breathe from the pain. "I don't—I don't want anything. I wanna feel it. All of it."
"I know what happened," Peter cut in. "With Papa and General O'Brien. Ms Sharon told me."
"Hey, Liz!" Ned replied with a wave. "You have a really nice house!"
"Well, I was working with pretty limited resources, so you're right about that," said Tony. "But seriously, buddy, if I constantly judged myself on stuff that I did when I was sixteen, well… let's just say that you probably wouldn't be here, 'cause I wouldn't be here either."
"What?" Thor croaked, stepping back in shock. "What did you just do?"
"Hey, kiddo," he said. He sounded gruff, like he'd just woken up. "Sleep okay?"
“Mmm, that doesn't sound very convincing, hon,” Tony said, his eyebrows knitting together into a frown.  “You know you don't have to do this, right?  I’m perfectly capable of going in there and telling Obie exactly where he can stick it on my own, and—”
And then, who knows how much use of his left arm he would’ve had.  Steve knew his shoulder was going rapidly downhill when he stopped being able to easily button his jeans, but didn't realise just how badly he had deteriorated until he woke up in the recovery room to the news that instead of the surgeon performing his procedure arthroscopically, as she usually did, she was forced to use an open incision, leaving Steve with an ugly-as-hell three-inch scar right down the front of his shoulder, and a recovery time that was taking over twice as long as it would have otherwise.
Sometimes he just
"Yeah," she said as her father pulled up in his patrol car, with Papa's truck directly behind him. "Just text me once you know for sure."
Not unless—
Embarrassment washed over Tony as he tried to tear his eyes away, but, like usual, the intensity of Steve's gaze held him locked in place.
"Last thing I need now is another concussion," he muttered as he stacked the books into a pile, setting them on his bedside table.
Tony could only nod, not at all comfortable discussing the relationship he had with his husband with the man Steve had confessed to once being in love with, and even less so in front of Peter. Deep down Tony knew he had nothing to worry about, that his petty insecurities were all in his head, but he still didn't enjoy being reminded of them.
"We will, sir," said Stacy, followed by a series of three gunshots. "He's also very concerned for Peter, says he thinks that he saw him briefly before they were both overpowered."
Now the entire project could be in jeopardy. If there actually was a spy in the Air Corps that'd been feeding the Meridian government intelligence about Langaran tech, then Peter feared that he could write all of the encryption layers for JARVIS that he wanted and it still might not be enough to keep his papa safe during the mission, or keep his father from getting arrested for treason.
Phillips sucked in a deep breath, squaring his shoulders as he jerked his head towards Sam.
"There, there, little guy, you're safe now," Papa said once Peter was finally cleaned up and settled in his bed, his bandaged elbow propped up on an extra pillow. Papa was trying to sound reassuring, but even in his pain-induced delusional state Peter could still make out the thick edge of fear and anger in his voice, and still sense the worried looks that he and Dad were exchanging over his head.
“Oh, good God, will you just quit with this whole Stark Relief Foundation nonsense?” Obie interrupted.  “Tony, that was never meant to turn into some big thing!  We only created it to shut all those damn anti-war protestors up!”
“I know, baby.  I love you too.”  With another kiss, Tony slid off of Steve’s waist and tapped him on the shoulder.  “Roll over for me, yeah?”
"I think I've got the MAUDE glasses just about ready," he said. "I've had JARVIS running every single simulation that I can think of for the past three days, so as long as you and Bucky are still good to go, then—"
"Planning stage?" asked Tony.
" he murmured. "All of you."
"Yeah, that'd—that'd probably help me think," he added. "I'm—well… I'm kinda—"
Sucking in a deep breath, Tony turned to Steve. "I saw him, hon. I saw Pete, the day he was born. The day—"
"Uh huh," he said as he licked his dry lips, his brown eyes a bit less confused now. "Dad? What—what happened to me?"
A lump rose in Peter's throat, and he grabbed his milk, draining the rest of the carton in three large gulps as he tried to come up with a response that didn't sound too snarky. Peter had heard plenty about survivor's guilt from not only Papa, but Uncle James and Uncle Sam as well, so he knew it was a real, legitimate thing, but it still irritated him that someone could be so quick to judge his papa for something that wasn't his fault and that he had no control over.
"No, you may not," Peter said firmly. "Override code Hufflepuff2."
Even if they were moving almost agonisingly slow.
Steve thought, but forced himself to answer anyway.
"You mean her gossip club, right?" Gwen asked as they made their way towards their homeroom classroom. "'Cause I swear all your mom seems to do there is talk about people."
"We can talk more about that once we get back from our trip, okay buddy?" Dad said. "It's only a couple more weeks."
"Nevermind that!" Blaster Guy yelped, his arm tightening around Peter's neck. "What the hell are you guys doing here?"
"So, do I want to know why there weren't any prices listed on the menu?" Steve asked with a smile, one that made his blue eyes sparkle and reveal the dimple that never failed to make Tony's breath catch.
The starting gun catches him so completely off-guard that for the tiniest fraction of a second, Steve freezes.  He’s thankfully able to recover before anyone notices—besides Phillips, if he’s watching—but he still is last to hit the water, already giving him a huge disadvantage.  Once underwater, Steve completes his usual six dolphin kicks, but with the pain in his shoulder ramping up he’s not able to squeeze his hands together as tightly as he usually does, and therefore doesn’t get nearly the amount of push he usually gets from them by the time he surfaces to take his first stroke.
Once he'd finished tying on his flight boots, Steve picked up his sketchbook and sat down on the edge of the bed, reaching for Tony's hand.
Dad had tried calling the phone number given to him by the FBI agent who'd arrested Papa as soon as he had gotten home the night before, which turned out to be nothing but an operator at an answering service who promised Dad that they would "pass along the message as soon as regular business hours resumed" on Monday.
"And I'm gonna send someone in to empty your trash and clean up a bit in that office of yours too," Rhodey had warned as he placed a set of clean clothes onto the bench outside the stall. "Gods, Tony, there's no need for you to be living like you're still in university!"
"Well, I can't say that I usually spend a lot of time talking about when I was a baby," Peter said, clearing his throat. "And I really don't get why everyone else sees the need to talk about it either."
And then, not even a second later,
"All right." Tony pulled back, trying to look stern even though he knew he was utterly failing. "But don't you ever,
"I've finished it, Dad. It only needs to be tested now and then it'll be ready."
"The sceptre!" Peter exclaimed, immediately clapping his hand over his mouth. Neither Uncle Sam or Auntie Nat had super hearing, but it still wouldn't do him any good to push things.
“Oh,” Steve chokes out, because of course if he’s freezing, then Tony’s probably even more so.  He opens his arms, his heart fluttering as Tony crawls into them, tucking his head under Steve’s chin.  Heat blooms across Steve’s chest as Tony curls his arm up around Steve’s neck and slides his leg across his waist, letting out a long, arduous breath once he’s settled.
"Why not, Dad?" the middle boy piped up from across the table. "Captain America is pretty cool, we even learned about him at school!"
"Mmm, if you say so," Sam said suspiciously. "I still think you're acting weird but hey, what do I know, hmm?"
"Oh, you think?" Tony retorted.
"Hey, Papa?" he said as he sat down next to the coffee table. "Would you wanna play a game of chess?"
If he had been thinking more clearly when he got to the truck stop, he would've tried to find a truck whose doors were unlocked so he could've hidden in the back of the cab or something. But instead he had just jumped onto the first truck that he saw leaving in the right direction, and therefore was now stuck—both literally and figuratively—in the small space between the cab and the crate.
"Oh, I'm fine. You don't need to worry about me." Steve bit down on his bottom lip, shifting on his feet. This wasn't how he'd planned to apologise, but he may as well just go with it anyway.
“All right, bud,” Tony finally said.  “I’ll text you once I leave the office, yeah?  Should be around 4:30 or so.”
"No, no, no! Please, stop!" Peter screamed, slapping at his right ear with his palm and begging himself to not hear them, to not hear those words that he knew would cause him to drop right down into oblivion yet again. He could already feel his hold on the wall weakening, already sense his mind slipping away from him, when suddenly a police officer broke through what remained of the main doors, his gun raised and aimed directly at the monster.
“Well, all right, all right, just hold your horses,” Obie cut in.  “I’m only calling to remind you that you’re gonna need a date for that benefit coming up at the end of June.  Can’t have
"Glad you approve," Peter said, his cheeks flushing hot when Gwen gave him one of
Steve's heart immediately began to thud, his hand shaking lightly on the throttle as he carefully manoeuvred his aircraft out of the hangar, followed by Carol and the rest of the A-shift pilots. He'd half-expected General O'Brien or one of his so-called "parliament" to show up at the hangar, perhaps to give a speech or something since from what he knew the Phoenix mission was still a first for the Langaran Air Corps. But there had been no sign of him or anyone else, and it both puzzled and worried Steve.
Several minutes of silence passed, with Steve almost wishing for another alien attack or something so he wouldn't have to deal with any of it, and Sam waiting patiently like he always did, not pushing too hard, the no-nonsense look on his face that meant he wasn't going to let Steve get away with any of his avoidance tactics yet again.
Lorraine also said that the father called because the kid recognised Steve’s name, which could mean a couple of different things.  Either the kid is a spoiled brat who gets everything he wants out of some feeling of guilt on his parents’ part, or he’s an actual fan of the sport and just assumed that Steve would be interested in coaching now that he’s retired from competition.
"Oh," Steve whispered, gasping as the smouldering embers of the anguish he'd been carrying ever since the snap suddenly flared back to life. All this time he'd been trying to convince himself that he and Tony just needed to move on, that they needed to acknowledge that Peter was never coming back and try and pick up the pieces of their lives. But now—
"JARVIS? Has Pete left for that field trip of his yet?" he asked, trying to sound casual, and failing miserably.
"Yes, yes," Steve said as he broke away from Tony's mouth. A low growl rumbled up from his chest as he cupped his hands under Tony's ass, squeezing it as he carried him over to their bed, laying him down before crawling up to hover over him. Tony gulped as he looked deep into Steve's blown-black eyes, filled with such tenderness and adoration that his breath caught in his throat.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes, C-Captain Rogers," said Lang. "Ah, very much so."
"I thought you were supposed to go to a safehouse or something when your dads were out on missions," said Gwen. "Isn't that what you usually do?"
"It's not a problem, General," Steve replied. "Please let us know if we can do anything else."
not to get my hopes up, but I just don't think I can help it anymore. This has to work. It just
want his dads to find out about. No sense in giving them even more reasons to hover.
But now that synergistic system was missing its Captain, and Tony knew without a doubt that there was no way it would ever be the same again unless they found him.
, Tony dumped it off in the kitchen before continuing on into Peter's room. Peter had set up the five-gallon fish tank that Bucky had bought him for Christmas on his reading table next to the windows, thinking that Finley, the fish, would enjoy the occasional look out on the city while he was away at school. This all despite the fact that even though the fish's tank was massive for such a tiny fish, it also featured so many tank accessories that it closely resembled one of the flea circuses that had been so popular during Steve's boyhood years.
Steve's frown grew even deeper. "Well, that's the weird part. It says here that they found him hiding inside an empty salt shaker, but… I have to think it's got to be a joke, because… a grown man just can't hide inside a salt shaker, right?"
“You better get a hustle on your homework, yeah, bud?” Tony says once they arrive in their building’s parking garage.  “It’s getting late.”
"He's fine, Steve. Or as fine as he can be," James said firmly as he pushed Steve into a sitting position, glaring harshly at him. "But you're sure as hell not. I mean, geez! What the hell are you doing?"
"Yeah, but Steve's right," Bruce said with a shrug. "If they come for one of us then they're gonna be coming for all of us, so we should probably be ready."
"All right," he said as he plunked himself down onto the couch, opposite from Tony. "So, who wants to go first?"
"Me too," Steve said. "I just…"
"Eh, I nailed it, it was easy," Peter said with a shrug. He grabbed onto his polar bear, hugging it to his chest. "When're you guys coming home?"
"Well… once Hank explained that it was him who'd been behind the whole thing, he took me into his secret lab inside his house and offered me the chance to see my daughter again."
She simply was breathtaking. So unbelievably gorgeous that most of the time Peter couldn't understand what the hell she even saw in him.
“The Brits actually sent one of these rare sets to Ireland?”
"She is almost eighteen years old," said T'Challa. He turned to Steve, giving him a knowing look. "Not too much older than your son, I believe."
And as long as that mission went okay, then it would hopefully only be a few more weeks before the real Project Phoenix mission would begin. As long as JARVIS was good and the pilots didn't mess anything up during the trial, the only limiting factor would be Dad building the container for the tesseract, and he had told Peter the last time he'd visited that he was planning to get started on it within the next week or so.
"Yeah, that's fair," Tony said with a nod. He turned to Thor, eyeing the massive axe in his hands. "You're sure you can bury that thing in Thanos' neck this time? Preferably right under his chin?"
"You may regret that," said Dr Strange, laced with arrogance. "Your technomage brought you face-to-face with a Master of the Mystic Arts."
A heavy pause settled over the group as Tony and Peter exchanged loaded glances. Finally, Tony spoke up.
"Holy shit!" he exclaimed, blinking against his watery eyes as he took off racing towards it. He could no longer imagine any scenario where its intentions could be anything other than hostile since that power plant was the main source of electricity for almost the entire continent. "Base, I have eyes on the unidentified aircraft and it appears to be on a direct kamikaze course for the power plant. Do I have permission to fire?"
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! 💗
the nurse explained. "
Steve scoffed. "No, but Hitler was insane, so I'm not surprised. Now, President Cole on the other hand… he seems way too smooth and charming to be insane, but I suppose you never know."
Dad's lower lip started to tremble, and he caught it between his teeth. "Well, if you're saying it, then it must be true." Then he brushed the hair from Peter's forehead, pressing a kiss there. "I s'pose it's time to head downstairs now?"
Sam's lower lip started to shake, his dark eyes filling with tears. "He's—he's in surgery," he whispered. "The docs… well… they think that he might—that he's probably gonna lose his arm. That beam, whatever the hell it was, it blasted right through his aircraft and—and it got—it got his whole left side, but his arm took the brunt, so… the docs said that they'll know more once they get in there and see the full extent of the damage, but… right now it's not looking too good."
"As long as you report for dinner duty at six, all right? I'm pretty sure Uncle Bucky and Uncle Sam will be joining us."
"Then I will take him out!" yelled Thor, letting out an almost feral growl as Thanos drew closer. "And I, Thor Odinson, god of thunder, will finally have my revenge!"
Unfortunately, most of the answers he'd ended up getting had only led into more questions, and with how exhausted Sarah had sounded on the phone Steve hadn't wanted to press her too much. Her arthritic pain had been bothering her a lot more than she'd wanted to admit, but being the proud, fiery lady that she was, Steve was loath to push her to get more help out of fear of alienating her. The last thing he needed in his suddenly upside-down life was for his ma to be angry with him.
"Yes, sir."
Identification, separation, and persecution.
"I see. And have you any further news on Captain Barnes?" O'Brien asked.
"That'd be my preference as well," Bruce suddenly piped up over the comm. "The hole you guys blew in the ceiling took out both HYDRA's cloaking ability and the sensor jam, so I'm trying to transfer as many files as I can before they're gone. We're gonna need all the evidence we can get to root out all the moles they've got scattered across the world."
“No, I should’ve made it more clear,” Steve says firmly.  “And for that, I am sorry.”  He presses a kiss to Tony’s forehead.  “Now, will you please try and sleep?  I’m here.  I've got you.  You're safe.”
"No, what you need is to go back to sleep, sweetheart," Steve said, gently but firmly. "You're exhausted, and there's nothing in the lab that can't wait until morning."
“I’ll see you in an hour.”
"Thor showed up at the Tower about an hour ago with a weird haircut," Uncle Sam cut in, sounding grim. "He's also missing an eye, so your dad's already started on a new one while Cap debriefs him."
"Are you all right, sweetheart?" he asked. "What is it?"
"mission".
"But I didn't," he continued. "As much as I hated to admit it, my shell was already starting to crack. Because I wasn't really living, Tony. I was simply just trying to survive.
Two lengths of the pool.  Down and back.
"Then you of all people should know what this tells us," Steve huffed. He tried to yank his hand away but Tony held on tight, grateful for the added strength from his armour.
"Very good, sir."
"Jesus, Ned!" Peter exclaimed. "Dude, you can't sneak up on me like that!"
"Cap, we've got new incoming!" he cried as he swooped overhead, his dual guns blazing. "Looks like goddamn garden rotors!"
“Ah, probably not as much as you all sacrificed for the lot of us, Captain,” said Fury.  “And thank you, by the way.  I was a Marine in my former life, so… I know a bit of what it’s like.”
Which suited Steve just fine. Peter had been eleven already when Steve first met him, and he was in no hurry for the boy to grow up any faster than he already was. He wanted to enjoy as much time with Peter as he could before he really grew up and left home.
Steve gave him a soft smile. "Is it bad of me to be glad that he's gone? I don't know, I didn't even meet the guy, but there was just something about the way he wrote his proposal that just didn't sit well with me."
Steve breathes in, willing himself not to tear up.  There was a time when he believed that, a time when he thought he was loved.  And it turned out to be nothing more than a façade.
"Oh no," Peter said softly. "I am so, so sorry about that. HYDRA killed him?"
"Sorry," Peter replied. "Didn't wanna spoil anything."
" he demanded. "You're telling me that my boy's been suffering for over eight years just 'cause his fucking government wanted to keep playing war games? Were we ever gonna have peace in our time?"
"Really?" Steve blurted, his heart thudding. He had guessed that she'd liked Tony well enough during their dinner, but with everything going on he had been too afraid to ask her point-blank what she had thought of him.
"Whatever it takes," he whispered as he felt the sharp tug behind his navel again, reappearing inside the training dome less than a heartbeat later. As soon as he shut down the tunnel, Tony rushed over from the command area, his face etched in concern as Steve's helmet retracted.
Once Tony's breathing had evened out, Steve leaned back in his chair, trailing the pad of his thumb across Tony's knuckles. Shuri had told Steve the night before that Tony's skin grafts were all doing beautifully, which, Peter had explained, wasn't surprising since they had been grown from samples of Tony's own skin and soft tissue cells. There weren't even any scars left behind, which Steve found absolutely incredible given how badly Tony had been burned.
"Don't you dare give me that!" Tony snapped, wincing when Peter flinched in Steve's arms. "You got trapped in ice and almost
Tony's belly gave a swoop as he looked over Peter's head at Steve, his worry wrinkle already on full display. They had avoided the news coverage on purpose while on their trip, but Tony had specifically asked JARVIS to inform them of anything that he presumed to be vital information, and he hadn't said a word about anything the entire week.
"Okay, so Morris Bench, um…" he squinted at the screen, shaking his head. "Ah, maybe it'd be easier if Nat just read 'em."
"Which you still need to explain to me," Steve reminded him gently. "Or I guess to all three of us. You mentioned something about an orbital defence system way back on our first date, but we haven't heard anything else."
They had
“Uh huh.”  Peter fiddled with his pencil, tapping the eraser against the keyboard.  He’d been just about ready to start snooping around in Dad’s files when Ned called, and he was already getting way past antsy.
"As you can see, the overall hull design of the X-302 is quite similar to the X-301 and the cockpit is essentially the same, so you won't have to learn an entirely new set of controls. The main difference is in the layout of the engines, which exchanges one large central engine for two smaller twin engines. This will allow for the aircraft to still function in the event of a single engine failure and hopefully prevent possible aircraft destruction, as well as pilot injuries. There is also—"
"Well…" Steve said, shooting Tony his
"Oh," said Blaster Peter. "Well, I dunno. I didn't ask."
wanted was to fly back to their spring break villa in Italy and bury his head in the sand, but since that didn't seem to be an option at the moment, he thought he probably should tell Gwen what he'd found.
"Well, I suppose that's not all bad," Gwen whispered back. "She's probably tougher than the judges will be at the actual competition, so if you think about it, our team should be a shoo-in."
"I'd say that's more like
"Well, since there appears to be minimal opposition, I think hitting 'em from two sides should be enough," Steve said after a short pause. He pointed to the northwest and southeast corners, both housing occupied guard towers. "You and Sam will hit these towers simultaneously, take out the guards and then move counterclockwise to the next tower until they're all clear while Natasha, Clint, and I stake out the main entrance. Clint will pick off any visible guards, and then we'll move in with you and Sam watching our six. I think Bruce'll be okay to sit this one out. We can always call him in if things get dicey, but from the looks of it, it likely won't."
And the timing couldn’t be worse.  Ever since Steve landed in Athens and moved into the Olympic Village, his sleep has been shit, intermittent and laced with dreams of Ma dying alone in the hospital while Brock forbids Steve to go and see her because he needs to practise.  People would say that Steve was brave for finally wising up to the toxicity of his relationship and kicking Brock to the curb, but deep down, Steve knows the truth.
"Under no circumstances can the Time Stone fall into Thanos' hands," said Dr Strange. "We must come up with a way to protect it."
“Copy that,” Steve answers as he zooms on his bike towards one of the southern towers.  He launches his shield at a tree, where it ricochets, taking out two agents before it bounces to a second tree and then a third. He catches it with his arm just as one of Tony’s repulsor blasts fires off to his right, taking out the driver of another truck just as his HYDRA teammate is attempting to fire at Clint.
But this, sitting in Tony Stark’s penthouse playing chess with the sweetest boy he’d ever met in his life after indulging in the absolute best Italian food he’d ever eaten and getting to sneak glances at the most beautiful man he’d ever seen, well… he could definitely do this all day.
"Babe?" Tony murmured, gently tugging on his arm. "C'mon, let's go for a walk or something, yeah?"
much trouble—
Peter wondered as he skimmed over the pages.
Gwen's pretty green eyes flicked nervously around the hallway before landing on Peter's. "Yeah, actually. I got a letter in the mail yesterday, inviting me to interview for a summer internship."
"I don't believe Bucky would do that," Steve said softly. "He's stronger than that, especially if he knows that it's coming. But Tony… I'm not sure about Peter. He's only a child, and—"
"If that's even possible," Tony said, followed by such a powerful full-body shudder that it shook the entire bed. "Steve, I
"Pretty sure Hulk would have a thing or two to say about that, but you're definitely damn close," Tony said. "I'm also pretty sure that Carol could hold her own with those stones too, based on what she did to that ship."
he was found not guilty, and the government still felt that they needed a scapegoat?
"Um, I just wanna say, that if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something and I eat one of you, I'm sorry."
And later, how hard he had fought against the Winter Soldier programming HYDRA had tried to install in him, and how he deciphered the HYDRA code that led the team to the hidden Georgia bunker, nearly singlehandedly rescuing Steve from their clutches.
"But whatever HYDRA did to them obviously didn't work right," said Bruce. "'Cause now they're both dead, and neither one were successful—"
Definitely a hell of a lot different from his usual mundane pitches to the military brass.  Although Tony had to admit that it was sometimes amusing to watch as a group of jarhead peacocks dropped to lick his shoes everytime he stepped into the room, actually presenting an innovative idea to a group of top professionals, and then have those very professionals pester him with questions until he had them convinced, had given him such a rush of adrenaline that he’d almost been able to forgo his coffee for the rest of the day.
"Absolutely, bud," Tony said, relieved when his voice didn't crack. "And if anyone can convince them to start talking to us, it's Fury and Papa, right?"
"Even though you don't ever actually use the microwave," Tony said, raising an eyebrow. "Something about not wanting your food to be blasted with radiation?"
Peter gave a nod as his mask closed over his face. "Yeah. Okay."
"Well, I can't say that it's good," James said as they entered Bruce's lab, where the pager sat connected to one of his external power sources. "It just kinda stopped whatever the hell it was doing."
"Uh huh. Love you too."
"What the hell is going on?" Tony demanded. "What is this?"
Knowing that Tony never got much of that from his own father—or any, really, based on what Tony and Peter have told him—makes it even more precious.
Tony smiled proudly, drumming his fingers against his cup. "That's my boy."
“Yes, yes, and I know you’ll be absolutely brilliant, my darling.”  Mags pats Peter on his hands, then stands to her feet, looking down at Tony.  “Your usual, then?”
"Unfortunately, no," answered Bruce. "Like I said, this decryption is about as difficult as they come, and there's no salvaging anything if we happen to pick the wrong key. That's the main reason why it's taking so long. There's already been three files that we've lost to choosing the wrong key, so it's possible there was more information about Raxton in one of those, but… now we'll never know."
Dad immediately rolled his eyes, prompting Papa to chuckle.
"Hey. You're not the only one who's trying to protect him," Tony said with a frown. "And I don't care how strong he is, he's still just a kid, and no kid, not even a genius one, makes sound, rational decisions when they're fifteen. I know I sure as hell didn't."
Which, now that the registration act had been killed, he was hoping would be sooner rather than later. He had noticed that Dad had already started work on a new set of uniforms for the entire team, including Uncle James, as well as discussing with Pepper about possibly taking legal action against Quentin Beck for the theft of Stark Industries property.
"Gwen's fine, little guy. She's at home with her family," Steve said as he patted Peter's back. "She told us that you saved her."
Peter mentioned that Steve won his first gold medal right out of college, which Tony figures would put him at about twenty-two years old here.
"Whoops," Tony said as he came to a halt in midair, followed by the crash of the final target as it smashed to the ground, taken out by Sam. "Sorry 'bout that, Nat."
"Yeah, and you know that's not what I meant," Sam said. "You've been… kinda off lately."
"I know, I know." There was another pause as Peter heard Ned's mother call out his name, presumably for dinner. "Mom says that dinner's ready, so I guess I'll talk to you later?"
"Whoa!" Peter said for probably the zillionth time since they'd arrived. "You guys have Star Trek down here? That's so cool!"
"Well, you're not wrong, actually," said Tony. "How small were you before?"
"See, and the satellites would attach to each aircraft at the missile mounts," Tony said, pointing to the diagram that Peter had just finished the day before. "So with three aircraft available we'd be able to carry twelve total satellites."
“Okay, point taken,” admitted Tony.  “But that still doesn't answer my question as to why you were looking up drug trial info in the first place.”
But Peter didn't really have the patience to wait for diplomacy, and neither did Dad. They both wanted answers
"Oh gods, it's a kid," one of the medics said as soon as he laid eyes on Peter. "What's his medical history?"
Steve’s cheeks flushed a light pink.  “Yes, I did,” he said quietly.  “Drawing is another hobby of mine.”
It was all way too eerily familiar, and the fact that Steve had nearly had to deck Bucky to get him to calm down a bit wasn't lost on him either. Bucky had been doing remarkably well ever since they'd managed to remove his Winter Soldier programming, and his relationship with Sam was even stronger evidence of his recovery. But Steve knew that just like him and Tony, Bucky still had his limits. And anytime some enemy of the Avengers decided to skip over all of them and go after Peter, that was when all of Bucky's repressed anger and resentment tended to come out.
"D-daddy, we c-can't l-let him d-die!" Peter sobbed into Tony's shoulder. "We gotta get him out!"
Awesome cover art by therollingstonys, thank you so much! 💖
He only had to get there.
on the window of his cell startled Steve awake, and he groaned, slowly peeling his eyes open and shielding them against the harsh white light as the silhouette of a bespectacled brown-haired man dressed in a very expensive suit came into focus.
"Both Starks can take up elevated positions," Dr Strange said. "The rest can then spread out along the ground. I'll be waiting in plain sight, as when Thanos arrives he will no doubt be drawn directly towards the stone."
Peter exclaimed. "Why isn't there a way? Uncle Sam doesn't care that you lost an arm, 'cause he didn't only love your arm! He loves all of you!"
"I said,
"Yes, Dad, I'm not an idiot," muttered Peter. "I know my clearance level isn't as high as yours and Papa's."
By now, Steve was used to the hard tug behind his belly that preceded him entering the tunnel, used to the brilliant colours of the warp trails as he flew within them.
No longer was Tony forced to work for the very same government that had effectively ruined his father's life. No longer did he have to worry about whether Peter would survive another day. No longer was he buried under an almost unthinkable accumulation of debt, all because he refused to give up on the son that he loved beyond reason.
After securing the Stacys inside the Tower and collecting all of their gear, including Tony's Veronica armour, the team had made a quick stop in D.C. to pick up James and then taken off for Wakanda. King T'Challa had promised Steve the full use of his warriors for the presumed battle that lay ahead, for which Steve was both grateful and relieved.
"Yeah, that’d be nice," agreed Steve. "But if something were to happen again, then… it would kill me if some evil or corrupt government decided to go after Peter just because they knew he was so much smarter and stronger than the average person."
"Peter," Papa said sternly. "You're never a bother to me, and you know it."
"Will do."
"Yeah, honey, I do," Tony said as he brushed a soft kiss across Steve's forehead. "'Cause we're in this together, right? Whatever it takes."
"Mmm," grumbled Peter. "'Cept I'm such a big hero that I can't seem to keep myself awake whenever anything bad happens. What good is a hero who's always falling asleep on the job?"
"A cup of coffee wouldn't hurt," Tony said, attempting a smile when Rhodey rolled his eyes.
"Right," said Steve, nodding towards Peter. "Dad and I need to discuss something for a second, little guy, okay? We'll be right back."
Tony thought as Peter offered Gwen his arm to walk out to the car.
"Mmm. Only in the good ways." Mischief flashed in Steve's eyes as he slid his left leg up to hook around Tony's, flipping them over before Tony could get another word out.
And yet, ever since he and Maria had brought Tony home two weeks after the attack, the boy had been absolutely terrified of the dark. It had gotten to the point where he was now refusing to sleep—to even close his eyes—unless there was a light on, and as he was still trying to recover from his complicated, nearly eight-hour surgery, he needed all the rest that he could get.
Peter shot him a harsh glare. "I'm not touchy about it, just—"
"Nah, the training at least gives him something to do," Tony said. "And it's also in a controlled setting with people who would all rather die than hurt him, so it's really the best thing for him. He gets to pretend to be a superhero and burn off some steam, and we get a little less grumpy kid."
"Yes, it is," Howard said with a nod. "According to the file, the recipient's name was Johann Schmidt."
exclaimed Uncle Bucky.
“But Tony’s not involved with the company at all,” adds Natasha.  “Or at least, not anymore.  He actually owns a body shop over in Midtown.  One that caters to the rich and famous, apparently.”
So as long as Peter didn't forget that even though he was enhanced it didn't mean that he actually
"That's right," Steve said. "It's where we recovered the initial data on the algorithm, and the ship was supposed to be turned over to SHIELD once we left, but—"
"I don't know," answered Peter, bracing himself as the next impact grew closer and closer. "I don't—I don't know, but don't worry. I've got you."
"Okay, now you're really worrying me," Gwen said, her pretty face etched with concern. "You sure you can't give me a hint or something? You're not sick, are you?"
"Yeah, I don't need to know any more than that," Steve said. Sam was a bit older than Bucky, about five years, and while Bucky had had more dating experience Sam had definitely had more experience with actual relationships, so Steve wasn't too surprised to hear that Sam was Bucky's first.
"But, honey, she'd—" He broke off, clearing his throat. "We'd need to get her all the supplies, and the monitors, and—"
"Damn," Peter muttered. He buried his nose into his polar bear, thinking. "Um… what about the drones on the D.C. building, would their range be long enough?"
“Uh huh,” said Peter.  “I think tacos sound good for tonight.”
In fact, if guilt could ever be converted into usable currency, Tony was certain that he'd be a billionaire several times over.
"No, I do not," he said. "If the Battle of New York hadn't happened, that doesn't mean that nothing else would've, so having an already assembled team that can take care of the big threats like that makes a lot of sense."
"Please," Steve said, begging now. "I just need—need to forget for awhile, sweetheart. Need to empty my mind and just
There had been so many nights over the past month where Tony feared that he might never see Steve again, and now—now he was right there, right in front of him.
"Can we go get some food now?" Peter asked once everyone had taken their turn. "I'm hungry."
He had failed to keep his child safe, and therefore no longer deserved to be loved.
didn't give a shit about who you hurt, just so long as it made you rich!”
"It's been years since I've been with anyone," he said. "And since you said that you've never… I was thinking maybe we don't have to—"
And when it didn't, when Steve felt nothing more than the incredible orgasmic bliss that he’d come to crave with Tony, he was able to relax just a little bit more the next time.  And then a bit more the next time, and so on.
“Buddy, there’s something—”
"Get the hell off of me, goddamnit! I need to—I need to get to—"
"Well, I'm sitting here, aren't I? And the job is finished, so it seems as though I was a pretty decent choice."
Her lower lip shaking, Gwen finally nodded, pecking Peter's lips again. "I love you too," she whispered. "Please, be careful!"
"Steve, just don't think, okay?" begged Tony. "Just… try and stay awake so I can see those gorgeous blue eyes of yours when you land, yeah? We're bringing you home now."
Barely fifteen minutes later Steve was on his motorcycle and racing towards the hospital. But he had no sooner set foot on the paediatric floor when he suddenly stopped short. So much had changed since his last visit that he couldn't believe it had only been a couple of days, and he needed to make sure that he didn't reveal anything inappropriate to Peter.
Dad said, stating exactly what Peter was thinking. If the Meridians did have a spy embedded somewhere in the Air Corps, then that could mean whoever it was could also know about not only Project Phoenix, but JARVIS as well.
"Um… I don't think he really understands the rules of the game," Gwen whispered to Peter.
Knowing that the people responsible for his horrific injury were going to be put away for the rest of their lives would hopefully give him some much-needed closure.
The irony that it was now him who couldn't seem to tear himself away from the repeating loop of news footage wasn't lost on Tony as he paced back and forth in his lab, impatiently waiting for Steve and the others to get home so Fury could debrief them. He'd already sent a disgruntled Peter to his room, not wanting him to be exposed to the live-feed coverage of rescuers pulling burned and bleeding bodies out of the wreckage of what used to be some kind of scientific research centre. The kid didn't need to be watching that kind of stuff, not when he'd already lived through something far too similar for Tony's taste. Twice.
But Pym only shook his head, his upper lip curling into a sneer as he stepped back.
Not exactly what Peter would call inconspicuous, but at least they knew better than to try and talk to him.  Especially when he was grumpy.
"No, of course it isn't, but… I just don't think Tony would appreciate people talking about him is all."
something Peter wanted to attempt, and at the moment didn't even consider as an option.
Peter huffed, squinting as he tried to concentrate on opening his locker without breaking the lock. "Just… tired…" he finally said. "Didn't sleep all that great."
"And Peter's got one of these chips on him?" asked Gwen.
“Oh, I’m sure,” Tony says, rather resignedly.  He flashes his warmest smile at the old Italian lady.  “Good thing we have you to take care of us, eh, Mags?”
"We're gonna have to decide about Pete now, you know," Tony said. "He's not gonna give us a moment's peace until we do."
"Aye, Captain," Scott said, offering Steve a salute that he quickly waved away. "Um… so does that mean that I'm—"
“Okay, honey, let’s try this, yeah?” Dad suddenly cut in.  “Try and concentrate, this is where you can change things!”
Light footsteps sounded on the concrete floor and a young woman with long red hair appeared, stopping next to Hammer. Her face was completely blank, her eyes staring straight ahead like a doll, and for some reason she looked very, very familiar.
“Yeah, baby, you feel
So, how in the
“I know!  It just slipped out!” Steve says, somewhat sheepishly.  “Thor was starting to think that’s how regular people actually speak, and I—”
More guilt welled up in Peter's chest, and he mentally kicked himself for being such a jerk. It wasn't Gwen's fault that everything was going to hell.
"Ah, thank you, Captain. I'm glad you're enjoying it."
He supposed he should’ve known it wouldn’t be just as easy as Pepper offering them a twenty percent higher salary, especially since three of them had already accepted research positions at pretty prestigious universities.  Tony had actually been forced to gather all five of them into a secure virtual meeting and pitch them his idea, one of the most difficult pitches of his life, as it turned out.
Peter frowned, trying to shift on his bed without using his still-healing hands. The past three days had been some of the most annoying and embarrassing days of his life without the proper use of his hands, but x-rays earlier that morning had showed that his index fingers weren't completely healed yet so he was still stuck wearing the splints, and which also meant that he hadn't been able to participate in the training sessions with the team either. Helen had told Dad and Papa that it would likely only be another couple of days, but that was two more days of him not being able to even use the bathroom by himself, much less dress or feed himself, and Peter was already beyond over it.
