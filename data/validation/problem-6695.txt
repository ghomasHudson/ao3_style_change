After a few very long moments, a man stepped out from behind the foliage, hands held up as a woman holding something followed him, eyes wide.  "That's Captain America's shield," the woman said, staring at it.
He’s in the middle of ransacking all the drawers of this new room—which doesn’t even have a key cabinet—when the ship creaks ominously, and he straightens and looks around, feeling a lump in his throat.  “Hello?” he says, even though it’s a completely ridiculous, irrational thing to do—what the hell does he expect, the ship to talk back?  Fuck, he’s losing it.  Gritting his teeth, he pulls out more of the drawers, and that’s when the light dims and then goes out entirely, leaving him standing there in the dark, water up to his waist.
"I'll boost you over them!"  Steve held his shield up in time to deflect a third biter and dashed over to the window, positioning the shield in such a way that she could step on it.  "Go!"
“I see you’re back to old joking self,” Sunset says, and for a second, she almost looks genuinely charmed.  Then the moment passes, and she reaches into her pocket to produce a small box.  “Nonetheless, I know you’ve been… discontent lately.  And though I would have
“S-sounds nice,” Steve replies with a tiny smile.  “C-can’t wait.”  He hesitates, then continues, “B-but before we head west… I-I wanna go to B-Brooklyn.  M-my mother… s-she’s buried there.  Cy-Cypress Hills Cemetery.  H-her name is Sarah Rogers.  W-will you come with me, Tony?  To v-visit her?”
"Home…?" Tony repeated, standing up from his spot beside his bag.  His eyes went wide.  "Oh, this can't be.  I've heard of you from… before."  He exhaled sharply, stepping toward her.  "You're a Black Widow."
"They're somewhere safe," Jessica replied, petting Carol's hair.  "I came back to get baby formula.  What happened here?"
Tony looks away again.  “Well, maybe actual talking would be better than aggressive normalcy,” he says after a long moment, and before he knows it, he’s turning back to Steve, words tumbling out of his mouth.  “I’m sorry.  I’m sorry I hurt you and I’m sorry I can’t even remember exactly what I did to hurt you.  I was—I was supposed to trust you, but I didn’t, and that was wrong.  And I know that these are just words and they’re not even close to ever being enough, but… someday I hope I’ll be able to make things right with you.”
Tony growled and drew back from the door, slamming it shut before pushing the rifle aside.  Immediately after, there was a muffled thumping sound as biters tried to get in.  "Ran out of bullets," he said.  "I thought I could shoot them all down, but there were more than I expected.  Where did they even come—"  He cut off then, his lips parting in surprise as he turned to Steve.  "The room's on fire."
Jarvis and Tony arrived in London the next day, with Rhodey coming in that evening.  Tony wasn't sure what about him made Rhodey ask if Tony wanted to share a bed that night, but whatever it was, he was grateful: it wasn't until he curled up with Rhodey under the sheets that he realized how lonely he had been feeling, and how good it was to see Rhodey again, alive and well.
Tony pointed the flashlight in various directions around him.  They seemed to be at the start of a tunnel, but he didn’t have enough light to tell how far it went.  Still, it seemed to be safe, and he had his gauntlets if they ran into any trouble.  “Yeah,” he said.
So he summoned him in his mind's eye: the Steve who always got back up when fighting bullies in Brooklyn, the Steve who had stood his ground when facing off against his father, the Steve who charged so fearlessly into battle even knowing what awaited him in his future.  It came to him like breathing, because Tony knew Steve in a way he knew nothing else, the way he moved and felt, and so long as he lived he would know him.
They’re far away now.  The bodies are out of sight, and the only things that remain from the night before are the ocean and the wind. Tony remembers the wind, remembers how agonizing it was until finally it died down, only to start up again as soon as he’d left Steve.  But as he feels it blowing into his face now, constant and overbearing, it suddenly occurs to him that the wind had never really died down at all.
He didn't bring up the altercation between himself and Tony's Pa, not really.  He only mentioned it briefly to provide context to the rest of what he wanted to say, because the things Tony's Pa had screamed at him were wrong and therefore not worth repeating.  What
“Oh, God,” he croaked, immediately squeezing his eyes shut again and looking away.  No.  This wasn’t happening.  He’d been good, he thought.  He’d done everything right.  He’d put the gem back where it belonged.  He’d been willing to put himself on the line to save Steve.  Apparently, though, that hadn’t been enough, and now it was too late.  Steve was gone, and Tony would have to live with what he’d done for the rest of his life.
But Steve was in trouble, if the concerned operators tracking the plane were anything to go by.  Something was wrong with the controls, and that was why he'd needed Tony's help, so he could talk him through how to land the plane safely, because right now it was booby trapped and damaged and he couldn't just risk attempting something on his own.  But the initial request had been frantic and rushed, with the consensus being that there was someone else on the plane with Steve, trying to take it down, and so Steve had been silent, presumably preoccupied with fighting whoever it was.
, and Tony watched in horror as he managed to get a hold of one of the drone's wings, holding on as tight as he could.
“I think we should have our first date in the poppy reserve,” Steve says, surprising Tony.  He reaches out and takes Tony’s hand, squeezing it gently.  “I don’t know.  It’s… it’s a nice place, and we haven’t been there for ages.  And it makes me think of you.”
?” Sunset repeats, eyes flashing.  “How do you expect me to do that, when—when you likely are going to see him again?”
Tony cast a helpless glance Cap's way—as predicted, one of the planes was diverting, going after Cap instead.  There was nothing he could do about it right now, not with Rhodey, Pepper, and Jarvis all in the mix.  "Change course, then!"
The faceplate slides off, and they spend the next few minutes just staring at each other as Tony feels his own anger start to drain away.  He badly wants to say something—to apologize after all—but he feels like maybe Steve should talk first.
Jessica considered it.  "There… might be medical supplies in Burnside's office," she said after a moment.  "It's not so far from where we came in."
“I don’t know,” Tony admitted, tongue loose at the discovery.  But it didn’t matter.  It was something.  “Whatever it is, it’s big.  Come on.”  He took off, ignoring the wheeze in his lungs as they pressed up against his ribcage, far too excited to care about the pain.
The answer was apparently Ty, Steve learned as he found and sat down across from him at one of the tables.  He peered over at his tray. "That's barely anything," he said. It looked like a bowl of milk with a bunch of… colorful tiny donuts floating in it.  Cereal?
It’s not easy.  Steve is mostly lying down, because sitting upright would mess with the weight distribution too much, and Tony’s shoulder is kind enough to give him hell—he has to bite the inside of his cheek to stop himself from crying out.  Slowly but surely, though, Steve pulls him out of the water, and Tony reaches out with his bad arm to push himself up the rest of the way.  Finally, he’s lying there on the raft, gasping from the pain and the cold and the
Steve thought again about how much time he'd wasted on anger, and, worse, how much time he'd wasted on anger for a man who hadn't deserved nearly as much of it as Steve had felt.  "It wasn't that funny to me."
“Just enjoying the evening outside,” Tony says lightly, as though the past fifteen minutes had never happened.  He turns back to Steve, hoping he also won’t mention a thing.  “Steve, this is Sunset Bain.  My… fiancée.  Sunset, this is Steve Rogers.”
“Fuck,” Tony pants as he slumps forward, making what looks like a token attempt to stay upright before just collapsing on top of Steve with a grunt.  “Oh, wow, you’re comfortable.  Okay, I’m just going to lie here for a good long while.  Alright?”
So he read on.  Sarah went from questioning her feelings to longing as she seemed to admit to herself how she felt, as Joseph's replies became increasingly dark:
, and yet he’s actually spending time with him… some kid from Brooklyn who could never afford university, much less attend one.  They’re still holding hands, and he wonders if Tony is aware of this.  “I wonder if there are dolphins here.”
"I'm stroking your hair," Cap said.  He looked—thoughtful, it seemed, which was kind of a strange expression in this context.  "That's what we do to people who are sick or hurt."
Tony groaned, eyes shutting again.  He needed to check on Rogers, but he’d do that in a bit.  For now, though, he was realizing that the crushing pain in his chest was gone.  Sure, there were the wounds left from the sabretooth battle earlier, but that was practically nothing in comparison.  What had changed?  He reached up, touching his chest… and then he realized something was different.  His eyes flying open, he blindly grabbed for the flashlight, picking it up and shining it on himself as he fumbled one-handedly with the buttons of his shirt.
Tony's eyes went wide, and he immediately sat up in Steve's arms so he could rummage through his pack, pulling out the smoke bombs and firecrackers.  "Get ready," he said, and then he set off the first one and dropped it onto the ground next to the floor.
And then Steve turns around, and his smile is so dazzling Tony doesn’t see the need for light anymore.  “Hey,” he says, and the smile doesn’t waver one bit as he reaches out, touching Tony’s cheek.  “Feels like I’ve waited here for you forever.”
"We should find bikes eventually," Stark said once they'd been on the road for a few hours.  The land around them was flat, albeit covered with snow, and visibility was clear.  "Not right now, obviously, since they'd be useless.  But once we're somewhere with less snow, that's the first thing we should look for.  Nothing's better than traveling by bike when the world's ended."
“Hold on,” he gasped, reaching out to steady himself against the wall.  “I need… ow… I need a moment.”  His heart seemed to be… throbbing, somehow.  But how was this possible?  The charge was low, sure, but his heart wasn’t supposed to give out until it actually reached zero.  Oh, this could be bad.
Tony managed a weak laugh.  "A shit ton of things happened," he said.  The smile faded from his face as he continued, "You… passed out.  I was terrified you were going to turn, but I couldn't just… you know.  So I just sat there and waited, and when you didn't do anything I decided to take a chance.  I broke into a car and I put you and Bucky in the back seat, and then I got into the driver's seat and drove.  For a given definition of driving, anyway."  Tony sighed and ran a hand through his hair.  Steve wanted to take this pause to ask about Bucky, but he decided Tony would get to it when he got to it.  "Gasoline degrades over time.  It's why I never suggested driving, because it doesn't work.  The car was slow as molasses and it was weeping the whole time because it was running on disgusting oxidized gas.  But it moved, and that was the important part."
?  Best to stay focused.  With that, he bites his lip and continues forward, heading into the other adjacent room, looking around.  He then repeats this with the next room in the hallway, again and again and again, and God, how is it possible that there’s nothing in any of these rooms that can help him?
Right, Rogers.  Great, now he’d have to deal with him again.  Well, nothing for it, he supposed, and so he stuck the stone into his pocket, trying to keep the bitter disappointment off his face as he turned back toward the entrance.  “You can relax now,” he said, resigned.  He’d been sure this was the answer to the problem of his heart somehow, even though he’d had no direct proof that this gem was the powerful glowing circle from the drawings.  But like everything else, it was nothing more than a false hope.
Steve accepted the clothes gratefully, turning away to pull them on.  “So,” he said, his back to Tony.  “Unless I completely lost track of time, we have to be someplace by noon today.  You know.  Unless you want to stay here for the rest of your life.”
And maybe, just maybe, Tony was a little bit jealous.  He was still young, still healthy, except for the very major problem that was his heart, ticking ever so closer to an end that would come sooner rather than later—his one, single flaw.  But here was Steve Rogers, the War’s other all-American hero, and he was fit as a fiddle and as perfect as anyone could be.  And now—well.  Now
"I'll keep watch," Cap offered.  "You three have done this before.  I think you'll have a better eye for it."
The media is waiting for them as soon as the ship docks.  They have their cameras and their lights and their never-ending questions, and Tony decides he’ll have none of it.  Blanket still wrapped tight around himself, he worms his way into a crowd full of steerage and gets off with them, praying the reporters will avoid him in favor of the wealthy elites.  Sunset.  His father.
“Oh, God,” Tony whispers, voice cracking, and he gives his shoulder one more shake, like maybe this will somehow help, but it doesn’t, of course it doesn’t.  Steve is gone.  After everything that’s happened, after everything Tony’s done to try and keep Steve alive, because dammit, the world needs more people like him—this is how fate decides to reward them.  Spare Tony, but kill the kindest, noblest, most amazing man he’s ever known.
understand why Tony brought them to such a quiet, secluded place.  “If you’d like to start, I, um… I won’t stop you.”
He didn’t have much time.  Steve bucked, trying to throw him off as he turned and snapped his jaws, his teeth coming dangerously close.  Through some miracle, Tony managed to hang on, ignoring the searing pain in his arm as he turned around, grabbing the shield.
“Markings look familiar,” Tony said, gladly latching onto the new topic and making out the pattern of stripes he’d committed to memory after that one time he’d realized he couldn’t distinguish Steve from other sabretooths.  “Sorry, but that’s gross.”
“Maybe,” Rogers conceded, though he didn’t sound nearly as excited as Tony felt.  “Personally, I’m wondering why the city is empty.  You sure it’s a good idea to just waltz on in?”
“Oh, God,” Tony breathes into his hands, and no matter how many times he weeps over Steve Rogers and thinks it’ll be the last time, he’s wrong, he’s always, always wrong.
Tony didn't answer.  Instead, he unwrapped one arm from around himself, slipping it around Steve in return, and together they held on for dear life.
“Disgusting,” Howard hisses.  He opens his mouth again, like he’s going to say more, but then the door opens, and Sunset steps in.  She’s holding something in her arms—Jesus Christ, are those
Steve blinked and glanced at Stark, who lowered his weapon.  "Yes," he said, looking back at the two strangers.
Tony gasped, eyes snapping open as he jolted backward, bumping his head against the pedestal and cursing softly in pain.  For a moment, he could see nothing but a dizzying array of colors, but then things settled a little, and he could make out the sabretooth, which was… moving?  Had it just spoke?
Tony squeezed his eyes shut, the pain from his recent torture receding as something worse settled in.  "Me," he said quietly. "He was trying to save me."
Tony tried to remember the actual planes that corresponded to the reporting names Pepper was giving him as he shoved the stone that had covered the entrance to the tomb back into place.  A Jean was a bomber used by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service—Pepper was probably right; they weren't going to be flying around in central China.  "Okay," he said.  "A Perry.  It's a fighter plane.  Comes with two forward-firing Type 89 machine guns."
There was nothing for it.  Without another word, Steve scooped Tony up into his arms, and then—he ran.
Damn it.  Well, there was nothing Tony could do about it now.  He sighed, reaching over to grab Steve's watch to figure out how much time he had before he had to go off to his delivery job.
Tony beamed at him, curling up close.  His expression sobered a few seconds later, though, as he looked up at him.  "What is this?" he said.  "I mean… you kissed me, and now you're here.  I know you said you weren't angry anymore, but friendship and… this are different things.  What if we hurt each other again, Steve?"
Tony brought up his hands once more, but with the sabretooth moving around so much and the limited space he had from his position inside the igloo, he couldn’t get a clear shot.  “Dammit,” he muttered, considering his options for a moment before ducking his head and running out, leaving the safety of the igloo.  “To your left!” he called, and shot again as Rogers somersaulted away.
"I wish.  No, we only made it a few miles before it gave out completely.  By then there was a crowd of biters following us because of all the sputtering.  Too many for me to deal with."  Tony glanced at the door of their room, which was closed.  "But then Natasha came out of nowhere—I think she must have been keeping watch and saw us approaching.  She was riding a damned gurney.  And she took out enough of the biters so that I could get out and help her get rid of the rest."
"Alright," Stark said, taking a seat across from him.  "You have questions.  I have answers.  What do you want to know about first?"
Still hardly able to believe it all, Tony went about replacing the uniform where he'd found it when he realized - the pockets weren't empty.  With another glance around, Tony checked all the pockets he could find, pulling out folded sheets of paper from most of them. There weren't many, so Tony went about ordering them to the best of his ability, then stared down at the first page, which looked like it was a cover sheet.
Tony looked at him, realized Steve was looking back, and then quickly glanced away.  "Soviet spies say funny things, huh?"
, and Steve quieted automatically, finding himself meeting Stark's gaze when the other man turned back to look at him.  He looked older, Steve realized.  Much older than he had when Steve had last seen him.  "I'll explain everything.  Soon."
They charged in, Steve flinging his shield so that they would strike the biters furthest from them as Tony handled the ones that were closer.  A few of them peeled away from the car and started lumbering toward them, though for better or for worse, the woman's continued screams kept many of them distracted.  Steve barreled through them, vaulting over the car so he could strike out the ones that seemed to be closest to getting inside.  One of them grabbed him unexpectedly from behind, but he was able to duck before it bit him—just because he knew a bite wasn't fatal for him now didn't mean he was particularly eager to repeat the experience.
"What does it look like I'm doing?"  Steve took a deep breath and went over to Bucky's body.  The shovel was still sticking out of his face.  He knelt down, searching his pockets, and came up with a photo of Natasha.  Jesus.  So was this relationship between Bucky and Natasha mutual?  But why hadn't he known if Bucky hadn't actually died?
Finally, though, he forced himself to open his eyes again, gaze landing once more on the paw just barely in his field of vision.  Even if he didn’t go anywhere, even if Steve-as-a-sabretooth was still alive and interested in eating him, he just… he had to say something.  So slowly, he reached out, laying one hand lightly against the paw, fearing he’d wake him up but needing to make some sort of contact, and then he let his eyes flutter shut once more, taking a deep, shuddering breath.
He’s already in his sleepwear that evening when Sunset lets herself into his room, looking around and frowning.  “I see that you once again have no plans to invite me to your bed tonight,” she says, sounding testy as she picks up a small object from his desk, prodding it.  “What is this, a turbine?  Did you make this after dinner?”
"Working on it," Tony replied briskly.  He clapped his hands together, then looked around.  "So, as all of you know, we've been cleared—by the
"Thanks, J," Tony replied before turning his attention back to Captain America, who Tony had decided to start calling "Cap" in his head.  "Captain America" was such a mouthful.  "So," he said, "are you really going to be wearing that cowl and costume the whole time?  Don't we get the right to know who you really are?"
"Human sacrifice?" Pepper suggested.  "This place is loaded with grave goods.  The guy buried here must have been important."
He groaned, putting his hands over his eyes and waiting for the dizziness to pass.  Maybe the trauma of killing Steve had driven him crazy, because he was pretty sure sabretooths didn’t talk with Steve’s voice in real life.
“No one?”  Tony thinks of himself, so foolishly baring his wrist to Sunset, who used it to her own advantage all those years ago.  He thinks of Rhodey, sharing Tony’s own frustration as he baffled over a line from an obscure poem as they studied together in the library at MIT, wondering what the two of them did wrong to get such vague words.  He thinks of Jan, showing her wrist to all her teammates in order to make one of them see what’s right in front of him.
Steve had apparently just done a fine job of putting his foot in his mouth.  "Oh," he said.  He hesitated, then added, "I'm sorry I assumed, Tony."
They were running out of time.  Steve gripped the pistol, raising it and pointing it at Tony's head, forcing his hands not to shake.  Tony was still looking at him, and the sorrow and trust and love in his eyes was almost overwhelming.  Steve couldn't let him down.  "Always, sweetheart," he said.
He took a few deep breaths, trying to ground himself.  A dream, he thought. A dream where he was a boy named Tony.
She trailed off.  Steve followed her gaze and understood why—the floor wasn't exactly in the cleanest of states, not after he and Stark had come in, anyway, but there was unmistakably a trail of blood that led into the room.
They were both out of their minds.  There was no other explanation for it, because how could anyone actually think the biters were a blessing?  Steve had to find Tony and get them out of here before things became worse than they already were.   "I won't let this happen," he said.
Tony hesitated, thinking about it.  Saying that it was just his gut wasn't good enough.  He needed more.  "He was old," he said at last.  "And… he wasn't in a uniform.  So he wasn't a grunt."
So, home.  Except apparently the universe had some other plans for him first, because once he'd left the building and got onto the main street he felt a tap on his shoulder.  He turned around and - it was Dougie. Of course it was Dougie.
He closed his eyes and sighed.  No, that wasn't true. Here in this life there was Tony, and Tony mattered.  And Steve - Steve needed to make sure that Tony knew that.
When Tony comes to in a washed-out hospital room, Maya and Sal are there, telling him what happened in the aftermath and assuring him that none of this was his fault as Steve hovers anxiously outside.  Tony accepts their reassurances as best he can—that is, not particularly well at all—and goes back to sleep, not because his body needs it, but because his mind does.  He might not have been the one who decided to kill a bunch of people with his suits, but their blood is on his hands anyway.
“Yeah,” Tony replies, committing Steve’s image to memory as he stands here now, looking noble and beautiful and
Tony leaned over and tugged the sleeve over her foot.  "It's to help your fallen arches," he said. "Don't your feet ache sometimes?"  Tony's sure did, on the days he was Steve. Of course, he ached in many places given the assorted ailments he seemed to have, but this one he could at least do something about.
“Sorry.  I had to time it right.  Listen, Steve, I’m so sorry—I knew they’d be bad, but I didn’t realize just how awful—”
That was unlikely, but Steve saw no point in arguing, going back to the bag.  There actually wasn't much in here—a few cans of what looked like dried milk, fruit, and ravioli, and also a box of dried eggs.  Steve rubbed his forehead.  "Why do you have these things, Stark?" he asked.  He definitely remembered falling into the Atlantic, which meant someone—Stark?—must have fished him out somehow.  The war had been winding down, but… maybe it'd started up again?  "Are we still at war?  Are we in Europe?"
.  Can anyone ever truly be prepared to die?  Maybe some people can, he supposes.  But not him.  There’s still so much he wants to see, so much he wants to do.  He’d been planning on visiting his mother’s grave, maybe go check in on some of his friends.  And then he’d wanted to travel across the country, from New York to California.  He’d wanted to live his life.
"Call it a change of heart," Natasha said, smiling back, though it soon faded.  "I learned that there are some things that don't matter… and some things that do.  Goodness matters.  Love matters."  Her gaze shifted and went distant.  "I don't want to lose sight of that."
But that was future Tony's problem to mope over.  For now, Tony would enjoy this connection they had, strange though it was.
The second time he comes around, it’s just Steve in the room, dozing quietly as one of his hands holds onto Tony’s own.  But Steve must have been sleeping lightly and listening for the sounds of Tony’s breathing to change, because in the next second, he’s up too—and Tony almost never has a reason to think this, but right now, Steve really does look awful, face pale and eyes rimmed with red.
Rhodey tsked softly.  "It can't be worse than the time we mounted an expedition because of a trap planted by your ex-girlfriend who was also a Nazi sympathizer," he mused.  "It's enough to go on."
Steve nods, and he places his hand against Tony’s shoulder, studying the crease lines around his eyes and lips when he smiles.  Tony really should do that more often.
“Tony!” he hears; Steve is moving his arm, and everything momentarily vanishes in a flash of pain.  “Jesus, you’re bleeding—”
"Okay," Pepper replied.  "I'm gonna see what can be done to secure the rest of the ship, because we're going to need a way off and you can't carry all of us.  Good luck, Tony."  She placed a hand against one gauntleted arm, then nodded, stepped to the side, and broke out into a run again.  Tony watched her go, then remembered his own tasks.
The girl in class who'd kept looking back at him?  She was doing so because he'd somehow managed to successfully pull off flirting with her.  (
Panicking, Steve mashed on the "Back" key until he was back to the original list of rows, the sinful contents of HARD_DATA hidden once more.  "Okay," he said out loud to himself afterward, cheeks flushing even though he was alone. That - that had been something. Part of him wanted to quickly shove the strange black box back into the drawer from where it came, but the other part of him was still curious.  There was more on here to explore than just HARD_DATA. And besides, this was all still just a dream, right? What did any of it matter?
He was about to keep running anyway when he spotted a fire escape ladder that went up the side of the building, carrying Tony over before realizing that there was no way to get them both up there—not unless Tony wanted it.  "Hey, Tony," he said as he set him down against the building, placing his hands against his shoulder.  "Tony.  You with me?"
up, well, that seemed as good a price to pay as any.  After all, their country was recovering from a war.  They needed someone like Captain America, like Steve, to guide them.  But Tony?  He’d done his part.  He could—he could rest easy.
Tony groaned.  Honestly, Rogers did have a point, even if Tony didn’t want to admit it.  22%... it could last them until noon tomorrow,
It took another hour, but eventually they found another tunnel leading outward, and Rogers picked up the pace as Tony squeezed his eyes shut and gripped at him harder.  “Easy, big guy,” he managed, though he might as well have said nothing for all Rogers paid attention to him.  But then they stopped abruptly, and Tony opened his eyes to see what the problem was.
There was a pause, and for a moment Tony was hopeful Cap was going to give in.  Only a moment, though.  "…'Cap'?" Cap repeated, his lips quirking up in a tiny smile.  Tony thought it might have been the first one he'd seen from Cap so far, though admittedly there wasn't much to smile about in their previous interactions, since it had mostly involved Tony reiterating once again his findings about the oracle bone inscriptions.
"Of course," Cap agreed, but he was frowning.  "But let's not forget you're still hurt.  Even worse now, in fact.  Your arm started bleeding again and you're on steroids now for the poison ivy."
And now he was feeling his eyes get wet again and he didn't want to ruin Steve's journal and he didn't think he could read anything more at this time anyway, so maybe it was time to just take a little break from this.  He shut the journal and put it back on the nightstand, then made himself get out of bed, even if he just wanted to curl up under the sheets and let his brain get away from him.
Steve glances down at himself and shrugs, giving him a little smile.  “No big deal.  It’s only a flesh wound.”
None of them said a thing as the coffin was lowered.  Steve suspected that Natasha's memories of him were too private to share with the two of them, and if he was being honest, Steve felt the same way about his own memories.  So they laid him to rest in silence, each tossing in a handful of dirt before burying him in earnest.
Steve looked at him, eyes wide, his gaze flickering between Tony’s own and the mass of gauze wrapped around his arm.  Then, without further ado, he opened his mouth.
With that, he took a running start, then leapt across the ravine, gripping on for dear life.  As always, there was that terrible feeling in his gut halfway through that oh God, the vine would break and drop him in and then he’d be in really big trouble, but it held, and in seconds he was safely on the other side, turning to look back at Rogers, who looked mildly impressed.  Huh.  How about that?
"Captain America," he tried, even though he knew that if Steve had said he couldn't receive, then he couldn't receive, but he didn't want to believe it.  "Cap, I'm here.  Can you hear me?"
Carol levels her gaze at him, eyes hard.  “I think you do,” she says after sizing him up.  “And I think you two need to talk.”
That earned him a knowing grin from Ty.  Tony was glad Ty hadn't called him out on the fact that he hadn't been doing much "managing" in the past few months.  He didn't have a very good excuse for it that didn't involve telling Ty about Steve, which was definitely out of the question.  "Then I'm calling my ride. See you later."
Tony went quiet after that, no longer trying to pull away from Steve's loose grip.  A few minutes later, though, he finally spoke up.  "…Thanks," he said, his voice soft.  "I mean… I don't… I don't know if I really believe you yet, but I appreciate that you actually said those things.  I don't think I ever expected that out of you."
He found himself thinking, stupidly, of his dog.  He'd had one once, a long time ago. Her name was Aero (short for Aerodynamic) and he loved her very much.  But the problem with Aero - the problem with dogs in general, honestly - was that they just didn't live long enough.  So she'd gone to the rainbow bridge and when Mom had told his ten-year-old self as much, he'd reacted by starting to cry.
There was no coherent response.  Steve looked behind him and saw the biters again, even closer this time.  "You wanna die here?" he snapped, needing some way,
The recording ended, and Tony was brought back to the list of all his voicelogs, the three from - from Steve sitting at the top.  Tony just sat there on his bed and stared at them, his brain trying to make sense out of everything that had happened.
He didn't even have time to wonder about it.  "Nothing's stopping me," he hissed in return, elbowing him in the head.  Tem jerked away, stunned, but he was surprisingly resilient, bouncing back and hitting the ring again, and Steve felt a searing heat graze his cheek.
Steve brushed his thumb just under where Tony's name was written in pencil, smiling a bit.  For a single day, he'd touched someone else's life across time, and someone else had touched his.  Maybe the planets had aligned just right. Maybe some adventurer had activated some mystical relic in the hidden depths of an ancient ruin.  Maybe the science just hadn't been discovered yet. Whatever the reason, it had happened, and he would cherish the memory.
"Some service," Tony muttered.  When Steve looked to him for an explanation, he continued, "After the war, we heard rumors that the Soviets had trained these… super spies and sent them to China and the U.S. to infiltrate the government and other places of interest.  They were supposed to be beautiful, deadly women… hence the moniker 'Black Widow'."  Steve tightened his grip on the woman—Natasha—at that, but she still didn't seem interested in putting up a fight.  Didn't hurt to be careful, though.  "And it looks like we've managed to stumble upon one now.  But—" Tony paused, plucking the papers out of Natasha's hand—"no harm done.  We don't want to fight you, Natasha.  So we'll go and you can stay here at the hospital.  How's that sound?"
"Ah," said Cap, and was it just Tony, or did he suddenly look a little nervous?  "Well.  Maybe I was just trying to get you off of Fury's back."
Once he was done, Tony turned back to the other man, who appeared to have finished some time ago.  “Ready?” Rogers asked.  Tony nodded, and so Rogers turned on the flashlight and put out the fire, then ducked out of the igloo, Tony following.  “Smell that?” Rogers said, his nose wrinkling in the dim light.
Despite the fact that they were rushing to what was increasingly looking like a large aircraft carrier in the middle of the water that was also definitely on fire, Tony had to laugh at Cap's obvious glee.  "You like that?" he called back.
turn to feel pleased.  If the night goes the way he hopes it will, there’ll be a lot more charcoal handprints on Tony by dawn.  “You’re the patron,” he says, settling back down in the chair and picking up his pencil.
The awful, self-centered part of him tells himself that this is actually good news.  The weight of Steve’s death has been crushing him for days, weeks, months now, and it would be such a relief for it to disappear, if only until his rebooted self reads the news again.  But the weight
"Is it?" Steve asked dubiously, opening up one box to find a whole selection of MREs.  "Sounds like they gave up their liberty for safety, and in the end they didn't even get that."
Natasha's lips quirked upward.  "No," she agreed.  "I hope this isn't the last time we see each other."
because of my adventures.  If I'd stayed put, nothing bad would have happened to them.  Not by my hand, at least.  I wanted to extend my life, and I cost the lives of others in the process."  He sighed.  "So.  Back to being lucky with my reactor.  I stopped having to constantly recharge both myself and the suit and no one else had to get hurt."  His fingers tapped against his chest idly.  "The thing is, the reactor's not a cure."
And yet somehow, Steve manages to worm his way into Tony’s heart anyway.  He’ll send Tony emails sometimes, usually about what the team’s been up to or about a great new diner he discovered that serves the perfect apple pie (and adding that next time Tony’s in town, they should really go eat there).  Sometimes the emails will have links to search engines displaying the results for when he searches the Avengers and wants to show them off for whatever reason.  (
Soup forgotten for the time being, Tony rose from his chair, starting to poke around the more obvious places in Steve's room - under the pillow, in his drawers, under the mattress.  Nothing. So then he tried some other places - leafing through Steve's drawing pad, rummaging in some boxes of dried food, even taking apart a framed photo of Ma in case he'd hidden something behind the picture.  Still nothing.
Unfortunately, he didn’t see any other choice, and Steve—or whoever it was—was getting further and further away with each passing second.  “Steve!” he hissed.
He stepped into the igloo, but was promptly stopped when Rogers reached out, grabbing his arm.  “Don’t do this, Tony,” he said.  “It could be dangerous.”
"So one day a man approached us.  He'd known who I was from before everything happened, and he'd heard I was here.  His name was Reed Richards.  Recognize it?  You probably don't.  One of the best scientific minds of our time.  Anyway—he said he'd heard that one of the NMI labs—sorry, the National Microbiological Institute—one of those labs was still operational, the one in Bethesda.  And if we could get there, maybe we could work on a cure.  So Rhodey went with him to the lab, to keep him safe, and I—I located Namor.  He took me to sea, and there… I actually found you."  Stark paused, and there was the tiniest of smiles on his face.  "I thought if anyone's blood could hold the key to a cure, it would be yours.  You being alive was an unexpected twist, but it was just icing on the cake."
Tony leaned into the touch, his eyes watery as he gazed up at him.  "Thank you," he managed, voice cracking.
"Because the other member of my group caught polio from you Americans," Natasha said angrily.  "I can't leave her for extended periods of time to search.  I have to watch over her."
It didn't.  And it was funny - for a given definition of funny - because Tony had confronted death before, and he'd even welcomed it, hoped for it.  But of course, there had been Steve that time, Steve's life that had been on the line, and now, for reasons Tony would never forget - there wasn't.
He looks at his father.  Howard will be safe, and he’d cared enough to save Tony as well.  That’s enough for him.  No matter how much they might despise each other at times, Howard is still his father, and Tony is still his son.
Sometime between the rescue and dawn, another ship comes, and they are brought on board.  He is passed off onto a doctor, who hisses and fusses over his shoulder, eventually managing to remove the bullet after several long, agonizing minutes, but Tony doesn’t cry, doesn’t scream, just grits his teeth and bears the pain.
"It was our pleasure," Tony said.  He eyed the bag she was holding.  "That looks heavy… can you carry all that yourself?"
It was lucky that Steve had frozen in shock, because if he'd reacted differently he probably would have ended up dropping the journal onto his face, lying back in bed the way he was.  Fortunately, his eyes could still move, so he started reading the rest of the entry, hardly able to believe what he was seeing.
For a moment, he entertained the thought of finishing up quickly so he could go and chat up the redhead who lived down the block, part of his unending quest to make Steve happy with a girl.  So Dorothy hadn't worked out, nor had the other girls Tony had tried to set Steve up with - but there were other fish in the sea. It was only for a moment, though, because it occurred to Tony very suddenly that doing exactly what he was doing right now, keeping his mom company while she was sick, was actually what would make Steve happy, and once he'd realized it, it became difficult to rationalize doing anything else.
" he managed.  1954?  That couldn't be.  That would mean he'd been out for over a decade, even though his mental clock had pegged his last meeting with Stark as mere months ago.  It couldn't be.  It
It was.  Ty was in bed with him, shirtless but otherwise clothed.  And on top of that, this wasn't Steve's bed. Well, of course it wasn't Steve's bed, because it was blindingly obvious now that he'd woken up as Tony today.  But it wasn't Tony's bed either. Logic told him it was Ty's bed, but what was he doing in Ty's bed in the first place? Why had he woken up here?
"It's what I would have done if I'd known how bad things had gotten," Tony replied softly.  "I can barely think of it as home anymore.  Everything was changed.  Ruined.  The Bronx is as far as we're going to get, and then we'll be crossing the George Washington Bridge into Jersey.  Don't make me go any deeper into the city."
Tony hesitated.  Great.  Was he really going to have to lie to Captain America?  Sure seemed like it.  Well, fine.  He’d lie.  And if he ended up breaking it, well, what the hell was Rogers going to do about that?  “Yeah, sure.”
Steve reached up, but as soon as their fingers touched another biter lurched out of the darkness, and Steve quickly shoved Tony's hand away, not wanting to risk his arm getting bit.
They’d left that morning, making sure to hide the evidence that indicated that they’d stayed there that night—while they’d yet to encounter anyone else who might be tracking them for whatever reason, it was best not to take any chances.   From there, they’d bickered about which direction to go, because Rogers was apparently wary of perfectly good technology and believed in—Tony didn’t even know.  Aimless exploring, maybe?  But Tony had won the argument, which was for the better, because it was all paying off now.
"You ever been to the Navy Yard before?" Tony asked as the East River came into view, looking as gray as Steve remembered, despite the sunlight reflecting off of it.  At least some things never changed.
He pulled up the command-line interface, typed in a query to display a list of recently-created files, hit enter, waited - and then a single result appeared.
“Tony…” Steve begins weakly.  There’s nothing he can say to that, so he just rests his head against the pole again, gazing at him.  “I—I think the key was silver.  Maybe there’s an extra in the cabinet.”  At his words, Tony whirls around, finding said cabinet and opening it, looking the keys over as Steve continues, “How did you find out I was telling the truth…?”
one here who can get someone all hot and bothered.  “T-too much of that, and the next part is going to be really underwhelming for you.”
It doesn’t matter, he supposes.  The hard drive is what it is and he can’t change anything either way.
"Nice, isn't it?  Locals could be friendlier, though."  When Steve continued to gape at him, Stark just chuckled and shrugged.  "We're lucky Namor even brought us back to land," he said.  "I'm pretty sure he would have been content to toss me overboard and keep you all to himself."
He went over to one side, feeling the walls of the bomb until he reached a latch and undid it.  There was a control panel inside, though he could barely see it in the darkness.
He helped Tony to his feet, only to have him immediately fall over with a soft hiss, eyes squeezing shut in pain.  "Fuck," he breathed.  "My ankle—I think it's sprained again."
Ty started scooping up as many orange loops as he could onto his spoon.  "There's nothing strange about my breakfast," he said. "But
There were so many things he could do with something like this. First things first, though—he’d fix his heart, and then Rogers would never have to be annoying again.
“Believe me, I know,” Steve manages.  He experimentally shifts a little, but he doesn’t think his body is quite up for the movement yet, so he stops and takes a deep breath.  “Yeah.  Give me a moment.”
He just wished he knew what was so important to Steve that he would want to put his life on the line for it.
Steve Rogers was real, a stick of a kid Tony's age, growing up in 1940.  He lived with his mom, went to school on weekdays, and sometimes worked as a janitor on the weekends earning a few cents an hour.  His family was as poor as all get-out and actually ate mayo sandwiches, which tasted as sad as they sounded. There was a bully who occasionally beat him up (and who had apparently gotten over the threat Tony had issued that first time he'd encountered him).  He also was something of a teetotaler, apparently, because at some point Steve had found his booze stash and emptied everything out - thank God it was just the cheap stuff, but it had still been annoying as hell, especially because now he wasn't sure if he would be able to get more without Steve just throwing it out again.  But despite all that, he seemed happy enough, if tired, and he read and drew and followed baseball on the radio.
,” Tony practically purrs, and he leans down, starting to press soft kisses to his jaw and neck.  “You’re really gorgeous,” he continues, running his hands down his arms.  “I’ve told you that already, right?  Because you are.”
Privately, he had to give himself negative marks for imagination.  More than fifty years into the future, and the best he could come up with was a screen connected to a typewriter?  It was certainly intriguing, but he'd thought that there'd be… more. For one, surely these screens could stand to be bigger, and maybe actually show color.  And he'd kind of hoped there would be mechanized cleaning machines that could roll or fly everywhere, and he hadn't seen a single one of those.
The shield skidded to the ground a few feet away.  Steve stared at it, at the formerly metallic sheen now covered in dark muck that Steve wasn't even sure was blood—but that didn't matter.  What did matter was Tony kneeling in the dirt, his face paler than Steve had ever saw it.  Steve turned away from the shield, rushing over to his side and getting onto his knees as well, taking Tony's arms.  "Are you okay?" he asked again, inspecting the wrist with the missing sleeve.  It… looked okay, but Steve needed to hear it from him.
"Here we are," Tony agreed.  He still didn't know what was happening, but there were two things that were clear: one, that Birch was clearly not right in the head, and two, that it was definitely dangerous for him to have all these weapons.  "I'm not particularly interested in being ruined, so I think we'd better end this now.  Cap?"
"I wish it was just a herd," Luke muttered, shaking his head.  "It's a community a few miles south of here, holed up inside a school.  Run by a guy named Burnside."  He frowned at Steve.  "Looks a lot like you."
There was a long pause.  "Sleep well, sunshine boy," the woman whispered at last, and then she closed the door all the way, leaving Tony in the dark.
But now - now it suddenly seemed like the impossible was possible.  The past was maybe mutable. History could be changed. Was it right?  Tony didn't know. He didn't want to think about it too much. One thing he was certain about, though - there was no way he could say nothing and let Steve just die.
"He told me he was going to the Navy Yard," she replied.  "Something must have happened to him there."
They stare at each other.  Finally, Carol huffs and crosses her arms.  “You haven’t spent time in person with Steve in a decade.  And no, joining us to fight off Galactus once a year doesn’t count.  He misses you, Tony.  It’s obvious to anyone with eyes.  Even more obvious when he comes up to me at least once a week and mopes about how his best pal is ignoring him, which is really awkward when I know you still find the time to take
"What are you doing?" Tony's Pa had asked, and though his voice wasn't slurred, there was enough of an edge to make Steve tense.
Tony considered telling them to get the hell out of here, but he knew that look in Pepper's eyes, and arguing with them was only going to waste more time.  "Okay," he said quickly as he slid the gauntlet onto one arm.  "I need to supercharge this thing, enough for it to actually hurt the plane.  Pepper, you're gonna have to hold the wire up to the orichalcum in my chest.  The part you'll be holding will be insulated, so you'll be fine, but you can't break contact.  Rhodey, I'm going to need your support.  The plane is high and this thing is heavy.  I'm going to rest my arm on your shoulder and you're going to help me aim."
Tony automatically looked back at Birch, half-wondering why he hadn't started shooting at them again.  Birch's head was lolled forward and he was no longer moving, and it dawned on Tony that he was dead.  Either from his sickness or from the shock; Tony didn't know.  It didn't matter.  It was done.
“Hey,” Steve says, prodding his head and tilting it back upward again.  “Don’t ruin the pose.  And don’t worry.  I won’t draw it.”
"Tony," Cap said.  His gaze was sharp now, focused entirely on him, as though Birch was no longer in the room.  "We can make it through this.  Do you trust me?"
"Tony!" he cried, but saying his name wasn't going to accomplish anything, so he acted—one swipe of his shield took out the man at the entrance, and then he was hauling Tony over his shoulder, shield cutting through the air to take out the man who'd shot at them.  The man fell over, and once Steve had caught his shield again he turned to try and figure out the door—there was some sort of mechanism involved, and he couldn't just push or pry it open.  Damn it.  If Tony had been the conscious one they'd have been out by now.
Steve stares at him for a moment, and in the silence Tony can’t help but fear that he said something wrong.  “I know,” he says at last, and for some reason, his hand strays down to rub at the wrist with the watch on it.  “Tony… that was what I wanted to talk about, actually.  Making things right.  Between us.”
He stops cold, causing Steve to stumble when he tries to move without him, backing away a few steps and shaking his head.  “We have to go back,” Tony says.
There’s… something in his voice that Tony can’t quite make out.  A faint note of pleading, and… something else.  He’s not sure what, but he’s hardly about to deny him.  “Yeah,” he says.  “W-we’ll go together.”
"Can't," he finally made himself reply.  Now for an excuse. "Uh, I got caught in gov class working on bot stuff.  Have to write a remedial essay tonight."
, Tony realized with a jolt.  In their short time together, Tony had never heard Cap sound this way before.  He could barely even comprehend the idea that Cap
Instead, he spent the day exploring.  He limited himself to areas that he was obviously allowed to be in - maybe if he woke up as Tony a few more times in this house later on he'd be more adventurous, but for now there was more than enough to keep him occupied.  Without classes to take up his time, he was free to spend an almost embarrassing amount of time running around in the massive backyard, enjoying the fact that he could breathe freely and move without all his limbs getting sore.  He could even inspect the multitudes of flowers and other plants in the garden (whoever managed it sure liked lavender, it seemed) without sneezing
Surely, he thought, it didn't mean what it sounded like it meant.  Ma had been sick often, it was true. But had it really gotten that bad?  Steve would have written about it earlier if it had, right?
Tony squinted over at Cap.  Partly out of suspicion, and partly out of a lack of desire to keep his eyes opened all the way.  "Like you knew," he accused.  "How sleepy it makes me feel."
And so Jan and Hank retreat back into the quinjet as Tony leans forward, resting his head against the glass surface of Steve’s coffin and ignoring how cold it is.  It’s almost ridiculous, he thinks, how much time he’s spent alone with Steve since his death, and yet he keeps on requesting
him?  Because Steve thought if he stuck around, he was just going to hurt him again?  Please.  Tony had survived much worse.  But
Tony shook his head.  "Don't start with that," he said, pulling the gauze away.  Steve could hear him swallowing as he stared down at Steve's neck.  "Just stay with me."
worth it, Steve is the reason he would actually mind dying on this ship tonight—and he pulls one arm back and punches his father square in the jaw, sending him reeling.  He stands there afterward, panting harshly as he watches Howard disbelievingly reach up and touch his face, wiping the spittle away from his mouth.  He doesn’t regret it at all.  “This is my life,” he tells him.  “And if I think he’s worth it, then he is.”
?  Belatedly, he realized he had no idea what they were supposed to do once they got here.  A part of him had hoped that they’d haul their asses up here and then everything would be magically okay, but thinking about it, of course it wasn’t going to be that easy.  It never was.
Steve exhaled softly, curling around Tony in return.  He'd missed this.  The warmth.  The closeness.  "If we hurt each other, it'll happen regardless of whether we kiss each other or not," he said.  "So we might as well kiss."
"Only one way to find out," Tony said.  It wasn't as though they could call up the Nazis and ask politely—he certainly didn't want them to be lying in wait for them to land.  He was still trying to figure out why there was Japanese aircraft in Yinxu, and, more importantly, who had sent them.  "Where are the other two fragments, by the way?  Did anyone put them together yet?"
Steve glanced at Tony, who hesitated, then nodded.  He looked as uncertain as Steve felt.  Who needed full names these days?  The temptation to lie was strong, but he got the feeling—and he thought Tony did too—that she'd know if they were lying.  His shield already made it obvious who he was, anyway.  "Steve Rogers," he said.  "And Tony Stark."
He closed his eyes, but instead of falling asleep, he found himself opening them again after just a few minutes, peering at Steve in the darkness.  “Hey, Steve?” he asked.  Steve made a soft questioning sound in response, so Tony continued, “We’re going to make it in time, Steve.  By this time tomorrow, we’ll be at the top, and you’ll be human again.  Alright?”
"Not our own transport, anyway," Tony said, clapping his hands.  "So there's going to be a lot of improv, probably.  You up for that, Cap?"
“Steve?” Tony said, bolting upright as he poked his head out of the cave.  Nothing.  He turned to look at the remains of the deer, which seemed… recently eaten?  He couldn’t tell.  But if that gooey stuff there was saliva, then yeah, it was recent.  Also disgusting.
“I…” Tony begins, but he has no defense.  He should have listened to his father.  He never should have let Steve so close.
"Come on, we'll be late for practice if you don't get up soon," continued the voice.  "I have coffee."
Cap leveled a glare at him.  "I'm spraying it now," he said, then actually did so.  Tony winced as he felt it, his toes curling and his fingers clenching, but he managed to refrain from making any sound.  "You okay?"
“I won’t,” Steve says with a startled laugh.  He reaches out to gently take hold of Tony’s wrist, and as he does, Tony feels a strange surge of warmth spread through him.  “I didn’t know that, Tony.  I thought you wanted to be alone.”
Sharon finds Tony later, furious at him for sneaking Steve’s body out of the hospital without telling her—and like most of the world, she, too, blames Tony for his death, and perhaps rightly so.  Somewhat more composed now—on the outside, at least—he manages to calm her down enough to show her what’s happened to Steve’s body, which is now suddenly, unexpectedly back to its pre-serum self.  Her fury, however, starts up again almost seconds later as she rounds on him, looking murderous.  “What did you
it seemed like it took a lot more to get him winded - and he was able to navigate cones and hurdles without too much issue.
Reluctantly, Tony leaned forward, attention on the section for Monday, May 29th - and saw that it had already been filled in.
Cap made another grab for Tony's hand, and this time he managed to hold on.  Tony hurried to pull him up, cognizant of the fact that they were so close to this ordeal being over—
.  Where’s your sense of adventure?  Besides, think of all the notes you’ll get to take.  Fury’ll want to kiss you once you show him all the things you’ve learned.”
Tony blinks again.  “What?” he manages at last.  Steve’s surrounded by friends and has plenty of things to do.  He doesn’t need to waste time moping.  “I’m not ignoring him.  We email.  Besides, if he wants to see me so badly, he knows where I live.”
?  Tony sighed, plopping down onto the ground.  Fixed heart or not, he really needed to be seated right now.  “Wow,” he said, rubbing his forehead.  “Okay.  Wow.  So you’re a sabretooth now, huh?”  He paused, expecting an answer, then remembered that Rogers couldn’t talk.  “Right.  Well.  First things first… we have to figure out how this happened.  And then we have to figure out how to undo it.”
Rogers made a soft sound in the back of his throat, lips pursing.  “I guess,” he said after a moment before continuing on, though he didn’t sound convinced.  Tony suspected he’d like to stay and check them out more, but was too concerned about the time it would take to actually do it.  Maybe next time.  Well, next time for Rogers, anyway.  Tony was becoming increasingly convinced that there’d be no next time for himself.
“We’ve all made mistakes,” Steve says.  “Tony, it’s all over now.  It happened.  And I still want you on the team.”
Alright, so maybe Tony had done more than just considered it.  He'd thought about it, dreamed about it. But he'd never acted upon it.  Because, really - Steve Rogers? Could there
And then Tony found what he was looking for.  Before him stood the biggest igloo-thing he’d seen down here yet, the entire wall covered with more drawings.  “Look at this,” he breathed, circling it slowly as he shone his light against its surface, Rogers right behind him.  The drawings had fewer sabretooths, but more glowing circles that Tony suspected weren’t supposed to represent the sun.  In one sketch, the stick figures hovered over one of their fallen, the glowing circle held above its body.  In the next, the fallen stick figure was standing again, apparently well.  Another set of drawings showed the glowing circle being used to carve something that looked suspiciously like one of the many igloo-things Tony had seen down here, and still another showed the stick figures prostrating themselves before a mountain, the glowing thing at the top accompanied by what looked like a giant hand.  Okay, so he didn’t really understand that last one, but the others he got readily enough.  Whatever this glowing thing was, it seemed to be pretty damn powerful, acting according to the will of its holder.
Steve is close now, he can tell.  Tony is everywhere he needs to be, each thrust pounding that place inside him that makes him whimper and moan, nails digging into Tony’s skin.  And then the other man’s hand is wrapping itself around his member, stroking him rhythmically, and Steve throws his head back, feeling utterly helpless.  “Tony,” he gasps.  “Tony—”
"You don't have to."  With his free hand, Steve reached down, looking for the rifle—but he found nothing, and he inhaled sharply in panic.  In front of him, Tony looked similarly alarmed, following his gaze.  Without the rifle, what could he use?  How could he make this as painless for Tony as possible otherwise?
Ty gave Steve an odd look.  "You know already," he said.  "Dad does the same stuff as your dad.  Tech stuff."
That was a good point, and Steve nodded, accepting this.  But there were still a few missing pieces.  "I don't understand, though," he said.  "How did everyone get infected in the first place?"
Rogers nodded, assessing the wall before catching his eye and jerking his head.  Taking that to mean he wanted Tony to move, he scooted away from the opening, listening to the sound of Rogers clawing his way up.
Not that Tony was going to believe him anyway, but the redness on his face—visible even despite the cowl—made it clear what the truth was.  "You do," he said.  "Holy shit.  And you of all people had enough clout to join me on this.  That's amazing."
They took a few more steps forward when the ground shook, and Pepper and Rhodey abruptly disappeared from sight at the same time something made a snapping sound, but it was almost lost amidst everyone's startled shouts.  "Rhodey? Pepper?" Tony yelled, running forward—there was a hole in the ground that certainly hadn't been there before, and the two of them were inside, looking dusty but otherwise alive.  Tony let out a sharp exhale of relief.  "You okay?"
Voicing that observation was too much effort, though, and Tony gave up on trying, letting his eyes fall shut instead.  His arm still felt like it was on fire, but then there was a gloved hand against the side of his head, gently petting his hair and making him forget about the pain for a fraction of a second.
“Wait!” Rogers hissed, managing to find his arm and grabbing onto it.  “What are you thinking?  We need a plan!”
getting rest, he wanted to say—ten years' worth of it, in fact—but he held his tongue and nodded instead, though he wasn't even sure if Stark could see him.  What was the point in staying up if they were just going to snipe at each other?  He headed back to the bed he'd been lying in and sighed.  "You get some rest too," he said finally.  Stark had looked like he needed it.
Tony took a deep breath, approaching him again since he seemed his usual, Steve-ish self.  “I guess you haven’t gotten around to watching many movies since the war ended,” he said.  “It’s okay.  I’ll explain later.  It’s just, uh, wow.  You really took that thing down.  Was that you or your… more animal side?”
Something about the way she says those words catches Tony’s attention, and he blinks, glancing back at her.  “Why did you call me, Carol?”
Steve stared at him, but instead of looking amused he just looked more depressed.  “What?” Tony pressed.  “Okay, that wasn’t the best choice in words.  Let me ride you.  Better?”  Steve shook his head again.
"I have a bad feeling about this," Tony muttered, but he nonetheless followed Steve up once they'd found the staircase, the wood creaking with each step they took.
Steve accepts the jacket, looking up into his eyes.  “You’re welcome, Tony.  I’ll see you tomorrow.”
again.  If he’s being honest with himself, their earliest emails were forced and awkward, as was bound to happen when one of them was indirectly responsible for the death of the other.  Now, though, the banter is loose and easy between them, and Tony’s starting to feel like he can confide in Steve about anything.
Eventually, they pull apart—Tony with great reluctance—and look at each other for a long moment.  Tony resists the urge to kiss him.  “Don’t tell anyone until I’m gone,” he says instead.
"Then let me repay the favor," Jessica said.  She glanced back at Steve and Stark.  "You two—you'd help me get her out, right?  Please—"
In response, Fury slid the folder back toward him, fingers drumming the table afterward.  "Hunting for this mystical relic
Tony had no answer, and neither did the rest of the carrier: everything suddenly went very silent, and for a second all Tony could hear was the sound of his own heart beating.
The other guy seemed unbothered, throwing an arm around Tony's shoulders once he was close enough and starting to steer them toward one of the buildings.  Okay, not a page, then. "I've been looking for you. You wouldn't believe what I managed to snag for the boys."
Slowly, he forced himself to open his eyes, sparing half a second to take note of his surroundings - a kind of run-down room with brick walls, apparently - before looking down at himself.
Tony leans forward, running a finger over Steve’s lower lip—it feels a little swollen and tender to the touch, but Steve hardly minds.  “Lubricant,” he says after a moment.  “You didn’t happen to be carrying any in your pockets, did you?”
"I wanted to pretend this wasn't happening, because if it didn't happen then there'd be nothing to remember," Steve said dully, and as much as he didn't want to look, he forced himself to anyway.  Ma was Ma, and even if she looked like she was...
"I'll do it," Cap replied quickly, stepping forward before Tony could do anything and reaching downward.
Together, Luke and Jessica gathered their things, then led them to the makeshift shelter they'd been staying in, which was mostly just a few logs that were arranged in such a way to provide them with a modicum of protection.  "It's not much," Jessica said apologetically.
Steve glared at him.  "So one killer missile named after a religiously significant city wasn't good enough, huh?  You're making a second one now, even after everything you've told me?"
"Oh," Tony said softly.  He'd known—even if he hadn't heard the details—that Pepper had been troubled after her time in the Pacific, though he also knew that she was sure to go back after this was over.  He wished he'd asked her about it.  "Thanks.  You know, for being there for her.  I'm sure talking to you helped."
“What—” Tony begins, stepping away from Steve in surprise as two stewards approach him, making the other man take off his jacket.  “Father, what the hell—”
Immediately, Steve felt his vision begin to swim, gripping a table in an attempt to keep himself steady.  "
Steve coughed as consciousness returned to him, trying to shift but finding his movements were limited.  This woke him up fast, and his eyes snapped open to see himself strapped to a chair—not just with rope, but duck tape as well.  They hadn't wanted to take any chances, apparently.
"I know it's been a few years and maybe you've forgotten about me - "  Here Tony jolted, realizing suddenly that maybe Steve had thought the same thing that Tony had thought: because Tony, too, had long since broken the habit of leaving behind updates specifically for Steve when enough time had passed that it didn't seem like there was any point to it anymore, even though Steve had remained in his thoughts every damn day of his life - "but I wanted you to know that I never did, and I thought of you every single day.  God, I hope you're okay with hearing that, 'cause it's the truth.
Steve remembered, and he had a feeling this wasn't going anywhere good.  "Yes," he said.  "You wanted to find a cure for your heart."
“In Europe?  No.  I’m from Brooklyn.”  Howard scoffs at that, though Steve ignores him.  “I wanted to see the world, and I did.  Then I got homesick, so I got on board and haven’t looked back.”  He gives Tony a quick glance.  “I’m glad I did.”
By this point, Steve seemed to be looking vaguely horrified, but still Tony pressed on.  “So I looked.  And it wasn’t easy.  All those adventures I went on took me to obscure corners of the world.  Places in South America, China, India, you name it.”  Now Antarctica, apparently.  “And you can’t really charge up a repulsor pump in the middle of nowhere.  So there was always that time constraint.
"Damn it all to hell," he whispered, and then he jumped as well, the blue expanse of the English Channel stretching out below them as the drone took off.  For a brief moment, he was struck by a sudden sense of calmness - despite the fact that he was dangling off the wing of a plane, in this body he felt such sureness in every move he made that he almost wasn't afraid at all, and God, the sea below him was possibly one of the most beautiful things he'd ever seen - but then reality settled back in, and he remembered that there were things at stake here.
Steve shook his head.  "That's not the kind of wire civilians buy," he said.  "We should be careful.  I get the feeling that whoever set this up is still around."
Tony's raised eyebrows made it clear what he thought of that idea, and he glanced down meaningfully at one of the woman's hands, which was still holding a pistol.  At least the other one was sheathed.  "If you're hanging onto that, then I'm sure you won't mind me hanging onto my things," he said.
"Jesus," Tony murmured as he stood beside Steve, gazing south—the direction they wanted to head toward.  The problem was that there was a giant mass of biters slowly lumbering toward them, stretching out as far as the eye could see.  "It's been a while since I've seen such a large group."
Rogers groaned and fell flat on his face, sending up a tiny cloud of dust as he did, and then he was out like a light.  And Tony—well, Tony would have been more concerned, but his body chose that moment to completely give out as well, and the next thing he knew, he was lying down, the world going black around him.
“Wait,” Tony protests as he reaches up to keep Steve’s folded shirt in place, even though he’d wanted them to go mere moments ago.  “It’s freezing.  You need something to wear.”
He had to fix this.  He rocked violently against the chair, but none of the restraints gave.  "I need to see him."
“Don’t be silly.”  Tony smirks and walks off, beckoning for Steve to follow.  “I realized after I left you earlier that this would probably happen.  Lucky for you, I happen to have several suits, and you’re free to borrow one for the evening.”  He casts another glance back at Steve.  Steve is taller by a couple of inches and so wonderfully broad as well, but one of the non-tailored suits should fit.  And if he stretches them out a little, makes the buttons strain… well, Tony can’t imagine complaining.  So it’s a win-win.
Tony’s breath catches as he senses the weight of Steve’s hand against his armor.  He can’t actually feel it, but nonetheless, his skin seems to burn where Steve is touching him.  “There’s a lot of other things that’s happened since then that you should be remembering,” he can’t help but say.
He descended down another flight of stairs—he was probably near the bottom of the carrier now, because from what he could tell the only way out from here was back up.  There was one more door, the locks forcefully broken apart.  Tony had to assume once more that it was Cap's work, so he pushed the door open and stepped through.
So he just ducked his head, trying to hide the blush he could already feel crawling up his cheeks.  God, if he hadn't already figured out that Steve was Irish, his propensity for blushing would have given it away.  He went red
“Don’t be silly,” Steve replies, placing one finger against his chin and tilting his head up so that their eyes can meet.  “Of course I do.”  He smiles.  “I don’t get into random cars with just
Tony shrugs, tossing the used wipe into the trash can before getting out the antiseptic.  “True.  But it’s not the same.  And I know I’m the last person who should say that, since I’ve kind of revolutionized long-distance communications, but let’s face it, even talking to each other using the best StarkTech isn’t as good as grabbing lunch together.  But don’t tell the media I said that.”
There was nothing moving inside.  It did, however, manage to smell more terrible than the cafeteria or anywhere else in the school had, and once Steve was done gagging, he could see why—there was a body of a man lying on the ground, his face smashed into a bloody pulp.
"You were using your armor to help people.  And when you weren't doing that, you were building things for our army," Steve pointed out.  Even if Steve disagreed deeply with some of the things Tony had built, he could at least believe that
He doesn’t know what to do or say.  He’s here because he promised a dead man that he’d come visit with him, and just because Steve is gone doesn’t mean he should go back on that promise.  After a long moment of contemplation, he sets the flowers down against her gravestone, deciding if he should push aside the other flowers there; they’re dried and withered and browned, like they’ve been out for far too long—but then he thinks of Steve standing exactly where Tony’s standing now, holding those very same flowers, and he doesn’t disturb them.
They packed their bags in silence and turned to leave.  Before they stepped through the door, Steve put a hand against Jessica's shoulder.  "Did… did you want to bury her?" he asked.  "I could carry her out of here…"
Tony looked around at them.  "There are four of us," he said.  "Three of us should split up and start searching.  The fourth person should keep watch.  No one seems to be around for now, but this is wartime.  We should be careful."
Tony just grunted in response, watching his hands as they worked.  They were nice hands, he supposed.  Big, too.  He liked big hands.  “You know what you’re doing.”
But he wasn’t dead, from what he could tell.  If his senses could be believed, he was still lying on a stone floor in an igloo-thing at the top of a mountain, covered by a blanket of cold air.  That was probably good, he thought, even if all his limbs felt like jelly.
It had been nearly tattooed into Tony's brain.  He'd read as many encyclopedias and books he could get his hands on, trying to find as much information as he could about the whens, whys, and hows of Captain America's demise.  Most of his sources had been frustratingly vague - so much of it had never been released to the general public - but the day it had happened had been known.
Cap's lips twitched, and Tony had a feeling it was because Cap knew he'd won that little round.  Damn him.  "Mr. Rhodes is doing research to figure out where exactly we need to go next.  Apparently while we were on the ground, Mr. Jarvis received some transmissions from Fury about Nazi activity in Xi'an.  Seems like a good lead.  And Mr. Jarvis is fixing the airship controls."
Experimentally, he reached up, touching his chest even as a small part of his brain yelled that he needed to stop it right this instant.  He knew that rationally, as the person occupying this body, he was just touching himself, and it shouldn't feel particularly special. But he also knew it wasn't his body; this one was so different from his own that feeling it was a decidedly distinct experience.
It was five days later when they left the hospital, Tony's ankle having healed enough for him to insist that he could walk long distances without a problem.  Steve had his doubts, but he didn't want to eat his way through Natasha's stores, and in any case, he figured that he'd just carry Tony if it came to it.  After all, it wasn't like he hadn't done it before.
There was a pause.  "No," Cap said at last, even if it sounded like he hated to admit it.  "…Not yet, anyway."
“I’m not sure why you think this is so awful,” Rogers said, glancing up at him with a frown.  “I’m capable of handling myself.  I’m not going to get us into trouble.”
Tony rolled his eyes, even though Rogers couldn’t see, then pulled his gauntlets on, securing them in the darkness.  “Or we could just stay here for a few more days and hope it goes away on its own.  Come on, let’s go.”
So Tony continues to push in, still looking at Steve intensely, like he’s ready to stop the moment any sign of pain appears on his face, and it’s touching, it really is—but Steve rocks his hips a little nonetheless, and Tony gets the message, going just a little faster.  “I mentioned you’re pushy earlier, right?” he says conversationally.  “Because you are.  You’re pushy.”
"Yeah," Cap said.  He smiled.  "We'll work something out.  This won't be the last time we see each other, I know it."
Tony looks down at the box.  Unless there’s somehow a literal ticket to freedom in there, or perhaps a tall, blond man with great arms, he’s doubtful.  “Is the gentlemanly course of action to take the box from you and open it myself, or wait for you to do it?”
Sunset crosses her arms, raising an eyebrow and watching him coolly, barely casting a glance toward Steve.  “I was going to ask you the same thing.”
, Steve had written the day before Tony had found his stash of booze cleared out.  Tony had been annoyed - okay, maybe he still was, because who poured away perfectly good alcohol - but it hadn't been worth fighting Steve over it, so while he still drank when out with people, he hadn't replenished his cabinet.  And maybe this line right here was the start of it all, an addiction that would last the rest of his life. Steve's dad had died when Steve was young - so how bad must it have been for it to have made such an impression on a child?
Rhodey crossed his arms, leaning back into his chair.  "Tiger circles aren't enough to go by, Tony."
There were stairs, and he took them down one by one, the armor clunking awkwardly with each step.  It wasn't meant for fine detail movement, but the alternatives were to either stay outside or discard the armor, and neither appealed to him.  So further down he went, following the trail Cap had left behind—a fallen guard here, a shield-edge-shaped dent there.  He wondered where Rhodey and Jarvis were.  He hoped they were alright.
"I hate doing that, too," Tony said.  At least it wasn't like there was anything urgent he needed to do at the moment, but it was the
—" Tem continued, but before he could finish Steve banked hard to the side, crushing Tem underneath him before rolling away completely.
, and he knows when something’s wrong.  There’s a difference now in the way the ship is moving, a difference in the way he has to hold himself completely upright.  He suspects most people can’t tell.  But he can.  “There’s a list,” he tells Steve, whose face shows shock and just a little bit of blankness.  “I’m not sure how many degrees.  But to feel it already, so soon after impact—that’s not good.”  When Steve still looks blank, Tony continues, “The ship is tilting because water’s flooding in.”
Steve took a deep breath, avoiding looking at the spot where his neighbor was lying.  "Then let's go."
He had to tell Rogers.  “Rogers,” he said, shining his flashlight around.  Where had he gone?  “Hey, come on, don’t tell me you left—”
Tony squeezed his eyes shut, trying to catch his breath, then opened them back up and pushed himself off the ground.  He hated surprises.  Well, he liked them if he knew they were coming, but despite having done the same reading as Pepper, this had been way too sudden for his tastes.
Tony leaned back in his chair.  "Right.  Your job is to fight the bad guys, from what I heard."  When Cap didn't immediately voice an objection, Tony continued, "So I gotta ask, what are you doing here?  Seems like you'd do a lot more good staying in Europe—and yet you yourself said coming along was your idea."
And Tony does.  He’s cautious at first, taking care not to make any sudden movements, but after a few achingly slow thrusts, Steve makes a growling sound in the back of his throat and glares up at him expectantly, hands reaching up to take hold of Tony’s hips.  “Faster,” he says in a low voice.  “I can take it.”
“No,” the man says, and as though he can sense the change in Tony’s mood, he flashes him a brilliant smile, and Tony’s heart may or may not have stopped right then and there.  “I’m Steve Rogers.”
As for the other highlights… well.  It was a bit pathetic, but Steve thought that he was rather fond of the Tony fella he'd dreamed up.  (The Ty fella, maybe not as much.) He was, in many ways, everything Steve was not: smart, healthy, rich, good-looking, but he and Steve did have one thing in common - they sure both had imagination.  Steve drew his fantasy worlds and Tony drew his fantastical inventions. It might have been nice, he thought, if they could maybe meet someday.
Tony doesn’t know how long he ends up standing there, eyes shut as dawn approaches, but it’s long enough that when he opens his eyes and doesn’t see Steve in front of him, it feels like a punch to the gut.
“It’s nothing.”  They approach his room, and Tony cautiously opens the door, peering inside.  The coast is clear.  Last he saw, Sunset and his father had accosted the Osbornes and were currently chatting up a storm with them… so they should be fine for now.  “Come on.”  He ushers Steve inside, then shuts the door, heading for the armoire.  “Go get comfortable,” he continues.  “I’ll go find something.”
She gave them directions, and they went on their way, dealing with any biters they came across—fortunately, there weren't many of them, and the halls were relatively clear.  Once they were there, Steve carefully opened the door, shield out.
Groaning, he forced himself to open his eyes, looking around.  As he’d thought, he was still where he’d collapsed last night.  The pedestal was right in front of him, though the gauntlet wasn’t in his line of vision, which was admittedly limited because he couldn’t bring himself to move any of his limbs right now.  But if he focused just a little, turning his head ever so slightly to make out that thing in his peripheral vision—
Steve becomes the new top cop, and his first order of business is to throw out the Superhuman Registration Act.  His second is to reform the Avengers and give Luke Cage his own team.  “You can’t have Thor or Iron Man,” Steve says to Luke with a smile, and Tony feels a little twist of guilt in his stomach.
"Not at all," Tony said, rubbing his forehead a little.  "There's something else we can do.  But I don't like it, and I'd really rather exhaust our other options first.  Come on, let's ride to Route 1 and see what it's like for ourselves."
And that wasn't the only thing.  She lunged weakly at him, revealing, as she did, that her eyes were white, and her teeth were stained with brown and red.  She responded to the sound of his voice, but only in the most basic of ways, working her jaw whenever he spoke.  Something was very wrong, and Steve needed to help.
Pepper nudged Tony, then cast a meaningful glance down at Cap's clenched hand.  He immediately understood what she was trying to imply, then felt foolish for not seeing it himself earlier.  "It's fine," he said, then brought out the empty jar, holding it out to Cap.  "Do you want to put the piece back?"  He wasn't sure what was going on with the fragment, but he thought that maybe it being in close proximity with another fragment while Cap was holding onto it was messing with Cap's head somehow.  Better safe than sorry, in any case.
"Out," Tony said loudly, and immediately, everyone in the room rose and exited, sharing sideways glances and concerned murmurs.  Tony ignored them.  It didn't matter.  Nothing mattered but the man on the other line, the one Tony was supposed to save from exploding over the Atlantic.  He had to save him.  He had to.
something most people have, we get something that start to approach sense.  This bone talks about something tiger-colored and circle-shaped, split into three, and references the cities of Qufu, Yinxu, and Xi'an, historical capitals during the Shang and Zhou dynasties."  He motioned toward the gem again, adding, "Apparently, this piece we have was found on the body of a collaborationist Chinese soldier trying to smuggle it to the Nazis, and all signs point to it being uncovered in Qufu."
Rogers rolled his eyes, but he set the gauntlet back down.  Like he had any right to be exasperated!  Tony would like to see how he reacted if he tried taking his shield.  “Fine,” Rogers said.  “If another giant mutant cat attacks us, it’s on you.”  He peered out the entrance of the igloo-thing, even though it was pitch-dark outside.  “I think we’ll be okay, though.”
"  The name was drawn out, each syllable precisely enunciated, the sneer evident in the tone of his voice.
"It's not over," Birch said loudly, bringing Tony back into the conversation.  He wasn't smiling like he was before, but he'd regained his composure, a glint in his eyes.  "It doesn't matter if your friends have sabotaged the launchers above.  If you want nothing to leave the ship, then we'll play your way.  Nothing leaves.  We stay and we die together."
Then they were crossing the Manhattan Bridge, and even though Steve had steeled himself, he realized he still wasn't even in the slightest prepared for what came afterward.  It didn't matter that he'd already seen the same thing in all the other formerly inhabited places that they'd passed by, or that rationally, he knew that Brooklyn would be no different from the rest.  Seeing the streets littered with debris and trash and bodies—streets he'd run on as a child, on the way to the yard or school or back home—actually made his chest hurt, and he had to pause, one hand reaching out to grip at a lamp post.  "Oh, my God," he breathed as Tony came up next to him, looking concerned.  "Tony.  This was
Feeling better now that he had some sort of plan, he went upstairs, made his voicelog for the day, and then sketched out thumbnails in an old notebook until he fell asleep.
The journey was, for the most part, uneventful.  Steve was making good time, and though the incline was steadily getting steeper, with the help of glorious aspirin, Tony had no problem holding on as he looked around and tried to take mental notes on everything he was seeing—it was hard to believe, but a part of him was actually feeling
Tony's eyes went wide at that.  He finally acted, springing up onto his feet and starting to climb up the fire escape.  Steve took down two more of the biters who had come close, then followed him up, tumbling onto the roof afterward and panting softly.  A glance confirmed that Tony seemed to be okay, though he did seem to be fixated on the grass below, where the biters were crowding around the building.  Steve gave him a few moments, then pressed, "Tony?"
They chuckled, exchanged a few more words, and stepped back with a wave—and then Steve and Tony were off, continuing their journey south.
“It was nothing,” Tony replied.  Keeping the bitterness off his face he could do.  Keeping it out of his voice, apparently, was much harder.  “Let’s go.”  He’d risked hours he didn’t have in order to pursue this, and now it was all for nothing.
“Of course you don’t,” Tony said, waving his hand.  Rogers bristled, but Tony ignored it.  “My readings are picking up a lot of empty space below.  There’s something down there.”
in the resistance understand?  There are worse things than registration, things that would have happened if he hadn’t pushed this act through.
“It’s a glowing dot in the back of a room,” Rogers said.  “It’s magic, isn’t it?  I don’t trust magic.”
“Good.”  Steve pulls Tony toward him again, eying the water as it comes closer and closer.  “So what’s the plan now?  Stay here?  Go somewhere else?”
Because he likes designing things other than weapons.  Because he thinks there’s more to life than just being the richest and most powerful man in the room.  Because he wants to be
All the strength Tony had exerted to stay upright, to get himself this far—he didn't need it anymore.  He could finally, finally relax.
Anyway, now they were both awake, so Tony supposed it was time to grab something to eat before heading out.  He glanced out the entrance of the cave they’d taken shelter in last night, squinting at the sunlight.  Still early, it seemed.  That was good.
A bullet dinged the pillar he'd just walked around, and he involuntarily gasped, ears stinging from the sharp sound.  Had that been luck, or was someone aiming for him?  There was no time to find out.  He looped the rope around the pillar as quickly as he could, then took off the gauntlet long enough so that he'd have enough dexterity to tie off a knot.  "It's done!" he called afterward, hoping that would be enough for Rhodey to know he could climb up now.
As the day passed, with Tony making the walk from one home to another to deliver things, it became increasingly evident that
Soon enough, he heard more thudding coming from above, and a moment later, a ceiling tile above them slid open.  Jessica appeared, looking dustier than ever.  "Hey," she called.  "Can I come down?"
Tony whines softly, nuzzling against him some more and slipping his arms loosely around his body.  “Can’t we?”
“Hey, I’m just a slow human,” Tony told him, jogging to catch up and trying not to wheeze.  He’d downed some more of Rogers’ aspirin earlier, but things would be much easier if he wasn’t hurting at all.  “You know, I’d shout at you less if you just walked at a manageable speed.”
Neither Steve nor Stark replied to that, instead following her lead and looking around.  True to her word, there were medical supplies here—not a lot, but it was still enough to be helpful if they ever needed it.  "All done?" Steve asked once they'd closed their bags, glancing at them both.  "We'll leave out the same window.  I'll boost you guys again."
“Okay, then,” Tony said after a moment of silence.  “Chop chop.  We have a mountain to climb.  Let’s go.”  He was about to start walking again, but Rogers made a whining sound, going over to his pack and shield.  Oh.  Right.  They probably shouldn’t just leave this here.  He went over to pick everything up, though he left the tattered remains of Rogers’ clothing behind.  Once they got Rogers turned back—because they
This time, the words were accompanied by a gentle shake of his shoulder, and Tony groaned again, blinking in the darkness.  “What?” he asked irritably.  “Rogers, is that you?  Go to sleep.”
Tony shook his head.  "I'm not going to leave you alone, Ma," he told her.  "I'm gonna keep you company."
“Yeah, it’s best not to get him too pissed off before noon.  Don’t worry; you’ll get to meet his charming self tonight.”  He pauses, worrying his lip for a moment.  “…No, maybe this was a bad idea.  You’re nice, and he’s mean.  He’ll say awful things to you.  Maybe you shouldn’t come.”
"Here!" he heard Pepper call out in response, but there was too much smoke to tell where she was; all he knew was that he could also hear gunfire from the same point, and he prayed it was her shooting and not the other way around.
Steve glanced over at him.  He supposed Stark would know best, having actually been conscious for the past decade.  Still, he couldn't help but ask, "Not even flying?"
Steve forced his eyes open.  Tony looked so worried. There were wrinkles around his eyes and his face was pale.  Steve had done this.
Later, he and Steve sit together in the ruins of the mansion kitchen where they’d shared so many coffees in the past, long after the other Avengers have left.  “I’m sorry, Tony,” Steve says.  He reaches out to take his hand, and Tony lets him.  “You never really get over the loss of someone important to you.  All you can do is wait for it to stop hurting so much.”
Tony catches a glimpse of the chain—now broken in half—before stepping back and taking a deep breath, barely aware of his hand dropping the gun into the water; his arm’s gone numb.  “Christ,” he breathes.  “Thank God.”  He takes a few more moments to collect himself, and then he splashes over to Steve, reaching out to embrace him—and that’s when the world goes white again.  “Fuck,” he gasps, sagging a little in Steve’s arms; dimly, he can see the other man’s eyes widen, lips parting.
Tony paused briefly with his tinkering.  "I don't know," he said at last.  "People don't just… have Makarovs.  And I think the word she said earlier was Russian.  Didn't recognize it, though.  But maybe it doesn't mean anything.  It's too early to tell."  He went to try the faucet again, beaming when a small stream of water came out and wetting a towel with it.  "Alright, leg out."
“Okay,” Tony said, because he didn’t know what else to do other than say useless words.  “Steve.  Just—just hang on for a moment longer.  I’m going to fix this, alright?  I promise.”  He looked out the window, at the sun that was still steadily sinking under the horizon.  He was running out of time.
Steve followed his gaze, trying not to think of the fact that each of these biters were once people, people with hopes and dreams and their own stories.  The dog tags he still carried around in his pocket were enough to remind him of the terrible casualties.  "So this is a herd, huh?" he asked.  "Why are they all clumped together like that?"
Jessica screamed as Stark swore loudly, and for a moment, everything was chaos as they moved to avoid the thing, only to have something else drop near them right after.
Panicking, he stops dead in his tracks, turning back to look at Steve.  No matter what happens between him and Howard, it seems that at the very least, he doesn’t want to see Tony die—and that means something, it really does, but—but—”I-I can’t get on,” he tells Steve.  “Not without you.”
It should have been him who ended it, Steve thought.  He remembered Jessica, remembered how she had ended it for Peter and then Carol.  She had been their friend, and she had done right by them by sparing them further suffering.  But Bucky… it hadn't been Steve who had spared his suffering.  It'd been Tony.  Steve didn't begrudge him for that—it was his own foolishness that had necessitated it in the first place—but he still couldn't help but feel as though he'd ultimately failed Bucky.  He wasn't sure what there was in the afterlife, but Jesus.  What if he'd succumbed to that bite?  How could his soul ever rest, knowing that he'd caused his best friend to kill him?
And so they split up, each heading in their assigned direction, with Cap staying where he was.  Tony jogged around the parts that were already excavated, only slowing down to examine the occasional remains to see if they seemed relevant.
Steve could feel his fingers tightening against the shield.  Maybe Tony was right.  "Sir, we would really prefer not to fight."
Tony flipped to another page, only to realize that he was staring at a drawing of… himself.  He blinked.  What was he doing in here?  He went to the next page, realizing that this, too, was a drawing of him, face lit by the firelight as he studied his gauntlets.  When had Steve done these?
Tony let out a choked sob, and he turned against Steve's hand, as though he was craving his touch.  "Say it," he whispered.
His father is staring at the cutlery very intently, and for a moment Tony wonders if he’s just going to ignore the both of them.  Well, that’s for the better, he supposes.  But then Howard takes a deep, shuddering breath, turning his gaze up to glare at Tony.  “
Before he knew it, his feet had taken him back to his room, and so he quickly repacked his backpack for the correct set of classes today.  His gaze slid over to his cabinet, which he knew would have his custom-built laptop sitting in one of the drawers…
"I'll manage," Tony replied as he stood up with his empty tray, ready to ditch Ty and the cafeteria, so that he could go back to his room.  "You know I do."
They stopped a few hours later, with Tony declaring that he was starving and needed to eat.  Rogers allowed him to awkwardly dismount, at which point Tony flopped down onto the ground, rubbing his legs.  “God,” he said.  “I’m going to be feeling this in the morning.”
So he stepped forward, and he could feel his own pulse jump when Steve stepped forward as well, his gaze fixated on him.  Rationally, he knew the others were watching, but he was barely aware of them anymore: at long last, it was just him and Steve, here in the same place and at the same time, meeting one another's eyes.
Tony’s parents are later killed in the same Ford Thunderbird convertible his mother met his father in, and when that happens, he’s forced to stop sleeping around.  He takes charge, founds the Maria Stark Foundation, and is forced to wear a metal chest plate to keep his heart from failing after one of his own bombs blows up in his face.
Steve swallowed as he looked down at him.  What could he even say to that?  He was afraid, too.  He was afraid of inflicting pain on him, whatever the reason.  He was afraid of Tony turning into the thing he most feared.
It didn't look like anything Tony hadn't already seen.  Before he could say as much, though, Cap shook his head and said, "Keep looking."  Then he started walking in a small circle, though he kept his hand outstretched, his palm serving as the center he was rotating around.
It was Tony.  It had always been Tony.  Did Steve ever know this?  Had he ever had a chance to see Tony’s handwriting?  After Sunset, Tony had become more careful about leaving things with his handwriting lying around.  And he and Steve talked about their words so sparingly, it was hard to know what Steve’s thoughts were.  All Tony’s ever known is that Steve didn’t like his words.
After far too long, he remembered to glance back up, only to see the guy - Ty, whoever that was - staring at him.  "Are you done?" Ty said.
“Yes, mother,” Tony replied, staring out the window of the airship as he listened to Rogers walk off.  One week.  Seven days in which the airship would come every day at noon and see if they were ready to be picked back up, because the Savage Land was in the middle of goddamned
She has a point, he supposes.  He does have every intention of looking for Steve once this dismal affair is over.  “Meditation?”
, and even now Stark was saying he'd apparently been right to be upset—whether it was because of the Jericho or something else, Steve wasn't sure.  Stark's reveal about Pepper's fate had made him disinclined to ask too much about the past for the time being.  In any case, now Steve didn't know how to feel toward the other man; there wasn't enough room, he thought, for anger after everything.  He supposed he was just resigned to the fact that Stark was who he was, for better or for worse.  And despite what had happened, at the very least he agreed with Stark on what they had to do next, and he would see things through to the end.
Maybe it was just more nonsense.  Tony said nothing and let Steve hold him in the increasing darkness as the night settled around them.
," Tem laughed.  He lunged for his discarded gun, Steve holding back long enough to see him grab it, raise it, and point it straight at Tony—
"Bethesda's still a long way away," Tony said.  "Personally, I think it'd be grand if we could ride a train all the way there.  You want to go see?"
"I can keep an eye on Mr. Stark," Cap said from the background, surprising Tony—he'd forgotten Cap was even there.  "You should get some sleep."
Tony wavers on the spot, looking uncertain as he reaches out, gripping at Steve’s lifebelt.  “Promise?”  It’s childish, but he hardly cares.  He’s on a ship that’s sinking into freezing water.  Losing his maturity is probably acceptable.
It didn't sound like a threat.  But it didn't exactly sound like something a normal person would say, either.  It almost seemed like… support? Tony's warning from the voicelog echoed in his head, and Steve still had no idea what to make of it.  Was Tony's Pa so volatile that these things had to be said?
"Not at all," Stark replied as he started mixing the threads of twine into the moss.  "But they're not very fond of smoke."
"Great.  We're in luck—it's a steam engine, and I think I might be able to get this running after I clean out some of the gunk in here.  I don't know how far we'll be able to get, but it beats walking."  Tony smiled broadly, though it faded into a contemplative expression as he added, "It's going to be pretty loud if it works, though.  We've already gone through the station and the train itself, but could you also look in the tunnel?  Just to be sure we're not about to bring a herd of biters onto us?"
"Don't let it go to your head," Cap muttered.  He got a roll of gauze out next and started wrapping it around Tony's arm.
"Right," said Tony.  "So we'll have to see for ourselves.  Our immediate plan of action will be to disembark the airship west of the site, where there's a mountain range that should give us cover.  Jarvis will stay on board and keep her in the sky once the rest of us are off.  We'll proceed by foot for the rest of the way—Rhodey will lead here, since traipsing through the wilderness is his thing.  When we arrive, we'll see.  If the Japanese are around, Pepper takes lead.  She's been reporting on Japanese activity for ages, and I trust her more than myself to know what to do with them.  Otherwise we'll start looking."
“Nothing’s wrong!” Tony chokes out; Steve has never heard someone sound so unconvincing before.  “Everything’s—everything’s fine.  Perfect.”  He makes another futile effort to pull away.  “Look, thanks again for last night, but we’re done now.  I have no reason to see you again.”
"We used him," Tony repeated.  "And when we'd smeared his insides over us, we laid down, and we waited for the biters to pass."  He shuddered again.  "For half an hour, I was on the ground, staring right into Sal's dead eyes.  Like he knew what we'd done to him.  I'll never forget it."  He started rubbing his hands against the roof of the building, and Steve quickly took them into his own hands before he could do any damage.  Tony struggled, but Steve held tight, and in the end he gave up on trying to pull away, sighing.  After a moment, he continued speaking.  "When I was in the middle of that herd just now… I couldn't stop thinking about it.  And not even just about Sal.  I thought about plunging my hands into Rhodey.  Into Pepper.  And consciously, I know I didn't do any such thing.  But what I do know is that I
But Carol wouldn’t understand.  She’d sided with Tony all those years ago, when things had gone so horribly wrong, but she’d never shouldered the regret and pain of what had happened, nor did she ever have any reason to.  After all, it wasn’t she who had given the order to lock Steve up in power-dampening cuffs the day he’d died.  It wasn’t she who woke up in the middle of the night, dreaming of Steve’s blood dripping off her hands.
“We were,” Tony replies.  “I was going to tell you during the talk, so I guess that means this is the talk now.”
His fault.  This was what Tony had thought for the past five years.  The idea of such a burden was staggering.  How had Tony even survived like this?  "Tony," Steve said, reaching out to take his hands because he was starting to look slightly manic.  "It wasn't your fault."
involve switching places with someone from the goddamn Great Depression) had found it and used it.  He wondered if anything had changed on there.
Oh, so the backpack was what Ty had been searching for.  Steve stuffed the last of his muffin into his mouth, trying to look casual.  From Ty's expression - and, Steve feared, from the bedhead he supposedly had, even though he thought he'd done an okay job at combing his hair this morning - he wasn't sure he was succeeding.  "Humor me."
"You left me!" he screamed, and in that instant he didn't know if he was talking to Mom or Steve.  It didn't matter. Whoever it was, they were gone and they weren't coming back.
In retrospect, he should have anticipated the response—Tony surged forward, one arm wrapping around Steve tight as he returned the kiss for all he was worth, only ending when Tony suddenly sagged, wincing.  "Sorry," Tony said quickly, trying to lean forward again.  "Ignore that, I just—"
Tony knelt down to inspect them, then looked around the area.  "Yeah," he said. "Someone must have raided here recently.  Footprints show a normal gait.  Hell if I know if it's the guy we're looking for, but it might be worth checking out."
.  God, he'd spent so long moping over the lack of journal that he'd completely forgotten about everything else.
, because he'd failed to hold on to the thing that mattered most to him - but he managed.  He would look in the mirror, staring at the chestpiece he'd have to wear for the rest of his life, and then he would remember that having an imperfect body had never stopped Steve from being perfect.  He would suit up, ready to put his life on the line for something he believed in, and in doing so carry out Steve's memory. And at night, alone in bed, he would reach over to place his fingers against his wrist, feeling the thrum of his pulse, and he would be reminded that Steve had seen in him someone worth fighting for.
The warning proved useful, though, because a few hours later, Steve heard a sound he might have wrote off before, but this time he stopped in his tracks, throwing an arm out to halt Stark as well.  "We're not alone," he said softly, pausing to draw his shield.  Beside him, Stark brought out a sharpened shovel—his preferred choice of weapon when it came to the biters, Steve had learned.  Melee weapons, Stark had told him, didn't need to be reloaded or recharged, and that meant everything in a world with limited resources.
"I think I'm the only one who can say for sure, don't you?" Tony responded softly.  "Even when you were angry with me… and even when I was angry at you for being angry with me… you were still everything to me.  When I thought you died…"  He trailed off, taking a deep breath.  "Well.  I'm glad you're back, Steve."
God, he has it bad.  Now the water’s at his shoes and getting the bottom of his pants wet, and what does he hear?  Tony’s voice.  Calling his name.  He really wishes his mind wouldn’t tease him so, making him think that somehow Tony is down here, looking for him.
"Entertainment's no small thing, especially not in difficult times," Steve pointed out.  He still remembered devouring each issue of
“I’m going to stay up and keep watch.”  Rogers glanced up from his notepad, quirking an eyebrow.  “I know
Steve yelped, and only the weight of the box kept it from sliding off his lap when he let go of it in fright.  "Excuse me, what?"
Tony raised one hand and waved at him.  Either the shield boy could follow or he could not—hopefully he wouldn’t, but Tony’s hopes weren’t very high.  How could someone who so embodied the American spirit be so annoying?
"Geography, mostly," Tony said.  "Hills and bridges and the like funnel them together, and then they just kind of…  stay that way.  And now they're headed here."
The sabretooth stirred, and Tony swallowed, wondering if he should just run for it.  But what if Rogers was nearby?  He couldn’t abandon him.  Rogers would have done the same, right?
Steve frowned, trying to remember what he'd said yesterday.  The way he remembered it, there hadn't been many words exchanged before the action took place - that was why Dougie talking to him now was so surprising, even if the hostility wasn't.  "I have no idea what you're going on about."
Steve wasn't sure if that would work.  He felt like it had been such a long time since he'd done that.
For a long while, they sat together in silence.  Tony wasn't sure what was going through Steve's head; hell, he barely even knew what was going on through his own.  But they were here now.  They were holding hands.  And Jarvis and Pepper and Rhodey had all seen and they hadn't said a word.
"Killer—" Tony began, but he cut himself off and sighed.  "Fine.  I deserved that.  But this is why I didn't want to tell you about it."
Steve quiets him with a longer kiss against his lips, brushing some of the hair away from his eyes.  “You idiot,” he repeats, but he slips his arms around him afterward, holding Tony against him and letting the other man nuzzle against his shoulder.  He wants to be upset, because
" - So I didn't have time to actually raid the workshop for parts today, but I did some more theorizing and I think I have a solution for powering the microbots," continued the box.
“Wait, what?” Tony sputtered, nearly spitting out his coffee.  “What do you mean, tomorrow?  It’s only the fourth day, isn’t it?  We have three more days before the airship stops coming for us.”
it to do and fixed his dying heart, then that was it.  He wouldn’t need anything or anyone anymore, much less Steve goddamned Rogers.
But the hallucination, apparently, was persistent, because it spoke again.  “Tony.  Open your eyes.”
And yet—Steve whined suddenly, his body twitching, and Tony jumped backwards from the sudden movement.  “Steve,” he said yet again, meeting his eyes, those wonderfully blue Boy Scout eyes of his—but then something changed, and that
that.  If something comes up, roll with it and flash a smile as you do.  I have a great smile. Use it to your advantage.
Tony smiles a little, reaching up to touch Steve’s hair.  Steve can see the muscles of his throat working, like he’s struggling to say something—Steve almost thinks he knows just what it is—but can’t.  Finally, he seems to just give up, instead leaning forward to kiss him deeply.  It’s not
“Relax,” Tony coos.  “I’m just joking.  Kind of.”  Not really.  “Oh, look.  My father’s sitting down.”  They seem to have chosen a smaller table—Sunset looks annoyed and his father looks angry.  Maybe Sunset’s just told him about Tony’s dinner guest.  “Okay, last chance, Rogers.  You can still escape the madness.”
"What do you want," he said flatly, even though he already knew what Dougie wanted.  His fists clenched in anticipation.
Tony rolls his eyes.  “Actually, I’m on the right side of the rail for what I have in mind.  So you can go off now and… and be poor.  Thanks for pretending to care, though.”
He froze.  It was so faint he'd almost missed it, but—he'd heard it.  That was a biter sound.  He turned quickly, facing the darkness of the tunnel, and then he saw them—not too many, and mostly spaced out, but he didn't know if there were more where he couldn't see, and if they piled up in one place the train wouldn't be able to pass through.
The Skrulls invade.  Extremis is shut down.  Tony loses his position as head of both the Avengers and S.H.I.E.L.D, and Norman Osborn, of all people, is appointed to take his place instead.  Everything goes to hell, and Hank blames Tony.  And even if Thor, Clint, and Hulk are miraculously, wonderfully back—they all blame him too.
Steve didn't know what that was in this context, but the woman's lips twisted upward in a half-smile.  "Natasha Romanova, at your service."
That seemed like a lot of effort, but Tony supposed he could try.  He started to lift up his right arm—well, lift it up even more than it already was, because someone had elevated it already—then immediately aborted the action because
all your fault.  But I know you've been in bad spots before, and you've always gotten out of them.  Because you're Tony Stark.  That was practically your job description before the war.  So we
—you’re going to pick yourself up and put everything back together, because that’s you.  You’re Iron Man.  That’s what you do.”
By the time the sun dipped low into the sky, Steve was still missing, but Tony realized with a start that he was very much near the top now.  He turned around, looking downward—and goodness, it was a good thing he didn’t fear heights, because seriously, he was high up.
And as the hours passed by, as he stared at his telecommuting device, his soldered piece of metal, and his scribbled homework, all he wanted to do was say
Cautiously, Steve wiggled his toes and then his fingers, shifting his arms and legs experimentally.  He still wasn't sure why he was here, but whoever was responsible didn't apply any sort of restraint, which was promising.  Once he was sure he had reasonable command over his body—how long had it been since he'd last moved around, days?  Weeks?—he managed to swing himself off the bed, gripping at the nightstand to steady himself.  "Deep breaths," he murmured, and he found himself surprised at how scratchy his voice sounded.
Finally, after several moments, he thought he was ready to continue, and so he pressed play again.  "You have no idea how much time I've spent figuring out your new-fangled laptop," Steve-with-Tony's-voice continued, and Tony could hear the hint of a delighted laugh in his words.  It had been so long. "It's really something else. But I think I've got it. And I wanted to leave this voicelog now, in the morning, because there's stuff I gotta say and I didn't want to risk not having a chance to do one later.
Tony just swiveled his chair away, not answering.  There was only one reason he was here, really.  It was the same reason he’d gone to the British Honduras or Atlantis or any of those other places: that faintest glimmer of hope that somewhere, somehow, he’d find a cure for his broken heart.
went the bullets as they struck the ground around him; Tony twisted his body reflexively in response, squinting in the brightness.  And though a part of him was still afraid, knowing that from the way they were shouting and shooting that their goal wasn't to disable, but to kill, a bigger part knew that he had no choice but to fight back and
The answer was apparently almost no time at all, so with a groan, Tony got up, stretched, and got ready for work, casting a wistful look at Steve's journal before he left his room.  Catching up on whatever had happened since they'd last swapped would have to wait, it seemed.
Steve frowned a bit and turned his attention to Tony.  "She's a strange one," he said.  "You learn anything about her?  Was anything unusual?"
Gone.  They'd tried so hard to unite the pieces, only to have it disappear once they had finally succeeded.  Tony didn't know how to feel about it.  Maybe that was okay.  Maybe the only thing they had ever really needed to do was to keep it away from those who would have used it for harm.  And if it had vanished itself, then maybe they had done good.
Dimly, Steve remembered something about how the Soviets had apparently become their enemy after he'd gone into the ice.  Was that something that mattered, though?  Did nationality or politics have any sort of significance in a world like this?  "Is that really something we should be focusing on?"
They were still gone.  Maybe Steve should just go after them.  He had to protect Tony, and he wasn't sure if he trusted the woman just yet.
"We're okay," Tony said, pulling the gauntlet off of Rhodey's shoulder and shoving everything back into his pack.  "But we still have work to do."
“Oh, Tony,” Steve murmurs, and his heart aches again.  “I-it’s okay.  I’ll say it to you as much as you wanna hear it.”  In whatever time they have left.
It was all over in less than five minutes.  As always, Steve fought back as hard as he could, but the truth was that he just wasn't
Tony grabbed it back, quickly flipping back to the passage he'd been on.  "I was in the middle of reading that, thanks very much."
"Thank God it's you," Rhodey breathed as he looked up.  He'd taken off his outer shirt and tied it around his face such that only his eyes were visible.  "Cap was here, but a bunch of guys attacked him and he's busy now.  Is Pepper okay?"
Steve stared at her, bewildered.  Her recognizing him as Captain America wasn't particularly noteworthy, but—"What does him being CEO have to do with anything?"
"Ten-hut!" someone shouted, and immediately the entire atmosphere of the room changed, everyone springing to their feet and saluting as Tony scrambled to keep up.
"Ye of little faith," Tony lamented.  They'd gone looking for things with a lot less evidence in the past, and it always—well, mostly—turned out fine.  But that wasn't the argument he had to pull out now, fortunately.  What he
“I thought you’d be here,” Steve says as he hobbles closer on his crutches, and for a moment, Tony considers running away again.  But he can’t.  Not here.  “Though I’ve thought this in the past, too.  But this is the first time I got here in time to prove myself right.”
Tony tries to explain.  Tries to tell her that he didn’t do this, that he doesn’t know what happened, that he was trying to
Together, they make it into the hallway, and Tony turns toward the direction he’d taken on the way down, motioning for Steve to follow as they trudge through the water.  He sticks the hand attached to his bad shoulder in the pocket of his trousers, trying to ignore how completely and utterly uncomfortable he is.  Never mind that he has a damned
“I’d accuse you of being a flatterer, but it’s true,” Tony replies, and Steve snorts again.  What is modesty to Tony Stark?  He wiggles his fingers.  “Steve, I want you to draw me like one of your French boys.  Wearing this.”
," he said.  "So I'd say don the suits and go in with guns blazing."  He could go even grander—probably something involving rigging the airship somehow—but without knowing the circumstances of the others' captivity, he couldn't risk blindly raining explosives or otherwise onto wherever they were holed up.
They head back in, hands clasped tight as they stride back to the suite, Tony trying to look a lot more confident than he currently feels.  To his surprise, Sunset is out in the hall, leaning against the wall with one leg crossed in front of the other as her eyes land on them.
It wasn't actually that much easier this time around, but at least Tony was a little more emotionally prepared now.  He read Steve's admission about how he had been afraid and trying to pretend the worst wasn't happening, he read Ma's last words to Steve, he read Steve's stream-of-consciousness rambling as he tried to figure out what it meant to stay and remember and fight.  By the end of that particular entry, it didn't really seem like Steve had managed to figure it out. Tony couldn't blame him. He wasn't sure he really knew, either.
"Now?" asked the woman.  "Nothing.  But if things were different, I would have stolen everything his company had and taken it back home."
And no matter how many times he dreamed that night of wild eyes and pointed teeth, each time he woke up in a cold sweat and looked at Steve’s sleeping form, he told himself, over and over again—Steve was going to be okay.
That was pretty much the best reaction he could have hoped for.  He landed on the deck with a loud thud, cracking the floor beneath him.  From behind him, Cap let go, his shield coming out in one swift movement.  "I'll take care of the guys on the upper deck," he called as he ran off.  "Head toward the fire when you can!"
"So it's okay, darling," Tony continued, his cold hands reaching up again to touch Steve's cheeks, and Steve forced his eyes back open.  "That—that was how I lost the suit.  I repurposed it to pull you out of the water, and it was irreparably damaged afterward."
Rogers’ brow furrowed, and he worried the kit in his hands for a few moments, eyes on Tony’s stained shirt.  “You’re bleeding,” he said again.
It didn't take long for him to find what he was looking for.  Soon enough, he was staring down at his trembling hands, gripping the drawing Steve had done of himself and Mom so long ago.  Tony had never had a chance to give it to her. Now he never would.
Tony snorts, moving toward the railing and leaning against it.  “God, no.  She’s part of the problem.”
