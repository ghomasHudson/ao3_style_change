No, Tony thought resolutely, no alcohol.
”There is another neighborhood quite like this 20 miles away, we could stay there for a few days, I sent a small scout there last night, and there seems to be a relative amount of food, and few walkers”, JARVIS replied, and Tony smiled at his greatest creation yet, and let himself pretend, for just a moment, that it was all okay.
Unfortunately the girl saw the gesture as something else.
And, worst of all he knew, he knew that maybe, maybe Steve was still out there, fighting, all alone, alive.
”Fine”, was Tony’s standard response, almost automatic now.
”Don’t shoot”, he said, looking at the shotgun the woman held in her hands, but it wasn’t needed, she already had lowered it.
But death would never come.
The person had stopped walking.
That familiar stab of pain again.
Sometimes Tony really hated his own brain.
He wanted
“Where are we heading, Jar?”, he suddenly turned to the suit, that was calmly floating next to him as he walked.
”, JARVIS’ prim voice said.
Shut up, stupid mind!
Tony snickered softly as he turned back to the bag of gummy bears.
”Do you need help? You don’t look very good”, she lowered the shotgun entirely and walked towards him, but he took a couple steps backward.
He could remember it as it was yesterday, when he’d been 6 months sober, he had come home, and everyone had decorated the whole living room, including a banner from the ceiling that said
Tony looked at the bottles, a bit longingly, he could really use the numbness alcohol brought right now, to not feel
Tony silently crept to the end of the aisle, his footsteps barely noticeable. He carefully peeked around, but saw no one. Tony tiptoed further into a part with a dozens kinds of chips, and pressed his back to the aisle, Tony saw the door from the corner of his eye, but the person must’ve already walked further.
Tony could remember the beginnings of it, a small virus, practically just a fever with some unusual symptoms. He could remember the panic, the speculation, from those first few weeks, but nobody died from it. So ultimately, everyone decided it wasn’t harming anybody, so they just decided to ignore it until it hopefully blew over.
The whole gang had been waiting for him, party hats on, and when he’d come through the door, Peter and Clint and popped the party poppers, covering him in heart-shaped confetti. Then Steve had been there, slinging a casual arm around Tony’s shoulder, saying..
”After you”, Tony gestured to the door, which the suit pushed open carefully, Tony following it, both carefully avoiding the booby trap laid on the front steps. Tony looked at the house with relative nostalgia, it was a normal family home, and if he hadn’t been born a Stark he might’ve been living here with...
Then there’d been the business trip, to Atlanta, and Tony had blown Steve a kiss with a smirk and the assurances that he’d be back in a week and he’d turned around and boarded the plane without even looking back.
Focus, Stark! Not the time!
”No!”, Tony whispered-screamed, then a quieter, “fuck”
JARVIS tutted when Tony stepped downstairs, quickly closing the suit around him and letting warm air dry Tony up, and Tony sighed at the coldness of the water disappearing without a trace.
JARVIS seemed to contemplate this, before making the decision it would be safe enough, ”No more candy”, the A.I. said warningly, before floating out of the supermarket door.
“Steve!”, Tony woke with a start, feeling like he’d just gotten the wind knocked out of him as he panted. He gingerly closed his eyes and opened them again, feeling the tracks of new and old tears on his cheeks. Tony rubbed at one eye with the arm that wasn’t on the mattress, the other one was stretched out, grasping the sheets for someone.
Footsteps echoed on the floor, not exactly unconcerned, but the person obviously wasn’t expecting to find anyone here. Tony tensed as they moved closer, and almost sighed in relief when they moved away again.
”There is a local supermarket two streets away, I have cleared it out during the night”, JARVIS continued, but then his voice turned disapproving, “But shouldn’t you shower first sir, the last time you washed up was...”
JARVIS started again in his ear piece, “
, a traitorous part of his mind whispered (
Then Tony passed out.
”I said, who’s there!?”, the voice was stronger now, gaining confidence, and the accent was more prominent, southern, Tony realised numbly.
”Please don’t tell me you got those off one of those things”, Tony raised an eyebrow at the faceplate of the suit, but when the A.I made no move to respond, he grudgingly grabbed the clothes and went to the bathroom next to the bedroom.
That had been 3 months ago.
The grief that suddenly struck him brought him down on his knees, and the sob that tore through him was terrible.
He wanted Steve, Steve had always been able to talk him out of these panic attacks, had always known just the right thing to say, or had known when he didn’t have to say anything at all, just pull Tony closer, stroke his hair. Tony would usually fall asleep on Steve when he’d calmed down, and he’d never have nightmares then. Then he’d wake up, and wander into the kitchen and find someone already there, he’d be given a smile, a greeting, he’d laugh, and the panic would’ve all ebbed away.
, the house had been empty when he’d arrived, and he wondered what had happened to the child, but when big brown eyes and that wide grin began to enter his mind, he quickly deserted that train of thought.
Tony held one gummy bear in front of his face, squinting his eyes, “Eh, good enough”, he declared, before popping it in his mouth.
It was obviously the sound of the door opening.
JARVIS actually
”Are you alright?”, she asked, and Tony almost bristled, he didn’t look
(See the end of the chapter for
”, JARVIS’ voice in his ear almost made him jump a foot in the air, and he barely avoided slamming against the aisle.
, and seriously, when had he learned that, and floated away, looking at the fruit, if by some miracle, some were still good.
Tony pulled the clothes on without bothering to dry off too much, a green shirt and dark jeans, which were the perfect size and
Tony had seen it, the breathing would stop, the body would slump, just a person dying, he’d seen enough death in his lifetime, but then you’d hear a growl, and a finger would start moving, and the person you knew would be gone, and they’d be replaced by this thing, driven only by the primal instinct to eat.
”Anytime, sir”, JARVIS sounded pleased, “Shall we depart now?”
And that’s usually where his dreams started, Steve, Peter, Bruce, Natasha, Clint, Thor, waking up, their eyes that weird bloodshot white, their faces and bodies spattered with blood and organs and things that were definitely not supposed to on the outside, their limbs stumbling towards Tony, growls fitting wild animals low in their throats. Then they’d open their mouth, snarl, and break out in a messy run towards him, and Tony would close his eyes and wait for the sweet relief of death.
His heart had begun pounding immediately, so loudly he was convinced the person who’d just come in could hear, his whole body was thrumming with tension and his breathing quickened.
Had Tony mentioned he really hated his own mind?
”, JARVIS said insistently in his ear.
”Don’t have any new clothes”, Tony brushed him off, standing up, stretching and beginning to walk out of the door, only to be stopped by some pants and a shirt dangling in front of his face, held by JARVIS.
”No, no, I’m fine”, he directed the message both to the girl, and the A.I. listening in, just to be sure he clutched his arc reactor, hoping JARVIS would get it, because right now he was kind of scared he’d jump with the iron man suit and traumatize the poor girl.
Tony had been asleep when it had happened, the outbreak, a rare night of good sleep after he’d talked to Steve on the phone, he could still remember that conversation, Steve’s voice, always so fond when he would talk to Tony.
(Poor little rich boy, still always seeking validation)
, a worse part whispered back))
”Are you alright sir?”, JARVIS’ concerned voice said as the armor floated softly into the room, just like he did every morning and like he probably would do for a lot of mornings to come.
I promise the next chapters will be longer, this was just an introduction to the setting of the story. :)
”Can’t you like, go look at some houses, J? I think I can get me some food by myself”, Tony cast a sideway look at the suit, “I mean, what if there’re still some of those things in there?”
A noise stopped him in his tracks.
”No, I’m fine”, Tony said, turning away from the girl, still clutching the arc reactor and actually kind of panicking now.
JARVIS didn’t walk.
But he couldn’t.
”Okay, status on food?”, Tony swung his legs over the edge over the bed and ran his hands through his hair, which now hung a little below his shoulders, pulling through the tangles.
”Fuck”, Tony sat up, feeling his bones groan in protest, and rubbed his eyes properly, willing the images of the incredibly vivid dream away. He yawned, feeling the weariness settle in again like an old friend.
It had started, as all things bad do, in America, Tony thought, of fucking course.
Tony blinked a few times.
”What about this one?”, Tony holds up a bag of gummy bears to the suit over his shoulder.
Then you had those...
”No excuses now, sir”, the A.I said, and his impeccable voice would’ve just sounded pleased to any other, but Tony could recognize the note of smugness in his old friend’s tone.
Tony wouldn’t even know that, to be honest, if it weren’t for JARVIS keeping up with the time for him, he was just slouching around nowadays, eating when he was hungry, drinking when he was thirsty, and sometimes he’d try to sleep, only to wake up screaming for Steve, or Peter, or whoever had been on his mind that night.
Instead, he’d always wake up,clutching the arc reactor, eyes wide with terror, silent sobs shaking his body and arm stretched out to the side, reaching for someone that wasn’t there.
”Fine, J”, he whispered as quietly as he could.
If JARVIS had a face Tony was pretty sure he would have rolled his eyes, ”I have scanned the neighborhood and it seems like we should leave in an hour or so, a wave of walkers is coming”
His gaze trailed all the bottles, vodka, whiskey, wine, beer, his mind supplying him immediately with the percentages of alcohol and how much he’d need to get seriously hammered. He caught eye of the alcohol free beer, and his hand hesitantly reached for that, maybe he’d be able to fool himself it was the real thing...
Tony had jumped away from the bottle on instinct, reflexes of years of not wanting to be caught doing whatever he shouldn’t be doing kicking in.
Tony was about to ask if that was JARVIS when he heard the soft footsteps hesitantly tapping around the aisles.
He should’ve seen the signs, he should’ve, when it spread and spread and spread and the panic was beginning again, but him and Steve had been deep into their honeymoon phase, so wrapped up in each other, unconcerned about everyone and everything going on around them. Crime had even been slowing down, and they had thought they were just lucky.
“Ah! Steven!”, the brunet chuckled in surprise as he felt ten strong fingers gripping his rear and squeezing deliciously tight. His hips circled down by reaction, making the smaller man moan in realisation of what was under him, the other released a pleased laugh. The soldier tried to take his time admiring the other man, but when his index bumped into something very familiar he couldn’t hold back.
“more...fuck me Steven, please Steven…”
He interrupted himself when he saw her fast asleep on the dark sheets of his bed.
"I like old fashioned"
The blond stood back in front of her, stroking one lock of hair behind her ear: "got shy all of a sudden?"
Her eyes never left him, she still had her power.
When she spoke her voice was low, warm and round; it was like a good glass of red wine.
Steve just chuckled shaking his head: "that's a cliche"
The party had to go on and God was it difficult. Every time the genius turned to talk to someone he spotted the light blue of that ridiculous shirt. At some point he was sure he could have smelt Steve's presence nearby. Yet, they were far from meeting, from talking or touching. Nothing was wrong between them, let's be clear, they just couldn't talk yet or else they would have forgotten about the party at all.
"I need to take this off!", she complained and gently moved her hair to the side of her neck.
Once again Steve was in his space. What was it with him invading people like this, very american of him.
"Don't be so harsh with them, they don't have eternity to think about if vampires appear in pictures or not. Let them dream of the moment they will have some power over us with some blackmail"
He reached in with his thumbs to stretch her open, sliding his tongue deeper inside. Wet sounds and her panting were filling the room as he let her hump against his face.
"Oh I wish you will quarterback…".
---------
He was wearing that damned blue shirt, of course he was. Didn't he have another shirt? That one was for parties and only that one? He needed to get some help for his wardrobe, maybe even Tony could have helped him. Stark took the sight in: Steve Rogers was a masterpiece. He had those strong arms, his back perfectly curved and his hands so big. He matched the same canons of a greek statue but had the soul of a norse god. Maybe he could have asked Thor if they were partially related, wouldn't have been surprising.
Steven smiled softly and patted his own friend's back while addressing the counterpart: "I hope Bucky is not boring you out with his family's stories and what not"
The other nodded deeply and turned immediately to a dirty blond guy (Steve recognised Clint, a player on his football team)next to the stereo, gesturing at him to turn the volume down.
And Tony was gone. He licked his palm like a good bathing cat, slicking it up as much as possible and reached down, loving the sensation of Steve in his hand, both at his mercy and controlling him with just a few words. In the meantime the soldier leaned down: he bit, licked, sucked at Tony’s neck and jaw, making sure to leave bruises for the days to come. Loving the sounds the other was making as he pulled the plug out, tossing it to the side for later. He took the occasion of Tony’s moan to shove his tongue in his mouth, tasting it enthusiastically and letting their tongue twist and tangle together.
The shorter boy shrugged while letting his fingertips stroke on the surface of the chemistry book: "you're handsome, a quarterback and you suck at chemistry, you're pretty much a cliché aren't you? As for me!", he bent slightly down in Steve's direction with a hand pressed to his chest, "I'm a total surprise!".
"That's incredibly hot"
Steve pushed his pants down along with his underwear, pumping at his length twice to make a statement.
In the meantime Steven marched upstairs with his hands holding her up against himself, squeezing her thighs dragging his digits into her soft, warm skin. Her toned legs perfectly shaved, she was attentive to her looks.
Steve was going to interrupt the other's monologue but decided to fully answer after him: "I'm- no! I don't suck at chemistry it's just really hard-"
While taking his hoodie off in his bedroom he heard muffled noises from the main room, Sam was already home for the holidays though…
The man smiled, shaking his head: "oh no, he actually kept going on about your missions during world war II. I'm Sam by the way"
“Stevie, I’m home!”, Stark called out well knowing his husband was home. He specifically asked Friday that information in order to get his surprise ready.
"Are you going to invite me over or shall I beg to become your feeder?"
Too selfish, too stubborn, so absorbed from his world of dreams that he barely knew what was happening around him. The genius wasn't ready for this. Steve was all love and Tony barely knew what the word meant. He wanted to give it a try so bad, but what if he hurt Steve? He couldn't lose him, he couldn't just...pretend that nothing happened.
At this point the elf in a skimpy outfit was sitting on Steve's chair scribbling away on his textbook correcting his chemistry homework like it was nothing, the quarterback got closer, standing behind him in silence.
How was this even going to work with their erratic lives.
You couldn't
"How did you find the party? Am I the best party thrower or not?", Tony grinned around the rim of his glass before drowning its content and hissing at the tingling sensation.
"It would be my pleasure, milady", with a bow and another kiss of her hand Steven made his way back to Bucky's side, who was now chatting away with a buff man, slightly shorter than his friend. This man's skin reflected the lights with glimpses of gold, high cheekbones in a full face. His hands were playing with a glass of whiskey, amber colour just lighter than the dark chocolate tone the man's skin was.
“Next time we will do more-”
His teeth grazed on the round muscle still hidden under the dress, before she could move again he bit down, digging his fangs into her flesh, sucking. He felt the thrill of warm blood dripping down his throat, which made him even harder than he already was.
He needed another drink.
They both collapsed down  onto the bed, Steve making sure to lie sideways not to crash Tony. They lied there panting in silence: Tony closing his eyes with a soft contented sigh and a sly smirk on his face, Steve staring at him gently caressing his torso and undoing the corset. Tony smirked and hummed: “Let’s not wait this long next time…” ”I agree on that Mr. Stark-Rogers”, and Steve’s hand was stroking the brunet’s chest opening the top of Tony’s chorus girl uniform even more.”That’s a first”, he teased.”You know that’s not even remotely true, baby boy”The other chuckled and opened his eyes smiling over to his husband: “Maybe, but I like when I tease””You know me so well uhu”, and the blond leaned in kissing him lovingly, taking his time to push off the corset and slipping it off of Tony, taking off the skirt too and tossing everything to the side. ”Getting me naked after sex?”, he chuckled again at the soldier’s annoyed expression.”Shut up smartass, someone gotta clean ya”, and with that Captain America stood and disappeared into the bathroom to run warm water in the sink.
She smelled like engines at first, clean ones in a well kept industry, the tingling taste of passion fruit with an accent of raspberry.
More.
“Let me clean you up”
The vampire grinned wide, a lopsided smirk that made his face lit up with a sort of madness in it. His eyes immediately went darker, even redder in the pupils: "are you willing to be my feeder?"
"That despite being one of the few women at MIT you felt at home there way more than with your parents"
Once again, with sharp fangs he dug them into the flesh of her thigh, sucking strongly filling his stomach with the warm liquid.
He was the devil ready to corrupt this shrine.
James Rhodes was called out from the current conversation he was having by the bell ringing once again.
"Your father?"
He leaned in close, brushing his nose against her jaw and up to her ear lobe: "you won't look for one after I've started"
That was how they worked: the second they were talking, the rest of the room was background noise. It was Tony and Steve, Steve and Tony; no one was going to change that.
He leaned up, kissing Steve's lips softly. The smell of beer collided with the sweet scent of Steve's cologne, making Tony wrink his nose as he stayed still waiting for Steve to return the kiss. Waiting that didn't last long since Steven was now wrapping his arms around his waist, kissing him even deeper, just like last time.
Rogers turned to him with a deep frown, almost shocked: "No! I mean not- now. Not tonight"
"I will need it, she's not like any girl I've seen"
The boy raised his fists, cursing himself for the lack of a baseball bat within reach and walked to the room: "hey! Go away!", He called out, not really believing it was a good idea. Steven watched the box as it wiggled, scared he stepped over cautiously, it seemed like it was trying to lift itself from the bottom. Rogers took a deep breath, maybe it was some kind of animal for a prank or for someone else, in one second he grabbed the box and lift it up gracelessly, making its content trip backwards.
Steven looked up at her and licked his lips, his fangs showing slightly with his lips ajar.
He sighed looking up at the dark sky above them, light pollution was a disgrace: "Well yes, I'm an old fashioned man"
This wasn't the moment to remember, but as soon as their eyes met Tony couldn't stop his mind from racing backwards to that evening...it was a normal evening like the others, a movie playing in the background and the others watching it in the living room...
The night wasn't entertaining, apart from a couple erupting in a fight because she stared at another man way too long for her partner's liking, fragile masculinity was Steve's favourite thing to watch.
"I can't wait".
At the blond's silence Tony just huffed and looked around the dorm room: it seemed nice, clean and nicely furnished, the guy had a simple taste but he could change that. Tony's eyes landed on the desk, there was a trophy on top of it next to some chemistry books: "Uuuuuh football player?", The brunet grinned madly like he had found the holy grail.
"I said, would you like to grab a drink nearby?", Toni grinned deviously even if slightly irritated. She liked when men listened to her and gave her their full attention, no exceptions for vampires.
It felt like a shock down her chest to her toes: a wave of pleasure shook her body making her wet the bed and Steve’s length up her entrance. She stayed upright for several seconds until she felt it, the thing that made her definitely drunk.
Like a good host, that Stark wasn't, he showed them both inside offering champagne and some appetizers, which of course were declined.
The Vampire gave her three harsh slams, their skin slapping loudly and with the last one he released a loud animal growl.
He clenched his coat tightly around his slim figure not to give away any hint of the surprise when Steve himself called him: “Upstairs!”, yes. It was show time.
"What's your name?"
The lights in the big ballroom glimmered as Tony scanned it with his eyes, almost making it difficult for the man to make out the figures dancing around him. It was chillier than usual that evening, thankful for the warmth filling him from the whiskey he was drinking, Tony Stark spotted a well known figure among the others.
She was a sight to behold.
"Why not?!"
"We barely know each other!"
Steven stared dark eyed as his husband pushed him down onto the bed making him fall on the mattress which wiggled lightly under their weight. The soldier let his hands travel up Tony’s toned thighs, tensing muscles under feather-light touch. Anthony, on his side, stroked his palms hungrily over the soldier’s suit, his mouth biting and tasting on the other’s neck and jaw, making sure he was going to taste Steve for days after that.
A scar next to her vein caught his attention.
Toni took this as a challenge.
"Good luck then"
She sucked hard on it, moaning as he squeezed her hips so tight he for sure left bruises. Toni rocked her hips back and forth against him, trying to get some friction against his hard cock through her panties.
Steven didn't wait long when he saw the elegant figure walking down the stairs. Her red dress is now covered by a thick coat and a fluffy scarf.
Yes, they were married and yes they lived together; but also they were two superheroes in one of the most dangerous countries in the world apparently. To the point of ridiculous. It had been a week and a half since the last time he got to see Tony alone in a room, all the days after it had been either Steve or Tony going to bed too late or getting up way too early.
The brunet blinked twice and grinned: "knew you couldn't resist...even if it's 'not for you' ". At the recall of Steve's own words he scoffed and stuck his tongue out, climbing up on the couch to rest between Tony's body and the back of the couch: "fuck you"
Her thoughts didn't have time to evolve since his tongue was already pushing against her labia, collecting wetness and making Steve slurp on it.
The other followed curiously until he saw Steve actually pulling out two beers from the fridge: "waitwaitwaitwait. Are you not going to fuck me over the counter now?"
Toni yelped out loud: she expected the pain of course, but not the insane pleasure that came after the bite. She felt her power give out, making her limp at Steven’s mercy.
"Yeah...You do"
Oh hell no. Steve apparently was a total hunk and a sweetie massive beefcake with morals?! Tony wasn't letting go that easily. "Oh no baby, you're gonna hear me rant for the whole night before I leave you alone". The other laughed heartedly and showed the way to the living room.
"Here- oh. You're closer than I thought-", Anthony turned the chair around looking up at Steve's face "no problem sugar, you can call me to help you whenever you want~", he stood and patted Steve's chest appreciating every second of it.
Steve looked down at her, eyes roaming up and down her body. His hands joined his eyes pushing up her dress, feeling her inner thighs: "fuck...your skin is so soft…" he leaned down, kissing up her skin, her smell filing up his nostrils and lungs.
He looked at Steve with warm eyes and scoffed with a grin: “I created a kink monster, I swear. Should’ve stopped when I had the chance”. The other shrugged while slipping the covers on top of themselves: “ya married me tho”. ”Hell yeah I did”, and with that Tony wrapped himself around Steven’s body kissing his chest, already drifting off to sleep.
A shiver ran down the woman's spine at the sensation of his cold breath against her warm skin. In a few seconds she was pulled up by her hand and secured inside her coat and the two of them are marching out the pub in the cool air of the city at night.
Her expert fingers immediately started working on his shirt, ripping some buttons off of it
The way her body arched against the mattress, her breasts almost brushing against his arm made him understand that he hit the right spot.
Was Steve blushing? Oh God no, this was wrong, they shouldn't have talked tonight. He wasn't ready to forget or even say no to Steve
The only thing that distracted him from her eyes was the movement of her hand bringing the glass of champagne to her plump, red lips.
The other was mesemerized, call him a sappy artist but Steve really was asking that question. How can someone be so beautiful, charming and good in every way; and most of all how could that same perfect person decide to spend his whole lifetime with him? ”Stop staring my love, I’m going to faint over here”, Steve was brought back to reality by Tony’s breathy words and got back to his ministrations. His tongue was wet against the goosebumps it left up Tony’s inner thigh as it trailed up to the main object of his attention. He closed his lips around Tony’s member, suckling ever so slightly, teasing him and bobbing his head down as slow as possible, trying to make the other conscious of every inch of his own skin. Steve’s own situation desperate in his pants.
Steve rubbed the back of his neck shyly and let out a small puff of air: "Hey James...I'm sorry can you...maybe turn down the music? I'm studying next door and it's finals week and I-"
It felt like ages since the last time they got to put hands on each other and Steve was so touch starved he wasn’t sure he could hold in tears the moment he had the possibility to touch his husband.
Rhodey nodded and immediately reached for the handle only to be surprised by a massive chest in front of his face "Uhu…."
When Steve entered the hall of their penthouse he was greeted by the slow rising of the lights and Friday’s voice: “Good evening Captain, I’m afraid Mr.Stark-Rogers hasn’t come home yet”. The soldier just nodded in acknwoledgment when an idea struck his mind making him grin wide as he started to undress quickly heading for the shower.
"I always thought you kidnapped women for their blood"
For the record: the Stark family was one of the most influential groups among the humans, so much that vampires seeked their support in different ways.
He crawled back up to her to leave wet kisses on her chest, around her nipples. His tongue circled on the nipple and his lips closed around it, sucking heavily until he released with a loud pop.
Nonetheless, the blond looked up and- wow- he locked eyes with two light blue pools studying him like a manuscript. The woman had long lashes, just a black line of eyeliner complimenting the shape of her lids.
Only, this time no one interrupted them, not even when Tony grabbed Steve's arm dragging him upstairs.
Through the paper thin wall Steve could hear the music blasting inside the dorm flat-like room nextr to his, it must have been a kind of Christmas party, it didn't really help the growing headache he felt because of finals. He should have known people were going to be wild before vacation days, nonetheless he couldn't have gotten ahead with homework before that evening: he had a part time job at the library that occupied the majority of his time alongside his lessons.
"You're so ready for me aren't you…"
But what was even "this"?
Rogers chuckled lightly and followed the other with his eyes: "You're leaving?", And he immediately bit his tongue. What the hell Steven. You don't even know the guy and now you ask him to stay for whatever reason. The question resulted in Tony turning slowly with a magnetic grin: "If you insist...I can stay, quarterback".
they were.
Like a predator stalking his prey he pumped inside the writhing woman under him. “Y-yes- t-there Steven- the-OH”
That was why he was now fixing a cardboard box covered in stamps with a bow on the top. The box was big enough to contain a person, which was in fact Tony himself. While he was struggling to get tape off of his limbs he giggled to himself: “Rhodey is gonna love it”; with a happy huff the young man closed the box on three sides except for the bottom.
Steven couldn't help but stare.
So. Finals week and Christmas music.
The taller boy returned the smile before walking back to his dorm flat.
Pepper was stunning that night, a backless dress showed her beautiful form to the people around her, she was a good PR after all. Anthony was still talking with the investors of the new protection project when once again the genius lift his look up: he was looking at him. Steve was chatting with Bruce and Natasha, but he was looking at Tony.
_____
With one swift movement Tony was under Steve, big hands roaming his body and down, lower, lower until his mini skirt was raised up: “God…are you even real?”. Tony’s only respons was a loud moan as he arched his back onto the mattress as Steve played with the plug in-betweeen his fingers. He could have felt Steve’s eyes fixed on his body, thick an needy and it felt so good. Having his own supersoldier, his lover, his husband and saviour there driving him to cloud nine.
That was a low blow, Steve knew it, but that story had always succeeded in amusing new partners.
"Chick at hour three, hasn't moved her eyes from you since you started standing here like an idiot", Bucky's voice in his ear made him cringe, they could have talked at a normal distance like normal people.
The vampire leaned down to kiss up her neck, smelling his scent on her. The woman tilted her head kissing his slow and tender, in stark contrast with their latest activity.
The lady grinned at Steve's glare
The blond chuckled in agreement: "I guess so, would have liked to talk with you too though, instead of catching you staring at me all the time"
with Rogers: he would have actually listened to you. Stark couldn't bare having those eyes staring at him, or even those big hands brushing his shoulder to squeeze and remind him of how
"I deliver myself, they open, I jump out in a skimpy outfit, they all laugh and maybe I even get someone's number!"
He licked his fangs and leaned down: “Sleep tight”.
Toni arched her hips up to let Steve slip her dress higher, right below her chest. His tongue was ravishly licking up her inner thigh to her belly button, his hands unable to stop caressing the taut muscles of her abdomen.
“C-close-ah-YESTHERETHERETHEYESSTEVE!”, Tony moaned out loud, bending in half backwards basically (Gosh he was so flexible) as he thrust up, overwhelmed by the sensation as he came heavily onto himself, skirt and corset stained white. Tony kept moaning and whining while his husband kept thrusting inside his oversensitive body until: “F-fuck Tony- Ba-baby boy mhf! Tony-”, Steve slammed twice again coming inside Tony with a loud growl of his name. His length twitching inside Tony’s walls, stretching him slightly more and filling him up, making the brunet cry out his name once again.
She willingly opened her lips sucking on his tongue: it felt kind of weird to feel it so cold against her own warm mouth.
The blond smiled, straightening his back up, and licked his lips: "a lovely name. I'm Steven Rogers, head of the Rogers family".
"You're a woman of taste…"
The taller boy smiled warmly and turned his head lightly: "Imma...Imma give ya a blanket". And he stood leaving Tony there quietly curling up on himself as he felt colder by the alcohol in his body having its effects. Steve returned and placed a soft fuzzy blanket on top of Tony and nuzzled his shoulder with a soft smirk. The brunet giggled lightly as he tangled calloused fingers through dark blond hair: "Steve…"
His attention moved to her other breast, flicking the hard teat with his tongue and drooling all over it again.
The woman leaned in on the table, her chest provokingly uncovered by the cleavage of her dress: "what if /I/ misbehave?"
"Steven G. Rogers!", Howard Stark cheered at the sight of his favourite (and most menacing) non-human. Weirdly enough, the word vampire always scared the others.
Fact is: no touching, no kissing, no cuddling for much too long. And this needed to end immediately.
Steven smiled and held his hand out: "I'm Steven Rogers". That was unexpected. Tony blinked twice and shook the hand: "I'm Anthony Stark…". The blond smiled and nodded towards the kitchen: "Beer?"
"I'm o-okay Steve-", the genius patted that strong muscular chest lightly and swallowed down some more of the water, "I'm fine". When Stark looked up he knew he was in danger. Steve's eyes were on him once again with that soft blue hue that made him weak at the knees.
In this position the vampire grabbed the headboard behind her after lining his cock to her entrance. Painfully slowly he pushed inside her hot, velvety entrance. Her wetness making it easy to fully enter her.
"Neither, since I've been attending these parties for my whole life and my father won't stop talking about you and your family all the time"
Steven dug in kissing her neck heavily, licking up to her ear and then back down, pushing her down on the bed with a splayed palm in the middle of her back while his tongue licked down the line of her spine.
"Yes, they used to scream as soon as they saw us. Not knowing that we actually don't kill our feeders, unless they misbehave"
"This nomenclature exercises are all screwed up! Let me just…"
"I am the one giving orders here", he mumbled as he leaned down to kiss down her neck, tasting her sweat on his tongue keeping back from eating her raw and alive, at least not yet.
The next morning Tony woke up with a slight headache, not too bad after a long night. He felt his head rise and fall in a wave-like rhythm, his cheek pressed on top of a soft bare chest.
When he finally pulled back she was a panting mess, struggling to push down her dress completely. She turned once again: her body was in full display now. It felt like he was at the feet of a deity, a holy shrine he was soon to enter.
"No, actually it would have been weird courting you in front of your parents"
“Gah! Yes- Stevie!”, the brunet yelled out in pleasure as strong arms hoisted him up against a sturdy chest making him sit on Steve’s hard length which now was slipping even deeper, hips pounding up making Tony feel his ass burn. Steve slapped Tony’s rear twice, grunting and biting at the joint between his neck and shoulder: “mmmhf fuck- Tony- fuck- so perfect- a god. Look at you- so hungry-such a cockslut for your Captain”. And Steve once again pounded up, strongly, making Tony arch his back and thrust in his arms: “There! Oh-S-Steve!”, he arched his back hovering over the bed, trusting Steve’s strong arms were holding him up, which happened. With the new angle Steve was able to hit that sweet spot again and again, for a moment only the sound of skin slapping against skin filled the sex-scented room; Tony’s moans and Steve’s growls adding to the sensual chant.
"Your taste…"
After tasting more of her wet skin he decided he wanted to go in more: making his tongue pointy he shoved it inside her entrance, pumping in and out while sucking on her clit enthusiastically.
She seemed even younger while asleep, like if her worries all slipped away with her own blood sucked by her current bed companion.
"This is my home"
The blond grabbed his thighs lifting them up and starting to pull out and snap back inside: “ah! Sh-shit- so tight- yes. Fuck-Tony”. He quickly undid the jacket of the uniform tossing it to the side, staying in his shirt as Tony pulled on the tie: “K-kiss me baby- ah! please-”, and Steve once again failed not to being stunned by the beauty below him, kissing way too lovingly for the moment, but adoring the way his husband became compliant just by a gentle kiss. The shorter man threw his arms up around his soldier’s shoulders clinging on him as Steve started to thrust harder, making him feel every inch ad every snap. He rolled his hips slower as he pulled back from Tony’s mouth: “Tony. So perfect-Gosh-”, and he was back at thrusting harder, snapping his hips strongly. Tony’s vision going blurry at the beautiful sensation, moaning out loud, arching his back, throwing his legs up and down squeezing Steve’s hips and digging his heels into the small of his back encouraging him to go harder and harder.
"Centuries"
Possession seeped through him: he wanted to own this woman as long as life gave her the chance.
Tony couldn't bring himself to go up and just
"Hey yourself", Stark turned on his stool holding his glass up, pouting at the sight of Steve's empty hands, "No drinking tonight?".
The woman tentatively touched his hand: "are you listening?"
“He said he has to work on some project...pretty sure he's working on another better coffee machine”
"What's the plan?"Tony asked as they traveled upwards, having to zig-zag slightly when the mini guns spotted him.
Steve looked down at their arms intertwined and smiled. "And you smell like alcohol, Tony."
This time Steve chuckles, lowering his shirt back down. "So do you, but you always look really good."
Tony would need to do some serious damage control if he was going to get ahead of this. He quickly finished washing up, before hopping out of the shower, pulling his towel from the rack and wrapping it around his waist. He grabbed his phone off the counter, punching in a contact before placing it to his ear.
She raised her perfectly manicured brows and then nodded. "I'd love to take you down on the mat, if you've got the time."
"What?"
The wind blew icy, whipping the small white flakes around in absolutely no pattern. As they fell down they swooped up and around. Calming only for a second between gusts. For some people, December was the most beautiful time to be in New York, for others it was the coldest the city ever got. While store fronts were filled with festive lights and decorations the ground was covered in brown slush, people marching about their days in sickening routine. The sun set early, behind the concrete towers and the night sky spent weeks in a hazy gray with fluttering whites.
"What's wrong?" Tony called out, gaining Clint's attention.
The music is still going, but it's no longer a slow song and Steve's voice whispers in his ear that it's maybe time they got out of there. It's only then that Tony allows himself to part from the warm comfort of Steve's body. "Please." he finds himself reply, but it's not desperate or needy, it's just honest.
"More of an acquaintance really-"
"I'm saying you haven't bothered to ask to see if I would." Steve spoke simply, with a very fond eye roll. If he wasn't careful they were going to roll out of his skull.
"What?" The Stranger replied, eyes wide, looking an adorable mixture of confused and scared.
"Well everyone but Sam." Tony corrects with a smirk, watching Sam cover his face. "I have to give you some serious credit Sharon, if it was me I would not have had your restraint, I don't do hints very well."
There was a beat where Tony contemplated his options, really he had none. There was no way out of her grasp, with or without a weapon. He inhaled deeply closing his tired eyes. "I'm sorry Nat. I can't do this"
"I want you to meet someone." And just like that Natasha was pulling Tony to her side, and pointing towards a table of smiling faces. "That's my man of Honor Clint, he's annoying but we go way, way back.-"
"Pepper is going to murder me." Tony stated quickly straightening up in his chair and pulling his keyboard towards himself. It would still be in his drafts, life was not completely over, at least not yet.  "Don't look so smug." Tony cut back, the swooshing sound of an email being sent coming from the computer speakers. "If she finds out you let me go all afternoon with it floating in the drafts she will murder you next."
The barn looks magnificent, the lights littering the ceiling are all shining bright, there's a dance floor in the middle of the room surrounded by large round tables. Each table is covered in a pristine white table cloth, the rose center pieces that were so urgently ordered sitting on each one. There's smooth music playing while people are laughing and talking, it truly looked like something out of a magazine. Pepper would have been so proud.
Tony felt bad for just standing there watching him, so he instead turned his attention to the mess of scattered papers they had created. Carefully moving around the space and picking up what had fallen. He heard Steve promise to be on his way, and frowned, because he wanted to demand Steve stay and finish what they were starting, but it was Natasha, and it obviously was serious.
Natasha did Steve the favor of leaning over to check the comment before she rolled her eyes and continued readying the blender. "That's because your other posts didn't have females in them, besides that isn't even that bad Steve."
Natasha transferred cooked bacon on to a plate, trading off the cooking duties only once Steve had made it down to the kitchen.
Tony glanced up from the engine, but looked less than thrilled as he did. "You mean to tell me, that you've been trusting a complete stranger to fix your bike -" he held up a finger to Stop Steve from cutting in like he was just about to do. "No no, a complete stranger from
Natasha rolled her eyes, but grabbed his hand and yanked him into the throngs of people. "There are some people I want you to meet, specifically." She weaved them around a few more bodies, exchanging a few hellos with people she obviously knew - but wasn't too concerned about introducing. "You need to meet the wedding party, I haven't shut up about you, and my friend Clint thinks I'm lying about knowing The Tony Stark.."
"I can learn to forgive you." Clint sighed. "C'mon, everyone's in the kitchen."
"I don't want to hear it." The voice came through loud and clear, making Tony flinch.
Later that night, Tony posts a photo on his Instagram. It's a selfie of himself and Steve, its an older photo, taken a few months ago. It's nothing special, they're on the common floor on the couch.  It was a movie night, the team had settled around the room, to watch some random action flick of Clint's choosing.
When he knocked, he had not expected to Clint to be the one to greet him, but there the shorter blonde stood, with a pout on his lips. "You're not a stripper."
"I'll make sure she gets home safe." Tony said with a laugh, sending a wink Steve's way, and doing his best to not mention the flush it sent up the good captains neck.
He fought with every single person that Pepper put in that position, no one was good enough, and the ones that did work hard were either too afraid of Tony to put him in his place, or got too frustrated and quit. It took a year of his assistant being a revolving door of people before Pepper promoted Natasha.
, but no, he still had no desire to go, no matter how tempting being Tony's date was. "I'm sure, Tony." He slid himself off the stool, leaning over to put his now empty cup into the sink. "I've got a lot of training to catch up on tonight."
A brief thought of what they could have had, and how badly Tony found himself still wanting it all.
At this request, Tony set his tablet flat down on the table, and turned to give Steve his full attention. "Sure." He spoke carefully, eyeing the blonde and the tiny black square in his hand. "What's on your mind?"
Tony was right, well half right. That was a stupid problem. Steve tried his best to hold back his eye roll, but didn't bother chancing a glance at Tony, just in case he failed at it. "Have you asked Pepper?" he said instead, focusing on his incline.
"Seriously?" Tony asked, looking from Sam to Steve and back again. "Sharon has been trying to get with you all weekend, how have you not noticed?"
"And if he was getting you something, so was I." Bucky said with a grin, setting the boxes down at the table. "Open mine first."
Which is why it was so surprising to Steve, when he stumbled into the gym, only to find the one person he least expected to see, awake and running on one of the treadmills.  Tony's head snapped in the direction of the doors having heard them open, and stumbled only slightly on the moving belt, before he reached out and slowed the machine. "Sorry Cap." He breathed, as he slowed down to a fast walk. "I wasn't expecting you here so early-" he looked up at the clock on the wall, narrowing his eyes. "Or late. I can get out of your way, if you give me a minute."
“You do know its cold out here, right Cap?”
"I think you already know how good I look when I ride." Tony couldn't help the innuendo, noting the way it made Steve flush, even just the slightest bit. They were standing close again, and Tony found himself once again looking at Steve's lips. He tried to remember how they tasted, and then his eyes were flickering back up to the blue ones that looked back at him.
"Uh - Yeah." Steve still felt flushed, and could only hope he was hiding it better than he thought he was. He wasn't sure he was going to be able to get Tony's words out of his head, let alone the pictures those words put there. He gave his head a tiny shake, twisting off the lid of the second bottle. "It's just been a long night is all."
------
"You alright with me posting it?" Steve asked, for probably the tenth time since taking the photo. Sam wasn't exactly an official Avenger, but he had been out on enough missions here and there for the general public and press to have an idea of who he was, so it wasn't like Steve was about to post a photo of a stranger.
was, before pushing himself off of the bed and heading out of the room.  "I could definitely go for some bacon though."
"I'm not sure I will ever forgive you for that comment." Tony turned around and grabbed a torque wrench from his tool box, turning back to the bike and crouching behind it. "This is
When and Steve and Tony finally make it up from the shop, the gang is still cluttered around the television. Out of pure reflex, Tony releases Steve's hand from his own, but this time, Steve isn't letting go.
"You held on to these?" Tony found himself glancing up at Steve, who had moved even closer to him in the time it took to look at the sketch.
There captured in a moment was Steve, the corners of his eyes crinkled, mid-laugh, so honest and beautiful, with Tony, smirking next to him, trying to look cool, but ultimately failing. It was written all over his face, anyone who knew Tony Stark would be able to tell in that moment. The way he looked at Steve, the way his smirk wasn't so much a smirk as it was pure love radiating from him. All for Steve.
"How do I look?"
Steve nods, and moves to grab another hay bail, carrying it across the barn, though he doesn't say anything.
"I was never this bad." Steve protested, before he motioned to the screen of horrors above him. "This is not old fashioned Tony, holding a door open for a girl is old fashioned, asking someone to go steady is old fashioned this-" and Tony swore he heard Steve's voice raise an octave and crack. "This is not old fashioned."
Toni gasped at the sound and grinned wide: "damn Sir…"
"Wasn't it obvious?"
Stark rolled on his belly, not really caring about messy, he liked the smell of Steve on himself,  and closed his eyes contentendly waiting for his husband to get back to bed. And here he was, changed into just some boxers with a warm damp towel in hand. He knelt between Tony’s legs, cleaning up his thighs, not his entrance yet, negligence which gained a frown from the brunet: “Mh?”.Steven huffed a laugh and stroked warm hands up Tony’s back, peppering kisses here an there on little moles and scars. He picked up the plug and pushed it against his lover’s sensitive and spent entrance. ”Ah shit motherfu-”, Tony moaned loud as he felt the plug slip inside, shivering at the sensetation of cooling cum being pushed inside him. He panted and looked down at his husband with a questioning look. ”For later”, was the simple answer followed by a soft kiss on his cheek.
"too bad! Rhodes's dorm room is right next door!", Steve tossed the cardboard aside next to his desk and stared at tony
"You either go up and talk to her or I will-", Bucky didn't even finish his sentence that Steven was already moving towards her, smiling politely while fixing the collar of his shirt.
Two fistfuls of his jacket dragged him forward and a pair of full warm lips crashed against his mouth.
The atmosphere felt relaxed but fancy nonetheless.
Tony's eyes scanned the bicep that was now leaning on top of the counter, Steve's back against it as the soldier turned to look at the room. "I see, but you need to get out of your cave Rogers, need to meet people, talk about whatever you like to talk about".
She finally sat up and turned her back to Steven, gaining a disappointed growl from him.
He really should have listened to her. But no, he just had to go ahead and keep talking without thinking and drinking. Scotches, never again, he told himself. Never again. As a distraction he ran a scan of his suit and had J.A.R.V.I.S. display the results above him, and the desk. The damage on the suit was of course nothing a few hours of hard work couldn't fix, but the damage to his pride would take longer.
okay?" Steve narrowed his eyes at the screen. "And that bulling is.. bad?" he had his fair share of bullies growing up, it was a well known fact that Captain America stood up to bullies, hell it had been his tag line in the war. But the fact it was the day and age of the zero tolerance policy and this shit was still happening baffled him. Even worse that he had to go out and remind people that it was bad.
"I am Tony, I am." Steve cried out his name and it caused Tony's heart to twist inside his chest.
The tone in Steve's voice makes Tony anxious. It sounds sad, and worried, and it makes Tony want to call him back right away, he wants to tell Steve that he hasn't lost anything, but he also wants to roll his eyes, because he's been waiting for that phone call for nearly ten years, and he wants to ask Steve if that was so difficult.
"What will shut it down?" Cap asked, ducking cover as the mini guns fired on him.
Because telling Tony Stark you love him is not exactly the best way to announce a huge, life consuming, completely closeted, crush.
"Shut up and take your jacket." Was all Steve could muster back, holding out the suit jacket that had still been in his hand. Tony however couldn't help but chuckle at the comparison because Sam really wasn't that far off.
"That is not funny." Sharon said with a stomp of her foot, finally catching on. "You're so not funny, any of you."
"Now I know why you quit drinking." Tony replies, because lack of hangover burritos would definitely make him stop drinking. "Are you drawing me?"
With that Natasha started the blender, and Steve, well Steve got an idea.
"No." Steve blurted, because it wasn't his gym, and also because he didn't want Tony to leave. "It's fine, you won't be in my way or anything." Steve clarified, after his brain caught up with his mouth.
"It all started with this little red bubble that wouldn't go away." Steve sighed, relinquishing the phone, before pulling a seat from the other side of the table. "Then it said something about clouds and now..." After taking a seat, Steve sighed once again. "now it keeps saying something about data?"
"That's fair." Natasha agreed. "I hear weddings are the place to meet someone new anyways, so who knows what you'll come home with from Vermont."
At that Tony chuckled, raising the mug to his mouth again. Putting a positive spin on any failed relationship was nearly impossible, but he had at least expected Steve's friends to sympathize. "He was an asshole." Tony confirmed over the rim of his cup. "Might still be, I don't really know him anymore."
Tony is taken aback by the sincerity in Steve's voice, and finds himself coming to his feet. "I would really love that." he says and he means it.
He knew it was coming the second Tony shuffled into the kitchen, eyes barely open as he made grabby hands towards the coffee maker. Obviously coming up from one of his all nighters. Steve knew he was wearing that fond smile on his face as he grabbed the genius's cup and poured the fresh coffee he had made specifically for Tony, just on the off chance that he need it.
Down in the kitchen, Natasha had already started the frying pan, while Bucky had started whisking eggs. Somewhere after the second flip of bacon, Clint had risen from the dead and crawled his way into the kitchen. Though Tony was unsure if he was going to make it as he sat himself behind the kitchen island and laid his head against the cool marble counter top.  Sam was awake, pouring glasses of orange juice, while Sharon was sitting next to Clint at the island scrolling through her phone. She had very obviously not gotten laid the night before, as she was wearing a particularly annoyed face anytime she caught a glimpse of Sam around the kitchen.
"You love him." Sharon said with a roll of her eyes. "Stop pretending you don't."
"Steven, may I speak with you?" Thor's voice is strong and commanding, but even still, Steve can make out the cautiousness underlining in his tone. Like a child about to ask for candy, slightly innocent, not something Steve should fear, yet, no one likes to be asked to talk.
"I did." Steve looks back up from the book, and tilts his head, just like he used to do when admiring him, and Tony can't help but feel anything but vulnerable underneath that gaze. "You're still so gorgeous in the mornings."
, he frowned and held his phone out for Natasha to see. "I didn't get anything like these ones on my other two photos."
Steve frowns down at him though, which only makes it more confusing. "Last booking is the first weekend of October, so we'd be looking at-"
"Just doing some tune ups." Tony spoke down into his lap, pulling the pinhole screwdriver from behind his ear and twisting it into one of the metal fingers. His eyes narrowed on his work and he seemed to disregard Steve all together as he continued fiddling.
"Oh, yeah. She really is good for me." Tony finds himself smiling at the thought of Pepper. "I honestly don't know where I'd be without her."
Tony's entire body felt like was on fire as he committed the scene to memory, and strong hands were tangled in his hair, pulling and pushing and using him. He couldn't hold the moan that vibrated through his mouth, causing Steve to make sounds that Tony prayed he would never forget, and then the rough vulnerable voice asked Tony to stop, asked him to come closer.
"What?" Tony asked, genuinely confused, but absolutely needing to see where this went. "You're going to need to explain what my layer of rich is, please."
Tony opened his mouth to reply but quickly closed it, looking somewhat like a stunned guppy, and Steve took that as answer enough, cupping Tony's face in his hands before catching the brunettes lips with his own. The kiss was slow and gentle, and eventually Tony came out of his daze and kissed back.
Excuses, were excuses, were excuses. But that's all Tony had to fall back on. They fall quiet, and for a few seconds Tony thinks perhaps Natasha had fallen asleep, and he'd be able to escape this conversation.
"What's that supposed to mean?" Steve could feel the lines forming in his forehead, his eyebrows knotting together as he looked around the room. "Where is Tony?"
"Don't struggle you'll make this harder for yourself."
"Then you should fit right in." Pepper teased.
Tony wasn't sure if he was the right person to be answering this, but she clearly didn't have anywhere else to go, and he couldn't just send her on her way alone, and stressed. Cold feet was a serious issue, he hadn't had to deal with it himself, but love, Tony liked to think he had at least experienced love, even if it wasn't everlasting.
"Oh," is all Bucky says before he's throwing his arm around Sam's shoulders with a laugh. "I'd apologize but I have bigger issues right now." And like that, Bucky is looking back at Tony. "I hear you spent the night with my wife."
"Amateurs." Tony scoffed, moving around the bar into the living room and taking the remote from Bruce, and escaping Steve.
"It was more than that." Tony said glancing to James, or Bucky, or however he was supposed to refer to him in this timeline of events, wondering how much Steve ever shared with his best friend. "Steve was my first love " he admitted painfully, watching as Bucky's eyes immediately dropped to the floor, confirming he at least knew that much. "and then he broke my heart."
"Save it for your therapists." Natasha quickly cut in, but she's laughing, light and easy. This time, neither Steve nor Tony could be upset at her. It was one of those things where no one was supposed to know, but everyone on the Team knew, on some level. Some, Natasha, more than others.
"I brought you home last night." Steve offered, reaching into the fridge to grab some water. "You don't remember anything?"
"You were so young." Natasha laments, flipping to the next page, Bucky's curiosity had got the best of him, and he had moved to look over her shoulder.
"So, should I do it?" he finally asked, knowing full well she hadn't heard much of anything he had just spewed out.
He was on the mend after catching a falling building with his body - you're welcome citizens of New York. And sure his leg was in a cast, and his ribs hurt any time he moved, but he was doing O.K.
Steven pulled back from the breath-taking kiss, leaving a small peck under her chin as he once again lowered himself on her. Her body quivering under him, ready and in anticipation.
James, by his side, while fixing his own dress just shrugged: "I think they can't remember, they're humans". The last bit wasn't said without a pinch of contempt.
Toni's brain short-circuited "aaah s-shit~".
Toni stared into her eyes for long until Steven stepped behind her, gently taking her coat off: "my mother, Sarah Rogers, head of the family before me"
Once again Steve was brought back from his thoughts: "pardon me?"
The vampire laid her down on the dark sheets, the red of her dress popping out amongst that darkness.
Christmas music was already playing through the dorm room, a nice smell of freshly baked cinnamon rolls could be smelt even from outside the door, on the ceiling there were garlands and lights, even a mistletoe just above the kitchen door. Rhodey hummed along to the music, getting the food ready on the table; slowly the tiny house was filled with people chatting happily and drinking beers while talking about the holidays and what people was going to do back home with their families.
Steve needed someone who loved him head to toes. Who cherished him in a way that Tony wasn't capable of.
The vampire kissed everywhere he left a mark, soft attentions that could have passed through as apologies, but they were actually little prizes for the blond’s ego.
"So that was how I got into MIT at the young age of fifteen"
The majority of the guests had already left, which let Tony have some space as he sat on a stool at the corner bar. He signaled the bartender to pour him another whiskey; he held his chin up with his palm while his other hand played with the small umbrellas that were meant for drinks.
A loud gasp and a giggle escaped from her lips when the tall man lifted her up into his arms, kissing her deeply, pushing his tongue inside her mouth.
Tony was all in in everything he did. That was why he couldn't let himself love like this...not with Steve risking his life every day, or even worse HIM risking to leave Steve alone. God only knew how loyal Steve was when he was committed to something, or someone. Anthony wasn't going to leave him mourn him forever and never moving on.
Steven just shrugged and headed to the door of the big palace that held the event: Stark Tower.
Steven stared at him for a moment before handing him the beer with a stern look: "Not for me. If it is for you then alright...you can go".
"I still don't get why they bother, don't they know we don't appear in pictures?"
The three of them grinned in unison.
Tony gasped out loud: “pleasepleasepleasepleaseSteve!”, he clenched a fist in Steve’s hair as he was desperate to get fucked and fucked good. Tony had always been so loud in bed and his husbans loved it. Steve brought his head back up, holding his tongue out against Tony’s tip, teasing it some more before leaving it and nuzzle the shaft down, towards the perineum. The genius was a panting mess, way too sensitive already because of the plug and Steve’s actions, he willingly lift his legs up onto the other’s shoulders, moaning when that damned perfect tongue teased against the plug and circled around it. “Come on Steve…come on come on”, he begged with soft whines and rolling his hips to get any kind of friction anywhere on his body. Captain America licked around, kneeling up in an odd position with his head down and ass up undoing his belt with frantic hands, he lapped at Tony’s hidden spot grunting and moaning lowly, moas muffled by being under Tony’s legs. Releasing a contented sigh as soon as he was able to pull his length out he knelt up, pushing his lover’s legs down, bending him in half and swifting closer, shaft in one hand pumping it red and hot: “slick it up baby boy…c’mon show papa how you like it”.
Steve groaned loudly against her soft skin: "it's so good...you taste so good Toni".
"I've had worse nights, I hope you don't mind going out of this place. The party is gonna be way longer than I can bear"
He moved closer on the bed, kicking off his shoes and unzipping the dress lower and lower until her back was fully displayed: the top of her ass was gracefully decorated by the black lace of her thong.
Toni blinked, stunned by the fast answer, her lips curling upwards
"...yeah exactly! And Pepper tried to convince me not to do it! But look at me now! Perfectly fine and winner of the hardest bet ever!"
"And James Buchanan Barnes, it's a pleasure to have you here, please have a drink"
The vampire only grinned, leaning in himself, their noses inches apart: "I would make you obey". The tone in his voice lowered, his voice vibrating against her. She shifted on her seat, never leaving his eyes and she leaned back tossing her long, dark curls behind her
Tony moaned more and nodded frantically, leaving Steve’s lips to mumble helplessly: “readyreadyreadyplease”. And so Steve obliged: with one hand he held his own base pushing inside, carefully slow not to hurt the other who was already begging to go faster. Captain America moaned out as he rolled his hips inside, snapping in sharply to bury himself inside completely. Iron man gasped out loud: “YES!”; he gripped the front of his husband’s uniform to haul himself up, biting at Steve’s jugular and ripping some buttons open. wanting to feel Steve’s strong chest under his hands.
"If you'll excuse me, Steven, this game of stares can continue later. How about you meet me outside in an hour?"
It was not that heavy, still it was a nice challenge for him to bring the gift inside his dorm, he left it by the door not wanting to break something in it. After that he noticed the time: "ugh fuck", he grumbled and decided to just get ready for sleep.
She just mumbled in agreement, another moan slipped out of her mouth when she felt the soft and damp fabric of the towel Steve was using on her.
And of course, if they could eat, they would.
His ministrations were accompanied by chants emitting from Toni's mouth of "yes, please, more, Steve". Their kiss was hungry, teeth clicking as he tasted inside her mouth with his lingue tongue, pushing against the inside of her cheek.
Steve stared at the other guy with a quizzing face: was he even serious? That didn't sound like a plan on first instance and...who would have laughed at that?
The brunet planted his cheek better against Steve's pectoral, listening to his heart beat as he looked at the sun coming up. What was he going to do...
"What are you doing in a box in a dorm room!", Steve raised his voice back the other
“How long?”, asked Steve with a feral growl”How long what?”, Tony, the teaser, knew exactly what Steve implied”How long”, Captain America held back a moan, “how long have you been wearing this?”, and there he proved his point by poking at the very bright, captain america themed, butt plug that was stretching Tony’s sweet spot. ”All day long my Captain…kept thinking about you all day…”, the answer satisfied him enough that the supersoldier got to work like a man on a mission.
"Fuck-", she scratched down his sculpted chest, squeezing in awe at his bulked muscles.
His hand kneaded her right breast, feeling the hard nipple underneath her dress. He pulled back slurping her blood away from his fangs, licking enthusiastically.
James smiled back to Steve and nodded: "I'm sorry Steve, have a good study night.
Toni turned to see Steve hanging her coat. She uncharacteristically felt out of place: she was used to being the centre of attention, this wasn't her first time going to a man's home without knowing him well.
She was just raw meat at her butcher’s mercy.
"That's the whole point!"
Around midnight the loud bell rang shaking Steve out of his concentration bubble. He stretched and slowly turned to the door: who could have been at this time?
Steve let out a soft laugh as he gently bumped his shoulder into Tony's, but he didn't comment. Instead he focused on the old garage, pulling a key from his pocket as they came up to it. "I feel a little silly showing you this-" Steve spoke as he fiddled with the lock. "-But it was one of the few things I've always wanted and you're part of the reason I have it."
“All scans read Captain Rogers.”
"Like seriously, anything, a single doom bot, a spelling error in a report  literally anything-" Tony  adds, just begging for an excuse not to go to work.
"One time." Tony spoke to the ceiling simply annoyed with the current situation "You accidentally forget explosives in your pocket one time." He pushed himself away from the island, checking his watch for the time. "Anyways, I'd love to stay and chat but-"
"I Don't-" Tony starts but before he knows it Natasha has his phone on speakerphone and a lovely recorded voice is informing him she's about to play the first new message.
Tony smirks to himself as he continues pressing soft kisses to the back of Steve's shoulder, slowly making his way to the back of his neck. Steve is silent again, so Tony slides himself down the bed, leaving a trail of kisses down Steve's spine, it's not until he gets to the curve of Steve's ass that the other man shifts.
They take the first few steps in silence and then Tony does something he didn't know he had the guts to do, and he reaches over and laces his fingers in Steve's as they walk. He still manages to keep looking forward, towards the barn, trying his best not to make a big deal of it all, but also hoping on some level Steve understands the motion, and what he means.
"Oh please." Pepper fondly rolled her eyes, though her smile did reappear. "we both know I do not require your help, what is wrong?"
"Well you know, weapons haven't always been my forte." Tony joked as he turned on the taps to wash his hands, Steve did know. Steve had spent many nights up with him discussing the pros and cons of one day taking over Stark Industries, back then it was all cons. "Though I'm sure if Howard knew he'd be dying all over again."
, and Fury was not going to let them out until they were finished.
"No."  Steve replies with a chuckle.
Tony decided Clint is a total shit. And he really likes him.
"That was bad." Tony chuckles, but it doesn't stop him from hooking his now free finger into Steve's collar and pulling him in for a kiss.
"Shut up." Steve all but growls, and then hes wrapping his hands around Tony's head and crashing their lips together and pushing their bodies together and- oh- oh -that's what this is. Tony's hands drop to Steve's waist, there's a clasp in there somewhere that undoes those stupid combat pants, he should know he helped update them when the spandex became a little too outdated. Soon Steve's hands are there, helping Tony unbuckle his pants and as soon as they're open, he's shoving Tony's hand into them like hes desperately starved for touch. And who is Tony to deny such a beautiful thing.
Steve glanced down at his shirt "Yeah, is that a problem?"
Steve takes photos of the Avengers at dinner, and ones where Clint's middle fingers are up because he's slipped and fallen again (it really is a running gag on his Instagram, the followers love it.), He has photos of Thor mid bite, and ones of Tony working in his shop, ones of Tony smirking beside a fancy car and - well there's a lot of Tony. But he makes sure to spread those out, most of the photos he has of Bruce are because he wanted to take one of Tony.  He has photos of Natasha, but always in group settings, always while she was looking terrifying, or strong.  Steve takes the kind of photos that have Pepper applauding him.
"Yes." Tony confirmed. "I booked my hotel room, I have a car rented from the airport, and I will greet you at the welcome dinner at seven on the dot, and I promise to not make you work even once the entire weekend." He went over his mental checklist to make sure he wasn't forgetting anything. "Are you ready?"
Steve averted his eyes and took a step away from Tony,  relieved when he caught a glimpse of boxer shorts in his peripheral  "Yeah that's probably a good idea." He rubbed the back of his neck stepping back towards the door, watching as Tony crawled into his bed.
"Uh- Yeah- Okay." Tony quickly turned towards the beer fridge, yanking it open and wishing he could fit his entire body inside of it."We got beer, soda, water - what did you want?"
"I didn't realize it was this simple." Steve says, settling back down onto his seat, and unfolding his news paper. "I just post a picture of something stupid and the world goes crazy."
"That's not true." Steve argued lamely, but his fingers twitched at his side, as if he was forcing himself not to move them, and that's all Tony could look at. The big hands that had made him feel so many things, and up Steve's muscular arms that had held him down and lifted him up, and those shoulders, where his mouth had marked what was
"Some barn that James's friend helps run." Natasha admitted with another shrug. "Or owns, I'm not sure, basically for a discount."
Tony laughed at the thought as he peered around the entrance to the barn. Steve huffed as he tossed a hay bail to the corner of the open space, not noticing Tony yet. So this is where he had disappeared to, Tony thought to himself as he stepped through the open doors. There were tables set up around the room, and chairs stacked in the corner, the same string lights from the patio lit the large structure, though there must have been hundreds lining the wood rafters. Tony twisted around as he tilted back to look up at them.
"I should probably warn Pepper." Tony mused, before taking another bite, almost reveling in the huff Steve gave him in return.
To a certain extent they were right on a few things. However, as Pepper and Maria had so eloquently put it, getting Social Media was to give the public a glimpse into the real Steve Rogers. And they were about to get that.
"It's fine, Buck made due." Steve said with a chuckle. "Besides, I believe there was a very legitimate reason for that."
Honestly, Tony didn't want to admit he was that oblivious, but when his eyes fell onto the man across the booth from him, it was painfully clear that it was not who he thought he had joined. He really needed to start paying attention to his surroundings.
It's the big day, Clint needs a favor, and Sam finally gets the hint.
"You sure Stark?" Clint called after him. "I don't think Tasha would mind, or Steve, you don't have to be a part of the rehearsal to come back."
"That would have gone well." Tony said, finally pulling his hands away from his face. "Hey Steve, I know we've struggled to play nice, and finally have some semblance of a friendship, but I find you just like, the most attractive human being on the planet, can we just go somewhere alone so I can see you naked and maybe kiss you or whatever, you know - Oh yeah- that would have gone -."
The seat beside him, always saved for Tony. Tony who really only started showing up to these things to sit beside Steve, Tony who only ever made popcorn for a chance to share it with Steve - it was so pathetic - but entirely worth it.
"Don't be so dramatic Stark." Natasha released Tony's arms, sitting up but not getting off of him. "By not getting married you're going to fuck it up worse than anything else you could ever do."
"I don't even know you." The stranger replied, but there was a slight blush coming over the collar of his shirt, and the fear had mostly subsided from his face.
Tony realized only then that he had been staring, but he didn't care to hide it. "Nothing." he answered instead. "Just admiring the view." he had to chuckle at Steve's exasperated eye roll before adding. "Are Sam and Sharon coming to this dinner? Do we know if they're still banging?"
"Tony?"
"Or-" Pepper said with a soft nod. "You keep a hard line drawn and you let them think whatever they want to think."
"Oh." Steve's voice was soft as he looked over to the brunette, though his eyes didn't linger. Of course Tony looked normal, it was like a Stark Superpower to look healthy and happy, even when suffering. "How are you feeling?"
Sam spun Steve away from the bar and steered him towards the couch."Hey man are you wearing a button up to movie night?"
"I'm sure she's going to regret not taking it away from you entirely." Tony muses, dropping himself down into the empty space beside his boyfriend. "I'm not really dressed for a photo right now though, babe-"
Tony's eyebrow quirked as he tucked the dirty rag into the back pocket of his black jeans. "Is that what you're doing? Tolerating my friendship?"
"That's enough Instagram for one night." Tony says with a laugh, plucking Steve's phone out of his hand, and stuffing it behind himself on the couch.
------
"I fold." Tony tossed his cards down, before joining Sam at the bar.
"Something the matter, Cap?" Tony greeted, as Steve stepped into the workshop doors, the laptop firmly pressed into his chest.
"Oh I was just telling Tony how drunk he was last night." Natasha smirked around her piece of toast, obviously catching Tony trying desperately not to stare at Steve.
Neither Steve nor Tony know how long they're distracted for when Natasha slides into the shop. In fact, they don't even know how long she's been there, leaning up against the door frame.  They don't even know she's there until she speaks.
"Oh lord." and Rhodey was for sure grinning into his phone right now because his voice was laced in it. "How bad was it?"
"- Oh
So it wasn't a surprise to him when she said no, only curling further into his pillow. It still didn't leave him with anything smart to say. So he did the only thing he could think of, he crawled into the bed next to her. "What's wrong?"
Natasha tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. "I think Steve has a crush on Tony."
"Exactly." Natasha pointed out, crossing her arms. "Are you ready for the trip?"
"It was one time!" Bruce protested from the couch, but holding the remote up in the air nevertheless so Tony could come grab it from him.
"Uh. Thanks Tasha" Steve grinned at the girl as she took her seat, waiting until she was speaking to Clint to lean over "That was awkward." He whispered to Tony at his side.
"I need a picture of this." Tony replied. "For Pepper's sake." he justified, ignoring how Natasha rolled her eyes at him.
"Oh God." Steve says with a laugh, thankfully being saved by the beeping of the microwave. "Look I took a photo with Natasha this morning-"
Once again their fingers are laced, and Steve leads him out of the barn, and it feels again like that first night at the farm, but this time Tony is absolutely sober, and there's no fog clouding his thoughts or decisions.
He tucked down the news paper beside his cup and then got a brilliant idea, and Steve took his first Instagram photo. It was simple, the news paper next to his white mug against the marble countertop.  He fiddled around with the small boxes, changing the way the photo looked before he posted it, leaving the caption blank. It immediately caused his phone to go nuts, if it was going to be this easy, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.  This, he could do, and maybe Tony could teach him how to turn off the notifications, then it would be perfect.
"We have spoke to someone close to the couple and-"
Natasha had been with Stark Industries for nearly three years, when Tony first met her, she was working with Legal, helping them sort paper work and fax contracts. Nothing exciting, in fact the only reason he even noticed her was because of the way she looked. Any red blooded american, male or female, would tell you that Natasha was gorgeous. Of course she was so much more than that, but Tony was not above admitting it was the first thing he had noticed. When Pepper moved up to CEO, Tony needed someone to take her place.
Tony rolled his eyes, hands idly playing with his cuffs. "Pepper, I know what you're going to say but don't. I can't do this."
"I wanted to say that I love you, and I have for gosh, a year now-" Steve turned his attention back to Tony, who couldn't help but meet the blue eyes with his own. "I've hidden a lot of myself from the people most important to me for a long time and I don't want to do that anymore. You accepted me, you've loved me and cared for me, and fuck the people that think you are somehow a bad influence over me - I fought in the war, I grew up in Brooklyn for Christs sake, Tony Stark is amazing, and I'm the lucky one who gets to call him my boyfriend, and I'm done with hidin"
"Stop making sense and being likable." Steve huffed, pretending he didn't notice the space that had suddenly grown between them. "It's so
Pepper paused but only for a second, she leaned in and placed a kiss to Tony's cheek, the soft smile turning into a bright one. "Now pay attention to me, are you listening?"
"Yeah." Steve confirmed with a roll of his eyes. "I Swear to God it's like a kicked a puppy or burned a flag the way everyone's reacting, but what's that got to do with.. You..."
"I don't doubt that." Steve replies dryly, scrunching his nose and criticizing his own work, like he always used to do.
"If you stop pacing you might cool down"
"If I warned you, you probably would have told me it was a bad idea." Steve admitted, rightfully so.
e the general population.
"I don't know." Steve shook his head, because he really didn't. "The problem is, I - uh." He hesitated and it caused Tony to tear his eyes away from his paper. His eyes were soft, but his face was weird, like he was worried to hear the answer, and Steve made a mental note to try and place it, because it was a new one. Nervous and sad at the time time, and just enough of a put off to force Steve to finish his sentence. "Everyone wants to date Captain America, but no one wants to date Steve."
“Come inside, Steve.” Tony ran his hands up and down his bare arms, feet inching backwards, eyes pleading.
Steve could barely resist those big brown eyes, or his usage of the word
The photo was Steve, and Natasha, both covered in sweat, although Natasha's was more of a light glow - she never looked terrible after a workout - in front of the sparring mats. Steve was smiling, wide with his head tilted towards Natasha, who, was not smiling, but still managed to look rather pleased as she stood next to Steve.
"They wont take these back, so now I have to figure out what to do with a bunch of orange lilies." Clint sighed, looking down at the flowers. "She wanted roses."
Pepper must have noticed the way Steve looked even more confused at that statement and explained. "The public isn't sure what to make of any of you. To them, you guys are mysteries. Having a social media presence gives them a peek into your real life, it lets the public see that you are just like them."
"But are you sure you don't want to come?"
"And if you don't know, she's not going to tell you." Tony sighed, as if speaking from experience, and he may have been, before nudging Steve's legs, silently asking him to shove over, which he did, allowing Tony to squish himself into the newly opened couch space. "Why don't we start with what you were trying to do?"
"Go, be free." Tony waved his hand in the space between them. "Escape before I change my mind, you have a flight to catch."
"Ah Right." Clint nodded. "The little office explosion incident. That poor girl, no wonder you cycle through receptionists like shirts."
"Yeah." Tony says with a nod, and he means it, he's drunk sure, but not too far gone, not yet. He had learned his limits a long time ago with Pepper.
Tony's eyebrows came together before he looked at Natasha, confused. "Is he trying to insult me or compliment me?"
It's enough of an answer for Steve though, because Tony is empty again, and his hips are being guided upwards until he can feel the wet tip of Steve replacing the fingers there just moments before. Tony knows as he eases down that he's in control now, and it's Steve's turn to moan out his name.
"Captain Dorito, Sexy Spangles - Oh Tony Stark's Wet Dr-"
"Hey!" Bucky protested.
"I didn't realize this would bring Stark Industries-" Steve tried, but Pepper huffed out and her vision shifted to the television behind Steve's head.
"Yeah Yeah." Tony came to a hover just above the ground "Slight malfunction wing head, I'm good."
Sam just shrugged and waved a hand, inviting him to do just that, so Steve did. He closed the app and quickly pressed on Tony's contact.
"Ironman, number sign, one." Tony held up a dirty finger, demonstrating that he did in fact mean the number one.
Steve couldn't help himself as he laughed, more so from nerves, than Sam's joke, but he didn't need to know that. Instead he looked down at his phone, looking back at the photo before finally hitting the post button.
There was an innuendo in there somewhere, but Steve couldn't place it. "Well since we're being honest." He straightened himself up on his feet. "I sometimes don't sleep very well either, the whole plane crash, frozen alive in ice thing, you know."
"I can't." Tony grabbed at his chest, dropping down suddenly into a crouch. "I can't do this."
Steve eyed Tony for a blip before finally giving in and letting the anger leave him with a sigh. "Fine, but you need to stop that."
"Do you want to go to bed?" Steve asked, continuing soft finger twists in Tony's hair as he spoke.
"Are you confirming that you are not in fact dating Captain America?" The woman asked, a disappointed look in her face.
Tony had rounded up the household and managed to stick them all in a room for movie night. There had been groaning and moaning from several people, no one wanted to watch any more Lord of the Rings, and Don't even say Star Wars one more time if you want to keep your life Tony -  he had shrugged them all off, handing out bowls of popcorn and cans of soda, forcing everyone to give up their arguments.
"I am not." Sam pushed himself out of his seat, going to the bar and grabbing himself another beer. "I just know when it's not worth my time or my money to keep going."
Steve peered up into the sky, catching the gold and red armor as it flew above him catching the sunlight in its shiny surface. "I have an idea but," Steve smirked. "Shell head I need a lift."
"Did you even hear what it is I wanted to do?" he asked with a questioning eyebrow.
Steve rolled his eyes, he had heard non-stop about hoe great the new Stark Phone was, since it had been released to the public a few months ago, but he was already trying to live with change, he didn't need new change to his change already. "Can you help me with this phone, or not?"
"-I like cock?" Tony finished the sentence with a shrug, oblivious to how red Steve was beginning to turn next to him. "Love is love, Sex is sex." Tony waywardly moved his hand in front of him trying to articulate "I just like getting laid Rogers, get with the times."
"I see someone's been having a lot of fun with Instagram." Tony steps into the kitchen, loosening the tie around his neck, shooting a smirk at Steve.
"Oh, Sweetie." Pepper sighed into the receiver. "What's happening? are you coming home?"
"Then how did you miss the part where I said I was going out to support my friend-"
"No." Bruce pushed his glasses up his nose, catching a nod from Natasha. "But I'm sure we'll hear about it later."
"Of course I will." Steve confirms, his eyebrows furrowing together. "Tony, the only reason I stayed here is because I didn't think I had anywhere else to be. If you want me in New York-"
It was a statement, and a bold one, causing Tony to almost trip on his own feet, startled. Hesitating in what to do, the wind howled as it curved around the buildings.
"I know." Tony replied with a smirk as he grabbed the bowl of popcorn right out of Steve's hands.
