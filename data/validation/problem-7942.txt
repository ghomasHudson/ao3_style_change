Slowly, Tony heaved himself out of bed, careful to not disturb the Prime as he wobbled into the bathroom. A warm bath was in order to relax his muscles and clean off his sweat-dried skin. It took a bit to get himself undressed and into the tub, but as soon as he sank into the steaming water he sighed in bliss, almost instantly relaxed. He closed his eyes and let his mind wander as he soaked, testing out the new bond that filled his heart. It was like a heavy rock had been forced into the organ, taking up space that it was not meant to fill. However, it was not uncomfortable, and when he concentrated on it, he felt warm and tingly, like he was sitting in front of a fire on a cold night.
“You okay, darling? I cleaned you, changed you, you were not fed too long ago… gods, I probably smell stressed to you and am making you upset…I know, I know. I have no need to be worried, he will be fine and this awful day will be behind us. Then, all of us can spend time together as one big family. Would you like that? I bet you would.”
Peter merely wiggled his legs until he was cradled in Tony’s arms again. He quickly grasped a handful of his new dress and stuck it in his mouth, idly gumming the fabric. Tony knew he should probably take it out of his mouth, but Steve was walking toward them with a plate of food and the smell of something spicy easily distracted him.
to do that, I had
“…Yes?” Steve repeated, pursing his lips then nodding, “Yes, Peter.”
Tony nodded and craned his neck to look around him, relaxing once Thor had moved. He watched Bruce and Steve with as much concentration as he could muster up, trying to focus on what Bruce was showing Steve. He figured he was demonstrating how to hold the baby, but then Bruce pointed toward the bathroom and they began to move. Tony tried to protest, making a distressed noise and shifting in the bed to get their attention.
Tony read each page aloud to the boy, making sure he kept the book wide open so PJ could see the pictures. Sure, turning the pages with one hand was a little difficult, but he managed, making sure to do voices for each of the characters, as Maria had done when he was a boy.
Steve gave him a weak smile and nodded, starting to push Tony down toward the garage. He chose one of Tony’s favorite Audis to take, first helping Tony into the passenger seat before tossing the folded-up chair in the back. He slid into the driver’s seat and turned on the car, looking over to try and give Tony a comforting smile. As soon as he met Tony’s concerned eyes, Steve burst into a heaving sob, easily moving when Tony pulled him across the median with one arm.
“Tony, why?” He sighed one morning, looking at the square, red toy in his hand, “What is this?”
“I--sorry, sorry. I do not understand what you need,” Tony said shakily as he forced himself to move back to the bars, where Steve could touch him.
you can get up on it, eager mcbeaver.”
Sighing loudly, Bruce rolled his eyes, helping Tony to lay the boy down on the table. He grabbed up a sweater he usually kept on his lab chair, balling it up to make him a makeshift pillow.
Alpha.”
“Talk to Sam,” Rhodey said gently, reaching over to squeeze Bucky’s shoulder, “Thankfully, he can’t read minds, but that does mean that if you want something you have to ask for it.”
why not.”
The boy responded by tapping Steve’s hand, starting to walk away. Tony watched as the two left, an unfamiliar warmth filling his chest. He sat down on PJ’s bed, picking up the tear-and-snot-stained elephant to clean off with a tissue. Sighing softly, he looked at the plush animal, tilting his head.
“Okay darling, daddy’s all finished, I can pay attention to you now,” he soothed, leaning back in his chair to properly cradle the baby up against his chest, “You had your meal, you were changed, cleaned…. what else does one little babe need, hm?”
“Point taken,” Tony sighed, joining the hunt for information.
“Who gives a fuck, its food,” Bruce muttered, taking the first portion, “Just eat.”
“Me?”
Tony immediately perked up at that, shyly looking up at Steve with a smile. He nodded, and with a soft voice, started to walk Steve through understanding his bigger times tables. It seemed like they only worked for a few minutes when Miss Hill called for a snack break, so Steve hurried up to turn his booklet in, leaving Tony to go to their cubby to dig out his lunchbox. Mother had packed him blueberries and a juice box for a snack, which made him smile because blueberries were his favorite. He returned to his seat, only to notice that Steve didn’t have a snack. Without prompting, he slid over his cup of blueberries, even going so far as to hold one out for Steve to take from his fingers.
he told himself, dragging his eyes away from Steve to go look out the window.
“Don’t put this on you, J. It’s always been them. Howard, in particular, but them. Never you. You did what you thought was right,” Tony mumbled, voice breaking.
Tony had just stuck his tongue out at him, only to shriek when Steve tried to give him a sloppy kiss. They’d laughed and rolled off of the couch in a tangle of limbs, giggling to each other as they settled into their new position. That was six months ago, the night after they’d officially moved in together for the last few months of high school before he headed off to MIT and Steve returned to training. Steve kept him on top of his new anxiety medication, he nagged Steve into doing his daily journaling, and they were content being together.
“I know. I know, sweetheart. I’m here. I’m right here, my love. I’m safe, I’m not going to leave you,” Tony whispered, rubbing Steve’s back one-handed and tucking his face into Steve’s neck, “Everything is going to be okay, baby. I promise. Nothing is going to take me away from you. Never again. I won’t let them, my love.”
“Back when I was a tot and still able to sit on my mother’s knee, she let me help her take care of any of the children that came to the castle. She taught me how to hold them and soothe them, especially when it came to Omegas. She had me think about my happiest memories, my favorite sweets, and other things of that nature. I do not remember if she told me the reason as to why I was supposed to do that… I would have been too young to understand it anyway.”
“Easy, little rabbit,” Steve said quietly as he put a hand on Tony’s back to comfort him, “I would not want to take you into war now anyway; first because you are Peter’s only parent, and second because I want to train you for battle myself. It will take time for you to learn, and in the meantime, Peter will grow old enough for us to consider an assault on Ma’atan.”
Tony whooped again and spun the vehicle around, pressing buttons like he was playing Pac-Man to bring up and fire the vehicle’s machine guns. Thankfully, JARVIS’ auto-aim system made the fight easy, and it only took a few seconds before the riders fell from the sky.
Finally able to go to PJ, Tony faltered as he saw the kid, small and frail in the large hospital bed. Seeing that they had put a cannula on him, he let out a sigh, almost collapsing into a chair next to the bed.
“That hurts.”
“Steve’s. He’s Steve’s,” he heard himself say.
, was written in erasable marker on the bottom, still in Jarvis’ handwriting.
“Love you! Love you!” PJ yelled in the background, making Steve burst into laughter.
He set the boy down and took his hand again, unsurprised that Pepper smoothly slid into the elevator with them. PJ grasped Tony’s slacks, risking a few glances at her before burying his face in Tony’s legs.
“Agreed. Can we put our suits back on? As much as I love naked cuddling, I’m cold.”
“Wake
“Yes, he did, but I was expecting it,” He answered carefully, “He’s a kid who’s been through rough shit. Of
He had not realized that he had begun to cry again until Bruce reached over and wiped the tears from his face. Humiliated, Tony ducked his head, glaring at his bed furs when a gentle hand laid on his shoulder.
He heard his tone and blinked, then cleared his throat and spoke again.
Bruce seemed a bit surprised, but he muttered a ‘you’re welcome’ and hightailed it out of the room. Tony watched him leave, only to turn his gaze to Steve’s clouded one.
Pepper shot him a withering look at that, but Tony shrugged, shaking his head.
Tony snorted and rolled his eyes, but there was some truth to the statement. Howard would pay his way out of an untimely end and step on anyone to crawl out of the pit. It meant they need to not only prepare for war but an all-out bloodbath.
Which meant Tony had promptly forgotten the warning. And the provisions.
“He requested to atone in the ancient fashion. Alphas that mistreated their Omegas were beaten by their mates until the Omega felt as though they had suffered as they had,” Thor explained, tilting his head, “Since he cannot understand me, I find it pertinent to tell you that I do not agree with his methods. He is quite stubborn at times and can be dramatic when wanting to prove himself. If you wish to agree to his atonement, though, I will not stop you.”
An Alpha and an Omega walk into a room...
Tony grumbled to himself as Steve grabbed the ointment from the medical supplies, unhappy with the fact that the Warlord is right. Together, they trooped back out to the bedroom and Tony went to lay down, until Steve grabbed his arm to stop him.
“Is this about the feeding?” Bruce asked quietly, gaining an answer through Tony’s silence, “Tony, you do not have to feed Peter from your breast, but the other option is to forcibly remove your milk from your body with a type of pump—it is quite uncomfortable and more embarrassing than anything you could be put through. If you leave it be, the milk will curdle and become quite infected. We have had Omegas die from the infection spreading.”
“Daddy blue,” PJ said firmly, “Daddy home.”
PJ looked absolutely frightened, but he patted Tony’s hand anyway, visibly trying to blink away tears in his eyes. Feeling his heart break a little more, Tony hurriedly wiped PJ’s face, immediately putting the cloth down once he was done to use the towel to dry him off.
The two went to sit, and Tony looked at the three men left and immediately felt fear crawl up his spine. He locked eyes with Natasha, who merely smirked, winking back at him.
“PJ.”
“Let’s do it, then.”
, Tony.”’
“No, Buck, that’s alright,” he said, “I’ll try later myself. Thanks.”
“Are you hungry?” Thor asked next to his ear, nearly startling him, “After your audience, I will see to it that you and the young one are fed.”
. In general, most people are nervous to be around you, just because you have such an expansive personality and light up the room—”
“Please, I want it, I want you so badly,” he begged, “I want to feel you split me open,
“I’m about to get meaner, too. You’re on bedrest for at least a week to give those ribs time to heal.”
“Good work, kiddo,” he panted, crawling back to grab the guard, “Let’s give him a one-two, yeah?”
“What?”
“You should have asked me earlier, Captain. I can simply phase the bullets out,” Vis said, dumping them into Steve’s palm and phasing out of the shower.
, not beat each other raw like a bunch of savages. I expect better from you,
He pushed hard on the wall, grinning behind the mask as a false door sunk into the wall and moved to the side, revealing a staircase lit with emergency lights. As he stepped back, Natasha and Clint quickly took up their positions in the front, silently descending the staircase. At the bottom, they regrouped, watching Natasha as she surveyed their surroundings. Once she began to move, the others followed, careful to check behind themselves often.
“Relatively speaking, there is good news. There is no sign of invasive torture like we tend to see with most children in these cases,” The nurse said, placing the clipboard on the bed for Tony to pick up and look at, “He’ll still need some forms of therapy, though. There’s no doubt he has been through a lot, and it will take him a long time to recover…but, if there’s anyone who can help this boy, it’s definitely you, Mr. Stark.”
Tony nodded back, looking down at the packet in his hands; he already knew the content inside and out, too damaging to even attempt to scrub from his psyche. Looking back up to Clint, he saw the usually steady archer’s hands shake, and he knew it was enough.
“Hey. You with me?” Tony asked quietly, crouching down, “Steve? Can you pick your head up for me, baby doll?”
They had worked more solid foods into the toddler’s diet, but mornings were Daddy and Peter time, and Tony could not help but feel a wave of loss each time he thought about Peter being fully weaned. He wanted his boy to stay little and innocent and not privy to the world, but they all had to grow up eventually. Right now, though, he was still a tot, so Tony tried to focus on being in the moment. As soon as he finished dressing he crawled back up on the bed and laid down on his back, holding his arms out. Peter giggled and crawled up to him, plopping himself down next to him at chest-level.
“Well, yeah. It’s
Tony was nearly inconsolable as he frantically yelled, his arms held back by Steve to keep from shaking the boy any more. He watched as PJ’s eyes finally snapped open, consciousness and fear evident on his small face. His tiny body was shivering, despite the mountains of blankets covering him. Turning his head, PJ made eye contact with Tony, only to burst into howling tears, scrambling back until he hit the wall.
“Gods, Tony,” Steve managed, tossing his head back, “Oh,
A sharp scream surprised them both as PJ ripped his hand away from Tony’s hold, clutching it to his chest. Tears easily formed in his eyes and he screamed again when Tony tried to reach out for him.
“Shhh,” Steve shushed from Tony’s side, reaching up blindly to wave his hand at the others, “Tired. Sleep.”
The Prime brought Peter up to kiss his forehead, thus missing Tony’s face flush with embarrassment. He crossed his arms and looked away as an ache built in his chest.
Shocked by himself, Steve’s eyes widened, his mouth open slightly as he realized what he had said. Tony stared at him, a hundred thoughts running through his mind.
should be behaving, that is all. I do not want to offend him, nor anger him—”
“Once he finds us, he will feel better, darling. I would run to him, but I do not think my legs could stand it,” Tony admitted, moving Peter back down into a cradle so he could poke the babe’s button nose.
“O-okay, good,” Steve wheezed, leaning his weight back onto Tony, “Yeah. Feels…less tight.”
“In an old house in Paris, all covered with vines, lived twelve little girls in two straight lines. The smallest one was Madeline. See? That’s her, with the red hair.”
. Steve’s, what, twenty-six? From his file, he doesn’t exactly have good relationship experience. He always talks about how before the serum, the girls would pick Bucky and not him,” Pepper chided gently, “It’s a sore spot for him. He probably thought you did it on purpose.”
“Perfect,” he whispered, giggling as he watched Tony look at the ring, then at him, then back at the ring, holding it up to the light.
More specifically, he meant finding Thor’s estranged younger brother who always managed to have drugs somewhere on his person, always ready to offer up a price. Usually, Tony wasn’t one for drugs since they lowered his inhibitions and made it difficult for him to think, but if he was going to get slammed on his bruises by Hank McCoy’s legendary outside kicks, he needed something to numb his—
Rhodey complained and Steve looked mildly shamed, but Tony ignored them and headed over to Bruce’s table, sitting across from the doctor so his back was to the Alphas. He winked and Bruce smiled, ducking his head in thanks.
“Oh, thank the gods,” Bruce muttered, shoving Pete into Tony’s arms, “I am going back to sleep.”
“Maybe it’s best if he knows now,” he offered, moving to stand a little closer to him, “Tony, he’s not going to hurt you, or PJ. He’ll probably be overwhelmed, but we all are. You can’t hide this from him and PJ doesn’t know any better. If you really want to keep him, it’d be best to identify who his immediate family is first. And that includes Steve. Besides, even if you
“He doesn’t,” Steve said from where he was strapped in, his head resting on his fist as he stared at the two men, “He has no idea what he’s doing. But it’s not like anyone else here knows either. It seems right to defer to the smartest in the room for the next course of action.”
“—I have plenty of balls—”
“Hell yeah I could,” Tony murmured, smirking at Rhodey’s pained look, “Yeah, you walked into that one.”
“Come play with us.”
team building exercises, and more specifically, he hated Clint’s ideas. Having to play
“Hi.”
A familiar face and a car chase.
“Baby, honey,
He switched languages and explained what was happening to Rhodey, giving him another hug before sending him on his way with Natasha. They disappeared around the corner, and Tony found his mouth being attacked, with Steve’s hands eagerly grabbing his hips to pull him closer.
“Not at all. I am much stronger than I look, doll. Let yourself go for a bit.”
“Oh gods, I am
Though she huffed, she nodded.
hurt you. If I do not think I can be in you, I am not going to push it.”
“Shh, Steve, we’ll get there,” Tony shushed, having to set the photo album aside so he wouldn’t have to worry about it falling off of his lap, “It’s alright. We’ll get there. It might not be right away, and I’ll need time, but we’ll get there. Okay? I didn’t share my blueberries with you just to toss you on your ass.”
“Where are you going?” Tony heard himself ask, watching Steve stand as a heaviness like a stone settled in his gut.
It clearly wasn’t fine, but Bruce wasn’t about to argue, so he nodded to Steve and left, shutting the door behind him. Silently, Tony moved to turn the movie off, sitting on the floor of the room with one of the remotes in his hand. Steve waited for a minute, letting Tony work through his distraction before quietly padding over to him, sitting down next to him.
“Hey, stop that. That’s mean,” Steve said as he walked up to the group, frowning at the giggling boys, “Tony’s fine, and I think he looks good. He makes a cute sheep, and you all know it.”
“What—
“I swear to god, if you pissed in it—”
I could think of to keep in this man’s good graces, and what happens? He just up and decides to not fucking talk to me unless it’s a mission or training. No more drawing in the shop, no more personal blanket during movie nights…hell, he hasn’t even been eating that specialty butter pecan ice cream I found that he really loves. What the fuck is this? Did he think I wouldn’t notice? I notice everything, he knows this, he knows I would notice, he
“I could have told you that,” Tony muttered under his breath, slipping on his clothes once the nurse turned to grab an empty chart to start making notes.
“You can see that they are fine. You might make things worse if you wake them up, you know. Tony does not know that your damn brain came back to you and might freak out if he wakes up and you are hovering over him,” Natasha snapped.
“Do you want to go put him down now?” Bruce asked, peeking over at Peter’s sleepy face.
“Howard found us out hours after you left,” he said, “Mary’s father found her body and immediately recognized your scent and reported it to the castle. Howard organized a battalion and a plan, and it did not take long for him to receive news that you had gone North and been captured. Thankfully, it took a while for him to get the necessary men and supplies for the trip, which gave Pepper and me ample time to figure out what the hell we were supposed to do. Pepper agreed to stay in the city while I dealt with Hammer and took his place in the battalion, which you already knew. I never got word from Pepper while I was out with the men, so I assume nothing has changed since I left.”
Tony was quiet for a moment. He knew it was probably confusing to the toddler that he did not necessarily see his daddy before bed every night anymore.
“Stevie and I went to bootcamp for the summer,” he explained with a shrug, “Well, the second half, anyway. It was tough shit, but it helped me fill out. You should see him. Growth spurt kicked in at the same time, he’s a
“Go, before Bruce comes back for you. We will be okay,” He promised.
“Alright, Bruce, what do you think Thor said was your most irritating habit?” Natasha interrupted, flicking a balled-up piece of paper at Bucky.
, I will wear your
“And if you
His heart felt tight, full of unresolved conflict that he was unsure of how to begin to untangle. This new life was already suspiciously comfortable, especially with the terrifying conditions that he had to agree to: becoming a Warlord’s wife, a mother, and whatever else Steve desired of him. Would he become nothing more than a trophy of the conquered, or would he become a bargaining chip against his own people? A shiver ran down his spine at the thought, and before he could pull himself together, he must have begun to scent differently, as Steve stopped them in the hallway and bent down to sniff his neck. Tony yelped and skittered a bit, clutching Peter close and staring back at the Alpha who was clearly as surprised as he was. Steve began to speak to Thor and waved his hands around, gesturing between them.
“Further down,” he said as they continued along the creek, “Surely this empties into a basin, or a more private area in the forest--”
Fumbling with his phone, Tony hit his speed dial, impatiently tapping the composition book as he waited for the line to connect.
“That’s it, you’re okay, I got you. Maybe St—maybe Papa will even come with us and help keep you toasty warm, okay?” Tony soothed, making a face at Steve’s hesitant look, “You’re okay, honey. I got you.”
, Steve.”
“…Sweetheart?” Tony teased, turning to smile at Steve.
“Alright everyone, packets down,” he called out, taking charge as he stepped into the living room, “Yes, HYDRA is fucked up. We knew that. Now we know that they are willing to go to even higher levels of fucked up to achieve their ends. So, what’re we doing about it?”
“Ah, yes,” Steve muttered, his cheeks somehow turning a darker shade of pink, “It is your nickname, if you would like. I thought it was fitting… because you are so jumpy. Like a little rabbit.”
“And I am about to be bad by asking you to watch him for tonight,” Tony admitted, giving Bruce a sheepish smile, “Steve and I want… we--we want to have a night. To ourselves.”
He ignored Steve’s half-hearted attempt to give Peter back and stepped aside, only leaning in to make minor adjustments to his hold when he needed it. Thankfully, Steve seemed to adapt to holding the baby and slowly relaxed, even going so far as to hold him one-handed so he could pet the baby’s hair.
“You have an
“It is not my story to tell.”
“I have one question,” Steve asked quietly, voice barely a whisper.
“I know, big guy. Just a few minutes, then we’ll go back up,” Tony subvocalized, nuzzling the boy’s temple, “Okay? If you’re uncomfortable before that, tell me, and we can go up then, but I do want to see them off first.”
“I think rabbits are less horny, guys,” Bruce snorted, “You couldn’t have waited?”
He stared at the Prime, watching him pick at the fraying hem of his shirt as they walked. They were in a silent deadlock until Steve sighed and dropped his hand from his shirt.
“Sir yes sir, keep your pants on,” Steve snorted, finally backing out of the garage to speed down the road toward Stark Tower.
because Fury called. If I see that one-eyed fucker again, I’m going to rip out his other one and give him a makeshift third testicle.”
“Oh, no. Don’t pull the Rhodey card,” Tony interrupted, moving to get out of the bed as well, “I think the child’s safety is a little bit more important than mine right now.”
“Don’t worry. It’ll all work out,” She said quietly, “And if he gives you any trouble, you tell me. I will personally make sure he suffers.”
“Hey, take it easy. I just had to patch you up. You lost a bit of blood, so you’re going to be woozy.”
” Tony squeaked, giggling as Steve eagerly bent down for more hurried kisses.
, Natasha. Just--just for a minute or two. I need to make sure I did not break him any more than he already was when he got here. I could not live with myself if I hurt him.”
, not relive what you just went through. You did so well, darling, you can rest now. I’ve got you.”
“I don’t know, Barton, I thought the red squid skull on their suits was a dead giveaway,” he drawled sarcastically, blasting off to head forward into the midst of the fight.
Steve knew a dismissal when he saw one, and he was still worried about Tony, but he knew he needed time, so he pressed another kiss to Tony’s cheek and gently squeezed his bicep.
Steve coughed and waved his hand, trying to clear the cloud as he started to creep closer to the wreckage. He could feel Bucky a few steps behind him, but once he was upon the object, he drew a sharp breath.
Tony settled back against his pillows, making himself comfortable while keeping an eye on the bathroom door. After a few minutes, Steve emerged with PJ, who looked a bit happier and eagerly toddled over to try and climb back up onto the bed.
“I have no desire to be just a body for him to dump his load into. If that is all he wants from me, he can get it from any common whore out there. Otherwise, he gets to take his turn as the pretty Omega.”
“What’s wrong,
“Steve, Nat, and I thought it would be best if everyone was on the same page,” the scientist explained, nodding, “We went over the content, and of course it’s awful, but having a better understanding of the lengths HYDRA is willing to go to…”
“Classy,” Tony murmured, putting PJ’s arm back on the table.
“Breaker, breaker, this is Eagle One requesting contact, do you copy?” He said, having to bite back his giggles at hearing low swearing and a few crashes before Tony picked up.
Truth be told, he was quite exhausted from the day, despite having slept most of it away in a sick stupor. As he sat down on his bed, Tony realized he was still wearing Steve’s shirt. He picked up the hem of it and stared, but eventually he shrugged and crawled under his furs, figuring that if Steve had made no mention of it before he was welcome to still wear it. He made himself comfortable and adjusted his pillows but still felt restless, tossing and turning until Steve emerged from the bathroom. Thankfully, he had the furs tugged up enough that Steve would not have been able to see his gaze, so he was free to stare at his sculpted glutes.
Silence ticked by. Eventually, Tony turned with a questioning look on his face to see Natasha staring at the boy in the tube.
She hesitated, her concerned eyes betraying her confidence.
, Tones. I’m so glad you felt comfortable enough to tell me, er, to tell Cap that you’re pan. God, I love you, honey, you’ve come so far and I’m so proud of you.”
Not missing how drastically Steve’s face dropped, Tony held PJ a fraction closer as he turned on his heel, taking them out to the living room. Seeing as most of the Avengers had stayed to chat, they turned when they entered, causing PJ to shyly duck his head into Tony’s neck. Tony merely patted his back, ignoring the others in favor of looting through the boxes to look for goodies.
Steve cried out and bit down on Tony’s shoulder, hips stuttering up into his hand as he came on command, coating Tony’s hand and their cocks with his spunk. Tony followed right after, adding to the mess as it dripped down his knuckles and soaked into Steve’s suit underneath them. He panted heavily and wiped the sweat from Steve’s brow with his other hand, wiping his other hand on his own undersuit.
He stayed like that, watching PJ breathe in and out until he was sure that the child wouldn’t wake again. Standing with a grunt, Tony kept PJ close to his chest as he started the walk back to the Tower. He’d barely made it across the sidewalk when the snap of a twig caught his ear; holding PJ a bit tighter, Tony picked up his pace just a bit, trying not to alert whoever was out that he had heard them. Reaching for his phone, he suddenly realized he was in silk pajamas and loafers, and not at all equipped for a fight.
“The squirt looks good. You did good, Tones,” he said, “Can you untie me now?”
“Then I’m behind you. Whatever it takes, I’m with you ‘til the end of the line.”
“I noticed,” he croaked, reaching up to poke Steve’s bicep.
He moved Peter up to his chest for skin-to-skin contact, knowing that his own pheromones were souring the room, as some of the lesser Alphas had wrinkled their noses or turned away. The Prime stared at them for a few minutes, then he beckoned to Thor and began to talk rapidly, fast enough that the man could not translate in real time. One of the other Alphas in the room began to giggle but was quickly silenced with an elbow to the gut. Tony felt a bit comforted by that, stooping down to pick up his clothes and slip them back on, all while still juggling his baby. Just as he was straightening himself out, Thor turned to him, conflicting emotions betrayed in his face.
Steve merely raised a hand up to the babe’s cheek, shakily stroking his thumb over the soft skin. Then, Tony swore he saw a ghost of a smile on his lips as he pulled his hand away. Steve nodded, turned on his heel, grabbed up his shield from beside his chair and left the room as silently as he had entered. They all watched him leave before Bucky and Sam scrambled to their feet, chasing after him. Tony merely staggered backward toward the fireplace, sitting down on the raised edge of the brickwork. He carefully maneuvered PJ to be sitting in his lap, still stroking the boy’s hair with a shaky hand.
“There was no us, Steve,” Tony said flatly, the mood completely wiped out, “There
“Me,” The boy answered, sticking his arms out.
Tony groaned as he was lifted up and put onto what he assumed was a stretcher, blinking slowly up at the sun. Or flashlight. Or whatever that bright thing in his vision was.
“Yes, please. I need my lucky charm,” Tony purred, waggling his eyebrows.
“Okay, how about we fix your hair and clean the slice on your head?” He tried, “Then you can have a quick sponge bath before we go see Bruce.”
, let alone a
“I think I am okay with not knowing. It does not matter much,” Tony said, waving the question away.
He leaned down to kiss the tot’s forehead and held him close, then rocked them back and forth in a comforting manner. It would have been nice, except for the fact that he could hear the increasingly loud whispers coming from those across the room. Did they not know that it was very rude to talk about someone right in front of them? Tony thought about telling them off, but then the following silence that dampened the room sent chills down his spine. Slowly, he raised his head and found himself looking into Steve’s eyes mere inches from his face.
Steve laughed and resumed his task, having to press kisses all over Tony’s chest to distract him from the cleaning. Thankfully, the rest of him didn’t take very long to wash, and his anxiety had simmered down enough that he could stand under the shower to rinse out his hair. Once they were both dried and into new clothes and a new hospital robe, Steve picked Tony back up in his arms, ignoring his husband’s indignant grumbles. He carried Tony back to his freshly cleaned bed, unable to help himself from crawling into the bed and cuddling up.
“You’re ridiculous,” Steve murmured, leaning over to meet Tony’s lips with his own.
“Nothing! I read PJ a book, we napped, Steve came over and we talked, then the little one had a nightmare, we comforted him, and that’s all,” Tony answered, narrowing his eyes.
“Sorry,” he called, tipping his head forward to let the hot water roll down his neck and back, “Just throw that in a corner somewhere. I’ll deal with it later.”
“Has—”
“Please?”
“I’m offended,” Tony laughed, pulling away to give Steve his dried suit, “Suit up, Captain. Let’s go join the others.”
“Told you,” Tony grunted, sipping at his mug.
“I was always interested in fire, and campfire building is just physics,” He snorted, standing up to shrug off the top of his undersuit and tying around his waist, leaving him bare-chested in the humid heat, “Alright, wanna chop down a tree?”
“Hey! You got your bandage wet. You know I will have to put a new one on, right?” Tony scolded.
Surprisingly, he found most of the other Avengers all pitching in to put PJ’s room together. Noticing him first, Clint waved in a hello, made sure Sam was still steady putting up string lights, then headed over.
“And you?” he heard himself ask.
PJ nodded, reaching back with a giggle when Steve tugged on his hair. He whirled around and tried to push at Steve’s face, squealing when the man playfully nipped at his fingers.
to tell you,” Tony complained sourly, reaching up to rub his ear, “And hitting an injured person? That’s cold, honey bear. You’re mean.”
“I don’t want to touch
Steve sighed and rolled his eyes, but he made no move to take the ice cream back, figuring Tony was just as territorial about food as he was with everything else. He crossed his arms and scooted down a bit, propping up his feet to try and disguise his pout, considering that his treat had been unfairly stolen.
let the raccoon in and got him all the bells and whistles of therapy and reconditioning and—I have done
“I know you are only looking out for me, and I love you for that,” he continued quietly, “But Steve is a good man. The things they taught us about the Warlords were not true. Give it a few days, then make your judgment, okay?”
“You better be dressed!”
“He looks just like you,” Rhodey said, gently running his fingertips over Peter’s downy hair, “That’s your eyes and nose, for sure.”
“When you go to lunch, yes. You need to pay attention to Health since that’s the one class that involves talking and not much textbook material,” he answered, folding the paper into quarters and tucking it into his breast pocket.
“You cannot be serious. We are not leaving the child
Tony looked over at Steve sitting in his cell, curled up against the back wall. He could feel the confusion and possession of his mate still burning hot in his chest, and he knew that if it were him, he would want Steve to stay.
“Yeah, honeybear, I guess I did,” Tony choked out, reaching for him with his other hand to squeeze his hand, “Sorry ‘bout that.”
“I--I will come back, I promise,” he managed, walking backward to keep Steve in his line of sight, “You stay here, okay?”
“With the amount of money that goes through SHIELD, you’d think I wouldn’t have to keep paying for cleanup damages.”
“He likes you fine. You are overthinking these things--just because he cries when you hold him does not mean he does not like you. He is an infant. He is going to cry,” Tony soothed.
“They only let one live,” Steve finished.
“JARVIS, my leaving the medbay doesn’t get to any of the team unless I say so, capiche?”
“’Good night, little girls! Thank the Lord you are well! And now go to sleep,’ said Miss Clavel. And she turned out the light, and closed the door, and that’s all there is, there isn’t any more,” Tony finished with a lump in his throat.
“Tony. Look at me.”
“Nothing good, that’s for damn sure,” Bucky grunted, jabbing a finger at the layout, “One visible entrance. They purposefully want us funneled going in. It’d be a suicide mission.”
“I’m sorry, really, it won’t happen again, I promise,” Tony pleaded, begged,
“Gods, you scared me,” he murmured, “What hour is it? It cannot be morning, it is still dark outside.”
“I’m Steven, but you can call me Steve. I like your shirt, red is one of my favorite colors, but Ma says I look better in blue,” the child—Steve—babbled, “Robots are pretty cool too, but Bucky always says that dinosaurs are better. Bucky’s in my class again this year, he’s over there, with the brown hair.”
“It would have raised too many alarms. As it was, I had to sneak out of a fancy dinner to pack up my things, then climb out of my bedroom window so I could run to meet Pepper and Rhodey to take the baby that night,” Tony explained, “We knew he could never stay in the city because he would smell like me. We needed to hide somewhere, so our plan had been for Mary and I to run North in the hopes that the rumors of the Prime Alpha would be enough to keep Howard from sending troops after us.”
“Do not be fooled. He can make quite a lot of noise when he wants to.”
“Contrary to popular belief, I do know when I’ve screwed up,” he grunted, standing up from his chair, “Or, at least, when I need to apologize for
“Oh?”
“Young Sir. I’m glad to see that you are awake,” He said softly, “Ana has been asking after you. She’s kept her hands busy with all sorts of sweets that I’m sure you’ll want to try once you return home.”
“You can, but not in front of the tyke,” he answered, smirking at Tony’s gape.
“Hey, you already took my Neapolitan, eat your own,” He grunted despite not moving the tub.
“Well, he has the mentality of a toddler, but he’s physically older, so sure. He’s the older brother.”
Once he was seated and buckled himself, he sighed in relief at the sound of the car roaring to life.
He resolved to talk with Rhodey on the morrow, figuring the man could use some space to figure his worries out. As Tony rolled over and pulled the furs up to get himself ready for a nap, there was a knock on the door and it opened, revealing a familiar head with sad eyes.
“Office.
“I apologize,” he managed through gritted teeth, “I—the touch—”
“Maybe you guys should go home. I don’t feel so good,” he said quietly, staring at his feet, “Jarvis is still in the kitchen. He can call your parents and stuff.”
“I know basic medicine, Doc, no need to spare me the details,” Tony interrupted, shouldering through them to look at the scans.
“The more I thought about it, the more I realized that most of the time, when I was doing things with her, I was thinking of you,” he confessed, wringing his hands in his lap, “She hated the milkshakes in the fourth street diner, you know.”
“Thanks, Brucey bear,” Tony interrupted, “I’m okay. Really. It’s fine.”
“Cap, you better hold that boy like you’re carrying the Holy Grail, got it? It’s about to get a little rough,” he said, watching two goons on motorbikes roar up on either side of him.
Tony yelped as water shot out from the showerhead, completely soaking him. Surprised, Steve quickly turned it back, having to bite his bottom lip to keep from laughing at how much the other resembled a drowned rat.
talk to him. If anything, just to comfort each other. No one ever wants to hear that kind of news.”
“No love for me?”
Fury’s voice broke his train of thought, making Steve blink in surprise and try to stammer out an answer. He quickly flushed and became embarrassed, ducking his head as Fury went back to reading the announcements. After a second, a wet
“Go on. I will retrieve your things and bring them to his—your—quarters,” Thor encouraged, patting Tony’s shoulder, “We will speak soon, and I will introduce you to our gang of merry fellows, yes? I’m sure you will like our physician; he originally hails from one of the Southern cities as well.”
“Can’t we just pick teams?” Bruce asked from his recliner, “Isn’t that how it’s supposed to go?”
“Of course.”
For a moment, a bright light flickered down the hall, then darkness again.
Steve nodded, offering a grateful smile until Tony turned away. This was going to be the first soccer game in middle school in which he wasn’t right by Tony’s side on the field. Inwardly, it was heartbreaking, and he knew Tony would quit the team if he told him about how he truly felt. But, he also knew Tony needed the sport because he always looked so
“Rest would do you well, especially if you plan on spending your evening with the Prime,” Bruce said.
“Alright, one sandwich coming up,” Steve said, breaking his train of thought as he placed the plate in front of Tony, “And you, young man, need to be cleaned up, and probably put down for a nap.”
Steve bit his lip and nodded, running a hand through Tony’s hair to scrape his nails over his scalp. He grinned when Tony visibly loosened, only to have him sit up straight and glare.
Natasha looked at the standoff before carefully turning to the last card, nodding at Thor and Bruce so they could skedaddle before the conversation escalated.
“Bullshit!” Tony griped, “I will
“Right.”
Steve looked up and choked, finding Rhodey collapsing onto the floor next to him, clearly shaken up. Without letting go of Tony, he drew the other man into a one-armed hug, grateful for the momentary comfort.
gotten lost, he took everyone down to the home movie theatre, grinning when they all started to chatter again, squishing themselves onto the large couch.
“I hope you understand that when
“Yeah,” Tony huffed, nodding, “I got this. Gimmie a shout if something happens.”
“I know,” Tony said gently, biting his bottom lip, “It’s okay, Steve.”
“What? What’s wrong? Sore?” He asked worriedly, “C’mon, lemme see—”
“Thank you, Thor. I am sure we will be having many talks like this one in the future,” he said, smiling at the giant, “Will you help me with retiring to our room? I cannot hold him up with Peter in my arms.”
“Shh, love. I know, I know. Everything is okay,” he whispered, “Just a little longer.”
“Tony?” Bucky. “What the hell happened?”
Careful as to not hurt Tony with his strength, Steve cupped his cock in his palm and slowly stroked him, watching in fascination as the head peeked up through his fingers and disappeared again. Tony was by no means small, but it seemed so compared to Steve’s large hand, making Steve shiver with want. He realized that Tony’s hands were wandering up his thighs, clearly searching to return the pleasure, but Steve quickly grabbed his wrists with one hand and pinned them behind his back, leaving Tony to only be propped up by Steve’s chest and thighs.
to him before bedtime. Sure, he was too old for the book, but it was one of his favorites, and mama’s voice when she read Miss Clavel—
“Right, finding out you and I have a genetically engineered child isn’t exactly the best for you,” Tony said before he could snap his mouth shut.
lines. At least you look cute.”
Tony shrieked in surprise, whirling around to see Bruce standing behind him, nonchalantly cleaning his glasses off with his shirt.
“Hey, honey bear,” Tony said softly, unable to help his grin once Rhodey noticed him, “How are you?”
“Okay. Okay, slow. Fine. But I promise I can take you. I can. I know I can,” he insisted.
He set the cup down again, and feeling Steve still again, made a curious noise to look up at him. Blinking, Tony recognized his hooded eyes, but didn’t move fast enough to question Steve’s sloppy kiss.
He stopped mid-sentence to hiss softly, his right hand involuntarily going to press against his left side. Panting softly, Tony shook his head as the sharp pain dulled, leaning back in his chair to ignore Steve’s amped up look of concern.
“…Yes. Bathroom,” Tony repeated, a little bewildered, “It’s a room. To go. I—y’know, I’m not surprised at all that they didn’t give you a bathroom to use. I don’t know why I’m surprised.”
“Friend Stark, where will we put the boy? The Tower is not accommodated for a child,” Thor asked, absentmindedly twirling his hammer in one hand, “Will Miss Potts be taking care of him?”
Steve’s steady hands faltered for a fraction of a second, but Tony caught it and took that as a personal win.
“Oh, god, they’re like horny treefrogs,” Clint’s voice said from down the hallway, causing them to jump apart, “Just
“It’s okay,” Tony soothed quickly, glancing at Steve, “He won’t hurt you—Steve, put your hand out, palm up. Let him come to you.”
“Sorry, sorry,” Tony apologized, wincing as poured alcohol over the gash, “Have to clean it properly. Infection can kill you, you know.”
“You like it when I suck your tits?” Tony crowed with a grin.
, I just know that if I do not get your prick inside me tonight you are
Ignoring the strangled noise that erupted from his throat, Tony put his hand out for PJ, attempting to look at the boy under his floppy curls.
“You cannot.”
, Daddy!”
“I love you, little one,” Tony said softly in their native language.
He looked down, immediately bending at the knees when he saw how shaken PJ was.
being called his last name, Tony looked down at the boy for a few silent beats, watching his even breaths.
“Good job, that’s exactly what it’s for,” He praised, choosing to smile down at PJ, “You’re a real natural. Soon, you’ll have to give
“My mother was too old. I was lucky to have been conceived at all. As to the laws… my father’s bigotry outweighed any feelings toward me. He has always seen Omegas as secondary and he probably will until the day he dies.”
“I’m not getting PJ’s blood drawn by myself,” he corrected, pulling over a table on wheels to begin setting up for the phlebotomy, “Take that ratty thing off him and keep it on the table so he doesn’t have to rest against the cold metal. I’d also recommend you send for clothes for him once we do his measurements. For now, he should be able to wear spare t-shirts and the like. JARVIS, could you ask Natasha if she has any spare shirts?”
“So you love him?” Rhodey asked nonchalantly, folding his hands behind his head as he leaned back in his chair, “Or do you just want to get down with him as a political truce?”
“You got captured.”
It took everything in his willpower to not break down sobbing. Steve’s warmth felt so
“Well, uh, I don’t know which one of them it is, but Clint’s taken, Thor’s Asgardian and is probably our definition of pansexual, and Bruce generally defers to science rather than dating.”
“I’m going to go let Edwin in. He’s been waiting the longest of any of us. Is that okay?” he asked.
“Jesus Christ.”
“I’m assuming he was tortured or abused in some way that someone reaching for him sets off a reaction,” Tony answered carefully, attempting to not give away his own sadness, “It’s better for him to initiate the touch part of the contact. He’ll set his hand in yours if you offer him your palm, though.”
, Tony,” Steve interrupted him, using his I’m-the-Captain-so-do-as-I-say voice, “In and out, Iron Man. Can you do that for me?”
“See? All better,” he said, petting Peter’s fine hairs.
“You can explain this to me too. Godson and a brother-in-law, hm?” he murmured.
“We don’t fucking know that,” He answered bitterly, taking his hand away from his face to show her how red his eyes were from the tears that refused to fall, “I let—I got us captured, I don’t know what they did to him—”
“That’s it, you have your fill, darling. Nice and relaxed,” Tony grit out, thunking his head against the side of the bathtub.
Tony thunked his head back against the headrest of his chair, sighing in loud annoyance to steel himself from turning around to give Steve a piece of his mind.
,” PJ whined, long and drawn out as he bounced a bit on the bed.
Tony all but scrambled out of the bath, tripping on his shaky legs and ending up on his hands and knees in the water. Unable to help himself, Steve spread his cheeks and pushed three fingers in again, checking the spread while Tony sobbed in pleasure.
“Tell me,” Tony urged, kicking Bucky’s foot again, “I need the hot goss. The four-one-one. The tea. I thought you were going to propose!”
He smirked at Steve’s audible whine and signaled him over with a crook of his finger. The Prime slowly waded over, and once he was within arm’s length, Tony reached up to cup Steve’s chest and push his pectorals together.
Steve sighed and buried his head in his hands, but even the glow from the fire couldn’t hide the embarrassment that darkened the tips of his ears. He shook his head and leaned his cheek against his fist, staring into the embers.
“—Way, way,
“Sorry, spaced for a second,” He said, turning to give Steve a shaky smile.
“Good. Let’s go get the others up and buckle in, yeah?”
Steve’s blush rose onto his cheeks and the tips of his ears, making him hot enough to let go of Tony’s hand to rub the back of his neck awkwardly.
“So, do you have a favorite color now?” Tony asked PJ at the end of the book, poking the boy’s nose.
“Oh, threatening me?”
Horrified, Tony choked on his gasp and clapped a hand over his mouth. He shut his eyes tight and tried to not sob, squeezing Steve’s hand tightly as if he could pass on the pain.
, but now that he was questioning if Steve actually returned his feelings, he needed a little space to try and force his brain to slow down and attempt to organize past interactions to look for signs that he missed.
“It is a crown of flowers. Daisies are still in season,” Freya explained, sympathy soaking her voice, “Perhaps it will bring some blessing as you and the little one adjust to your new home.”
“How else do you think I deal with my anger issues? Expensive therapy?” Bruce said, shrugging, “Also, you carry yourself differently after Howard has an episode. You hunch more, like you want to hide.”
“I can take care of him if I’m hurt, but I appreciate the help,” Tony interrupted, seeing the gesture as a half-apology, “Thank you, Steve.”
“You want something like that, huh?”
“Yeah, I know. Heterochromia,” Tony answered for him, cocking an eyebrow.
Tony tried to frown, but he found a bashful smile of his own on his face, making him bite his lip to keep from grinning too big. Steve just had that effect on him: he was so honest, whether it be about something good or bad, and receiving a Steve Compliment never failed to make Tony feel a flutter in his chest that his doctor had said he need not worry about.
“Hey. Hey you. Can you come out of there? Please?” He cooed to PJ, gently tapping the boy’s shoulder, “You’re going to get snot all over me, and as much as I enjoy holding you, the snot is a deal breaker. Will you let us clean up your face a bit? Huh?”
When Steve stopped speaking, Tony figured he would finally retire for the night, but then something soft and scratchy brushed over his forehead and a creak suggested that Steve had stood and moved away. It took a moment to think of what Steve had done to him, but when the realization hit, he curled up under the furs to hide the shy smile on his face. He had expected Steve’s lips to be hard and chapped, not soft, and the feeling of his short beard had been oddly pleasant on his skin.
“He’ll want to be. Steve may have a bad track record with kids, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t
“No, love,” he said as he barely managed to keep the annoyance out of his voice, “You know it would be unlikely to happen outside of heat, and Peter is still too young. We have
with Tony, about being a family, about recovering after nearly attempting to murder his new mate’s best friend--
“Okay. Thanks, Brucey bear. I appreciate your help,” Tony said, reaching out to squeeze Bruce’s arm when he moved to leave.
Steve rolled his eyes as the two boys bickered, adjusting his body until he could be a little comfortable in the hard, metal desk. His attention drifted in and out as his friends petered into the room, finding their desks and socializing until the bell rang. Even then, Tony had to snap his fingers in front of his face to draw him out of his daydreams.
“Like I was sayin’, Barney was tellin’ me that when I get big ‘nough he’s gonna take me to the circus,” he was saying, carefully stacking wood blocks together to make a skyscraper, “I’m gonna be a rope walker an’ I’m gonna learn how t’eat fire.”
“Leaving us here?” he croaked, immediately sending himself into a coughing fit.
Tony nodded, then shook his head, only to pause and turn his head up and purse his lips. Laughing, Steve leaned down to kiss him once, so he would settle back down. Satisfied that Tony was settled, he reached over the side of the bed to pull out the last notebook; it was definitely the newest of all of them, seeing that the binding was still fairly pristine. However, some of the pages were warped on the inside and definitely smelled of old alcohol. Steve checked the name and date on the front.
“Daddy’s sorry, Petey. He never meant to hurt you or make you feel scared or alone,” Tony murmured, “I will always be there to hold you and comfort you. I promise. You are my first priority, little one.”
“Captain Rogers is already on his way,” JARVIS relayed.
Spurred on by the thought of getting his baby back in his arms, Tony headed inside and hobbled his way to Bruce’s quarters, smiling as he heard familiar cries echoing down the hall. Something in his heart tugged and he knew Peter missed him. He barely got his fist up to knock when the door swung open, revealing the disheveled physician and a clearly agitated Peter.
“Well, technically it was Sam and James’ idea, not mine. I was merely the message relay-er since apparently, they had words with Steve earlier and are both in the doghouse,” He said, shrugging, “He was only bringing you guys the stuff in case PJ needed an overnight. Why? Did he say something?”
Tony clapped Clint on the shoulder before heading back out, finding PJ glaring up at a very awkward-looking Steve with the sippy cup cast down on the floor. The boy turned at his footsteps, his face blotchy with what looked like tears running down his cheeks.
“Last night, St—the Prime was working on this map and I happened to notice that the, uh, the defenses are wrong,” He started, only to shake his head and backtrack, “Not wrong, but, ah—weak. The eastern and western walls are susceptible if the enemy had enough brains and men.”
Tony turned to look at Steve, nudging his head with his shoulder to make him look up. He searched his face for a moment, then nodded, dropping his gaze back down to PJ.
“Nah. Thor went, so I decided to stay back and wait for you,” Bruce replied with a smile, “That, and I wanted to check on PJ, as well.”
a kink for you? I mean—okay, maybe we talked about feminization, but really?”
“He’s not dying, Captain. His leg is fractured in two places, but with Helen Cho’s help, he should be back on his feet in a week,” Vis supplied, phasing so he could sit on the seat that Clint’s bad leg was currently occupying, “I am at optimal functioning.”
“What’re you doing here? You’re Chair Force, not evac,” he asked, managing a small smile at Rhodey’s choked-up laugh.
“Da?” Peter asked as Tony handed him back over to Steve.
part of the King’s Army. And I want to know why he is even
He groaned and she smirked over at him, flicking switches and pressing buttons to set the jet to autopilot. She affectionately ruffled his hair before moving back, presumably to check on Clint. Steve picked up his set of headphones and turned them on, fitting them to his head as he flicked through the receiver channels until he could hear Tony’s shop’s music in the background.
“No more pulling out hairs, darling. Daddy needs those, sweet one,” Tony said, patting Peter’s bottom, “I will have to find you a toy or something to keep your hands occupied.”
“Shh, my love, no more tears,” Tony soothed, gritting his teeth as he began the painful trek to the dining hall, “We will sit and eat and have a good cuddle, okay? Daddy missed you, sweet one.”
“I think he had a bad night without me,” he said quietly, feeling very guilty, “Maybe it was too early to let him be away for so long. I...I did not think he would be upset, but--”
The hand from his shoulder fell away and was replaced with two fingers under his chin, gently teasing him out from the safety of Peter. He blinked away tears to look up into Steve’s gentle eyes; his brow was furrowed in concern, but he still smiled, moving to cup Tony’s cheek with his hand. Leaning forward, he pressed his forehead against Tony’s and breathed out deeply, then breathed in just as deep, repeating the pattern. Tony let his eyes flutter shut as he copied Steve, already starting to feel better from the gentle touch. Once he had calmed enough that his scent began to sweeten once more—something he did not notice until Steve’s shoulders relaxed—Steve pulled away, slipping his hand from Tony’s cheek up into his hair.
“You were being polite and got a blowie out of it. Plus, I was seventeen,” Tony grunted, not even bothering to turn around, “I think I’d sucked maybe one dick in my life when I wrote that, so I can’t be blamed for inaccuracies.”
He paused, rolling the plan around in his head for a moment. Deciding that it was good enough to see if he could determine if Tony returned his feelings, Steve slipped on moccasins, hoping that he could pull it off.
better palette than him, and I’d like to keep it that way.”
“If it helps, we didn’t know until we—until—” Steve drew in a shaky breath and squeezed Tony’s hand again, wanting nothing more than for his husband to wake up.
That is, if he could get in.
bed. You could have woken me up and asked me to move.”
“He’s not just any boy, Tony,” Natasha continued, handing Tony the stack of papers, “He’s yours.”
wonderful, and you definitely were not kidding about the size of your dick, holy
“Nice job,” Natasha commented, idly picking at her one chipped nail, “Didn’t take you for a boy scout.”
when she’d talk about you and Barnes. Howard would tease her about it, especially since she’d tear up when I asked where you were. ‘I don’t know, love,’ she’d say, and pick me up to sit on her knees, ‘But wherever he is, he’s being a hero. And one day, he’ll come back. If not in time for me, for you. We need him, you know.’”
An extremely loud blond boy was yakking off the ear of a small redhead in the corner, seemingly uncaring that she was clearly ignoring him in favor of playing with her dollies. Nearby, a boy with shaggy brown hair and a kid with a gap between his front teeth were trying to join in, adding sound effects as they tromped their dinosaur figures through the dollhouse. Tony tilted his head at that; dinosaurs didn’t belong in houses, did they?
“Okay. Thanks, Nat,” he said quietly, shifting his leg away from Clint in case he started bouncing it again.
Steve snapped back to it and shucked off his pants, momentarily thankful that he usually went commando. He had the sense to be ready to bat away Tony’s hands, scooping the needy Omega back up to carry into the bathroom.
“If—damn, I can’t believe I’m saying this—if you want to try this, we can try this,” Tony said gently, “I can’t promise you anything, but god, Steve, if you have feelings back, I’m not about to keep denying myself you. I’ve killed myself over it long enough.”
Steve’s eyes narrowed at that, but he didn’t comment, which Tony was thankful for. He stumbled over to his bed, sitting down heavily on the plush comforter as he put his hand up under his own shirt to cover his reactor, feeling the machine whir and his heart thump under his fingertips. Still catching his breath, Tony hung his head, turning his face away when he felt the bed dip as Steve sat next to him.
“I do not know what has plagued you as of late, my sun, but I can share the burden. You know this. You do not have to shoulder it all yourself,” Steve said as he squeezed himself down onto the pile of furs to spoon up next to Tony, “He and I both love you very much, but I understand that you get lost in your head at times. He does not. He needs his daddy, Tony, even if you do not feel very much like being one at the moment.”
“Soft, right?” He asked, nodding, “Be careful not to pull too hard.”
Tony does some reflecting at the beginning of his Junior year.
“It’s not just a story, love. I knew I was waiting for my best fella, even then,” Tony interrupted softly, lacing their hands together, “Sure, I was…low. But this—”
“Tony, you were a hero long before you were Iron Man,” Steve said softly, “Sure, you may not have had the suit, but you were still Tony Stark. And yes, I realize you may not necessarily like that, but it’s true. You have always been a good man, Tony. Your origin story was just a lot more complex than most. And that’s okay.”
“Never doubt my loyalty again, or you will regret it,” Tony said, unwavering in his eye contact with Steve.
“Nat, when’s Fury’s ETA?” Tony asked, retracting a gauntlet to carefully place the pads of his bare fingers on the child’s forehead, “This kid needs medical attention
“Check in,” He started, “Sam, you first. Then around.”
He looked up, but Steve was noticeably absent. Something that felt like
Steve pointed at the bouquet, and Tony smiled, scuffling his shoes in the dirt as he pushed it into Steve’s chest. He took it with careful hands, ducking his head to smell it.
“I’m alright, sweet thing,” Tony soothed through grit teeth, “Just a little achy. Why don’t you sit with Papa, hm? He’s much comfier.”
. You stop that right now.”
“I cannot believe you would call them that, good lord,” he whispered, looking over Tony’s shoulder.
for some big-timer is—”
He must have been staring, for she began to laugh again, patting his knee lightly.
Barnes sat back when Thor was finished, only to turn to Steve and speak, causing the man to laugh.
“Yeah, exactly. Good job, kiddo,” Tony praised, grinning, “You’re so smart. You’ll probably be as smart as me someday.”
“Can—Can I kiss you?” Steve breathed.
settled in his chest, so Tony forced a smile onto his face, changing his mind.
“Breakfast?” Steve asked, finally smiling when Tony’s stomach growled, “Stay. I will go make us plates.”
With one last whiff of the Omega’s sweet scent, Steve tucked himself into Tony’s side and covered them up with warm furs, figuring that if Tony had begun the snuggles, he was allowed to continue them. He fell asleep with their legs entwined and his arm over Tony’s waist, somehow slotting together as if they had been going to bed with each other since the beginning of time itself. It was more than easy to fall asleep; he finally felt like he was coming home.
Tony paused, mouth half-open. He slowly closed it, looking up at Steve with more annoyance than he began with.
Brightening up, the boy pushed himself up to his feet, his sniffling gone as he ran over to Nat. Watching him look up at her with a shy smile, Tony felt his heart lighten, a twinge of pride striking him.
“Clint missed?” he asked, ignoring Rhodey’s clearly confused look.
Nothing could keep me away from you.
Poking his head up, Tony saw two small hands scrabbling at the bedsheets and heard frustrated whines drifting up from that side. Looking over, PJ’s pouty face stared back up at him.
Tony froze, but he swallowed and nodded, carefully undoing his sash belt and tucking it into his pants. Slowly, he drew out his bundle from under his shirt and cradled it in his arms, slightly undoing the swaddle to show the group. A shocked gasp and murmur ran through them, something that Tony was expecting. Peter paid no mind to the strange response; rather, he stretched and yawned, turning to tuck his head into his father to recapture his warmth. There, on both of their necks were matching bumps, clean and pristine.
Tony stared as the crowd dispersed, completely bewildered by what had just occurred. He caught Bruce’s eye and quickly waved him over, meeting the doctor halfway.
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve repeated with a smile, showing his hands again then jogging off toward what Tony assumed was the kitchen.
“Riders,” Tony answered, nearly the end of the thicket, “Listen, when we break clear, duck down. You got it? And make sure you both are strapped in. Keep your shield on your back.”
His eyes widened when he realized he’d said it aloud: Tony felt his jaw drop, and Rhodey couldn’t help but laugh, smacking his knee as the sound reverberated throughout his body.
“He…we had a moment,” he decided on, only to quickly switch topics, “Anyway. Do you think you could help with PJ’s draw and examination? He’s a …a bit wary of the SHIELD docs. Not that I blame him.”
“Is there any reason as to why he does this?” Steve asked to Tony, not taking his eyes off the boy.
Steve, driving a stolen motorbike with Clint riding bitch.
“No,” Tony and Bruce answered simultaneously.
“Not like I can go anywhere,” Tony grunted as he tugged on the cuffs.
“…When did he call you Daddy?” he finally asked.
“Thanks,” Tony answered, frowning, “Good to know.”
Tony looked into the thermos, and seeing that it was almost full, poured it out onto the ground.
“Hey, where’s pipsqueak? We’re about done in here,” the archer grinned, hands on his hips, “Looks cool, right? Thor went to Asgard for a bit. Something about furs. He should be back soon…Bruce is in the lab, and I think Pepper headed back up to her office.”
Tony peeked over his shoulder to see Steve’s darkening eyes blink back at him. It was not often that he used his Omega tone, but the situation seemed to call for it and Steve was in no hurry to chastise him. The Warlord licked his lips and leaned in for a kiss, figuring that it would not hurt if they were a few minutes late. Tony could not do much until Peter finished his breakfast anyway.
“Sorry, I do not mean to disturb your rest,” Bruce said, hurrying over with a jar in his hand, “I made up your medicine for you—are you done with that?”
He carefully moved Steve over to the rocking chair, helping the Captain sit and shift PJ so he was sitting with the boy curled up against him, seemingly unbothered by the movement. Finding himself tired as well, Tony sat down heavily on the chair’s ottoman, watching as Steve slowly became accustomed to the new charge in his lap.
it to anything. That, and I’m kind of doing what Howard didn’t do for me. So. It’s working out, for now. We’ll see what happens tonight. I doubt he’ll enjoy it being dark.”
A deep growl vibrated directly next to his ear. Startled, Tony gasped noiselessly and tightened his hand around the bar of the cell as his eyes snapped open. He could see Steve’s knees out of his peripheral, and he knew that if he looked over, the Alpha would be right up in his face. It took a few steadying breaths, but he managed to turn his head, pretending as though he was not shaking from outright fear. Steve had snuck up to the bars and was visibly perplexed, as if he could not understand why there was a barrier between them. He attempted to get a hand through to touch, but Tony immediately scooted away on reflex.
“Whatever you say, darling. I’ll be right back. Make sure you eat the fruit, too,” Steve said, pushing the bowl of strawberries and blueberries closer to Tony.
“Great team outing, Stark!” Clint called from his perimeter position, earning a middle finger from Tony.
“Yes, dear, very warm,” Tony laughed, patting Steve’s arm, “Soon you’ll have your warm suit too, and we can go lay down. Good?”
“Right. Our kid. Okay. I sense—I sense something that sounds like an emotional conversation and I’m going to avoid it by walking away—”
“Do you wanna talk about it?” Tony asked softly, clearly worried as he reached up to poke the wrinkles between Steve’s brows.
And he had thought he’d nearly had a heart attack when PJ
“I just want to make sure you’re alright,” Steve answered evenly, “It’s nothing to be ashamed—”
bra,” he grumbled, daring to take a hand off of Peter to grab for the clothing.
Steve popped open the door, and not unlike a clown car, all of the children filtered out, making their way up to the door. Unsurprisingly, two maids opened the large oak doors once they were close enough, ushering in the children into the foyer.
“It fuels me.”
Turning off the water, Tony set all of the cleaning supplies back where they had been before going back out of the shower, glad to see that they at least had
He looked up and smiled weakly at Steve, who had peeked his head out of the kitchen to give him a concerned look.
He pulled back, forcing Tony to make eye contact with him as he smiled down at the brunet.
“Ah, Mister Stark?” The nurse asked quietly, edging forward as Tony was in the middle of getting PJ into his new clothes, “Overlord Zemo asked me to attend to your injuries. Apparently, the child was…
“I am glad you came to us, Tony,” he said softly.
He showed off the bouquet, so Tony ducked slightly behind Steve, embarrassed about it. Natasha cooed softly over it, and Bucky made a face at Steve, to which Steve made a face back. Tony was confused, considering he couldn’t figure out what silent conversation they just had, but the soft kiss pressed to his cheek short-circuited his brain anyway, making any thoughts he was having fly out of the window.
“I like Sherri Shepherd,” he said, draping his legs over the side of the armchair he was lounging in.
to make you cry.”
“Alright. But right now, I need to go feed this kid since Barton made him sick on accident,” he sighed, pouting at Rhodey’s chuckle, “I really wish I was kidding. It was gross, man. I thought I could handle bodily fluids since I’ve got the reactor and have to stick my hand into that grossness, but—”
“Oh good, Dr. Stark, come join us,” T’Challa called once he spotted Tony exiting the elevator, “Shuri has sent over the plans for the compound—and she thanks you for JARVIS’ help. She quite enjoyed his, ah, ‘Stark snark’.”
“That is quite an extensive list, darling, but I think you also forgot ‘exquisite and handsome’,” Tony quipped, “And I did not know that you
“You look…good,” He finally said, “Perhaps I could get a cloak at some point since I tend to run cold.”
“Tony’s not trying to woo me,” He said to the ceiling, sounding pitiful, “He’s just being nice and helpful because you’re the team leader. That’s all.”
She groaned at that, leaving Tony in a fit of laughter.
kidding me,” just barely covering Rhodey’s “Who?”
“We got in touch with most of everyone. The only one in the area I could think of inviting was Peg, but I thought that might be too much. I set up a group chat so we can keep them updated with Tony’s condition, okay?”
He let Steve lead him out of what he was assumed was the infirmary and down the hallway toward their bedroom. It was slow goings since he was feeling more lethargic with every step, but they eventually stumbled into the room. Once the door closed, Tony let out a sigh of relief and pushed off of Steve, attempting to take off his shirt single-handedly. After a minute of struggling, Steve stepped in, motioning toward Peter. Tony carefully let him take the babe before stripping down, too tired to care about his nudity. He took Peter back and trudged toward the bathroom, missing Steve’s wide eyes with his one-track mind.
Tony rifled around until he found a suitable pot and set it on the stovetop, humming to himself as he poured a generous amount of milk into it and turned the heating element on. PJ watched carefully, thumb stuck in his mouth as he eyed Tony warily.
“You are much easier to handle, my love,” he whispered in the Southern dialect, “A little thing like you has no reason to feel such jealousy for others, huh?... Well, maybe if your Papa keeps me from you. But I do not blame you for that one.”
, do not forget that.”
“He knows my name,” Clint whispered, making Bucky laugh at the look of awe on his face.
Steve shook his head and made a disgruntled noise, nudging his nose against Tony’s forehead in protest. Hearing a soft whine between them, both men looked down, seeing PJ pouting up at them.
Zola’s pixels shrugged, and a positively sinister smile danced across the screen.
“He’s sleeping, but I doubt he’ll be out for long. The morphine made him talkative, but I doubt he’ll be as open once he’s coming off the meds,” Steve said quietly, nodding to the chairs on the other side of Tony’s bed for the men to sit in, “It’s…it’s bad. We need to talk to Fury, Buck. I want to have words.”
“Better than good,” Tony breathed, “Do it again.”
“You both,” Rhodey managed, taking a deep breath before laughing again, “you both are
“We all came over in the limo. Is that okay, or would you like your own car, Tony?” Pepper asked.
Tony managed an affirming noise, dumbly staring at Bucky as the soldier hefted PJ onto his hip and grabbed up the travel bag. PJ watched Tony over his shoulder and waved, and with a tired blink, they were gone, too. He sunk back into the soft pillows on his bed, fumbling for the bed control to lay himself down so he could stare at the ceiling. The soft beeping of the machines around him buzzed in his cranium, but it was nowhere near enough noise to keep him from thinking.
“Your Father is still at his office, but your Mother is waiting for you and your friends in the sitting room,” one of them informed Tony, collecting the backpacks from everyone.
“Just Jarvis is fine, Mr. Barton,” Jarvis answered, handing out the plates of cake to everyone.
Steve at least had the decency to look a bit ashamed, so Tony took that as a win, readjusting himself in his chair as he tried to alleviate the pain in his ribs. Once the New York skyline came into view, he sighed softly and let JARVIS take them through landing, grunting with each jolt of the car.
“Both of you are in time out,” Miss Hill said to Steve and Bucky, ushering them back inside, “Let’s go, you two.”
He sounded suspiciously nervous. If he focused on the bond, Tony knew he could probably figure out what had the Alpha worked up, but prying was the last thing on his mind. Instead, as soon as Steve’s fingers pulled out completely, Tony reached back to yank his underwear back up and sat up, putting his shirt back into place. Hiding his arousal with his clothing allowed him to relax a little, so he crawled back into the nest of pillows he had made earlier and plopped down with a groan as he dragged some of the bed furs over himself.  He shut his eyes to the sound of Steve washing his hands and presumably cleaning up after them.
--we should move, at least to where they cannot hear us--”
He turned his head to cough loudly, his entire body wracking with the force. After a moment, he slumped back and sucked in a deep breath, just as Steve ran back in with Thor and a new man in tow.
, Tony helped place the child on his hip, showing the Captain where to place his arms to keep the boy upright. Sated, PJ leaned his head on Steve’s shoulder, eyes fluttering closed as he held the elephant tight between them. Steve’s face quickly morphed from hesitant okay-ness to abject horror, looking at Tony with wide, helpless eyes.
“Hey,” Steve said back, raising an eyebrow with a fond smile on his lips, “He alright?”
When Miss Hill came around to check on them, she merely rolled her eyes at Steve and Tony, shaking her head as she picked up the extra cot to put away. It wasn’t unlike pre-kindergarteners to cuddle up during nap time, so she let it be, instead helping the few children who were awake pack up their things to get ready to go home. Of course, once parents started to arrive, all of the children woke up, excited to finally go home.
“Be nice,” Scott snorted.
“I didn’t. Kind of. Pep had me read books way back when, since we had a few scares back in the day,” Tony answered, picking at his nails, “I never actually
Tony paused at that, raising an eyebrow at the other.
One touch intensified the pain to that of a thousand suns; his back bowed off of the bed as a scream was ripped from his throat. Distantly he heard a door slam open and multiple shadows hovered over him, but before he could tell them Steve needed help, Steve was in
. And I like that.”
Standing with a huff, Tony trudged over to PJ’s room, unable to help the tiny smile once he saw that the door had been left open. Peeking in, his smile grew, seeing PJ curled up to his elephant, snuffling in his sleep. Comforted that the boy was at least getting some rest, Tony left to join the others in the living room; he paused upon walking in, realizing that everyone was in attendance, including T’Challa and Vision, both lounging on the couch with Wanda as the group poured over some packets of papers.
“I’ll get tape! Lemme get the tape, an’ you can put it up in the cubby,” Steve declared, sliding off of his seat, “You stay here, okay?”
“It’s okay, he’s okay, he’s just tired.” Tony soothed, knowing that if Steve freaked out, he would
“How about that walk?” Steve murmured with a kiss to Tony’s temple, “Do you think you are up for it? Or do you still ache?”
, now can we?”
“Shouldn’t I be asking you that question?”
“Hi, peanut, yeah, it’s Papa,” he said, stumbling over his words, “I’m on my way home, kiddo. I’ll be back later tonight to be able to tuck you into bed.”
“Wh—mercy?” Tony asked, listening to Thor translate to Steve, “Why mercy? I—I get now that he is naïve, and I think he understands to not do such things again, but mercy?”
It was quiet until Tony sighed loudly and dragged a hand over his scrunched up face.
“Oh, do not be so grumpy. It is sweet how mushy you are with each other,” Bucky said as he sat down next to him, “It is good to see you and Steve so… connected.”
“Good morning, darling. A quick change and then breakfast for you,” Tony said, carrying Peter into the bathroom.
“So, who’s ya match?”
Bruce sighed, an apologetic expression not quite meeting his eyes.
Tony let out a slow breath, attempting to melt back into the hospital bed. He tried to take it all in, make sense of it, but his brain was slow and foggy, no doubt from whatever they’d put in his drip. Sniffling, he turned to look at Bucky, gently squeezing his hand back.
“I know, sweetheart. I know,” Steve murmured back, hugging Tony close with one hand on the back of his neck, “It’ll all be okay, you’ll see. You’ll be so busy making friends and changing the world that you’ll barely have time to miss your trophy husband.”
“Ste-ven!” he whined, stomping his foot, “Give it here! That one—that one’s
“I would like to be alone, please,” he said, keeping his head turned.
Peter only gurgled in response, tucking his head into Tony’s neck. He almost cried at how cute his baby was and kissed Peter’s cheek, rubbing circles on his back as he rocked them back and forth.
“It. Is.
“Go ahead and do your business. Nat and I are gonna turn around and wait for you to be done,” he explained, standing up.
“You doing okay?” He asked, wringing his hands in his lap, “I mean, of course you’re not, this is probably weird and strange and if I were you, I’d be extremely anxious and—”
Steve nodded again and beamed, gently easing Tony up from his lap so he could stand. He ushered Tony over to his bed, holding up the furs for him to crawl back under.
“Leaving out food in the open and then consuming it when it should be thrown away,” Bucky snorted, busy scribbling on his cardstock, “It’s disgusting. Like, I get that Clint can eat
“Enough, Steve.” Tony heard himself say, surprising everyone in the room, “Peter and I will go elsewhere so you can be alone and rest.”
Steve snaked a hand over the side of the tub to cup Tony’s face, smoothing his thumb over Tony’s cheek.
“Y-yes, Omega, I mean--I will not doubt you, not ever,” Steve said quickly, losing all concentration as blood was dragged from his brain and down into his gut.
“Nay. I mean breastmilk, like milk from the breast,” Thor answered, gesturing to his own breast, “The Captain has been producing since we crashed. Can you all not smell it?”
“Hey, what was that for?” He grumbled, trying to see over her shoulder at the last paper she had stopped on.
machines. Saving the world is just one of the many things on your already impressive resume. And, Tony—you’d still be a hero without the suit. You were a hero when you got out from under Howard, you were a hero when you built Dum-E and JARVIS, and you were a hero when you saw what was happening in Afghanistan and stopped it. You didn’t need, and you don’t need, the suit. I mean, it’s very nice, but you are the real hero. I mean, people don’t steal you away from me to get to the suit. They try to get you because you’re
“How did you and Clint get here?” he asked, turning as Steve moved to grab his discarded suit top and shield from the living room couch.
“Shh, my darling, I have you,” Tony whispered, rocking them both back and forth as he gathered the boy up into his arms, “It’s okay, I’m just glad you’re
It was quiet again, but Tony felt more coming down the line, so he got himself comfortable in the bed.
“My spot next to

“Hey, hey now, I’m right here,” Tony soothed, rubbing circles onto the tot’s back, “You’re okay, honey. You’re safe. I’m not going anywhere.”
the troublemaker. We really need to keep a better eye on you when I’m out for the count.”
“Are you ready?”
Of course, Steve merely smiled, patting the bed once more. Tony reached out and carefully laid a hand on his, shaking his head slowly. He pointed to Peter and himself, then rubbed his own stomach and gestured to the door. Thankfully, some things were universal, and it was easy to tell that they wanted food, especially when Tony’s stomach rumbled. He could not help his flush of embarrassment, which darkened when Steve stood and fondly cupped his cheek. The Alpha patted him lightly and then turned to leave with Tony on his heel; together, they walked deeper into the bowels of the castle, eventually turning down into a large dining room, filled with rows of large, long oak tables. Steve guided him toward the head of one of the furthest tables, pulling out the chair and gesturing for Tony to sit. Bewildered once again by the mannerisms, Tony awkwardly nodded and sat, letting Steve push him in.
Tony thought as he hesitantly approached him,
Rhodey nodded and shook Steve’s hand, moving to step over to Tony’s side. He knelt down, whispering low enough that only he could hear.
Ignoring the twinge of annoyance at
Dragging himself to a standing position, Tony stumbled to the wall, bracing a hand against the cold concrete. He forced himself to count through his breaths, shoving down the sharp pains all over his body so he could begin to investigate the room: four concrete walls, no windows; two bed frames, a mattress chained to each; a metal door, most likely iron, with a closed slat at the top and a closed slat at the bottom.
“Not really,” Rhodey hummed, “I think you and Steve would be good together. A bit explosive, but it would work.”
“What’s up, kiddo?” He asked.
Carefully, he moved over to the closet to pull on new underwear, panting softly at the ache as he moved his legs. Tony glanced at Steve and figured the Prime was still too sensitive for clothes, so he hefted himself back up onto the bed. He pulled the furs up around them and gently kissed Steve’s bruised nose, happily settling down for the night.
“Hurt,” he said quietly, his voice raw.
Peter did not give a response, but Tony brought him up for a kiss anyway, cuddling him to his chest. He felt the baby tuck his head into his neck and nearly cried as his heart swelled with affection for the little one.
“Tony,” Steve said, drawing his attention.
Standing up from the bed with a renewed sense of self, Tony grabbed up the bedding and, with PJ’s clumsy help, started to put the sheets on the bed. Though it took a few attempts at making it—mostly due to PJ climbing up when it wasn’t finished and creasing the sheets—they finally got the bed pieced together, finishing it by tossing various plush toys up onto the bed.
“What, don’t you like our kisses?” Tony teased.
Then again, the whole situation was nowhere near predictable, so Tony let out a defeated sigh and opened his eyes again to the semi-darkness.
,” Steve sobbed into his neck, attempting to grind his poor neglected cock up against Tony’s belly, “I
“They would be unstoppable. I shudder to think of what they could get into together,” he said, moving Peter up so he could look at Bruce, “What do you think, love?”
He stood up from the table and motioned with his head for Bruce to follow, tromping back down to his bedroom. He felt like he had done nothing but run around all day, and it was beginning to show as he handed Peter to Bruce and retrieved his doll.
“Hush, I got you, just focus on me,” Tony murmured to the boy, holding him close as he was ushered out by the guard down the hallway, “We’re going to be okay, I
“Well, there goes working for today,” he sighed, keeping a hand on PJ’s back to make sure he didn’t fall.
Multiple things happened at once: Rhodey took the baby, Bucky pounced on Steve to drag him back a few steps, and Tony unsteadily bolted for the nearest waste bin to heave up what little he ate for breakfast. A cold yet soothing hand petted his neck and back as he stayed hunched over, spitting the foul taste out of his mouth. Unsteady, he carefully leaned back up, shooting Sam a grateful smile as the man kept a firm hand on his upper back.
“Oh, sweetheart, it’s okay, you’re safe,” Tony whispered, “PJ, I need you to look up, kiddo, okay? Look at me, honeybunches.”
Tony bit his lip and nodded, tears immediately welling up in his eyes at the thought. He tried to wipe them away on his sleeve, but Bruce was fast on the draw and offered him a handkerchief. He took it without question and dabbed at his face, gritting his teeth to keep from outright bawling.
“For a big man, he is quite light-footed, no?” The eldest woman said, smiling at Tony’s shock, “Not all of us are native Northerners, dear. Some are Southerners and others can speak the language.”
“Shh, love, I am here,” he whispered, wiggling a finger into Peter’s tiny fist for the baby the hold onto, “Go back to sleep. I will keep you safe, I promise.”
The word left a bitter taste on his tongue; he was still warming up to the idea of being bound to Steve. Surely, he thought he might have come around after experiencing the Prime’s seemingly bottomless kindness, but commitment was difficult, especially for someone who had been abandoned before.
He felt his skin prickle as they nearly ran through a large hangar, with their one measly guard forcing them into the back of a truck. A second guard slipped in with them, and the first guard hesitated, but ultimately slid into the driver’s side and started up the car.
Then, the world tried to end, he found out he wasn’t exactly alone in his weirdness, his things were shuffled around, and he found himself trying to not only navigate the 21st century, but navigating it in a completely weird environment with nothing even remotely familiar to soothe him.
“No, no, he needs to learn, he is a
Tony ignored their bickering and started the math lesson that Miss Hill was trying to teach. He found himself picking it up after the first two problems and easily completed the rest of the booklet, sliding out of his chair once he was finished to turn it in at the front of the room. Miss Hill thanked him, but when he turned around, Tony was suddenly aware of the silence in the room and the eyes on him. He ducked his head to stare at his feet on his way back to his chair, taking short breaths to keep himself from crying, because
Croissants, lasagna, pad Thai, moo goo gai pan—whatever he could find, he tried, and more often than not, he liked it. Being able to taste new, rich, and exotic flavors was addicting, and being able to blame his consumption on his new metabolism was an incredible bonus.
Tony had spat out his drink and coughed deeply, waving away Bruce’s apology.
“What does
“Gods,
Tony shook the thought from his head and smiled at his boyfriend, taking his hand once he was ready to leave. They had suit fittings booked for the morning; Steve grew out of his last one, and Tony was always in the market for new threads, especially since he wanted to celebrate graduation with something flashy. Technically, they had already picked out the suits they wanted, and this was a final alterations check. Steve had chosen a tuxedo in navy brought in at the waist to accentuate his shoulders and chest, with straight pant legs to draw the eye upward. When he stood on the short platform and looked at himself in the mirror, straightening out the cuffs and collar, Tony had to sit down or risk creaming himself in front of the tailor.
ticked, but I think he’ll appreciate it.”
those situations.”
“Steve, you are scaring the baby,” he whispered out of the corner of his mouth.
“What, Steve?” Tony asked, hovering over Steve as he blinked at him innocently, “Meant what?”
“Jesus, Stark, let me think,” Natasha muttered, looking at the scattered papers around the room, “If it survived this long without dying, it can survive a little longer while we figure out what it
. However, with an exasperated grunt from Steve, his backpack was tugged off, causing Tony to gasp and grab for it.
“The Prime is not going to hurt me. I am going to be right here, nice and alive, okay? I promise,” Rhodey soothed, “I do think he is a good man under all that muscle. If he wanted to end my life, he would have done so already. There is no need to worry that you might lose me, or that you feel like you have to choose between us. We are both here to support you and Peter.”
“Rhodey told me you know,” he said between kisses, pulling back with a sheepish smile, “Buck and I were worried for so long, thinking we were going to get put away, and then he tells us you hacked into the Pentagon and figured it out yourself.”
“Am I allowed to say I told you so?” She said, passing Peter over.
He turned to bid Thor goodnight, but the linguist had somehow left them without him noticing. That meant that he and Steve were alone again and judging by the body language of the Alpha, they were going to be dancing around each other again if he did not take the initiative to comfort Steve.
“What?” He asked, unaware he was bouncing PJ as he stood in place.
“Not for public consumption, and like you said, I wasn’t even
He growled in response and nosed at Peter’s cheek, pleased to hear the babe’s soft babbles. With one part of his pack checked over, Steve returned to Tony and scented his way back up his body, only to stop at the bonding glands on his neck. He flicked his tongue over them and Tony whimpered at the feeling.
to have given up being Iron Man.”
“Yes?” He drawled, plastering a smile on his face, “What’s up, pumpkin pie?”
Tony, was hurting and unconscious after going through God-only-knows-what-kind of torture for
“Just give ‘im to Cap,” The archer snorted, plucking out one of his hearing aids to clean it on his shirt, “Steve doesn’t mind.”
“Tony!”
“It is not your fault,” he said, making sure to make eye contact with Tony, “She was smart, yes? Then she had every chance to go to the doctor or to expose the secret, but she did not. She assumed the risks, just as you did. Now you have to carry on, not only for her, but for Peter’s sake as well. He is going to need you more than ever now that that half of his bond is gone.”
“Howard probably wanted you to do the dirty work for him,” Tony said bitterly, picking up Steve’s arm to gently scrub down, “Maybe he would have given you a reward.”
“Yes--so good, so very good,” Tony slurred, “You can pinch them, it will not hurt me, I promise--”
“You remember the incident? Junior year?” Steve asked, flushing a little under Rhodey’s glare, “Well, the summer before, Buck and I didn’t…
, he decided, too exhausted to even pull his foot away.
“It’s okay. You can cuddle me in a much larger bed once I’m good to leave,” he promised, his smirk widening as Steve’s blush traveled down to his neck again, “You aren’t that good at hiding embarrassment, are you?”
“Title?” Tony called, squinting.
He sighed sadly and looked away, unable to look his friend in the eye.
“Aye, we don’t really need you, bitch. As long as I kill you, we’ll have at least one notch on our belts,” the guard growled, using Tony as a human shield, “Or, maybe I’ll just—what’s this? A fancy little scar?”
“We need to talk about your clothing choices at some point,” he said, raising an eyebrow at Steve’s grunt, “Not that I do not love having your body on display, but I really would like it to be a sight for only my eyes. Plus, seeing you nearly naked makes me want to ravish you all the time, and it really is not healthy to think of sex that often.”
Bruce squinted at him so he squinted back, giving a real smile when Bruce rolled his eyes and gave up.
“I would have liked to meet her. From what I hear, she was much like my own mother. Strong. Beautiful. A hell of a cook.”
“He will always love you, Tony. He may not understand, but he will in time--all he knows now is that his daddy and protector have all but left him alone. You need to comfort him, my love. Even if it is by resting together or just taking a short walk outside.”
He climbed into the bath with him and started their routine by distracting Peter with tickles and pokes as he soaped him up. The toddler was enjoying himself, but then Tony moved to his hair and he became very still and quiet.
, but his body was all but crying out for a mate that was not there.
Rhodey exhaled, rolling his eyes up the ceiling before shaking his head.
Tony laughed when the door shut in his face, unable to be mad when he knew just how fussy the baby could be. He kissed Peter’s cheeks and brushed away his tears, cooing when the baby started to hiccup from his cries.
Tony became quiet for a moment, moving the steel around the coals before transferring it to an anvil.
Rhodey laughed and squeezed Tony’s knee, standing up from his chair with a grunt.
“Shhh, my love. Let me take care of you,” Steve managed, forcibly stomping down the primal urge to claim Tony right there, “We should wash off the day first.”
“Is it jizz? Because that’s a million times worse.”
?” She asked softly, concern lacing her usually stoic features, “We can’t read minds, little one.”
“I knew that was what you had, I thought you said your favorite was strawberry since you can finally eat it!”
“Wrong wording, beloved,” he sighed, looking up to watch Clint whoop and Bucky try to move toward him again.
Unbeta'd. Comments, kudos, and art really appreciated. You can ask me questions over at @avengersasssemble on tumblr.com.
“Damn it.”
The boy nodded, sitting up and tugging his elephant into a tight hug. He looked at the door where Steve had walked out, whimpering softly when Tony put a hand on his back.
“My turn, hm?” He whispered, squeezing Steve’s hand back.
“I thought you weren’t that kind of doctor.”
“What’s going on?” Tony asked, a bit bewildered as Bruce approached him with his own packet, “News on HYDRA?”
“It will have plenty of time to sleep. Now, I have matters to discuss,” Zola continued, “The fact that the subject is alive is…impressive. Upon your
Carefully, he grabbed a tissue from the box that had thumped against his legs, reaching up to wipe the tears from the boy’s face. Tony softly shushed him, being as delicate as possible. Once PJ’s face was cleaned off, he smiled softly, tucking away the used tissue.
Not that the showers in the 40s were all that different; no, the look of the shower was fine, but the water pressure was…intense, to say the least. At least in his SHIELD housing in Brooklyn, the pipes were the same small copper lines, and with enough finagling, he could make the water the same loose drips that he had been used to when Sarah was unable to pay their monthly water bill.
“I’m not going to ask,” he said, setting the tray down on the end of the bed, “Can you wake PJ up? I need to do his draw so we can get the samples to processing.”
” Steve seethed, whirling around with blazing eyes to lock onto his target, “
As he closed it, a laminated piece of paper slipped out of the back of it, landing on his lap. He picked it up and turned it over, only to choke on his own gasp. There was Steve’s robot drawing from preschool, carefully secured to the paper to prevent any more rips and tears in it. The crumples and bits missing were just as Tony remembered them before he’d tossed it in the trash last year.
“Tones, let’s go,” Rhodey said, “We need to move.
“Tony,” Sarah interrupted gently, moving to his other side to pick up his hand, “You can’t handle it, love. No one can. It’s not right to treat anyone in that manner, especially not you, darling.”
hoping he recognizes you or Steve. Less because of who you are, but more of because your eyes will be familiar to him. But that’s the best case scenario. Worst case is he absolutely freaks out since he won’t know where he is or who any of us are and we have to subdue him.”
Steve looked surprised, but then made a face of understanding and nodded, leaning down to kiss his cheek. Rhodey made a gagging sound from somewhere behind them but Tony ignored it, nuzzling into Steve.
“Hey, hey, it’s okay, it’s not a bad thing,” Tony tried, ignoring Steve as he crouched back down to PJ’s level, “It just means you have different colored eyes. It’s really cool. There’s no need to cry, yeah?”
“What? You want to go say hi to Bruce and Natasha?” Tony asked, turning his head to see where the boy was looking.
about it. He knew that Steve could easily kill either Rhodey or him if he chose to do so. Plus, since Steve was technically his Alpha now, it would be within his rights to challenge any Alpha that he thought was attempting to take his mate. Did he think Steve would ever actually do it? No, probably not--but the thought of possibly losing Rhodey put a fear into him like nothing else, and he only noticed it when Rhodey physically pulled away from him.
Another quick kiss and then they were gone, leaving Tony alone in the forge with nothing but his doubts and the crackling fire. He turned to the steel with a sigh, shoving it back into the hot coals to soften it once more. Finishing the sword he was working on would take a full night’s work if he did not stop, so he continued on. It was
“If you were on time, you would be,” Tony answered back, rolling his eyes again, “After you, Capsicle. You can set off any booby traps for us.”
“I apologize for earlier,” Tony murmured, allowing Steve to place a hand on his cheek, “I… jumped to conclusions. And that was in err. Please do not think less of me for it…”
“Come.”
As soon as he walked into the dining room, Tony became increasingly aware of just how loud the Warlords could be: Sam was pounding the table in roaring laughter at something Bucky had said, Natasha was tending to Clint while talking to him and Rhodey, and Thor and Bruce were attempting to have their own conversation overtop of the noise. It was loud enough to make Peter shift and whimper in his carrier, so Tony quickly unwrapped him and cradled him close, shushing him while Steve went off to try to get the others to quiet down.
“Hey, are you real smarts?” Steve’s voice interrupted, “I’m kinda smarts, but not at maths. Do you wanna help me?”
“Yeah, hammer time, I know,” he grinned, patting Thor’s back.
Steve froze, but then nodded, setting the bag back onto the floor before nervously playing with his hands again. Tony took notice and sighed, gently grabbing both of Steve’s hands with one of his own.
“Time to wake up, darling,” he whispered, smoothing Steve’s hair back, “The faster we eat, the faster you get to bed me.”
“Hey, hey. Don’t beat yourself up. Neither of us are exactly great when it comes to emotions and shit.”
is not the Omega, then.”
“What?” Steve asked, not missing the noise, “What is it?”
“PJ,” Bruce affirmed, lightly elbowing Tony’s side with a smile, “He definitely looks like a PJ.”
“Shh. Another moment and then we can all cozy up together,” Steve’s calm voice said from somewhere above him.
They all exchanged looks, but only Bruce had the decency to look ashamed. It infuriated him that they took such a big risk, but he could not dwell on the feeling in case he set off Steve again. Instead, he put a hand on the Prime’s shoulder and guided him back toward their bedroom, ignoring the man’s grabby hands once they were inside with the door closed.
“Oof, language,” Tony murmured, lips twitching into a smirk at Steve’s sheepish laugh.
“Tony?” he tried, his voice sluggish from sleep.
injured, so I think you should make me a sandwich, too.”
He held out clothing for him to change into, then beamed and picked up the top two articles and handed it over first. Confused, Tony took it, and upon realizing what they were, flushed a dark scarlet. The first was clearly underwear, but the bottom portion that sat between his legs was thicker, filled with padding for Omega slick. The second was a nursing undergarment, meant to support breasts that were filled with milk for their offspring. Tony shook his head and handed it back over, sheepishly keeping the underwear clutched in his hand.
Without looking, Rhodey’s arm snuck around Tony’s waist and pulled him in, a long-standing reflex for them. Tony smiled and leaned his head on Rhodey’s shoulder, inhaling his friend’s warm scent as Rhodey turned to bump their foreheads together so he could look down at Peter.
of Steve’s footsteps up the stairs brought him running to the doorway. He looked between the two of them before visibly relaxing, seeing no immediate danger.
“Ah. Easier than looking for ties and keeping track of them,” Tony said, watching Steve bend over to put the pot on the floor when he was finished with it, “Smart. I am glad I do not have to do that with my own hair, though. I prefer it to be short.”
going to beat him. He has seen my nudity, he should know how I feel about that,” Tony growled, grabbing Steve’s chin and tilting his head up, “Understand? If you want something, or wish to help, you find someone who speaks my dialect to tell me. We need to
He recognized the steps in his subconscious, forcing him to jolt awake. Sitting up straight, Tony clambered off Steve’s lap awkwardly, trying to make it to the door to close it before the footsteps got too close.
Things he has not felt in a long time.
“I’m not one either, but Mom likes to embarrass me by taking a lot of pictures.”
“I’m guessing you won’t lube your fist first? I don’t blame you,” Bucky said, propping his feet up on the bed, only to have Rhodey smack his legs, “Hey!”
“Baby, I loved it. I’m not making fun of you,” Steve laughed softly, taking Tony’s hands to squeeze, “I’m excited to read all of them.”
“You wrote me like a real douche, so I’d hope you’d say it was inaccurate,” Steve mumbled.
Tony flushed bright red and sputtered, clapping a hand over his eyes as Steve wheeled him down and out of the plane; much to his horror, all of their friends were gathered and waiting for them, cheering as they appeared.
dating Ms. Potts?” he asked.
“You sure?”
“Yes,” He answered smugly, resting his head on Steve’s in turn, “It’s a good movie, Steve.”
“James as a middle name would work,” he decided, brushing a few stray curls out of the boy’s face, “I don’t think Rhodes would be totally on board with me naming a HYDRA experiment after him, regardless of it being a child.”
“Yeah but Superman makes my lips turn purple, so it’s the best,” Clint argued, jabbing a finger into Bucky’s chest, “You’re really off of your ice cream game, man. I barely order anything else than Superman!”
“Se’even,” the Prime answered, beaming when he understood, “
“Come home safe,” Tony repeated once they pulled away, panting as he ran his thumb over Steve’s swollen bottom lip, “Do not make me fall for you only to lose you.”
He looked up at Thor and tilted his head at Steve, nodding to insinuate that he should translate. Thor barely had the sentence out when Steve made a choked noise; Tony stiffed and schooled his face, keeping his eyes on Peter so he would not have to see the disappointment on his new Alpha’s face.
Tiny fingers reached up to grab at his beard and he smiled, gently pulling the digits away so he could kiss them as well. Tony bid Rhodey goodbye and headed out to the hall, unsurprised to see Steve leaning against the wall with his cloak. He held his hand out and the Prime handed it over with a grunt.
There was a murmur of agreement, and with a nod from Natasha, the group began to collect into their teams and split, leaving Tony with Steve and Clint in the living room. Looking at the various papers still scattered, Tony grumbled under his breath about running a bed and breakfast, picking up the loose sheets.
Huffing up at Tony, Steve finally relented and nodded, moving into a sitting position once the other clambered off of him.
“I trust the Prime has taken care of you both well so far?” he asked, smiling at Peter when the baby peeked out from Tony to look at him, “He is…concerned that he has not been treating you properly in the way you need. Is there something you need from him? It will be easiest for me to tell him in his language.”
Tony grunted and did as he was asked, letting the nurse bandage his chest up, careful to avoid the arc reactor. He grunted a bit at the new pressure, but the familiarity of having set ribs at least eased his mind.
The six guards stared at him for a moment, but one of them eventually split off, returning with a blanket that Tony noted was similar to the blanket he had found in the original compound to wrap PJ in. With a nod, Tony backed off from the doorway, watching the iron door close with four hefty clicks.
“As cute as this is, we need to get going,” Clint said, nudging Tony’s pack with his foot.
“Nah. He might chew you out, but he’ll come after my ass for moving before ever going after you.”
After some maneuvering and a few close calls, Tony managed to get the suit off and into sentry mode, now cradling the child close to his own chest without disturbing the arc reactor. Bouncing slightly on his heels, he moved in circles around the room, hoping that he didn’t accidentally wake the child.
“I apologize, I did not mean—” Thor broke off and started to argue in the Northern tongue, presumably talking to Steve before returning to the Southern dialect, “—I apologize. He is most worried about you, friend. I did not mean to scare you with such talk. It is not a worry for many, many moons. Your own babe will be in stockings by that time, and perhaps you and the Prime will have already had a second of your own choosing. I know that the world around you has shifted in a way you could have never predicted, but fear not, for our Prime would not force you into conceiving if you do not want to. He is a good man, Tony.”
but did not ask Tony anything until he came to the gash on Steve’s side.
longer than you have, and even if he and I are not bonded, I still care about him and he is still going to remain as one of my closest friends, whether you like it or not. Sure, he should not have flown off the handle, but--”
“You lot worry like a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off,” Bucky muttered under his breath.
“Last time I checked, I didn’t have a test tube baby, Tasha,” Tony replied hesitantly, taking the papers.
“Why?”
He stepped out to find Steve standing over Peter, a smitten look on his face as he let the baby play with one of his fingers. Tony smiled and sidled up to him, giggling softly when Steve jumped.
Tony grinned, watching PJ start to inspect the device closer. He poked a bit at the glass, seemingly testing its integrity before laying down next to it, snuggled into Tony’s chest. Keeping his fingertips over the glow, he looked at the book in Tony’s hand before looking back up, waiting.
“Okay. If you need me, tell Nat, and I’ll come right away, I promise,” He soothed, “Go eat, pumpkin. I’ll be back.”
A small frustrated noise erupted between them, causing both adults to look at the child. He pouted up at Pepper, his bottom lip stuck out as he semi-glared up at her. She blinked before taking her hand from Tony’s hair, sliding it into PJ’s curls. Though he didn’t relax, the pout left his face and he settled again on Tony’s chest.
child, he’s going back to the Tower with me. You can try to fight me, tooth and nail, but you won’t win against
“What’s your favorite?”
“It is not news, but since my arm is broken, I will not be able to go to battle for a few months,” Clint said while frowning at his sling, “At least the winter is nearly upon us. Have you thought about what we are to do when the spring comes? That would be the soonest that Stark would try another assault.”
Like Tony.
He was finally about to nod off, exhausted from the whole ordeal, when hurried footsteps echoed down the hall and the door slammed open with a bang, causing him to shout and PJ to scream and burst into tears.
Steve gently took hold of Tony’s hand between his own two, looking up under his long lashes to give him a small smile.
“I’m sure she’s head over heels for you, Cap,” he assured, “What’s not to like, right? You just have to ask her.”
,” he whined, “Your prick is too good--”
Bruce raised an eyebrow, leaning a bit forward in interest.
“Irish skin. Can’t help it. Bucky makes fun of me for it, too,” Steve sighed, wincing himself as he sat up, “God, these beds are uncomfortable. With the amount of money that goes through SHIELD, you’d think they could make a fund for comfortable beds.”
Tony scowled and shifted himself down on the bed, readjusting himself and Peter and forcing Bruce to stand up. He put Peter in the middle of his chest to best support the babe, wincing slightly when his small hands clutched at his chest hair.
“Yes, Tony. You will. Isn’t that what you wanted Pepper to do?” Bruce answered calmly, narrowing his eyes a bit, “You’ll be okay, Tony. You always figure these things out. Now. I just got PJ’s slides, so I’m going to go look at that. Go talk to Steve.”
Steve was quiet as the others chattered, finding Tony’s hand again. On that occasion, he had been the one who stayed up the latest, making sure Thor, Bucky, and Bruce were asleep before waiting for Tony to come back after Mr. Stark had called him in to talk. Of course, he was ever curious and stood outside Mr. Stark’s study to peek in on Tony.
Tony moved Peter back down to cradle in his arms, kissing the baby’s head as they walked back to the dining room. The others paid them no mind, except when they sat back down, Rhodey immediately put his arm back around Tony and pulled him in.
Bruce talked like he breathed torrential winds, which of course flew right over Tony’s sick-addled brain. All he could do was nod, weakly letting Bruce heft Peter up out of his arms. He thought that the babe might begin to cry again, but after a moment in the doctor’s arms, Peter settled, which soothed his worry.

promise.”
“He did, and its because he’s been in his uncomfortable pull-ups since the safe house,” Steve called from the bathroom.
“You already have a baby to look after--that is, unless you are telling me you do not want Peter since he is not yours?” Tony said icily.
“Even so, I understand if you want to put off our, ah, consummation,” he said quietly, a pink flush covering his cheeks and the tips of his ears.
The Warlord snarled and Tony clamped his mouth shut, the audible clack of his teeth horribly loud in the otherwise silent room. He stared straight ahead and tried to not whimper, but it was proving difficult, especially when Steve scraped his teeth over his glands. It tore a gasp from his throat and he shivered, but his biology had him relax and offer up better access to his throat. Pleased, Steve pulled back to lick his lips and Tony gasped again, this time at seeing how dilated the man’s pupils were.
“No, I’ve seen your off days. That’s eating eight peanut butter and honey sandwiches at lunch. You only eat ice cream by yourself to either celebrate a day off or to mope,” Tony snorted back, “And considering we don’t really have days off anymore…”
“The manacles coming out of the wall got both of us pretty good,” Tony admitted, feeling a lot safer with the other Omega around, “I knew he was strong, but to rip that out of the stone…”
Steve growled and picked up his pace until he could hear the bed frame start to slam repetitively against the wall. He allowed himself to look down, watching his cock disappear into Tony with an ungodly squelching noise that really should not be turning him on as much as it was.
Tony rolled his eyes and scooted to the edge of the car, not at all feeling bad as pushed the unconscious guard aside.
“No. You are now my bodyguard until this is over,” Tony said flatly, instantly feeling calmer when the familiar weight was tucked up against his chest, “He is either going into a rut or thinks sex is the best form of claiming, and I am not going to be the one to stab his balls if he tries it again.”
“That’s Wanda, she’s a witch and can move things with her mind. You already know Sam and Bucky, then that’s Clint. He does archery and likes purple. And finally, this is Pepper. She’s Tony’s best friend. She does paperwork for us sometimes, but she mostly keeps Tony sane,” Natasha was saying, pointing out each person to PJ as he giggled.
Clint merely turning to grin and send finger-guns at Steve as he stood from his desk and moved, under-handedly fist-bumping Bucky and Sam on his way out of the door behind Fury. As soon as they left, Mr. Coulson took up his reign at the front of the room, launching into the assignments due that week. Tony sighed and scribbled down the work before turning his attention to Steve; it's not that he was a large worrywart, but when it came to Steve being stubborn, he tended to let his mind fret. It had been enough of an ordeal to convince him to take his inhaler when he was running laps for soccer, so a back brace was out of the question.
Embarrassed, Tony clapped a hand over his bruised bondmark and winced, inwardly hating that his body betrayed his emotions.
Steve pouted but didn’t offer up an answer, making the kids laugh. Thankfully, the drive from the school to the mansion was only a few minutes, so they were all soon distracted by staring out of the limo windows, gasping up at the building.
“He has definitely been through physical torture,” she continued softly, turning her gaze to PJ, “There’s evidence to show that he most likely has several improperly healed fractures and breaks on his ribs. Though we’re waiting for the CAT scan machine to be prepped, I would bet that it’ll show us exactly that. However, there may be more damage than that to other bones, or possibly his organs. We’ll just have to wait and see. I want you to be aware of the worst case scenario here.”
“Yep,” Tony blurted, side-stepping around Steve to head to the elevator, “C’mon, kiddo, let’s go get you juice and do stuff. Yeah?”
“We should still take him down to medical,” Bruce advised, watching them both with a keen eye, “I want a CAT scan on him, anyway. Plus, they can give us a better judgment on how to proceed with making sure he gets his strength back and how to continue to help him to cope. From what Steve was saying, he had a pretty bad nightmare, yes?”
“What?” he snapped, “It’s his favorite.”
He worked the soap and lathered up his hands before beginning to massage Steve’s right arm, gently washing away the dried-up war paint. Steve was silent while he worked, only uttering the occasional grunt when Tony found a knot in his muscles. Not wanting the man to suffer, Tony easily teased them loose, shivering at Steve’s barely-repressed moans.
Peter stuck his hand in his mouth as an answer, causing Tony to huff with laughter and kiss the babe’s head. He looked over to catch the Prime staring, smirking when Steve blushed and shoveled in the rest of his breakfast.
. You think I’m some big shot? Have you
Tony sifted his fingers through PJ’s curls until the child seemed to tire again, curling up against Tony’s chest with his hand on the reactor. Of course, the usual anxiety settled behind the hunk of metal, but seeing how peaceful the child looked, basked in the cerulean light—he couldn’t help but feel a smile twitch onto his lips.
“Okay! Time for bed, everyone go piss and sleep,
“We’re getting
“I know,” Tony said softly, looking down as he wrung his hands between his knees, “And there was a bit there where I was knocked out cold and he was in their hands. I don’t know what happened, but I have a feeling that if I ask, I won’t get an answer.”
“He never displayed any aggressive tendencies like it before, and hasn’t since,” Steve said gently, putting his fist under his chin, “But I see what you’re trying to get at. If he does have super strength or at least some percentage of it, someone with similar ability should watch him in case he does become aggressive.”
“Yeah. Bathroom break,” Tony answered, leaning against the wall with his shoulder, “He’s pretty much potty trained. At least, he knows to ask when he has to go.”
Steve glanced around the room and nodded, shrugging his shoulders.
to willingly bond with you. You have known me enough moons now to know that I would not have let you do so if I did not desire it. Banish the thought from your head, and come
He leaned back and turned his watery smile to Steve and Natasha, not budging from his new spot.
you are--”
He stood and winced, ignoring the sharp pain in his side from Tony writhing on his wound. Careful, he helped Tony up and carried him out to the bed, laying him back down and spreading his legs out. Tony looked absolutely debauched: his hair was wild and askew, eyes nearly completely black with lust and cock red and thick, leaking against his belly.
Already feeling sick at the thought, Tony took another breath, making a secondary note to create a vomit protocol for when he was outside of the suit.
He tucked Peter up under his shirt and against his chest, creating a warm cocoon for him to hopefully feel safe in. The whining did reduce to whimpers, and with a few practiced shifts, the allure of a meal finally got him quiet. All four men let out a sigh of relief at the welcome silence.
“I used to jerk off onto your old posters, babe,” he snorted, standing to move over to the couch to crawl under the blanket with Steve, ignoring Steve’s pressing problem, “Of course that was my fantasy. You have always, unequivocally, been my favorite wet dream. That being said, would you like some help?”
“Support his head.”
“What the hell happened in here?” He asked once he stepped foot in the room, seeing a half-nude toddler running around and Steve sitting in the middle of the room, completely drenched.
“Tony?”
“Well, he did not try to jump us, so better than expected,” Clint drawled, barely dodging the hand that tried to smack him, “Hey!”
“Oh, sweet gods, you two better get me out of here--if he tries to take me on the dirty floor I
,” Tony panted into Steve’s neck.
. Please?”
Tony stared at Steve for a few seconds before letting out a relieved breath, clapping a hand over his heart to steady himself.
“No, no, he’s right,” Tony sighed, “But that doesn’t mean we’re shacking up, Barnes.”
“—Okay, yes, but still—”
“Look, Tones. I’ve known you long enough to at least suspect when you’re not okay. If you want to talk, you know I’ve got your back.”
found out about his home life, Steve had gone home and tattled to his mom Sarah. He pictured Steve with his fierce eyes and mouth twisted in the upset frown that he got when he was especially bothered about something, parading around his house as Sarah tried to calm him down. Being an adult, she called Child Protection Services, but the rumor was paid off before the news outlets could even catch wind of the event. Since then, Tony had tried to run away from home multiple times, but that always ended in getting beat worse than before. Sarah had offered her home to him, but Tony had told her—and Steve—that things were better and that he was okay.
“Whoa, whoa there, kiddo, it’s okay,” Tony soothed, quickly bending down to PJ’s level, “They’re friends. They’re good guys. The one with the metal arm I told you about already. That’s Bucky. The darker man with the red shirt is Sam and the tall guy with yellow hair is Steve.”
Tony breathed out a sigh of relief and thanked the Warlord, whispering the good news to Peter as they headed into the forest. It only took a minute for them to reach the carriage, already hitched up and ready for the ride back. The Warlord helped Tony up before climbing up and sitting next to him, nodding to the driver to begin.
It seemed like forever until a knock came from the door; expecting Bruce, Tony looked up, only to see a few white coats.
“Oh, is that what it is?” Steve called after him with a snicker.
“You know
“Hey,” he said as he approached the bench, plopping down next to Steve.
“What?” Steve said, raising a brow, “I figure he should have a name. We can’t just call him pronouns for the rest of his life.”
“I seem to spend more time comforting you than my infant son,” Tony said, moving Peter down to cradle him in one arm so he could reach up to pat one of Steve’s hands, “You seem very sensitive to how I feel, no? For being unbonded, that is. I promise I am alright, Alpha. Bad thoughts come after us all sometimes.”
If there was an emotion beyond shameful embarrassment, Tony was feeling it down to his toes. He ever so carefully lifted his hips so Steve could pull off his pants and underwear, then slowly opened his legs up.
“For the most part, it was fine,” he started, “Other than the getting banged up. However, Zola was intent on having us shipped out to a different location for testing. I’m hoping that Nat will bring back enough information that J can do a scan and get us some coordinates. Getting out of there was a bit of a fickle. Rhodey didn’t tell me it was him jailbreaking us, so I figured we were just running for our lives until Clint and Steve showed up. I collapsed somewhere in the middle of it all, and woke up at your—”
Finally spotting Fury exiting the craft, Tony looked down at the kid then back up, thinking of a million ways to try and explain
“Oh. Steve came back to get it. Said he found food and is using it as a basket.”
Carefully, he motioned to Steve with Peter, and after a moment of mutual understanding, he slowly transferred the baby to Steve’s arms, positioning his head just right. Tony put out both his hands, making sure Steve was watching him.
,” Steve gasped, pushing Tony into the building, much to the disgust of the people around them.
“He is right, Steve. This is not about you and Tony anymore. There is more at stake here than a ritual,” Natasha said, “You have to think further ahead than Howard. Imagine if you did knock Tony up and then his father, who despises you, captured him. What do you think would happen?”
“Shut up,” Steve grumbled, folding his arms over his chest, “I’m trying to make a point. Coming from someone who lives a generally sparse, reserved life, people who fill a room when they walk in kind of make fellas like me a little nervous. I mean, I’m self-aware of it, considering my physical…size…tends to attract attention. I’m still this little scrapper from Brooklyn, and having
do is check in with the others and get updates about my men and any news that may have come in. As much as I want to stay in bed with you--”
“Those boxes have clothes,” Steve pointed to a stack in one corner, “And the boxes in the living room are mostly book and toys. A team meeting sounds like a good idea. Hopefully, after that—"
Suddenly, the bond began to flare enough to catch his attention; curious, Tony closed his eyes and concentrated on it, feeling Steve’s drowsiness as he began to wake. Impatient, Tony prodded at the bond, feeling Steve go from drowsy to awake in seconds. Confusion filtered through, and then deep sadness and guilt, bad enough to cause Tony to open his eyes and gasp. Peter made a curious noise and grabbed at his dad’s shirt, no doubt also sensing Steve.
with him lately? He felt like he was constantly on the edge of the cliff, one wrong step away from falling over and going berzerk. If he was honest with himself, the fragility scared him. The new life he had built could be ripped away from him in seconds--not that he
Tony sighed and turned to find Bruce standing behind him, smiling when he saw the wistful look on the doctor’s face. A small question wormed its way into his head, but he tucked it away, figuring that he may not get an answer if he were to ask Bruce outright.
“Idiot. I have put my ass on the line for you multiple times, and you think I would suddenly desert you over proper suckling? You really are stupider than I thought.”
“He’s not a normal boy,” Tony finished, shaking his head, “We’ll also have to test his knowledge, eventually. When he wakes up. He might display intellect, but they probably didn’t teach him colors and shapes in HYDRA preschool.”
“My plan was a flying suit that also had working flamethrowers,” Tony corrected, grinning at Steve’s fond sigh, “It
He peeked down to check on Peter, unable to help a smile at the baby’s sleepy eyes. He was so precious tucked up against his chest, slowly drifting off to sleep as he finished his meal.
Another crash followed by loud shushing seemed to come from on the other side of the wall. If it was Steve attempting to get into the room, Tony knew he needed to move Peter to his bassinet in the hopes that he would be safer there.
“Hey!” he complained, already feeling embarrassed, “I can walk!”
“He really is beautiful, Tony. He absolutely is,” she repeated, a look of awe on her face.
“Now, this time, do you want to bathe? If so, that comes first so I do not waste any supplies,” Tony said casually as he put his supplies on the counter.
Steve’s shoulders hunched and his jaw clenched as he looked away, clearly displeased by the answer. He ignored the Alpha’s childish response and turned back to Peter, idly running his fingers over the babe’s cheek. He watched the boy’s eyes steadily become sleepier until he was nearly asleep against his chest, only held up by a gentle grip on his daddy’s chest hair.
PJ crawled up onto the couch between the two of them, his elephant tucked under his arm and books under the other. He deposited the books in Tony’s lap, looking up at him expectantly.
“Nothing, nothing. We merely have trouble keeping it together sometimes when you talk of your new plaything,” Barnes said, winking back at Tony.
They both shook their heads and he choked on a painful sob, holding the bundle a little tighter to his chest. He barely had the second to gather himself together, attempting to force down his body’s need to shake with fear.
Steve shook his head, moving to retrieve the medical kit from the cupboard.
“Let him rest. You can snuggle with him later, when we go for a walk,” Tony said quietly.
“Good, because you’re going to have to,” Natasha’s voice said from behind him, making him squeak in surprise, “We’re leaving for Africa within the hour, so you three better get packed and ready. Tony, a word.”
He bit his lip, knowing that if he spilled more that he was probably going to spill it all anyway.
“Oh, Tony,” Pepper said sympathetically, shaking her head, “He’ll be back in a month. Then you two can do all the finger-painting you want. I bet he’ll be impressed that PJ knows his colors.”
“You didn’t. Bruce did,” Rhodey laughed, “You gave each of us money for a safehouse, right? This is one of his. He said you owe him for a new safehouse that you won’t be able to find and bother him in.”
Russian,” Natasha corrected, a gentle smile on her ruby lips, “And I get cold plenty. Bucky’s sweaters help with that, though.”
Multitasking was difficult when crashing. He pitched forward a number of times, falling asleep on his feet. Seeing Tony struggle, Steve stepped in to help him, a hand on his elbow and on his waist. Slowly, he lowered Tony and Peter into the water, but he could see that Tony was lagging, having to lean against the side of the bath to stay upright. He took pity on the poor man and stripped down himself, making sure his shield was placed down carefully, unlike his clothes. The water was hot when he finally stepped in, sliding down behind Tony with a quiet moan as his sore muscles began to relax. Once he was settled, he tugged Tony back to rest on his chest, making sure that Peter was also safe and in reach.
Thor merely patted his shoulder, holding him steady. The carriage came to a halt and Thor jumped out, offering up a hand for Tony to grab onto. With Peter in the crook of his arm, Tony took Thor’s hand and gingerly climbed down before shifting his packs to a more comfortable position. As Thor led them into the main castle, Tony was constantly prodded on by the guards, but he could not help his dallying as the inside of the structure was just as grand as the outside. Stained glass shone colored scenes on the polished floors, just out of reach of the ornate carpet that stretched out from the door and into the throne room.
“He—He said that you must truly be a broken soul, to mistake kindness for unkindness,” He said sadly, “He says he intends to show you a whole life, one where you are not afraid anymore. He cannot understand your reasoning, but he can understand your spirit and your need to protect yourself and your child. He wants to see you happy, friend. And he believes that you and Peter will be happy with him.”
do it again.”
Tony froze and nearly snapped his neck in turning to look at Rhodey. The realization that he was most likely going to have to feed his son in front of him made his face flare red with embarrassment. Sure, Rhodey was his best friend and had seen everything at least once, but Tony had no idea how he would react to the new development. Steve signaled him from the table and Tony sighed, resigning himself to his fate as he trudged over to sit between Steve and Rhodey.
“Is it too hot?” Steve asked, sticking his hand under, “It’s just like you like it. Do you want it differently? …Tony?”
Steve’s face flushed a pretty pink, then he slowly reached over to place a hand on Tony’s stomach. It took a second for him to understand, but when it clicked he shivered and shook his head.

. I told him to ask you to make him a set that will make sure he won’t die, but he got huffy and told me I didn’t know what I was talking about and then left for a mission the next morning. I keep calling, but his second keeps picking up and telling me he doesn’t want to talk.”
Shame crawled up his neck. Unable to look at Steve any longer, Tony turned his head and looked away, as he knew he was in the wrong. He heard Steve’s quiet sigh and winced, then whimpered when the Alpha let out a small growl.
“Okay, you guys. As much as sitting on the floor is fun for my old back, I need to get up,” Tony grunted, standing with a small whine, “Right. So, it’s getting late, and a certain someone needs to eat before we have some sort of bath and bed routine. Okay? Steve? You think you can feed him while I get this room ready for him for bed? He likes Clint’s cheerios and there should be apples or carrots somewhere in the fridge.”
“It’s called the arc reactor. It's basically a large magnet,” he explained, rubbing his thumb over Steve’s to try and help keep him calm, “When I first went to Afghanistan it was to show off a missile I’d recently developed. When—when we were traveling between sites, our caravan got attacked. I was the only—I was the only one who made it.”
Finally, the call had come in that the cavalry had been spotted, so he and Bruce had rushed outside with Peter to wait. A crowd had gathered around and after a lifetime of waiting, cheers erupted from the front, waking Peter and startling Tony out of his thoughts. He quickly moved the baby up to his shoulder and stepped away from the noise, standing off to the side where he could watch the Warlords ride through. He thought it was supposed to be a joyous occasion, but the cheers dwindled into eerie silence once the clop of the horses’ hooves could be heard. Lieutenant Barnes led the procession, focusing more on his horse’s mane than the people or anything else around him. His gaze was distant, and once the other Warlords showed, Tony understood why.
“Hush. You are not eating for two.”
“Thank the gods for small miracles,” he said, smiling when Natasha wiggled a finger in to rub Peter’s cheek.
He demonstrated on his own face before plucking out another tissue, handing it over to PJ. Tentatively, PJ took the tissue, almost perfectly replicating Tony’s demonstration. With his face wiped and his nose cleaned, the boy sighed in relief, handing back the used tissue to Tony. Ignoring the urge to vomit from the wet tissue now in his hand, Tony wrapped it in the tissue he had taken, stuffing it in his pocket for the moment.
“Do you not want me?” Tony groaned as he thrust up into his fist, “I saw the hunger in your eyes when you first saw me, you have wanted to mount me since.”
“Ah, t-thank you,” Tony stammered, doing his best to keep from squirming at Steve’s light touches, “Not quite what I wanted, but they
A chorus of ‘yes, mom’ rang out in the room; satisfied, Tony nodded, turning to Steve with a half-smile.
“Pwetty,” PJ whispered, inaudible had there been any other noise in the room.
Tony laughed while pulling an almost-asleep Peter from his breast, rearranging his clothes so he could lean the babe against his chest to pat his back.
. An Alpha, nervous about his knot?
“What are you saying?” Steve asked.
“Stand down,” he panted, “That is
“Bucky and I did that,” Clint butted in, having returned from the office the period prior, “So far, I’m winning, but he also didn’t get that skin piece—”
“Sometimes it is best to leave when you want to stay,” Wanda answered, putting a firm hand on the archer’s bicep, “Come. We can go do some needed group training, yeah?”

“Sam. Clint. Take James to the cells and chain him up, then come back to help us do the same for Steve,” Bucky ordered.
with his team was already embarrassing, but the fact that none of them were outwardly dating each other made it kind of awkward. Of course, there were suspicions and lots of PDA (gross, Bucky) but no one specifically said
“Yeah. Oh, yeah. Babies aren’t…well…it depends,” Tony said, “Personally, I like babies. Quiet ones. Loud, colicky babies can be a nuisance, but it’s really not their fault. You have to be especially careful with them, that’s all. And patient.”
“I am not sorry for protecting you,” Steve said darkly, “I would kill to keep you safe.”
“You are a good mother to him, Tony. Being willing to stand up to the Prime shows that,” Bruce said softly, all of the fight gone from his voice, “I will pass on your message, but please—be easy on him. He has lived a life much different from yours and is only trying to ease your transition here the best way he knows how. I have no doubt that if you asked, he would go and try to move the mountains for you. Whether or not you believe it, the Prime wants nothing but to give you a good, safe life. You
was Rhodey going to kill him once he saw it…. or kill Steve.
They stared at each other for a moment, the emotions and the weight of the situation somehow both heavier on their shoulders and also lifted. After a second, they laughed until Steve started to cry again, hanging his head until his chin touched his chest.
Thor cleared his throat and spoke to Steve, who shook his head in response.
“I promise.”
“Great,” Tony answered blandly, leaning slightly over a nearby trashcan to let PJ drop the used tissue in, “Good to know that instead of being concerned over the kid, you’re watching how graceful I am when balancing thirty pounds on my hips.”
