Once the tables were turned and Rumlow had a rifle to Steve’s head in the middle of the DC intersection, Steve felt nothing through the bond. Just an eerie dissonance rang when he thought of Bucky – the Winter Soldier. His core shook, rattled inside of him and no Soul Mantra regardless of the complexity or simplicity would quiet it. A strange kind of paradox conquered him where the soul bond felt miles away and untouchable while his own astral projection broke down and fragmented into so much cacophony.  What did his core, his astral projection want from him? He couldn’t fathom. He knew that his disquietude bothered both Sam and Natasha, but he sat in the bindings in the back of the SUV, stunned, shocked, and motionless.
Steve gazed up at Natasha and her face was a ruin of emotions. But she wasn’t still, she was at his side, holding her hands to his shoulder and his back. He wanted to say ‘what’ but the words locked up in his throat.
Steve whipped his head around to meet her gaze. Tears streaked his face and he growled at her, “I would never abandon Tony. Never! I would go through it again and again, what happened if it meant that Tony was safe. But he wasn’t safe. Do you get that? He should have been safe. That was my job.” He dropped his head back and covered his face with his hands.
“It will pass,” Strange assures and then continues with the card tricks.
“Your bed is in front of you, only about a meter. Pietro was correct he laid out your clothes exactly as you like. The bed’s turned down. Would you like me to check the bathroom?”
But then the shadows darken the world, and the light becomes a rigid pattern, boxing him into a corner in his mind until even he cannot sense the difference between reality and digital existence.
“It has a full face mask. Don’t you want to feel the wind on your face?” Steve gives the helmet to Tony.
“No thanks, ma’am,” Steve replies and turns Tony toward the door.
The Archangel Fury will decide. “But I convinced the board, especially Phillips that you deserved another chance.”
“The war’s been going on since we were kids, Buck. I don’t think you can promise that.”
“Fuck you good. Come on now, baby. Keep your cock quiet. Don’t come. Don’t you dare!” Steve says and he slams into Tony, over and over. Tony’s crying out, Steve’s right behind him. Tears of joy and pleasure blur his vision. “Don’t you come until I’m ready. Don’t you.”
“Killing and eating as a lion. Kind of freaked you out, huh?”
“You don’t, you don’t have to,” Steve whispers. His voice sounds edged, like he teeters on a precipice of want, desire, hope, and something else, something wanting and hungry.
It’s not Avenger business.
“Half of it is feedback,” Bruce said and he sat up straighter and brushed off his hands. “Yep, that’s you. Most of it is you. How noisy your own mind is will dictate how much feedback and noise you get. The rest is the whispers of your pack. Now I use a certain meditation technique, but I know that Nat and Steve and probably Peggy have been schooled on the accepted Mantra methodology.”
“You sure?” Natasha didn’t sound convinced, but at the same time he saw that she tiptoed around his feelings – the one thing he just didn’t want to deal with right now. If he made it out of this fiasco, he would deal with those later. Not now.
“Bed? Wait. What?”
“It’s more complicated than that, you know,” Frigga informs them. “What you have between the two of you is something akin to what Heimdall has for all the living beings of the universe except on a much smaller scale. You have to be able to know without a doubt that you can reach out to the other and firmly place yourself at his side. Is that possible?”
JARVIS comes on line in the SUV and the alerts sound as well as a warning that further threat will be met with deadly force. The truck side swipes the front bumper of the SUV and rumbles away, picking up speed and disappearing around the corner and into traffic.  Everything settles like waves easing to the shore and dying down to simple ripples.
“No, something not so pedestrian.”
“I don’t know how to-.”
With Steven in the harness attached to the lattice of the rack above them, Tony adjusts the tension and pushes Steven as he says, “Assume position three.”
Turning, Steve asks, “Who, Bucky?”
“Am adjusted. Move, please move.”
Instead of playing out the rest, instead of calling out to Peggy, he turned to his soul bond – this foreign thing that infected him, split his soul into so many others and linked him to this new world. Today, Tony changed it. He did something wondrous and terrifying. He manipulated the strings and chords of their souls together. Tony had done it purposefully, not accidentally like all of the times Steve had called out or changed things. Steve had always been a fast learner, had always hungered to learn. Even in the depths of poverty he sought knowledge. He’d learned as much as he could about the soul pack, about the bonds that brought them together – but that was like being book smart as his mother would say. He needed more practical experience. The thing inside of him, the bond tethering him to so many others, became not a drag or an anchor, but a beacon to him. He focused through the lanes of the energy. He could call out to Sam or Natasha or any one of them.
“More,” he pants. His voice rasps. Just as a tease, Steve rotates his beard and Tony sobs out his need. “Fuck, please!”
The media barely recognizes him probably because he’s dressed up and not in a hoodie and shorts. It helps to not be a public figure. Strange places a hand at the small of Steve’s back as he offers the invitation to the hostess standing at the door. The hostess scans the invitation and then smiles to them, gesturing them toward the foyer.
“Redwing – Steve,” Bucky says and he’s not sure the bird understands him – only Sam seems to have enough Force sensitivity to actually affect the bird’s communication. The bird with its flash of red on its flight feathers streaks forward and flies through the bars of each cell. There are screams and cries as the bird does but then Redwing zooms out again, still searching.
“I need, I need,” he says and then just sinks to the floor, curling over his knees and wrapping his arms around himself.
“Yeah, you’re telling me.”
When Tony doesn’t take the bowl, Steve puts it down on the bench and says, “Fine, do what you want.” He grumbles something under his breath about fury or being furious or some shit. Tony decides it’s best to ignore the Army grunt.
Stane scowls. “The same way that stupid suit of armor made a difference?”
“Paying the check,” Steve says. His eyes are too bright as if unshed tears glisten there. “I screwed this whole thing up. I get that, and I am sorry. This is not the way it should have gone or was supposed to go. But then again, things changed – for the better, much better – but the fact is that change.” He shrugs. “It changed everything. I’ll get out-.”
because he knows he’ll only get obtuse answer anyhow. “Well, he’s getting cleaned up and then I am going to make sure he rests.”
“Clean, I want him clean.” Tony cannot even think about touching the omega with his filthy hair and skin.
Handling hot lava might have been easier than broaching taboo subjects with Steve. “You feel better now about it? I was worried. That night was charged, you know. And I thought you might back track.”
After he finishes, he packs a small bag to have with him at the prince’s quarters and then sets off. It’s only a short walk but he’s surprised to see Rumlow’s Strike team on the ship. Rumlow eyes him and winks once. Steve feels exposed and he hurries past the team without a word. He shuts down listening to hear if they catcall him. It’s one of the elements of being a sex worker he truly hates. While some is expected and he does play into it when needed, unsolicited attention is not wanted – regardless of position.
Steve kisses him. “For luck. See you on the other side.”
“We’re South Pole, I think,” Tony said. “Fury’s looking for a friendly port. The US is in chaos. Even with Ross and Pierce gone there’s a strong contingency that’s poisoned in the US. You can’t just chop off the monster’s head and not thing there’s more to it than that.”
“You can still harvest them?” Ross asked.
“I’m just really sorry,” the waitress repeats.
“Okay. Maybe we can figure out what to watch?”
“No,” he says now to the Red Knight. “No. You know nothing. You’re trying to intimidate me. You’re here to devour my soul.”
As the stars of their pack cascaded down around them in bright blues and crystal white, Tony searched for an answer in Steve’s expression. “Misled?”
“They didn’t ID you as a mate? They said they had scanners – biometric – installed in the building.” The helicopter danced through the clouds and Steve was suddenly very happy he’d not had lunch.
"I'm not sure what you find so amusing," Steve returns and thinks he may need to leave, even though he truly wants to stay.
“Bruce seems to know a lot about it,” Steve remarked as he turned over a page in a notebook.
“Weird,” Tony inserted.  He looked like he might fall over, crumple and just disintegrate. Steve empathized. “Very, very weird.”
“Night Steve.”
“Tell me you don’t care for Bucky?” Steve says and he realizes his fatigue is getting the best of him, lending him the courage to confront her when he would normally shy away from forcing her hand.
Tony chuckles. “The serum worked when you were a lion, didn’t it?”
“Understood.”
Tony bowed his head and then nuzzled closer to Steve, being careful with how much personal space he took. In the end, Steve ushered them over to the bed and they spent the rest of the day curled around one another, talking only minimally but always touching. Steve admitted that the brush of a hand or a simple kiss startled and stunned his emotional response. Tony considered his needs and touched but always telegraphed it. It helped.
His parents fought a lot. Most of the time it had to do with Howard’s trips or what Tony’s mom called Howard’s obsession.
The little girl pipes in. “My dad said he didn’t want anything else. But that’s not true, he said you have a very fine ass. And he likes your blue eyes.”
Emergency might be a stretch, considering it took T’Challa and Steve over three months to force the issue and cause the Security Council to demand a resolution by the VH Affairs group. It surprised Tony that the United States hadn’t vetoed the action, though it still might try and block any recommendations. Everyone was on edge. The world balanced on the tip of a knife – any moment it would topple. No one thought this meeting would change that, at least not in their delegation. The most they hoped for was a détente or at least an avenue to begin some talks. The situation in the US had spread to other vampire fearing countries and Tony had his doubts that revealing the Divini at this moment was a good idea. Even within their group they split along ideological lines. Natasha headed up a group that advocated for a strong, forceful statement which included threats to the populace. Steve opposed that method and pushed for a more civil presentation. With only a handful of Divini in the world, Tony advanced the thought that they still needed to lay low, regardless of what powers they had. Mobs could easily overwhelm them.
“Hmm, thanks?” He never uses an autoclave at the Widow’s Brothel; he thinks he’ll stick with a good washing and boiling. It serves its purpose – the old fashioned way.  When he enters the washroom, he gapes. JARVIS isn’t fooling around – the place is chuck full of sinks and washers and different fabricators. Lining the walls are soaps and conditioners, greasers, and other items Steve cannot even fathom.
Tony cringed but turned around to greet Steve with a smile plastered on his face. “Hey yourself.”
“What is it?” Bruce asks and Pepper walks out of the parlor.
“There is no need for apologies, my friend. I think we understand one another.”
“But he gave up his family for you!” Tony snapped and yanked his arm out of her grasp.
“Stark.” Natasha shakes her head and gazes at him. “Steve’s not connected. Not anymore. That means-.”
“I’m sorry. Were you resting?” It seems a little early for sleep.
They eat, but don’t speak again.
“Any broken skin?”
“There isn’t much time. Grab the hilt, both of you and hold on.”
“Yeah like I stroke out or something.”
He doesn’t know why he says it, why he requests it. “Kiss me.”
The idea to send Steve back into the Soul Keep is passed around but decided that it is too dangerous. Due to his enlightenment his once blue eyes transformed to red as soon as he accepted the truth. If the Red Skull glimpses him for even a moment, he will be damned to the Chambers Below to be fed on by the Skull for all eternity. That choice condemns them all to this Realm and no passage beyond toward what comes next.
Tony points to the machine but doesn’t tell him. Clint doesn’t seem moved by the fact they have a new painting dressing the walls. He only seems interested in his lack of matching pajamas and the surgical tape on his fingers.
Tony should have said something, should have stopped him, but instead he dropped into one of the kitchen chairs and stared into the darkness outside where Steve had escaped to their barn loft. What the hell was Tony doing? Sabotaging the one good thing that happened to him in the last six months, that was what. He teased at it, had to taunt Steve. Why? Thor’s words came back to Tony, reminding him of his own frailty. He glanced toward the fire pit where the rest of the team huddled together. They would leave this sanctuary and emerge more than a team. They had evolved into a pack here. He felt their presence and it didn’t invade anymore but surrounded and comforted. The idea of it ever being taken from him terrified him. The thought of losing Steve – his love if that’s what it genuinely was – broke him. He couldn’t let it happen.
Tony studies him, and that dark glance pools all his longings and wants down deep in Steve so that he wants to throw away his duties, his responsibilities and stay here. Steve steadies his need, and peers over to the mountains as Tony says, “Maybe you’ll need my assistance.”
It feels right to Tony. “Lassie wasn’t a seeing eye dog, but she was as pretty as you.”
Tony jolts and Steve feels his muscles quiver under his grip. He yanks his arm away, readying for the fight. “It shouldn’t be this way. If I’m going to make things right than they will accept you – whatever your profession.”
“Stay with me?” Tony asked, and he bowed his head against Steve’s chest. While Steve wanted to beg off, so he could investigate the possibilities of the vision, he nodded in reply.
“Hey, you hungry? They brought some grub, it isn’t five star, but it won’t kill you.”
Had Natasha laid a trap for Clint – they’d called her the Black Widow vampire for a reason. Some part of Steve hated her in that moment as they drove through the night into the next day.
“Then why is Agent Rumlow bleeding?” Obie asks.
“Tony wants me to fake date him,” Steve says. “And he wants to make it worth my time.”
Getting the wings had been child’s play for Natasha, and Steve thought she even enjoyed it a little too much. He felt her celebration through the bond and only suppressed a chuckle as they headed off to find Sitwell. Sam took it all in stride and seemed confident and growing through the bond. During the car rides, Steve and Natasha continued to brief Sam on the Soul Mantra and how to work through the bond, how to control it, how to concentrate, and how to distance it. They also worked on seeking and catching as they liked to call it, where they used the bond to figure out positions and status through a mission. It was harder to do and test in the confines of a car, but they tried their best as they made the final plans to secure Sitwell. Steve knew these were stopgap measures and that he’d have to refer Sam to Wong’s tutelage as soon as possible, but Sam’s mind was lightning quick. He followed the instructions, asked all the right questions, and genuinely settled into being a part of the bond so easily it felt natural. Like he was supposed to be there all the time.
Through a mouthful of popcorn, Steve remarks, “Yeah. I couldn’t believe you slept through it yesterday.”
“Do you think that’s wise? You gave up your hand -.”
"Babe, you got another client today? Thought you had the rest of the day off?"
Steve picks up his hand and smiles as if he’s a lion again, trying to communicate. He remembers himself and adds, “Yes. I’d love to. I mean. Go with you. My?”
“No, of course you’re not,” Tony says and peers around the corner. “No sign of pursuit. Not yet. He’s regrouping.” Most of the time Tony’s attention is only half in the real world – or in the world plainly in front of him. When Tony turns to Steve, his eyes are stark and true. “He has connected to our brains. Not our thoughts or our higher functions, but our reptilian functions. If he wants us dead, then he might just be able to click his fingers and kill us.”
Thankfully, Steve sleeps most of the way back to the States, only waking for bio breaks and to scarf down as much food as he can. This seems to please Tony and eases the lines in Natasha’s features. Part of Steve’s happy to see Tony gratified with his progress but he recognizes this must be part of his nature. He wonders if this means the gland is starting to function. His cheeks warm again. He doesn’t want another heat. Ever again. He might need to ask about suppressants.
“Okay, I’ll think about it,” Tony answered. “When?”
“A little less than a month,” Tony says and then touches the frame of his glasses. He’s worn them too long over the last few days. The headaches pound a beat in his whole skull. “And I won’t be sighted during the time I’ll be here. Ensure that we have minimal staff and the staff we have are under the Non-disclosure agreement with background checks.”
Wrestling a clear understanding of soul packs and soul bonds still eluded Tony. He might be able to see the bonds amongst the team as networked and interlinked equations to solve, but the fact still remained that how to use that to their advantage hung like an anvil over their heads. His newfound relationship with Steve might offer an exciting new equation to explore, but the soul pack and how it would change the Avengers needed to be defined. It had been a good two years since the ring around Steve’s wrist had appeared. What had they done in that time to utilize it? Nothing. A few instances here and there had demonstrated that they had within their midst something tangible and powerful. Forging stronger bonds between all of them would utilize the power of the pack. Getting out of the city and to a place where they could investigate what it meant to be a soul pack, bonded team members would change everything.
“I take it, it’s good?”
Tony furrows his brow. “But you haven’t done that here.”
Tony wants to growl at her. She knows full well that Steven might not be ready for the task. “Let’s give him some time to adjust-.”
“I’m not going to dignify that with a response,” Tony replies but there’s a grin twisting the edge of his mouth. Instead, he turns to Frigga and asks, “You’re sure about this.”
Instead of waiting to find anything more out, Steve reached out within the bond – the bond he was supposed to have with Clint and found a tattered thread. The tendrils reached out as if in fog to an unseen shore. Through the bond he felt the vibrations of anger and pain and something more insidious – something Steve knew too well – isolation. He focused his attention on Cho. “I need to see him. Now. He needs my help.”
A whine catches his attention – a mechanical whine and then the platform shakes with energy and lights flash. The air around them shifts and smells of o-zone like a lightning strike. A figure appears on the platform and wavers a bit. Tony dashes for the steps but before he can get there, the helmet comes down.
Steve settles back, content. “And no, for some reason, I didn’t really worry about the project. I saw it as the possibility of curing me more than anything else. I walked around with a heart issue, a lung issue. All kinds of allergies. There was diabetes in my family so I was worried that would become a reality. Every winter could have been my last.”
“Well, it’s Vision,” Steve confirms and rubs at his face hoping the heat of his embarrassment fades quickly and cannot be seen in the low lighting of the corridor. “Tell us.”
“Fine. We need to bring him in. You’re welcome to come along, but we will interrogate him, and he will be held until we’re finished.” He points to Natasha. “She’s not allowed.”
“Posh, who cares!”
“Yeah, I think so.” As Steve gathered up the pillows and blankets, Tony closed the door and found a bolt to lock it. Steve placed the linens on the floor, retrieved the cushions from the couch, and then pulled out the bed. It sagged in the middle and promised a helluva back ache tomorrow, but it looked glorious to Steve. “I’ll make up the bed for us.” He wanted to do something because his heart took loops in his chest that caused his hands to quake and his breath to catch.
“Sam,” Steve said as he offered a hand. Sam grasped it. “You’re in Wakanda, a nation that is sympathetic to the vampire cause. I – We were able to heal you of your wounds.”
“You know, I missed you.”
“I’m sorry, Nat, I can’t,” he says but he doesn’t drop her hand. “I don’t want to be the cause of anymore strife in the team, in our family. What’s been done, what happened, I should have foreseen, I should have known-.”
Steve chewed on his cheek and then said, “It’s who we are. Mates. Isn’t it? It isn’t about the power but about who we are.” Steve jumped to his feet, not sure if he was breaking some royal protocol, not sure that he cared. “There are mates all over America. So many of them. So many families with vampires as their sisters, brothers, and so on. They surely don’t want this war against their loved ones. They surely don’t want to break apart a nation with such promise.”
“She just tell you to get somewhere safe, too?” Tony asked. He was still ticked off by that. The bond between the pack beat like a living thing. Inwardly he spoke the Mantra as he listened. Calming his brain so he could think straight happened to be a top priority.
“Yeah, maybe,” Steve murmured as Tony led the way into the suite. They went toward the sitting room. Steve liked the comfort of the room, but at the same time he missed feeling at home. Yet he knew he hadn’t felt like that in ages. “So, do we want to work on the Mantra first?”
“Not bad timing. The Council begins deliberations in a week. We should have more than enough time to get our coalition together. Natalie and her Fleet will be there. Asgard will be there as well. This is good.”
Deflating some, Steve acknowledges Tony’s direction. “Right, we should wake you up first. Any questions?”
Grabbing Steve, Tony dashes for the door but Rumlow sees their furious run to the door and the rifle levels out to target them. Steve stumbles and, for a second, Tony thinks he's been hit. With no choice, Tony yells at him to move it while Nat zigzags through the broken aisles of equipment toward Rumlow. He hasn't a clue what she's up to and doesn't have time to worry about it. As he manhandles Steve to the door, the bullets pellet around them like possessed hail from the sky.
“Okay?” Tony said. “So part of the dissonance we’re getting from the link is due to all of this.”
The man looked like a god, so good. Tony fucked his hand, hitting it hard as the water poured down. He rasped and panted in the shower as his balls tightened and he thought of Steve there, using his own hand, or better yet, crouched before him, ass in the air taking him all in, getting fucked and loving it. Begging Tony for more. Begging him to be hard, wanting him to use him. Wanting Tony to bond. Steve would beg him for that bond and then Tony came so hard, so fast that he screamed out a howl that sounded like a death cry.
“Barton is out of the picture for a while. He needs to debrief and to reset his life and mind.” Fury slashed his hand to keep Steve from asking anything more about Clint. “He needs time to reset. Don’t worry about him.”
The suggestion elicits a reaction deep in his gut and he moans. His throat tightens and his salivary glands contract. He lifts up onto his outstretch arm in time to spew what little he has in his stomach. The comforting hand strokes up and down his back and he vomits again though it is really only a dry heave. His body trembles and he almost falls into the mess but a strong arm yanks him away from it.
Steve presses his lips together and catches a glimpse of Bucky, riddled with pain and thrown back into the depths of nightmares. Steve knows, he’s been there himself – too many times. “I don’t think that’s wise.”
“Schmidt know you’d be bringing me along?”
She smiled, nodded, and then left the room. Fury weighed his gaze at each of them before settling on Steve.
“He loves you more than anything in the world, Tony,” Barnes says. He never uses Tony’s first name, just like he never uses Barnes’.
Before he can assimilate exactly what JARVIS said, more movement draws his attention and he sees a shoulder, and a shock of blonde hair crusted with rusty blood. When the face turns, briefly to the light, Tony gasps.
“Sorry to break up the re-union of you gals, but we got some issues here.”
He admits he likes the boy's affable smile. "Yeah? How're you figuring that?"
It’s Luke who comes up to them and says, “Maybe you might like something a little less provocative.”
His eyes are distant. “Fuck or blow?”
“Hmm,” Steve murmurs and continues the ballet with his fingers across Tony’s scalp.
“I didn’t realize your family worked in weapons,” Steven says.
It takes all of his willpower to tear away and focus on their Souls playing and nuzzling. But it’s Bucky who brings him back to face him again with a finger to his chin. “Paired.”
Steve crossed his hands over his chest and placed his hands over Tony’s. The silky softness of his skin, the realness of him anchored Steve. He’d spent so many hours loose and lost in the winds of change as if his body failed to find a safe port in the storm that silently raged within it. He swallowed down those fears and said, “Always?”
Bucky skids to a halt as Redwing flies in through a hole in the crumbling wall. The bird flutters around his head as if to get its bearings and then takes off down a darkened hallway. Bucky follows. It’s ludicrous to trust the bird, but right now Bucky’s out of ideas and he needs some way to navigate through the twists, turns, and dead ends.  The bird leads him to winding staircase carved into the stones and the skips down them, not caring if he’s quiet or not. The place is lit up and the sirens wail; there’s no stopping the oncoming attackers. He knows that so he focuses on getting as far as he can as fast as he can.
Indicating the dildos of different lengths and widths Natasha asks, “Which is the largest you can take?”
“And yet you’re alive and he’s dead as are his wife and children,” Tony says.
“Name, rank, serial number?”
“Oh fuck, Rogers, you are one sweet piece of meat.”
“I can’t fucking believe you!” Tony yells as he watches Steve dismount the bike. He reminds Tony of those old westerns his dad used to watch. He’s a cowboy getting off his horse. He’s all legs and wide shoulders and Tony licks his lips. He’s happy the mask of his helmet conceals his hungry expression.
"Yes, I do. Do you want to see what else I can do," Tony says and his hands creep upward along Steve's legs.
Before he has a chance to say anything, Tony speaks, “Do you want to explain anything, Steve?”
“You are a masterpiece,” Tony says.
“Do you want me to ride you back to camp?”
“No.” He looks up into the coming dusk of night. “There was a coldness to it. Like the deepness of space in your bones. The darkness wrapped around the Red Skull and whisked him away as he howled. I got to the pilot seat and forced the plane down. But it was too late the tendrils of the tesseract had me. Even though it had fallen into the ocean, I felt the chill, the coldness seep into me. It was not like a cube at all, but it had facets upon facets that captured me. Folded me in.” He sighs. “I don’t know how to explain it.”
But the prison fades into memories to scorch his dreams and hold him prison in the dew of the night. He tries not to visit there, but the fact remains that he is trapped, an angel on the mortal realm. He’s not sure if it’s ever happened before, and as he wakes again, he comes to a more conscious state than he’s experienced in his previous wakings.
“What?”
Narrowing his eyes, Steven asks, “And those differences make me less?”
“What are you hiding Rhodey? What’s going on?”
“So all this spunk you were spreading around got you into trouble?” Tony asked with a cocked eyebrow as he sipped the wine.
He glances at his own Companion. Sweet and lovely, but his soul animal is small, thin, but ferocious. She's wiry and, as his mother has said, all spit and vinegar. What she doesn't have in size and health she has in attitude. She's a brindled blue and gray and black. The gray mimics the silver in the boy's Soul Companion.
“Unless we go to a very specific shop, they don’t really like waiting on the likes of me.” Steve jumps as Tony reaches down and plays with his balls. He falls easily forward, placing his head on the prince’s shoulder, shifting his stance to allow Tony access.
He curses and puts the car in gear. On the way home, he tells himself he’s a fool. He needs to figure out what’s up and soon. Obi called him and told him the Board of Directors are looking for a big splash – they want the Jericho field tested in Afghanistan. Tony’s not getting out of that one. He’s going to have to go overseas and leave Steve alone.
He cleared his throat and tried to put on his best Captain America voice. “Yeah? Where’d she go?” His hands were buried deep in his pockets.
“Hard, fuck. I want to you to hold me down and fuck me hard. I want to feel it in my chest, in my blood. I want to feel it like you’re consuming me.”
Cursing under his breath, Steve dodges the next series of shots and swivels to the side, getting a wall to the next path between him and his nemesis. He grits his teeth and takes off down the open air tunnel, trying to gage the direction. Ultron’s been smart though, there’s no angle to any light. It’s just above and that’s it. He can’t tell north or south. He can’t stop to figure out whether or not he’s headed toward the exit and to Tony or not.  A bolt of repulsor fire hits the wall next to him and he scrambles out of the way as a cascade of stone and mortar rains down.
“Oh Jesus,” Tony whispered. He’d read the stories of Captain America’s life. He usually skimmed over the early parts of the stories as a child, too impatient to get to the good stuff. The story of Steve Rogers before Project Rebirth seemed inconsequential to an eight-year-old boy bent on reading about his hero. He recalled from those small bits of information he retained that Steve’s mother died of tuberculosis when he was a young man before the war. He was left nearly destitute because of his own health problems, the Great Depression, and his inability to work manual labor. If it hadn’t been for Bucky, Steve may have died long before that the faithful day of Project Rebirth.
When Tony comes to, his head aches and his mouth takes like grit and sand and blood. He coughs and tries to roll over, thinking maybe he should stop the late night binge drinking. That’s when he realizes he’s not in his own bed, but still in the Iron Man armor after what should have been a fatal crash. The armor stalls all attempts to move; it’s mangled and useless. He calls out to JARVIS but the AI is still off line. He needs the manual release. Bringing his right arm to his left shoulder tells him that he’s probably damaged his wrist, arm or both. He groans and lies back down.
Pepper puffs out some air and then she kisses him on the cheek. “Be gentle on him.”
“I’m afraid this won’t do, Miss Melanie. Anthony, you see, is above average. Far above average. He reads on a high school level.”
“Don’t worry, I knew what not to leak,” she said and then Natasha took off before Tony could ask what she meant. Clint seemed satisfied but not willing to share.
He had his eyes slightly lidded and his head thrown back. “It’s okay. Keeping doing it. I like it. It’s good, so good.”
Steve jerks, realizes what he was doing and, ashamed, pulls his hand away from Tony.
“Yeah don’t worry. Turning into a mindless zombie isn’t on my to do list.” He gave her a quick peck on the cheek. Her warmth and loveliness a fragrant bloom against his cooler cheek. She looked at him in the eye which she rarely did anymore. His preternatural eyes disarmed people. He knew that. It was part of the glamour myth of vampires.
“For years as a lion, I would dream of a crow who would accompany me on my journey. There were a few months when I would chase any I saw. They ended up trying to pluck at my eyes when I slept.” Steve smiles. “It was you all along.”
“No there’s not.”
They spend the rest of the evening studying. Well, Steve studies, Tony does - other things.
“Hold still.”
“Permission to speak frankly, sir.” Steve knew he should just keep his mouth shut, but he needed to say something. He had to. The star on his chest, the colors of his shield, meant something to him still, even if it meant little to anyone else anymore.
“Then it’s done!” Tony declares and waves at the door. JARVIS answers and the mechanism releases. Tony enters with Steve towed behind him. “JARVIS cancel any meetings I have today.”
He rethinks his assessment as soon as they hit the trail. They have to lose the pack horse, there’s no way for the pony to get through the rugged terrain. He slips down off his horse and walks to the pack horse. Tony watches him, not asking. He may have come to the same conclusion. On a fair day, Steve would have led the pack horse down to the water, but with the jagged rocks, and a wet slick path, the horse will only be a hindrance.
“Right,” Tony says. There’s a particular part of the family tree he’s focused on. Tony examines it. “That’s an interesting branch you’re looking at.”
Steve doesn’t look like he understands him and he cannot speak because the bar is still across his mouth. He heaves in a wet breath and then the tears from his eyes flood down his cheeks. Both Clint and Sam move away as Steve reaches out to Bucky. Settling next to Steve, Bucky gathers him in his arms.
“Three days?” Still his brain fumbled along as if he ran ahead of it. He knew she was right, his mind still wobbled. He couldn’t gather the strength to comprehend how he felt – what storm he knew swirled within him like the eye of a hurricane slowly inching toward landfall.
“On to the lessons?” Natasha said.
“Sir, a seizure may lead to Captain Rogers entering another comatose state,” JARVIS states.
“What the fuck? Vision brought -.”
"Wh-what?" Steve says and he's barely able to stand up, to get to his feet and confront Tony.
She stretches to pick up a tablet. She flicks it open and holographs appear between them. “Steve Rogers. Trained in classical art. Best friends to one of the best known soldiers of the war, Bucky Barnes aka White Wolf. Mother died not too long ago. Looks like you have several ailments that needs to be attended to, but you can’t afford the augmentation. That’s what did your mother in as well.” She pushes the holographs that laid out Steve’s life like a twisted reality-vid.
“When’s this fake date?”
Pepper nods and then says, “I understand. So, Steve then?”
Well, that didn’t tell Tony anything new, except his mother had the wrong Sea and he had a picture. Proof of a lion in Norway. Maybe it fell off a cargo ship bound for America? Zoos routinely captured wild lions and brought them to the Western hemisphere, but it was far off track if that were the case. Maybe the ship headed toward Norway and it just wasn’t off track at all. Tony had a lot of researching to do. He spent the better part of the day rummaging through the card catalogue, picking out books, looking through old microfiche to locate any references to the blue-eyed lion. He found a dozen. He checked out what he could and asked the librarian to send to another library to get the article. By the time the afternoon burned away, Tony sat at home with a glass of milk and some cookies, along with his lion and a stack of books.
“Fuck you. Now, just stop the dramatics and get the damned thing off his eyes and his mouth.”
Tony pours the coffee and hands a cup to Steve. “Nope. The Door was in the maze rim. I figured that would happen. Ultron’s scrapping the rims as soon as we solve them or move through them, if you want to call it that. It disappeared as soon as I approached the maze. He’s pissed. The backpack was with me when I left so it appeared when I re-appeared.”
JARVIS queried him, “Sir, are you unsure of the course? I could plot-.”
“Good.” Tony kisses Steve’s beard. “I like the beard by the way.”
Tony rolls his eyes. “What other Captain America do you know?”
Those eyes so deep in their emotion, dark and earthy, or light and crystalline blue, met Steve’s and every ounce of fear and doubt shamed Steve. The love was there for him to see. “Well, you might not have been, but I was.” He cupped his hand on Tony’s chilled face. The flesh felt like soapstone, a touch of porcelain with the softness of silk. He sat back onto to the bed, pulling Tony with him. “Now, drink. Drink your fill. Drink it all.”
He calms his reaction as the pain turns to a more persistent kind of agony. “’m good.”
“You look like you nee-.”
A voice distant but close says to him. “Hey, quiet. I found someone to help you. I think she might be a voodoo doctor or something, I’m not sure. But considering the situation I don’t know what else to do.”
“JARVIS?”
The guard raised his hands “No offense, Mister Stark. The boys and I just don’t get out much. Only got 18704 to entertain us. Lately it’s only been responsive to me or Brock. Though I’m not in charge of the punishment. Rumlow decides that.”
“So.” Bruce opened his hands. Steve noticed he didn’t have tea.
Tony convinces the paramedics to transport Steve to the Tower. It didn’t take much but now Tony wonders if it was worth it. Not one doctor, not Bruce, not anyone can tell what the hell is wrong with Captain America. He literally had a seizure, dropped over like a drunk in the middle of the diner, and went into a fit that terrified Tony and probably half the rest of the world. Every major news outlet and some of the shadier ones are carrying smartphone footage of the event. Every pundit and crackpot doctor is hacking away at the reasons for Captain America’s sudden sickness. Some attribute it to the ice, saying Captain America is rapidly aging and will die soon – they’ve even managed to show men of advanced age who kind of look like Steve. They don’t outright say that it’s Steve but they elude to it. Others attribute it to some kind of new alien invasion that targeted Steve in particular, trying to take away the leader of the Avengers, before the full out new incursion occurs. There’s even another theory that the germs that resided in the ice with Steve infected his brain and like the known brain eating amoeba are slowly devouring his neural networks.
If Bruce stuck around, then the obvious choice for this venture would have been the good doctor. Two massive brains are better than one. What good does he have to offer Tony in the middle of journey through an artificial brain.
Steve dumped the load of wood next to the fireplace. “It’s freezing in here and I don’t see Strange anywhere to get us out.” The fury boiled through the bond. Steve couldn’t blame Tony for his anger. Getting dumped in the middle of nowhere had not been part of Steve’s hopes for the team lessons.
They lie down on the grass, ignoring the wet dew. They end up there for hours, until they eventually turn around to watch the sun rise over the cabin below. The cool air doesn’t bother Steve at all, not with Tony so close. During the whole time, Tony keeps his hand on Steve’s. It feels right and comfortable. Steve hasn’t a clue what’s going to happen next, but he’s flying so high he can’t see the ground to land.
“No devilry,” Bruce said and held up a hand in surrender. “I didn’t think it would work with you.”
Steve only curses Fury for his horrible sense of humor.
“I understood that reference,” Steve said. “And it might help if you stopped talking to me.”
“No need for prep,” Tony says and reaches back, spreading himself for Steve. He knows Steve too well, he already did it himself.
“Be careful,” the leader said. He pointed to the other vampire. “Stake that one. We don’t need her anymore.”
“You double booked me? During a contract with the prince? With Prince Anthony Stark. He’s the most powerful prince of the Conclave. Forget that the Stations are independent and aren’t under the influence of the Systems’ governance, Natasha you are playing with fire!” Steve seethes as his whole body trembles with anger.
Tony’s spaced out as if his mind’s a mass of beautiful circuitry without connection. Steve lightly brushes his hands through Tony’s hair who opens his eyes in a dazed stare. “Would you like to fuck me now?” His voice is throaty, rasping with want. The prince is so lavishly gorgeous like God made him irresistible in this state.
“Okay, sure.”
He glances down from the road for a moment – he can the traffic is at a standstill (again). In a shaky scrawl, the words are scribble on the paper:
“We only have to survive, we will get out of here,” Steve says. “Just back my play.”
Chances mean another time to try.
“When?” she asked. She stood in the middle of one of the few upper floors that were not decimated by the battle. They’d been using it as their living quarters.
The waitress arrives with their food and quietly places the dishes in front of them. She hovers close and Steve thanks her and dismisses her. “I think she wanted to do my job for me. Your cheeseburger is in the center of the plate. The fries are in a plastic basket with paper at 2 o’clock. The milkshake is at 11.”
“And sex worker was on the top of your list?”
“I have to get my armor. I can’t work on getting out of here without it.” For a crazy minute, Tony thinks Blu is deliberately trying to keep him here – in the middle of nowhere. “I’m not staying. This isn’t some fairy tale and you’re not the secret prince.” Tony marches toward the hill. Blu confronts him; he dwarfs Tony. “Get out of the way!”
“Steve, it’s okay to want something for yourself. You don’t have to drop the shield because of your own needs.”
“Great. We can have a picnic.”
“Hello sleepyhead.” Steve stands at the door to Tony’s room. He has a large mug in his hand with steam wafting around the rim.  “I thought you were going for a nap yesterday, not to bed for the night.”
When Steve peers over his shoulder, he spots Tony staring and turning bright red and considers his mission a resounding success. “Come, I’ll show you to The Cage.” He throws a beckoning lilt to his voice and it works like a charm. He thinks he’s getting the hang of this flirting thing.
“Be happy, Steve.” Her presence dissipated, and Steve trembled with the chill left in the air. He glanced around as if he might catch a glimpse of her, some evidence that in fact she had visited him from beyond the grave. Only the opulent room surrounded him.
Tony opens his eyes for only a second before he slams them shut again. His heart stampedes in his chest and he gasps for air. This isn’t the way virtual reality should hit him, but then again this isn’t a virtual reality game – this is a real life and death scenario that he somehow trapped himself in. Not somehow, he did this deliberately.
Sam brought light to his darkest days. It had been Sam who had led Steve out of the shadow of the prison camp. Mentally, Steve had been in a particularly bad place, they called it spells. He'd fall into long stupors of memories, like terrors that plagued him and the sorrow of the nights and days spent at the prison camp during the war overwhelmed him. Sometimes, even the days before the prison camp plagued him. How his small troop of soldiers, the Howling Commandoes, assisted the 16th regiment in their attack on Antietam – the most horrific day of his life. He could still smell the blood and septic stench of wounds. Those days came back to him as did the months in the prison.  The doctors had wanted to diagnose him with acute mania or irregularities of his mental processes. They’d wanted to commit him to a hospital for the insane in New York City, but the military brass held back. How could they put him away when he’d been a decorated, celebrated war hero?
Before Steve can find his voice, the prince leaves the room. He stares after Tony and blinks as if the experience, the reality will wash away with a simple gesture. Nothing disappears and Steve mentally shakes himself back into his reality instead of that fantasy lurking in the back of his brain. It’s strange to sit in the prince’s private quarters without him. Steve quickly eats and drinks his coffee. After, he collects his clothes – he’s still not sure how his pants ended up under the sink in the bathroom. He stuffs the plug back into his robe and then takes one more look around the room to ensure he found everything. With that, he heads back to his quarters.
It is only then that Steve realizes Tony is a cat person, and that he’s going to give this little cat one of those collars that make her talk and then his life is going to be consumed by animals talking about food, love, squirrels, mice, and possibly disdain (since they now have a cat).
Down.
“Why what?”
“Yes. But what do you think about him?”
“She was special.”
“She won’t come back, Tony, she’s right to leave. You should leave.”
“Don’t blame that madman on me,” Steve says and shuts his mouth, because most Union sympathizers saw Sherman as a hero, an icon of God’s will.
“It means that Captain Rogers can’t make it back to his body from the place his soul resides. Not yet.”
Steve knelt by the silent armor and dropped his shield to the side. He grabbed at the faceplate and said, “JARVIS update on Iron Man.”
“Then we should probably pack up and not stay here the night.”
Tony considered Steve as if he was weighing whether or not Steve might belt him one if he got close enough to study the brand. But Steve didn’t move.  He just stood there with his arm stretched out and the horrible reality of a wrist band revealed on his flesh – his skin that shouldn’t tarnish anymore because of the serum. Tony eyed him once more, and then stepped up and looked at the brand. Nothing really happened. They just stood there.
Glancing back over his shoulder, Steve can no longer make out the silhouettes of the town along the lonely plains of the eastern side of the foothills. The sagebrush and leafless trees stand in his way. He clears his throat and replies, “You are important as well, Tony. But I don't want Schmidt to get the upper hand. Even something as small as a wayward look could be misinterpreted.”
“Everything,” Tony whispers. “I’m going to lose you.”
He doesn’t.
Tony drops his hand and then climbs to his feet. He looks at the weird swirls of color around him and then turns back to the cottage and the refuge of the garden. “It’s probably time for you to hear this. Once I tell you, we can’t go back though. Once you find out this truth, it will all be laid bare for you to know and see. Do you want to know?”
This is all the basics and Tony scrolls through the different figures of anatomy. Of course, he gets caught up in the theories on the different sexes.
That’s when one of the lens of the glasses goes from transparent to opaque and then a scene plays before him. Steven sits in the dirt with his back to the monitoring system. His clothes are folded on a bench near the pole. Blood drips down his back. Jamison and Harry are standing to the side. There are no other guards in the area. Stumbling but clutching the pole he’s just been chained to, Steven manages to get to his feet. He takes a moment, and Tony sees that he’s saying something.
Every. Single. One.
Tony barreled ahead not waiting for Vision to explain the concept. “Cho’s designing the chip that will be placed at the base of my skull. I’m designing the entrance and exit strategies. All I have to do is go and commit sonicide or whatever killing your AI child would be called. And bam, it’s all done.”
Steve stammers over his reply. The mentions of Thor and Loki throws him off his game. Suddenly he wonders if the king knows Steve’s true identity. Is he engaged in a conversation with Steve in order to discover an avenue back into the good graces of his wayward sons?
“All run by sighted people,” Steve adds. “Might want to reconsider that.”
It takes a moment for Steve to catch up, much of his language is still rooted in his last assignment, so it takes a moment before he figures out what Tony must be talking about – “If you want?”
Bruce furrowed his brow and took off his glasses. “So you were in the middle of bonding and it was interrupted?”
Putting his glass down and tilting his head, he said, “Would you like to show me a little bit more about that attitude?”
“Sarah. And how did you know it wasn’t mine?” Steve says as he takes the hanky away from Tony.
The heat flushes to his face and Bruce smiles, almost sweetly to have elicited the response.
“Yeah, next time.” He embraces Tony and they lie there spent and tired.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Steve retorted and Natasha chortled.
Steve agrees to take the wheelchair. If he’s honest with himself, his legs wobble and weaken as he stands. It’s going to take a lot more than a few extra days in bed to heal. Both Natasha and Tony study him as he settles into the chair. Their looks mirror one another – worry, concern, and something else – outright fear. They’re gambling that this is going to work and they’re pinning all their hopes on Steve following and towing the line. He nods in silent concurrence to their plan. They leave the hospital without incident.
“But you didn’t act on it?” Bruce asked, his face a concerned line.
Someone was dead.
“He?” Tony spared a glance at Bruce and then back to the road. The stars in the sky and his supernatural senses made it so that the landscape around them had an ethereal glow in purples and lavender and pinks. When he looked at Bruce though a decidedly green tinge warped his skin.
The thought of being around all those scurrying ants in the R & D division frustrates him and he can only huff in response. "I can work here as easily as I can work across the country. Don't be a twat."
Peering up as he releases Tony, Steve sees the glistening of sweat, the red blush over Tony’s chest and face. His hair is wild and for one moment Tony transcends all rational thought in Steve’s brain. He looks magnificent. Steve smiles and feels heavy, needy.
If the lack of basic necessities didn’t mean death for a prisoner, the Raiders and Regulators might be the next to sentence a man to death. He’d interfered with the gangs, tried to stop the carnage and all he received in return had been a report to their captors. A peacemaker was not welcome at the prison camp.
“I never really understood that old Hydra adage, but now I do. I get it. You have to cleanse out all the poison not just the figureheads. I’m not sure what’s going on in the US, but it isn’t safe for us. Not for vampires, mates, Divini. No one can stay there.”
Finally, Tony’s able to pour a drink, a tall one. He gulps down the bourbon and it burns but he pours a second glass. He needs to figure out what the fuck he wants. That’s the worst part about this. He bonded with Steven. For right or not their biology worked. They are paired. It doesn’t matter how it happened, it did. There’s a growing awareness though. The longer he’s with Steven, he feels as if he’s slowly awakening from a long and horrible slumber.  The reality of life, of society around him, dawns on him and the light blinds him until his eyes tear. He hisses as he finishes his second drink. He should just go to bed, forget his halfhearted attempt to find a way through the wall he erected between them. But he needs to see Steven, he needs to face him and tell him.
He’s driven by a hunger so deep and welling in his gut that he can barely stand from the ache. He’s driven by the urgency of helplessness that he once felt in a dark cave, far from the shores of the Pacific. He’s driven by a whisper of hope, so quiet and lost within him that he’s not even sure if he hears it. Maybe the stress of his isolation, self-imposed in every aspect, has eaten his brain. He doesn’t know.
“For Christ’s sake, Steve. You’re god damned Captain America. How the fuck-.”
Vision joins Tony and they get Steve to his feet. He’s unsteady and grips the side of the lab bench as they remove the biohazard suit. It takes some time and his body aches as the fatigue comes over him. He’s not used to asthma attacks, not anymore. The chemical induced ones that he gets since the mission that went to hell haven’t happened as often. It’s one of the reasons he doesn’t get the daily inhaler. He figured he doesn’t need it.
“You can damn well let your friends help you out. Come to the Rails, Coulson and Fury are going to deal with this shitty ass conference. You don’t need to be here. You’re not a politician.”
“No, Tony.” Steve shakes his head. “You won’t do this, Ross, because you know that Tony’s more of an asset to your plans than I am. You know you need his tech and his brains.”
“Ma always did what she had to do to get us through the rough times. I figure I can do the same, you know?”
“Steve? Steve?”
He nods. “Carol found me. She brought me back to Earth. I didn’t want to go, but I was too old and weak. I hated going back-.” His voice breaks as he recalls the beauty of the Earth at the same time knowing his loss too great to sustain that wonder.
“The core is there. The good man is there. I know he is,” Steve replied. “Reaching him, making him understand…”
Tony presses a hand to his chest, swallowing several times while his face drains of color. He manages to say, “Too much excitement for one day.”
“Christ, Stark, let us help,” Natasha said, holding onto his hand.
There was so much Steve wished he would never remember. He nodded to Tony. The weakness had settled into his bones and became a part of him. For Tony’s sake, Steve wanted to jump out of bed, wrap Tony in his arms, and show the same strength, commitment, and fortitude that he’d done for so many years as Captain America. The thing inside of him prevented him, though, some deeply hidden weakness that drilled down to the marrow of his bones. He watched as Tony sat down next to him in the bed, gathered Steve in his arms and held him against his chest. Tony spoke in low tones.
“Seems they have a story about a bomb and their parents and Stark Industries.” Natasha had placed a hand on Bucky’s shoulder as she shifted out of his touch.
“But you won’t,” Steve said, and a little smile dimpled his cheeks. “I know what you mean.”
Tony read his mind. “I think I cut us off in the soul bonds. It feels like it anyway, but I -. I have to admit that I don’t think this is all from you. I just- I want this to work out. I’m serious about this. This isn’t just one of my passing fancies, you know.”
Tony nods and then falls over in the bed, instantly asleep.
“You thought wrong,” Tony said and shoved past her. He didn’t want to face his own demons, and he wasn’t going to face ones she challenged him with right now. “Where is he?”
Tony wanted to agree, but still he recalled how he floundered. How the arc reactor nearly killed him, how he ruined his relationship with Pepper. Right now, all he had was the soul pack. “I can’t do this to him.”
Bruce jerks a bit and Steve swears he sees the shadow of anger so strong it scorches. The good doctor fights it back and says, “I’m aware of Tony’s proclivities.”
“Friday?”
No. Tony doesn’t want to watch this. From the angle Blu positioned him, Tony can clearly see the lion’s jaws, the massive paws with long talon-like nails. The last thing he wants is to watch himself being devoured. He attempts to move but that’s when the lion decides to strike. He opens his mouth and seizes Tony’s shoulder and chest between his jaws.
“You need to stay put, soldier. You took a couple of shots that still need mending,” Sam said. The pressure on Steve’s uninjured shoulder forced him to remain in the bed. He met Sam’s concerned gaze and tried not to react, but his body betrayed him and shuddered against the pain. The heart monitor beeped away but it couldn’t mute the noises rising from the soul bonds. “It was him, wasn’t it?”
She places a soft hand on his arm and says, “Maybe we could have a memorial service for him, something private, if the government doesn’t want to acknowledge he was there.”
“It’s the only logical way,” Steve says. “You get out of here and get to stop this insanity of being hunted by him.”
“They are,” Natasha said. “She died for her king as a vampire and was resurrected. She can tell you more when you meet her.”
“The Passages are portals through to his innermost brain,” Tony pauses, heaves in a breath, and shivers against Steve. “Each rim is a defense. He built them in response to our invasion of his brain. The rules are simple because they have to be. He needs us to respond in a predictable way so he can defend and defeat us.”
“Well it’s better to know now than later,” Tony urges him with a quick wink.
He hasn’t placed in the upgrade to JARVIS for monitoring of human data yet, so he turns to Steve and his heart sinks. Eyes closed, Steve lies boneless in his seat with blood dripping from his nose.
Steve snickers. “So, you can read people’s minds?”
“No, don’t do that. It’ll get infected. We need water. For drinking and for cleaning up.” He makes the motion of drinking from a cup and then realizes that would make no sense to a lion, yet even as he fixates on how to translate the need for water, Blu lifts up his head and sniffs the air. “Are you searching for water, because that’s what we need unless something big bad and ugly is on its way. Tell me then.”
“We made it?” Steve murmurs. His ears ring.
Rogers straightened as if he’d heard a ghost. He climbed to his feet. It was obvious from how his bones stuck out and his pelvic bones were so obvious that he had been underfed for a long time. His abdomen looked caved in and his skin shined with a translucence that only flesh not seeing the sun for ages would. His legs bowed and he shivered as he stood up. Without sight, he still managed to stay well away from Rumlow. Tony approached him, carefully, tentatively.
“Not really seizures. Just like visions or images. Maybe they are seizures – maybe their petit mal seizures I don’t know and you’re having the big granddaddy seizures. We have to do something, Steve.” Maybe using someone’s name lends gravity and weight to the words.
“It’s not you, it’s me,” Tony claimed afterward, when Steve asked, probed, nearly crossed the line to bullying him into a confession. “I wanted to do this, you have to know I wanted to do this.”
Steve perks up and gets to his feet. “Bucky? Is he-?”
“No, no, no,” Steve says and yanks off his gloves to slap Tony on his face. His fingers are numb, the cold air and the water do not mix well at all.
“You know that’s not true,” Steve said, and he almost referred to their many times here in this dream space. Why wasn’t he? In the dream he would, he would tell Tony – I would never think of you as a burden. But the words died in his mouth and tasted of ash and dirt. He felt all the more bereft because of his own inaction.
“I thought you wanted it,” Clint commented as he started to round the nursing station. Tony had no other choice but to follow. “That’s what I heard anyway.”
The mechanical wisp of the Red Knight’s voice shudders through him like a memory of lives once lived in turmoil and pain. The Silver Knight clutches the reins tighter, spots the Gap fast resolving in his sights. It will be only minutes until death comes to claim him. Bless the Soul Keeper and bless his soul. Perhaps the demons will not feast on him tonight.
“What?”
“But like you said, no way through the wilderness out there not with how we’re equipped at least, and no way to stay.”
Tony looked up at Strange. He’d taken to talking about the dreamscape as he hunched over and stared at his folded hands. “He said he wanted to break the bond between us, set me free.”
Steven bites back his lips and nods. Pep meets Tony’s questioning gaze but neither of them have an answer to Steven’s strange behavior. After a few logistical plans, Tony finally turns to Steven and directs, “Could you go to Harry and finalize the security for the coalition meeting today?” Steven excuses himself and with only a bit of hesitation leaves them in the morning room.
“How do you know? How do you know I haven’t found him and know everything about him?”
“The ad for the position said must be musically inclined. Sax a plus.” Steve points to the portfolio pocket.
He's lost someone.
Is it a challenge or a lure, Steve isn't sure so he treads softly. His voice calm even after nearly eating the dirt from the fight the boy just rescued him from. "You know. He's all muscles and, like, has no front leg there. One of ‘em’s missing and all."
“Whoa there. You’re like a bucking horse. For Crips’ sake, calm down.” Tony looked wrecked, his lips bruised with kisses. Steve knew he must look the same, though probably more ruined and anxious and panting. He didn’t want to lose the excitement – or the courage. “You need to take a moment, Steve. We’re still a little punch drunk from that shared dream. We need to assess.”
He puts up his hands. “Okay, okay. But I need to be there. He’s counting on me.” For the first time, Tony realizes it’s true. He does need to be there, but it’s not because of Steve – not at all. He needs to be there to protect him. Who knows what mind tricks Ultron’s using? Hell, they thought Vision had shut Ultron out of the internet – Ultron even said it had happened, but then again, Ultron’s intentions and his actions rarely meshed.  The thought of Steve braving Ultron’s madness alone terrifies Tony – and that itself hurts deep in his chest where it surprises him.
“I’m here,” Steve said, as he sat down next to Tony. He leaned forward, yelling at whoever the driver was to move,
Steve didn't only stop.
. It was pain and desperation and lust, and maybe something he didn’t dare yet to even consider.
Steve’s eyes softened and he ran a hand across Tony’s cheek. “Comes with the early training.”
“Stay,” he said.
When reaching for Steve again didn’t help, Tony sat up with an annoyed groan. “You’re no fun,” he grumbled as he stood up, making sure to stretch thoroughly.
“Is it a good time for a visit?” he asked, not even bothering to ask if Tony was indeed in the lab.
“Touch me,” he said, almost an order.
Steve stifled a grin as he watched the two. They weren’t even half as bad as he and Tony when it came to PDA, keeping their affections towards another private. And yet, whenever they touched each other, it seemed as if they’d been together for
Tony snorted as he cupped his cheeks. “I was kinda banking on that.” He took Steve’s hand and guided it down to his crotch, pressing it against the hard bulge there. “And I’m right there with you.”
“If we don’t try it, we may not even
Tony somehow didn’t fit into anything. With his goatee, and his extravagant suits, it almost felt as if he didn’t belong into this world at all.
Steve groaned and held him firmly against him as he started to move faster. He was pounding against him, when finally his entire body tensed up so fiercely he couldn’t even move anymore. At that, Tony took over the movements, bouncing against him and squeezing him tightly. Steve’s forehead fell onto his shoulder, almost wheezing as he finally let go.
Ian stopped howling when Tony lifted him into his arms, but didn’t stop his fretting. He kept crying, his little breaths hiccupping every couple of moments. “Hey little man, it’s okay, daddy’s got you.”
After that, it was mostly routine work. They were able to free Sitwell and the rest of the hostages without any casualties; Natasha retrieved whatever data Fury had told her to retrieve and they vacated the premise without any difficulties.
Doubt flickered in Bucky’s eyes, along with confusion and fear. There was no belief yet… but there was the space for it. Then, anger overwhelmed his features as he threw another punch, screaming, “Shut up!”
Steve rolled his eyes. “And what would you have me do?”
And he did. How could he not? He had known something was going on, and it made sense that the Zemo guy hadn’t just wanted to blackmail Bucky. There were larger things at play.
Tony’s hands grasped his as though it was Steve holding him to the world and letting go would make all fall away.
Steve huffed, staring at the ceiling for a moment, before looking back at Bucky. “No. We’re … married.”
And oh, they were.
Tony eyed Steve with a weird mixture of disbelief and… fondness. The guy actually seemed to be amazed by DUM-E, and while Tony always had believed that the bot could be all kinds of amazing, this was… new.
“Should’ve told you no matter what,” Steve said firmly. “But thank you for… trying to see it from my point of view. You didn’t have to.”
“Oh fuck you,” Tony said, rubbing a hand over his eyes. “I don’t need your worldly wisdom.”
to see that we need to be put in check.”
The scene with Obadiah Stane was still on replay in his mind. The cane—of course he’d have a dagger inside that cane, it only seemed fitting for a cruel man like Stane. Had he really wanted to murder Steve, or had he only tried to scare him off?
“Yes,” Steve replied slowly, his heart in his throat. “I… forgive me, I have never…”
“Certainly, Steve.”
Steve watched him stretch, then looked away quickly. How long had he known Tony? Not so long, he reasoned, but this newfound fascination with him… that was…
Anyway. No more stalling. Tony fortified himself and opened the door. As soon as he took a step in, he heard the computer system announce his presence.
Had someone placed them here last night?
burn up, two years ago. So I’m gonna ask exactly one more time before I raise the alarm: Who. Are. You?”
The physical and emotional stress of the board meeting this morning sneaked up on him, and now that Tony finally had a minute to himself, he felt how much his feet and back—his whole body—ached. He yawned loudly and stretched his arms high above his head, wincing when his shoulders made a popping sound.
“Here, make a wish,” Steve prompted and raised the first cupcake in Tony’s direction. They were standing in the kitchen, preparing dessert. For a few blessed minutes, it was just the two of them, with Pepper monitoring Ian in the middle of all the craziness that was an Avengers team dinner.
“You’re going fast,” he murmured, looking into Tony’s brown eyes.
Tony considered this, then shrugged and relaxed. “Okay, fine. What do you want to talk about?”
Peter looked at him for a moment, before asking, “How’d you get the reputation of being such an asshole? You're terribly nice.”
Steve sighed, rolling his shoulders back, as he rattled off, “I’ll make my way North the same way as usual, crossing under the river using the old sewer tunnel. From the exit at Curtis Memorial, it’s a five-minute walk up to the outer elevators. Two if I run. There’s a lift on the west side of the south carrier I can use without setting off the alarms. It’s also far enough away from the main gate to avoid the guards. Then it’s three minutes across the upper level. As soon as I’m up, you and JARVIS will have my back.”
“This isn’t freedom,” Steve said, willing Fury to understand. “This is fear.”
Steve nodded. “I… I thought about going to the tower, or the facility, or intercept you on the way here, but I didn’t wanna come if I wasn’t welcome. This is neutral ground.” He shrugged somewhat. “And I wasn’t sure if my code’s still valid.”
“He isn’t eating?”
“One more step,” Tony said, an arm wound around Steve’s torso, as they walked up the stairway. No elevators, Tony groaned. What kind of a place doesn’t have a fucking elevator? And Steve was very much staggering. When Tony stuck his hand into the back pocket of Steve’s pants to reach for his keys, the guy was snorting against Tony’s neck, pressing against him again. And he was so goddamn cute when he was this carefree, this boisterous and straight-forward, Tony couldn’t help but kiss him again.
Steve rolled his eyes. “On a date, to a nice restaurant.”
So he took a last deep breath and slowly walked towards the entrance hall. The first thing he heard was Pepper’s confident voice, accompanied by Happy, who said something that made everyone around him laugh. Then, Steve rounded the corner and appeared at the top of the stairs.
Steve’s jaw tightened as he held his gaze. “Won’t let you die. You don’t get to breeze into my life and shake up my whole world view and then just leave like this.” He shook his head as he tied the sleeve tightly around him. “I don’t care what’s going on with you, and what you’re keeping from me—You don’t get to die like this.”
Natasha pressed her hips against his, smiling coyly when she felt how hard he already was. “We’ll see about that.”
After a few steps, Tony paused.
“Thor’s on his way back from London,” Clint said. “I told Bruce to stay on alert for now. Meet us in New Jersey. Figured he wouldn’t be all that keen to go underground.”
Tony blinked. “You do? How?”
“We best be getting back,” Steve told him.
Here we go guys, this is the final chapter. There will be an epilogue coming up, soon, though (: Hope you enjoyed this so far!
Suddenly, Natasha stepped up next to them, pointing on the phone in her hands. “Guys, I got a bogey. Short-range ballistic. Thirty seconds, tops.”
Steve's hands left their posts on Tony's sides in favor of cupping the man's face. He shut him up with a sound kiss, effectively swallowing anything else Tony might have wanted to say. Only when he was sure Tony wouldn't try to speak further did he pull back.
“What?” Tony snapped, his brown eyes blazing with anger as he turned around to face Steve. “And because I’m rich you think I’ve never slept in a fucking tent?”
Steve nodded once, one of his hands settling on Tony's thighs and his fingertips slightly digging in. The second Steve exhaled a shaky breath, Tony pushed forward. It was a tight fit at first, and Tony watched Steve's eyes widen when he breached him, but the slide was wet and easy, so Tony only paused for a moment, before he thrust all the way inside.
“Sadly, he doesn’t know much about interdimensional travel, yet,” Tony added. “He doesn’t know much about anything.”
“What?” Steve and Tony said in unison.
.” Natasha hesitated, obviously choosing her next words cautiously. That much was simple to decipher. Her gaze remained fixed on Steve. When she spoke up again, her voice was strangely thick, and not remotely her own. “Five years ago, I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran. It was a simple mission, until somebody shot out my tires in Odessa. We lost control, went straight over a cliff. I pulled us out, but The Winter Soldier was already there.” Her eyes became distant, lost in memory, while her fingers slowly rubbed circles into her abdomen. “I was covering my engineer, so he shot him… straight through me.”
Tony turned to him. “And you’re the first in line.”
Tony grimaced. “That’s disturbing.”
"I usually don't call them dates," Steve said, eyes set on Tony even as he was efficiently ridding himself of his utility belt and pushing down his pants. It was all so fast, and already getting quite hot.
“She’s with Bucky,” Steve said. “Said she’d come back, soon.”
clear, and that wasn’t easy for…” He trailed off as he saw another guy approach their table with visible reluctance and a glass in his hand. He had longish, messy brown hair, a bit of three-day stubble, and oh… only one arm.
Steve glanced at the happy young man once more before he lowered the tablet. He had a sickening feeling he already knew where this was going.
Steve opened his eyes and saw Tony swimming next to him. Feeling as light as he hadn’t in a very long time, Steve grinned again and splashed some water at him.
“Probably?” Steve echoed. “Tony, this is Bucky we’re talking about.”
that was stronger than them.
Tony snorted a laugh and walked a little bit ahead of them.
Steve paused and smiled at him, like he was sharing a private joke. Then he leaned down and pressed an innocent kiss against Tony’s lips. “Yeah, well, I love being ‘so terribly married’ to you.”
It was that thought that had him pull back reluctantly. He
Steve nodded, and quirked a smile. “Raincheck?”
It wasn’t the first time Tony asked himself if Strange remembered it--the
But Tony knew Steve was still searching for him and he had secretly started doing some research himself—not because he wanted to go after Barnes, he wasn’t that petty—he simply wanted to make sure the guy didn’t do something stupid and get himself killed in the process.
At a loss as to what else to do, Tony picked up the stack of mail that Steve had left in its usual place on the cupboard. He rifled through the letters with only the mildest of interest—he could already see from the envelope that those were SHIELD reports Steve had filled out and were not worth opening.
“Out like a light. Think Thor wore him out.”
“Heading your way, Shellhead,” Natasha called and Tony heard Steve grunting something in agreement.
Clint and Thor were munching on a stack of pancakes drenched in maple syrup, Natasha was rigidly staring out of the window, and Bruce—now wearing one of Sam’s pants and a shirt—was inspecting the gunshot wound beneath Tony’s left armpit while he was waiting for his cup of tea to steep. The graze was healing over quickly and with no signs of inflammation. It wasn’t that deep really, and they all knew that Extremis would fix it in no time, but both Bruce and Steve had insisted that it’d be cleaned to keep it from getting infected.
“Natasha…” he started, sighing. He had no idea how she did this—always knowing what was going on in Steve’s head.
of all times. Only four months ago he’d kissed Sharon, convinced it was what he wanted, and then Tony had come clean on his breakup with Pepper and then…
“He’s so beautiful,” Tony prompted, knowing exactly what went through Steve’s head right now, because his mind was basically stuck on replay since he’d picked up his son for the first time. “Aren’t you a beauty, Ian?”
of trying to talk to Tony and failing monumentally, Steve was going to take whatever tiny chance he got.
Even when Tony had been on the front pages for a whole two weeks, Steve had never once distrusted him. A paparazzi had taken photographs of him leaving a hotel suite with his business partner, who happened to also be an attractive, young a woman Tony Stark was allegedly cheating on him with. Tony had ranted and raved on the millions he’d be suing the guy for and Steve just…
mistake,” he said without so much as a hello. “Stark is a complete maniac. He’s reckless and he’s still mourning his wife. Didn’t you listen to me at all?”
Steve froze. Logically, he knew that he was Tony’s boyfriend. It just sounded odd to his ears—hearing that he was anyone’s boyfriend, let alone Tony’s.
, did you know that? She drowned in the ocean at Stark Mansion. Her body was found weeks later, washed along the shore miles from where her boat reportedly sunk. And your poor, devastated
“Tony, I—”
Tony took a deep breath. “We need to talk.”
What if he fell down into the water?
Stephanus had bidden him goodbye soon after, with a final kiss and a few murmured declaration of love. There were things the human brain didn’t remember without a trigger, Tony knew that. And Steve’s words were followed by a story that built upon itself as memories broke through the walls of Tony’s mind.
Steve found his spot at the counter. It had been years since he'd been here, but he remembered exactly he’d sat down back then. After placing an order, Steve looked around and let himself turn inwards. He saw a few guys sitting around a table on the far corner of the place, one of them wearing a cast on his left arm. They were probably celebrating that guy's release from the hospital, Steve mused, noting the bruises and the darkened skin on his cheek.
“A shitty one because we don’t have Strange,” Tony added in the driest of voices.
He’d been thinking about this almost every minute after Ultron’s attack on Extremis. At first he’d been sure that the techno virus was broken for good, but soon after, the buzzing in his mind had started again. He couldn’t really access Extremis yet, but he felt it repairing itself. And he knew it wouldn’t be long until he was back online.
“Don’t you feel how hard I am?” Tony asked sultry, grinding into him.
Tony thought, his cheek leaning on the big claw in front of him.
“First correction, I am Swiss,” Zola said with his strangely distorted voice. “Second, look around you, I have never been more alive! In 1972, I received a terminal diagnosis. Science could not save my body. My mind, however, that was worth saving, on two hundred thousand feet of data banks. You are standing
That had Sam’s eyebrows rise to his hairline, and almost immediately, he glanced to Bucky.
“You look about ready to punch me,” Tony commented, but did as he was told, anyway. Probably didn’t have a choice in the matter.
was new as well. “Someone might think it’s a little strange how much attention you pay to my eating habits.”
Steve’s heart started pounding. There was a strain in Tony’s voice he’d never heard before, and for half of a second, Steve thought he might be as nervous as he was.
“I feel manhandled,” Tony said, chuckling between kisses. He was trapped in Steve’s grip but without any real want of escape. Steve’s chest was heaving—Tony couldn’t even put in words how much he loved the fact that he was the reason Steve was out of breath—and his eyes were searching Tony’s for an unnamed
At first, he’d just been curious.
“Oh that makes sense, of course,” Tony said, a bit hysterical all of a sudden, and Steve had genuinely no idea what he was talking about. “You’re… you’re supposed to be
“Well… no. Not exactly. I just…” He looked at him. “We need to talk.”
When Steve was finally lying naked before him, Tony took a good few seconds to simply look at him. “I missed you so fucking much.”
Steve’s expression hardened. “Every time you look at me, it’s like you’re seeing a ghost. You smile and laugh and then it’s like you’re remembering yourself, remembering that you hate my guts.”
“What’s your name?” Tony asked.
“If you say so,” Steve mused, but he didn’t look particularly bothered by it.
It was a battle of wills with them. Always had been. And yet, this was something entirely different. Tony had shoved him to a corner. Trying to do something for him by lying right to his face. And he
“The, uh, ventilation system broke down, but it looks like there’s a stream of air coming in through the—uh...”
Steve lifted his water glass to take a sip, but before drinking, he shook his head, his brows pinching in thought. "Michelangelo, though?" He drank then, and set the glass down, squeezing Tony's hand lightly. "You're more the genius type than I am, you know."
Steve snorted. “I think today counts as a day of the Hell-freezing variety.”
Damn it all.
Thor laid one of his big hands on Tony’s shoulder, trying to keep him still. “Friend Tony, maybe it would be wise to—”
Steve nodded stoically and Tony could tell by the way Fury pursed his lips next to him that he was not happy with Steve’s plan either. He looked for all the world like Steve had taken him down a notch or two, and Tony was kind of glad that he hadn’t been there for that particular conversation.
Tony huffed, but kissed Steve nevertheless. “At least one of us is confident about that, then.” Rhodey would be thrilled, sure, and Natasha would likely accept him back with a shrug and a clap to the back of his head. Wilson wouldn’t care much either way, maybe grateful that he could tease Steve a little more. He had zero idea where he stood with Vision, but he hadn’t shown any signs of animosity earlier. The Maximoff girl, however, likely still hated his guts and Tony guessed in the grand scheme of things, that they didn't really trust him, and it would take a lot of time to become a part of this new group.
Tony huffed, but didn’t object. Instead, there was a small smile tugging on his lips.
distrust me?” Steve asked.
“Da-da,” Ian giggled as Tony blew a raspberry into his tummy before raising him into the air and doing a full-turn that had his son laughing in delight.
Shock and confusion fell over Bucky’s features, the fire fading. It happened quickly but there was no mistaking the change, shining through in recognition without control.
They always referred to Tony as ‘the person’, because even though Steve knew it wasn’t illegal anymore to be with another man, he couldn’t bring himself to share that bit of information, yet, and Natasha never asked.
, not more or less than everyone of us.”
“Я ненавижу это,” he ground out.
He had to pretend there was something in his eyes when she said that. If she knew the effect those words had on him these days, she didn’t show it.
It would be different if Steve were here in the flesh. Tony made no mistake in admitting to himself that if Steve had said these things to his face, right now, he wouldn’t have gotten past saying his name without a fist to his nose. But he wasn’t there. He was a voice through a receiver that had no face, no piercing blue eyes to see right through him.
“Tony, if you didn’t want us to come you should’ve—”
“It’s beautiful,” Steve said, and it was. It really really was.
“Well, hello,” he said, nodding without sitting up. “What brings
Last night had been distracious on so many levels. The man’s speech that was trending on every media channel, but mostly the fact that Fury had taken away his chance to break the news to Steve himself.
And Steve couldn’t take it anymore. He couldn’t handle Tony being so far from him. Standing just inches from where he was and yet miles away.
Tony was stunned, his eyes trailing over him as he tried to get his bearings. Then, he looked down at himself.
He’d never been fucked this hard before. All he could do, as Steve practically plowed into him without mercy, was to hold onto the bench with everything he had. He tried thrusting back into every stroke, desperate to have more of Steve in him, but his movements were clumsy at best. He couldn’t keep up at all, completely lost in the sensation, and eventually just slumped forward and took it.
Steve stiffened, realizing what he’d just said. And when he glanced at Rhodey, he saw a strange sadness in his eyes.
It were times like these that reminded Tony how very lucky he was to have these people as his friends.
"It could
“We’d been down in your workshop. You’d been tinkering on a suit and you’d talked a mile a minute while you worked. I’m not even sure you were aware what you were saying. You talked about the recent upgrades you’ve made to our gear, about the newest developments on the Iron Legion, but you were also dropping a few hints here and there, about you and Pepper. That she was looking for an apartment in Malibu, or that you were thinking about redecorating the penthouse. You were very casual about all of it, and I wasn’t sure it meant anything, but I remember it was the first time I realized you might be single again and…”
Both of their gazes dropped down again, and Tony felt Ian’s surprisingly strong grip around his finger tighten even more. For a moment, Tony thought he was smiling at him, but then again, it was probably just gas.
"Hey!" Steve protested.
“Probably,” Steve agreed distractedly. He couldn’t really get the depths of Tony’s eyes right, and it was starting to go on his nerves.
The devil.
“Started thinking again, didn’t you?”
Tony didn’t blame him. After all, he hadn’t spoken to him in over two hours. He’d only sat hunched over the new War Machine prototype for the better part of the day, adamant to finally finish it so Rhodey could give it a first try.
Steve sighed. Here we go again. Of course Tony would immediately fall back into their usual half-distant kind of communication, the closeness of their latest calls vanishing into thin air. “I booked the one that was most secluded. I didn’t look into their ‘about’ page.”
“He’d do anything for you,” Vision observed idly.
As everyone in the room stood up, Steve balled both of his hands into fists. “But—”
“Is he now,” Tony said, one corner of his mouth rising. “Trying to keep him from killing any more people, now? You didn’t seem to care much in Germany.”
Only now, he realized that his other arm, the metal one, was hanging limply at his side.
Sam grinned at him, eyes shimmering with amusement. “You should’ve seen him these past few weeks. I knew something was bugging him, but I had no idea that bug was you.”
TS 1:24 P.M.>Oh. Good! Expecting countdown kisses
There was nothing to say. Tony was overpowered. Something inside him splintered and his heart was hammering, as every string that had once been tied to Extremis screamed in protest.
“Here,” Steve said. When Tony looked up, he saw Steve walking to his desk, reaching under the surface and pulling the watch out of a small drawer, as if he’d done so a million times.
Tony ran a hand through his hair. “I know. Pepper called me.”
He’d known, from the start, that something had been off in the way Tony’s team had attacked them. It
When they’d arrived at the address Agent Romanoff had given them, they’d stood in front of an enormous building. Above the front entrance Steve could see the inscription:
“Sometimes your principles really make you blind to other people’s needs,” Tony whispered.
He’d probably laugh at his dumbfound expression and tell him to get his head outta his ass.
He needed to keep it together. There was still a war to be fought, and they finally had a lead on Arnim Zola. Tomorrow, they’d lead a stealth attack on one of HYDRA’s trains, and maybe they’d finally make some headway of getting to Schmidt.
Tony smiled at him and nodded. “That seems to be the moral of the tale, yes.”
It was still weird, seeing him with the new hair cut, but the smartass grin was definitely the same in every timeline.
Steve smiled. “Hell yeah.”
Tony smiled dryly and sipped at his coffee again. “I’m just beginning to realize that there are a few things Hammer and I have in common.”
They’d agree that Steve would be driving from time to time. Tony
Staying in the shadows for a moment, Bucky took a deep breath, then followed her over the threshold. As expected, all conversations immediately stilled.
“Good,” Tony said, pressing himself nearer. “How about—”
Tony blinked at him as walked closer. “Pardon?”
Pietro held up his hands passively, “Why should we talk to you? You’re skeevy power-hungry people.”
A smile crept up onto Steve’s lips and made itself at home there. Weeks had passed since he’d departed from New York, and there wasn’t one minute when he didn’t miss Tony.
“Gotta stop,” Steve warned and Tony froze for a second, his brown eyes trailing upward. His mouth, however, remained stubbornly locked around him.
He was looking at him intensely, though he didn’t move to remove the mask.
“What’s that?” Tony whispered, sitting down next to Steve and handing him the bottle.
“I know,” he said finally. “Sometimes he visits me in the shop and I push some granola bars in his direction. He always gets distracted and forgets to eat it.”
And Steve sat like that, aware of the others talking quietly around him. He heard Bucky and Tony say something about damage limitation, bringing in the Stark Relief Foundation, and funding of repair works and fixes on the Hulkbuster. When Steve looked over to Bruce, who sat in a dark corner of the Quinjet and looked to be on the verge of crying, he put two and two together. It was his job to comfort his team in a situation like this, but his limbs felt heavy, he couldn’t form a clear thought, and all Steve could do was lean back and stare into the distance.
Steve frowned thoughtfully. “Mmm… I don’t recall any sucking.”
“Джеймс?”
Tony fell quiet for half a minute, his eyes darting around slightly while he stared at the dark road ahead of them. Clearly, he would be making this one count. Then, he eventually asked with a very quiet voice, “How many people have you kissed in your life?”
Steve shook his head, realizing he couldn’t talk about it. He just needed proof Tony was real. He needed proof he wasn’t hallucinating within a dream. Thus, with conviction, he pulled his head back just slightly and cupped Tony’s cheeks, kissing him. Steve wanted to crawl up inside him—he wanted Tony to feel the thundering beat of his heart and taste the tears on his lips and realize that this was the only thing that kept him upright right now.
That was good, Tony told himself firmly and allowed Ultron to topple him to the ground. He’d prepared himself for this, he’d analyzed it, accepted it, there was no need to fear, no need to second-guess himself.
* * *
Yeah. Sure.
He still often woke up terrified that he was back in Zola’s basement, in the container they had locked him in. The place that had been his prison for years that felt like an eternity. That everything that happened since would be accredited to a dream, and this place, Natasha, Steve, everything… would only be a place he had imagined in a fit of despair.
There was nothing for a good few minutes; nothing but the mingled pants that colored the space around them. Tony’s arms and legs were still abound Steve and Steve’s face was buried in the hollow of his throat.
"Me neither," he said truthfully, then pulled a little back, letting his eyes roam Tony's form. It was amazing how sexy he was, how much of a turn on just seeing him sprawled under Steve could be. "You're amazing," he whispered, then reached for the lube and condoms. Making quick work of opening the box and removing one foil pack, Steve tossed the rest of the condoms aside. He handed the condom to Tony and shifted their positions until he was settled between Tony's legs. "Alright?" he asked, reaching for the lube.
“Right,” Tony said, swallowing. “I get a check-up regularly, and I’m clean, so… I wouldn’t mind… going bare. But I don’t mind the condom either.”
Steve sighed heavily, and Tony realized that he too had expected—and probably dreaded—those words all along. Tony found he still often underestimated the level of Steve’s empathy. “You got out for a good reason, Sam,” Steve said quietly. “I didn’t come here to bring you into this mess.”
. The sweatpants were only mildly interesting, though, since Steve’s bare chest was also littered with dozens of hickeys and scratch marks and that was…
Steve groaned when Tony’s teeth scratched his lips and his tongue licked against him with fervor that had every cell in Steve’s body wracked with tension. He barely had time to kiss him back before Tony deprived him of his mouth again. “If Fury’d said one more goddamn word, I would’ve killed him,” he growled, nipping at Steve’s throat as he made his way down his body without ceremony.
Nowadays, Tony didn’t need to concentrate on Extremis as much as he used to in the early days after Maya Hansen had injected him with the techno-virus. He could do most things simultaneously by now. Walking while calculating projects, having a whole conversation while building new weapons for the team, kissing Steve while inventing another revolutionary energy system.
“It’s not helping… my being here. I’m just the rain on the parade.” He paused, his hand on the railing as he glanced up at the Helicarriers. For weeks, Tony had been elbow-deep into constructing the new repulsor engines. He hadn’t known about the weapons, though. Steve was sure of that. Tony wouldn’t keep something like that from him. “I won’t agree on this. You don’t need me.”
It hurt to know that it might be Steve’s end as well, but then again… he’d always known Steve would go down fighting, too. In that regard, they had always been alike.
, Tony. I know that,” Steve said on an eyeroll. “I’m aware that it’s a huge responsibility. I’m aware it’s gonna be tiresome and strenuous, but it’s gonna be
"Thanks," Steve said, then lifted the bottle to his lips. Harsh honesty had always been the way to go between them before the accident, and Steve, still getting used to having Bucky around after such a long time, appreciated the consistency. "Feel shittier."
A small smile touched Tony’s face and his lips found Steve’s. Damn, he’d
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve smiled when he stepped into the room. Although Bucky’s attention seemed focused on the television, his hands were idly playing with Natasha’s hair, stroking it back from her forehead and twining her curls around the fingers of his metal hand. For Natasha’s part, she looked half-asleep, her eyes glazed and nearly shut, her gaze trained on nothing at all. If she were a cat, Steve was sure he would have been purring.
“Breathe, Tony,” Steve reminded him.
Tony could feel Steve standing right behind him now, and realized that this would all be over really fast. He sighed heavily. The vials blurred the longer he stared at them.
Steve sighed, but accepted the brush-off—for now. The entire situation was bound to be awkward for both of them; he just needed to figure out how to handle it. He knew Tony was embarrassed, knew that he was hurt.
Steve startled awake, kicking and tangling in his blanket in a hurry to rise to his feet. "Buck
Instantly, Tony connected to Extremis and called Iron Man to him, watching as the red and gold plates bled across his body. Once he was encased in metal, the faceplate slid shut, and JARVIS pointed him to the two dozen HYDRA agents in front of him. He flew upwards, shooting repulsor blasts at the men closing up on Steve.
He reached for his shield, and walked towards the woods. Turning around one last time, he saw Tony sitting hunched at the fire, face in both of his hands, the pork lying forgotten on the ground. And he tried not give way to satisfaction, knowing that this was just as hard on Tony as it was on Steve.
,” Tony murmured. “In a few minutes you’ll remember all the reasons why you decided a life in the middle of a goddamn jungle was better than actually talking things through with me. Why on earth can you believe that won’t have an impact on our relationship?”
“So you just want to let them turn us into super-cops,” Clint said, frowning. He was still paging through the Accords, his expression becoming graver by the second.
“I’m afraid mister Odinson left the tower a couple of hours ago.”
Steve nodded vehemently. “It is. It’s—”
Steve almost shoved him away in frustration. Instead, he kept one hand on Tony’s back to keep him steady, while he used his other to pull the bottle out of Tony’s grasp. “That’s your solution to everything, isn’t it?” he asked him. “Can’t deal with something, just mock it.”
—because however much Bucky’s words were meant to soothe him, they mostly brought back all of those horrible memories of Tony lying lifelessly on the ground. The palladium, the Chitauri invasion, Aldrich Killian,
Steve could easily feel the tension radiating through Tony’s body, could sense the confusion threading through his emotions, while every single one of them magnified and multiplied within him. This wasn’t what either of them had wanted for the team, and things would get less pleasant now, Steve knew it.
He cleared his throat. “Should we start?”
Natasha pulled back and smiled into his eyes, caressing his cheek. “Я вас любил: любовь еще, быть может…” she quoted softly. “В душе моей угасла не совсем.”
.” He pulled his hand from Steve’s and instead held his face in both hands. “For me you’re worth it, Steve. Every bit of it. You have to believe that.”
On his way over to Steve, his head butted hard with Sam’s chest, rendering the man completely unprepared to block Natasha’s kick to his face.
While Steve started to laugh next to him, Tony called himself lucky he hadn’t wetted his pants at the end of it all.
. Tony really hated it when Steve said his name in that certain way. Like he
“Yeah,” Tony admitted. He sighed. “But it’ll heal, and it was worth it. I couldn’t… I couldn’t let him hurt you.”
Tony sighed while squatting down in front of Steve. “We talked about this. It’s good to push him out of his comfort zone. Just please don’t do it on your own.”
“Mmm,” Tony murmured, his eyes fluttering shut, enjoying the soft caresses Steve played across his neck. “That feels nice.”
Steve mimicked the gesture, then wrapped his arms around Tony, closing his eyes.
“No,” Natasha said shortly. The tenure of her voice suggested anything but reason. As though her word verified the end of all discussion and a motion to move to the next suggestion. “We have no idea if we can get you out after.”
call Phil. He will want to be here for the meeting. If nothing else: He knows Ross, and I think his opinion might be important.”
“So he’s a ghost story.”
Steve bit his lower lip.
They all nodded gravely.
Bruce winced. “Tony.”
Steve lowered his hand slowly when Stane finally relinquished it. That Stane never even bothered to supply his own name showed how little respect he had for Steve, and Steve's smile only grew sharper. That'd make things a little easier for Steve if things deteriorated.
Every time they had sex was phenomenal, leaving him awed, but this—whatever had just happened—left him utterly speechless. It took a long moment just to bring the motion to a complete halt, as Steve felt aftershocks rocking Tony's body ever so often, his own body trembling in kind. His hand finally let go of Tony's dick, letting his fingers slide a little upwards, splaying his palm across Tony's belly as he hugged him close. What could he even say now that would do justice to what had just happened?
Amazingly, they’d all made it.
helped in Tony’s case.
Tony’s eyes scanned those words over and over again, realizing that it really had to be true then. In four years, he and Steve had at last learned to work together, live together, spend time together. And they had really become friends again?
“I keep replaying it in my head,” Tony said. “Not just our little stuntshow there, but the whole thing… and I…” He trailed off, then glanced back up at him as well. “Do you think if you and I had ever learned to get along better… If you felt like you could’ve maybe trusted me, that you—”
Natasha petted Steve’s shoulder with a reassuring hand. “Don’t listen to him. It’s not
“Because I don’t want to talk about… what you want to talk about.”
Steve, his shield now safely cradled in one hand, took a step forward, his expression grave. “You killed someone?”
Rationally, Steve knew that, while Mister Stark enjoyed his company very much, he most certainly wished another pair of eyes would look back at him. And yet, the days they spent together were simply wonderful. He loved listening to Mister Stark when he talked about his marvelous inventions and he was dazed with how fast his mind seemed to work. Listening to his ideas about the future, about what the world might one day look like… it was humbling.
Tony heard water running. FRIDAY must’ve turned on the coffee machine. He considered opening his eyes to see what time it was, but the room was still dark and his pillow was so soft that he decided to roll over and burrow under the covers instead. When he tried to move, however, his gut caught on fire and pain exploded through him, making him groan.
“You know we’re kind of obligated to share any crucial information with the UN now, right?” Natasha asked, though the corners of her mouth had lifted slightly.
Steve smiled at the sight, he just couldn’t help himself. Tony’s hair was tousled, his shirt had holes in it and there were about a dozen stains on his arms.
He closed his eyes for just a second, collecting himself, before he leaned forward. He nipped at Steve’s lips, then reached to the side and opened the drawer. The lube was easy enough to find, and when he located a row of condoms too, he grabbed for those as well. “Just checking,” he said, his lips hovering above Steve’s, “we don’t need those, do we? If you’d like to have a barrier, I can work with that, too.”
Tony frowned and expelled a worried breath.
Tony swallowed. “No.”
“I… might’ve read up on clean energy a little.”
Wordlessly, he handed Steve’s ring back, trying to decide whether he really wanted answers to the questions trying to leap off his tongue.
“What do you think I’m doing?”
SR 0:02 A.M>Sounds like a plan
It was wonderful. The liberating feel of just being able to kiss Steve whenever he wanted. The feel of his lips on Steve’s. Forming that connection again.
“Sounds good to me.”
“What’s the matter with you?” Tony asked, frowning slightly. “You look kinda spooked. Is it about the slime? I told you I’m perfectly fine.”
of it, had been too much to handle without the proper outlet.
Steve blinked. “Well—It’s true.
Eventually, Bucky had come to a standstill near the sofa. A stack of books lay beside it and he stooped down to read the titles, most of which he probably recognized, because Steve’s fondness for classics hadn’t changed much in the last seventy-something years.
, Zemo’s voice announced via the speakers.
“Really?” Natasha frowned. “From what you told me, you seemed close.”
“Oh, yeah,” Tony said with a grin, rubbing more soap into his skin. “It never stood a chance. Carol and Thor did that new thing they trained for, and that was basically it. They struck him down so hard it exploded on the spot. Magnificent, I tell you. Right, Steve?”
[TStark] [chat_server:46953]
“Oh, right,” Pepper replied good-naturedly. “Tony mentioned that you were the traveling companion of that horrid person. Justin Hammer, wasn’t it? The guy couldn’t produce a working weapon if we gave him all of our money.”
Tony’s mouth opened wide. “Steven Rogers!” he gasped, scandalized. “Did you just make a sex joke?”
“Do, too.”
“I think it’s a possibility,” Jarvis confirmed.
Tony read the line again, his brow furrowed with thought. It seemed so crazy that everyone thought that he and Steve were over.
Taking a deep breath, Tony decided to just jump right into the middle. “There’s… something that’s called Infinity Stones. Cosmic… entities, if you will. Very powerful. There’s six of them. Space, Mind, Reality, Power, Soul, and Time. In… in about two years, we’re gonna be fighting a power-hungry warlord from outer space—Good friend of Loki, by the way—, and you can probably guess what he’s after.”
“I don’t know how to fix this,” Tony admitted, and for the first time in so long, he was able to see beyond the rage and grasping that tiny chance that might not have been lost, after all.
They both smiled as their lips touched and kissed unhurriedly for a few seconds. These days, every moment they had for themselves needed to be treasured. Having Tony’s arms around him, his scent filling Steve’s nose, it was everything.
It was unbelievable. How much better everything was, now that they faced it together.
And yet, he couldn’t keep this charade up much longer. It was driving him nuts.
“Trust? I’m freaking out here!”
Tony smiled. “Then I don’t see the problem. We can’t get married, obviously. But by all means, I’m offering you all the pleasantries of becoming my husband. I could take you to Florence and Paris and Barcelona. Everywhere you want.”
God, it was driving him mad. As if his heart was too big, as if he couldn’t breathe. For so long he had worried that he was not capable of loving someone. But now, with Tony at his side, it felt that his past life—it was all dim and unimportant.
Steve frowned. “Could you be any more cryptically? What’s wrong all of a sudden?”
A sob escaped Steve’s lips, the sound mercifully unnoticed by the others. The comm at his ear buzzed insistently and he ignored it, tempted to switch off the damned thing. He knew the others tried to connect with him, but Steve didn’t want to hear it. Twice more the device buzzed and the third time, he grabbed it and broke it down the middle.
And as for Steve… Well… He might not strictly be straight, but he hadn’t considered men like that, not in a very long while and never with serious intent. Not that he hadn’t ever given it the a thought, but it just… there had always been more important things to think about, and he’d always expected to at least try and date Sharon at some point.
And Ian loved her, too, babbling away excitedly when Natasha asked him questions, calling her ‘Asha’, ‘Asha’, over and over again while he made grabby hands at her. Two-word-sentences still seemed to be it, for now, but Steve was sure that rather sooner or later, he’d really be talking their ears off.
Tony shook his head as he reached into his back pocket, drawing out a small key. There was only one single door on this floor and Steve’s heartbeat quickened when they all walked closer. “No,” Tony said. “He’s on a business trip. He said something about a big deal.”
It was already late in the afternoon when Steve came back home from today’s hunt. He didn’t know when exactly the meadow had become ‘home’ but he didn’t question it. When he didn’t find Tony there, he decided to walk towards the river.
“Good to have you back, man,” Sam said, clapping a hand on his shoulder, after Steve had dressed himself.
Excusing himself, he headed towards one of the bathrooms. Instead of going in, however, he walked further along the corridors, and came to a halt in front of the large windows. There was a minor storm outside, the wind rustling through the trees and distant flashes illuminating the jungle.
He raised the disc up a little, and when he was sure Steve had seen it, leaned it against the wall next to the bathroom door.
[TStark] [chat_server:46953]
Or it wasn’t—not for this time’s Steve.
“You don’t have morning breath.”
Tony felt a growing tightness in his groin, and it took a lot of willpower for him to put a bit of pressure on Steve’s chest, signaling him to stop.
Strange looked at him in that stupid docile way of his. “Then I suppose we’re doomed.”
* * *
“Bucky!”
Watching the liquid depths of Tony's eyes, Steve knew he was going to do whatever it took to keep this. Even if things with Tony could get difficult, occasionally—he was never one to back away from a challenge.
Steve flopped down in his back, whining. “But… he’s such an
Steve, it's already well past the kid's bedtime," Bucky urged when Steve still hesitated.
“I’m betting I can beat that,” Tony called over.
“Oh, you really are.”
“What does it matter, anyway? I know everything, as do you,” he said in return and pressed their foreheads together. “This is crazy, I feel like my mind’s ripped in two… I can still feel you kissing me goodbye.”
“It was an accident. You didn’t kill her.”
“I know,” Steve said. “But we both know it’s not good for me to stay.”
a godfather.
“Don’t ruin the moment,” Natasha chided and leaned back against Bucky, who only smiled at Steve in the most easy-going way he’d seen him smile since he’d join their team. Bucky reached for his beer and raised it in Steve’s direction, quietly toasting him with the bottle.
“If you knew…” Bucky said, while staring at the floor, “what I’ve done…”
Steve glanced up again. “Of course.”
“I don’t know what… just
Steve frowned. “Don’t we just wait until they activate the time machine?”
All around them, the people broke out into cheers as their school’s team set foot on the playfield for the big final game. Most were already chanting Steve’s name like he was the God of Sports himself.
“Whoa,” Tony exclaimed theatrically. “Would you look at that? From Russia With Love finally found their way back to humanity.” As Tony walked by, he dropped a noisy kiss on Steve’s lips, humming appreciatively before sauntering to the coffee machine.
. And however much they bickered and argued, they always managed to work through it in the end.
He still couldn’t wrap his mind around that fact. That he’d done so many horrible things, fucked up everything so completely. That despite it all, somehow, he’d ended up with this.
It didn't matter that Tony's primary intention was probably lewd. Steve didn't think sexual interest was a bad thing, not at all, and he hurried along the task of throwing off the heavily plated garments.
. It’s—” Tony bristled, then looked down at Ian. “Hey buddy, say ‘da-da’.”
Didn’t mean he wasn’t still mad, wasn’t still furious. But in times like these, Steve had learned to cling to the good things, as few or rare as they were.
“I’m not sure I would have now. If Barnes hadn’t given me the weirdest shovel-talk in all history… I thought he’d lost his mind for even thinking this was a possibility.”
His voice was quiet and the self-loathing made itself apparent, though Tony obviously tried not to let any emotions show, and Steve thought that maybe, for the first time, he truly understood why Tony had become the man he was today.
“It was a metaphor! I didn’t actually mean we should go hiking!”
“Liar…” Tony dipped his head. “Come on, shower, then you need your beauty rest. We don’t have to do anything tonight.”
“The doctor, can he control them?”
“I thought I was over this,” Bucky said, looking chagrined.
“Bucky, tell me.”
“This place is just too large. The poor boy likely got lost,” Pepper said and cast Steve a brilliant smile. She extended a hand in his direction. “Hello. You must be the man who managed to find our friend behind all that gloomy exterior.”
crushing on Steve, wasn’t he?
Tony swallowed. “Yes.”
“But then, I’m afraid you will have to share all of your artwork with me, too,” Tony added with a loveable cheeky grin, obviously eager to change the topic. “That’s only fair. And I mean all of them. Even the naked sketches you think I don’t know about.”
For two days, it felt as though he was living two lives at once. With Ian, everything was going well, much better than he’d expected. The little nugget had simply wormed his way into their lives and nowadays, Tony couldn’t even remember how he had spend his days without his son at his side. However, Tony couldn’t help thinking on what lay ahead, and even though he thought about it twenty-four-seven, he didn’t know what to do about it.
of the other rooms would’ve been a better choice.
“Are you enjoying yourself?” Tony asked as soon as they had a bit of privacy.
"You're only gonna sit there and mope, and then you're going to waste months of your life wondering what if and I can't sit here and let that happen. He invited me to SI? Well, guess what: I'm going. And you're coming with."
“Oh God,” Steve rolled his eyes. “Yeah, he’s really getting up there, isn’t he? Seems like it was only six weeks ago that we brought him home. Where
Truth was, he’d probably done this a little bit too often, and he
“Well,
Tony searched his face. “Thought we agreed it wouldn’t be.”
Steve briefly closed his eyes, sighing. “I didn’t know that.”
A helpless groan left him at Tony's single word. Steve knew that even if Tony never said he loved him again, it wouldn't matter. It would be things like this that would make it clear enough. He gave a few sharper thrusts, complementing them with nice, tight strokes to Tony's cock. Trust Tony to say the sappiest thing when Steve was doing everything he could to make him lose all control.
There was a prolonged pause. “Do you think he’s ready to… live with us?”
He still felt the fear. The terror. A foreboding so inherent he wondered if he had ever believed in anything else; wondered if this terrible destiny had been there, hanging right above their heads all along, and Tony had just been too blind to see it.
Tony heaved a low breath. It obviously took him a long moment to let that idea sink in, but when it did, he didn’t look too troubled by it. “We could build a bigger shelter. Log cabin or something,” he offered.
Next to them, Hulk slammed a fist on his hairy chest and cast Steve a vicious little grin, as if saying,
, Rogers,” he threatened as Steve continued to shove the water at him.
Steve shook his head, slowly. “You know… when the WSC fired that nuke on New York, you did something they told you not to do, simply because it was the right thing, and I respect you for that.” He paused and drew in a deep breath. “I’d hoped it would also make you reconsider taking the line of least resistance.”
By the time they left the highway to drive on to Gatlinburg, the sun was just setting outside. The Townsend Campground was situated right in the middle of the mountains, with a spectacular view into the valley, with its various waterfalls and hundreds, millions of trees.
Tony nodded. “Well, I’m gonna call Bruce. Strange would be a better option, but after the mess with Urthona, he took a time-out, so… we’ll try, but I don’t think he’ll be of help. You said Strange is already around in your time?”
“You’re drunk,” he realized.
“Oh, really? Imagine how much I care about that right now. I’m not gonna let him kill you while you’re waving the white flag around.”
That haunted tone Steve hated so much had crept into his voice without warning. The implication made Steve’s bones sting.
The future still terrified him, but he felt he could bear it now as long as she was at his side.
And the darkest part of him knew the truth. He was never meant to keep this happiness. And when he’d fallen to his knees right next to Steve’s dead form, there was no hope to grasp. No enemy to fight, nothing to rage against. There was nothing but this—only his grief.
Thank you all for your enthusiastic response! We hope you enjoy this part as much as we enjoyed writing it ^^
Despite his lack of sleep, Steve felt strangely alert. Too alert to go to bed—at the least that was the excuse he was going for right now.
So far, he hadn’t left his room on medical, never even asked for it. Instead, he was watching them. It seemed to be his favored pastime now, watching life pass before his eyes. He would watch them talk, watch Steve and Natasha bicker over movie choices right in front of his room, or listen to Clint and Sam discussing maneuvers and past missions.
Backing away a little, Tony pulled his goggles off and, because it was the obvious choice, put them over the suit’s helmet. “That’s nice,” he said, pointing a finger towards the bottles of beer and to what actually looked like homemade sandwiches. “I’m just gonna wash up real quick, okay?”
Steve nodded. “Noted, thanks.”
“And here I thought you had all of these complex tactics and strategies going, this looks a bit sloppy,
“We won’t just be able to dissect how deep HYDRA’s infiltration rang,” Tony admitted. “I know that,
Steve nodded, taking his word for what it was, before his eyes momentarily flickered to the side. On the HUD, Tony saw Bucky running for them, and he heaved a low breath.
[TStark] [chat_server:46953]
The gym wasn't helping. Painting wasn't helping. Even jogging didn't get him tired enough to forget about the visions. They were just so surreal…
“‘s alright,” he whispered back.
Steve smiled. “It was a pretty cool move, right Tony?”
“You know what?” Tony asked suddenly. “Let’s go out tonight, just you and me.”
Steve’s scent was in his nostrils and his taste was in his mouth. Yes, yes it was real.
“I don’t… I’m just so tired of being without you.”
The whole room felt… it felt off. Steve couldn’t put a finger on it, but it wasn’t something he was familiar with. It looked luxurious, and everything had some kind of sleek elegance to it, even the wooden easel in the far-end corner, but it all looked so strange—the whole, giant space, and Steve felt a cold shiver running up his spine.
Sam huffed. “Are you kidding me? Steve would beat me seven ways from Sunday if I’d let you get hurt.”
“Hey Steve,” Tony called, his robotic voice layered with a hollow echo as the words bounced off the stone walls. The room was small, then. Tony sighed and pulled off his helmet, before leaning his head against the dusty brick wall he was sitting up against.
you,” Tony yelled at him, but Steve—the goddamn bastard—was already up and running.
Steve just stood there, made motionless by the epiphany that was washing over him like waves in a storm.
Steve watched them go, his mouth likely still open.
“How did you change his mind?”
“If it’s permanent, then it’s permanent. We’ll deal with it.”
“You smell so good,” Steve murmured, favoring his throat with a long, amorous lick; his smile broadened when a breathy whimper escaped Tony’s lips. He nuzzled him a moment longer, then leaned back up. He was quite the sight, hair mussed and uniform top slightly tugged up above his pecs, pants pooled around his thighs.
Once settled, Tony released a half-groan, half-chuckle as he somewhat slumped down on Steve. His heat enveloped him wholly and Tony felt as if he could combust with the feel of it. He planted a firm kiss on Steve's lips, smiling against his mouth.
The suggestive tone didn't escape him—how could it?—and Steve only managed to stare at him for a moment. What even was this guy? Even with the oddly designed Van Dyke he had going, he looked very young.
“Please don’t make me stop trying,” Steve said, confirming every single thought running through Tony’s head. “If you… I won’t risk bringing you in danger, you
“Because it’s
“You won’t be
“Why not?” Bucky asked and pointed his thumb at Steve and Carol. “I don’t care. You’re gay. They’re bi. Whatever.”
His hand was embedded in the rock, and Steve had to brace his foot against the wall to jerk it back out. When he withdrew it, the fingers were bloodied. Slowly, he sagged against the wall. There was a subdued pain in his hand and wrist and his head was pounding. He hardly even noticed it. Steve fell forward against the stone, bracing himself on his elbows and dropping his head into his bruised hand.
"Tony, what—" he started saying, hoping he didn't sound too confused.
When he walked into his room, however, Tony stopped, raising a brow.
When Steve closed the door behind them, every cell in his body was attuned to Tony. He shifted and the movement rippled across Steve’s body. Tony was in his room—he was in his space—and the only thing Steve could think was that he’d never truly felt Tony’s skin beneath his fingertips or known the taste of his lips. Not in the real world.
When the world came crashing back, their mingled pants were coloring the air and they were curled together in a twist of limbs. Tony realized belatedly that his feet and hands were still digging hard into Steve’s body, his thighs cradling him, holding Steve near as Tony’s eyes slowly cleared and he remembered himself and let loose a little.
Steve didn’t hesitate. “Yes.”
Steve nodded numbly, barely hearing the words. “Jarvis?”
But Steve wasn’t listening. Without realizing it, his feet were leading him outside. “I’ll get him!” he called over his shoulder.
“I don’t think so,” Steve said, leaning up on his elbows and gazing down at Tony with a soft smile. “What you’ve done, the
“—a small compensation for losing everything else.” Tony willed himself to a standstill, turning to face Bruce completely for the first time since leaving Barnes’ cell. “What if we’re just handing him an existence that he’s never gonna forgive us for?”
Because even though God had cast Tony out of Heaven, He’d also made him the brightest of His angels.
"Excuse me," Steve said, waving the bartender over. "Do you have a piece of paper and a pen?" he asked, smiling pleasantly at the man. He handed over the items the next moment and Steve thanked him before turning his attention to them, jotting down a few short sentences to get himself focused.
. It was unthinkable. He had heard Bucky talk about love often, whenever he’d taken a fancy to some girl, but he hadn’t described the swelling feeling clamoring his heart. The way he felt he couldn’t breathe whenever he so much as looked at Mister Stark.
He really wasn’t.
At the end of the line, however, Steve was suddenly confronted with a pair of cold, unblinking eyes that drew his attention. They belonged to another elderly man, one with a bald head and a stone façade of prestige and self-importance. He held a long cane in one hand, with a black shaft and silver ornaments decorating its handle. There was some kind of orb on its top and Steve noticed him rotating it back and forth as he regarded him. While he held the cane firmly at his side, it didn’t look like the man depended on it as a walking stick.
“Me too,” Natasha said.
“You’ve drawn that before,” Mister Stark said.
He pulled back, trying not to stagger too much, though his balance was more shot than he'd realized. He cast Tony an apologetic smile when he felt a steadying hand on his arm. "Thanks," he said, watching as Tony eventually managed to call a cab for them.
Or well, he'd thought he was, but apparently not. Apparently all it took was some horizontal messing about with Tony Stark, and he was completely gone. And being referred to as Tony's boyfriend…
So instead of reacting to
Then, Steve’s pants were off and Tony pushed both his jeans and his briefs down. Steve groaned aloud as his cock sprang free into Tony’s hands.
[TStark] [chat_server:46953]
They both stared at one another for a good second longer, before they simultaneously reached for their Avengers communicators. Sometimes Tony really
intensive physical and tactical training program before joining my squadron.”
“You know
They did not talk about much of anything after that, but the silence was a comfortable one. Steve eyed the door to Bucky’s room. While there was nothing to be seen through the darkened glass, and yet, it felt like the ghostlike aura of the room had somehow spread through the whole hallway. It was disturbing, and he didn’t like it. That Tony hadn’t left Bucky’s room in hours, hadn’t asked for Steve once, didn’t sit well with him.
“Hi,” Tony said, and Bucky watched him grimace slightly at the awkward greeting.
And true to his words, Steve took his merry time. He knelt forward, teasing Tony’s chest with his tongue. And lower still until he was nuzzling at his cock once again. His eyes were glued to Tony’s face, and he watched him as Tony moaned and almost leapt off the bed every time his tongue swept around the sensitive head. His fingers teased him several times with the promise of penetration only to pull back. Only when Tony felt his thighs shake with the strain, did Steve finally have mercy and entered him with a thumb.
Steve looked down at himself, still trying to get his breath back from the transition. He noticed that he was still very naked. Closing his eyes, he took a moment to remember it—Tony’s smile when he’d kissed him goodbye—then, he covered his private parts as best as he could and cleared his throat. “I think it worked just fine,” he said.
Peggy had left only a few moments ago, and a part of Steve longed for her to hold him and keep the pain away, but he knew as soon as he closed his eyes, Tony’d be there. When he closed his eyes tonight, he’d be there. Tony would be there. Waiting for him.
There was a hand on Tony’s shoulders, then, turning him around fully so they were face to face. Steve stepped up closer, crowding him against the tractor, and looked him straight in the eyes.
Kissing had always been a full-body thing for Steve. He basically molded himself against Tony, their bodies fitting together so perfectly. His hands now cupped Tony’s cheeks, framing his face reverently as he familiarized himself with Tony again.
Something in Steve’s insides churned painfully, realizing that Ian might have, at some point, developed this distance to him, however minor it might be.
“Come on, Adonis.”
A long breath left Steve’s lungs. While Tony handled their departure, Steve had decided to talk to Mister Hammer himself. For better or worse.
With a few well-practiced movements, he dragged the light fabric off of Steve’s upper body.
“No,” Tony replied. “Not even after Natasha told him she and Clint were having flashbacks, too.”
“Sorry, just... give me a minute,” he said, shoving a hand beneath the covers and putting some pressure on his dick. He really was hard as nails by now, and it was the idea of Steve in all his Captain glory that drove him insane, sure, but it was also just lying here next to Steve, with him sort of dangling in front of Tony’s face like some enticing carrot that he couldn’t reach.
Even in the dim light, the various injuries marring Barnes’ pale skin were painfully visible. Bruce had removed his jacket, shirt, and boots when he’d brought him into the room yesterday, needing the access to those wounds on his chest. He’d cleared off the excess blood before he’d covered each of them with gauze.
He’d planned to stay on good terms with Steve, sure, but… growing so close to him hadn’t been on his agenda. Steve obviously couldn’t care much about him, otherwise he wouldn’t still be lying to him, right? Or—not lying, but he wasn’t honest with him either.
feel a lot like lover’s grief by now and also because the damn chocolate was delicious. “I planned to talk to him about it, it just didn’t seem the right time until now. We… Tony and I, we have a few big decisions coming up and…” He cleared his throat, meeting Bucky’s contemplative eyes. “I’m just not sure it’s the right time. Extremis is really helpful most of the time. And I know it’s important to him.”
It was only years of carefully practiced self control that stopped Steve from scrambling out of the bed in a feat of surprised shock. Instead, he made to disentangle himself from the sleeping form and lay flat on his back, his breath instantly rocketing into panic-mode as he waited for his arm to stop tingling, for his erection to subside, and for the gaps in his memory of last night to fill in completely.
Tony shook his head, trying to hold onto some measure of calmness, even as he felt the irritation within him rise. “You’re going to get yourself killed. Deliberately.”
So clubbing.
"Oh he loved me," he said, glancing at the still form on the couch. "I'm sure he'll be thrilled about the headache he's going to have when he wakes up, too." He sighed, and finally took the ice-pack from DUM-E. He didn't exactly need it, but it was a sweet gesture, and Steve sent a small smile at the robot. "Thanks."
How Steve ever managed to get Tony out of his tux without rendering it useless, he didn’t know. It was a fast, fumbling job—while Tony was busy peppering Steve’s neck with love bites that would fade within minutes. By the end of it, Tony was buck-naked as they were tumbling into the penthouse.
That got a small huff. “Yeah
“Because Carol is secretly a nerd,” Tony replied after a moment. “Because she knows the significance of this trip. Because
Tony moaned lowly. “Come on, Steve, can’t we just drive in silence like normal people—”
Tony sighed. And Steve squeezed his eyes shut while Tony rubbed shower gel into his skin, and shampoo into his hair, cleaning him from what was still left of the mission.
And he needed to say goodbye to someone else, which meant atop everything else, the day would be another trial on his mind.
“You’re welcome,” Tony said, then frowned. “Or will be. I guess.”
she didn’t say, but Bucky heard her loud and clear.
A trembling breath squeezed through Steve’s lips as Tony pulled his own t-shirt off of himself. Instantly, he lowered his hands to the skin Tony had revealed. He was aware that Tony was watching him closely, but didn’t care. His eyes were fixated on his chest—his chest that he could touch freely now.
talking about it. Just in Tony’s obscured way of beating around the bush until there was nothing of it left. “Yes, Tony. All girls.”
Steve shook his head, his expression troubled. “You can’t be asking this of me.”
“Your
That was the way they remained the rest of the night. Curled in each other’s arms. A few stolen moments they got to share on more than a superficial level—moments that, for Tony, nearly transcended human experience.
“Not as important as you,” Bucky said, and when Steve cast him a raised brow, he shrugged. “What? I’m just saying he doesn’t treat you right, not that he doesn’t love you. The guy is gone for you, I’m not blind. It’s the only reason I haven’t threatened to cut off his balls by now.”
Steve nodded, watching Tony’s back, recognizing the tension in his shoulders for what it was. Guilt. “Good point,” he said gently, because he knew they’d have to talk about Sokovia at one point, but this wasn’t the time.
Tony offered a small smile. “You should,” he whispered. “I said it, so it’s likely true.”
“Might as well start now.” Tony would rather get this over and done with. The morphine was rushing through his blood, making the dull ache fade into nothing and his head go even lighter, but Tony needed Extremis to finally get on with the healing program.
“Say I do it—go back in time,” he ventured. “What exactly do you want me to do?”
“God, Tony…” Steve breathed and he was looking at Tony as though he had just arrived home. As though the tunnel he had been walking through finally came to an end and he was there in the light.
A snort left Tony’s lips before he could even help himself. “Nope, no idea,” he answered, “you feeling anything yet? Headache, nausea, sudden tightness in your pants?”
Steve stared at him. There was… there was nothing to say—what could he say?
“Sure,” Tony mumbled, then remembered something. “Hey Brucie, do you know—uh… will Steve come over here again sometime?”

For a moment, Tony considered lying, telling everyone that they hadn’t even started planning yet. “We’re planning
“I hope you approve of the new decoration,” Stane went on. “These rooms were never used much before, except for occasional visitors. We were in a bit of a hurry to get everything done.”
Steve’s expression was very calm. “Time travel.”
With that, something clenched around Steve’s heart, and he stared at Vision with wide eyes. Did he really mean that? Steve had a hundred questions, and there were probably a million answers to each of them, but he figured the technicalities maybe didn’t matter.
“Okay, good,” praised and barely had the time to dodge before Tony came at him again. He did it again, and again, dishing out angry, uncoordinated hits at Steve.
Steve wanted to step in and kiss Tony when Dummy suddenly took off in a speed-roll across the room—and towards a different exit door. The move was so spontaneous that it took a few seconds for Steve to register in which direction he’d darted.
of liquor and convince his consciousness to let the world sleep for just a little while.
He’d agreed because it was the smart thing to do, even if his heart didn’t agree.
“It’s nothing,” Steve answered after a beat. “I’m sorry.”
He and Rhodey had arrived in Nepal half a day ago, and ever since, it felt like they were walking in circles. Strange was now the head of the Masters of the Mystic Arts and the official reason for their visit was to complete arrangements for the sorcerers to work together with the Avengers—or what was left of them.
She only shook her head, sighing. “I haven’t seen him since…” She stopped, taking a deep breath. “He asked for a room. To be alone.”
Gamora was yelling something as Nebula took the Gauntlet off of Thanos’ lifeless hand. Her boyfriend, or whatever they were to each other—Peter Quill—and her entire team all had to hold her back, so she wouldn’t step in the way.
After closing his eyes briefly, Tony looked at Steve again. And it was startling to realize that not being able to mend things with Steve would probably be his deepest regret.
“Think I could stay here for a while…” he murmured.
…” Tony persisted. “You did everything you could. You’re
“You’re bluffing.”
There was peace within him, then. Peace that Steve hadn't thought the world had to offer anymore. Peace that he thought had died in this stupid war between them. But here they were—Tony’s arms were around him, and he gave him peace. He looked at him with love that took Steve’s breath away. He infused his being with hope.
Tony licked his lips, trying for a small smile. “Morning,” he greeted quietly. “I’d say… don’t freak out, but that didn’t work out so well for me last time.”
“I’m not going to have sex with you,” he said slowly but firmly.
“I won’t… do that… with you,” Steve said, swallowing his tongue with how awkward he sounded.
“It will never be over, Tony.”
to keep himself from rutting against Tony’s leg, but deliberate or not, ever so often Tony’s leg would push upwards, pressing against him, teasing him to just give in.
"It's waving at me," Steve realized then, ignoring Tony's degrading words. "You made it yourself?" he asked, approaching the mechanical wonder. The arm lifted a little, then lowered, as if inspecting him, maybe measuring him up.
Wanda had single-handedly caused an international incident, thus pushing the UN to first discuss putting restrictions on enhanced people.
“Stand down, Avengers,” the voice said again, and this time, Tony was awake enough to recognize it.
Lunch? It took a moment for Tony to catch up, then he nodded absentmindedly, eyeing first Barnes then Steve, confirming his suspicions that Steve had shared at least
“Can we have you naked?” he asked, and he’d likely die if Steve was gonna tell him no now, but asking seemed like the polite way to go. “I really wanna see you naked.”
He’d dreamed of Tony lying in his arms. They had been outside, on some kind of balcony with the sea right beneath them. Tony had shifted on the lounger, looking up at him. There had been a soft and content smile playing with his lips when he’d told Steve that he’d be waiting for him forever, and he was stupid for doubting that even a second.
The thing was, Extremis was taking up a much larger part in Tony’s life than Steve liked it to do.
Tony said, and he knew Ultron could hear every word in their comm-line, but it didn’t matter now.
Panting and resting his hands on his knees, Steve took a moment to collect himself; then he turned around to stare at Tony—first at him, then down at his stomach. He obviously tried not to let it show too much, but the horror in his eyes was unmistakable.
, falling in love was so easy we barely noticed it happening.”
Tony bit his lower lip. “That’s what
Steve nodded. He fisted the material of Tony’s sweater and tore the cloth away, wasting no pleasantries before he reached for Tony’s cock as well.
“Talk to Nick,” Tony added. He forced a horribly fake smile to his face and cupped Steve’s cheek. “I get that you want to defend Bucky.” He paused, rolling his eyes when he realized that yes, calling him

JARVIS replied
Tony was retreating. The look on his face was… It seemed desperate, but how could that be? Didn't he want to stick around? To test if the antidote worked for Steve as well? This kind of behavior just didn't make sense. Unless…
They’d started the day late, staying in bed and watching all those stupid cartoons on tv while having breakfast. After lunch, which Steve had been adamant to cook himself, they’d driven around the city, visiting all kinds of New Yorker tourist venues like Coney Island or Empire State. After returning home, and having a very athletic round of afternoon-sex, they got ready for the big party, which was—despite all of Tony’s fears—a pretty amazing experience in itself.
The look of honesty on Steve’s face made Tony’s heart both swell and ache. “You’re right. Just, I don’t know, this feels like…”
"Doesn’t matter, anyway," Steve mumbled and drank a little more. “He’s gone.”
Tony smiled, a small little thing. “Some would call it destructive.”
Tony rolled his eyes, but softly blew against the flame until it died out, anyway. Steve had put so much work into the whole dinner, inviting all their friends, and even though Tony
“Ummm…” Clint offered unwaveringly. “Ew?”
And then everything blurred.
Tony looked up from his pancake. “Weird?” he echoed blankly. “Isn’t that the norm with him?”
“You won’t.” Tony smiled a little ruefully. “Well, not on purpose, at any rate.”
He didn’t tell Steve that part.
“I’m pretty sure your ‘bearable’ and my ‘bearable’ are two different things.”
His thoughts were always there with him, wondering if he was okay, if he had slept well that day, or what he was doing now that he wasn’t jogging in New York, playing with Ian, reading his history books, or doodling in Tony’s shop.
“Here we go,” he murmured. “ACDC, Kiss, ACDC, ACDC, Guns’n’Roses, ACDC, Pink Floyd… ugh, really?” He turned back around and raised an eyebrow at Tony. “Why did I not know you had the music taste of a fifty year old man?”
“Mm.” Tony pressed his cheek against Steve’s hair and they stayed like that for a moment, just luxuriating in the feel of each other. They did clean up a bit then—or Steve did, as Tony mostly lay there, watching him with lowered eyelids.
He didn’t sound exactly despaired, Tony thought, but the meaning behind Strange’s words was still painfully clear: They’d lost this battle. They hadn’t stopped Thanos in time.
“You don’t have to,” Steve said. “But Stane… Tony, he’s—”
Oh God, Steve’s life wouldn’t be the same after this. He was lost, addicted to the way Tony was looking at him right now.
Steve almost broke the pencil in half. He didn’t say anything; just stared at Bucky with wide unblinking eyes. “How,” he asked after a moment. Putting the pencil down on the paper.
Soon after Clarksville, however, the traffic became insane. There were hundreds of people everywhere, watching the sky, and others recording the event with their telescopes and cameras.
Steve nodded, and gently squeezed Tony’s fingers in return. “You alright?”
A breath left Steve’s lips. “Let go!” he shouted, and even from the growing distance, he saw Bucky struggling. Ultron was holding his metal arm in a firm grip, though, probably more interested in taking Bucky with him than shaking him off.
The idea was simply too overwhelming to grasp.
want to quit?”
Steve hummed, surprised that he could almost imagine it to be true. The idea of having Tony at his side throughout it all was… strangely comforting.
Steve was already apologizing and Tony was still busy fighting the incredibly bad impulse to dive in for seconds. Steve had
Tony shrugged, unapologetically. “There’s only so many ways to find out if someone swings your way. Showing some skin and seeing if you’re being ogled is one of the easier ones.”
“That’s my boy,” Steve whispered.
God, he missed him so much.
SR 3:45 A.M.>I'll be waiting. Thanks for the chat. GN8

“Steve—”
“Yes,” Steve said. “But this document just shift the blame.”
“That’s good,” Steve murmured as he swallowed down more. Definitely not the bitter brew he’d forced himself to drink on his last day on the front lines. A pang cursed through his insides at the thought of how he’d left things. He thought of Bucky and of the last things he’d said to Tony, and wrestled both down. “Thanks.”
“Yeah, me neither,” Tony said, burying his face in Steve’s shirt. One should think that the stress of the past weeks would catch up with him at some point. He’d slept fitfully, eaten too little, and been under constant pressure to get his projects done in due time to Obi’s crazy deadlines.
When he walked into the penthouse, however—ready to drop everything then and there and grab a quick shower—he was greeted with a sight he didn’t get to see all that often.
Steve expelled a deep breath, doing his best to ignore the way his heart clenched at Tony’s discomfort. Which wasn’t much. So he stood up and made to follow.
—this was exactly the kind of parent he didn’t want to be, he reasoned with himself. He wouldn’t be handing Ian off to someone else whenever things got difficult. Relying on Veronica was fine, but right now, Ian wasn’t feeling well, and he needed his father.
Tony sighed. Well, shit. No wonder Steve was shaking. In hindsight, he should probably have seen something like this coming.
Finally, with a moan of defeat, Tony opened his eyes and concentrated on the task of pinpointing the source of the sound and making it stop.
Fury remained quiet, and Tony could see it in his face—the damned bastard
“Yes,” Tony said. He glanced sideways. “You think he’s asleep?”
"I could stand here all night, just touching you, but I'm sure this isn't going to be enough," he said, his voice barely audible over the spray of water. "I'm not even sure what's going to be enough," he admitted over a short laugh, lowering his gaze, feeling genuinely coy. He hadn't meant to say all of that, but he wouldn't back down after the fact.
Steve nodded slowly. “I should’ve reacted better… I should’ve told you it didn’t matter. You just caught me off-guard, but… I’ve missed you,” Steve confessed.
A phone rang.
that,” Steve replied, his voice rougher than he meant it to be. He hadn’t had much time to talk with Tony after they’d merged the body with the Mind Stone and JARVIS’ matrix. Tony had set to repair Bucky’s arm immediately, and preparations for their final standoff with Ultron were well underway. And even so, he figured Tony wouldn’t really talk about it just yet. Knowing him, he’d need days, maybe weeks, to sort through the feelings for himself, before he’d eventually seek him out for consolation.
It was Natasha, and right behind her, Bucky. The second Steve laid eyes on their faces, he knew it was serious.
Bucky didn’t want to face him, but he couldn’t deny Tony this. So he turned around as well, staring at him.
"I'm…" he said, shaking his head again. "I'm sorry."
“Yeah!” Tony exclaimed. “It’s… well, I brought the supplies, and I kinda planned to cook for everyone, but it’s just…”
Tony grinned, couldn’t help himself. “You know… Laura will be so very pissed that I shot your balls off,” he said, then shot a pointed repulsor at Clint’s crotch, but it was too predictable, and Clint had no problem jumping out of the way.
He was swallowed in a sea of endless possibilities, and realized he had no idea which statement to answer first. He had words, now. Words to accompany the hope he felt every time Steve looked at him. He’d somehow felt it with every thrust, every moan, every delicious whimper. Steve wanted this, too, but now there were words, and Tony felt a wave of safety wash over him. It became a little easier to return to the ground beneath his feet, and to just voice what he wanted.
Steve heaved a low breath. “No.” He could barely look at the thing that spoke with JARVIS’ voice; that even owned his intonations. Whenever his tone was disapproving, or sarcastic, he sounded so much like the AI it physically hurt. Clearing his throat, Steve forced himself to stay focused. “Did Tony talk with you? About the mission?”
Natasha shrugged. The blankness in her eyes was beginning to unnerve him. She hadn’t put up that mask around him in a while now. “About two days.”
Steve moved forward, pulling Tony into a hug.
“Never,” Tony answered, the word slightly slurred. Being connected to Steve like this was most definitely one of his favorite things in the world. When he shifted, though, his knees throbbed uncomfortably, the pressure on his kneecaps was definitely too much and yeah… he wasn’t exactly twenty anymore.
Steve turned around at that, putting the razor down at last. Half of his face was already done, and he finally started to look like the Steve Tony remembered—not that weary, unkempt and strangely bearded guy that had arrived in the morning, here, at Tony’s very last safe house.
It was an isolated memory. It was something he hadn’t bothered remembering until now.
Tony rolled his eyes at him, before he walked further into the room. He approached the opposite wall almost reverently, and Steve felt a little thrill run through him as Tony squatted down and reached out to softly touch the canvas.
With a smile, Steve dropped a kiss just behind Tony’s ear. Then, he sat a hand over the arc reactor, and Tony put his own hand on Steve’s, caressing his knuckles.
“You can go faster,” Tony all but pleaded, moving his hips down to take Steve all the way inside, trying to regain some form of ground. “You can just… just take what you need. Whatever you want.”
The sight that greeted Steve when he summoned up the courage to face the room was enough to break the strongest of wills. Bucky was on his knees staring at the abandoned bed in front of him. He was still only wearing pants, his hair hanging messily over his face. He wasn’t moving, wasn’t breathing. For all intents and purposes, he might as well have been a statue. A stone figure reduced to his knees through his distress. Not an inch of his body flickered in recognition; nothing betrayed his knowledge of Steve being there.
Down in the garage, Steve opened the car door for Tony, ignoring his eye roll at the gentlemanly move. Then, he came around and climbed into the driver’s seat.
“For someone who doesn’t have any information, you’re surprisingly well informed,” Tony shot back, curling both hands into fists.
A bitter chuckle rumbled through Tony’s lips. “Right. We aren’t getting anything together. He obviously doesn’t like me. Not even enough to tell me what’s eating him.”
“Can’t shut him down via Extremis, maybe, but a direct link should work just fine.” With that, Tony’s eyes went black and he powered up the machine without even touching it. Sitting on a stool beside it, he strapped wristbands dangling on cables to each arm and placed the cap, also attached to the machine by cables, onto his head. It clipped itself in place with the blunt-ended pincers round its rim.
talking about his work, though, about machines he wanted to built, and things he wanted to invent, and it was all so far over Steve’s head, he could only listen to him in pure amazement.
Tony’s eyes softened a bit. “Sorry. I meant love me.
Chuckling despite himself, Steve shook his head and reached his free hand to tentatively take one of Tony's. He could tell, from his posture and the way his voice came softer, that the worst of Tony's anger was over.
“Well done, my boy,” he said, sipping his champagne.
Steve frowned. He guessed they were talking about the expedition that found him, but for some reason, he’d assumed it had been a SHIELD-issued operation. Apparently, that wasn’t the case.
“All right, fine,” Tony ground out. “Just take the picture.”
The sentimental part of him had always known that JARVIS was meant for more than being his robot butler.
“Steve, honestly, I’m nearing fifty, I’m…” He groaned and pressed his eyes close. Steve was nibbling and sucking and very expertly kneading his balls and just,
gratitude,” Tony shot back coldly, then shook his head. “You know what, never mind… Rhodey, let’s drive to that monument thing. I need fresh air, anyway.”
The guy that called himself ‘Red Skull’ killed innocents out there. And he planned something that could pose a real threat to the whole world. He’d made a career out of it, of sacrificing many to gain what he wanted, and evidently, it was just the start of something even more horrifying.
Tony sighed when a bad feeling rose inside his guts. “And when… was that?”
“Have you eaten?” Rhodey asked suddenly, reminding Tony, if only for a second, of Jarvis. “You look terrible.”
He knew, somehow, that that would be better. He didn't know how, but he needed it. Despite the remaining discomfort, Steve wanted to feel more. He closed his eyes again, concentrating, his hands grabbing onto the bedcovers for dear life, and then he opened his eyes again to look at Tony with as much conviction as he could summon.
Tony opened his eyes for a moment, seeing the light filter into the room. He had no idea what time it was, nor did he particularly care. He was at Steve’s side, and if he’d have any say in the matter, he would stay right here for as long as he could.
Entwining their fingers, Tony led Steve through the small corridor on the left and straight into the bedroom. Usually, Steve brought a small duffle bag with him whenever he stayed over night, but today, they’d initially planned to drive back to Massachusetts, and only decided to scratch that plan when one of Tony’s meeting had taken up about three hours longer than expected.
Steve offered a small smile. “Will do, thanks.”
, in more than one way.
Tony’s expression darkened even further. “You know what,” he snapped, and neared Steve like a leopard on the hunt. “For once, I completely agree with you.”
“Can you get Steve and Barnes out of here unseen?” Tony asked Phil, and he nodded.
“Who?” Steve murmured distractedly, while inspecting the room around him.
Steve could sympathize. He’d really thought Bucky was out of the woods, too, that it was finally over and that he’d regained control over his mind.
Hand in hand, Bucky and Natasha made their way towards the door and Bucky braced himself mentally for what was to come. He knew Steve and Tony had sort-of made up after Steve had travelled to New York, but the fact that Stark had simply turned up here all of a sudden… it could mean anything.
“It was… was one of the reasons Pepper left,” Tony admitted quietly. He cupped Steve’s ass and molded into him, moving against him in slow strokes. His eyes were glued to his face. And Steve watched back. His eyes were on him, and in that moment, he saw no anger. No hatred. Instead, he was Tony at his best. Tony watching him with curiosity, with a thirst of knowledge and a firm will to learn and understand.
be making use of Steve. He wanted… more than that, he realized a bit hysterically.
“Thanks, that’s good to know. But there’s this one thing…” He trailed off.
"Yeah," Tony replied after regaining composure. Just getting moved around like this, while Steve was very much buried in him to the hilt, was definitely... something. He let his head fall back against Steve's shoulder, almost going limp against him while brushing his nose along his cheek. "Getting manhandled might become a new kink of mine," he said, smiling, even as he pulled off of Steve's cock for just the slightest bit before moving back.
Steve leaned against Tony a little as he examined the schematic. “The reactor?” he asked.
“Try to remember that in a moment,” Tony jested, then walked over to the other end of the room, to some kind of container. He pressed a few buttons, then one of the lids opened and out came…
With shaky movements, Steve lifted his hips as Tony stripped the fabric of his pants down his legs. And then, for the first time in his adult life, he was lying completely naked in front of someone else. A man whose kisses still burned his lips. A man who lived in a whole other time.
As for Stark Mansion, the transformation was unlike anything Steve had ever witnessed. The building had always been a sight to behold, but now, it almost looked majestic: the gardens, the entry hall, even the kitchen. And although a part of Steve truly dreaded the ball, he still wanted everyone to enjoy themselves.
“Since when are we civilized?” Steve’s hands were tearing at the towel again, finally throwing it on the floor for good.
Tony was already drifting off, though, and after a few minutes, Steve got up and went to his bedroom. He didn’t move once he’d lain down, still fully dressed, only staring at the wall in front of him.
Steve was quiet for a long moment and he could almost feel the heat of Steve’s eyes burning into his back, and made himself lie very still. He remembered exactly how Steve’s mind worked and therefore he knew that—whatever Steve would say now—he was probably already thinking of a way around the rules.
“Are you saying I'm losing my touch?” Tony asked, grinning up at Steve. The music kept flowing, and even though most of the other guests had already left for the large balconies, they started to move.
The cell door opened, and Clint walked. Tony held his arm outstretched, aiming at Clint. If this new thing inside him knew anything, it was time to defend and shoot. Natasha stepped in the line of fire.
He should have heard her come in the house. The blood must have really put him deep under, his body must have needed a lot of repair. It had been awhile. Pulling himself out of the creaky bed, Tony headed to the bathroom and spent the next five minutes cleaning up as much as he could without taking a shower. Once done, he went downstairs to find not only Pepper and Natasha but also Thor and Bruce in the living room. An old style console television was on and the report discussed the current visit by Secretary Ross.
Bucky had said as a young teen that if he’d been an alpha he would have taken Steve as his omega. “No question about it. You would be it.”
Steve spies him with the corner of his eyes, looking not at the mountains and the beauty of nature, but at Steve. “I think it could be. A miracle, that is.” Steve doesn’t face Tony, only keeps his focus steady on the colors of the mountains as the sun begins to set to the west, behind them. It brings up the red and orange hues dappled through the rugged terrain.
Steve – that’s his name he knows it now – blinks a few times trying to calm the waves of doubt and pain. “You – you’re Tony.”
“Yes, Mer Rogers?”
Frigga calls out, not looking in any precise direction, “Heimdall!”
Steve smiles. “No one’s going to declare that I’m weak of mind or got any kind of Suicidal Melancholia.”
Tony sits up and he feels a little stiff, but a good kind of stiff. “Can I see?”
“With Stark Corp regaining so much of the power. We knew that,” Steve says. “But there’s more?”
“I, actually…” Steve stared down at his interlocking fingers, hands clasped together, closed to the world. “I was trying to get some sleep. Stark had left my apartment and riled me up a little. I’m not sleeping too well-.” He stopped. Bruce didn’t need to know everything. Unless, of course, he already did. “I tried to relax to get my head on straight. Anyway I started to drift off and the memory came back. I felt something through the bond and I knew I transferred the memory. I’m sorry- I’m so sorry.” Steve glanced over his shoulder again.
She tries one more time with the sharpest weapon in her arsenal. “What about Tony? You can’t do this to him.”
“You’re not doing well, Steve,” Natasha said. “Your soul is shattered. All over the place. Are you sure you can-.”
The gall is more than annoying. It’s absolutely insulting, but at the same time Tony’s strangely attracted to the man. “Well, you need training. You talk out of turn and without respect.”
He reaches out a shaking hand as Yinsen offers him the dented bowl. “Or what? They’ll feed me to the lion?” Though Yinsen hasn’t told him who it is that is holding him, Tony pretty much knows. It’s not rocket science (and for god’s sakes, propulsion is not that hard to figure out).
“Hell of a ride, Cap. Thought I was going to vomit in the suit. Not ready for prime time that’s for sure. The little nanobot fuckers want to do whatever they want, not working in synchronicity. Makes for a chaotic flight.” He reaches out and Steve catches his arm and reads the signal to pull him into a sitting position. Once upright, Tony turns to the side and spits a few times.
“Yeah. She was part of the mission.” He presses his lips into a tight line. “It was a shitty mission and we shouldn’t have been on it. But duty called and we lost some good men and women. It was fucked up. Sorry, but that’s the only way to describe it.”
“Yeah, welcome to the pack,” Tony repeated but he couldn’t take his eyes off of Steve.
