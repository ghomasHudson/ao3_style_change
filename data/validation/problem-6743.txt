The pair wandered for a while, Tony chatting and charming anyone who spoke to him. Stark Industries had many business partners and Tony was pretty much required to talk to every single one of the CEOs and representatives that he saw. After the fourteenth one, he started flagging.
“I’m fine, I’m nearly done healing anyway,” Steve told him, undoing his boots slightly, sighing softly and relaxing back against the chair.
Steve had practically moved into Stark Tower within the first two months of them being back together. It made sense for the Captain to be there, it cut travel time down, it allowed him to have more time with Tony. It just worked well. They got their routine back.
“It’s just one that SHIELD gave me, must be an update for something,” Steve mumbled back, ignoring the stares.
There was a well-groomed man stood off to the side who jumped into action when the pair came in, “Mr. Stark! It’s so good to see you!”
They did it though, the managed to collect the intel and destroy the base, leaving it a smouldering mess in the Swiss mountains. Steve didn’t like to admit he wrong, but it definitely wasn’t a solo mission, he was thankful for the backup.
SR: I’m sorry, but I personally believe the Avengers were doing good work, sue me if I’m wrong, I’m sure you’ve got the money to do so.
“Sure thing, you doing alright? You went dark a while back,” Steve shifted Natasha slightly in his arms, settling her more against his chest and shoulders.
Steve was persistent, he kept trying to open and download apps of all kinds. He was proud of the first app he managed to download which was a cooking one, it gave him recipes and the nutritional value of each meal, which he used nearly every day. He’d made all sorts: lemon chicken, minestrone soup, a lasagne, even a couple of cakes. It kept him busy when he wasn’t out avenging or travelling for missions. His army back pay meant he didn’t have to get a job if he didn’t want to, he’d thought about volunteering at the museum but maybe that was pushing his luck a bit.
Watching Tony dance in the kitchen, eating the meal he’s made, and seeing how the man smiles at his son does something to Steve.
“Mr. Rogers likes turkey sandwiches too. He eats his lunch with me when the other kids are mean and make me sit alone.” The soft voice is hesitant, a little hoarse from disuse but it’s definitely a child’s. Peter’s words leave Tony so shocked he almost drops the mustard. Instead he tries to hide his surprise for later and take the change in stride.
“I know some. I’m a fast learner,” he grunts, wondering why he opted to carry the bags himself when he has so many staff on hand. “After I received your email I started learning the basics. I think I have enough of a basis to develop on. Jay is gonna translate when need be.”
Tony smiles softly, a little broken as he struggles out of the AC/DC sweater, wearing only a soft gray t-shirt underneath. The glow of the arc reactor is intense without the thick sweater covering it.
“I, uh. In the email, you said he likes bugs, and the rainforest, right?” Tony tries not to fidget, to reveal how nervous he is that he had fucked up, done everything all wrong.
“Mary saw something in you Stark,” Natasha replies, finishing her coffee. “That means something. No good mother, no mother like Mary Parker would put their child in harm’s way.”
“It seems certain you would hardly make it a week, sir,” The fondly exasperated tone of the A.I. isn’t lost on Steve.
“Fuck, yes,” Steve groans, the thought of caffeine sending shivers down his spine as he and Tony untangle themselves.
“Mary Teresa Holland, 27, and fiance Richard Laurence Parker, 30, were killed when a sudden decompression event caused Richard to lose control of the personal aircraft he and Mary were in. Medical experts are unable to determine if the Parkers were killed on impact or before due to hypoxia. Police and field teams continue their investigations, at this time cause of death has been ruled as accidental. Family members are stated as saying Richard and Mary weren’t supposed to be in the plane that evening, and bring up Richard’s nearly fifteen years of flight experience. They are survived by their son Peter Benjamin Holland...” Pepper’s voice tapers off for the first time. A slight break as she tries not to dwell on the fact that a five-year-old child has suddenly had his life changed so much. “And Richard’s brother Benjamin Parker and wife, May.”
Tony curses himself for forgetting, remembers the letter Peter had brought home last week letting him know that parent teacher conferences would be happening in the first week of October.
And Tony is so thankful for every line of code he put into the A.I.—he’s always one step ahead and often senses Tony’s needs before Tony.
Bruce leaves first. He needs to get home and get some sleep. He has a sneaking suspicion that there will be several candy-high kids in class tomorrow and crazy kids sometimes have him seeing green. Clint goes next, making an offhand joke that living in Tony’s vents would be cheaper and nicer than his apartment.
Tony’s gaze is far away, drifting further and further into the distance as his finger lazily circles the rim of his cup.
“Right, Rogers. I’ll make sure to never bring celery, peanut butter and raisins into the proximity of your greatness again, Your Highness.”
“Yes. I’m Peter’s dad.” He smiles, noticing he’s still holding Steve’s hand, the other man hasn’t made to move away so Tony lets go. Noticing immediately how much colder he feels without that contact.
And the food Tony orders for dinner might be late too, because there is such a large volume and it’s Halloween night so he’s not the only person ordering out. But he might be the only person ordering thirty pizzas.
“You said Peter’s aunt? Is there a reason they didn’t get custody?” he is inquisitive; doesn’t want to take Peter’s best life away from him.
“So, uh—looks like you got them to bed?” Steve mentally kicks his own ass because there are a million words sitting on the tip of his tongue and those are the ones he chooses.
“Took S.H.I.E.L.D. t-two days to f-find me. I t-thought… I thought I was gonna die. We never found Buck.”
Before Tony can reply Natasha is calling for Peter. The young boy, Tony’s son, stumbles quietly back into the room. A large yawn contorting his sweet features as he looks to Natasha, lightly patting her leg to get her attention. When Natasha looks to him the boy moves his chubby open hand over his face, bringing his fingers together over his chin as he closes his eyes.
“Steve, honey bunches, can I touch you?” Tony asks. He ignores the excited flip in his stomach that occurs when Steve nods, ever so slightly.
Tony’s thoughts break right as Steve is trying to get off the phone with him. Voice still breaking, he still sounds like a child lost in a storm. Whatever they are Tony knows Steve means a lot to him. Steve means almost as much to him as Peter does. He goes to bed at night wishing Steve were curled into the bed with him. He makes breakfast for Peter wishing that he could be making breakfast for Steve as well. So, Tony does what anybody would do for a loved one in distress.
“Yeah, you did Steve. You called me. Why are you under the bed sweetie?” Tony keeps his voice calm, makes it soothing, the same way Rhodey used to do for him, the same way he now does for Peter on bad nights.
“Jaaaaay,” Tony stretches the A.I.’s name out, still not quite trusting his voice to operate at normal volumes. “Whothefuckisinmyhouseandwhydidyouletthemup?”
Slowly Steve sips his coffee, savoring the way the deep flavor mixes with the lightness of the cream, the sweet from the sugar. He breathes in deeply, slowly, letting the sweet aroma of the coffee mix with the savory, filling smell of the stew Tony is cooking. In the room over Steve can hear MJ and Ned respond to Peter’s signs speaking to supplement the signs they’ve learned for their friend. For a moment, he just takes it in. Steve lets himself live fully in the moment for the first time in so long. He lets himself experience the sounds, the smells, the tastes and sensations surrounding him. He can’t shut off his head, he still knows that there are three exits out of the kitchen (
“I-oh, I’m not sure, Tony.” Pepper adds three heaping spoonfuls of sugar to her green tea. Tony will never understand how or why she drinks her tea so sweet. “I’ll see if we can contact the head investigator?”
Tony’s already out of bed, pulling sweats on over the boxers he had fallen asleep in. He doesn’t bother with turning on a light, instead he gropes in the dark for the AC/DC hoodie he knows is somewhere near the foot of his bed because that’s where he kicked it off after spending all night in the workshop Thursday.
“Please stop staring, I’m already embarrassed enough, sugarbuns.” Tony’s voice is rough, groggy with sleep as he shifts.
“JARVIS,” Tony starts, hoping Pepper won’t have to work too hard to clear his schedule for the next evening.
Another moment passes, slow and Tony wonders for a moment if he is going to have to sleep under this bed with Steve.
“Do you want to talk about last night?” Tony’s voice is casual, no pressure for Steve to reveal his secrets, no annoyance at Steve for the cracks in his armor.
“Lamb stew over wild rice. Since you’re nearly an hour early you’re going to have to wait though. Need a snack? Coffee?”
The kids are dressed for the day but it looks like Tony might still be in his pajamas, clad in a pair of yoga pants and a soft blue t-shirt. Something about the outfit, slots Tony’s size into Steve’s brain. He’s only a few inches shorter, but he’s built entirely from lean muscle, making him seem much shorter than the 5’10” he actually is.
“He’s a good kid, only eats alone because of the sign language and he’s small. I don’t like bullies so I eat with him. It’s a small way to help.” Steve’s answering smile is beaming, Tony’s first thought is to compare it to the sun. To figure out a way to recreate it in the lab and make it a form of sustainable energy. “He invited me to a Halloween party you’re having?”
Steve watches as the kids hop off the counter and follow Peter out of the room. Suddenly, with just the two of them the air grows tense, awkward.
It takes a village, Tony quickly learns. It really takes a fucking village to raise a child. Maybe that’s why Howard was such a miserable parent. Because Stark men don’t admit their shortcomings, choosing instead to browbeat whatever it is into submission. When browbeating didn’t work Howard preferred to smack it into submission, and if Tony was on the receiving end of a slap or two, well, Howard just considered that collateral damage.
“Are like energizer bunnies and literally never stop fucking going? Normally Peter goes down easily. He has a routine you know? But when you mix him with his friends…” Tony trails off, adding some spices then tasting the contents of the huge pot in front of him. Tony moans softly in satisfaction, eyes closed as his head tilts back slightly, tongue darting out to catch broth as it tries to dribble down his chin.
Tony holds Steve, listening as he occasionally lets out a soft snore, watching as his chest rises and falls, evening out in sleep. Eventually he sleeps too.
“You’re the best,” Tony sighs, contentedly watching Peter top off his two scoops of vanilla, one scoop of chocolate with mixed berries, chocolate sauce and whipped topping.
“It’s what Rhodey and Pepper did for me…” Tony trails off, wrapping a golden lock around his finger before running his hand back through the man’s hair. “After Afghanistan. I had trouble sleeping. I had… I had nightmares and I would wake up in cold sweats. It had just started getting better when everything with Obie, uh, I mean, Obadiah happened. Rhodey stayed with me for two months after they found me. Pepper moved in until I felt confident I could handle the attacks. But there were so many nights… oh Steve, there were so many nights while Rhodey was here, while Pepper was here, where I would wake up screaming. I would clutch the arc reactor and gasp for breath. Pep would talk to me, sometimes she would sing. It doesn’t seem like it, but the woman has quite the voice. I’m lucky SI grabbed her and not Broadway. Rhodey would hold me, just, wrap me up and rock me back and forth. But that’s not new, he would sometimes do something like that after a bad meeting with Howard. What I’m saying, Steve, is that sometimes it gets the best of all of us. You don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to. But you also don’t have to go through it alone. If I can help at all, let me know how, please.” Tony’s voice is tight, he’s still running his fingers through Steve’s hair. With his spare hand, he doodles swirling designs on the exposed portions of Steve’s back.
“Well,” Tony sighs, checking his watch before turning to Steve. “It appears we are no longer needed. Peter has this under control. Want to run down and grab a coffee real quick?”
It’s nearly nine when they finally stumble into the penthouse of the Tower. The kids passed out in the car after stuffing themselves full of pasta and breadsticks at a small Italian restaurant Tony loves. Tony’s carrying MJ on his hip, Steve has Ned on his back and Peter in his arms. It feels domestic, following Tony through the home.
The silence becomes strained, there is so much Tony wants to say in response to that. He stops the words on the tip of his tongue because they’re cocky, dangerous and too much like the old Tony to be anywhere close to the right words to say.
Oh, and Steve. There’s also Steve who texts Tony at least once a day for the last two weeks to see if he needs any help. Who now sends him pictures or silly videos of him and Peter at lunch. Steve who still occasionally sends a doodled note home in Peter’s lunch box, especially on days when Tony and Pete make sure to pack him some food.
“Does Mr. Rogers like hummus too?” Tony looks to Peter, not sure if it’s a talk to dad day or not. Peter nods. “Alright, Pete, can you grab your bag? I think we will be leaving soon.”
“Don’t laugh,” Tony warns, voice far too serious to match the sly smirk on his face. “Rhodey bought me that mug three Halloween’s ago. Don’t make fun of it, my platypus is a serious man and might just fight you over it.”
Tony waits, giving Steve time as he sips his tea. One moment passes in silence, then two. Tony’s nearly finished with his tea when he finally speaks again.
With a slight jerk the elevator comes to a stop on Tony and Peter’s floor. Before the doors open Steve can hear the yelling of excited children, the slightly off beat clapping of little hands. The voices of Ned and MJ soar through the air, excitedly talking over each other, between singing the lines they know. He smiles to himself, the noise reminds him of his classroom.
“You’re a better man than you think you are, Tony. You’re an amazing man. I’m sure Mary saw that.” Pepper is on the phone, rescheduling Tony’s day, before the elevator doors close.
Barely a year later Stark Industries is no longer involved in weapons manufacturing, they’re taking over the technology market and are investing incredible support into medical research.
“More like I couldn’t stop thinking about what you might be cookin’.” Steve smiles, biting back a laugh at Tony’s indignant huff.
he still knows exactly how long it will take him to get from the chair he’s sitting in to the elevator (
Sweats and a t-shirt work for pajamas tonight. He crawls into bed more tired than he has been in years. His day has been emotional and nerve-wracking. Quickly Tony falls into a deep dreamless sleep.
“I show young Sir had increased smiles and serotonin levels throughout the night, Sir. It appears you are doing well.”
Happy drives them to Staten Island. The drive isn’t long, only 45 minutes. But the kids are restless, Steve is restless. After the fifth of Peter’s large sighs, and the Ned asking, for the tenth time at least, if they were there yet Steve is feeling uncharacteristically annoyed. He wants the ride to be over, to watch the kids run circles around him and Tony for hours.
“Okay?” Tony can’t help the shock that leaks into his voice. He had anticipated a little more struggling before Steve would consider coming out from under the bed.
When had they gotten so close together? Tony isn’t sure. He’s realizing, for the second time since the parent teacher conferences that Steve is several inches taller than him, a realization that sends electricity through his body. He is realizing for the first time how full Steve’s lips are. He can’t be one hundred percent sure but there is no way Steve was wearing those jeans when he got there. Because Tony has to recite the names of the original twelve Titans from Greek mythology, has to apologize to Jarvis, and has to think about the most complicated mathematical equation he knows before he can stop thinking about how nice those fucking jeans look. Steve is built like he was sculpted by the masters for an art exhibit.
“Are you okay?” Tony asks, voice laced with clear concern, noticing the emotions crossing Steve’s face, the tension in his shoulders.
“Call me.” She shakes Tony’s hand as she stands by the elevator. “Pete’s a good kid, a great kid really. If you need anything, if you have any questions, you already have my email and cell. Please reach out.”
That doesn’t mean Tony Stark won’t bend the laws when he wants, he’ll bend them until they’re near breaking when somebody he loves is at risk. Tony Stark runs two red lights and breaks the speed limits to reach Steve in a record 17 minutes. Arriving shortly before 3 am.
“None of our business, Ned,” MJ sighs. Steve swears the girl is only seven but already an annoyed teenager.
“I, uh—I’m sorry, about earlier… when I called this a date. I should have asked your permission for that. Or at least discussed it with you. I know… I know I wouldn’t want to go on a date with me after two days with no contact. So, don’t feel obliged, it doesn’t have too… i—it’s not a date if you do—“
The noise only increases when Steve steps off the elevator. He finds himself in the living room, music and voices drift in from another room. The smell of cooking food mixes in giving Steve a warm feeling of
They had gone to the store together over the weekend and grabbed everything they thought they needed. They had at least four metric tons of apples, apples for bobbing, apples for candying, apples for carameling. Tony had some poor S.I. employee ferry at least 100 apples up to the penthouse. They had grabbed everything Peter wanted for the goodie bags he would send his classmates and friends back home with. Little plastic bags with pumpkins on the front that held glow-in-the-dark bracelets, train whistles, neon sticks and other things that had made Peter smile. They bought a few board games and the set up for pin the tail on the donkey. Tony thinks they did so well.
“And what can I do for you my dearest Stars n’ Stripes?” Tony smiles, moving from the stew to the oven, checking something quickly before gesturing for Steve to sit down. “You had your snack, now would you like some coffee, sugar britches?”
“She wasn’t that bad, the papers make her out to be a blank person,” Steve told him, patting the top of Tony’s hand softly.
He steadily gets more confident with his comments, retweeting a few more articles about LGBT+ rights and showing his support for many of the young people who have been to marches and taken various pictures of signs and of the parade. Steve had tweeted and shown his support for every single person. He’d started going more political, calling various New York politicians out for their comments towards the Avengers and to people in New York. One politician tweeted about the problem of homelessness in New York and that he didn’t like seeing people sat in doorways. Steve promptly responded with: ‘if you don’t like it, fucking do something about it then. Start by not being an asshole and doing some good work for once in your life.’
The question caught Steve off guard. It was obvious he was fine, there’s never any question whether Steve was fine or not. It was a given Steve would be fine. Captain America was never not fine.
Tony was in the worst state than them all, armour falling off from various parts of his body exposing his ripped undersuit caked with blood. His hairline was similar, crimson dripping from his dark hair on to his tanned skin. He was limping on his right side, holding his helmet in his left hand, raising it ever so slightly when he was the trio heading back to the Quinjet.
Waking up felt like sitting up after being hit by a truck, several times over and over. The light hurt his eyes, the pain he felt in his chest was unparalleled. He slowly blinked the sleep out of his eyes, staring up at the ceiling and wincing as he breathed.
“You caused this, Steve. The minute you decided to keep your identity a secret from me. Y’know, I sit at night after I’ve finished work or I get a moment to myself and I can never get my head around it. Why did you lie to me?”
Steve played dumb when his phone buzzed, loud in the quiet room. He ignored the way Natasha looked at him, the smirk growing on her lips.
Tony was fine, his usual chipper self after a fight. He had a few bumps and bruises but he was fine, nonetheless. He had flown ahead, collecting the jet and landing not far from where the three were walking, announcing his arrival over comms.
Peter was quickly called back to work, leaving Steve in the quiet again. He looked down at his sketchpad, seeing Tony’s form come to life on the page. He took a drink of his coffee before pulling out his phone and dialling Natasha’s number.
Steve left his phone on the table, going to open the windows, letting himself breathe in the New York air when he heard his phone buzz, scrambling to grab, trying to ignore how pathetic that felt.
“Oh, you’re that Steve,” he nodded, “this is for you then.” He picked the parcel up, struggling with it slightly but refusing Steve’s help as he walked it into his apartment, setting it down on the couch, before wiping his hands on his black suit pants.
Steve never intended to spend as much time reading political and social articles on Twitter than he did. He’d read about strikes, government shutdowns, riots, marches. He’d ended up following a lot more accounts that all talk about the events going on in the world that the news didn’t cover. He still watched the news and read the newspaper daily, he bought it every morning when he’s coming back from his run.
“Yeah, stuff being the main products that you sell and make a difference in the world with. Don’t undersell yourself like that.”
Steve undressed, placing the first suit back on to the hanger, zipping the bag up before turning to the second suit. It was similar to the first one he tried on. Dark green with better fitting trousers but the jacket fell tight on his shoulders.
Clint spun around in his chair, “nice to see you, Cap, let’s go get ourselves some drug smugglers, huh?”
“You look dashing, but then again, you always look dashing really,” Tony smiled, then sighed with exaggerated force, “how do you always look so perfect?”
“Sure thing, honey, lead the way,” Tony answered, squeezing their joined hands, letting Steve tug him down the street.
Tony moved over to Steve, leaning his forehead against his chest. He was quiet, just their breathing and the sizzling of the pan to be heard.
Steve stopped at the bottom of the steps at Peter’s building, the boy hesitated before throwing his arms around Steve tightly, pressing his face into Steve’s shirt.
The third app he got was called Twitter. He had overheard a few people on the subway talking about it, something about a thread and that it was funny. No harm in looking, he thought to himself as he set his shopping down on his kitchen counter, taking out his phone and searching for it in the app store, putting his shopping away as it downloaded.
The hall was breathtaking. All crystal and golden. Steve was afraid to touch anything in case he broke anything. He said no to the offered champagne flute, telling Tony he didn’t like it, the genius just shrugging and sipping his own.
Sam’s attention quickly shifted to the kids behind Steve, asking if they were okay while Riley checked Steve’s knuckles for breaks, cleaning the blood off them with a tissue.
He heard a buzzing coming from his kitchen, leaving his clothes and heading into there before spotting the flashing Avengers beacon in on the counter. The date was quickly pushed out his mind, rushing to grab his gear and head down to be picked up by the black SUV outside the building, settling in for the ride to SHIELD.
SR: It was more about putting assholes in their place, but you can take it as an ego boost if you’d like to.
He ducked into the coffee shop one freezing morning, taking his hands out of his pockets and rubbing them together as he approached the counter. He smiled when he saw the kid, watching him bound over.
Heat flushed Steve’s cheeks, rolling his eyes and turning back to Gabriel who had just walked back in rolling a rack filled with coat hangers.
It took Steve a few hours before replying to Tony, trying to keep his hands steady before typing the message out.
The soft music filled the hall, the orchestra playing quietly at the back of the large room. Tony turned to face Steve, playing his hand on Steve’s waist and clasping their free hands together, smiling when Steve placed his free hand on Tony’s shoulder.
“C’mon, I’ll take you home, which way are you heading?” He asked, smiling when the eldest-looking told him Brooklyn, “I’m heading there too, my friends are waiting for me over there, let’s get out of here.”
Sam laughed as he came back over, “wow, Mr. Superstar, you’ve got yourself a fan!” He gestured back to the singer who was fanning himself while talking to the guitarist, glancing at Steve every now and then.
“Are you really amazed? You are talking to me, honey,” Tony laughed, squeezing Steve’s knee gently before moving his hand back on to the gear stick.
The comments overwhelmed him a little, he was sat quietly with a cup of coffee reading through the support, ‘what a hero’, ‘A TRUE TRANS ICON’, ‘fuck get me a man like that’. There was some hate, there always is, but there’s more positive than negative.
The Captain took a few deep, steadying breaths before tugging his red leather gloves off, folding them over his knee. He knew Stark was stubborn, he’d always been like that, but he usually did the right thing in the end and actually listened to Steve, listened to the plan as a whole. When Tony Stark got something into his head, it was hard for anyone to shift that idea from him.
“I’m amazed that even Tony Stark forgets the days of the week, you might want to look over those,” Steve smirked, leaning back in his chair.
Tony woke up around an hour later, jolting himself awake and wiping fresh tears off his face before his eyes found Steve’s face. Before Tony shut off his dazed look before his gaze turned to stone.
“This is my usual, all the staff know me,” Tony explained as he headed up to the counter, leaning on it slightly, “hey, Pete.”
Steve watched Tony dodge a mother with her children, easily slipping past and heading over to him, a grin on his face.
He didn’t like to think it was his smooth voice or his cool demeanour that got to Steve, but he was only human.
“Stark’s meeting us there, said he’s updating his scanners or something, I tend not to ask about all the tech stuff but figured you’d wanna know,” Clint called back to him, flicking a few switches on the panel above his head.
“Nice to see you again, Cap,” she watched him until he stopped next to her, not letting him return the greeting before she turned and headed into the jet. He watched her head in, following her in.
Moving on didn’t work but just getting through each day was enough. Being numb was okay as long as he managed to get through what he needed to do. He could work with numb.
Steve let his eyes fall shut, making a soft noise against Tony’s lip as he pressed closer. He let his mouth open slightly as Tony ran the tip of his tongue along Steve’s lower lip, moaning quietly which the billionaire quickly drank in, pressing himself flat against Steve’s front, his hands running up Steve’s lapels, Steve’s hands making their way down to Tony’s hip, tugging ever closer--
He was amazed to see a video of himself on Twitter that night tearing down flags and shouting at Nazis, the caption on the original video wrote: “A true American hero” and Steve felt insanely proud, the video had nearly 25,000 retweets and thousands of comments supporting him. Some of the comments complained about him taking peoples right to free speech away, but he didn’t care about those comments.
Steve didn’t reply as he ate breakfast, he kept the screen on the message, washing his dishes and humming a song he’d heard on the radio the other day. He kept himself busy, reading the paper he’d bought on his morning run and going through each section meticulously, ignoring his phone to his absolute best until it buzzed again. Steve sighed through his nose, setting his paper down and picking his phone up, showing another message from Tony.
They finished the exhibitions in a few hours, chatting about anything they liked and the ones they didn’t understand, mostly on Tony’s part. Their hands were joined the whole way; Tony would squeeze his fingers when he saw something of interest or something that he thought Steve would like. Tony talked with his hands; waving his free one around as he spoke, tugging their joined hands if he needed added effect.
Missions weren’t fun, they just passed time that Steve seemed to have an abundance of. It was like clockwork for him: go in, get done, debrief, go home. He repeated the cycle every time he heard the little Avengers beacon go off. Every time his heart leapt in his chest with the idea that he could be seeing Tony again. And every time he was let down when the red and gold armour never showed up.
He came back to his phone roughly an hour later as he was heading to bed, picking it up and carrying it into his bedroom, scrolling through his notifications before stopping in the doorway, clenching his phone.
The conversation had struck a nerve with Steve. He knew what he was doing was wrong, he knew he had to tell Tony but he couldn’t lose him. Not after finally getting past Tony’s exterior. Steve just didn’t know what to do. He had to tell Tony before it got out in a way that Steve didn’t like.
The four teens, Steve now knew as Peter, Gwen, MJ, and Johnny, were all extremely thankful for Steve, thanking him and confiding in him about their fears that something like that would happen.
Steve frowned as he read it, keyboard warriors? He closed Twitter and quickly opening Google, typing the phrase in and reading through some of the searches.
Contrary to what he says he doesn’t pull away, instead he snuggles in deeper, throwing an arm over Steve’s waist.
“It is nice to finally put a face to the name of the infamous Mr. Rogers my son loves so much,” Tony chuckles, looking to Peter whose cheeks blush a slight pink. “I think you’re his first or second favorite teacher. Does that sound right Peter?” Both men look to the blushing boy, who nods and begins quickly signing.
When Steve looks up from his coffee, unable to watch the steam rise any longer he notices how close he and Tony are. Saying there’s an inch between them is generous in the moment. Tony’s standing barely a hair away from Steve, dark eyes staring up at him through long, elegant lashes. Steve’s struck by how Tony’s eyes aren’t brown, not in the traditional sense. They’re amber, the stunning color of whiskey as it’s poured into a crystal glass. The shorter man’s lips part, elegant and pink. Raw in one spot from where he worries it between his teeth.
Steve remembers reading about it. Tony Stark missing, months pass. His mentor and father figure Obadiah Stane supporting extensive searches for the man. Only for Tony to appear three months later, rising like a Phoenix from the ashes. Literally, the terrorist group holding him wanted weapons. After torture Stark does build a weapon, but not the weapon they’re seeking. He builds a suit of iron that he uses in his escape. Tony blows up their illegally obtained StarkIndustries weapons, making a fiery escape.
The coffee is overpriced but good. Steve holds his cup firmly in his hands, breathing in the aroma as deeply as possible. The smell grounds him, the warmth that radiates from the cup, through his fingers, up his arms and intro the rest of his body is so welcome. November in New York is a chilly time, Steve can never quite keep the chill from soaking into his bones.
“Sir,” the returning voice is dry, almost deadpan. “The children are still in deep sleep, like I told Mr. Rogers. Best estimates show they will likely be up within two hours.”
“Never leave me,” Tony chuckles, quickly pouring his coffee into a to-go mug so he can take Peter to school.
Peter’s eyes shoot up, connecting with Tony’s for a moment before his hands start flying across his face and chest. Tony is thankful for his quick brain as he takes in Peter’s words and connects their meaning.
Peter speaks off and on, never saying much when he does speak. Tony gets slightly more used to hearing his son’s voice. It’s been two weeks since the last time Peter spoke. This time it’s Friday and Tony is making Peter’s lunch. A crispy chicken wrap on a jalapeno cheddar tortilla, spinach, ranch and asiago cheese. Hummus with broccoli florets and carrots for his side.
Tony had a team come over the previous weekend to childproof the house. Sockets are now plugged, gates put up and JARVIS updated on how to help keep the kid safe. They have covered the penthouse as well as the two floors below it, in case Peter found himself down there. Peter’s room is done entirely by Tony though. He spends 32 hours and 47 minutes designing and perfecting the room.
“Firefly?” Ned suggests. He’s already building a huge sundae, base made of three different ice creams and sliced bananas.
“Sir,” JARVIS’ voice rouses Tony. One of the rare nights he actually makes it to his bed. “You have a caller.”
“I jus’… I saw how mean and cruel people could be. I didn’—I don’ like bullies, Tony. I got in so many fights. An’ I got my li’l ass hand’d to me more times ‘an I could count, but I found my best friend that way,” Steve trails off for a second, lifting his head.
He starts by putting a bunk bed almost in the center of the room. Then Tony adds legs to make it look like a spider, Peter’s favorite crawly creature according to the email Natasha sent. The sheets on the top bunk are a plain white with a basic comforter on top. But the bottom bunk, the one Tony assumes Peter will be sleeping on, is decorated with bug-themed sheets, a blue and red comforter and bug pillows. In the center of the bed is a black widow spider plush, one Tony bought on a whim. The rest of the room is rainforest-themed. In the corner, a ‘canopy’ of leaves branches out over two full bookshelves, and a lime green and blue sleeping bag rests between the two shelves.  A little reading nook—something Tony thinks he would have loved as a child. Across from that is an ‘art’ station. Tony puts up a small easel and a table with various craft materials. Something he can use to be creative. A small t.v. and game console take up the last available corner, just leaving a large chest full of toys a few feet inside the doorway.
Lunch is amazing. Every bite of stew mixes perfectly with the rice pilaf Tony made. He pulls out warm, homemade bread (‘a surprise for you, Stevie-kins, the kids and I… we thought you might like it’) and it melts in Steve’s mouth.
With a gesture of his hand, from chin out, the boy toddles off. Little legs quickly moving from the room.
“Oh,” Tony whispers, Steve’s words sweeping the ground from under him, stealing the air right from his lungs.
The soft smile Natasha offers him is comforting. Maybe he is going in the right direction. The rest of the quick elevator ride is spent in silence.
“I need three children’s tickets and two adult tickets please, one for me, one for my date,” Tony asks of the young lady, gesturing to Steve.
Tony opens his mouth, words on the tip of his tongue, before they’re off. Peter drags MJ and Ned behind him. He stops at every glass case, explaining in detail what he knows about the insect inside. He continues using the mixture of sign and speech when talking to his friends.
The next song starts, a beautiful orchestral sound filling the kitchen as Tony plops MJ back on the counter. Before boogying over to his son. As the beat slowly starts to pick up Ned begins banging on a set of pretend drums, Peter starts air guitaring as Tony sings the first words of the song into the ladle he’s been holding. Watching Tony like this, care-free and smiling, makes Steve’s heart full.
156 seconds. He can’t turn his brain off, not since his time in the service and not since the string of missions that earned him his honorable discharge. But he can have this, the sounds, the feeling of being home, the quieting of the voice in his head always cataloguing exit routes and forming escape plans.
They had forgotten candy. He has candied and caramelled apples out of his ass but not a single Snickers, Kit Kat, or Milky Way in the area.
“Well, I’m glad. Halloween is your favorite holiday then, Pete?” Tony asks, bringing their plates over to the dinner table.
“I wrote a list last week and had everything delivered, ensuring you will have enough Sundae Sunday materials for at least ten people, sir. You should be covered.”
“Do you know any sign?” Natasha questions as soon as Tony greets them, forgoing pleasantries. She’s gathering Peter’s small frame into her arms, while Tony grabs the few bags in the trunk of her car.
“Yes Tony,” Steve smiles, cutting the man off before he goes on a thirty-minute rant. “I would love to go with you, Peter and his friends. Where should I meet you?”
Tony grapples for his phone, reaching onto his nightstand, hand moving aimlessly in the dark as he tries desperately to locate the device that’s still singing to him.
“He’s your art teacher?” Peter nods, stepping onto the stool in front of the sink. “Well, I’m glad he sits with you. We should thank him shouldn’t we Pete?” Tony waits while Peter finishes washing his hands, little brows furrowing together in the middle as he concentrates on ensuring that his hands are clean. He steps down from the sink, dries his hands and nods.
“He told me.” Bruce smiles, it’s soft and comforting like everything about the man. “He’s excited, you know. He knows how hard you’re working to make this a great party. I think that means more than if everything goes according to plan.”
A soft tap on his leg lets him know Peter is ready and would like his attention. He looks down to see the boy smiling, holding a few of the treat bags he and Tony put together as thank yous for his teachers.
“Are you going to take him?” Pepper asks, and Tony’s heart clenches again. They’re discussing it so casually. Tony, being a parent, Tony having a child dependent on him. “You’ve changed, you know.” It’s not a question, Pepper is observant, one of his closest friends. Only Rhodey knows Tony better than Pep.
Tony pauses, observing the slight shake of Steve’s head before slowly approaching the table. He gently sets the tea in front of them before sitting next to Steve.
He thinks, for a moment, he might be able to understand where Steve is coming from, the pain he would feel if Rhodey died while trying to save him.
“His aunt says he’s always been reserved, soft spoken, but he hasn’t gone weeks without talking according to her knowledge.” Natasha slips him a soft look, Tony gets the message. This conversation can wait until later.
They’re nearly three hours in when Steve sees the kids sagging. They’re ricocheting off the walls instead of actively bouncing. No longer full of the same energy. That is until they walk into the last room of the day.
“Thank you so much for that,” Tony mutters quietly, almost more to the floor than the art teacher in front of him. “Pete’s had… it’s been a rough few months for him. We are still settling in after his mom--” Tony pauses, not wanting to bring Mary’s death up in front of Peter but having gone too far already. “After everything happened.”
“Jay, why am I up?” Tony’s words are still muffled his head remains pushed into the pillows. He thinks maybe if he doesn’t allow the sunlight to touch his eyes then he won’t have to give in and wake up.
Finally, Tony thinks as he locates the godforsaken phone. He answers quickly, briskly. Because Peter is having a fun weekend with Ben and May, Tony went for drinks with Clint this evening and he can’t hold his fucking booze like he used to and he just wants to go back to sleep.
He stuck with me through all’a it. Middle school, high school. Going from a tiny nobody to this guy on the football team. Stuck with me when I came out. Threatened to fight any sonovabitch who thought bein’ gay made me wrong or disgustin’.
"Sir, I can assure you Colonel Rhodes and Ms. Potts aren’t in danger.” Tony releases the breath he doesn’t know he started holding.
The use of one of Tony’s favorite pet names seems to breathe a little life into Steve, he uncurls slightly, sitting up a hair straighter in his chair before grabbing the lukewarm tea in front of him.
The shop Tony stopped outside of looked too high class. Steve spotted one of the price tags from the passenger seat and nearly passed out right there.
It was Sam that had told him about the pride parade that happened every year in New York. They’d just finished a run, sitting down in Central Park to rest when he brought it up.
The fight lasted longer than Steve thought, more and more portals opening when the others closed. The flood of Chitauri just kept coming, their cries ripping through the air as Steve fought, shield staining black with blood and grime.
They just stood smiling at each other for a few seconds before Steve cleared his throat quietly, “shall we head in?”
“That’s okay, kiddo, I’m sure Steve loved protecting you,” Tony ignored the boy’s protests and bright red face, turning back to Steve, “do you know what you wanna get? I recommend the Americano and the carrot cake, but it’s up to you.”
I’m so glad you got a hold of me. I can set up a time for Peter and I to meet with you again? I’ll attach the documents so you can review them before we get with the lawyer to make things official. If you have any questions please contact me at my personal number. 555-560-3314.
“Everyone doing okay? I can play nurse if people need me to,” Tony called over his shoulder, allowing JARVIS to take over via autopilot, carrying a first aid kit back into the open area behind the pilots' seats.
SR: I love art, I haven’t been to that one before, it’ll be fun. Say meet there around 11? We can grab lunch too?
They got settled, Tony taking his black coffee from the tray and Steve taking his Americano, leaving the cake between them. The cafe had a nice light, the sun streaming in from the large windows, shining on the pair of them.
The ride didn’t take too long after he’d finished the file, setting it on the seat next to his and unclipping his seatbelt, heading up to the front of the jet, hand on the back of Clint’s seat.
Steve sighed heavily while pinching the bridge of his nose, letting his shoulders sag, glancing at Clint and Natasha who quickly looked away.
Steve didn’t know what time he woke up, but he knew Tony was next to him, cuddled against his side. He didn’t need to know the time. He just needed to stay in that moment of pure peace with him. The man he loved.
Tony tucked his hand into offered arm Steve gave him, leading him on to the carpet, passing his keys to one of the valets there, thanking him quietly. The warm summer air was pleasant.
Steve mumbled his thanks as he got Clint and Natasha on to the jet, limping on after them and collapsing down into one of the available seats. He pulled his gloves off, laying them over his knee and closing his eyes, leaning his head back, ignoring the swooping in his gut when the jet took off again.
But that’s the thing, it was Tony. Tony Stark, and all his ways of making Steve lose his head, whether that was on a mission, or like right now, sat in his apartment waiting for Tony to say something back like a teenager who’ve just told their crush they liked them.
“It’s not your business, Widow. I’ll tell him, I just.. I don’t know when I can. I don’t know how I can. He hates me.”
He wore those black jeans Sam picked, a white t-shirt and his blue bomber jacket, a pair of brown boots on his feet. The clammy feeling in his palms and the butterflies in his stomach had been there for the past week. At this point, he didn’t try to deny his nervousness, he’d texted Sam telling him he was getting coffee, smirking at his phone when Sam wished him luck, told him to keep it PG.
Steve turned round to get a glimpse but that’s all he got. The sight of the man leaving the room, in the same suit as he saw him a few weeks ago. The echo of his footsteps in the corridor. It still hurt, but he had to live, had to move on. He knew when he wasn’t wanted.
Steve recognised the boy instantly, the boy looking at Steve and his smile getting even bigger if that were possible.
Tony stayed quiet, keeping his gaze fixed on the windows. He sighed, letting his shoulders sag before turning to look at Steve.
A few months passed and Steve was getting bored, he hadn’t been called up for any missions, Natasha contacted him and told him to take some time off for a while, but that was all Steve did between missions.
Tony looked over at him, the sun shining on his handsome features, his mouth slightly open to respond before the waitress came over and asked for their orders.
“We’ve got trouble, Cap! Looks like they’re using some kind of portal! They’re just pouring through it!” Clint yelled back to him, setting the jet down in an open area, filing out with him and Natasha.
“When I say keep a perimeter, I mean it, Stark! You let some of them slip away and now we’ve lost SHIELD’s element of surprise!” Steve yelled, keeping a tight grip on his shield and jutting his chin out slightly, glaring at the other man as the armour practically dissolved around him, slipping up into the centre of the glowing arc reactor in the centre of the man’s chest.
Still, in the back of his mind, he had the thought that he was wrong for doing this, that he was a horrible person for not telling Tony who he really was. It kept him awake at night, should he tell Tony or just wait until he figures it out? For a genius, he really was clueless sometimes.
He ran his hands over his face, feeling the slight beard that was growing under his fingertips. He’d need to shave before he went to the gala. SHIELD told him he wouldn’t be called up for duty for a while to give new recruits a run in the field, Scott Lang and Hope Van Dyne being called up for SHIELD. Steve knew the world was in good hands when he met Hope, he was reassured by her she kept Scott on a short leash. Steve was quickly put at ease.
“You’re fucking one of them too, you dirty fuc-” he couldn’t finish the sentence as Steve’s fist collided with his nose, sending him flying back on to the platform ground.
It was another passing glance. That’s all Steve seemed to get from Tony, passing glances and watery eyes.
“Funny, beautiful and talented? I think I’ve hit the jackpot here, honey,” Tony grinned, setting his mug down and sitting down at the breakfast bar and digging in.
Steve then realised if he told Tony what had actually happened, then he would basically be telling him that Steve was Captain America. What was a good enough lie?
“Y’know, you could announce you’re back and use it to just promote movements and issues around the world,” he told him, looking up from his tablet.
He was lectured. Don’t do this, don’t do that. Steve was sick of listening. He was sick of all the advice, of Natasha’s sympathy, of Sam’s effort to console him. Just sick of it all.
He frowned as he read the article, rolling his eyes at phrases like ‘secret relationship’ and ‘questionable sexuality’. Steve knew he couldn’t take articles like that seriously, Tony would probably find it funny if anything. So he sent it to him.
Tony met him halfway, fingers tangling with Steve’s, letting himself be pulled against Steve’s chest. He pressed his face against the soft fabric of Steve’s shirt, finally letting himself cry. Steve held him tightly, wrapping his arms around him and keeping close. He pressed his lips against Tony’s temple, whispering “I’m so sorry” over and over until he felt Tony stop crying until he felt the other relax in his arms.
The repeated use of ‘honey’ sat with him. Tony didn’t know him, was Tony always this sweet with people? Maybe not sweet but.. different. Steve had only ever seen the Tony Stark that was encased in Iron Man. He had never seen the inner works of Tony Stark, never the man out of the hard shell he flew around in. Steve had never really met just Tony, not Tony Stark, just normal Tony. Maybe this was him?
Steve settled back in the chair, closing his eyes and taking a few deep breaths when the jet set off, that was something he would never get used to, the pressure in his chest when the jet roared off the runway.
TS: Speaking of Avengers, there’s a charity gala coming up soon, I was wondering if you’d like to come with me? I understand if it’s a little scary but you’d be with me!
Steve took his hand, squeezing it gently and blinking when Tony slipped a bracelet over his wrist. It was a leather band, simple but attractive against his skin.
He hung up, glaring down at the phone before looking back up at Steve with a tired smile, “sorry, honey, looks like I forgot about an important meeting where I’m supposed to sign a bunch of stuff to allow the company to function.”
“Alright, time for bed I think.” Tony sweeps Peter out of the tub and dries him quickly. He helps the boy into his pajamas and combs his hair.
“Hey, MJ,” Tony cajoles, setting the girls feet on the floor but not letting go of her weight. “You gotta get ready for bed, kid. You need jammies on and to brush your teeth.”
Steve’s exclamation nearly stops him, causing Tony to pause for a long, tense moment as he interprets the situation before resuming his activities.
“Thanks, Steve, that-” Tony pauses, watching the ground, feeling like a teenager instead of a 27-year-old man with a six-year-old child and three PhDs. “That means a lot. I was worried.”
A warm hand is placed to Steve’s bicep and he’s cold, so, so cold. He tries not to, but he leans into the contact fully, craving the warmth of another person. Craving the warmth of Tony who seems to hold the power of the stars in his soul.
“Scan, Jay,” Tony mumbles into Steve’s neck, breath ghosting across his skin, causing the hair on the back of his neck to stand on edge. “Gimme an estimate on how much longer they’ll be asleep.”
“Well…” Steve drawls into his phone, settling back into the warm comfort of his blankets, now that he knows Tony doesn’t need him for an emergency.
“Tony,” the brunette is surprised to hear Steve’s voice. He thought the older man had drifted off to sleep as soon as the heated blanket was draped over him.
A small hand grabbing his distracts Tony from the growing weight in his stomach as he watches Peter’s classmates bob for apples, snack on the candied and caramelled treats, and even play in Steve’s pop-up cemetery.
“I’m afraid it’s the only way to make up for the cold shoulder,” Steve pauses for a beat, then adds. “And the most delicious.”
“Served for six years ‘fore we were offered positions in this organization, S.H.I.E.L.D. ‘ts like special ops, but more special. Buck loved it. He was a good sniper, I was good in hand to hand. Three years later S.H.I.E.L.D. sends us out on’a hell of’a mission. Stuck in the mountains of somewhere outside Germany. I dunno, they didn’t tell me that, just who to hit.
Tony pours his coffee, shoulders hunched and takes a few deep shuddering breaths, knowing their arrival at the tower could only mean one thing, but needing to hear it.
All too soon the elevator dings and the doors open to the third floor. They pull apart, Tony’s eyes are wide, pupils dilated so much Steve can hardly see the starling amber color. His lips are parted and swollen, pink and begging to be kissed again. Steve doesn’t realize he’s staring, still leaned into Tony’s space until the shorter man clears his throat.
As always, the adults are surprised to hear Pete’s voice. He only speaks rarely, in situations he’s comfortable in. Peter’s spoken more today than Steve thinks he’s heard the boy speak in the time they’ve known each other.
“Art.” He swings his little feet and finishes his orange juice. He folds his little hands together and makes like he is scrubbing his hands, Tony’s signal that he is done eating and is ready to be helped down from the bar stool where he’s sat for breakfast.
“Mr. Stark—” the voice is short, clipped, feminine but professional. Much like Pepper when Tony pretends he doesn’t understand what she needs, or when he accidentally-purposely forgets about a meeting he just has to attend.
“Well,” Tony clears his throat, sensing the conversation won’t be moving further unless he pushes. “Our tea is cold, but it seems like you’re feeling better… do you want to try and get some more sleep? It’s almost seven, but it’s a Saturday. I figure you can let yourself sleep in.”
He takes in the large king-sized bed in the middle of the room. Matching lamps and nightstands on either side. They’re simple but distinctly Steve in their warm, vintage feel. The sheets are mussed, pulled half off the bed as if Steve didn’t fully wake before diving out and under. Pulling half of his bedding with him.
No, Tony is completely unprepared for the 6’2” of blonde-haired stormy sea-blue-eyed Adonis that smiles brightly at his son before turning to him. He doesn’t expect the way the baby blue button up pulls distractingly tight across his chest and compliment his eyes, or the way the khakis hug his hips and legs in all the right places. Tony never thought he would have to say the ten commandments backwards, in a grade school, because of a pair of khakis. Khakis for god’s sake.
Moving slowly so he doesn’t startle the man, Tony speaks again, into the silence. “Stevie, babe, it’s me. It’s Tony.”
Mary had put the child support to good use, making sure Peter attends a great school with small class sizes and prestigious teachers. The school focuses on the student’s development and less on standardized testing scores and curriculum. There is a different teacher for each subject and no shortage of TAs and paras to help the students long.
“Yeah,” Tony laughs and Steve wonders for a moment if he’s ever heard anything as beautiful as Tony’s soft, breathy laugh. “You were right. We played the lava game for twenty minutes before they basically fell like flies. The best idea. Thank you again, I think I was about ready to tear my hair out.”
Steve doesn’t linger on Tony’s friendship with Bruce. The two scientists are the most brilliant men in whatever room they’re in. It only makes sense that they bond fiercely and quickly. He also knows that Tony’s been out to dinner and drinks with Clint at least three times since they met at conferences.  Instead he says the first thing that comes to mind.
is all Steve can think as he takes in the large room. To his left there are three walls almost completely counter space, there is room for Tony’s many appliances plus some. A small break in the counter space on one of the walls houses the refrigerator, and the oven. To his right the room opens into a spacious breakfast nook. In the center of the room sits a large island, a glass top electric stove on one side, a sink in the middle, with additional counter space on the other side. Ned, MJ, and Peter are sitting on the counter side of the island while Tony cooks on the stove top.
He observes Steve as he locates mugs for their tea. The older man sits in a chair with his back against the wall. Similar to how he had been positioned under the bed. Tony watches Steve’s eyes as they roam the room, constantly monitoring their surroundings, seemingly ready for anything to happen. Steve’s eyes never stop moving, Tony can practically see the wheels in his head turning as he formulates thought afterthought on how to stay safe, stay protected, all of this even as he continues to roll in on himself.
Steve’s senses are so filled with Tony. Everything from the way the man smells. Sweet and earthy like coconut oil but also mechanical, like motor oil. To how he feels, lips soft beneath his, moving in tandem. Body firm, lean muscle flexing and shifting. Driving Steve wild with a need to see how his body shifts without clothing on. He wants to kiss every inch, he wants to draw every inch. He’s so aware of how Tony sounds, the soft whine he lets out when Steve finally leans in. The sigh that comes only a few moments later when Steve squeezes his hip. Steve might never drink coffee again, because it will never taste as sweet as it does when he’s tasting it on Tony’s lips.
“Thank you.” Tony heads toward Peter’s room. “Red pajamas or blue pajamas tonight, kiddo?” Peter simply folds his thumb over his palm, B for Blue Tony assumes. “Alright, blue pajamas it is. Let’s get you cleaned up.”
JARVIS ferries Bruce and Steve up, dropping them off in the penthouse right on time. Tony is still flying around in a ball of nervous energy. He’s placing call after call because ten minutes ago Peter reminded him of something important.
“Alright Underoos the remix,” he grunts, picking MJ up when she sways threateningly. “Let’s get you into bed.”
That’s where Steve recognizes the man from. Numerous news articles that show Happy, often in the passenger seat, sometimes warding off crazed fans, rarely ever driving.
Everything about the night is so strange. Steve calling Tony, for help. The whispered way he tells him about Bucky while leaning into Tony. The explicit trust Steve is putting in Tony shocks the man. So much so he can only drop the blanket and crawl into Steve’s bed, he wraps himself around the bigger man as much as he can.
“I know you and your father didn’t have a great relationship. You didn’t even have a good relationship.” Pepper’s voice is soft now, not her normal professional tones. Not even the exasperated edge that slips in when she thinks Tony is being ridiculous. “But, you’re different. You’re not Howard. You’re Tony, brilliant and compassionate and a survivor in a way nobody else can say they are.” Pepper finishes her sentence by softly patting the reactor in his chest, reminding him that yes, Tony Stark does have a heart.
The cake comes only 20 minutes before the party is supposed to end. It’s a school night, and Tony doesn’t expect the kids to stay after 7:30, so when the cake lady steps off the elevator at 7:10 Tony’s throat is tight.
“It’s so great to finally put a voice to the notes!” Tony thinks for a moment that it appears Steve is drinking him in, taking in the lines of his face, his posture and noticing things that wouldn’t be in the tabloids. Like the fact that Tony wears lifts since he’s only 5’9”, but he isn’t wearing them today or that his eyes are a deep chocolate brown, not hazel like the tabloids always claim. Like the fact that Tony wears glasses with square black frames and little scratches on the lenses from when he forgets to take them off in the workshop. “I guess I’m lucky you’re famous so I at least knew what you looked like. You’re seeing me for the first time and…” He trails off, Tony swears he sounds nervous but he can’t tell why.
“I’m going to put a blanket around your shoulders, okay?” Tony’s voice is soft, soothing. Steve wants to calm down, follow the voice back to where he feels okay. “I need you to nod or tell me it’s okay, baby,”
Tony finds himself standing awkwardly in Steve’s kitchen at 4 am while the kettle warms. The kitchen, located at the end of the hall straight back from the front door, houses a small dining area where Steve currently sits.
Steve pauses, body still shivering against the wall as his eyes rapidly cover the open space in front of him. Tony can almost see the wheels in his head turning before Steve whispers, so quiet Tony could only just hear his words over the distant Brooklyn night traffic.
Tony looks stricken for a second, as if he can’t consider a situation in which his son would be concerned about his wellbeing.
“Mr. Rogers,” JARVIS starts, the A.I.s voice is low, almost like a conspiratorial whisper. “I feel I should warn you. The scene out there resembles a chaotic form of anarchy.”
It’s nearly eight when Tony tucks Steve back into bed. Steve shivers, body hard and tight until Tony finds the well-loved heated blanket in the back of the closet. Steve’s teeth chatter, the soundtrack to Tony’s busy work. He finds a plug-in and dials the blanket up to medium heat, before tucking it around Steve’s shaking shoulders.
Tony looks to the others, eyes roving over the three kids and Steve, a devilish smile taking over his face.
Three hours later, as a new episode of Buffy starts and Ned’s soft snores are drowned out by the theme song. Steve is sure this is the happiest he’s been, ever.
“So, wanna go out with me this weekend?” Tony asks, trying to focus on anything other than how Steve is physically holding him up because his knees are still jelly. “I can find a sitter for Peter, or if you don’t mind maybe Peter could come along? Or we don’t have to. I know you’re... well you’re you and I’m me and that might be weird because you’re my son’s teacher. Would that be weird? You know I haven’t read anywhere about teachers and parents, I mean not that I’m looking because I have a crush on you. Not that I have a crush on you I just… Please make me stop talking.” Tony sighs, taking in the laughter in Steve’s eyes. So many thoughts run through his head in that moment, he wonders how such a kiss could lead to nothing.
“Well… yeah, you did. But, I mean. I thought that if anything it would most likely be Pepper, in the boardroom, with a stiletto.”
With grace and expertise Tony guides Peter and Ned into the land of the waking. He gives them the same instructions he gave MJ before instructing Steve to make sure the boys finish getting ready.
Steve opens the fridge and pulls open the drawer Tony instructed him to look in. The first thing he sees is a small container holding… peanut butter and celery. The snack reminds him of childhood. Weekend sleep overs with Bucky. Humming Steve pulls the Tupperware container out of the fridge only to see the raisins. Tony’s chuckles turn into full laughs as the children around him start snickering as well.
Steve dreams of falling, the sickening feeling of stability abandoning him, with nothing but open air at his feet. He dreams of the terrified screams of a childhood friend, a brother in arms, as he plummets to earth. Steve dreams of the cold, of exhaustion seeping into his bones as he searches and searches. He dreams of when he finally stops searching, finally settles into the snow and finally lets himself rest.
The bug room is just that. An exhibit dedicated solely to insects. Steve watches as Peter’s eyes take in the room. Growing wider with every display.
Steve’s decorations are beautiful. He’s created ornate backdrops for the photo-booth Peter and Tony have set up. He let the students help with painted skeletons and zombies that he cuts out and strings across the walls. He even creates a pop-up cemetery for the kids to play in. Tony is sure that will be a favorite for all the guests, probably for pictures too.
“We should, uh, probably. I think,” Tony stops for a moment, closing his eyes. He slides his free hand from where his fingers are still curled in Steve’s hair. “We should get back out there, yeah?” Tony’s words come out quickly, melting together into one as he rubs a temple.
Steve laughs, a soft sound that echoes in the confines of the elevator. “Thanks for the warning JARVIS. I’ll be ready.”
It seems Tony fell asleep too, and over the course of the night they moved and shifted until Steve’s back is flush with the back of the sofa, Tony pulled to his chest, face tucked into Steve’s neck.
Tony’s brain struggles for a moment, reconciling the Steve he knows now with the slight, wisp of a man being described to him.
Steve’s little house, two bedrooms one bathroom with a nice finished basement, sits in a quaint neighborhood in Brooklyn. Ma worked hard to get it, Steve isn’t sure he can ever part with it. He is pretty sure he couldn’t find a better house in the area, anyway. $350,000 for a townhouse isn’t something he can afford on a teacher’s salary, he’s not interested in the slightest. The distance to Stark Tower is notable though, nearly 13 miles. So, instead of including the trek in his morning run, Steve opts for a taxi, pocket already hurting at the cost. Just as Steve grabs his phone to call a knock at the door startles him.
“Besides,” Steve adds, voice light and teasing. “Do I look like somebody who would skip Sundae Sunday?”
Peter’s Halloween party took place in the huge living room of their floor so Steve hasn’t been able to see the kitchen. Stepping into it now is like stepping into another world.
“Thanks Petey, that…” Tony breaks off, trying to stop his voice from breaking. “You’ve made my whole day.”
Tony finds the men in the communal room. He brings a beer for each and laughs when Clint makes a comment about how rich men’s beer probably tastes like gold flake and asshole. They discuss the night, all of them singing praises and Tony is sure they’re just being nice. They don’t understand that the night was actually one huge mistake after another and Tony barely kept it together.
Steve absolutely, one hundred percent does not bristle with annoyance when the bored young woman working the service desk suddenly peps up upon seeing Tony. Though the younger man doesn’t notice how the woman’s demeanor changes, how she pulls her auburn hair down from the lazy bun it was in, letting it fall in waves around her face, or how she undoes two of the buttons in her polo. Steve see’s it all, he doesn’t let the annoyance curl in his stomach and make his fingers a little numb, no he doesn’t. He doesn’t feel his stomach do envious summersaults when she gives the man an obvious once over and leans across the desk, asking how she can help him, her voice thick with intentions that anybody could recognize as not pure. No, Steve is an adult and his here as Tony’s friend. No jealousy in the area.
