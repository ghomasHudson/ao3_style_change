Steven brought the goblet back up to his lips and quickly finished off the rest of the meed. He reached out and grabbed Tony’s hand again.
Tony opened his mouth to argue, but stopped when Steve curled around him. His arms pulling Tony in tighter to him. Tony felt safe in Steve’s arms in a way that he had really felt before. His life had always hung on the brink of disaster, but here in his fiancé’s embrace it felt like nothing could touch him.
“If you really must complain about a failed sexual endeavor to our infant daughter then I think you need some time to learn a lesson.” He declared when he turned back around to face Tony.
Tony cut him off when they reached the door with a quick "bye" to Thor and then he practically shoved his partner outside.
Bruce squeezed Tony’s shoulder affectionately and smiled softly at him before a more serious expression fell over his face.
Finally, after a long year of caution and parenting, valentines day had come and Tony had insisted on taking his love out for a well deserved romantic evening to celebrate the holiday, even if it wasn't on the actual day. So, they had called up their friend Thor and asked him to baby sit the now 18 month old Peter, which had gotten a lot harder since he discovered walking and as a result, the beginnings of running.
“Uncle Seamus.” Steve greets the man jovially, if a bit more reserved than he had been with his mother.
“Not to worry cousin. Anthony is my shield brother. You have no need to guard him from me. Besides, my Jane would cut off my stones if I so much as thought of marrying another. Her clan does not follow our customs.” Thor clapped Steven on the shoulder once more, seemingly unfazed by his wife’s ever looming threat of castration, before flouncing away into the already rowdy party around them.
“You are a strong, intelligent, loving man who I honestly don't deserve” Tony hesitated for a moment, his body slightly curling in on himself as if afraid he had just shared a bit too much of his inner demons, even if it isn’t the first time he’s said this to him. “You do so much for me and our children.” He hesitated again, his hands coming to rest on his knees and squeezing tightly. “I hate it that you don’t see yourself the way I do. You bring as much, if not more, to our family than I do. Yes, I have a lot of money. Too much money for all of us to use in several life times and the amount just keeps growing. So let me do something useful with it, like taking care of the people I love.” Tony implored, looking to his partner like a kicked puppy.
Tony thought about it for a moment. Clearly something was wrong, but Steve wasn’t going to come out and say it without some sort of push.
“Its only after I have been looking around for a while that I see…” Tony’s voice broke. He struggled to hold in his sobs just thinking about the image that plagued him most both awake and asleep.
Jarvis, Tony’s personal manservant, opened the door slightly as he spoke. “I’m sorry to disturb you, your Majesty. The prince was asking for you.”
Steve looked from his daughter to his friend and then back again, asking with his eyes what she meant by that statement. Tony was looking the most helpless King T’Challa had ever seen him.  So, in an attempt to help his friend, he handed Tony his young son before replying to Steve’s unasked question.
Tony leaned down and placed a chaste kiss on his lovers mouth before quietly mumbling, “I missed you”.
As exhausted as he was, Steve decided that he should join his family and surprise his lover and their children when they woke up. After a quick shower to rid himself of all the grime from his travels, Steve carefully slid himself opposite Tony so that their children were tucked safely in between them. It was the most peaceful and contented sleep that either Steve or Tony had ever had, until it was shattered in the wee hours of the morning by their daughter’s crying. Peace was always short lived when two of the most famous super heroes in the world had two kids under five.
Tony was silent for a long time. He stared down at the face of the man he had once loved above all others. He didn’t know if he could do this.
Steve and Tony walked through the doors of the building hand in hand. They entered what appears to be the great hall. The high ceiling was curves inward in a mockery of the mountain behind it and tall metal stands lined the walls fires burning brightly to light the space. In the center of the room was a small cluster of impressively large chairs facing the doorway. There were a series of five chairs all lighted up together. In the center of the pack was a large and intricately carved chair that Tony assumed was meant for the king. To the right of the King’s chair sat a slightly smaller version of it. The rest of the chairs were all noticeably smaller and less intricate than those other two chairs. In one of these chairs sat a petite blonde woman with the same glowing blue eyes Tony had been mesmerized by since he first saw them. Around the woman stood several old men and behind her stood a tall man with the same graying blond hair.
Tony searched Steve’s face for any kind of lie. How could this man want to know more about Tony’s people than how to conquer them? He had heard tales about what a skilled warrior the High King of Ireland was and the other rumors that he was a kind and just man had drawn Tony to him above any other warrior King he heard tell of, but this was a surprise.
“Shh. Whats the matter baby girl?” Steve asked soothingly already gently rocking his daughter on an attempt to calm her and reassure himself that his daughter was not physically harmed.
As for Tony, he had been working a lot since they had returned home from their last mission. After all, the CEO couldn't leave Stark Industries unattended for long, despite how talented Pepper was at running the business for him. For the first time in a long time, Steve was glad that Tony’s income and substantial wealth allowed for him to stay home with the babies, even if he didn't particularly like being completely reliant on his partner for everything. Despite his relief at having the freedom to stay home and take care of their children without worry, Steve still felt that he wasn't contributing to their household in an equal way to Tony and it bothered him immensely.
Tony looked up at Steve, removing the hand that he had unconsciously brought up to his chin when he began thinking of possible names.
“You were in the ranks out our party this morning were you not? Are you a soldier then?” Tony asked, wishing to start up some sort of conversation to fill the silence.
“Gifts?” Tony asked, shaking himself out of the hypnotic effects his husband’s voice was having on him already.
Steve opened his mouth and invited his lover in. Tony quickly took the bait and their tongues began to engage in a heated dance. He was now thoroughly distracted and Steve took advantage of it.
"She's already ours isn't she?" Tony asked half relieved and half terrified at the idea of being the father of two small children.
“Well” Tony paused. “Its not as green as it is here, and there are many tall mountains all around. In the winter they become covered in snow, but the rest of the year they are filled with flowers. On clear days, you can climb to the highest point in the city and just make out the ocean in the distance. The city itself is mostly stone now. My father designed much of it and I did most of the rest.”
Fortunately for Tony there was plenty to do in the Rogers-Stark household. It was nearly a full time job keeping an eye on the now two year old Peter, who's favorite pass time had become running around the house on the walls and ceiling and seeing how much he could smash before his parents got fed up and put him in his specially designed playpen with his toys.
Steve picked up the satchel and held it out to Tony with both hands. Tony hastily placed his own goblet aside and reached out to take the bag from his betrothed. He carefully untied the straps securing it and reached inside. His fingers brushed against cold metal. He gently pulled the item out of the bag and into the fire light. It was a thin gold necklace no thicker than his fingers. It appeared to be made of several twisted pieces of metal made into some form of braid and each end flared out into a smooth flat circle.
The other Avengers were just as nervous about bringing their baby nephew with them into battle. They had all agreed that Steve would lead from the back this time and the boys had all made a silent vow to get this over with as quickly as possible. Natasha, for her part, had spent a good chunk of time rolling her eyes and bemoaning the stupidity of her male teammates. Don't get her wrong, Natasha was worried for her baby nephew, but she was also worried for the city due to all of the excess damage that was currently being inflicted on it due to the overzealous actions of their "saviors".
Tony heard a soft voice call from the other side of the door and he pushed it open. Tony felt all the pain of dreams unfulfilled fall away as his eyes locked on his son’s curly dark head half burrowed under the covers.
“We know, Tony.” Rhodey said, he and Pepper raising their heads. “But you are our King, and now he is too. We choose to bow to you and we choose to honor what you have done for us.”
They set off at a brisk pace out of the clearing and down the hill as if worried they would be followed and stoped. Steven lead them through the sprawl of tents and into one of the largest of the bunch. It was set at one edge of the camp and surrounded by several tents all about the same size, but Tony was more focused on what he could see just inside the tent. In the center there was a small fire pit ready to be lit and the rest of the ground was covered in rich furs.
“What is it little one?” King T’Challa asked in a quiet “Uncle” voice that was laced with familial concern, his head bent down to look more closely at his niece.
Natasha, who was ecstatic at the prospect of no longer being the only female who was dragged all over the world with this group of goons, was currently cradling her new niece. She looked up at Steve and Tony, which wasn't very hard considering that Steve had been hovering around everyone one who had held his new baby girl and Tony had trailed behind him like a lost puppy.
Tony was still too caught up in the throngs of his panic to respond to his son. He merely curled tighter in on himself and tried to keep his sobs from escaping his mouth so as not to scare his son further. It seemed to have worked because Peter walked away. However, he returned a moment later with his favorite elephant stuffed animal (Steve had some obsession with elephant themed baby things that was completely beyond Tony).
Tony was startled from his thought by Steven rising our of his seat. A hush fell over the crowd gathered before them, but the music didn’t stop. Steven gestured for Bucky to come towards them. Bucky reached down and pulled a sturdy bag from the ground. Tony supposed this was the exchanging of gifts they were supposed to do. Tony looked over at Rhodey. They held eye contact for a moment and then Rhodey was moving, bringing the silver goblet over to Tony without a word. Tony watched his best friend make his way over to the head table, spine straight and shoulders back. Rhodey was every inch the proud warrior he had always been. Tony smiled softly up at Rhodey once stood in front of him. Rhodey reached into his own satchel and pulled out the goblet, placing it gently on the table. He nodded to Tony, a small smile on his own face, before retreating back to his seat next to Pepper and Bruce.
Steve’s hands moved from Tony’s face to his back and pulled him flush against Steve’s chest. Tony moaned. He moved one of his own hands from Steve’s hair to grip at the back of his tunic. Steve’s hands started exploring all over Tony’s body. Their groans seemed to fill the tent as Tony’s body seemed to heat more and more, mouths never discontenting for more than a moment’s breath. Steve reached both hands down and grasped the globes of Tony’s ass through his clothes before pulling them ever so slightly apparat. Tony pulled back from their kiss and threw his head back in a loud moan, the smell of his own slick hitting his nose.
Thor could see the unease in Steve's face and body language and was currently attempting to ease his friend's fears.
“Not to worry.” Tony replied. “My own mother was the same way. She would have… well she would have been either overly excited or ambivalent.”
It was then that Steve noticed the small embroidered words on the edge of the baby blanket. Steve gently ran his finger over it but couldn't make any sense of the foreign language. He was almost sure that he had seen the name before, but couldn't quite place where. In a moment of inspiration, Steve remembered that the words had been on a large sign above what had probably once been the entrance to the building. Realizing that he would have to wait for Tony to translate the words for him, Steve gently picked up the small infant and prepared to move out.
“Oh thank heavens.” Steve exclaimed, relief evident on his face at the sight of his two children in the arms of his friend.
“Getting a little impatient there, Captain?” He teased before gently nipping Steve’s ear eliciting a gasp and slight buck of his hips into Tony’s.
Abruptly Bruce took a step back and Tony inhaled sharply. He had been practicing for this part. His Gaelic was much better than it had been, but it was nowhere near perfect and Tony desperately needed to not embarrass himself. Tony looked up into Steven’s eyes again and suddenly it was like they were the only two people in the world.
Tony finally got back to the Tower of the King late in the evening. He took off the crown and threw it haphazardly on the dresser. He made a point of not looking in the mirror as he started to undo the ties on his formal doublet. Just as he had gotten the top few ties undone there was a knock on the door.
Slowly Steve retuned the baby to Thor and started the rant he had subjected the young god to when he had first arrived.
“I missed you to.” Tony whispered. “But,” He cleared his throat. “There are so many things we need to talk about before we can move forward.”
“Really?” Tony shook his head and raised his hand to silence Steve’s pitiful attempts at protest. “You and I can discuss this latter because clearly I won’t be getting any sleep until we do, but right now OUR son needs me.”
There. That explained at least part of it and hopefully kept Steve from realizing how pathetic he really was. This was going to be a loveless marriage just like his parent’s own union. That was always going to be his fate. He should just be grateful his betrothed was hot and seemed to be a decent man so far. That could change though. Tony knew just how quickly a seemingly kind man could turn vicious.
There was a larger amorous opposite him that was taller than his betrothed. It was placed at the opposite end of the wall from the door and two large trunks on either side of it. On the opposite wall was one other a large desk covered in papers. Tony walked from the window over to the table to examine the sheets. He reached for one and turned it over to find a beautifully done sketch.
Tony heard a slight cough and turned to look at his Fiancé. Steve’s hand was raised to his mouth and his pale skin had turned a fierce red. Tony couldn’t helps but find it endearing.
Tony looked over to glance at his fiancé. His face was smooth and impassive except for the slight downtick at the corner of his mouth. Tony returned his focus forward. Well that didn’t take long. It had been barely half a day since they left Tara, the sight of their hand fasting, and he had already managed to ruin this.
“You said something earlier today…” Steve paused as if considering his next words as carefully as he could. “… something about your father that worried me.”
“My King.” The man said in what Tony took to be a teasing manner from the slight uptick of the woman’s mouth. “Allow me?”
“Come, my betrothed. We are having a feast to celebrate our union. Then I will show you to our tent. Your gifts are waiting there.” Steve said, his voice was deep and melodic. A slight shiver went down Tony’s spine. He was definitely looking forward to the night ahead of them.
A quiet growl erupted from Steve’s throat making it clear just how much he hated the words that were coming out of Tony’s mouth. Tony instinctively bared his thought to his would be mate. “I’m your’s, Alpha. None of that actually happened.”
He could hear the crackle of the fire and beyond that movements and soft voices all around them. The feast seemed to have ended at some point and people were making their way back to their tents for the night. Tony looked at Steve questioningly. He didn’t see the problem here. Wasn’t it their duty to consummate their union. What would everyone else care if they enjoyed it rather loudly?
Tony raised his left arm proudly over his head, the gold of his rope catching the last rays of the setting sun. Tony saw an action the mirror of his own on the opposite side of the crowd. A pale hand raised above the people, a burgundy red, dark blue, and silver rope clutched in it. Tony took a step forward and saw the other rope move one step closer to him as well. The two of them made mirrored movements closer and closer together until the crowd separated and Tony got his first look at the man he was going to marry.
Tony smiled down at his partner. Oh how he loved this man. He leaned down and kissed Steve tenderly, telling him in his own special way that he loved him more than anything. Once Tony leaned back from the kiss, Steve looked back at him and smiled.
Tony let out a real, healthy laugh at that before agreeing. He slowly got up, taking his son with him and went to grab his daughter from her chair before taking them both to bed. The three of them curled up and took a well deserved and very restful nap on Steve and Tony’s giant mattress.
"What I meant was that there are a lot Sarahs. We might want to give her a more unique middle name?" Tony started hopefully.
Steve was incredibly weary of how much the general public already knew about his family and he was not about to let them even further into their private lives without a fight. However, he knew that he would eventually have to give in since Tony himself was an incredibly public figure even before becoming Iron Man. It was only expected that the same fate would befall the Rogers-Stark children.
Steve blanched and was half way through figuring out how to snatch his young son out of the arms of the norse god when Thor realized his mistake.
There was an awkward silence that fell over them. There was something slithering just beneath the surface between them that needed to be addressed, but neither of them made any effort to do so. It was suddenly a far cry from the welcoming warmth that had flared between them as they dances. The silence stretched over them as they finally made it back to their bedroom door and started to chafe at the edges of Tony’s nerves as they dressed for bed.
Not wanting to ruin the good mood, they soon drop the topic. They each do their own thing for several minutes, only to be broken once more by Natasha.
When Mjölnir first spoke to him that fateful night he first lifted her — god, it felt like a lifetime ago, just thinking about it — to say that Tony was shocked at that discovery would be the understatement of the century. Accepting the truth of his ability to wield Mjölnir didn’t take him long, but accepting his
Knowing that Bruce is currently holed up in his lab with the assistance of JARVIS, in the process of getting to the bottom of Tony’s predicament, gives Steve hope that they’re a step closer to solving the mystery.
Admittedly, he’s no better in the situation since Steve’s also resorted to calling Tony names. ‘Doll’ and ‘darling’ are what he uses frequently, but one time he called Tony ‘babe’, and Tony looked at Steve with this really sweet, really soft expression it made Wanda throw marshmallows at them and Sam to walk out of the communal kitchen.
. All those things can be accomplished by anyone, but the difference between anyone and you— and I think this is where Mjölnir’s trying to hammer her point into you, no pun intended — is that you do all these things not to raise the company’s stocks or keep up your reputation, but you do so out of selflessness. A devotion to mankind, so to speak. You create innovating technology to help better our future; you save countless lives on a daily basis, and that’s both in and out of the suit. I’d name all the philanthropic stuff you’ve done, but the list is endless. Tony, you chose to do all that and
Then the Chitauri Invasion of 2012 happened. That’s when The Avengers first banded together to help defeat Loki and the aliens. Not long after that, his relationship with Pepper ended after she watched him fly a nuke up through a worm hole from the TV screen. That act of self-sacrifice he pulled was the last proverbial straw that broke Pepper’s back, and Tony wasn’t the least bit surprised when she broke up with him. True, he was hurt, and he went on a week-long bender after that, but see, the thing is that Pepper
Pepper sniffles against the curve of his neck, and Tony is filled with guilt for keeping one of his best friends in the dark. God forbid Rhodey finds out, and knowing Pepper, Tony knows he’ll be hearing from the Colonel sooner than later.
“Thought you might like the company,” Tony says with a shrug, although there’s a faint flush to his cheeks that Steve finds really… adorable.
“Because despite your opinions about Tony and Iron Man, he’s going to need all the support he can get from you. And frankly, I don’t think any of you understand just how much Tony needs you,
The engineer groans out loud when his mind conjures up a hazy image of the redheaded assassin smirking at Tony as she fills up the shot glass with AsomBroso tequila.
But one thing’s for sure: this much good press will certainly increase Stark Industries’ stocks, thus keeping the board of directors happy and off his radar for several weeks, which Tony prefers and considers a blessing in disguise.
Closing his eyes, Tony focuses inward and clears his mind. He does so by concentrating on his breathing — two seconds in, three seconds out. He repeats the process a few more times until the chaos in his mind dissipates. When Tony slowly breathes out for the last time, he finds himself almost calm and grounded in that moment. Next, he opens his eyes and when he calls for more lightning the second time around, he instantly notices the difference.
“Let me take a wild guess,” Tony remarks as he starts jogging backwards, away from the portal and the approaching Chitauri. “These asshats figured out what the suit was for, destroyed it before it can reach them, and now there’s more of them coming in.”
Secondly, Tony and Peter look disheveled in their sweatpants and stained white shirts. It’s their usual garb during lab time when Peter spends the weekend at The Tower, and Steve’s seen them dressed like this countless times already but the sight never fails to make Steve all warm inside.
They’re silent for a while after that. Suddenly, Tony’s temples throb, and he closes his eyes with a curse.
Pepper's slender fingers fly over the keyboard for a few moments before the monitor shows a mainframe that features a lot of codes and colors. Just looking at it is enough to give Steve a migraine. The redhead CEO types some more before another window opens and the rest can see the two-step authentication Bruce found earlier.
This time, it’s Clint’s voice they hear over the comms. “I’ve changed spots but — hang on, I think — yeah, I have visuals on Goldilocks. He looks to be knocked out. Must be from the explosion as well ‘cos there’s a slab of concrete and an upturned vehicle on top of him.”
“Good to be back, Captain,” is the AI’s response, then quickly adds, “Currently tracing Sir’s whereabouts.”
It takes JARVIS a fraction of a second to respond, and his AI’s voice is laced with concern when he says, “Sir, your bedroom won’t have proper ventilation if I do as you say. Your vitals also indicate that your body temperature is perfectly normal, and I —”
20/20 as it occurred to him several weeks later that what Steve said about the first step towards healing being the hardest was true.
“I’m not okay, I’m not okay,” Tony belatedly hears himself mutter under his breath like a broken record, his face pressed against Steve’s broad chest. Next, he feels a hand run through his bedraggled hair, and Tony initially thought it was Steve’s, but then he realizes that it’s too small and feminine. Then it dawns on him that it’s Natasha who’s standing on his left, quietly murmuring words of comfort in Russian as she strokes his head in a soothing manner. Her ministrations help subside his quaking body, but it’s Steve’s hold on Tony that helped ground him. He feels Steve’s hands, resting lightly on the middle of his back, grip him a little tighter when Tony utters, “This terrifies me.”
“Hey, honey,” Tony answers sweetly, and though he’s in the midst of battle he can’t help the flutter in his chest upon hearing his boyfriend’s — they’re
“Agent Barton and Agent Romanoff are still at SHIELD, Mr. Odinson has not yet returned from his trip in New Mexico, and Doctor Banner wishes to not be disturbed as he is in the middle of a time-sensitive experiment,” JARVIS answers promptly.
didn’t notice it until he’s literally laid hands on him. “You’re shivering,” he adds, unable to hide the alarm in his voice. “Why— are you running a fever?”
Another piece added to the puzzle that is Tony Stark. Yes, they’re nowhere near close to solving it, but considering the information that they just unearthed in this meeting, it’s evident that a picture is slowly being formed. This can be considered as a minor success, and Steve is not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.
me, like the way you’ve all been treating me this whole time. My point is that all I ask of you is to exert a little patience with me. Would you grant me this courtesy, at least? I’m not a god or a super soldier. I’m getting old and I have health issues. And now I’ve revealed too much and I just made this whole thing way too awkward. So I’m leaving. Bye.”
“Let me stop you there,” Tony cuts in emphatically. At Steve’s surprised blink, the engineer flushes slightly, but he resolutely adds, “I mean — it makes sense that you feel, or think, that you don’t. Because you weren’t even born in this era. God knows what
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen you like this before, Bruce,” Steve comments after his laughter dies down. He sees Thor pass the microphone to Natasha, just as the notes to a Cranberries song starts to play.
Tony takes in his surroundings one more time before he answers, “I’m clear here, too.” Then he adds, “J, what’s the sitch?”
Tony doesn’t have anything to say to that. Regardless, he still catches the reference, and it leaves him feeling more unsettled than ever.
Rhodey, on the other hand, blinks at Tony from the 85-inch TV screen installed in the living room. In fact, the colonel blinks again and stares harder at Tony, who does his best not to squirm too much under the military man’s scrutinizing gaze. It takes a few more seconds before Rhodey’s expression clears to one of mild alarm.
“Bet you were sick and tired of that place, Stark,” Clint quips with a teasing grin. “I know I would have.”
Tony has his back turned already, but he smirks when he hears Steve laugh out loud at his parting words.
Tony doesn’t bother to give him an answer except to roll his eyes and flip him off. Steve laughs, but it abruptly cuts off when Tony finally make a move.
He’s still massaging his cheek when he glumly admits, “I didn’t mean it that way. I just wanted to see if the Tony I —
Instead, Steve raises an eyebrow at Tony. “So you’re saying you took twelve shots of tequila for shits and giggles?”
The silence then becomes more strained as the minutes ticked by, and that’s when Steve finally decides to break it.
“But that’s the thing,” Tony argues. “I don’t want to burden them with my problems. It doesn’t matter—”
Steve rolls his eyes despite the blush on his face. Natasha, on the other hand, arches a brow at him.
. Ashamed of the fact that he’s a grown-ass adult, the leader of a superhero team, and a national icon wherein millions of people
Steve blinks, and his smile widens a fraction. Before his brain can catch up, he finds himself bringing a hand up to cup Tony’s jaw, thumb stroking his cheekbone. He was right: it
“No! N-no, it’s fine,” Tony rasps out with a shudder as he forces his eyes open. His skin crawls uncomfortably, and he feels too big and small at the same time, leaving him disoriented. Letting out a deep breath, he shakily adds, “I’ll — I’m fine, J. I’m gonna go there. In a bit. Just, uh, just need to freshen up.”
Thor is in the middle of singing a horrible rendition of “We Are The Champions” when Steve feels a solid body bump into his shoulder. The blond is broken from his internal musing when his attention focuses on Bruce’s slightly swaying form. Based from his glassy eyes and slackened expression, Steve surmises the scientist has had too much to drink.
Steve surmised that there’s still a silver lining to their current situation. Following Tony’s emotional breakdown, it’s like a barrier has been lifted that was separating the engineer from the rest of the team. Granted, Tony’s still acting his unusual self since he woke up, but he’s been a bit more open to them. Not in an atypical way that would send alarm bells ringing in Steve’s head. Just that after they comforted the engineer, Steve had the feeling that they passed some sort of test. And having passed that test led to Tony warming up to them.
He unbuttons the top two buttons of his shirt before he gestures with his hand for Steve to stand beside the grand piano. The blond man does so, albeit reluctantly, resting one large palm on the closed lid of the instrument as he regards Tony with a look of awe, mouth slightly open as his eyes move from the engineer to the piano and back again.
“Uh, Cap? Steve?” Tony asks at last, unable to take the silence any longer. “Some feedback would be nice. Preferably ‘thank you’.”
Feeling the exhaustion seep into his bones, Tony rolls his shoulders and holds on to what’s left of his energy. Although there’s no doubt that Thor and Hulk can kill the mothership in record time, Tony doesn’t want to risk more vessels going through the portal.
While Tony continues to take notes on reparations for his suit, Steve meanwhile inspects one of the blueprints displayed in front of him, absently noting that it’s a schematic of new arrows for Clint. He keeps track of Tony’s movements from the corner of his eye, lest the stubborn genius injures himself further. He hears him clear his throat, back now fully turned to the super soldier, and Steve is momentarily distracted at the view of Tony’s round, plump ass. It’s a spectacular ass, alright, and Steve got so lost in another fantasy of him worshipping Tony’s body that he completely fails to hear the whooshing sound behind him signaling the arrival of one of their teammates entering the workshop.
“Tony,” Steve groans to himself, drawing out the last syllable as he thumps his head at the back of the couch.
type of situation is to watch and observe Tony and act accordingly to how he acts around us. For example, #10 on your list says ‘Strike up a conversation with Tony about his interests when you’re in the same room’ doesn’t really give off a genuine vibe.”
— took longer. Tony won’t admit it to anyone but himself, but having that fact hammered — pun definitely intended — into his thick skull countless times over the past couple of months has certainly helped him deal with his demons.
. But thinking back to last night’s drinking session with his teammates, Tony still can’t bring himself to regret allowing himself to get carried away with his alcohol intake.
of mistakes, and I’m still atoning for them. Still making up for the… important components that got lost, or destroyed. And no matter how much I work, no matter how much I build and freely give to make up for the loss, it still doesn’t feel enough. Like, I have to — I
It takes a bit of maneuvering, their knees and elbows bumping against each other as Steve throws half of the blanket over Tony’s legs and he picks up another cushion from the floor to use as a pillow. They end up on their sides, facing each other, their noses almost touching at the close proximity. And though Tony’s nursing a hangover, the idea of being the little spoon is a no-go. Well, at least for now. Maybe. That is, if this even happens again.
This strikes a chord in Tony. He’s clasping his hands in a tight grip, nails biting into his skin while he listens to the elderly woman talk about her love’s heroics.
of her. But another part of her, the sensible part that is, could understand why Tony would draw to that conclusion.
“You just know how to make a man feel special,” the genius remarks, and Bruce is decent enough not to point out how Tony’s grin falter at his heartfelt words.
They remain in that position for some time, Steve basking in the affection and trust Tony has bestowed upon him until JARVIS informs them that the food has arrived and their teammates are impatiently waiting for them to join them in the living room.
“That sounds like a good plan, Thor,” Steve acknowledges with a grateful nod towards the Asgardian prince. Turning to Bruce, the super soldier adds, “But Bruce, that still doesn’t explain Tony’s behavior earlier. He was… not exactly himself. I mean, that couldn’t have been him, though. Right?”
“Thor, you’re the next closest to Nat. Can you intercept the spider bots in time while Iron Man comes to give her a lift?” Steve continues after he lets out a breathy thank you to Tony.
Another minute passes before Bruce shows up in the bedroom carrying a bag of supplies with him. Steve tries not to blush too hard at the raised eyebrow the good doctor gives him, and he stays where he is and doesn’t cease his ministrations on Tony’s hair. Which, now that he’s thinking, only seems to fuel Bruce’s amusement and confusion. But thankfully he doesn’t say anything, considering they have more pressing matters to attend to.
Tony flushes at Steve's stunned look. He quickly waves it off, feeling a little self-conscious then.
It’s quiet for several moments, Thor observing Tony with smug satisfaction as the latter breathes heavily, expression a mix of astonishment and — fear? Longing? Unease? Thor is unsure so he files that away for now, the Asgardian wanting nothing more than to dispel his friend’s worries and insecurities once and for all.
“Moving on,” Steve deadpans with what Tony assumes is with his customary eye roll. “Any idea when Thor is arriving?”
The engineer’s tone is even, but laced with an emotion that Steve can’t discern, when he says, “I’m fine, physically.”
. None of you do, so don’t pretend that you’ve got me all figured out because let me be frank with you: I’ll never be the person you want me to be so don’t expect that you can mold me into someone that you deem fit. Howard tried doing that, Obadiah attempted several times. Hell, even Pepper and Rhodey tried to change me, and they’re the two most important people in my life. None of them succeeded, because you know why? I’m fucked up! Damaged goods or whatever. So you better get that fantasy out of your head, Cap. Just because we got something going on doesn’t mean you’re gonna be my knight in shining fucking armor and be the person to save me from myself.”
“I’m a grown-ass adult. I can do whatever the hell I want, especially when it comes to drinking milkshakes at half past two in the morning.”
your problems and it’s your business, I respect that — I want you to know that that’s not your only option. You have the team behind your back and by your side. Yes, you fight your battles and you do so beautifully and admirably. But you should, you
“Don’t know what’s there to learn more about,” Tony eventually utters, sounding indifferent but Bruce knows better now. “Forged in the heart of a dying star, right? That’s what Thor said. Created with magic and all that jazz. Nothing further to learn, really.”
Tony glances at him, and there’s a softness in his brown eyes that the super soldier discerns when he aims an equally soft smile at Steve. The pressing weight in his chest suddenly gives way to a fluttery feeling, and he willfully ignores the keen gazes of Natasha and Bruce as he returns Tony’s smile with one of his own.
His mind hazy with exhaustion and vision blurring slightly around the edges (that can’t be good, he thinks, but quickly swats the thought away because he needs his caffeine fix, damn it), he distantly hears himself croak out a request for JARVIS to turn on the lights to twenty-five percent. When he’s bathed with the soft fluorescent lights, he mumbles a thanks and proceeds to make his way to the counter where he knows the coffee machine is located.
“I did,” Steve admits honestly. It’s worth it, though, upon seeing Tony’s blinding smile. “Ready, Shellhead?”
Steve blinks again before a smile slowly stretches across his face. “Good morning. Have you been standing there just staring at me?”
It’s Tony, however, who remains calm and unaffected. Although there’s a small crease between his brows, and he appears to be lost in thought as he ponders on Steve’s questions.
type of person who gets between a couple. Hell no, he’ll gladly remain Tony’s friend than be the one to destroy his relationship with a remarkable and beautiful woman like Pepper Potts.
Blinking away his thoughts, Steve shakes his head once. He takes a few steps towards Tony who hasn’t spoken a word since Steve called out his name.
“What’re you doing still up, then?” Steve asks, trying to find his footing in the conversation. “I thought you crashed hours ago.”
Steve can picture it perfectly in his mind’s eye. And it’s an image he finds himself itching to sketch.
He’s done with the pining, to be honest. Sooner or later, Steve will find out that Tony has feelings for him, and Tony would rather have said feelings be revealed under his own terms. Granted, he knows Captain Righteous is bisexual himself, having confessed to Tony a long time ago that he used to have a thing for his best friend Bucky when they were in their teens. Of course, Steve hasn’t dated much — or at all, frankly speaking — since he woke up, but that is of his own volition, rather than a lack of prospects.
“It’s the way you carry yourself. Can’t see your eyes, can I? But no matter, those hands of yours speak a world of experience, and as far as I know, my George had that same slump in his shoulders as you do. He was a surgeon, see. Served in World War II. Saved as many lives as he could, but war’s a messy business. Can’t save everyone. Still, didn’t stop my George from feeling guilty for every life lost under his hands. Went into depression for a long while, too, along with the PTSD. It took years before he got better.”
“Sorry to hear that,” Steve hears himself say. He clears his throat and adds, albeit sheepishly, “Anything I can do to help?”
. Words won’t even do justice at how amazing you are. I mean, we definitely got some talking to do but,
Well, Steve sure won’t be happy once he finds out Tony’s been on another engineering binge, Clint thinks with a snort. It’s bad enough he’s a witness to the duo’s unsubtle flirting, considering that they’re all living in the same building, and one of these days Clint swears he’s going to get fed up and lock those two up in a closet so they can fuck it out. That is, if Steve eventually grows a pair and decides to stop beating around the bush to make a move on Stark. God knows how much of a
“You’ve been talking to yourself for the past thirty minutes about what to get for Captain Rogers’ birthday, sir.”
that kind of doctor, but Tony is one of his best friends and he deeply cares about the guy. So Bruce decides then that he will no longer allow Tony to wallow in this state on his own.
“I’ve been walking around this area for the past hour, and every time I passed by, there’s this troubled look on your face. Not even those glasses of yours can hide the burden you’re carrying, dear.”
They all get up from their seats and amble towards the elevator. The lights in the common area shut off one by one as they all shuffle together inside the shaft. They bid each other ‘good night’ as they got off on their designated floor until it’s Steve who’s the last person to step out of the elevator.
“For once you’re getting good press, and it’s not just your typical breaking news, either,” Natasha finishes for him with a smug smirk.
Tony ignores Clint’s indignant squawk as he shifts his feet so his stance is perfectly balanced. With a loud exhale, Tony thrusts Mjölnir up and calls on the strongest surge of lightning he can muster before directing the current towards the enormous Leviathan. The electrical charge hits it directly on the face, but it doesn’t go down despite Thor and Jolly Green impaling jagged pieces of its metal armor in its body. Gritting his teeth, Tony is briefly distracted when he tastes blood in his mouth, but immediately casts that thought aside in favor of commanding more lightning to hit the serpentine body.
Sharing one last grin, they leave their little spot at the corner of the venue, shoulders brushing against each other in solidarity.
Tony is heaving deeply by the end of his impassioned speech, and Steve’s heart is thumping so hard against his chest. His hurt at the genius’s words must’ve shown on his face because as quick as Tony’s temper flared, it dissolved in an instant as shame and remorse warred over his features.
“I’m sorry, babe,” Steve expresses apologetically. Tony blinks, both surprised at the apology and the use of a pet name. “I didn’t mean to — I never thought you were —”
“So what’s the plan?” the archer inquires, looking around each member with an uncertain look. “What do we do next?”
The man in question, dressed in his usual double-breasted suit, warmly replies with a, “Hello, sir.”
Still, it takes Steve a full minute to type out his response, damp fingers not helping in the least bit.
Just then, they’re both broken out of their stupor when the coffee machine beeps. Tony blinks a few times, still looking dazed, and Clint’s still wrapping his mind around the fact that
“Yo assholes, this one’s for you,” Clint says into the mic just as the notes of a familiar song start to play.
Tony feels himself blush, and he attempts to shift his position, but Steve’s arms tighten around him, preventing Tony from escaping (as if he wanted to). Knowing he’s only going to fight a losing battle, he allows himself to relax in Steve’s arms once more. With a sigh of contentment, Tony closes his eyes and burrows his face further into Steve’s neck, shamelessly inhaling the man’s scent.
He doesn’t want to put a name to it, not yet. He’s far from superstitious, but even Steve doesn’t want to jinx it. But he’s fought enough battles with his team to know when he’s witnessed a game changer.
Tony grins at him, though the physicist sees the vulnerability in his expression, notes how his eyes are bright with repressed emotion, so Bruce opts to squeeze Tony’s shoulder once before letting go and taking a step back.
Tony snorts, and he’s smirking at Steve as he replies, “What makes you think I didn’t time that perfectly, Rogers?”
“J-JARVIS,” Tony chokes, still heaving deep breaths. He tightly shuts his eyes, vague images of his dream dancing behind his eyelids like a distorted film reel as JARVIS — his
“I’m guessing that that same light is the cause of what’s happening to Tony right now. It’s like what he said earlier — physically, he’s alright. But ‘something’ is missing, and we don’t know
Tony winces slightly at her ‘please tell me you didn’t fuck up’ tone. In a quiet voice, he answers, “Well… I may or may not have purchased a grand piano the other day.”
There’s several moments of tense silence following his tirade, only broken by Clint clearing his throat.
With one hand wrapped around Steve’s, he stares in joy when Tony takes hold of Mjölnir in his other hand. Steve knows he’ll never tire of that sight, either.
“Oh! Yeah, that’s the song,” the engineer agrees with a nod. “It’s called ‘Ho Hey’. I forgot the name of the band, though.”
“Good tidings, fellow shield brothers and sister!” Thor’s voice booms enthusiastically, Tony wincing at the loud intonation of his friend over the comms. “What have I missed?”
“Nonsense!” Thor exclaims, and this time he doesn’t fight the mischievous grin from spreading across his face. Tony’s beginning to look at him suspiciously as he adds, “We will be evenly matched, my friend.”
he feels, spreading from the inside out. He’s never felt that before until today. And it isn’t until he’s stripping out of his sweat-soaked clothes that he realizes the phantom pressure in his chest is absent.
Steve knows he wasn’t meant to hear it, and it’s only thanks to the serum that he even picked up on it in the first place. So he pretends that he didn’t hear it, but the way his stomach swoops at the compliment shows that he isn’t completely unaffected by Tony’s words.
,” Bruce answers, eyes focused on the table in front of him. It’s clear to everyone that the cogs of his brain are working overtime as he digests the new information that Steve just shared. “In-between
, and he doesn’t fight off the smile that spreads across his face. He knows he won’t give this all up without a fight.
When Bruce rights Tony, Steve meets the engineer’s eyes. Warmth blooms in Steve’s chest when he sees the happiness in Tony’s eyes. Sure, he’s a little tipsy at this point, but there’s no mistaking the relaxed limbs of the other man. Steve knows the hardships Tony’s going through these days — responsibilities at SI, the Avengers, his strained relationship with Pepper — and it’s humbling for the super soldier to know that Tony trusts
“He married me, of course,” the elderly woman replies with a wink at Tony, and he can’t help but laugh at that.
Only, this action causes him to suddenly stop in his tracks as he lets his hand skim over his chest for several moments longer. The tendrils of panic begin to creep up his spine when he doesn’t feel his arc reactor.
Oh, Steve’s perfectly aware that he swings both ways, though his preference leans more towards the male spectrum. But his bisexuality isn’t the reason why he’s been having strange, unnameable feelings towards Tony. No, not at all. He’s still figuring things out on his own, and Steve hopes that the current predicament they’re in will also help shed a light on, well, pretty much everything. From Tony and his unusual behavior to Steve embarking on uncharted territories by befriending the one person he’s secretly been hoping to connect with.
He was singing? What the fuck? He wasn’t even aware he was still capable of doing that. Tony remembers forcing himself to grow out of that mindless habit in his teens after good ol’ Howard ordered him to cut out his nonsensical humming. It was mostly that, actually — nonsensical humming — but there were times back then when Tony, too deep in his thoughts with designs and equations, would hum songs under his breath. Most of the time, the lyrics are wrong, especially if they were songs he heard on the radio in passing. But sometimes, they don’t even have lyrics, and Tony just hums the tune under his breath while spouting random lyrics on-the-fly.
It’s been three weeks since the incident, and Tony thought that his condition would improve with time, but it only appears to worsen as time passes by. He still frequently gets those terrible chills. It started as once a week, then twice a week, and now, approaching the fourth week, Tony’s been experiencing it three nights in a row now. Every time it does happen, he finds himself in The In-Between with Jarvis. And every morning he wakes up from visiting — is that even the correct term? — that place, he barely remembers what they talked about. Like the remnants of a dream, it fades away until Tony’s left with nothing but the same empty feeling in his chest. Yes, the chills are gone, but it’s with bitterness that the engineer thinks it’ll only return again.
“Where you slow pokes at?” He starts by way of greeting. “You’re missing all the fun in this party.”
Steve musters a small but genuine smile and turns his head to look at Tony, but the greeting dies on his lips when he sees the haunted look in the engineer’s eyes.
Chuckling, Tony nudges his shoulder against Steve and says, “Come on, Rogers. I think we’ve stayed in our little bubble long enough.”
He doesn't notice Steve's stunned silence, and to be honest Tony's so far off now that he doesn't even realize what he's just said.
Steve turns his head to look at Thor with bewilderment. He’s not the only one. Natasha and Clint share twin looks of confusion before aiming it at the demigod. Bruce, on the other hand, blinks and massages his temples.
“Raise the necessary alarms, J,” Tony huffs out as he dodges past a group of teenagers. “And send the Mark 35 along as well.”
— that he was validated not only by an alien weapon forged in the heart of a dying star, but also by his teammates, his
Bruce purses his lips to refrain from grinning, but he can’t help the snort that escapes him when Tony closes his eyes in exasperation. Fortunately for Bruce, Tony decides not to make a big fuss, although the physicist is amused when the engineer sighs deeply before grumbling under his breath about irresponsible Asgardians. Bruce takes a step back as Tony shuffles closer, and he sees how self-consciously the genius carries himself for a moment before he bends down to grasp the handle with his right hand. A moment later and he’s clutching Mjölnir in his hand.
going to need us, regardless of whether he says it or not. Like what Bruce mentioned earlier, we don’t know the extent of the damage the weapon has done to Tony, and until we get answers or a cure, I want each and every one of us to show his or her support in Tony’s road to recovery.”
Steve turns to look at Bruce in time to see the scientist open his mouth, only to close it again with a stunned expression.
There’s an awkward silence after that. Tony’s staring at his mug with an intensity as if it holds the answers to life’s questions while Steve remains quiet as he gathers his thoughts.
As they start to load their plates with roasted chicken, baked potatoes, and quinoa salad, Steve’s attention soon turns to the lively conversation of Thor recounting the best feasts he’s had in Asgard. He loses himself in the Asgardian’s exuberant storytelling, laughing along with the others as Steve momentarily forgets about Tony’s offhanded comment.
The thing is, Tony has so much love to give. But he doesn’t know how the fuck to do it and how to do it right. He has a poor judge of character, yes, but he also knows that when he meets the right person — or in this case,
Bruce shakes his head. “Not yet. He hasn’t got back to us with any report about that weapon that hit Tony, anyway. Let’s leave SHIELD as a last resort.”
Following the attack of an unknown species of alien from another dimension that even Thor doesn’t know the existence of (“I believe they traveled to Earth by accident,” the Asgardian prince said after the battle was won. “They most likely did not mean any harm, however the hostile reception they received said otherwise.”). If Steve were to describe what they looked like, he would say that they looked a cross between the
Actions speak louder than words, after all, so the ex-Russian spy deciding to help train Tony in hand-to-hand combat and not bringing up the enormous elephant in the room even once is a feat in and of itself.
“J, you’re a traitorous traitor and I’m donating you to Burger King tomorrow,” Tony gripes, but there’s no heat in his words.
“Stay safe,” Steve whispers, breath tickling Tony’s cheek as he continues to look fondly at the brunet.
Tony huffs out a laugh. It ends up sounding more like a sob, and the engineer is eternally grateful that his AI doesn’t say anything further.
part. There’s something niggling at the back of his mind upon hearing Pepper utter those words, but for some reason Tony is still unable to come up with an idea of
To recap, Steve recalls the moment when Tony got hit by an alien weapon (which Bruce is currently scanning using some updated tech that he and Tony developed, as far as the super soldier knew), when his whole suit of armor was surrounded by a blue light that lasted for about five seconds before the light disappeared and the engineer dropped to the ground like a sack of potatoes. The fact that Tony wasn’t propelled backwards upon impact when he was shot could probably mean that it was a deliberate hit.
It’s only when Steve’s lying on his bed twenty minutes later when it dawns on him that despite the circumstances, he reveled in the feeling of having Tony in his arms. He admits then that he likes it more than he initially thought.
“I doubt I’ll last a minute, Lightning McQueen,” Tony answers, nonplussed. Thor notes how the genius removes one of the boxing gloves to swipe a hand at the robot. It instantly relaxes its stance as Tony walks to the edge of the ring to guzzle down half the contents of a bottled water. “You have more chance sparring with Steve, though.”
The night something shifted in the team’s dynamics. The night Steve finally put a name to what he was feeling at the time.
He can feel Tony’s heavy gaze on him, but Bruce does his best to act nonchalant as he moves back to his table to clear up his workspace. He pretends he doesn’t hear Tony clear his throat again, pretends he doesn’t glimpse from the corner of his eye the way Tony inconspicuously swipes at his eyes. He pretends but deep down Bruce takes this moment as a learning curve.
Tony, the gracious host that he is, mingled with all of their guests first for the first hour. When Steve finally made his entrance (Tony and the others made sure to get the point across that the birthday celebrant must be fashionably late,
“You’re right. Thanks, Thor. That means a lot. We’ll only be able successfully help Tony if we do it together, so that’s what we should do, then.”
He notes the way Tony’s jaw clenches for a moment before forcing himself to relax. He still looks tense, body coiled as if ready to bolt at a moment’s notice, but despite that Bruce can also see that Tony’s shoulders have relaxed somewhat.
The super soldier shakes his head and states, “Honestly? This could’ve been avoided if I had been keeping a better eye on Tony in the first place.”
“Hey, Tony,” he says. “I couldn’t sleep, so I tried reading this book on, uh, beekeeping. Just to see if it’ll help me fall asleep.”
That’s all Tony wants, really. And in the distant part of his overactive mind, he wonders what it would be like to have his defenses peeled off like an onion, layer by layer, each revealing a part of Anthony Edward Stark no other human being has been privy to. That also includes Pepper and Rhodey, the two people who knows him the best among the rest.
But alright. Since he’s being so honest with himself right now, it doesn’t hurt to think that the real reason why he’s started writing this stupid list in the first place is because it’s Tony that he has to befriend. Tony, whom he’s butted heads with since the beginning and has proven Steve wrong about most, if not all, of his initial assumptions about the genius-billionaire after reading his file for The Avengers Initiative. There’s just
“Can you try to say something?” Bruce asks, sounding very much like the scientist he is. He’s leaning forward in his seat as he peers at Tony with intrigue. Then he quickly adds, “No pressure! You don’t have to if you don’t —”
Steve’s leaning forward in his seat, elbows resting on his knees as he listens attentively to Bruce’s narration. He belatedly notices that the others are in almost the same position as he is, though Clint is perched on the arm of the armchair that Natasha’s occupying.
This was never about Tony freaking out because he can wield Mjölnir. No, all this time Tony’s been suffering in silence because a sentient war-hammer has just told him that he’s worthy. Not just worthy to wield Mjölnir, no — but that he was recognized as a person of
Tony doesn’t hide a wince at the placid tone of his AI. A part of him thinks he’d rather hear the disappointed tone than this calm version, because at least he’d know JARVIS is reacting accordingly after Tony disabled him without a second thought.
Once his laughter subsides, Bruce ignores Tony’s flat look in favor of saying, “Any chance you can bring that up to the common area lest I break my neck next time?”
Tony sighs in relief and then closes his eyes when his head begins to throb painfully. He brings up his hands and massages his temples as he utters through gritted teeth, “J, tint the walls for me, too? The light is killing my eyes.”
Tony’s still blinking to get the sleep out of his eyes as he carefully sits up in bed. Bruce, who’s closest to him, doesn’t hesitate to reach out to assist the engineer before lifting the pillows a little higher to accommodate his back.
UPDATE: Thank you for pointing out that there's a missing text. I just fixed it and hope you re-read that part 'cause it's half a thousand words and provides some insight/information!
and — okay, so maybe he’s panicking a bit. Just a bit. “Easy on the alcohol, yeah? Don’t want any embarrassing videos being uploaded online! Fury’ll have a conniption!” He adds with a playful wink.
If possible, JARVIS’ voice turns drier as the AI says, “You shifted your checklist in order to prioritize the deadlines for Stark Industries as well as the repairs and upgrades for the team’s gear. It went from number three to number eighteen, sir.”
It was during one of Peter’s now frequent rampages that a particularly bad episode hit Tony. In an instant the innocent image of his baby daughter in her elephant themed infant floor seat (which Steve had picked because he thought it was cute and perfect for the non-powered baby girl) turned into an image of her bloody and mangled body.
“What?!” Tony cried, his entire body reaching out to his lover as if to implore him to reconsider. Not that the genius would ever do that…or at least not yet.
A burst of cheers erupted from the crowd and the circle that had held steady around them broke, people coming closer to congratulate them. Steve turned, hand still tied to Tony’s and forcing him to move as well. His arm pulled awkwardly for a moment before Steven moved his much longer arm closer to Tony, relieving some of the pressure.
Once he had finally forced his body to the door, Tony had quietly opened it and found Steve already laying beneath their covers but not yet asleep. Tony stepped in and closed the door delicately before making his way further into the room, stripping off pieces of his rather annoying suit as he went. He was just working off his tie when he reached Steve’s side of the bed and gently sat on the edge of it.
Tony walked decisively over to the bed and pulled back the blanket and furs. He wormed his way under the warm blankets, grateful that whatever servants had lit the candles in their room for the night hadn’t left the metal bed warmer under the covers. The weather was still teetering on the edge of summer and fall. If they had done anything more than run the hot coals under the sheets it would be too warm to stand. Tony pulled the blankets up and curled up as best he could, mentally preparing for whatever was to come.
Their party all started to dismount and make their way into the main building or several of the other smaller ones scattered around it. Tony, however, made no move to dismount. He was mesmerized by the building before him. The wooden exterior seemed to almost melt into the mountain as moved went back. The stone foundation of the building’s exterior seemed to almost be the mountain. Its stoned were far rougher and more natural looking that the stone foundations of the buildings in the villages. The wood itself was thick and sturdy, almost as if the trees had been left nearly whole before being molded into the building before him. In the center was a large door that was carved and painted with some sort of mythical scene that Tony lacked the context to understand fully.
“Its a torc.” Steve said, his hand coming up to feel his own silver necklace. “it is an exact match to mine. I had heard from my cousin that one of your family colors was gold, so I had my finest smith forge it in your metal.”
“I was and I am.” The man replied as the two of them walked back down the winding halls. “I’m an archer.”
Tony nodded. “I don’t forgive you yet,” He looked up at Steve. “but I’m willing to give you another chance.”
Tony, for his part, had encouraged Steve to go. He knew how bad it must be for their comrades to be unable to handle the situation on their own and he would not let them be put in unnecessary danger. Even if that meant allowing the love of his life to go back into a war zone without him being there to back him up.
Bruce reached his hands out again to take Tony’s rope and then his betrothed’s. Right, his name was Steven. That was the name of the adonis Tony was marrying, Steven. Damn. He was not going to mind their consummation at all, in fact he could hardly wait. If Tony had his way, their marriage bed would be a mess by the end of the night.
This action only resulted in Tony crying harder, but for a completely different reason. One that he was perfectly ok crying over.
Tony, having been giving the green light, dashed over to the closest computer and began searching through baby names. He had soon settled into t-names and a-names, going through pages and pages of names and speaking aloud the ones he liked best.
Tony finished undoing the ties and pulled off the stiff fabric. He laid it on the dresser next to his discarded crown and quickly pulled off his belt, pulling out his danger as he did so. He threw the belt next to the doublet and moved to sit on his side of the bed, placing the danger on the bedside table.
Tony managed to eat enough food to appease the red head apparently because she grabbed his hand and pulled him up out of his seat.
It was Natasha’s turn to pause. “that… that was a long time ago.” She looked back up at the head table, her eyes focused on her husband. “A different life.”
The Gaelic sounded natural coming out of Steven’s mouth in a way Tony feared would never be true for him. It was so different from the smoother rolling sounds of his own language and the sharper sounds sometimes had trouble forming properly in his mouth. Tony internally braced himself before speaking.
Tony, realizing that his lover had just handed him a metaphorical shovel to start digging himself out of the hole he had some how managed to drag himself into, grabbed the line Steve had just thrown him like his life depended on it.
Peter had, thankfully, come down from his ceiling perch for the time being and was currently in the arms of his "Uncle Thor". Steve and Tony (begrudgingly on Tony's part) were insistent on referring to all of their fellow avengers as Peter's Aunts and Uncles. Especially since neither of them had any blood family of their own for Peter to refer to by such titles.
The two of them stared each other down for a moment before grinning snidely at each other. Oh, Tony liked her.
The genius broke the kiss and started making his way towards Steve’s neck leaving a trail or kisses and sensual nips in his wake. Once Tony reached the place where his lover’s neck and shoulders connected, he gave a particularly hard bite, causing Steve’s sure fingers to falter on the small button he was currently attempting to undo. Steve could feel Tony’s smirk against his skin, but decided to ignore it in favor of undressing his lover.
Tony looked up expecting to see disappointment on Steve’s face, but instead he found that softness that absolutely could not be affection. It was far too soon for that. Lust Tony could understand, and felt plenty of. Affection was something you reserved for someone important, not for someone you were arranged to marry.
Steve was a good 5 minutes behind his teammates and had been tasked with looking through the remains of the buildings and directing anyone he found to the Shield evacuation points. There weren't many people left in the city, but Steve had managed to come across a good half a a dozen stragglers in his search.
Steven squeezed Tony’s hand before dropping it and taking his seat. Tony followed his lead. Once they were seated others began to find spots at the various tables and started to eat the array of food laid out before them. Tony ate a little bit of everything to try and get a feel for the food of his new home. It was all in the same genre of food he was familiar with; cheese, bread, meed, meats of various kinds, but they were different all the same.
Steve gave Tony a gentle smile as he gestured for Tony to sit. Tony stiffened, the gesture was innocent enough, but it had always come with the insinuation that Tony was weak and useless, unable to even sit on his own. He knew this was not the space to refuse it, even if Tony suspected his fiancé didn’t have the same intentions with the gesture that Tony’s father had. He kept his expression carefully blank as he took the offered seat. Only after he was settled did Steve move to sit in his own seat, but Tony was numb. He didn’t hear anything around him. He lost the train of conversation and the din of the sounds around him faded into a harsh buzz. It reminded him too much of other parties back home. Parties where he was just a prize to be shown off and traded for favors.
“She couldn’t…” Wanda started, looking at her twin brother hesitantly before continuing. “…she couldn't be developing a power could she?” Wanda asked worriedly.
Tony hummed in answer as he realized that he had already lost his way on their path from their rooms to the main hall. He was going to have to work on that.
Tony looked around and took in the intricate carvings on the stone wall in front of them. It curved up in a dome and met the thick wood that made up the rest of the building. This seem was decorated and reinforced with some metal braces.
The morning air was chilly. Their party was moving slowly down the path, the horses huffing in agitation at not going faster. Tony could just see Rhodey and another African man leading the pack from his and his fiancé’s place in the center of their party.
The super soldier somehow managed to seamlessly remove himself from beneath Tony and after grabbing his discarded clothing and redressing, he started to make his way towards the nursery that was only a few feet down the hall from the master bedroom. Tony just watched him go and huffed dramatically once his lover had left him alone on their bed, high and dry. This was not over! Not at all!
“Its lovely, but I’m not sure what it means.” Tony said regretfully. “I am not as familiar with your traditions as I would like to be.”
Steve pulled Tony down the same stone hallway his mother and uncle has just disappeared into. The path curved slowly as they moved deeper into the mountain. They walked for several minuted before coming to a large wooden door. It had silver and gold metal decoration covering it and twisting together into intricate designs.
Steve reached down and took Tony’s hand again. “I’ll show you to our quarters and then give you a tour.”
He felt rather than heard the metal thing land right behind him. In an instant a comforting metal clad hand was on Steve's back and the warm and decidedly guilty voice of his lover was in his ear.
“Peter.” King T’Challa chastised firmly. “Minister Ku means you and your sister no harm. Isn’t that right minister Ku?” King T’Challa declared, turning the full force of his authoritative and protective gaze on the old man.
Tony gazed down at the length or woven rope he held in his hand. It was the colors of his house woven together in a twisting pattern. Thor and his family had accompanied Tony on the voyage from the continent to the “green isle” as Thor had called it and had given Tony the rope he’d had crafted then. Thor and King Steven, who Tony was engaged to marry, were cousins and Thor had insisted that as his self proclaimed “Celtic brother” he must accompany Tony beyond the sea and ensure Tony’s honor was maintained by the engagement turning into a marriage. It was just the sort of thing that Tony had come to expect from the Nordic Celts. Tony loved them dearly, but sometimes their culture still confused him. Much like this rope thing confused him.
Tony smiled as he stepped out into the hall and gently closed the door behind him. The smile quickly fell when his eyes landed on Steve again.
“Beautiful.” Steve said, fingers following the curve of the necklace just above Tony’s skin. Never quite touching, but hinting at it.
“Come. I want to get the know my future husband and that is rather difficult with all this noise.” Steven said loudly so as to be heard over the laughter of the partiers.
Steve gasped slightly as the cold air hit his now fully erect penis. Tony’s mouth made its way back to Steve’s ear, the smirk back on that infuriating mouth.
“What?” Tony whined while leaning down to place his exhausted daughter in her crib. “Its not like she can understand anything I'm saying.”
Steve slowly and carefully climbed over a pile of rubble, his right hand securely on the back of Peter's head to try and keep the baby steady. Peter, however, was making a point of remaining anything but still and was currently alternating between throwing his cheerios at anything he could see and eating them.
Tony took a deep breath before speaking. “Very well. Lord Commander Rhodes will assign you your post. Now I think I will retire.”
Tony’s eyes roamed over the country side they were riding through. It really was beautiful. The colors were so different from his own home. They were darker, richer. The forest was alive in ways Tony had never experienced before. It was also like it was a living, breathing, entity.
Steve smiled down at him. “Yes, it does. My great grandsire founded the city. This mountain is full of caves and he chose and expand this one for his home.”
“Only if you swear the same.” Steve replied in a desperate voice. He knew that if Tony left him alone he would never be abel to bear it. He wouldn’t survive it. At least not completely. He might be able to endure for his children, maybe. But even then, he wasn't sure how long he could live without Tony.
“I’m just gonna… go,” he belated hears Tony speak. Then, carefully depositing Mjölnir face down beside the coffee machine, the engineer beats a hasty retreat, leaving one very confused — and very shell-shocked — archer.
Steve just shakes his head as he chuckles when Tony raises his pinky, a shit-eating grin gracing the engineer’s face when he sees Steve’s face light up.
-lievable. Yeah, you know what? I don’t think you're Jarvis at all. Besides, this is all in my head, right? I’m probably making this all up ‘cos I’m all on my own in this shit hole —”
The elderly woman meets his gaze, heedless that she can’t see his eyes. Still, she smiles at Tony as if he’s her favorite grandchild, and the genius is unable to hide the choked noise he makes when a wrinkled hand comes up to pat his cheek. The phantom ache in his chest eases a fraction at the affectionate gesture.
? What a joke! I’m a fucking mess, a walking disaster, and a royal pain in everyone’s ass. If anything, I’m the last person who’d be deemed worthy of anything.”
There was a lull in their conversation, albeit a comfortable one, only to be broken by Tony who requested JARVIS to “drop his needle”. It isn’t until Steve hears the familiar riffs of a song the genius frequently listens to in his workshop that he understands what he meant by that phrase.
to do more.” Tony licks his lips, and he lifts his head to look at the sun setting on the horizon. His companion remains quiet, patient. “And the… people in my life who care for me… say that what I do is more than enough. That I have more than made up for it. But I don’t think that I do. And I also know that some people, er, think otherwise. That I don’t deserve the second chance I got. Because they have a preconceived notion about me based on past behavior and such. I mean, they didn’t
“Hulk is excited,” Bruce comments offhandedly before the sound of Hulk roaring comes a second later.
“Hey, babycakes,” Tony greets with a grin, ignoring Peter’s groan. “What brings you to our humble abode?”
way, as if I’m some dung stuck on the sole of their shoe. I know that none of you like me — I mean, we’re not even friends — and I’ve come to accept that.
“For the record,” Steve adds, eyes boring into Tony’s with earnestness. He squeezes the latter’s fingers a second time, pleasantly surprised when Tony squeezes back with a wavering smile. With a deep breath, he finally decides to lay down all his cards on the table. “The only version I want you to be is already standing in front of me. I like you, and want you, just as you are.”
Steve smiles at him and nods, looking pleased that Tony’s finally deciding to sleep, regardless that it’s only past three in the afternoon. Oh, well, it’s not like Tony doesn’t have fucked up sleeping habits, anyway.
time, Steve clears his throat and not-so-casually walks over to the closest worktable to hide the evidence of his arousal.
In that moment, Steve had the sudden urge to take Tony in his arms again, while simultaneously wanting to hunt down every single person who’s wronged the engineer in the past. Then, thinking that Steve’s part of
Pepper and Bruce snort almost simultaneously. A peculiar look crosses over Tony's face before it clears and he purses his lips in thought.
There are brief moments when Steve is consumed with his love for Tony, and sometimes he doesn’t know how
Clint shrugs and puts and his hands up. “Hey, I’m not gonna judge you if that’s what you’re thinking. Just, uh, is making that list really necessary? We’re not in pre-school anymore, y’know.”
There’s a heavy pause before he hears Bruce make a frustrated noise. Steve doesn’t like the sound of that.
Jarvis answers in the negative, and Tony sighs loudly in relief. Next, he considers what his AI previously suggested. It takes another few minutes for him to weigh his options before he makes a decision.
“Just that I underestimated how deep your guilt complex goes,” Natasha remarks, causing the archer to blink at the redhead and for Steve to flush slightly.
Bruce hums, a small smirk gracing his features. “I’d say ‘I’ll drink to that’, but I’m afraid if I take even a small sip of alcohol now I’ll pass out.”
It takes another two days before Tony’s released from medical. Fortunately, it so happened that Steve and the rest of the team (minus Bruce who was with Tony down in med bay) were in the communal kitchen for brunch, so when the two scientists arrive at the common area, Steve doesn’t hesitate to gesture them over to join them at the dining table.
“What the hell, man?” Clint demands after several moments. He peers doubtfully at the engineer, who is yet to look up from his bowl of decimated oatmeal. “Stark, this is the same weapon that fucking hit you and knocked you out for three days before you
“I seriously didn’t need a mental image of Hulk’s nether regions,” Steve slightly reprimands Tony, but he knows he looks mischievous because Tony’s laughter soon subsides to chuckles.
However, he can also read between the lines just fine, and Steve’s perfectly aware that it’s not only the mother hen attitude Tony was referring to when he pointed out that they’ve been doing this song and dance for years. It’s also the shameless flirting, the blatant displays of affection (he’s lost count how many kisses on the cheek he’s received; but he’s also lost count how many hugs he’s given), the ridiculous pet names (Tony often calls him ‘honey’ while Steve likes to use ‘babe’, much to the their teammates’ exasperation), and the inevitable way they always gravitate to each other whenever they’re in the same room.
With Thor, Steve described him at first as a child trapped in an adult man’s body. But lo and behold, the Asgardian turns out to offer more wisdom and insight to the team as much as he consumes pop tarts on a daily basis.
The pressing weight in Steve’s stomach returns full force upon hearing Tony’s current condition. He bites his lower lip and trades concerned glances with the others before thanking JARVIS for the heads up.
Whoa, okay. That sounded a lot dirtier than Tony intended, but thankfully the accidental innuendo goes unnoticed by Steve. Instead, the super soldier blinks in surprise before he eyes Tony with a heartfelt look.
I want to help, Clint,” Tony states through gritted teeth. “But I’m not at my 100% capacity right now, and I’d rather not jeopardize Bruce’s work if I make a mistake. Also,” he adds, and Steve doesn’t miss the slight tremor in Tony’s voice. His voice is strangled, heavy with emotion that causes the pressing weight in Steve’s stomach to resurface as the engineer continues. “I have a name —
that he completely misses to see the slight shaking in Tony’s hands as he pours the steaming liquid into his mug. Clint, clearly dumbfounded at the sight of his very human friend clutching an alien god’s weapon in his other hand, continues to openly gawk at the sight, mouth hanging open and all.
Tony looks over his shoulder to wink at him, and he catches sight of the super soldier flushing slightly at the gesture. He’s about to reach the elevator, the doors already open and waiting for him to enter, when he hears Steve’s voice call out to him again.
Tony shrugs.“Fair enough. Then Fury and his minions would’ve done the same. It’s SHIELD who found you, after all.”
“Sometimes, Tony, the answer you need is right in front of you. How about, for once, you do something that doesn’t require spending money? Or building something? Especially when it comes to Steve, I think he tends to lean towards the ‘it’s the thought that counts’ notion. Just think about it, okay?”
, I just need to figure it all out. The sooner JARVIS and I start, the sooner I can give us all answers.”
“Thanks, JARVIS,” Steve answers the AI, gratitude evident in his tone. “Your support will definitely make things a lot easier for us. Speaking of,” he adds as an afterthought. He checks his watch, shocked to see that it’s already gone past six in the evening. “Is Tony still asleep?”
He takes a tentative step forward, only realizing that the “ground” beneath him is warm to the touch. Taking a few more steps ahead, he flexes his toes next to get a feel of the texture of the floor, and he’s mildly surprised to find out that it’s similar to a tartan track.
He shuffles inside his room and makes a beeline to his en suite where he proceeds to turn on the shower, setting the water to hot. Next, he carefully strips off his clothes, the almost week-old pajamas pooling at his feet. He gets inside the shower stall, sliding the door closed behind him as he does so, and Tony groans in relief when the scalding water cascades over his body. He feels the chill that’s been residing in his chest since waking up from an odd dream the day before begin to alleviate, albeit little by little. After several minutes, he decides to lather his body with soap, taking his time with scrubbing away the sweat and grime from being in the med bay for nearly a week.
