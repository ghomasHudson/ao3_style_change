He placed Loki on the kitchen counter so he could watch him while he prepared breakfast. A healthy meal, consisting of a boiled egg, toast, a piece of fruit and some fresh orange juice for the both of them. Some might agree that it was slightly better than a can of energy drink.
Steve turned on the shower, waiting patiently for it to warm while undressing. He was happy to be home again, to just slumber on his slightly warn-down couch and watching a game of football after eating dinner. His apartment was not big, nor was it luxurious, but it was home.
‘Uhm, dad? Pa?’ Peter quickly shouted up the stairs, knowing that things were about to get serious when the two would be calling each other by their last name. ‘You guys okay?’
1. After being tasered by Thor right before their escape from Sakaar, Loki is found by the Grandmaster who takes him back in. With his hands now full on Ragnarok and his fellow Avengers who broke up like the Beatles, Thor decides to send Loki some unexpected help to escape from Sakaar. (a GrandmasterxLoki and LokixQuill story)
‘Peter! Brother!’ Thor called out, waving at the two to come closer. ‘Look, the trail, it ends here.’
The heat burned his skin, turning it a livid shade of red starting at his shoulders. The pain was welcome though as it helped to distract him from the horrid images that were saved on Steve’s memory.
‘So it seems,’ Thor grumbled, his eyes then falling on the Winter Soldier who was standing in the distance.
‘If you want to-’ Steve started cautiously, causing the teen to turn around. ‘You could… sleep in my bed. We’ll switch. Or, if you want me to stay…’ He smiled weakly. ‘Your call.’
Oh! And I also have a new idea for a stony fic. One with wraiths, blood, gore and so much hurt <3 (easy brain! One fic at a time!)
‘Fancy words for a bot,’ Tony stepped forward and grinned against the doll’s lips, his goatee prickling the other’s skin. ‘You are one amazing piece of machinery you know that, Rogers? I have to admit, can’t wait to get my hands on you. Both in bed and on my workshop table.’ He waited a little impatiently for the bot to react, ‘Come on, doll. Show me what you’ve got.’ He placed his hands on top of Steve’s and guided them to rest on his hips, his voice husky as he whispered in the machine’s ears; ‘Provide me with carnal pleasure.’
‘No, no, no, please, do not try again,’ Thor quickly intervened, taking the weapon from his brother’s hands. ‘And you,’ he then turned to the Winter Soldier, ‘please do not teach my eight-year-old brother how to assassinate people with a knife.’
The two then fell completely silent as they looked at each other, their heavy emotions fading as well. Thor quickly let go of Loki’s arm, noticing how his strong grip had already started bruising the raven’s skin.
‘I fear I know…’ Steve’s jaw set tight as a fierce anger started to burn in his eyes. ‘Stane is not a good man, Peter. He takes people; men, women, children, and brings them down here. Locks them up.’ He stared at the empty cot on the other end of the room. ‘Most of them don’t stay long…’
‘And what do you want me to do?’ Sam asked as Natasha went back to her own desk and Tony grabbed his coat.
Thor looked up in surprise first but then smiled as he pressed his lips against his brother’s temple, ‘That is a great idea, Loki.’
‘I agree with Peter,’ Thor nodded. ‘Brother, I strongly advise you to go upstairs and create this anti-potion,
It must have been satisfying news, for a smug grin returned on Stane’s face once more. ‘Looks like they found him, doll.’
‘… Brother…?’ Loki whispered, softly poking the teen’s ribs with the tip of the stick, ‘Have you truly come to pass…?’
Loki moved towards the stranger without a sound, standing next to him and trying to understand the man’s scribbles and calculations. ‘Hi.’
‘And what is it that… t-that thou art in search of, o great warrior?’ the teen stammered, trying to guess what Asgardian English would sound like.
‘But Thor did not want to part from Loki, and that’s where you stepped in.’ Steve figured as he fiddled with a pen. He continued after Pepper nodded, ‘Miss Potts, what is your relation to Mister Killian?’
‘I, I can’t’ Tony said as he took a step back. ‘I can’t do this, I don’t know what say and I only feel like singing and I’m not-’
Steve sighed, but nodded. He always preferred to keep children out of these matters and he didn’t have any reasons to talk with Loki specifically. Not now, anyway. ‘We will leave you be,’ he gave Thor a genuine smile, causing the blond to uncomfortably smile back, somewhat. ‘Would you please ask Mister Barnes and Miss Potts to come to the police station as soon as they can?’
‘Sit!’ Steve’s voice echoed through the small interrogation room, low and dominating. He waited for both his partner and the suspect to sit down again before continuing. ‘You said that you hardly ever spoke to Killian, but we did our research and discovered that he was trying to get you and the others out of the mansion.’ He looked up at Bucky, waiting for a response, but the man kept his mouth shut.
‘I’m not really allowed to drink yet…’ Peter pouted, looking at the bubbles in his glass that slowly moved to the surface.
‘Hm?’ Loki looked up, now meeting the gazes of the others. ‘I, I am fine.’ He then grabbed the sweets from his pocket and placed them on the grass in front of him, holding one for himself. ‘Alright, listen, one of us will have to make sure that the captain will eat this candy. Either convince him to take it or shove it down his throat, it matters not, as long as he consumes it.’ The raven then looked at Tony, ‘Considering you are his lover both in your new… princess life and old life, I suggest you try to make Steven eat.’
‘What up, kid?’ Falcon said, trying his best to address Loki for what he now was, a young child, instead of a arrogant Asgardian god.
‘That’s better,’ Stane sighed irritably. ‘Looks like you still need some tweaking…’ he muttered as he walked closer while sending a text message on his phone. ‘The guys from the lab are on their way. Lay here and wait for them. Do as they say, got it?’
The god placed a hand on his face as he sighed deeply, then rubbed the bridge of his nose as he looked at his little brother.  ‘Loki, this man came here with good intention.’ But as Loki kept staring at him with a doubtful expression, the blond continued. ‘He… he tried to help you with the spell that has befallen you.'
‘You have indeed grown rather fond of our Midgardian friends, have you not?’ As Loki nodded, Thor continued with a content sigh, ‘Well, that is good to hear. Sleep well, little brother.’
Steve had been human. Yet the creature was nothing more but a doll. Incapable of feeling, incapable of suffering.
‘Oops…’ Loki mumbled softly as he covered his mouth with his hand, staring at the soldier with wide eyes. He then looked at the frying pan in his hand and quickly hid it behind his back. ‘I am so sorry mister Barnes…’
‘Oh, right, sorry,’ Peter smiled and cleared his throat, ‘I, Spider-Lord-King, and my eight-legged horse will guard these stones to infinity! And beyond!’
‘It will be finished within five minutes,’ the trickster said and quickly disappeared up the stairs.
‘Rogers,’ Fury called the man’s name just before Steve wanted to walk out of the office. ‘I’m gonna give you twenty-four hours, nothing more.’ He sighed deeply as he saw Steve’s innocent smile. ‘Get out, Rogers.’
‘That is just absolutely terrific,’ Thor managed to conjure an awkward smile on his face. ‘I cannot wait for the next family reunion on Asgard…’
‘So, it was just an accident after all?’ Tony smirked and he looked at Sam, holding up his hand in which his coworker reluctantly handed him the twenty bucks.
He strolled past the bookshelves, his heart beating loudly in his chest as he saw how some of the books were locked behind chains. He mumbled up some of the titles he saw.
‘Come in,’ he welcomed the doll with open arms. ‘Careful though, don’t want to step on your fellow bots.’ He chuckled a little nervously as DUM-E moved up to inspect the newcomer.
Steve was taken slightly aback by the playboy’s kind consideration. Running out of energy was always a terrifying experience, as if all life slowly vanquished from his body, leaving him cold and fearful for he did not know when or even
‘Is Mister Barnes your chauffeur?’ Tony asked as he closed the door of the office, the three of them now sitting together in Steve’s small but practical office room.
‘No, sir. Scans indicate that the intruder is male and between the age of fourteen to seventeen. The clothes enable me to identify him.’
and out-of-character performance, the god of thunder stared breathlessly at the man. The bright, and most of all, charming smile on Tony’s face as he turned towards the god again made him shiver.
‘Peter!’ Cassie wanted to follow the teen, tears already flooding her eyes. She stepped forward but stopped with a gasp as Stane’s hand wrapped around her wrist. ‘Let me go!’
‘P-please unhand me,’ Loki managed to speak between chocked up sobs. ‘I-I am a prince of Asgard! You will come to regret it if you put me through any harm!’
‘What? This? You really can’t tell?’ Peter looked up in surprise, a pouting expression threatening to form on his face. He then looked up in excitement, holding up a hand as he searched his pockets. ‘You’re right, I almost forgot!’ He pulled a pair of sunglasses out of his left pocket and put them on. ‘Ta-dah!’
The two stayed at the bottom of the stairs till Peter had no more tears to shed, a high pitched noise catching their attention. peter looked up from the blond’s chest, which was now damp with his tears.
Loki’s eyes widened and he looked at this older brother, ‘Thor, may I go to this super market with sir Quill and Peter? Please?’
‘Looking good, Loki,’ Peter smiled. ‘Wanne go play outside? We could play catch or football or something.’
The teen sat down on the cot next to Steve, nodding slowly as his eyes remained red. He waited desperately for him to explain.
‘Yes, you were! I heard you talking to my brother!’ Loki said, sniffing a couple of times. ‘You wanted to curse me!’
‘Obie adopted you?’ Worry started to brew in Tony’s chest as the teen became very quiet. ‘But he told me you- you are his
Steve cautiously walked in, eyes charting the entire room, admiring every little gadget Tony had been working on. Trusting his master’s words he ventured further, looking at all the strange technology and weapons which were either carefully displayed or carelessly scattered across the floor.
Loki took hold of the Widow’s hand, making sure not to let go as he did what he was told, following the red-haired woman into the lounge room.
‘Does that mean we will play together and grow up together?’ The raven asked while Steve pulled him on his lap and in his arms, a chocolate mustache already above his lip.
He looked at that oaf again, an abrupt feeling of deep affection washing over him. Thor was kind to him, Thor would protect him, Thor would do anything for him. Loki quickly averted his eyes as a light pink blush colored his alabaster skin, wondering where this sudden realization of fondness came from.
‘Verily,’ Thor nodded as he adjusted himself in his seat. ‘A spell backfired, he is a child now.’ He then frowned, ‘Wait, why are you asking this? Is it because he is still on your watchlist of, of beings who are a threat to this word?’
‘Something the matter, brother?’ Thor asked as he saw Loki looking at the empty glasses in disappointment.
‘Well, first off, we can keep a better eye on him. Secondly, he gets a second chance at his childhood, which, I believe, is something we should be happy with. You know, considering he became such a vengeful person with all the daddy issues and the way he has been lied to his entire life and what not.’ Strange looked up at the god, noticing how the man was now glaring at him with a very dark expression. He blinked his eyes but as the heavy sound of thunder became audible in the far distance, he quickly continued, ‘Look, I’m not trying to be an ass or anything, just stating facts. Your brother can be raised anew and grow up to be all happy and loving, just like he is at this moment. Isn’t that something you wanted?’
‘Can you guys please stop looking so down for a second? You’re scaring away my costumers.’ An old man on the other side of the bar leaned on the counter. His eyes were hardly visible behind his tainted glasses and his white moustache merely showed a moody mouth. ‘You guys pouting over that Killian case?’
‘Yeah, that.’ Peter nodded, a melancholic smile then forming on his face. ‘You will become a very powerful god, Loki. You just… just need to sort your priorities on how to use those powers, you understand what I’m trying to say?’
‘…I am a machine,’ Steve voice was filled with remorse. He remembered Stane scolding him for even daring to catch his breath in his bed after chocking him during sex till his vision clouded with black spots. A sex machine should never sleep under the same covers as its master, the never fading scars on his back a constant reminder of this hard-learned lesson. ‘Sleeping in the same bed would be… inappropriate. However, if it is what you want I will not refuse.’
‘It is quite alright, Man of Spiders.’ Thor assured with a smile. ‘I am just happy to hear my brother had such a good time with you.’
‘Most likely,’ Steve offered his jacked, which was clearly to big for Tony. ‘Or maybe it’s just karma.’
‘I do not want to go to bed, Thor, please!’ The raven begged as he let himself fall face-first on the couch, mumbling something which his older brother could not hear.
‘I, am, exhausted.’ Peter sighed as he walked into the living room, dropping his bag on the floor and letting himself fall face first into the couch.
‘Ant-man…’ Loki repeated, he looked at Peter and then back at Scott again. ‘Have you been eating ants when you were little?’ he asked in a suspicious whisper, squinting his eyes slightly.
Also, has anyone ever heard/seen The Blair Witch Project movie?? It makes a small references as well... Movie worth watching btw!
“It’s the most important meal of the day…”  Tony quoted with a smile, inspecting the way the edges of the batter stopped bubbling first.
“OW!!!- -god… hangonasecond…”  Tony staggered back a step, and held onto the corner of the engine compartment with one white-knuckled hand until he could open his eyes again.
though, and Tony had gotten to dance with her.  One of the finest, classiest, most beautiful women he’d ever met, and the
Tony fired both hand-repulsors, aiming for the joints of War Machine’s otherwise thick shoulder-armor, and broke loose.  He hovered twelve feet up and rained down electromagnetic
“Oh, this-?”  Tony glanced down the front of his nominally white A-line, and tapped the scratched black cover that hid his arc reactor from public view.  “-It’s a battery for my pacemaker.  I took some shrapnel in ‘Nam, and this keeps my heart beating unless I forget to charge it,” he joked.
Steve darted into the alleyway beside the garage, and up the fire escape of the building next door to the rooftops.  Down in the garage, he found Tony looking thoughtfully at a stilled clock sitting on the same shelf as the striker for his propane torch.
The radio parts -inside- were another story, and it had only been by canning pieces from both shattered radios that he’d gotten the right-hand one working again.  The left would have to wait until he could get to a radio shack or a pawn shop or something.
‘As a matter of fact, I have.’ Thor chuckled as he looked at Rhodes, who met his gaze with a scoffing smirk. ‘Now listen, Loki, I was thinking,’
Also i'm planning on writing 2 short Thorki PWP fic and after that, there will be a FrostSpider (loki-Peter) fic....
‘Oh, but detective,’ Tony sighed dramatically, placing the back of his hand against forehead. ‘You have to listen to me, for I have a confession to make.’ He then placed his hands against Steve’s bared chest and pressed their bodies together, his fingers slowly trailing down the man’s skin to his abs.
‘Wanda Maximoff, twenty-three years old, born and raised in Sokovia, a small and corrupted country in Europe as I already told you earlier,’ Sam continued as he had researched the other two during Steve’s chat with Fury. ‘Mother deceased, father unknown and her brother, Pietro Maximoff, was shot dead by the cops after robbing a super market for food. Wanda was devastated after losing him and turned to all kinds of witch craft and voodoo rituals in hopes to come into contact with him, however,’ Sam took a deep breath and sighed sadly, ‘apparently Sokovia is a very superstitious nation and she quickly became known as the “Scarlett Witch”. People thought she was dangerous, wanted to kill her and that’s why she fled her country.’
‘Of course not,’ The billionaire quickly retorted, taking the alcohol his friend offered. ‘It just- It all so realistic, and Steve, he- he really freaked out and-’
‘Loki,’ Peter said as he cautiously held on to the trickster’s hand, their fingers intertwining, ‘does this mean that you…?’
‘I am a machine, master,’ Steve wanted to look up, yet kept his gaze to the floor as he remembered how disgusted Tony was with his eyes. ‘I can’t lie.’
‘No, wait!’ Peter shouted as Obadiah slammed the door shut, Cassie’s screams now muffled and far away. He panted softly, tears forming in his eyes as cold air crept into his fingers. ‘No… No! Wait, come back! Please! I’m sorry! I-’ The teen yelped, his ankle sending a wave of pain up his leg as he tried to get back on his feet. ‘Don’t leave me…’ he cried softly as he had no idea what he had done wrong. ‘Please… I’m so sorry…’
‘Yeah yeah, just one last thing,’ Tony wanted to start a whole new project but stopped as he felt the doll’s hands resting on his shoulders, his body close against his back.
‘I… don’t know, exactly, but…’ he moved his hand through his hair, resting it at the back of his neck with a soft hiss. ‘You have to understand, this is not a normal home. This is a research facility.’ He looked Peter straight in the eye, nothing but honesty in his deep blue eyes. ‘And we are the guinea pigs.’
Rhodey perked up from outside Tony’s bedroom door and glared at the god. Loki gave the centaur a cool once over in response.
“Tony! Wait!” Steve called but Thor grabbed the blonde and held him back. Steve gave Thor a questioning look but the god only gave a small ‘no’ head shake.
Afterwards they stayed like that. Foreheads pressed together, eyes closed and their bodies shaking as they came down from their high. Eventually Steve’s erection subsided and became soft inside the brunette. Tony moved his hips a bit and some of the blonde’s cum drained out of him.
Rhodey had needled the god about missing them; but Loki had retorted that Rhodey would need them to come back to work. And Tony would of course want a break from the insufferable land of the living every now and then, and he would always have his room in Hel open to him. Loki had also brought up Fenrir and Jörmungandr but Rhodey had tuned him out and just kept giving an over-the-top nod of understanding, which he knew frustrated Loki to no end.
“Actually, I have to agree. I’m not a huge fan of that name.” Sam added and Clint gave a triumphant noise.
“You even stuffed the nooks in the windows, good.” He commented as he placed the box he brought with him on the table.
“Yeah...” Tony drawled with a roll of his eyes. He then took a few steps back “Well as fun as this game of interrogation and threats is,” He inclined his head towards Bucky and Natasha. “I’m gonna go.”
“Ok Fenrir, here’s the plan.” The brunette explained. “You go back home right now and next time I’m there I’ll give you your favorite treats!” Fenrir yipped happily at the plan, then with one last lick bounded away.
“Greetings mortal!” Thor boomed, then grabbed Tony’s arm in greeting. “I am Thor, god of Thunder and Fertility.” He then gestured to the room behind him “Come! Let us partake in the food and wine we have out for your visit!”
But Bucky grabbed Sam’s sword and pointed it at the brunette. In response, Tony only glared and folded his arms -clearly unimpressed.
“Oh gods you’re right!” Tony exclaimed in a faux tone. He dramatically brought a hand up to his chest and put on an anguished face. “And I didn’t ask for your permission before speaking. My goodness how have you put up with me?”
“Huh?” They had all been discussing their favorite style of chiton, so the abrupt change of topics threw a few of them through a loop.
“Uh Steve,” Erskine interrupted. “You have to undress.” He gestured to Steve’s chiton. “Otherwise it’ll rip and just be in the way.”
1. Clint and Natasha have joined the party, hurray! I know it was kinda rushed at the end but ‘eh I like it enough.
“The Mists of Knowledge has ensnared them. They’ll be stuck in there forever” Rhodey looked all around to see if there was anyway he could cross Styx quickly to save the mortals.
The person gave the 13 year old a strange look, and glanced around. “...good.” They answered cautiously then began to walk faster “Have a good day.”
Clint laughed at the memory of this morning. “Remember Steve’s face when I suggested he just throw Tony over his shoulder and drag him to bed?” The group laughed at the memory.
Tony had only met Jean Grey as a shade and her being unstable was a mild way of putting it. She seemed to be in constant battle with herself but always seemed to enjoy spreading chaos. Giant Man was a Hero Tony had known growing up. He was a brave warrior who’s accomplishments in battle were known far and wide. He towered over most people and had more strength than the average man, making him a Hero of epic proportions. When he had died his soul had put up such a fuss Loki had to attend to it. Tony had trailed along, excited about meeting a real life -err dead- hero. Giant Man turned out to be a huge disappointment. He had demanded entrance to Valhalla / the Elysian Fields (“Whatever it’s called just guide me there! I have more than earned that right!”). Loki had then explained there was no Valhalla / Elysian Fields and Giant Man had gone into a rage. (“I wouldn’t have done all that bullshit if I knew there was no reward!”).  Both Giant Man and Jean Grey’s souls were in the Canyon of Regretful Souls, solidifying Tony’s opinion that heros were just like all mortals. Selfish, untrustworthy, and fake.
They went to an area on the island that was the least littered with decrepit statues and trees. Steve laid on the ground and Bucky sat next to him and offered his hand which Seve grabbed.
Tony had a rougher start with Steve’s friends. Natasha Romanoff and Tony had actually met before, when she moonlighted at Stark Industries. Safe to say, she did not have a high opinion of him having only seen his Starktm face and attitude. However after getting to know Tony as a person, she came around. Bucky had not liked Tony, when questioned he said Tony just rubbed him the wrong way. However, for Steve’s sake he was civil to the man and only openly complains to his boyfriend Sam Wilson and Natasha. Sam had been a shining ray in Tony’s world when he first met Steve’s friends. The man’s easygoing attitude and easy friendship were direly needed and appreciated. Clint Barton was the other friend that easily took a shine to Tony.
interested!” He was now in the garden with the Avengers. “I was talking out loud about how to get him to like me!” Steve flushed and the others winced at the chariot-wreck that was this confrontation. “But apparently in your concussed mind that’s me hunting him!”
“Then you should come down more often.” Loki retorted his eyes still scanning the scroll in his hands.
“Sam Wilson, and I’m happy to help. Thor filled me in briefly about your situation.” Sam’s eyes took on a sympathetic look. “I’m sorry about your intended.” Steve’s eyes flitted away but he gave a firm nod of appreciation.
“I didn’t think that blasted fool would actually accept my offer.” Loki admitted “But I couldn’t back out of my word. So I tried to get him out.” Loki swallowed then glared at Thor. “And then you all ruined it!”
2. I’d love to do snaps, or episodes of Tony growing up in Hel. I have so many ideas in my head already (esp involving Jörmungandr and Fenrir) but this chapter was long enough and it would distract from the point. So that’s for another posting.
Steve bit his lip and looked out at the water wistfully. “I once wanted a life off of the sea. A house right on the coast line.” Steve seemed to be in his own fantasy and Tony couldn't seem to look away from his face. Which meant he didn’t notice the way the blonde was twirling the two rings on his one finger. “But now, when I look at it. I just feel...useless.”
“I’ll come visit you on my days off. I better use up all my vacation days, I doubt they get paid out upon departure.” He joked and Tony chuckled and some of his nerves eased.
1. Ana Jarvis is amazing and I wish we saw more of her in Marvel. I didn’t really have a place to add her but I wanted it to be known that she was part of Tony’s life. Not as much as Jarvis, but she was there when he needed her.
“If you are trying to rile me up I would advise against it.” Loki seethed as he glared at Amora who smiled guileslly.
“Don’t do this Tony. Don’t fall for this again.” Loki said in a pleading tone, and that set Tony’s anger off.
Fenrir climbed off Tony and growled at the Avengers, going back into an aggressive stance. The Avengers likewise regripped their weapons.
“Don’t be dramatic.” Loki teased, coming out of his closet in nothing but his small clothes. “I simply tidied up my chambers a bit.”
2. Tony’s just teasing about the Father thing. Growing up Rhodey was the fun older bro to Tony, Loki the temperamental but tries to be a parent bro, and Jarvis the actual parent.
“But then Loki went on that tangent about Thor just mentioning his past dead lover in a conversation. They’re definitely not a threat but Loki still got angry over it.” Amora glared harder.
“Tony,” Steve began softly, rubbing circles on their clasped hands. “I know we didn’t start off great. And I’ve probably shown you the worst in me already but…” He looked over Tony’s face as if taking stock of every detail. Then in a sincere and firm yet gentle tone he continued. “I want you to know. I would never,
“You want to become a True Hero to get your love back, yes?” Steve nodded his assent. “And then what? You have all this power and the girl, what will you do then?”
“Please, we’d all feel better if you used it.” Steve assured as he started placing some of the fabrics in/on the carriage.
“You need to use a sword!” Bucky cried, once again gesturing to his hip where his sword was fastened.
“...Yeah, and no it wasn’t him.” He said slowly, “I saw them and they were just some guys.” He hung the furs up and glanced back to see Loki pout at his fantasy being destroyed.
However the story didn’t end there. Later the king urged Sam to go deliver something to a local ruler about a day's journey away. Sam had gone, but with his wings, was able to cut the time in half. Upon his return he found Riley tied to a stone about to be devoured by a sea monster. Sam distracted the monster long enough for the princess to free Riley. Riley then ran to grab his shield and sword and joined Sam in slaying the monster
“About a monster not being a monster? Tony, not everyone understands or is willing to understand Monsters like you do! And no one knows you so they won’t take your word or ours over their opinion. The Queen won’t back us, she barely speaks as is.” He stopped himself from slamming his hands down in frustration. “It’s not perfect. I’m not happy about it either but…”
“I do not doubt that.” Thor said and patted Bucky on the arm. “But I feel it’s best if I talk with him on your behalf.”
“Though it is odd the guy has a statue of Lord Loki.” Clint mused as he shovelled eggs into his mouth. Natasha smacked his arm for talking with his mouth full. “Ow! Damn woman!”
“Maybe it was an underworld trick?” Natasha wondered. “They say the underworld is filled with traps and pitfalls to make sure no living soul makes it out of here alive.”
“If we become True Hero’s will we get a boon as well?!” Clint asked, excitement lighting up his eyes.
Bucky gave him a startled look and mouthed “what are you doing?”. Steve spared him a glance then looked back at the god of the Dead and made his case.
“Steve is a glory hound!” He stated firmly. “He’s a wanna-be-in-Valhalla jerk! He’s after fame and glory! He just wants everyone to love him!” He then repeated this mantra on loop. Hoping to firm this up in his mind.
“I saw Loki!” Bucky gasped out as he tried to soothe his throbbing head. “Him and Tony were talking. Talking about you Steve. Ugh!” Bruce instructed Bucky to sit on the ground while everyone shared puzzled looks.
“Your right.” Howard drew back and his eyes seemed lost, “Instead he’ll offer you a deal. But he is a cruel god...one that demands a high price for anything and everything.” The older man spoke slowly and seemed to be lost in a memory.
“Let me get sick! I don’t care! I just want to be with her!” Steve cried as he broke down into sobs.
“That’s the last place he would voluntarily go!” Tony defended. “If he’s there it’s not by choice.” He then glared back at Phil. “And he doesn’t crave flesh!”
Everyone, the spectators, the court, the Avengers, the King and Queen, all looked over to Tony who had climbed up on the Royal box. Tony didn’t look away from King Minos as he walked closer.
“Steve calm yourself, I know. You wouldn’t take a handout even if someone sewed the coins into your chiton.”
“Aye!” Thor gestured for Steve and Bucky to rise. “Two mortals daring the underworld for an audience with you. That bravery and determination is nothing short of-”
Loki thought, imagining the crowd cheering for Steve and his mortals after they freed the poor innocent victims. Only for their cheers to turn to screams of horror as they then witnessed the 5 being torn apart by the deadly Hydra.
“Tony, would you please go out on a date with me?” Steve finished the question with a smile that tried to appear natural, but his body language was stiff and screamed nervous.
Jan greeted all of them and then gave them a tour. Jan then rushed off to finish the shows last minute preparations and everyone split into groups and decided to take a walk about London. At the end of the night some people stayed at Jan’s, others stayed at Tony’s. Both Rhodey and Bucky comforted their respective best friends as the boys spent a lot of the night discussing how they hoped Tony/Steve was doing alright. Both friends supplied comforting words but Tony and Steve dismissed them.
She made to turn her head but paused before even the corner of her eyes could see him. She seemed to have caught herself and turned back to her candle. Dismissing the call as to not being for her.
“Let me guess, a play about the Avengers heroic exploits?” He smiled and Steve blanched at the guess.
for how he feels?! They are nothing to you and I!” Loki grabbed the front of Thor’s armor and jostled it, trying to shake the blonde.
Turns out they were at the perfect position to travel up the back-way to Tony’s house. Upon entering said house, the Avengers all gawked. Steve had only ever seen the outside of it (after walking Tony home every so often) but had never actually been inside.
“Lord Loki while all of this sounds very nice, and your benefits are more than fair. I have a job protecting Thebes City, and I simply cannot leave it.” A young black centaur stated stopping in Loki’s throne room after the tour Loki had just finished giving him.
To have one half of the heavens ruled under her, she questioned why it was limited to only half and not all. And so she began to plan her take over. She staged a surprise attack at Odin’s engagement party. Odin was set to ask the Jotunn Jord to marry him when Bestla signalled for the attack. Before Odin could do anything Jord was dead, as was Laufey. Farbauti fled with grievous injuries and was presumed dead. Odin was enraged but hid his anger and stewed in it. He had thought he could bide his time and get the Jotunns to rally around him and overthrow his mother.
Mrs. Barnes then ushered everyone to the table for dinner. After dinner Bucky and Steve went to their shared room.
The group had then all traveled together back to Thebes. Once there they set the record straight and assured Fury that the heroes would work with Bruce in getting his hulk form under control. Betty and Bruce then moved into the five’s home and the training began.
I want to take a moment and thank all those who commented and/or gave kudos, and likes/reblogs on tumblr! And not just to this fic but the series! :D
“Of course he’s fine! He’s so fine that he’s out running through all of New York from dawn until dusk to run away from everything that’s so GREAT and FINE in his life!”
Tony would never be able to pay Jarvis and Ana back for all that they did for him, and he was more than a little honored that they agreed to let him use their name.
“Some hero!” Steve scoffed. “I finally feel like I can help people, and we have!” Steve amended but continued on, frustrated. “But every time it comes to someone I love….I’m left helpless!” He gave Bucky an anguished look. “I thought I’d be at least able to protect Tony. Now that I have all this power.” He looked at his hands in anger and frustration.
“By the gods you are amazing.” Steve panted as his hands explored Tony’s lean and slightly muscular back.
1. I’m a super sucker for overprotective!characters. Bucky with Steve and now Rhodey with Tony. I’m just such a sucker for this trope.
Before Steve could freak out or panic Sam suggested they may have passed the man and that he’s with the Avengers now. So they flew back to the Avengers mansion. There, the Avengers asked if they found Tony and Steve did begin to panic, but he kept it in check. Panicking wouldn’t find Tony.
Tony raised an eyebrow at that but Steve just nodded and made to reach out to Tony but the brunette flinched back.
Loki’s eyebrows dropped and he made a movement with his arms towards Tony, an automatic reaction to reach out. But Loki caught himself. For a moment he pondered what to do, then his eyes caught the leftover pottery and he walked over to pick it up.
“I just told them all off! Steve’s definitely not going to devolve all his greatest weaknesses to me now.” The brunette groaned. “I’m back to square one. Actually negative one…..You should send Amora in. She’s right, I can’t handle people.”
Loki only slid his eyes to Steve in response. Everyone’s attention then zeroed in on the blonde, who hadn’t looked away from Tony. Suddenly sensing everyone’s attention, Steve squared his shoulders.
“Get out of there while you can.” He muttered glancing between Steve and the dark abyss he knew housed the Hydra.
The Avengers all shared a look but didn’t follow until Steve took the first steps after the brunette.
The rest then got ready to go their own way towards Jörmungandr. But before Bucky left he turned back to Steve.
“There’s nothing he could do, the deal with your father is binding. But he would never let me hear the end of it.” Loki had explained. “And if you think ruining my relationship will make life easier for you. You are mistaken!”  He threatened. “If Thor finds out about you then I can promise your eternity here in Hel will be comprised of me thinking up new torturous punishments for you. Am I understood?”
He then opened a portal back to Hel and stormed into it, a trail of frost being left in his wake. Amora quickly followed but not before throwing one last glare at the mortals being carried away.
Sam meanwhile turned back to his friends to see if they needed help and did a double take. “Oh my gods.” He groaned.
“Call him by his name. Only a handful, if that, know his name. You call him by his name, explain everything to him and you should be good.” Tony advised.
It had started when Thor had asked for the Casket of the Jotunns. When Thor explained he was getting it on Loki’s behalf. Odin had vehemently denied the request and then fell into the familiar rant about Loki. Thor had tried to tune Odin’s “let’s list all the ways I think Loki’s failed” rant out, as he wanted to quickly get the Casket so he could find out about Tony.
“Sure he does.” Tony muttered sarcastically but nodded. “I did suggest that before, but maybe now he’ll listen.”
“You know I value our promise above all else!” The blonde screamed, “You should have told me about your true anger and suspicions regarding my friends.” Thor said in a quieter but no less serious tone.
So many good things came as time moved on, but also some bad things. For one Tony realized Loki was right. There were times he just couldn’t take the land of the living. For example, all the touching. When it was just Rhodey, Steve, the Avengers, and his mom he was fine. But it was the everyday pushing in the crowds. The handshakes and greetings of everyone. The constant glad handing he had to do as Steve’s boyfriend. The fake smiles and obvious envy the Avengers fans threw his way. All the touching and obvious fake emotions would just get to him.
Steve then hoisted Tony up into his arms and climbed onto the horse with Natasha’s assistance. He then urged the horse into a gallop and ran them down to a deserted part of the beach.
Then it happened, while Natasha and Clint distracted the two heads, Sam came diving in from the sky. He had fired a few arrows into one of the heads and then came down and used all his weight to kick the monsters head down towards the ground. The one head went down, where Steve and Bucky ran at it. Bucky had what appeared to be a rock in his hands while Steve had his shield. They ran and sandwiched the head between the two of them, crushing the skull and killing the one head.
They had gone to Thor’s temple and beseeched him in order for him to assist them in training Bruce. Thor had readily accepted and so everyday the humans would find themselves at the coliseum training yard the citizens had gifted them. Thor would spar against Hulk and Steve would coach Bruce on not letting his anger blind him. Betty would also be there as a fail safe because nothing calmed Bruce down faster than Betty.
“You’re exaggerating, I don’t think you’re in the negatives.” Loki scoffed and seemingly ignored Tony’s suggestion. “This is a setback but a minor one.”
Pushing open the door, Thor jolted to a stop. For almost a decade Loki’s room had become a cluster of scrolls, books, and writings about Hel. Every surface had become covered -even the bed. And Loki refused to move the items to any other room. However today, Loki’s chambers were clear. No scrolls or books stuffed into every nook and cranny possible, no overflowing stacks of paper precariously stacked on tables. Everything was as it once was years ago.
Upon his arrival in the Palace of Hel Loki immediately dragged Thor to his chambers, which Thor took as a good sign. Until the doors closed and Loki rounded on him, completely blue and red eyed. He then threw venomous words at the blonde, about Thor’s actions against him,  and his friends -to whom he had sworn painful deaths to them. Thor had defended himself and his friends which proved to only anger Loki more.
“You have to do this Tony! I have to do this!” Howard finally snapped. “I. Am. Needed!” With that Howard shoved Tony away so hard the boy fell to the floor.
“Because I love him. When the man you love. A man who has been abandoned and scared of love leaving him. Kneels in front of you and asks you to spend forever with him. You say yes.”
Thor glanced at the two mortals then pulled them in his arms. Sharing a glare with Loki, he raised Mjolnir and zoomed them out of the Palace and out of Hel. Loki shot an icicle at their fleeing backs then let out an angry scream.
Steve shrugged helplessly. “It was something I had to handle alone.” Steve gave a sad half smile. “I should have told you earlier though.”
Steve didn’t even try to move. He had turned his face away from Tony after Loki’s abrupt exit and hadn’t looked back.
Rhodey was always the level headed one. Was always the one with all the answers. Sometimes Tony ignored those answers but at least Rhodey had them.
“This needs to be done Tony.” Howard squeezed out dropping his gaze. “This needs to be done in order for us to win the war.”
1. Yay Bruce joined the team. Finally we have the whole gang. Also, in this AU Hulk is NOT his own person. It’s still Bruce, but a Bruce that gets drowned in only anger.
As Bucky opened the door, he made to yell out a greeting when he overheard a foreign but oddly familiar male voice. He felt like he heard it before but couldn’t quite place it. Silently he crept into the house towards the foreign voice.
“The reason I got into this, all of us into this, was selfish. I just wanted Peggy back and I wanted to be absolved. I didn’t care that she told me to leave it, I didn’t care that going down this path endangered my friends. I just cared about my needs. My wants.” He locked eyes with Howard. “That’s the definition of selfish.”
Finally everyone made it to the front of Tony’s house. They knocked a few times but didn’t hear anything. Well most of them didn’t. Steve heard laughter and some nondescript talking coming from the back of the house.
“You could have told me! You should have told me!” Thor yelled, increasing in volume as he went on. “I could have helped!”
“Sure, I give it-” Loki began but cut himself off as he watched Steve pick up a large boulder and chuck it at the Hydra’s head, hard enough to daze the creature.
However, Tony wasn’t the only one who had a difficult time accepting the new normality. Throughout the first year Loki himself seemed to forget Tony’s existence, and when reminded seemed at odds with what to do with him. That whole year Tony was a crying, nervous, mess of a child. So, whenever Loki stumbled upon him, he often just sent him away or gave him some menial task so he’d be out of the gods sight. Which mainly comprised of taking care of Loki’s favorite pets (Jörmungandr and Fenrir).
Loki shook his head in the negative then brushed past her and re-entered his throne room. Amora threw his back an irked look but followed. He beckoned Thor to enter and before the blonde could say anything he spoke.
Everyone stood up a little straighter and glanced at each other, except Steve who had avoided eye contact.
Tony spent most of his time at the Avengers villa. They would all hang out and relax. Sometimes they would all hang out together, other times it’d be just a few of them. However, Steve and Tony’s one-on-ones never happened. But Steve took it in stride. He just enjoyed spending time with Tony and Tony seemed to enjoy spending time with him and his friends.
“I am enjoying the view I have found.” Thor now braced his arms on the table, caging Loki in against his own body. Thor closed his eyes and leaned forward to capture Loki’s lips  “Now I think I’d like to enjoy my find fully.”
Steve handed off the mallet and Howard gave him a thin smile. Steve had already expected that answer but he often wished it would change.
“Happy was so worried about you all.” She said, “As was I, but Happy was more frantic in his worry.”
Tony turned to glare at him but stumbled a bit at the sight of the god. Loki was pale skin and had green eyes. It had been so long since Loki wore his pale skin. And Loki had a teasing smirk on his face. The image stuttered something in Tony. He missed this. He missed Loki’s careless and mischievous attitude. It felt like it had been an age since he last saw it.
! I haven’t made any deals with any mortals!” He then turned and pointed out towards the hallway. “And because of that, Steve tore Thor’s gaze from me! I told Thor I was angry with those mortals and he
“Great!” Tony bit out sarcastically. “Everyone wins!” He continued in a sarcastic tone. “Asterion get’s to live, King dickface gets to keep his shit up, and Queen Pasiphae gets to suffer and mourns in silence!” He gave Steve a bitter and angry smile “What a happy ending!”
For the timeline in case I lost anyone: Tony was sacrificed at 8 years old, 2 years later the war ended (Tony’s now 10), 1 year after that the Starks move into Steve’s city (Tony’s now 11), roughly 5 years after that is when the chapter actually takes place (Tony’s now 16).
“I want that!” Tony jumped in. “And I can’t lie now,” He gestured to his shade body. “So you can believe me.”
Thor shook his head in the negative. “That won’t work.” The god then moved to walk out of the temple, Steve and Tony following after him. “I may not have been able to play with Jörmungandr often but I know he is clever. He will just hide away in the city. Waiting till I am gone then he will strike.”
After his declaration Thor stayed for some basic introductions, made sure all the mortals were taken care of, then bid farewell with a promise to return and check on their progress.
“They weren’t lying. I could tell.” Loki gave Tony an over-the-top look of disbelief. That immediately made Tony stand on edge. “Thor looked me in the eyes and told me-”
Tony looked into the alcove and saw her. She was the only woman in the area and appeared to be praying over a candle she had just lit. Her back was to him, but Tony knew it was her. Steve squeezed Tony’s hands in order to get his attention.
Of course the feeling and idea were conflicting. Steve and Tony rarely agreed with anything immediately, this should’ve been no different. But it was. It was different. The idea and feeling couldn’t be debated. In this instance one had to win and the other lose. A compromise was not available.
Clint looked to the woman who was staring Steve down. Finally she seemed to come to a conclusion and nodded in agreement. Clint then stepped back and let the woman get into position in front of Steve.
“We need to think of a plan.” Sam decided, closing his eyes to try and help recall what (if anything) Erskine had said about centaurs.
’ His mind helpfully suggested. Tony thought he was still trying to get Peggy back. Tony thought Steve saw him as a fill in for Peggy. Tony thought he was lying when he said he loved him.
Tony had witnessed many of Loki’s tantrums over the years and mostly had grown immune to them. However even he couldn’t suppress his flinch at the intensity of that last blast.
“I was here last night and again this afternoon and never saw your friend come through here.” The guard answered. “But I’ll keep my eyes open for him.”
Steve, Sam, Bucky, and their two new companions Natasha and Clint finally made it into New Thebes City. It was huge, enormous even. The city backed up to the Mediterranian and was built on a very mountainous areas. There were various levels of elevation making up the city and all appeared to be occupied. There were tons of large buildings, multiple temples to the various gods, all sorts of statues in an array of sizes, and various monuments to certain heroes and/or gods. Chariots and people on horseback were everywhere on the city roads, the city seemed to constantly be in motion. The only time people seemed to stop, was when the traffic guides indicated they had to. The walk areas were also jammed pack with people, the city was obviously very heavily populated.
Thor was, as usual, out of this world. He talked with Steve and let Steve discuss the feeling that he had carried. He didn’t approve of how Steve ended things but agreed it needed to happen. He also comforted Tony, and felt for the man who thought he found love, only for it have been ripped away by the very person giving it.
“OH! You’re talking about Steve and Tony, right?” Sam asked finally catching on to what Bucky was referring to.
Tony absently traced his scar with a grimace but Steve grabbed his hand and kissed it. Tony gave a half smile but still seemed bothered by it. Trying to raise his love’s spirit, Steve gave Tony -what he thought was- a suggestive smile.
“Oh no.” He smiled like the cat that got the cream. “We’re doing this.” Tony then pulled the blonde’s mouth back towards his own.
Being raised by the god of Mischief had its perks, Tony was very good at lying. However he couldn’t do it in that instance, he just needed to leave.
Sam didn’t look convinced and the next day Bucky didn’t either. That week, at the weekly meet up, Tony went over to Steve with his tablet in hand.
“Are we sure it’s the same Tony?” Clint added jokingly giving Natasha and Bucky a light jab. “Brunette, suave, apparently only wears red chitons?”
Steve looked over the group appraisingly and walked around correcting some forms and movements as he went.
A little over 2 years after he was sold, Tony was 10 and had started asking for things to do in his spare time. He was growing used the the sections of Hel he had seen and was growing restless. Rhodey had taken him with him when the centaur went to direct new shades; but that proved problematic. Many shades, after seeing a young alive human in Hel, stopped and tried talking to Tony. Asking him all types of questions and refusing to move. To get traffic moving again Tony had to leave.
“You shouldn’t make promises you can’t keep. Consider that my revenge.” He teased and the rest of the group laughed.
Tony flinched as she sobbed. He began to wring his hands together again as his own tears pricked at his eyes.
They pushed against the doorframe harder and Tony pulled away to hiss in discomfort. Steve then grabbed Tony’s thighs and lifted the man. Tony instinctively wrapped his legs around the blonde’s waist. He then gazed at the blonde in wonderment.
2. Let me tell you, this chapter was the one I was the MOST excited to write! Amora and Tony’s confrontation had been solidified in my mind for years and I just love it. Tony using his most deadly weapon (his mouth) to save his boyfriend and friends. YES! At first he was just going to try and stall and accidentally get hurt in the process then as the years went on and this story got more and more thought out. I figured out that no, he would know they’d need their powers back. And Tony’s a self sacrificing S.O.B. so yup he'd intentionally try to get himself hurt.
“Thor, Thor!” Steve waved his hand in front of the gods eyes, causing said god to blink rapidly. “We need you to focus here. He’s scared of your thunder and lightning. So we need you to scare him away.”
This was his job. He was about to get exactly what he first came here for. He had been watching the Avengers, categorizing and documenting how they fight, what makes them unique, and trying to come up with weaknesses this whole time. Now he was getting one, Steve’s, handed to him. And he didn’t want it...?
“I have to agree with the slave.” Amora jumped in, and Tony threw her a glare but didn’t interrupt. “You can’t rely on him to get information from mortals. Does he even know how to hold a conversation?! Let alone pry out information! I mean for Odin’s sake Loki! The man is so dense around other mortals! He couldn’t even tell his father was leading him to slaughter. How long did that take to kick in?!” Amora spread her arms wide. “And you expect him to be able to pull information from strangers?! He couldn’t read his own father!”
“I don’t have my freedom now. You know that right?” Tony laughed as he followed the shade into his room.
“Children are rambunctious. If you don’t let them get their energy out. They’ll find a way to get it out.” Jarvis explained as he looked at all the damage. “Anthony, it seems you have quite a bit of energy stored up.”
Bucky made to follow them but Thor held him back. Erskine and Steve walked into the forest silently and eventually sat next to a steady stream.
Tony had then dove into doing whatever he could to earn as much freedom as possible. He had revamped the Monster Village, which had boosted moral and positive reviews of job postings in Hel. He had then gone on recruitment missions. He traveled to the Monster Bog in the land of the living and proved to be excellent in recruiting monsters. He also helped implement more effective underworld systems that accommodated all the employees of Hel. He had done such a good job revamping Hel’s systems that Amora’s job appeared to be moot as everything ran like a fine tune machine. Which backfired on him in the aspect of Amora loitering around the Palace now more than ever. But Tony refused to let her get to him, because he would be free.
“S-sure.” Steve squeezed Tony’s hand. Someone urged Tony on, Natasha by the sound of it. Though all of the noise seemed be going distant to Steve’s ears. The feeling was tight.
“Do not underestimate my powers! I can go undetected.” Amora seethed, offended at the idea that she even needed to defend her prowess. “They will never be able to tell it was me.” She assured but Loki was shaking his head in the negative next to her.
The god of Death let out a put upon sigh then magicked Thor’s clothing back onto him. He then let the beseechment take him and Thor to wherever he was being summoned.
“Get some of my scent?” The human asked teasingly. Loki gave the man a glare but that only caused Tony’s smile to grow.
“Nothing just,” Tony groaned and draped himself against the centaurs back. “I don’t know, I’m tired of people.”
Tony looked stricken but Loki only glared at him from atop his throne. After searching Loki’s face for something, Tony wasn’t even sure what he was searching for, but at the end he knows he didn’t find it. He turned away.
Tony meanwhile was congratulating himself on being prepared for that question. He knew it would come up. If not during this mission then during his life when he was free. He had asked Jarvis if it was OK to take his name and the shade broke into tears of happiness at the question. He had then gushed on how happy and honored that would make him, as he never had a child but considered Tony his own. However he had to verify if it was alright with his wife. Of course Ana was thrilled and also moved to tears at Tony’s request.
“Don’t sweat it man, I’ve trained newbies before. I’ll take it slow.” Sam joined in, earning laughter from everyone sans Bucky, who glared harshly at him.
Loki looked Steve over critically for a breath then in the next he pulled the Scepter back and made ready to strike it into Steve.
Tony tried to say something but his throat was clogged. He attempted to clear it but instead a rough, poorly hidden, cry escaped. “I...I had to!”
Loki’s brow twitched and his mouth turned to a frown. “You mortals throw that word around too lightly.”
Pepper gave Steve a gentle smile. “I’m Pepper Potts, I died quite a while ago. I don’t have a rank here, I’m just a shade.”
Steve’s eyes immediately averted and he began to curl into himself. Erskine hit on his weakest point. He knew his physique wasn’t impressive, but Thor had said he could be a True Hero. He had said it so effortlessly. Not a moment of hesitation, no giving him a once over and saying “maybe not” or “if you weren’t so”. So Steve hadn’t doubted him, yet here his supposed trainer was doubting him after offering him his dream.
Loki’s throne room was circular and had several snake and circle designs carved into the walls. Directly across from Loki’s throne was the entrance to the throne room from Hel. There were also two other doors on either side of Loki’s throne which presumably led deeper into the underworld palace.
“They broke into my realm and my home, and interrupted us. They deserve nothing.” Loki stated coldly.
It was the first time Steve had actually spoken to him. Outside when Steve had screamed his name in terror when he thought Fenrir was going to eat him. But Tony didn’t count that. Now Steve had looked him dead in the eyes and spoke.
The Avengers for their part had remained silent and were still confused as Tony’s explanation still hadn’t answered everything.
Once inside they encouraged Steve to vent his frustration. Then Bucky and Howard joined in, venting their frustration, sadness, and anger over Peggy’s passing as well.
Everyone let out a gasp of fear as the wolf grew incredibly large. Buildings began to crack and shake as some of the wolfs limbs pushed against them. Then before anyone could do anything else. Fenrir swooped his massive head down and opened his mouth in front of Tony.
Tony gave a casual shrug and his chiton came undone. “Ah damn!” He muttered as he grabbed the fabric and tried to tie it back up “You know,” He shrugged again, “Sometimes these things happen.” He said to Sam’s question.
“That would do nothing.” Loki waved his hand. “All mortal souls have a place here in Hel, once you die your spot becomes open to fill that place. In me granting you life again your place is empty and you get another spot -for your second death- but the first spot must be filled. You killing someone wouldn’t fill that, they would only fill their own place. No, you are getting two places in Hel and therefore your first place must be filled by a living soul. You must bring a living soul here to fill this current spot in Hel.” Loki paused to let that sink into the shades mind then continued.
‘He’s from Russia, so naturally we don’t have much on him,’ Sam continued, scrolling though the little information he could get on his tabled in hand. ‘James Buchanan “Bucky” Barnes was sent to a boarding school by the age of seven. Now, I couldn’t find out what kind of school exactly but after that he became some sort of secret Russian military weapon and became notorious as the “Winter Soldier”. He was experimented on and when the officials found out about this the army wanted-’
‘No, don’t! Please!’ the teen crawled backwards, his hoody no longer covering his face. He moved back till he felt the wall against his shoulder blades and sheltered his face in his hands. ‘Please…! I’m really sorry…’
It was hard to give this specific character (you might guess who it is by the chapter's title) a good reason to show up in this story, but I'm really happy it worked out.
‘Sounds scary, poor thing,’ Wanda frowned in worry, a smile on her face as she brushed a stray lock of raven hair behind the trickster’s ear. ‘You’re not injured, are you?’ she asked kindly, happy to see the raven shake his head.
‘He hunted spiders at night, capturing them in tiny glass jars and eating them as a midnight snack.’ the soldier continued casually, hardly able to suppress a chuckle as he watched the young raven twitch his face. His laughter was short to live however as he fell two fists colliding with the back of his head.
‘I said cut it out!’ Strange spoke sternly, a heavy frown on his face. ‘God, why is it everyone adores you now yet to me you’re still a little b-’ But as the doctor now noticed the young raven’s tears, he stopped. ‘No… no, please don’t. come on, have some dignity.’
3. Peter Parker just doesn't understand why the other Avengers could not come to trust Loki. He was a very polite god, a kind person and a strong Avenger, but most of all, he was his boyfriend, secretly of course, but still. Eventually, he decides he has had enough of it and wants to start a life away from his judgmental super hero family. Just him and the trickster. (A fic in which I will ATTEMPT to write a very dark Peter Parker (if that is even possible XD)
‘Okay, everyone relax, we can do this,’ Peter took a deep breath, ‘let’s continue, we should find dad soon enough if we just keep searching.’
‘I always imagined it… hot-rod red.’ Tony continued as he looked at his drawing again. He scoots a little closer, nudged the blond to pull him out of his shell and smiled. It was very tempting to lay his head to rest on his broad shoulder. ‘With a little gold, maybe.’
‘Loki,’ although Steve’s was soft and gentle it still clearly startled the teen. ‘Were you with Mister Killian the night of the murder?’
‘Oh, come on, really?’ Quill sighed as he crossed his arms, ‘So no one wants to give me a ride? I swear, it’s only gonna take a few minutes. Promise.’
‘You are a Disney princess?’ Loki snorted loudly, after which he could not contain his laughter any longer. ‘Well it suits you just perfect, Anthony!’
‘Woow, easy, Peter. Come on, breath. Deep breaths,’ Steve inhaled deeply, gesturing for the teen to follow his lead. They stood there for a couple of minutes before he placed a hand on the boy’s back, guiding him towards the end of the room where two simple cots awaited them.
‘You all decided not to tell Miss Potts or go to the police, it would’ve been no use anyway,’ Tony leaned on the table, his face hovering close to that of Thor. ‘So, you had to come up with something else to get rid of Killian.’
‘Play outside?’ Thor frowned, wondering how the man knew about his brother’s condition. ‘You came all this way just so you could play with my brother?’
They hovered around the board for hours, lost in time as Steve created one design after the other while Tony clumsily doodled matching weapons and nifty gadget. Steve laughed as Tony got more excited with every sketch, his energy seeming endless as he bounced between the drawing board and his computers.
The god of thunder looked at his body which indeed seemed to be emitting a warm and soft glow. He then looked at Loki, a worried expression on his face. ‘Brother, you… Your eyes, they are turning grey.’
‘You say it’s pathetic and yet you didn’t erase it.’ Steve noted sharply. He managed to look away from the drawing as his master didn’t respond and found himself absolutely horrified as he saw him staring back with wide eyes. ‘I- I am sorry, master! It is not my place to-’
‘Oh, nothing,’ The blond sat down behind his desk, taking a sip of the piping hot drink. ‘Okay, tell me, what do we have?’
‘It’s just… I don’t know, something doesn’t feel right,’ Steve admitted, mulling over the entire investigation.
‘Poor thing…’ Natasha sighed, and looked at Steve. ‘What will happen to them? Will they be able to stay in the US?
‘Uh, Tony,’ he took the papers from the trickster’s small hands which were still hidden in his sleeves. ‘This is so weird on so many levels…’
The raven quickly shook his head. ‘No,’ he smiled desperately. ‘No. And he can never find out about it! It would kill him...’
Loki looked up at the towering blond at his side with a puzzled expression and tilted his head. ‘Brother…?’ he asked, his voice soft, almost in a whisper.
Loki tilted his head slightly and blinked his eyes as he wondered what the captain meant. He then looked at the items in his hands, ‘Oh, well, Tony said I should look for a side-kick to defend Midgard with but… I think I would rather stay here.’ He carefully placed the items at his side, pulled his knees up to his chest and wrapped his arms around his legs, admiring the view. ‘I like summer, it is really pretty.’
‘I can’t believe this,’ Peter mumbled in defeat, his head resting in his hands. ‘I am the friendly-neighborhood-spider-man. I can’t be
The two came closer to the captain, only a few more yard separating them. The raven took a deep breath, reading himself to execute his mission.
‘Holy shit!’ Tony shouted as he had not noticed the raven was standing next to him this entire time, causing him to jump back and trip over some failed rocket-boots prototypes.
One video left Tony to run towards the ensuite bathroom, heaving bile. It showed Steve hanging from a noose, his toes barely touching the ground. His breaths were strangled, gasps wet is it sounded like his windpipe had filled up with blood.
He watched as Steve concentrated on his drawing, each line creating more depth, each curve bringing the project closer to life. The childish doodle slowly turning into an actual suit of armor. ‘Where did you learn to draw like this?’ Tony asked as he stared breathlessly at the amazing sketches on the glass board.
‘… You’re lying,’ Tony’s mouth went dry as he did not want to believe the doll’s story. Hearing it speak such cruel words so apathetically left him horrified. ‘You’re lying!’
‘And Killian rapes him,’ Tony growled, spitting out the words in absolute disgust and anger. ‘Loki panics, pushes the drunk man away from him and Killian stumbles out of the window.’
‘Hey Lokes?’ Peter quickly intervened, ‘I was thinking about doing some training, want to come along? Steve and Clint have already started, plus some other friends I would like you to meet, so what do you say?’
Tony felt Steve’s eyes burning in his back. He shot a quick glance at the doll, guilt crushing his chest as it held its breath in anticipation of his reaction. ‘… Of course I do,’ Tony muttered. He downed the bourbon with one big gulp and placed the empty glass back on the tray. He didn’t dare to look at Steve again. ‘So, what now?’
‘Don’t worry Thor! I’ll be a responsible big brother, I can do this!’ Peter quickly shouted before Quill closed the door behind him.
‘I’ll help.’ Tony stated determinately, already walking towards Obadiah’s laptop. It was the least he could do after doubting his friend. ‘I’ll find them. They won’t get away with this, I promise.’
‘Yeah, I thought I’d change my image, you know? New age, new Rogers.’ Steve chuckled, ‘I’m gonna grab a shower.’
!’ he grabbed Steve’s hair and pulled him to his feet, causing the doll to yelp in pain. ‘Where is he?!’
‘Beast?’ Tony called out after which both Peter and he stopped and looked at each other with a frown. ‘What?’ the playboy continued, ‘I feel horrible for saying this, but I don’t know what to call him otherwise.’
Who was this stranger? Was he really family? Was he a friend? Or maybe an enemy? Where had he taken his brother? When would they be back?
Tony saw the boy’s smile disappearing. He seemed to mumble something as he watched Steve walk towards the front door, slamming on the glass one last time before looking at the playboy and disappearing from the window.
Bruce and Natasha looked at each other as their tea and coffee was now spilled all over the table, earning themselves a loud snort from Tony.
‘Well, let’s get inside,’ Tony said as he placed a hand on Peter’s shoulder. ‘We’re already late for our own party.’
‘…Tony,’ Steve tried the name out. It felt weird calling his master by his first name, yet at the same time it made him feel ecstatic. He smiled brightly, ‘Tony.’
The doll swallowed but eventually nodded, its fingers digging into the sheets. ‘Please. Please, master.’
‘That’s just, oh my god, that’s amazing.’ Peter crouched down and looked at the raven up close, ‘Hey Lokes, uh, Loki, how old are you?’
Tony guided them to the spare bedroom as he could not bring himself to face the blood and semen stained bed in the master chamber.
‘Well, the seminal fluid was from the victim himself, the blood on the other hand remains a mystery. There wasn’t enough for me to do a proper research. We didn’t find any wounds on the victim, so it cannot be his.’
Suddenly, Peter’s laughter came to an abrupt end as his spider scenes tingled in loud alarm. He looked up, noticing an elderly man who was slowly shuffling behind a rollator. ‘Quill… QUILL! Look out!’
‘Well, since this party could not start any better, I say we raise a glass,’ Loki suddenly spoke, holding the tray with drinks in front of him, making sure each glass was directed towards the right person.
But Tony already grabbed the doll’s hands, placing one on his hip and holding the other in his own. ‘Time for you to learn.’
‘Yeah, I already heard,’ Thor interrupted Steve. ‘Killian, he’s dead, right? Bucky already told me.’
‘So, you like it here?’ Peter asked as he felt the trickster’s small hand carefully searching for his own. He smiled and picked the raven up, letting him sit on his shoulders.
'So, another kid in Stark Tower, huh?’ Tony noted as he looked straight ahead, making it look like he wasn’t really talking to anyone in particular. A smile then formed on his face as he heard Peter and Loki laugh in the back yard. Playing Einherjar must be pretty fun, though the playboy had no idea what it was. ‘I guess I could get used to that, you know, another kid.’
Peter yelped as he tripped over his own feet. He managed to grab the banister in his fall, his heart pounding in his chest as he had already tumbled halfway down the stairs. He panted heavily, a sharp pain coming from his left ankle.
Loki nearly jumped as he heard a man’s voice coming from a nearby room. He quickly pressed his back against the wall, scooted over until he was near the door opening and managed to peek inside.
‘Way ahead of you, sir.’ The perfectly polite manner in which Jarvis spoke had a strong undertone of sassiness to it. ‘But that was not the reason of my concerns.’
‘Technically, in Midgardian Greek mythology, “hell” only exists of one layer, Tartarus, The Fields of Asphodel and The Islands of the Blessed.’ Loki said as he raised his hands in defeat, but as the face of the playboy turned even darker, he quickly added, ‘Yes, I, I know how to create the anti-spell...’
Tony panted and covered his eyes with his hands. He could not believe what he saw. Could not believe that Obie, who was a family friend before he was even born, was capable of such cruelty.
‘I share the advice Lady Widow has given you,’ Thor said sternly as he stood next to the assassin, ‘for the next time you feed my baby brother such intolerable lies, I shall let you make acquaintance with Mjölnir.’
ALSO! I've got an announcement to make! This fic started out with 6 chapters and thanks to all you awesome people, that turned into 7... And now, I can proudly tell you that I've finished chapter 9 and i'm starting with chapter 10 (I don't know yet how many chapters i'll write XD)
‘Right. I am a mechanical device that is capable of performing a variety of tasks on command or according to instructions programmed in advance.’ The bot took a deep breath before continuing. ‘I am incapable of feeling any form of sentiment.’
‘Or! We could pretend to be Einherjar, traveling through the vast plains of Vanaheim in search of bilgesnipes!’
Tony’s finger moved in and out, gentle at first yet soon caught more speed. He added a second finger, biting his lip as the doll underneath him started to squirm and beg for more. ‘You like this, Rogers?’
The teen looked up, his eyes widening in shock as he saw countless scars running over Steve’s upper body. His chest, his arms, fingers, stomach, all marked with angry red lines. ‘W-what…?’
‘This is the part where it gets good,’ Peter whispered to the raven with a chuckle, seeing how Loki was listening breathlessly.
At first, Loki shut his eyes, clenching to the man’s upper body as he tried to take steady breaths, but as the man now flew a little slower, he dared to look up. With the wind blowing through his hair, the little trickster started to laugh, a careful chuckle at first but it soon made way for a wide smile. The young god cheering and shouting as they flew over the compound.
Steve tilted his head, his lips pressing against Tony’s neck and slowly moving down towards his shoulder, leaving a trail of gentle kisses. His arms wrapped around Tony’s waist, pulling him closer against his body. He panted softly against his owner’s skin, teeth gently biting at his shoulder.
Luke shouted into his wristband, putting a boot gently but firmly on the neck of one of the thugs who had begun to inch away.
One of his fingers traced the cutouts in the steel frame of his actual arc reactor without looking down at it.  It was still bright, even now…
To his credit the man didn’t go down, though the edge of Steve’s leather mask with the force of Tony’s fist behind it opened a slight, tearing cut along the lower edge of the mystery man’s eye socket.  Far from dazing him, this blow seemed to send the doppelganger
.  I’ve got a boy in the hospital who’s barely old enough to vote, a civilian who should never have learned you were working for SHIELD in the first place, and a motion from Thor and Warbird on my desk to turn your suspension from the Avengers into a full dismissal.  And so help me, with the facts I have at present, I’d vote with them.  I’m sure your work for SHIELD is important, but I won’t allow you to ride shotgun with us while ignoring my orders.  It’s too dangerous.  The Avengers are a team, War Machine.”
Steve was hard too, uncomfortably hot and confined beneath layers of khaki and well-fitting blue leather.  …But seeing Tony like this, touching him and watching his eyes slip closed, lips parting-
Tony took two steps back, and closed an armored fist around the barrel of the helicopter’s fifty-cal door gun.
Just another mission, and then the terrifying wrench of an impact, followed by the explosion, jerking the Huey right in midair so fast-
Tony exhaled within the fragile shell of his helmet, and the cold Plexiglas covering his eye-slits fogged momentarily.  …it was so still up here.  Pristine.  Some people went their whole lives without seeing this…
“Yeah, yeah, and then you LOST the son of a bitch!”  Fury snarled, cutting him off quickly lest Spider-man go over the entire battle blow by blow …
.  Apparently Reed has dimension travel figured out in at least four different timelines, and get this- -this book wasn’t even written by the Reed Richards from THIS reality… he just edited a copy one of his
“Okay, I’m talking to this guy who can cancel out gravity, but then he just floats there like a soap bubble and he can’t- -yeah, I’ll ask-”
fliers seemed a deadly impossibility.  Then they vanished, disappearing into the forest of buildings on the other side.
Together now, nothing fancy, strength meeting strength in a rolling snap that set Tony’s teeth on edge, made his breath come in deep, sharp-edged gasps.  Then a shift in the angle, and he was leaning further forward than he meant to.  A strike that grayed out his vision, but didn’t quite finish him…  Two…
If only he could paint with his left hand- -he’d tried though, with results that could only be called ‘impressionistic’.  No good for flowers, oils, and realism.
There was a tiny electric-pink flash in the upper atmosphere, and Tony’s radar beeped negatively to let him know that it had lost the flying saucer entirely.
An ant crawled onto the back of Tony’s hand from the bottom edge of his t-shirt.  Tony brushed it off onto the floor impatiently.  Two more ants stood milling around on the door lock control box, and a thin trail began to march down through an unseen chink in the ceiling tiles in one corner.
He fired an electromagnet on a high-tensile tow cable from a launcher hidden in the plating on his right forearm.  The magnet stuck, nearly making the Goblin’s glider crash into the side of a brick chimneystack.  The Goblin whipped something that flashed silver out of his billowing purple sleeve, and sliced the steel cable, freeing himself.  Without pausing, the villain backhanded the bat-like shriuken in the Midnight Racer’s direction.  It cut low, spinning with a force that had to be more than the simple force of the throw, and sliced a shallow line across the back of the Racer’s left calf, sending him temporarily off course.
“But it’s still ME-!”  Steve blurted out.  “-I mean… not literally, but it… have you ever been hit with small rocks, fruit, eggs-?”
“I want to…”  Steve began, and though he managed a wild glance up at Tony’s face for a moment, the rest of that sentence wouldn’t come.
Tony put his face down against Steve’s neck, inhaled deeply, and nuzzled him through the blanket-roll.
Tony’s eyes flicked to Steve’s face with intense curiosity, then closed.  He knelt in the indicated spot, and waited.  Steve had his shield in hand now, Tony could hear it the by the soft squeak of the brown leather arm-straps.
A young NYPD cop, glaring uneasily at Hawkeye’s back as if unsure whether to pull him out of the assembled group of costumed heroes and arrest him or not.
Peter fitted his rebreather into place, and pulled his cloth Spider-Man mask back down over it.  Peter’s spider-sense was going crazy, but then, he already knew there was something wrong out there…
“-M’sorry…”  Tony took a few deep breaths against the collar of Steve’s long tan trench coat, and started to cry.
“MY couch, I don’t care,” Tony assured him firmly, working Steve’s double layer of pants down where he wanted them and pushing him back down.
Tony had the emergency/police band frequency crackling rapid-fire information in his right ear, and only smooth static in his left, the channel kept open for Peter.
dollars, and finally been able to pursue a few pet projects of hers, like launching the Van Dyne fashion label, and sponsoring New York’s first official and completely unrelated superhero team.  It had been a hell of an undertaking, and Hank had quietly and sullenly began to fade from a moody and ineffective team captain to just one name on the Avengers growing team roster to… just Jan’s.
The line showed when the Racer moved though, cut leather flexing open and he leaned into the air in from of him, and braked, body twisting with near-unbelievable speed as he turned, braked, leaned sideways, cut right angles against the walls of buildings, pushed over the top, anything to stay one step ahead.
Peter caught it, passed it from hand to hand for a moment, and dove into one of the kitchen cabinets for a jar of peanut butter.  He slathered one entire side of the large pancake in the crunchy brown paste, rolled it up like a tortilla, and ate half in two bites.
Steve’s stride broke into a run, and he reached the fallen figure in seconds.  He’d been right, Iron Man wasn’t a robot.  Somewhere inside that suit of armor- -a red and gold affair that would have done Flash Gordon proud- -there was a living man.  From the sound of his breathing there might not be for very much longer, unless…
He came downstairs half an hour later, after a round of very passable banana-walnut pancakes.  Tony was snoring gently, and he didn’t appear to have moved.
Steve was out cold beside him, lips slightly parted, the arm that wasn’t around Tony curled up above his head.
Steve got up, found a pair of pajama pants with a pencil-thin pattern of light blue and white stripes, and disappeared into the bathroom.
The tech was a logical progression of what he’d seen in the burned-out warehouse, the speed and reflexes matched, but…
Electrical connector plugs disconnected, he hit the mesh framework of the LTF panel with the heel of his hand, just above the edge of the insulation foam.
Tony was glad his armor was already in the hockey bag under the bed.  -On- the bed was much more fun, and they went down
in the general direction of the toaster, then sat down next to Steve, and bent an elbow on the table.
They wouldn’t have been able to head him off -either-, if that hot-dogging terrorist hadn’t woken them all up
The campus was alive with green leaves, and the June sky overhead held the promise of perfect flying weather.
Tony was right, and the staring wonder of the moment that he realized Steve was actually serious was something he would never forget.  It wasn’t the slight touch of roughness of as the other man’s cheek brushed his stomach, or the soft touch of lips or tongue, it was Steve’s hair.  That outdated forehead-curl that never seemed to stay combed to the side once he’d put his costume on over it.  …The faint touch of
Thinking in terms of art had been his way of justifying his thoughts for quite some time, and even now he couldn’t shake it.  Couldn’t fully admit that he wanted to not only look, but touch, and taste…
“Come on man, get this show on the road…”  Luke said, weighing a heavy duty sledgehammer in one hand impatiently.
Harry seized the paintbrush in his left hand, and swiped a long, quick smear across the canvas horizontally.
“I’m in high school,” Peter pointed out, “-and from the looks of these I doubt you could pay me right now anyway.”
Tony completed the loop at barely three hundred miles per hour, and did a barrel-roll over the Village just because he could.
Tony reached down for a quarter-inch wrench, fingers passing knowingly over the tools laid out on the towel beside him, and locating it by feel.  He inched his body a little further beneath the Mustang, pulling the towel along with him by one smudged corner.
“Cross SHIELD, the Army, and Stark Industries off your list, and go from there,” Tony suggested, dryly.
The experiment was a success however, and the three of them ate it in two separate rooms, talking loudly back and forth through the slightly-cracked door.
ago.  This morning, however… Steve wasn’t sure if it was just the very-nearly-awkward timing of Peter’s arrival, or the speed with which Peter had zeroed in on Tony’s workbench, but the young man felt more like Tony’s son to him than usual.
Iron Man opened a panel in the red armor covering his left forearm, flipped two toggle switches, and slapped it shut.  The unibeam projector on his chest crackled for a moment, then subsided to a steady, dangerous glow.
Tony played with whatever caught his interest, but he didn’t try anything too kinky.  This was about mutual fun, not advanced technical skill that Steve would no doubt attempt to memorize on the fly…
But War Machine’s obscure loyalties didn’t erase the fact that he’d succeeded in -finding- the Green Goblin, nor the fact that he’d probably saved Harry’s life that afternoon.
“An- -old friend of mine.  He used to work for me, but he moved back to London after I lost SI,” Tony explained, vaguely.
Tony gathered the sections of his armor slowly together, then leaned an arm on the jukebox and pushed three buttons on the selector keypad.
…Though it went without saying that by resting as close to the bed as it did, the shield took its chances.
Harry and Tony looked up, equally surprised.  Peter, whose Spider-sense had given him a second longer to think about it, looked over at the heart monitor.
“So what you’re tellin’ me is… you mixed up his capes with mine, an’ planted ‘em on the most news-worthy bits of collateral you could find?”
Steve would have been able to discern the clink of forged-steel cuffs beneath the rattle of his descending keys.
He’d come back with a mission, a purpose greater than bettering himself for the first time in his short life, and he’d still been arrogant enough to think that no one could have been re-forged as completely without leaving New York City.
It felt… Tony couldn’t put it into words, but he thought first of ‘the soul of the sword’, the legend that a samurai’s will had to be
“Nope.  I can see the glow of the Infa-red bulbs on the wall behind you, but that’s it,” Tony said, looking pleased.
He guided the fingers of Tony’s right hand around one of the arm straps, and closed them.  The leather was
Warmonger fired a line of Phosphorus rounds after him, which Iron Man put a stop to by repulsor-blasting the other armor squarely in the face.
Peter chose a high, swivel-topped stool from in front of Tony’s workbench, dragged it over, and perched on it.
“Check, please…”  Peter said in a small voice, sticking to the half-broken closet door as he had impacted against it, diagonally and upside down.
Steve bent his head, and nuzzled Tony through his boxers.  It was a careful movement, all barely-contacting warmth, and the scratch of his own pale five o’clock shadow against thin cotton, and a darkly complex scent that made him harder, and suddenly thirsty.
Tony gave Lt. Farrell the rest of his thoughts on the two Goblin Gliders and the wrecked vapor-atomization chamber outside, and… waited.  He sat on one of the fire truck’s highly-polished steel running boards in jeans and a green, open-collared shirt he’d borrowed from Danny Rand that morning and felt decidedly… -naked-.
“Just new to the jukebox,” Tony replied, looking up from some papers on his desk with a smile.  The timbre of his voice was almost back to normal, but the bruise across his throat was still ugly, a shaded bar of purples, yellows and greens.  …It had been close.
The nurse glanced sternly at Peter and Tony, and picked up Harry’s chart, double checking something.
Steve frowned at him sidelong, but stepped back from the sinister-looking device.  He examined the way Tony’s armor was piled inside the jukebox.  …Then he smiled, and began taking it out again.  The armor hadn’t fit quite right in the lower compartment because the helmet, which normally had the smaller top compartment to itself, had been crammed in at the back of the lower one.
he’d done, told Steve about his parents, and losing Stark Industries to his cousin Morgan, and Sunset Bain?
“Everything except for the broken bottle by the foot of the stairs.  That sir, you clean up yourself,” Steve told him.
Tony had lost track of her several times, because she was just a -girl- after all, and they’d never been dating…
“He was my butler, actually,” Tony admitted, smiling wryly.  “-He works for the Carnelian ambassador to Great Britain now.”
“I’ve been getting the runaround from a lot of people lately,” Steve said, casting a disapproving glance at his bugged motorcycle, “-and you just gave me a straight answer.”
How many would resent him for not sharing?  How many would stop giving him information on general principle?  How many would give him that look… like they’d never seen him before?
Harry smiled a little, and gathered his sharpening wits for what promised to be a very challenging Q&A session.
MJ’s face wavered as she looked at him, torn but resolute.  Tonight she risked losing both of them, but Harry was right, he couldn’t leave Peter.
Then he started walking, and didn’t stop for a long time.  He hadn’t meant to start, he just needed the time to think.
Tony stopped in the center of the softly gleaming wooden floor with an efficient twist and took his helmet off, his back to the high windows.
Tony woke up with his ears still ringing.  He could feel currents of air buffeting him from the right-hand side alone, and the heady, silent rush of super-powered flight as someone carried him.
”  Fury reviewed, gesturing skeptically across the Avengers conference table with the end of his cigar.
It would probably be better if he’d done the details instead, ghostly edges and highlights picking out the flower’s shape without giving away its main color.
and up close.  So much concentrated, brittle, teenage emotion.  So much potential for disaster, greatness, and mediocrity.  A soft, strange, merciless microcosm was ending up there on that stage, every bit as cold, beautiful, and brilliant as the real world, only with plastic-smooth skin, and weird haircuts.
Tony tried desperately to keep a straight face, but his afterglow this time was of the giggly variety, which made that next to impossible.  Recovering, Steve caught sight of Tony’s tremblingly amused expression and groaned, shutting his eyes.
that I might be smack in tha middle of a delicate internal investigation here?  Tha kind that’s set back six months or MORE if some yahoo drops a line to the press about it?”
“The hell they were!”  Iron Man cut him off, speaking both loudly enough to be heard over the idling rotors and directly onto the helicopter’s designated radio frequency.
Finally the explosions sounded more faintly, and the streets were unnaturally empty of traffic.  -New Yorkers drove with their radios on for a reason, and they could vanish like cockroaches at the flick of a light switch if a battle advisory was called.
“Well, Elektra’s out of reach in Washington DC with She-Hulk, and Jennifer’s one of our reserve members anyway.  Thor is with Luke and Danny, Quicksilver is teamed with Misty Knight, and I gave Hawkeye to Warbird.”
…Then he spotted a pretty red-headed girl arguing with a black-haired jock on the outskirts of the milling graduation-day crowd, and perked up considerably as the jock stalked off in a rejected huff.  Harry drifted away towards the girl without a backwards glance, as if pulled by the force of gravity.
The tampering might be discovered -someday-, but not anytime soon, and what would it really tell them if blank tapes from a month ago -were- discovered?
His own graduating class had looked different.  For one thing their caps and gowns had been plain black and their faces mostly white, but for another his prep school class had all been boys.  The sons of America, the best of the best, heading out to conquer the world or get rich trying.  They’d been officers, and CEO’s, and politicians.  Lawyers, ground-breaking scientists, and astronauts…
“Why do you think he never came forward before?”  Peter pressed.  “-Do you think he still has his Super-Soldier powers, or would that have-“
something, wait until a vehicle with a CB radio drives across, and use it for ECM cover,” Tony argued back, starting to get annoyed.
Tony chose a beer and a Coke out of the refrigerator, and handed the Coke to Peter.  He sat back in his desk chair, and crossed his boots on the desk beside the phone book.
“Everything, it seemed like,” Tony smiled, “-my mom was into Victorian stuff though, so there was a lot of Bronte sisters and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle…”
He didn’t elaborate on what he had done -afterwards-, either.  Peter would have been in eighth grade at the time, and the sickening fear of that high-speed chase though the oncoming the traffic inside the Holland tunnel wasn’t something Tony wanted to describe out loud even to a college freshman.
Swinging over Rhodey’s shoulder with the rhythm of his copilot’s stride, his head spinning… the paper lanterns of a festival from upside-down, a filthy dog that didn’t quite work up the courage to sniff him, a pretty girl with long black hair and an embroidered white jacket, now flirting with Rhodey, now asking him questions and laughing at his responses…
The Mark VIII would have many of the improvements of its predecessors, but one or two would be conspicuously absent, and certain plates in the arms and shoulders had been subtly thickened and contoured around an entirely
“Last I checked, your Avengers were fine,” Tony reassured him, “-they’re out looking for you, actually.”
Tony kissed him again, more softly this time.  When the kiss ended, Steve ran a forefinger across the carefully trimmed line of Tony’s mustache.  Tony wiggled it like Samantha on ‘Bewitched’, and grinned.  Steve missed the cultural reference by a mile, but grinned back anyway.
The thing that held Steve’s eye though, was a snapshot of Tony himself, standing with his copilot and a handful of other soldiers by the open door of a green helicopter.
“Hey,” Tony said, raising his coffee cup a little and trying desperately to read the expression on the blonde’s face.
He had the base color, the outline…  he could probably finish it from here, and it would look -almost- right.
The Avengers were moving through the reek in pairs, searching.  Wanda and Pietro spoke in his ear, unseen.  Warbird was a shadow against the skylights above, on her own outside.
Steve’s fingers curled around Tony’s collarbone, then slid back down his entire torso along the same path, and traced up the backs of his thighs.
“Fine.  Whatever,” Tony plugged in the soldering iron, and threaded the wiring in another connector while it came up to temperature.
Questions pounded in his Harry’s skull like the headache behind his eyes.  He checked his watch again, but it didn’t make the garage door open.
Tony ran his fingers lightly across the scales of Steve’s mail shirt.  At this angle they hung loose, each tiny Duraluminum plate kept from actually pivoting straight downwards by the two scales contacting it from the row above.
“Fine,”  Fury said, turning back to Steve,  “-so while you two were enjoyin’ the sunburn, sand an’ local hostilities, you’re tellin’ me that back at the ranch,
“He helped us against the Mandarin’s henchmen last week,” Steve answered Peter,  “-he also stopped Attuma’s forces when they tried to sneak into the Atlantic through the Panama Canal, and he backed up Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch when the Lava-men had them pinned down on 48th st.-”
“Anyway, the owner hasn’t been able to rent this place out since the ‘Sons of the Serpent’ were arrested here, but it’s not like they scare -me-, so it all worked out great.”
“Definitely,” Tony nodded, “-hang on,”  he shuffled the papers into a pile, and stuck his pencil behind his ear.
A slight twinge in the muscles around the arc reactor in his chest brought Tony’s memory flooding back in a wave that left him momentarily nauseous.
“I didn’t see your dad out there- -was he hurt too, or is he…”  MJ broke off, but the words ‘just not coming’ hung in the air anyway.
There was something deeply sacrilegious about having his dick pressed squarely against where the star was, but Tony decided he could live with it if Steve could.
Steve studied the slightly blurred green and purple image on the front page of the newspaper in front of him.  The amateurish photo had been taken from below and at a distance, and it captured the collateral damage of the Goblin’s rampage far better than it showed the Goblin himself.  Steve searched for any flaw, any pattern or familiarity from the past in this new menace…
“I saw your boss’s place on the news after you called me last night,” Harry stated, letting Peter the rest of the way into the apartment.
Steve heard the clank of heavy boots in the hall outside, and put War Machine’s file out of sight.  He steepled his fingers, and waited.
“That wasn’t the sort of party where you stop to chat, but I’d meant to ask you earlier- -what’s that device you have…?”  Steve drew a circle in the air in front of his own chest.
“Mmph-! …Mm,” he glanced down at the cup dubiously, and dabbed his mustache with the edge of his bathrobe sleeve.  “-Ahem.  So, you fell in the river…”
“Good.  See if he can do something about those radios of yours,” Steve said, touching one of the crushed red disks on Tony’s helmet.
With the Mark IV, he’d finally gotten the internal shock-absorption and padding system figured out, which meant he no longer had to live in a fading tattoo of mechanically-shaped bruises, or keep
demanded it… and I can still peel a potato in under a minute,” Steve paused, wondering momentarily if War Machine’s armor had the same joint-locking feature that Tony’s did.  -He’d long suspected that the powersuiters abused this to keep from fidgeting.
The room was a long rectangle of open floor with large windows spaced evenly along the entire length of the outer wall.  It reminded Tony of a dance studio or martial arts dojo, except for the kitchen built into the short left-hand wall, and the modest pile of cardboard boxes surrounding Steve’s old Army foot locker against the right-hand one.  There was a doorway set into the right-hand wall as well, open and shadowed.
War Machine replaced his helmet with a noise like the bolt of a rifle being drawn back, and a magnetic-sounding ‘chunkt’.
“That- -that was you?”  The chain stopped rattling, “-jeez, I’m sorry… I- -guess I was in the can or summthin’…”
“Weh… I…  …You’re all right now,” Steve repeated, as if that made sense.  His face was probably close to the color of Iron Man’s -breastplate-…
“I saw him web you out of the way just before that marquee fell,”  Harry nodded,  “-I swear I think I my heart stopped-
Morgan started using the Maria Stark foundation to repair the damage to the city from super-powered battles?”  Tony interrupted, punctuating his point with a used butter knife.
Tony leaning one arm against the jukebox, and watching with interest as Steve picked out a song.  It had been something by Johnny Cash that time, Peter remembered-
“Um.  Heh.  Likewise… I think…”  Peter replied, sheepishly.  “…Oh god.  She’s naked.  She is, isn’t she?”  Peter said to himself, under his breath.
The trouble was, Steve Rogers was almost as much of a ‘living weapon’ as Danny Rand.  Tony’s usual method of waking Steve up from a nightmare involved throwing a pillow at him from a distance, but…  Huh.  They did need a lot of basic things for this place.  He’d have to look into that later.
‘im.  That fucker brings the heat down anyway.  Word is he torched that warehouse he was usin’ himself an’ flew off in different threads.”
He was sharing the bathroom here with Tony of course, but there was something about the way the mechanic couldn’t seem to get through a single teeth-brushing session without trying to talk around the toothpaste suds that made that strangely worthwhile…
“I’m placing you on an indefinite leave of absence,” he decided, “-you did disobey my orders several times, and Stark Industries should thank their lucky stars I don’t dismiss you publicly.  However…”  Steve shot War Machine a tight smile, and reached up to put his hand on the back of a thick steel shoulder-plate,  “-between you and me, you’re welcome to come back here any time, Avenger.”
,” Tony corrected with annoyance, squeezing past Ben into the room with an unscrupulous use of transistor-powered strength that left a long red scratch in the paint on the door.
“O-kay, you just broke a truce I had with Luke, but you didn’t know about it, so I’m pretty sure this won’t count,” Tony calculated, optimistically.
The wind-toughened face above the window-washer’s light blue cold-weather coveralls was pale, and sweating.
“That would be cool…”  Peter agreed, perking up at the thought in a way that just made Harry’s head hurt worse.
“I think you need a spotter,” Steve told him frankly.  “-I also think you should re-design that box of yours, because if I heard you right last night, it’s designed to blow out weak
Steve allowed himself a small smile, looked down into the interior of the suit and- stopped.  The inner side of the breastplate looked nothing like the plain welded and painted steel of the exterior.  It was a carpet of circuits, insulation, power busses, transistors, and things Steve couldn’t -begin- to guess at the function of…
Oh yeah.  Peter had definitely mistaken the melting cheese for runny egg and let things cook too long, but…  overall…  could have turned out a lot worse.  Tony finished the leftovers with four quick sweeps of his fingers, and returned to the table, coffee cup in hand.
“Come on Iron Man,” the copilot yelled back at him, “-we’ve gotta go!  The Lava Men were seen due west of-“
, Tony.  This isn’t about agency priority in a criminal investigation, this is about Fury being sore that I let the Centralia story break in the first place.  If I start letting SHEILD decide what truths I can tell, what battles are worth fighting… then I have no business leading the Avengers at all.”
“And most of all, you have to know what it feels like… on,” Steve finished, and put his hands on Tony’s shoulders.  Then softly, “-put your arms down.”
‘I don’t know,’ Tony shrugged tiredly, this whole case bothering him more than he would like to admit. ‘Maybe he’s scared that he would be send back to his home country? Maybe he just doesn’t want to get separated from Thor?’
The young raven rubbed one of his wrists. He looked utterly lost as he walked back to his brother, one small step at the time. ‘брате…?’
‘Well, if you’re really that desperate,’ The scientist pressed precious kisses against his inner thigh, slowly moving towards the doll’s entrance. His nails soon followed, dragging them across artificial skin yet still leaving red stripes. Tony admired them for a second before pressing a finger into the bot’s body. ‘Fuck, you’re so tight,’ He murmured as Steve let out a restrained moan. ‘Don’t worry baby. I’m gonna work you open, nice and slowly.’
’01.00 A.M. and there are still so many people on the streets,’ Steve remarked, though it sounded more like he was mumbling to himself.
‘Thor!’ The raven smiled while he held on to Peter’s hand. ‘Thor, have you heard the story of the great War Machine yet?’
The teen nodded slowly. ‘It all started about half a year ago, when mister Stane adopted me and one other girl from the orphanage. I met Steve at his place…’
‘No, it’s fine.’ Tony quickly smiled. ‘Hate to say it but you’re right.’ An awkward silence fell in which Steve completely shut down again, making Tony sigh. ‘You don’t talk a lot, do you?’
‘Smooth Tony, very smooth.’ The blond snorted as he followed the hands that guided him towards the stairs. ‘But I guess a shower does sound nice, yes.’
To all of you who spend their time alone in quarantine during this pandemic and have no one to turn to - know that, if you want to, I am here to listen.
‘Maybe,’ Pepper answered calmly though earnestly. ‘but it all ended up well. They can finally let their pasts rest and focus on their futures. As for Thor and Loki, organization protocols indicated that the two should have been separated. Thor being eighteen and considered an adult, he had to part from his little brother and undergo a whole different trajectory.’
‘Good idea, kiddo, I’ll have your back,’ Tony nodded as the others looked at him. ‘What? I was being serious, I’ll walk behind Peter and have his back.’
The blond gazed at him with a frown, wondering why his master would apologize. He was grateful that he wasn’t ordered to respond, for he had no idea what to say.
‘…Okay,’ Natasha nodded as she took a deep breath and thought this through. With Thor gone and her own bookshelf consisting mostly of thrillers, she had to think of something else to entertain the raven. ‘Follow me.’
Loki opened his eyes, the peaceful songs of early birds breaking the silence. He looked at the clock, noticing that it was only five in the morning. It was still early, even for him. Judging by the silence lingering in the tower, there were no other Avengers up yet.
‘You can use those, if you want to… or, need to…’ Tony frowned as he thought this over, then quickly turned on the shower. He placed one of his biggest towels at the sink and made sure there was plenty of shampoo and shower gel. ‘Take all the time you need, okay? What’s mine is yours.’
It didn’t hurt. Not anymore. The nerves in the back of Steve’s neck were damaged beyond repair long ago, leaving a numb sensation in its place. It was a blessing to the doll, who had been punctured and pierced so many times he had lost count.
‘Hey, it’s okay.’ The billionaire was shocked by the boy’s reaction. He was scared to death and so small as he curled in on himself. ‘I wasn’t going to hurt you. I never really cared for that statue anyway.’
‘I mean it Thor!’ Tony continued, more than angry. He then sighed and continued to stumble through the mud. ‘What I wouldn’t give for a hot shower and a glass of good scotch right now…’
‘Yeah, hi,’ the scientist smiled as he shook Loki’s hand, his smile then becoming a little questionable as he tried to wipe the blue paint from his hand on the grass. ‘Just call me Bruce, okay?’ As Loki nodded, Bruce turned his attention towards Peter. ‘Need a hand here, or…?’ he asked, wanting to help the teen up.
Amora’s hands balled into fists and yellow energy glowed around them. Steve and the other Avengers noted her hands with alarm.
“It’s a long story.” Steve hedged giving Tony a glance, Thor raised his eyebrows in confusion but quickly jumped over to his no longer missing friend.
Steve and Tony were curled together, Tony half laying on top of Steve. They were in the skylight room, wrapped in a blanket and looking up at the stars.
“I will be a god!” Amora shouted. “My power is only overshadowed because Frigga will not let me come into my full potential. She will not give me the title goddess.” She ranted, her eyes glazing over as she lost herself to a fantasy. “But I will have it! When Thor marries me I will become a goddess by right!”
2. Finally! Bucky’s POV is out there. I feel like Bucky’s had it rough. His friend died, his bff then dove into a half-thought-out plan to save said friend. Then the bff starts acting like “Peggy who? Boy is the new guy hot!” Like wtf?! And everyone is acting like he’s the crazy one.
the opening of the new play.” Phil cut in as he waltzed into the room everyone was gathered in. “You all have fifteen minutes to get ready before we head out to the downtown theatre.”
Bucky gave the god an outraged look. Steve gave Sam a smirk then joined in the banter. “He’s right, you have looked pretty sloppy bud.”
Peggy Carter was a little older than Steve and Bucky and was an extremely capable woman. She had brains and brawns, and ran the books for Howard’s office. She was also Steve’s girlfriend. She, like many others, moved into the city after Howard had built it up. Howard immediately offered her a job and she more than proved herself a very capable worker. She could have any man or woman that she wanted, and she chose Steve. The gangly blonde man, that followed Howard Stark around like a shadow, waiting for his next opportunity to be useful. Steve still couldn't believe how lucky he was.
“How long has your family lived in New Thebes?” Natasha inquired while grabbing the dice for her roll.
A haunted look flit past Erskine's eyes and Steve remembered him talking about the past people he trained.
Falcon had given the trio a casual smile and wave. Which all of them returned though it was tinged with confusion.
2. I hate this chapter. I wrote and rewrote this so many times, and at this point I’m done, I don’t love this final result but I can’t do it anymore. I got the points across: Erskine is selective, picked Steve, Steve transformed, Thor is around often and forming friendship with them.
Tony hadn’t moved but the Avengers were starting to get enough of their barings and strength to stand up. So far, Clint had pulled himself into a kneeling position and was patting the ground. Natasha was able to get up to one knee. Sam was doing the best. He had already stood up and was now bent over with his hands on his knees, taking some deep breaths. Getting your strengths knocked out of you really did a number.
It seemed like Steve’s side and Tony’s side would drift apart and never be as close again, if not for Thor and his frantic phone call. Loki had run away.
He had worked so hard, he had researched every chance he could. He tried as hard as he could to give Tony his freedom. Then the Avengers had to ruin it! They turned Thor from him and then made a fool of Tony. And yet Loki had still managed to give Tony his freedom. Only for Amora to then ruin everything!
“Maybe he went to the Monster Bog.” Bruce suggested. “It’s been awhile since he’s been able to work. Maybe he went to do some research and didn’t notice the time.”
“What? Wait! You don’t know where it is!” Tony exclaimed as he followed after the retreating god’s back.
“I’ve thrown creature after creature at you. And yet you still live.” Loki huffed as if it was such an inconvenience. The Avengers all glared at the god who only continued talking. “Finally I decided I needed to learn more about you.” He folded his hands together and pointed the tips of his fingers at the group. “I didn’t end up getting your weaknesses, but I did learn your strengths.”
Tony then smiled and grabbed one of the arrows and lit it on fire with some flint he had brought with him. Fenrir visibly perked up and began yipping and jumping in excitement.
“Nice shot!” Tony cheered earning a glare from both immortals. Tony only gave them a glance then zeroed in on the fight.
“This has to be awkward for you.” Jarvis continued on then turned to Tony in concern. “I feel awkward.”
Loki looked around then began to pace as he mulled everything over. Tony scoffed and made to go inside, the god could teleport over to him once he was done. However, before he could make it through the door, Loki spoke.
“That mortal!” Loki seethed, he then glared at Tony who flinched a bit at the amount of sudden anger in Loki’s eyes. “What happened?”
“Nothing.” Thor answered immediately. “I believe Steve is a True Hero. But I am not the one who can give out that title.”
“That guy doesn’t understand what the word NO means, nor does he seem to understand anatomy.” Tony gestured to himself and a chuckle bubbled out of Loki.
“It’s not my wish. I do not care. Hel is the one with the rules. This realm is older than I and far older than you and it has rules that must be followed. Your soul has died and in me granting you life again someone must take your place as your “death”.”
“Steve….” He turned and locked eyes with his best friend. “Do you even remember why we’re doing this?” Steve’s eyebrows shot up as Bucky came at him with more questions. “Did you forget? Because when you’re around him you act like, like…” Steve’s face became stormy but Bucky wouldn’t back down. “Like your replacing her.”
Everyone shook their head in the negative or scoffed at the very notion. Loki let them get it out of their system before another smirk took over his face.
“Yeah…” Tony looked down and his eyes darted around for a few seconds. “Ok!” He made his way over to Bucky. “I appreciate the apology, and consider it water under the bridge.” Bucky looked shocked as Tony lightly slapped his shoulder.
Loki then stomped over to the entrance of his Throne Room. He let out a green ball of light and whispered his snake’s name into it. The ball then took off to go retrieve Jörmungandr.
“ENOUGH!” Loki shot up from his throne, blue bleeding over his face and arms. “Take it or leave it Thor!”
Loki had recruited a handful of monsters but trying to get them to do anything other than torture lost/deserving shades was a useless endeavor. Even his favorite pets wouldn’t do as he requested. Fenrir only growled at shades and tried to use them as chew toys. And Jörmungandr was even worse, he would lay about and coil in odd areas, impeding shades travels rather than help them.
“I was doing an experiment based on what some of the shades told me, but I think I miscalculated or something.” Tony explained while Loki’s anger and frustration only increased, causing the room to become colder as his skin took on a dark shade of blue and his eyes a stormy red.
“Tony.” Said man gave the same smirk he had given Steve earlier and it once again caused the blonde to blush crimson. “And I’m alright.”
Sorry for the late update. I got back from my work conference late Thursday and didn't have enough time to do a final read thru till tonight.
Loki then felt his deal with the Avengers become broken. His eyes bulged and his mouth dropped open in shock and horror.
It wasn’t fair! He wasn’t supposed to be like this. He wasn’t egotistical and pompous. Instead Steve was humble and could only retell his adventures as if he was writing up a report. He was kind and sweet. He didn’t go out and flex so passerbys would fall to their knees. He instead tried to duck and hide so people didn’t notice him. He also drew art in his spare time. Because if the man didn’t already have “Perfect” stamped on him, throw in that he’s also an artist.
2. Amora is the character I wanted to introduce in chap 4. I couldn’t fit her in seamlessly then but now I think it works. And yes she’s always been a bitch to Tony. He’s an easy target to take her anger out on. He’s close to Loki and so she takes her anger about thorki out on him since she can’t touch Loki or Thor.
Tony was in trouble. He was in so much trouble. And he was having a hard time digging himself out. Tony may be falling a little, tiny bit, in love with Steve.
Tony threw Loki a confused look and startled when he finally realized Loki’s skin was white and his eyes emerald green.
Just after the 2 year mark Thor had left the mortals to go visit his lover, Lord Loki. Bucky and Steve worried for their immortal friend but he waved their concern off.
“Everyone get to the shelters!” Steve ordered and then the other Avengers followed suit in telling the citizens to take cover.
“It says follow the yellow path till you get to the river Styx. This is obviously that river.” Steve stated gesturing to the instructions on the map.
“Ack! What are you doing?!” Tony exclaimed as he tried to get his bearings after being manhandled so easily.
A few weeks later at one of the weekly meetings Tony, Pepper, Natasha, and Jan began planning Steve and Tony’s wedding. Tony asked for Steve’s input but he brushed them off saying he didn’t care about the details. They all joked that he would regret that. Bruce got engaged that next week. Unlike Steve and Tony’s and Jan and Hank’s engagement, his was private. Betty asked Bruce right as they were about to head to bed. He said yes then ran to his dresser and puled out the ring he had bought and she said yes.
Steve took a few deep breaths and held up a hand to make sure Bucky knew he just needed a minute. Finally he spoke, still keeping his head down, eyes locked downwards.
Thor had been arguing with his father, Odin, while his mother, Frigga, was playing the mediator -or at least trying to be the mediator. The argument was a familiar one, Loki.
The Scepter of the Dead allowed the wielder to look into the story of the shade it examined. It also showed the souls linked to the shade, who they are, and how they were tied together.
Bruce had decided he would stay behind in New Thebes City. He reasoned that he wanted to let Betty know he was ok and would inform the city guard that the threats should cease now. So after Frigga had bestowed the title True Hero upon Steve, and healed Sam’s leg, she had taken off back to Asgard.
“ARGH!” Tony let out, frustrated at himself for once again thinking the Avengers were somehow better than all the heroes he’s known before.
Steve was on the back of the centaur, riding it like a crazed horse. Tony looked back to the scene and broke into laughter. Steve then yelled something to Bucky and the man jumped into action. He threw a lasso around the centaurs raised back legs and yanked the line taunt.
The Great War had ended 6 years ago and now trade was booming again. New cities were and had been built and old cities were either left in the shambles the war had made of them or built back up. Steve was just a child when the war was going on, but he lost both his parents to the fight. Steve had wanted nothing more than to help but he was a sickly child and was often told he was more a hindrance than a help. However he wasn’t the only one who had lost people to the war. His best friend James Buchanan Barnes or Bucky, had also lost his father. His mother and sister however survived and took to raising Steve after news of his parents arrived.
Rhodey was also thrilled Tony would be getting his freedom. “Good! Loki’s getting more and more unhinged thanks to this mess. I’m glad you’re getting out of the firing zone.”
“Enough Steve! I get it! He’s a god! Your only mortal! So-” Tony shrugged as if the ending was a foregone conclusion.
“Well that's the difference between being a god and a witch, isn’t it.” Tony commented flippantly and Amora’s anger rose.
Steve then used his grip on Tony’s hips to keep up a slow pace. He moaned as Tony would periodically squeeze around him. But he had a very hard time looking away from Tony’s face. The man was panting then moaned loudly as Steve angled his hips a certain way.
“...What is the plan here Loki?” Amora asked, she knew Loki would not help this human. She knew he wanted him dead as much as Amora did.
Once King Minos had been put in proper restraints the high ranking court member announced they’d hold a trial and in the meantime control of the country would go to Queen Pasiphae. Tony then climbed off the Royal Box while Asterion walked towards it and his mother.
“And everyone believes Thor!” Loki almost sung the sentence. “You know he may play the lovable fool but he does know trickery and mischief. I have known him my entire life! He can lie and smile while doing so!” The god ranted, a tint of blue creeping up his arms. He then took a few deep breaths and calmed himself so the blue receded. “But I did not teach you that. I did not think I needed to. For that, I apologize.” Loki nodded his horned head.
But Steve’s eyebrows just scrunched together in a glare of defiance. They couldn’t talk but they could control their facial expressions it seemed. At Steve’s glare Amora appeared disappointed.
Bucky and Rhodey began a yelling match. Sam joined in and Natasha joined in as well, however she was on Tony’s side. Clint and Hank also got into it, both trying to defend their friend. Betty and Bruce were on a date that night and Thor was with Loki that night, so they were absent from the fight that was termed “the Civil War”. That was the last weekly meet up for the whole gang.
Howard looked aghast as his dead eyes frantically darted around. “Is there...is there any other way?”
“Next time Steve has to sit out.” Bucky added as he shoved his blonde friend “What were you thinking running out there alone?”
The brunette then mentally shook himself and plastered on a smile. “It’s fine, and hey that’s the price you pay for being a super star.”
“We were told that the Hulk is a giant green ogre, that terrorizes people.” Steve said trying to put the Bruce Tony described and the monster they heard about together.
‘Oh, is that so, detective?’ Tony smirked as he crossed his arms and leaned in the doorway. ‘That is such a shame, especially since I wanted to talk to you about a very big personal problem.’ He walked into the bathroom with a pout, his hands folded behind his back.
‘N-no…’ Peter muttered, chest heaving as tears slowly filled his eyes again. ‘B-but… what does that even mean? Guinea pigs for what?’
Loki did not really know how to reply to that, so he settled with a slight smile and a nod of his head.
Tony managed to look at his boyfriend with a straight face for at least a full minute, but he couldn’t keep himself from laughing any longer and he just covered his eyes with his hand as he let himself lean against the couch. ‘Bless your pure and ignorant heart, Rogers. Really.’
‘Oh, this?’ The blond looked at his body. ‘Yeah, not very appealing, huh?’ he shrugged, a half sided smile on his face. ‘Don’t worry about it. Try to get some sleep, okay?’
‘Huh, that’s strange,’ Tony remarked and turned towards the ex-soldier who was standing next to Wanda. ‘Makes me wonder who was taking that shower.’
She gasped, her soaked hands covering her mouth as she saw the lifeless body of Aldrich Killian, covered in the mud-stained American flag.
‘Aldrich came to me about a year ago, offering me a deal to buy my company. I rejected. He was, how should I put it…
‘… I know!’ Peter then said quickly, looking at both gods. ‘How about you go take your bath, like you are supposed to do, and then, when you’re done, we can watch a movie together.’
Tony drove up the ridiculously large driveway, stopping in front of the grand entrance of the mansion. The two stepped out of the car, the gravel path grinding beneath their feet as they made their way towards the front door.
Yes, just a few more minutes, Loki thought as he closed his eyes again, his head resting on the broad chest of the blond.
‘Was that supposed to be a hint or something?’ Steve sighed with a smile and he shook his head, ‘Loki’s gonna be back to normal, hopefully soon, you know that, right?’
Loki nodded in excitement and stretched his arms out to take the paper and colorful markers the blond handed to him.
He turned his gaze towards his master, but Tony kept staring ahead, his hands still clasped around the wheel.
It will be a Stony/Stucky fic with a very Dark, or rather, desperate, Tony. (lots of cute parts and lots of cruel parts)
‘Well, I’ll just have to try again. Maybe he’s still sleeping,’ the woman said determinately, a grin on her face as she ignored the indifferent shrug her friend gave her as he walked away.
‘Nah, I’m good. I’m going to bed,’ Peter said as he stood up, quickly hugging both his fathers before he crouched down in front of Loki and Thor. ‘You are going to bed now too, right? You promised.’
‘Steve, please don’t,’ Tony tried but with a shake of its head, the captain burst through the front door, and ran into the darkness.
Thor nodded and he gulped, ‘I went inside, closed the door behind me. I saw that all the lights were still on and that Loki was not in his bed. He had left the uhm, the bathroom door unlocked so I…’ Thor took a deep breath, trying to steady his trembling voice. ‘I peeked inside, and I- I saw Loki, standing there. He was… crying and shivering, his skin was all red from the hot water…’ He fell silent as the vision of his younger brother was burned into his eyes.
‘There are no toys,’ the young raven concluded sadly as he looked through some pages from a spell book on the desk. ‘It is almost like a guest room… Do I not have things of my own? Maybe some stuffed animals or drawings?’ he asked as he let his fingers touch the cold white wall, a shiver running down his small body.
‘Walt Disney sure has come a long way ever since the war,’ Steve said in wonder, collecting the large empty bowls which were filled with popcorn and chips. ‘I know him mostly by his training and educational animations for the military during the war, but this is much more fun to watch.’
Loki looked up at the teen, his emerald eyes glistening with tears which threatened to roll down his cheeks. He removed his hands from his ears and quickly wrapped his arms around the teen’s neck as he nodded. ‘I am scared…’
The soldier reluctantly walked along with the two towards the mansion, stopping halfway as they were already out of ears’ reach. ‘What do you want?’
He quickly shook his head, mumbling some curses as he saw the first signs of dawn. He threw his legs over the edge of his bed and rubbed his eyes, trying desperately to get Steve out of his mind and continue his life the way he used to. A life of partying, tinkering with tech in his lab and…
‘Peter, I swear I meant no harm. I did it because of him,’ Loki sighed desperately, pointing at Tony.
But even the playboy knew that they could not stop to rest, for the rain that kept falling down was threatening to erase the footsteps of the Beast they were looking for.
The doll remained silent, though it did look like it was genuinely trying to answer its owner’s question.
The starlord casually leaned against the shopping cart and he looked at Peter. ‘Well?’ he asked, signaling the teen to hop in with a nod of his head.
‘A shower? At midnight?’ Steve squinted his eyes. ‘Isn’t that strange? Don’t Loki and Thor share that room?’ The blond continued before Bucky could even reply. ‘Was Loki still up that late at night?’
‘Well, I say we hurry too, so I can continue to read my favorite book,’ Tony sighed as he crossed his arms, causing the others to look at him with a questioning expression. ‘What? It is my favorite book because- “
‘Sure do, Tony texted me. I’m Steve. I’d give you a hand, but,’ the captain said as he showed his hands, which were stained by the charcoal pencil he was drawing with.
‘I… I don’t know what to say, Tony,’ Stane sighed and turned his head after watching only a few seconds of one of Steve’s memories.
‘Okay, creepy. Definitely creepy.’ Tony rubbed his eyes as he let himself fall on his couch. Surely the doll looked amazing. It was almost indistinguishable from a real human. Its soft skin, its body heat, the way its chest moved as if to breath.
‘Uhm, hi,’ Bruce replied as he looked at the teen who was still lying on the ground. His eyes then shifted towards the raven god, who nervously held on to his pebble with two small hands. ‘Loki, I assume?’ he asked as casually as possible.
‘I will never get used to that,’ Banner sighed as he placed his hand on his heart, taking a deep breath.
‘Oh, come on,’ Strange sighed deeply, but as he saw some snot running from the child’s nose, he pulled a face and quickly placed the raven back on the ground. ‘Ew. Okay, Loki, listen, why are nice to everyone, yet I get a book to the face?’
‘Loki, can you tell me, again, what the relationship was between you and Mister Killian?’ Steve started, his gentle blue eyes gazing at the slightly nervous teen across from him.
‘“poor thing?”’ Clint repeated with a raised brow, ‘we are talking about the same guy here, right? God of Mischief, the Liesmith, the Silvertongue and what not? I mean, he’s an Avenger now but,’ but as he then looked at the small innocent child, who was trying to hide in his brother’s arms, he sighed. ‘Yeah, okay, I get it. Can’t you do something about this, Thor?’
The two walked out of the blond’s workplace and down the long hallway. They slowed their pace as they passed Fury’s office, their ears pricked up as they heard a familiar voice.
Peter nodded; his eyes drawn to the doll in her hands. It looked somewhat like a rabbit coming straight out of a horror movie. ‘That’s a-uhm… Interesting toy you got there.’
‘Yeah, sure, he’s right,’ Sam turned around, only now noticing that the trickster wasn’t standing next to him anymore, ‘Thor, I swear, he was just here a minute ago.’
Steve sighed as he stood up. ‘And then there’s that,’ he grumbled as he made his way towards Fury’s office.
Loki’s eyes grew wide and he looked up as he heard an unamused voice talking to him, looking straight into the brown eyes of the stranger who was just talking to his brother.
‘I just don’t understand why he has to be so damn protective over his brother,’ Tony complained as he and Steve walked thought the doors of the police station. ‘I mean, it’s not like the kid’s five anymore.’
‘Well, what can I say?’ Pepper sighed. ‘He was an attractive and charming man, but I didn’t share a bed with him. I let him look at my spreadsheets not at my spread legs.’ She met Tony’s gaze with an equally cocky smirk, clearly surprising the man with her words.
‘Peter, please, I know what I am doing.’ Loki snapped agitatedly, but as he looked at the teen’s worried expression, he sighed. ‘Listen, Peter, I am truly sorry… I meant what I said, I just wanted to help…’
‘I don’t have a son, master.’ The blond stated, a tremble in his voice. ‘I- I have no data or other records other than the ones you already have access to.’
He saw the blond sitting completely frozen on the edge of his bed, trembling and waiting for his master to tell him what to do. His milky eyes held no soul, yet now did seem filled with terror.
Peter stopped for a moment, first looking at Tony and Thor, who did not seem to notice the god’s wary appearance, then looking at Loki again. ‘There you go, now let’s move, people.’ The teen tried to cheer the trickster on as Loki now walked next to him.
Loki and Thor argued back and forth in the lounge, both sides stubborn as a mule, both sides not willing to give in just yet.
‘Nah, let them argue, they sounded like an old married couple. It was pretty funny, actually.’ Tony then stood up, holding onto the captain’s hands and pulling him up with him. ‘So, what do you say? Netflix? Or maybe we could first share a shower? You do know showering together is way better for the environment, right?’
‘I don’t know.’ The doll stared at the empty wall in front of him, not daring to meet his master’s eye. ‘I have no existing data on a child.’
She then squinted her eyes and looked up, noticing that the American flag that used to hang proudly on the outside of the building was gone. Instinctively she looked down, figuring it must have fallen.
Tony and Steve remained speechless, the sight of the teen’s abused and trembling body taking away their very voice.
‘Yes, the Destroyer,’ Strange nodded and folded his hands, ‘I think I have every right to keep him on my list, just to be sure.’
Stane sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. He didn’t look up as three men entered the basement, their faces hidden underneath the yellow suit they were wearing, their gloved hands filled with tools and paperwork. Steve recognized them as his creators. One of them walked up to Obadiah and whispered something in his ear.
The room suddenly fell awfully quiet. Most of the Avengers staring at their empty plates while others turned towards each other.
‘Oh, but we can,’ Tony smiled as he reached for the door handle. ‘Obstruction of an investigation is something we don’t take very lightly here in America.’
Tony panted for a minute, relying on his boyfriend to hold him while he caught his breath. He turned around and smirked as he saw Steve’s wild eyes, ‘Almost, sir,’ he whispered, then pressed his lips against the blond’s mouth, kissing him passionately.
‘No, and yes,’ the blond rubbed the bridge of his nose, ‘there is nothing to do but to wait for the spell to wear off.’
‘If you would be so kind as to make a start,’ the god nodded, ‘I will make sure to be up there soon.’ He waited for the captain to leave the room, a gentle smile on his face as he saw his baby brother yawn.
The blond remained silent for a moment. His hand amiably moving through black hair as he wondered whether he should tell him the truth.
Tony stared, unable to respond other than to smile back. Steve looked so content, so unlike the traumatized sex doll who sat at the edge of his bed mere minutes ago. He looked flawless in Tony’s favorite black sweatpants, the sweater he was wearing, though being a bit too small, colored perfectly with what once were sky blue eyes. Tony swallowed hard as he had to remind himself the blond was still a machine.
‘Come on now, we have got no time to waste on whining,’ Thor said sternly as he looked at the tracks, ‘I think we are getting close, these foot prints are fresh.’
‘So, your name,’ he pointed at the dog tag. ‘Steven, right? I’m gonna call you Steve. ‘T suits you.’ Tony raised a brow, wondering why he was having a conversation with a sex doll. Yet he had to admit that talking with the blond did feel very natural and easy. It was like talking to Jarvis, or even another human.
‘Fuck…’ he quickly jumped to his feet and paced up and down the room, hands tangled in his hair. This machine- this
Thor was relieved to hear the verdict. He would take his brother to the realm he protected, to his friends, and together they could work on a better future for him, for them both. After much commotion and seemingly endless discussions at S.H.I.E.L.D., the Avengers reluctantly decided to let Loki live among them. After all, what better place to keep an eye on a villain than in a building swarming with heroes.
Bucky was unconscious after receiving the blow and his friends worried over him while a doctor from the town looked him over. The doctor later announced Bucky should be fine, he just suffered a small concussion and he needed rest.
“Yes.” Erskine smiled then stopped walking and folded his arms behind his back. “But there is an issue.” Steve’s smile dropped and he gave the older man an inquisitive look. “You are a good man Steve and will make a good hero, mentally. Physically, the wind could knock you over.”
“Friends! Allow me to introduce the great hero Falcon!” Thor exclaimed in a booming volume as he gestured to the man he had brought with him.
Tony swore he meant to pull away and not to deepen the kiss. But the man was weak. Other than a few incubuses that worked in Hel, he had little experience in kissing (incubuses didn’t quite care for kissing). He definitely had no experience in kissing people. And Steve was a great kisser.
“Your sight.” He pointed a finger at Clint. “Your acrobatics.” the finger moved to Natasha “Your power” Bruce. “Your wings.” Sam. “Your weapon skills.” Bucky. “And,” The finger moved to Steve and Loki glowered. “Everything you gained from that Asgardian water.”
Said man looked both hopeful and trepedicious at the blonde’s tone. However before Steve could say another word a woman screaming and in a clear panic ran onto the beach. She was shouting for the Avengers.
They all made it back to Tony’s front door in no time. Then Bucky barreled in, throwing open the front door and running towards the garden area he saw Lord Loki and Tony in just a few minutes ago. Everyone followed after him, Natasha and Clint even had their weapons out on the off chance Bucky was correct about a threat.
“It’s the safest for Asterion and that’s what matters most.” Bucky finished. “Otherwise we’d be accusing Minos with no solid proof and Minos would just get someone else to kill him.”
“Yeah.” Tony rolled his shoulders then put on an unaffected face. “I’m using his affections as an in. I’ll get the homewreckers weaknesses then give them to Loki.” He smacked his lips and hands together. “And everyone wins.”
Once Howard touched his shoulder Steve’s head snapped up. He blinked a few times then cleared his throat, “Sorry Howard,” He apologized in a rough voice. “What, uh, what were you saying?”
Instead he just looked the map over as if checking he was going the right direction. He then turned to his side.
“What?” Tony would defend himself when another creature with amorous/lustful feelings would appear on their doorstep. “I did a lot of recruiting jobs Steve.”
“Here’s the trade off.” He said in a nonchalant manner. “You all give me your strengths for the next 48 hours.” He snapped his fingers.
“If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.” Natasha mused glaring at a random passerby who took too long to move past them.
Tony had taken Loki’s suggestion to heart and went to the Field of Content Souls. At first Rhodey would accompany him, but then Tony grew more and more comfortable and thus waved off Rhodey’s babysitting. He learned countless things: languages, cultural outlooks, fighting styles, how to sing, and some trade secrets. Loki had been correct, a whole world of knowledge was at his feet and he itched to obtain as much as possible. He wanted to spend all his free time with the souls of the dead, asking them questions and learning what they had to teach.
“What?” Bucky snapped again, Steve only looked lost. Bucky looked at Steve then grit his teeth. “You have to! Lord Thor said you’d help Steve become a True Hero.”
“Steve.” Tony smiled. “Thanks for the offer but I’m good. I can actually take care of myself.” He then grabbed the blue cape he had thrown over one shoulder and wrapped it around himself like a shawl. “But I am going to be keeping your cape.”
The group fell silent for a moment, Tony being the first to open his mouth, ‘So that girl finally dared to speak and then…’
‘Loki,’ Steve eventually started after clearing his throat. ‘Did you kill Mister Killian? Did you push him out of the window, because you couldn’t take it anymore?’
‘… No way,’ Quill let out in complete disbelief, a wide grin following soon after. ‘Oh my God… Is this… is this really…?’ he asked, looking at Thor while pointing at the child.
‘Thor, Steve told me to come and get you for lunch. People are already starting without you.’ The young raven came to his brother’s side, one hand resting on the older god’s leg to get his attention. He then looked up at the starlord and tilted his head. ‘Is this man a friend? Is he family as well?’
‘How many times are you going to bother us, Mister Rogers?’ Pepper asked as she crossed her arms. The cold fluorescent ceiling lights casting shadows on her brown eyes. ‘Aldrich’s death was an accident so why am I here in this interrogation room?’
‘So… you really have no idea how that footage got on there?’ The anger in the playboy’s voice started to fade, though the suspicion remained. ‘You really didn’t do anything to him?’
Loki spend about thirty minutes on his drawing, the tip of his tongue sticking out of his mouth as he concentrated on the details, his hands and face decorated with colorful streaks from his markers. ‘Done!’ He shouted, holding up his drawing with a proud smile.
But as the captain let himself slumber against the wall and to the floor, the god’s smile faded. ‘Steven…?’
‘Okay, you wait here while I’ll go, uhm, look for something for you to do, okay?’ she said as she gestured the raven to take place on the white leather couch. ‘You’ll watch him for a minute, won’t you?’ She then said, turning her attention to the Winter Soldier who was casually sitting on the other side of the couch, legs crossed, reading his newspaper. The sternness in the assassin’s voice making it sound more like a command than a question, leaving the soldier without much options.
‘Sprained, I bet…’ he nodded. ‘Okay, just try to grab on to the banister, use it as a support to get down. Think you can do that?’
Again, the doll obliged. He got to his knees and quickly caught the bug, keeping a firm hold yet at the same time being careful not to crush it. It was as big as the doll’s hand, its wings flapping frantically in his palm. Steve looked up at his master for his next order.
He wondered what their new mom would be like. Whether she would be kind and pretty, give them hugs before they would go to school and wish them goodnight when they would go to bed. He wondered what their home would be like. If they would have a big house with a garden or if they would live in an apartment. Maybe they had pets. Cats, dogs, birds, Peter couldn’t wait to find out.
‘... Sure,’ Bucky nodded, taking another sip of his drink while Loki quickly scooted next to him on his knees, his fingers now carefully scanning the cold metal.
‘Thank you,’ Pepper managed to smile after taking a deep breath. She sat down like a true lady, her feet placed neatly next to each other, her hands crossed on her lap, holding a white clutch. ‘I couldn’t believe it when Bucky told me and, frankly, I still can’t.’
Anyway, see you guys in a few days, and thank you so much for spending your precious free time on reading my fic!
Obadiah’s blood started to boil, his teeth gritted. ‘How many times do I have to remind you not to ask questions?’ His words came out calm yet dripped with frustration and fury. ‘How many times have I told you to shut up?!’
This chapter will contain porn. If you don't feel comfortable with reading that than please skip the text between the two * marks.
‘You keep your mouth shut, Winter.’ Natasha warned him as she crossed her arms, her expression dark.
‘This is not working,’ Thor remarked as he placed a hand on the teen’s shoulder and then turned his gaze towards the playboy. ‘You are up, Sir Belle.’
‘Me? Yeah right, as if I would ever be your subordinate.’ Tony let out a scoffing snort but he quickly got back into character as he saw the child’s disappointed expression. He cleared his throat and continued, ‘I mean, as you can see, I am in charge of creating weaponry, I have no time to spare on actual battle, however! If you will go up the stairs, I am certain you will find a fine warrior who is worthy to stand in your small, tiny shadow!’
‘Oh yeah?’ Sam smirked, ‘Well take a good look at this,’ he then ran a few steps forward and blasted off into the air. He twisted and twirled through the sky like a stunt pilot, showing off everything the harness had to offer, covering great lengths in rapid speeds. As he saw Loki cheering and waving, an idea popped into his head. He dived down, staying low to the ground and, in a swift motion, lifted the raven off his feet.
Tony looked at the god for a moment and then at sweets carefully placed in the grass, suddenly wondering why the trickster did not just hand them to him. ‘Fine,’ he agreed, grabbing two sweets, Peter and Thor doing the same.
‘No fucking way,’ was the only thing Clint managed to reply with. ‘You’re Loki? Brother of Thor? Are you serious?’
‘Yes, well it’s not my fault that you pick boring movies,’ Tony shrugged and he pulled the captain closer, pressing his lips against those of the blond, his hands now softly massaging the back of his neck. ‘plus, it is also not my fault that I had something way more interesting lying next to me.’
‘No, he cannot,’ Loki said, sitting between the two men, his legs crossed. ‘I do not believe anyone can.’ He added, taking another sip from his strawberry flavored slurpee.
These are all some rough ideas, as you can see. These fics will be a little darker than this one :) Please let me know if you like any of these ideas OR if you have any suggestions! I'm open for everything :)
Stane finally seemed to collect himself, his gaze completely focused on the doll’s azure eyes. They should be without soul, nothing but empty husks. Yet they were filled with pain, with fear and desolation. ‘Always those disgusting eyes,’ he straightened his jacked and moved a hand through his slightly tousled hair. ‘You want to know what happens to your little boy when we find him?’
‘Oh dear Norns…’ Loki whispered, ‘it is starting to effect us as well…' he then looked up at his older brother, ‘Zeus, who had inherited the heavens, and Hades, who inherited the underworld, had one more brother, Poseidon.’
Steve looked at his partner with one brow raised. As Tony merely smiled back and reacted with an innocent “what?” the blond just sighed. ‘Where’s Romanoff?’
And that's it for today, really hoped you enjoyed the Steve/Tony part (I just love writing for those two!)
‘What?!’ Thor uttered, looking at his little brother who looked back at him with a smirk. ‘That is ridiculous! I just told Loki to take a bath and go to bed.’
Peter’s lips parted for a split second, only for him to jump to his feet again. ‘Where’s Steve...?’ he asked with as much bravery as he could muster. ‘Where’s my dad?’
‘Loki and Thor Odinson,’ Natasha started as she read from her tabled. She sat down at the edge of Steve’s desk, Tony and Sam at her side. ‘Refugees from the Faroe Islands. Their father, Odin Borson, was a drug lord and killed ten years ago together with his wife. Thor took Loki and fled the country otherwise they would have been killed as well. They were eighteen and ten at that time.’
‘What will happen to Loki?’ Natasha asked Steve but he did not respond. ‘Rogers?’ She tried again, gaining the man’s attention with a short “hm?”. Natasha frowned, ‘What’s wrong?’
The blond parted his lips, recalling the events that were still saved on his memory. ‘He used me for sexual pleasure. Tied me up, beaten me, strangled me, cut me.’
Loki has been on Earth for one and a half year now, his verdict had ended six months ago. Surely the god knew of this, but he never left, so that must mean he likes it here, right? That must mean that he is happy. Right?
Peter remained silent for a moment, then limped towards Steve’s cot. ‘Will it fit?’ he asked softly. ‘The two of us…? I-if you don’t’ mind-’
Tony stared at the raven who was now running circles around the table, hammer still in the air, laughing all the while. ‘Friday… what the fuck is going on here?’
Determent to find out what was downstairs, Loki held on to the handrails and made his way to the lower floor.
