Steve busied himself with various tasks, reading reports, working out, reading up on missed history, more working out. There were times when he simply paced back and forth in his room counting to ten and starting over again. It wasn't the greatest use of his time, but it was all Steve could do to keep his mind occupied and prevent it from drifting to dangerous territory.
“We don't have too...” He whispered. Tony answered Steve with a hard kiss and boldly he reached his right hand down and gripped Steve's cock in his hand. The action made Steve gasp and his hips bucked forward.
“Oh, oh God Tony!” Steve moaned as he thrust into the man below him. “You feel so good.” Tony titled his head back, eyes closing as the pleasure coursed through his body, he practically wailed at the intensity when the head of Steve's cock hit his prostate.
Tony regarded Steve for several moments as he thought over Steve's additions. “I can agree to those terms, as I have no intention of really involving myself with anyone else. Regardless of my reputation I am actually respectable when it comes to being monogamous, however I am known to be a notorious flirt so you will have to put up with that to a degree.”
Steve's eyes widened and he felt the blood drain from his face as it all came into place. This wasn't Thanos...Tony had done this to himself...purposely. The measures that Tony had taken, mutilating himself in an effort to prepare for another battle. What desperation had he felt to make that kind of decision? The full realization of their predicament hit Steve full force all in that moment, at seeing Tony so broken. Thanos had beaten them, the remains of the Avengers had failed the world.
Steve crawled up and over Tony, wiping away the excess fluids from his mouth before leaning down to kiss him. Tony returned the kiss lazily and slowly, he felt like he was flying high on endorphins just in a blissful wonderful state of post orgasm hormones. It took him a moment to register when Steve had pulled back and had left the bed.
“Three days...” Steve sighed and thumped his head against the back of the bed. He sniffled again, what he would give to have use of his hands to blow his nose. “and...Tony is he?”
“What things exactly? Steve...I want you to know something. I only regret what happened because of how it has affected you. Otherwise it wasn't so bad. Sure giant mutant bug and all, but if it had to be anyone I would rather it had been with you.” Tony tightened his grip on Steve's shoulder, a slight squeeze of reassurance. “Once I was out of the quarantine and after our little talk I took a few shots, a much needed shower and jerked off. You're not the only one having these feelings about it, but it seems I have the ability to compartmentalize, disassociate and cope in a different way than you.”
Steve took a headcount. Okoye, Natasha, Bruce, Rhodey Thor, Shuri and the talking raccoon called Rocket. There were handful of people left of the other tribes, but other than that there were few warriors left in Wakanda. Steve felt as if he were still reeling, falling into an endless void. Bucky had just...vanished...before his eyes. Ashes on the ground as if he had never existed at all. He kept his hands clasped firmly on his belt so the others couldn't see them shaking.
He sighed heavily and ran a hand down his face then glanced back over to Steve. Deep down...Tony missed having him around, Tony didn't relinquish authority over to just anyone, but he had been fine with giving Steve the title of team leader. If Steve let him they could both walk away from this unscathed as long as neither of them brought up the past. There was an easy way to fix that, if he could get Steve to cooperate. Tony steeled his nerves, grabbed his glass and stood up walking over to Steve's table.
Steve coughed and hacked some more from the powdery substance, he wiped the remaining residue from his face and rubbed it between his fingers. It was thicker than powder, a heavier consistency like pollen. He wondered if if were some kind of poison and hoped that the serum could protect him long enough from any of the ill affects. Having wasted too much time Steve heaved his shield preparing to impale the edge of it into the centipede's grotesque body.
It felt like only a few more strokes and Steve too was coming, the orgasm feeling almost explosive. He came with a shout, his hips thrusting up into Tony with each pulse from his oversensitive cock. A pleasant tingly feeling overtook him and Steve sat back against the bed with a sigh. He pulled their interlocked hands away from the arc reactor and Steve pressed a kiss to Tony's hand.
When Tony assured Steve he was good Steve coated himself with the lube and tossed the bottle aside. He positioned himself nudging the head of his cock between the cleft of Tony's ass, and pressed right against the rim. Steve met Tony's eyes waiting, wondering if Tony was going to back out at the last moment, but Tony gave him a nod.
“I suppose I could give it a try.” Steve replied at last. “I mean...it would be cheaper than hiring a model and their schedules may be more flexible.”
Tony didn't often show it, but he was always disappointed when his parents chose to go on a vacation together during the holidays, and leaving him behind. It was like clockwork each year he would come home for Christmas to see them packing their bags to travel to some fancy beach in the Bahamas. This year was especially hurtful as it was Tony's first Christmas since graduating college. He had hoped they would at least alter their plans this once, after all it wasn't everyday your 18 year old son graduated college with two masters degrees. He came downstairs to get some breakfast and saw their luggage waiting by the front door, and was dismayed to know that it didn't matter to Howard. He was still upset with Tony for focusing on engineering rather than business.
“Exactly, we don't know what it is and it would be a lot safer if we just exterminate it before it hurts anyone. The thing could spew acid for all we know!” Steve argued.
“Fuck Tony!” Steve said after some time to gain his bearings. “You say the dirtiest things.” Steve lifted his head and pressed several kisses to Tony's neck and shoulder. Tony turned his head so they could kiss, sloppy and heated.
Tony reached for the bedside nightstand and opened the drawer to rummage around inside it, he smirked as he held up his prize, a bottle of lubricant. With a generous amount deposited onto his fingers Tony reached down and slid his fingers over Steve's waiting hole, who rocked his hips and whimpered with need.
“Fucking hell Steve!” Tony ground out as the last shreds of his self control receded. Steve's words had implanted themselves as lewd images in his mind, and Tony couldn't shake them once they had taken hold. -Yes- He wanted that, all of that. He wanted to get Steve down onto his hands and knees then pound his cock into that supple ass until Steve screamed in ecstasy. Good lord what was he thinking? What was happening to him?
Tony tilted his head in thought and looked down at himself sprawled out on the chaise lounge. “Well I have a suggestion.” That little smirk of his returned, just the corner of his mouth raised up as if he were in on some private joke that Steve was unaware of.
“Fuck!” Tony cursed and he gripped the bedsheets, his body going tense. Steve stopped and petted along Tony's back in slow circles.
“No! I didn't mean it like that! I meant I wanted to draw your eyes first!” Steve clapped a hand over his face. “Warm up sketches...warm up sketches!”
“Yes...yes just hold that right there.” Steve picked up a pencil and began to sketched on the paper on the canvas in front of him. It was silent for a time, just the scratching of the granite stick against the rough surface of the paper as Steve did a few quick sketches to capture his subject. Tony remained still for him and obeyed his every request for the tiniest of alterations to his positions. Once Steve was feeling relaxed and finally comfortable enough to make additional requests he asked.
There was always the option to go talk with Bruce, the doctor had told him to speak with him if he found there were additional side-affects. They were dealing with an unknown creature after all, there was always the chance that this problem he was experiencing was a result of exposure to the pollen. Only if that were so, wouldn't Tony have the same or similar symptoms? Steve couldn't possibly waltz into Tony's workshop and ask if he was having difficulty achieving an orgasm. Saying something like that would only land him back into quarantine, and he would see his mandatory leave (suspension) from duty extended.
“Nope. When we get back drop off the uniform to my shop and I'll fix it all up for you. Maybe even issue you something new, I could maybe even add this new fiber weave I have been developing.” Steve just sighed and shook his head knowing there was no sense in arguing.
“I have money, they gave me a pretty hefty pile of gold for my service. I haven't touched it since I don't know where I really want to go yet. I was biding my time here until I figured things out, and I'm certain I can offer him whatever he'll ask if it means you don't have to service others.” Steve ran his hand up and down Tony's arm in reassurance.
Their partnership hadn't started well, from the harsh words on the helicarrier and Tony's disregard for authority figures, it hadn't been the making of a great team bonding. That paired with Tony's personal hatred for Captain America for being the everything to his father that Tony could never be. Of course they had gotten over some of the early assumptions of one another, and Steve had been the one to try and make amends since Tony had nearly died to save them all.
His omega...Steve called him his omega and Tony felt a swell of pride and pleasure all at once. Tony took a breath to calm himself and to find his voice again. His words came out strained and needy, practically a keening whine. “Thinking of your cock.” He forced out. “Thinking about your knot in me. I want to watch it plunge into my wet hole. I want to feel you come in me, I want you to knot me and just use me again and again.” Tony replied nearly breathless. Steve practically growled in response. He pressed his forehead against Tony's shoulder and his arms tightened around Tony's middle.
Tony was thrusting his own hips up, meeting Steve's movements and driving his length deep into Steve's channel. The head of his cock struck Steve's prostate repeatedly, sensitive as it was had Steve wailing in ecstasy. Steve could feel the tension in his groin, like a hot coil winding tighter and tighter ready to burst. The heat in his core was rising as he grew closer to the edge of orgasm, and Steve could feel the twitching need for release along the length of his cock to his throbbing balls.
Tony nodded. “Yes-yes I'm ready I want you, please Steve!” Steve smiled and reached for the condom packet he had set aside. He ripped the package open and rolled the latex over his length.
“No one ever said they would remove you from the team. If anyone should be resigning it would be me! I am the one that violated you Steve. Is that what the issue is? You don't have to be afraid to say that to someone if I am the problem I need to know! I will leave the tower you all can have it.”
One of Tony's older gauntlet's for his armor was dropped onto it's side and not where Tony had last left it. Steve sure had been acting guilty about something too. Tony looked back towards the door and returned his attention to the gauntlet a devilish idea formed in his mind. If this was indeed what he thought it might be. Tony smirked and picked up the gauntlet suddenly feeling very optimistic about his chances with Steve.
“Nebula?” Rocket's ears perked up and he moved over to the communications console by Okoye. He saw on the monitors the ship flying in, Quill's ship, then perhaps the others were alive. Only when Rocket had left them Nebula hadn't been with them. “That's our ship, maybe she's got Gamora with her, or Drax and Quill.”
“You want to as much as I do.” Tony replied in a rough voice. Steve really couldn't argue with that point, as he was currently rutting himself against Tony's hand, but Tony had been injured already. Steve couldn't live with himself if he only added more pain.
“Regardless of what it looks like.” Steve continued ignoring Tony. “It could be dangerous so we should just kill it and move on.”
Steve walked Tony back towards the bed, his hand on Tony's waist, his thumb gently grazed over the scar in Tony's side, it was nearly healed thanks to the advanced medicines of Wakanda. Tony hissed softly and covered Steve's hand with his own. Steve's eyes met Tony's briefly the despair and sadness still present, they nearly lost Tony too. Steve coaxed Tony down to the bed and kissed him again but slowly, taking his time to explore Tony's mouth. It was nothing like he had imagined, it was so much better than in his fantasies.
“Steve...Steve please...please.” Tony begged and the blonde came back to himself. He pulled his fingers and Tony moaned at the loss of the fullness, but he felt the blunt end of Steve's cock pressing insistently against his ass.
Tony leaned over Steve's chest and laved a tongue over Steve's left nipple making the man below him gasp and wriggle. The nub instantly began to harden in the open air as Tony teased it with the warmth of his mouth, he closed his lips over it and sucked gently. Steve's entire body jolted as little fissures of pleasure ran down through him to his cock.
In thinking about the experience it only made him feel more tense, on edge, abandoned by Tony that morning. Steve was sporting a semi-erection as he beat the hell out of the punching bag, willing it to go away. If Tony wanted nothing to do with him he'd have to get himself under control, but the memories assaulted his mind, he could still smell, still taste and feel Tony's body, his skin, his slick the musky male scent of him. Not for the first time Steve cursed his photographic memory.
Tony was silent for a few moments, his eyes darted down to Steve's crotch where he was still sporting an erection. “I may have an idea.” He drew his eyes back up to meet Steve's. “I think the problem is you are getting stuck in your head. Too many ideas of morality and purity, you think it's wrong when you need to accept what you want.”
“Hey...feel me here okay? Feel this...” Steve said pressing his chest closer against him, his arm tightening around him. “This is real, this is our life, we bought a farm on the edge of nowhere. We left our responsibilities behind and came here so we could be together and move on from the horrors we both faced.” Tony closed his eyes tightly and just nodded, hoping, wanting, believing that this could be real.
“Hmm yeah that's a good idea, I'm beat.” Tony reached for the blanket and winced slightly. “Ow!” Steve had Tony lie back and he grabbed the blankets to pull up over the two of them.
Instead Steve felt the wet warm suction of the centipede's gaping maw enclose around the tip. Steve groaned around the appendage in his mouth. God it was sucking him, its mouth was so wet and warm the suction so tight around his cock. Steve began to thrust wildly into the gaping maw all while Tony's own cock slid over his oversensitive prostate. Steve pulled his mouth off of the slender penis to catch his breath.
“W-What?” Steve asked in bewilderment but Tony caught the dilation in those pupils. The heat in Steve's eyes at the mention of using his newly built arm in such lewd ways.
“He's been quarantined as well but we brought him out of it yesterday. Since he wasn't subjected to as much of the substance. It appears your serum amplified the effects. I'm still looking into it, but from what I can tell you should return to normal soon.” Bruce explained.
“I can agree to that.” Steve practically carried Tony into the bathroom, he was concerned that Tony would be sore after their activities. He scrubbed Tony down in the shower, lathering up the soap in his hands and roaming over Tony's body. Tony did the same for Steve. Once they were thoroughly cleaned off they exited together, dried off and Steve changed the sheets to some fresh clean ones. They snuggled into the warmth of blankets together, deciding to forgo the pajamas. Steve liked the intimacy of skin on skin contact. They fell asleep together, both still relishing in the afterglow with each other.
When he arrived home at the tower he took a quick shower to freshen himself up, changed into some more casual clothes and sat down on the couch in the communal to read. Steve was deeply involved in his reading, so much so he hadn't heard the movement or footsteps across the floor. Normally he was much more observant, but here at home Steve had learned to set aside the alertness for relaxation. When a pair of hands eased over his shoulders Steve did flinch slightly in surprise, but he soon sank into it and leaned back against the couch and looked up at Tony.
“I know, I know Tony...I'm not leaving you unsatisfied. “ Steve said affectionately as he wrapped his fist around Tony's cock and gave a few slow strokes. “You asked for me to knot you...I'm giving you exactly what you want. I'll need to come at least two more times before I'm done. I don't want you to feel sore and oversensitive. It will be better if you wait, I promise.”
With a resigned sigh Steve inched his hand down lower and palmed himself through the fabric of his boxers. He felt so guilty whenever he did this, and he had tried to avoid it while thinking of Tony but his libido had only become more of nuisance thanks to the serum. Steve let out a satisfied groan as his hand rubbed over himself. His cock swelling further as he gave into his primal desires of pleasure. He pictured Tony, olive skinned, big brown eyes, shirtless before him on his bed with that knowing smirk of his.
Steve sighed and pinched the bridge of is nose. He had been torn between wanting to cry and beat his fists on the wall in anger ever since he had woken up today. The guilt was weighing heavy and with no other outlet for his emotions it was all bottling up inside. “Talking to anyone else wouldn't do any good. I hardly remember it and the pieces I do recall are fuzzy.” That was a lie. “No sense in trying to dig up a foggy, drug induced memory I am better off forgetting.”
“Tell me to stop, and I will stop.” Tony whispered while he rolled his hips forward, and pressed his groin against Steve's.
For just a little while Steve wanted to feel some sense of normalcy before returning to his life on the run. He didn't know why he chose this particular bar, it looked low-key, and possessed easy escape routes if needed. Steve entered, took a seat near the back, and ordered a beer. Even though he couldn't get drunk he could pretend for a little while he was just a guy among the rest of the patrons.
Tony rubbed his face with his hands. This. He hadn't expected anything like it to occur. He hadn't known that Steve was beating himself up so much over the entire encounter. In hindsight he probably could have been more forthcoming in why he had been distancing himself. “Steve that is not what happened. I wanted your help that day and I greatly, immensely appreciate it. Yes I have been avoiding you, but it is not for the reasons that you think.”
Tony met his eyes in challenge so it was on. "Well...I'm not going to confirm nor deny to trying to win you over as that could potentially put any chances at risk, after all I could just be a guy looking for casual conversation." Tony dipped a finger into his glass and brought it up to his own lower lip, tracing it with a playful look in his eye, the corners of his mouth raising up in a sly seductive smirk. Tony licked at his lower lip slowly, eyeing Steve the whole time and dropped his hand back down to the table. "Besides I wouldn't want to make you uncomfortable if I'm not your type.”
“Certainly no regrets from me.” Tony smirked and moved his hand from Steve's waist down to give his rear a playful squeeze making Steve jump slightly.
“-I guess it was a result of the medication I was on for so many years, or my age, that's a thing. A heat can shorten with age right? Well it's over, I did what was asked so I need you to schedule me a-”
Steve felt no shame. Typically he knew he would be at admitting he liked being called soldier in the bedroom.“Please.” Was all he could utter, because he wanted more, he wanted all that Tony could give him. Tony held Steve's hand loosely and led him down the hall to the bedroom. Once inside he kicked the door closed and pulled Steve in for another heated kiss.
“Yeah...like Clint's, out in the country, there's enough work that would need to be done to keep us busy.”
Tony exited the elevator and walked into the gym, but stopped mid-step as his senses picked up on the signals from the alpha in the room. There was no mistaking the scent in the air, Tony had been around it long enough the previous day to know what Steve smelled like when he was aroused. It was almost like a reflex. Tony felt himself grow excited from the aroma alone. His baser instincts taking control and recognizing what lay ahead for him...pleasure. Tony's cock was getting hard. He stared at Steve's backside as he moved, striking the punching bag with precision and determination. The sweat on his skin, how the muscles in his arms tensed and flexed. Tony raked his eyes down the man's muscled back how he could see defining outlines through Steve's tight t-shirt. The soldier's narrow waist and perfectly round and sculpted buttocks.
"Yeah more of that use me Steve. I can take it..." He closed his mouth over him and sucked him hard, griping tighter, and stroking faster. The sound of Tony moaning was such a turn on. Steve wanted to hear more of it. When Tony started to suck harder his hips jerked in response. "Tony....." he panted. He gripped onto Tony's hair while he started to thrust his cock into the wet heat. Steve moaned again, he was so close, so close.
Steve felt the anxiety he had been experiencing begin to dissipate, but why then had Tony been avoiding him? He was about to ask why, but then as Tony had moved closer to him he picked up on it. He inhaled, and then again more deeply, and he realized that something wasn't right about the way that Tony smelled. During the heat Steve had been so up close and personal he had an intimate knowledge of Tony's true omega scent. It was artificial. It wasn't right at all. “You're back on the suppressants.” It wasn't a question. He knew it was true.
“Tell me, when a colony of parasites invades do you let the parasites decide fate for themselves?” Thanos asked and tightened his grip on Tony's arm. “Or...do you exterminate them before they overrun you?” He twisted Tony's arm back at an unnatural angle, it was quick, the bone snapping rang in Tony's ears as the pain seared up his arm. Tony screamed from the agony, not even the adrenaline pumping though his system was enough to dull the pain. “You are nothing but parasites, consuming everything in your path. I'll save you from yourselves.” He released Tony's arm and Tony dropped fully into the dirt cradling his injury close to his chest. His nerves were shot, he could barely make any movement at all in his fingers, they felt numb compared to the throbbing pain of the splintered bone. “Why fight, why die for those who would never do the same for you? Give up.” Thanos had turned away from him, apparently believing that was enough to finish Iron Man off.
Tony gave Steve a sweet smile. “I'm here for whatever you ask of me Steve. If you want this again, then you shall have it, you want me to use my mouth on you, watch me pleasure myself, use my fingers on you, lick you in places I'm certain you've never felt a tongue before...you can have all of that. Even if you want me to sit innocently in any pose to draw me, you shall have all of that as well.”
Tony exited the barn and made his way over to the coop. The chickens were referred to as “the girls” and produced a plethora of fresh eggs for them. Tony knew nothing about chickens, and neither did Steve, but after some research they determines that it couldn't be that difficult to keep the birds happy and fresh eggs for omelets had been delightful. Tony tossed the seeds out and watched the clucking brown feathered birds as they strutted about and pecked at the ground.
“Yes-Yes-Yes!” Steve panted. Tony realizing that he now had his hands free reached down and gripped onto Steve's narrow waist and drove himself hard and fast into the captain's clenching ass. Tony couldn't resist now that the centipede had released him he drew his right hand back and delivered a hard and heavy slap to Steve's perfect cheek.
Tony blinked a few times. “So that time during my heat that wasn't all just reaction to the hormones. You were capable of going multiple times already?” Steve's face tinged a bit pink in embarrassment and he nodded slowly. It hadn't been something he felt the need to brag about, and he had worried it would scare potential partners away. Alphas were already known to be a bit intense when it came to sex, and one that needed extra care could only come across as intimidating. “How are you even real?” Tony whispered and clenched up around Steve's cock.
“I-I know...” Tony replied breathlessly. He had never been kissed like that, he thought he had known passion, but that was beyond any kiss he had ever experienced before.
Steve had hardly any experience with this, he really had no clue what he was doing or why he wanted to do it. Something about Tony ignited a fiery passion inside of him and made him want to do and try things. Things Steve had only heard from fellow soldiers during the quiet lonely nights on the front lines. Of course those talks had been about women, but a lot of the same principles still applied and from Tony's reactions had the same effect.
Tony managed to look over his shoulder at Steve behind him. “...I was still a little tight so I may have taken matters into my own hands so to speak.” Tony's skin was flushed, and he felt slick from sweat. Steve couldn't wait any longer. He needed to take care of his omega in need. Without any more hesitation Steve gripped tightly onto Tony's hips as he positioned the tip of his cock against Tony's waiting, leaking hole. Steve snapped his hips forward and with a smooth fluid motion his large cock penetrated into Tony's hot tight channel.
Steve couldn't resist the full body shiver that ran through him. Tony had raised an amused eyebrow as he moved off the stool and tugged Steve along to follow.
Steve had to take a moment to chuckle at himself. “I apologize this is...” He trailed off unsure of what to say next. He cleared his throat and shut the door to the chamber and turned to face his guest again. He was perched on the edge of the chaise, his alluring eyes still on Steve. “I've never asked one of you here before. I didn't know what to expect.”
Tony pulled back panting heavily, a satisfied smile on his face. "You like that? Want more?" Tony asked him, while reaching up and tugging off Steve's jeans.They were way too clothed for this. "Ask me for it Steve." Steve assisted in kicking off his pants the rest of the way, and slipping off his boxers with them. He met Tony's eyes with his own lust filled gaze.
“I can't...” Tony pressed a soft feather light kiss to Steve's lips. “Just believe me when I say you are better off. Take your gold get out of this place. There is a darkness here, and you will be so much happier if you get yourself away from it.” Tony retied the veil around his face and his beautiful dark eyes met with Steve's as he said “Goodnight my lord Rogers...” and then slipped out of Steve's chamber.
“I'm right here.” Steve replied and settled his hand over Tony's left. Entwining his fingers with that of the metallic red of the prosthetic. A dangerous gesture, an all too affectionate one, but Tony did nothing, instead he surged up to seal his lips over Steve's. Tongues slipping over one another, exploring and claiming one another. Suddenly Steve's hips snapped forwards rapidly losing the steady rhythm as he came, moaning against Tony's mouth.
“Sam!” Steve had scolded and his cheeks turning a light shade of pink in a blush. The thought of asking for a model was frightening, but asking for one to removed their clothes and reveal themselves was altogether nerve wracking. Steve had been at war, too busy for fraternizing with women, although he had a bit of a sweetheart, Peggy Carter, but he had missed his chance long ago. “I told you it would be too expensive and I don't know how comfortable I am with that. I just want someone who can sit still for a few hours without complaining.”
Reluctantly Tony dragged his eyes up to the reflection. There he saw himself on the edge of the bed, naked, his arc reactor shining brightly and casting a blue glow against his skin. His legs were splayed out, spread wide with his hands resting on his knees and holding himself open, his feet planted at the edge. He was leaning with his back flush against Steve's chest to support him. Steve was behind him, both arms coming around Tony's waist with his hands down between Tony's legs. Steve's left hand was cupping Tony's balls, lifting them up and out of the way so Tony could get a better view. Steve's right hand was rubbing slow circles around Tony's hole.
Here they were now. Talking tactics, mission. Moving to the next step and working as a team again. Steve knew it was Tony's best method to cope and maybe he could take a page from Tony's book here. Focus on fixing the problem and maybe the rest of the awkwardness would go away. Still, Steve was having a hard time not focusing too closely on Tony's mouth and thinking of how the centipede's sucker like mouth had felt over his cock. He really hoped these inappropriate thoughts would lessen soon.
There was a loud crash of breaking glass. “Quarantine breached!” Jarvis announced as a Mjlonir crashed through the window followed by the god of thunder himself. Thor caught his hammer in his hand and held it up menacingly.
“Still cool?” Steve asked in bewilderment. He got off the bed, erection finally subsided and approached the reinforced window. “Still cool? Tony how can you even ask something like that? I don't understand how you can even bear to look at me right now! Is this some personal test of yours? To find out what you can handle or something? I can't do this right now, please!”
Tony was seldom speechless, but everything coming out of Steve, spilling his innermost thoughts and feelings had Tony at a complete loss for words. Maybe he didn't have to say anything and just let actions speak for themselves. Tony pulled Steve in and crushed his mouth against Steve's again, kissing with renewed enthusiasm and need. He was rewarded with a moan from Steve, and the sound ignited a fire in Tony. They crowded up against the window, Tony's back pressed against the hard glass as the solid body of Steve Rogers pressed into him. Tony clutched onto to Steve's uniform as if he were afraid to let go, and that doing so would result in Steve disappearing into dust like all the others.
“It's kind of hard to date in college when you're underage.” Tony sighed. “Girls don't really like guys younger than them, and the ones that did well.” He shrugged. “They just wanted money.” He mumbled.
Steve pulled his fingers out, and let go of Tony's taught balls. He scooted backwards on the bed and laid down, beckoning for Tony to follow. Tony let go of his knees and dropped his legs down, his muscles were a bit sore from holding the position for so long. He turned over on the bed and crawled up towards Steve and straddled his waist. Steve sat up a bit and Tony leaned down so they could kiss, all tongue and teeth, hot and sloppy. Steve laid back, his hands settling on Tony's waist.
“If I am...why are you standing there asking silly questions instead of giving your omega what he needs?” Steve didn't wait another second, he kicked the door closed with his foot and began to undress. He tore his clothes off quickly, discarding them haphazardly across the floor as he approached the bed. “Alpha...” Tony whined, his eyes closed as he continued to stroke himself. “Been waiting...I need you.” Steve knelt on the bed, his eyes dark with lust. He grabbed Tony's wrist to pull his hand away from his cock, and leaned in for a deep, heated kiss.
They settled into silence with the post orgasm highs wearing off and the reality settling in once again. They were still in Wakanda, their friends were still dead, and half the world had perished from the snap of the mad titan's fingers.
“...and...” Steve's voice wavered and the wetness prickled at his eyes. “And our friends...would still be alive...”
Within minutes they were both naked and touching one another, Steve could really relish in it this time. Tony had an incredible body and admiring his fully hard dick only made Steve's own throb with need. He knew what that cock was capable of he could still recall the feel of Tony stretching him from behind.
"Nice room." Steve commented as he took in the surroundings, it was a lot nicer than what he and the others had been staying in lately. He turned and looked back at Tony with a small smirk. "You seemed surprised Tony. Didn't think I'd show?" He asked while he took his jacket off, and put it on the chair.
Bucky was gone, so was Sam, and there was nothing that Steve could do to bring them back. Half of the world's population had dissipated into dust, and there was no telling the chaos that would ensue now because of it. Who was left? Did it matter? Steve grit his teeth and hit his fist into the hard ground. He should have been there with Tony. For two damn years he waited for the phone call and when it finally had come it hadn't been Tony. Maybe, just maybe it all would have been different or at least Tony wouldn't be knocked out in a teenager's lab with a robotic replacement arm.
There had been a fair number of hand-jobs, cock sucking, and the occasional fingering, but Tony hadn't gone quite over the edge into straight up fucking a man in his ass. Sex ended up being more rewarding with women, and his male partners had decreased steadily until Tony identified as primarily straight. He had chalked it up to a phase of his youth and had never looked back on it. Until Now. Now he was staring at Steve's back while he leaned over a table looking over Tony's computer console. The way Steve was bent pulled the fabric more taught across his bottom, giving the world a full view of his glorious posterior. It had Tony's mouth feeling dry and his pants too tight.
Steve tucked his still sensitive cock back into his boxer briefs and kissed his stomach before standing up and wrapping his arms around Tony, holding him up until he caught his breath.
Steve’s eyes flicked to Tony’s face and then away again. His expression was strange, shuttered. It felt a bit like the sun had gone out.
“Right,” Steve said, and dropped the toolbox at Tony’s feet with a loud clang, effectively cutting him off. “Now what?”
Steve let go of him and stepped back, kicking the toolbox out of the way. Tony couldn’t decipher the look on his face as the mechanism whirred back to life. He sighed in relief as his foot finally touched the ground.
“Well, yes, I maybe have heard that from one or three - really, no more than five! - people. Honestly, it’s such a small sample size you can’t draw any sort of valid conclusion from the data. I can’t -” Tony stopped abruptly, struck dumb by the soft, unmistakably fond look on Steve’s face.
Steve was still looking at him. A tiny wrinkle had appeared between his eyebrows and Tony could see the tips of his ears and his cheeks were flushed pink. “What did you mean?” he asked.
Steve had a strange look on his face, the corner of his mouth twitching. “Tony,” he said, and Tony could hear the strangled laughter in his voice, that bastard, “what happened?”
“I’m sorry, sir,” Jarvis said, not sounding sorry at all. “The diagnostic did not return anything out of the ordinary. I am currently running a deeper test of all functions to determine the source of the malfunction.”
“Tony?” Steve called out. “Where … oh.” He trailed off as he turned the corner and saw Tony’s predicament.
“Was I not clear when I told you I would cry if you didn’t fuck me?” Tony asked after he had gotten his brain back online. “Don’t think I won’t. I might even beg if you ask nicely. Although that would be difficult if you want me to stop talking. I suppose I could. Stop talking. Anything is possible, right? I’m sure I could figure it out. I am a genius after all.”
“Sorry to disturb your post-assemble routine, Cap,” Tony said. “I mean, normally I would call Pepper for these sorts of things, or Rhodey, but Pep’s in Malibu this week and Rhodey, well I don’t know where Rhodey is these days, probably off on some top secret mission with that suit I gave him out of the genuine goodness of my heart and anyway Pepper would probably kill me if she had to rescue me again from something mechanical after the last time, I mean it’s not the same as the arc reactor thing, but I think she has trauma or something she was really mad -”
that made Tony think about really sappy things like sunrises and coming up for air after a long time underwater. It was devastating, is what it was. Steve’s smile was a weapon Tony had no defense against.
“The mechanism seems to have malfunctioned, sir,” Jarvis said, as calm as ever. “I’m running a diagnostic now.”
“Sir,” Jarvis said repressively, just as Steve said, “Well, I should probably go.” He was looking down, fiddling with the hem of his t-shirt.
Steve cleared his throat. “Tony.” His voice was quiet, and Tony knew it was just his imagination, but he could swear he could feel the hot caress of air.
Tony tilted his head, offering up his neck as Steve’s tongue darted out to taste his skin. “I’ll show you hard,” he said, inanely, pushing his hips against Steve’s as much as he could, breath stuttering at the answering roll of Steve’s hips. He groaned outright when Steve bit at the tendon in his neck in response, tongue laving the sting away, sucking a bruise into his skin.
Tony opened his eyes and sighed deeply. He supposed that Steve was really his best option. Natasha would probably laugh and leave him there; Barton would laugh at him too, but would help him out eventually. The only problem was that he’d never live it down. Bruce would have been his first choice, but he often disappeared for days after a mission. “I knew I shouldn’t have been futzing around with this last night,” he muttered to himself, shifting his hips slightly.
Tony looked down and immediately had to shut his eyes against the sight of Steve’s mouth stretching over the head of his cock. It was almost worse, though, not to see, to only be able to feel the slide of Steve’s tongue against the sensitive underside of the head, the barest sharp brush of his canines as he took Tony in further until his mouth met his fingers.
Tony grimaced. “Jarvis is running a diagnostic,” he said. “In the meantime, we thought it was best to get someone up here who had opposable thumbs. Guess you fit that description, huh, Cap?”
“I can’t stop you,” Tony said. His hips jerked as Steve’s fingers slid over the crack of his ass, teasing.
“Pardon me, sir, Captain Rogers,” he said. “But I have completed my diagnostic and I believe I have restored functionality.”
“What would you have done if I hadn’t been here?” Steve asked, sounding genuinely curious, as he walked over to the couch and hefted the toolbox in one hand. He was wearing sweatpants and a white t-shirt, but his hair wasn’t damp, which meant Jarvis had interrupted him before he’d had a chance to get in the shower.
.” His lips were twitching at the corners and he raised an eyebrow, wordlessly inviting Tony in on the joke.
Brushing his lips over Tony’s temple, Steve chuckled, a dark, quiet laugh Tony had never heard before. “You can’t,” he said. His lips drifted to Tony’s neck, sending a shiver down his spine as he said, “Must be hard for you. Can’t imagine the great Tony Stark doesn’t get his way very often.”
Steve stood suddenly, right up in Tony’s space. The inside of his knee pressed into Steve’s thigh, and Tony could feel the heat radiating off Steve’s body, smell the mineral scent of his sweat. “I’m not Captain America right now,” Steve said. His lips twisted sardonically. “I’m just Steve Rogers.” He was still blushing, his eyes an intense blue.
Tony’s attention snapped back to the present. “Steve, wait, no, sorry.” He moved to stand in front of Steve, close enough he could see Steve’s mouth was still red.
“Wait, what?” Tony said. He leaned back a little to look at Steve’s face. “No challenge! I never issued a challenge.”
“Steven Grant Rogers,” Tony said, licking his lips, noting how Steve’s eyes darted down to his mouth and then back up, “I will let you put your mouth anywhere you damn well please, so long as you do it now and stop being such a fucking gentleman.”
Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s hips and his arms around Steve’s neck as Steve started walking, carrying him unerringly toward the bedroom. “Good,” he said. “Because I actually don’t think I could stop talking, even if my life depended on it. In fact, my life
Hello everyone, I'm deeply sorry to inform you that I will no longer post chapters to this story, the main reason is that I have lost interest and no matter how much I tried I couldn't force myself to write the story any longer. Knowing that I'm never going to finish this story does break my heart, but I thought it would only be fair to tell you how I planned for it to go, hopefully, one day I will return and finish this fic.
It took the whole day for Steve to finally lay down in his bed, sighing softly when he felt Goose jump on the bed and nuzzle his cheek before lying down on his chest, that made Steve smile as he pet the cat and gaze at the ceiling in thought, after what happened today with Goose, Steve thought that Tony will throw the cat away while screaming bloody murder, but Tony was actually… happy, energetic, Tony and Peter spent the day playing with Goose, with Peter squealing happily every time the cat licked his cheeks.
"I searched for you, when I was back I searched for you, I never found you, until you send me a letter two month later telling me how poor excuse of an Alpha I was, and that you become tired of me so you are going with Bucky because the Alpha came back to you, you told me you will be back if I became a real Alpha, and I did, I tried, I tried but you never come back…" Tony said wiping his tears before they fell, which caused Steve to sniff and look at his side refusing to see Tony.
Stane saw this and immediately tried to attack Steve once more, but a well-placed punch from the soldier throw Stane toward the wall behind him, making his back hit the wall hard that the agents wince when they heard the sound of something cracking in the silent room. "You don't know how long I want to do that…" Steve said as he took his seat once more, waving for the agents to drag Stane to the chair once more, the other Alpha was gasping for air and letting out a pained gasped every time he moved his right shoulder.
"You should not gaze about the lake in such nights; it is dangerous…" A voice stated, and Steven doesn't have to turn around to see that it was the foolish king behind him, probably coming to punish him for raising his hand; Steven waited for what the king will do, but the man did nothing other than coming to sit beside the Omega, leaving Steven frowning. "It was not in my intent to let Tyber enjoy his victory; but as you can see, my hands are tied, especially when some of my people believe in Tyber's tale." The king explained, and Steven pressed his lips together tightly, he never asked the king to explain his action and he doesn't want the king to do it.
Steve's breath left him as he looked at his fiancé's picture on the card, followed by the name Anthony E. Stark… Steve looked at the older man who was smiling in amusement at the confused. "As you see, my son… he has grown tired of you, so he told me to escort you out of his apartment, but don't worry Mr. Rogers, I will make sure to pay you for your time, that of course if you kept your mouth shut." The Alpha stated as he gets a checkbook out of his pocket.
And wasn't that a killjoy? The thing that Tony loves unconditionally after his son, hate his guts… Tony really should write a book about his life, he was sure that it would have won a prize of some sort, maybe the prize of the most pitiful person in the universe, because really, what's the chance of his lucky star having a curse put on him and ended up a human? What were his chances that the star will fall on top of him and drag him with it into the unknown? It was zero to none… that's why he hates magic, not one day in his life was good when magic was involved.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, a little bit of sadness, feelings, a little bit of violence, a lot of fluff, smut! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"Why don't you come with me, Pete? We can prepare the cakes and tea while Tony puts Harley in your room." Steve smiled, kissing Tony's left cheek before he guided Peter to the kitchen, giving Tony a nod as he dragged a protesting Peter so they would prepare the tea.
"I am sorry Peg… but Shield is Hydra." That made Peggy gasp and look at Steven who was looking at her sadly. "In 2013, Hydra revealed itself to the world, intending to use 'Project Insight'…" Peggy and Tony tensed which made Steven sigh sadly at the thought that this part in this world happened. "It started with Hydra sending their assassin The Winter Soldier…" Natasha tense at the name, anyone who saw her will think that the small frown on her face was one of confusion, but Steven who knew Natasha for a long time, he knew that she was afraid after all Bucky was the only one who was able to best her, but that small fear in her eyes meant that Bucky was alive, out there with Hydra but alive. "To kill the commander of Shield, which in my world was Nick Fury… the assassin was not what we all thought of…" He wanted to tell them that the soldier was Bucky, that Bucky was out there alive, but looking at Steve's face, something in him shut the idea down… it was not the time for anyone but Peggy and possibly Fury to know about what's going to take a place. "He was a POW an American soldier from World War Two, he was tortured, brainwashed, and was forced to kill, we were able to expose Hydra and their sleeping agents, which caused the fall of Shield, which was later on created once again by Fury in 2023… as for the soldier we were able to save him, he became an Avenger in the end." Steven said which made everyone look in at each other.
"Why thank you, Pete! I'm sure that Jarvis is going to be very happy when he hears about that, he will even sneak you a cookie when I'm not looking." Tony winked at the pup, which made the boy puff his cheeks a little but a shy smile took over his face as he snuggled into his father's chest, waiting for the Alpha to open the backdoor.
"Steve, I don't really think I can go in there…" Bucky whispered after Steve dragged him all the way to the barbershop, Bucky's words caused Steve to give the Alpha a look ordering him silently to explain. Now Steve wasn't someone who will shove his beliefs and orders down someone's throat, but Bucky was practically looking like a mountain man with his long shaggy hair and unkempt beard, he was sure that once the barber saw him, he will pray for mercy, Steve can vaguely remember Bucky's face the first time he came to live with them, and he remembered how youthful he looked with his clean face and kept hair. "I don't feel comfortable near sharp things, Steve…" Bucky whispered uncomfortably, like he was feeling ashamed, an action that caused Steve's face to soften.
Seven months pregnant, Tony was feeling down, not only was he expecting a child he doesn't want, but he was forced to stay behind as the Avengers made their move on Hydra. Rhodey and Pepper visit him from time to time, Jarvis and Anna were the ones who stayed behind to take care of him, but even with all of that he was feeling left behind, unwanted. He felt like he made the biggest mistake of his life and that he was the idiot who destroyed everyone's trust in him, even when Steven, tell him otherwise.
If you thought the past weeks were stressful with all the work, work, Addams, work, Addams, Addams, ghost Addams, the Avengers… then you haven't seen anything. That's what Tony would have said with a tired look on his face as he dragged his body like he was a zombie to the kitchen hoping to have a peaceful cup of coffee before he was forced to deal with the Avengers and the crazy Addams that live with him. The weeks followed Tony's confession... were hard... they were draining, they were painful, and Tony wished everything will just end already!
Years ago when Nebula was sent to invade earth, the resistance she met was not only that of the Avengers but also in the form of a stupid witch and her brother with their big bloodthirst and want of revenge; the stupid witch threw all of Nebula's full prove plans away when she cast a spell on the Space Stone, trying to close the portal fast so that the human called Iron Man will be forever lost in space. Unfortunately for the witch the space stone shoot toward space but Iron Man managed to return to earth before the portal close, something that made the witch snarl and scream as she was forced to retreat to lick her wounds in peace.
P.P.S: So a lot of you dear readers asked that I put the translation beside the words in hope of being able to follow the plot closely without interruption… Buuut I got a better idea I hope that you will like. Considering that this story is going to take a place in Iceland and everyone other than the servants working in the Hydra palace knew Icelandic, I made an easy solution.
Tony couldn't help the satisfied smirk on his face as he saw the looks of awe and amazement on everyone's faces as they watched Steve like he was like the God of the sea who decided to grace the mortal world with his presence, if only they knew that his husband was the true impersonate of the God of the underworld and the king of the darkness all in one… poor humans got deceived by a handsome face as his husband.
The previous owners of the property had left the place years ago with a few bags of their most valued possessions, leaving everything else behind, that's what Peggy told them, something about the family not being able to handle their son's death. The pictures Tony had seen on the Real Estate website had shown the inside of the house, stained pinewood walls, and a selection of simple, homely furniture included in the price. But now… here… everything, every dish, and plate, every piece of furniture, has been destroyed. The sofas had been overturned, the coffee table smashed, splinters of pine scattered across the floor. The boxy old TV that had been on an occasional table in the corner has been… crushed. Like something had wrapped around it and squeezed. The dining table that separated the kitchen and dining room was in fragments.
"Steve… I…" The Alpha didn't let the Omega continue as he rushed out of the kitchen, his heart feeling like something had ripped it out and stepped on it before throwing it back to him. The feeling intensified when he saw the small pup flinch away from the Alpha, tears running down his flushed face as he ran to hide behind Tony… and Steve… he really needed to get out of here, he needed to get his breath back… he needed… he needed Bucky…
"I decided to become normal." The smile on Steve's face became bigger, but the discomfort hidden so deep in his eyes increased, and Tony had to give it to Steve, the man was a great actor, Tony was sure he would have fooled anyone if he pulled this one on them, but unfortunately for Rogers (Steve, he deserved to be called Steve after what Tony did last night) Tony was an actor too, and he can detect the signs of pain hiding behind careless smiles and gestures, he practically invented that technic!
"Is it because of the woman who came today?" Harley suddenly asked around a mouthful of mint ice cream, causing Tony to stop for a second and turn his head around to gaze at Harley, the boy was frowning harshly as he glared at his ice cream darkly.
"Peter will be so excited about meeting new friends; also this Riley seems smart, you really should have brought him with you." Tony chuckled as he arrived at the cashier giving Sam a goodbye nod. "Don't be a stranger, Sam, come and visit us soon!" Tony smiled as he waved goodbye to Sam and his kids.
"Please let me explain Steve, please sweetheart, I can explain." Tony said after he prayed the door open which made the Omega growl at the Alpha, and let out a hiss, it broke Tony's heart how his Omega was acting toward him, but he could only blame himself for that.
…" Peter sighed, the next few minutes was so quiet that Steve's hope of them staying with him was over, the two Stark probably left him alone to sleep, unaware that he was still very much awake in mind, but not in body, which hurt a little.
"It is true… and just like Anton, it seems that you cannot keep a secret, probably why they called you crazy in Athens, big futuristic thoughts and dreams but no filter." Steven grumbled, ignoring how wide everyone's eyes became, as for Tony he was skipping toward Steven with the most serious look on his face.
Today was Friday, thankfully his day off, which unfortunately for him meant that Clint will bang on his door and demand from him to babysit his brats so he can have his date night with his mate… Tony wondered if he can charge the other Omega for babysitting his brood of pups, but he shrugged his shoulders at that, it was fun being with the pups and giving them candy in the promise of making Clint and Phil miserable tomorrow. After finishing his morning routine, Tony went out to collect the mail from the mailbox before having breakfast, stopping in his way when he saw Peter pouting in Sarah's front yard with his father arguing on the phone with someone.
The day his beloved had taken her life, she was eighteen, after three miscarriages, and enough abuse, his beloved couldn't handle it, he remembers her standing on the windowsill wearing her nightgown as she looked at the sky calling his name over and over again, she was smiling as she took another step and another, and Steven as much as he didn't want to watch, he couldn't take his eyes away, he couldn't let his beloved do this alone… Anton, Tonton, and Antonette, how much can Steven handle before his light is forever dimmed?
Tony cried in fear and denial, his eyes refuse to believe the sight in front of him. Steve… someone was holding Steve from his neck; someone huge was holding Steve, grinning at Steve's face that scrunched in pain. Someone was bleeding the life out of Steve, as he stood on the corpses of the Avengers with Steve dangling from his hand… "Now you will be my queen… my Golden Bride…" The monster whispered, his free hand coming to caress Steve's face, wiping the blood and dirt away.
Two hours later, Steve was finally sitting beside his baby's side, wondering how his life could be one big joke. A cold has gone wrong and ended up causing his son pneumonia; how did Steve overlook this? How did the man whose first priority is his son overlooking his baby's health? Was he so much out of his mind after the home invasion he and his baby suffered, that he didn't acknowledge his baby's health? Steve should have been the first one to notice, how did he not notice that his baby was sick?
He asked in his mother tongue, looking at the child who shook while looking at him, the king frown when the child didn't answer him, it seems like the child didn't know his tongue.
The pup blinked his big eyes, turning to Steve while opening and closing his mouth like he wanted to say something but the words refused to leave him. Steve waited for the pup to say what was on his mind, and it worked when not five minutes later, the small pup gathered himself to speak. "C-can I have the Shield?" The small boy asked, which made Steve smile. He kissed his forehead, nodding his approval to the boy, knowing that his Shield was another security blanket the small boy only request when he felt as helpless as he felt being locked in that basement.
Reaching what looked like a normal door, Serpentine tried to not scrunch her nose at the smell, she could only thank her stars that she was dead; she doesn't want to know what the smell is like to a living person. From the coughing and hacking coming from Bucky-doll and the spider, she has an idea how bad it was, and that was… Awesome! She was so going to cook her rat poison stew for Stevie as a well-done present!
Kisses turned into touches, turned into exploring each other, which turned into gasps and moans as they found each other's pleasurable spots. Reaching the penthouse, Steve and Tony made sure to stay as quiet as they can when walking to Tony's room. Even when Peter was sleeping on Bruce's floor tonight (The man was never a fan of any gala so he didn't come with them) it didn't mean that Peter didn't sneak here later.
The thought of that foolish defenseless pregnant Omega with a too big mouth in the middle of the brawl and his overprotective babe who was probably trying to protect him, made Starkad's Alpha let out a deafening roar inside of his head that nearly made Starkad stumble, but the Alpha righted himself and rushed toward where he was hearing the snarling and growling, informing him that he was close.
Edith's voice made Steve hum a little and close his eyes for a little while sitting up. "Permission granted…" Steve said as he looked around the room, to see everyone looking at the ceiling with wonders and a little bit of fear? Awe? Surprise? Steve didn't know, but he couldn't look at his young self's face as he was looking at the ceiling.
Tony could say that he was over the moon happy; it has been such a long time since Tony enjoyed himself to the fullest and with his friends too! Pepper and Rhodey planned to stay for two weeks until Tony convinced them to stay one more week with him. The three of them spent two weeks laughing, bickering and annoying each other while doing their chores but nonetheless they enjoyed themselves. In the two weeks Pepper and Rhodey stayed with him, Tony noticed that nothing of the usual strange incidents accrued around his house anymore; he noticed that there was no sound of a body being dragged under his floors after the second night, there was no longer someone messing with his gardens and destroying his veggies, and the lake seemed more calm and quiet than it was when Tony arrived months ago, which all lead to Tony realizing maybe that it was true and this was nothing but his imagination in play, and that the reason he was scared all the time was his mind playing tricks on him.
Steve saw how Bucky shifted from foot to foot, and he let out a sigh when he saw his best friend get uncomfortable, as much as Steve wanted to snap at the first person he saw, snapping at Bucky won’t solve anything, and he does need someone to take him to the hospital. “Peter is sick.” Finally admit, causing Bucky to stiff and tense, probably ready to whisk Peter to the hospital. “Can you take us to the hospital, I called his doctor and she said it’s best to be safe than sorry.” Bucky gave Steve a soft encouraging smile, trying to calm him down before he starts fritting.
"I told you it's because of you…" Tony saw how Steve's eyes sparkled as he started, only for it to be deemed a little as he seemed lost for a second before giving a big smile. "It's because you are amazing, smart, kind, and I really like you." Steve finally said, and Tony raised his brow because that was the short vanilla speech of the day Steve confessed to him.
It was Tony, it was his beautiful Tony, as young and beautiful as the day he first saw him when Shield asked him to fight Loki. A smile took over his face and he closed his eyes, feeling so happy that he was finally able to see Tony for one last time, he felt happy, and for the first time in a very long time he felt…
"Two months from now, what do you think Steve?" Tony asked after turning to his Alpha, getting a soft smile from the man who was looking at him with soft eyes full of pride which made Tony flush, for he loves how his Alpha smile softly every time he looks at him like he was something precious, if Tony wasn't already in love with the Alpha, he would have fallen in love once more.
"Enough, Stark!" Bucky's snarled snapped Steve from the near panic attack he was about to have, and the weight of his husband was pulled away from him, which made the blond man take a few deep breaths as he backed away, gazing at his husband who was looking at his brother like he was going to kill him any minute now. "Steve, please go to your room, I will lead Tony to a guest room." Bucky said gently which made the blond relax a little and give Bucky a grateful nod at that as he took a step away only to hear a low growl that made the hair on Steve's body stand on its ends.
"Maybe another time, sweetheart; I promised Margaret to help her today, do you not remember?" Steven tried to persuade his son, which gained him a giant pout as the boy gazed at the crowd surrounding the bear before he let out a sigh and nod his head reluctantly, probably sensing that Steven doesn't want to stay here any longer. "Thank you, sweetheart…" Steven whispered before he leaned down to kiss his babe's forehead; standing Steven turned to Nicolaus who was talking in a hushed voice with Nattalegg. "Nicolaus, I apologies for my hast, but I need to leave to check on my people," Steven said, trying not to roll his eyes at the way Nattalegg's eyes widen in shock when Steven used the man's given name. "Oh, and before I forget, my name now is Steven, so please use it," Steven whispered to Nicolaus, causing the man to frown as he opened his mouth to protest, but in the end, the man just closed his mouth and nod in acceptance, he would probably question Steven about that later but until then the Omega has time.
"Sorry, I mean lifts, where are they?" Steven asked just to be a little shit, which gained him a growl and a pout from the Omega, before mumbling something under his breath that even Stevens super hearing didn't catch. Whatever embarrassing information Steven was going to share, it was forgotten due to the explosion that shook the place. Steven pushed Tony away, ordering him to follow the people out and run to get his suit from the car. When Tony was out of his sight, Steven let out a choked growl of pain when he felt a needle being thrust in his neck. It was only a few seconds before everything turned dark.
"Oh sweetheart, I'm sure running away to Italy will mean death for me; your father made sure to give me the shovel talk last week, and I have to say he is a little intimidating, but not as intimidating as Ma when she gave me the hairy eyeball." That gained a giggle from Tony who nodded his head in acceptance.
It was only a few seconds before the shock went away, leaving Tony blinking at the older Alpha's words, but a small hopeful smile taking over his lips; he could only take the rest of the plates and head to the backyard, where everyone was sitting comfortably in their chairs.
"No, not a toy, but a star." Tony said and Steven can identify the soreness at the mention of it being a star, maybe being displeasing to be reminded by Steven even when the person who did it was his son; truthfully it wasn't even Steven this time or Thor who did the reminder, it was Peter, so Steven knows that Tony won't do a thing.
"My, my Mr. Rogers, and they say civility has died." Tony swoon which made the Alpha give a chuckle and shake his head, waiting until Tony seat himself and buckled his seat before closing the door behind him and went to take his place behind the wheel, unaware of how red Tony's face turned and how his heart was pounding in his chest like it was going to leave him any minute now. It was so easy, the flirting and banter the two of them shared, it made Tony happy that the Alpha indulges him and even think that he is funny.
The woman's breathe hitches as she finally reached her destination; her eyes were wide as she took in the changes that happened to the house in her absence. She raised a shaky hand to swipe some of her grey hair behind her ear, her head turning around as she took in the changes that weren't there when she used to live in the place that she once upon a time called her home.
"I don't really care, as long as they are healthy and happy, that's all I care about," Steve answered, causing Tony to flush in happiness before he turned to the side, ignoring the knowing look that Steve was sending his way. As always, his husband was so sweet and understanding that Tony wondered how he landed the jackpot without even trying.
Tony put a sunglasses and start walking around his neighbor until he shrugged and took the bus to Manhattan, he didn't know why he wanted to go to Central Park exactly, but he just sighed and got out of the bus and start walking to reach the park, he was probably bored out of his mind, that's why he wanted to go to the park to get more bored, or maybe he was a masochist because going to the park meant seeing children and their parents, and Tony was a parent with a dead pup… it was probably the last choice, him going to the park to torture himself with something he wishes to have but won't get no matter how much his heart was pounding in his chest.
Tony would have asked Peggy and Bucky to tell him the truth; if only they would have told him the truth. Hell, Tony probably would have even helped them hide the monster in the lake and keep it a secret if their goal from the start was to protect the monster from outsiders and nothing else. Tony wouldn't have minded having a strange neighbor who lives deep in the lake if it meant that Tony or his daughter will never get hurt. Tony wouldn't have minded keeping the secrets that this town kept if it meant his daughter would have a happy life; Tony wouldn't mind the ghost in his house living with his family if he didn't hurt Morgan. Unfortunately, though, no one in the town seemed to trust him enough to tell him the truth, and that was their mistake because when it comes to the safety of his daughter, no one is to stand in front of Tony Stark or they will pay dearly.
Steve looked through the peephole and blink in confusion as he saw an old man in his fifties; he didn't remember seeing him when he passed down the hallways of the apartment complex. Maybe he was a floor above? It ends up with Steve opening the door as the old man continued to knock on the door like a manic. "Can I help you, sir?" Steve asked as he opened the door narrowing his eyes at the man cautiously.
Puffs of breaths left Anton as he walked through the forest; his breaths were frozen in front of him in the form of white clouds, informing Anton of how cold and freezing the forest was becoming. Winter was coming. A fact that Anton doesn't know if it was bliss or a curse, especially after the events that continued to happen, leaving Anton stunned. It was a week since everything went as bad as it can go by the arrival of Tyber and his sister, so bad, that Anton wondered how the village was still standing without burning to ashes.
"Steve…?" Peggy asked a shocked Steve, who was still trying to make ahead or tail of what he heard right now.
He spent that day crying because as much as Anton's death hurts him, his beloved at least lived a full life, he lived, grow old, and died from old age… but Tonton, his Tonton died young, he died so young, not even growing past fifteen summers in humans years, he was still a child who didn't know what the world was going to offer him.
Margaret said in a shaky voice as she leans away a little to show Steven Angela and young Philips as they were huddling next to their family members tightly.
Steve never questioned that, for it was bliss. Ever since the first day Steve put his foot in here, he was always back here every night, again, and again, and again… he cleaned the room from top to bottom, usually stop to see the pictures of Tony… Tony standing with his friends grinning… Tony with his robots… Tony with Peggy, her mate, and Jarvis… Tony with recent pictures with his father and mother, smiling shyly to the camera… Tony the teen who had his whole life in front of him, who was supposed to go and see the world, who was supposed to fall in love one day and find his mate, who was supposed to have his kids with his mate and live his happy ever after… Tony… the teen that Steve failed because he was a coward…
"And you trust me with Tony's heart because I was married to him for decades, did you forget that I'm not from this world in the first place?" Steven said as he looked at the woman with a hard look. "Tony is not a rebound, Peggy, and you should know that." Steven whispered harshly in Peggy's ear which made the woman smile at that.
Bucky's frantic voice caused Steve to sniffle and nod his head, trying to stop another full-bodied flinch when he heard the crash coming from the kitchen, informing Steve that his stalker found the boiling kettle. Steve didn't know how long he waited inside the locked bathroom hearing the cursing and furniture crashing outside, wondering when would Bucky arrive and save him, but the knock on the bathroom door, nearly made Steve jump off his skin, his heart dropping in his stomach at the realization that he was found.
"I don't care! I don't even need your stupid blessing! I am not a pup anymore! I am going out with Steve and that is final, even if I had to leave the pack!" Tony snarled as he pushed Peggy away and rushed out of the room ignoring Peggy's calls for Tony to get back; all the while Steven could do nothing but stand still in his place looking at the scene with pursed lips…
Two months later, Tony gave birth to a little boy, and just like he stated he was giving him to adoption, he refused to look at the baby even when the nurse brought the baby for Tony to hold; Steven knowing that Tony will regret it if he went through this, smiled at Tony and stated softly that he should at least hold the baby before giving him up. Holding the baby, Tony couldn't let go of the small boy; crying the whole time as he glared at everyone daring them to take the baby away from him.
"You look nervous," Howard stated beside Tony, helping him cut the potatoes for tonight's dinner; his father's words made Tony pause in his place before fidgeting and continuing to steer the stew. "Steve told me that everything was going alright, so you don't need to worry, you know that, right?" Howard stated, his words causing Tony to sigh and nod his head.
Tony choked on his breath, taking in the scent of his mate, shivering and shaking as he let his tears go and hide his face in the Omega's neck breathing his scent and shuddering as the scent, of honey, roses, and charcoal, and a faint scent that made Tony's breath hitch and hide his face in Steve's neck, holding him tightly.
The Omega tilted his head at that and gave Tony a long look, and then a sad smile took over his face. "I never wanted you to be anyone but yourself, Anthony… please come back…" Steve said as he leans down to kiss the mask where the place of the mouth should be.
"Steve? You are still here?" Bucky's voice made Steve jump and turn around, wondering how he hasn't felt Bucky with him in the same room; maybe Steve was really out of it more than he thought. "I thought you and Tony left an hour ago, did you finish your appointment already?" Bucky tilted his head, taking Steve in with a searching look on his face.
When it seemed like the fight between Bucky-doll and the spider won't end, Serpentine sighed and roll her eyes, going to the door and knocking it down, which got her a moan from inside the bathroom, and more choking and hacking coming from Bucky and the spider when the aroma of disgust, swamp, and misery was released… Ah, it reminds her of her youth!
Tony let out a sigh burrowing deep into his scarf as he walked toward his destination, mind racing with all the possible directions his day could head into. A year pass since his father dropped the breaking news to him, a year pass since he got his heart broken by his father, a year pass since hope start blossoming in his chest at the possibility of his son being alive out there waiting for him somewhere, a year pass since he told his friends who decided to help him in any way they can, a year pass since he started his search… a year pass… and nothing had changed…
Me? I think I botched this chapter as I did to every chapter I update recently, I think it was on the rushed side and that the events don't line probably? T^T
A small amused smile made itself known on Steve's tired face, and he straightens himself, planning to go inside and give Tony a piece of his mind. From the corner of his eyes, he saw Bucky waving to Steve, bags of takeout in his metal hand, probably showing it off, from the look of the nurses around them. With an amused smile, Steve waved to Bucky, causing the big Alpha to grin; his childhood friend will probably rub it in Tony's face, it was his version of a pep talk, which was shit in Steve's opinion.
Steve was able to catch the frightening scent of Howard, mixed with different people who start backing away, probably thinking that some villain was able to steal an Iron Man armor to attack innocent people, which may not be that far from the truth, but something inside Steve was telling him that’s his idiot mate in there, and he needed to stop the Alpha before he does something he will regret. “Tony!” Steve called out as he rushed toward the Alpha, ignoring how Howard hissed at him, probably afraid that if Steve attracted the attention to them it meant their doom.
"Natasha! How could you? I thought you loved me? Why would you hide something important like that?" Angie start firing questions left and right walking toward the Alpha that was backing away from the Beta who was hissing like a dragon, the sight was too much that it made Tony laugh at that and shook his head as the redheaded Alpha squeaked and hide behind Peggy shivering in fear when she was Angie walking toward her. The sound of Tony's laughter stopped the women and made them turn to the Omega who was hiding his face in his pup's head; the pup was purring watching the woman in confusion while hugging his toy…
"Tony!" Clint's shout made Tony roll his eyes, as he left his room and head toward the stairs, he descended the stairs looking at Clint with mock annoyance, only to see the fellow Omega grin at. "So what did I hear about you babysitting the hot Steve's pup?" Clint leered at Tony when the Omega stood near him, his words causing Tony to flush wondering how in the bloody hell the other Omega knew about that. "What are you waiting for Tones! Spill the beans, the whole neighborhood had been talking!" Hearing that only made Tony groan in annoyance and grumble something nasty under his breath which caused Clint to laugh. "Oh, hello Peter!" Clint said happily when he saw the pup getting out of the kitchen. As soon as the pup saw Clint he froze in his place, and Tony's heart nearly stopped when he smelled the scent of fear rolling out of the pup in waves which caused Tony to look at Clint only to see the confusion on the Omega's face then the realization crossing Clint's face. "Shit, I forgot he fears Omegas…" Clint cursed under his breath and looked at the child that was whining and backing away slowly from Clint.
It all started with a sound that made Steve wake up in a rush of adrenalin and fear, looking around the room with sleepy eyes in hope of spotting the reason of him being awake… a look at the clock on his bedside told him that it was 3:33 AM in the morning… looking beside him, Steve could see a form under the cover, which made the man shake his head a little before getting out of the bed, leaving his lover asleep as he went toward the kitchen, not even concern about a robbery considering that Steve and his husband lived in the most secure house in all of New York, thanks to Tony's paranoia streak.
Tony's eyes light at that and he nearly sob in relief, with shaky hand he took the phone and turn it around, it was strange kind of phone, it was small, not like the one his father owed, it made Tony wonder how much time passed since he was taken, but he shook the idea away for it doesn't matter, saving his baby was.
"Think? Tony, we know it is haunted!" Rhodey hissed, keeping his voice down, last he startled Morgan who was cooing and drinking her milk. "Do you know what I found when I went to search in the town's hall? The owners of the house, the Rogers, their son didn't die of sickness like everyone says he did! He was killed here, drown in the same lake we went fishing in a few days ago; tell me, did Mr. Carter tell you about this when she sold you the house?" Rhodey asked and Tony can see the desperation in his eyes, the way Rhodey pleads with Tony to think this through and just come with them, that they will protect Tony.
" He took a step toward the Omega and his pup which made Steven hiss at the man to back away, only making the Alpha scowl.
"Oh…" Tony ended up saying shakily as he turned around and returned to his task of washing the dished, lips trembling and his eyes becoming glassy because it can't be… how is that even…? Does that mean…? Million other questions swam into Tony's mind as he tried to stop his hands from shaking…
Steve didn't know if his baby was a girl or a boy, but it didn't matter, not one a bit. Steve will love them to bits and pieces, he will cherish them and spoil them and accept them, boy or a girl, Omega or an Alpha, as long as his baby was healthy and happy than Steve was happy, it was as simple as that.
Living with Harley was fun in a way, but so stressful at times; mainly because Harley looked like he was going to bolt if given a chance. Most if not all of the times Harley was full of nervous energy as he gazed around the place, like he was going to be eaten alive any second or that he was going to be punished. Steve and Tony both knew how hard it was on Harley, so the two of them tried to be as understanding as they can be when it comes to the little boy, they both put Harley's nervousness and jitteriness to the boy not having a good family and foster home before, so they tried to become as open-minded as they can.
It took a long time in Steve’s opinion, a long time until he was able to convince the police to let his baby go and rest from the shock, promising that he will answer all of their questions; May, God bless her, took Peter inside her house, letting the small boy sleep in her bed, the poor boy had passed out after he cried himself in May and Steve’s arms. Even with all the chaos and the being stuck in an ambulance car until his wounds were treated, or when the police start asking him about how he knew Brock Rumlow, who turned out to be an FBI agent, or when the news stations and reporters arrived to question Howard Stark on why he was here, even when he wanted to punch a few reporters for even daring to accuse and question him about being Howard’s mistress; Steve didn’t take his eyes away from Howard, he was already shaky, tired, and on his last nerve, he didn’t take his eyes off his lover’s father, he still remembers how the two of them parted a month or so ago, with him breaking the man’s nose.
Their wedding night was the same day Tony told Steve about the truth, about his plan of them eloping away twelve years ago, about the lake house in Ireland, about him and Steve leaving to live in Ireland as soon as their baby got better, something that caused Steve to cry, both in happiness, and in hurt, at the years the two of them wasted because of Howard's jealousy.
"Yeah… I was… I was married for more than twenty years…" Steve whispered absent-minded as he gazed at the rings, remembering his husband's smiles, the smiles that made Steve fall in love more and more each day.
The second is Addams Family AU! "He Is An Addams" With Steve Rogers being an Addams who is madly in love with Tony and trying to desperately court the man who seemed to reject him every time he tried, it's a funny story with a twisted sense of humor that you needed to read after this dark chapter…
"You idiot!" Screamed Tony slapping his son making his little body fall on the floor, after realizing what he did. Tony let out a gasp of horror and start dragging his body to his crying son holding him tightly. "Oh, God, I'm so sorry baby, so, so sorry Peter. Oh, God, so sorry." Sobbed Tony holding his baby tightly making his baby let out a whine.
"He will be heartbroken when he learns about Bucky." Peggy breathed out which made Steven close his eyes, opening them later and look away from the woman.
"More of tried to force yourself on a sleeping person you brut!" The Omega hissed which made the Alpha snarl at that, the thought of the Omega accusing him of such a thing made the blood boil inside him, because how dare he! How dare that Omega implies that Starkad will force himself on an unwilling partner! Something he killed some of his men for doing!
"Oh? I never thought I will see the day that Steven will finally admit defeat. Oh well, there is no shame in admitting your weakness without even trying to overcome it." Peggy stated as she gazed at her nails with a thoughtful hum. Steve knew he should walk away, he knows that Peggy was trying to edge him, that she was trying to raise his competitive streak… unfortunately if a challenge presents itself Steve didn't back down without a fight. Steve stopped in his way, cursing himself for how stupid he was for rising to the challenge, before turning around and march toward Bucky, ignoring the man's squeak as he tried to back away from Steve, who had the look of someone who was planning to march to war.
They took the coffee to the rest of the group, everyone was too drained to do anything but hold their cups, trying to feel the warms of the brew, Maria had stopped screaming and now she was leaning on Howard's other side, crying on his shoulder, Peggy and Angie, for the first time in years, were holding each other trying to get comfort, Jarvis sit on the chair that Steve forced him on, and he stood up in the corner, looking at every doctor that passed in the halls hoping that one of them is carrying the news about the Omega and his pup…
Steven's eyes never left the library's door that Tony went through, the only time his eyes turned away from them was so that he could gaze at Peggy who was cursing and screaming, trying to let out her frustration, and Steven can say that he was feeling the same thing, after all, he knows Tony, and he knows that if Tony got something in his mind he will go through with it no matter what the consequences were, which was as much as it made Steven want to rip his hair out he admired Tony for standing in what he believes in, though in this case, Steven can't say the same thing, especially when he was told that Tony was nothing but twenty, still a child by even Steven's standard.
The second is a Bucky/Steve horror story, psychological horror, with poor Steve being the prey of the winter soldier, no Bucky Barnes here guys! Just a mentally unstable demon that is bent on killing… poor Steve…
Asked Peggy in a serious voice making Tony raise his head a little when he heard footsteps running outside of the office, he hid under his father's disk. "Some people broke into the house, I don't know how many but from their footsteps they are a lot of them, and they shot Jarvis!" Tony's breathing speed up as he heard footsteps getting closer and closer.
Steven shuffled on his feet for a few minutes before sighing and turning his gaze to Tony, who was still gazing at Steven with wonder, thinking that he was going crazy for imagining Steven apologizing to him. "Peter told me about you… and I admit I must have misjudged you." Steven started, and Tony wonders how much the star was suffering to push these words out of his mouth.
The Avengers looked at one another before turning their sight on Steve, as much as they hated waking the star up. But as it may, the Avengers needed Steve to tell them what happened; until Tony hacks the mansion's security, they were going into this blind. "Steven, can you please tell me what happened when we were away? How are you…?"
"No… Steve, please, don't you remember what you said; together." Tony whispered, his unoccupied hand going to Steve's cheek caressing it softly, his eyes pleading with Steve, begging him not to go. "We said we would do this together, Steve, we can do it, please don't go." Tony tightened his hand on Steve's, his eyes pleading and pleading and Steve, Steve wanted to cry, he wanted to curse and weep and hide with Tony, Peter, and their family, but no, Steve was not going to risk their lives, not against Thanos.
Steve stood in place, panting heavily, his uniform disheveled and his cock hanging heavy between his legs. The centipede contorted its body its many legs pointed up and gently enclosed themselves around Steve's cock. He gasped in surprise at the intensity of the feeling, how soft and warm the legs felt as they flexed and rubbed his flesh. It encased his length in a rippling warmth, nestled so perfectly against the creature's cozy underbelly.
“Yeah, yeah just...too much to drink. Almost there...” Tony closed his eyes and let his mind drift, drift to picturing Steve beneath him, hot and tight begging for Tony to fuck him harder. What Steve's naked ass would look like, those perfect round globes tensing, would he mind if Tony gave them a slap? Turn the cheeks pink, make it sting, as he thrust his cock into that clenching hole? Tony gripped the woman's hips tightly as he thrust himself harder into her tight heat with an all new renewed vigor. She gasped beneath him, breathy panting as she rocked her hips back. Quiet. She was too quiet. Tony wondered if Steve would be loud, when his pleasure was just so overwhelming that super solider body so over sensitive it would be too much and he'd lose himself. He'd moan deep, low rumbles, growling roughly with need.
Tony turned his head and looked at Steve, at his concerned and honest face. Tony had been steadfast in his decision but these last few weeks had been beyond frustrating. Tony had always prided his sexual prowess, even as an omega he knew how to work with people and show them a good time. He enjoyed sex and all aspects of it, giving and receiving. Now he felt that he was maybe letting Steve down. Maybe...he could just try it for a week. Or until he could try a different type of suppressants and get on something that still allowed him to perform in the bedroom.
“I wanted to talk to you.” Steve began. “About that day about a week ago.” Tony visibly tensed at the mention of it, but other than that he showed nothing else. “You haven't been the same since.” Steve continued. “You've been avoiding me and-”
“What are you doing here Tony? You never come to the gym at this hour.” Steve had wanted to sound authoritative, but what came out was only weariness.
Steve instantly felt lighter than he had in weeks. The tension and frustration he had been feeling for days was long gone. Tony had helped him come, his plan had worked and Steve felt an immense gratitude to the handsome engineer.
Tony visibly swallowed and slowly he lifted his metallic prosthetic. He clapped it down into Steve's palm and entwined the shining red fingers between Steve's. They stood there a moment holding hands silently, Steve with a look of utter relief flashed a smile at Tony and they gave one another a brief nod.
There was an amused chuckle from Tony and he perched onto the edge of the chaise. “Wow you are easy to rile up. I knew what you meant, but I just couldn't resist. Wanted to see how you'd react.”
“Yes...you are. You refuse to talk to me, you won't look at me, you won't even stay in the same room as me. Tony...” Steve took a breath before he continued. It was now or never. If they were ever going to piece together their working relationship he had to get everything out on the table. “I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you feel I took advantage of you.” Steve said in a broken and wavering voice. It was so much harder to say it, the words coming out of his mouth only made it all real. “That I did anything to hurt you, or to make you feel like...I used you.”
“Then you'll get what you wish for.” Thanos stated simply The razor edge sliced him open with the smallest pressure. Tony coughed, blood dribbled down from his mouth as he stumbled backward and against some debris. Thanos in a near gesture of comfort settled a hand over his head, like the way an owner strokes a pet that is in distress. It made Tony cringe inwardly. So this was it, this was how he was going to die. In the seconds he had to still live Tony reflected on everything that had led up to this moment, and how he wished he could go back and do it differently.
“Oooh warm ups? You wanna focus...on my...parts?” Tony adjusted his position, lifting a knee up, foot on the chaise and gave a little tilt of his hips Good lord what was happening right now? Steve felt his face heat in another blush.
“I'll see what my options are. This isn't a yes to stopping them completely, but we'll just see how things work out.” Steve smiled, and he leaned over to kiss Tony lovingly.
The first time Tony realized he had a problem was when he nearly called out the wrong name while making love to a woman. There had been a big veteran charity event and Tony along with the Avengers had been asked to attend to help draw in donations. Tony played his usual part smiling for the cameras and people, putting on the face that they wanted to see. The evening was going smoothly until Steve Rogers showed up, and in his dress uniform from the army. Right veterans charity, of course he'd be wearing it to support the cause. Tony had to retreat into the bathroom and splash cold water on his face to will his erection away.
Tony walked in and surveyed his surroundings briefly, the place seemed low key enough he could potentially get away with getting a light buzz without being bothered. Perhaps even get mind numbing-drunk, and have someone take him home for a romp of rough self punishing sex, he really needed to get over losing Pepper already. He loosened his tie some as he sat down at the bar and ordered himself a scotch. Tony sipped at it, letting the alcohol burn down his throat. He hated feeling like a lap dog, being the one Ross expected to fix every solitary problem that involved the Avengers...or..not the Avengers anymore the Avengers was over.No, the vigilante criminals now. Tony downed his drink in one go, setting the glass down and ordered another round.
Tony set his empty mug aside and stood up with a stretch. “Yeah, I can do that.” He headed over to the barn and grabbed the bag of animal feed. On his way out Tony paused and spotted a lump of black fur snoozing inside, apparently they had adopted a barn cat. The feline lifted it's head and blinked emerald green eyes sleepily and licked at a black paw. “Tell you what kitty cat, you can stay as long as you pull your own weight and do something about the mice around here.” The cat yawned and nuzzled back into a little ball. He'd ask Steve if he knew about their latest visitor.
“You're beautiful you know that?” Tony stated as he pulled his own shirt up and tossed it to the floor. “Just...damn they weren't kidding when they called you the peak of human perfection.” Tony said while he tugged Steve's shirt up. Steve lifted his arms to make it easier on Tony, and once he was shirtless he settled his hands on Tony's waist and drifted his hand up his bare back. Steve leaned in and trailed his lips over Tony's chest and around the glowing arc reactor.
It had been a grueling couple of months for the Avengers. First they had to do some clean up of rogue AIM and Hydra facilities doing some very illegal and dangerous activities. Thor had requested their assistance with some civil war between some otherworldly beings that no one knew how to pronounce properly. An MIT student accidentally released a swarm of little bots that liked to attached themselves to electronic devices and zap their battery power to continue their own little lives. That wasn't including the mountains of paperwork, public relations, and clean up projects the Avengers were involved in.
“AH! Fuck!” Tony cursed, and his entire body shuddered. It burned, the stretch of his hole around Steve's cock was immensely uncomfortable,they had rushed the prep he was certain of that now. Despite the discomfort though the head of Steve's cock had forcefully grazed against Tony's prostate and a fissure of pleasure warmed his core.
Tony took a moment to breath and calm down before he set to fondling his balls, rolling and gently tugging them in his hand. He shifted slightly on the bed into a more comfortable position and sighed contently as he drew out the experience. Tony wondered if Steve would be a top or a bottom would he be as domineering in the bedroom as he was on the battlefield? Tony shivered pleasantly at the thought, but then again Steve as a power bottom, begging for Tony to fill him and fuck him, that had its appeal too.
“Yes-Yes I do! I told you I almost did once but...I came too early...please can we just try?” Tony was so eager, so willing. Steve wanted to give Tony what he asked.
Tony began to move his hips, rocking back and forth at first just getting used to the push and pull of Steve's length inside him. He got more bold, more heated as the drag of Steve's cock rubbed gloriously against his prostate. Tony worked his hips and rose up down on Steve's length, bouncing, moving with a solid rhythm. Tony glanced back at the mirror, he watched as Steve's thick cock disappeared into his body and pulled out slick and coated in his fluids.
Steve stepped up beside Tony and their eyes met briefly. Steve wasn't going to let it all just end because they were returning to the world. He and Tony had spent every night together since initial visit to Tony's room that stormy evening. They had chosen not to broadcast it to anyone on the team, and if any of the Avengers were aware of their nightly activities they said nothing. Steve didn't want to be secret, he didn't want it to mean nothing, he couldn't lie to himself anymore that he could be satisfied with being a distraction.
Finally after what felt like an eternity of waiting Steve felt Tony add a little more pressure and the tips of his fingers finally breached past the ring of muscle. Steve breathed out slowly to allow himself to relax but he still snapped his hips up every so often in hopes of driving Tony's fingers deeper into himself to stimulate that pleasure spot inside. His prostate. He shifted on the bed as Tony then flicked his tongue over the left nipple while pushing two fingers in and out of his clenching channel.
“Typically, but every lord has different tastes.” Tony stroked a hand over the short cropped beard on his chin. “Some feel superior when they take another man with some masculine features. It's empowering I guess.”
“Harder, please Tony harder.” Steve panted, so lost in his own pleasure he didn't even know what else was occurring around him. Tony let the centipede use him as it wanted. He closed his eyes and just moaned, each movement sent a fissure of hot jolting pleasure through his body from the stimulation of his prostate, and the tight clenching heat of Steve's ass. Every roll of Tony's hips felt incredible, he didn't know what he wanted more of, to drive himself deep into Steve or feel the shaft of the centipede rub that pleasure spot inside himself.
“New...reactor...” He said a bit breathlessly. Steve turned his attention towards where Tony was pointing and he picked up the replacement. It was much deeper than Steve had imagined. It must extend very far into Tony's chest cavity. “Okay...when I take this...out...” Tony ground out. “You attach that piece on the end...in-into the-the center here.” He tapped his chest. “W-When it powers on I-I will be...okay.” Tony let out as slow breath. “...one...two...go...” He twisted the dying reactor in his chest and pulled the device out. As soon as he disconnected it from his body more alarms started blaring. Steve tried not to let the blaring noises distract or worry him but the look on his face must have betrayed that, Tony waved him off and grabbed for the new one. Hastily Steve grabbed the end with the cord and inserted it into the cylindrical cavity of Tony's chest. Once it was attached the blaring machines went quiet, and Tony grasped onto the new reactor twisting it into place. Tony seemed to physically jolt as he got the arc reactor in place.
Steve regarded Tony for a moment, unsure if this was really what Tony wanted or if it was some weird form of pillow talk that would be disregarded in the morning. Even if that were so Steve wanted to hold onto the sliver of hope that he could have Tony again in his arms like this. That he would be allowed to touch, to kiss, and hold, even without the sex, or hell even if it was only about the sex, Steve knew he would take whatever Tony was willing to give. Steve reached a hand up and lightly touched his fingers to Tony's cheek affectionately before he moved in and kissed him softly.
“Yes!” Tony gasped and raised his hips up for emphasis. “I need you in me. Need you to fuck me.” Steve smiled and positioned himself, guiding his length with his hand he pressed the head against Tony's hole and entered him. Tony closed his eyes and grit his teeth at the burn, Steve was very well endowed. After what felt like several long minutes Steve was fully seated inside of Tony, the blonde had to take a moment to breath before he lost it and came too soon. Tony was all tight wet heat that surrounded him perfectly. They kissed, slow and sensual and Steve angled one Tony's legs up, bending his knee to get his hips at a better angle. Steve bit back a low grown, the new position seating him even deeper. He took a few more moments to enjoy the sensations before he rocked his own hips back and thrust forward. Tony gasped at the overwhelming feeling of Steve's cock stretching him the hard length gliding into him.
The conversation took a turn to dating an relationships as Steve was curious and hopeful Tony would find someone that could cherish his brilliance. No one deserved to be alone if they didn't have to be. Steve knew all too well what isolation felt like, but with the serum preventing him from aging it was impossible for him to ever hold a serious relationship. Steve couldn't fathom watching his partner grow old and eventually die, leaving him alone. It wasn't fair to them to give themselves to him. It had been a strain for him and Peggy.
“Experimentation is healthy for someone your age. There is no reason to be ashamed or embarrassed. Just as long as you are happy with who you are in the end.”
Steve stepped into the lab space and his breath caught, Rocket and Nebula appeared to still be arguing about something, Okoye, was holding an arm down to the table, Shuri was administering a pain killer to the stomach wound. On the table laid Tony, he was fighting them to sit up, but Okoye was holding his left arm down. Steve's eyes trailed to the torn dirty fabric of Tony's clothing, stained with dust and grit the shirt sleeve had been ripped off. Tony's shoulder and bicep were covered in dried blood, around the arm above where the elbow should have been was a metal ring like a tourniquet of sorts, the flesh around it was raw and still bleeding. The ring was held in place by screws that dug deep into the flesh and bone.
Tony gently tugged at Steve's hair pulling him back from his chest, he was breathing heavily his chest rising and falling as he stared down at Steve with intensity. Steve found himself unable to look away, his gaze locked with Tony's his lips parted as he panted for breath feeling a rush of energy coursing through him. His hand touched Tony's face as they drew in closer, he closed his eyes leaning in towards Tony closer-closer. Their lips touched, gentle and hesitant at first, but Tony took control right away deepening the kiss by slipping his tongue into Steve's mouth.
“Look” Steve ordered Tony, his voice dropping low with authority. Tony's gaze was off to the side, he could feel Steve's hands on him, he could feel the pads of Steve's fingers circling over his wet hole. He knew what Steve was doing, but he didn't want to see it. The shame and humiliation rose up from inside, his face flushed with the embarrassment of what Steve was trying to make him view. Steve's other hand came up and he held Tony's chin gently and turned his head to face the mirror he had propped up to face the edge of the bed. “Look.” Steve repeated the order, as he dropped his hand from Tony's chin and trailed it back down between his legs.
Tony sipped his drink idly, and let his eyes drift briefly among the others in disinterest and-what the hell?-Tony stopped dead, he felt his heart rate pick up as his adrenaline suddenly spiked. He tensed. Steve Rogers was in the bar. Tony quickly took note of all the exits and started to look for any other potential threats, was Steve alone? was he here to finish the job? take him out? Tony swallowed back the anger that filled him. He took a drink, and breathed in and out slowly. He had to play this cautiously or else risk creating a scene. Also he didn't stand a chance of taking Steve one on one without the armor.
There was no sense in looking back at what ifs, and could haves...the damage was done and all they could do was move forward. Steve's breathing eased and he felt the worst of the anguish leaving him, his mind clearing he looked up at the sky at the stars above. Thanos was out there still and they had to find a way to stop him from committing such an atrocity again. He stood and wiped the dirt from his pants and let out a heavy sigh. This war for the infinity stones appeared to be over, but they couldn't give up just yet. Somehow they'd find a way to undo it or avenge the lives of all those who had been lost and they'd do it as a team.
“I think you are the one that needs to make yourself comfortable.” The man replied, his velvety voice had a note of amusement to it.
Steve was there holding it out with an apologetic expression. “Sorry I couldn't be there I thought this would be appropriate. Not everyday you graduate college, and with two masters.” Steve smiled warmly as Tony took the cake.
Steve had accepted that Bucky was a mere infatuation that would never become a reality and so he had moved on. He had thought he had found his true love in Peggy, buy 70 years in the ice had robbed him of that. Now here he was in the future, cock hard and leaking while he imagined what Tony Stark, playboy billionaire, looked like naked. Most of all Steve wondered about the arc reactor and that gorgeous blue light that he had grown to associate with Tony's level of injury on the field. Blue light meant he was alive, steady and glowing meant he would recover, but dark or flickering meant trouble and medical assistance was needed. He couldn't help himself, now whenever he saw Tony he would always check. He would glance down at that circular light just to be certain. Steve sometimes still had nightmares of the battle of new york and Tony's arc reactor remaining dark and unlit as he lay motionless on the pavement of the street.
“Oooh god!” Steve gasped while he squeezed his cock. He had never been rimmed before, and although the centipede lacked a tongue the wet suction it applied to his hole was incredibly gratifying. More of the clear viscous fluid from the centipede's maw spilled out covering Steve's ass and dribbling down over his thighs. It made Steve hyper aware of every nerve ending back there, the sucking sensation wasn't enough though. He wanted more, he wanted to be filled, stretch, fucked. With his free hand Steve trailed down, feeling over his own heated skin, caressing along the soft mandible squeezing over his flesh, and maneuvered a finger between the centipede's wet maw and his own entrance.
Tony couldn't let anyone know of what he did. There was no way that Steve would share his attraction after all Tony was convinced that Steve was straight given the time period he came from. Not that there weren't gay people in the 40's, but sexuality was a lot more repressed then. Perhaps if Steve had grown up in modern times he may have been more open to experimentation, but Tony wasn't about to risk his dirty secret coming out. So Tony kept his depravity to himself, isolating himself and feeling the shameful disgust when he looked at Steve with the dirty thoughts of what he wanted to do to the man.
“Gold digging at that age? That's awful...you're more than just money. I hope there were a few good ones?”
Tony had to swallow hard as he was overwhelmed by his senses and needs. This must be the heat, it probably wasn't fully out of his system yet. Tony had read that situations like this could occur for some omegas and heat-like symptoms could return after the fact. He made a move towards Steve but paused again when he felt it. The wetness...the slick. The reminder that he wasn't a normal man, he was an omega bitch. Now that he was no longer in his lust addled state Tony felt the shame and disgust within himself.
Tony examined his new hand, he formed a fist and then spread his fingers apart, he did it several times watching the metal digits open and close. He could feel it just as well as if it had been his flesh hand, but the signals were just different enough for him to read it as not quite right. Shuri and he had worked together well to fashion the design, a perfect meld of his nanobot tech with Wakandan vibranium. He slid his fingers up the metal surface to the elbow, he curled his arm in and extended it out. The movement as dexterous and flexible as if it were flesh and bone. Tony wondered if he should get into the prosthetic business.
Steve suckled on Tony's nipple and slid his hand up along the man's naked side, feeling over the curve of his hip, up over a flat tight stomach, rubbed his palm over Tony's chest and toyed with the other nipple with his fingers. He was rewarded with a sharp inhale that shifted to a moan from Tony. He brushed his thumb over the areola, gave a soft squeezing tug on the hardened nub. Tony was gasping, moaning as Steve suckled and teased his nipples The noises coming from Tony's mouth made Steve ache to hear more.
“Deeper, push deeper.” Tony breathed. Steve hesitated for a moment still not wanting to hurt Tony at all, but he complied with the request pushing his fingers in just a little further and-“Oh-Oh God Ooooh!” Tony cried out and bucked his hips, Steve had nudged his prostate. “Again-Again please Steve do that again.” Tony practically begged, his hips slowly rocking against Steve's fingers. Steve had to reach down with his free hand and grip the base of his cock to draw himself back from the edge. Watching Tony in such ecstasy, hearing him beg and the way he wailed in pleasure was like Steve's own personal porno.
“Oh? Oh you like dirty talk baby? Had I known that I wouldn't have held back. My horny soldier, so desperate for a thick hard cock in his ass?” Tony panted, it was a little difficult to concentrate on words while Steve was bouncing on his dick. He was going to do his best, if anything talking could help him stave off his own fast approaching orgasm.
So perhaps asking a woman to model was a bit out of his comfort zone, as Steve wasn't entirely sure he could separate the idea of sex and art just yet. He wondered if it would be easier to ask for a male at first. With no difference in anatomy it may help to ease Steve into the process of drawing another human being, and he didn't have to start right off with a nude. With his mind made up Steve had ventured down to the lower chambers of the castle and met with Master Fury to set up a meeting with his concubine.
“Can you tell me exactly what happened to me in there?” Steve asked after a few days. Bruce had been working diligently to run through all the necessary tests to get Steve into the clear.
In the workshop Tony was surprised when Jarvis announced Steve was at the door waiting for entry. That was odd...there hadn't been any calls to assemble...at least Tony was 75% certain there hadn't been, but he had been wrong before. He allowed Steve entrance and spun around in his chair at the worktable and plastered his usual grin on his face.
Steve shook his head as he reached over getting into the drawer and pulling the lube out. "I'm not judging, we all have stresses to take care of." He said as he kissed Tony lightly. He undid the top and put some in his hand. Steve made quick work of prepping Tony, pushing a single finger into him, and moving to two then three. They both were growing impatient, and Steve didn't want to hurt Tony, but he knew he was being hasty in the prep.
Tony's brow was furrowed and his dark eyeswere intense as he stared Steve down. Even with their height difference, even with Tony looking up at Steve he still commanded an air of dominance within himself. It was admirable. Then Tony's features softened as Steve's words registered and he looked off to the side almost in shame.
Steve entered the penthouse and found Tony sitting by the bar busying himself on his phone while he waited. Tony looked up at Steve and set the device down on the bar. “So...you still willing to try out my little solution?” Tony's body language read as guarded, not openly suggestive but not closed off either. He was giving Steve the option to agree or pull out of this all together and look for some other alternative.
Sure he could find a mirror and practice anatomy sketching using himself, but even after so long of being blessed with his new body, a soldier, a fighter, given to him by the alchemists mystery concoction. Steve still felt uneasy in his own skin at times, and vanity had never been a flaw of his. It felt wrong to look upon himself in such a way, even from an artists perspective, his body still didn't feel as if it truly belonged to him. So he avoided it and chose to draw others.
"I did!" Steven immediately spoke, standing up as he did that which made the Alpha's gaze fall on him as they darken. "I did, and you know I am right… Most people in this room did not have a choice but to serve under him or their families will be killed." Steven tense as he saw the narrow eyes of the Iron King, but the spark of interest… Steven was going to take advantage of it.
"Why?" Steve ended up asking, part of him was shocked that Steve managed to ask the question, another part was grateful for the burst of courage that took over him. "Why did you decide to come with me? I know you don't want to step a foot outside of the house, but why risk it and come with me?" Steve asked, wanting to know the answer so much.
The universe that Steven woke up in is different, as werewolves lived in that universe, as you read werewolves have this A/B/O Dynamics the reason that Edith put the dynamics she found in the category fiction, was because when she cross-references the information she found on the A/B/O Dynamics, the information she got was not the information that was similar to wolves, but with fictions from her universe, remember, Edith is an AI that can hack into any software she wants with Steven's orders, she also has an unlimited storage unit, even if she was created to resemble a small glasses… let's just say that's a sliver of what 30 years science from the future is like.
"I… it's… OK…" Steven muttered as his hand runs gently on the smooth metal, giving a small tired smile. "It's made of Vibranium by the way…" Steve said as he caresses the rings in his hand, smiling a little when he read the words written inside the rings
"Little Peter here is a fan of yours since he was three, ever since you invented the Arc-Reactor, he wanted to be an engineer like you, he even invented gadgets in the garage, I really don't know from where his smart came from, too bad he didn't love art." The Alpha said with a mock disappointment which made the pup whines.
This amazing song by 'madsteaparty' at TikTok, one of my favorite songs of his, if you like, check out his other songs, you would find them amazing for any dark mood you have ;)
"Stay back!" Tony snapped pushing Steve behind him as he raised his repulsors, ready to fire if Thanos came any closer to Steve than he already did; Steve's breath could only hitch in his chest when he noticed that everyone had finally snapped out of their shock, he noticed how Thor was slashing and hammering his way through the Chitauri, trying to reach Steve and Tony and fast as he can, but Steve knew… Steve knew that Thor won't arrive in time.
"Don't make promises you can't keep, please don't… I got enough to last me a lifetime…" Steve whispered tiredly as he leaned on Tony's chest, taking a deep breath as he tried to calm himself down, eyes dropping tiredly as the Omega fought to stay awake, which made the Alpha croon as he rocked him trying to calm him down…
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, confusion, a little bit of violence, and Steven screaming his head off with Peggy! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
"I gave you the serum, I'm sure that you remember that much at least." Howard state, annoyance and resignation clear in his voice, like Howard, spent all the time Steve was unconscious repeating his words over and over again. "You nearly died; you couldn't handle the serum and the poison at the same time, your heart was about to explode, but you survive somehow…
"Oh, oh! What did they want? What did you do? Is the Red Skull alive too? Were they after Captain America's serum? What happened?!" Peter squeals as he looked at the Alpha while clutching his shirt tightly, hoping that the man will tell him what took place in detail because not every day a supervillain organization will return back after forty years of nothing.
, you look so dashing in this suit, so amazing!" Steve sighed, a dreamy look on his face as he took Tony in; Tony on the other hand tried to ignore the hearts that were throbbing in Steve's eyes, which was kinda freaky if you asked Tony, but what can he do? Tony was a magnet for trouble since he was a kid, catching the attention of the Addams family was one of the far possibilities, but it was possible with his crazy life.
Ever since Steve entered Tony's room the first time… he didn't stop coming back… ever since that night he met JARVIS and Dum-E, he couldn't handle being away from the room. It was like safe heaven to Steve, a security blanket, the only place he knows that he wasn't going to get fingers pointing at him, leading him to more madness…
"Oh, you don't say, Mr. 'Leave My Harley-Baby Alone Or I Will Kick You In The Nuts'" Steve said back, causing Tony to hide his face in Steve's neck as he held his laughs, remembering the day one of SI's guards nearly pulled Harley and throw him out of the building just because the pup wandered away from Tony's side… needless to say the man quit the next day and start working on the docks after Tony was done with him.
"M-my… k-king… stay back I will kill it!" Tyber squeaked as he pushed Anton's horse away and ignoring everyone's warnings and protests in doing that; Tyber defying the order did nothing but cause trouble as Anton's horse let out a loud neigh as it bucked several times, causing Anton to curse as he fell from the beast who decided to run for its life. The commotion caused the white bear to raise its head and sniff the air, the terror and fear taking over as they waited to see what the bear was going to do. The bear though only let out a grunt before turning around to leave, causing everyone to let out a relieved sigh. The relief was short as everyone gasped in horror when they saw an arrow sailing toward the bear, getting stuck in the animal's forelimb; turning to the culprit, they found Tyber holding the bow, his hands shaking as he tried to fire another arrow but failed.
"It's presents time!" Rhodey the energetic Alpha jumped around while still clutching Peter in his arms which made the pup laugh happily and start chanting the word 'Presents' with Rhodey which made the Omega roll his eyes at that but the smile refused to leave his face causing his family to exchange pleasant smiles.
"I promise to tell you everything from the start… just later, please." Steve plea, making Jarvis hum, and get out a white rose out of the inner pocket of his jacket, it was intact and freshly picked from the Stark's garden.
"Steve!" Someone called his name, causing Steve to let out a choked noise of terror when he saw the person who called him was no other than Bucky himself, standing near Steve with a joyful look on his face and flowers in his hands. "Thank God, sweetheart, thank God you finally woke up…" Bucky smiled happily as he took a step toward Steve, causing the Omega to flinch away.
"I am sorry Mr. Carbonell b-" Steve was cut by the older man laughing which made the Omega scowl at the Alpha when the older man regains control of himself he looked at Steve with amusement in his eyes, it made Steve tense as he saw the glee shining in the man's eyes.
It had been a week since Tony's talk with Fury, a week since Tony learned to read between the lines and discover what the creature in the lake wanted; a week with Tony packing his bag and contemplating leaving this town for once and for all… a week. And Tony still didn't know if he wanted to leave or not.
Dr. Cho paused as she saw the nervousness on the Omega's face when his eyes fell on his tummy, she contains her sigh, where was his Alpha? Didn't the Alpha know that the first appointment was always important for the Omegas and they need their Alphas support? She wondered if the Alpha knew how the poor Omega was a step away from an anxiety attack. "Well, Mr. Stark considering that you are twelve weeks, would you like us to do an ultrasound? To check in on the baby," The doctor said; trying to cheer the Omega and take his mind off the dark thoughts he seems to head to, her words caused the Omega to look around in embarrassment and nod his head shyly. Dr. Cho smiled at that happily, probably thinking that he was adorable or something, because if one thing was known all of his friends told him that he looked adorable when he blush. The doctor leads Steve to the machine in the corner of the room, and Steve sat on the chair and raised his shirt making the woman hum. "Now, this is going to feel cold." She said making Steve jump a little as he felt something sticky and cold on his tummy, he gave the doctor a nasty look which caused the Beta to chuckled softly. It was a few seconds later that he was able to hear the sound of a heartbeat in the room, making Steve freeze, and as fast as he can he turn to the screen looking at the black and white image. "Look here Mr. Stark this is your baby." The doctor said happily as she draws a circle around something, Steve narrowed his eyes trying to see, he then felt his throat close up as he saw a peanut shape, he swallowed, feeling his eyes becoming glassy, and a happy sob left him.
"I don't know Buck." Steve said after he paused, and that by itself made Bucky look at the Omega from the corner of his eye, years ago, a question like this would have had Steve spitting out a 'Fine' but know, now with a son and a house Steve seem different, tired, it made Bucky worried. "It's hard… Peter is sick, very sick, cancer." That made Bucky inhales the memory of Sarah Rogers flashing before his eyes. "And after the alien's attack… it is funny I really wanted to laugh every time I say this, but after the attack, the hospital was destroyed, the one that treated Peter, and I have to find a new hospital, and I have to pay double the amount, and… and I am so tired, Bucky." The last part was said in a whisper but Bucky catches it anyway.
“Steve, Steve are you awake? Can you hear me?” There was a voice over the intercom within the room. Steve opened his eyes slowly, his vision a little blurred from the wetness. Over by the door was a window and on the other side was Bruce. Steve stared at him for a moment, blinking away the tears and sniffed giving him a brief nod.
“You see it now don't you? Why I love what you are...embrace it Tony. You're an omega, a beautiful, amazing omega.” Steve panted, his body tense with exertion as he held Tony's hips and began to thrust himself up into the tight clenching channel. Tony could only give a drawn out moan as Steve pounded into him.
“Fuck-oh-fuck Steve!” Tony moaned. Once the last of the aftershocks had passed Tony pulled out of Steve and sat back on his heels. Both were catching their breath, Steve rolled onto his back as he collapsed, taking in long extended breaths. His body was covered in a sheen of sweat that only made his creamy skin glow.
“Tony!? Come on...Come on!” Steve shook him, but nothing. In a desperate motion Steve grabbed onto the chest plate of the armor and mustering all his strength he tore it from the rest of the suit. In a quick manner Steve places his hands one over the other over Tony's chest and began chest compressions as he head learned. “Breath...Tony please.” He begged as he focused on pushing against Tony's chest. Suddenly Tony gasped, taking in a breath of air...then another...and another the arc reactor seeming to get with the program and sputtering to life once again. Steve let out a heavy sigh in relief and sat back onto the ground. Tony was alive...that had been a close one. Without thinking Steve settled his hand over the arc reactor relishing the subtle hum from the device. Tony glanced at Steve's hand in confusion and was about to say something when Steve noticed the way Tony was staring at him. Steve pulled his hand away quickly and instead offered to help him up.
