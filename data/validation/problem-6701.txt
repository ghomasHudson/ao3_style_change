remember the last six months. They were some of the hardest of my life. And you know what? Because Steve and I were able to figure our shit out, I’m actually optimistic that the next six will be the best.”
He builds Pepper a lake house so that she and Morgan can have privacy, a nice quiet existence away from the city. And also according to Tony so that Morgan can grow up to be “Country Strong,” (whatever that means, Steve can’t seem to get a real answer). He builds a similar home for him and Steve on the adjacent property.
“I’m sure I will; see you in an hour Tony.” Steve laughs as he ends the transmission and turns around. If he pushes it he can be back there and in Tony’s suite in 20 minutes.
It’s the most Steve has ever heard Pepper say at once outside of a press conference (usually because when they are together both he and Pepper are fighting to get a word in around Tony).
He sighs and goes to get into the swimsuit he saw in the top drawer earlier with the little card on top marked “Guest” (there was also a lady’s bikini).
“Tony, just please this is so much more complicated than I think we are able to deal with right now. More than you know even –”
Tony rubs his hands over his face, almost laughing because it’s so horrifying. “She did… she also saw your naked ass walk across the frame, because I was on the call with the whole room in the background when you came in."
“But,” Bruce continues, “I should also tell you that it seems to me from your actions that you probably don't really agree with that statement.”
Thanks to everyone who is taking the time to read. I'm excited to post Peter, Thor and Bruce! I may also do a bonus chapter about the public finding out.
But it’s no good, all the balls look the same, and move in the same way. The only thing different about them is how much more advanced they’re getting. At just about the hour mark Natasha notices that one of the floating orbs is just a
Tony’s totally gone. He’s pressing himself up against the glass, working himself frantically with one hand while the other slides back to his ass, squeezing and massaging. Steve’s hands would be bigger, oh god.
Scott nods quickly. “Yeah no, I get it. I’m pretty sure I’m like 83% straight actually. Hope is thinking she may move out here soon! It’s not that I’m like… you know I don’t
“Well, first I was thinking we’d get clean. I wash you, you wash me, simple.” Steve can picture them running their hands all over each other, smoothing Tony’s fancy soaps and creams into every crease and crevasse. He gets even harder and it doesn’t
He debates how crazy it would be for Steve to find him dressed to the nines in his best suit at midnight, by himself, in an empty tower.
“I know, I know, it is not the most honorable request. Some may even call it trickery.” says Thor. As usual Thor has begun a monologue unprompted while Tony works. “It’s not that I want to use underhanded means. More that, after 1,500 years I am starting to see there is a time and place for methods beyond force.”
“So, what now?” asks Steve after they’ve laid there for several long moments. He knows they’ve pretty much planned what to do over the next month to get everything back on track, but, he’s not sure when or how Tony is expecting him to leave. How can he be expected to leave when things feel this perfect?
The house and deck cast a decent amount of shade, and then there’s about twenty yards of bright white sand beach out to the ocean. All the umbrellas, paddle boards, surf boards, snorkeling gear etc. are in containers under the deck, along with a massive hot tub (hot tubs, fun in warm and cool weather!). Maybe if he gets a couple surf boards set up before Steve gets here he can distract him from the serious “Tony you need to be more responsible” talk he sees coming. He takes out a pair of flip-flops from bin marked “clothing” and begins dragging a huge umbrella out toward the water. He only gets about fifteen feet before he decides this is the best spot to set up camp. The heat of the sunbaked sand is bleeding through his designer flip-flips (also, right, car accident… dragging beach umbrellas more painful than carrying luggage).
“I don’t want to make you uncomfortable, and I know the timing of this is really shitty… say the word and we can pretend this never happened. Tell me no, and I’ll still be here to bring the team home and support you any way I can.”
of sites online that dissect all the slightest body language from paparazzi shots and stuff! Anyway the other week someone was sending around this shot of the two of you getting ice cream at this place in Brooklyn? And I
“No I fucking do not! I’m just going to grab a quick shower and… unwind a bit, and then come back to bed and snuggle you into my $50,000 mattress, deal?”
He imagines Steve ripping them from the wall while fucking him. Maybe they can do some stress tests next time…
“So good Tony, I uhh, can barely stop myself from pummeling into you, feels too good. Don’t want to hurt you.”
Steve comes three times and they barely make it to the venue in time. Wanda glares at them as they settle into their seats as the Center’s lights dim.
He looks at Tony’s profile. His eyes are closed, and he appears to be doing the calming deep breathing exercises Bruce taught them a couple months ago. Tony, who is renowned for his sexual exploits, his sex tapes, his recklessness, his rule-breaking and everything else. Who just pushed him away because Steve asked to take things slow. Sticking to the arbitrary rule Steve set, after watching Steve break his own rules time and time again.
Steve doesn’t want to try and lift it. He knows somehow in the dream he can’t. He doesn’t feel particularly worthy at the moment anyway, and knows trying will be pointless.
“To coming home” the rest say in unison, and dig in. The paprikash is about half gone when Steve clears his throat. They’re doing this.
“Pepper, Pep. Hold on, okay? Look that’s not… that’s not at all how I wanted you to find out about this. Umm, I’m sorry? I don’t know what to say here, we… you…”
I'm hoping the tone/style of these last two chapters isn't too jarring. Since we are covering a lot of plot/time from the Infinity War and Endgame movies, I scrimped a bit on exposition since we are all (hopefully) pretty familiar with those!
Tony snorts a laugh, and Pepper looks incredulous. “Haha, oh man Pepper, thanks for that vote of confidence! … Why don’t you tell me what you
Steve looks through the package and sees there are some clothes and other items inside it including a clipboard with paperwork, a pale blue button up, khaki pants, a doctor’s coat (including a pocket protector and fountain pen), and a pair of glasses. Steve smiles and picks up the glasses. They are wire-framed and look a bit old-fashioned, even to him. There are no shoes, but Steve figures he should just wear his semi-formal loafers. He’s been to enough doctors to know how to dress like one. He quickly puts on the clothes and the glasses, anxious to get back to Tony.
is a thing he’s looking at. Steve probably doesn’t even know about the… implication of his actions. People probably got down on their knees a ton back in the day. That was a praying thing, right? Steve is probably just doing some old-y time-y penance thing that is in no way sexual. Focus. Steve is saying a lot of important shit.
- Tony and Steve reunite after their month+ separation. At first they need to play it cool since the whole team is around.
Tony takes pleasure in going to sleep every night with Steve in the suite, and when things are quiet disappearing with him for hours during the day undisturbed.
Tony swallows, reminding himself to get into character (even though all he wants to do at this point is gush to Steve about how amazing he looks in glasses).
At the time he didn’t pay much mind to the “I think” Tony tagged on there. But now it catches at his mind. Surely Tony knows how happy he is? He looks down at him, and in this moment desperately needs to let him know.
“God, look at you” says Tony, as he cups Steve’s face with one hand, the other still on Steve’s shoulder.
He’s even doing those damn meditative breathing exercises that Bruce tried to get him to do every day for a week. Thank god Bruce is doing yoga or whatever with Natasha now, for a while there Tony thought he’d have to actually go through with daily meditation just to keep his lab partner.
“No, yeah, I gotcha. Hawaii’s never really been my favorite anyway. I’ll send you back here whenever you want though, bring some people, whatever.”
“Welcome again, you can pick from any of the empty rooms. The first official team meeting will appear in the calendar on your new phone.”
A couple of months ago Peter suggested they do a “really old movie night” (that is, films from the 80s and 90s). His Aunt May finally eased up after Thanos and agreed that he could be around the team mask-less. His argument being that if he had a hand in saving half of all existence, he should at least have a little more freedom to bond with the team. Pete can now come to the compound to hang out twice a week (as long as his homework is done), and has a curfew of 11:30 pm.
He steps into the huge stall that’s already steaming up, turning his back to the water and letting the warm pulsing liquid do the rest of the work his breathing exercises started. He’s calm for all of ten seconds before he remembers that Steve is just outside the door. In his bed. And he just turned him down for what would have likely been the shortest frottage experience of his life (which is saying something given the amount of time Tony spent rutting in boarding school).
Tony tries to slam himself back against Steve as a non-verbal signal that no indeed he does not need a minute. But true to his word, Steve is holding his hips, and all Tony can do is squirm in place as his movements are totally restricted. “I’m good, I’m good” he says.
He leans forward, taking Tony’s hands back up to the pillow above his head and entwines their fingers, holding them above Tony’s head while he braces the majority of his weight on his elbows. Something about the position feels familiar, and he realizes it’s similar to leaning forward full tilt on his Harley. Just a different kind of ride. He grins, suddenly confident.
didn’t want it. He feels like Tony is speaking a different language. Can't he see this is about how Steve let him down?
Tony narrows his eyes. “Friday, scan Steve for any foreign materials, check his brainwaves and do a full wellness check.”
Steve’s eyes are still shut in bliss but he raises an eyebrow at the last part, which is obviously another command for the shower.
“Shh, it’s okay Tony. You’ve done so much. For everyone. For me. Will you let me? Let me take care of you?”
Pepper holds up her hand to silence Tony’s stuttering. Tony hears the shower turn on. Shit, he can’t let Steve wait too long or he’ll come back out here. He turns 180 degrees so that the view-screen is no longer facing the living room and bathroom, at least. Now the view Pepper has is just his super classy bookshelves and widescreen TV. Maybe she’ll think it’s so well-appointed she’ll be distracted from the fact that she just saw Captain America’s ass.
“I’m going to lift your gown and examine your torso and abdomen. Let me know if the pressure from my hands hurts or is uncomfortable.” says Steve.
“There are also a couple of options for how you’ll be positioned. Honestly, I think we are likely going to have to give you two doses today, so I think we can try both, and that way we will know what you prefer in the future. How does that sound?”
Tony brings his hands together, grinning like a maniac. “Everything you need is in a package on the bed. I figured we could both shower and then get to it.”
“So I was shrunk down as Ant Man, doing my sweep, looking for weak points in your security, and for the last part I checked all the personal rooms, because people often let their guard down in their personal spaces and they can be some of the least secure in the home, or er, the compound. And anyway, I was about to leave, when you and Steve came into the suite and I maaaay have seen you kiss. And nothing else!" He throws his hands up in defense.
Steve smiles, and thanks Bruce again before rushing out the door. He’s got a meeting to get to, and a couple of conversations to figure out.
“You’re going to take me deep again, and while you do you're going to be able to get some friction on that beautiful cock of yours. Wipe up that mess. You can come if you need to, or not, but either way we’re gonna take care of our little precum problem, okay?”
“Ant Person! Welcome back, how’s things?” Tony rattles off as he leans over the bar to shake Scott’s hand.
Tony slides his hands along Steve’s jaw, his mouth pulled up to one side and responds, “Me too. Whatever it takes, right?”
Tony practically runs out of their bedroom to get to the alternate access point to his panic room in order to beat Steve there. Or, it
Steve gently kisses Tony awake. He can’t believe this will be the last time he gets to do that… not the last time, but the last for some indeterminant amount of time.
Steve’s own cock is trapped between them, getting little random brushes of friction. He attaches his mouth to Tony’s and continues to slide, slick and fast over his length.
When it's over he takes a moment to brace his arms on either side of Tony and find some equilibrium. Steve knows he’s made a huge mess of Tony, but he doesn’t want to just leave immediately to clean up. Tony solves that for him by pulling him down so their chests squelch together. He presses Steve further, encouraging him to rest more weight on top of him.
“I don’t think that. And I’m not crazy or hurt or anything like that. I think I’ve just… had a lot of time to think lately, about you. About who you are and what you mean to me. And all that thinking led me here.”
Tony loses days on the project. It’s almost like when he built the Mark II; nothing stops him. Steve comes down a few times to try to get him to take a break. Tony doesn’t even hear him as he plays back different barks from over 100 dog breeds and calculates the perfect curvature of the ears. Bruce even comes in to try and reason with him. Tony plays the Great Dane bark to the tune of “We Will Rock You” until he gives up and leaves.
“Can’t wait to see you come. Wish you were in me, giving me what I need. Uh, taking care of me, coming in me so hard and so hot. Giving me my medicine…”
There’s a loud click and the groin plating disappears to reveal Tony’s hard cock, silently swaying inches from Steve’s now-empty mouth. Steve is pretty sure that isn’t something the armor does in real life (nor is Tony in the armor naked... he's 95% sure). He takes a moment to appreciate what’s been revealed.
Steve is floating on a cloud of bliss until Tony tells him he’s about to leak bodily fluids onto a priceless rug. Realizing that he’s so worked up, so wet, that Tony has noticed, that’s mortifying enough, but to think he could ruin something like that…
But he holds still as a green beam of light scans over his head for several long seconds and then down his body.
Tony glances down in an effort to understand Steve's sudden distress. Steve has now edged off of him, and is holding himself away from the matress, eyeing the mess they've made of the comforter like a harangued house cat.
Tony rolls his eyes and Steve can just hear him mumble something that sounds like “Pepper didn’t know…”
Something shifts in his brain then. He’s never had penetrative sex with a man before, and he’s certainly never
Rocket has accompanied Thor as usual, and is poking around in some random drawers in the background.
“Welp, there goes our only leverage that might have kept Thanos’ army from attacking Earth” quips Tony, though it's edged with true aggravation.
Bruce’s eyebrows raise. “So for the last eight months, the longest you’ve ever gone between sessions is two days?”
Steve stands and begins to pace, like sitting and listening to an AI give a report about their sex life is just too much to ask.
Steve looks at Tony, whose hand is still holding Steve’s hair. His cock is just a few inches from Steve’s mouth.
It’s just like any other day. The Avengers are called in to the city to stop the latest villain of the week. They seem to be popping up more and more.
Tony looks at him fondly and Steve isn’t used to it. Having Tony’s full undivided attention, it’s like, stepping out into the sun after being stuck inside all day. It’s blinding.
Luckily, his brain takes notes even when he’s distracted. He plays back everything Steve said, closing his eyes for a moment to focus on the words.
Tony is sure this whole thing has been an attempt to butter The Avengers up to do another calendar with the proceeds going to the Maria Stark Foundation (of which Pepper is the vice chair). The one they did six months ago flew off the shelves, namely because almost every Avenger that graced it’s pages was at
Steve and Tony stare in disbelief. Tony’s new blood sample now looks more similar to Bruce’s blood, or Steves than it does to his own blood results from a year ago.
“Nope! Reunification means perks, more specifically billionaire philanthropist perks, which means you can use one of my four, yes four, private planes. They fly themselves and are untraceable. I’ll put the app on your new phone to fly it. It’s easy, even a beautiful relic like you can do it.”
Steve shakes his head and scoops Tony up and takes him to bed. Things are still so up in the air, with everything… but Steve has to admit to himself that there is no one like Tony. As he’s tucking him in Tony mumbles “Good girl” a few times, but is obviously deeply asleep. Steve sits on the edge of the bed for a while, just looking.
As soon as the screen is gone, Steve jumps Tony and they make out like teenagers for a while. Steve isn’t sure what to make of the joke about getting married, they’re only just telling people after all. But he can’t help smiling into Tony’s mouth at the idea.
“Shit, no Steve, Stevie, I just mean this wasn’t the time! Dr. Rogers is maybe the hottest thing that’s ever happened to me, and it melted my brain and it just slipped out.” Tony grabs Steve’s shoulders before pawing somewhat pathetically at his chest. He’s fucking this up. Tony continues, “But I meant it. Of course I meant it. I’d have to be an idiot to not want to lock you down!”
Tony steps up on to the platform and grabs the lower set of hand-holds which are about two feet above his head in either direction. He spreads his legs and looks back over his shoulder at Steve, his lean body stretched out in a tantalizing X.
They rent a second boat when Rocket and Tony challenge Thor and Steve to a boat race (“Brawn verses brains” Rocket so delicately dubs the match).
Tony pauses to rub at his facial hair. "We don’t have an HR, so I think it’s down to you and me, winging it. Hmm, we may need an HR, and maybe a PR team. I'll float that by my people, like with Scott's security consultation we may be able to piggy-back off of SI's infrastructure.”
“Tony, that’s about the least surprising thing you’ve ever said to me,” Rhodey chuckles. “But I’m happy for you. Both of you.”
Steve quickly carries on before he can, “Not that I’m ashamed or embarrassed! At all. I don’t want you to think I don’t
Tony pushes his tinted glasses up his nose. “The webs are the kid’s own invention; he’s a budding scientist, hence the mentoring. Though I
“Tony, I'm not uncomfortable with you. I’m the opposite of uncomfortable. I just…” What can he say? There is no way to sum up all the aspects of the terrible conflict he’s feeling here. So he just says it: “I can't decide if you're the biggest mistake I could make, or the best thing I could ask for.”
Tony clutches at Steve’s neck to keep from sliding off the exam table. “Uh, wow, okay... I mean, yes obviously. Yes let’s do that… but… are you sure? Maybe you’re just high on endorphins from the stirrups? I mean, you’re a genius for finding those by the way, and I still really need you to fuck me with my legs spread open by them…”
“If you need to you can hold on to the handrails on the wall in front of you Steve.” There are two handrails above the platform in this setting, usually in showers they are there to prevent slipping, but in this case they are positioned to allow for a person who is fucking or getting fucked to have something to brace themselves on.
Tony is floored. Steve has just laid out exactly what he’s been wanting to hear all this time. Is he dreaming? Well no, if this were a dream he probably would’ve left out the horrifying trip down holocaust memory lane… but, yeah, wow.
Tony’s mind is on overdrive thinking of all the possibilities, but seeing Steve’s shocked face reminds him he probably needs to pull back a little. Steve has only been in the 2000s for four years. He was raised in the 20s and 30s, it was a totally different time. Steve probably gets the vapors from seeing a woman's ankle, he needs to remember that... Plus he’s probably heard about Tony’s past and thinks he’s a total slut…
Tony takes the gel-bead cloth and runs it firmly down between Steve’s cheeks, letting the little gel balls catch on his entrance, bump bump, bump, bump. Steve lets out a loud moan, he almost sounds like he’s in pain. Tony glides it back up, then back down.
Drawstring undone, his thumbs slide down and out beneath the top edge of Tony’s pants, dipping them down just enough to expose a strip of tan skin and smattering of dark hair. He wants to give Tony control; he wants to tell him how good he wants to be for him.
“Oh, umm, sorry, if that’s… if that’s too much. Too soon?” Steve suddenly wishes he wasn’t so close to Tony, looking him right in the eye… god they've only been together six weeks, and they were apart of a month of that. Tony must think it's too soon.
All his worry about telling people is slipping away. It felt so great to kiss Tony in front of Rhodey, or just, have him know they’re together. Steve is bursting with joy, with relief. He wants to chase that feeling.
Steve hurries on, determined to fix this. “I know, I get it now, I do. You want to give yourself to me on a level that transcends who comes, or when. You aren't just... I get it, and I want that too. So much Tony."
about Tony. But, there are so many things that he does... Tony isn’t that grey tom cat. Not really. In a lot of ways he is like some wild force, poised to hurt Steve, the team, himself. Because Tony
Steve tries to look at Tony with fresh eyes, and Bruce is right. He really does look better than he did a couple of years ago. Hell, even six or eight months ago.
Over the next few months Tony is thankful he’s invested in a barrier similar to the one in Wakanda to surround the compound. Drones and even helicopters trying to access the compounds air-space are gently stopped by the forcefield over two miles out. Friday stops notifying him of all the attempts and just adds it to her weekly report for Scott and X-Con.
He continues as he fucks his own hand, voice calm like he's talking about the weather. “Usually I wouldn’t show this to you before the procedure. The size and intensity of it can be intimidating. How are you feeling?” He starts gyrating his hips with more fervor, and all Tony can think is how beautiful he is.
It’s a thank you for letting him up to the penthouse tonight. For listening. For working to make things better. For understanding. For accepting Steve.
Steve blushes a bit. “I guess you spend enough time with doctors, you learn a thing or two” he says. “Between being sickly as a kid and the serum, I’ve probably seen more doctors than anyone on the eastern seaboard.”
Steve’s heart aches, Tony’s attachment to, and subsequent loss of, his AI makes that much more sense. He asks even though he feels like he knows the answer.
Tony makes small encouraging noises, a litany of soothing babble tumbles from his mouth as Steve works.
“I’m sorry I let you take on all the weight of what we’ve done tonight all on your shoulders. I’m not as experienced as you, and I just lost myself to the overwhelming feeling of it all. I didn’t – I was so focused on trying to give myself to you that I wasn’t letting you do the same.”
“I’m dating Captain America!” Tony practically shouts. “Well, okay technically Steve Rogers, but that’s just as good. Better. And before you say anything, I just want to tell you that I’m happy, like exponentially happy. And so is Steve, I think. And Pepper knows, and that was a whole thing, but I think it’s fine. And yeah. We’re in a relationship and we’re telling people and I wanted you to be one of the first to know.”
Steve knows how medical testing goes. It’s endless, and there’s rarely any answers at the end of it all.
Peter leans over so he can whisper to Tony that he now understands his joke about “No ticket” that he made when The Avengers were guests of honor on the Goodyear blimp for the Superbowl last month, but the words catch in his throat.
It's Tony's turn to roll his eyes, “Steve, Stevie, my all-America cherub, if you’ve learned anything about me over the last couple of days, I hope it’s that I will never, ever turn down a shower with you. And secondly, you’re insane if you think you’re
Tony takes stock of himself. He still has his shirt on, the vid-screen would just show him from the shoulders up with the rest of the room in the background. The lube and his other toys aren’t in frame… and Steve still isn’t due for another 40 minutes. If his plans come to fruition, he’ll be busy with Steve for at least the next several hours. So if this is something urgent, better to take care of it now.
“I’m – I need you to keep still and just let me move you. I’m feeling… god I’ve never felt like this. I need to focus 100% on this because I’m worried if I let go, if I get carried away, I could hurt you. How I move in you needs to be highly controlled. I need you control you. Do you understand?”
Tony, who can’t seem to help himself asks “Is anyone going to address that there’s a talking Build-a-Bear? No, just me?”
Vain as it is, Tony spends almost the entire hour it takes Steve to get from La Guardia to the tower primping and trying on clothes like a 14-year-old getting ready for their first date. Well, if a fourteen-year-old also ranted and raved, liberally firing off expletives to their AI.
“If I knew you thought I was… look, really, I know you don’t think of me that way and that it’s never going to happen. I’ve always known where we stand, this wasn’t about that… please don’t feel weird about this, shit.”
Steve surreptitiously takes one of the golden lube tubes out from under the nearby pillow and adds its contents to a second finger. It’s a tight fit, and the way Tony moans Steve is concerned he’s hurting him. He lowers Tony’s legs and lets them fall to the bed, allowing his lower body to go slack and loose, with his fingers still pressed inside.
Tony is sputtering and flailing his hands around, and Steve would find it adorable if it didn’t feel like the next few minutes were going to determine if he got everything he ever wanted, or returned to the team with his heart in a million pieces.
"Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards." says Tony as Strange moves Bruce to safety with one of his admitedly handy portals.
Steve blows air out his nose in amusement, shifting slightly as he feels himself grow even harder at the thought of Tony being filled and loving it, even though there’s no orgasm in it for him… yeah that’s…
The bathroom door begins to open and he yells out to Tony to wait. His perfect tactical mind can’t come up with anything other than to pull the covers up to his chin to hide his stained shirt and still-exposed lower half.
“Yeah no, it’s no big deal, the planes are going back and forth all the time for Pepper anyway. Also, you’re probably going to help save the world in the near future Scott, you don’t need to worry about money. No one on the team does.” He does a little hand flip like he’s telling Scott he can go ahead and order the porterhouse.
Tony wants to hear Steve give more medical talk, so he asks, “I’ve definitely had a prostate exam, but… this treatment, it’s more invasive, right?” Tony lets a nervous lilt creep into his tone.
As soon as the orb explodes, a giant hologram of the Chinese Celebration Ball emoji appears above them, exploding with digital confetti as the Star Wars throne room ceremony music theme from Return of the Jedi plays. The remaining orbs drop to the ground, inert.
. I want to show you what you mean to me by making you feel good, and by sharing a part of myself that I haven’t shared with very many other people… maybe only one other person in my whole life...” Tony pauses, unsure. “Honestly this feels like it might be something I’ve never had with anyone else.”
Steve takes a deep breath. “I was thinking, after we are all cleared, I could make a public statement of apology? Or of unity if that’s better? To make sure everyone knows I believe in you, believe in the team?”
Tony’s helmet retracts. “Well A, I don’t know do I? Because Friday has designed all the obstacles so I’m impartial. And two, bite your tongue. Start Wars is a part of the mainstream culture.”
Scott doesn’t even know what he’s just said. He can’t believe he’s about to get fired for peeping on Captain America and Iron Man.
Steve spends the entire car ride with his face pressed up against the window. He was too worried about Tony to notice much of Japan, but Hawaii as far as he can tell is the most beautiful place on Earth (though for his money Brooklyn in the spring is probably a close second).
Honestly, about 75% of him was glad, because fuck Becky. But the other 25% knows it’s because Steve is kind of messed up too, isn’t he? And he probably needs to work on a lot of things before he gets involved with anyone.
Tony runs his hands through his hair, sits back onto his heels and takes a few deep breaths. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry I freaked out there… I just, I thought you were hurt, and I couldn’t deal with it for a second.” He huffs a laugh and keeps talking “Fuck, I guess I really have lost it, huh? I can’t even keep it together when Captain America gets a little sand burn.”
Pepper says it’s fine if Tony leaves the plane they flew to Hawaii in L.A., and that the other one will be there for them to change planes when they arrive.
“Tony.” Steve interrupts. He knows Tony will go on like this for a while. “Why don’t you move on to the point you’re trying to make?” He’s smiling indulgently, where once he may have been frowning at Tony’s lack of focus. Turns out that’s what happens when you’re in more-than-love.
“Why don’t we start with you and see where we get? My life doesn’t appear to be in imminent danger, right? I mean, if anything I’ve stumbled on the fountain of youth. And fountain is right, you should really see-“
Thor looks up from his arm. “Ah Japanese food! I have tried sushi, it is some of Midgard’s most delectable food-stuffs. Do they serve sushi at this restaurant?”
Steve looks so wholly relieved that Tony almost does a little fist pump. Operation Shower is back on. “I think that sounds great Tony.”
Eight months ago he looked, well he looked good, but it’s the face Tony remembers. It’s the face he would expect to see when he looks in the mirror. Tony partied hard in his youth, and he
to get Hulk to come out. Five years ago he would have given anything for the other guy to suddenly develop a case of stage fright.
The rest of the group is waiting for them in one of the open practice fields. Tony introduces the kid and then tells the field “Activate training green 1.”
Steve follows, but if he’s honest he isn’t totally feeling this whole process. So far sharing their news has been mentally and emotionally exhausting.
Tony has been there right along with Steve in the months since the Chitauri, since The Avengers became... whatever The Avengers are. He's pretty sure he knows more about the real Steve than anyone else (anyone still living anyway...). He knows Steve.
Steve isn’t sure how much longer they could have kept at it without more of the team stumbling upon them. Staying apart was too hard, and they’d started to get careless.
The instant Steve kneeled in front of him, all that strength and all the purpose, surrendered on a silver platter to Tony. He sees he was lost from that moment. Completely fucked. In love with Captain America. He just hopes Steve is anywhere near the same galaxy as him right now. Fuck, he really didn’t want to get into all of this in the middle of their shower, but it looks like needs must…
Tony shuts the door to the bathroom with a quiet click, and presses his forehead to the door before telling JARVIS what settings he wants for the shower.
“Open it up for him, Fri.” he says as he takes two fingertips to the display and spreads them apart, zooming in on Steve’s face. He feels like a voyeur, but the last time he saw Steve he was at a distinct disadvantage, outnumbered and caught off guard. He won’t let that happen again. Steve is on his turf, in his tower. And Tony is still feeling pissed about everything.
Steve trails his hands over Tony’s chest and stomach, slowly sliding further and further, conscious that him being so tight might also be too much for Tony. It seems fine though, as Tony is now just wantonly thrusting his hips in little abortive movements and grabbing brutally at the comforter beneath his hands.
Sam chimes in, “Not even after you were back. I knew after you were gone 24 hours. You didn’t check in Steve! You
Six weeks post-snap Thor is almost recovered, and he is preparing to join the Guardians of the Galaxy in whatever adventures they find in space. Thor would be happy to stay longer, but Quill and the others are getting anxious to leave.
Steve pulls Tony close, once again supporting his weight easily. They make out lazily until Tony's tongue starts setting an insistent rhythm against Steve's own. Diving over and over, seeking out any traces of his own taste.
Or when she sits in Natasha’s lap after an especially taxing mission, turning on her warming function to sooth her aching muscles, and absently licking her arm as she reads.
Steve steps closer to the nearest shelf and picks up a cloth that feels like it’s made of a thousand tiny soft lumps with gel in the middle, and another that he recognizes as a natural sea sponge. “How do you pick from all the options?” he asks.
Okay, right. Captain America has come to his tower in the middle of the night, and gotten down on his knees to explain himself. What is his life that this moment isn’t the most surreal thing that’s ever happened to him?
“I don’t know that I understand, or know how to feel about that.” says Steve. “… but I guess if she can help us answer these questions, let’s hear it.”
Tony has said all of this in a single breath. Steve sits perfectly still waiting for Rhodey to react.
God what was Steve saying? Tony tunes back in to realize Steve is still rambling about changing roles, and progress in communication. He is about to save him from himself, when Sam pipes up.
He takes the small pillow from the top of the table and slides it under Tony’s backside, before sitting back on his rolling chair and sliding as close as possible. Tony gasps as Steve’s fingers slide into him, rubbing at the ejaculate still inside.
“Fuck Steve, are you okay? Do you have a head injury? Is there a gas leak? Have you been exposed to heavy metals?? I’m – I’m not, what even… help me out here because I’m really lost. Last I knew you were very straight, and also more in the camp of 'leaving Tony in Siberia is not something I regret.'”
Something flares up in Tony then. Some old hurt he’s been nursing for a long time, along with a new burning need to defend Steve.
Steve who has moved to take Tony’s foot out of the stirrup, pauses. Tony’s foot is held suspended in the air as Steve just stares at him, eyes wide.
It’s what he deserves, he knows. He really meant what he wrote to Steve: he is thankful for his friendship. No matter how many times he treats Steve like crap, he still comes back, all full of respect and warmth and…
Both gauntlets are on him now, framing his face and cradling his head as he slides his tongue down to the base of Tony’s erection and breaths deep, catching his breath. He moves lower and gently takes one testicle into his mouth, then the other. Tony seems content to let him slowly explore; occasionally he pauses to rest his head against the cool metal of Tony’s armored thigh.
Tony goes on, “A lot of what we did, the kneeling, orgasm denial, the way you took me and told me what to do. It skirted, or outright ran into dominance and submission, which is adjacent to a lot of other stuff like S&M. How are you feeling about all that?”
One day Steve walks into the kitchen and Tony and Pepper are leaning over a Stark pad laughing, and he’s not jealous, he’s really not.
The point is, he’s trying. And no one is making him this time. No one made him go to medical to get his hand looked at… no one is making him reign in the dozens of hurtful things he wants to say about
So, I think there's more to explore here (what does this mean for Tony's health moving forward? What does this mean for him and Steve? What will Bruce's tests show? Is Tony super strong now? Is this permanent?).
Steve has the sense to realize what’s happening and stops sliding. He lets go of Tony’s hands to sit up and bear down, squeezing Tony inside him to take him through the last of his orgasm. He tries to memorize Tony’s face. He'll try to paint this later.
Inside there is a note with some directions. There is a simple a single instruction at the top: “Get dressed.”
He never stopped loving the sensation of being fucked, but after he was outed by that shitty tabloid Obie "helpfully" suggested he should stick to dating women for a while “just until the dust clears” and then… then he scratched that itch with toys and few custom inventions.
He likes to think he felt that way with Pepper too. But his feelings for Steve are shining some clarity on his previous relationship. Of course he cared for her, loved her. But now that he’s on the other side of it he’s realizing how much he held back when they were together. How much he dreaded talking to her about what was wrong, because it always felt like it must be him.
“Hmm, well my nano-tech is highly advanced, Steve. As long as there aren’t like, noxious fumes in the air, I’m pretty sure the helmet will retrack to give you access.”
One day a couple months after LASS-E’s introduction when he and Tony are finally settling in to watch Indiana Jones, she comes up to him as usual and puts her paws up on his lap.
Tony strokes his almost jet-black facial hair (how had he missed that the grey was disappearing?). Tony glances at Steve. “So I think, I maaay know part of what might be causing this.”
Tony continues to frantically rant while pushing Steve back toward the house. Steve figures if Tony were physically able he would be carrying him bridal style at this point to keep him off the hot sand. Steve blushes. And yeah, now that he thinks about it, the sand is pretty hot… he just had more important things on his mind.
Tony’s eye glaze over a little. “Option 3 – is that you show me what you just learned. You open up my ass the way I just did for you… though you’ll need to use three fingers at least, god you’re so big Steve… then you fuck me, taking whatever you want from me. Win-win, I’ll get your cum in me, one way or the other, in my ass or in my mouth…”
… And he knows that that’s not enough. He knows that Steve doesn’t deserve to be shackled with his neurotic billionaire baggage. Steve didn't deserve to see the mess he was in Japan, and sure as hell doesn't deserve the media cirus that follow's everything Tony touches.
He remembers something Rhodey said on their call earlier. “Tony, did you really have Captain America sheets in college?”
Bruce nods. “That’s what I thought, which means… something else is going on with you Tony.” Bruce pulls up a few different holo-screens. “Here is an example of a normal, healthy blood sample, this is Sam’s.”
Steve is getting more worried as the questions mount. “Bruce, do you have any idea what is happening, or what it means?
we did that I didn’t like. I feel so comfortable with you; it feels so natural... I’ve never felt like this.” Steve’s throat gets tight.
She clears her throat. “So, they changed their menu and they have a crab-avocado burrito I think you’ll like…”
The team starts noticing. Sam keeps checking in with a knowing frown. Wanda especially seems to think she can help his restless sleep… and maybe he would let her do something, take a look at his shattered mind, if not for how the dreams always end.
“Tony, just stop, we’re in the shade now, okay? Stop pushing!” Steve is practically yelling now because Tony will not get out of his personal space, and is now tugging at his left foot to try and see if it is burned.
Steve, well Cap. Cap has someone. Someone named Becky who wears earrings… not goo and gauze and metal and pain and fuckery like a fucking cloak. Good.
The best sex of his life, is what. Which is really saying something because he dated Naomi Campbell for about a week in the 90s.
He looks over the texts and they are all some variation on “just checking in, let me know what's up when you can.”
“Friday?” asks Steve, “Can you pull up an image of Tony from eight months ago, and what he looks like currently and put them side by side?”
Steve grins and looks away as Tony slides over to the end of the bed and conspicuously keeps his back to the bed as much as possible as he makes his way to the bathroom.
Tony starts absently stroking Steve from base to tip, the precum making it slick and easy. “Hm? Oh yeah I know. That doesn’t matter…”
The urge to thrust is overwhelming, but Steve realizes with a sinking feeling that he doesn’t know how well he can control his strength like this. He’s never felt like this before, pulled to the edge, barely holding on. Usually when he feels anything like this he’s fighting for his life. Holding back isn’t really an issue in those cases.
Steve sighs and comes over to where Bruce is meaninglessly arranging plant protein slides, resting his elbows on the blank stainless steel counter about a foot away. Alright, it looks like this is happening… at least he will probably have the jump on Natasha in terms of intell on the situation (which rarely happens).
Tony scrubs up Steve’s thigh and back down. Smiling gently at Steve like he has no idea what could be the matter.
Steve finds a stronger hold under his ass while supporting his full weight and slowly lifts him up again, then back down. He repeats that motion over and over, adjusting the angle slightly each time. When he gets to an angle that rakes across Tony’s prostate, he can’t help but mewl.
He doesn’t really want to spend the evening with Thor and Rocket any more than Steve does, but Steve has the most adorable blush going, and Tony knows the entire dinner is going to be full of awkward!Steve, which is his second-favorite Steve.
Steve relaxes and takes a seat on the sofa a little bit away from where Tony is taking the call. He’ll listen in and join the call when he feels comfortable. That’s the best he can do.
Steve thought that after his break up with Becky, maybe they could normalize back into their friendship. And maybe they
sorry, Tony. I know we’re on the same page now about fixing things, about the team needing to be together. But I do – I really do think you were right too. There’s going to be something one day, something we can’t even fathom, and there will be no way we can beat something like that and protect the planet unless we’re united. We all need each other… and I, I need you.”
God, his arms look good, he wants to bite the swell of Tony’s biceps. Steve shakes himself, he was trying to tell Tony how happy he is.
Tony sighs. “So I guess you’re heading back a little sooner than we thought?” His voice is careful, even.
Once it’s all the way in, Steve twists and slides it in and out a few times before inserting it fully and going over to the trash. He removes his gloves.
Tony was telling the truth, this shower hasn’t seen much action. His schedule was hard enough to sync with Peppers, and she was never very keen on sexy showers… maybe
Where is Scott? Idk, probably off somewhere putting the finishing touches on his security assessment. Or on a video call with Cassie. The point is he wasn't needed for this scene haha...
Clint hasn’t looked over toward Tony, but says “I can’t believe Stark actually made something actually badass for once. I wonder if she’s battle-ready? I bet I could attach an extra quiver of arrows-”
“It’s because you insist on referencing Terran culture every other word. Which by the way, is one of the most boring cultures. Lower than the Sovereign, and they’re just a bunch of plastic with a coat of gold paint!" Rocket tosses the wrench into the drawer he threw the wires. "See, see how you could understand that because I didn’t stop at “The Sovereign”?
Steve comes. Everything whites out for what seems like minutes. He doesn't even feel like he's in his own body. Like there's so much pleasure coursing through him that there isn't any room for anything else... When he comes back to himself, Tony is coming into his mouth, down his throat at first, then pulling back so just the head is enclosed, flooding his mouth and coating his tongue. The last of it spills over onto his lips and chin.
Wanda gets up to begin clearing their plates, pausing to quickly kiss Tony on the cheek as she walks by. This seems to jar Tony out of his thoughts and he turns to Steve.
“You looks so good Tony, I’m going to hold your legs open like this just a little longer okay? I want you to get nice and slick for me.”
Tony quietly groans and buries his nose into Steve’s neck, breathing him in. “Please mom, five more minutes.”
This chapter is just a heads-up to anyone who wants to follow the series. I'll also happily take suggestions in the comments :)
He turns to Tony, “Tony, since Rhodes is your friend first, I think you should take the lead. I mean… maybe I don’t even need to be on camera?”
Steve notices for the first time a small moving tree next to Thor, and an even smaller racoon. The racoon rests a small hand on Thor's knee as he lets the hammer-axe fall loose in his grip.
So when they come to a stop Tony lets go right away; he does the right thing. There’s no lingering embrace or dip of his fingers under Steve’s t-shirt as he slides away.
Bruce looks at Tony and starts ticking things off on his fingers. “Not as much grey hair, leaner, more muscle mass, more youthful skin, fewer wrinkles… I just thought he was dying his hair, working out more, maybe botox…”
Shit. All of it is from Sam. So it’s probably not anything connected to the team's well-being, otherwise Natasha or Clint would have contacted him.
By the time they’ve been back in their routine for a couple of months, Steve has a new sense of calm about him. Tony is happy and (in part thanks to Steve) incredibly healthy. And while Tony sometimes rants mindlessly in the heat of the moment when he’s about to come about how much he needs Steve’s dick, or how hot it is that Steve’s is a part of his DNA, Steve thinks they’ve basically moved forward.
Steve expects to swallow the length again, but Tony keeps it shallow, just resting the head inside the tight seal of Steve’s lips like some obscene lollipop.
Tony leads the way inside and turns, making a flourishing movement with his arms illustrating the bed in all its glory, and starts rambling on about the details of the construction and how they used this rare material and that. It really is something. It’s huge, and looks so comfortable Steve actually forgets to feel conflicted for a moment because he’s so excited to lay down and see how it feels.
Steve can’t stand it. He can’t stand any more of this. Side-stepping everything with a smile. He sits up and folds his legs in front of him, scooting so about two feet remains between them on the sand.
Tony groans around Steve’s errection and lifts off. He continues to stroke Steve as he tells Friday, “No video Fri, just put the call through.”
“Well, good to know. We are certainly looking forward to that security report, Scott.” says Tony with a smile and a wink.
Steve is back to his deer in headlights look. He doesn't understand what Tony is asking. What he's looking for. Why does he want Tony? That's like asking why he wants to eat when he's hungry. Or sleep when he's tired.
He works quickly to coat his index finger and joins Steve on his platform. Steve shifts to make room, still presenting his ass.
, I was just trying to illustrate that while our personal relationship may impact the team, I don’t think it’s an
It’s not that Tony hasn’t taken the time to reflect on Siberia, the accords, everything. He’s done more than think about it, he’s taken it apart and put it back together. Dissected it, run the whole thing through B.A.R.F. more times than he wants to count.
Tony and Steve are in the middle of “post-mission we’re alive” sex when Bruce calls. It’s Tony’s third-favorite kind of Steve sex, after Shower Sex and Steve-Takes-Control Sex… more often than not they have Steve drive things since he’s still pretty skittish that he might hurt Tony accidentally. He’s never come close, and Tony assures him there’s no need to be so concerned, but Steve persists. Tony has been toying around with fucking Steve in the armor, that way Steve can let go and the strength differential would be more even…
They said the serum made him perfect. They didn’t say that it wouldn’t matter how perfect he was when everything else is so… He can’t seem to get it right. No matter what he does he can’t seem to do this…
As Scott sets the cake on the table, he says, “I call the lips!” Then he blushes. Then he says “Kidding! Haha, I mean, I actually like the corner pieces… just a stupid joke, uh, who wants cake?”
It doesn’t feel as weird as it used to. Before Iron Man, trying to do the right thing was like having a monkey strapped to his back. It was always someone else pulling him in the opposite direction. Pepper wanted him to attend a charity gala, Obie needed him to get those new designs in or the company wouldn’t be giving out Christmas bonuses. Rhodey tried to convince him not to fly to Tijuana on Cinco de Mayo with a bunch of strippers who were just as drunk as he was… well, maybe he didn’t do the “right” thing on that one.
It was easier than he thought it would be. He kept his hands to himself the whole day, and only said about five things that could be considered flirting… and if he caught himself making moon eyes at Steve as he chased down a balloon that got away from a little girl, or had indecent thoughts as he watched Steve suck away at his lion cup, well, that’s what the extra layer of dark tint on his Oliver Peoples sunglasses is for.
“I know now isn’t a good time, and I’m not asking for you to be ready to deal with it, but I have to ask… Why did you invite me here? Did you want to go to Hawaii with me because you want to relax and see hula girls, or because you
“It’s not my fault “CAP PAC” was the most marketable name! That was picked by a focus group, not me!” Tony’s mouth does the little twitch it does when he’s lying. Steve has to kiss it. He does it without thinking, just a quick peck at the corner. When Steve remembers he’s on camera he quickly pulls away, blushing slightly as he looks up to see if Rhodey has any reaction.
Does Steve really think he’s that out of control, like some sort of rabid animal? It’s… he knows he messed up with Japan. He knew when he was doing it he was messing up, that was the point. He wanted to just take some time away and just forget for a while; come to find out Steve was tracking his every move anyway… stupid instant internet. Stupid accommodating Japanese.
In the weeks they’ve been apart Steve has been actively trying to hone his control while he’s worked up. He’d get himself right to the edge of orgasm, and then force himself to stop, and do something that takes a delicate hand. Sew a patch onto one of his socks, draw a small still life. After many broken pencils and pricked fingers, he feels more confident controlling himself around Tony in this state.
“That’s right” Tony smiles. “You have to follow the Order of Operations or the whole equation falls apart. Now, can you get naked for me?"
Tony feels that sharp feeling flare up again. “Pepper, honestly I thought it was pretty common knowledge that I’m bi? It’s on my Wikipedia page! I wasn’t going to like, check guys out in front of you, okay? And what even does that have to do… I’m not really sure why my sexuality is suddenly on trial?”
“Sometimes… I want to dig into Strange about the multiverse. The other realities. 53,000 out of 14 million… those odds nag at me. I think about how there must be so many Steves out there that never came to the tower that night, so many Avengers that couldn’t prevent the snap.”
“There is a laundry chute in the corner that Sir uses regularly which goes directly into an automated washer, and extra shirts in the bottom drawer to your right Captain.”
Steve is actively sobbing in pleasure now. It’s so beautiful, Tony can’t contain his own moan as he pistons his tongue hard in and out of Steve. If they had more time he would love to go slow, tease him, savor the taste and feel of him. But that’s not what Steve needs now.
“Uh huh, speaking of arm-centric inventions, if you’re such a great engineer, where were you when the gauntlet was being made in Wakanda? You know, the thing
“Next I’m going to probe the procedure-area with my fingers. It will be very similar to a prostate exam. I see from your chart you’ve done those before.”
Under Strange’s recommendation, Vision is immediately brought to Wakanda's science division to get the stone removed. Shuri and Tony have an emergency science jam session. Together they ensure Vision is fully functional without the stone, and Tony creates a new gauntlet to hold the stones. Suri has some pretty incredible suggestions that should divert a decent amount of the harmful power of the stones from the wearer, and Nebula shows Tony a type of cold fusion welding he’s never seen before.
He can hear Steve move around him, to remove the dildo and roll the chair out of the way. Tony groans as it slides out.
Tony can’t focus on what Steve is saying. Partially because he is still in his lap, and wow, yep, this universe can suck it if the only time he is ever in this position is to hear about Steve’s girlfriend. He catches the essentials: Name: Becky, smart, fun, makes Steve happy…
Tony looks down and sees that Steve is wearing what must be the navy swimsuit from the guest room’s dresser (which, dear god, is more like a pair of navy, water-resistant boxer briefs they are so tight!). He takes a moment to ogle and smirk because of course his guests’ swimsuits would need to be more revealing than his own traditionally cut red trunks, before getting to Steve’s feet, and seeing…
Tony turns back to Bruce for an explanation, and is startled to see him tinged with green. He looks like he’s barely holding it together.
“Hmm, it’s been a while since I gave you a hand-job. There always seems to be so much else to do… but this is nice, I get to really watch you.”
Luckily he has substantially less expensive and valuable loungewear available for Steve to rub himself off on right here.
They kiss and stumble together through the living room, on to the bedroom. Groping and laughing along the way, giddy with the knowledge they no longer have to hide. Steve realizes with a start that he can sleep here tonight in the suite, with Tony, if that’s what Tony wants.
Steve moves over to the small counter with the sink and slowly puts on a pair of blue latex gloves. Next to the box of gloves on the counter is a large tube of medical lube, and series of dildos that range in size. Steve examines them for a long moment and then brings one over to Tony to see.
Tony makes a strangled noise. “Fine! But you’ll regret it when we are starting round three and Vision pops his head through the wall to ask what’s for dinner!”
Tony invites Shuri and Nebula to the compound for that sleepover. They do science, and eat ice cream and wear avocado honey face masks (Nebula – “Terran customs are disgusting”). They snuggle in to watch a movie (Tony picked Clueless, thinking it might help both Shuri – who grew up in Wakanda, and Nebula – who grew up being tortured by a megalomaniac, familiarize themselves with some basic  American Earth culture. Plus the guy that plays Josh looks
Tony’s look shifts from blank shock to something akin to being star-struck as Steve talks. And suddenly Steve panics because there is still so much to say, and Tony is edging toward him.
Steve leans down to kiss Tony now, trying to communicate what he’s feeling. He wants to protect Tony from ever losing anyone ever again, even though that’s impossible. He wants to tell him that he understands, that’s he’s not alone.
Steve motions for Tony to come sit by him. The view-screen follows him, settling in front of them so they are both on-screen with Rhodes.
Steve feels himself jerk, totally independent of any conscious movement and out of control. He gives in and focuses in on what can only be described as a whimper coming from the bathroom. Tony is in there, thinking about him… Steve knows that much should be obvious, but the mental image and the sounds that accompany it are too much.
He is about to set up his towel when he sees Steve emerge onto the deck and take the stairs down to the beach. He’s smiling but it looks kind of strained as he hurries out on to the beach towards Tony’s location.
After giving the same treatment to his other hand, he presses it to the mattress on Tony’s other side.
- More Steve/Tony family stuff, including "Steve is nervous to hold baby Morgan, and how he overcomes his fear of his super strength to hold her" (thanks to PerplexinglyParadoxialPerson for the prompt!)
Steve’s face crumples, and he nods reluctantly. Bruce is right, he really should be thinking about Becky right now too…
“Hmm, I think the split may be 60/40? Or… oh I know,” says Tony. “Friday, over the last eight months, on average how often have Steve and I had sex? And what’s the breakdown for who is top vs bottom?”
By the end of Morgan’s first year of life, Steve is feeling the pangs of being away from her and Tony so often. After Thanos Clint left the team and Scott went down to occasional/part time participation, with the caveat that if another Thanos-level event happens they’ll be there. Steve doesn’t want to leave the team without a leader, but he longs to follow their lead and spend more than two days in a row out at the lake house with his family.
Sam and Steve are just finishing their run in Central Park when it happens. Tony is there in workout clothes too, his nano chest attachment gleaming in the sun. Rather than join the run, he’s been sitting on a bench in partial shade eating an ice cream cone typing on a Stark Pad, glancing up as they pass by to appreciate Steve’s form.
“Steve. Stevie. Stevia, my sweet, precious all-American beefcake… you are literal physical perfection. You have sexual tension with a tea kettle. But no, I have actually never gotten any signals from you that you were in any way interested. Ever. Which makes me feel like this” Tony makes the same motion between the two of them that Steve just did, “this 'you on your knees offering to felatiate me'-thing, is coming from a bit out of left field. Which is why I’m
Steve smiles because Tony can’t see it from where he’s fallen back on the table. Tony looks amazing, ass exposed, legs spread wide. Steve sets each of Tony’s heels in the metal and plastic holders and presses his knees apart. They have naturally migrated together, Tony instinctively trying to cover himself, protect such an exposed area.
Tony doesn’t want to have to jump into the long talk he knows they need to have… and it turns out he has the perfect distraction. Steve is hard again, or… still hard? Pressed up against Tony’s stomach.
Tony interrupts, “Pep, I’m going to stop you right there.” This time Tony has had some time to gather his thoughts; he's ready. He's not sure if Pepper is ready to
Tony continues without pause. “I want everything from you Steve, all of you, I want to take you in ways you’ve never imagined, I want you to scream my name until your throat is horse, I want to bruise you, I want you to bruise me, I want to use you until your whole world narrows to just me, just us. Is that what you want, Steve?”
Steve clenches his fists where they rest on his thighs. He never talks about it. He didn’t think he would now, but it’s part of it he thinks.
“I could clean your lovely hard dick next. Run the cloth over it, massage your balls with some sweet soap and lick them clean. Take you in hand, then into my mouth…”
Tony is gone for about 10 seconds before Steve flips back the covers and palms himself, turning his head into the pillow to muffle a groan.
Rocket’s ears go flat at the mention of Jane. Tony can relate. They both brace for one of Thor’s many speeches where he either lists all of Jane’s best qualities, or describes at length why their break-up was mutual. Mercifully at that moment Steve enters the workshop.
It’s not something he ever did a lot actually. Back in the day his sexual experiences with men were primarily made up of quick blowjobs in the backs of clubs, or the occasional hook ups that tended to be him topping because… well, it just seemed the thing to do. He’d only ever let a couple of guys fuck him, people he thought actually might stick around. Both times he regretted it almost instantly because it turned out twenty-something Tony kind of went for assholes.
“Do we need any protection?” Steve asks, and guh that’s, that’s actually a really wholesome and responsible question. Steve really isn’t the sweet boy scout cliché the public thinks he is, except sometimes he
Tony’s area of the shower is now raised up more than Steve’s platform; from his keeling position Tony’s mouth is perfectly aligned with Steve’s ass. Steve is starting to understand the genius of this shower.
Last, he takes a quick tour of the personal spaces. It’s not super in his comfort-zone to spy on everyone, but needs to be thorough.
It’s not that Tony doesn’t know that Steve has never been to Hawaii before. It’s just… Steve is looking at everything like it might as well be Jurassic Park or something. It’s adorable. He feels a pang of regret for being the reason Steve didn’t get to see Japan other than the hotel and hospital.
By and large the group pays no attention, occasionally poking gentle fun at them. Steve brings up “Interpersonal Relationships” as part of the agenda at the next Avengers team meeting. Nobody has much to say after he assures everyone that he and Tony have talked about it, and that their relationship will stay separate from Avengers business.
Steve begins to move, “No time now, Tony, Bruce, Strange, come with me. Sam, get in the air and report back what you see, help any civilians as you can. Wong, can you stay here and standby? If possible, we’ll want to use those rings to get more of the team on the ground once we know what we’re dealing with.”
Tony drops the screaming girl into her mother’s arms and watches helplessly as Steve goes flying hundreds of feet in the air in the opposite direction.
He hears Tony huff an almost-laugh and shut the door. Steve’s face heats up as he tries to figure out what Tony must think… he strips the shirt off and turns it inside- out before tucking it slightly under his side of the bed which is out of Tony’s view unless he comes around Steve’s side.
He didn’t need more than a few hours of sleep at a time after the serum, but he found if there wasn’t a dire reason to get up, he could easily sleep ten hours straight through. It helped. Sleep was always a respite, a way to recharge and refocus.
okay?" he asks. "I hurt you so badly Tony… physically and... you said, you said you had a concussion, and the shield hurt your ribs?” Steve nuzzles into his chest apologetically.
He looks at the tiny golden tubes of lube in his hands. Tony gave him about ten. He’s not sure if that’s what he’s supposed to use or if it’s wishful thinking on Tony’s part. He’s pretty sure Tony used two on him. He takes a few and puts them on the bed where they will be easily accessible, then takes a few more and puts them on the nightstand. The last ones go under the pillow Steve figures isn’t Tony's, and is therefore his. There, strategically-placed lube.
The suite has a little entryway, then a long, curved living area and bar similar to the one in the tower penthouse. There are two doors off of that at the far end, one for the bathroom and one for the bedroom. Steve doesn’t even bother to locate Tony, sure he must be either in the bedroom or in the portion of the living area that’s just out of view.
The problem is that he can’t remember the last time he laughed with Tony, and it’s killing him. So Steve starts writing Tony again.
Steve has never heard Natasha laugh. She looks up at Tony and, well, it’s not a squeal. Natasha doesn’t squeal, but she makes a… noise, and says “Her tongue is warm!”
He steps out and hovers just inside the room. He realizes he’s never actually been up here. Even when he lived in the tower, he only spent time in his suite and on the communal floors. The Penthouse always felt like Tony and Pepper’s private space.
“Long story short, here’s what I want: I want to clean up in here on my own to make sure I’m good to go, then I want to meet you in the bedroom and let you have your way with me. I want to help you however you need, if you need instruction or direction, I’m there. But then, then I need you to open me up and take my body like you own it. I want you to own me, Steve.”
Steve smiles at Thor and Rocket. He has a soft spot for Rocket in particular, something about relating to him as “the little guy.”
“Hey, hey, no nothing is ruined. It’s the opposite Steve.” He squeezes the muscles under his hands, trying to pry out the tension that’s amassed there. Hmm he should send Steve to his masseuse. Or maybe this is just how Steve’s shoulders are? So much muscle… Right, focus. “Look, I’m not going to pretend everything is solved. There’s gonna be a lot of work moving forward, as a team, and for you and me.”
Once he’s got a decent amount on his fingers and deposited onto Tony’s puckered entrance, he tests out dipping a fingertip. It slides in easier than he thought. He moves it in and out, mesmerized that he’s actually doing this. Tony has started babbling; it’s just a string of words that are incredibly graphic and increasingly nonsensical.
Steve is so relieved he shifts suddenly to embrace Tony, which results in Tony’s soft cock sliding out of him... along with what feels like an ungodly amount of fluid. It flows down Steve's legs and onto the bed.
He can’t stand to move Tony fully off his length anymore, he’s just taking him up a couple inches and right back down, creating a fast, shallow ride for them both, rutting hard against’s Tony’s prostate as Tony speeds up his hand on his own cock.
Thor relinquishes the rule/establishment of New Asgard to Valkyrie, and joins the Guardians of the Galaxy.
Steve goes to town. The table is endlessly useful, keeping Tony open and exposed and at the exact right level. Steve loses track of how long he thrusts his tongue into Tony, but finally Tony is fully hard again and is crying out with every stroke.
“Yes, Tony?” Steve reaches out and slings an arm around Tony’s torso. He’s already drifting off but he wants to hear what Tony has to say.
Wanda says “Is Star Wars the one with the light-swords and the big bear with the belt on his chest?”
He built an arc reactor in a cave in the middle of the desert. He flew a nuke into a hole in the universe. But Captain America is an impossibility, and he knows it.
Steve settles over him, resting as much of his weight onto Tony as he thinks he can take. Tony’s softened cock is still inside him. It feels incredibly intimate.
Tony watches as Steve strips down, quickly and without fanfare. Hmm, maybe they can work on that later. Though there is something to be said about efficiency. They probably have a lot to work on… Steve is eager as they come, but he's also literally begging to be told what to do.
In the morning when Tony goes into the bathroom to brush his teeth, JARVIS quietly addresses Steve with the utmost discretion in his voice:
Tony’s hips jerk involuntarily. If Steve wasn’t who he is, it might have been strong enough to buck him off. As it is, it just reminds him that while Tony isn’t a super soldier, he’s strong. He’s got great muscle tone from years of both piloting and shaping the armor. Steve gives Tony one more firm pump before leaning over to the side table to grab some lube.
“So, what did you think of rimming? Kind of ended up being a rush job there at the end, next time we’ll start there so you can really enjoy it.”
“Don’t worry about the details Scott, this is just something Tony does… honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if somehow Cassie’s college tuition is already paid for…”
And nobody has done this to Tony in twenty years which means… well Steve isn’t sure exactly what that means, but he can tell it’s something special.
Suddenly he knows he can’t in good conscience spend another day with Tony in the Penthouse. The team needs him.
Steve takes the opportunity to pull one of Tony’s fists to him. He looks at the knuckles, they’re red but not bad. He opens the hand, stiff from being clenched for so long. He rubs it and works firm pressure into the palms, then down each finger. He lays the hand down on the bed at Tony’s side and presses it into the mattress a little. A silent signal to keep it there. He picks up the other hand from where it rests against the headboard.
Steve’s face gets that’s soft look it gets only around Tony. “The more I think about it, this “treatment” is a gift. You're healthy, and aging slower. We’ll be able to grow old together.”
As Steve continues to pet Tony, his brain catches up to the events of the day. He recalls something else. Something Tony told Rhodey earlier.
The indicator light above the door signals that Steve has just pressed the button on the picture frame. Shit. Tony hastily removes his clothes and balls them up on the nearest chair, just like he would at an actual doctor’s appointment. He slips on the gown and only ties the strings at the top, leaving the back to drape open.
Dr. Strange nods, as if he’s already heard this speech before. And he probably has, in about 53,000 variations. “I may be able to mask the mind stone with a spell that will make it undetectable to Thanos, at least for a time.”
Scott doesn’t turn around, just raises a thumbs-up over his shoulder “Will do, sounds good. For sure. I’ll for sure do that. Thanks.”
Steve watches as Tony make his way down the outdoor staircase to the beach, registering as he goes that Tony is wearing swim shorts and has a beach towel in hand.
“Oh wait, I think I did see them.” says Steve. “Those are the ones with the little boy that races the pod-ships, and he grows up with be evil, and then loses his limbs on the volcano planet at the end, right?”
The shape and joints look realistic, but the face has slightly exaggerated features, with big eyes. To everyone’s surprise Natasha is the first to kneel down and pet her. The metal looks smooth, and seems to give very slightly under Natasha’s touch.
Tony softens at that, sitting up to wrap his arms around Steve. “But you have a Winter Soldier and Rogues to tend to.”
Tony steps off the platform and motions for Steve to get on in his place, and drops to his knees. His genius of a shower reads the motion and flips up a soft memory foam bathmat where his knees land. He’s not crazy about being back on his 40-something knees, but the look on Steve’s face is worth it.
Steve pauses, thinking for a moment if anything they’ve done has made him uncomfortable. “Actually, it’s kind of the opposite? Being on the other side of things, being “Dr. Steve" feels, it feels like I’m taking something back... Does that make sense?”
“Uh, let’s see,” Rhodes starts ticking things off on his fingers. “Snuck into the army after being rejected over and over, signed up for an untested serum, crashed a plane into the ocean, leader of the Howling Commandos, took no shit from Nick Fury, best friends with the Winter Soldier, took down SHIELD almost single-handedly, dating Tony Stark.” He pops the rest of his fingers up in a mock explosion as he says “And that’s just the shit I know about.”
Steve comes up for air from his latest bout with Tony to realize his phone has been in his pants this whole time, discarded by the elevator.
From inside the orb Scott is able to see that the button is connected to what looks like a mini explosive device. He disconnects the circuit and returns to normal size on the ground.
With that Tony nods and goes back inside to wait in his room. Steve’s going to need to shower before they go to get all the sand off from where it stuck all down his front from laying on the ground. While Steve showers and changes he orders chocolate Macadamia nuts to be served on the plane for the flight to L.A., and texts Pepper to see if she needs the second jet this week. It has two separate compartments with a private bedroom. Maybe he can manage to sleep the whole way back… or at least tell Steve he’s sleeping.
Steve blushes and gets slightly defensive. “No Tony, I obviously wouldn’t phrase it like that, but this affects the team so I think we should address it as a team… also what do you you mean break it?? You said you were okay, is your-“
He’s blushing, again. He’s never blushed so much in his whole life, even when he had to deal with those USO girls on tour.
He smiles his best smile and says: “She sounds like a hell of a girl, Cap.” He knows his eyes are bright, and he doesn’t care. He has to look at Steve in the eye and show him that he understands.
Instantly his mouth is full and he’s pressed against Tony’s warm, smooth leg. It’s euphoria. Steve has never been this desperate to come, not in any of the nights he’s woken up from his dreams, never.
“We’re ready to rock, sugarplum.” Nebula and Shuri trade another glance. "So, who is trying this thing on?" Tony asks.
It seems like seconds later that Steve hears the shower turn off. He comes back to himself and looks down at his chest to see that he has literally come all over his undershirt. He hears Tony’s movements in the bathroom as he starts to dry off and panics; it could not look more like he’s deliberately drenched himself in his own come. He already made it clear to Tony earlier that he didn’t want to go any further, so taking the shirt off doesn’t exactly send the right message… but leaving himself a mess isn’t an option either…
Tony explains as he runs his fingers through Steve’s hair to get rid of the last of the soap. “So that setting will ensure any water jets or streams hit us just right, no water up the nostrils or in our eyes while we move around… okay now let’s wash the rest of you.”
Steve shakes Tony’s shoulder a few minutes before landing; he doesn’t want the jostling of the plane hitting the tarmac to be what rips Tony from his peaceful slumber.
So when Steve and the rest of the lost boys (and girls) return home, Tony’s focus is split about 50/50, half of his attentions go to settling everyone in at the compound, making sure the team is bonding, and continuing to advocate for Bucky (who’s case wasn’t totally covered by the Accords II, which means he is still in limbo in Wakanda).
Sam and the others gather around him, assuring him that he should do whatever he thinks is right. He’s pretty surprised they’re taking it so well, until someone, Lang maybe, says:
Tony scoots up close to Steve, but stops a few inches away, resting his head on the pillow. His eyes are warm as he slowly, achingly slides the last few inches and places a kiss on the underside of Steve’s jaw.
Tony goes slack against him, losing himself in his narration. "Yeah Steve, just come, we both know you probably won’t even go soft. Come in me and keep fucking me, fill me with your come and come again, then plug me back up, make me keep it inside. Let me wear the plug again with everything you can give me, keep part of you while we eat dinner tonight with the team, plugged up and full of you, nobody will know, just for you…”
Steve takes Tony’s hands off the bed and slowly kisses every inch of them, holding them captive. He starts rocking his pelvis experimentally back and forth. He isn’t getting much leverage on Tony’s cock, more just moving with him, clenching down on him as he rocks them into the mattress.
Time becomes meaningless as he leans forward and takes Tony into his mouth, slowly working his way up and down the length, hands locked on the hammer. He gradually dips into what he’s termed “the floaty feeling” he often gets in these dreams.
Steve turns to kiss Tony again, how many can he get in before he has to leave, he wonders? “Better.”
He guides Steve to stand in front of the mini- platform facing the wall, and steps up onto it himself so he’s facing Steve. With the added six inches he’s slightly taller than Steve. Perfect.
He paces as he watches Steve on the floating viewscreen Friday’s thrown up for him. Steve’s head drops in resignation as the months-old password he tries at the entrance doesn’t work.
Tony methodically scrubs at Steve’s scalp with the mint and aloe shampoo. The shampoo and all the soaps in the shower are edible (even tasty!) and 100% biodegradable. Nothing is worse than having a great shower and getting the acrid tang of soap in your mouth, or the sting of chemicals in your eyes.
Tony lets go of Steve’s hair and massages the area for several seconds. “I’m so sorry Steve, I should have been more clear with you. I
He knows he needs to tell Pepper about Steve, but that will come once the team has settled in at the compound. Maybe in a month or two…
Bruce blinks, his cheeks dusted pink and he clears his throat. “Well, that is, I meant a sperm sample.”
After he takes a second to recover he realizes he's in trouble. This is going to take some strategy, because apparently getting gently slapped in the face by Tony’s cock is the hottest thing that’s ever happened to him, but he’s not allowed to rub himself off until he’s begged enough to get Tony’s cock in his mouth.
Tony is about to go off down memory lane to some of his less-than-sensitive moments around Rhodey (Stripper plane? Most of his 20s?) but sobers remembering why he called.
Steve slides back to his knees in front of him with impossible grace, and Tony takes a minute to just look at him.
“I’m worried Tony’s body may have come to rely on the micro-dose. For example, we aren’t sure what would happen if he went cold turkey. Would there be cell damage? Would his now highly-functioning immune system break down? Will the cells with the serum markers revert all at once causing years of aging in a very short time-frame? These are all unknowns.”
Tony moans as Steve swallows him down. He barely has the presence of mind to narrate all the kinky doctor fun he wants to have with Steve, but after holding back for so long it bursts out of him like a torrent.
Steve pets her and smiles, but instead of her usual happy grin a look of deep concentration forms on her face and she opens her mouth.
“The expander is holding you open and ready, but I also need to prep the medication.” Steve says as he unbuttons his khakis and unzips them. He isn’t wearing underwear. He keeps the pants on and takes his hard cock out letting it stand at attention while he opens the lube and pours some into his hand. He sets the tube down and moves slightly closer to Tony, about a foot away from his head and shoulders where they are leaning on the exam table.
if they ever saw each other, but Tony keeps taking business trips away from New York. When he is home he always seems to be working. Eventually he’s on better terms with Pepper, which Steve is happy about.
“Actually… I may… already have known. About the two of you.” Scott scrunches up his face like it physically pains him to say it.
Tony responds, “Now… there are three more days until the penthouse needs to be packed up and cleared out. And then, we part ways for a little while and move forward, together.”
“Sure Boss, over the last eight months you two have had sex within my observable range 369 times, an average of 1.57 times a day. Steve was the “top” 48.6 percent of the time, Tony was the “top” 31.9 percent of the time. The other 19.5 percent which resulted in orgasm were oral sex acts which were split fairly evenly for who received and who performed the oral stim-“
But if he’d known. If he’d known that he had even a one-in-one-billion chance with Steve he would never have done any of it. He knows he can be better.
Tony rubs the washcloth along Steve’s back, playing the hug off as a maneuver to clean him. He gets to the swell of his ass before moving back around to his front, skimming the soapy cloth over his abs.
Tony’s eyes are wide. “Yes, Steve. Anything.” He remembers thinking Steve telling him "anything" earlier in the shower was sweet and a sign of his inexperience. To tell anyone that in such a vulnerable moment... But here he is saying the same thing. He would. He would do anything.
Steve sighs and moves around the side of the building toward the nondescript foot-traffic entrance that was used exclusively by the Avengers when they couldn’t take a vehicle in or out of the tower.
Tony feels the tension release from Steve’s body as he works his way through his hair and reaches the base of his head.
He slides forward, allowing the majority of Tony’s length to slide out of him before sliding back in a single controlled movement.  Tony can’t do much with his hands pinned above him and Steve’s weight on top of him. He just has to lay back. Let Steve take care of him, like he said.
Bruce shakes his head. “I don’t understand how this could happen. The similarities in your blood to the super soldier serum almost look like you’re getting micro-doses of the serum? Your DNA is almost the same as your old sample, 90-something percent I’d guess without further analysis. But these markers,” he points to the little flags on the sample, “they definitely point to a fundamental change in your blood, your DNA.”
He takes a deep breath, “Friday, record and observe but don’t chime in or interfere. If I need assistance or want a blackout, the usual voice commands are active.”
Tony isn’t wild about using physical force this way, not when Steve is obviously panicked, but he needs him to listen. It has the intended effect at least. Steve quiets and slumps against the wall, attention on Tony.
Steve burns at the thought of Tony inserting various toys inside himself, pretending they're him. Thinking of Steve while he pleasures himself, while Steve has been doing the same, thinking of Tony.
He feels like a bucket of ice water has been poured over him as he realized what it is. Oh god, he’s so selfish.
Steve is talking with their driver about learning to surf, and Tony is finally starting to feel like he can relax. Well, he actually started to feel that way on the plane, but then, he slept for eight hours.
There. He focuses on touching Tony on that precious spot but with no predictability, hitting it several times in a row then backing off, hitting it again, then avoiding it.
Tony can’t move fast enough, wiggling up to rest his head on the pillow, still keeping his knuckles on the headboard, arms now bent at ninety degree angles.
Tony retracts the helmet and kisses him, hard. There’s no finesse, it’s not even a kiss so much as a violent press of his lips on Steves, assurance that he’s here. He’s alive.
That bit about the hula girls. Maybe he really does want to go relax and take in a good time with some random dame. Steve could be completely off base. He has been before.
Tony added the “training safe word” at the last minute just this morning, mainly for Peter. Today is his first time interacting with the team (except for Germany of course). Tony wants to be sure he (and anyone else) can stop whatever will be attacking them if needed.
Tony is breathing hard now, hands on both of Steve’s shoulders. Steve isn’t much better, he's catching his breath in a way he hasn’t needed to in he doesn't know how long. Physical activity doesn’t usually wind him, but this…
Tony let’s out a strangled moan and manages to say “Yess” as Steve begins to thrust faster and faster. Tony is still pinned in place, but he squeezes as tight as he can every time Steve impales him, moaning low over and over. He can tell it’s affecting Steve because his iron control is slipping. His movements become erratic and his thrusts shallow.
“Tony, what?” Steve clearly hasn’t connected the dots, and is looking increasingly desperate, side-eyeing his t-shirt crumpled on the ground next to the elevator.
Tony immediately rolls his eyes. “A meeting, really? You want to sit around the conference room table and tell everyone you just rode my dick practically hard enough to break it off?”
Bruce sighs. “I don’t know, I’ll need to do more tests. His blood sample isn’t the same as yours Steve, or mine, which has similar markers due to my experimentation which resulted in The Hulk. His sample is somewhere in the middle. In fact it is more like Sam’s than yours, but there are definite changes. And those changes look a lot like the serum.”
