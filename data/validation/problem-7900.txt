‘Wow I got told stories about the Boogeyman and werewolves. I think I prefer your monsters, they look so much cooler. Can you actually create ice if you’re a Frost Giant?’
‘I was intending to save this for a bit, had a whole plan to take you out for dinner and spoil you before doing this, and I didn’t want to take away from Wanda and Vision but…I can’t really wait much longer so…’ he goes down on one knee in front of the bed and sees Tony’s eyes widen and the genius sit up straighter.
‘Does he ever stop?’ Scott asks Tony, getting a laugh from the three men as Peter goes bright red and mumbles an apology.
‘Sorry,’ she says eventually as they wander along one of the paths, ‘you’re probably not that interested in all this are you?’ She laughs. ‘Thank you for taking me, Vis, it was wonderful. Did you enjoy it?’
‘Wow you know who I am?’
‘Of course,’ the trickster grins. ‘And I can multiply myself to create more confusion.’
‘Questions for another time perhaps?’ Loki suggests. ‘Shouldn’t we focus on making sure the Hulk does not cause any damage? And making sure the children are safe?’
And as always here's your sneak peek:
And so it continues, as the light from the small windows at the top of their walls gradually fades, and the odd star is all they can see.
‘Oops, sorry Parker, didn’t see you there,’ Flash’s mocking voice makes him groan. ‘I expected you to be carrying a tray of coffees for your superhero bosses. I mean that
Peter growls and, throwing caution to the wind, vaults up the side of the building onto the roof. He arrives to see the mercenary pacing backwards and forwards muttering to himself, and running his hands over his head. Frustration taking over Peter lets a web fly and drags the merc towards him.
Bucky nods. ‘Yeah the guy’s a nutcase. I was put up against him a couple of times in my later missions; bastard made me muck up quite a few as well. He’s a damn good fighter, though he never shuts up.’
‘Mr Stark! Mr Stark, how are you feeling about the start of the trial?’
‘I can’t see him, Cap, and he’s not answering his comms,’ Rhodes’ answer is filled with dread. ‘How’s Pete?’
‘Don’t avoid the fucking question.’
‘Of course, sir, you are generous to a fault with our allies,’ the assistant finishes writing. ‘Will that be all sir?’
‘Wow,’ Tony breathes, ‘now
‘We’ll make sure we take care of him, Wilson,’ Fury reassures them.
‘I thank you for your support of my brother, Tony,’ Thor says, smile big.
‘Arguable two of the most dangerous ones by themselves,’ Thor muses.
‘Maybe we should have a few more team parties,’ Steve muses, seeing how happy they all look. ‘Add a couple of our closer circle to it next time rather than half of New York.’
What I did want to ask all of you is: what would you like me to do next instead? I’m going to put a list of the ideas below and you guys comment and let me know what you’d like to see. Or comment with any requests, I’m always happy to try doing requests for side projects.
,’ he shoots him a grin, ‘is that I’m accompanied by armed guards until being handed over to the team. We then have two months to try and cure me of this brain washing. If not then Secretary Ross believes he is taking me into custody.’
‘We won!’ he shouts, pulling Wade into a hug and laughing as the mercenary spins him around.
A/N: Hi everyone! that's all the Yule chapters done, and I'm about halfway through the Christmas Eve ones. As soon as I've finished I'll post them too, hopefully I'll be able to get them all done for a Christmas Day posting but no promises.
‘You’re creeping me out, lady, who are you?’
‘Can we get him to come back every time Wanda gets like this?’ Vision asks, phasing through the wall as he leaves the room.
‘I made it for her,’ is Tony’s quiet reply.
‘The stones have gone to different people,’ Strange says, looking out over the battlefield, where apparently the majority of the team have now been thrown. ‘If we can collect the stones together we can harness their power like Thanos intended to and end this.’
As always here's your sneak peek at the next chapter:
‘I shall be overseeing this duel,’ a female Jotun steps forwards. ‘My word during this duel is law and you shall do as I command to ensure this fight is fair. Is that agreed?’
Steve chuckles. ‘I think Natasha’s doing a good enough job with her glare if the speed that Wade’s hands have gone back up is any indication.’
‘Not me,’ Bruce says, hopping up next to them, ‘I do not need Hulk making another reappearance. Good thing Cassie managed to go home to her mom though, right? Can you imagine any of this lot trying to cope with a kid here in the morning?’
‘What happened?’ Sam asks as they head towards the common area.
As always please do let me know what you think of this chapter.
‘Part of me really wants to knock you out right now you bastard,’ Bucky says, and Tony can’t help the grin that breaks out. ‘But everything considered, I might hug you instead.’
‘Merry Christmas, Pete’ his pillow rumbles and Tony lifts a hand to wave.
‘Well I suppose that’s one way to keep the creeps away,’ Wanda laughs.
‘Pete please tell me you’ve not got mixed up with him,’ there’s genuine concern in Bucky’s eyes.
Peter pulls up a sleeve to reveal the concealed suit underneath his clothing. ‘My mask is still in my bag though.’
‘Nah,’ he grins at her, ‘it’s much more fun to wind him up.’
‘Seen anything interesting?’ Natasha asks him.
‘What do you mean?’ Natasha asks.
‘And you think I don’t worry about you?’
Thor and Valkyrie would travel to replace Mjolnir once Loki was healed enough to help transport them, the trickster would remain with them, the Space Stone still in his possession, to continue to heal and lead the remaining Asgardians; Bruce, Tony and Loki were all going to study the Mind Stone with Vision in an attempt to see if they could understand the stones better and how they might be combated, T’Challa had offered to send Shuri to help, and to open her lab to them. Strange is taking the time to set up a permanent portal between the facility and the Sanctum, and one between the Sanctum and Wakanda so they can move between the locations much quicker; he’d only agreed to do it if the Sanctum was the focal point as it was easier to ensure unwanted visitors stayed out.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘No problem,’ she replies, grinning at Natasha.
‘We wouldn’t be a team if I hadn’t got you all back!’ Tony screams at him. ‘We were the ones to tear the team apart in the first place, Steve. But I was the only one of the two of us who actively tried to get us all back together. So don’t you
would be joining us for Christmas?’
Natasha smirks. ‘While the rest of you were doing such a fine job of keep him distracted, Tony managed to get a message through without Hammer realising.’ She holds up her piece of paper, with the hastily translated Morse code. ‘He was tapping on the reactor. Morse code. It’s one of the addresses Peter got from Daredevil.’
‘Six minutes to fireworks, boys,’ she replies, ‘I hope you’ve got that engine running.’
‘Hey Tony!’ Peter says, jumping over the top of the sofa and landing next to him, his energy is certainly returning quicker now that he’s getting some sleep. ‘What you up to?’
‘Our own sensors confirm this, my king,’ one of T’Challa’s guards arrives behind them.
‘No,’ she whimpers, half falling and half walking across the cell. ‘Bucky, please, speak to me.’
‘No!’
‘He’s the reason we’re alive,’ the scientist explains, ‘please, we need to help him. If for no other reason than he knows our enemy better than any of us.’
‘There is only one thing I require from you,’ a fourth Jotun steps through from behind the three of them, this one is a little taller and more thickset than the others, but there seems to be something familiar to some of his features. ‘And that is to claim what is rightfully mine.’
‘Nat?’ he croaks.
‘Vision went to help Strange and Wong,’ she tells them.
‘You can say that again,’ his friend laughs, ‘I’m still getting used to everything not being boiled.’ Then he turns to the mercenary with them. ‘You invited anyone to Yule, Wade?’
‘An hour?’ Tony can picture Peter’s pout. ‘I don’t think Wanda’s going to be that patient.’
There is one part of her training that not many of the others know about that has to be her favourite part of her regime. She has weekly ballet lessons with Natasha.
‘Look I’m just going to go while I still have all my limbs intact,’ Deadpool says, backing towards the door.
Peter sees Tony give the man one of his calculating looks at the choice of words, but he doesn’t say anything; instead he gestures for the man to follow them into the facility. ‘Come on then let’s get this over with. Something tells me it ain’t going to be pretty.’
A/N: Hi everyone. I hope you've all stopped panicking now after last week's sneak peek that I think had people convinced Peter was going to end up dead. Sorry I know that was mean of me to choose that bit as the peek. I've got a double update this week, so head on over to the next chapter for Peter's birthday party.
Tony raises an eyebrow at Vision. ‘Mind giving a guy a little privacy?’
Steve turns bright red and throws a pillow at his friend, scowling at Tony when he joins in the laughter.
‘Of course it is, young miss,’ JARVIS responds, ‘it is
‘I take it we were,’ Steve shrugs.
‘Wanda? Remember what you told me before you left,’ Tony sends one last message before Bucky has to break the part of the link that enables him to see through Loki’s eyes.
‘What time is it starting?’ Steve asks, standing up from his chair.
forgiven you?’
. Not to mention we need the public to see me out and about like normal; they all seem to think I’ve died.’
‘Rhodey, please,’ he looks at his friend, ‘I don’t have the breath to argue. So you’re all going to shut up and listen for once. Alright?’ He waits for everyone to nod, and nods in answer to Peter’s quiet request to go and stand with Wade, Steve taking his vacated seat; when he’s caught his breath again he starts speaking, looking around the assembled group. ‘Look,’ Tony sighs, ‘Loki’s right. Whether we want to be working with everyone or not, we’ve not got much of a choice; at the end of the day we’ve got the biggest bad we’ve ever faced on his way here and we’ve got to find a way to work together or half the universe is going to suffer. If saving the universe means learning to work with former enemies then fine I’ll do it. Hell if I thought it’d make a difference I’d get Hammer out of his cell and up here.’
Scott shakes his head, wincing as the motion pulls at some of his injuries. ‘Couldn’t see. Everything was getting a little blurry anyway, and the guy was backlit from some headlights so I couldn’t make out much. He asks me to pass on a message to you though,’ he says looking up at Tony. ‘He says: “Tell Anthony, that Justin wants to get back in business with him again.” Then he takes the other guys and walks off leaving me in the alley.’
‘Nat?’
‘Just got to finish Scott’s and then do Hope’s and I think I’m done.’
He sees the soldier pause and look towards the door. ‘Tony maybe it would be better if you wait for one of the doctors-’
‘Thanks, J, and thanks for helping with the story.’
‘If only that were true,’ Rhodes says coming over to stand next to him, ‘I wouldn’t have to fork out so much money on headache pills.’
‘Miss Romanoff?’ MJ addresses the super-spy apparently not intimidated one bit. ‘Is there any chance Peter can do the internship next weekend? We were planning to do something with the Decathlon team tomorrow as it’s the only weekend everyone can do for over a month.’
Matt laughs. ‘No I really am blind, but my other senses make up for the shortfall.’
Please do let me know what you think of this chapter as always. I like hearing what people think works and what doesn't as it quite often changes what I do in future chapters and stories.
‘Go, I’m fine.’
‘And that’s it? No fight from Ross?’ Sam asks suspiciously.
‘You just lay back for a minute, babe,’ Tony says, letting the soldier sit up enough for him to pull the shirt off of him, throwing it behind him to land on the floor. ‘I need to start learning what drives you crazy.’
‘Oh, but Wade,’ Francis reappears further ahead, ‘I think you’ll have so much more fun fighting someone you love rather than hate.’
It turns out Peter is a good source of information and suggestions, and when they’d told him what they needed his help on he’d been so enthusiastic that Wanda had given up trying to write everything down and Tony had to ask FRIDAY to make notes for them. Granted not all of his ideas were gold, but his suggestion that they try and do school visits has Tony’s mind racing with possibilities.
‘Spiderman is better off where he is, protecting the people of New York,’ Tony tries to keep his voice even, he really does. ‘And as for Strange, he prefers sitting in his own private Hogwarts having nothing to do with us. Something to do with his own ‘duty’ to perform. And
As she lets the flash drive finish saving all of the computer’s files she turns to the shelves, doing a quick scan of the files and books to see if there’s anything worth taking.
She shrugs. ‘You’re fine underwater in the suit, so I didn’t see it affecting you in the field. Still kept an eye on you just in case.’
Tony shrugs again. ‘Many have tried all have failed. But you want to take an Avenger, Ross? You better be prepared to go through the whole goddamn team. And you’ll start with me.’
Natasha nods. ‘Still wish we could have his tech. Should we call anyone else in?’
‘Wait, Tony was
-You don’t really want to do this do you?- Bucky challenges.
‘I do, although I only really have Lorena’s word for that.’
‘Apparently it’s one of FRIDAY’s programs Tony set up,’ he then explains what the AI had told him and part of what Tony had revealed to them last night. As promised he didn’t mention his conversation with Rhodes. Through it all Natasha listens without comment, her face unreadable.
‘No,’ Peter fights back tears as he continues along the street. ‘Can I ask a favour?’
‘FRIDAY pull up the kid’s latest voicemail to Happy would you?’ Tony says, leaning back on the sofa.
step backwards, you step
‘How did you guess?’ Bucky asks him, eyes narrowing suspiciously.
‘Alright, what do you want?’ she asks, a smile pulling at her lips as he sets the machine going.
Natasha bursts out laughing. ‘Alright I’m going to take this idiot away and leave you in peace.’
‘Have they been like this the whole time I was away?’ Peter groans.
‘I think I’ll cope without having to spend time with arrogant assholes who can’t get their tech right.’
Any further conversation is cut off by a rather irate looking Bucky Barnes.
worked to achieve Tony.’
‘If you are happy to do that,’ the king nods.
Peter’s face becomes determined. ‘Ned’s in there, Mr Stark. I’m not going anywhere till he’s safe.’
‘I’ll be back soon,’ he promises, and heads towards the elevator and his workshop.
Thank you so much everyone for reading, for leaving kudos and for leaving comments. It's been a tough month as my Dad's gone into hospital for surgery, so I've just about been keeping up with doing some writing. Reading the reviews has been absolutely amazing as I've been having them come through at tough times and they've put a smile on my face. He's out and doing well now, so I'm hoping to reply to all the comments between Christmas and New Year. Keep an eye out for your replies.
‘Peter,’ Tony’s voice cracks, ‘Spider-Man.’
He chuckles to himself, before closing his eyes and letting Steve’s warmth lull him to sleep.
‘Oh sod off,’ he grumbles as the other two laugh at him. ‘I’m just trying to be sensible looking out for our two youngest team members.’
‘Show off,’ they tell him in near-perfect unison. He just flashes a grin at them.
‘Either way did you see those two interacting after the presentation had been given? It’s so sweet! Just what a father and son relationship should be-’
‘Why do I feel like I’ve brought a child into this situation?’ he muses out loud. ‘Hey, man, let’s put that down yeah?’ He webs the third man’s hand to the table as he tries to pick up his friend’s discarded weapon, where it had fallen when Deadpool tackled him. ‘Someone might get hurt.’
‘Stands for: Very Evil Nemesis Of Mine.’
‘For the last time, Thor, you are

‘What about Wanda, then? She used to be our enemy didn’t she? She helped Ultron, does that she doesn’t deserve to be happy with Vision?’
your number one priority. Nat, Vis? I want you two downloading all the information you can from their computers. I’m expecting to have a lot of reading to do. Everyone else? Give them hell. Take out as many as you need to.’
‘Hey if you two get married can I be best man?’ Bucky’s voice comes across the ear pieces.
‘You do know that’s wasting energy right? Isn’t the world supposed to be cutting its carbon footprint?’
‘Sure thing, Mr Stark. Err… Mr Stark?’
The world is spinning so quickly Scott thinks it’s a miracle he isn’t sick. When he lands on the ground his suit automatically makes him normal size and he opens his helmet, taking gasping breaths as his chest protests from being winded where he landed. ‘Aww man that was not fun,’ he groans, trying to force himself not to be sick. ‘Hey guys? Everyone alright?’
every moment of the day, waking or sleeping. It’s fucking
Or maybe that’s his own goddamn guilt talking. Bucky doesn’t know. He’s too goddamn tired to keep track. His enhanced body might be able to stay awake and on his feet for days at a time, but there are some kinds of exhaustion that are beyond its abilities to cure.
“Understood.” It’s the longest fifteen minutes of her life as she jigs and zags across the sky, looping back around and keeping herself within range of the slower-moving convoy, staying out of sight above the clouds. Data flows across her HUD, a countdown ticking seconds away, the map overlay showing the dots slowly approaching the green triangle Coulson has marked for her intercept point.
Aaaand here you go. :)
Steve turns those eyes on him, sparkling and happy, and usually that's been enough to make him melt a little on the inside, but all it does now is ramp up the anxious dread, send it thrumming through his nerves and into his bones.
Bucky puts a hand out, rests it on Steve’s shoulder, freezes when he realizes it’s the cybernetic one, because Steve’s been kind of weird about it, about touches in general, for that matter, since he woke up in the isolation room. But Steve appears not to notice, until he sways towards Bucky, shifting in so they’re pressed together, shoulder to hip. Bucky’s arm slides automatically around Steve’s shoulders, and before he can stop himself and pull his arm back, Steve catches his wrist in a circle of fingers, holding him gently but firmly in place.
Toni raises an eyebrow questioningly, and Helen points upwards. Toni follows the line of the gesture, to where the observation area is recessed into the upper walls. Clint and Bucky and Steve are visible just over the rails on one side. Coulson and FitzSimmons are standing in the middle, with Carol, Rhodey and Pepper on the other side. “Great,” she says, though she tosses off a jaunty tip of her fingers as a wave. “If only Tash was there. I could get all my disappointed looks with over at once. Wait, why is Pepper here?”
He instead sits mute, thoughts in such chaotic churning it almost physically hurts him to try and straighten them out. His handler asks him for his mission report, and he gives it. Then rough hands push him back, and restraints snap over his arms, holding him still, steady, trapped, imprisoned. The chair is cold against his back, and his teeth find well-worn grooves in the old leather strap as his handler shoves it in his mouth.

else. “We can’t do this right now,” she mutters. “You need an arm, and Coulson has a meeting.”
“I know, I know.” She closes her eyes and regrets it immediately, because the world lurches to the right. She saves herself from falling only by flinging her hand out to catch the wall. Her ribs protest with a sharp twinge. She leans against the wall, faceplate pressing into the concrete, and concentrates on breathing through the waves of pain washing up her side. Her mind crunches the numbers, figures how long it would take Clint to fly her jet to Russia, how long it would take her to convince him to take one of her suits instead. Too long, too long. Where’s Rhodey? Afghanistan? Pakistan? Back home in the States? It’s been too long since she checked in with him. Not since War Machine had its last upgrades.
He knows it did. He
“You know what, go ahead and do that. Give him everything. Iron Maiden. Prototype tech specs. My goddamn iTunes purchase history. Everything. Full access to my entire life. And make it a Skynet protocol.”
I will
Logically, he knows it’s not Steve’s fault. Just like he logically knows that Toni’s physical state after Siberia isn’t his fault either. But see, logic isn’t playing in Bucky’s ballpark right now. Logic isn’t even on the game schedule. Logic is way down the line, in the bottom of the league. Right now, Rage is playing Self-Recrimination, and so far, score is tied.
“No, but you still hired me. Personal assistant, personal trainer. I’m not that hung up on my job title. What’s one word of difference?” He shoves her shoulder playfully, nudging her towards the mats again. “Get your ass in gear. You’ve still got thirty minutes to spend hitting the floor.”
on Clint’s face registers: smooth as stone, strange and distant. He jerks back, rises halfway out of his chair, suddenly certain something’s happened to Toni, because Clint wouldn’t look like that unless something is terribly wrong. “Clint, is Toni--”
Steve keeps an eye on the window as he does all the prep work, dropping the vegetables into the pot he left simmering on the stove earlier. He’s only ever done this once before, when he bonded with Bucky, but his mother made sure the recipe was ingrained in his head. She’d already been sick by then, determined to pass on a tradition she said went back generations, so when he met his soulmates, he could treat them accordingly.
As the days pass into weeks, he learns the rules of the Stark home and the quirks of these weird people he finds himself living with.

Everyone who would possibly text him lives with him, and they’re all home. If they wanted him, they’d just come get him, or ask JARVIS to relay a message.
“Malibu. Just me an’ you. Before…. everything.” She sighs, sinks into the pillows, closes her eyes. Barely notices Clint’s soft, choked cry. “Was good. Easier. Ever wanna?”
And he
It takes immense effort, but he does so. Toni’s blurry above him, bloodless-pale and terrified. “That’s it,” she says with a trembling smile, one hand holding his to her cheek, her other shoved tightly into their soulmark. His anchor. “Tell me about him, huh? C’mon. Tell me about Steve, Bucky.”
The sink goes on, a glass fills, and Clint drinks it all in a single pull. Natasha is silent, and so is Bucky, mostly because he wouldn’t know what to say even if they both walked out and saw him standing there right this second.
The picture draws slowly together, and Tony’s blood grows a little colder with every new piece they uncover, every new tidbit of information that gets placed in its appropriate spot. But when everything finally gets put together and the image resolves into a clear projection, none of them much like what they see.
Clint’s shoulders loosen as she continues stroking his neck, but the tension in his hands and voice do not go away. “I told her to wait,” he says, pained. “I fucking
“JARVIS?” he asks, without taking his eyes off the Avengers symbol.
“I’m instituting a new personal policy. From now on, I am never going to storm the ramparts of any dungeon that doesn’t have a valet, hot towel service and a full wet bar.” Toni squeezes her eyes closed and tries to sit up. Her arms don’t tremble as much as she’s afraid they would, but she’s panting and her forehead is beading with sweat by the time she gets only halfway up. “Ow, ow, fucking
accomplish it. There’s a reason she’s on the Index, Phil.”
Toni glances his way, smiles warmly and reaches up to free one ear from the tiny earbud she tucked into it. “What’s up, James?” she says, and the niggling, wiggling thing in his thoughts abruptly grows and slaps him in the face when he realizes she’s neither sweating nor winded, and they’ve been running awhile.
She’s cute when she’s indignant.
“But--”
“Understood, ma’am. Launching Marks II through VI now.”
“The building has limited camera access, but I am able to monitor approximately 60% of the remaining levels.”
for all I know, because she never talks about it, for nearly four months!”
Clint and Natasha share a significant look with unreadable expressions, and then Natasha rises from her chair. “I’ll get a quinjet ready for you,” she says, and slips past Bucky. As she passes, she rests her hand briefly on his shoulder, a reassuring gesture so quick it’s gone before he realizes she did it.
, but the real test is going to be when JARVIS comes back online. Will he be what she wants him to be? Will he grow into Skynet and take over everything? Can he pass the Turing test? Is he going to integrate with other systems, or is he going to be a glorified information bank? She doesn’t know, and it’s simultaneously thrilling and terrifying.
Bucky doesn’t think he’s fidgeted so much in his life. The three hours in the quinjet have been the longest three hours he’s ever spent. Full of nervous energy and unable to sit still, he’s lost track of the number of times he’s lapped the hold with restless pacing. His skin is itchy, humming, and while it’s not painful, it’s helping to tip him into edginess.
Hydra played him pretty masterfully, though he hates to admit it even to himself. Fennhoff was convincing in his carefully-worded, mild-voiced conversations, knew just what to say to seed doubt and confusion deeper. Manipulated Steve into trusting him, and Steve was too stupid to listen to every instinct that screamed about how wrong things were.
“And sentences,” Simmons says. “When most people hear ‘FitzSimmons’, they think we’re one person.”
Toni’s heels echo forlornly from the walls as she paces along the corridors of her childhood home. She idly runs the fingertips of her right hand along the wall, skipping over the portraits of her ancestors dead and buried, brushing lightly across the tops of tables, drifting them past knick-knacks her mother placed and Howard apparently never removed. She doesn’t even know what she’s doing here. She doesn’t know why Howard instructed his executor to make sure she was in New York for the funeral.
“Lay off the murder walk, Terminator,” Clint says, half behind him, half beside him. “They'll be fine.”
Some genius tactician he turned out to be. Maybe he should return the shield and hang up the tights.
Blood and bodies continue to fall in his wake. Holes appear in walls, sometimes with a body still hanging out of them. Picture frames fall from walls, vases pitch off pedestals and stands.
Fennhoff
She sinks down to her knees beside him, telegraphing her movements. He tenses, but holds himself still. Her palm slides over his shoulders, slow and careful, stroke broadly down his spine, smooth back up. It feels solid and real, like an anchor in a shitstorm, and he slowly relaxes.
“T’will be a glorious battle,” Thor says, and Tony can hear the determined smile in her tone. “Songs will be sung of the deeds done this day.”
Kobik shrieks, fear, pain, temper tantrum, he isn’t sure. Doesn’t care, either, as he streaks towards that single, barely-there point where all the lines connect. Where they’ve been tied to a frozen figure, anchored in the ice keeping Steve, the
Toni feels her breath slow, settle, steady, breathes in the rhythm he’s tracing on her spine. Breath in when his hand goes up, out when it goes down. The frantic hammering behind her eyes, the fist around her heart and lungs, eases. She drags in a shaky breath, closes her eyes, lets it out in a slow, slow sigh.
The red star is now nestled inside a blue circle, with the hollow white triangle inside its points. “Oh hell…” she says, staring at the complete soulmark. “That really fucking happened.”
"Job duties?"
He kisses her slow and lazy, and
“Fine,” Kate says.
She woke still howling in inconsolable grief and terror.
a chain of command.
“She’s my soulmate,” he says again, trying it out, testing the facts. He feels a little stupid with wonder.
But first, he thinks with a grimace as he scratches a sudden itch on his chest and paint catches in his nails, he needs to get a shower and scrub this stuff off.
That’s simply something he can’t let happen. Especially not after, when he inquires in friendly curiosity what made Tony come back to the Helicarrier, Tony tells him the nearly unbelievable story of his cellular systems having been combined and rewritten with Phoenix energy incorporated.
Toni’s quieter now, all good-natured squabbling gone.
He doesn't hesitate, just launches himself out of the chair and hovers midair, clothing shifting into his Phoenix armor, blue flames licking around his wrists and ankles. A moment before his head goes blessedly, blissfully silent, all the angry, grumbling thoughts shift to confusion or frustration or surprise.
Clint backs out of the door with his hands up, but he’s still watching them with a speculative gleam. “Just admiring your technique,” he says.
“Bobbi Morse,” Coulson says quietly, when Toni glances at him questioningly. “One of our best undercover operatives.”
Toni needs to check the armor’s filters, because she is positive she should not be getting this sickening wash of rotten eggs and septic tanks up her nose. The faceplate is down, so it should be a sealed environment. No way for the stench to get inside. She’s halfway to convinced it’s all in her head, because she hates swamps. But this stink, it’s a persistent phantom, crawling up her nostrils and setting up camp in her sinuses, sending scouts to fetch water from her tear ducts and shooing the kids down her throat to jump on her gag reflex.

She shudders hard against him with a thready little moan. Her head tips away, hair cascading over her shoulder, presenting him with the lines of her neck and throat. He stares at her skin for a long moment, fascinated by the pulse jumping just under her jaw, then squeezes his eyes shut and swears savagely in Russian. He sucks in a long, shuddering breath and presses his forehead to hers, tightening his hold on her waist.

“And you want sympathy for your eye.” Nat’s voice is flat and Bucky can almost picture her, standing there with one eyebrow raised and her arms folded. “I don’t see why you should have it, honestly.”
While Jemma’s busy with her tablet, Fitz turns to butter his bagel. As he takes his first bite, Jemma says, puzzled, “JARVIS, what’s this block about? The one starting at three?”
Tony glances at Clint, and Clint just shrugs at him, with a tiny smile as if to say
“Thank you, Captain Danvers,” Magneto says primly, and cuts an ominous and imposing figure as he descends like a god-emperor from the sky to begin tossing quinjets and metal-based weapons around the deck with negligent waves of his hand. A moment later, Thor lands to one side of him and Carol to the other, and Tony’s kind of impressed at how quickly they clear tarmac big enough for both quinjets to touch down and spill their passengers out into the fracas.
ready, Cap.”
“Color me shocked,” she says with a sideways twist of her mouth. “Hydra’s persistent, I’ll give it that, but only middling-to-fair with actual technique. Couldn’t manage to get the supersoldier program right, can’t manage to keep their brainwashed assassins properly brainwashed, can’t even train their rank-and-file to hit the broad side of a barn with a rocket launcher. It’s a wonder more of their shitty little bases in the middle of nowhere don’t just spontaneously explode from the concentration of pathetically average potential within them.”
There's a very tiny voice, deep down inside, still howling at him to stop what he's doing and run away.
“So four months later, she comes back with a fucking car battery in her chest, new and hilarious scars, all kinds of mental trauma, and the first thing she does is build Iron Maiden two point oh and start waging war on terrorist camps, because the weapons and missiles that were supposed to be, you know, not being designed and manufactured anymore, were in the hands of the Ten Rings.”
And with a firm pull, they haul him out of the chair as if the restraints never existed, through the chill, damp, eerie earth and into warmth and bright, shining light.
“Understood, ma’am.” A pause. “Should I put in a call to Agent Coulson?”
. So there’s all that shit, and Stane swore up and down that he’d find out who’d been dealing Stark weapons under the table. Turns out it was him. I mean, neither of us liked him. He was an asshole beyond the capabilities of just about anyone. An asshole and a goddamn bully.  He sold Toni out to the Ten Rings to get his fat fucking hands on the company. You know how Toni found out?”
“I feel like I should be taking him seriously,” Steve says, gingerly touching his face. He’s already healing, cuts are closed up, but his nose is still swollen and red. "Who the hell was that?"
“JARVIS?” he says. “Do you have a moment?”
“Yeah,” Toni whispers, swallows hard and her eyes crumple at the corners. “Yeah.” She reaches out for Natasha, who takes her hands and gently pulls her into a hug. Toni buries her face in the crook of Natasha’s neck, and her arms go around Natasha’s waist. She sighs, soft and deep, and Bucky watches the tension in her back and shoulders just dissolve away.
“Enough is enough, Toni,” he says, reaching out an arm to snag her and push her back. “You’re either leaving here under your own power, or I’m going to drag you out. Kicking and screaming if I have to. You need sleep. You need food. You need a fucking shower. You need to socialize like a real goddamn person, not lock yourself away down here until you run yourself into your fucking grave.”
Pepper smirks. “Toni, I hate to tell you this, but I am
Bucky tries to force himself not to tense, not to react to the shot of rage and fear the goes across him, through him. Tries not to remember the way Toni looked sprawled in blood on the floor, even though he knows that’s going to feature in his nightmares for a while. “Toni’s a survivor, and her life is kinda… rough. She’s bad, but this isn’t the worst she’s been through. She’ll be okay.”
Toni is one hundred and ten percent in love with her armor.
The relief he feels at that is pathetic and overwhelming, but he’ll take it. He’ll take it, and get through this appointment, and the worst will be over. Clint’s just trying to help, and he knows that, no matter how much Clint’s particular brand of help makes him want to punch Clint through a wall. By the time he’s ready to call the session to an end, he’s got enough on paper, just like with Natasha, to finish later. It’s not his best work, but it’ll do.
, and her fingers tighten on his shoulders, clutching herself against him. “Holy fuck,” she breathes. Her thighs flex on his waist, heels in the small of his back jerking him forward, forcing him deeper. “Oh Jesus fucking Christ, you feel so good.” Her whole body shudders, tightens, arms and legs and hands and sex, until it feels like slick fingers rhythmically squeezing his cock.
“That would be lovely, Agent,” Toni says, going over the code one more time, triple- and quadruple-checking her triple- and quadruple-checks and still finding no errors. “You wouldn’t believe how hard it is to find a good cleaning service who’ll mop up intestines and move bodies with no questions asked. J, progress?”
Toni’s still talking. “I know it might be a stretch for you to trust me, so JARVIS? I want you to give James full access to all of my email accounts, social media accounts, and text messages. If I get a new number, if I have a new email address, a new Twitter account, add them to his access level.”
“Yeah,” he murmurs, and if he feels a tiny bit of smug satisfaction that he got to punch Clint after all, well. He’s only human. “Yeah, I’m with you, sweetheart.”
“Toni,” he says harshly, seeing her wide eyes and her throat under his hand. “Natasha Antonia Stark. You’re my soulmate.”
“Give me a minute on that, J.” Finally, she takes her eyes off the floating screens, looks over to Coulson. “Did you have something to say to me, Agent, or are you just here to check up on my mental state? Actually, how the hell did you get here? I thought you were in New Mexico.”
“Alright, junior,” she says, eyeing the tracking data on the edges of the HUD. They’re right behind her, slightly below. “Let’s see how you handle this.” She decelerates abruptly, diving for a few hundred feet. As she sails past the formation, she rolls onto her back, bringing her arms up, palms out.
With some coaxing from Steve, he finds a more natural stretch, propped on his elbow and several very stuffed pillows, and smirks up with his most aggravating smile. “Couldn’t help but notice you haven’t talked to Toni yet.”
. Then silence.
“Surpassing, actually,” she says snidely.
“Well, how conveniently that happened. Don’t think you’re safe. We’re continuing this conversation later.”
“I believe the Tower is under attack, ma’am,” JARVIS says suddenly.
She wouldn’t be surprised if their end game with this bullshit dance isn’t precisely that: bore her into complacency and impatience, so she’ll sign over her arc reactor plans or the tech specs for the Iron Maiden suits without knowing.

Odin’s eyebrows rose. “They will not like that.”
She fights through the pain, gets back to her feet and keeps going. Twenty feet. Behind her, she hears the ring of vibranium on tile, figures he must have just picked up the shield. Ten feet. She slams her palm on the biometric scanner, and the maintenance door opens. She darts inside and slams it closed just as his shadow falls over her.
Natasha tunes the rest of the rant out, letting the words wash over her in angry waves, and keeps petting Clint’s hair and neck. She glances out the window of the quinjet, watching the clouds sail past, watching the land crawl steadily by beneath. She murmurs supportive noises when Clint pauses to take a breath, scratches lightly at his scalp to take the edge off the anger -- which she knows is not purely anger at all, but is an admixture of rage and sheer terror -- but is lost in her own thoughts.
Fury eyes him. “If I said no, would that stop you?”
“It's the soulbond,” Clint stage-whispers. “It bleeds Natasha's complete lack of human emotion over to me. It's all her fault that I'm so mal—ow! Hey!” He rubs the back of his head, where Natasha just smacked him, and gives her an arch look. “Honey, I thought we agreed to never bring our sex life into public view.”
“Jesus, look at her. They used me to do all that damage.”
Toni’s mark smooths out suddenly, rocky spikes and electric jolts fading into steady waves of hopeful nervousness, even though Steve’s sparks hot and agonized with the anger and grief Bucky’s been feeling from him since Steve’d come back to himself.
Clint side-eyes him again, and just laughs, humor tinged with bitterness. “Jesus fucking Christ, Barnes. Stop trying to understand what you clearly can’t wrap your head around. I don't need her mark on me to know with perfect fucking certainty that when the world is burning down, we'll be standing back-to-back fighting to the end. Just...” He sighs, and both the humor and the anger dissipate. “Just let it the fuck go already. I’m not a threat unless you make me one. You keep gnawing at it like this, and the only one you’re going to hurt is Toni.”
Bright, jagged surprise laces through Clint’s thoughts, and Tony finishes extricating himself from Clint’s head. “That’s not what you said before.”
“‘Kay…” she breathes, and he loses contact with her as, with superhuman effort he wasn’t aware but is unsurprised to discover she possesses, heaves herself to her feet and staggers the remaining distance to her work table. “Pain in the ass hallucinations,” he hears her mumble over the click of an arc reactor sliding into place, and the workshop dims into faded blue static.
"You two alright?” she asks over her shoulder, and crouches to strip the agent’s weapons. Combat knife, sidearm, spare clip, taser. Brass knuckles, really? Scoops them all up, and turns around.
“I’m not a host sharing my body with the Phoenix.” Tony hesitates, and his expression goes troubled and maybe a little trepidatious before he sighs and adds, “I think my body
“You do have a habit of feuding with Cap,” Peter, who abandons hanging upside down to crouch on the wall near Tony’s chair, says reluctantly. “And you were in a coma for an awfully long time, Tony. It would be easy to get things confused, even without something like the Phoenix Force invading your system.”
Toni subvocalizes the command to disengage the stealth plating on her suit, cuts the ports in her boots, and engages the external speakers, opening chords of “Wrathchild” blasting at top volume. She drops in front of the guard, holding the fist-down pose for a moment.
“Because he’ll just crawl into the vents and nest in there if you try to kick him out,” Bucky says, and starts to put her cup of coffee on the counter beside her.
until she can purge them from her thoughts. And that means she needs her retreat, her tree branches with its shield of leaves and twigs, with its cache of paper and colored pencils, and a few hours of quiet to spill them onto clean white pages.
“Unable to comply,” JARVIS says. “Your power reserves are below the recommended thresholds.”
Her attention abruptly focuses on him, and Phil smiles inwardly. He should send Paula flowers for the tip. “You brought me coffee.”
sure it's a good idea to leave the Phoenix embedded in him?
Her response is to slide her hand over his shirt, rest over their blended soulmark on his chest.
Hogan waves him off and turns the engine over. “All part of the job, sir,” he says. “Where to now? Back to the mansion?”
“Did you delete the tweet?” He startles himself with that. How the hell did he manage to make his voice so calm and casual? But the next second, it doesn’t matter, because he sees how much tension cascades off Steve’s shoulders, the relief that relaxes his face nearly to the point of tears.
He stares down at Toni, lost and pained, her battered face framed in his palms. Wishing for things that were is his wheelhouse, not hers. It stabs something in him, cracks something in him, to hear her wish for simpler times, because that has never been who she is.
And done! Jesus Christ, this thing ate a significant chunk of my life in so many good, fun ways.
“I am not at all sure about this, Barton,” Tony mutters, then readjusts his grip on the enormous stuffed rabbit to reach past it and ring the doorbell, and battles the urge to hide behind it as he senses Carol approaching. He chances a quick scan, catches a flash of her toweling her hair dry as she thinks about how she’s going to need to finally decide if she’s growing it out again or keeping it short, and rolls his eyes behind his sunglasses. “Never mind. The most pressing thing demanding her attention is her current hairstyle.”
when someone crosses you. And
“Nah,” Kate says, and steals his last slice of pizza out of the two-day-old box, makes a face after the first bite, mumbles something unintelligible around her mouthful, and then eats the rest of the slice. “We,” she says, still chewing, “took a trip to the Iliad offsite storage facility and raided their server farms. There’s probably a lot of worthless junk in there, but you went looking for information, right?” At Tony’s slow, wary nod, she grins, pushes her sunglasses to the top of her head and spreads both hands above the bounty of jump drives. “I give you data.”
He’s also never seen so many soulmarks in his life. Even serving in the War, with all the casual nudity that came with it, he never did more than catch a glimpse of the Howling Commando’s marks. It’s a different time and a different age, and the morality of soulbonds has evolved, and he knows that. But in his day, soulmarks were a private thing, to be shared only with one’s bondpartners. Baring his chest for Project Rebirth, with one blended soulmark and one unblended, had been the hardest part of the whole process. Seeing so many symbols, blended and unblended, on display, is a little uncomfortable and vaguely pornographic.
“I… would like that, ma’am.”
They’re really doing this.
the Phoenix.”
Her head has that foggy, drifting feeling that means she’s on some truly epic painkillers. She knows everything hurts, but it’s distant and dull, ruthlessly shoved and smothered under a numbing blanket of narcotics and sedatives. Her mind isn’t screaming along at warp speed, it’s crawling on its hands and knees and stopping to take power naps. It’s going to take her days to shake off the fogginess.
On some level, he must have noticed the presence of another person, because he doesn’t instinctively prepare to attack. The voice is unexpected, but there’s no rush of adrenaline, no honed reactions swinging him around with clenched fists, just a tight, unhappy knot between his shoulderblades.
Her breath hitches, and her hands go still in his hair. “S’okay, James. We all have really shitty days. I forgive you.” Her voice has dropped a few notes down the octave, comes out husky.
She forgets the mystery of having a ceiling above her in a heartbeat, and is on her feet without quite planning on moving, reaching out to haul him with a gauntleted hand fisted in the material of his armor back towards her. “Goddammit, Steve,” she says, and leans her forehead against his cheek. “Don’t do that to me. I can’t lose you this soon after finding you.” She swallows hard, and the muscle in his jaw jumps under her temple. “Bucky can’t lose either one of us either.”
She launches forward, pushing off the mat hard and fast, spinning the moment she clears the floor into a high spinning heel kick. Steve snaps his arms in a cross in front of his face, trapping her foot between his forearms.
“Yes you did,” Nat replies, amused. “But it’s fine, Steve. I don’t have feelings you can hurt. It’s making you uncomfortable, frustrated and edgy, so I’ll drop it. You already know what you have to do. We’re all just hoping you’ll get around to doing it.” She shakes her hair back out of her face and resumes her pose on the stool.
“That fucking man is going to die,” she hisses. “Those are my fucking apples. I labeled them with TONI’S SO FUCK OFF CLINT and everything. Christ, why do I keep him around?”
. She levers herself off him, patting his chest wearily as she drags herself clear. “Just so you know,” she grunts, though he can’t hear her, “I’m counting this as our first fight. And I totally won.”
Toni blinks as she sheds her clothing and steps into the shower. “That’s… thoughtful,” she says, tipping her head under the spray to wet her hair.
The speakers chirp and the desktop screen shifts accordingly. “Loading infomatic protocols. …Updating program. …Update complete. Unit technical designation: Just Another Rather Very Intelligent System, mark 1.0. Unit familiar designation: JARVIS. Unit primary purpose: to learn, to grow, to evolve. Unit secondary purpose: to monitor, protect and assist my creator Natasha Antonia Stark, also known as Toni Stark. Personality matrix installing. Installation complete. Integrating new paramaters. New parameters accepted. Reboot required. Rebooting.”
“Yes.” He cleared his throat and smiled ruefully. “I’m sure my negotiations with Sindri will suffer my abrupt departure of Myrkheim, but even a king may have a family matter that must take precedence.” He paused. “Does she know?”
“Anything,” she says. “What do you want? A plane? Trip to Disneyland? Dinner and sex? Private island? Tell me what you want, and it's done.”
She reaches under her skirt, shaking her head to clear the lingering effects of the chloroform, and pulls her knife free. Thus armed, she stands and pads on silent feet towards the door.
“Hold on,” she says through gritted teeth, and squeezes her eyes closed. “If I survive this, remind me to kill you,” she mutters, and braces for impact.
“Okay, Stark,” she says to herself, shaking back her hair and squaring her shoulders. “You once convinced an entire roster of calendar models to join you and Barton in defacing an Italian landmark with booze and nudity. You can convince a room full of the people who know you the best that you are perfectly business as usual.”
She slaps it back down on the desk, slightly gleeful to see Carter jump at the bang, and scrubs her face. “We're not doing this,” she announces. “I am officially off the clock as of
Red Star is walking beside someone who looks incredibly familiar, and she’d place him right away, but she’s too busy gaping at the tall, broody brunet with his half-mask and greasepaint eyes, because it’s been over a decade since she saw him and he looks
Fennhoff shakes his head. “It’s too soon.”
But first, he has to beard the dragon in her den. With that cheerful thought, he adjusts his tie and steps into the gleaming, broad lobby of Stark Tower a moment after the uniformed doorman pulls the glass and chrome door open for him.
“If you still want to help out, Agent,” she says, as the Mark VII locks on and starts unfolding, sliding, expanding around her, “do me a favor and make sure no one else steals more of my shit.” The helmet shifts, slides, forms around her face, and then the faceplate snaps down into place, HUD flaring to life. Repulsors spin up, the chestplate locks over her arc reactor, shatterproof glass sliding protectively over it. “Mama’s gonna go express some rage.”
“Of course you will, ma’am. I’ll file a reminder in the burgeoning Empty Threats folder.”
“Yeah?” Fond, familiar teasing. “You and what army, glowbug?” He closes the faceplate, tips her a salute, and soars off, she assumes towards the landing pad.
“Charming,” Clint says, grabbing an orange out of the bowl on the counter. “Christmases must’ve been a hoot.”
“Good.” Almost before she can do more than think about it, the suit starts shifting around her, the subtle alignment corrections that allow for offensive, tactical maneuvering and weapons use. “You sure I can’t run away with the armor? God, she’s handling like a dream.”
“Good,” Bucky says, firm and confident, but Toni can see the relief in his expression. “We’ll work it all out when it happens.” He pauses, and his mouth turns up in one corner, a lopsided boyish smirk that Toni dearly wishes he wore more often. “You think they’re gonna be a lady, huh? Why’s that?”
Her eyes are bright, dazed and happy. “I also thought I’d file the paperwork today,” she says softly, “if that’s okay with you.”
God, he's so fucking gone on her. If it wasn't pretty much the best thing that'd happened to him since Stevie, he'd be disgusted with how gooey his brain feels just looking at her.
It was the kind of look that said,
He lifts his head, and there’s a dazed flush high in his cheeks. “Yeah?” he says, and Toni laughs at the hint of self-satisfaction in his grin.
Toni spreads her arms and hands in a casual shrug. “Of course. I’m an unapologetic asshole, not an obnoxious douchebag.”
“We’re right here, Stevie,” Bucky’s voice murmurs in his ear, and a phantom touch brushes along his shoulder.
idea. And it’s only one floor away.
doesn't want to fuck with, because even with accelerated healing and superior strength, he’s got the distinct impression that Clint’s beyond caring about his own well-being, and would cheerfully die as long as he takes the two of them out with him.
“What the fuck, Barton?” Bucky says, much more calmly and politely.
It’s fine. He can adapt. He knows the game now.
“Toni, do you understand what you're even asking me to do? That kind of relationship, even a temporary one, requires a lot of trust.”
She is on her way to meet Clint at Miceli’s, and is running behind schedule. Her morning had been spent interviewing the final pool of applicants to fill out the administration staff, and her last interview – a woman named Virginia Potts, who goes by Pepper, whose personnel file she purloined from Stark Industries; seriously, the woman was wasted in the secretarial pool over there, MB from Harvard, years of management and retail experience at a variety of upscale chain stores, and they have her taking dictation and fetching coffee – ran overlong. But since she managed to grab Pepper as her Chief Operating Officer, she’s counting it as a solid win and an excellent excuse to present to Clint for her tardiness.
“Repeatedly,” Rhodey says, laughing at Clint’s scowl.
Even with gods on speed dial, he's never been religious, but he's a mouse before a lion right now, and he finds himself praying as he starts the firing sequence. Risk assessment and threat calculations are laughably impossible, but he tries to make them anyway, force of habit, ingrained behaviour. The Phoenixbuster fires, and Tony is blinded momentarily by the brilliance of the flare.
Your wife.”
He starts, blinks. She’s not smiling anymore, and there’s the faint hum of worry in his chest. “What? No, no. You an’ me, we’re in this together. I’m with you.” He snags her around the waist, nuzzles into her neck until she’s purring happily again. “Out for dinner, or y’wanna stay in and I’ll cook for you?”
“Oh,” Pepper says airily, “I won’t keep you. I just know you had a meeting with Toni this morning and she was in a remarkably good mood all day afterward. Best mood I’ve seen in awhile. I was calling to see if you were still alive, because for a little while there I was afraid she’d thrown you out of her office window.”
now.”
He smiles, calm and capable and alert. “You ready, soldier?”
Muse, “Madness”
“Then stop missing your shots. We don’t have time to stop and whittle you up replacements right now.”
“Probably because you’re a good man,” Toni says, standing up with the shield and trotting away. “And you’d insist on giving it back to its rightful owners.” She holds up the shield, out to the side, like a target. “The trigger’s pressure based, but I haven’t finished it yet. Can you just… flex your forearm a bit?”
JARVIS opens his eyes.
She grins. “Well, not only did I finish your arm early this morning,” she says, “it’s also the third day post-registration, so it’s pretty much official, honey.” Her eyes are dancing above her coffee cup. “Courier should be picking up the DSMR cards for you and me today, dropping them off this afternoon to the office. Our bond is officially recognized in the eyes of the law.”
And then he dreams of nothing at all.
Bucky puts his tablet down as Steve moves past into the kitchen. “So talking to Toni went well then, I take it?” he calls after Steve, and is rewarded by the sound of a door slamming further in the suite. Bucky isn’t sure when it happened, but somewhere along the line, he became the functional adult in this fucked-up back and forth. the three of them seem have have sunken into. He slides his head between his palms, locking his fingers on the back of his neck, and just breathes for a few moments. Then he sighs and scrubs his face. “Okay,” he says softly. “Alright. I’ve had it. Goddammit, enough is enough.”
“Aye, Iron Phoenix,” Thor calls over her shoulder, voice loud enough to carry over without the comms, as she sails past him with Mjolnir extended.
Natasha smiles a small smile, but says nothing. She’s seen the Iron Hawk specs. She’s seen the Iron Widow specs too, and appreciates every sleek line and deadly weapon Toni stockpiled onto it. One day, she might even ask Toni to let her have it.
is what’s worrying.”
“Were you good?”
Toni’s second child is born without fanfare or notice at the end of the spring of her 19th year.
She had never been there, of course, only saw it through the distancing filters of projections and educational materials, but she knew it should not be cold and quiet. Shadowy, perhaps, and smoky, because it was the home of darkness, but never cold and quiet. Mother’s lessons told her that more than three hundred dwarves should live there, that it should be loud with the ringing of anvils and the shouted conversation of the smiths at work. There should be hot metal and sparks spilling from workstations. A seething, rhythmic pulse thrumming through her bones as dwarves pounded steel and quenched molten metals.
It’s kinda creepy.
“Mark VII, time to completion, 4 minutes. Diagnostics, time to completion, 3 minutes. Backtrace is still in progress.”
“It’s already done,” Sitwell says, and sits back with a triumphant smile. “Who’s going to stop me?”
“Better not be,” Toni huffs, and Bucky grins like a besotted idiot as he watches her go over to pay Steve the same attention she’d just paid him. The feel of their affection for him and each other quietly washing through him is just as new as it ever was, and he hopes it never gets old.
He separates everything slowly, pushing aside bank account statements with cards attached via paper clip for four separate banks, one of which isn’t even in the United States. Three separate credit cards, all of them sleek and black and bearing the name J. Barnes in smooth, raised letters. A US passport. Pages of print-outs that look like tax records and job histories. A clear, press-zip envelope with JOINT ACCOUNTS written in black marker in Toni’s messy scrawl, with more envelopes and cards and information inside.
Toni blinks tiredly. “Just read the fucking logs, James. You only got part of the conversation. You should really see the rest.”
Warnings for narcissistic behaviour and gaslighting attempts.
James frowns. “Who the hell is Coulson?”
I believe there's a difference between drama and angst, but I don't hold my definitions as the ones everyone must use. Everyone has their tolerance limits, everyone has their preferences. I adore the hell out of all of you for the feedback you've given, for the fact my hit counter is so high. For how many subs I have. For how many kudos I have. But I want you all to enjoy the stories you're reading, and if what I'm writing isn't that for you, I want you to know that I really do understand, that I wish you all the best and hope you find a fic, an author, a book, that is exactly what you're looking for.
Steve tilts his head, frowning. He thought Hogan was from the car service Toni said she used when she didn’t feel like driving or flying places. “You’re an employee?”
Russian:
She’s tired and bleary and desperately needs to bathe, because she’s been awake and laboring for just over 43 hours and she desperately needs some painkillers, because everything hurts. But as she sees the light spark over what she knows is her greatest creation, she can’t help but think, with the gooey, fuzzy warmth of all new mothers, that all the pain and sleep deprivation and muscle strains of the last two days are more than worth it.
With vision-dimming effort, she flips the release catches of her armor and drags herself out. With one hand still gauntleted, she crawls over to where the Winter Soldier is stirring, uncoordinated and loose-limbed.
He tries to sit up, but the two do something with the poles, and shove him back down. Belatedly, he realizes they’re control nooses, and the nooses are around his throat. His thoughts are slow and hazy, sluggish. He’s been drugged enough that he’s not going to be able to fight his way free any time soon.
“You know something, Steve?” he says conversationally as he wraps his arms around Steve's waist, braces against the teeth-rattling crunch of hitting the world's most stubborn supersoldier like a wrecking ball, and only sheds a few involuntary tears of pain at the jolt ripping through his abused shoulder when he shears abruptly upward to carry them both to the secondary, mostly empty VIP deck. “I think you forgot to mention a few things the other day when I asked you to fill me in on the stuff I missed while I was asleep. Why don't we talk about that now?”
Howard’s office still holds a scent of cigar smoke, those ridiculously vain King of Denmark sticks he had personalized in diamonds and gold foil with his name. Toni can never smell that brand without thinking of Howard, telling a four-year-old girl that she would never be an engineer because girls are stupid. It always smells like fresh hurt and hidden jealousy to Toni.
“Maybe,” Steve eventually concedes, and straightens up to turn and lean back against the rail, hands wrapped loosely around the top bar on either side of him. Tony’s breath catches just a little, because Steve’s eyes are shockingly blue, and the golden-orange-scarlet hues of the sun backlight him until his hair and shoulders are almost glowing. Steve smiles ruefully, with just a hint of embarrassed grimace. “Probably. Is that going to be a problem?”
“Yeah,” Bucky says quietly. Because as much as he hates to admit it, the little shit is right. It’s long past time he stopped worrying about this, because the only one who’s making it an issue is him.  “Yeah, okay.” Eyes Clint critically for a moment, then gets up, shifts down a few seats, and holds out his fist sideways. Says more firmly, “Yeah, okay. We’re good, man.”
Things clatter and clang across the floor as he sweeps the work table beside them clear. He drops her on the table, and hauls her shirt and her sports bra over her head at the same time. The glow of the arc reactor brightens, dances over her skin, throws shadow across her breasts. The mark above her right breast,
Blindly, she grabs forward. Her fingers snap around what feels like a Kevlar vest, and she grabs
Now, to check and see if the voice-operated interface is performing like it should. “Good morning, unit,” she says. “User ID: antoniastark, password: doublestar1980. Run protocol info-dot-exe and accept all updates.”
Steve manages to make his stance look like a fluid motion in a single step of his foot. “I know you’re not superhuman, Toni,” he says with an amused frown. “But boring and old are two words I doubt I would ever use to describe you.” He pauses, eyes looking distant and dreamy for a moment. “You do smell like vanilla, though,” he adds then. “I think it’s your soap.”
“Shoulda hired me as your kept man,” he says, shifting into a more aggressive stance. “I’m much more agreeable when nudity is involved.”
, and told her calmly that if she didn’t attend her ladyship lessons, he would have to fire Mrs. Jarvis. And Mrs. Jarvis won’t be able to find another job, because Howard won’t give her any recommendations since she can’t actually do her job if Toni doesn’t let her.
“Short version is that Toni’s never offered and I never asked,” Clint says. “It’d screw with my ability to see shit coming and going. There’s a reason I don’t wear a mask beyond vanity.” He shrugs and fishes a beer out of the cooler between him and Carol, tosses it to Bucky and snags another for himself. “Toni’s probably got an Iron Hawk or something tucked away in a folder for a rainy day, though. She does shit like that.”
Steve rolls over, with a lazy smile, and reaches up her. She slaps her gauntlet against his glove, and the static locks adhere to each other. “I knew you’d catch me,” he says, and she pulls him flush against her, locking her arms around his waist, kicking her feet down and burning her jets for everything she has.
“Paperwork? For what?”
Director Garrett is clear in his directives, gives extremely clear mission objectives. Steve's always been a good agent, follows orders, thinks well on his feet, is able to adapt to shifting circumstances as mercurially as they change. He's never been fond of killing, rarely does it except as a last resort, disdains agents who reach for guns and knives and other deadly weapons immediately, instead of fighting to subdue.
“Is something amusing you, Barnes?” Sitwell says.
, pulses the knot in his stomach.
” he drawls, and charges.
“Two suits,” she murmurs, and closes her eyes. “I’m not going.” Clint stops yelling abruptly, and the room goes awkward and uncomfortable with quiet. She opens her eyes, sees them all looking at her. Surprisingly, Clint and Natasha and even Bucky are nodding slowly. Rhodey just looks confused, as does Carol, and Coulson? Well, she can’t tell what he’s thinking on the best of days.
An old lady, that Toni is sure she has outrunned by, caught up and politely saluted good morning before going on her business.
Sorry for the waiting, it had taken me some time to decide when to swap them. I mean, I could have gone on abour telling their gender issues during that week but It was already time for the plot to move on. Please comment and leave some kudos! :)
“Bingo”, Toni smiled and rushed from her place on the floor, in front of the desk, to the wardrobe. She made a face at the khakis and suspenders, but put then on anyway, before then rushing all the way back to the living room and out the front door.
I have a nice introduction of Bruce for the next chapter ;-)
I really wanted to show how Steve cames to realize that he is in the future, but the timming didn't seem rigth to bring up the topic. So he suspects but doesn't want to confirm it.
“I had a theory that sleeping could trigger the change but…”
Steve goes to MIT, and they unexpectedly swap again in the most weird of times.
“No, but seriously, think about it”, he said with more drive he has felt in months, letting his feet touch the floor and the bottle of cheap beer aside on the coffee table, “Sexual harassment is a serious accusation, didn’t you said Killian is a pig with everyone in the office? How come nobody has sued him?”
Tuesday morning came with trying to understand the gibberish that studying computer science comes with. Steve give up after the hour. He is stubborn, but can recognize when something is light years above what he can do.
Steve stayed on the sofa, fidgeting a little while thinking about what he has himself gotten into, before eventually sighing and going to bed too.
At least now he doesn’t have to solve any case that comes their way. They had gotten big enough that now they have both regular clients and a decent number of lawyers in the firm capable of working alongside them.
In which Steve and Rhody are headless chickens while Tony is taking it better than what she should.
It was the longest hour and a half of his life.
Monday began with an two-hours-long-early-flight back to Boston. Steve was still quite nervous of flying, but getting to sit between James and the beautiful dawn at the other side of the window made it better. Then it was getting back to Toni’s ‘dorm’, which actually looked more like an apartment than a single bedroom (bigger and more sophisticated than his and Bucky’s), and getting a copy of Toni’s schedule. James mentioned something about being for once grateful of Toni’s little awareness of the pass of time, because it seems that she has reminders for every single class she takes —in a thing that James called “computer”—, but Steve was much more worried about other things than the classes itselves.
Parker called in a favor for a friend. Apparently Lizy’s boyfriend robbed a local store—or those were the charges—, but Peter was sure the guy was just an idiot, the kind that would panic and run when confronted with a policeman. No wonder he was arrested, running only made him seem all the more suspicious.
The media always exaggerated his playboy persona, but he still enjoys a good party and gets laid from time to time. And if working in Potts Co. taught him something, it was that he wasn’t made to be a CEO from the start. Too much responsibility. He barely gets out of bed in time as it is, and tends to forget that there is a certain number of pro bono cases that he needs to fill up every three months. He doesn’t like them, they are just a publicity stunt.
“Well, you are not the most patient or pleasant lawyer one could deal with.”
“You mean a telephone?” they are not meant to carry around as James seem to be implying to say.
“You are still here” he finished, letting himself sink further into Toni’s sofa. After classes they made a beeline to the apartment in silence, some of the student body send curious glances their way but James was used to it. Being friends to the most public-outgoing person in the world can do that, “Maybe it is something else, something that you both were doing before going to bed.”
After Howard’s death, both Jarvis and Maria were accused of homicide.
Predictably, Pepper followed by his side. She lowered her voice at noticing they had the attention of most of the present personal, “It is great publicity when it makes it to the news”, then she sighed, “I am not saying it is bad to help when you can, that is great Tony, but sometimes it is better if you don’t show up so much at a police station.” She didn’t say more but he could feel it in her gaze.
Eventually, Rhodey left for the Air Force, Stark Industries changed its name to Stane Industries, Pepper graduated business school, and Tony tried and failed to get a job at any law firm—something about his reputation mixed with him being an omega, good old discrimination.
Even now, when Tony looks up to Stane Industries, when he re-reads his father’s will, or when an alpha tells him what to do; even then, there is still that same hot hate he has for the injustices of this world. The world that made his mom mad, and that took Jarvis away. Still, not everything is bad, he has Rhodey and Pepper after all.
She immediately cupped her breasts and jumped up from where she had been laying—in the bathtub back at her department in Boston, for some weird reason.
Pepper looked down to the offered fruit, dumbfounded, then back to the man that was clearly hiding something, “That was weeks ago! It was just one case, I never said you had to hang out there. There is so much more work to do here that I don’t get what you're doing filling up unnecessary pro bonos.”
Rhodey laughed and shook his head before standing up to stretch, “I was going to say crazy, but sure, that too” with a last smile and a “Good luck!” he was off to the guest room.
“Sure, but having knowledge on the field would make things so much easier… I need a new pair of shoes.”
“Shit! Thank god I am back!”
The redhead closed the glass door softly with a click, choosing to stay standstill. She is the very image of authority with crossed arms, dark blue pencil dress, and killer high heels. Maybe once he entertained the idea of mating with her, but their short relationship showed them that they were better off as friends.
“Sue him.”
“What do you mean?” Steve was confused, this is the best option they have and James didn’t want to give it a try.
It didn’t come up in court—which they won, not surprisingly—, but he made sure to leave a path of crumbs. Something too obvious to be left alone. Or so he thought until A.I.M. got on its feet again and arrested them for manipulation and robbery of some company’s blueprints (“Come on! Why would we want to rob tech a decade behind Hammer's?!”). And sure, he did hack into their systems and manipulate some of the information (“It was too easy and I was bored Pep!”) while also getting access to their security cameras for getting the evidence they needed. However, Pepper wasn’t involved in her lawyer’s less than righteous ways, so she was released without any repercussions.
Tony went directly to the back and began to fill a glass of scotch. He had missed being able to get his hands around the good poison on his last years of college. He would have offered Pepper some but she is the responsible adult, “I will take that as a compliment, always a pleasure to make the boys run up the walls.”
Just a normal day in the force.
And with that he was left alone to venture inside under the gaze of his classmates, which made him even more nervous and brought back a little bit of color to his cheeks. Steve was home-schooled his whole life so he just took a seat all the way at the back, just to make sure he isn’t taking someone else place. Luckily the class began and no one approached him to claim the seat.
“We need to find you a tutor.”
“Dude, it is differential equations one, one” he stressed out the last word, and Steve could just assume that was because there are more levels to it, “What did you used to do before this?”
He still loves her, as the big sister he never had.
Another thing that he noticed was the teacher regarding him for a second —maybe because James was saying the truth about Toni not bothering to show up for this at all— before starting the lecture.
Pepper stopped in mid-rant and stared at him as if he was out of his mind.
“Firstly, don’t call me that. Just call me James from now on because, you know, we are supposed to be friends” the look he threw to the hallway made Steve remember that they were not alone. Most of the people passing by or into the classroom were giving them curious stares just for being overly secretive with their conversation, “Second, Toni will find a way, don’t worry. Do you carry your-Toni’s phone?” the frustration of mistaking them again was clear on his face.
And that was another thing, Howard wasn’t entirely faithful to his wife. But being ever the charmer, it somehow morphed from Howard to Maria being the cheater, and so giving her husband reasons for searching a warm body at night. The older Stark didn’t say anything, but many theorized it was because Maria cheated with the family butler, and just didn’t want to dig into that shame.
In the middle of all this madness, there was Tony. The omega son that started it all.
To Potts Consultations being the most sought after, by both clients and employees alike. They hire without discrimination, and take cases that nobody else wants—mostly from normal people that doesn’t have big companies to rely on, cases that appear to be doomed from the start. Money isn’t a problem when winning the defense makes enough for both paying their fee and making their clients life’s comfortable.
“Tony, you’re not listening. There are lawyers, as in plural, suing him will only give me more problems than what is worth it, everybody knows it. Also, there is no way people are going to believe that an alpha is being sexually harassed by a beta, society is that short-minded.”
Classes came and went. The man turned woman still feeling uncomfortable with the female underwear and the looks he was getting from almost everyone. Normally Steve wasn’t too self-conscious, you get used to it when you have been as skinny and short like him for most of your life, but the glances people here give Toni were something else. It was like dreading the moment someone would stop him to try and bully him, only for that person to keep quiet and ignore him. Nobody —other than James— addressed her, and Steve couldn’t help but feel a little bit lonely.
He tried not to think on how it just happens to be Toni’s bed. That the mattress was the comfiest one he has ever sleep in, and that the pillows have a certain sweet smell to them —Toni’s, his mind supplied, and he just wanted to walk back to the living room and sleep in that little sofa. But he stays, because it is not his body, and he should take care of it.
The memory of being arrested—again, for petty reasons really—came to mind, and he rolled his eyes while finally making it inside. His office was impersonal, without a single framed photograph. He comes by once or twice a week anyway.

Srry for the really late update. This last months haven't been easy, because of covid, college, and other stuff. But I really wanted to bring back this story, so here is my little something for those Stony fans that have been feeling down and have come to search for some OTP drama.
Her newest bestie (in the 40s, for Rhodey will always be her platypus in her own present) went off to work just like yesterday, and so Toni was left alone… with a moop, and an appointment in the land of “getting back some dignity”. At least he thinks it was Steve who peed outside the toilet, otherwise she would have to search for new living quarters, ones without an annoyingly-sexy-asshole —he keep snickering and cracking all the way to the door. Sometimes the idea of all this being her imagination was more than plasauble.
Obadiah Stane was the one who made the charges, evidencing how both butler and wife were the only ones with access to the man’s workshop, and how both would have more than enough reasons to kill him.
This chapter was more a exposition of the normal activity in the police station, also of Steve's and Tony's interactions since they met. But don't fret! Next chapter we will be able to see things from Tony's perspective.
The last time she was out it was such a shock that she needed to go back and try to not hyperventilate. The accent on her own voice told her this is Brooklyn, and soon it became pretty clear that she hasn't been to this part of the city before. There isn’t even a slight familiarity with the architecture or the names of the streets but Toni didn’t let that interfere with her goal. She knows now where Steve’s work is —or was going to be— so she needs to act quick and make sure it is not some cover-up for some kind of secret lair for some time-travel machine, and if it is, what’s better than that? That is the only possible explanation, someone has to be behind this and she was just sure it couldn’t be Justin Hammer. He couldn’t code correctly to save his life.
Steve is no more than a stranger on this place, on her space, and by now he probably has already obliterated her privacy.
“I didn’t.” That much is the truth, “It was laughable! I defend people from homicide or corporate espionage, not your next store thief. If it wasn’t Peter asking I would not have gone.”
Eventually, he took a quick shower, trying not to touch too much and not die from both the heated water and his racing heart. He wondered how women deal with long hair while reading some of the labels on the self-care products he found. At the end, Steve opted for just using plain soap and shampoo —things that he at least can recognize, for most expensive they seem—, and then putting on a pair of “jeans”, a t-shirt, and a black sweatshirt. It was too informal for his taste, but James called it a normal casual look of nowadays.
“Don’t get me wrong. Toni is a pain but I do want her back. It is just that Reed seems…”
“It will only be a major cluster-fuck if we don’t do a good job at presenting the facts.”
“You think I haven’t thought of that? It will be impossible! A.I.M. has a group of lawyers backing them up, I know there is dirt they want to keep covered but I have no evidence whatsoever. I may be his PA, but Killian loves anonymity. He would not just take me to meet his secret investors.”
“What is this class about?” he asked while following Toni’s friend through the hallways, feeling uncomfortable and self-conscious of the panties that he was wearing and the very female parts on his chest moving and rubbing at each step against the cloth. There were some people walking around on their own worlds while wearing some variation of the same style in clothing, but the fact that these pants were just too tight didn’t help him at all. Sarah raised him to be a gentleman, and even if he has a valid reason for wearing them it doesn’t make him less than a pervert.
It just occurred to her in the sixth day, while waking up to a very normal and not at all missed pain at her navel, that maybe being a man had its advantages. She didn’t miss having her period at all...
James eyed esceptically the strange man, “Is that… No, never mind, I don’t want to know”
“We have no evidence!”
Tony shrugged, smiled, and lifted up his glass for a toast, “to Brooklyn”
So, “why suddenly go all the way down to Brooklyn for pro bono cases?” she asked in a suspicious tone one day, finally able to intercept Tony. The man hadn't taken more than ten steps outside the elevator, with a smile and giddiness to his feet too obvious to ignore.
She also came up to a drawer with notebooks full of drawings and comic strips in Steve’s room. It made her curious of what kind of person he is, but as soon as the thought came it had to go. She wasn’t doing this out of trying to make her act more believable, this was just her getting info and clues on how she ended up in Steve’s body and why.
He didn’t have anything to lose.
At the end of the day they have gone through half of Toni’s classes and concluded that an artist like Steve —a home-schooled-artist that probably time-traveled from a time where going to college was a much more higher privilege than it is now— couldn’t pretend to know how to code in Python like the back of his hand. Even if he was in Toni’s body it seemed that none of her genius was left behind. At least Rhodey knows now that Toni is whole wherever she is, still it gives them a much bigger problem.
Pepper likes to refer to the whole endeavor as a great example of what happens when he has a “great idea”, Tony always retorts with: “It brought us to today, didn’t it?”
James let out a sigh, closing his eyes for a second so he could rub at his temples. He looked stressed out and Steve feel bad for it, even if at the end James is doing all of this for Toni’s wellbeing and not for Steve’s, “We have no idea of how this happened, as for the year…”
She slowly approached the desk, lifting up a folder and skimming through the pages, “And you are still going there to defend people of thief, teenage drug dealing, and for dressing up as superheroes while robbing crime scenes?”, her eyebrows reached her hairline.
“And why the change? You didn’t even want to go in the first place.” She asked, not buying his act.
“A law firm is essentially a business, you are doing great love.”
Steve bodily twitched while James seemed impassive with his arms crossed over his chest, but if stares could kill…
Tony had to serve a week of prison for hacking and breaching their “privacy”, until the next court, where he went all out presenting the whole creepy facts. Then the feds took it up from there and he and Pepper got out of the whole problem.
It suited Tony just as fine, that means he still has plenty of time for his old pastimes. The redhead is the one that sometimes claims to have taken the short end of the stick, mostly because “Tony! I graduated from business school, not law!”
Tony created a law firm and Pepper ended up as CEO, again.
“What? No. You know what? Forget it, just… I will be back in half an hour”
“1939” Steve said. They didn’t talk about it, and saying it out loud made him feel nervous and a little panicky of knowing exactly how much time has passed.
Not even lifting his eyes from the floor he answered, “I am sorry, but I think I can’t pass as Toni after all.”
“The fuck happened?”
“You know you love me.”
“I am not sure if this is a good idea”
He smiled, an idea taking shape before his eyes, “But we could use the money and the attention of the media to put up a law firm, with us as CEO, and offer some of your coworkers jobs. Hell, we could help them get compensation too if they want it!”
Reed and James exchanged glances —the later still looking rather skeptical with this situation—, and before James could comment something Reed said, “Don’t worry, I will find a way to change you back.”
There were some other photos depicting the two friends, and a particularly worn one of a middle-aged woman with a beautiful smile. She didn’t want to pry more so let the photos be and skimmed some newspapers. Nothing weird about them, or at least there weren’t any particularly critical events in history she should be concerned of. America didn’t get involved until 1941 so she should have plenty of time to figure it up before she destroys history or something similar.
Back at the office, she knew something was wrong, knew she was too angry, managed to alert JARVIS, tried to reach out for help. Thought she was in control after she kept herself from choking the life out of Carter. Now, rocketing across the Long Island Sound at just under Mach 1, she still knows something’s wrong, knows she’s passed way beyond
Distantly, he’s horrified at himself, wants desperately to stop, but the words are pouring out, cruel and careless. “You’re supposed to be a fucking genius, but you’re the dumbest fuckin’ person I’ve ever met.”
Steve would rather not have come to Toni’s impromptu surprise party, because it seems a little disingenuous for the person who hurt her help celebrate her return from serious injury. But Bucky is a terrible nag, and he recruited Carol and Agent Coulson to help him make sure Steve made it into the den instead of slipping off to … not hide, exactly, because Captain America never hides. He might have preferred a
The majority of this chapter is completely NSFW. It's like, 80% smut and 20% talking. Just uh, *cough* beware, because thar be explicit sex — a fucking lot of it — ahead in this chapter.
JARVIS’s voice softens just a little. “You do not seem to be in a mindset that allows for enjoyable surprise, ma’am. It goes against my directives to not attempt to prevent more discomfort.”

“If Iron Patriot’s on scene,” Rumlow says, binoculars raised to his eyes, “Warbird won’t be far behind. Those two are rarely far apart.” Sure enough, fifteen minutes later, a second armor settles into Stark Tower, closer to the Iron Man profile, but the wrong colors. This mission is getting complicated, fast.

“Good eye,” Clint says, eyes still on the TV. “Can’t get a thing past you, huh?”
Tony hangs in the air above everyone, floating in a shifting cloud of amorphous fire,  stretching out with every sense he possesses -- technopathic, telepathic, physical, all of them at the same time -- and waits for Kobik to show herself.
She drags her eyes up over his face. He’s lost his mask somewhere along the way, and if she wasn’t three seconds from collapsing, she’d totally notice that, under the black eyes and cuts and swollen left cheek, he’s completely and utterly
And she will. But first, Howard’s funeral.
Remembers putting the pencil to the pages carefully laid out on velvet under glass, remembers each and every sketch. Late at night, by candlelight, on the front, in hotel rooms on the bonds tour.
“That was twenty minutes ago, ma’am. Circumstances can change.”
He sleeps for a while, exhausted by the tests. When he closes his eyes, Peggy is sitting in the chair beside her bed. When he wakes up again, she’s still there. The doctor eventually comes back, does some more tests, simple ones, asking who the president is, the year, the date, other snippets of trivia that don’t seem important. He answers, though he doesn’t see the point. Feels his stomach churn again as her face just falls and falls and falls with every answer he gives.
The light, soothing touches resume. “Go back? Go back where?”
“Oh, I am,” he says cheerfully. “I’m so fucking angry, I want to track him down, slice off his cowardly fucking balls, and ram them down his goddamn throat. But I know you. You could have taken him apart if you wanted to. So I’m just a raging fucking tower of pissed off, but I’m taking your lead here.”
After a moment, JARVIS responds, “No. It is far more likely that sir inadvertently damaged the arrays by embedding hostiles in the drywall.”
“Then yeah. Yeah, go ahead. Progress check?”
The corner of his lips curve into a smile. “Good.” And his mouth slants down over hers, nipping at her bottom lip. Toni melts into it, forgetting her arms are noodles and bringing them around his shoulders, threading her fingers through his hair. He’s sweaty, but so is she, and it should be gross, but it isn’t.
She’s got the documentation in her hand, both the original files stamped all over the place with the SHIELD logo, and the drafted charter for the Avengers Initiative, the words are right there in front of her, but she still can’t wrap her head around it. “I know he says one thing and means another like, all the time, but I somehow doubt that the words
“About goddamn time,” Clint grumbles, slouching back against his chair and tilting his head towards the ceiling. “JARVIS, mind using some of your frighteningly broad Red Queen autonomy and sliding authorizations on over from Stepdad to Aunt Carol for a few days?”
JARVIS’s reply is dry and amused. “A stunning achievement, madam. But if I may say, you are still short by five if you wish to match the Brave Little Tailor.”
Today is the day she gets to tell the board of directors to go fuck themselves, because she doesn’t have to whine and beg and plead with them to stop obstructing her. To look at the fucking designs, the market projections, the goddamn numbers. Today is the day that she doesn’t have to be hard and ruthless and ball-breaking to a bunch of white, rich old fucks who take her bust size, multiply it by her age, and subtract that number it from her IQ.
When she gets back to the living room Rhodey’s still sitting on the couch, uncommonly still and serious. There’s a thoughtful, cautious, assessing expression on his face that Toni isn’t sure she likes. It’s, in fact, making her anxious, nervous flutters gnawing at her stomach.

“But Toni fucking Stark can’t wait for anyone,” he seethes, absently tipping his head back so her hand runs further up his head. “Doesn’t she trust us? Doesn’t she trust
“Good morning, ma’am,” JARVIS says. “The time is 6:23am. It is 64 degrees Fahrenheit, and the weather forecast is cloudy with chances of rain. Your calendar lists this date as your 18
“Hi James.” Her vision is turning grey and fuzzy around the edges. It hurts to breathe. “I really am thrilled to finally meet you properly. But if it’s all the same to you, I think I’m going to pass out now.”
She cracks open an eye, stares unimpressed at him until he looks up, then shuts her eye and thumps her head against the back of the couch again. “You, huggy-bear, are not one to talk about responsibility. You are supposed to be studying, because you’ve got a midterm on Monday, 30% of your grade, isn’t it? But you’re actually playing EverQuest. Tsk, tsk.”
The smile twitches, widens marginally. “My first name is James.”
“Thirty three floors, thirty-two of them underground, ma’am.” If JARVIS is getting tired of answering every time Toni complains – approximately once every thirty three seconds, she thinks, one for each floor of this stupidly complex and unnecessarily huge base – he has the courtesy to pretend like he’s patient. “Would you like me to overlay a map to your HUD, ma’am?”
Bucky expects it to be quieter once Toni and Steve leave for Malibu. More relaxed. It isn’t either of their faults, but the tension over the last few days has been thick enough to taste in the air, and it’s almost like an immense pressure has lifted off his shoulders with them taking alone time to work their shit out. He should feel guilty about that, but he doesn’t. He loves them both, but being their soulmate, their common link, is just fucking exhausting at the moment.
She lands flat on her back, skidding across the floor. His fist punches down again, hammering into her faceplate. The metal shrieks and groans. A sharp pain cuts into her eyebrow, and her right eye is suddenly blinded with hot and wet. The HUD flickers rapidly.
Steve smiles back, lowering his hand from his eyes, and there’s something soft in his expression. “Ms. Stark,” he replies, just as grave and respectful. He reaches out and runs his bare fingertips over the additions she made to the paint design. “These are new,” he says, tracing the lines of the white star on her left pectoral plate and then the red star on her right.
He doesn't think about all the ways his sparkly new portfolio can benefit Steve and his plans for a new, better world.
He sighs, lifts the bottle again and drains it completely without breaking eye contact. “What do you want, Colonel?”
“Personnel files listed? Yeah, give me a head count of who’s left standing.”
His skin smouldered and cracked, blackened as the fury of the star screamed around him, and she cried out in shock as it swept him away to roll, charred and dying, to a heap. She turned, as fear swelled, and she was surrounded by corpses, floating free in the weightlessness of space. She screamed again as she spun to flee, and came face to face with the golden eyes of Heimdall, bloody and dead and impaled.
There are two of him, no four, no, now there’s just the one, and Toni grinds the heel of a hand into her eye. “Shit,” she mutters, feeling the trembling in her arms, the wheeze of her lungs, the sharp twinge in her chest, the inconsistent flutter of the arc reactor. “Fucking concussion. Fucking Hydra. I shouldn’t have come here.”
Natasha jabs her hand, snakelike, and fingers pinch around Toni’s chin, holding her firm and steady. Toni’s eyes widen until they hurt, but she can't pull away without pain, and Natasha's grip keeps her mouth closed.
A little bit of backtracking. Ran long. Ass-kicking next chap. Promise. :)

He pockets his phone, takes a moment to compose and recenter himself, then resolutely begins heading down the stairs again.

“In my defense,” Steve says, pushing himself off her chestplate and pulling his cowl away from his head. “I wasn’t trying to skydive without a chute. I was trying to get back onto your boot, and--” His eyes shift to over her shoulder, widen, and his mouth snaps shut abruptly.
They return banged to hell and freshly bandaged, but smug and self-satisfied as they both dump a double handful of thumb drives on the table in front of him. He arches an eyebrow, hastily covering his coffee when it looks like one’s going to take a dunk in his brew, and then gingerly pushes it out of range of the cup. “Am I going to see a story in the papers tomorrow about two mysterious Robin Hoods who robbed from the Staples to give to the billionaire?”

Jemma smiles, her whole face bright and happy, and he feels the last of his reticence crumble away. That smile always makes him go weak in the knees. “Don’t worry, Fitz. Everything will be fine.”
Fitz lives under a charmed star. It’s the only explanation he has for how he got from tinkering in his basement in Aberdeen to the top of New York City in Stark Tower’s bleeding-edge workshops, with state-of-the-art everything and the hands-down best coffee he’s ever tasted. He’s a kid in a sweets shop. No, better: he’s a budding mad scientist in a top-notch lab with an unlimited budget and a partner who slots neatly into his life, one carbon atom to another.
Toni snaps her mouth shut and nods.
The footsteps that rush up to him echo in his head. A blurred-out figure kneels beside him, he can’t tell if they’re male or female. Hands reach out. A voice says, from five miles under water, “We’ve got you, Captain Rogers. You’re safe now.”
Names, dates, faces, memories of scent and sound rise with every photo he looks at. He steps past Stark, steps around her, vaguely hears the shield clatter and ring on the floor as he drops it. Sees himself in every photo, pre-serum, post-serum. Remembers every scene. Every battle. Every stage. Every time he punched Hitler in the mouth for the cheering crowds. Erskine, Peggy, Phillips, the Howling Commandos. Howard Stark. Bucky.

It’s fading rapidly now, the spiky intensity dialing down to a dull ache and a throb. He laughs like he’s drunk, knows it’s because of endorphins or something, doesn’t matter to him. “I know, sweetheart,” he says and, with a lot of concentrated effort, slides her hand from where it’s pressed against their soulmark to the double star on the other side.
She turns away puts the screwdriver down, and the tiny click of metal on metal is nearly deafening in the silence. “So,” she says tightly. “That just happened.”
“Captain Rogers and sir are indeed good for you,” JARVIS says dryly, “if at the age of thirty-two you have finally learned the fine art of patience.”
really. But pilots, especially ones I can trust, are very hard to find.”
“Stop arguing with me,” she says, even though he hasn’t said a word, “and get your ass under the covers before I crawl back out there and make you.”
He says nothing, continues staring at his hands until Toni’s almost convinced he’s become a statue. She sighs, closes her eyes, rests her head back against the wall.
Natasha comes trailing behind Toni, her hair so different and her face so young herself it takes Steve a moment to recognize her. “You shouldn’t leave,” Natasha is saying, neutral expression firm and secure, but Steve’s gotten to know Natasha a little. There’s an agony in her eyes, lined sharp and clear by the tiny furrow and slightly pinched lips.
“Neat,” she says. “I’ve always wanted to be a self-contained apocalypse.”

And she vanishes as quickly as she appeared and just as huffy.
“Which explains the telepathy and the flight without the suit and the bursting into flames, I’m sure,” Quill says, sharp and caustic. “How stupid do you think we are, Stark?”
He chokes on his own tongue, and spends an embarrassingly long time coughing and spluttering as he shakily replies:
JARVIS opens his eyes.
Carol just keeps smiling at him like he said something particularly cute or adorable. “Because when you say it out loud so you can hear it? That’s when it hits you, fully and completely, that you have a soulmate. Or two, in your case. You’ve already bonded with one, so you should know this.”
She spoke it quietly, but firmly. “We must do nothing. Her visions will not come to pass for quite some time, until our sons are men grown. We will
This chapter is a bit of a departure from the style I've been writing in so far this fic. For one, the timeline is played straight: it starts the morning after the end of Ch 5, and goes on for about five weeks of time-crunching. There are no flashbacks in this. It's also told completely written from Bucky's POV.
, let alone
“I love you too,” Toni says, quiet and amused, sets her cup on the table behind them, and turns to wind both arms around him, her eyes knowing, but bright and happy. “It’d be nice to stay out here forever,” she continues, and her palm smooths over the place their blended mark used to be. “But you’re right. It’s almost time to go back. Not the least because I’m pretty sure Pepper will personally drag me back to be Toni Stark, Media Darling and All Around Genius. The launch of the new Starkpad is in a few weeks. Pretty sure she’s gonna make me adult for that.”
arm for you. End of story.”
Folks,
her twentieth birthday.
“You won’t,” a woman says in a voice as rich and as clear as a bell, and a slender hand emerges from the shadows of the lab to slide into his metal hand, palm turning up beneath his to link their fingers together in a hold stronger and more unbreakable than the bonds keeping him chained to the machine at his back. “You’re the most stubborn asshole I know, James. No matter how hard they try, you’re never going to forget us.”
Have they always been that particular shade? He frowns a little, trying to force the tip-of-his-tongue sensation to manifest into something he can grasp, track, recall.
“Yes. Almost right away.” A significant pause, and Steve’s eyes shadow over, fade a little.
. Knows without having to look that they don’t contain the documents those innocuous categories would otherwise indicate. “Understood, sir,” he murmurs.
“Best I can figure,” Tony says, after he heroically swallows his laughter and manages to find a somewhat diplomatic tone and his prepared
He’s not about to go off the rails or anything, but he’s definitely not handling this well. He hasn’t slept in what feels like years, because he’s not used to sleeping alone anymore. He’s too used to sleeping beside Toni, wrapping around her skin and warmth and vanilla-metal-coffee scent. Too used to drifting off with his nose in her hair, too used to waking up with her legs around his hips. In the grand scheme of things, it hasn’t technically been that long, but subjectively it’s a goddamn eternity he can’t wait to be over.
“Kill the music, J.”
The phone vibrates in his hand again, automatically scrolling to the bottom with the new messages. This time it’s on the other side, meaning Toni’s texting Clint
The almost inaudible scuff of a footstep against the floor outside the door caught her attention, and she looked up to see her husband standing in the doorway, quiet and concerned. She straightened and, with one last lingering look at her children, turned to leave them to sleep once again.
Toni’s repulsors are faster;
The man in the mirror looks highly skeptical.
. Ignore the pressure in her chest, ignore that she can’t breathe, ignore spots dancing in her vision.
Mutely, Toni nods. She has the urge to shrink into the pillows, would if Natasha wasn’t holding her still. She remembers suddenly why she prefers to never, ever piss Natasha off.
He wakes sometimes in the middle of the night, unable to remember his dreams but shaking and drenched in cold fear-sweat, with the darkness pressing in around him until he can’t bear to not turn the light on. He fills sketchbook after sketchbook with the faces of the men and women he knew, faces he desperately, almost manically, puts down on the pages with as much detail as he can, terrified he’s going to forget them all.
,” Natasha says, but her voice is distant and echoing as the mansion and its memories dissolve into mist around him.
after the coma. Also, my word on it.” His face flickers for a moment. “It was good enough for you when I killed Banner. Should be good enough now.”
She’s already moving when he says
miss,” he says.
He runs a hand through her hair, gently loosening the tangles with his fingers. “You need to sleep, sweetheart,” he says softly. “Doc Cho said as much. Food and sleep. You’re getting the first, sorta, but not the second.”
Tony stares at his screen, absently finds his coffee again and downs it while contemplating the question.
There’s a crunch. A grunting groan. Dust avalanches down.
Tony hears the disappointment in the Avengers’ thoughts long before anyone comes up to the roof to find him. Despite Steve’s intel on where the Red Skull had based his operations all this time, he somehow managed to get away yet again, leaving only an empty apartment behind.
“Then why’re you doing it?”
“See,” Toni says softly, “this is why I’m not going to at you for invading my privacy, for reading stuff you were never meant to see, because you have every right to see it. I wasn’t thinking, and I was very fucking inconsiderate. I broke the Poly Prime Directive, I wasn’t open in my communication, and I am so very fucking sorry, honey.”
“I’m starting to want you to make me,” Steve says, and beckons her forward again with a quick flick of his hand.
Tony grimaces and puts a hand on the back of his neck. “I'm fine,” he says, clearly lying through his teeth, which Steve finds irks him a little more than it used to. Interesting. But before he can call Tony on the lie, Tony relents. “Okay, I'm clearly not fine. I just don't know how to explain it.”
He’s bulkier than the photos Steve’s seen, but there’s no mistaking the blue glow in the center of the chestpiece, or the bright red and gold. A cool voice with a British accent says, “I’m afraid you’re not authorized to be here. Retreat is recommended, or force will be utilized. This is your only warning.”
He pulls her out of her chair and gives her a very tight, very warm hug. “I was just going to say that all of that you said? Is probably a smart call. We got this for you.”
He turns off the radio before Peggy can convince him to find a parachute, or bail out before the crash, or anything else that might preserve his life. He’s weary of it all, feels Bucky’s loss like a sack of stones roped to his throat, feels the empty place his unknown partner should be. He’s tired of fighting. Tired of choices and decisions. Tired of his miracle health and peak condition body, wishes for the old sick scrawny Steve again.

Limp Bizkit, "Break Stuff"
. A big litter of stripey, polka-dotted kittens. And then I’m going to kill her.”
“I’m sure,” she says, and slides a palm across his cheek. “Go on, Bucky. I’ve got JARVIS and if Fitz is half the engineer his degrees and patents suggest, he’ll be along before too much longer to give me a hand.”

Because the answer, where he’s concerned, is always going to be the sudden whining shriek of repulsors blasting the back doors off the vehicle, and a
“You look stunning,” he says honestly, eyes the way the folds fall around her legs and bends to carefully outline them on his page. “I’m just a little distracted.”
And Toni’s smiling too. Because she can smell the baby genius on them from here. Knows without having to ask that they’ve both acquired at least one PhD before eighteen. Knows they’re overachievers, driven to create and design, innovate and invent. It’s a siren song, rare and beautiful. She knows her own when she sees them.
glaring at her with folded arms and a stubborn set to his jaw, standing in the middle of her workshop and blocking all of her attempts to go around him to get back to her projects.
!” The voice is distant, searching. Tony hunches her shoulders but scurries deeper into the garden. Mrs. Jarvis is looking for her, but… just… not today.
Voice of God pulls her back. Forces her back into herself. Her gauntlet is wrapped around the top of Sitwell’s skull, so tight the bones shift with the tiniest flex of her fingers. “Right, boss,” she says, and releases him.
“Certainly, sir. All workshops are now locked out of ma’am’s access for the next 24 hours.”
Her already-tight shoulders tense some more. “Sabotage? Is that how they did it?”
“Sweet,” she says, glancing over her shoulder to make sure no one is on their way back down to drag her bodily from the workshop. “Let's do a full dress rehearsal, see if we can't shave some more time off that. Still seems a bit long to me. Use this.” With the flair of a master signing her name to a painting, Toni spins the altered specs out to rotate in 3D, draws with her finger the outline of the paint job she wants. “Give me…. Hm. Oh, I dunno. I'm feeling whimsical today. Blue and red. Some yellow for contrast. But not a gross washed-out yellow, more like…”
And speaking of minefields, Phil turns his attention to preparing for his second appointment of the day, which is with Captain Steven G. Rogers, currently adjusting to the 21st century in a suite at the Triskelion.
“Of course, sir.”
, but that statement snaps her right back out of her pleasant haze. She freezes, muscles locking back up into knots, and whips her head to stare wide-eyed at him. “I’m sorry, what?”
“Hot, humid and full of mosquitoes. We were in the Amazon running down leads on a Hydra base when Coulson called.” He sighs deeply, and it shudders his whole body. “Sometimes I wonder if my life would be like if I hadn’t answered that ad for a personal assistant, you know. I picture kids and a farm and a tractor that doesn’t work somewhere out in the middle of fucking nowhere where terrorists and hired goons and superhuman assholes can’t find me.”
doesn’t that make her ribs feel just
He grins and winks at Tony, whose jaw drops slightly and whose eyes go round and big in his head. “Think about it, Tony. World’s a better place when we’re side-by-side. You taught me that.”
“Funny, me either.” Bucky crosses his arms. “I wanna know why you shot at Steve, Toni.”
, Toni. Clint nearly had a complete mental breakdown. I had to pry you away from a panicking assassin in order to get your spare reactor into the dock. Two minutes in which I had to argue with your overprotective, unstable soulmate to even
Tony finds himself smiling in response, a slow, curving tilt to his mouth that is his patented Stark smirk, a thousand percent him through and through. “Okay,” he says easily, and pulls Steve to his feet as effortlessly as if he were lifting air. “I’m betting you’re wrong, but on the off-chance you’re right and there’s nothing left of the man I know? We’ll just have to burn together.”
She tenses, her mind flashing to Afghanistan and cluster bombs and dark holes in the world. She debates breaking down the door to check with her own eyeballs. “Jericho?”
killed people, I know that--”
“It’s actually pronounced
“JARVIS,” he says through clenched teeth.
Just looking at the chair is enough to make him want to run as far away as he can. Toni’s workshop looks nothing like the dim labs he’s woken up in before. It’s bright and futuristic, clearly meant for an engineer and a machinist, not butchers and sociopaths, but it still makes him want to flee. The thought of lying back and letting someone fiddle with his arm, do things to his body, has his skin crawling and his pulse pounding.
Comes back to find a gun in each bloody hand, something pink and puffy and speckled with shards of bone clinging to the fingers of his metal hand. Hair swings into his face, slick and dripping with blood.
He watches her go, lost and confused, can’t wrap his head around any of this, can’t … Peggy
“Some people get hawk vision. Some people get the luck of a bad penny.” There’s something else crawling over Clint’s thoughts, something sick and ugly and dark, and Tony desperately tries to pull free before he can see what it is. But it’s too late, and the guilt and self-loathing of Clint’s part in Bruce Banner’s death smashes into him like a gut punch. “Jesus, Barton,” he says, wiping beads of sudden sweat off his forehead with a shaky hand. “How are you living with that?”
“Time to go, honeybunch,” he says, lays his hands on the surface of the ice, and reaches deep within himself, brings forth the fire, wills everything to
? Not even your father. One day, you’ll understand why.”
how fast that word came out of her mouth, no thought necessary.
“Shh, I know.” He pulls her close in a one-armed embrace, presses his lips to her temple. “But you can’t do it right now. It’s okay. I understand. Come to bed, huh? Let me look after you. Let us look after you.”
And breathlessly waits for the images that follow to load.
Still, she’s completely wiped because Steve is a merciless perfectionist, and she spent the last fifteen minutes drilling in form corrections and adjustments to her fighting styles. She lies on the mat, flat on her back and limbs sprawled out, catching her breath. “Bet you totally regret that boring-ass human crack now,” she says, once she’s got enough lung capacity to manage speech. “Even if you totally allowed me to get in that first takedown.”
She sighs and pulls the helmet back over her head, mimicking Steve’s gesture with the cowl of his uniform. “Fine,” she grumbles without any actual disgruntlement. “But if I drop you, don’t blame me. I don’t usually fly tandem.”
Bucky shrugs and sips his coffee without saying a word.
Come on, Barnes! Look at me!
“No,” she replies, because she always refuses. Then, grudgingly, “Probably. But I’m here, I’m present. I haven’t had coffee. So I’d really rather not right now.” She shifts and burrows tighter in a ball. “How was Bolivia?”
Toni gets her hand around the handle of the right-side door and manages to get it opened, falling through it into the shop flat on her face. “I…can’t… get there,” she wheezes, and Bucky’s heart does any number of frantic leaps in his chest, because he’s never heard anyone sound as bad as she does, not even Steve in his worst asthma attack.
for this man that he really should sit down and figure out soon.
“Honestly?” He shrugs. “I don’t know, Carol. If you want guarantees, I can’t give them. You want assurances I can handle all the new shit I can do? Fuck, I’ve been awake for two weeks. I can't give those either. All I can do is ask you to have faith in me. Because Steve needs you to, and Rhodey would want you to.” He swallows, hard, and isn’t sure he’s going to like the answer to his next question. “Think you can do that?”
Bucky concentrates for a moment, then shakes his head. “Still nothin’.”
He doesn’t know where to put Thor or the Hulk, but asking never hurts anyway. He manages to send individual emails before the grief that constantly hovers in the background of his thoughts whenever Bucky comes to mind swells behind his sinuses, and he needs to take a break to go murder a few heavy bags in the Tower’s supersoldier-rated gym before he shuts down entirely.
The elevator doors open and she steps back onto the floor. This time, she’s the one ignoring the three of them, though she can feel them staring at her the whole time. She hauls the trunks off the trolley one by one, dropping them onto the floor near the far wall. Without a word, she goes directly into the kitchen and pours herself a coffee in the biggest mug she owns, stirs in a medically inadvisable amount of sugar, and snags a packet of pop tarts out of the cupboard.
Give me some Iron Maiden. You know the one.”
He sighs, squeezes his eyes closed briefly, and forces his shoulders to relax. “I’m sorry, Nat,” he says with another heavy sigh. “I didn’t mean to snap at you.”
Clint points at them both with the first two fingers of his right hand. “You two are going to shut up,” he informs them. “I am going to speak, and you are going to listen. Do you understand?”
He searched her face, his mouth tightening into a hard, grim line. “She must be trained,” he said. “Start her tomorrow. We must know if—”
He should go check on Toni, but it’s only a half-hearted attempt to convince himself to leave Steve alone. He knows Toni’s got company, lots of it. Company that isn’t going to leave her alone. Clint’s eyes had been hard and sharp and accusing the last time he looked in on her and found Clint wrapped around her, keeping her warm and comfortable.
“Yeah, yeah. Funny for you, frustrating for me. What are you doing here, besides cockblocking the shit out of my sex life?” She struggles back to her feet, unlocking muscles the scare tightened into what feels like cement. Gently, slowly touches Bucky’s back, presses a line up his spine, silently coaxing him to relax.
Toni never thought she’d die in a dark, dank hole in the world, but here she is. Every breath she takes is fire, and she knows there’s an infection, probably several, chewing its way through the shredded, pathetic remnants of her immune system. Everything is blurry and bright, double-vision and probably-hallucination. She’s still not sure if Ho Yinsen is really here, or if her fevered mind conjured him out of the ether in a last-ditch survival tactic.
He jumps nearly out of his skin when Steve’s hand slides gentle and warm on his shoulder. “Thank you, Tony,” he says, and smiles down in that stupidly Steve way and Tony realizes not for the first time that he’s ridiculously
And then Ty says, “I tell you, though, I’d love to get between her thighs.”
He reaches out to turn her head more fully, and she feels his thumb brush over her cheek. “Nah,” he says, and his mouth is warm and damp, kissing it gently better. “You should be okay.”
Bucky shrugs. “It is to me,” he says, smirks a little. “Shoves me down to number seven.”
“None at all, Commander.” The agent, whose name he doesn’t know, hands him a tablet brimming with information. “We scanned everywhere, using everything we could. Nothing whatsoever matches the signature of the Phoenix Force on that scale. There are plenty of minor signatures, but we’ve known about those since mutants started popping up again.”
соколик - endearment, hard to translate to English (or so I understand, I might be wrong). Loosely means "little falcon". (Per Ai_2005: Why Natasha calls Clint "соколик"? Because Russian nickname for very good marksman is Соколиный Глаз (falcon's eye, not hawk's). Thanks for James Fenimore Cooper's romans translators, yeah. They were wrong, but now it's an idiom, so...)
past her limits.  “Oh fuck,” he says, miserably, and reaches for her. “Jesus Christ. Toni, fuck, I didn’t mean--”
Kidnapping. Misogyny.
Another buzzing. Another message pops up.
To: sgrogers@starkindustries.org
It takes him some time to notice it, but a nagging feeling of something being off prods at him almost from the start of their outing. He keeps pace with Toni, jogging along at an easy lope with her ponytail bouncing back and forth in time with her strides, and Steve on her other side, politely matching her step for step.
“...am going to stop trying to figure out what the fuck is going on, because I need my brain to figure out how the fuck I’m getting out of here.”
“Ridiculous amount of zeroes.”
Toni gives birth to her first child as the sun crests the horizon on her 18
Somewhere in there, he loses his pants as he pins her to the wall again, bending his head to suck hungrily at her breasts and neck. Her breath judders noisily, high and soft and keening. “James,” she breathes, and her nails rake up his back as her hips roll, sliding the soaking lips of her sex along his shaft.
Phil waits until Toni’s wrapped her hand around the cup and taken a long swallow before answering, not the least because it gives him time to take another sip of his own. He’d ask how much the coffee costs, but he’s a little afraid of the answer. “SHIELD has credible intel that outlines a serious threat to your well-being, Toni. I’ve come to brief you on the details and try to come to some arrangements for your security.”
“Right away, Commander.”
“I understand what you’re saying,” Rhodey says, then circles his ear with a forefinger, “but all I hear is
That gives you an unbeatable advantage right there, especially against a normal, squishy human.”
Steve laughs, and it's a sound so familiar and comforting, Tony feels warmth blossom in his chest, spreading through his whole body and draining a kind of tension he didn't even realize he's been carrying. “I don't think I'll ever be as good at sneaking around as Natasha,” Steve says with a rueful grin. “I'm sorry if I scared you. Wasn't my intention. I just wasn't sure where your head was, given everything, and I was trying to be unobtrusive, give you a chance to see me first.”
“Of course, Clint,” JARVIS says pleasantly. “Colonel Danvers’ permissions have been updated to reflect her temporary change in status to the Acting Head of the Avengers Initiative, in the absence of both Deputy Directory Stark and Deputy Director Barnes. Welcome, Deputy Director Danvers.”
The simple act of putting breakfast on his plate shouldn’t stall him in his tracks. He should eat food, because it’s fuel for his system, but there’s too much choice and he’s paralyzed by the sight of fruits and pancakes and bacon and breads and cereals and juices set up on the counter.
“—but c’mon, dude. Give me some credit here. I
She can’t sleep, so she works. She’s always done her best work with insomnia driving her. She’s also done some of her most insane, dangerous, treading-the-line-of-morality work with insomnia driving her. But that’s fine. That works for her right now. She’ll take all the lethality and slipping morals she can, internalize it with a smile, and then hold out her plate to ask for more.
Yes, indeed. Ahead be smut, mateys. Be gentle, it's my first time publicly posting such material.
“Sure thing, boss,” Clint says easily, and glances sideways with another smirk at Tony, tipping two fingers in his direction.
Toni’s eyebrows are up, and so is her wariness, but she trusts Coulson. Which is still something of a shock to her, but she can’t argue with the empirical data gathered over the last week or so. “Alright. I’ll entertain the notion. When do I get to meet them?”
Defeated, she closes her eyes. “I really fucking hate you both.”

,” Mama says, stroking her hair as she curls into a ball and cries in her lap, skin raw and sore from the frozen burn of the marks searing through. Mama has strong, gentle hands today, soothing the marks with a lotion that smells like aloe and tingles with analgesic relief. “Our family has enemies that will think to use them against you. I will teach you how to hide them,
Tony leans forward, digs his wallet out of his back pocket, and thumbs open the billfold. “I have thirty-seven dollars cash,” he says after a quick tally. “And I'm here because Steve is a Hydra agent, and I figured out of everyone I know, you'd be the first one who might have noticed something was a little off about him.”
“Ow! Fucking fuck!” She crashes out of her chair, thumping to the floor in an undignified sprawl and banging her head again, still in the same spot but this time off the floor. “Goddammit, that fucking hurts!” She picks herself back up, cursing and swearing and rubbing at what will no doubt be a
“JARVIS,” he says, swigging the rest of the bottle back. “Time’s it?”
“Drone 4 disabled,” JARVIS announces. “I am returning it to the Aerie.”
“Perhaps you should call Agent Coulson, ma’am,” JARVIS says quietly. “You exhibited calmer behaviour and more normalized biometric responses almost as soon as he entered the workshop. I believe he is your best option.”
She blows out a breath, scratches her hands through her hair. “Cos I have to go into the office today,” she says. “And Clint and Tash aren’t here either. I mean, I can push it off again if you’re not comfortable being alone in the house, but sooner or later, I’m going to have to go in and, you know, be a boss. There’s a building that I need to do the final sign-offs on, designs to approve, people to fire, coffee to drink. Lots of coffee, since there’s going to be meetings with the board and SHIELD wants a meeting to discuss their contracts and even though I’m not CEO of Stark Solutions, they won’t deal with Pepper for some weird fucking reason and--
Fuck Howard anyway.
“--Dr. Stark, Jemma!” the man is saying, and he’s excited enough that his Scottish accent is all but strangling his words. “Her papers are bloody brilliant. I never thought I’d have an opportunity to meet her.” His expression goes worried. “What if she thinks I’m an idiot? What if she doesn’t like me?”
“Yes, ma’am. But, as the saying goes, discretion is the better part of valor. I beg you, be discreet. Wait for Clint and Natasha.”
“But--” Oh God, he’s so confused. “My head hurts,” he mumbles, pressing his palm against his face.
“Then why’re you calling me
In another life, maybe.
Rhodey shrugs, a little helplessly. “I dunno,” he says. “I just thought it might by why you’re so goddamn weird about talking to me about this kinda stuff, stuff that obviously bothers you. Like, maybe you thought it was me, and you didn’t want to tell me or something.”
“We don’t have to do this,” he says as Toni takes her place in front of him, and his arms drop to hang loosely at his sides. “It hasn’t been that long, Toni. We don’t have to do this right now.”
Toni’s eyebrows go up. “You have my full attention.”
Her mouth twists in a sour frown. “I hate running away,” she says.
“Stark!”
She sags sideways, into him, under his chin, forehead and temple pressed against the warmth of his throat. “Yeah, James. I’m with you.”
Steve replies, his voice innocent in the way that always means he’s being devious and knows he’ll get away with it.
She works a swollen tongue in a desert-dry mouth, blinking to keep him in focus. “I want…”
They told him to specifically kill
“Ah yes.” Her mouth twists. “How silly of me to forget.” She swivels the chair back, pulls her goggles back down and reignites the torch. “Let him in, I guess.”
A drone drops out of the sky above her, spitting bullets in her direction. She rolls right in a tight spin, blurting an involuntary “Whoa!” at the suddenness of the attack. Training rounds or not, they’ll still bruise if they hit her. “Oh ho,” she chortles, eyes narrowing as the HUD matrices lock onto the drone and three of its buddies still in cloud cover. “So you’re going to be like that, are you kid? Fine. We’ll play rough.”
technology. He’s lived some of it, he thinks, the time travel and being frozen in time and becoming superhuman and unearthly objects with incredible power. But living it doesn’t make it any easier to accept.
they?
Things go blurry. When they clear, Rhodey’s still there.
Toni’s good at plans. And leading had always been Steve’s thing.
“Getting hit, too. Must be Tuesday,” she replies. “How’s your aim?”
I am not.
Betcha all thought I'd abandoned this. :D
Coulson has the courtesy, or maybe just the self-preservation instinct, to make his presence known long before he taps on the door. “Toni,” he says, and Toni will never admit it, but his calm voice is a soothing balm to her raw, screaming nerves. She may have done her level best to avoid him on occasion -- or all the time, even -- but Coulson carries himself in an utterly unflappable manner, and right now, she’s not going to deny herself the tiny bit of comfort she’s taking in that. “Can I come in?”
He looks down at the neatly-stapled pages in front of him, staring at them like he’s trying to burn holes through to the table with his eyes. He reaches out, drags the document closer, but his eyes slide right past the formal language until the neat lines of text are blurry streaks. Deep in the smeared lines, he can see shadows moving, coming together and breaking apart fluidly. Both soulmarks
“If you’re lucky,” Rhodey grumbles, “you won’t have to brawl with Toni to get it, like I did.”
“--died in 1944 exactly as you said, in a plane crash in the Arctic. They never found his body. You’re the first successful supersoldier candidate since Captain Phillips. They gave you the title and the shield.” She sighs, and trembles a little. "Iron Man is... oh, it sounds so silly to phrase it like this, but Iron Man is a villain you've fought on a couple of occasions. He... hurt you pretty badly the last time you fought him."
“Not exactly.”
He shouldn’t be this grateful. Toni shouldn’t need to tiptoe around him, she shouldn’t need to do the simplest fucking things for him. “Yeah, that’d help,” he says grudgingly. “Thanks.”
He knows where she’s going, and sighs. “Not a thing,” he responds, and wraps his hands loosely around her wrists. “I know. Fine. You’re right, of course. It will be good for us to know.”
She wants to bang her head against the wall, but it would just knock her out. Then again, unconsciousness might be nice right about now. She needs sleep, food, shower. In that order. “Twenty minutes ago, we were trying to kill each other.”
"We're reading activity from the black site, Stark," Coulson says. "Possible reinforcements on the way. I've got extraction heading to you, but it'll be cutting it close."
They didn’t say
She has to get up. She has to get
“Well,” Helen says, and begins to disconnect the leads trailing from the sides of the cradle to the sticky pads dotted all over Toni’s body. “You’re going to have to get used to it, I’m afraid. You need at least one every thirty minutes or so until the mass die-off hits early tomorrow morning. Human beings aren’t meant to heal this fast, Toni. The nanites need raw materials, and this is the best way to make sure you have them available.”
But he keeps himself still, resumes his hand motions over the screens where Steve left his medical files, using the vague awareness of where Steve is and the hazy reflection of the room’s door on the darkened viewscreen to judge his best opportunity. Bides his time and pretends everything’s normal.
Toni watches them, eyes flicking back and forth as they speak. She spins to look at Coulson and slings her arms around them, hugging each one possessively. “Phil, you can’t have them back. They’re adorable. I’m adopting them. They’re mine now. I’m going to hug them and squeeze them and give them labs and write them blank checks.”
Toni doesn’t relinquish control easily, rails and rages against the necessity, mutinies when it’s wrested away, tests her limits even when she grudgingly submits to an authority figure. Mostly because authority figures are usually grade-A morons who she wouldn't trust to tie her shoes, let alone command her in battle. The kind of assholes who summoned her before a Congressional hearing, tried to take Iron Maiden away, let
He dreams of fire and ice, snow and flame. He dreams of smoke and ash drifting in the still, forest air. Of cheering chorus girls and lifting a motorcycle above his head. A dancing monkey punching the face of evil in the name of patriotism.
Tony blinks, can’t for the life of him figure out where the hell Steve is going.
Toni points where Pepper wants her to point. “Tricia.”
She’s grateful the faceplate is down, because she’s positive the heat in her cheeks mean her face is on fire.“Do you know how often Clint falls off a building? Or how many times Tash tries to stick to the walls even though she’s not really a spider? Everyone has static locks on their uniforms, just in case I need to grab them quick.”
.” He scrubs his hands over his face, blows out an irritated breath. “I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me.”
Bucky perks up at that. “I’ve been wondering, Barton. How come you
Steve holds out his arm, frowning. “What do you mean, appropriated?” he asks, as Toni slides the bracer over his hand and fitting it to his forearm. Her fingers are lithe and deft, tightening it until it's snug against his skin. It's not the most comfortable thing in the world, but it's obviously only half-finished, and he's worn scratchier things in his life.
“That's handy,” Clint remarks, tossing an appreciative glance over his shoulder as he goes to the fridge to fish out a couple of bottles of water. He tosses one to Tony, putting it unerringly into his hands. “Always wondered if that quick costume change gimmick was a feature of the phenomenal cosmic power schtick. Learn something new every day.”
She blinks and straightens, because that is a recurring dream of hers, and it has been since she first got her pilot’s license all those years ago. “You want to go flying,” she says, just to be sure she heard him right. “Instead of taking me inside and having your way with me.”
“I didn’t say she doesn’t understand them, Coulson. She understands them just fine. She only pays attention to them when it suits her, however, and that isn’t something I can afford to risk in this line of business.”
But okay, it’s fine, he can work with that. He’s not a man to brag about what he does or what he’s accomplished, but he knows he excels at management and he’s a half-decent field agent to boot. He can look at the pages, look at the numbers, come up with solutions on the fly. The trick is to remain calm.
“We’re going to have to talk about it at some point,” Toni says softly. “I know that. We’re supposed to be a triad, clearly--” Her hand sweeps between his mark and hers. “--but we don’t…” She sighs again, runs her hands through her hair rhythmically, shakes her head slowly back and forth. They’re all signs Bucky’s come to learn mean she’s shoving shit in a bottle, locking it away because she needs to focus on something else. Some
… and Iron Man steps around the corner of the hallway.
Helen smiles back. “If you ask the peanut gallery, I’d say you have that locked down already.”
Because
Toni drops the suitcase, and it lands with a dull thud, and Steve lets go of her as she collapses into Natasha’s arms, her own arms coming up to circle Natasha’s waist, burying her face in Natasha’s neck. “Okay,” she says, shaky and faint. “If it’s what you want.”
He shrugs and rolls to his stomach, muscles flexing along his back as he gets his elbows under him. “In public, I mean,” he says, as if that should explain everything. It doesn’t.

Toni is getting ready to leave for the office again, fourth day in a row, but is dragging her ass like she usually does. She’s just hit the half hour mark in her endless, epithet-laden bitch-session about SHIELD and their incessant need to make sure every single line of every single page of every single contract is read over and understood. Bucky doesn’t understand half of what she’s complaining about, and honestly never wants to know, because even just listening to her rant makes his eyes glass over and his brain shut down. But he knows now that she doesn’t need him to understand, she just needs him to listen and make sympathetic noises at the appropriate places.
------
If he didn’t know better, Tony’d swear Steve is giving him the once-over right now. “I noticed,” he murmurs, eyes fixated on Tony’s mouth.
that’s
He and Director Fury have been having two different conversations this whole time. Phil prides himself on his ability to catch the subtle cues, but Fury has apparently been leaving him in the dust since he walked through the office door. Nothing Fury has said is untrue, but there’s an underlying meaning to every word that comes out of his mouth.
. She’s had this instant connection so rarely, she treasures it every time it happens. “Jim, if I don’t want to answer, I’ll tell her.” Carol’s eyebrow goes up. “You’d stop if I asked, right?”
“Nice try, JARVIS,” she says, trying not to grin and failing spectacularly. “But the suit’s capabilities are more than enough to figure out if there’s a glitch somewhere. Now, be a good boy for Mommy, and tell her why her armor smells like a toilet threw up on a compost heap.”
He watches the quinjet leave the landing pad on the roof, standing with Clint and Natasha by the door leading back into the Tower. None of them say a word until the quinjet has disappeared beyond the skyline.
Clint pulls something off his fist, tosses it thoughtfully between his hands. Brass knuckles, only made of some duller, thicker, weightier metal than brass or steel. “Adamantium,” Clint says calmly, and enunciates every syllable precisely. “Toni made it for me a few years ago. It’s not quite as satisfying as hitting you with my bare fist would have been, but I figure there are enough broken bones in this place at the moment.”
“Such anger,” the other man murmurs, leans forward until he can look Steve in the eye. “Such hate. You may not remember me, but I remember you. Do you find it ironic that the very enemy you fought so hard against seventy years ago now owns your loyalty?” He shifts closer, just a fraction. “Welcome to Hydra, Captain America. We have such plans for you.”
“Soulmate,” Toni mutters into her cup, swallows scalding caffeine so she doesn’t do something pointless like drive Morgan’s teeth down his throat. He has an excellent dentist, after all.
“Very good, ma’am.”
When it comes, it’s gentler, more metallic and darker than she expected it to be. It still jars her, rattles her teeth in her skull, and she bounces twice before coming to rest against something hard and unyielding, Steve sprawled atop her.
—Goo Goo Dolls, “Iris”
“I honestly don’t know.” Steve shrugs with an apologetic smile. “It’s easy for me. Then again,” he says, and Toni knows he just had a thought, because his eyes are lighting up and he has an aura of
trusted people. And then Stane took that all away.”
If he can keep Clint from killing himself ten times over per mission, if he can win the trust of Natasha, who is arguably the most untrusting and paranoid person on the whole goddamn planet, then he has to be worth something. Toni may be disinclined to trust people as a general rule of thumb, but if
He knows without looking up that everyone’s staring at him now, because the cacophony in his head goes suddenly dim and dull. “Thank you,” he mutters, and squeezes his eyes more tightly shut. “Avengers on one side, Ultimates on the other. When did my mansion turn into a junior high dance in the gymnasium?”
Now with
to catch his breath. “I asked her to check a mechanical problem I was having with Lola,” he says. “She got a chance to tinker with her father’s tech, I got a chance to talk without interruption. Win win for both of us.”
She just laughs, knows there's an edge of hysteria in it. "Oh, no.
back then.
without any signs of slowing down, but Tony can’t bring himself to quit now.
It starts with a buzz under his skin, like a wire buried in his pectorals. It’s not an unpleasant feeling, but it’s distracting as fuck, which he can’t afford to be right now. Not when the shitstorm he pulled onto his own plate is so close to being over and the Avengers Initiative with its affiliated Stark Security division is just about to let out of the cage. So he pushes it down, pushes it away, tries to focus on the points Coulson is making.
“Alright, J. Run that fab process, let me know how it goes. I'm going to head up and let them know the guest of honor is ready to celebrate her birthday now.”
Toni lets her head fall back to the floor, and she lays there for a moment, gasping for breath. Her face is on fire, her side is the seventh circle of hell, her head and the occasional stutter of the arc reactor is slightly worrisome. “How we doin’, J?” she manages to get out. Her voice sounds like she’s been gargling metal shavings.
“We,” Clint corrects. “
“Selwyn,” she says, licking the spoon clean before digging it back into the pint. “From Berkeley.”
She hits the hood of the trailing van with both boots, driving deep dents into the engine block, lets her knees flex, lets the van absorb her momentum. The van bows forward, and its driver’s eyes are comically wide behind the wheel. She launches herself sideways, flipping heels over helmet, feeling excitement and glee flicker in her chest. Not hers, James’. She lands on a foot and a knee on the side of the road, drops Sitwell into a heap, and gets busy untying James.
“You’re brilliant, Fitz,” the woman says soothingly, crisp and British. “I’m sure she’ll like you. And if she doesn’t, then
She gestures sharply at the monitor now displaying a bouncing SHIELD logo screensaver, and shakes her head again. She pushes abruptly away from the table, and Tony turns to watch her pace into the living room area and back again. “I want to believe it’s bullshit.”
Just the thought of standing up is exhausting enough. Toni groans and sinks into the pillows. “No,” she mutters, and pulls the sheet over her head. “I’m happy stinking. Go away and let me sleep, Tash. I’m injured. I need rest.”
The first night, Toni doesn’t go to bed at all, and for a good reason, which has several parts. The first part is that she’s been pumped full of nanites who are constantly swirling her body, repairing any and all damage they can find, including the daily wear and tear her body undergoes. The second part is that she has to take a drink every twenty or thirty minutes or she might end up getting eaten away by the nanites -- even though that can’t happen, the nanites are programmed to slow down as reserves and resources dwindle, but Bucky doesn’t know that. The third part is her need to take stock of the damage that's been done to the building. Easier if she thinks about it that way too,
Her arms are trembling by the time she sets the hammer down, and her knees are threatening to give out. Sweat pours off her body, drenching her tank top and jeans, and her chest burns with the ache of pulled muscles.
“My god,” Carol breathes, and wipes a hand slowly down her face. “I don’t know what to believe, Tony. I don’t want to believe
She grins as something flutters in her chest, wide and manic, and starts to laugh. She can sense it now, that strained, weak and faint pulse that sits to the right of her arc reactor, marked by a star as red as blood. It’s steady and it’s strong. It’s waking up and singing electric melodies. This is it. End of the line. “I’m feeling ridiculously
It grows less okay the third day, when Bucky realizes that Toni hasn’t spent more than a consecutive hour with them. He’s been a bit wrapped up in trying to help Steve acclimate to the future to see it before now, but that’s no excuse and he knows it. He should have noticed that she’s quiet and pale, picking at her food and contributing minimal participation in their conversations.
she says, “You’re never going to let me pee alone again, are you?”
At least the nausea is gone. And the headache. Once Fennhoff increased the frequency to every two hours, started him on meditation techniques with special music designed to soothe his heightened senses, all his discomfort and uncertainty just washed away like it never was.
An alarm blares, and he hits the floor on his hands and knees, heaving and coughing and choking. Flails back, feeling water fill his throat, his lungs. His bare ass hits the cold floor, and he yells something wordless and aggressive.
he thinks as his back hits the wall next to the door leading into the building, Steve’s weight keeping him supported while his hands roam under Tony’s shirt.
Tony says, and grins.
She also does something she swore she would never do, back when she was silly enough to think that the world wasn’t stupid enough to try and take too much of her stuff at once. She leaves the decision to JARVIS, but tells him he’s free to engage his Panopticon protocols with the goal of finding Steve Rogers. JARVIS is the most advanced intelligence on the planet. He doesn’t need to sleep, or take breaks, or eat to recharge. He never gets tired, he never gets frustrated. He doesn’t make mistakes twice. He never loses focus. It takes him twenty-six minutes to infiltrate the Triskelion, and another ten minutes to infiltrate the Helicarrier.
poker face. Toni can’t read a goddamn thing from it. “No, it’s fine, Jim,” Carol says, and the side of her mouth lifts into a smirk of her own. “It’s actually kind of refreshing for someone to not dance on eggshells around me.”
Under her dress, under the nano mask that shows an arrowhead, the red star
Instead, he slips in with no one flesh-and-blood present to note his entry.
He can’t afford to lose Tony. Not if he wants to accelerate his planned coup for the Red Skull. He’s already laid a lot of the fundamental groundwork over the years, but a single misstep now could cost him everything.
Her head is pounding, temples throbbing, skin tight and hot and itchy. “Get him on the line,” she says thickly, and the link pops up almost instantly.
“I can’t leave you two alone for a second,” Bucky drawls from behind her, and she sags against Steve, clutching his shoulder as she spins too fast. Her brain, normally faster than lightning, is having trouble parsing the obvious hold of a quinjet around her, complete with a dent in the far wall where her shoulders hit. Bucky, lean and lethal and geared for war, grins at them both, sprawled in the pilot’s seat with an ankle propped on the opposite knee.
“Oh.” He knows that’s huge, that it’s important, that it’s huge and vital and something that he should be happy about, but as far as he’s concerned, it’s fucking
“I kept as much as I could true,” Toni’s saying, but he can barely hear her past the ringing in his ears. “You still have your full name, your birthday, which, shit, we missed because
“Delete them all.” It’s out of his mouth before he can think about it, but once he does, he doesn’t take them back.
Phil thinks about Toni, asking for help, begging for him to call the shots. He’d known what she meant when she said
The message is not from Toni. In fact, it’s not a message his phone at all. It’s Toni’s phone, which he must have taken by accident the last time he brought her coffee, because their StarkPhones are identical. And the message is
“I could go,” she says with a sigh, folding her arms across the table. “But I wouldn’t come back. I’m hair-trigger right now, Rhodey. I’m okay today, but today? Is day one without incident. I just spent a week down the rabbit-hole. Before that? Awfully close to losing my shit and going supervillain. Like, really, teetering on the edge, about to slide down the abyss shouting
you know what you’re doing?” she finally asks, and glances up at Tony.
Luckily, he knows just the guy.
Right now, he wants to reach for his gun. He wants to reach for it
The fourth man in the back, Toni knows, is Jasper fucking Sitwell. Her vision whites over, teeth clench, time goes blurry and--
Toni opens her mouth to say… she doesn’t know what she’s going to say, and then a chime from the window where JARVIS had been running the trace interrupts her. “J? What’s up?”
Coulson’s eyes soften a little more around the corners, and his smile grows a little bigger. “And the second?”
Toni laughs and lazily rolls into a climb, hitting the cloud ceiling at a dizzying speed. “Not letting me break up with my soulmates, huh?”
He turns his back to the elevator as the doors close again, and walks a few paces back down the hall towards the stairs. “My appointment was early, Ms. Potts,” he says, swipes through the security door and starts down the first of twenty flights. “I didn’t think you’d be in your office at the crack of dawn.”
She wandered through the dark and silent ring, her feet making no sound against the icy floor.
A maddeningly familiar voice, leashed fury and pain and rage and grief: "You done, or am I gonna have to knock some more fucking sense into you?"
“Good idea,” Clint says, and hunches into his hoodie, pulling the zipper to his chin. “Can we go do that then and get off the roof? This wind sucks.”
“Tell me what?” he asks, and they both look at him with expressions he doesn’t like. “Tell me
Dr. Stark!”
He still thinks his being here is a terrible idea, but there’s an entire room full of people who are more or less going to insist he stay as well, so his goal for the night has shifted from not being here at all to drawing as little attention as he can.
Toni brakes, grabs and
“I don’t know,” she says, then resumes the slow, broad strokes up and down his spine. After a few moments, the stiffness starts to melt as he relaxes. “What do you want to do?”
“She’s the best of us,” Natasha murmurs.
, Nat. How much shit does a person have to go through? How much more kicking is karmic fucking fate going to give her?”
“But we’re pretty in tune with each other, so…” Fitz shrugs.
“Let’s just hope they’re not dirges,” Quill mutters.
“Of course, ma’am.”
Calling Pepper was a good idea, because once she finishes expressing her utter delight and pleased surprise at his foresight in calling her, she tells him to check his email and there he finds a wealth of information on the project, notably what exactly they expect for each calendar month. Helpfully included in the information he’s amazed she compiled in a short, five-minute conversation is a list of everyone’s birthdays.
“Well,” Toni says, gasping in relief as she leans back. She closes her eyes and wipes her forehead with a shaking hand. “There was that one time Clint tied me to the bed for three days. I didn’t get a single scratch.”
It’s listening to Carol try to justify it, try to tell him that Rhodey would consider it a worthy sacrifice, because they stopped the bad guy.
Steve sits beside her and starts unwrapping his hands. He shakes his head with a rueful smile and rolls his shoulders. “I really didn’t,” he says. “It won’t work on me again, but you caught me off-guard with it that time.” He tilts his head, speculative. “Clint’s been your primary instructor, right?”
The next time he wakes, it’s slow and gentle. He opens his eyes, thoughts foggy and clouded, and lets the ceiling come into focus. His entire body hurts, and nausea churns in his gut with a mild but building urge to vomit. He groans softly, curls into himself, a palm pressed to his abdomen. He closes his eyes again, concentrating on breathing through it.
“I wanna know why Steve can’t bother asking me if I want to talk instead of creeping the fuck up on me all the time.” She spares him a single, withering glance before returning her attention to her schematics. “Looks like we’re both out of luck.”
“And yet, there you are,” Bucky says with a smirk, “still calling the man ‘boss’. Real subtle, sweetheart.”
And then it's gone, like it never was. And Tony puts it out of his mind, because his comms are working again, and Steve is reporting the five X-Men are Phoenix hosts, and he knows with dread certainty that he's going to be very, very busy for the foreseeable future.
“Hi,” she blurts dumbly, because she has to say
He dreams of sleeping in the earth. Dreams of burning in the desert. Dreams of drowning in the sea.
“Because Howard is paying you to keep an eye on me,” Toni says lazily, tracking Rhodey’s movements with her ears. She can tell he’s coming to the couch, but she whines in protest when he manhandles her from one of the cushions.
,” he says, faintly accusing.
Toni just eyes him steadily. “A great many things,” she says, “but this isn’t one of them. You’re my soulmate. That trumps everything else. In fact, here. JARVIS,” she says, raising her voice.
Toni leans back, but doesn't turn around, just keeps her eyes on the floating windows full of code. “Why not?” she replies. “Make yourself at home. Just watch where you step. My last houseguests got a bit rowdy.”
“The time for jealousy was about thirteen years ago. That's never been who we are, and you know it.”
“Stop moving, Toni.” Clint’s voice is edged with unhappy worry, and his fingers stroke her forehead and cheeks. “You gotta stay still. You’re pretty banged up. Go back to sleep. Better if you pass out til Dr. Cho’s here to fix you up.”
It’s stone cold, but it doesn’t have an underscore of spoil like a few rescued cups she’s blindly gulped in the past, so Toni doesn’t even blink. Well, maybe she does, because one minute, the progress bar is hovering around 47%, and the next thing she knows, there’s a loud chime that jolts her so badly her head slips off her palm and cracks into the edge of her desk.
“Serve Hydra?” Lehnsherr shakes his head and sneers. “Not in this reality, little girl. Not in
“Good,” Toni says softly, and holds out a gauntleted hand to the man on the floor. “Alright, on your feet, Terminator. We’re leaving.”
He can’t handle this. He doesn’t know how to handle her. She’s disarraying her entire life for him. She’s opening doors, giving him permission to take whatever, go wherever, do whatever. She’s pissing away relationships that have lasted almost half her life just to make him happy. She shouldn’t be doing this, any of it, because there’s no chance in hell he isn’t going to fuck this up. He’s holding the keys to her entire kingdom, and if there's anything he's learned in the last half hour, it's that it doesn't matter how at home or accepted he feels here, because in the end, he’s a ticking goddamn time bomb.
She doesn’t even know if she’s still breathing, if her heart is beating. Is this what being dead is like? This cold, frozen, utterly soundless existence? Her only points of warmth are where skin is touching hers, and those places are lines of searing fire, but even that’s not enough to keep her rooted.
He might otherwise have said no, because he’s learned the hard way that granting Tony access to any sort of classified files frequently leads to Tony gaining access to classified files he wasn’t strictly permitted to see, but Steve needs to lock Tony’s allegiance down as soon as possible.
“One: you are the only SHIELD liaison I will work with. They try to replace you, or you go mysteriously missing and a not-previously-cleared temp liaison shows up? All bets are off. You, or your officially hand-picked replacement, or we don’t work with SHIELD at all.”
She stares at him blankly for a long moment as her brain tries to process that information. “What? No. What?” Her brain catches up, and her stomach twists, and she’s pretty sure the shock has her face in a rictus of grossness. Oh god, can the floor just fucking open up and swallow her whole? “Oh god, no. No. Ew. Ew! Jesus, Rhodey, why would you ask that!”
“Fuck you, kiddo,” she coughs, and her arms tremble, but she gets her ass up and pulls herself forward another few inches. And that’s where she slumps, eyes fluttering shut, body going boneless and limp as she falls onto her back.
Much later, after Toni’s helped Rhodey study for that test and they’ve watched half a dozen unfunny sitcoms on TV and Toni’s stretching sleepily out on the couch under the afghan Rhodey’s mother knitted for him to use as a throw, she feels Rhodey’s hand brush over her hair.
qualifier on “treatment” a floor away and through shatterproof glass. It makes him antsy, unsettled, to know that things have been glossed over for his benefit. He settles for closing his eyes and focusing on his coffee. The taste, the smell, the heat. The curve of the cup in his hand. The nearly-silent slurp as he sips it. Tries to ignore the tremor in his hand, the sour taste in the back of his throat.
A week later, after more sex in more positions than Toni has even dreamed existed, when Toni’s fairly sure she’ll never move again because everything is just so
Under Steve’s palm, Toni’s heartbeat slows. She goes statue still, but Steve can feel the fine tremor still shaking her to pieces inside. The cold leaching in, her skin paling slowly, and he can’t help but flash back to that horrible night he found her dreaming of the ice. He can all but hear the silence shutting down her mind, can almost see her drifting away into the dark.
She smiles, very faintly, and moves past him. “Because I know everything.”
A Twitter feed blinks open, scrolling furiously with mentions and direct messages, retweeted photos of her in mid-roll, all streamlined and lethal and shiny. She snarls at JARVIS to kill the feed, kill all distractions, kill all noise, all sound. Feels her vision shift red and silver, narrow down. Heartbeat thudding in her chest, arc reactor bright and flaring. Pain and rage and fear and hate pound through the tight ball under her right collarbone, and she bares her teeth in response, anticipating death and destruction
Some bits blatantly lifted from Endgame. A lot of sibling dynamics. A surprise guest who totally isn't going to turn out to be Natasha. >.>
His head begins to ache.
He hits the far wall, and is a little surprised to find that hurts worse than Carol’s casual punch. “Ow,” he groans, puts a hand to his head and turns to squint back at Carol. “Oh hell,” he groans in a completely different way, because every single one of them are staring back at him with eyes gone bright, unnatural, poisonous blue.
Tony shrugs, tries not to feel so very exposed,  hanging in midair and burning brightly as he is. “Got room for one more in the Bird Squad?”
It should worry her, but it doesn’t. Because it might be quiet in her head, it might be still and calm, but every synapse and every muscle in her body is alert and waiting for the first decision to move.
“Yeah,” he gets out between wracking guffaws. “Don’t they teach you anything in secret agent asshole school? Seriously, lesson one should be
“Roger that.” He takes a deep breath, shakes out his hands and shoulders. “Okay,” he says, mostly to himself, but since he forgot to turn off the comms, also to everyone else. “Here we go.”
The blue circle on his chest is half-hidden by the hem of the tank top, but there’s a red point, like the top of her star, visible. It’s a measure of how tired Toni is -- and how terrified of Natasha’s promise of “words” -- that she doesn’t spend more than ten seconds debating whether or not to just jump him where he sits. Twenty seconds, tops.
“He… you and him …. are a lot alike,” he gasps. “Stubborn asses. Hit your limit and just blow up. Tempers like Satan himself.” He chuckles, rusty and croaking. “God, the grief he usta give me, keeping his ass from getting beaten up. Thousand pounds of attitude in a hundred pound body.” He blinks, tries to bring her into focus. “He’d like you too. He draws. C’n see you two, you know, down here. You, lost in your wires and fuses, him, lost in his sketching. God, that’d be somethin’ to see.” He blinks hard, swallows hard, tries to wet his lips.
, Cap,” she says again, and if she’s more reverent than a devout Catholic at Sunday morning mass, it’s only because she’s okay with feeling like a starry-eyed kid watching the old newsreels all over again.
No warnings apply. Pure fluff and domestic stuff.
Pepper's arms slip around her, and her embrace is fierce. “Because one of those things you hired me to care about,” she says gently, “the ones you are incapable of caring about, is your well-being.”
