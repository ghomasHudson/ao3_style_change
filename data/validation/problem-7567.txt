The only times that they would talk would be at the end and beginning of each day. Steve didn’t like waiting that long- Steve wanted Tony right here in his arms, right here in the bed where he could hear Tony’s breathing.
Tony looked shaken at the answer but soon put his face back together. Steve false hope of Tony coming back as the other walked away was never going to happen. This was really the end.
If anyone asked why, her answer would be she couldn’t sleep but to honest, she felt the urge to explore. Since she lived here Natasha had only glimpsed at the blueprints when visiting Tony to discuss her widow bites. Then, she saw a department on the blueprints, something Nat had never seen before. Or even known about before.
Tony was entertaining.
Nat could help him find someone, it wouldn’t be hard. But now they were watching Cartoons and setting him up could wait another day. They both were clearly exhausted, the juice boxes making it worse, and Tony’s love life could be put on hold for now. Just for one afternoon of napping, of course.
“Hey Jarvis, “ Steve asked the A.I looking at the ceiling, “where’s Tony?”
Maybe he could fix it?
They were going to be ok.
“We should have a contest. See whoever knows the most about Stark.” Clint suggested one movie night when Tony wasn’t present. But he was never there anyway.
Steve’s heart broke. Tony wasn’t just drinking for the fun of it, something was deeply wrong. Most people drink to forget their worries, just for a few hours, but Tony must had been drinking to forget forever. Steve remembered talking to Natasha about how Tony seemed different, this just affirmed conclusions.
“ I’m going to Malibu for a while” Tony stopped and leaded on the door frame, facing away from Steve, ”Don’t follow me.”
Steve saw the red embarrassment rise to Tony’s ears. “Sorry” was all Tony whispered. He didn’t know why Tony was embarrassed, it was just them, his team. He thought they had just a little bit of trust between the man.
Now Steve felt like an ass.
He was never going back into that room.
“Ok, then where are we going to hang this up?” Steve snatched the canvas and looked around, “Everyone needs to see this! We should post it on social media or something! Maybe have a press conference!”
“Sorry about your shirt.”
BANG!
“How drunk was I! Oh my god I slept with Captain America.”
“I knew it held some importance to you.” Thor continued. He was happy Tony wasn’t angry at him. The god remembered when he broke Loki’s things and how it caused a rage full week of tiny slights towards him until he forgot about something it. Thor hated those weeks and he didn’t think he could bear it if Tony treated that way. Loki was his brother, they couldn’t hate each other forever, but Tony could.
But he wasn’t here for that, he was here to fix his stupid hand after acting like a idiot. Tony was probably just feeling pity for him, Steve thought, and he knew he would do the same if he saw himself.
“Thor-Thor wait! Your going to rip it-“ Tony let out a big sigh.
No, if Tony hadn’t kissed back then all of this mess wouldn’t have happen.
This was the end.
Tony was going to avoid him, that’s what he was good at. He could do this for days, Tony had the skills too along with the tools. A break away from Steve would do him great, maybe Tony would stop fantasizing about them together if he stopped seeing his face all the time. Maybe if his home was so Steve, Tony could walk around freely without fear of blushing like crazy when Steve was around or someone mentioned him. The lab could stop the idea of Steve swimming around in his brain.
Early that morning, Steve woke up to an empty bed. The coldness ate at his heart as he patted the bed for whatever was supposed to be there. Tony just up and left, didn’t he? That’s all Steve would think, Tony left or he wasn’t enough. Steve sat up in the bed, wrapping the comforter around himself and looked around.
Tony would need to run away from this place forever. No one would ever see his face again.
He didn’t get a another response after that. The captain waited a bit, about to knock again when he was granted entry.
Tony dropped to the floor, tears running down his cheeks. Why did Steve do that, he thought, does he want to hurt him? No one wanted a relationship with him, no one could deal with him, and it didn’t help his heart when he was being teased.
Tony couldn’t look into those eyes. If he did he would fall in love again and say “yes I’ll date you” then kiss the hell out of Steve. And god forbid he did because it never ends well. Tony could see himself at end of whatever it was going to be between them and it was the end of a bottle. There wasn’t going to be a ring or kids or undying love, but Tony and many empty bottles as tried to put his heart back together. He didn’t want to go through that again.
The sting of the glass was almost nonexistent as it pierced his skin.  Steve hardly noticed the broken glass in his hand as he stared at Tony across the room. There he was, waltzing away with a broad completely engrossed with her. And there was Steve by the bar with a broken the champagne glass in his hand, the liquid and small pieces of glass dripping to the floor.
If he was sick, he would want someone to there to take care of him. Someone to make him soup or fluff his pillows. Someone that he can just be with.
His eyes watered threatening to drop those big puddles as he tried to keep it together. At least so he wouldn’t cry in front of Tony. Steve stormed out the room, slamming the door rather harshly.
“Calm down. I’m fine Steve, look at me. I’m alive. I’m right here!” Tony gripped Steve shoulders, forcing him to look at him in the eye.
Steve watched as Tony removed himself from his grip, making his way to bath and getting started with the day. Tony didn’t even bitch about his morning kiss or the unmade bed. Although how much Steve would say to anyone who asked about how much it got on his nerves, he still wouldn’t want to go a day without it.
“I don’t want you.”
He stayed in his corner, lurking at the other man. Studying his way of singing. Such as, moving his hands when he sung and slightly swaying his body. Thor could notice that he was deep in the song and wouldn’t be able to notice him, as he moved towards another hiding nook.
It felt so perfectly right.
Soon they ran out of stories to tell and stared above.
Tony was painting a park, it seemed. It wasn’t any New York park, and it looked different from any American park Steve had seen pictures of. Maybe it was a European park, like in France or Italy. But that wasn’t important.
This party wasn’t a complete failure, Clint said to himself. The contest was in the back of his mind, but learning this new thing about Tony made him happy. To finally have some way to connect with the man than just awkwardly conversing whenever the man was in the room. Or when he needed new weapons and tech.
To his surprise, Tony began to kiss back passionately. It was a jolt of energy against Steve’s steady path around Tony’s lips but felt good. They explored each other’s mouths as they shared a breath, oblivious to the world. Steve dipped his tongue into Tony’s mouth and heard a moan form the man. He wanted more but this was enough.
Pepper
Steve’s phone rang. He picked it up, hoping it was Sam or Nat on a lunch invite, but the screen read Baby Boy.
“Your bed’s cold.” Tony whispered.
“Are you ready?”
After glancing at Tony one last time, he joined the rest of the team in the kitchen. They all had started on breakfast, Natasha making bacon, Thor with the cinnamon rolls (which they found out Tony likes) and Clint working the coffee.
“That isn’t an option.” The bandages around Tony’s head were wrapped tight and his cuts were nicely sealed. His face could have been gone, it could have been more bloody. He could have been dead. Not just a few cuts and scrapes. Tony was lucky. Steve was lucky.
“You just read my mind.”
“I don’t want your apologies, I just want my heart back.” Tony spoke flatly, more in a dead tone. His eyes were soft like a pillow you’ve crashed in after a long day of work.  Now Tony was asking Steve to cut ties, he ended it now it was time for Steve to do his part.
But Clint had never seen Tony like this, in complete disarray. A complete difference from how Tony always showed himself and Clint didn’t know which one he liked better. Tonys brain was going a mile a minute in a race that was already over. Clint didn’t know what to do but watch.
But he continued on towards the hallway, maybe he would see things that actually represented Tony. The doors were mostly closed, but the ones that were open were guest rooms. Maybe for Rhodey when he stayed? Or Happy? Or anyone he liked?
Steve took a deep breath, “We can be whatever you want.” He said calmly. There was no change in his face, just calm. No smile, no smug face, no heated cheeks.
He hurried towards the room where the door was open and popped his head in.
He watched Steve stare at him, then run out the room, as his own eyes began to water. The slam caused him to flinch and he couldn’t hold it together any longer. The lump was becoming undone as he chin wobbled. Tony looked around for a answer, something that told him he made the right decision. But this was just a hotel room and he was just a man, not the fucking universe.
“How’d ya get here so fast, Cap? Got wings I don’t know about? ” Tony slurred as he leaned onto Steve’s shoulder. To yes hair was messed up and going all type of ways. His shirt was wrinkled along with most of his suits
No, he wanted it to be Tony.
Tony peered to look at him. Thor could see the flash of disbelief in his eyes and how it took Tony a bit of time to actually assure that he was being truthful. Then Tony’s brown eyes sparked in delight.
He had died and was making his way to hell.
Thor spent hours sewing the scarf making sure that every thread was connected and not messy. The tips of his fingers become numb to the many needles he poked himself with, but it was worth it. Tony would forgive him and this whole situation would be swept under the rug. Thor wouldn’t have to deal with the fake “it’s okays” when passing Tony or the growing guilt.
He sat down on the soft couch. The couch that Tony provided. It caused him to hate himself more. What would his mother think of him, yelling at his sick host!
The 16th? Of December? Steve remembered looking at it once, in a file long ago- maybe it was Tony’s, and it was about . . . Howard. Yep, it was bout Howard and his wife-Maria, Steve backed up in his mind. If it caused Tony this much pain, it had to be their deaths.
The Captain needed to find answers. If Tony couldn’t trust him he’ll figure it out for himself. Each step away, his heart became more heavy, so much heavier. This terrible terrible feeling had been there since Tony did what he did and it wasn’t going to go away seeing him talking and breathing. It wasn’t going to go away that easily, it wouldn’t, and he didn’t know what to do about it. Everyday it got harder to contain, harder to know he’s feeling these types of feelings, so full of fear, without anyone caring.
bedside manner. This is me making a formal complaint on her behalf.”
He wakes up slowly, feeling well rested and content. He sighs and settles into his pillows, smiling at the faint scent of Steve on the sheets, before he sit up, startled. His bleary eyes wanders over to the clock by their bed table and he let out a groan, flopping back into the nests of pillows and rubbing a hand over his face.
“Heya there, Cap. You know, I should write you up for sleeping on the job,” Tony drawled, allowing himself to grin. It was a little forced, had too much teeth, and he wondered if Steve could tell. Probably, the bastard. He watched as Steve swallowed, his nostrils flaring a little bit as he breathed.
He makes sure his music’s up to a nice skull splitting volume, and loses himself in the shuddering of the music through his chest and the soft murmur of JARVIS as they work together on his latest project. Perfect.
“Well, it sounds like you’d be better off without me there anyways, if that’s the case,” Tony says, unable to keep out slight bitterness to his words.
Tony headed to the elevator, reaching up to rub his temples and wincing as he accidentally pulled on his sore muscles. His hands fell back to his sides. Tony tried not to think about Steve lying on a hospital bed beat to hell. It was Tony’s least favorite look on the man.
Tony walked closer to get a better look. “Are those papers, Cap? Who the hell keeps paper anything now?” He snorted.
“49 hours?!” Steve shakes his head. “I can’t even do 49 hours and
he thought,
Of course, he knew about Barnes. How could he not? Tony hopped on SHIELD’s files the second they leaked. It took him forever to find his parents’ files; he didn’t think to look for them first because why would he? For thirty years, he was convinced Howard’s heart problem was the cause of it, but to find out that it wasn’t? To find out that he was blaming the wrong man for his mother’s death for over half of his lifetime? Tony had spent a good hour in the bathroom, heaving up all the contents of his stomach.
Sweet Christ.
Tony stood up, pushing his chair back until it hit his desk with a thunk. Steve’s eyes suddenly flew up to meet his, slightly surprised by his outburst, and Tony forced himself to breath.
Time passes after that in a pleasant blur. The coffee helps oil the gears in his brain enough to remember why he wrote notes along the edge of his blueprints, but to his annoyance, he has a feeling he’s still running at half capacity regardless. He has done much more with less, and he just knows he’s going soft because of all of those nights sleeping next to Steve. That bastard. It’s probably his plan the whole time. A normal sleep schedule? Tony shudders at the thought.
“Tony, you’ll drop dead if you continue this. Don’t be so stubborn.”
. Steve probed his side with a partially annoyed partially embarrassed expression. He looked up, a rueful smile on his face.
“Even then, Bruce’s naptime isn’t much more important,” Tony snarked before shaking his head and fluttering a hand at the man. “From now on, Spangles is a top priority.” Wait. “I mean whoever is in the trauma center is top priority. Whatever, I’m leaving now.”
And Tony threw it out the first time he read it. Just barely an afterthought. How did he not see it coming?
wanted you to be. It would’ve been so easy for me if you weren’t so damn perfect. Which is another thing that baffles me. You’re so clearly invested in me when I haven’t done a whole lot to earn that. I know you’d protest, because you’re perfect like that, but come on. I’ve got a bum heart, even without the reactor, and I still can’t quite get my head under the pool I had installed on the top floor.
Steve whips his head around, pausing at the doorway.
Steve stared at him, his eyes roving over his face in that calculating way he had perfected, before he chuckled sheepishly, his hand creeping up to rub at the back of his neck.
Steve hissed suddenly, pulling away with a sharp gasp as his hand flew to his side. Tony furrowed his brow a little bit, concern drowning out the sharp bite of lust that
But that letter… it was a long time ago (and that still made his stomach clench with anger), two years, at least. A lot could change in two years. He stared at the most recent letter, muling over his choices in his mind.
“Don’t,” Steve says, his eyebrows furrowing. “How long have you been here?”
) to tell you the opposite. So, confession time: I definitely snooped. Like, went-into-your-room-to-get-clothes but-then-read-all-your-letters-to-me snooped. I’m not proud of it, but that’s mostly because it wasn’t hard; everything was just sorta out in the open. And yeah, maybe it was a dick move to do that while you were indisposed, but you don’t leave a box of papers with a man’s name on them out in the wild and not expect said man to take a peek. And if you did, you should’ve know that man sure as hell isn’t me.
“Rogers, what the hell?” Tony protests. He gets up from his chair. Well, he
“Doc! Did you come to see little ol’ me? I knew I was your favorite,” Tony said, grinning easily despite his mild unrest. The doctor didn’t react, because why would he? Tony made sure to get the best and most qualified professionals for the job, but would it kill them to lighten up a little bit?
“But I sleep better with ya’ Tony. ‘S why I came down. Even just hearing ya’s nice,” Steve says softly, and Tony groans, rubbing his face and pressing his fingers into his eyes.
He ignored the doctor’s cleanly arched eyebrow. He wasn’t paying the man to judge him.
Tony really is ruined.
“Yeah, Steve. We’re okay.”
Steve wrote.
The only thing that threw off the whole barren vibe was the box sitting on Steve’s bed. The lid was off and Tony could barely make out what was in the box from his place in the doorway. He had never seen it before. The outside of the box was decorated with ink patterns, big loops and vibrant colors. Tony couldn’t make them all out, but they were beautiful and majestic. He could tell. He once had to attend an art gallery as Pepper’s plus one and the ink work reminded him of the paintings he saw. Steve was really something else with his artistic talent and skill. The man was never shy with it and some of Tony’s favorite moments were when Steve shared his work with a soft pride, so the fact that it was his first time seeing this…
Anyways, letters. You wrote. To me. By the way, some of them? Very hurtful. I’m frustrating? You haven’t watched yourself try to figure out the microwave for the first time. Also, I’ll have you know my reckless behavior is hardly reckless because I’m a genius and have already looked at all the possible outcomes in the time your heart takes to beat. Don’t question that.
“Wouldn’ be so stuck on ya if ya’d been comin’ up to bed—” Steve begins and Tony grumbles, weakly elbowing him in the side.
Tony wasn’t kidding about his poor heart. Not that this was helping in anyway because
Even knowing how satisfied he’ll be when Steve relents, he can’t quite smother the tiny part of him that misses stumbling up to bed. Steve always seems so pleased, even if he’s asleep, and it’s… nice, being wanted like that.
“I’ve done longer.” Tony shrugs. “It’s not a big deal.”
“Where’s the fun in that?” he asked. He paused for a moment, before he rocked forward on his feet on an impulse and pressing a fleeting kiss to Steve’s lips. Steve looked surprised, the blush that had been fading coming back in full force. Tony grinned, his stomach swooping a little bit at the expression on the other man’s face. Holy shit, that had just happened; holy shit, this was going to be a
wrote Steve. What a sap. So he was growing on Tony as much as Steve was growing on him. It explained why Steve started using the kitchen. Tony
Tony swivels in his chair, already glaring at the door to his workshop, before he sputters in surprise.
“Pot, kettle,” Steve says, his voice already a little thick with sleep. He looks really comfortable, his eyes half-lidded as he watches Tony, his breathing slowing, even as DUM-E rolls by and picks up one corner of the sheets and start tugging on them lightly.
The man always complained about the hospital gowns the few times he had to wear them. Just like a petulant child. Not cute at all. Tony might as well pick his clothes up now. He leaned his against the cool surface of the elevator and sighed, trying to force his own teasing thoughts out of his head.
Steve’s thumb rubbed against the skin on his neck gently for a moment, and Tony shivered ever so slightly. Steve seemed pleased at the reaction, the nerves that were so obvious on his face settling some as Tony responded to him. Tony almost rolled his eyes.
“Come on, Tony,” Steve says. “Are you planning to sleep down here again?”
Tony shoots him a
He had him right where he wanted him, conniving son of a bitch.
Tony rubs the furrow between his brows with two fingers, grimacing slightly as he stares at the hologram in front of him. It had been making sense twenty hours ago when he had first started, but the numbers are starting to fuzz at the edges and his brain’s jumping the track a little bit.
“This is much more important,” Tony says. “My health can take it.”
Steve could lose a leg and they would all call it a scratch.
Tony snorted, his lip twitching to a smile. “Thanks for not handing me paperwork; you know how I feel about that. Formal complaints go to Maria though. How about the rest of the team?”
“Hmm. 49 hours maybe.” Tony waves his hand nonchalantly.
“God, you’re such a killjoy—” Tony began, before being cut off for a third time by Steve leaning down to press their mouths together.
She walked closer till she was close enough to poke at him.
They were just made for it each other.
The Avengers knew absolutely nothing about Tony Stark. They read the stories, the files, and heard all about him, but they knew nothing that was real about him.
“That’s oddly simple coming from you.” Bruce announced as he walked into the room. He wore a T-shirt and pajama pants other than he scientists cloak despite from coming from the lab. He sat on the floor next to Natasha, trying to get some popcorn from the redhead.
“Ok, so what are the rules?” Natasha edged on. She was eating popcorn while laying her head in Steve’s lap. Steve kinda wished it was Tony but Natasha was ok.
Clint arrived at the bar, ordered a shot of whiskey and watched the party. To be honest it was boring, just rich people chatting around trying to promote something to make more money. It didn’t seem like his or Tony’s scene. He was ready to go. Next time, Natasha could go or even Thor, just not him.
But instead, he fought the urge as always.
“Well that’s me, Mr. Simple. So are you guys in?”
“What is this? What are we really?” The blonde looked surprised at the question, eyebrows raising a fraction, but soon frozen. Then those eyebrows furrowed. Tony loved it when Steve looked this way, so deep in thought, but not now.
“Can’t seem to resist a pretty face huh?” Tony spoke suddenly, pressing on the last bandage. Their heads both leaned over to look at the hand, almost touching.
On the bright side, at least he didn’t have to wait as long as he thought.
He rushed out the door.
Tony remembered how perfectly his face fit in the crook of Steve’s neck and how good it felt, even if he was drunk. It felt as if he belonged there. But he didn’t, he never would fit anywhere with Steve. Not in his arms, not by his side, and especially not in Steve’s heart.
They had barely won that battle against doom without Iron Man, resulting in Clint being injured. If only Tony was there to catch him, like Steve ordered, but no.
Something must be wrong with Tony.
“How much did you hear?”
“Okay, but how was your day slash night? What are you out there doing without me- gambling, drinking with Nat, jumping out a windows? I need answers here, Rogers!” There was another yawn but Steve wasn’t ready to say goodnight yet.
Steve learns that Tony can paint.
It was supposed to be red.
Tony wished he would just go and let him wallow in his sadness. Not stand here and push on and ask questions of “why” and “how do you know”. Tony just knew it wouldn’t work, it was him, and he wasn’t ready to put his heart out their like that again. The man didn’t want to go home and try to glue those two heart pieces together only for it to be broken again.
At the end of the night, around midnight, Steve finally saw Tony again. He was sitting on the couch, crying. His suit was dirty with mud on the knees, and soaked. His hair had fallen down to his ears, dripping with water.
A ‘no’ was on the tips of Tony’s lips, just waiting to come out. To tell her that he needed help or what was actually going on. She could feel how much Tony needed to tell someone about what was happening. Whatever it was happening.
He had a faint feeling that something wasn’t right.
That man wanted a relationship with him.
“Yeah the bed’s made, Im waiting to mess up the room where your here to bitch about it. Can’t wait for the screaming match.” Steve could hear Tony’s laughter but it was tired, the man must have had a long day. Steve felt guilty for keeping him up, Tony never got any sleep anyway, but he didn’t want to hang up and wait all day to hear Tony’s voice again. Steve knew he was being selfish but he didn’t care. “How was your day?”
Tony just didn’t like Steve.
“I was in the neighborhood. Come on, let’s get in the car.” Steve had almost all of Tony’s weight of him, which wasn’t much, and helped him in the backseat. He buckled the seat belt around Tony’s waist before he got in the front to drive.
But Pepper wasn’t. She wasn’t born into the fame and she was doing just fine. So it couldn’t be that.
Thor could hear it. A beautiful voice, a voice that sounded as if honey was dripping down their throat just so every note could sound perfectly once leaving the mouth. It was just beautiful, so very soft and tiny that many wouldn’t hear. But it was very worth hearing and it made him want to sway. It brought a smile to Thor’s face as looked around.
Steve ignored it. Tony said he was okay so he way okay. Steve trusted his boyfriend. He would call later but he was going to give Tony some space. It was the least he could do.
“No Tony, I want you to look me in the eye and tell me you don’t want this. I’ll leave but I need you to say it.”
“No, I think you will do.”
“You broke it good this time huh. I’ll fix it later today, definitely before dinner or something.” He kept turning the iPad in his hands, like he was fighting the urge to take it apart and fix it right that instant.
Thor frowned. Why was tony so quick to shoot himself down? Why was it so easy to just assume he was terrible.
He looked at silk in his hands. It wasn’t torn too badly, it was still fixable. It was still fixable, it had to be! Everything was still fixable.
“The way I feel when I’m with you…”
Steve moved the comforter over both their bodies, placing his head in the crook of Tony’s next. He found one of Tony’s tiny hands and gave it a squeeze.
“What do you need Thor?” Bruce ran his fingers through his curls.
“Are you ok?” She asked. The women knew he wasn’t, but she needed him to say it. If he said it, he would believe it. He would actually come open about the deeper reason he was in this room. And as to why he kept it hidden.
Once on the ride there Pepper explained what they needed to do. It was quite simple, just stay together and put in a good word for the Avengers Initiative. All she kept saying is how simple this gala was supposed to be.
The words he said were shitty and harsh. Steve wouldn’t say those things to anyone else, like Thor, if they were in this situation. So why was he like this towards Tony?
Then he remembered, he was supposed to go home with Steve. Tony couldn’t handle being in a confined backseat with the blonde! He could call Steve a Uber or one of Peppers chafferers to pick him up.
The red headed had searched throughout all the floors. The work ones that held S.I, her teammates floor when she visited, even Tony’s floor when she was sneaking. But the secret department wasn’t in any of those. Natasha needed to have the one up of everyone. The feeling of not knowing when she was known for knowing everything just ticked her off. Just a bit.
“ Umm Yes,” Stark said shakily, “ Yes, we’ll be ready. You ought to talk with my CEO, Pepper Potts, who helps with the initiative and clean up.” He said a bit firmer and began to lead the Senator towards Pepper.
“I’ll be there if something bad ever happens. I’ll be on me. I’ll keep my eyes peered, I promise, just don’t do that again. Ever.”
The blanket he stole from Tony one movie night where the brunette had slept on his shoulder popped up in the mess. Steve didn’t want it anymore, he didn’t need it. He once cherished that thing, despite it being old and smelling like coffee, only because it was Tony’s. It smelled like Tony. He never wanted to give it back. But he didn’t need it anymore just like Tony didn’t need him, didn’t care about him, didn’t even think about him.
Steve couldn’t keep doing that! Tony’s hands turned into a fist under the covers as Steve continued to give soft kisses up and down his neck. The brunette glaze became watery as he tried not to react. He did want to do anything he’ll regret like kiss back or hold the mans hands. He had to stay unresponsive. Show that this wasn’t going to work. Then he could leave swiftly and form a new clear start.
“For lying.” He averted his eyes away from Steve’s. Tony didn’t know why he said that. He could have said for making Steve cry or yelling at him. He could has said he was sorry for those harsh words he spit out. But he said he was sorry for lying. Gosh, he could confuse himself without even trying.
One without swift kisses that no one else saw. One without Steve’s arms wrapped around his waist. One without the inside jokes and love filled stares. One where he was alone. Thinking about it, that wasn’t so long ago. But he had already became conditioned to being Tony with someone else. And now he had to go back to just being Tony with no one.
Tony didn’t answer but instead started to tracing Steve’s hand, wanting to remember the detail- every muscle, every hair, every wrinkle, how it felt.
If you do me this favor, I might not hover over you as much when your with Tony. Watch out for him today, okay.
And Tony just felt sadness.
“Tony?” Steve reached towards Tony’s shoulder but never touched it, Tony flinching out of the way. Steve was taken aback by that, the man always loved to be touched wether it was a pat on the shoulder or a small kiss on the cheek. Tony loved people touching him once he was comfortable. And Steve knew Tony was comfortable with him since that kiss he got that morning.
But he was going to wait up. Maybe not to see what Tony was worked up about but he sure as hell was going his hold his boyfriend as tight as he could once he laid eyes on the man.
He had been wanting Steve since forever.
Despite his trials, Tony was very encouraging towards Thor and never said something harsh. And Thor noticed that Tony smiled more now than he ever seen, not even in the lab or when he was talking about science.
Soon Tony’s chin stopped wobbling and his tears were beginning to die out; although in distress, Steve couldn’t help but acknowledge that the man still looked beautiful.
Natasha didn’t think Tony would even have time for stars. With his busy life and his recent visit, Tony shouldn’t even have this room. But here he was, staring doubtfully at the tiny balls of gas.
Steve finds out what happens when Tony is sick
“Hey Jar-“
Maybe the song was really good or Tony was just oblivious.
“Everything fine, Stark. I’m sure Pepper and Happy are close, just calm down. And my suit is fine.” Clint assured. Tony only nodded at him and went back to pacing.
Tony was a murder. No one loved him, not even his parents. He hated himself! It was all true. Tony has tried so hard to stop that thinking, just like Steve has said before, but it was impossible. He was who he was.
“I’m a mess aren’t I?” Tony let out a small laugh filled with sorrow. It was kinda hysterical, in a messed up kinda way, the last words of a very broken person.
No, he was fuming.
All his face showed was anger.
“You are very welcome. My mother taught me to sew when I was a child and I have grown very skilled in it. I am happy to be able to fix the scarf for you, anytime.”
Of course Tony had this room, for the one night stands he was famous for. The life everyone knew about before Tony had cleaned up his act about a year ago. Steve had actually read a few of them and worried that he wouldn’t be enough for the infamous Tony Stark. This man had seen everyone and been with everyone. He was an experienced lover. Steve was not. If he was given just a night with Tony in the room, Steve would cherish it for the rest of his life. He wouldn’t ask for any more or tempt his faith. That would be enough.
“You don’t have to do this you know.” Tony mumbled, touching his reactor.
“Umm hey, is there anything wrong? You know you can tell me right.” Steve asked, phone still in hand.
“The fight doesn’t matter, Tony. I’m sorry for chewing you out without getting the full story. It’s my fault.” Steve stopped him, “I won’t do it again. Promise.”
“Okay? You push me and all I get is an okay!”
The tears dripped onto his suit, mixing with the dried champagne. This wasn’t really his suit, Tony paid for it and Tony took him to get fitted. Tony invited his to this gala. Tony made the tech and Tony owned the tower and Tony provided for everyone. Tony, Tony, Tony. Everything revolved around Tony.
He didn’t know he could be so harsh.
Then Tony slapped his hand away.
“Because it’s the truth. Everyone knows it.” Steve was arms distance away. “No one wants to be with a murder. Especially one like you. Everyone hates you; I hate you. You even hate yourself. Stop being a fucking kid and wake up.” Tony could see the rage in Steve’s face. And he understood.
He had proved the team wrong. Thor could win the contest.
He didn’t like what he saw.
Steve didn’t have time for the jokes or the teasing or Tony’s pretty face or the universe deciding to have a field day with his life! As if it hadn’t been doing that since the beginning! Tony’s here, right up in his face, being soft and caring and his perfect self. He was so close but Steve couldn’t even touch him -he couldn’t even look at him. The universe had made the rules loud and clear, Tony Stark was off limits, and was now testing Steve to see if he would break them.
Thor didn’t quite understand that. Something he cherished as deeply was a heirloom of his family. He saw how deep with sorrow Tony’s face turned when it was torn. But now he speaks of his family as if he wished they never met. Thor knew Tony couldn’t really mean it. Not deeply anyway.
“Sorry I wasn’t there for the fight.” Tony mumbled as he ate his soup. He stared at the bowl, avoiding Steve’s soon to come gaze.
That was 2 days ago. 2 days of a very lonely sleep and very lonely days and Steve being a very lonely person.
Steve turned back to his boyfriend, partner as Tony would say, tear tracks still visible on his face. Tony looked small, well he always looked small, but now he incredibly small. Like a small kitten, a new born. Steve started to undress the man taking off the wet dirty tracksuit, starting with the hoodie. Tony moves his limbs making it easily for Steve, but never looking in his eyes. Steve rubbed his arms, feeling Tony’s muscles tense. His arms were soft but stiff. Steve loved touching Tony, sexual-nonsexual, he didn’t care. It was Tony.
Now to get on with the boring day.
“No, I’m sorry for being an ass boyfriend. I wasn’t there when you needed me. All these tears, my fault. I wasn’t there to pamper you or distract you or even talk to you about it. I did nothing.” Tony’s eyes began to water more. He nodded then surged into the mans arms, fast as ever.
“This is ok, right?” Tony asked glancing at his suit. He held Peppers hands in his.
Steve felt weak in the knees as his thoughts ran away from him. As Tony ran away from him. He had put himself out there for nothing, he guessed, and now here he was heartbroken. No, it was more than heartbroken- it was like grief had taken over his heart for that lonely love he held. How his love could never he paired with Tony’s love.
Tony knew he turned bright red right then and there. Gosh, why did he get like this around Steve? It used to be so easy to talk to him without blushing and be friends. They were friends right? But that seemed far far away ago. Tony then was snarky as usual, what others will expect from him. But now with Steve? He was a blushing mess and shy. Shy! When was he ever shy, Tony thought! Never but because of this man, this perfect man, Tony has surrendered.
Steve answered anyway as he shut the door to his office, worry starting to eat at him.
“Trust me, you don’t want to meet my family.  Not when they were alive anyway.” Tony scoffed as he started to fold the scarf gently.
“A crush! So who’s the lucky gal, Stark? Or guy?” Clint asked excitedly, almost spilling his cereal.
”I’m sorry okay. I’m sorry.” He face turned soft, in a way Steve had never seen before when his eyes opened a little bigger and his eyebrows raised. He looked younger, not as stressed as he always was. “I’m sorry.”
And that man wasn’t leaving anytime soon.
He was moving every few seconds, clearly in distress.  Tony was having a nightmare and they didn’t know what to do.
“Just answer the question. Do you . . . Do you think about me?”
“No your not.” Tony only stared back, no emotion in his eyes. This was worst than the look of disgust, at least Steve knew what Tony was thinking.
“Your sock drawer. Technically mine now.”
Tony plopped back in his seat in defeat.
“Is that what you think of yourself? I'm sorry to disappoint you but your not a disappointment. I’m better when I’m with you. You just make people better! You are all I want, anyone would want you, you hear me. Look at me, okay, I’m serious! You bring out the best out of everyone Tony. ” Steve stared into Tony’s eyes.
He was going to die!
“Of course I care! ” Tony yelled back, “It’s just-“. He couldn’t finish the sentence, he didn’t want to admit it. Not to Steve, not to himself, not to no one.
“You should sleep in my bed more often.” Was whispered in his ear. Tony froze but those arms still held firm against his waist. Tony wasn’t going anywhere soon even if he tried.
“Just don’t shut me out, okay?” Steve looked back at him. Tony nodded. He didn’t know if he could do that, he had to many issues that he needed to keep hidden, but he could try. Tony could always try.
All Tony needed was for the man to answer.
“Why don’t you ask him.” Tony said as he shut the door.
She could have found out about it herself, everyone knew she could, but Natasha thought they were friends enough for her to know about his life without sneaking. The redhead hadn’t sneaked he was dying of poison, not counting the planetarium. That was a discovery.
He needed to stop crying. God he needed to stop crying and stop thinking and stop existing. Everything would be easier if he was gone. Not dead but just gone. Then maybe his heart wouldn’t be ripping to pieces because of Steve.
He just, he just couldn’t do this anymore.
To know that he needed to wake up. And to wake up seemed like torture. It was so perfect not knowing who he was next to, and so much less trouble. Tony didn’t need to have to talk about anything with his eyes closed. And that was fine by him.
Whoa, two chapters in two days?! That’s crazy!!!! I’m excited about this one guys
Thor walked towards the voice making sure he walked softy as not to disturb. The closer he got the more clear the voice became adding to its beauty.
“Well I guess that’s it. I don’t really know anything else, and don’t tell Clint I said that. Then he’ll be on my back too. I can’t handle both Clint and Steve. I’ll be chaos. Well, see you later Thor.”
All Steve knew is that he had a smile on his face when he finally fell towards the pit black darkness.
Steve was going to kill him!
“I don’t want anything to do with you anymore.”
And that wasn’t enough for Steve.
“Well, I had just came to see if you can fix my iPad again. But I think I found something much better!” Steve said very excited! He moved towards the vacant stool and sat next to the man.
“Tell me about them.”
“You’ve heard what?” Tony tried rub the sleep out of his eyes as he sat by the counter next to Steve. It was too early in the morning for this, talking about love and his crush and what not. Tony just wanted breakfast, he had woken up early for breakfast which he almost never does, and they bombard him with talk of love.
Maybe he could make friends.
Maybe the devil just wanted him to hurt his feet on the way down as if he wasn’t going to burn them at hell.
It was familiar. And it what nightmare were made of.
Steve heard a ding across the room, most likely his phone and hopped on the bed. It was from Rhodey and it made him wince. Steve could sense the vibe that Rhodey didn’t like him. They were acquaintances before he started dating Tony but once that happened, friendly Rhodey was gone. The Rhodey Steve received watched his every move. It creeped him out.
But Tony guessed he should have done it for himself rather than for Steve.
“Thanks Hap.” Tony said a little shakily.
The morning came too soon.
“No ones going to look at your socks. And you hair looks fine, just trust me.” Pepper gave him a small smile, trying to get Tony to believe her. She then pulled away but still held his hand, leading him towards the elevator. He looked like a child scared to go to his first day of school. It was wild.  Clint knew Tony couldn’t be freaking out this bad. He had been during this since he became CEO! No, Tony had been doing this his whole life. Clint just had no idea what was going on. He just knew Tony couldn’t be freaking out that badly.
“Your painting done now. What are you going to do with it?” Steve asked with amusement in his eyes, crossing his arms.
Keep your eyes on Tony please. Today’s a hard day.
That what’s hells all about anyway.
Tony stayed in that floor for a while, sobbing as he tried to catch his breath. There was a constant pain but he was grateful; the arc reactor was back. All of that was a dream.
“I want you to be happy. And you can’t do that if your thinking all those evil things about yourself Tony. I’ll still be here when you’re ready.”
“Jarvis didn’t tell me ok,” Tony finally sighed, done with the fight,” He didn’t tell me so I wasn’t there.”
“No, just . . . keep talking, your voice helps me sleep.”
“Gee thanks, but let’s get you to bed and we’ll talk more about my muscles tomorrow.” Steve kicked them door open and reached to move the covers. He placed Tony on the bed to remove his shoes and jacket.
Tony has made it to Steve’s door, just looking at the white wood. What was he going to say? What if Steve didn’t wake up? What if he actually did wake Steve up? Would Steve kick him out and send him on his way? Tony didn’t want to seem any more like a burden than he already was and was this pushing the limit? He looked a mess and now was interrupting the soldiers sleep because he couldn’t cope on his own.
“The way I feel when I’m with you” Steve had said. Tony wondered what he was going to say. Steve couldn’t have actually wanted to be with him, but what if he said was something good. Something to make Tony’s heart beat faster or swell with warmth? Maybe Steve had actually meant that kiss? Maybe Steve actually wanted to be with him?
He was sleeping! While they were fighting!
“Umm Tony, you in here? No way!” Steve was shocked.
“It was my mother’s you know. My Gramdma made it for her when she found out she was pregnant with me. I’ve only seen my grandmother a few times, every time we went to Italy. She was always sweet and we always picked flowers in her garden. This is all I had left. Of both of them.” Tony explained. He held the mended scarf as if it was his lifetime.
He didn’t go on.
Oh god, Tony was drunk!
“Am I evil?” Tony whispered sleepily. His eyes were closed and breathing was steady for such a big question. Steve was suddenly alert; why would he ask such a thing?
Well, now he had something to bring to the team.
If only he could breathe.
Steve was baffled. Yes, he wanted to pick a fight and yes, now thinking about it would lead to something big between the two. But he didn’t expect that result. He didn’t expect Tony to give unto defeat.
“Don’t say anything, okay. Don’t even tell Clint. He’ll never get off my back.”
“The real question is what your doing here?”
Steve stared at Tony’s face, noticing it was no longer red and full of worry lines. The man looked peaceful for once, younger. Happier. Steve wanted to commit the image to his mind, just so he could have it to look back on. Gosh, he loved this man. He just wished Tony knew it.
All Tony did was clutch the blanket harder.
He was a cute mess. Only Tony Stark could wear the title cute mess so greatly.
He told Tony not to worry while his increased quickly, like a hypocrite. Steve had never heard Tony sound like that, so soft and scared. And Tony had never asked Steve for help like this, he barely even spent time with Steve. It didn’t make any senses The Captain had a good reason to be worried, but he wasn’t going to make Tony worried about calling him or make him think that Steve wouldn’t be there to help him.
“You know I love you.” Steve confirmed, eyes laced with worry, as he squeezed one of Tony’s hands.
The man plopped down on the couch next to Nat with a sigh. He ran his hands over his face and yawned, catching a glance of Natasha’s shit eating grin.
“Well Mr. Rogers, Sir is ill at this time. Excessive use of the suit can cause the reactor to become overheated, which can result in death. Per my programming, my priority is to keep Sir safe at all times.” Jarvis spat.
Steve moves towards his boyfriend, the comforter still wrapped around his shoulders, taking small steps. He sat next behind the man and slowly started to caress Tony’s waist. The man was cold to the touch, it was so foreign, so weird.  Tony was always warm, always, it didn’t make sense. Everything was fine yesterday, Tony was fine. Nothing happened during the night, nothing Steve knew about, and yesterday was good. Better than good, actually.
“We need to talk.” Tony whispered, eyes still shut and fist still tight. Steve stopped the soft kisses and removed his arms, sitting up in the bed.
Last time Steve saw him, Tony was going to a S.I meeting. If he has time to do that, Steve thought, then why wasn’t he at the battle? Tony had a responsibility to the team too, you know! It wasn’t hard to show up when the rest of the team could. It wasn’t hard to do your goddamn job!
Suddenly Tony felt Steve’s lips crash into his, so quick and smooth. His face soon relaxed into the kiss, wishing for more as Steve wrapped his arm around his waist. It felt good. It was good. Finally Steve pulled away and moved his hand to hold Tony’s face. They stared into each other eyes; Tony mind raced to the thought Steve was going to take everything that he said back and his fear spiked. If Steve would take all that back, after that kiss, Tony wouldn’t survive it.
All Steve would do was sit there and wait till Tony was ready. He would listen to every heartbreaking sob that tore at his heart before he left this couch. He will wait to see that last year fall down Tony’s face before he left.
The man threw the covers off and slowly made his way toward the door. He tried to wipe the sleep out of his eyes, opening the door to see- Tony!
The room was a bit big for the small man. The neutral colors didn’t seem like the Tony Steve knew. There was a couch, a mini fridge and a coffee machine. That must be the reason Tony could survive in here for a couple of days.
Steve was upset.
"You're adorable, but you talk too much," Tony shrugs, trying to act cool despite being jittery with butterflies. "I like you, too."
"Honestly, I'm not even mad."
That question, however, is forgotten when Tony sees the horrified look on Bucky's face. The soldier is glistening with sweat, jaws clenched as he tries to fight off the pain. No. Tony will not let him die. He will not die. Tony refuses to lose him.
"Did I miss something?" A voice echoes from across the lab making Tony jump away from Bucky instantly out of shock rather than shame.
"Big man in a suit of armor, take that off and what are you?" Steve spits out angrily and all heads turn towards the kitchen; Steve and Tony arguing is no surprise but this one seems to be worse than usual.
caught up in the lab that you can't spend some time with the team?" Steve yells at Tony, his voice laced with pure anger and disgust. The younger man was used to this though; after all, this isn't the first time he's been yelled at.
Neither Steve nor Tony move to sit down, avoiding eye contact altogether. Of course this is something the team would do, especially Clint. Not only are they fed up with their fighting, but they love to pull a good prank especially at Steve and Tony's expense.
"And what do you have to say about that, Steve?"
"How do we even know what they're going to ask?" Steve asks still just as nervous as before. "How do you even prepare for an interview?"
"Just this once," he sighs contently and Tony silently gushes over how adorable his sleepy boyfriend looks.
"I've made a lot of choices that have gotten me here," Bucky whispers, giving into the idea that he's going to die. "I deserve this. I deserve to die."
It's been a few weeks since Bucky moved into the tower and to say things have been a little tense between the Brooklyn super-soldiers would be an understatement. It has been driving Tony up a wall having his boyfriend always stressing about the ex-winter soldier and the latter wanting anything but an interaction with the younger blonde.
"Okay, but seriously, is Steve mad that Tony won't hang out with us or him?" Bruce looks away from the video game for a split second, trying to gauge everyone else's feelings on the subject.
"Stop movin'," Steve mumbles and pulls Tony closer into his side making the younger man sigh.
"A joke, too? I didn't know you had it in you."
And Bucky does love the small brunette. He doesn't know when it happened but somewhere in between watching Tony work in the lab rambling aimlessly about equations and theories Bucky will never be able to understand  and watching him be the most compassionate person not only to Steve but to the other Avengers, Bucky fell hard.
There's a beat of silence between the two before Steve's eyes glow dark blue with mischief and he stands up, Tony instantly mirroring his actions.
“I can’t lose you guys okay.” Tony spoke so quietly that Steve almost didn’t hear.  That . . . that wasn’t what he expected. At all. “If- if one of you get hurt and it’s my fault, I couldn’t deal with myself. I just couldn’t and I won’t let it happen.”
Where was he?
“I  think I’m in love with you. I want you. Only you. I want a relationship, a real one. If. . . if you want one or- or. . .“ Steve trailed off at the end. The red in his cheeks made a appearance but Tony heard but he needed to hear.
“Wait, I have a job. I’m Iron Man. I . . . I can’t be doing one night stands anymore.”
“No you don’t. Going out leads to dates which leads to a relationship. And you don’t want that with me.” Tony brushes off gently as he went back to work. He wasn’t going to give into false hope although his heart fluttered at the idea.
Steve was terrible.
Clint was shocked at this. Tony Stark, freaking out at a party, his once favorite scene. It didn’t make sense, but at last it was happening. He didn’t quite understand it but Clint could at least help calm Tony down.
But Steve kept talking. He talked about the many times he had gotten his ass handled to him, his adventures in New York before he froze; they were all very happy. Steve could hear Tony’s heartbeat slowing down and his breaths becoming longer. The stories were working. Tony soon closed his eyes.
After a while, he was ready to set his apology plan a go. Steve just wished Tony would let him say sorry and not kick him out. He took a deep breath before knocking on the door.
“All Midguardians are tiny and adorable, but Anthony is the most adorable” Thor thought. They continued to study the art of singing for another half and hour, only ended when Tony’s ‘Oldies’ playlist was over.
“Yeah sure. That’s not gonna stop me from feeling like a little bitch, Steve.” Tony mumbled through the tears.
Tony let out a sigh, a good release that clearly affected his body, Steve hearing shuffling around through the speakers.
“For what exactly?” Steve snapped.
“Yeah I do.” He whispered and squeezed their hands.
“Ok, I’ll make sure America isn’t disappointed.” He nodded. Tony smiled.
Totally different than comfort.
At dinner the iPad was fixed and everything was back to normal, as if Tony decided to forgot all about the sexual tension in the room. But Steve was ok with that, for he remembered and he wouldn’t forget that moment. And he knew Tony wouldn’t forget that.
With his workout already done, Steve was off the Shield to do paperwork that the others had bribed him to do- 50$ bucks each. It was painstakingly long, Steve finishing at lunch.
Tony just died of embarrassment right then and there. How the hell did he end up here? Last he remembered was telling Steve goodnight before going to his own bed.  Alone, so very alone. He looked pathetic and he knew it. No one had seen Tony like this, all cuddly and small. No one! But Steve had caught him in the act red handed.
She saw the dark bags under his eyes and how tightly he had wrapped the blanket
“Ok but you can’t tell Steve that I taught you. He’ll have this over my head for years!”
Tony followed loosely behind but stayed at the door when Steve hopped into the bed. Steve recognized that Tony must have been shy or something because he had to pat the bed for Tony to hop in. The man stayed on the edge of the bed, and indulged himself in blankets.
He jogged to a stop behind the blood, giving a tiny smile. The man was wearing normal attire, jeans and a t-shirt, probably one too tight for his own good. The man looked beautiful, even in his everyday attire.
Natasha soon saw a hazy vision of a tiny body curled on what seemed to be a bean bag.
Steve looked back towards the team. Then back at Tony. “What do I do?” repeated in his mind, “Oh what do I do” He continued to lightly shake Tony, until he popped up real fast. The whiplash could have knocked Steve out.
Which lead Steve right in front of Tony’s door.
He knew Tony wanted it!
He pushed the thought out of his mind as he exited the hotel room, hoping that no would see him. The red face and the blotchy eyes; he looked a mess. God, he hoped no one was out there or his life will be ruined. The media could tear him apart if they got a picture of him looking like this.
“It really doesn’t matter anymore.” Tony took the box from Steve, “I just came to get the rest of my stuff and then I’m out of your hair. Indefinitely.” Tony moved past Steve, picked up his last box full of clothing and socks: all the stuff he found in between Steve’s stuff in their pile of clothes in the corner. Theirs, it was theirs, and now there wasn’t even a them. It was Steve and there was Tony, never to be connected again.
What was wrong with him?
All he could see was his own anger.
“Is there anything I can do to help it go faster?”
“I come here when things get too much. Or when I need to stop thinking. Just something to remind me that it’ll be ok, I think. Maybe. I don’t know, but I know it’s safe.” He blurted looking a his hands, he spared at glimpse at Natasha, eyes full with a pinch of fear.
They sat in the living room on communal floor, prepping. Well Clint was sitting and Tony was prepping as cartoons played on the T.V. Tony wasn’t watching but running his hands through his hair as he paced. Clint could feel the stress radiating from that pacing and he couldn’t believe it.
“But they have their songs to keep them alive, I guess. Just like you have your tech and screens to keep your name alive. But I would need you to teach me more about these people that are long gone.”
“Can you shut up for once in your life?” Steve interrupted. Tony’s month closed instantly as his face fell.
“Stargazing at a ceiling.” He said chuckled, not halfheartedly but more depressed. All guards were gone, Nat sensed, and he had nothing to hide. He never had anything to hide when with Natasha for he knew she would find out anyway. But there was also this unspoken trust between the two, that Tony didn’t have with the rest of the team. Not even with Bruce. Natasha didn’t have the relationship with Clint such like this, so she cherished his openness.
She shrugged and sat in the bean bag next to him.
Natasha helps Tony escape a date
Thor nodded his thanks and byes, then settled in to watch Tv.
“Don’t tell me to keep calm! I won’t do this again Tony. I can’t!” Steve glanced away.
Well.
“ That’s it. Your amazing Steve, really.” Tony thanked the blonde. This was the first time he had called Steve by his name, not Cap or Rogers or Capsicle. He liked the way Tony said his name, so nice and slow.
“You know I do.”
”That’s what I was hoping for if you didn’t shut me down so quickly. I,at least, wanted to try. I kinda thought you did too.” Steve muttered under his breath as he scratched his head in embarrassment.
He opened the door. There Steve was, on the ground, head in his knees.
This wasn’t one of their easy come easy to arguments, this was serious. If they couldn’t count on each other to be there, then what team are they?
He lowers his hands, wincing at the loud music. Steve doesn’t understand the 21st Century and all the Leds and the Zeppelins. How can anybody focus with such chaotic music on? His super hearing certainly doesn’t help. He makes a mental note to show Tony music from the good old days, The Ink Spots and Buddy Rich. Much more soothing.
Tony scowls, refusing to be charmed. It’s going to take a lot more than Steve looking sleepy and content in their bed for him to be distracted from his precious work.
Steve tries to not let it bother him. He understands that Tony has his work, but it’s a nice system to wake up to each other every morning.
“It’s been there this whole time,” Tony says, answering Steve’s silent question. “Didn’t appreciate waking up in a different place last time.”
I can’t write dear seriously. Not that you aren’t dear to me! In fact, I’m writing you (honestly Rogers,
Steve wouldn’t die from wearing a scratchy hospital gown for a week; Tony hoped it’d give him hives) and then maybe cool off.
“Really, Rogers? I brought you clothes, you ungrateful ass, you couldn’t have at least—” Tony began, but he paused abruptly, just about swallowing his tongue as Steve stepped closer, hesitant but hopeful, so damn hopeful. God, Steve only ever looked at him like that in his dreams. Was he dreaming? He better not be. Although, if this was a dream, by now he would probably be half-naked and bent over—
“Cap, when I said we should spice up our life in the bedroom, I didn’t mean we should move our bedroom to some place more exciting. I mean, workshop sex would be great, maybe a little messy, but you always did like me a little messy—” Tony begins, rambling away as he watches Steve set his jaw and drag the mattress all the way over until it’s laying next to Tony’s desk.
“Well, good luck sleeping, I’m not gonna be quiet,” Tony threatens, turning back towards his holograms with a stubborn grimace on his face. He hears Steve chuckle, warm and fond.
He stared blankly at his screens for a moment before he jerked up from his chair, the sound of someone stomping in his ears. Well. That was fast. He fell back into his chair, twisting, as he watched as Steve burst into his workshop, the man’s face a brilliant shade of red. He was clutching Tony’s letter in his hand.
“Don’t think you’re getting away with going through my things while I was indisposed,” Steve said, and Tony sputtered, much to Steve’s amusement.
bad. And what Steve didn’t know wouldn’t kill him. Tony wasn’t going to help HYDRA on that front, no thank you.
“This… you wrote this?” Steve asked, barely able to keep his voice steady. Tony arched an eyebrow, and the pretty flush on Steve’s face turned a touch darker.
“How’s my team, Doc? Everyone’s in one piece?” he asked, clapping his hands together. He slid off the bed, wincing at the movement. It put weight on his torso and he could really feel those cracked ribs now.
“I… Okay, Tony. I just think you’re real swell, and I don’t want to—” Steve started up again, and Tony groaned, pressing fingertips to his forehead. God, Steve and his insistence on treating him properly like some classy gentleman. Please.
. Grew up hearing about you like you were the second coming. So yeah, a lot of hero-worship there and then a whole lot of bitterness and come to think of it, I projected a lot onto a guy I never really met, but that was totally okay because you were definitely dead. Except not dead. Not dead, and not as much as an asshole as I really,
Tony snaps his fingers and points to a corner of the lab. Steve follows his hand and frowns.
“I thought you’d be more comfortable,” Steve says, his voice barely audible to his own ears. Was that a mistake then? He crosses his arms, the V between his eyebrows pinching.
He’s just getting in the zone when he hears a thudding outside of his workshop. Jesus, whatever that is has to be loud enough to pierce his little slice of heaven, and that is
“We’re still talking about it,” Steve said firmly, and Tony groaned.
to get up from his chair. There’s a beginning, certainly, but he collapses forward, his arms catching the table.
addressed to him. Maybe Steve was just waiting to deliver them. Reading just one wouldn’t be
Like another betrayal. Yes, there was anger, and sadness, but the betrayal of it stung worse than anything else. How long would Steve have waited to tell him if Tony had never went digging himself. Never?
“M’kay, JARVIS, pull up the first prototype for me one more time.”
He allowed Steve his moment of control, before he smirked mischievously to himself and pressed forward, swiping his tongue against hesitant lips. Steve let out a noise, parting his mouth slightly, and Tony took it as an invitation.
“Don’ need it if it convinces ya to come to bed,” Steve says, pulling the covers back and smiling softly. It’s partially teasing, but it’s also mildly pleading and fuck him, that bastard. He sighs, and can see the exact moment where Steve realizes he’s relenting. He smirks, and Tony glares, stabbing a finger at him.
Steve’s motherly henness was coming out and what do you know, he was right.
First off, fuck you for not telling me about Barnes. Second off, I’m not an idiot, of course I went through those files as soon as I heard Fury’s daycare went viral. Third off, I understand. I don’t like it, and I’m going grumble about it under my breath for a couple of months, but I understand. I’m not as brave as you seem to think I am. Cowardice is my specialty, Cap. It’s why I’m writing instead of saying something. So, I guess maybe we aren’t that different. Except that I actually gave you this letter, so I’m definitely one upping you there.
Tony tilted his face up invitingly, glaring at Steve slightly even as he did so, and Steve chuckled lightly. “You can’t blame me, Cap, they were just sitting there! With my name on them. You would’ve done the same, if it had been my super secret box,” Tony accused, and he grinned a little bit when Steve looked away a little sheepishly. Tony dithered for a moment, before he stepped forward until their chests were brushing. Steve’s eyes snapped back to him, and the faint dusting of pink across his cheekbones deepened slightly. He hid his delight with a tiny smirk.
I know I should’ve told you, I wanted to, I did I’m—” Steve stuttered through, before he cut himself off, his mouth a tight line. He was still staring determinedly at the letter as if it held the words he wanted to say, and Tony shook his head. This wouldn’t do. He was pretty sure they were just getting somewhere.
“And what about the good Captain? Is he giving the poor nurses a heart attack again?” Tony asked, running a hand through his hair. The doctor stared at him for a moment, before he shook his head once.
“‘S okay, used to ya snorin’ after all,” Steve says, the Brooklyn twang becoming more pronounced as he yawns. Tony scoffs, both to protest and to ignore the affectionate feeling settling just below his ribs.
“You are ridiculously stubborn, you know that?” Tony drawls and Steve arches an eyebrow at him, his blue eyes sparkling with mirth.
He rolls his chair back, running his hands through his hair as he shuffles over to the coffee machine hooked up in the little kitchenette next to his cot. DUM-E beeps curiously, his arm twitching up to assist, and Tony grumbles and swats him away.
“Again, been over this. I checked ‘yes’ on your little love note Steve. I know all about how ‘swell’ you think I am; Jesus, you defrosted like what five years ago? Whatever, you know what else is swell?” Tony asked, shifting a little bit as he walked slowly over to stand in front of Steve. Steve watched him carefully, his expression guarded and mildy nervous, his throat bobbing as he swallowed. And wasn’t that just delicious, how he was affecting Steve? He dug his teeth into his bottom lip to stop his smile, feeling an incredible mix of giddiness and terror. He was used to seduction, but this was
“Maybe focus more on trying not to end up here in the first place,” Steve said, his lips pursed in a poor imitation of his Serious Steve face. Tony waved his hand.
Tony’s heart worked double time as he examined Steve’s face, working to keep his own expression easy and relaxed. Sure he was failing, but at least Steve looked too flustered to pick up on it.
The doctor looked down at his clipboard with a sigh. “Black Widow is fine. So is Hawkeye. He’s getting his ankle wrapped and complaining about it, of course, to the point that the nurse wants to complain about
about Steve, but he was still a complete dork. A really really
The box was full of letters. Letters to the team. Tony sifted through a few of them, his curiosity mounting. There was at least one addressed to all of them, but a vast majority were to Tony, and he wasn’t sure exactly how he felt about that. Were all of these from his time in D.C? Why hadn’t anybody gotten them? Were they not meant to know?
“You damn hypocrite. You always force me to stay! Even when I have really important work to do,” Tony accused, but he really couldn’t care less. There was a lightness to him that he hadn’t felt since waking up from the shrapnel removal.
Other times, it was darker, sadder, commenting on how sometimes being with the team reminded him a little too much of the Howling Commandos, and yet not familiar enough to be comforting. Tony’s heart clenched a little bit at those, but he didn’t want to stop. He was learning so much about Steve and all he wanted to do now was to learn even more. Sure this was a little unorthodox, but Steve was like one of those irritating puzzles that you couldn’t quite figure out. Tony hated those. They were an insult to his intelligence.
Tony watched as Steve turned and started walking towards the entrance to his workshop, before turning back when he reached the door. Tony tilted his head in inquiry, and Steve sighed softly. He paused, worrying his bottom lip with his teeth for a moment, before he looked up at Tony.
“Right away, sir.”
” Tony amended with a huff, “but I definitely meant this. What I wrote. Work with me here, Cap.” He waved a hand around as if to gesture to the whole situation. Steve looked back down at the letter in his hands, scrutinizing it carefully (was he really reading it
Tony read the letter again before he folded it up and tossed it onto the box’s lid. He ached with emotional turmoil, anger being the strongest player, running through his mind. It was bitter in the back of his throat, indignation and fury mixing together and forming something acidic that made it hard to swallow. He took a breath, shutting his eyes.
Tony’s heart stopped; his jaw dropped. He looked at the last line of the letter, eyes widening by the millisecond. His mouth worked to say something, but whatever it had in mind died in the back of his throat with a strangled sound. He lied back on the bed, putting a hand to his head, still clutching the letter.
but he comes close. He’s so tired of this. He’s so tired of seeing Tony tired and not in bed.
Steve looks at the clock. It’s 11 o’clock and the left side of their bed is empty. Again. Because Tony’s down in the lab. Again. Third time too and last time, Tony literally fell asleep at his desk. They went over this already, didn’t they? Steve does have superhuman memory so he’s pretty sure they did, but Tony just has to be Tony and stay downstairs. Again. He sighs and sits up, swinging his feet off the edge of the bed. Steve doesn’t know which is worse, going down there and finding Tony tinkering away at his gadgets or finding him asleep there. He tucks his feet into his slippers and heads down to the basement.
and Steve rolls his eyes. Sure, he of all people probably shouldn’t be saying that, but Tony’s taking the cake in acts of stubbornness. 49 hours. What kind of man—?
“I’ll be fine, Grandpa,” Tony sasses. “I have JARVIS and the coffee pot.”
Tony snaps his fingers and points to the cot again. Steve huffs. It’s no king bed, not like the one they have in the bedroom. How can Tony be comfortable in that small thing? He shakes his head and starts heading out the lab.
“Fuck it. I’m already going to hell,” he said to himself as he unfolded the next letter. And again, what Steve didn’t know, wouldn’t kill him.
Oh well. Nothing that coffee can’t fix.
“JARVIS? Steve’s floor.”
“Did you… did you mean it?” Steve asked quietly, his blue eyes intense as he held Tony’s gaze, looking serious, far too serious for Tony’s tastes. Dammit, his eyes weren’t supposed to be so big. Only Tony’s eyes were allowed to be that big. Tony stared at him, his lips parting slightly with surprise, before he recovered, fumbling a little over his words.
I still can’t believe that. I have graphite on my hands, Steve.
“Right away, Sir.”
with my
Tony exhaled with shaky breaths. He rolled over, the side of his head flat against Steve’s sheets. Steve’s sheets that smelt like him. All the looks that Steve gave him, they made sense now. How he swallowed his words sometimes when Tony was around. Even when it was just the two of them. How many times had Steve tried to tell him? How many moments did Tony let go? When he didn’t press on, wrangle the dying words from behind Steve’s lips?
. He… fuck. Fuck this. He barely has the energy to untangle all of these emotions in his head. Time went from him. He needed to get Steve his clothes (but did he need to after
Well. He doesn’t need sleep to be a genius, and he certainly doesn’t need
Tony threw his hands behind his head, leaning back precariously in his chair as he stared at the holograms in front of him. He knew he couldn’t focus on them now. It was just for show even though he had no one to fool, but himself. JARVIS had alerted him when Steve had woken up, so there was a large chance the other man had read the stupid letter he wrote. Or was in the process of reading it, or maybe he got three paragraphs in and ripped it up. (Tony knew Steve probably wouldn’t do that, he’s too much of a nice guy, but Tony was starting to have some regrets and almost hoped that Steve would).
He chewed on the inside of his cheek; if Steve found out about this, he’d be pissed as hell. Tony scanned the letter again, before glancing back at the others in the box. He dithered for a moment, before he put the letter beside his hip and reached for the next. In for a penny, in for a pound.
Steve in the trauma center? That must’ve been one hell of a hit to put him down for the count like that. Tony tried to ignore the little tendril of worry that unfurled in his gut. It was Steve; he should be fine.
Tony dropped his head into his hands, shaking. He swallowed hard and took a deep breath. He wanted to throw up again, knowing that Steve
Tony pressed his palms into his eyes, feeling the letter brush against his cheek, teasing him. God, this was too much. He was so fucked. And Steve still wasn’t awake. Tony was feeling more and more like a heel the more time passed. There was no way he could keep this from Steve. He… he didn’t
He sat up on the bed and hunched over, his eyes tracking up and down the letter on his lap. Steve
You have a computer, you heathen,” Tony said, and Steve huffed, rolling his eyes up in that fondly exasperated way he did.
“Captain Rogers is currently being monitored by the trauma team. He was the closest one to the blast, per my report, and took more damage than the rest of you,” the doctor said.
“Go. I’ll come up in a minute,” Tony said, softening his voice slightly. Steve smiled warmly, and Tony just barely stopped himself from launching himself at Steve again. Injured. Needed to go to medbay. They could have crazy super sex later.
It was just Steve. Well, there was nothing
Tony absently rubbed a hand over his mouth, feeling that special kind of bone deep wariness only really present after a tough fight. He sat on the edge of one of the medbay tables, trying to keep his leg from jiggling. He really did want to remain as still as possible as the nurse wrapped his ribs up, but he was antsy. The fight hadn’t been as clean as he wanted it to be, and he had lost sight of some of the others before the final explosion and he wanted to make sure they were all okay. Damn these stupid Hydra raids; they were simple until they weren’t.
“That’s bullshit, Rogers, and you know it,” Tony said, jabbing a finger at him. Steve narrowed his eyes at him, before his expression softened slightly, running a hand through his hair. Tony gleefully thought about all of the things he might be able to get away with now, before realizing he was just as fucked as Steve eyed him carefully with a tiny pleased smile.
“Not a word,” Tony threatens. Steve mimes zipping his lips with a grin, and Tony squints at him warningly. He stumbles out of his chair, blinking hard as his world tilts dangerously for a moment. He rights himself and shuffles over, before crumpling down onto the mattress, grumbling a little bit as soon as Steve’s arm comes down to claim him, tugging him until his back hits his chest.
Tony paused, hand still in his hair, and gave the doctor a
Right in front of him?) before he smiled shyly. Tony’s heart jumped to his throat; fuck fuck fuck, he was so fucked.
Steve sighs. “Promise me that you’ll go to sleep,” he says, a last resort for tonight.
He wasn’t sure if it was possible to put “kissing Steve” and “bad” in the same context. It was like Steve was just testing, fumbling a little bit, but sweet, and growing more confident the longer Tony stayed put. Tony would have loved to be pressed up against his workbench in a dirty and selfish kiss, but he found he was quite content to stay put as long as Steve wanted, because as much as he complained to himself about the speed, his knees were starting to turn to jello. God, Steve was turning him into some sort of sappy teenager. Disgusting.
Tony takes a sip of the coffee sitting by his elbow. It’s cold, and obviously burnt, but he can’t care less. This little sleepless streak is getting ready to hit 58 hours, and whatever’s left of his brain is going towards his work, not towards good coffee.
and didn’t tell him. Didn’t think that maybe this was something Tony deserved to know, no matter how unsure Steve was? Sure, it took them awhile to become friends, but they were still friends even then, right? This just… this just really hurt.
There, clear as day on the top of the papers, was his name. He walked closer, warring with his moral conscience. Tony’s eyes widened as he stopped by the bed, resting his thighs lightly on it as he reached out a hand.
Who the fuck knew at this point? He didn’t want Steve to know he knew, but all gloves were off the next time he’d see him, he just knew it. Maybe he’d get roaring drunk and doubly disappoint Steve. Well, at least they’ll both be feeling mutually disappointed and betrayed.
“Rogers, please. I don’t have the time to roleplay as your damsel in distress right now,” Tony says, getting up again. He grabs the chair and stops in his tracks, wavering in his stance.
“And you saved that for last,
“I…. Tony, about… About Bu- Barnes and- and your
“You’re been working non-stop for 49 hours,” Steve says heatedly. “Anybody who’s waiting for that are asleep right now. You’re allowed to take a rest.”
But Steve has to go and be an asshole and now he needs to prove a point. What a dick. Really, why are they fucking again?

He gets out of his head. Tony’s still tinkering away at whatever he’s doing and Steve knows it’s a futile effort now to convince Tony to go upstairs with him. Force won’t help either. He had only gotten away with carrying the man because he was asleep.
, there was the needy Steve he had read about. It made him grin against Steve’s mouth, sure if he were to pull back and take a look, Steve would appear ruffled and surprised and perfectly debauched just from a little kissing. That image alone had Tony groaning and swaying forward, his hands reaching out to grip Steve by his hips.
“‘Course I did, I never say anything I don’t mean,” Tony said. Steve raised one eyebrow in a perfect condescending arch, his lips quirking up in an amused half smile. He hated that that expression amused him as much as it annoyed him, but he was glad when he felt some of the uncomfortable tension melt away.
“Can you turn back on the music for me?” Tony asks.
The dark bags under Tony’s eyes are almost big enough to be classified as an entirely new organ. And speaking of Tony’s eyes, he can barely keep them open, his eyelids shaking in the effort to keep up. Tony turns away from him, uncharacteristically silent.
“If you won’t come up to bed, then I’ll come down to you,” Steve says, throwing the sheets back and sliding onto their mattress. Tony watches, his eyebrows raised as Steve wiggles to get comfortable before turning on his side to stare up at Tony. He pulls the covers up to his chin, and Tony can’t help but snort; he looks ridiculous. There’s no way Captain America’s allowed to look that petulant while doing something as asinine as sleep in the middle of Tony’s workshop.
Tony looked at the valediction and rolled his eyes fondly.
He bit his lip, before taking the most recent letter out and unfolding it. God, this was such a bad idea, but he wasn’t sure when the last time he had a good idea was and somehow he was still standing, so there was that. He started reading, his brows furrowed as he braced for impact.

“And, if things work out, you can’t be mad at me. If I hadn’t snooped, you would go on angsting about how hot you are for me in letters, Steve.
He grumbles and forces his wandering thoughts away from Steve and towards his work. That’s why he was down here after all; creating world changing technology took time and commitment and genius, all things Tony has and can use.
to keep it from Steve. And wasn’t that a scary realization?
Feel satisfied, he straightened up, the clothes thrown into the crook of his elbow. He glanced up in the mirror on the way up, and suddenly paused, squinting at the reflection of the box in the mirror. He turned, eyeing the box curiously.
Steve’s face hardened suddenly, and something like remorse and shame crossed his features, and Tony felt his shoulders tensing up.
Okay, enough of that. Gross. I feel naked, and not in the fun way. Ug god, this is hard. How did you write so many of these? Not important I guess. I feel like I’ve talked in circles and not gotten anywhere. You, against all odds, really like me. And I, obviously, because who wouldn’t, really like you. Oh my god, this is so stupid. I can’t believe I just wrote that. This is really junior high for both of us, Steve. Just, hurry up and read this and come kiss me or something fuck.
“Yeah sure, I guess.” Steve answered, although it sounded like a question. He started to shake Tony gently on the arm. Should he actually be waking up someone from a nightmare? Is that actually ok? Does that cause some type of damage? Is it safe?
I lost motivation to do a 5&1 fic but I did this
“I’m coming, I’m coming.” Croaked a hoarse voice. The captain didn’t detect it, blind with his rising anger.
“You might like this.” Steve picked up the paint brush and looked at Tony for permission. He gave a nod and Steve started to paint.
“I need sewing supplies to fix the scarf.
“God Nat, don’t do that.,” he breathed in, “How you find me?”
Someone who would support or end the Avengers.
He didn’t care who it was. They were doing him a favor from actually looking at his hand and coming to peace with the reality of things. Steve was going to say thank you, it was the least he could do to the person who was going to save him from a metal breakdown.
“You never did answer my question,” he says. “How long have you been down here?”
Steve frowned, a stubborn look crossing his features. Well, the honeymoon phase didn’t last long. “You aren’t a super soldier, Tony. Of course you have to stay put,” Steve said firmly, crossing his arms across his stupidly broad chest and Tony squished down the burst of glee that sprung up in his stomach when he realized he was allowed to think those things without weird guilt for lusting after a teammate.
This was an inside look without all the pretense and cover ups that Tony would see from Steve sometimes. When he’d swallow whatever words he had and leave.
The man pushed himself towards the wall to have something to ground him. Tony’s eyes began to water as he held his stomach; he couldn’t stop shaking.
The blonde needed to fix the scarf now!
“I’m sorry”
“Just because.”
And Clint saw the fear radiating from his eyes.
The next morning Steve was awaken by Tony’s moving the covers, letting the coldness reach their bodies.
After walking for a while, nothing was popping up. Tony even wondered if he was moving at all. There he was in a oversized suit of all things, walking like a maniac. More like running now due to his panic.
Steve was peacefully sleeping when he heard a rattle at his door. The man so very comfortable under the comforter turned towards his clock; 3:00 am. Who the hell was at his door at three in the morning?
Unfortunately, everything reminded him of Tony. Everything was so Tony. Especially their painting he hung in his room.
“Ummm- it was fine. Just press and all. How’s the team?” There was yawn, and Steve’s heart swelled. Gosh, he missed everything about Tony that he could just picture that yawn clearly. So clearly. These two days had be torture, just straight up torture. But Tony would be back that night, and Steve would be able to smother him with love. The man would not leave Steve’s sight for a least a day. All Steve had to was wait.
“Come with me, I’ll take care you,” Tony slightly gripped Steve’s arm with a smile and lead them away from the party, “Your in luck. I always book a room just in case the party becomes too much or something else happens.” Tony climbed the stairs two at a time, not daring to look back at Steve behind him.
Steve couldn’t even compete with this room! He was nothing!
Clint didn’t need those vibes. Those vibes could be deadly. He didn’t want his grave to say death by stress.
“You’re shaking. What happened?” Steve asked glancing back. Tony looked like he was going to pass out as sweat shone on his face. His hands were shaking slightly as he tried to get comfortable.
“Then I’ll be here with you.” Steve kissed his check. Tony leaned onto Steve his back against the blonde’s chest. He was lucky to have him, Tony knew it. He wanted to be with the man and was willing to work for it. Even if it meant actually trying to undo his self hate because it would be worth it.
In his bed!
Tony’s anxiety.
No, Steve can’t be thinking like that right now. He doesn’t even know if Tony likes his as a friend or not, never mind if he likes him romantically. Right now it looked like that would never happen.
“It’s none of your business, arrows. Where you’ve even here about that?” Tony walked over to Nat with his face scrunched up.
“So your just going to leave, huh.”
Surprisingly they got none of that.
It became so easily ‘theirs’ just by the stroke of the hand. His and Tony’s. Steve’s and Tony’s, together. They could be doing everything together, morning coffee and late night dinners, laughs and watching movies but not if . . . not if Tony kept this up.
