Tony grips the front of Steve’s uniform with two hands to keep him upright. He wants to make a joke, throw out a quip or a clever one-liner, but all he can do is say, “Okay,” because he really, really does want to.
Steve smoothed over it with his thumb, shaking his head affectionately. There was a new mark there now - on the Tony of now - a ragged, red mark from when Tony had taken a hit from a Doombot without his armour.
Tony next cornered Steve in the gym, his eyes flicking up and down as Steve bounced on the treadmill. “Steve. We need to talk.”

“Can you hold this?” Tony asked, and he handed Bucky the fox.
"I know. Like I said, I was at Starbucks, I saw it fall out of your pocket at your table, but when I went to give it back, you were surrounded by people. I didn't want to draw attention to the fact that I had Tony Stark's wallet so I let it go. Checked weird fan twitter to see when you usually leave the office and decided to try and catch you in the lobby instead. I was a little late but I’m glad I caught you. Here."

Tony slammed backwards into the wall, and even through the Iron Man armour, pain reverberated through his body. He was running out of tricks. The receptionist’s guns had been decommissioned by Deathlok’s power. Tryp and Madrox were long gone. As was so often the case, it was just the two of them left.
“Our cake was burnt
Steve’s smile twisted sad. “She died. Shortly after he was born.”
Steve froze, throat seizing up. Tony without the arc reactor and the reactor without its glow haunted his dreams more often than not. There was a light sheen of sweat across Tony’s brow, but otherwise he looked fine as he poked at the pieces laid out in front of him, but that didn’t stop Steve from stumbling across the room, dropping the food containers on the couch and landing both hands on the desk.
Tony pulled off slowly, sucking to clean Steve’s cock off. He swallowed heavily then gasped in several breaths in a row, come and spit dripping down his chin. Steve forced himself to look back at the road. “God, that’s hot.”
"Of course."
"Yeah, it is." Tony took a deep breath in and let it out. "So, uh. How are you feeling? Everything okay? What do you need?"
Steve reached out and wrapped his arm around Tony's shoulders, pulling him in and pressing his lips to his temple.
And he’d get all of it four and half hours sooner because he’d chosen this flight.
“So what does Tom do once he finally catches Jerry?” Tony gasped.

“There’s no way to make me being here too look anything but suspicious,” Tony said. “Maybe if I’d brought a date of my own…”
Tony looked clearer too, more lucid than Steve had seen him yet, and he offered Steve a small smile. "Hey," he croaked.
“I’ll try my best not to sully your reputation.” Steve grinned and swooped low again then shot straight up. He could feel the g-forces of the movement, but not as much as he expected; it was softened somehow by the structure of the suit.
“Mike. Mike Lampton.” The boy shook his hand then wiped his palm on his pants nervously. “It’s awesome to meet you, Captain. Uh, Sir.”
"Shit. I -" Tony squeezed his legs together as a hot rush of fresh arousal washed through him. His cock twitched to life. How was that even
“Not at all. He has a serious long-term girlfriend, but they’re in an open relationship and they both see a lot of other people on the side. He’s been around more this week because his girlfriend is away.”
“No!” Tony grabbed at his sleeve even though Steve had shown no signs of leaving. “No. I mean, I’ll admit I wasn’t super thrilled about the idea at first, but I
But Tony zoned out after that, visions of Steve’s boyfriend falling off a bridge and Steve turning to Tony for comfort wandering through his mind. It wasn’t fair, he knew that, but he couldn’t help himself.
"Oh my god." Tony adjusted Ant in his lap as Steve picked up the object he'd dropped. It was a bottle cap, from a beer bottle. One of the specialty craft brews Tony had gotten Steve hooked on shortly after they'd moved in together. And sure enough, there was a streak of red across Ant's palm. "I only left him for a second," Tony breathed. His heart pounded in his chest. There was blood on the
Tony reached out and took Steve’s hand in his, winding their fingers into a tight hold. “Thank you.” He tugged a little and Steve leaned closer, eyes going wide. Tony pressed their lips together, soft, gentle: a promise. “They’re perfect.” He kissed Steve again, and Steve melted into this one, every inch of him pressed up against every inch of Tony; they stayed there for a long time, swaying gently to the music they could just barely hear from the party beneath them, orbiting around a shaped point.
“Shut up,” Bucky grumbled. “I don’t want to talk about it.”
Tony shook his head. “You really noticed all of that?”
Steve sat up, pulling his face out of his hands. That was Tony’s voice he heard. Tony was awake? He stood, wiped his still-damp face on a towel, and poked his head into the hall. He couldn’t see anyone, but the door to his and Nat’s room was just closing, and a moment later, he caught the creak of old hardwood coming from the stairs.
It’d been many more years since then.
Thanks to summerpipedream for the inspiring idea! (For Happy Steve Bingo)
“Authentic 90s apparel. I have a few boxes back here from Malibu storage that I’ve never gone through. Can I still pull it off?”
“Okay,” said the demon,“ but then we’re even!”
"I guess. I'll have an Americano."
“Do you have somewhere to be?”
Tony startled away from the fridge, a bottle of Gatorade in one hand. “Jeez, Cap. You scared me.”
Bucky barked out a laugh as he pushed up to his feet. "Guess it's about time it was my turn to get us locked up, Mr. Rogers. Get dressed."

“And Steve will never forgive me for murdering my brand new kitten that he got me as a very thoughtful birthday gift even though I am clearly a terrible kitten murderer who should never own a pet, ever!"
“There’s one condition.” Tony was smiling too now, unable to hold back a giddy grin to match Steve’s.
"Pete, lots of other kids have glasses too," Steve explained. "And you get to pick whatever ones you want! You could even get ones like daddy when he reads,"
"We're goin' to the party?" Peter asked through his sniffling.
He had been playing with Tommy, the two-year-old son of one of the S.I lawyers, for most of the night with their parents close by watching on. He liked playing with the other kids, but he was content to sit with his parents now, exhaustion beginning to hit.
"Can we make cookies?" Peter asked. "But...but also cupcakes?"
Tony glared at his son, looking over to Steve who was grinning just the same.
"So get the orange juice buddy, Uncle Bruce likes that one too,"
"I went to sleep!" he assured. "I was good!"
Steve couldn't help grinning, but he followed behind his son and wandering into the bedroom were Peter was now hiding. He liked to do this. It was hard to be frustrated when he could see Peter's feet poking out from under his bed.
"I am
"He wants to go again,"
"It looks like you're bleeding, Pete. Which means it
Steve moved around slightly, leaning his head down onto Tony's shoulder once again and closing his eyes.
"How did that happen?"
"Is it?" Tony asked, chuckling. "How did I forget?"
"Santa knows you say thank you, Peter," Steve assured. "I told you, he's always watching,"
"You're not a baby for being upset, Pete," Tony shook his head. "Me and papa always want you to tell us when you don't feel good about something, okay? You can be a big boy and still cry, that doesn't mean you're a baby,"
"You're sneaky," Steve shook his head. "Buddy, we can't have cookies this late. Now we have to clean you up for bed again."
"You know how me and papa have to keep you safe, don't you? From all the silly people who take photos and ask us all those questions,"
"What do you think?" Steve asked, smirking.
Peter looked between his parents, seeing the worry in their eyes. He took a deep breath and parted his lips, feeling the blood spill out and run down his chin. Tony gasped and shot up, rushing over with his jacket. He pushed it into Peter's hand and held it up to his mouth, uncaring of the brand of cost of said jacket.
"Call us if you need anything, okay?" Tony told him, pressing a kiss to his forehead. "I know we said we won't be running anything that you forget, but you can
"Papa can't hear that song one more time, buddy," Steve shook his head. "I know someone who would love to though,"
"Well, Uncle Bruce likes sharing the apple juice," Peter explained. "But I really like the orange juice,"
"So much further than that, Pete,"
"You know, sometimes you're a little too much like your parents, kid,"
"Put one hand on your tummy, and then your other on my tummy, okay?" Steve instructed. "We'll breathe together,"
"Oh," Steve breathed, slightly surprised.
"What about the next, next, next,
"Uh, lots and lots?" Peter guessed, pulling back to stretch his arms out. "This much?"
"I know," Tony agreed. "Kid can make doing groceries make me want to cry,"
the rules," he pointed out. "And little clowns would do well to stick to them, alright?"
"I think I heard him too," Steve added. "I could hear the Christmas tree rattling,"
"I love you dat much too, daddy," he told him softly. "An' I can't get up to space yet, but I promise I do,"
Once it was just Peter and Steve left sitting on the bed, they practiced evening out their breathing again.
Peter smiled in satisfaction. He knew his dad would like that one. And he knew his pops would like his, too.
The boy was quiet for a moment, looking between his parents before fiddling with his fingers. Something he tended to do when he was nervous.
"Mickey Mouse, Pete?" Tony asked, needing confirmation.
Steve glanced at his team.
"C'mere buddy," Steve gestured to his son, lowering Tony onto the couch and kneeling down at his side.
to help Santa go to all the homes, they can't come in and play,"
"The whole world?"
"It's Christmas, buddy," Tony continued.
"Why do we have such a polite, people-pleasing kid?" Tony asked.
Tony ran his finger over Peter's soft cheek then moved to brush back his wispy brown hair. Sometimes Peter just wanted to know that his parents were nearby. That he wasn't alone. That he was loved. And he was always reassured in a heartbeat.
Hours later, as they laid in bed together in Steve and Tony's room, Peter asked that same question that seemed to break their hearts again.
, Peter. You know that. We'll always listen, no matter what it is," he encouraged, reaching out to pat his tummy. "Come on, what's the big plan?"
"The luckiest."
"He still has the seeds around. How about we just plant some more, he won't even know. But you have to promise not to eat these ones, okay? Not until they're long and orange and preferably washed,"
"None of my friends have glasses,"
Peter nodded. He had been keeping it a secret from his parents for weeks now, and only Natasha knew what it was. She was the one helping him get into it and pull it off properly, and now it was all going to be wasted.
the baking section.
"Nuh uh,"
"Mmm," the teenager groaned. "Noooo,"
The little boy looked up at his father.
Peter squealed with laughter as his father lifted him by his foot, hanging him upside down gently. It always made Peter laugh, no matter how many times Steve did it. Even when the little boy was in a grumpy mood, he would always giggle.
"How do you know that?" he asked.
"What was that?" Tony prodded, now staring at his son, tablet forgotten on the couch beside him.
Peter actually picked it out himself. They all liked to call him Peter Rabbit, especially when he jumped from place to place around the living room between his aunt and uncles. They had been out shopping for something for him and as soon as Peter felt the fluffy costume in his chubby little hands, he had been set on it.
her to marry me. It's not like anyone's being forced. She...she wants this too,"
Even in adulthood, Ned couldn't call him Tony.
They continued on with their shopping, almost finished for the day. Shopping was exhausting for a kid, and they would always be reminded of that when they reached the check-out. Peter always got a little droopy in his seat, swaying slowly from one side to another. The beeping of the register almost sent him off to sleep, too.
"Looks like cookie crumbs to me,"
"You make it sound like I'm pelting melons at the kid's head," Tony rolled his eyes. "Fine, no more berry throwing,"
silly, Pete,"
"If we run out or forget something, me or papa can come and get it another day," Tony assured. "They're open everyday,"
"Disneyland?"
"Uh, they growin',"
"Turn my head?"

"I intend to," Thor grinned. "The Incredicoaster looks-"
"Buddy, you can't go when you're sick," he sighed. "It won't be any fun for you,"
"No, but that's why I get to drink as much as I want on Christmas," Peter countered.
Tony laughed, watching his husband make his way over to Sam and Bucky at the bar. His husband was too easy to embarrass in public, Tony couldn't resist.
"Do most parents have
"Yeah, we got an early mark, I was gonna let you know but I thought I'd walk and get some fresh air," Peter explained.
"He's only gonna have one piece of candy tonight, okay?" Steve told his husband, eyeing him.
Challenge: AI Takeover: "shoving another cabinet shut in desperation"
“- like tissue paper out there,” came drifting out of the room, and Tony hesitated. Nat and Steve were talking about the battle. Talking about it in the calm, careful way Tony couldn’t seem to manage. It made sense. They’d always been close.
“Yeah, that’s it. Oh god.” Steve started thrusting like he’d wanted to take his time but he couldn’t hold back, and
"He's never going to let us take it down."

Steve shook his head through his laughter. “No, not at all. Please, Tony. I’m really glad I slept through the neon years.”
“I’m not cheating. These are house rules.”
For Happy Steve Bingo.
Chapters 73-96, were written for the Steve Tony Games, and I was on Team Angst. Some of these have happy endings, some do not. They're mostly darker than what I normally write. I will put tags in the notes here on each one, but do be aware that angst was the primary motivation for these (and points :P) so they taste a little different from what I usually put up.
Steve shifted closer, drawn into Tony's orbit. "Well… there's another doctor's appointment in a few weeks. You could come. They'll be a picture at that one. And we can do the DNA test. And maybe we can find a birthing class to take."

more like the ‘booty’ call if you want to get techni-”
Tony ducked his chin, smiling. “Alright. That sounds pretty good, I guess.”
Tony was warm and close and smiling like Steve had just made his day instead of the other way around. “I could make you one,” Tony said, eyes twinkling. “All red, white and blue. Put some glitter on it. Little wings on the helmet.”
he told himself. “It’s nothing you did. It’s me. I’m going through something.”
Steve blinked awake. The bedroom was dark and quiet, the blackout tint on the window’s still activated, and he had that hazy, muffled feeling that told him he’d woken up too early. When he rolled over to check on his boyfriends, he realized why: the bed was empty.
Steve grinned against Tony’s palm. “It’s going to end whether I kiss you or not.”
“Fu-” Tony has time to say, in 2015.
Pain clenched deep in Tony’s gut, almost dropping him back to his chair, but he locked the joints of the suit and forced himself to stay upright. His plan to do everything in his power to stay away from Steve was failing miraculously already. “Well then,” he forced out. “Show me what you’ve got.”
Tony smiled. It was still hard to believe Steve wanted to be there, but roommates with Steve? That was too good to pass up. “Okay… thank you.”
The thugs, it seems, don’t. Tall, Dark, and Crooked Nose throws the first punch, and luckily Tony’s expecting it, knocking his fist to the side easily. But Short, Squat, and Giant Forehead, dives in after - all flail and no finesses, but he’s got twenty pounds on Tony, and he’s got pants on, so he has the upper hand pretty quickly.
And that's the end of my SteveTony Games fics! Thanks for playing along :D Back to your regularly scheduled uhhh whatever it is I normally do! (^_^)
"Never has been before. But it turns out several of your students have my email address. And they know we're married."
"I saw you earlier in Starbucks -" the man started, and Tony nodded.
“Start at the beginning.” Tony was starting to feel like the conversation was about to take a sharp left turn off a cliff and he wasn’t looking forward to it.
“Morning, guys!” Janet called as she wandered in wearing her fluffy bunny slippers.
seem like a bit of an overreaction. Either his code was faulty, or he was putting a little too much
“Nothing,” Steve said, heart crawling up into his throat. What he was about to do - he wasn’t going to be able to take back. “These jerk-offs were just leaving.” He turned to face Tony, trying to broadcast his intent on the way in. “Thanks for getting me a drink, babe,” he whispered softly. And then he kissed Tony.
When the director called things for the day, Tony packed up and hightailed it out of there without risking talking to Bucky again, worried he would beg. Back at his trailer, he found Steve already there, stirring something on the mini stovetop and humming softly to himself.
Steve didn’t say anything.
“But I also can’t pretend that the way you treat me doesn’t hurt.”
At least now he knew he had a soulmate; he could stop waiting, small comfort that it was.
Steve had been teasing him, stroking his cock, edging him, for so long that when the blunt head of his cock pressed against his hole, Tony had to tip his head back and pant heavily, hands clenched into fists where they were trapped behind his back, to stop from coming just from that.
He bent down and overdramatically kissed the air above Ant's hand. "Muah! Kiss for the boo-boo. And because it's an extra scary one, we get a dah band-aid too." He took the side wrappers off the band-aid and stuck one side then the other to either side of Ant's hand so it covered the cut. "There you go, kid."
Steve laughed and pressed a kiss to the end of his nose. “It’s okay, sweetheart. Old men like you need their sleep.”
"Sleeping," Bucky replied. He lowered the book and eyed Steve with one brow raised. "And then reading."
Greg laughed. “Sure you don’t. It’s been a pleasure to watch, really. How clueless my brother was in the beginning. For a self-proclaimed playboy, he really doesn’t have that much game, does he? Anyway, it’s quite nice to have it confirmed.”
"You okay, Stevie?" Bucky asked between pants.
“Everything going away overnight was kind of the problem, Tony,” Steve said with a sly grin.
"[German] We went to Ellis Island to see the statues again the other day, and I wish I could have gone up and hugged him… or even kissed him."
He found his way to Tony’s lab and burst through the door. “Tony Stark -!” he started, but before he could finish, the Avengers came flying down the hall and collided with him. No! They didn’t understand.
Steve shook his head. Tony’s hand landed on his shoulder and squeezed a little. He shifted closer so Jan and Clint wouldn’t be able to hear them.
Steve laughed. “I was rounding up. Your birthday is in three weeks.”
“Wait,
“Tony.”
Tony covered Steve’s hand with his own. “For
“That’s not -” Steve snapped. Then he cut himself off with a huff. “It’s fine. It’s not that.”
Steve snorted into his pillow, and Bucky sighed. “Don’t say shit like that around the baby.”
Tony stepped under the water and let his eyes fall shut, tipping his chin up to wash the sweat from his brow. He squirted some body wash in his palm and rubbed it over his chest. God, if only it were Steve's fingers there, soothing the fingerprint bruises he'd made during their sparring. Tony tipped back under the warm water and let his hand drift south, mind wandering down a path it tread all too often.
The second Steve touched Iron Man for the first time, Tony found himself glad he hadn’t managed his coffee because if there was anything in his stomach, it’d all be coming back up. He’d heard about people being mate-sick, but this was beyond what he’d expected. Every time he caught Steve’s eyes through the visor of the helmet, he felt like his gut was being cut open anew, every smile a twist of the knife, every touch to his metal casing an iron grip on his heart and lungs.
"Almost?" Tony's voice was rough for some reason, but the man was suddenly so close that it didn't matter.
"It's not as nice as theirs,"
Peter looked between the two.
"And I got the balloons too! I can make everyone balloon animals, just like the circus!"
"If we're going to Mickey's House, do you want some nice ears to wear?" Tony asked.
"That's true, but I'm Captain Hook, right? Captain's
Peter was still staring at the juices, looking between each carton.
"I know the rules," Peter whined, looking back to his friends. "I gotta go make the animals!"
come back to you."
"What a party you throw, Stark!" Thor's boomed.
. He was feeling exactly how a child should feel. Full of energy and love and spirit. Tony would never let himself get in the way of that, and anyone who wanted to change that for Peter would have to go through him first.
, I have toothpaste. That and the toothbrush kinda go hand in hand, pops,"
"No, he won't be mad,"
the costume, Pete. I can't imagine how happy everyone's gonna be with a Peter Clown running around,"
Steve steadied his walk, balancing Peter on his shoulders, as the little boy jumped in excitement. They had only walked into Disneyland ten minutes ago and Steve was already anxious. There were people everywhere. All staring, taking photos and loudly wondering if they were really seeing the Avengers.
face and the things I say, except it's all cute stuff not complaints,"
"There's age and height restrictions on everything," Natasha explained. "But I'm fairly certain you're taller than all of the requirements, so you could ride anything,"
"Some Captains make the rules," Tony amended. "You're just a fireman tonight. And, you know, even though it would make quite a mess of the linen, I wouldn't be totally against you keeping the costume on when we-"
"I be a good boy, papa," he promised.
As the son of two men who put their lives on the line each day, he deserved to have a childhood. He deserved these little, silly moments.
Tony took out his phone, snapping multiple shots of Clint from a range of angles.
Tony smiled.
"Why don' the weindeers come in?"
Steve looked to Tony.
They were in the living room, discussing their plan for the government bill they were helping to draft. It should have been more important than what was on Peter's face, but apparently it wasn't.
Peter giggled, readying himself to finish suiting up.
"I'm sorry buddy," he went on. "Here, have some more water,"
"I know, I'm pops now," Steve laughed. "I like when he says it though. He goes red, like a little kid all over again,"
add the peanut butter!"
"No more, okay? None of this tomorrow, or the next day, or the next day,"
it," Tony assured, making his way over to kneel down in front of his son. "Did you make those repulsors?"
Peter, like every other time his parents questioned him about bullies, just shook his head.
"Steve, if we were in a burning building and Pete had to choose between saving us or having more candy, what's your money on?" Tony asked, watching as lollipop drool began to cover his son's chin and run down his neck.
Peter continued to ponder. Tony lowered them down onto the couch next to Steve, watching as Peter stared over at the windows.
Peter reached out to grab Tony's hand, clutching it close to his chest as Steve placed the lip of the spacer against Peter's mouth. Two pumps of inhaler later, Peter's eyes were closing in pure relief as he took in as much oxygen as he could. Steve kept the spacer to his mouth for a while longer after that, making sure he got every bit of it.
Peter watched his father, taking in a deep breath once Steve did, but coughing immediately and struggling for air.
"Really," Steve winked, pressing a kiss to his husbands cheek as they made it to the kitchen. "Come get the hot chocolate before we head in,"
Peter nodded, still quite sad. His teeth were covered in dirt now and all Tony wanted to do was take him to the bathroom and brush his teeth, but Peter didn't look to even mind. Dirt must taste a lot different to three year olds.
"Did I earn myself another cup of hot chocolate?" the boy asked, eyeing Steve.
His heart hurt to think about Peter growing up without him. Not knowing how much Tony loved him.
"I can see that," he chuckled.
Tony smiled, watching as Peter instructed the God on where to go. They would see them again in another forty minutes. He looked around at his team, tired and hot and hit with the reality of looking after a child all day. He couldn't have asked for a better family.
"That's okay, we can keep trying buddy," Steve insisted. "We're gonna sit here and play this game for a while so daddy can go get the inhaler,"
God, Tony couldn't deal with this kid.
It took twenty minutes to get Peter to school on time, huddled around all the other children ready to have their names marked off and their bags stored under the bus ready for their journey. Steve and Tony hugged their son tight, secretly more emotional about this than they thought they would be. Four whole days without their son.
"Pete, it's okay," Steve assured, grabbing his son's hand. "This is gonna help you,"
"Bunny?"
"Hey, dad, pops?" Peter began, looking between his parents. "Thank you. For getting me here."
As if sensing the eyes on him, Peter turned and stared up at his parents with a dopey grin.
The low groaning let them both know that Tony was awake now too. But instead of a crabby frown, Steve and Peter looked over to see a goofy smile on Tony's lips. The man would happily be woken up at any early hour of the morning to the view of his husband and child.
the Halloween parties each year and as he got older, he became more insistent that everyone wear costumes. Not only that, but the boy made it very clear that his aunt and uncles all had to be at the Halloween party every year.
Peter swallowed, letting out a long groan and shaking his head rapidly as if it was going to help whatever he was feeling. Tony steadied him, not wanting him to drip any drooling saliva onto his tux. MJ would kill him. Well, she probably wouldn't care, but Tony would. There were only a few days in Peter's life that would be documented so thoroughly and be looked back on with such fondness, he was going to make sure the suit was clean.
Tony had never liked Christmas. Maybe when he was a child he could have enjoyed the holiday, but it was most likely short-lived and tainted with bad memories. But sitting on the couch with Steve nestled into his side, warmth surrounding them while snow fell down on New York City outside, Tony felt peaceful. For the first time in his adult life, cheesy Christmas movies were playing on television and Tony didn't feel nauseous. He didn't feel angry, he didn't look for a bottle of scotch, he didn't feel lonely.
They were hard questions to ignore and Peter's brain had a habit of feeding the voice, making it louder and louder until he felt like he was going to throw up.
"But you wouldn't,"
"And they're not important," the boy repeated. "Not worth whatever you guys want to do to them,"
"Choc-chip!" Peter decided. "And then
"Uh huh," Tony mumbled. "Turn your head,"
Ned opened the door, holding his phone just by his ear.
It took another twenty minutes, a glass of water and a few little pieces of candy before Peter walked out of his room. He was so excited to show his parents his costume, but so nervous of their reaction. Natasha followed along behind him, a smile on her lips at the little jump in Peter's step.
Peter nodded, his bottom lip still poking out in a sad frown.
"You like it, don't you Pete?" Clint tasked the tired boy.
The archer was in costume as Robin Hood, and he was never going to live it down.
"Y'gonna come with me?" the boy asked.
"Pirates don't have rules," he reminded.
"Peter!" Tony shouted, chasing the toddler down the hall.
"I know," Peter smiled, squeezing his fathers in one last hug.
"All the way in space?" Peter asked, eyes wide. "You can't reach space, daddy!"
"Look toward the door,"
By this point, Steve knew no words of comfort were going to do any good. He carefully lowered himself to the ground, stretching his legs out and settled Peter against them so he could look into his son's eyes.
"You heard Santa!"
"Happy Halloween, Peter Rabbit,"
"Why is there stuff wrong with me?"
Peter's eyes widened.
"Calm down, Pete," Steve soothed, running his hand over Peter's cheek. "I need you to look at me, okay? Nowhere else but me, you got it?"
Thor thought for a moment.
When he began to squirm and whine softly, Steve's eyes fluttered open and his hand immediately moved up to rub his son's tummy - Peter's favourite soothing technique.
"Little Warrior!" he laughed.
"Uh huh," Peter laughed.
"No, you're not little," he relented. "You're getting to be a big boy now, aren't you?"
Steve laughed. That was very unlikely. Peter had threatened to stay up all night during one of his tantrums, and the little boy never made it past nine. Three years old had a ton of energy, but they crashed
"But...they were small and hard,"
had a really long night," Peter laughed. "I could hear the old man himself watching a movie at two this morning,"
Peter nodded, still coughing and wheezing. Tony had emergency help on the way already, and his duty right now was to sit behind his son and hold him upright to open his lungs.
Peter watched as Steve looked through them, feeling just how comfy and fluffy they were. He planned to wear them always.
"Okay,"
"YES!" Peter cheered. "We all gettin' ears!"
Peter nodded, laying his head down on Steve's chest.
"Uh huh," Peter nodded. "But I'm not as smart as uncle Bruce. And no one else in my class wears 'em,"
Peter thought for a moment, his little lip beginning to wobble.
Tony brushed his hand through Peter's hair, eyes fixed on the movie, as Peter fell deeper and deeper into his slumber. Steve pulled the kid's legs up onto his lap, making him more comfortable.
Steve rubbed his back, sitting beside him on the couch.
"What if I be quiet?" Peter asked. "Santa won' know I'm playin' wif 'em,"
Peter laughed, moving back to plant his sticky hands on either side of Tony's face.
"Steve, your son is too sassy for nine a.m,"
"I bunny," he told him.
"What...is this...
Steve rolled his eyes.
Steve smiled, pulling Peter into his arms and letting the boy cling to him knowing he wouldn't be letting them go down to medbay without him.
"Yummy," the boy added, reaching for more. "You have some, daddy?"
"Oh,"
"It should have been pretty clear. And he was in pain for over an hour, Tony,"
day?"
Peter rolled his eyes as his father ran over the checklist one more time. They had been planning for this school trip for over a week and now, on the morning that he was leaving, Steve decided he needed to triple check every single thing his son needed.
"What's in your mouth?" he asked.
"Dis much?" Peter asked again, stretching as far he could before falling back off Tony's lap.
"Daddy sneaky!" Peter cackled, squirming in his hold.
"You'll get cookies," Tony kissed his son's cheek. "Cookies and kisses, huh?"
"Hmm,"
Peter nodded, snuggling into the pillows stacked high behind his head.
The boy that was once embarrassed about his glasses had three different pairs in various styles, and he had inhalers on hand for all occasions.
"You're lucky Nat is still on mission," Bruce shook his head.
"They're too noisy. They'd wake us all up,"
"Peter!"
"They're okay," Pepper repeated. "They're gonna be a little sore, but they're okay. I bet all they need is a big hug from you,"
"Pete," Tony sighed. "Look at me, buddy."
"Do I get to come?"
bike?" Peter asked.
"Oh, buddy, your costume!" Steve pointed.
"This was Peter's choice," his husband huffed. "Don't...make it weird,"
"We're bringing the party to you, Pete!" Bruce explained, his voice muffled by his Mario moustache.
Steve's biggest concern was Peter's hyperventilating. Panic was the worst thing for an asthma attack, but considering this was Peter's first experience with one, it was more than understandable. Steve would be lying if he said he wasn't close to breaking down with panic as well. But he had to hold himself together for Peter, just like Tony had to.
"Oh, I don't doubt it for a second,"
Peter nodded.
Then, before Peter knew it, he was standing outside and readying himself to walk into the venue with his groomsmen.
"Who?" Tony asked, the anger in his voice not matching his gentle movement to press ice against Peter's jaw.
"We'll always come shopping together, kiddo," Steve laughed, pressing a kiss to his son's head. "But everything is always gonna be here, too. Don't worry about running out of juice,"
"I'll get better,"
"Santa wouldn't put
Tony had a charity Halloween party every year for Stark Industries and Peter had been too little, tired and quite scared last year to attend. But this year, even if it was only for an hour or two, the little family was going to make all the other attendees swoon.
"Especially when you're sneaky," Tony assured, coming up behind the boy.
"I'm fine," the teen mumbled, shaking his head. "It looks worse than-"
"Kid listens to daddy too much," Steve corrected. "But yes, genius."
All Tony could think about was bath time. Messy, colourful, stains everywhere bath time.
Tony had fixed his tie dozens of times now. It was a nervous tick of his that he just never grew out of. Even at his age now, he couldn't help himself.
But Peter always had a 'what if' in the back of his mind. What if this was the time they didn't make it? What if they didn't come home this time? What if they're hurt worse than they thought? What if Peter never saw them again?
days, I'm not packing for a month!"
No. Peter would be loved and nurtured to be exactly who he wanted to be and walk through dirty puddles and laugh and squeal as loud as he wanted.
"I have everything I need," Peter assured, adjusting his glasses. "Can we go now? I'm gonna be the last one on the bus,"
"But I had my costume all ready and Aunt Nat was helping me get into it," the boy cried. "And she was dressing up with me!"
situation, not papa," he continued.
"Uh huh," Peter nodded, leaning up on his knees to reach his father's mouth.
"Do you know how much I love you, kiddo?" he asked.
Peter's lips turned up into a shy little grin and he turned to nuzzle into Steve's side. The optometrist had left the room a few minutes ago to let Peter choose some frames from their selection and work on his prescription. Being the brave little boy he was, Peter hadn't said a word about being upset until he was just alone with his parents. Self-confidence at any age is important, but Peter was just starting school and making friends, and it was obvious that this was going to add to his nerves.
"You can't play with the reindeers, buddy," Steve explained. "They're too big. And they practice
Peter looked up at the God through his droopy bunny ears, clinging to Tony's shirt as he embraced the cuddles and kisses he was getting. After a moment he reached his little hand up toward Thor, making grabby motions.
"Papa!" Peter cried, reaching to Steve with panic and terror.
"There's more to it! When it gets hot it changes to
"No can do, buddy," Tony shook his head. "Santa keeps an
"Will I cheer everyone up?" Peter asked. "Cause that's the clown's job, you know? No one can be sad with clowns around,"
"It's gonna make sure you get all the medicine," Steve explained, attaching it to the inhaler. "Time to do those big breaths again, okay? This is special air that's gonna help you take better breaths,"
"It's cute, isn't it?" he chuckled.
Tony used to make fun of parents like this. He used to think kids in these cheesy costumes were so sad and not at all cute. But it took Peter to change that for him. It took Peter to change a lot of things for Tony. All in the best ways possible.
"Papa's carrots," Tony sighed.
Peter held up his hands.
wanted to wear his costume and eat some candy.
Tony was first, unwrapping the heavy object like a young child. He rolled his eyes at the fact it was a coffee cup (Steve had currently prohibited him from purchasing anymore as they could not longer fit in the cupboards) and grinned madly when he saw the print. All around the mug were pictures of Steve and quotes that he said daily. From 'How many cups is that, Tony?' to 'Did I marry an actual lunatic?'.
"Yeah, it's medicine," Steve nodded. "Okay, we ready?"
continued to play with no protests from all the adults in the room, Peter began snoring softly between his parents. He had a lollipop in his hand, sticking to his shirt, that he just wouldn't let go of. It reminded Steve of his little baby all those years ago, clinging to his candy, not ready to end the night.
"Everyone else isn't our little boy, are they?" Steve reminded.
He shouldn't be surprised. This was totally normal. Peter was at the age for teething. Babies grew teeth. Babies were in pain growing teeth. How did he not think of this?"
"I good runner!" Peter giggled back.
Tony had time to toss his empty coffee cup on the seat beside him before he held his arms out and caught his wild son. Peter was absolutely buzzing. They had managed to sit him down for a sandwich and juice about an hour ago, but it did nothing to ease his candy high. They couldn't deny how adorable he looked though. Wearing his Mickey Ears (they hadn't been taken off all day) on top of his curly mess of hair, lips stained red from the endless candy he managed to take from his goodie bags, Peter looked like a kid living out his dream.
Peter smiled then, giggling wildly as Tony took his photo and sent it off to his husband. Their son was covered head-to-toe in dirt, grass stains, apple juice and an assortment of fruit mush. But he was
Peter nodded, his little bottom lip sticking out.
"Papa's gonna be mad,"
"Okay, let's try again, ready Pete?" Tony laughed.
"Most parents do, you know?"
"It burns!"
"This...this is your pops in coffee mug form," Tony laughed. "Oh my god-"
Peter sat on the chair in the optometrist exam room, a frown on his lips and sad tears welling up in his eyes. The sight broke both Steve and Tony's heart. The idea of their son being upset was painful, but seeing the absolutely miserable pout sticking out from his lip was killing them. Peter was good at that pout, too.
Peter continued to cry, hiccups very present now. Steve pulled his son close to his chest once again, standing up and walking them into the bathroom. He grabbed a washcloth and ran some cool water, soaking it all up before rinsing it lightly. He bunched up the corners of the moist material and turned back to Peter. The boy didn't seem too excited about the idea of putting anything in his mouth, and Steve didn't blame him. But once he nudged the washcloth between Peter's lips, he watched his son begin to munch down on it.
"Uh huh," Steve rolled his eyes, reaching down.
Peter jumped in Tony's arms, immediately beginning to whine and cry. Thor's expression quickly shifted from excitement to concern and regret.
"So just ignore everyone else," Tony shrugged. "On the day I married your pops, he was all I could see. We could have been in an empty room for all I knew. This day is for you and MJ, alright? That's all you have to think about. That's the only person that's gonna be in that room."
"It's okay," Steve laughed, shaking his head. "He's just tired and probably looking for a reason to cry, actually,"
"You've always been better and calming his nerves, Steve," Tony shook his head.
Tony looked back up at his son, his heart aching with just how much he loved him. The idea of making Peter feel ashamed or unwanted made him physically ill, and he couldn't bear the thought of Peter living the childhood he did. The idea of Howard Stark having any control of Peter's upbringing made him shudder.
"I didn't mean to be a baby," he apologised. "Can't help it,"
"Captains make the rules, huh?" Steve repeated, a smirk on his lips.
"I know, I know," Steve sighed, piling the bags into the car. "I just...
"You definitely inherited that from your pops,"
Peter liked apple juice, but recently starting loving orange juice even more. It was adorable how overwhelmed Peter got when faced with making a decision between two things. The little boy had so much heart, he never wanted to disappoint anyone or anything. He also didn't want to run out of anything. That was a big one too. Peter didn't grasp the concept of grocery stores quite yet.
And he knew a big reason for that was Steve. The man who made him appreciate gingerbread cookies and non-alcoholic eggnog. The man who made Tony want to cover the penthouse in Christmas decorations and a tree bigger than necessary. But the other factor in Tony's happiness this Christmas was a the snuggly little baby that was cradled in his arms.
Steve was finishing off his fourth sandwich, shaking his head.
"I can see why he's so excited," Thor laughed, waving his hand around. "Look at this place! It's magical. Well, as magical as Midgard gets. I'm looking forward to the Space Mountain voyage,"
"I know,"
But now he had four new pairs ready for rotation. Each covered in different photos of Tony and Peter.
"Pete, they hurt you," Steve sighed.
After distributing the two presents to his parents, Peter sat back to enjoy their reaction. This was the part that always made him shy. Peter had chosen the cheesiest dad gifts that he could think of.
"I know you did," Tony smiled. "Because I think I woke up and
It wasn't often that Steve and Tony were woken in the middle of the night these days. The team had a handle on most things that went on out in the world. Tony and Steve were senior members of the Avengers now, there was a whole new team to handle threats. The alarm only went off for emergencies these days. Situations where Iron Man and Captain America were needed.
"Peter, hey, look at me,"
Peter was sleeping soundly against his father's chest, his chubby cheeks covered in drool. Four months old and he owned everything Tony and Steve had to offer. Every ounce of their love, adoration and protection.
"I shared 'em," Peter answered innocently. "Wanna share strawberries too?"
Steve's heart was breaking.
Steve was looking. He had been looking for the last ten minutes since they sat Peter's little feet down on the ground and he began toddling around, clad in his fluffy bunny costume. Peter kept turning around to laugh at his little tail, trying to get a good look, spinning around to the point of falling onto his padded behind with another giggle. Ever since they put him in the costume, the toddler had decided it was the funniest thing he had ever seen.
"Hey, Peter, calm down," Steve soothed. "I know it looked really scary out there and it was for a while, but it's all over now. If we were hurt real bad, we'd be down in the Medbay, wouldn't we?"
, remember?"
"Bathroom first, kiddo," Steve reminded, moving to stand up and lift Peter off with him.
"Mm, okay," Steve agreed sleepily.
The boy's eyes widened.
"You bet I do," Tony smiled, pressing a kiss to his son's forehead. "Even when you're covered in berries, kid."
"And waffles?"
"You'd look much more handsome in yours than I do, trust me," Tony encouraged.
"You know what, I think this is your best costume ever," Steve praised.
"I'm thinking of...a
"I used cereal boxes," Peter nodded.
Thor had arrived earlier in the day, still dressed in his armour, and hadn't bothered to change for the party. There were five people at the party dressed as Thor who were currently laughing wildly at the stories the God was telling in dramatic detail. Bruce had thrown a lab coat on and some hairspray to become a crazy professor, and was currently enjoying a beer. Tony always liked to see the man relaxing.
They stared back at their son, hearts breaking at his worry, and watched as his little lips began to tremble and tears fell down his cheeks. Peter couldn't hold it in any longer. Maybe he was too old to be crying over these things, too old to be acting so childish when he could see them and feel them right here in front of him. They were okay, they were alive, but Peter couldn't stop worrying. The images from the news kept flashing in his mind.
"I guess not," Steve rolled his eyes. "How do I put up with your appetite, Pete?"
The kid barely made it through twenty minutes of their second movie. As
"Uncle Thor!" Peter cried out.
"Which is when I'll be taking
"Ouch," Tony laughed. "That's no way to address Captain Hook,"
Peter's sad eyes turned up to his father, his chubby cheeks making Tony melt right there. He lifted his son into his lap, running a hand over his cheek and brushing back his messy hair.
"I have underwear, dad,"
"Steve?" Tony called out, wiping his hands on an old rag as he wandered through the room, listening closely for any sign of his boys. "Pete?"
"Cookie," Steve ordered, holding out his other hand. "Now."
"How did you eat all those blueberries already?" he asked, already knowing that half of them had missed the boy's mouth and squished against his shirt.
"Of course they will,"
go overboard with the candy this year, right?" Steve voiced entered the room.
Tony and Steve looked to one another once again, exchanging expressions of one of their silent conversations.
"Time is it?" he asked.
"Daddy!"
"You've really gone all-out this year, huh?" Tony bent down in front of his son, hands on his shoulders. "You're a cute little clown, buddy,"
The way he said it made it seem like a question, and Tony could tell that Peter's insecurities were rising.
Peter grinned.
"I'm not little,"
Steve must have walked around Peter's room at least a dozen times, slowly rocking the baby in his arms while whispering soothingly and rubbing his back softly. Peter had his head on Steve's shoulder, crying and whining as if his father wasn't even there comforting him. Tony was out on Iron Man duties and as competent and confident as Steve was with their son, he thought many times about calling his husband for advice.
Peter groaned.
"I don't think you're sneaky enough for that, Pete," Steve shook his head.
"Why not?" Tony asked. "Hey, don't hide from us Pete,"
On some of his days off, and especially Sundays, Steve had a rule about not putting his shoes on. He wanted to spend the day indoors with his family or cuddled up to Tony while Peter was out with his friends, with a comfy pair of socks on his feet. That was something he was often teased about, too. Steve's Old Man socks were a running gag in the household.
"So much for one piece," Steve shook his head, unable to hold back a grin. "That's too much sugar for a kid,"
each time.
"It's okay, it's okay, we're here," Tony soothed, helping his son sit up further.
"Mine!" the toddler squealed.
"Uh huh," he sighed. "I know, daddy."
"I don't want to look funny at school,"
Peter smiled, dopey and sleepy and barely awake.
"A lot of kids get bullied, pops.
"He okay?"
The boy loved making cupcakes, but they were sure it was because he liked to make the frosting different colours each time. Steve helped out with baking time in the afternoon, while Tony was big on taste-testing once everything was done. Steve secretly loved that it was just him and Peter baking on their own in the afternoon. It reminded him of when he was a little boy, staying home from school or just unable to go out and play, keeping his mother company in the kitchen while she baked.
The team were all sitting at their own little lounge area, taking a rest from the party. Natasha and Clint were out on duty somewhere in Switzerland, but Tony had made sure to send through a photo of the cutest baby ever that they were missing.
Peter grinned shy, moving back to Tony's chest and cuddling up to him.
"Well, he gets it from you," Steve shrugged.
"Pops only makes the really,
Peter turned in his seat, looking at the display of red apples. Tony had a little bag ready as the boy pointed at the biggest, shiniest looking apples. Then oranges. Then peaches. Picking pieces of fruit was a little game they played when Peter was younger and learning his colours, but now it was too routine to let go.
"You should go check on him," Steve suggested.
"Daddy?" Peter's soft voice called, pulling Tony from his thoughts.
"You have a
"Santa has his ways," Steve grinned. "He's a very smart guy, you know?"
"Hmm," Tony grinned. "I think you'll be okay,"

"Carrot!" Peter shook his head.
"No, why are you being weird?"
"Spit it out!"
at our son,"
"No we're not," Tony whined. "Hey, you wanted the normal family grocery store trip-"
"Sure, let's get your shirt even messier, kid."
"The whole world,"
But Peter wasn't dressed as a terrifying, murderous clown. He was just a happy, brightly-colored clown with a red nose and hilariously oversized shoes. His face was painted white with big red lips and he wore adorably long suspenders that pulled his baggy pants up so high that Tony could almost get over his dislike of clowns just to lift him up and cuddle him crazy.
"You only look funny when we soap up your hair like a shark!" Tony reminded, getting the smallest smile from his son before it returned to the sad frown.
"Told you he's always watching, didn't I?"
"My teeth...cut into my cheek," Peter whined. "Really deep...really sore,"
"So tacky, kid," Tony agreed. "You did good,"
"Hear that? We're
"I have it," Peter pat his backpack. "And a spare in my luggage,"
"There is
"Cereal!" Peter clapped. "Can we have more Cheerios?"
"Hey kiddo," Tony smiled, the pain and exhaustion clear in his voice.
Peter was basically
"Medicine?" the boy asked.
Steve leaned in to kiss Peter's forehead.
The team stared at the Captain, their eyes wide in panic. Behind them, right in Steve's vision, was Thor and Natasha. The God had been obsessed with riding the Incredicoaster and wouldn't let up until one of his teammates joined him. Natasha had been the only one to relent, glad to have a break from Clint's antics.
Peter would never be told to act 'properly' in public. He would never be told to quieten his laughs, to straighten his clothes and keep them tidy and neat for photos. Peter would never know of those fake smiles, the fake love, the fake family that kids were forced into when they were in the public eye.
"Got pushed into my locker,"
"Not too bad," Tony shook his head. "We're okay Pete,"
Peter let out a long 'ahhhh' sound as he held his mouth open in defeat, watching as his father studied the black mess he was pulling out of his son's mouth.
"I saw it! I saw it all on the TV! I know you're hurt!" he argued.
"Papa," he sighed. "Haven't heard him call you that-"

"You said Uncles and Aunt Nat were coming over in the morning," Peter explained. "And they like my cupcakes. But I really wanna make cookies for
Tony looked to Steve with an adoring grin, shaking his head.
Peter squealed and giggled wildly as Tony lifted him up high, tickling his tummy and melting at the sound of his son's laughter. Steve stared up at them in awe.
"You don't have silly eyes,"
They started this hero journey long before Peter was part of their lives and it came with downfalls back then too, but seeing Peter right now made them want to hang up their suits for good. They always told themselves that they were doing all of this for Peter and his future. Whenever they left the house in their uniform, whenever they took on an enemy, it was all for Peter.
"I think it's too big," Peter shook his head. "I don't...I don' wanna ask,"
"W-wha' tha'?" he asked, his hand shaking as he pointed to the spacer.
"Which is exactly why pop is going over it all again," Tony laughed. "You haven't got the best track record for remembering things, buddy."
"Kid's a genius," Tony laughed.
"At least you didn't show up as Cupid," Tony laughed. "Although, there's always next year,"
Sitting on the kitchen bench just by the window, next to a trail of dirt and tiny roots, was a ceramic planter pot.
They were five aisle in by the time they made it to the baking section. Peter
"No, we don't, but I do like Peter Bunny,"
"It's never silly to be worried, okay?" Steve reassured. "It's like when you ride your bike without your helmet and me and daddy get a bit cranky. We can't help it, because we worry,"
"Why do I have silly eyes?"
"It's the candy holiday, Steve. It's not like he eats like this every day," Tony shrugged. "Plus, he'll be super easy to put down tonight,"
than space,"
"Me too," Steve yawned, rubbing Peter's back. "He loved it."
Peter reached out to put his hand on Steve's stomach, nodding as they began to inhale. It was a little better this time, but Peter couldn't hold his breath for long at all. As soon as his lungs were full, he was coughing it back out. But at least it was calming him down.
, he kills me, Tony. Everything he says, everything he does, it kills me. I love him so much."
"To be just
Peter looked up to Tony who just smiled back at him and brushed his sweaty hair from his face.
"Teething?" his husband replied. "I've been checking for teeth for like, two weeks!"
Tony grinned, looking over Ned's shoulder to see his son standing by the window. The man wandered away, continuing his phone call, and Tony took his chance to go over to Peter and take a moment to chat to him. Just the two of them.
"Then you'll have to try really hard to
Peter Parker was their son, and he was perfect just the way he was.
"No, I mean, yeah, yeah I do, but not because of the whiskey," he sighed. "Can you hug me?"
Santa in the living room,"
Peter never turned down hugs. Not unless he was feeling sick or too tired to move, in which case he always tried his best anyway. The little boy clambered into Tony's lap, wrapping his arms around Tony's neck and shoving his berry-covered shirt into his father's chest.
"Your home early," Tony added, looking up from his tablet.
"Pete, it's dad," Tony called out.
But Peter was a good kid. He was the best kid. There was no other little boy out there who was kinder, sweeter or more loving. Peter deserved everything he could ever want, he deserved a childhood filled with everything that any other kid would have. He deserved to be able to go to the park and get ice-cream and have a part in the school play in front of all the other families. So when Peter asked for something that every other child inevitably asks for at some point, his parents know they can't refuse.
"He's got a good heart,"
Tony immediately saw his mistake there. Peter was just too
"You looooove me," Peter grinned, hopping up to run into the kitchen and refill his mug.
Steve agreed. The little boy was being fuelled by candy, and as soon as this lollipop was finished, they knew he was going to crash.
"You're okay, buddy," he soothed. "Uncle Bruce is coming by any minute now,"
"Do y'like it?" Peter laughed, spinning. "Papa put crazy spray in my hair and it's green!"
Peter looked shyly down at himself. He was technically wearing two costumes. On one side he was Captain America, complete with a cardboard shield. On the other he was Iron Man, half a paper helmet slipped on top of his head. He and Natasha had spent so long building all the pieces and Peter put in a lot of colouring hours into the whole costume.
Bucky groaned. “I’m so sorry, baby. Go back to sleep? I’ll call you in like… six hours and try again.”
“Good thing.”
Tony drew Nat into a ballroom hold and rocked them back and forth to the soft music that piped from Tony’s phone. She melted into his arms, and stayed light on her toes, letting his chest take her weight with uncharacteristic vulnerability. Tony moved smoothly, making sure to dodge Natasha’s bare feet as he swept her in small circles.
Tony dug his fingers into Steve’s side, making him squirm and giggle. “I need my sleep cause you crazy kids are going to keep me up until midnight tonight.”
“I can - uh -” Tony gestured towards him, and Steve held out his wrists. He’d left his cuffs unbuttoned in anticipation of Tony’s gift. Tony focused on pinning the two halves of the sleeve together, sucking his tongue back in when he realized it had popped out from between his teeth. When he was finished, he looked back up and Steve was gazing at him. His eyes were blue. Incredibly blue.
Thank you ashy for beta!
“Come with me.”
“The trauma therapist said having someone to help remind you that you need to eat, get out of bed, that you’re not going to reset again is -”
Steve’s lips twitched up at the corners. He nodded. “Yes.”
“Maybe.” Tony set the box down again and tapped a finger against his lips. “Maybe.”

"Shh, shh, baby, you're okay," Tony murmured, voice shaking. What if Ant was really hurt? What if he needed stitches and he never trusted them again, or his tiny hand didn't work properly, and all because Tony had set him down for one damn second to ogle his boyfriend? "I'm sorry." He bounced Ant gently on his knee while Steve ran the water warm and made a wad of paper towel. "Steve, I broke the kid." Tony looked up at him pleadingly.
the music faded out to nothing, and Bucky straightened up suddenly, his waistband snapping back into place. “Welp, that’s it, I guess. What’s for dinner?”
(Originally
“Nah, I stopped at the apartment.” Tony twined their fingers together and led Steve down the hall and into the living room. In the middle of a halo of boxes, upturned lamps, half-assembled furniture, and painting supplies, was a nest: three blankets, all the pillows they owned, a spread of takeout containers, and in the middle, an electric candle. Rowdy’s bowls were nearby, filled with water and kibble.
Steve spun around and burst into the most brilliant smile Tony had ever seen. Tony set off across the roof, ready to fling himself into Steve’s arms, but Steve held out a hand, halting him. “Wait,” he called. “They’re not great with strangers. I don’t want you to get hurt. You’re not allergic, are you?” Steve crossed the roof instead, winding between the sudden collection of stuff to get to Tony.
"Hey, sweetheart. Come here." Steve drew Tony into his arms and kissed him soundly, erasing the hundred heartless kisses he'd shared with Bucky that day. But Steve could always tell when something was off with Tony. "You okay?"
“Always. No matter what. I’ll always bring it back for you. Cause it tastes better when I bring it home.”
But he wasn’t here now. The lights were off, the air was filled with nothing but the hum of electronics, and the smell of Steve’s aftershave was distant and faded.
Tony's side of the first few days with the baby.
"Thor. Nice to meet you." Steve shook his hand.

“Like what?”
He pulled on a sweater then hiked back up the stairs to the penthouse. He was reaching for the doorknob, when the door flew open, and Tony was standing there, looking startled. “Hey,” Steve said. “You okay?”
Rating: T
“I mean -” Tony shrugged. The only way to get out of this with his dignity intact was to hurt Steve, and that was something he definitely couldn’t do. “Yeah. Yeah, I would.”
And maybe this time, Steve wouldn’t forgive him.
Starkbucks Bingo Square: O2 - "What did you do?"
“It’s fine, Tony. I’ll do it. I don’t mind.”
Bucky stepped inside. The main floor was a small, round space with a kitchen and a dining table. There were papers and notebooks everywhere. Tony immediately made for the stairs and Bucky followed him. One floor up was something entirely different. A huge table in the middle of the room was covered with cardboard models, filled with tiny cardboard people and sets. Posters lined the walls, all famous magicians, and a shelf of binders, each with a year printed on it, stood by a small desk that was also covered in model sets, as well as dolls, some missing limbs or heads.
"Thor and Hulk have everything under control." They both looked over to where Thor had the sorcerer in a headlock. "I'm going to take you back home."

Tony nodded, throat bobbing as he swallowed heavily. "Yeah. You?"
“I know.” Bucky shifted his weight from foot to foot. “Guess we’ll have to find something else to do.” Bucky turned suddenly and pinned Steve against the counter. He cupped Steve’s jaw and drew him into a kiss, pulling him into his arms then driving him back onto the couch when he parted his lips and moaned softly. Bucky’s mouth occupied Steve while the cake cooked, wandering hands making Steve almost forget about it until the timer went off. Steve pulled open the oven and they inspected the cake.
No thank you. You were more than enough egotistical genius for me :)
He padded silently down the hall in his socked feet. He’d seen Steve and Nat go into the room at the end of the hall, so that must be theirs. He stopped outside the door and leaned in, raising one fist to knock. He could do this.
"You okay?" Bucky asked.
Still, Steve skipped the communal floor - where everyone was no doubt still welcoming Tony home - and went straight to his own. He wasn’t hungry - everything tasted like ash anyway, these days, and he needed a shower, and fresh clothes, and maybe a pep talk before he could face faking a smile around -
And, god, if holding Steve's hand hadn't been all Tony wanted for months now. "Fuck," Tony cried, the tentacles ramping up their assault on his body again. He couldn't come all over Steve, he couldn't, but shit that was where he was headed. Steve's body was being worked closer and closer until they were sharing the same air.
Tony loved this moment. Steve was like a weighted blanket over him, huge and warm and heavy. He managed to wrap himself around Tony, gathering him together, until Tony felt like there wasn’t an inch of him that didn’t belong completely to Steve. The first press of Steve’s cock against his hole felt like coming home, even though he’d been the one waiting here for Steve to return.
Tony shifted, making the chains holding his arms above his head rattle. He squeezed his fingers around the fabric straps locking his wrists to the chains and breathed out a shaky breath. “Any time now, Rogers,” he bit out, yelping when a hand smacked across his ass, leaving the skin stinging and sensitive. “Fuck.”
Tony moaned again in reply, bobbing his head like a nod until Steve’s cock hit the back of his throat.
"Shit!" Tony staggered backwards, until he smacked his elbow on the shower wall, sending bottles tumbling down to the wet tile, realizing too late that he had put the strange thing between himself and the exit, and he wasn't wearing the suit-summoning bracelets.
Still, the aliens showed no sign of relenting and provided no clue as to what would satisfy them. For all he knew, they would both die here like this.
“Oak Hill.”
Tony managed to sprawl across the bench seat in a way that should have looked uncomfortable but he somehow made look sultry instead. He pulled Steve’s cock free and wasted no time licking a stripe up the length of it.
Tony’s smile broke into a grin. “Yeah, alright.” He grabbed a handful of Steve’s shirt, over his heart and pulled him into a deep, loving kiss. “Happy New Year.”
"- then it makes the electricity stop for a bit."
“It’s not fair,” Tony sighed.
“I hear ya.”
This is the best thing I've ever seen! Tony! I can't believe you built this as a kid, wow! Can you come up to my floor and show me how to sign the guestbook?? Can I set that moving salute picture to my profile picture on Twitter?
"Yeah."

need to get away from it. I can send some security out to stop them from coming back, but all it’ll take is some paps in New York and anyone stalking the airport when we land and they’ll know I was here too.”
"When the power goes out, you have to play blanket fort. It's the law."
When Tony’s heart stuttered to a stop, Steve broke free, choking out a sob. That was the last time he’d hear that dear sound. He lifted his own wrist to his mouth and ripped a chunk out of his forearm, letting it bleed freely for a moment before pressing the mess to Tony’s lips.
Steve sat up in bed, his back against the wall. He could hear Natasha and Bruce talking out in the hallway and it was hard to ignore. He tried to tune them out, but his options seemed to be stressing about Tony or eavesdropping, and neither was very appealing. He was considering digging around in Nat’s bag to see if she had any headphones, when the door opened and both Nat and Bruce slipped inside.
A sudden brainwave had him digging around behind a stack of boxes, feet tipping up off the floor as he folded himself over the pile. He heard the sliding door slip open and shut and then a hand landed on his ass where it was sticking up.
“Just a friend. Thanks for the save. Thanks for everything.” Tony’s about to add more, maybe too much, maybe say something dangerous and affectionate and unwelcome to a Steve that’s nearly a century from knowing him, but then there’s a pull low in his gut, and he recognizes it as the same feeling that tugged him here in the first place. He grins, says “Bye, Steve!” and stays just long enough to hear Steve yell, “Hey! How do you know my -?!” before he’s yanked back to 2015.
“Oh, Tony. Just because we fight doesn’t mean I stop loving you. I know there’s a lot to talk about, a lot to sort out. But it can wait. I almost lost you today - I was so scared. Can I just hold you and know you’re alright?”
“But technically you never married me…” Tony trailed off, and Nat turned back to her book, trying to block out the noises coming from the other side of the room.
“I want that.”
“When he doesn’t come back. When he stays there.”
“Yeah?”
The very bad man had a very bad robot and he used it to fly across the city to his love. One look at him and Tony would realize how in love he was and then, finally, they would be together.
Steve hauled him to his feet. "Almost." He grinned.
Tony snorted out a panicky laugh. “Honestly, I’m kind of a mess. I know I’m supposed to be pitching myself at this point, but I don’t want you to suffer from buyers remorse, and I'm… kind of a lot.”
He dug out the stack of comic strips he'd been working on the night before. Were they not interesting? Not funny? Not well drawn? Was he just not good enough over all? Or maybe there were just too many fish in this sea, and no one even looked at his strips at all. He flipped through the pages again and found himself a blank sheet, but even after twenty minutes of staring, no new ideas came to mind. When his brain refused to be clever in any way at all, he started sketching out the line of Bucky's chin. He was bored before he reached his eyes, though, so he switched to hand practice, moving his own into different positions and sketching it out.
“It’s Steve, Bruce. He’s probably picking out wedding rings. Have you ever seen him date someone?”
"Tony!" He ran past the lockers to the back shower stalls where he could hear the water was still running. Oh god, what if he was really hurt. What if he slipped and hit his head or had a heart attack or -
“Sure.”

Steve slipped down onto his back and shoved his head between Tony’s knees, grabbing one in each hand and yanking him forward as far as the chains would let him go. Steve’s hands were iron clamps on Tony’s thighs, and he held him still as he thrust up to nuzzle into the cleft of Tony’s ass.
Bucky grabbed Tony's hand and dragged him off to a quiet corner behind craft. "What?"
"How long til the truth spell wears off?"
Steve chuckled and shook his head. “I don’t know. You’re the first one stuck with it. You tell me.”
For my STG square "In Space" and the challenge "Live on Air"
The next day was charcoals, and the sketch of a woman’s back as she zipped up her dress was so beautiful, it almost drew Tony’s eye away from the man hanging it, but only almost.
Chapters 73-96, were written for the Steve Tony Games, and I was on Team Angst. Some of these have happy endings, some do not. They're mostly darker than what I normally write. I will put tags in the notes here on each one, but do be aware that angst was the primary motivation for these (and points :P) so they taste a little different from what I usually put up.
“Fine.”
The car behind him revved again then quieted and Tony glanced around to see why they were having so much trouble getting down the road. A man dressed in black was standing right behind him, but Tony didn’t have a chance to yell before a hand clamped over his mouth and the world started to spin.
“No I wasn’t. There was a bug in my eye and I was trying to suffocate him.”
“Sorry, Tony. But if I let you know I was coming, you’d be gone in a flash.”
[11:24] Tony: Yeah.
“But you wish you were handling Steve, yeah?”
“I don’t know what to do. If I tell him now it’ll look like I’m jealous of whats-his-face, which I am, but I don’t want it to look that way. What do you think?”
“Yeah, baby.” Tony tipped his head back and closed his eyes, both hands landing in Steve’s hair. It was twisted and mussed from his helmet, and Tony combed through the strands, smoothing it out again as Steve’s mouth worked its way closer to Tony’s cock. Steve’s skin was still cool, but his tongue licked a hot swathe up the length of Tony’s shaft, and he shuddered, from tip to tail, toes curling in the sheets.
It was exactly as Tony had left it, not even a water glass on the counter to announce Steve’s presence. Maybe Steve had gone into Fury’s room to sleep, after all, trading with Bruce. And Tony couldn’t bear to go back upstairs. Back into the tension and frustration and guilt they were all wallowing in, heavy, like a fog, or a disgusting soup of oppressive self-judgement. The quinjet had been full of it on the way back, and now they were all stinking up Clint’s house with it.
"Steve…" Tony wanted to warn him, knew what must be coming next, but Steve just shook his head. Tony felt a touch on his finger that didn't feel like the tentacles and he craned his head up to see Steve's hand working its way across the smooth white wall. The tentacle around Steve's wrist didn't seem to mind, actually reaching out to bind itself to the tentacle that held Tony, and Steve took the opportunity to wind their fingers together.
Tony grinned. "Well, how about that? You're still two hundred and twenty pounds of kickass but now you're in a five pound bag."
"You alright?" Tony asked.
Steve’s nostrils flared slightly, confirming what he already knew, and Tony resisted the urge to fling himself across the room, rub his face in Steve’s neck, scent him up again. Claim him. “I can count.”
But Tony’s skin was pale and waxy under Steve’s hands already, his heartbeat sounding distant, like it was echoing down a hallway, and Steve needed to make a choice.
"Mmm. Merry Christmas," he yawned, looking between both men. "Did...did you make hot chocolate?"
"That's what worries me. People take advantage of that,"
Tony laughed.
"Normally parents don't throw food at their kids,"
"Just let me handle it, please. I need to take care of it myself,"
"What?"
Iron Man being knocked from the sky, his armour bent and shattered around his body. Captain America bleeding and swollen on the dirty ground. Being hit over and over again. Seeing it happen to anyone was painful, but watching it happen to his parents made him want to be sick.
"You want to make
"This is dirt, buddy," Tony pointed. "Where's the carrots?"
"He was limping," the boy added, remembering. "And Papa's face was all bloody..."
But Peter, who normally woke up less than an hour after Steve on a norma day, was already making his way down the hall. Steve could hear his footsteps, slow at first and then quickly until their bedroom door was being pushed open. As soon as Peter saw his father was awake, he couldn't stop giggling. Steve lit up with a grin that let Peter know it was okay to come over and jump onto their bed. Normally Steve would do his best to leave Tony sleep peacefully, but not today.
"Oooh, I bet he was trying to fit your presents underneath!"
"I bet they're all gonna wish they could have glasses now, Pete, because you look
"Santa knows
Steve watched as Peter rubbed at his ears, smearing the lollipop mess all over his face. He was too tired to stay at the party, the noises now getting to him. When he began to whine again just a moment later, they knew it was time to leave.
Tony couldn't hold back his laugh.
Tony, looked down at his costume and nodded in understanding.
"Go back to sleep, we've got nowhere to be," Tony encouraged.
"Daddy!" Peter yelled, running right toward his father's lap.
So later that evening, Natasha arrived with a stern warning look on her face. She was in costume and she dared anyone to say a word about it. Peter had always wanted her to get into the Halloween spirit with him and she had planned to dress as a scary skeleton for the party. She knew it would cheer the boy up.
"I already went on that one with you, Pete," Tony reminded, rubbing his son's back in hopes of settling him a little.
"This is it," Tony declared. "New and forever favourite mug,"
"Whoa, hey," Tony frowned. "Jesus, what's in your mouth Pete?"
"You do, don't you? You play us all so well," his father continued.
Peter could deal with that.
"It's too big, isn't it?"
A few minutes later, Tony was knocking on Peter's door. He could hear music playing inside, could hear Ned's voice talking rapidly, and he could practically hear Peter's nerves shuddering through the whole building.
"Daddy," he whispered, grabbing onto Tony's face to gain his full attention, doing his best to whisper. "Will you be sneaky wif me? Play wif the weindeers?"
"Space Mountain? The kid won't be going on that!" Clint shook his head. "Do you see how little he is? They don't let little kids go on that,"
Peter thought for a moment.
Peter nodded, fixing himself up. He fiddled with his bowtie, eventually leading to Tony taking over to straighten it out and make sure his suit was perfect.
"Now I want you to match me, okay? When I take a big, deep breath, I want you to talk one with me," Steve instructed, taking his son's hand into his palm. "Okay, first big breath, here we go,"
He had been on It's A Small World three times now.
Peter was quiet for a moment.
"I just didn't think to check his mouth," Steve sighed.
"I think you do,"
"If we went to Disneyland, you wouldn't be able to go running off like you do at the park, you know? You would have to stay with me and papa at all times. You'd have to be holding one of our hands all day, okay?"
"Hey there kiddo," Tony sighed, taking a deep breath. "You uh, you really stuck to the clown costume idea, didn't you?"
