“Uh?  Steve?”  Pepper was looking at him expectantly.  (Oh, right.  I should go.  You think I don’t belong here.)
The elevator doors closed. They were standing close together, Tony still holding the Captain’s sleeve. He let go abruptly, but didn’t step away; Cap still had that pinched expression from before, eyes a little unfocused, looking away. Tony swallowed.
“Tony Stark?”
Steve turned to look at Tony. “Do the books ever say how we met?”
(Ah!  Oh God.)
with us.”
feel inadequate.) Part of him wanted to laugh.
—as in without a bunch of Doms to ‘look after me.’ ”
bad Italian food, but for Steve he could put a brave face on any culinary disaster.)
Tony cleared his throat, still feeling disoriented.   Maybe this was a bizarre dream?
JARVIS was reading to him when he woke up, like he always did on Tony’s solo, post-scene mornings.  Usually it was fine.  JARVIS was better than a stranger, even a corporeal one.  When Tony woke up though—still half under—he’d had seven voicemails from Obie marked ‘urgent.’  He listened to them.
“That’s no excuse, though,” Tony said. “They should have thought.”
“Maybe don’t do that,” Steve suggested with a hint of a smile.
-- Tower security had arrived before Hanson'd moved from the non-consensual hitting to non-consensual other things...)
“Good boy.”
Bruce’s look was pained and sheepish.
Tissue damage!  (Sounds so serious…)  How could Tony keep track of all that?  (Isn’t it stressful?)
“Fuck, I love you.”
Cap got the door and gestured them all through. Clint took the lead, Bruce and Natasha trailing slightly behind him talking quietly. Rogers was giving Tony an uncertain look—his eyes flicked to the door, then back to Tony.
“Seven.” Steve said it firmly, decisively. “I’ll pick you up at seven.”
“Don’t you have someplace to be?” Tony asked, exasperated.
“Now,” Pepper said in her faux bossy voice, “here’s what we’re going to do: you’re gonna get your workshop Ben & Jerry’s stash, I’m gonna make myself a margarita, and you’re gonna spill! I want the blow-by-blow, gorgeous, gory details from the beginning. I’m living in a romantic wasteland and apparently you’ve been holding out on me!”
“I’m glad to hear that,” Steve said, trying to show the depth of his sincerity.  From the way Rhodes expression tightened it hadn’t worked. Steve finished wrapping his hand and tried to push his nerves at bay.  He pressed on: “Actually, I’m glad to see you. I wrote to Tony. Maybe you could give him my letter the next time you visit?”
“And the electromagnetic radiation has actually decreased,” Bruce added, bringing up the old data points at the second console.
“What about Steve?” Clint asked, frowning. “I bet he’d love it!”
(Oh right.)
“True,” Tony conceded. “But I trust you.” Tony reached up to caress Steve’s furrowed brow. “And I don’t scare off that easily once I trust someone.”
Steve shrugged.
“Hey!” Tony squawked. “We threw out the ones that caught fire!”
“There in three, two, one,” Tony said, and gave Clint a lift, scooping him away from onrushing spiders. Tony flipped the faceplate up. “I—I’m sorry.”
.  I was twelve.”
“Before, behind,”
“Jen.”
“It’s sort of beautiful, isn’t it?” Bruce said quietly at his elbow. It was just what Tony’d been thinking. He flipped the faceplate up and smiled.
“Sure, Tony.” Bruce summoned a smile.
“It was cold the day Bucky—“
Tony blinked.  (Huh?)
“And turn up the heat, JARVIS. It's freezing down here.”
“A pleasure, Ms. St-James,” Steve said politely, shaking her hand.
Steve barely suppressed a gasp of indignation-- (You-- you-- How? You--!)-- until Pepper continued with a loud sigh, “But that would be a bit rich coming from
“I must warn you that the artist can be . . . difficult. Fickle. Hard to work with.”
.  I . . . just want you to be safe and happy.  I couldn’t bear to see you get hurt.  You know that.”
Tony continued shucking his armor, eager to follow them.  (Shit.)  Steve was frowning at the doorway.
“Maybe a common floor?  With a communal kitchen?  And an entertainment room?”
Steve ducked his head, then asked, gesturing to the elevator, “Shall we?”
“All right, Cap?”
And then there were the people speculating about Steve’s mystery sub. Lots were posting pictures of Steve out running with Sam. Some speculated that Natasha was a secret switch, or even a sub. And a few suggested Tony. It wasn’t a popular theory and the objections were utterly predictable. (Too slutty! Too modern! Too old!) Tony rolled his eyes with an exasperated sigh. (Steve wasn’t going to like that. Any of that.)
And it wasn’t Pepper’s
Tony buttoned his shirt up all the way. He checked his phone, half expecting it to blare the Avengers Assemble or to be bursting with urgent R&D disaster emails from Pepper. There was nothing. Just his wallpaper: a photo of him with Pep and Rhodey squeezed into the frame, grinning like fools.
“It’s about safewords again.  You said you read wikipedia when you were doing the spreadsheet.  But, you just looked up the words?  Didn’t do any more exploring?”
(Damn.)
. Great!”
“I’m sorry, Mr. Stark.  Uh, Dr. Banner,” the kid looked nervously between them.  “Would you please wait for just a moment?”
.  No big deal.  “Bruce--” Steve took a deep breath. “Thank you.  I really appreciate your advice.”
(Oh. Oh, right.)
raptus submissium
“Mmm-hmmm.”
Steve was panting heavily, his face flushed with arousal, his eyes gleaming.  Tony could see his dick swelling in his pants.
Steve waved his hands.  “They’re a team, Tony!  And, okay, at first McCoy and Spock don’t get along, ‘cause they’re so different, but they eventually figure things out.  They’d all lay on the wire for each other or for the good of the Enterprise!  And, even in the little things, they take care of each other. They work together!”
(Well, obviously things weren’t super un-fine either.)
“Oh, and here—
And Steve had that absurd sad puppy look on his face, made all the more horrible by the way he was obviously trying *not* to make that face.
“Somebody has to,” Tony answered, as he rebooted another training dummy.
“Fine--pushing Shakespeare on
"I—" Steve swallowed harshly. "Yes, I—" He licked his lips and whispered: "I think about it. But not. Not like this. I--" There wasn't enough air, his heart was beating too fast and-- "I don't want to hurt you," Steve finished softly.
Tony hoped Steve’s research was going better than his was. Ugh. Bruce’s diagrams were all becoming a blur.  (Also, please be sexy research, please be sexy research! Surely that’s what Steve’s rakish smile and husky voice meant, right?)
“I was going to hit the gym,” Steve said, brow furrowed.
“You’re just pissed ‘cause they cock blocked you,” Hawkeye called.
Of course it’s—”  Tony’s mouth was twitching up at the corners.  “Oh.  I see.  Ha ha.”  Steve rolled his eyes and gave Tony a little punch.
“What, this?” Rhodey asked, with a nod at the crutch.  He made his way slowly into the living room.  His voice sounded tight.  “Didn’t you hear?  I’m changing careers.  Gonna be an actor.  If I wanna snag an academy award, I’d better be handy with crutches.  I’m working on my stutter too.”
“Should be ready in twenty minutes,” Steve said, checking the timer.  “So let’s start setting the table.  And, yes!  We’re eating at the table.  We have a guest and should eat like civilized humans.”
“It was actually on New Year’s Eve,” Tony said, “when we first agreed to go on a date.”
“Yeah,” Tony corrected. “Not—not Mrs. Rhodes. Avengers team. Them! Tell ‘em it’s a party!”
“Well, uh--” Steve’s eyes skittered nervously to Tony.
(Shit.) Tony’s stomach tightened uncomfortably.
“Of course, Bruce,” Steve said. He patted Tony’s shoulder as he went past, but didn’t stop.
relationships.  I mean, none of that matters.  I don’t want some stranger telling me how to behave with you and what things mean.  We’re doing this together-- I want
Steve nodded, but caught Tony’s hand again as he turned away.
“Happy Thanksgiving!” they answered.
“Yeah. We tell them,” Tony said decisively. “But first I get in touch with Katie and Mikie. Plan ahead for when—er, if—we want to be out to the general public. Keep Fury from trying to foist his PR idiot on us again.”
“Like hell you weren’t,” Tony growled.  “I can feed myself just fine, thanks.  I don’t need you to
“Steve, sweetheart,” Tony said, still at a loss for words.  He gave Steve a hug and took a deep breath.  “Come on.  Let’s not do this huddled at my bench, yeah?  Let’s at least go sit on the couch.  Come on, baby.”
Almost nervously, Tony wiped his fingers again and carefully peeled back the onion paper.
“Uh, wow,” Tony said awkwardly.  “What the hell was that?  I’ve never seen you spar like that before.”
Pepper Pott's expression was pinched, her lips a cold, tight line. She was very beautiful—sharp navy blue dress (modest, classy), crisp white blazer, hair down around her face.
Steve smiled. Tony slowly began to unwrap the tape, layer by layer to reveal Steve’s hands. They were large—so much larger than Tony’s—soft and smooth, but strong. It felt good to have Steve’s hand in his, to do this small thing for him. Tony felt more breathless than he should, just unwrapping his lover’s hands, winding some tape. The first hints of a blush tingled on his cheeks.
More waiting.
In the men’s room—or rather, ‘
Tony turned to her with a watery smile.
“Nah,” Tony shook his head and let out a little snort.  He waved his hand.  “I’m the one who got it wrong.  Rhodey said it was fine and to leave you alone.  That you were just a soldier having a bad day and it had nothing to do with us.”
his way towards military research on the mantis shrimp’s cell composition, which naturally turned into watching youtube clips of mantis shrimps and the mimic octopus, then surfing the best animal videos on the internet.**
)  He wasn’t having much success.  Tony gave a barely suppressed shudder of revulsion.  To think he’d nearly given that jerk a tumble when they’d first met.  (Ew.)
“Are you blushing for me, sweetheart?”
Rhodes rolled his eyes and turned towards Steve again with a wry smile, saying, “Tony may have some issues with authority, in case you hadn’t noticed.”
“Good.  Now that that’s settled,” Tony leaned closer for a seductive whisper, “I want you to go into the bedroom.”  Tony tried to sound commanding as he continued, “Take off all your clothes and kneel on the floor beside the bed.  I’ll join you in a few minutes.  Just wait for me and don’t move.  Okay, baby?”
Steve took two swift steps from the elevator and wrapped his arms around Tony. Tony could feel the cold lingering on Steve’s jacket, as he leaned down to press his chilled cheek to Tony’s neck, arms squeezing him tight. Tony reached up and hugged him back.
“Yes, sir?”
“Hi, Tony,” Bruce called. “I brought chana massala; figured you forgot about lunch.”
“Hey!” Tony Y. said indignantly. “You didn’t give me a sentence yet!”
“It was great! Awesome! Amazing! Like I told Rhodey, it was the perfect date.”
Tony took a deep breath.  He could smell Steve’s sweat, hints of his shampoo, the heady smell of sex hanging in the air.
“Your mom?” Steve asked, surprised. (And okay perhaps a little jealous. Know enough orphans and you start to assume
Steve turned the ornament over in his hands a few times, admiring the delicate carving.
“Okay,” Steve answered softly, eyes downcast. Tony squeezed his shoulder. Steve reached out to grab Tony’s hand, looking up at him with wide blue eyes. “Thank you, Tony.”
Rogers was the first out of the SUV; he watched Tony’s landing and the reconfigurations with unconcealed awe.
There was a long pause before Rhodey replied primly: “That’s none of your business.”
“He’s been overworking himself again,” Steve told them with a sigh.
Ta-da!  The chapter I was so nervous about.  Hope you liked it!  :-) Thanks so much for joining me and for all your support!
(Damn.)
Back at the Tower, Steve gave them ten minutes to change out of their uniforms before convening at the dinning room table for a debrief. Tony arrived first—after all, he just had to step out of the armor.
Steve. No stupid little thing could go wrong and ruin this. He wouldn’t let it.
Infinite thanks to everybody who has waited SO LONG for this chapter and sent me so much love, encouragement, and kindness!  This chapter was going to begin flashing forward to the Ranch, but then Tony just demanded that this part get written too.  So here it is.  I hope you like it!
Pathetic terrible platitudes—hollow philosophical soundbytes, religious reassurances Tony didn’t believe in—raced through his mind, and he rejected one after another after another.
—but he couldn’t get the words out around the lump in his throat. He closed his mouth again and nodded.
Tony took their empty glasses to the bar and poured them each a refill.
“Never mind,” Bruce cut him off, throwing his hands in the air. He took a deep breath and said more calmly. “Knowing will only make it worse. Just use the cookie cutters on the next set of dough, okay? Then you can decorate some when they come out. And stay on
Steve and Tony jerked their hands apart.
“If you like,” Tony said. “Wear it wherever you want. I just thought it would suit you.”
Tony wanted to scream with frustration.
Thank you for your patience.  Slow author is always slow.
Tony nodded and took a long drink from his water bottle. Clint had really put him through his paces.
“Wha--?” Tony rasped, trying to shake the mist from his mind.
Steve stared.
(Seriously, Rogers? What do you want?
“Beautiful, so fucking beautiful,” Tony murmured.  Steve was still shivering with orgasm as Tony eased his fingers free and pulled Steve to his knees.  Tony stood facing Steve, legs spread and cock dripping.
Rhodey just laughed. “Bull-fucking-shit, man. No way. You’ve got fractured bones and had some sort of space coma. Don’t even think about it.”
and it was fantastic.  Would go great with—oh yeah.
Steve nodded.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Tony. I didn't mean it the way it sounded.
Steve’s chest and throat felt tight, his skin hot; he was awash with a nearly overwhelming mix of guilt and gratitude, longing and joy.  He was at a loss for words, so instead he just
Steve raised his hand to Tony’s throat and caressed the bruise he’d left.
“Enough?”
“No, sir. Of course not,” Dominick said turning back to the slides.  “As I was saying, the agenda is to review the science team’s findings, the Avenger’s proposed off-site training exercises, and SHIELD’s support measures.”
Tony threaded his way through the fashionable crowd, skirting the now-busy dance floor. If Veronica Williams ever wanted to leave executive finance, she’d have no trouble starting a second career as a model. Tonight she had her braids down and was wearing her trademark stilettos to tower over the room; she was sporting a spotless white skirt tuxedo with red piping that matched her lipstick, her dark skin positively luminous, her brown eyes bright and lined with gold. (Gorgeous.) Tony hastened toward her and she welcomed him with a smile.
Quirking her brow Natasha added, "Besides it's not fair to remind Clint that he can never compete with you," a smirk pulled at red lips.
"Yep on my way. Might teleport in so don't take my head off, 'kay," he hung up.
"Science does have variables. Not many had the original donor's blood serum and none of those other subjects was Steve Rogers," she reminded him patiently.
He turned at the voice glaring challengingly, "Son you don't want to do that," he watched as they fanned out around him. Fighting the dizziness pressing in on him he readied himself for a fight.
"Yes Sir, Unfortunately, Doctor Yi and I have come up with little so far, I will continue to run scenarios for plausible solutions,"
Steve knew the older man was hiding behind the mask of playfulness. The brown eyes danced over the damaged tissue making a million assessments. Foregoing any attempt to hide the mess he'd made was his only option. Otherwise Tony would drop the mask and demand he stop training altogether, "I'm sorry, Sweetheart," he allowed his hands to be taken in the calloused ones of his husband.
"As far as I can tell his body is breaking down in a way similar to the way yours and Deadpool's regenerates," he stiffened at the sound of the arc reactor nearing them, "You have to convince Stark to let you help treat him," he urged, "Whatever made Wade the way he is and you the way you are might be the only way to save him,"
"Two days of rest did me good and I promise if I feel weak I'll stand down, Sweetheart," he caressed Tony's cheek.
There was a low growl from behind the men as Daredevil landed on the ground heavily, "Good to see you, Cap," he greeted, "While these three wouldn't pose a challenge for you, seeing as you are in my kitchen it would be professional courtesy to allow me to remind them of the cost of committing crime within my domain,"
Puzzled he looked at her before nodding.
"The more damage he does to himself the faster his cells are going to break down," she sighed.
"Emergency services are incoming and the last of the aliens is down," was all he could muster for a moment, stepping out of the suit, "Why did you leave that chamber,"
A wrench clattered to the ground as the billionaire turned abruptly, "What happened, there wasn't a secret mission was there," he demanded, thinking of all the ways he would make S.H.I.E.L.D. pay for sending Steve on a solo mission. It was something they had done before, though Steve had stopped agreeing to those once they had gotten married, he kept no secrets from Tony. He turned his blue vibranium wedding band absently as his mind ran various scenarios.
"You're on, Rich Boy," he shot back with a laugh.
His mind went back to that night two years ago as he shyly gifted Tony his dog tags, "It's all I have to give you really, that and my love," it was everything he had and he wanted Tony to have it to understand that there was no part of himself he wasn't willing to give to the man in his arms. Even if his husband was maybe just a little too drunk to probably remember this moment he would hold it in his heart forever.
"Peter maybe you should take a couple hours. I know you're close but maybe that's why you're coming up short,"
Silence for a moment, Tony looked over the image again, he saw the thinned walls on some of the cells. "Jay, answer the man,"
From the rubble, Spider-man was leaning most of his weight on Daredevil. The attorney tensed as he heard Steve, holding tighter to the young man in his arm. Clint was hauling Wade out from under a car his leg a tattered stump, "Damn Wilson you look like shit," he said loudly before he froze at the sight of Captain America standing beside Tony.
Sure enough in a series of fluid motions, he made brutally short work of the men. His fists making wet smacking sounds as he beat his lesson into them.
Tony was in the lab, he had lost track of time grabbing for the coffee cup as he stared over his schematics. It was Jarvis who informed him that Steve was insisting he eat something or he would activate the override protocols. "Yea fine Jay order me something...wait how long has it been," he asked.
He laughed, "Yeah I know him didn't figure you for being attracted to the short feral type,"
"And if anything does happen, Steve, I'm sure we can handle it and have plenty of allies to call on just this once. It's a small price to pay for us to get you back on the field permanently," Bruce assured.
Steve laid back on the platform, Bruce checking over the leads pressed into various parts of his body, "Ok Cap move your arms and legs like we discussed," he watched to see the that the i.v. in his arms and legs weren't disturbed by the movements, "Once the chamber closes around you make sure to move like that as needed. Sorry, we couldn't make it bigger," he scratched the back of his head.
One of the alien ships had taken flight once more and fired on Iron Man. Steve put everything into his thrusters in time to shield his husband. The blast hit the shield on his back as they were both knocked to the ground. Rolling he took the brunt of the impact protecting Tony's exposed leg and torso, "Tony, Sweetheart can you hear me," he asked. A second powerful energy blast hit him driving him away from his husband.
"Jay, get this damn glove off, please" the blonde demanded. Once the gauntlet fell with a clang he took his husband's face in hand, "I'm not going anywhere Tony. I'm not leaving you, do you hear me,"
Tears stung his eyes as he replied honestly, "I'd trade everything I owned for that love in a heartbeat,"
The second time, Tony smiled as he rolled over to find his face pressed against the firm chest, a warm arm wrapping around him, "Mmmm, morning Blue Eyes," he said sleepily. The sun was bright through their window as Jarvis informed them that it was "8:52 On Monday the 23rd, Sir," That same worm of unease returned. "Sleeping in on a weekday, I must be rubbing off on you," he pressed a kiss to the squared jaw, nibbling gently. He tried to ignore the fear that edged close, surprised to find tears in his eyes.
"Get some rest, Handsome," Tony pressed Steve back onto the bed, "Don't sweat it, Bird Brain. Just keep our team leader company would ya,"
Just then his window slid open as the wall-crawler let himself in, "Damn DD you weren't kidding he looks bad," he sat closer taking vitals, "What happened to him," his voice shook. Captain America was powerful, almost immortal this wasn't supposed to happen to him.
They all went over the research with Jarvis helpfully running the simulations as soon as they were put together until they found one that came closest to the original. They ran it several times trying for a shortened procedure time. Unfortunately the shortest they could accomplish it was a little over twenty-four hours.
"No," Tony's voice was sharp, "Enough people know and Steve didn't want anyone aside from the team aware of what was happening," he went over to his husband faceplate still down to hide his tears.
Clint rolled his eyes dramatically, "Alright enough padding Cap's ego who's up for a movie," he retracted the suggestion upon seeing Steve sag his shoulders tiredly, "Ugh actually I forgot I have stupid S.H.I.E.L.D. reports to finish up,"
Doctor Yi couldn't look at the man as she spoke, "Doctor Stark, I will continue to work on this. If we can keep the captain grounded it will be plenty of time to find a solution," she vowed.
Despite the situation, he smiled. Deadpool had that effect once he grew on someone, either that or the years as Spider-man's friend were softening him, "Captain America is unconscious in my apartment, unconscious and slowly dying," he became serious again.
Steve looked tired like Tony had never seen him before. There were dark circles under his brilliant blue eyes. "Sweetheart it's been two weeks... I...I," he hung his head miserably. "I'm sorry my love. Please don't hide in here from me anymore," his voice cracked, even though his head was bowed, Tony could tell he was crying.
Wade had just appeared beside Daredevil, "Hey Petey Pie," he greeted before looking over the fallen man, "You weren't lying, Red he looks bad,"
I hope you're enjoying this tale as it unfolds. Thank you as always for reading and staying with it.
Now as the chamber separated, the needles withdrawing from his skin he tried to temper the guilt of using it. The team needed him he could feel it in his heart and he would never abandon them, never abandon him. He was surprised to see the toned muscle had reappeared along with his enhanced senses.
"And we'll go to the Louvre so you can look at all the beautiful pieces on display," Tony holding the empty coffee cup to his mouth as he was looking over blueprints of a new constellation display for their bedroom ceiling. Having heard how much Steve wished they could see the stars at night he had begun working on this. The perfect gift to celebrate him returning to full health.
"So how long does Cap gotta sit in the toaster," Clint asked reaching for the mashed potatoes.
An amused tone, "You asked him to eat. You know unless you're here to make him something he falls back on junk food," she turned to her friend, "If something happens to me you take over coms and keep him calm,"
Steve was already moving to suit up and in moments he was on the landing pad stepping into his armor. His body felt much like it had before but he wouldn't risk it failing him at a crucial moment. Taking off he could see the fire from his aerial view the Iron Man suit was looking somewhat worse for the wear but Tony was up and flying. Relief flooded into his chest at the sight.
"Of course, Sir I believe it is time," the ever polite AI agreed.
"Doctor Stark, Doctor Banner," a female doctor called the attention of the two other men in the room, as she entered, "there are some anomalies in the results I'm not quite understanding. I could use your insight,"
Peter was looking into the microscope eyes burning from exhaustion.
Reading the formula Bruce raised his brows, "This looks hopeful have you shown it to Dr. Yi yet," he asked reading it over again.
Dobroye utro - Good Morning
"He knew Tony, he knows," Matt assured in a tight voice, "You were everything to him,"
Everyone is hopeful as a solution is found in an old friend.
Natasha swept her eyes over the damage as she set down a plate for him adding a fork. Setting one down for herself as well she shrugged, "I'm not particularly fond of the sauce getting on my fingers," she explained in such a cool voice that he accepted it.
Spider-man was stabbed in the stomach and slammed into the ground. Natasha closed the distance between her and the red colored alien hitting it with her stunner lines. Bringing her baton down sending another painful jolt of electricity through it. Just has Carnage grabbed her by the throat teeth bared, Wade threw out a small device which blared "Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites" loudly. He laughed, "Fear the Dubstep," before they contained the alien.
The hatch opened allowing him and Black Widow to jump from it as it self destructed. Firing an arrow into the side of a building just to have some of the debris snap the line throwing them into freefall as he reached for another. All the while Nat was teaching Steve to say "Dobroye utro"
Steve blinked back the tears as he remembered that night and in the two years since that night, he had never used his power. Tony trusted him and he had given that power when he was less than sober. Never wanting to break that trust he was happy to allow Tony his freedoms and only use his minimal Husband Override when Tony began neglecting himself.
"I would like to point out that as my husband you are just as rich," he reminded him putting on a burst of speed, "What's mine is yours and all," he added affectionately.
Steve looked awed, then swelled with love so great as he examined the armor. It had a silver star in the chest surrounding the arc reactor, the blue faceplate displaying his signature "A" complete with wings, the red and white vertical stripes ran down the suits plated abdomen and as promised there were brown metallic straps which met between the suit's shoulders holstering his beloved, well-worn shield. He pulled the genius into his arms kissing him fully on the lips, tongue darting out to taste into the older man's mouth. "How did I ever get so darn lucky," he breathed, lips still close.
Everyone was sitting talking about maybe going on a group outing in the near future. Bruce suggesting they go to the Greek Fair that was coming up. That turned to Tony naming off all his favorite Greek dishes. He then made a big fuss about how Steve hadn't actually cooked him any of his favorite dishes lately, "I'm pretty sure our marriage vows said something about homecooked meals being served to me while you wear nothing but an apron," he recollected.
"If I hadn't you would be dead," he took his husband's face in hand touching the blade of their noses together. Refusing to look away even as he felt his body tremble he smoothed his gloved thumbs over the cheeks. He could feel his body struggling and he didn't want to waste time taking off his gloves.
"I got everything right here in my arms. Tony you are everything to me," he murmured against the champagne flavored lips.
Eyes downcast, "You didn't finish the procedure, rapid cellular breakdown can occur as a result. In two years you never used the gift I gave you," he whispered bitterly, "The one time you use it, it breaks my heart," he still refused to look into the blue eyes.
It took the super soldier a moment to realize he could hear other things in the background. Explosions and screams rang in his ears and even though it was minimal Clint sounded somewhat tense. Allowing that much stress to bleed into his voice meant Natasha was hurt, "Hawkeye," it came out in the commanding tone not of Steve but Captain America, "Tell me what's going on,"
Tony's own eyes finally hardened, "You know what the most annoying thing about you is? You're too damned perfect. It's not just your body, you hear me," he demanded, forcing his husband to meet his eyes, "You're Steven Grant Rogers the man who jumped on that grenade without hesitation. That's who I love and that man is perfect and don't you ever forget that,"
A heavy metallic clang, drew their attention, "Cap let me check out your hand," Iron Man's voice a schooled calm thanks to Jarvis. Scanning the bones revealed no breaks or damage of any kind. The data caused a sour churn of unease in his stomach as opposed to comforting him. "Captain," he asked faceplate flipping up to reveal a worried look on the genius's face.
"No thanks. I really should go on patrol tonight. DD is probably ready to kill Wade and me now," Peter waved before heading out.
Tony only remained quiet looking away. He could care less what the world could handle he just knew it wasn't something his own heart could bear. Steve and his loving smile the way his beautiful blue eyes softened when they looked at him. To Steve, Tony was the whole world and the feeling was mutual, "Once he's rested we can get started on his gene therapy treatments,"
Translations
"I would never call you disabled. You are the farthest thing from it," Steve seemed scandalized by the notion.
"When did the search for a cure for my husband become a Tinder setup," he rolled his eyes dramatically, "Seriously though, Jay said you had something," he looked between them hopefully.
His knuckles smacked against the canvas bag sending shockwaves up his arm. Gritting his teeth he struck harder. The muscles in his arms burned, his shoulder jarring at the force with which he made contact with the heavy bag. There was a voice edging on alarm, "Captain Rogers perhaps you would like to take a break," Jarvis suggested.
Swallowing thickly, Steve drew in a breath closing his eyes. He tried to tell himself to trust in his team but fear clawed at the back of his mind. A cold dread that something bad was going to happen and he would be left alone clutched at his heart. Instinct told him he was needed, "Jarvis engage override protocol Wedding Vow," he sighed resignedly.
Steve took his face carefully in his hands, "Tony I'm right here, I'm fine. Nothing in this world could take me from you," he placed a reassuring kiss on his husband's lips, wrapping his arms firmly around the other man's back. "I love you, Anthony Edward Stark-Rogers," his lips moved carefully over the soft lips of the man atop him.
Tony just laughed pressing himself fully to the taller man, "Sickness and health, Babe. You act like you wouldn't do the same for me," his own eyes darkened. It was a fear he had, seeing himself age while the super soldier stood young not even taking their actual ages into account. Shaking his head to free himself of the image of himself elderly and enfeebled while Steve tended him still looking as young and beautiful as he was now.
Deadpool came to stand beside him, "Hey Cap," he said breathlessly, "DD says the aliens have weak spots right at the joints but there are still a fuck ton of 'em and they managed to gas Hulk,"
Clint rushed in an apology pouring out of him before he had fully taken in the scene, "I'm so sorry Cap, I didn't think the drop would hurt you,"
A sad smile stole over the older man's face, "I love you Steve and I'm not ready, I'll never be ready to be without you,"
"As handsome as your husband is, sometimes a girl just needs a romp with someone wild," she smirked looking into the eyepieces once more.
Get me out of this thing Jarvis," he ordered.
"I'm coming over and I'll let him know," the thwipp of webbing audible before he disconnected.
"And let you have all the fun? Never," Tony said squeezing his husband's hand. On the helipad, Steve's suit was waiting for him to step into it while Tony's closed over himself. Clint gave them a wave from the pilot's seat before they took off.
Smiling he gratefully took the steaming cup gulping it down, "I have an idea I just need the cells to cooperate," Peter glared at the microscope as if it were at fault.
"He was everything to me," he wept in the torn street which perfectly matched the ruin of his own heart.
Blood dripped from between the ragged strips of tape as he finally relented. He knew that tone. It meant that Tony had been alerted and would be sweeping in shortly. The least he could do was clean it up as much as possible to quell his husband's concerns. Heart thundering in his chest he unbound his hands. Looking over the knuckles revealed broken skin that was already purpling, "Christ," he spat.
"Of course, Sir,"
Steve pulled his cowl back, "I'm sorry Sweetheart," he whispered.
They met Peter and Wade in the elevator, "Cap, Shellhead you guys can sit this one out of you want," Deadpool offered.
"You're my teammate you were injured what else was I supposed to do," he asked.
The heroes get called to action and there's hope for Steve
"Alien invasion, Nat is down, Tony's got her and we have an assist from Team Red. Really, Cap, we've got this...Oh shit," he lunged from his perch as an energy blast took off part of the building. Firing an arrow he smacked into the side of another building before dropping down with a roll. The world went silent as his hearing aids fried out.
"Just a few more tests. Jarvis can you run sequence 34, please," he asked the AI.
Once they were in their bedroom Steve pulled Tony in for a tender kiss, "Thank you for all you've done for me, Sweetheart,"
Steve allowed his head to hang, shoulders sagging with exhaustion. The effects of the last fight still lingering in his fatigued body. He sighed in frustration at his failing body, brow drawn in a frown as he glared at his reflection in the large mirror on the dresser. The red metal glinted back at him accusingly from his finger.
"It's okay Petey that was three cycles longer than last time," Wade encouraged.
Back at the tower, Peter was having his middle wrapped in gauze the wound already mending. Tony looked him over as he asked, "Why did you send an email to Hank when I specifically told you not to," his eyes narrowed.
The suit crashed heavily into his arms, "Tony are you alright he asked setting them on a rooftop. Pulling the release on the face mask his husband smiled at him.
"Please be advised that the procedure was incomplete and there is no way of knowing the effects or their permanence, Captain," Jarvis warned.
Clint was sitting on the lab table with Wade, "Why can't we just use Deadpool's blood for the serum," resting his head on the bent knee.
Tony recognized the expression as irritation with himself, whatever it was, Steve was blaming himself for it. "Hey Handsome, we'll get it figured out," he smoothed a hand over the perfectly sculpted cheekbone, running it up through the blonde hair.
"Nah he's a smart fella and quite the talented artist," Tony soothed, "So is that a yes on Europe," he already knew the answer by the sound of his husband's voice.
"It's not your fault Clint. I lost my grip it's on me," he said firmly.
So I am trying to get at least one chapter for each of my works out as I will be taking a sabbatical from writing fanfic for 40 days starting March 4 to dedicate time to my novel. I hope you enjoy the latest installment as I feel this is nearing the end of this tale
Tony wanted to see Steve.  Tony wanted to see Steve right fucking now.
Tony tossed the extra scarf to Steve and wrapped his own scarf high around his neck. He added softly, gaze fixed on the floor, “You know, people assume deserts are always hot. But, at night? They actually get really cold. Even colder in caves.”
Steve watched as Tony’s delighted grin slid slowly from his face, turning more melancholy by the moment. (He loves her. Of course he still loves her.)
When he turned to offer Clint a plate of food, Bruce’s grin was so wide it looked nearly giddy. Tony was startled to realize how touching he found it—that Bruce could be so enthusiastically, truly happy for Tony’s romance, even when he was hurting over Betty. He gave Bruce the plate instead.
“Hey, JARVIS? Where’s Steve?”
p.s.  As I mentioned on tumblr (https://ms-meredith-milton.tumblr.com/post/631178760005337088/meredith-irl-things-suck), things IRL are pretty sad for me at the moment, so please no negative comments or even concrit.  Writing and sharing this story is my happy distraction from The Bad Things.  Thank you!
“I see the error of my ways,” Steve mumbled.
“Sorry,” Tony said, playing along. “He’s taking the night off.”
“Hi, sweetheart,” Steve murmured.
“Right. Back, side, together; front, side, together,” Tony prompted.
“Oh, fuck I love you!”  Tony blurted.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony took a few deep breaths and, wanting to do something, bowed his head and raised his palms.
“I wish there were something I could do,” Rogers said, sounding defeated.
“Of course, sir.”
“Come on. You'll feel better after a bath,” he said, stripping Tony of his t-shirt. Tony was giving him this strange little look, brow slightly creased, eyes wide and tired. (Bloodshot. And tear tracks down his cheeks. Oh, Tony.)
Steve was having trouble breathing.  For God’s sake, Tony had offered to give up Iron Man to keep Pepper!  It had been his last ditch attempt to keep her from leaving . . . (I bet he doesn’t remember telling me that; he did black out.  Oh, God he’d have done it too, at least for a while. . .  it would have killed him inside, but he offered, he’d have tried to leave the team to keep her.  I hate that, I hate it, I hate it . . .)  Steve took a long gasping breath.  Was there anything Tony
“Of course. Good luck with it.”

(Huh.)
“Wow.  That sounds amazing.”
“Hey, so did Cap tell you I introduced him to
apology.
“Hey, J?
Tony was silent, considering.
“Seriously, Steve, you should come help me with these eggs,” Tony said, tone his usual brazenness but volume a little lowered. “I mean, what if I get eggshells in there? Are eggshells poisonous? See? I don’t even know these things!”
It was surprisingly fun. Different from the fun and games with the team, battling simulated zombies and giant robots, but fun. Tony was working up a decent sweat and, although Rogers was clearly taking it easy on him in some ways, it felt okay. Cap pulled his punches to avoid hurting Tony, but he didn’t ignore any openings. And Rogers was liberal with his praise—“Nice!” “Good shot!” even an “Ow. Shoot!”—but it was punctuated with frank criticism and advice. So it was good, really good and Tony was already looking forward to making it a regular thing.
Tony nodded and rolled off the couch.
Steve was panting harshly against his neck.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Good,” Tony said, still rubbing teasing little circles lightly at Steve’s entrance.  “Deep breaths.  Relax.  Good . . . you’re so good. . .”
“It would be good to see you . . .” Pepper mused with a hint of longing.
“You don’t have to like it,” Nat said.  “But you do have to get over it. It’s done--in the past. And in the present we’re a team, even when we disagree.”
Steve bit his earlobe then sucked on it, still stroking Tony’s sensitive nub with light fingers. Tony whined.
“Have you gentlemen decided on dessert?”
“What’s the matter?”  Harris asked, frustration edging into his tone.  “I’m a really nice guy—why’re you shooting me down so fast?”
Steve’s eyes narrowed. “I think God’ll forgive me for missing Mass once every blue moon.” He frowned. “And I’d hardly have expected
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony soon lost track of time, adrift in the repetitious motions of rocking Steve in his arms, stroking him like a cat, murmuring the same useless platitudes to him in a loop.  Little by little, Steve’s heaving sobs diminished in frequency, subsiding to intermittent gasps and little tremors.
, aren’t we?  Even if some weird little part of me still hates you for hurting him while simultaneously feeling hideously grateful that you did, and, yeah, that really doesn’t make me feel so good . . .)  Pepper was still talking—something about ties and cell phones?—and digging in Tony’s closet again.
—and he kind of wanted to kiss them, but his stomach was twisting and he also
(I love Bruce!) Steve nearly sagged with relief.
“Tony? May I come in? I brought you some—“ Steve stood in the doorway of the workshop holding a steaming mug and a small plate. “Oh! Hello. I’m sorry to interrupt.”
“Look,” Bruce said softly when they’d calmed. “I didn’t mean to disrespect the plan. But Tony, I’m
Tony just shrugged.
“Well, it’s my Tower,” Tony said blandly as he poured himself a glass of club soda.
“Steve. Yeah, sure.” Tony paused, then added, fumbling around for one of the big coffee cups, “Still gonna call you Cap, though.”
“Yeah? Well, you did," Tony grumbled. "And I lost my train of thought.” Tony turned back to the soft-glowing screens and added, not looking, “So, food, coffee, whatever, thanks, but just leave it on the table and let me work. I told you to stay out of the workshop, okay? I'm busy.”
Tony honestly didn't think about Jason Hanson very often these days, that handsome, arrogant, sack of shit.  For a trial that dragged on for weeks, the actual events had taken mere moments.  The intricate rope bondage had been secure and felt great, but then he'd hit Tony-- hit him with a force far beyond the 'light slapping' Tony had okayed in their negotiations on the way home from the bar.  Tony'd “yellowed.”  Hanson hadn't stopped; he’d started hitting Tony as hard as he could.  Tony'd safeworded and struggled to get free.  Hanson hadn't stopped.  Tony safeworded again.
Rhodey rolling his eyes. “But what about your team? Do they have plans?”
Tony swallowed.
him. Something!
“Wholeheartedly.”
“I wasn’t,” Fury said. “And yet here I am.”  Fury tilted his head ever so slightly, and asked, “That a problem, Agent?”
“Yes, Steve,” Tony gasped. “Yes, please.”
Steve took a long slow breath, then another; Tony matched his breathing.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Really?” Steve’s ‘shocked but pleased face’ was kind of adorable.
“You wish!”
“Good health,” Steve replied. He wrapped his chilled fingers gratefully around the warm cup.
“Oh my God,” Bruce breathed, “Is it— Did the electromagnetic radiation just—I mean, the force carrier should be able to—”
”  Tony stared at her, eyes wide.  (Wow. That was . . . wow.)  “Well,” she said with a little smirk.  “I’m gonna hit the showers.”
“Get on your knees for me, baby,” Tony said, pushing him down.  (Yes!)  Steve whimpered.  “Good boy,” Tony said and caressed his cheek before grabbing his hair again.
Steve’s body was warm and solid against his--wonderful.
(Well, that was something.  He knew he looked
“Still working on the portal devices?”
(Shit. Why hadn’t he thought to . . .?)
“Should I have worn my steel toe shoes?” Tony joked.
Steve drew back and looked down at him, smiling. He caressed Tony’s cheek and asked, “Can I get a check-in?”
“Tony?” Steve said, voice soft and tentative. “You okay?”
Bruce’s laugh sounded a trifle nervous as he answered Steve’s question: “Yeah, Tony’s surfaced for air a few times.”
There’s more world-building (particularly re: international kink / racism / cross-cultural practices) coming up, but it didn’t fit here thematically.  Sorry!
plausible at least . . .)
“Check.”
“No names yet,” the Captain says smiling. “But I’ll tell you this much: I’m attending the Maria Stark Fundraiser Gala with my sub on Valentine’s day. You’ll find out then.”
“Thanks,” Steve said, smiling again. He glanced down at his watch—an actual wristwatch—and said, “Well, time to baste.”
“I don’t really understand,” Steve admitted.  “But it’s still interesting.”  (Keep talking!)  Tony shrugged and looked at his watch again.  (I’m obviously wasting his time.)  Tony didn’t take up where he’d left off.
century” in that admission?
“All my cars are fast! And don’t underestimate my cars or my packing abilities!”
(Wow.  Are you trying to distract me with sex?  Okay, then we’re more similar than I thought.)
“Fuck, Clint,” Tony fumbled, eyes stinging. “I’m so sorry, I--”
“Uh, right.”  Tony swallowed, embarrassed and guilty.  “I probably shouldn’t have thrown that away,” Tony conceded.  “I, uh—“
“No excuse,” Steve said, shaking his head. Tony shrugged.
and--
“And you must be Steve!  So handsome!” Chad fawned.  “Oh, Tony, I’m just so happy for you--I could die!”
The portal was shimmering again. Tony braced himself for the next one.
Tony smiled.
Tony frowned, then shook himself a little.  “Okay.  Yeah, no problem.  So what do you suggest?”
Tony took a sip of coffee and lathered his loofa.  The hot water felt good pelting against his back and aching shoulders.
“Yep,” the bartender said, rummaging around in the bottom fridge, “though we don’t get many requests for it at events like this.”
make first cut,” Fury said bluntly.
“So,” Clint began, “You and Tony, huh?”
“Stay?”
“You've gotta be fucking kidding me with this shit,” Tony said angrily. “Seriously, Steve? Get out.”
! And food. Yay, sushi! Let’s go!”
“Look at you.  You fucking love it, don’t you?  Love sucking my cock, love being on your knees.”

understand it—but it’s beautiful.  There’s something aesthetically pleasing about the design. You wouldn’t know this, but I once wanted to be an artist, so sometimes I think I see things with an artist’s eye instead of just a soldier’s.”
“Yeah, no.  I’ll just build one. It’ll be way faster than waiting for them to argue about it and then deal with paperwork.” (Oh shit.) Bruce looked pretty damn impressed and it made Tony’s heart race just a little more.  (Fuck, don’t blush. Too soon for that.  Shit.)  “JARVIS? Reach out to Pepper—tell her I’m gonna need some of the materials from Hangar 27 stat.”
Tears were pooling in Tony’s eyes. (Why? What the fuck? What’s the matter with you? Nothing to cry about, stupid.)
Tony’s fit of pique had chased some of the worry from Rhodey’s face, though he didn’t look quite ready to drop it. Tony sighed. “We’re good. I just . . . there’s nothing to talk about.”
is setting me up,” Steve said firmly. “Not for the gala or anything else.” He glared at Nat before turning back to Tony. “Natasha’s been trying and won’t let it go, even when I said I’m not interested.”
And then Tony was padding towards him, quiet and barefoot.  Head bowed, Steve could hear-- could practically feel-- Tony pacing a slow circle around him.
Tony sounded less apologetic than bragging.
“Good. Malibu was gorgeous; Pep and I worked on our tans.”   Tony shrugged. “Of course, I’d be even better now if we could skip this gala, but it’ll probably be fine once we get there.”
Steve frowned, but answered mildly. “That’s not for me to say.”
Tony slept for ten hours.  Pepper had arrived from California and settled into his guest room while he slept, then gone down to the tenth floor to work on something or other.  Tony made coffee and hopped in the shower.  (What? There’s a special ledge for his mug that keeps it out of the spray, okay?  Efficiency, people.  Efficiency.)
The change was disorienting.
“Don’t be like that,” Belford said.
After a few moments he reached up for Steve’s hand, pulled it around to kiss his palm and then moved it to his head.  (Hint hint.) Steve chuckled and began to stroke his hair.
“Sure, I hate it from a coworker, or at SHIELD—” Tony said with a shrug, “—but this is a date and I just gave you permission. So.”
Tony laughed.  “Old one-eye giving you busy work?”
He brought Steve his favorite beer, dished out two heaping plates of food, and joined Steve on the couch.
“Don’t move,” Tony said, voice muffled by his helmet.  “Stay just like that.”
It only took an instant—the delicate scent of honeysuckle brought it all rushing back: Rebecca Martinez, Sam Deetz, and all the delightful reasons for his wonderfully sore muscles. Tony let his eyes flutter open. No sign of Sam, but Rebecca was curled up in her pink satin robe to his right, a tablet across her knees and a mug of coffee clutched in her left hand.
“Hey, JARVIS?” Tony called as he rode down to his workshop. “You didn’t mention that you were giving Rogers history quizzes.”
Steve gagged. He pulled the dildo out of his mouth and took a deep breath.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
“So good,” Steve choked out.  “Tony, Tony, so good . . . so . . .”
“This is me!” Tony yelled. His hands cut through the air in sharp angry gestures; it felt like throwing a punch. “This is what I do and if you don't like it, fuck you! Fuck you, Steve! Just fuck the fuck off,
Tony squawked and his jaw dropped.  (Yeah, ick— should have swallowed first.)  And Steve was looking at him with his ‘trying to suppress my grin and mostly failing’ look.
“Only if you’ll call me Tony.”
Tony’s surprise must have shown since Steve added with some pique, “They’ve got no right! As if my personal relationships have any bearing on my ability to serve my country.  And then Hill!  Hill gave me an earful about how I shouldn’t be selfish, how I should think of you—that I might be damaging your reputation--“
“Uh, just now?”
Pepper’s hand was firm and grounding on Tony’s neck. He took a deep breath. Then another.
And here's an example of a Northern Renaissance chaperon; I’d frankly love to see Tony Stark wearing this!: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaperon_(headgear)#/media/File:Portrait_of_a_Man_by_Jan_van_Eyck-small.jpg
Tony lingered in the “curious” column running the possibilities over in his mind.  He pictured his fingers wrapped around Steve’s throat, restricting his air for just a few moments, watching his face flush, then easing up and hearing Steve’s grateful breaths.  The thought thrilled Tony almost as much as it terrified him.  And then (fuck!) the thought of Steve kneeling, a thick black collar around his throat—it unleashed something possessive and powerful that made Tony feel like the arc reactor was super-charged and pulsing with energy.  (Mine, mine, mine!)  And (oh god, shit, fuck!) he was curious about
•	SHIELD SWAT Team 091
Tony slid past and left with Steve.
Back to normal.
“No.” Rogers hesitated, then added, “I was having trouble sleeping.”
“Great.  Thanks.”  Tony paused reaching out for a fresh screw.  “Actually, since you’re coming, bring over a dozen roses—red and white.  Have security send them up to the 50
Steve just shrugged.   “Uh. I hope that made sense.  Is . . .  was that what you wanted to know?”
“Bye! JARVIS, end call.”
Rogers had moved into Stark Tower seventeen days ago.
“You okay, man?” Clint asked.
youtube comments? No good can come of that!”
Tony turned.  The Dom smiling down at him could have walked straight out of central casting: Interchangeably Handsome Square-jawed White Dude Hero.  (I mean,
“You,” Tony said, pointing at Rogers, “were
Tony nodded and took another gulp of coffee.  Steve’s coffee had gone cold, but he took a sip anyway to have something to do.  They sat in silence on the couch.  Steve stared straight ahead, out the huge windows as the sun came up over New York. The rosy-fingered dawn.  They drank their coffee silently, but the silence was starting to itch, a tense scratchy feeling, and nature abhors a vacuum.
Encouraged, Steve redoubled his efforts.  (Relax.)  Steve shifted slightly to change the angle.
When Tony resurfaced, he found Pepper-- a vision of contrasts, her crisp white suit luminous against the black leather of the living room couch.  She leaned heavily into the thick, padded armrest, her lap weighted down with papers and her StarkTab.  She looked so beautiful.  She always did.
“One way to find out!”
(Huh.)
But sometimes Tony thought about what he might say if Rogers
“How’s Steve?”
, and it actually went well.  And I realized that I—  You had—”
.)Steve felt an answering jolt of arousal and a deeper warmth of reassurance.  (It’s good.  Everything’s fine. . .)
. . . )  Above him Tony gave a warm little chuckle as he continued to knead Steve’s neck and shoulders, pressing down hard with his thumbs.  It felt amazing.  (No one has ever touched me like this . . . God, you’re amazing.)  While Tony massaged him, Steve started to roll his hips, unthinking, against the mattress, giving his aching dick some of the friction he’d been longing for.
“Ms. Potts! I'm so sorry!” Steve exclaimed, grabbing her elbow when she stumbled. Pepper's expression was pinched and somehow colder than usual. “Are you all right?”
“Yup.  Come see.”
“Likewise, JARVIS,” Rogers said politely towards the ceiling.  Well, okay, fair enough—that was where the speakers were located.   But, boo!  Somebody must have warned Rogers about JARVIS just to spoil Tony’s fun. Tony’d been looking forward to watching Rogers freak out a little.
In the first, they were wearing street clothes on 8
Steve looked a little sheepish.
(Everything's gonna be okay.)
I really really hope you liked this!  Steve and I had quite a bit of performance anxiety here that made it really hard to write . . . so, uh, if you want to give your writer some aftercare, she'd really appreciate it.
(“Don’t use accusing language,” Pepper reminded him in his head. “Focus on your feelings, not the other person’s actions.”)
“Yeah,” Steve admitted with a huff.
Tony nodded and turned to the formation diagram.  “You’d group them in teams of three?”  Tony said tapping the paper.
Rhodey grinned and began, “Well, her name’s Miranda . . .”
(Oh God.)
“Totally! No problem! But, well, there are lots of really great books, you know. Don’t even have to go to the bookstore! You can order them online or just get an e-copy. JARVIS can give you a list if you like. He knows my favorites.”
Hope you liked it!  Sorry short chapter was short, but I hated to make you wait... And sorry for the terrible glitch in formatting earlier.  Thank you all for your extreme kindness and generosity!  I'm honored to share this story with you.
“What the hell are you talking about?” Clint asked, his blood rising in answer.
Steve tilted him back in his arms a little and took his mouth in a kiss.  It was gentle and slow, like Steve had all the time in the world to keep Tony naked and spread in his lap, tied and wanting. Steve’s tongue was hot and heavy in his mouth, his hand solid and firm at the back of Tony’s neck.
“I think your plans to relocate SHEILD’s spectrometer is plenty my business,” Fury said.
They murmured their acquiescence. Tony’s jaw nearly dropped at the sight of William Tyrone Macmillan III leaving a serious a business negotiation for a trivial social nicety.
“No, not really.”  Steve bit his lip.
Tony held back a grimace.  (So it was like
“Oh?  Which branch?”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Tony chewed at his roast beef on rye. Clint swiped at the tablet, skimming the article with a frown and shaking his head. Tony swallowed and, after a moment’s hesitation, took another bite.
“You just carry that around with you?  When you go to the gym?”
(I feel like you’re hesitating to be intimate with me and I’d like to talk about it. Please.)
Jackie turned the water on and put a hand carefully against Tony’s forehead. (He never let any water spray onto Tony’s face.)
“Yeah, you too,” Tony said, feeling unexpectedly guilty as he watched Rogers walk away.
Steve didn’t bother standing to give his presentation.  After all, he hadn’t discovered Powerpoint or hadn’t cared for it—thank God!—so they all sat around the table while Steve described the maneuvers they had been practicing in the training facility at the Tower, the role Dr. Stark’s training robots would play, and the team’s plan for incrementally acclimatizing first Dr. Banner and then the Hulk to cooperation in simulated battle conditions. Agent Dominick listened with a little smile on his face, nodding frequently; Tony hated it.
“Tony, I called your name four times.”
Steve leaned close to kiss Tony on the cheek. He squeezed Tony’s wrists and murmured into his ear, “Do you like that?”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“You’re looking pretty good yourself, handsome,” Tony said, leaning up to kiss Steve’s cheek.  “So, where are we headed?”
Tony yawned; he’d slept in. He really shouldn’t be surprised—he’d been on the phone with Pepper until nearly 5 am.   11 am meant he’d missed brunch with the team—Steve always made them brunch on Sundays—but perhaps it was just as well. What would he have said?
. I just thought—he’s always seemed so old fashioned! I didn’t think you’d be his type.”
She got up to pour a second glass of wine and Tony hurried over for a hug.
“Tense!? No, I’m not!”
“But,” Steve added, “I’ll see you in the morning before we go to our SHIELD meeting, right?”
Seriously, she was wrong. Truly wrong. He and Tony had even talked about Howard once, early in their friendship. Tony'd been drunk and started ranting about Steve's "old buddy, Howard"; Steve had confessed that he hadn't really know Howard very well and, though he'd seemed like a swell guy back then, Steve had barely spent any time with him. He hadn't known Howard half, a third, a tenth as well as he knew Tony now. Tony'd started laughing hysterically, muttering “that fucking poser” over and over, then he'd fallen asleep and drooled on Steve's shoulder. So, it was fine. Really. But there was one thing . . . she was right about one thing.
“For the chef,” Tony said, offering Steve a glass and clinking his own against it.
“Mmmm?”
“I’ve got you,” Steve promised. He crouched down beside Tony and kissed his forehead, then his left palm, then his right.
Ella Fitzgerald crooned:
(Shit.)
“Shit. Yeah, all right.  Fine, J.  Just make it happen.”
“That it’s ok to have bad days,” Captain Rogers says, “That I don’t have to be perfect--nobody can be, no matter what myths people tell about them.”
The next day, Tony showed up to the training room at three on the dot. (What? He could be responsible. Besides, he’d maybe been looking forward to reclaiming a bit of his pride. This time, Rogers was going down!)
It only took Tony four hours to get to Malibu in the suit. Initially he was just out for a fly to clear his head, but the thought struck him after about twenty minutes looping around the Statue of Liberty that he hadn’t checked on the LA office in a long time. And Pepper would probably appreciate a friend after what sounded like a challenging Christmas. And he’d left some projects in the Malibu workshop. And the weather would be fantastic; no snow or ice in Malibu.
“5:27, sir.”
"I . . . I'd like to hear the details please," Steve said in a rough voice, looking between the two men. "You said there was more."
“There’s plenty of butter,” Tony assured her. She gave a satisfied nod.
“Hey, guys?” Tony said, flipping up the faceplate, “I’ve gotta take this call. Very important. Stark Industries! I’ll meet you back at the house. JARVIS can reboot the training robots if you’re not done yet.”
This was gonna be fun.
Tony took a deep breath.  “If you’re tied up, and I hear you say ‘stop’ I’m going to be grabbing the surgical scissors to get you lose as fast as I can and it’s gonna give me a jolt, like a bad ‘oh shit I distressed Steve’ jolt, but what if you were starting to say ‘stop teasing.’  Having a safeword, I don’t know—it’s like the big red reset button and if I know that you can hit it whenever you want I won’t worry about you as much.”  (Ah, shit.  I’m explaining this badly.)  “It means you don’t have to try and explain what’s wrong—it’s just one word, so even if you can’t put everything into sentences, I’ll know.  Everything stops.  It’s like a panic button.”
(Though if he were, we could get married right here in St. Michael’s!
“They don't know you at all, do they?” Pepper murmured softly, tone soothing.  “People don't know how good you are,” she said.  “How sweet you can be.”
Tony set his tray on the coffee table and flopped down in the middle of the couch. Bruce was giving them a kind of funny look. (Sheesh—we know about sewing machines. Not like it’s thermo-nuclear-astrophysics.)
“It's okay.” Steve smiled, just a little.
Peter helped fasten jewels to his ears and nipples, draping him expertly in chains and pearls and silks and damask. And as he did so, Peter released a torrent of speculation about the king: what he likes, dislikes, what he looks like, what kind of castle he keeps, what kind of food he eats.
Tony checked his email on his phone. Still no reply.
Tony frowned.  “Gimmie visual.”
“J.J. Adams’
“Good morning, boys,” Natasha called over her shoulder without looking at them as she headed for the kitchen.
“And,
“That’s good, sweetheart,” Steve said, still stroking his hair. Tony could hear a smile in his voice. “Very good.”
“Good.” Steve smiled at him. “I—“ He cut himself off to press a kiss to Tony’s lips. Tony propped up on one elbow and grabbed the back of Steve’s neck, pulling him closer, opening the kiss, pressing and teasing with lips and tongue and—
Tony’s coverage ranged from neutral to glowing, along with the others, but Captain America was their golden boy, their beautiful darling and the bulk of the coverage was devoted to him.
Pepper’s brow furrowed with concern. “I don’t know.” Pep shook her head. “She hasn’t said anything. It’s a common last name.”
“Oh, you know me,” Tony said with a teasing tone, laying one hand flirtatiously on the man’s chest, “I’m no good at asking for what I want.” Tony let out a theatrical sigh. “I’ve been on the sidelines all night wishing someone would lead me around the dance floor a few times, but alas.”
“Tony!” Pepper called, grabbing his wrist. “Dance with me! JARVIS, give us something good!”
“Yeah. I can’t believe he called me his best friend.”
“Sort of?”  Tony said. “More offering to find a way to share my art collection with the public.  If you like the idea.”
“Nice meeting you, Captain.”
“I wasn’t!  I take motorcycle safety very seriously.”  Steve grinned at Tony and gave him his most earnest look: “Besides—you know how law abiding I am in every respect.”
“Jessica K in the Bronx asks, ‘Who are you rooting for in the Superbowl’?”
“Do you think that’s likely?”
“Sir? Captain Rogers has returned and is in the elevator to the penthouse.”
From the corner of his eye, Tony could see Rogers' face tighten up; it looked like he'd swallowed something unpleasant.
Whatever she saw on Steve’s face made her rush on, “I checked regulations, sir.
“Now now, don’t overreact. You know that we all—“
Pepper reached up onto the high shelf—the one Tony couldn’t touch without a stepstool, damn it—to take down the coffee.
“Really?”
the one having a hard time?)
“You might ask one of your teammates to wait on you, sir.”
“Like what?  From what? I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“Tony, are you all right?”  Pepper asked, her flustered voice echoing across the speakers in the workshop.
c) never.”
“Not much.”  Rhodey gave an awkward, one-shouldered shrug, then grimaced.  “First, she asked if you’d already told me about your new ‘lover,’ which of course you hadn’t so, thanks for that.  Seriously, Pepper keeps score in her head, I just know it, and she’s
“Well how’d ya like that?” Steve asked shaking his head. “Lost interest already. That’s what I get for warning him. Now what am I gonna do for a model? Oh wait, he—“
With that, she slid abruptly from the booth and took a small envelope from her purse. She placed it on the table.
Tony wiped them off awkwardly with the sheet, then settled back against Steve.  He smiled and said in a teasing voice, “You know, it’s funny-- I don’t remember getting to bed last night.”
(-- you were starting to
“RAAAAAAAAARRRR!”
Tony startled as Bruce bumped his shoulder against him.  His brow was creased in concern.  “You okay, Tony?” Bruce murmured softly.
Steve left abruptly.
As Tony walked down the hallway, he could hear the sound of footfalls, unusually heavy and hard, as Rogers paced. He heard the Captain recite:
Tony swallowed.
” Rogers said seriously.  “It's a landmark case.  I read about it, and the StarkSafe (TM) when I was--” Rogers hesitated, “--catching up.”
“I’d be really interested to hear about some of the scenarios you’re imagining,” Rogers added.
Steve, trusted Steve--this was something Tony couldn’t have and something he couldn’t give Steve.
Steve, Bruce, and Mrs. Rhodes were clustered together in the kitchen, deep in conversation. Rhodey, Clint, and Natasha were out on the balcony under the heat lamps; and Pepper was stretched out across the couch, book in hand and washcloth on her forehead. After a moment’s hesitation, Tony crossed the room to squeeze in next to her on the couch.
“Oh, you don’t need t—“
Tony was no closer to a script for talking to Rogers than before. He was sorely tempted to wait until tomorrow morning, but Cap had seemed so miserable . . .. and, well, Tony was feeling pretty wound up too. He’d just wing it and get it over with. Tony’d always been good under pressure. He grabbed the bottle of scotch, a second glass, and headed for the stairs. (Even Tony didn’t take the elevator for one floor.)
“You’re perfect,” Steve said roughly, kissing Tony’s neck, his shoulders, his cheek. He seized Tony’s mouth in a kiss that Tony returned desperately and seemed to go on and on until, abruptly, Steve pulled back with a sudden breath.
Rogers cleared his throat and glanced away for a moment.
As Steve and Pepper started to do the clearing up, Mrs. Rhodes took a photo out of her purse and handed it to Tony. He laughed. She’d brought a picture of him at seventeen, Rhodey twenty-two: both of them looking like sullen teenagers, forced into photographs sitting down at a beautifully set Thanksgiving table.
“Yeah.” He stroked Steve’s hand and added, “You know it’s okay to be nervous? Most people are. And, well, if somebody
“Yeah. They were good to me here.” Steve shook his head and let out a little laugh. “I couldn’t afford to dine here properly back then, but Luca was always sending me home with left-overs or feeding me tidbits.”
Tony made another little circuit around him, then stopped face to face, reaching to cup Steve’s cheek and smile up at him.
“Then hell yeah!”
.” Tony paused, then glanced down at his stomach. And thighs. “Uh, sure.” He frowned. “Yeah, salad. Good idea.”
And Tony really wished that Bruce was back.
"Wow Nat, tell me how you really feel," Hawkeye mimed pulling an arrow from his heart.
"Hey, Doc can you tell Spidey to take a breather? He's been at this for the past fifty-six hours," Deadpool implored.
Sometime later Tony heard the warning "Husband Override Protocols activated, Rogers, Steven Grant," He had time to wipe his hand on a towel and adjust the grey tanktop before his spouse walked into the room. "Hey Handsome," he started his chipper greeting dying on his lips.
A third ship lighted down crumbling a building in its wake just as Hawkeye opened fire on the second, "Crap how many more are coming," he cursed, "What the hell," he shouted in surprise as the aliens jumped onto the Quinjet smashing the windshield with their large fists.
moment to show off those pictures, to reassure him and to—
(Oh, shit shit shit.)
Clint had the good grace to look momentarily sheepish.
Steve held in a snort.  (Virgins.)
“But--”
Tony glared.  He felt guilty—like his faith in Bruce was a
“See!  There it is again, the look and that ‘I could take you over my knee and spank you’ voice.  Do you use that on the board of directors?  Is that your secret to running Stark Industries?”
What had he gotten himself into?
him,” Cap said emphatically. Rogers started to say something more, then cut himself off and turned to Tony. “What do you think?”
If any of you lovely readers are also artists and would like to do artwork for this story, I'd be tremendously pleased and flattered; I'd be delighted to post a link!  In fact, if anybody would like to do a few specific photo manips for the next chapter, please let me know!  Thanks!!!
“Great! And thanks again for keeping my little secret.”
“I can’t believe you found one,” Steve said, shaking his head and looking at the sleek machine. “I figured a bike like this would be . . . obsolete now. Scrap.”
. . . )
Coffee and some time in the lab would help.  Maybe he’d work on a project with Bruce.
over 6’2.  6’4 maybe? And what the fuck with those
@wordswordswordsatworms
“Well, a lot of people are idiots,” Steve said bluntly, voice annoyed (and a bit more Brooklyn).  Rebecca let out a delighted laugh and nodded her agreement.
Clint blinked, surprised, as Tony flipped him over hard.
“Well, let’s get some lunch.”
Tony's hand waved through thin air.
“Minor!” Tony squawked in mock indignation. “Don't listen to him, Rhodey! Our battle with Doom-and-Gloom Bots was
“And yet here we are,” Steve murmured, smiling and drawing him close.

“Good luck with it,” Bruce said distractedly, already sinking back into the blueprints.
(For Steve.)
(See the end of the chapter for
“Bossy, aren’t we?”
“I regret that you are out of coffee, sir.”
Tony smiled.
“Dude!  Seriously, when will you drop the
one to talk—don’t tell me you’ve been getting a decent night’s sleep since that thing came back.”
And Tony would need at least thirty minutes to program the reversion device to auto-adjust and self-detonate. Actually, he’d probably need more like an hour to be sure. Even then there was only one way to make sure the device would work (if it could work at all).
(It had to be there somewhere—he kept some in all the kitchenettes of all his properties in case she visited.)
Rogers was there.  He sat hunched over and alone at the kitchen counter, surrounded at by the detritus of everyone’s breakfast.  Even with Rogers back turned to him, Tony could tell Rogers’ face was buried in his hands. Tony paused with a frown, the anxieties of breakfast momentarily forgotten.
Tony hovered. As soon as Bruce was gone, he said, “Steve? Do you have a minute?”
Steve hesitated. “Maybe? The serum—I, uh, I don’t know.”
“Bullshit,” Tony said, springing to his feet. “There’s no wrong mood for
. . .)
Thanks for reading! You guys are the best!
“That’s really great, Tony,” Rhodey said.  “He seems like a good guy.  I’m happy for you.”
Natasha parked the car and they all piled out.
“It’s just that—“
“Wow,” she said, with a rueful smile, “being here to see you off actually kinda sucks.”
“All right, Mr. Stark.  Thank you for inviting me in.”
“I’ve got you, sweetheart,” Steve promised, rubbing his smooth cheek against Tony’s hipbone. His warm breath fanned Tony’s eager cock.
“Soon as possible,” Tony said, peering at his face.
“Perish the thought.”
At last the Professor found the card he’d been looking for, but instead of handing it to Steve he held it, frowning.
Rogers took a half step towards the door, then paused.
Tony snorted—the sound echoed loudly from under the spectrometer.  “Uh, yeah. No,” Tony said, tightening the A-34 nut with a satisfying pull. “It’s not exactly a ‘flip that lever’ or ‘push a big red button’ situation.  I’ll do it myself.” Tony double-checked the alignment on the B-33s and C-8s.  Good.
“I’ll help!” Clint volunteered. “I don’t need to see Bruce’s naked body again.”
trying to chase you out.”
“Anyway,” the man said, shoulders back and head held high, “I took the picture for my grandson because I knew he’d be excited. I wasn’t gonna sell it or some nonsense.”
“Oh. Okay.” Tony fiddled with a screwdriver he absolutely didn’t need for anything. “How was it?”
“More,” Tony demanded again, “please, Steve, darling.”
“Of course, sir.”
Plate after heaping plate of delicious food arrived.  Steve asked their server to describe each of the dishes twice, committing ingredients and foreign names to memory.  (Adorable.  Adorable!)  They ate with their fingers, their knees brushing under the table.
“There. Okay?” Tony murmured. “Sit tight, buddy. There.” Tony pet awkwardly at the claw, glad Rhodey couldn’t see him now. The scotch burned going down in the best possible way.
Tony made everything seem so effortless, simple as breathing, natural as his genius.  Dominance seemed to flow from Tony’s body-- a reflex, an instinct.  It was silly, but Steve had sometimes wondered if that had drawn him to Tony in the first place, as if the hidden submissive inside him was calling out to Tony’s dominance for completion, finding yet another reason to love Tony beyond all the obvious ones anyone could see: Tony’s courage, his kindness, his fierce intelligence, his generosity, his sense of humor . . . Tony had taken charge like it was the most natural thing in the world for him, like he knew exactly what to do with Steve, exactly what Steve needed.
“Incoming call from Ms Potts, sir.”
Steve looked up abruptly.
“JARVIS?” he called.
Tony blinked.  (Not that he didn’t
“Look, I'm in a hurry. Just set that down would ya?”
Tony frowned. “Okay, what’s going on? You
“Rather a dull party,” Belford said as they stepped onto the balcony. "I’m not sorry to step out for a while. Especially with you.”
Steve wished he could remember more of the poetry he'd memorized in school as a child. Or the verse he'd learned later--the sort they never would have assigned, that he'd picked out himself, wide-eyed in the Brooklyn library.
Tony felt a sudden protective swell of irritation. So what? Cap wasn’t spilling great stories of the HCs omitted from the history books—books Rhodey’d already devoured in fannish rabidity second only to his obsession with the Tuskegee Airmen.
“I’m sure he didn’t mean that,” Steve said, crouching down to look at Dummy. “Jim says he’s very fond of you.”
“Thank you so much,” she said, turning back to Steve and sounding a little hesitant. “I’m very glad to hear it.”  A pause.  “I’m Francesca the chef and owner.”  Another pause.  “I heard from my staff that this is the second time you’ve dinned with us recently so—“ She shifted from foot to foot, eyes only for Steve.  “Sorry, this is probably a ridiculous question, but you see when I was little my grandparents used to tell me these stories and—”
(It’s why you left.  Well, part of it.)  Tony swallowed.  “Yeah.”  It came out a little rough.  He grabbed the tumbler at his elbow and threw back the contents.  (Oh yeah.  Water.)
Tony spun on his heel and found her, hand outstretched, expression too open for the Black Widow.  She looked like Natalie again.
“Good morning,” she said, voice perhaps a little smokier than usual.
Steve looked half embarrassed, hunched his shoulders a little, then bade them both a little goodbye and made his retreat.
(Yes! God, yes.  Please!)  Steve’s mind felt pleasantly cloudy, caught up in sensations: the almost-pain of Tony pulling his hair, the wet slide of the cock between his lips, its weight on his tongue, the musky smell of Tony’s sex.   But Steve realized distantly that what sounded like an order, was a question too, so he answered in his own way…
Me: I have legit never been this excited about Valentine’s Day!
only to have everything jerked back into place where it belonged.
Rhodey raised an eyebrow. “She’s got a list of 'things'.” Rhodey paused. “The list starts in the eighties. So, care to be more specific?”
“Delighted to make your acquaintance, Mr. Silverstein,” Sasha said, dropping his eyes and glancing up through his lashes.
“Well good,” Clint said. “Uh, ‘cause I maybe really like Christmas trees. Maybe. Are we gonna decorate it?”
“I’ll be in the workshop.”
The sub pressed forward to give him loud air kisses.  Tony pasted on a fake smile.
Tony looked up at Steve through his lashes and swirled his tongue artfully around Steve’s cockhead.
“Ok, ok. How about it goes in the living room? Or something else?” Tony said, then added with a grin, “You can always rotate them in and out of the Rogers Wing of the Brooklyn art museum.”
Tony jerked himself from Steve’s grasp, glass shards crunching under his shoes as he stepped away.
Tony’s eyes flicked back to the glowing screens.  He was
“Of course, Sir,” JARVIS replied just as quietly.
“Tony?”
It was awkward. Awkward to be there, awkward to put an arm under Stark’s—
Tony kissed him harder, passionate, almost frantic. Steve’s cock was hard and leaking in his trousers. He groaned and returned Tony’s kisses urgently.
Belford nodded. “Domosterone inhibits the key psychoactive properties; we’re developing a separate drug for top drop.” Belford gave a little shrug and added, “though I’m hardly best qualified to go into detail on the neurochemistry—I’m only CFO.”
The King’s cheeks went pink again.
Tony shuddered.
Steve ducked awkwardly, hunching down to make it under Tony’s arm, and trying visibly not to step on his partner’s feet.
“I’ve got you, Sam Adams, sit tight.”
“Ouph!” Tony hit the mat hard. Clint grinned down at him.
“Nah, just some of it,” the Captain says. “Bruce is a good cook; better than me. And we’re all connesours of an array of take out joints.”
Tony stretched and rolled his shoulders, feeling the pleasant pull in his muscles again.  (He was tempted to send Sam and Rebecca flowers.  Or a cactus.) Now that he’d cleared all the pressing issues from his docket, he needed a new project.
Bruce squinted. “Did you just build a sewing machine?”
A flash of memory came back to Tony, sudden and vivid:
“No,” Tony cut her off, raising his glass. “No talking. Just venting. And drinking! Shots!”
(He’s hot.  So what?  Doesn’t mean anything.)
“Without the armor,” Bruce said in his reasonable voice, “you’re the most vulnerable person on the team.”
big society events--far from his ideal Valentine’s.  (Or Tony’s.)
Mikie shook his head. “Archangel Gabriel.”
“I hate you.”
(Yeah, yeah, you’re always right, Pepper.)
. But he knew better than to interfere. At least, not yet.
“Sure--though I’m not much of a decorator. I DO hire people.”
Tony and Rhodey resumed their awkward shuffle. Once they finally reached his bedroom, Tony let himself go boneless and flopped face-first on the bed. (Ouph. Should’a done that more gently . . .)
“That it wasn’t right,” Steve said, “for me—as Captain of the Avengers—to . . . how did he put it?  Expect ‘certain things’ from you?”
Thanks again!
“Yes,” Steve answered. Tony glanced over at him nervously. “Thank you.”
He’d really thought that this was it—that Steve would Take Him To Bed, not just take him to his bed. Third date, right?
in a way touching up his temples since the age of 32 did not.
“I’m used to that,” Rogers answered, then added with a little smile, “and who’s to say I won’t surprise you?”
Tony shrugged and looked away.
The next morning, Pepper Potts used her power of attorney to check Tony Stark into rehab.
Eh. He needed a break.
She was making that blank, steely face she made when she was controlling her reactions, but not actually trying to deceive. It was her armor face, but not the mask. (Knew she’d been too quiet.)
“Come on, Cap,” he said, “You need a hot wet hole for your dick—and I’m right here. So let’s go, stud. Show me what you got.”
“You know
“Oh can it?” He was pretty sure Steve was teasing him. “Well, in that case—“
“I was about to make eggs for myself,” Rogers said. He set the newspaper aside.  “Would you like some?”
And then Pepper was crying.
“Well, yeah.  Genius.”
Steve took a deep breath and finally—
Rhodey rolled his eyes. “Yeah, go on. Act like you’re not down here to dote on your robo-dogs.”
"What kind of gifts," Steve asked half against his will.
“If you keep that up,” Tony gasped, “I’m not gonna last.”
“No.” Steve shook his head with a sad smile. “But thank you for stopping by.”
“Yes?”
Tony was like a rollercoaster. He could change on a dime and his every shift left Steve spinning in his wake.
Tony had been drinking coffee for hours, curried lentils and ham sandwich long since demolished.  (And, yeah, of course Steve brought both.)  Natasha’s new Widow’s Bite wasn’t as far along as he would have hoped.  He’d built the first section of basic circuitry, but he still wasn’t done with it and he hadn’t even started on the shell.  He checked the clock again.
—but the noise in his head crowded it away. Tony started pacing. It always drove Pepper nuts when he’d do that, bobbing in and out of frame, but he couldn’t help it.
“Really?” Colbert says. He glances at the cards in his hand and says, “Well, I’ve got a whole list of questions, but they don’t seem as interesting anymore.” Scattered laughter. Colbert leans in. “Say on! How’d you meet? Who is it and what’s this special sub like?”
Tony sighed. (Yeah, okay. His press had been too good to last. Something about The Pierre after all?)
“Yeah,” Steve said, voice rough. He cleared his throat. “Of course.”
Cheeks flaming, Steve gave a little nod.  Fury and Phillips both looked pleased.
“Yes, of course.  Thank you for taking time to show me around.”
“Do it, Pep,” Stark whispered. His voice was pained and so soft Steve couldn’t have heard without the serum. “Do it—has to be you. I can’t—please? Please? Do it for me? I’ll hate you, but I love you, Pep? Please? I can’t—”
“You should eat something.” Steve said, nudging him towards the pizza box.
“Be there in a mo—FUCK!”
Tony huffed. He kept trying to describe the engineering work he’d done earlier, but instead he just kept circling around to rant about how pissed he was at Bruce for his lack of faith in the plan.
“Yeah.” Tony smiled.  “We’re great.”
“Shhh. . .  ‘m sleepin,’ ” Tony muttered, words blurry.  “ ‘m havin’ a good dream.”  Tony ran his fingers lazily through Steve’s hair and tried to suppress a smile.  “Can’t wake up . . . ‘m dreamin’ Cap’n America’s in bed with me . . .”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Yep,” Tony said, trying not to resent Clint’s arrival. “Gonna crush you.”
“Put it in writing, and we’ll see. Just--”
"Mmmm, happy to see you too," Tony chuckled pressing his hands to the slightly less firm ass. He couldn't help but notice how the t-shirt no longer stretched tightly over the body. All of the little physical changes took away nothing from how he felt about the man in his arms. What he found truly heartbreaking was the insecurity radiating from his husband due to his appearance.
Tearfully Steve couldn't meet his eyes, "I know this has been hard on you. That's why I didn't disturb you while you processed, but well after so long I began to worry you were hiding from me,"
"Cause that nutjob is screwed up on the cellular level and there just ain't no fixin' him," a growling timber replied from the elevator beside Spider-man.
Peter was reading over the formula as Dr. Yi began separating the blood serum. He sat back for a moment, "It took the collective genius of five people to breakdown Erskin and Stark's original research,"
kak tvoi dela - How are you?
"Just a sec Brucie," he called over his shoulder.
The first time Tony noticed something was off they were closing a fight. Jarvis had alerted him to the fact that Steve was hit hard. From his aerial view, he watched with a small smile as the super soldier got back to his feet throwing his shield to take out the last of the robot soldiers. It was as it bounced back to him that Tony noticed something off, the fluid motion and catch that had occurred hundreds of times before failed. Steve jerked back slightly as the shield hit the ground falling out of his hand.
"Clint," it came out a worried cry, "Jarvis is the team okay? Is Tony okay," he asked. his heart rate spiked as he forced himself to calm down, "Jarvis please answer me,"
"I'll keep his head on straight, Red," Deadpool assured before getting tugged into the hug. Yea Peter had most definitely begun to make him soft.
"Hey Gorgeous," he smiled insisting on conveying confidence, Steve needed him to be strong because right now his husband was worried. "So whats up? You know faking a cold won't get you a lollipop here Steve," he ran a reassuring hand up his husband's arm.
Alarms blared loudly in his lab interrupting his reply, "Shit," he thought before promising to eat. Rushing from the lab he met Clint and Natasha in the elevator. Both of them looked at him questioningly, "He can't hear the alarms from in there," he answered the unasked question.
Holding the fork was going to be task enough, eating with the naan would certainly dirty his dressings. Graciously, he took the out even if that's not how she intended it.
"We were practicing a training mod and Cap, well he lost his grip for a minute. I tried to catch him but... Sorry Cap you're a heavy guy to one arm I thought my shoulder was gonna dislocate," he looked apologetically at their leader again. "I really thought you'd be okay if I swung you to the other training tower,"
"He's not dying," the words came out small, broken.
(See the end of the chapter for
Keeping good on his word Tony stepped off the elevator into the communal space, "Hold the door, Bird Brain," he grabbed a protein bar and bottle of water before rejoining them.
The billionaire's voice softened ever so slightly, "Maybe I just need a week of you all to myself," the corner of his mouth pulled for a second.
Looking up he could see one of the larger aliens aiming a gun Tony. The shield flew from his arm shattering the attacker's helmet and the tissue underneath. He could see Hulk lying limply in the street the green form motionless. The ship was still taking off even as aliens were scattered in the streets of his beloved city. Stepping out of the armor, "Remote piloting initiated. Jarvis take out that ship before it leaves the atmosphere," he ordered throwing his shield as the suit took flight.
"We'll get it figured out," he determined.
"Tony let us help him," Peter put a hand on the metal shoulder, "I won't involve anyone else directly if you don't want but please he's our friend too,"
Tony tugged the younger man's hand, "Take me to bed," he dropped his head on his husband's shoulder batting his eyes.
I know they never specify the actual serum that I can recall but I always suspected Logan's mutant DNA played a role. Especially considering that they were both apart of the super soldier program and fought alongside one another in WW2.  I hope you enjoy this latest chapter as it is the second to last. Thank you to those who have stuck with it.
"No one hits my Spidey, asshole," Wade yelled jumping from the roof katanas out.
"Sweetheart," a tired groan, "Where are we," he looked around surprised to see himself surrounded by the heroes.
Bruce entered with a fresh mug of coffee, "I figured you were burning out by now," he offered it up.
Warnings blared as a pumpkin bomb flew at him, but if he strayed off course he wouldn't catch his husband. Bracing his body the bomb detonated a few feet from him, "I got ya covered Cap," Clint's voice hailed from the coms while Peter was still fighting Carnage.
Steve was looking over the city smiling slightly at the beauty of the lights glittering across New York. They flew side by side as he commented on things that were bothering him Tony instructing Jarvis to remedy those he was able to and taking note of things he would have to alter in the lab, "Wanna race to Brooklyn, Cap," he asked mischievously.
Smacking her palm against his, "Now we just need to accelerate the bond with the gamma chamber," casually she asked, "So you know Wolverine,"
"Good idea, Nat," the billionaire agreed, "Care to join us for an Avenger's family dinner," he turned to the other two.
A small gasp escaped the brunette's lips, "Feeling up to it Old Man," he shot back knowing full well the answer.
Before he could answer she had smoothly made her way over to him, opening the medicine cabinet, "Remember that time I got shot in the glute and you had to help me pull the bullet out," she reminisced.
"Ok, Sweetheart, let's eat then we'll head out," he acquiesced.
"No Babe," Tony pulled his husband's face upward to meet his eyes, "I know my captain, I know the man I share my life with even better. Not being enhanced would not keep you off the field if your team was called so I built you a suit," He nodded to the ceiling so Jarvis could display the armor properly, "I give you the Iron Captain. It even has the same spot for your shield along with a few embellishments of my own,"
The conviction burning in her eyes was hard to face, "I'm not really Captain America anymore, he is an unbreakable super soldier," he reminded her.
Tears glimmered in the dark eyes. He understood the gesture and wanted to return it in kind, "It's everything and I want to give you everything too, Steve," he kissed him lovingly.
"Yea well as punishment you have to put up with Spider-man and Deadpool for a few days while I work on your suit," he scooped up the blonde before walking over to the fire escape, "Thanks Devil,"
"I shouldn't have dropped you, shoulda taken my chances that my arm woulda held up," Hawkeye said dejectedly.
I hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it. As always thanks to those who read it.
"Hey, Sweetheart what's the matter," Steve asked voice thick with concern. He pulled Tony's face up to meet the tearful brown eyes with his loving blues. Brows knit with worry, face sharp and attentive. "Tony what's the matter,"
"I'll take over coms," Nat offered, knowing she could pull off the calmest demeanor. Steve could be mad at them for keeping him in the dark later. Right now she knew it was for the best as he would tear himself up with guilt.
"Sides Cap," Clint said from the doorway, "I'm not enhanced, matter of fact," gesturing to the hearing aids, "I'm actually disabled according to most. Yet, I still somehow manage to keep up with you guys,"
"I'm a sucker for the uniform you know that," Tony answered coyly, running his hands up the still perfectly sculpted chest. Looking onto the beautiful yet weary face of his partner, however, gave him pause, "Tell you what I'll hit the shower then I would really love to sleep in our bed beside my husband," he suggested with the hint of a plea.
"I'm not really sure," Steve admitted face still pinched.
Tony was reading over the progress reports from Dr. Yi, Peter, and Bruce. Chewing on his cheek his mouth quirked. Not for the first time since this happened did he find himself wishing he had taken an interest in biological sciences, "Jay can you pull up the notes from Dr. Erskine again and my dad's too,"
"Husband, Tony, we got married remember, you were there," he grinned, "I'm fine, Sweetheart," pulling the red glove from his hand before gently running his thumb over the older man's cheek.
Tony was in the workshop finishing up the final touches on the lastest Iron Man suit when Bruce entered the room. "Uh, Tony,"
"Your husband is eating and it's time for your Russian lesson," the redhead said as they walked onto the air pad. Taking long strides she passed the blue armor waiting for it's wearer a small smile thinking he would no longer need it after this.
After they left Bruce looked over the cellscape it looked like a war zone of burst cells. Frowning, "Hey Jay what exactly did Peter ask you to do," he rolled up his sleeves.
"Dammit. Hey Jarvis, remember that thing I asked you to do in this case," he looked anxiously at Bruce for a moment.
"How long will all of this take do you think," Steve asked before pinching his brow, "I'm tired of being...this," he gestured to his body with barely concealed disgust.
He didn't question the wire wrapping around his arm just gripped tighter to his friend as they were both jerked to a stop. Looking up he saw the red suit against the darkening sky just as Spider-man swung overhead webbing up two of the aliens. Deadpool firing from his spot on the rooftop as Hulk barrelled through some on the ground before being hit with an energy blast.
The fatigue won out as Steve felt the world swim out of focus. Realizing he had been caught and thrown over a red leather shoulder.
The doctor stretched her back, "As much as I love being the Avenger's resident physician I do have a life outside of these walls," she told them to call her if anything came up.
The quirk of red lips, "You know we still have Russian lessons to go over, Steve," Nat arched a brow, "No excuses about time now,"
"I was stupid, I'm sorry my love," he took the metal hand, "Carry me home," he asked softly.
Jarvis had selected a varied music playlist, shuffling between Rolling Stones, AC/DC and the Beatles and Etta James and Duke Ellington. Even the A.I. seemed to be pleased offering more commentary than usual. All the doubts and fears dissipated now that the uncertainty had been removed the team moved as if everything had already been resolved and they were just waiting for their next mission, ready to follow their captain into battle.
"Twenty-six hours," Bruce and Tony answered at the same time laughing.
On the ground, it picked up a man running for cover cackling as he went to bite the head from the man's shoulders. Webbing jerked the man away as the shield struck the red tendrils. Steve hit the symbiote with a repulsor blast when an alert triggered as he saw Tony falling from the sky the lights on his suit cut out. He launched himself upward, "Extra power Jarvis," he said through gritted teeth.
Bruce pushed his glasses up on his face, a sign of nervousness. Eyes surveying the cellscape before them. He saw it first well before anyone, not AI, he assumed Jarvis was omitting that information on purpose. The AI was carefully considerate of his maker's feelings. Still, Bruce couldn't help himself, "Jarvis how long before the cell structures break down,"
"How much longer 'til I can hold you again, Sweetheart," allowing the remembered feel of the smaller frame wrapped in his arms to consume him.
"And I would never see you as anything but my captain. So go throw on your suit and learn how to run with the big boys," the blonde winked at him.
The redhead nodded. Once it was just his friends he gripped Peter in a crushing hug, "Save him if you can, but don't blame yourself if you can't," he knew the younger man too well.
"Who wants a beer," Clint called from the fridge, "Or I suppose anything else to drink," he offered as Tony set down with his own plate throwing a rather large helping onto it.
"Tony please just come with me," Bruce grabbed his shoulders in a grounding grip.
Reclaiming the hands that had been pulled away she said fiercly, "Steve Rogers is that kid from Brooklyn who never knew how to back down from a fight,"
Black Widow leaned against the bathroom doorframe, "Need any help," she offered neutrally. Even from where she stood she could see the gauze had soaked through dark blood almost black.
"Anyone you didn't tell," Tony snarled.
Iron Man flew passed them, "Jay, initiate Master Control Protocol and keep Cap put even if he finds out okay,"
Taking out his phone he called the only person he knew could get in touch with Stark, "Peter can you call Iron Man and tell him his husband is at my apartment and that he is very unwell," his voice didn't shake it held the same neutral tone but the man on the other end had been his friend for over ten years.
And finally—
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Tony hissed and plucked her hand from his arm by the sleeve. She looked surprised and leaned back a little.
Steve let out a frustrated little noise.  “Fine.”  It sounded curt and vexed.
That did it.
“Yeah.”
Steve pulled him gently to his feet and wrapped him in a huge fluffy towel.
Three days had passed since Bob’s latest appearance and prompt disappearance.  Bruce was off doing something like eating or sleeping or “decompressing.”  (He apparently didn’t do lab marathons anymore because they made the Other Guy cranky.)  So Tony was down in his private lab for a bit, spending time with Dummy and crew.  (Pepper called it “nesting,” but sometimes Pepper was full of shit. Starks don’t
Tony closed the door behind him.

I hope you liked this!  It may become a series someday, but for now it's porn and angst just for fun.
“Oh God, Steve, you’re killing me. I have a fleet of awesome cars! Usually, I’d send a driver, but obviously, they all have the week off, so I’ll drive you over myself. Parking’s always a mess and I doubt your destination has valet.”
Rogers growled and Dom laughed.
(Finally.)
“Uh,” Tony cut in feeling a little guilty, “I mean, if you actually get to the door first, then that’s fine.  And some subs are still cool with all of it, even in 2012-- they think it’s romantic or chivalrous or something, even if tons of us think it’s orentiationalist crap, so, uh, yeah.  That could have been confusing.”
In the comfort of his own luxurious bathroom, the water was hot and wonderful, but the wait gave Tony time to get nervous. His first impulse was to call Pepper. Which was ridiculous because there was nothing to be nervous about. (And it was two in the morning.) And what would he say? ‘Making new friends is scary’? What is he, a kindergartener? Tony rolled his eyes. He gave one last vigorous scrub and reached for his towel.
Steve shook Rhodey’s hand, heart feeling full again. (Thank you, thank you so much. I love him, I love him, I love him. . . )
As Steve started briskly back to Stark Tower humming “Joy to the World,” but little by little his pace slowed and he fell silent.  It was a beautiful night, clear and bright, the city glistening with Christmas lights far whiter than those he remembered.  It wasn’t a very long walk, but his feet dragged.
Steve stared for a moment, then felt like he’d been slapped.
“Uh, yeah, sure.  Just set it over there.” Tony waved.  He watched as Captain America delivered his lunch, a heaping plate of Bolognese, and wasn’t it just a sight to behold?
I felt my life begin
As he ran a thumb across Tony’s cheekbone, he felt very present. It was strange, strange to kiss Tony Stark with tenderness and have it returned. (Not like last time, not like--)
Tony looked away.
“When I met him, he was my mark.  It was . . . different.  When Fury sent me to assess him for the Initiative, I wasn’t supposed intervene unless there was a clear and present danger.  So I watched.  And later . . .”. She paused and glanced away in one of the most explicit shows of regret Clint had seen from her.  “Later it had become habit.”
“Uh, yeah,” Clint said at last. “Sure. I was only kidding.”
Steve squirmed.  “Well, uh, a while ago, I found some, um, videos.”  Steve blushed.  “Some of them were, uh,
“Good boy.”  Tony pressed a kiss to Steve’s neck.  “Don’t move.”  And then the warmth of Tony’s body withdrew and Steve could hear him walking away, crossing to the other side of the workshop.
“Yeah,” Tony agreed, tilting his head to ask for a kiss. Cap gave him a quick peck on the cheek and walked away.
, and his tech’s his power, so. . .
They hopped off the bike-- Tony so gracefully.  Steve felt heavy and awkward in comparison, his body thrumming with anticipation.  Tony grasped Steve’s left wrist in one hand, holding it hard with a not-quite painful pressure, as he guided Steve to the elevator.
“Yeah. Of course.”
Resigned to his fate, Tony rolled out of bed with a luxurious stretch. (Perhaps he could still lure Steve back to bed?) Tony pulled on lounge pants and a sweatshirt and padded down the hall.
On the other side of the launch pad, Mrs. Rhodes was giving Rhodey a hug and touching his cheek. Tony couldn’t hear over the wind, but didn’t need to hear to know that she was saying: “You look after Tony out there, you hear?”
“Is Steve in the kitchen?”
Fury rose to his feet.  “Stark has a poor track record, Captain.  This could be a PR disaster.”  Rogers tried to cut in, but Fury silenced him with a sharp hand gesture, “but, you make some good points.  Here it is, Stark,” Fury turned to look down at him, “You’re on the team as soon as you sign that contract and the Avengers move in.  If you stick to the contract for six months,
He took a deep breath. Time for the leap of faith.
And Tony knew why Natasha wasn’t trying to visit—her spider senses recognized that he was in his lair for a reason and didn’t want visitors—but Steve . . . In three days Steve hadn’t asked after him? Or wanted to watch
Steve shook his head in wonder. “You let me
The Dom took a step closer, still blocking the exit, and Tony’s heart slammed into his chest.
“Later, Pep.”
“JARVIS?  Workshop.”
“Pep!  Is that any way to greet me?”
Steve was bad at waiting.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“My mama would have rapped my hand with the rolling pin if I’d tried something like that.”
Tony shook his head, halfway to amused at himself; he was acting like the submissive damsel in one of mom’s romance novels (which he had definitely never read), beset by insecurities as soon as she went to bed with the adoring Duke or Viscount or whatever.
Steve shook his head slowly.
Tony turned to look at him, eyebrows raised, expression surprised and curious, but nervous too.  (This
Steve paid in cash again. Tony didn’t bother sneaking a look at the bill and the tip like he usually did. Tony judged a Dom on whether they’d stiffed the server—always a bad sign—but was unconcerned about Steve.
Steve’s eyes were unfocused, fuzzy on the middle distance. (Pained or pensive?) Tony felt a pang of worry. (Was he--)
Steve’s first lover.)
(Fuck.  Fuck fuck fuck.)
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, STEVE!!!
Steve was curled up on his side, blankets piled high around his body, his back to the door.  All Tony could see was a lumpy blanket shape and the top of his head, vague and indistinct in the darkness.
? Is there a Christmas episode?”
Then he leaned down to kiss Tony softly--first on the forehead, then his right cheek then his left.
“Tony. . .” Pepper used her warning voice.
“Fine,” he huffed.  Tony rolled his shoulders and tried to shake it off.
“Hey, JARVIS? Tell them they’d better save me some bacon.”
“Of course, Dr. Banner,” JARVIS said, voice expressionless.
“They got your call in time,” Pepper said. “Spiders damaged the first and second floors, but that was after Jerry got everyone into the bunker, but--” Pepper’s eyes filled with tears, but her voice was steady. “He went back out.”
Farhad took his leave.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Call me Chris,” the guy urged following Tony as he started to walk away.
“But, he’s probably busy,” Bruce added a moment later.  “Especially if there's a power struggle with Fury like you said.”
“Tony,” Pepper sounded disappointed and exasperated.  “It doesn’t matter.”
•	NSS-345 Semi-Automatic Tranquilizer Rifle
Not that all the subs at Safehouse were more broadly disadvantaged and needed career training. Isaac had told him once about a beautiful sub in her forties, a top-notch accountant. She showed up in a crisp business suit carrying a briefcase and offering to volunteer her services for the Foundation, then asking softly if she could stay the night. She was afraid to go home.
So things were good. (Right? Right.)
Steve felt flushed all over and his throbbing cock was leaking a steady stream of pre-cum.
“Certainly, Captain Rogers.”
And it was sort of sweet—though ridiculous—that Steve was nervous. Tony’d been worried that Steve had thought—what? He wasn’t even sure what he’d worried about exactly. (That he’d think I’m a slutty dancer? That I’m an irresponsible drunk? That the scarring’s ugly? That arc reactor makes me a freak?) Okay, so he did know what he’d worried about.
“Okay, let’s head there instead.”
Ta-da!  Extra long chapter is extra long (and moderately speedy)!!!  I hope you like it.  Do please cheer me on / let me know your favorite bits if you have time and inclination.  :-)
“You shouldn't have to change,” she said, voice tinged with helpless frustration. “We weren’t doing anything wrong.”
.”  Rhodey didn’t rise to the bait.
“Fine,” Tony said, then took a wild guess and added, “Seriously, you know shit in the press doesn’t get to me. You and Cap take it worse than I do.”
It was nice to have these little connections to everyday people, people who weren’t agents or superspies or super-geniuses. Sometimes, it still made Steve feel a little melancholy—all these people and their families—but on days like today it reminded him that people in the twenty-first century weren’t so different and he was honored to serve them.
Tony’s jaw dropped. “Jesus, Katie! What are you doing here?” He shook his head. “Why didn’t you say anything? PR can wait. Or Michael can handle it. Go home—be with your family.”
“Steve, that’s . . . well, it’s incredibly sweet.  But I’ve never done this before and--”  Tony took another deep breath, held it for a moment, then exhaled slowly.  “The other night, I was really worried about you, Steve,” Tony said softly.  “When you started crying like that, I thought I’d fucked everything up and really hurt you.”
As they walked across the garage, Steve knocked his shoulder against Tony’s with a little smile. His right hand found Tony’s left and, hand in hand, they stepped into the elevator.
Steve sat, tightly coiled, for a long tense moment then seemed to melt forward. He took Tony’s face in both his hands and tipped their foreheads together.
Tony sighed. “Sorry, J.” He shook his head. “Fucking screens. Okay, yeah. I’ll come right back to this after the gala. But now I’d better dash.”
“Ah!”
“Bruce.”
”.  That was a crappy phase.)
Tony felt a rush of disappointment. (“—but I’m a sub?”)
“Go ahead and move, baby,” Tony said, his voice rough and gravelly, deep and sexy.  “Fuck yourself on my fingers.”
Rhodey’s brows were furrowed, expression pinched—part worry, part anger—as he asked, “He didn’t . . . try and pull anything, did he?”
Tony smiled. (Good man, JARVIS.) Steve was still sleeping on Tony’s work couch, lips slightly parted. He’d been even more exhausted than Tony’d realized. (And, really, the super soldier serum must be the only reason that Steve hadn’t had the most massively hideous dark circles under his eyes. Terribly unfair really.) Steve’s chest rose and fell deeply in a steady rhythm. (He looks so young.) A few more files had fallen from the couch as Steve shifted in his sleep.
Very slowly, Steve leaned down until his lips almost touched Tony’s throat; he took a deep shuddering breath of Tony’s scent.
Sharp pleasure hit him in waves and he watched helplessly as Steve swallowed thick pulses of come, his Dominant’s notch bobbing.  (Fuck, fuck, fuck . . .)
” Tony gave a mock shudder. “Anyway, I’ve been reaping the rewards ever since: Amir’s food in New York and a very tidy return on the original investment every year.”
“Yeah,” Steve said, looking bashful. He glanced over at Tony with that shy smile and added, “I’m a little surprised myself.”
Steve stepped inside quietly, easing the door shut behind him.
(Fuck it!)
It raised Clint’s hackles.
“Should I come back later?”
“It was war,” Tony said, feeling totally off kilter.
“Ladies and gentlemen--submissives, switches and Dominants,” the maestro announced, “happy Valentine’s day to one and all.  Please join us for the first dance.”
; there was nothing but stubborn silence. Steve waited a few moments more than he should, then closed the door.
to me!” Bruce frowned at him. “You could have waited.”
“That’s me,” Steve said, gesturing to the photo. “I keep it to remember where I came from. Who I really am, you know? Well,” he shook his head, “you can see, I wasn’t exactly the sort of Dominant people were looking for back then. Or now either, I guess.”
Steve shuddered and held Tony tight, his cock and cum still deep in Tony’s body. Tony pulled a hand free and stroked Steve’s hair, his back in soothing caresses as Steve took long deep breaths with face pressed against Tony’s throat where he’d marked him.
“I’m ready, I’m good,” Tony begged, “just . . . just fuck me, Steve, don’t—don’t make me wait. Please,
“Wow,” Steve said.  “You look gorgeous.”
sound suggestive or downright post-coital? Tony glared at the notepad and geared up for a final attempt:
He hesitated. “Yes. Probably. Now that I’ve worked out all those hypos, hopefully I’ve predicted every data category that would be relevant, in which case the mini-orbiters collect new data and slot it into the hypotheticals to predict the necessary customized patch. I’d make the patch on the spot and add it to one of the closure devices I already made. Bam—closed portal.”
Clint leapt up and clapped Steve on the back.   “You know, the traditional ‘hurt Steve and they’ll never find your body’ speech.”

“I’m not a billionaire for nothing.”
He looked up startled.
stay to hear any more. Bad enough he'd eavesdropped on Ms Potts, but he wouldn't do that to Bruce, his friend and his teammate.
Rogers stared at him blankly, still holding the door.  A few agents paused, looking at them curiously.
“Were—” Steve began, stroking him. “Were these ok?”
Steve took a sharp breath.
Tony glared at the glowing schematics, still running his fingers over the smooth surface of Dummy’s head.  He was itching to make something with his hands, but the new Bite needed more planning and its circuits would be too delicate after a few, er,
(Great.  Can’t get a sentence out—that’s how awesome you made me at communicating.)
“One, two, three,” Steve mumbled, frowning down at his feet, his brow furrowed in concentration.
Directly below the portal, fully encircled by Avengers and SHIELD agents with pointed guns, was

Tony pressed another kiss to Steve’s thigh, then his knee.  “Come on, babe.  You need to breathe for me.  No holding your breath.”  Tony reached up to lay a hand on Steve’s chest.  “Breathe with me,” Tony said then took a long deep breath.  Steve opened his eyes and matched Tony’s breathing.  They exhaled together.  Then took another deep breath together.  Steve watched the rise and fall of Tony’s chest, the movement of the arc reactor.
And it was good, really. Bruce wasn’t the sort to hold a grudge. (Probably.) And, despite popular opinion, Tony didn’t
Under the hot-plate was a note:
“It's been a week. You haven't been sleeping,” Steve continued. “You've got nearly, Jesus I dunno, a hundred? A hundred screens up all at once! This isn't normal; it isn't working. Please? Get some rest and then come back to it. It'll help.”
“On second thought,” Tony cried, throwing his cards down. “I’ll take pity on all of you. My luck was about to turn, but, uh. I
Mrs. Rhodes clucked her tongue at him. “Nonsense. Don’t suppose me some vain old woman. Leave that smile-at-the-cameras charm for people who don’t actually know you. Now give me a proper hug.”
(Oh fuck.)
Tony wanted to look away, but knew it would worry Steve, so he held his gaze and shook his head decisively.
“Some of them were just soldiers, you know?” Steve’s voice went quiet. “They were just boys, and I wondered sometimes, was he drafted or did he volunteer?” The words came pouring out faster and faster. “Does he love Hitler or just his country or is he simply afraid? Did his mother, sister, little brother pray every night for him to come home safe? Hans or Fritz or Kurt or whatever his name was I’d left bleeding in the mud.” Steve’s hands were clenched together, twisting in his lap. Tony’s throat felt tight as Steve kept rambling:
Steve kissed first his left hand and then his right. He stood there, smiling down at Tony. Tony stood there blinking stupidly up and trying to catch his breath.
“Easy there, babe,” Tony said, tone amused.  (Oops.  Pulled a little too hard…)  Steve eased his grip, but continued stroking Tony’s back urgently and then (feeling bold) slid a hand down to the curve of his ass.  Steve could feel Tony’s cock against his hip-- he was hard again.  Steve moaned into Tony’s mouth and kissed him rough and frantic until he had to break away for air.  (
(Fuck.)
“Wait! Cap made breakfast and I missed it?”  Clint said.  “Well shit.  Hey, if you dating Stark means pancakes, I’m all in favor.”
Tyrone Macmillan smiled at his wife. “Of course, my dear.” He turned to Pepper and Tony. “Won’t you excuse me?”
“Yeah,” Tony said, fidgeting with the suit stretched out on the table. “Anyway, I’ve upgraded his body armor and he’s coming down for a fitting so—oh, right! Head’s up, I’ve invented a new poly-aramid. Leo’s got the specs. We should see about getting this on the market. Way better than Kevlar. I’ll send you some!”
“I was so numb,” Steve whispered, surprised to hear the words coming from his own lips. He had meant to stay silent, but somehow--
In the privacy of the stairwell, he pressed his forehead to the wall.
“Exactly.” Tony frowned for a second then added, “And, of course, we’re expecting a certain amount of blowback, so anything you can do . . .”
“Fine. I guess you’re off the hook for now, but it’s about the Lang Inc. merger.”
Tony swallowed.
The team split up to do their duty and mingle—after all, that was why they were there. Not just PR for the Avengers, but to help boost fundraising for The American Association for Homeless Outreach.
“Tony?” Pepper’s voice was a ravaged, rasping noise.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Tony gave a tight little nod and left, closing the door firmly behind him.
Help me get my feet back on the ground
“Yeah. Thanks, Tony.” He could hear the clutter clatter of drawers opening. “I’ll pack my bag and come out in the corporate helicopter. And, Tony? Thank you. Really. For being so supportive; I know you don’t want kids.”
It was hard to swallow. His throat was agonizingly dry.
“Fine!” Steve gasped. (Absolutely
“Oh wow!  Has it really been that long?”
(“What were you thinking?  Can you imagine how Howard would feel?  Or your mother?  I’m just glad they didn’t live to see this.”)
“You’re beautiful like that,” Tony said roughly.  “Perfect.  Fuck!”
Tony blinked, confused—struggling to gather his thoughts.
Clint nodded. “Yeah. Maybe Wednesday? He’s been busy with something.” He shrugged again, but was frowning a little now too.
The journalists couldn’t possibly capture that. Their articles were flat; it was like reading about a friend and a stranger at the same time.
Tony pushed and pulled Steve’s head up and down on his cock.  (Amazing.  Beautiful.)  Steve’s body rocked gently as Tony moved.  Tony dragged his eyes from Steve’s mouth around him and looked lower.   The sight was nearly enough to send him off then and there—Steve had a fist curled around his dick, pulling and stroking as Tony moved his head.
on a roll with this body armor.  (Youtube break notwithstanding.)
Tony didn’t tell Steve that these drawings of his—‘nothing special’—were on display in the Smithsonian.
It was glorious.
Rhodey’s muscles were still bunched tight, his expression intense and searching. He leaned a little closer.
“I own a couple of ranches and shit,” Tony said. “We could go to my home where the buffalo roam and the deer and the antelope play.”
Tony led Steve to his battered leather couch, stretched out across it and pulled Steve down into his arms.  As he stroked Steve’s back, Tony thought he felt a little tremor run through him.
Steve was smiling. He laid a hand very gently on Tony’s arm and added, “It was the best gift you could ever give me, and you don’t even want credit, do you?”
“I won’t be,” Tony said curtly. “Ever.”
Tony didn’t want to think about the Captain.
“I am?”
Besides, he should have tried this sooner. He’d promised Rhodey he’d look after Cap and he hadn’t exactly been living up to his word.
Rogers stood, but didn’t move. His brow was creased, a slight frown at the corners of his mouth. “I’m not sure I--”
“He seems fine, but really who knows?” Rhodey gave a little snort and rubbed the back of his neck. “He’d get hurt, then insist the serum had it covered and get back up. Pretty sure he had broken bones at a couple points, and there are big gashes in the uniform, but he never got or seemed to need stitches. Don’t think he’s seen any doctor either, except maybe Dr. Banner.”
“Help?” Tony asked, puzzled.
(No, that would slow his decent all right, but make him more of a target easier to hit. It-- it.
Steve’s breath hitched and his heart stuttered at the words.  He nodded, looking up at Tony and trying to beg with his eyes.  He opened his mouth wide.  “Yeah, fuck!” Tony swore and guided Steve onto his cock.  (Oh god, hot and heavy on his tongue . . . so full . . . )  Steve sucked eagerly.  Tony began to move Steve’s head and thrust shallowly into his mouth.  Steve relaxed into it, letting Tony move him as he pleased.  Steve slid Tony’s trousers down his hips to fondle Tony’s balls.  (Remember, firm.  But not too firm.)  When Tony thrust into his mouth, it made a wet noise, filthy and sloppy, that made Steve’s cock jerk.
INFINITE GRATITUDE to thatwhichyeilds who made the photomanips for this chapter.  Aren’t they lovely, folks?
“Deepest sympathies, sir.”
"To be blunt," Philips said, "We're low on funds.  Low on soldiers.  Low on allies."
“Sir? Agent Barton asks that I remind you of your training appointment. It is nearly four.”
“Sir?  It is now six pm.  You asked to be awakened.”
Rope around his wrists—Steve’s rope—holding him there, tied in place.
“Yeah,” Tony said.  His heart was pounding and he wanted to get out of there.  He stared at Rogers a moment, then shook himself a little.
“Is it?”  Tony blinked and withdrew his hand.   (Huh.)  He leaned against the conference table and raised one eyebrow.
“Be there soon,” Tony said, casting about for a plan. He flew over a rock and cut the power, crashing down to break the spider’s exoskeleton against it. The thing released him as it split open like a crab, but Tony’s suit couldn’t dampen the force of the fall and still kill the spider. Tony’s head slammed against the helmet and his whole body exploded with pain.
“Nothing that unexpected.” Pepper snorted. “Did you know I’m not getting any younger? And, I’ll never find a man and have kids unless I accept that men want a sweet subby girl in public even if they’re Switches.”
Steve huffed.  “Well, I hope that’s not entirely true,” Steve said.  (Huh?)  “I, uh, hope you’d say no to someone else.”
“Hey, JARVIS? I’m gonna need Tiffany’s and Bergdorff Goodman’s. And Christie’s. And Sotheby’s! This is gonna take a while.”
Steve fumbled a little with his belt, bending his eyes to the carpet again, just listening to Tony breathe.  He undid his trousers, let them fall to the floor, and then kicked them aside.  His erection, which had flagged earlier in the face of his embarrassment, now jutted proudly from his body again.  Steve shoved his boxers down his legs and added them to his messy pile of clothes.  Unsure what to do now, Steve kept his head bowed, but the rest of his body eased into parade rest of its own accord.  At least it gave him something to do with his hands, but putting them behind his back seemed to draw more attention to his cock.  Then again, from the sound of Tony’s labored breathing, that was hardly a bad thing.
(Hm… M⋅L
come for you.”
“You an’ me?” Tony asked. Clint actually looked worried.   “Yeah, birdbrain. We’re cool.”
Please note that this chapter contains only this Steve’s own, personal responses to various kinks.  I by no means shall all of his feelings, nor do I wish to kink shame anyone.  Thanks!  Enjoy!
“Pff.” Tony waved it away. “He’s a scientist. Doesn’t count.”
Tony froze, dropping the screwdriver; it rolled under the arc diffusor.
they’d gone to bed together.)
(It’s cool you lied to the press. You’re pretty fucking shrewd. Sorry I thought you might be a moron. But you’re not! Yay! Anyway, thanks for lying to make me look better. You’re all right.)
Steve nodded.
) Tony’s heart clenched, not with a sharp pain, but more of a bitter melancholy.
Slowly, Tony eased his fingers out of Steve’s hole and looked up at him.  Steve’s body had gone lax, as though he were melting down into the bed.  His lips were parted and his wide eyes were staring at the ceiling—he looked a little dazed.  He was probably still under.
Tony didn’t actually know all that much about Moroccan cuisine or Steve’s taste so he just ordered most of the menu and, when Steve tried to protest, pointed out that the whole team would enjoy the copious left-overs and, no, of course he wouldn’t let any food go to waste.  (Besides, Steve could probably eat half of what Tony ordered himself considering his super-metabolism.)

Rogers shrugged. “I wanted pancakes; don’t mind making extra.”
They stood in the stairwell for long moments and Natasha just waited. (She’d eased into the corner a little—it had the clearest sightlines.)
Natasha radiated lazy contentment like a housecat, glancing over to observe her teammates from time to time.
“It’s traditional,” Tony said with a shrug.  The rings through his nipples shook with the movement and sent the web of delicate chains tinkling under the translucent silks that draped his torso.
like I belonged there, in the fancy suit you bought me, but I know if it weren’t for the serum--how I look now and the whole Captain America thing-- I’d never have had the guts to ask you out. Hell, you’re so outta my league we’d have never met, let alone gotten together. But it’s ok.”
Tony shrugged and approached Bruce’s desk. It was littered with crumpled stationary. The wastepaper basket was full, and one balled up paper had fallen on the floor. Tony picked it up to shove back in the basket, but first--
didn’t notice at all.  Look, I can cover my tracks, but it takes time.  Energy.  Attention away from other things.  And whatever you think--” she glanced significantly at Steve, “Tony Stark can take care of himself.”
Tony’s motions slowed, then stopped.  He pushed Steve gently, encouraging him to flop back into the pillows, then shifted on top of him.  As they exchanged languorous kisses, Tony rocked against Steve’s hip with slow, lazy motions, his cock sliding easily, slick and messy. Steve gasped and moaned.   His come.  Tony’s cock was coved with his come, and the thought was so filthy-hot that Steve was amazed he didn’t get hard again on the spot.  Steve wished he knew what to do, but Tony seemed happy to just kiss Steve and thrust up against his hip, pace easy and unhurried.  Steve ran his fingers through Tony’s hair and kissed him back, long and deep and slow.
“Almost done,” Steve said with a shrug.
“No,” Tony said haltingly, “But if I started now—“
“Shhhh, baby. There’s no hurry,” Tony murmured with a soothing little caress down his side.  Steve blinked and bit his lip.  Steve hadn’t realized he was saying anything aloud until Tony answered.   “Shhhh . . . You are mine.”
Rogers thought—)  Tony took a long deep breath.  (No.
As Steve finished the tie on Tony’s left wrist, he asked softly, “How’s that?”
“You are.” Tony smiled, one of his real smiles.   “I’m a genius, but sometimes I can be slow on the uptake. About people. You . . .you really are a good guy.”
(So fucking beautiful.)
needed to destroy a punching bag. The door opened and closed again with a click.
“Yeah. And pumpkin curry, medium. Tom Kha Gai. And spring rolls. Double spring rolls, JARVIS! And mango with sticky rice. Thanks, J!”
“Knock yourself out.”
sort of thing distract him.)  Steve blushed.  Had Tony liked his drawing?  (The cross-hatching on his thighs had still looked weird, but maybe Tony hadn’t noticed?)  Would it inspire Tony?  Would he tie Steve up next time?  He closed his eyes to imagine it: kneeling on the floor with his hands tied behind his back, thick chords knotted around his wrists, a firm, constant pressure, like Tony’s holding him in place even while he’s touching Steve’s face, caressing his neck and shoulders, reaching down to tease his cock and--
“What?”
“It was years later, talking to Father Gabe, I finally wondered if all those times as kids Buck had talked about the two of us opening a shop, going to California, just him and me ‘til the end of the line, if—“ Steve swallowed and his hands went tight on the railing for a moment. “--if maybe he’d been picturing it different from me.”
Training in the snowy Wyoming fields of Tony’s ranch rapidly became a high powered, high tech snowball fight. One that was started (much to his surprise) by Natasha and soon picked up (to his even greater surprise), not by Clint, but by Bruce. Tony hesitated for a minute—(Steve hates the cold)—but when Bruce lobbed a snowball at Iron Man with a grin he concluded resistance was futile. (Really, anything to put Bruce more at ease.) Apparently Steve decided the same thing and Clint soon followed suit.
Tony shrugged. “No worries. We can watch that one again if you like.”
“Eewooooo,” the creature said.
, then you have to relax a little for me, sweetheart,” Tony said.  “You’re too tense.”
“Hello, sir. It is eleven-fifty two p.m. in New York,” JARVIS informed him, tone soft and reassuring.
“Henry.”
. Ha.)
“So you’re not happy to see me?” Tony said with a pout. “I’m hurt.”
Katie gave an elegant shrug. “I doubt it. He’d clearly thought about what he wanted to say, but he didn’t talk to me first.” She gave him a rueful look. “Or to SHIELD—and I’ve gotten a real earful about that, thank you very much.”
The Captain shook his head. “Only a nasty piece of work like you would treat showing respect for my sub like its something shameful. Tony likes to fight his own battles; I admire that.”
Pepper poured them each a mug of strong aromatic coffee. They sipped it quietly for a few moments.
Steve frowned, mulling over their recent conversation.  Safeword, huh?  The whole concept seemed a little odd.  If he wanted to be untied, wouldn’t he just ask? And if Tony wanted him tied up, wouldn’t he want to stay tied up too?  Wouldn’t it be obvious if he was upset?  It was hard to picture being upset with Tony there to take care of him.  Tony wouldn’t do anything he knew would distress Steve. (Ugh.  Some of the things on that chart.  Just ugh.)
“I’ve got you, darling,” Steve promised, pulling Tony’s hands down around his shoulders.  He kissed Tony tenderly.  “I’ve got you.”
Tony laughed.
Spider-Man was up shooting webbing to catch it before it fell into the street. The blue armored suit was beside him helping him to lower it slowly to the ground. Tony was firing repulsor blast at Green Goblin. Hawkeye swung him and Natasha into a glass window before they both rolled.
Straightening himself he put on a smile as his husband entered the room, "Hey Beautiful," he stood forcing himself to take steady steps toward the older man. Smoothing his hands down the sides of the soft dress shirt, resting them on his hips. Nuzzling into the neck before he pressed a kiss just behind the man's ear.
Carnage smashed into the window only to have a high frequency arrow shot into the ground before him. The symbiote screamed and a second arrow was fired causing it to jump from the window.
"I don't know, Tony. I'm pretty tired actually, not really feeling up to dinner," he answered sullenly.
Matt leapt down following her to the street level while Clint covered them. A loud clang as Tony was knocked from the air right into Hulk a brick wall collapsing on them as they impacted. Four aliens emerged from one of the ships. They were much larger and very heavily armored. Spider-man threw a line of webbing to haul the one nearest to Iron Man away only to have himself pulled into a bone crunching blow.
Dr. Yi gave the mutant an appreciative glance, "Dr. McCoy believes your blood was a part of the original super soldier serum,"
"Is he eating something healthy," he asked hopefully.
Chewing his cheek for a second he debated whether or not that was actually true. If he pushed it and Steve actually was tired it would take a toll on the former super soldier. Gambling that this had more to do with his current mood than his health Tony pressed, "It's better if we got this sorted out now, rather than later when the team needs you,"
"Hell I've known that kid too damn long to let him die like this," he dismissed.
"Ugh no Dr. Yi," a voice cut in as Tony stepped into to room looking properly sex mussed, "You could do so much better. Their leader now, that man is cut from the same sexy boy scout cloth as our own dear Cap," he smiled.
Tony took his hand kissing the red band softly, "A little over a day is nothing, Babe. I'll take you on a weeklong getaway after," smiling as he pulled him in for a kiss, "We'll take turns all keeping you company,"
"Apologies, Captain but Mr. Stark is approaching," Jarvis warned.
"Hit it Bird Brain," he jumped from the plane just to get knocked off course by a glider smashing him into the side of a building the jet was rocked with an explosion one of the engines burned out.
"Seems your secret is out, Babe," Tony said sadly, "You gave the Man Without Fear quite the scare when you passed out on him. Also, it seems I'm going to have to put a microchip on you, bad puppy wandering from our yard," he teased swallowing down his tears.
