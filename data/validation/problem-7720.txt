Steve remembered the ‘dance’, smiling. “She could flirt and she wasn’t always so blunt.”
Tony wrapped his arms around Rogers and looked up into his eyes. “You sure about this?”
“Good well, I have a board meeting in four days, so, I’m just going to head back to the lab. Thanks for the bacon, Cap,” Tony takes the bacon out the pan and starts shoving it unceremoniously on a plate before moving to run down to the lab.
“What if I mess things up, Bucky, you don’t know what it was like before; there was hardly a day where we weren’t at each other’s throat over something. It was awful. We barely spoke, unless we were fighting. I don’t want to, you know, creep him out. What if he doesn’t like men?” Steve looks at Bucky, panic visible in his eyes. Bucky softens, he knows that Steve is really freaking out, and no matter how much it hurts him, he won’t let his feelings get in the way.
“Mr Parker is in the elevator, sir,” JARVIS says breaking the tension, there’s a collective breath from all three men in the room. “He appears to be in good health, though he is sleep deprived. He is also exhibiting signs of extreme stress and anxiety.”
Time passes as he sits there watching Peter sleep, at one point he’d started to burrow further into Steve. Then he’d just sighed and stopped moving, Steve is seized with so much love for Peter, he never thought that he would feel this way about a child. Steve knows that he came to terms with never being able to have a family in the way everyone else had one a long time ago; now he does have one, and he loves them, all of them. He doesn't hear the door open, but he hears Tony’s soft laugh as he walks into the room. Tony’s eyes are sparkling with mirth as he takes in the sight in front of him. Carefully, he unwraps Peter’s arms from around Steve’s waist, and lays him down again; he pulls the duvet up to Peter’s chin and presses a kiss to his forehead, before catching Steve’s hand and pulling him up into an embrace.
“Bruce thinks he’s going to make it,” Tony is talking partly to Peter, and partly to Steve, whose mouth is set in a grim line. “We stabilised him enough, Thor zipped them back to HQ before I sent him on his little investigation. He’s breathing, and he was conscious when they were sent off, but I’m not sure if they’ll put him into a coma to recover properly.” Tony is pretty sure that he can pinpoint the second Steve’s heartbreaks. He recovers pretty quickly though, pulling himself together; but it is very much Captain America in charge because Tony knows that Steve Rogers is dying inside. Peter doesn’t zip his emotions up as well as Steve, he lets out a cry crumpling to the floor.
“We can tell them the truth, and then we’re going to go and get Bucky and Peter back,” Natasha has that glint in her eye, which means that Clint won’t be getting a quiet night in with Kate and his dog.
“That’s exactly what they did, that’s why it's spasming too; you learn fast, Barnes,” Tony smiles as he sticks a screwdriver behind his ear, “whatever kind of gun they hit you with fried pretty much all the circuitry inside this thing, did a number on the plating as well. You’re lucky I’m so good at what I do that the rest of the thing held up, lesser engineering on it and it would have completely broken.” Tony muttered as he examined the arm.
“You’ve spent so long denying yourself the things you want because you think people will hate you for it,” Steve looks at him, his face is open and loving; Tony can’t help the thrill of excitement that shoots through him as he sees the way Steve is looking at him. “If you don’t want to try the, what was it? The V formation thing, then why don’t you just tell us what it is that you want if it’s nothing but what you and I have now then okay. If it’s more than that then, Tony, we’re both here; neither of us are running away or leaving you any time soon. No matter what you decide, but you do need to tell us what you want.”
“The Show Must Go On, I made you listen to it a month or so ago, it’s by Queen.” Tony says looking too shocked to say anything else, “damn super soldier hearing.” He mutters, but he looks more abashed than anything else, a faint splotch of pink dusts his cheeks.
“Hey, do you think you could call me James?” He asks, softly, once he’s out of Steve’s room, “Mr Barnes was my da’s name.”
“Nah, you always ate more’n me,” he flicks Bucky’s arm, not hard but hard enough for the metal to make a tinging sound. “I remember one time you ate a whole loaf of bread in one sitting, your ma was so cross that you’d not saved any for your sisters that she shooed you outta the house with a broom. You had’a hide out a mine for three days, but when you got there, you pulled a slice of bread out your pockets ’n handed it to me. You knew that ma had been too sick to work and we’d no food in the house.”
from my family to yours, have a very merry christmas, and if you don’t celebrate christmas have a very good day.
All in all, Steve really should have seen the big lizard coming; turns out there had been a nest of them under Bowery for ages. The babies, they’d dealt with, now the mom is pissed. And Steve just happens to be in the path of her destruction. He looks up as she crouches on to her six limbs, black eyes glinting into the sun, her teeth are covered in venom and spittle; her forked tongue lolls to one side. She’s nearly the size of a building, and she’s looking right at him; Steve knows that he should call for backup, maybe for Doctor Strange to conjure a portal into space. He doesn't though, he squares up to the giant lizard, turning on the ball of his foot to face her. His heart is hammering in his chest; his body is flooding with adrenaline as she starts running towards him. Her tail swings through the street, throwing cars and smashing windows. At the last second Steve jumps, he hadn’t been listening to the noise the lizard had made as she thundered down the street, he’d been listening for the familiar sound of Tony’s suit. He is pulled out of the way at the last second, watching as the lizard impales herself onto Natasha’s blade, spilling green blood all over her.
“Tony Stark,” there’s a voice and a cough from the doorway; Tony turns to see a man there, in what looks like robes and a beard that is totally copying his own. “I am Doctor Strange. It’s a pleasure to meet you.” The man walks in and holds out his hand, Tony notices the scars there and catalogues them for later.
“Good,” Ben shudders, his breath rattling in his chest. “Raise him right, Stark.” He says, and then he tenses once before he releases a puff of air, and his chest doesn't move again.
He takes one calming breath before his places his hand on Bucky’s chest, “we need to talk about this. We can’t do anything before we talk, I don’t want to ruin the friendship I have with you and the relationship I have with Steve by jumping in too quickly. I’ve jumped in too quick before, and I lost one of my best friends because of it.” Tony remembers Pepper’s face as she told him that she no longer held romantic feelings for him, their split had been as mutual as possible, but they were still not entirely on speaking terms. “I won’t do that with you two, so we need to talk.”
“Probably not, but you’re going to find out sooner or later,” Wanda says from behind Clint, she’s taking off her uniform, discarding the leather gloves and pulling her hair out of the tight ponytail. Even just by the way she’s standing she is miles apart from the scared teenager Clint took from the HYDRA facility. “You should show him now, Peter, before he gets the medical report.”
“Oh God.” Clint says, “okay I’m not going on social media for the next month. But we’re okay to come right? You’re not having a moment or anything? If I have to see you kiss one more time I swear I’ll gouge my own eyes out.”
“Coulson, Nat, I got something,” he grimaces because he knows exactly what he’s looking at, he’s seen them before. It's a mark that’s been carved into the wood, and it’s supposed to tell everyone in the business who killed the man in front of them. “You seen this one before?” He asks Natasha, because if anyone is going to know this assassin’s mark then it's going to be Tasha.
“Thank you, Doctor Chavez,” He looks at her, holding out a hand with the smile still on his face.
“It doesn't mean no forever, Pete, just that we need to talk through things a lot more before we agree to give you the treatment.” Tony smoothes back the hair from Peter’s forehead, he smiles at Steve to thank him for putting things into words, “for now I just want to make sure you’re safe and as happy as possible, we can keep talking about this and we’ll go to some therapy sessions where we can talk some more with someone who knows what they’re talking about. How does that sound?”
“Come on, Peter, let's get you back to your dad, yeah?” Clint taps Peter’s shoulder to set him going in the right direction, “keep in touch on the coms, Cap, if there’s any trouble. Tell Tony we’re coming in.”
Burger Heaven is perfect, it looks as though the design of it hasn't changed since the fifties; Tony can see how excited Steve and Bucky are to be somewhere that isn't too far removed from a time that was only a few years ago to both of them. He smiles as he takes in the yellow Formica topped tables and chrome fronted kitchen, complete with window; there’s a bar with white stools and banquettes with cobalt vinyl covers. Steve is grinning as they’re lead to a bigger booth, one meant for four; slides in first, to his surprise it’s Bucky that presses in next to him. He doesn't hate the feeling of Bucky’s thigh squashed against his, though, he likes the heat of it. There’s something about seeing the open adoration on Steve’s face that warms him from the inside out. Tony surprises himself as he considers these feelings, he was going to tell the other two that he didn't want to be part of a throuple, that he was happy to try out the V relationship. Now he realises he doesn't exactly want that.
“JARVIS, update on Bucky please,” he’s only been gone forty-five minutes, but he’s too tired to think of anything else.
“Oh, that’s the ‘not a date,’” Peter nods sagely, as though he knows everything in the whole universe. “I get it, and honestly it’s cool with me, that means three times the awesome presents right?”
“Let’s see, is it going to be like that time you asked me to come fix your DVD player that was so ancient and hopeless? Because honestly, Clint, I am not sure I can deal with that again,” Tony says shaking his head but the gesture is full of fond exasperation. “Yeah, of course, I’ll help her out, just tell her to give Pepper a call, and she’ll put something in my diary.”
“There’s gonna be a lot of sitting and talking about things, kiddo,” Tony presses a kiss into Peter’s hair, thankful that Peter didn't flinch away from him, or hate that his Dad was horrendously uncool. “Sorry, Petey, but we’re going to be having a lot of conversations over the next few months, maybe years. We also need to talk about what we’re going to do about school.”
“Can we come back now?” Clint pops his round the door, “also why are my twitter notifications off? Do you have something to do with this, Stark?”
“Come on, ya great lump,” Bucky groans, but the noise cuts short as Steve buries his face into Bucky’s chest. “It should be illegal; you should be illegal.” He whispers, Steve, all 6’4” of him is adorable. Bucky tramps down on his feelings quickly, the modern day might be okay with how he feels about Steve, but he hasn't quite come to terms properly with it yet; his brain files the information away for a later day. He deposits Steve gently down on his bed, not bothering with the duvet, he pulls the soft blue blanket over his friend’s sleeping body. “G’night Stevie. JARVIS, you can cut the lights.”
“Something nice, but not too nice, and a little funny too; we should revive Steve’s account, I made him one ages ago, but he never uses it.” Tony looks up at the ceiling, “JARVIS is Steve done in the shower now?”
“He has a lot of opinions, he needed to get them all out somehow, plus he’s useful; he needed an account to monitor Twitter for me, sometimes he even announces SI things,” Tony smiles a little fondly.
Welcome to Twitter, Mister Barnes @sgtjbarnesofficial<<
“We could try it,” he’s looking at Bucky, but he can see Steve relax and smile out the corner of his eye. “We could try and see what happens? Love is just science, right? So it would make sense to try it out and see if it works.”
“Tell him, Stevie, you should tell him,” Bucky’s happy for Steve, he really is, but he can’t help feeling like he’s missing out on something. He feels a small part of him shrivel up and die, the part of him that had hoped, in the new century that Steve and he would become something more than best friends.
“Bucky got hurt but not cause of you, he should have waited for back up before he went in,” Steve shakes his head, ruffling Peter’s hair, enjoying the way he pouts. “It wasn't his fault either, mind, sometimes things like this happen; with us, things like this happen more often than normal. It’s no one’s fault, not really. It took me a long time to learn that, but you’re a smart boy, Pete.”
“He is the picture of physical health, though he is confused about the situation this morning, he appears to be understanding,” JARVIS replies, his voice is somehow fond, Steve knows how much the AI has grown to care for Tony and his family.
“I, uh, I asked JARVIS about it, and he pointed me in the direction of some very informative websites, I guess.” Steve shrugs, a flush starting to dance across his cheekbones, his bright blue eyes are slightly panicked like he’s a deer caught in headlights. Tony smiles, but softer this time, they’re still standing close together; almost touching but not quite, Tony reaches out a hand and lays it on Steve’s arm.
“In an abandoned apartment complex in Anchorage,” JARVIS replies. “I have not been able to gauge on Mister Parker’s status, Sir.”
“Fuck weapons, this is much more better,” Tony stops himself, trying to make sense of the words that are coming out of his mouth. “Coffee, I need coffee.”
“I want to announce the Stark Homes Project,” his hands are shaking, “a project that is going to be rolled out nationwide in the next year. The Stark Homes are safe houses for LGBT young adults, too many of our LGBT in America are homeless due to hatred and bigotry. These kids are left alone with no one, they need a safe place to go, with employees training therapy and full access to online school programmes, the Stark Homes are going to be that safe place. Questions?”
They walk down the corridor towards Peter’s room, Tony keeps his hands over Peter’s eyes, before he stops in front of the door. He tells Peter to keep his eyes shut as he opens the door and leads Peter inside, the rest of the team following behind. Steve lets out an audible gasp, the room has changed from the boring guest room Peter had been living in before; now it is a teenage boy’s paradise. The walls had been an impersonal beige; now they’re a light blue; there’s a mural on the wall with the largest amount of blank space; the whole solar system (and more) covers it, some of the stars even twinkle with a soft yellow light. Half of one of the other walls is a chalkboard, at the moment its covered in the specs for Bucky’s arm and the Iron Man suit. The bed has been replaced with a high sleeper; there's a sofa and a desk under it, the sofa looks like its a fold out one so that Peter can have friends to stay. There’s a worktop which looks like it’s a miniature version of Tony’s lab on one corner; and standing beside it is a smaller version of Dummy, the bot who Peter had fallen in love with the first time he’d sneaked into the workshop. Natasha is looking at Tony with a smile on her face; Steve has never seen her look so soft before.
“I’ll be there in ten,” he promises quickly before hanging up, grabbing his suit jacket off the back of couch and running through the hall to the elevator. “Steve! Get in the car we have to go!”
“Ok,” they answer, and Natasha gives him a once over.
Steve was enjoying a peaceful early morning breakfast with Bucky when it happened.
“I can help with that,” Wanda offered. Her hands sparked with scarlet flames, wisps curing outward.
“Right,” Tony drawls. “Where did you even get the glue?”
“Mom, I’ve been stabbed,” Natasha immediately suggests sarcastically, and Tony doesn’t even blink.
Danvers looked at Steve. “Any questions so far?”
what you’re focused on?”
“Don’t tell mom not to use her language, it makes up fifty percent of her vocabulary,” Clint pesters cheekily. Tony opens his mouth to reprimand him, before what Clint said catches up to him.
”That’s it,” Toni said. “That’s the story. Thank you for your contribution.”
“You didn’t have to do that,” Peter mutters as they all get in the convertible.
She shrugged and took a sip of her coffee, moaning loudly at the taste. Steve couldn’t help the way his thoughts followed the sound and how he used to draw it from her.
Just as promised, they arrive at the school within ten minutes, and Tony charges into the school, Steve tramping along a little slower behind him. Nearly slipping on the tile floor from his momentum, Tony slides to a stop in front of the office doors and bursts in. “Where is he?”
“Hey, May, how can I help you?” Tony answers the phone.
“Am I living in a frat house?” Tony raises his voice, staring down Thor, Natasha, and Clint. “No, seriously, Bruce and Steve can pick up their shit, why can’t you? I am always picking up everyone’s crap around here.” The three look appropriately chagrined albeit hiding their amusement. “I am not your fucking maid. You know what? No, you’re not listening to me. Steve! Jarvis, call Steve.”
”Just wanted to figure something out about myself,” Toni said.
Toni held up her hand, perfectly painted nails crimson and gold in the pale sunlight. “Let me finish.”
‘Never forget, Angel,’ Death whispers back as she kisses Angel on the forehead. ‘I love you darling. I will always be beside you.’ With that, Angel returns to the living.
At this point, Steve began to feel a pit of dread pool in his stomach.
They were going
“Someone try to get his attention,” Clint cajoles.
“Where are you going?”
“They’re practically our parents at this point.”
On the very right was Spider-Man, visibly bouncing on his toes in excitement. He was in full uniform, much to Steve’s displeasure. How could the team trust someone in a mask? He added ‘
“Well?” Steve asks, raising an eyebrow “What happened?”
“Mr. Stark,” he says as if he can scarcely believe it. “Captain Rogers. What a- it’s a pleasure.”
Angel is an outsider in her own home, the soldier gone most of the time to search for his dragon, the spy never liked her, Hate hates her, and the spy’s friend gone back to his real family. And when the soldier comes back with a new man in tow, this one with similar capabilities as Angel, she doesn’t fight it. She still loves the soldier, always has since her childhood, but she finally accepted he wouldn’t love her back. Until he did. He would go out looking for his dragon for weeks on end, but he would come back and spend time with Angel. And she loved him for it, he gave her the attention she so desperately needed to survive. Sure, she had Flame, Calm, and her brother, but her brother was still fighting in the war and couldn’t always take be home, and Flame and Calm had just gotten married and she wanted to give them some time together. So she suffered in silence, always cherishing the short breaks she got with the soldier. Of course, it didn’t last.
Tony, still in mild shock, simply nods. “I want this all cleaned up by the time I get back.”
”Miss Maximoff,” the android greeted. Wanda’s face fell at his cold apathy projected in the two simple words and his expression. Steve made note to talk to him about it.
”Did you?” Steve inquired, desperate for some reason to keep the conversation alive.
”In a way. Kindness found her dead body, but it was so mutilated that Death couldn’t send her back. Kindness alters her the same way the Flame of Life had been altered and it fixes her. She is forced to continue on living and act like nothing happened. Unfortunately she had been pregnant at the time when the soldier and dragon attacked her, and she lost the child.” Toni shrugged, and Bucky abruptly stood up.
Steve accepts and bends his head down, maintaining eye contact with Tony when he takes a sip from the straw. Tony licks his lips, mouth suddenly dry.
Finally all the food is passed out, and Tony and Steve collapse together on the couch. Tony leans his shoulder into Steve and they bumps knees.
Toni was suddenly enveloped in the Iron Queen armour, which appeared out of nowhere. Repulsers flared to life and were aimed at Steve’s team.
Then another one of her god father’s spies comes in, but this time he’s a friend. She gifted him a long while back the title of Understanding. He tells her a new enemy had arisen. And Angel just sighs.
He was practically chomping at the bit to see Toni again and maybe they could finally make on that small cautious relationship that had blossomed between them official. Sure, he was angry the brunette had tried to kill Bucky, but Steve would forgive her with time. Toni would have to be benched until the entire team could trust her again, especially Wanda and Clint, but Steve would make sure the Iron Queen suit was passed on to someone worthy. He might even let Toni run coms.
“We have the results from the bloods, SHEILD does them on site and instantly,” it’s only been about two hours since Peter had had his blood taken, but Doctor Chavez walks in with a chart. “It’s like Peter was injected with an approximation to the serum that was used on Captain Rogers. We’re not sure the full implications of this, honestly we probably won’t know exactly how this will affect Peter until a few months at least have passed. We can guess about his healing abilities, those bruises on his face have all almost gone, and his broken ankle, which we can assume happened sometime this week has already healed. Moving on from that, his ankle will need to be re-broken if it is to heal right, that will happen under an anaesthetic so you won’t be awake for that, Peter. Though, that can wait so long as Peter is not in pain?”
“I missed mom though; she never did anything like what my dad did.” Tony says, “she would always pick me up after a bad encounter with Howard.” Tony sighs he’s still crying. “I guess seeing Peter in there reminded me of what I never had. It was horrible because he had it, with May and Ben, and now he doesn't and all he’s left with it me. A father, he never knew, with some pretty serious daddy issues himself. What kind of life can I give him?”
>>captain america and the other avengers represent doing the right thing even when it’s hard to do i am so proud of them all for sharing this with us #gayvengers #calledit #captainBImerica<<
Trigger warnings for this chapter: someone gets hurt, quite badly, there's not hugely graphic wound description but it's pretty bad.
“Gross,” Natasha shudders as she pulls the blade out of the lizard’s head, “why do I always have to be the one who-“
He taps out a tweet:
“Yeah,” Tony says, “tell everyone else to get ready and meet me in the living room; I want as much detail as you can get on the case, J. Hey Clint,” Tony waits for Clint to look at him, “suit up.”
“Yeah, I’ve just been teaching Buck, figured I could teach you both at the same time. You got anywhere else to be today?” Tony asks, one of his arms snaking around Steve’s chest, pulling him closer.
They break apart, Steve smiling at Bucky, and joining him at the table. Tony hovers a little, hesitation clear in his posture, his shoulders are set in a tense line, and his eyes are uncertain. Steve huffs, a small sound; one only Bucky picks up on, but Tony catches the movement. He smiles gratefully, as Steve gestures for the door, Tony’s out the room in a flash leaving only a faint whiff of cologne in his wake.
“Got cleared this morning,” Bucky shrugs, shooting two lizards at once, one of them without even looking. “Wanted it to be a surprise but you know, I guess these bastards had other ideas.”
“Tomorrow, at eight is perfect,” Tony says, pulling him in, for another kiss; as though any moment where their mouths are not touching is a moment of their lives wasted.
“Let me drop off Cap then I’ll be right there, Katniss.” Tony snarks as he flies right into the middle of the fighting. Sure enough, there are huge lizards running all over Bowery; they have two foot long teeth lining their faces; they also seem to spit some form of acid. “Really? On my kid’s birthday? Lizards? Fucking really?”
“How do you survive?” Clint asks, but he’s smiling a little too, “could you come to Bed-Stuy at some point? Simone’s TV is playing up, and I think some wires got twisted, but I have no idea how to fix it.”
“Tony, I need to ask,” Steve pauses, taking a breath, “what if we don’t find Peter’s family? What’s the plan here? I don’t want to upset you, I really don’t but these things have to be thought of.”
“Hi, kid,” Tony croaks out, “come on we can head through to the living room and you can tell me everything.”
“Thanks, Clint,” Steve croaks, “I’ll take him home, we all could do with some rest, I think.”
“But what? She, not your type? You into redheads and she was a blonde or something? Or did she not have a winning personality?” Tony looks at him, the soft look has been wiped off his face, it’s been replaced with a look of someone who is focused on one singular thing, and Bucky is pretty sure it’s not his arm.
Tony is in the kitchen, his hands curled around a cup of cocoa, a tablet is propped against the milk; JARVIS is playing a video or something on it. He humming softly, though sometimes he slips into singing; he’s in track pants and a stained tank top, Steve hears Bucky draw in a sharp breath, he assumes because of what just happened and how close Tony was to it. Tony’s hair is ruffled like he just got out of bed, there’s pillow marks on his face; the warm gold light that streams out from the one lamp on in the room makes his skin look so soft and warm that Steve just wants to bury himself in it. His foot is tapping some distant rhythm on the footrest of the stool, his track pants have oil and paint stains, they are also very baggy and very familiar. Steve stifles a laugh as he realises that Tony is wearing his track pants, there is nothing he wants to do more than to draw the scene in front of him, but he forces himself to cough.
Everyone has long since accepted that nothing can be a secret for very long in the tower, living with three super spies it is hardly surprising that it only takes a day and a half for everyone to know about Tony and Steve. They don’t make it a secret, though nothing really changes, apart from the casual touches holding more weight than they used to. Bucky tries to be okay with it; he really does, he’s smiling and joking around them just as much as he used to do; he also goes down to the workshop and hangs out with Peter like normal. So he’s surprised when Natasha drops into his room (literally, she’s taking a leaf out of Clint’s book and coming out of an air vent) at midnight.
They stand infant of the tree, Peter insists on taking a selfie before the actual photo, so he can post that on instagram, or whatever. Tony just uses twitter to argue with bigots, and to remind everyone what charities SI is giving to; but he has quite the following on there. Bucky is the surprising one though, he has more followers than even Tony, and apparently is very good at ‘shit posting’ or whatever that is. So they gather in front of the tree, Steve is kissing Bucky’s cheek Tony has his arm slung around Peter’s shoulder, Steve and Tony’s hands are twined together. They’re each wearing stupid Christmas jumpers; Tony even has a Santa hat perched atop his head. Each of them gets to vet the photo when it’s been taken. Steve emails it to himself, because he’s a dinosaur that can’t figure out Smessage. Tony grabs his phone after Bucky’s finished putting a cartoon penguin sticker on the photo.
“Tony,” Pepper has tears in her eyes, “congrats,” she gives him a huge hug and nearly breaks his ribs as she does so. “I’m so proud of you. The things you’ve been through and you’ve come out the other side stronger and better.”
“It is very much not your fault, not even a little bit,” Tony says, “it’s normal to feel this way but, trust me, Peter, you did so good getting to me and none of what happened is because of you. Do you want to know more, we can ask Doctor Banner to talk to you if you want to know more?”
“Fine,” he does as he’s told, “hi team!” Tony says he’s trying for bright and happy, rather than shitting his pants. But his voice is lacking his usual jovial tone, he knows what he’s going to find at the end of the corridor, and its weighing on his mind.
“It’s all my fault,” he croaks out, “I didn't get to you in time, if I had gotten to you earlier then they wouldn't have died.”
“It’s Rajma Dal,” Bruce is stumbling into the kitchen, he has a blurry, tired look that tells Steve he’s spent most of his time today in the lab, probably buried under a mountain of work alongside Tony. “It’s really just kidney beans and spices, you know, super simple. I could teach you to make it if you want?”
“So,” Bucky begins as they make their way through to the bedrooms where they’ve been hiding Peter’s present. “You wanna tell me why you can’t keep your eyes off Stark? I mean, more than normal.” There’s humour in the words; Steve can pick it out amongst the question, Bucky’s wearing one of his wry smiles. “Stevie, don’t lie, you can’t keep nothin’ from me.” Bucky says, and Steve knows he’s right.
“Uh huh,” Tony takes the Doctor’s hand, “is that your real name? Because, man that must be a fun one with the kids.”
“We’ll get you back to the tower; I have the best doctors in Manhattan there, we even have Doctor Banner. He’ll get you through this, then when you’re better you and Peter can go home.” Tony rambles desperately trying to stop the flow of blood.
After Peter has calmed down enough, Clint, Sam, and Steve join Thor, Rhodes, and Natasha to do one more completely final sweep of the building, before they burn it to the ground. They don’t find much, but there is a box of files that had been stored in a hidden alcove. Natasha finds it, it’s full of pieces of paper in Russian and about twenty memory drives. Tony takes it from her, he can upload the drives to JARVIS on the quinjet so the AI can start decrypting and filing the information.
“Do you want me to put it on you now? I’m going to dull the sensations for a bit, not completely but I don’t want you to be overwhelmed,” Tony takes the arm as Bucky nods and gets into his chair; he’s practically vibrating with excitement, Tony is too, he wants to know if all the nights of getting to bed a three am were worth it. He takes the normal joints and connections and hooks the arm to them, making sure that the quick release is fitted and working. All the time he’s working he narrates what he’s doing, he tries to make it seem like it’s for Steve’s benefit, but he’s pretty sure that Bucky knows who he’s doing it for. “Okay, now it’s just this button here, look, you might need to know where it is. This button here turns on and off the neural transmitters, those are the things in charge of sensation; if you ever feel overwhelmed or anything then just press this for five seconds to turn them off, or a short, sharp press to turn them up and/or down.”
“I said I don’t wanna talk,” Bucky’s gruff, his voice is gravelly, he draws in on himself; Steve can see him shutting down like one of Tony’s computers, the light inside him seems to wink out. “You got Tony, that’s good, great. He’s good for you, I don’t remember seein’ you this happy, Stevie. Not even when we were in the Commandos, y’know, I don’ wanna get in between you an’ him.” He shovels more curry into his mouth, “hey, we should go thank Big Green for this, it’s darn good though I’m not sure exactly what’s in it.”
“We got to where your aunt and uncle were being kept last night, that’s why you had to go to Ned’s again, cause there wasn’t going to be anyone to take care of you,” Tony explains, Peter’s nodding. “We had to fight some pretty bad people to get to them, do you remember what I told you about them?” Peter nods again; his hand is shaking where it clutches the cushion. “Good. And you remember that I told you it would be tough for us to get to them?” Peter lets out a little sob, his eyes filling with tears, but he nods again. “Okay, Peter, I’m really sorry, but I’m going to have to tell that this is going to be very sad.” Tony takes a deep breath, “we did everything we could but, we weren’t able to get to your aunt and uncle in time to save them, they both died before we could get to them.” Peter shakes his head, his hair flopping in front of his eyes, tears are running freely down his cheeks.
“Tony, I’m going to head to SHEILD, see if they can find a lock on either Bucky or Peter; you should get some rest,” Steve sounds so tired, he’s essentially just run a two day marathon; but Tony knows that Steve won’t be able to sleep until Bucky and Peter are found or he passes out.
The movement is familiar and alien all at once; he’s carried Steve a hundred times before; but not after he’d been defrosted. He hasn't really touched Steve at all since leaving Wakanda, and he can’t help but miss the natural touches they had shared during and before the war. Bucky shifts so that he’s carrying Steve bridal style, it’s a strain this way, but a fireman’s lift would wake Steve up. Steve’s room isn’t far away, and the metal arm was designed to take a lot of weight, he knows Stark made it so that Bucky could lift buildings with it; it’s his human arm which complains because of the weight.
“You know I left some toast in the toaster for you, there was no need to steal mine,” Steve says mildly sitting down next to Clint. “Come on Tony, just sit and eat with us for once.”
He’s cut off as Bucky’s voice comes through the comms, “I’ve been hit, uh,” there’s a terrible, rattling breath, “it’s not good. Stevie-“ Bucky’s cut off by something, Tony can feel his whole world shrink, he can’t focus on both Bucky and Peter, he’s frozen to the ground; he can hear Rhodey shouting at him, he can feel the other man’s hand on his shoulder.
“I’ll talk to Fury, no point being Captain America if I can’t use it for anything, is there?” Steve grins, as they pull apart. He starts to lead Tony out of the room by his wrist, Tony shakes his head a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.
I'm on holiday and time and wifi have been less than available, so the next chapter will be up at some point in the next three weeks or so.
warnings for a detailed panic attack and a description of a murder scene.
“So what you’re saying is that they don’t remember systematically executing two entire terrorist organisations, and bringing down four world governments. You’re telling me that my son and my-“ Tony chokes out a breath that looks painful, “you’re telling me that my son and my lover have no memories and that they think it is still like 2014 when it’s 2015, and that they’re completely normal?”
“No, we don’t know if the kid is actually yours, you can’t just believe him like that. His mother could have told him to come here and get money from you-“
“Oh shit, oh fuck. Did you just ‘young man’ me, Barnes? Oh, it is so on,” Tony’s laughing so hard he’s doubled over, there are crinkles around his eyes, eyes which are now filling up with tears. “Fuck me, Barnes, that was flawless.”
Sorry, this chapter took so long, honestly, I lost motivation to write this because I got Very Busy but I'm back and updates will continue. Let me know what you thought of this!!!
It’s all over the internet in fewer than thirty minutes. Tony knows ‘cause it’s already trending he’s had twitter being monitored by JARVIS for any word on any of them. He’s watching the hashtag climb the ranks until it’s number one. JARVIS is scouring through it, reporting any of the hateful tweets (of which there are more than a few), Tony watches as the AI shows him the nice ones.
“When have we ever got what we wanted?” Coulson pats Clint on the shoulder, “I’m going to make an official report with SHIELD, other organisations are going to want to be warned that the Winter Soldier is active.”
“Yeah, though I think he left pretty soon after he saw you guys start playing tonsil hockey,” Clint laughs a little, hopping off the counter and looking in the fridge, “ooh pizza rolls! I wonder if I could dip these in coffee…”
“You’re his father, nothing will ever change that, not now he knows,” Steve shakes his head.
The first thing he feels is Bucky, big muscular arms scooping him up off the floor; lips are pressed against his, hot and insistent. Tony doesn't even think about not returning Bucky’s kiss; he’s waited all year to feel this feeling again. Bucky’s lips are slightly chapped, and his metal hand is cool against Tony’s cheek. Bucky strokes Tony’s cheek with his thumb, Tony’s arms are winding themselves around Bucky’s waist, resting at his hips; he strokes the tiny strip of skin that’s exposed from where Bucky’s t-shirt has ridden up.
“Care to join?” Steve asks them both, “we’ve got time…”
“JARVIS has twitter huh?” Bucky turns to Tony with his eyebrow raised, “didn’t think he could do that kind of thing, what with being a computer and all.”
“Yeah, this is okay by me,” Steve smiles, running the tips of his fingers down Bucky’s cheek, “this was worth the wait.”
@tonystark congrats!! hope there’s a seat for me!<<
“Uh, so my mom and dad were working for shield when they died in a plane crash, it was when I was real young so, ‘m used to not having them around so much. I went to live with my Aunt May and Uncle Ben and everything was fine until like a month ago?” Peter pauses and takes a deep breath, “May and Ben were fighting because it looked like someone had broken into the house. In to the room where my dad’s stuff was kept, it looked like they’d read through it all but hadn't taken anything. Aunt May wanted to move, but Uncle Ben kept saying that we shouldn’t let em win.” Peter stops and fiddles with his hoodie again, the cuffs are fraying and coming apart and the dusky blue material looks like its been through three or four too many washes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s the thing, Tones; we found them alive. There are no bodies.” Rhodey watches Tony fall apart. He’s seen it before; he’s been the one to build Tony back up from the ground, but not like this. It has never been like this before, not so whole and all-consuming. “They don’t remember the last year, nothing, their memories must have been completely wiped.”
#ihavethreedads #theycombinetomaketheultimatedad #merrycrisis<<
and there's also kidnapping etc.
“Sorry, Cap,” Tony mumbles, “didn’t want you to try and stop me.” He doesn't get a proper response to that, just a huff of air which could have been a small laugh.
“If you two are finished, then go suit up,” Tony’s voice comes from the suit, all cold and impersonal, but the worry and dread that have coloured his words in the last few days are still evident. “I want my son back.”
“Fuck,” Tony says, dropping his head on to Ben’s chest. “What the hell am I going to do?” His voice cracks, his tears have not stopped falling.
“Mr- Mr- Mr Stark? Please, you gotta let me in!” The boy says, “you gotta let me in!” Peter is wearing an old hoodie, and torn up jeans; he looks like he hasn't slept in a week, he has various bits of garden stuck in his hair.
“The guy was a member of the Ten Rings,” he begins, “he was killed by a bullet to the back of the head, we’ll have to wait till the post-mortem to find out what kind of bullet.”
Steve grips his friend’s hand as he fumbles for the nanobot stuff that Tony gave him before the mission. “You’re not going to die, Buck,” Steve says, his hands are shaking so badly that he’s worried he’s going to set the spray off in the wrong direction and waste it. “That’s an order.” He says in his firmest Captain America voice, smiling when Bucky lifts his hand and salutes him. The nanobot spray is a miracle; Steve notices as he sprays it on to Bucky’s wounds, and watches the skin, muscles and tissues knit together.
“I’m still here, Stevie.” Steve can feel Bucky grin, “you’d not last a week without me, Punk.” He’s coughing again, so hard that it’s wracking his whole body, like when Steve had pneumonia. “Fuck.”
“Nightly,” JARVIS answers, “Sir has asked me to wake him when his heart rate elevates during sleep. However, it is better if he is not woken. Sir often does not return to sleep after experiencing a nightmare.”
“I could do it?” Bucky says, “I’m better at jumping off buildings than you anyways. It’d be good for me to get out, I need to get back in shape again; I’m feeling like an old man.”
Okay so updates are gonna be shorter from now on, honestly 3-4k per chapter was hard for me to do, and it's harder now what with being at uni and doing my thesis and three other essays I have to do this term, including like two exams so yeah expect updates to be 1-3k in length!
“Um, so, we’re going to be talking about this when we get back; but before that, I need to know if there’s anything else you can do, Petey,” Tony says, looking up at Peter; if watching his son crawl to the top of the quinjet had shocked him, watching his son shoot webs out of his wrist catapults his brain into chaos mode. “So you’re like a spider-kid now, then?” Tony knows that his immediate ‘turn everything into humour’ setting probably isn't the most helpful thing, but he’s been left a little high and dry here.
“Sir and Mr. Barnes started quite the storm amongst the press, it appears that one member of the audience ignored the no live tweeting rule,” JARVIS answers, “they were banned from future conferences, but the damage appears to have been done. Ms. Pots has come and gone, she is talking through the next move with the PR department at the offices in San Fransisco. Mr. Barnes and Sir are upstairs talking with Peter. They are waiting for you.”
“How’d you know?” Bucky asks, his brain hurts slightly from the onslaught of information from Tony, but he mostly latches onto the fact that Tony totally knows a secret he’s been keeping for like 70 years. “Before, when you asked, you knew right? How’d you know?”
“You’re Captain America’s best friend,” Peter nods, “I like the comics, you’re the coolest!” He gives Bucky a small smile. “Ned showed me them; I like your arm.”
“Man, there are not enough pots of coffee in the world for this shit,” he sighs, “you go make sure that the others know what’s going down; I guess I’ll go talk to Steve and Tony. This is so fucked up. All I want is a pot noodle and nap with my dog.”
You might not remember me; I don’t really expect you to. You were in state to remember anything then, that’s why we only went on two dates before I broke up with you. Not before the mistake had been made, honestly, Peter is the best thing that has ever happened to me; and I don’t regret the act that brought him into the world. I didn’t want to burden you with knowing he existed, I know how you felt about kids; I hope that’s changed, Tony. You are the only one Peter has left now, and you are going to take care of our boy.
Thanks for reading, sorry this update took a while, honestly, i had two exams last week so that's why. I'm done with finals so updates should be a bit more on the regular side. Leaving comments and kudos keeps me writing!!
“I love it when you get all rebellious,” Tony grins pulling him down the hall towards his room, not before he pushes him against the wall outside and kisses him thoroughly.
“I don’t know for certain, but I’m sure we’ll figure something out,” Tony grimaces, “but, I’m going to always be here for you now. Steve’s gonna be here too, and the rest of the team. We’re family, and family sticks together, so you got all of us with you.” Peter doesn't stop crying; he’s shaking his head still. “You’re not always going to feel sad, Peter, it’s going to get better. We’re always going to be here to help you with whatever you need.” Peter all but throws himself at Tony, who freezes for second before pulling the boy to him. “I got you, I got you, Pete.” He looks up at Steve and manages a small smile before burying his face in Peter’s hair.
“I can walk on it fine, there’s no pain, it just twinges every now and then,” Peter says, looking at the doctor steadily.
“Then you don’t have to,” Steve squeezes his shoulder once before dropping his hand, “as long as you want me there, I will be.” He knows its true; it has been for a while, it only just hits him then just how much Tony means to him.
“Okay, that can wait till you’re ready then, but not too much longer. We would like to keep Peter in overnight, tomorrow night, but we are also aware of his mental health; if your AI could keep us updated on Peter’s status through the night, then there is no real reason that he shouldn’t go home. We would like to see Peter attending therapy sessions once a week instead of his usual bi-weekly sessions, just for a month or so. Apart from that, there is nothing else, Peter will need to stay for a few hours just so we can keep an eye, but you can go ahead and take him home.” She smiles, it’s kind, and understanding; Tony can’t help but smile back to her.
“Tony,” Bucky picks up the arm, “this is crazy. I never had anything like this, I can’t believe this is mine.” His voice is reverent like he’s afraid to touch it, he holds the arm delicately in his hands. “It don’t weight much a’ anything does it?”
“No, it’s been broken fairly recently though, and it’s been set out of place, see here, the inside part of the tibia is slightly wrong. That must be what is making Peter walk funny, though this fracture looks to be about a few weeks old. This would be within the time that Peter has been in your care, though I am sure you would have noticed a broken ankle.” The doctor considers this for a moment, she chooses her next words carefully and slowly. “Peter, did they inject you with anything apart from the stuff that makes you stick to walls?”
“Fuck off Barton,” Bucky rolls his eyes, “Tony wants you to watch Peter tonight, he’s going out for burgers with Steve and I. And hot pockets are not food.”
“Yeah, Stevie?” Bucky sighs, taking the box from Steve so he can get down from the bed.
“Yeah, well,” Bucky breathes again, the sound is wet and bloody. “I wasn’t jealous of you, Stevie. Do you remember when you ’n’ Tones got together? How I couldn't look at him for weeks even though he was workin’ on the arm?”
@sgtjbarnesofficial it would be an honor to interview you we could help spread your story the more people you reach, the more people you help<<
“JARVIS,” Bucky says, “mute the music, please,” he asks the AI nicely because mamma Barnes didn't raise no animal. The AI mutes the music without saying anything.
“Is now a good time to tell you that I think, I’d quite like to take you on a date?” Steve mumbles as he rests his forehead against Tony’s.
“It wasn't easy, that’s for sure, but we lived in Brooklyn, there was a pretty decent gay scene there if you knew where to look. Most of the other people around there just turned the other cheek, didn't see what they didn't want to, that kind’a thing you know?” Bucky smiles a little, remembering Brooklyn as it had been, “it was okay, we got by. But now, now I’m living, it’s nice to know that I won’t get arrested because of who’s hand I wanna hold.”
“Hey guys, where’s Bucky?” Peter says jumping down from the wing, “Did he not come? Is he okay? What about Natasha, and Bruce, Thor, and Rhodey?” He’s rocking on the balls of his feet, his arms swinging loosely at his sides.
Clint fully expects to fight his way out of the facility, but the building is empty as they move through it. The bodies of the agents they fought their way through on the way in still litter the corridors, he tells Peter to look up and straight ahead as they pass them, the kid is too young to see death like this. He ignores the voice in his head that tells him, that when he was Peter’s age, he saw deaths ten times worse than this.
“Thanks, Steve,” Tony exhales, his chest sinking as he scrubs a hand across his face, “let's do this then.”
Thank you all for leaving the kudos and the comments you have! It means a lot to me, really it does and I really appreciate every one of them.
“Oh no you don’t,” Steve stands in front of the door, blocking Tony’s exit. “You’re going to sit at the breakfast bar, drink some juice and eat a proper breakfast.”
“Only five seconds more Peter, take twenty deep breaths, and we’ll probably be done,” the doctor sitting next to Tony says as he moves the cursor down the screen. “Has Peter broken this ankle before, Mr Stark?”
“Fine, we’ll be down as soon as, can you stall them?” Tony asks, stealing a kiss from Steve as he leaves in his running gear. Now that he’s up, Tony is running at a hundred miles and minute, his brain is working overtime; JARVIS has loaded Pepper’s briefing and is projecting it in front of Tony as he moves around the room.
“Holy fuck,” Tony moans, the sound sounding sinful as it passes Tony’s lips. “This, this is good shit, Barnes. Why’ve you been holding out on me for so long? If I  knew you could make cocoa like this, you’d have been on cocoa duty a hell of a lot earlier.”
The common floor living room is empty; Tony knew it would be, most of the time the team doesn't start getting up and ready for the day until later in the morning. Steve would be in the kitchen, reading the paper and eating after his run; if Tony was lucky, there would be spare food for him to steal. Gold rays of the rising sun stream in through the floor to ceiling windows coating the room in a soft, warm light. It is spring in New York and the world is just about waking up from the winter. This is the kind of weather Tony loves, the kind of weather he loved in California, not cold enough for things to be grey and miserable and not warm enough for there to be too many bugs.
“Always are,” Steve huffs out a small laugh, which grows when he sees Bucky’s face turn into an indignant pout.
Natasha, as usual, is right; Steve and Tony are both pacing downstairs, they look up at Clint as he walks down the final few steps. Tony looks like hell, his hair is a mess and he’s wearing his workshop clothes, a tank and some tracksuit bottoms which are both covered in oil and various other stains Clint does not want to know about. Steve doesn't look much better, even if he looks less tired because of the serum; Clint doesn't know how to tell them what they've worked out, he doesn't want to tell them what they worked out. So he just sits down on a chair and cradles his head in his hands breathing deeply for a few seconds.
Tony is three days into a work binge; he’s slept, sure an hour on the worktop passed out totally counts; this time he’s eaten too. Pepper had dropped things by the lab yesterday, and he’s still got three-quarters of a cheese sandwich left in the tiny under-the-counter fridge. He’s not even consumed a drop of alcohol either, which he is quite proud of. He knows that there are at least four days left of this thing he has going, four days before he has his next board meeting where the thing he’s working on will go on display. He’ll have to argue with the board again, make them see that giving up the weapons was a good move, it’ll take some convincing, but he’s pretty sure the thing will work.
“You’re not bringing a dog here, that would make Peter want a dog, and he’s not getting one. They make my eyes itch, no matter how adorable they are,” the corners of his mouth twitch upward.
“You don’t think…” Clint asks, shaking his head. “It can’t be- it won’t be. There’s no way he’d do that right?”
“Honestly, Sir, Tony has to go and tell his twelve-year-old son, that he only just found out about and met, that his aunt and uncle have died; so really, Sir, with all due respect I will shove my shield so far up your-“
“Tony, I love it,” Bucky looks at him, really looks at him, Tony is standing very close; their shoulders are touching where they’re bending over the hologram together. Tony’s deep brown eyes are worried and unsure, a look Bucky never expected him to wear. “Always thought I should get rid of the star now ‘m back to workin’ for the right side.” He squeezes Tony’s shoulder, “and the black is good too. Thank you, Tony.” He wants Tony to know how much he appreciates everything he’s done for him, Bucky never expected Tony to forgive him for everything he did. Tony had done more than that, he’d brought Bucky into his home and given Bucky everything he’s ever wanted. Tony relaxes as he glances at Bucky’s face, and breaks into a smile. It’s that moment when Bucky knows that he’s fucked up, he’s gone on both Tony and Steve, and it’s pulling him in two. He coughs and pulls back slightly, Nat’s voice in his head echoes, telling him that it’s okay, but his heart won’t let him believe it. “Блядь, почему я?” He whispers, Tony pulls back too, concern etched in the line between his eyebrows.
“You want me to help?” Bucky asks incredulous, he’s not exactly the picture perfect upstanding Avenger that the rest of the team seem to put together. “Why not Steve?”
Bucky follows Tony’s lead, slipping into the suit Tony bought for him, he’s never worn it before; he’d scoffed at Tony when it had been thrown at him. Now he’s grateful to have it, he’s heard Tony call it his second armor; he can see why. When Tony steps into his suit, walls come up around him, and he wears that horrible fake smile like it’s been plastered on his face. Bucky wants to wipe it off, but he can’t do much apart from kiss Tony’s lips quickly as they head downstairs.
“Fuck it, my son’s a spider, my boyfriend is a super soldier from the 1940s, and I fly around in a morph-suit, so fuck it; go for it,” he stands up and moves towards the wall. There’s a pause as the doctor moves forwards, the light at his chest glows green again, and Tony can see the bandages disappearing from Bucky’s wounds; he can see the wound open and then close again like it never happened.
“We should order, I’ve been waiting to try these burgers for like 70 years,” Steve grins even as both Tony and Bucky roll their eyes at his joke.
Also I'm going into my final year of university in september so that means I have a thesis (10,000 words) due and I am working on that before I go back in the fall. So yeah... updates are going to be few and far between.
“Oh my god,” Clint gasps, laughter erupting from him. “I’m going to leave you kids to it, come on Peter lets go, you can kick my butt at whatever game you want while we eat all of these pizza rolls,”  he walks out of the room, with a huge plate full of pizza rolls; he takes Peter by the shoulder on his way past Bucky. “You guys have fun talking about all that adult shit.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Strong arms reach out for Tony, and he allows himself to snuggle into them, trying valiantly to ignore the sun as it calls for him to wake up. The whole world seems to come together and settle in its rightful place, as though this is how things should have always been. Contentment radiates out from their heap, where Tony is ensconced in Steve’s arms. For once in his life Tony’s brain is quiet, no stray thoughts move through his mind, he is completely content, with Bucky at his side and Steve at his back.
“Cap, I’m going in through the roof,” Tony tells him, with little room for Steve to question, he dives for the hatch, letting his repulsers take care of the Hydra agents that were waiting for him there. “Bye,” he smiles at them, forgetting for a minute that they wouldn't have been able to see it through the suit.
“I guess I could eat,” he mumbles, shock and horror not being enough to deter a hungry twelve-year-old boy.
“Sorry,” Tony grumbles, though he doesn't sound particularly sorry; Steve can see an unasked question in his eyes. “That was, intense.” Suddenly they’re all laughing, as though a cap has been let off from a bottle full of pent-up steam. Something has been released, and they can finally let go; all of the hiding and worrying can finally stop, it’s an intoxicating feeling.
“Yeah, that’s fine,” Peter shrugs and moves in the direction Tony was steering him.
Steve nods, at her. “Be careful, if something doesn’t feel right or you feel like you can’t handle the situation alone call for backup; the other’s are on their way. I want constant updates.” He turns back to Bucky as she disappears from view. “Stay with me Bucky, cause Peter’s going to be pissed if you’re not here when we get ‘im back.” He manoeuvres himself so that Bucky’s head is resting against his chest. “This ain’t the end of the goddamn line, Jerk.”
“Steve,” Tony starts, “I’d forgotten his mother’s name. I can’t even remember the year that I- that Peter was conceived, I don’t know what I was doing, where we were. If I were a judge, I’d never put me in charge of a kid.” He turns away from Steve, burying his face back into hands.
“This is all for me?” Peter gazes around the room in wonder, “you did this for me?” He looks at Tony, clearly on the verge of tears.
“If you think we’re sittin’ this thing out, Stevie, just cause we’re a little tired and beat up, then you’ve lost your damn mind,” Bucky nods, squeezing Steve’s shoulder with his metal hand, “what did I always say,” he pauses in mock thought, “I’m with ya till the end of the line, pal and this ain’t it.” He’s grinning, the line had become something of a private joke between them, though it was still as soothing as it had always been.
Tony enters the building through the roof, as usual, this time though Rhodey is behind him picking off any agent who thinks that they can sneak up on Iron Man and War Machine. JARVIS is working overtime, Tony’s installed him on everyone's night vision goggles, as their version of the HUD. Tony now has everyone’s status flickering before his eyes; he’s focusing on Steve’s praying that he won’t see the line that’s measuring his heart rate go flat. Three more agents drop in front of him, he’d barely even had to lift the repulser, his suit is hardwired for him, more intuitive and more dangerous than ever. He takes advantage of the empty corridor to pause and get his bearings, Rhodey coming to a stop on his left.
“Tony,” Steve croaks, desperately. He’s panicking a little, his mind whirring at a hundred miles a minute.
“I’m not doing it for you. Well, not wholly for you,” Bucky shakes his head, taking Tony’s hand. “What you said about doing even just one kid some good. That was me, back in the day, ’n’ Stevie too. We had no one, back then, no one who was like us. Not in the media anyway. I didn't know that what I was feeling when I looked at fellas was normal, not before Stevie and I properly looked around Brooklyn. Yeah, I guess that got me thinkin’ what if I could help someone you know? To actually help someone by doing this, then anything that happens to me is worth it, I’ve been through worse; I came out the other side ‘a that with two amazing fellas on my arms. I know this charity is important, so I’m gonna do this.”
“I know,” Steve mumbles into his hair, one hand on the back of his head, stroking and tugging the short strands there lightly. “We’ve got the go-ahead to see them; I was just waiting for you.”
“I think we should find a payphone and get SHEILD to come and pick us up,” Bucky mutters, “God knows what we’ve been doing and where we’ve been all this time, but I don’t think it’ll have been any kinda good thing, Pete.”
It's done. Thanks for coming on this ride. This really isn't the ending I'd envisaged but it's nice one, I was going to continue this story, but I really can't. It's too much what with my degree, and my novel. But leave a kudos and a comment if you've enjoyed this story.
“Have you really not seen Jurassic Park? Where were you?” Clint chooses this moment to walk into the kitchen. “The hot pockets were out of date, I ate one anyway, but even I can’t turn that into a depression meal. Do we have any pop tarts?”
“I’m not a doctor, Peter,” Tony says, shaking his head.
“Are you guys done making out? You know that really isn’t appropriate for the common areas,” Clint mutters from behind them, “honestly, I think you scarred Bruce.”
“Hey, J, what happened to the-“ Tony turns on instinct, looking around to see Bucky standing in the entrance to his workshop, the fingers on his metal arm flexing and spasming. “So, you did actually damage it?” Bucky nods, Tony walks towards him. “Honestly, did you think you could get by without coming to see me about it? Because I’m looking at that arm and I kind of want to cry, what the hell did you do to it?”
As if on cue, there’s a loud thump and everyone abruptly turns their heads to see a knife embedded into the wall, Natasha’s arm still finishing it’s arc across the room. Steve’s eyes widen at her incredulously.
Because you are my angel. And when it is finally your time, I will be waiting right here for you. So take comfort, sweetheart, for I will always be beside you, even when you can not see me. The shadows are my children, darkness my pets. And you, you are the Angel of Death.’
’No they won’t,’ the doctor agrees softly.
“Mom, no, don’t call dad,” he blurts, eye widening warily. “We’ll pick up our stuff-“
Steve shook his head, keeping silent with his lack of an answer.
”Nothing, just an extra dimensional inside joke,” Toni said, as if that explained everything.
Both father and son straighten. “Eugene is now banned from every Stark Industries facility, pay roll, and property. I see one hair of yours, I’ll press charges.”
“Milkshake?” Tony offers about halfway through his meal. He leans the cup towards Steve.
The Uncle convinces her that they need her to show off her newest creation of destruction, so she heads out. She’s supposed to be safe, and feels so confident she chooses a different wagon than her brother to ride in. Mistake. She is attacked by her own weapons and taken prisoner. Except there’s poison in her heart now. So she goes through open heart surgery without anesthesia so that they can slow the poison down. She eventually passes out just before they are finished.”
The man barely spared a glance at Steve before he focused his attention fully on Toni.
Steve sputtered. “What?”
There was an outcry from Steve and his team. Danvers held her hand up for silence. “Please wait until I am finished to comment.”
Steve adopts what Tony has dubbed his ‘kicked puppy’ look and Tony, mind finally rebooting, flicks him on the arm. “Relax, Capsicle, we’ve coped.”
Death’s father escapes. Understanding dies, for good, a dark magic preventing Death from letting him back into Angel’s life. The team fights the father and his army and they win. But Angel’s god father calls her and tells her that her allies a going to attack her. So she takes them out to protect her new team and dies. Death meets her, they chat, Death shows her a vision, Angel returns. And life goes on.
Toni didn’t even flinch. “Hey Glinda. I can’t find my hair clippy thingy Spider-tot gave to me.”
Angel knew he was using some of her stuff, she told him he was allowed to, but not once did the soldier thank her, not once did he let her help him.”
“What the hell happened in here?” Tony snaps, and all four adult-children jerk around to stare at him, extinguishing foam making their eyes seem manic.
Steve thought. Then he was distracted by a flash of light on her wrist. It was a simple black metal band, probably black plated gold, but Steve noticed that everyone else beside her had one too.
“Hey Tony,” Steve says, voice full of mirth. “The kid’s dating Wade.”
. Destruction killed Angel’s child and began to attack her family. They defeat it for the time, but Death’s Uncle attacks Angel. He snaps her neck. Death doesn’t waste any time sending Angel back. The exchange was so quick, that no one noticed Death’s Uncle killed her. Not even Death’s Uncle.
“Steve darling, can you get that?” There’s a gasp around the room at the pet name, but Steve just looks good-humoredly at him and doesn’t respond. They wait for more, but Tony’s apparently dismissed him, resolutely staring at his screen with a furrow in his brow.
“And then?”
Tony cocks his head. “Huh. I’m pretty sure I didn’t say you could set the kitchen on fire though.”
’So what happens now?’ The young girl asks.
Angel stops making weapons, and finds out the enemy got the supplies from her Uncle. He tries to kill her, but she succeeds in taking him out. And the shadows tell her he got a special place in Hel, right next to her father. The war calms down just a little bit more.
Steve sits Tony upright with a slightly amused and indulging look on his face. “If that’s your standards of a father, I don’t have to work too hard.”
Toni jerked violently, even as the red mist bounced of a golden shield around her that had most definitely not been there before.
“He called Peter a severely homophobic name, usually reserved for homosexual men,” MJ says, appearing uninterested although Tony knows it’s a front. Like calls to like after all.
Thor frowns, and Tony glares at him. Thor ups the look, pouting, and Tony resolutely doesn’t give in. Finally, Thor gives him puppy dog eyes and Tony groans in frustration.
“He can hold full conversations without realizing it, and then gets confused when we bring it up to him later because he doesn’t remember it,” Bruce adds sagely. “We almost burned down the kitchen once because of it.”
”Yes,” Toni replied.
”I don’t know, Hank always said not to trust a Stark,” Scott said.
“Your fighting is upsetting the children,” Bruce says, completely straight faced except for the slightest tick of his lips upward that he tries to hide by taking a sip of his tea.
in exchange for the title of Aunt.
“T’Challa did say Toni recruited some new members,” Sam had said.
“Mr. Stark, what are you doing here?” Peter asks as soon as Tony lets go.
‘Your parents,’ he says. ‘They were killed in a forge fire along with your butler.’
Jarvis’ response of “Captain Rogers is on his way” is over shadowed by Clint’s cry of indignation.
Steve and the others hadn’t seen Scott since then, and the other residents of the Compoud hardly more than that. Needless to say, Steve was surprised when Toni entered the cafeteria at five in the morning, obviously dressed for a day of business. She had on a navy suit, sleeve reaching her wrists, makeup done flawlessly, and tinted sunglasses perched on the crown her hair was arranged into. Steve couldn’t help but focus his attention on the black gold band still around her wrist. She adjusted her bra and headed towards the coffee maker.
Tony glares at him but ultimately steps down and lets Steve take the lead. But not without a venom filled “Yes,
”Rogers,” Toni parroted, filling her cup up to the brim.
“Right. A few months later the man moves in with her. She begins calling him ridiculous nicknames and he becomes like a brother to her. Then she has to go back to her father’s village and she meets Death again.
It was really only a matter of time before the public found out. That was expected. What was unexpected was who revealed it.
Toni cleared her throat. “Angel wakes up and the doctor who worked on her tells her she has a week to live. Those who captured her come in to demand that she make a weapon for them. She refuses. They torture her and torture her, and she meets Lady Death a few more times, but she doesn’t give in. They finally realize that pain is just an old friend, and Death like a mother and drag her outside of their little cave. Somehow they have hundreds of her weapons. One of the men speaks to her in a foreign language that she can understand, but none of them know that nor should they, so the doctor translates.
“You can’t do that,” Eugene argues, at the same time the senior says, “now Mr. Stark-“
Tony thinks that the panicked gaze that Peter shoots him, begging for escape, is good enough retribution for the teen’s previous comment.
Angel looks at them for a moment, and then shakes the foreign man’s hand.
“This is Dr. Stephen Strange, Sorcerer Supreme and retired neurosurgeon,” she continued and Strange nodded. “And Spider-Man, who I’m sure you’ve already met. There are others waiting inside, but you’ll be introduced later.” Spider-Man waggled his fingers in an imitation of a wave.
When Angel returns, she tells her brother everything. And he becomes the Master of Shadows. Years go by, and a messenger appears at Angels door.
story. Never said it was happy.”
“Like an hour ago. We asked what would happen if we heated glue and you said you didn’t know. Then we asked if we could test it and you said yes.”
“The children?” Steve wonders, and Bruce gestures at the table where Natasha and Clint were laying their heads down with twin innocent looks in their eyes. Right across from them, Thor is passed out with his head tilted back and mouth wide open, the occasional snort escaping him.
“That’s not what happened!” Flash argues, interrupting and all it takes is Steve’s dad look to get him to settle back down.
Toni ignored him. “There have been some changes around here since you left.”
In the end, it was negotiated that Eugene be suspended for a few days before spending another week in in-school-suspension and the next two months in detention. Tony led the way back to the car, still fuming and not quite happy with the punishment, wanting it to be more severe, but what can he do.
“Viz,” she breathed with excited eyes.
”I said this is a
”She punches him. Angel punches the soldier. And turns to slap the dragon, so they may both feel her pain of being lied to for even the smallest second. The dragon knows this, can tell by the look in her eyes, and both she and the dragon are expecting to just get it over and done with. The soldier, though, the soldier loses it. He attacks her. The dragon, confused by what happened, also joins the fight, and together the two leave Angel to bleed out.
“I’m going to go find Steve, and maybe ask why he didn’t help put a stop to this.”
Angel realizes that no one protested when the Uncle went after her, and it all comes crashing down on her that her family doesn’t love her like she loves them. Regardless, she fights with them against Destruction. Then she meets a young man who was blessed by Destruction with
”I think so?” Steve answered truthfully. “I don’t see how this is a true story, but I understand most of it.”
Fast forward a couple years and Angel is worried about the vision she saw. She starts trying to build a new child with Love and Peace. They are just about finished when the soldier comes in and tells them they found an enemy base. They go and destroy the base, but not before Angel is thrown back into the vision Death showed her. She knows it’s not Death causing her to see it, but she finds someone else’s blessing. She’s never seen such a blessing before so she takes it home. She studies it a little bit, but ultimately decides to get back to it when she has more time. She goes to hang out with her family. Unfortunately, even though nothing is active around the blessing, it stirs. Love notices and tries to help it, but it kills him. And Death can’t bring Love back because of what the blessing was.
"The butler sneaks the young girl some tools early one morning and the child begins to build. She builds and builds and within months her tiny room is filled with trinkets. Then she decides to build something for her father. ‘Maybe he’ll finally be proud of me,’ she thinks. She was wrong. She built him a weapon, and he takes one look at it, and tears it apart. ‘Worthless,’ he says and she can smell the alcohol on his breath when he comes after her. And she takes it. Doesn’t cry, hasn’t for a long time now because her family is supposed to be made of
“Hey Tony, I’m sorry to bother you, but a situation came up at Peter’s school and I can’t get off of work right now.” Tony had taken Peter in, surprisingly much to May’s encouragement around a few months ago. Now every weekend and sometimes even some week nights Peter would spend at the tower, hanging out with Bruce and Tony in the lab, playing video games with Clint, or sparring with Nat, Thor, and Steve.
’I know, my dear. But you must. You will have an extremely hard life, but you will change the world. Your pain becomes their saving grace. It is a man’s world right now, and you,
”It’s all your fault! You-you bitch!” She summoned her powers and before Steve could calm her down, she lashed out at Toni.
“I can tell you exactly what happened,” Ned speaks up. The principal waves him on. “Peter, MJ, and I were walking back to class from gym when Flash starting yelling insults at us. We-“
“Tony!” Steve calls. “We weren’t done!” He too rushes out of the room, giving Jarvis strict instructions not to let Tony lock himself in the lab.
“Thanks,” Natasha and Thor echo.
Steve settled back into his chair with a grumbled “fine.” Bucky patted him on the shoulder comfortingly, before turning back to Toni, who takes this as her cue.
”Well, yeah,” Steve said, thinking back on his time during the Depression.
”That’s awful,” Steve exclaimed.
“Supersoldier reflexes,” he reminds him. “I can drive faster.”
“Yeah that,” Ned agrees, and Peter hunches in on himself. Tony takes a deep breath.
”That’s not right!” Steve bursted. “She just found out the dragon killed her father figure, she wasn’t even that mad or anything she just wanted them to feel her pain! That was a normal human reaction! Better than a normal human reaction even, because she was able to keep her cool since she knew death wasn’t the end!”
Realizing no one had spoken yet, Steve gave them a friendly smile. “It’s good to be back. It’s been too long.”
”I have a question,” Toni said into the silence. “A riddle of morals, if you will.”
The Angel of Death cures herself once more and begins to live a happier life with the four children she made herself and blessed, giving them each a title. One Innocence, one Forgiveness, one Vengeance, and one Love.
Natasha resolutely stays silent, while Thor and Clint mumble an affirmative.
He’s cut off by Steve strolling into the room. “Jarvis said you needed me...” he trails off, appearing to take in the scene before him. Tony juts his chin out, daring him to make a comment about the state of his clothes. One of them, Tony suspects Thor, had left the jug of milk on the
”I was wondering if you could help me out,” Toni implored.
‘No they won’t,’ she says.
”Mmm,” is all Toni said, and she began to sip her coffee again.
“Language.” Steve scrunches up his face, before a faint hearted expression crosses it. “Oh my gosh.”
“Mooom, Thor set the toaster on fire. Again,” Clint whines.
“I’m not sure, but I believe they said Peter’s been hurt,” she responds and Tony’s blood runs cold.
“Good.” He retreats back, content to let Steve work out logistics with the principal and instead choosing to fuss over Peter, who swats his hands away without much force.
”He claimed it was because he didn’t want to live under the rule of a king or tyrant, even when Angel assured him that wouldn’t be the case. She had double checked and triple checked and was making contingencies so it would never happen. But unknown to her, the real reason was that the soldier had been stealing from Angel to find the dragon, and he didn’t want her to find out, nor leave the place the dragon knew where to find him at.
“She makes a new family, this one ten times better. Unofficially adopts two more children, these ones not made but born, and gifts them with Soul and Wit. She starts dating a wizard, completes his blessing of Time. They all live happily ever after, blah, blah, the end.”
“Peter’s been hurt at school, we gotta go.” Tony is in the elevator before the doors fully open, Steve right on his heels. When they make it to the garage, Tony goes to get in the drivers seat but Steve stops him.
She finds out the soldier with the dragon is still alive, sans dragon. She meets him and together they take down Death’s father. She meets a man who she secretly had blessed with Peace years before and the spy and her friend. They all meet Death’s Uncle and lock up Death’s father. Angel finally gets to talk to the soldier, but he reminds her of her father and she remembers the stories that her father, her butler and her Aunt told her. The soldier was always brave, always a good man, never wrong. The soldier doesn’t like her, and even though Angel knows she’s not worthy of his praise, she can’t help but feel the weight of her father’s words come crashing down on her. So she does what she does best. She aggravates him, gives him a reason to hate her. The soldier was not good enough to see beyond her masks. No one ever was.
’We missed you,’ whispers the Flame of Life, and the Calm of Darkness.
”We’re still friends, Toni,” Steve beckoned with a smile. “No need for last names.”
A few years and Angel finds out that the thing that is keeping the poison from killing her, is also poisoning and killing her. She tries everything, there’s no cure. Someone tries to kill her, she kills him instead, but not before he places her family’s life in danger. Angel saves them, luckily.
She wore a beautiful red blouse and skimpy gold skirt that made Steve want to wrap her up and say ‘mine’. Her makeup was done flawlessly, all sharp lines and angles, winged eyeliner making her eyes enchanting and a subtle highlight causing her cheekbones to look like you could cut your finger on them if you weren’t careful. Steve remembered days when she would get up after a wonderful night together and let him watch as she got ready for the day. Toni had her hair pulled up in a complicated bun, and her crimson lipstick painted her lips like blood. Her tall high heels added several inches to her height.
“Hold on, why am I the mother?” He demands. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Steve pinch the bridge of his nose, muttering something like “
, and Tony, in his hunger fueled mindset of cooking, tripped over it with a full bag of flour in his hands. Needless to say, he was not very happy. To his credit, Steve just closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, before coming to stand next to Tony. He crosses his arms and surveys them sternly.
“I swear to god, if you say boys will be boys I will repulser your ass,” Tony snaps, pointing his finger at the father threateningly. “I should know what boys act like, I have three at home.” Belatedly he realizes that was poor wording in regards to Bruce, Thor, and Clint, and that the tabloids tomorrow will probably be filled with headlines about his mystery children, but it fits. “This was harassment, clear and simple, and I will press charges if forced. Am I clear?”
So as the boys get closer, unknowing of the dangers they’re bringing on to themselves trying to get to the Angel of Death, she’s already unsheathed several blades and hidden them up her sleeves, keeping her back to them. They are just about upon her when a figure launches out of the shadows, tackling the other three and knocking them out with ease.
“Natasha, give Clint back his bow,” Tony absentmindedly says,
There’s a thump, and the screeching of a chair, and another thump, and finally Thor is apparently settled because he doesn’t make another sound.
“Wait!” Steve called, then scrambled for an excuse when they actually listened. “What was the point of the riddle?”
‘You deserve this,’ the soldier seems to say to her. And he goes back to his team and claims that she tried to kill them, when she only wanted to cause them a little pain. Had she wanted them dead, they would be dead with slit throats because even after all those years her Aunt’s lessons of always being armed stuck with her, and her knives were still hidden in her sleeves.”
“No, I should have done worse,” Tony grumbles and they way Steve peers at him makes him settle down, lest he get the ‘we are adults, we can not threaten minors’ speech. Again.
”The young girl wakes up in a strange place. It’s all dark rocks and dim lights. She sits up and looks around, immediately noticing a beautiful woman dressed in robes of shadows at her feet. ‘That’s not how you really look,’ the girl says. The woman chuckles at her and drops the disguise. Half of her is still a beautiful maiden, the other half, a skeleton.
“But she comes back,” Steve enunciated cautiously.
They both watched as the door slammed shut behind him.
“When? And to what?” Tony says, mildly horrified.
********
That had been two weeks ago.
“All right, you little shits, Mama’s home!” Tony calls, stumbling out of the elevator with his arms full of bags.
“Tony! Mom!” comes a shout from down the hall. Tony vaguely hears the voice but doesn’t register it.
”Whose fault is that?” Rhodes asked coldly, body tensing. Toni waved a hand at him and he backed down, but not without a sneer.
”That’s life,” Toni snapped, then seemed to regain control over herself. “The soldier convinced the rest of the not-quite-a-family-anymore not to move, claiming they would be enslaved. The only ones who agreed with Angel were her brother, Master of Shadows, and her grandson, Kindness. Innocence, Vengence, Frogiveness, Flame, and Calm all don’t know about what’s going on in her house, as she moved them to the new village almost immediately. So Angel recruites some new people to help her convince the others to move, there ends up being a fight. Angel’s brother dies, Death brings him back, but he’s severely injured. Those who opposed Angel actually get captured by the king of another village and are imprisoned and sentenced to a life under the kings rule. Sound fair?”
“Mama brought McDonald’s!” Clint exclaims, throwing his hands up in the air and backflipping over the couch. “Mama brought McDonald’s!”
”Ready?”
seen some sense. Presidential pardons were issued to the team, and after a whole year in Wakanda they could return home. T’Challa’s generosity had been great, but it just wasn’t the Compound. The young king had held a meeting and mentioned something about the Accords, new members, and a probation time, but Steve hadn’t really been paying attention.
“Sweet we can eat in the liv-“
Strange smirked at Rhodes and beckoned his hand. Rhodes pouted and handed back whatever Strange had give him before.
Several things happened at once.
ending. He’s about to ask who the person in the story was, when a shower of golden sparks drew his attention. The sparks formed into a ring, and Strange stepped through dressed in a sharp business suit, color matching Toni’s. The flying cape floated in after him, and the portal closed.
”Mhm,” Stee agreed.
’I must return you to your own place amongst the living,’ Death says sadly.
’No,’ Hela answers her. ‘But you can. You, my Angel, can bless whoever you feel worthy enough to receive that blessing.’
“Language,” Steve reprimands, carrying at least twenty brown bags into the kitchen and dumping them on the table. He passes them out, checking each one. “Natasha, here’s your double with fries and sweet tea.”
Peter tilts his head back to look at Steve, downtrodden. “Hi Mr. Captain Sir.”
Of all of the names given to the young girl, this one just felt right. She’s so happy to be given a name, that she practically tackles Death in a hug. ‘Thank you.’
“Yes sir,” they reply and Tony nods.
“That’s nice, Tasha.”
Finally, Steve let himself take in Toni’s appearance. Toni looked, well, Toni looked
Steve looked over at Bucky, recognizing the parallel to his friend’s history. But instead of remembrance in his eyes, his face was pale and he was staring in horror at Toni. Steve figured it was because of the story.
Whatever Clint’s reply would have been, it was cut off by the quinjet touching down with a jolt. The ramp lowered slowly, sunlight streaming into the cabin. As leader, Steve was the first one off.
“He’s here because he wants to be, because he is supporting the project too, and because he is representing the rest of the Avengers,” Tony smiles and gestures for Bucky to speak.

Come yell at me on tumblr @: wxntxr-sxldxxr !
“And the date, J?” Tony asks because he isn’t entirely sure, he remembers heading down to the lab on a Monday.
“Iron Man, you have to stop turning off your comms,” Steve doesn't even sound annoyed, he sounds, Tony thinks, worried. “We need to be able to contact you.” Tony realises he’s right, that there is worry bleeding through the Captain America voice. That Steve sounds more like Steve, and not Captain America than he usually does when they're fighting for their lives.
Clint and Peter are in the kitchen; Tony pops his head in, Bucky can’t hear many of the quietly whispered words but before he knows it Tony is kissing the top of Peter’s head and leaving the room. Clint gives Bucky a thumbs up and a wink, Bucky can’t help but smile a bit before nodding, he does roll his eyes when Clint waggles his eyebrows though. Tony shakes his head and takes Bucky’s elbow leading him to the elevator.
“You’re going to be fine Tony,” Steve murmurs, dipping his head down so that he can whisper into Tony’s ear low enough that the rest of the team can’t hear. “You are going to be a great dad.” And if Tony pretty much purrs like a cat, then Steve won’t tell a soul.
I ain't even sorry. Thank you for all the kudos I am literally in shock at this I don't know how to react but thank you, and for all the kind words as well!!! They keep me so motivated to keep writing this!
“You want me to make you better at sneaking around?” Tony considers him for a minute, raising an eyebrow as he brings up a hologram of the arm, Bucky nods, Tony shakes his head. “Sure, but now I’m definitely putting some sort of bell on you, you’ve nearly made me die of a heart attack over ten times since you started living here. That arm is one of my only ways of knowing when you’re around, like an early warning system, I have a heart condition, Barnes. I’m no spring chicken unlike you cooked from frozen soldiers. But sure, J, mock up the matte black for me.” The arm changes in front of Bucky’s eyes, it goes from shiny silver to matt black, becoming as dark as night. The star on the outside of the arm changes too, from red to grey and from the star that HYDRA gave him to the same star that’s on the front of Steve’s uniform. “I thought I’d change the star too, but only when you asked to change the rest of the arm too, I didn’t want to push you, you know but um we can keep it the same as it was if you want. I don’t know your branding or whatever, and I don't wanna seem like I’m asking you to change your whole dealio, but yeah, I thought that that star would work better-“
“You should have seen it,” he says, “their faces, it was wonderful. I’ve already started planning the Stark Industries float for Pride this year, and I’ve sorted out funding for some different charities, we should be doing more. There are always people who need help.”
“Curry,” he says, in a quiet voice, he smiles at Steve gesturing to the steaming bowl in front of him. “Sorry, I didn’t wanna start without you, but I’m gonna fade away if I don’t put some food in my face in, like, a hot minute.”
>>@TheEllenShow
The first time Bucky sees Peter is when he hears the screaming, he recognises the sound from the countless times he’s heard it coming from his own mouth. It wakes him up, his ears are still sensitive, and he still sleeps lightly. The noise doesn't sound like Stark, or Steve, it sounds like it’s coming from the guest room in their shared suite. As far as he knows the room isn’t supposed to be occupied; Colonel Rhodes is somewhere in Europe, and Sam has moved out to his own apartment in the tower. His ears quickly pinpoint where the sound is coming from, and it is definitely the guest room. Getting out of bed is simple, despite the fact his room is a mess of discarded clothes and various bits of weaponry, but his eyes are well adjusted to the dark, so it is easy for him to find his way to the door.
Steve and Bucky are standing in the doorway, waiting for Tony before they leave. Tony walks towards them; his face has lost the stressed pinched look that it had worn when Bucky had first entered the room. He smiles tiredly at them before nodding his head in the direction of the living room, one eyebrow raised in question. Bucky looks at Steve, a conversation happening between all three of them, completely silently. Steve shrugs and heads on over to the large communal living area; it’s set out over multiple floors, each with various doors and halls leading off it. In the very centre of it all is a platform with sofas and cosy armchairs. Bucky immediately falls into the high-backed, deep winged armchair; Steve collapses on one of the couches, he doesn't try and contain his surprise when Tony sits on the same one, resting his feet in Steve’s lap. Bucky grins and winks at Steve who blushes deeply from ear to ear, rolling his eyes at Bucky.
“Stuff the rules,” Steve mumbles as he buries his face in Bucky’s neck, he curls his hand around Bucky’s neck and pulls him into a kiss. “Stuff the rules. You’re both stuck with me now, unfortunately.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Kitchen,” Bucky mumbles, “I’m famished.”
“Right,” Steve laughs, as Tony blasts off, heading towards Bowery. “Okay Avengers, what are we looking at?”
“Please,” Steve has never heard Tony sound so desperate, and he looks down to see tears leaking out Tony’s eyes. “Just, you know, it’s been a long couple days. So please,” Tony doesn't even put what he needs in words, Steve finds that he doesn't need him to; he knows what Tony wants. He keeps his hand in the other man’s hair, weaving the soft strands around his fingers, scratching lightly at Tony’s scalp.
Tony smiles as he opens the clips on the box and presents the arm to Bucky. It’s honestly a gorgeous piece of engineering, slimline while matching the dimensions of Bucky’s flesh arm exactly. It’s lightweight, and Tony knows that it’ll feel as natural as any biological arm could ever feel. He had asked Bucky’s choice of colours as a finishing touch to what would have been a boring grey arm. Tony looks up and watches as Bucky’s eye widen, Steve’s do too, he knows that he’s done something right when Bucky gathers him up in a hug, squeezing him so tightly that Tony can’t breathe. Not that he minds.
“I,” Steve sighs, reaching into the air vent above his bed to retrieve the box, “I just realised, I’m completely gone on ‘im, Buck.” There’s no sense in keeping it bottled up, Steve knows, it would come out eventually. Bucky knows everything about Steve, has done since they were young, Steve remembers the whispered confessions they shared as they curled up together. “Think I’ve felt this way for a while, I’m just so used to burying those feelings deep down, hiding that part of me. It’s still a shock when I walk down the streets and see two fellas holdin’ hands, you know?” Bucky nods, it’s jerky, and his shoulders are tense. “Buck?”
“You did?” Steve smiles, his eyes lighting up as he turns into Tony, “I wasn't sure there were places left.” He’s so excited that it melts Tony’s heart.
“You know,” Bruce sighs, rubbing the bridge of his nose, “you two are terrifying when you club together. Yeah okay, James, I’ll teach you to make the curry if you stop grinning at me like that,” Bruce smiles though, “come on.” Bruce grabs Bucky and his bowl and leads him through to the pantry. “I’ll start by getting you to try and guess what spices are in there. Tony’s in his lab, Steve.” He throws over his shoulder.
“Buck-“ Steve tries, his places a hand on Bucky’s shoulder, “we should-“
“That band with the lead singer who was bi?” Tony nods a little proudly, looking at Bucky with surprisingly soft eyes. “You sing good, Shellhead,” Bucky grins, moving away from Steve and sitting on the barstool next to Tony. They make a handsome pair, Steve’s mind wanders, all glossy brown hair and tan and pale skin mixing.
Warnings for nightmares in this one, and talking about the death of parents and relatives and such.
“Don’t get your panties in a twist, Barnes, we’ll work something out.” Tony stands up straight, from where he was hunched over Bucky’s shoulder. “Now, where did I stick that non-mechanical prosthetic…” He turns to a shelf that has a whole load of stuff on it, Bucky thinks he can see several different repulsers for Tony’s suit hit the floor before Tony pulls out an arm that looks just like any other prosthesis. “Here! The only difference between this and the arms they give you at the hospital is that this is made out of carbon fiber and vibranium, so like it’s pretty much indestructible, and I even painted a little “A” logo on the shoulder for you! It should just…” Tony walks over to Bucky, and slots the arm on to his shoulder. “Clip in like that, nice to know that works, I’ve never made anything like this so.”
“Protecting Tony Stark is my primary objective,” there’s a warning in that sentence, Steve can feel it. “You make him happy, Captain, please continue to do so.”
“Great!” Bucky grins, “I could take Peter out for ice cream, if that’s okay, I know he’s been bouncing off the walls since he got back. Not having the arm means I can get used to the new less high tech prosthetic you built.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re right,” Steve nods, following Bucky out the room, “I’m going to tell him tonight. Thanks, Buck, you always know how to make me feel better.” Steve slings his arm around Bucky’s shoulders; Bucky tries to stop himself from falling apart.
“They’re fine,” Bucky points to an article in the paper, the headline at the top of the page reads ‘Captain America and Iron Man: Give us back our family’. Peter smiles looking at the words, it builds something warm inside him, taking over the black feeling he’s had since he found himself on the street.
Peter doesn't reply, he nods and stays in the same position, his head resting on Steve’s shoulder; his arms are wound around Steve’s waist. Steve smiles and presses a kiss on to the top of Peter’s head, he feels privileged that Peter thought he could talk to him, but he also feels a surge of worry; he hopes that Peter has told his dad about how he was feeling. Steve doesn't want to discuss Peter without him present, but he knows that Tony should be aware of how his son is feeling. Peter’s breathing slows and evens out, he’s fallen asleep, snuggled into Steve’s side. Steve is sure he has never seen anything more adorable in his entire life, but he is also completely trapped. Peter has huge black bags under his eyes and Steve is pretty sure that he hasn't been sleeping, so now he can’t move, because if he does he’ll wake Peter up. He sighs and looks up at the ceiling, wondering if he could talk to JARVIS and get Tony in here without waking Peter.
“I’ll just…” he says, but he ducks out of the door before he can finish the sentence, leaving a confused Tony in his wake.
“Maybe they're in the gym or something?” Tony can hear that Steve is starting to worry too, his eyes are open now, and tension is setting into his shoulders in a taut line. “JARVIS, are Bucky and Peter anywhere in the tower right now?”
“So you’re a wizard?” Tony raises an eyebrow, “because I can say now that there is nothing that magic can do for him that medicine has already tried.”
“Yeah, but I don’t have a medical license,” Tony counters ruffling Peter’s hair, “okay you can ask for Bruce or Doctor Chavez to do it, but I can’t give you a blood test, Petey.”
“Just about to, you wanna see,” Peter bounds over.
“Do you even live here?” Tony shoots back, “thought you had a shitty apartment in Bed-Stuy? Why are you here eating my pop tarts and interrupting my conversations?”
“Cap,” Tony looks up at him, “please, get my son back, we’ve got Bucky, and we’re going to get him out of here, but no one’s found Peter yet.”
“Negative,” Steve’s voice is crackling, but Tony can hear the desperation in it. “There’s no sign of him; he must be in another cell in your quadrant. Keep searching Iron Man.” Tony knows that Steve is trying to give him orders, to keep him focused and on his game. He gives in. Letting the Captain choose his next move.
“Really?” Steve sounded surprised.
Steve dipped the razor in the sink and started on the other cheek. Tony let himself relax and enjoy the feel of the razor scraping the hair away and the gentle sound of Steve’s soft breathing as he did it. He didn’t say anything as he worked.
Tony punched another button, updating information so Anthony would be up to date on his life as well as how he looked. It was uncanny, like looking in a mirror yet he could touch Anthony and he felt exactly like a real person.
“Can we tell Nat we made it ourselves, do you think?” Tony pondered.
“I don’t know if I can,” Tony told him.
Tony put his arms around Steve and held him close, kissing his temple and his cheek. As undone as Tony felt, Steve seemed to be more so. Tony was a little a loss for what to say to him.
One evening when they got back from riding out to the ranches, Steve invited Tony to have dinner with him in his little apartment over the jail. He got dinner from Mrs. Hill, who ran a rooming house and often made dinner for him and his prisoners.
The sheriff shook his head. “None. You can drink all you like when we get back.”
Ninety-nine times out of a hundred, Steve would have said no, but tonight, he didn’t. “Yeah, I’ll drink a whiskey with you.”
“They look like us,” Tony said, his voice quiet as he sat down beside Steve on the sofa.
Tony shivered. Steve looked up at him and Tony saw no pity, no revulsion. He saw desire and he saw love in that steady blue gaze. Steve kissed the middle of the circle then moved his kisses farther out, to nip at Tony’s nipples then downward until Tony moaned out loud and grabbed the sheet in his hands.
“Like what?” Tony simply couldn’t help himself and he was fairly sure that Steve was counting on that.
All the while, they were kissing.
God in heaven, he was more beautiful than he’d been before. While he had always looked like the All-American man, now his hair was long and shaggy – and dark, it was darker than Tony remembered it being - and he had a beard. He was dressed in black from head to toe. Tony had never found him hotter.
Steve found sleep a little more elusive. He wondered if he’d just made the biggest mistake of his life. Neither he or Tony were going to last long in a town like Timely. He wasn’t sure his heart could stand any more breaking, if something happened to Stark.
“Why, Tony? There is nothing about you that I won’t love. Surely you know that by now.”
“What does JARVIS say?”
Stark set his cup down after he took a sip. “There is one other way to chase those ghosts away, for a while anyway.”
He backed toward his sofa, pulling Steve with him. They landed on the sofa still in one another’s embrace. Steve pressed him against the arm of the sofa, kissing him until both of them were quite breathless.
Tony stood. “I better get going. I still have to shower and get to an 11 am meeting with Pepper.”
“Shit! That feels good!” Tony told him.
“You didn’t have to click on them.”
He sent Steve a link to some nice simple man/woman porn… a pretty redhead and a tall studly blond man.  Nat and Steve lookalikes?  Maybe.
Steve went still and let Tony slide back down to the ground. “What do you mean?”
Steve lifted his head and looked at Tony as best as he could in the darkened room.  “If this is what I get for watching you sleep, I think I’ll come back every night.”
Steve nodded and texted all the others. He really enjoyed his afternoon coffee breaks with Tony.
Steve sent then regretted it. Tony would think he was flirting.
“Shit, I’ve missed this,” Tony murmured, running his hand through Steve’s dark hair. He stopped talking in actual words when Steve slid his mouth down, taking Tony in.
“You sure this is what you wanna do, sheriff?” Stark asked him as he freed Steve from his trousers.
Steve kissed him, a long, wet drunken kiss that left both of them breathless. He pushed Tony toward the sofa against the wall and they fell onto it in one another’s arms. Steve could feel Tony’s cock pressed against him and could feel how hard he was. He ran a hand down between them and began to rub Stark through his trousers.
Did Tony think so too? Steve had to admit that kissing Stark would not be the worst fate that could befall a man. He had always liked men as well as women, something that was not commonly acknowledged in his day and he wasn’t sure it was very commonly acknowledged today either.
Steve was certain it was a bad idea to ask Tony to help make a cake for Natasha for her birthday. And yet he did. And here they were, in the kitchen at 3:48 am on the day before her birthday.
No one seemed to know. He asked and he spied and asked some more. Nothing. His break came by accident – or maybe it wasn’t an accident at all.
Steve looked at the floor. “I’m sorry.”
“I’ll be fine, Miss Maximoff. Just need a little numbing like Stark.”
Tony went to the bedroom, stripped and got in the shower. He washed himself all but his back and called for Steve to join him. Steve stepped into the shower and scrubbed the grime and dirt from Tony’s back. He leaned close and kissed Tony’s neck and then his shoulder.
“I’m here to catch you this time,” Steve told him as he let go of him.
Steve laughed and pulled him onto his lap. “So can I sneak up here anytime I want to?”
“You look different,” Tony finally said after staring for far too long.
Tony shrugged. “The internet has many wonders.”
Steve had never been so distracted in his entire life as he was when Tony knelt down in front of him and oohed and ahed at how sweet the icing was. After he finished that, Tony convinced Steve that he, too, should try licking icing off of Tony’s own similar body part. Steve had agreed that this was a fine idea.
He pushed Tony back onto the sofa after the kiss and unfastened Tony’s trousers then pulled them off, along with his underwear. He leaned close as he’d done many times before and looked up at Tony before he took Tony into his hand and dipped his head and lapped at him.
“We’ll get him back, him, Sam, Wanda – we’ll get them back.” Tony had put his hand over Steve’s for just a moment.
“They’re going to hang one or both of us eventually anyway. You know that,” Tony said in that low, sexy voice. “We don’t have much to lose.”
He hesitated and  pulled the blade back.
Steve turned him around slowly. “I’m not Pepper. Your Arc Reactor and the scars mean you survived, that you’re still here.”
“Oh?” Steve’s mouth went dry. He’d thought of doing just that too many times over the last few weeks. Was Tony asking him? He knew he had to tread carefully.
He needed to call Pepper and tell her that he’d arrived okay.
Tony looked up at him and nodded.
The trouble was that after all the icing had been cleaned away, they had other ideas. Steve decided that the kitchen table was the perfect height to bend Tony over and do other, non-icing related activities. Icing did not work so well for that, but cooking oil was kinda nice.
There was no sound except that of the small bed banging the wall, Tony’s sighs and moans and Steve’s soft grunts. Steve wished he could stay this way forever, here in his bed with Tony. He’d been right. This did chase away all those ghosts – and everything else, but him and Tony.
“Why not?” Stark got to his feet and was a bit steadier than the sheriff. The two of them left the saloon arm in arm. They stumbled on their way into the street, but stayed upright because they were leaning on one another.
Nat raised an eyebrow but said nothing.
“I – no, no girl. I was a scrawny bookish kid. Didn’t really grow much until I joined the army.”
Tony laughed. “I like to get anything important done early in the day so I can drink the rest of the time.”
“OH you!”
Tony didn’t light the lamp as they fell into his bed, tugging and pulling at one another’s clothing until hot skin touched hot skin. They didn’t say anything either as their hands and mouths found things to explore, pleasure to bring to one another.
They went to the saloon for some food after they got back to town and took care of their horses. Steven noticed what a fine horse Tony had. His own was an army issue quarter horse and he’d ridden her since he’d come west. She suited him just fine.
The furniture was minimal. Sofa, television, coffee table and in the other room, a bed. The kitchen had several high-end coffee makers and one old fashioned stovetop percolator. The fridge was filled with snacks, beer, deli meats, convenient foods.
“So good,” Tony said. “I’ve imagined this more times than I can tell you.”
He palmed the already slick head of his cock to wet his hand, then slowly, oh so slowly, slid his hand down his length all the way, using his forefinger and thumb to make a tight ring around the base. He used his other hand to stroke as he closed his eyes and thought about Tony and how he looked.
There was a lot of speculation among the rest of the Avengers about those two anyway.  Bruce was sure they were just best buds. Thor didn’t care. He loved everyone. Nat thought they might be a thing and Clint was just as certain that they weren’t.
“I have, sir.”
“’Let’s be friends’ might have worked.”
“You know that S.H.I.E.L.D. built a Life Model Decoy of me, don’t you?” Tony asked Steve as he punched his sandbag style punching bag.
Tony looked angry for about two seconds then shook his head. “I don’t know why I put up with you sometimes,” he muttered as he went to work to fix the suit.
“I would not be opposed to – to sex with him.”
Steve nodded, looking like he might just give up and die right there in the street. He understood Natasha’s references to his puppy face now. He certainly had the urge to pet him. That wasn’t the only urge he had, though.
“I’d think listening to anyone sleep would bore you to death.”
“You know what I want, Tony.”
The next shave was done by his barber, who came by to cut his shaggy hair. Tony was looking more like himself but he was still a bit of a scarecrow, he thought as he looked at the haunted face in the mirror. He’d gained a few pounds and was eating mostly normal food now, though Rhodey was still making him drink those horrid protein shakes every day.
“I’d get up early to see you kick Robin Hood’s ass,” Tony joked.
the town drunk.
“I was born in New York. My mother’s name was Sarah and she was as Irish as they come.  My father died of a fever before I was born so Ma raised me by herself. She worked as a maid to one of those fancy families with a big house. I left home when I was seventeen to fight in the Civil War. My pal, Bucky, joined up, too. After the war, we drifted out here and I became sheriff and he was my deputy.”
Steve didn’t insult him by suggesting he push Tony’s wheelchair out of the bathroom. Instead, he nodded and left the room.
Steve nodded and they went to Tony’s penthouse. Tony made them both a cup of coffee in a maker of his own design.  He loved the stuff though he was pretty sure Steve might not be able to tell it from Mr. Coffee brew. Oh well, no matter.
He soaked up a cup of coffee and ate four aspirin. He’d felt worse. He headed up to the penthouse for a shower but first, he needed to check on Steve, see if he was okay.
Steve rolled Stark over and pressed him into the sofa. Somehow between kisses and groping one another, they managed to leave their clothing scattered all around the sofa
He smiled at Steve after he dried his face.
“Sorry about your friend, Rogers.” He sat down and looked at the sheriff. Tony lifted his bottle. “To Barnes.”
But neither of them ever forgot that first encounter.
Tony was already heading to the sink to wash his hands and change shirts. In a few minutes, the two men were getting off the elevator on the ground floor and heading across the street.
He dipped his head and caught Tony’s mouth in a soft kiss, a simple touching of their lips together. Tony tasted like whiskey and coffee, not unpleasant at all. Steve pulled him closer, pressing his body flush with Tony’s.
“I didn’t wake you. I’ve been here for more than an hour.”
Tony closed his eyes to keep those damned tears from coming back. “I loved you from the day we met. That hasn’t changed and never will.”
“Yeah,” Tony whispered as Steve slipped his mouth all the way down. “That’s it.”
“What’s wrong with my underwear?” Steve asked Tony.
“Steve!” Tony cried out as Steve took him into the back of his throat, breathing around his hard thrusts.
“Out to a coffeeshop?”
If JARVIS had a head, he’d have skaken it in disbelief.
On Monday morning of the next week, Steve asked him if he needed another shave. Tony knew he could do it himself now. He was out of the chair and didn’t shake so much, so he was as surprised as Steve was when he nodded. “I’d like that.”
They grabbed the tablet and headed to Tony’s bedroom.
Steve nodded miserably.
Tony decided to date and he went out with several starlets nearly young enough to be his daughter. They expected sex with a billionaire playboy and that’s what they got.
He went along, hauling Tony out and down the street to the smithy. When they got inside the door, Tony wrapped his arms around Steven’s neck and looked up into his eyes.
When the movie was over, they rode back to the Tower and Tony invited Steve up to the penthouse.
She looked surprised. “You’re serious? Do you think sending him porn is the way to make that happen? Why not ask him out?”
“What have you done?” she asked him.
“Yeah,” was all Steve answered as he began to ride Tony. He leaned over to kiss him as he moved. Tony had no choice but to meet his movements, not that he needed a choice.
The sheriff suppressed the urge to ruffle Stark’s unruly dark hair. “G’night, Tony,” he said and let himself out.
Tony turned back and Steve kissed him, a quick, awkward peck on the lips, but Tony’s heart almost beat out of his chest. “Uh, yeah.”
It was good. The food was delicious and plentiful, a prerequisite for Steve. The atmosphere was fun as well.
“Uh yeah, that would be me. Have we met before?”
“Then don’t tell him. Aggravating Barton is one of the joys of my life,” Tony told him. “Come over here and see what you think about this fabric for a new Cap suit,” he said to Steve.
“Do you touch yourself?” Tony realized his own voice was a low purr by now.
“Tell me about you, Sheriff. Who is Steven Rogers?’
He didn’t move as Steve stood and headed back toward the Tower. Steve turned his head and looked over his shoulder. “I am a fool. Are you going to show me how much of one I am or just stand there?”
An hour later, Tony was finally cooled down and dressed in dry clothes. He watched Steve dry his hair and come back to the bed. He hadn’t bothered with clothes yet. He loved the way Steve could be such a puritan one minute about using the word ‘fuck’ and walk around the penthouse a whole day completely naked and not think twice about it.
Tony still looked as debauched 	as he had when he came in. His lips were pink and swollen from kissing? Sucking cock? He had buttoned his shirt, though he mismatched the buttons and one side of his shirt tail still hung out. He looked wonderful to Steve.
“What’s this?”
As soon as Stark drifted off to sleep, the sheriff got dressed and hurried back to his little apartment over the jail. He washed the stickiness and the smell off and dropped into his bed. When he closed his eyes, he saw Tony’s face and heard the sounds Tony had made. It was a long time before he slept.
fault?” Tony asked.
There was quite a bit of tugging and pulling and soon, they were both down to underwear, Steve in his boxer briefs and Tony in Iron Man boxers and a black wifebeater.
He was as surprised as anyone when Steve finally asked him for a date.
“Yep. Pepper wanted me to get rid of the Arc Reactor.”
The shaving became a regular thing, for reasons that Tony couldn’t figure out. He was perfectly capable of shaving and had been doing so since before he had much to shave. Steve doing it for him was soothing and he could admit to himself (but no one else) how much he enjoyed spending those few quiet minutes with Steve every morning.
“You feel like the answer is no,” Tony told him, running his hand all the way down to Steve’s newly erect cock.
Over time, things changed.
The next morning after Steve showered, he opened his underwear drawer and chose a pair of Iron Man boxers from the ten identical ones beside them. He did love Tony.  He smiled and got dressed.  He’d already chosen his new boxers before Tony ever mentioned underwear at all.
Steven’s mouth went dry. “Why would you do that?” he finally asked.
Steve grinned and shrugged. “You are the sexiest man I’ve ever seen all warm and sweaty with your undershirt sticking to you and your cheeks all flushed.”
Tony waved his hand. “No bother. You served this country. You were not dead so they owe you. Pepper is good at what she does and if anyone can get you that backpay, she can do it.”
Steve bit his lip, nodded and left.
The sheriff went to the saloon for a bite to eat and to check on things just before the storm hit. He sat at the table he almost always sat at, looking over at the bar to see if Tony was there.
“Want me to trim your beard and mustache?” Steve asked.
“Maybe it’s malfunctioning.”
Several days later, they were in the bathroom again. Steve had just finished shaving Tony and he pulled the towel away. When Tony started to stand, he somehow tripped himself and Steve caught him in his arms, his strong, strong arms.
“Maybe, who you got in mind?” They were heading for Steve’s bike.
Stark was sitting at the bar drinking coffee when Sheriff Rogers arrived at 8am. He looked as Steven came in the door.
Steve pulled Tony close and kissed him. “How can I say no to your face in my pants?  Just for you, I’ll wear them. I’ve got the one pair.”
Tony hurried to catch up. “I guess I’m going to have to show you. Repeatedly.”
He hunted a polishing cloth that he knew was somewhere in his drawers and polished the little silver ring until it looked new again.
Steve thought Stark sure did feel warm tucked in close to his side.
“It’s dangerous for you to be here. Ross is looking for any excuse to send you to the Raft, or worse.”
“What’s up, Cap?” Tony asked when he was paying. The others had gone on ahead and Steve had offered Tony a ride back to the Tower on his bike.
“And crawling in the ventilation isn’t?” she asked with a grin.
He turned and left the room and Steve’s quarters before Steve could say anything. Steve slumped. What Tony had done to him was the most incredible thing he’d ever felt, but it wasn’t all he wanted. He’d known that along. That had been why he hadn’t tried to start anything before. Now he was just another blow job to Tony.
for him. At least he stayed sober part of the time, Steve thought to himself and smiled again. He really liked those sober nights a lot.
He was going to have fun with Captain Rogers…
“Tony, you missed the team meeting this morning,” Steve said by way of hello as he barged into the workshop around 1:30pm.
Steve happily complied.
The sky opened and the rain fell in torrents as the two men walked down the street, both getting soaked to the skin. They ran for the alley beside the smithy, hurrying to the overhang of the roof.
The second try was much like the first. They threw it out.
While the cake baked, the began to work on the icing. It came out beautifully and fluffy and oh, so chocolatey. Tony had put a blob of it on Steve’s nose and kissed it away. Steve became very distracted when Tony suggested he’d love to try licking the icing from another of Steve’s body parts, one that required a little undressing.
“You are a fool, Steve Rogers.” Tony finished his taco, wadded the paper up and stood. He walked to the nearest trash can and tossed it in.
The android Tony smiled at Steve. “So you’re Capsicle?”
Tony was exhausted and so was everyone else. Steve seemed even quieter than usual.
Tony found that he began to project his own distaste for his scar on Steve and he began to get angry, almost convincing himself that Steve would be shallow enough to leave him because of the scarring.
Everyone was eating popcorn and drinking sugary soda when the second Pirates of the Caribbean came on the huge screen in the rec room. They all yelled at the screen and did imitations of Jack Sparrow. Steve and Tony started whispering and elbowing one another.
“I – yeah, I’m okay.”
He watched Tony all night and saw that he didn’t drink nearly as much as he pretended that he did. Steven wasn’t even sure that he was drunk at all.
“Have you thought about me?” Tony asked.
“What’re you doin’?” Tony asked, though in truth, he didn’t seem too upset about it.
He saw Steve sitting at the table with his back to him when he opened the door. He backed up a step, debating turning around and going down the street to where there were usually a couple of food trucks. A taco might not kill him.
He didn’t realize how close Steve was until he spoke. “Sometimes listening to you makes me hard.”
“Oh okay, sure.”
It wasn’t even hot outside today and certainly not hot at the altitude he was flying. Yet here he was, wet of sweat from head to toe!
“I can’t imagine Aunt Peggy just falling in with you,” Tony laughed. “She must have been quite blunt.”
Tony nodded. “We all did.”
He’d hurried to his quarters and made a beeline to his bedroom and his tablet. He pulled up a folder of pictures of Tony. Some were paparazzi, some were pics he and the other Avengers had taken on their phones.
“That’s pretty devious.” He loved it.
Steve felt his face color again.
Tony had been sure that he was going to die in space. He still wasn’t completely convinced that it wasn’t going to happen here on earth. He could barely hold a spoon to eat the gruel that Rhodey insisted on until he was stronger.
Their gift to Peter, a teddy wearing a small Iron Man helmet is a huge success. Bucky had remembered Peter telling them that he’d lost his childhood teddy when he’d moved all his stuff from his aunt and uncle’s place into the tower. Peter’s eyes go wide as he sees the bear’s ears peaking out from the helmet; he tries to act all grown up as he thanks Steve and Bucky, but they both notice how the bear never leaves Peter’s side. The smile Tony gives them is worth everything, it’s small but full of warmth; he mouths ‘thank you’ at them as Peter sits the bear on his lap. The rest of the team hand over their own presents; Bruce’s is a hand built chemistry set (which clearly states that it is only to be used under his supervision), Natasha’s is a set of vintage Captain America comics, Clint gives Peter a nerf gun (he pulls out one for each of them with a wide grin). Peter thanks all of them profusely, he’s grinning and laughing with frosting from his cake smeared all over his mouth.
“Yeah, Pete, they have to make sure that you are okay; the only way to do that properly is to take some blood. Or, I supposed if we asked him really nicely, Bruce could come and do it; cause you trust Bruce, right?” Tony sighs, “Would you be okay with a blood test if Bruce did it?”
“Alright,” Steve says as he slams his shield into one of the lizard’s neck, “Iron Man I want you to get Hawkeye to the top of that building over there, Widow stick with me I want to use protocol one eight three nine. Bruce hang back we don’t need the green guy just yet. Thor, you can just do your thing. Flacon, can you assist Iron Man with air support.” He pauses glancing around the streets, the team shifts into action, they might joke about like kids when they can, but when it comes to the wire, Steve can count on them.
@stephup dadt was a terrible thing the army lost many good soldiers because of it it should never have happened i am glad that i could help in whatever small way if there is more that i can do all people have to do is let me know<<
“This okay, right?” Bucky pulls back, looking at Steve, “We’re okay, yeah?” One of Bucky’s hands is tangled in his hair, and the other is on his shoulder.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Fuck,” he gasps, putting a hand on the wall opposite him to steady himself, “fine, guess that’s you tellin’ me I need to go see the guy.” He mutters to his arm, it twinges again, the fingers moving in an uncontrolled spasm. “Okay, okay fine, I’m going in.”
Steve has never really felt so present in a moment, not since the serum, since the war, but for once he allows himself to be there when Tony reaches for his hand. A comforting presence, Tony’s warm calloused fingers seem to ground him, they hold him to the present. Bucky’s foot has somehow found his under the table, their feet are pressed up against each other. Steve notices that Bucky looks less tired than he has done in a long time. It is like some sort of invisible weight has been lifted from his shoulders, his hair is tied up in a loose bun and he’s wearing a ripped tank top and sweatpants, but Steve can't help but think that Bucky is beautiful. Tony is casting quick glances between the two of them, while he listens to Peter talk about his latest science project; Steve catches his eye, Tony winks which sends Steve into a fit of giggles. All thoughts of hatred and bigotry are gone from his mind replaced with thoughts of love and family, Steve has never felt so loved before, now though he feels full of it.

“And what happens when you’re captured by some lunatics? What happens when he becomes a target, you know he will. Tony, please, think about it before you leap headfirst into this. Having a kid is not a joke-“
“Right away, Captain,” JARVIS sounds warm and fond, it makes Steve smile more before he starts to stroke through Peter’s hair.
“I love you,” Steve whispers against his lips, “I love you so much. But, I need to know that you are one hundred percent with this because I couldn't stand it if I knew that whatever happened between Bucky and me was hurting you.”
“God,” Steve puts his head in his hand, his voice is croaky from disuse. “I haven’t asked about Peter, I’m sorry Tony. I’ve just been-“
“Tony I,” his voice comes out hoarse and croaky, it’s deep like he hasn’t spoken in weeks, “Tony, can I- Can I kiss you?” Tony lets out a huff of laughter, but he brings Steve’s face down to his, the hand that had been tracing Steve’s cheek is now fisted in the front of his shirt. Steve forgets how to think as their lips touch, the only thing that exists is Tony, the only thing he can feel is Tony. They stand there in Steve’s room, kissing for what feels like hours until Steve’s lungs are burning from lack of oxygen.
“We’re going to get the cleanup squad in; they’re going to bring May and Ben back to New York, while we go to the debrief; I’ll make it quick. Actually, I’ll do the debrief on the quinjet; Fury will have to deal with it.” Steve says, placing a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “Then you’re going to go home, and explain what happened to Peter, and you’re going to be there for your son.”
“That’s my boy,” Tony says proudly, smirking up at Bucky, “wrecked by a thirteen-year-old, new lows Barnes, new lows.” He shakes his head in mock disappointment; Bucky says nothing, choosing instead to saunter out the room with Steve hot on his heels.
“I am with this,” Tony nods, in a way he’s trying to convince himself, he just squashes the emotions down and smiles. He knows that this is going to be good, but there is a certain amount of trepidation that’s eating into his mind.
The remote alarm that’s always attached to each Avenger goes off at that moment; they look at each other once more before they pull away. Tony activates the bracelets even as he’s stepping out the car, the Iron Man suit covering him quickly, moving over his body like liquid. It only takes Steve a moment longer to suit up, before he’s joining Tony in the car park.
“Tony has PTSD, or he did have, after New York, Extremis, and Afghanistan, you know,” Steve pauses, “he’s recovering, but he still sometimes has panic attacks.”
“No, no, I’m fine. I’m not in pain.” Peter gasps, he shakes his head turning to Tony, “please, Dad, I can’t do that.”
“JARVIS, gimme options,” Tony asks as he dips and dives past the Hydra agents that had crowded around the warehouse.
“What happened to us?” Peter asks again, and now Tony knows that there is no running and hiding from this problem, not when it involves his son. Tony runs his hands through Peter’s hair, feeling the soft, clean strands underneath; he’s missed the feeling of holding his kid in his arms.
“You were singing,” Bucky asks raising an eyebrow, he’s looking at Tony strangely, Steve mentally traces the curve of his mouth, imagining what it would feel like to kiss it. He pulls the thought back quickly, he had been thinking that with Tony standing in front of him, he thinks Bucky can hear the small intake of breath but he elects to ignore it. “What song?”
“Bucky?” Steve looks at him, they’re still fighting the lizards, but Steve is completely focussed on his best friend.
“You can’t love two people at once, таша,” Bucky sighs sadly, fiddling with the pillow, rolling the tassels between the fingers of his metal hand.
“That was mean- Holy shit!,” Bucky breaks off as his phone starts to buzz with notifications, “I regret everything, I think my phone is broken. How many people are going to retweet that? Why are they following me, I don’t have anything interesting to say.”
“Jesus, I wasn’t kidding when I said we should attach bells to you,” Tony snorts, “you both move too quietly for your own good if I’d had one of my gauntlets on. Anyway, good to see you home, Robocop, I’ll need to take a look at your arm, now that you’re here; don’t even want to think about the damage it got hit within the last battle.”
