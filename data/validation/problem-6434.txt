Rhodes has exchanged the War Machine suit for casual wear and is now leaning against the wall on the other end of the room, barely engaging in conversation and silently staring off into one corner more often than not. His eyes are red-rimmed and his jaw clenched tight, and it seems to take everything in his power to not leave the room immediately when Tony's name falls. Steve understands.
fast. As they follow suit (albeit at a more measured pace), he mentions his observation to Tony, who promptly snickers.
All that tension strung so tight finally snaps when the piece of metal he’s been trying to attach breaks loose for the nth time, and he flings the unfinished construction across the room with an angry roar.
Anthony liked to talk. Whether he loved to hear his own voice or could simply not keep any one piece of information to himself was a mystery yet to be solved.
Tony sits down on the porch of the saloon, looking up at the stars in silence until the men inside finally have had enough and bury the hatchet.
Confused, he looks up from where he's been staring at Steve's dick, a tightly coiled knot of wanton anticipation in his gut wanting to see its length disappear inside him.
Minutes pass in silence. Tony's legs threaten to give in on his way from the corner to the bed. He makes it far enough to collapse on the edge of the mattress, gripping the sheets with clawed fingers for support and an outlet. Only when Tony has steadied his breathing does Steve slowly lower his arms.
The wrong Steve lays his palm over Tony’s heart, tilts his head and frowns a little. Feels it breaking, maybe, whether physically or the other way is hard to tell.
Tony gestures between them animatedly. "This," he clarifies. "Jumping me in the kitchen. Disappearing. Coming back and pretending nothing happened?"
want to the front. You want the engine. And I just so happen to be your only chance of getting there.”
“First of all, which year? Please don’t tell me it’s a number with nineteen in front,” Tony says, waving at Steve’s clothing. Right. The disguise.
Today, it was Ms. Potts who greeted him on his way to the workroom where he would typically meet with Anthony to put their most recent stroke of genius into practice.
“Young Miss did indeed beat her previous best time of 24.79 by 3.83 seconds. 20.96 seconds for a 550 foot distance traveled by an electrically driven miniature speedboat is a record thus far unchallenged, provided that the entries in the Guinness World Records at my disposal are valid and up-to-date.”
He feels sick, but there is no reason or time to embrace that feeling turning his stomach inside out. He knows how blood smells, how exposed meat looks, the way it feels looking at a bone knowing it isn’t supposed to be in a place you can see it.
Tony turns back around as the empty space starts filling with information. He folds his arms and leans against the table, regarding Steve with an expectant look. Steve isn't sure what he's supposed to say (doesn't even know where he'd start) so he mirrors Tony's stance instead.
Ever since Bruce had first taken up permanent residence in the Iron Castle, he would watch the Lord go out on rides into the deep woods and lush plains of Mar'vill every fortnight only to return with various aches he frequently and vocally complained about in his physician's presence.
The street lantern on the main road behind Steve throws his shadow on the rain-slick ground in front of him, a long and misshapen copy of himself. Stark’s just there at the head of it, give or take twenty feet away.
usually reserved for when he's 53 hours into a workshop binge and his neurons are firing a million miliamperes per second and his eyes are bloodshot and his smile is manic because
Tony wonders if he’ll die like this; spend his final moments trying to think of a way to make them last after all.
Steve, on account of not knowing what else to say or do, pulls him in close and tucks Tony's head under his chin, hands rubbing up his back. (Or maybe he's doing it just so Tony won't see him squeeze his eyes shut and breathe deeply so he won't sob in relief.)
Stark goes on to say that they should execute the maneuver as planned but send someone in there with him to get to the control panel that lies underneath the floor plating right past the first gate – they just need to make sure he gets there and rewires some of the switches to deactivate remote control of the doors, and voilá.
No answer seems to be answer enough for him, because he takes on a more defensive stance, crossing his arms over his chest as he steps a few feet away from the table and the holograms.
He's on the floor, breathing heavily, braced on his forearms. Except, the floor isn't concrete anymore; it's turned soft and slightly damp. Something tickles his nose, and Steve moves his head to the right only to be met with the same sensation again.
The image would be amusing to witness if their situation wasn't what it's turned out to be, because the Skull's every word makes it painfully obvious that he's long transcended the state of being that once earned him Captain America's righteous fury. Steve, on the other hand, is still coming to terms with that reality.
It's a quiet but beautiful procession. He'll see to it that Natasha gets something like this, too. There might not be a body, but they'll honor her and her sacrifice just as they did Tony's.
The axe slams into the chopping block yet again. This time, Rogers leaves it there in the wood and straightens, turning to face Tony.
Come the next page, the human shapes are replaced by drawings of landscapes and animals. There are snow-clad mountains that look similar to those around them, a lake covered in ice, paw prints embedded in the snow on top of it. A swarm of snow geese and a single moose, its mighty antlers held high.
In a lethal choreography that has become familiar to them throughout the hundreds of times they’ve practiced and perfected it, they’re slashing their way through the hungry mob of clawing fingers, rotten flesh and menacingly clacking teeth. The latter is what he dreads most, the clatter of bone upon bone a spine-chilling sound that will get his blood running cold and his body crowding closer against Tony’s in an immediate, Pavlovian response.
Steve blanks. He never questioned the nature of the sender – sure, there was some curiosity, but at the end of the day, they had someone at the front end who was on their side, and he never meant to look a gift horse in the mouth. The messages came irregularly, but when they did, the information and tools hidden in the rations they were handed always proved useful.
There's a second where he wants to rip Stark's throat out. He knows he can; he's done it before, to alphas bigger in size with thrice his temper. But Bucky's scent spikes in a way that's a warning, and his face that is in Steve's peripheral vision looks steely and dangerous, and Steve remembers himself.
Rogers' eyes widen a fraction when he notices him leaning in, but Tony forgets about it as soon as their lips meet.
He drags in a shaky breath to stave off the sob that threatens to escape him. This is messy. It's too much. This whole everything, it's all just, all over the place, and he needs something–he needs–
Stark is half-hard when Steve takes him in hand, and his cheek is visibly torn open as he jerkily shakes his head and moans “no”, the first time he's uttered anything even close to a plea.
Hm. And here he assumed he knew everything there's to know. Strange, how even after all this time – is it really their ninth anniversary this year?
He waits, expecting something else, but Nebula doesn’t react, doesn’t even spare him a glance. Tony decides not to look a gift horse in the mouth, and eats.
to himself when he should have, never quite keeping the distance Tony asked him to in the beginning and both of them suffering for it. Steve landed them here, in the aftermath of this kiss that Tony wishes he hadn't initiated and Steve wishes he didn't want again.
"I always believed you deserved a happy ending, but it was–almost impossible to get it right without
He's entirely unclothed, his all layers abandoned at the foot of the mattress. His skin is flushed and glistening with sweat, erection having taken on a purplish color and curving against his stomach. One of his hands is shoved between his legs and the other in his face, clamped between his teeth to keep the noise at bay. His hair sticks to his forehead and doesn't even stir when he whips his head around, gaze frantic until he determines who's just invaded his privacy.
With little else to do, Steve blindly grabs a book off one of the shelves and settles into the armchair next to them. He discovers that he picked a 101 on electrical engineering; he can’t make sense of the majority of passages he skims through (doesn't really make an effort to), so his thoughts drift off soon enough.
"Devotion," Tony blurts, suddenly. He hasn't meant to say it and doesn't know where the thought comes from. "The seventh stone. It's devotion."
Steve chuckles, a warm sound that goes right to Tony’s heart and makes a home for itself there. A hand comes up to brush the wayward strands of hair out of his vision and then winds around his waist alongside the other one, neverminding the fact that he’s messy with his own come.
Steve aches to undress him fully, look upon all that olive skin and count the places where it’s marred with scars and penetrated by metal, but there’s no time for thorough exploration. He pushes Stark’s pants down to his knees and his shirt up his back; his spine reveals itself as a long, iron snake coiling from his neck over the slope of his back to the crack separating the swell of his ass.
The security gate opens for today’s issuing of rations, a couple of guards setting foot in the wagon as they roll the food cart in. Only that nobody will get any rations today. All they’ll get today is blood, and hopefully, salvation – by whatever means.
He shrugs. "Anyway. I don't have any desire to play the bad guy here and it's not like we don't have the space, so you can stay for now. We're still gonna check in with Fury and see if we can do anything about your situation, but yeah. For what it's worth, you won't be going back to SHIELD, long as you don't want to."
Tony swallows, gaze dancing around the room until he seems to finally force himself to look at Steve. There’s an abundance of emotion in his expression, apprehension and indecision and
Suit of armor around the world. 'Tony, we’re leaving the scepter alone, that’s a team decision.' 'Tony, you know it wouldn’t have been worth the risk.' I’m not hearing any of that now, am I?”
Spring in Italy comes with pleasant warmth: the days are slow, the weather is magnificent and his company–Steve and then
Natasha had trouble keeping her fingers off the daggers in her waistbelt after having first encountered the man.
Steve shrugs as much as he's able to, lying there. "That was never proven. Besides, it was fun. For you, mostly."
All the years which his mother spent with young Anthony, James was there, watching curiously and soon deciding that he would never cease to watch out for the small, doe-eyed boy in the crib.
Over the back of the couch, Tony's gaze meets his. It's sad, but there's something else beneath that wistful glaze that is a little less somber. A touch of gratefulness, even.
Tony heaves himself into a sitting position, and it now dawns on him where exactly he’s landed: just on the riverbank, his backside soaking wet. Lady Luck seems to enjoy playing him for a fool today. He studies the injured foot, wincing in pain with every touch. It hurts like hell, but isn’t broken – he knows how a broken bone feels, and this isn’t it.
After seventeen minutes, noises from the hallway announce Tony’s return, and after eighteen, the other man joins him, sitting down on the other end of the couch.
Then, he sits back down and gives four successive knocks to his desk. Tony, stretched out on the chaise longue in front of the windowed wall, twitches but ultimately doesn't move. Instead, he buries deeper into the heap of furs he's wrapped himself in–Steve doesn't always like it but he has to admit he gets more done when his gaze doesn't get drawn to Tony's naked skin after every other page.
He’s pulled down for another kiss by a hand in his hair. It’s a little uncoordinated; they meet with noses and teeth colliding but refuse to separate. When they do eventually part, Steve stays there, half bent over Tony to lean his forehead against the other man’s, watching Tony’s eyes crinkle with a mischievous smile. The next moment, he gives Steve’s dick a provocative squeeze and
Steve, suddenly aware of how in the way he is, forces himself back onto his feet. He's still not entirely steady, his head light and his chest hurting, but he steps aside when the others pass, following Rhodey as he walks and carries Tony through the rows of heroes still on one knee to honor the fallen Avenger.
Might be some part of his subconscious thinks itself safe now that he's finally not a bachelor in his forties anymore, even though Tony as a whole should know better and no cubic inch of his being should fall for these kinds of pretenses. It isn't safe;
"You got it, sweetheart," Steve says. They moan in unison when he grazes Tony's prostate again and Tony, in turn, clenches up from this sensation that's right in the wondrous territory of too much, too good. "Let me hear more."
The sounds of battle fade with their enemy, screams and shouts and metal against metal dying as they do. Steve looks around him, jovial,
Tony smirks into the pillow when he feels Steve’s erection press against the small of his back, a line of heat that brings the promise of a good time. He bows his back a little, lets his head roll onto Steve’s shoulder and groans appreciatively when Steve leans down to suck a mark into his exposed throat.
"Don't mention it," Tony says, disappearing on the other side of the door as he pulls it close gently.
There’s rust on the blade, he knows this. Water is no antiseptic, he knows this too. The rags he has with him will barely staunch the worst of the bleeding, he knows this as well. And what he is going to do to Tony, he might never be forgiven for. But he’s going to take that chance happily. A Tony who is furious with him for what he’s done for the rest of his life is better than a Tony whose remaining lifetime is measured in hours. (Can’t win the russian roulette if you don’t give it a shot at all.)
"Don't make me ask, sweetheart," Steve warns. He thumbs the little device in his left pocket. Tony knows perfectly well what happens when he has to ask.
Tony squints, observing the man over the rim of his glass as he makes his way to the bar. He leans against the counter a few feet away, ordering a beer, completely oblivious to Tony's stare. It's undoubtedly the traveller he's noticed last night; the same hat, the same bright hair, the same tall build.
Before Tony can bring himself to choke out an answer, the Skull cuts in, "The Soul Stone's powers are far beyond the comprehension of the mortal mind. It cannot prove its veracity to you, but rest assured it will abide by its everlasting promise. A soul for a soul."
And with a glance at his still-flat stomach under the hospital gown and grief breaking out of him with violent sobs, he knows this much: There will be plenty more to come.
Natalia busied herself with the dissection of the overcooked piece of meat on her plate to drown out the sheer bloodlust that overcame her. It would be all too easy to throw her dagger across the table into Hammer's throat; the fool had no idea the sole reason for his continued survival was the unequaled self-control she possessed.
"You can admit it, you know? It worked. You'd have never made that shot if I hadn't been there playing well-lit bait."
Steve swallows hard. What’s he supposed to say? What’s he supposed to do? He doesn't have any experience with children in general, so how in the world can he be expected to know what to do about this little girl whose eyes are nothing short of a facsimile of his own?
and a ragtag group of equally irritating aliens. Strange says, “one way”, and nobody would've backed out anyway, but this seals the deal.
That’s fine. Steve gets back at him by delivering a slap to his naked butt that sounds like it stings.
The man falls to his knees like a puppet with no strings attached, fingers twitching, eyes wide and lips agape in a silent scream. His mouth opens and closes like a fish out of water, and when his trembling hands come up to clutch frantically at his chest and throat, the metaphor becomes reality.
To keep him from stirring, Steve holds him to his chest with one arm while he reaches up and out of the space of the bunk with the other. The search proves fruitless at first, before his hand finally comes in contact with what he’s looking for – his coat, hanging abandoned over the ladder outside. Steve pulls it back inside and lays it out over them; he feels the sweat itch as it cools on himself and, while Stark might not notice it, it’s likely to affect his body even more, naked as he is. He wants to avoid either of them catching a cold if at all possible.
"We scared them off is what matters, or not? I don't know about you, but I for one am looking forward to getting some shut-eye again."
But there is more, he can tell by the tone, so he remains silent. Everything he can do is listen, for once, after he has failed to do so before.
They settle into a slow, almost gentle rhythm. Usually, they find themselves on the other end of that spectrum, both too impatient to slow down. Tony also has an easier time getting off when Steve's using all that super-soldier stamina and coordination to jackhammer him into the mattress (or other inanimate objects) until he's guaranteed to be too sore to walk, but this is surprisingly nice.
There's a second of absolute stillness in which neither of them blinks, Tony's hands on his chest a point of contact that sets his skin aflame even through the shirt. But it only lasts so long, and after Tony has squeezed his eyes shut, his gaze is frantic when he opens them again.
She stayed positioned at the armory until two pairs of feet approached from behind; then, the master-at-arms strode back inside, amicably greeting the men she'd caught in the act without their knowledge. Anthony's burgundy vest seemed to have been buttoned the wrong way, but she knew better than to stare or waste a word on it.
Later, Tony won't be sure if he imagined it, but he thinks he feels something zipping past his cheek and it causes him to flinch. All hell breaks loose in the fraction of a second – there's a bark, a wounded whine, and a hoard of lowing cattle storms past him, luckily parting around him as they do.
But Steve has no intention of hurting Tony like this, today. He just wants to make it good. It is the morning of a fateful day, after all.
Tony catches sight of his husband’s dropped jaw and joins him by the punch bowl to investigate. He gives Steve a peck on the corner of his mouth and leans his body against him. “What’s the gossip soldier boy?”
It never really used to bother Steve that they were always hounded by photographers. Yeah he didn’t enjoy it but with the USO show, then coming back from the dead, THEN going out with Tony he had gotten used to it. They were following him because of all the choices he had made. But now they had Mari and it annoyed him that he couldn’t just go to the park or the zoo with her without having a camera shoved in his face. Or her’s. The media seemed fascinated with the little orphan girl that was adopted by the gay supers. They’d already had to pay for three cameras because photographers had come up to Mari on the playground and outside the building she went to therapy at and started taking pictures and demanding answers. Like what it was like to be adopted by Captain America and Ironman and if she was scared the bad guys would ever come for her. That last one had sent her into a panicked mess and Steve had nearly hurdled the man through a wall. Pepper was good about getting restraining orders but when you could only file them against individuals and not the whole damn mob that made things slow going. They tried to avoid it all together and keep as low a profile a possible.
“Compromise where you can but if you find you can’t then when people tell you to move even if it’s the whole world, I want you to plant your roots like a tree and say, ‘No! You move’. You hold your ground and stand tall.”
“Maybe you’d have less paper work if you stopped using top secret new tech as target practice.” Bruce arches an eyebrow at him.
“Yeah. These cultures had some unexpected results and I want to examine them before I loose any data.” Bruce turns to a notebook and scribbles down a couple notes.
“None taken?” Bucky frowns down at his beer. He really wished he could get drunk right now. “Why hasn’t she told me?”
“You’re lucky little one,” the deep raspy voice hisses. “It seems I have to leave you now. But know this, if you tell anyone about me I’ll rip you limb from limb. Slowly.”
Steve tries to fight down his smile as Bruce groans and says, “Somebody is trying to kill you Tony.”
Tony scrunches his face up in thought for a moment before twisting into a wicked smirk. “Depends. After running around New York all day, you still have enough energy to pound me into the mattress?” He pushes his hips forward so Steve can feel his stiffening cock.
Bruce leads him out the door but before it closes Tony turns back to look over at Steve and Mari. Steve gives him a thumbs up and nods. With that, he lets the door close. Steve turns back to Mari and rubs her back.
“Wait a minute,” Tony turns to Mari and sets the dishes and folder aside. “Did you sneak on the Gorgon Files?”
Mari liked Aunt Peggy. She was nice and had lots of stories tell. Not all of them were grand epics. Most were about the silly things her friends and her did between missions or when Steve and her reconnected after the ice. The ones that were about their deeds though, seemed too grand to be real. “Wooooooow. That really happened?”
“Whatever gets you here I guess. Trust me, it may not sound like it’ll do you much good but these sessions really do help.”
He aimed a little further up the soldier’s path and fired the arrow. Hearing the whistle of the arrow Bucky turns down another road at the last second to avoid the blast. Clint nocked a few more arrows blocking any roads he might turn down. He sent one last arrow in between a dumpster and the wall sending it careening out into Barnes’ path. Barnes turns down one last alley. Natasha swings out the other side and Clint dives down to block the only other exit. He comes down to ground level just in time to see an unmanned motorcycle roll past Natasha.
He sits down next to her and drums his fingers against the table top. An awkward silence hangs in the air as the billionaire glances around. His eyes land on the activity book that had been in the file the social worker gave them. Her psychiatrist insisted that she fill it out before her next visit. He had yet to meet the good doctor but her first appointment since the adoption was tomorrow. Yet another thing he felt inept at dealing with. Tony frowns when he actually looks at the page Mari is working on. Along the top was a prompt that reads, “Draw what scares you”. Underneath was a large box where Mari had drawn her open closet. In the doorway was a large black monster with huge white eyes, long claws tipped in red, and a toothy grin that stretches across its face.
Tony’s body gives a violent jerk and he falls out of his chair and onto the hard floor of his lab. He groans and rolls onto his back. He runs his hand over his face, grimacing at the feel of being drenched in sweat.
They tangle their limbs together under the sheets as they fall asleep. It only feels like he’s just drifted off when Steve’s eyes are blinking open. He looks over at the clock on the bedside table. There were still a couple hours left before he had to get up. A groan and a jerk against his back lets him know what woke him up. He rolls over and sees Tony clutching to a pillow. Steve wraps an arm around him and pulls him close. Tony is warm to the touch and whimpers.
“There was a reason for that.” Tony jerks his head toward Steve who is frowning and holding a trembling Mari.
Instead of the AI’s voice, he is answered with a garbled, distorted mess. Tony and Pepper share a confused look as he pulls out his phone and brings up Jarvis’ satellite uplink.
Tony goes back to washing the suds off his body with a smirk. “Pretty sound reasoning if you ask me.”
“Yes, but Dr. Krevin has made leaps and bounds with her. I know she’s not particularly fond of him but they have a rapport. When Mari first came to us she was uncontrollable, she barely spoke, and when she did it was ranting and raving. Dr. Krevin has really gotten her to unwind and deal with her trauma. He even got her to accept that this closet monster was just her way of coping with what happened. But being around...extraordinary folks like yourselves, where a monster attack is more likely, well, I think this has caused Mari to revert back to her old coping mechanisms.”
When her tiny arms wrap around his neck he wraps her in a tight hug in return. “Yeah I am. Now you said something about being scared?”
The doctor returns the bow and says with a smile, “You’re a medical marvel Mr. Stark. Believe me, it is not a hardship. Especially when I am coming here on one of your wonderful jets.”
Mari makes a small gasp. “I’ve always wanted to know, what are your wings made of? Is it some sort of micro-carbon fiber? Or titanium? And how is your suit powered? Do you use fuel or is it a self-sustaining energy source?”
“Hey!” Tony says as he gets off the weight machine and comes over to them. He reaches out to take Mari. “Did you enjoy your time at the-what happened!?!”
Steve’s shoulders slump. How could he not have seen this? He had been running around all day looking for the man that had inadvertently taken so much from Tony and his husband had been worrying himself into a fit about whether it would be Bucky or the Winter Soldier he found. That maybe this was the one time he didn’t come home. He walks over and pulls Tony up by his arms.
“Don’t worry, she looks at all the new comers like that. She’s just trying to work you out.” Steve leads him towards the door. “And her name’s Natasha. We just call her Nat though.”
The social worker sighs. “I’m not here to make your life miserable hon. I’m just trying to make sure you’re happy and healthy.”
Tony gives the box a shake. “For a guy who can turn into a green, eight foot, rage monster, I wouldn’t have guessed he was afraid of a five year old.”
She chuckles. “On occasion but I mostly found shooting them to be more effective. I doubt your father wants you to hear about those kinds of stories though. How about I regale you a tale about Steve’s first attempt at dancing?”
Steve’s head shoots up and he glances at Fury before he meets Tony’s eyes. Tony reaches over and lays his hand over Steve’s, giving it a gentle squeeze. Anything involving the super soldier serum seemed to always go to shit for those involved and Steve never could explain the feeling of guilt that came with it.
“No!” Nefaria shouts as Cap drags him away from the machine. “Impossible! What have you done to my creations!”
“Sam!” Steve shoots him a frown and motions towards Mari who is sitting at the head of the table with her head laying on its surface.
“Weeeell, you know what they say, while the cat’s away the mice will play.” He comes over and looks over her shoulder. “So what are the mice doing?”
“So let me get this straight. You think Mari is the love child of a super spy and an evil scientist and may have been trained to infiltrate our family?” The smile on his face slips away as Tony stays quiet. “Tony?”
When she leaves Steve turns back to Sam and Bucky who are trying to clean the worst of it off themselves. “Guys, I know you didn’t sign up for this whole kid thing but I need you to be on your best behavior when she’s around. She looks to the adults in her life to learn how she should act, how she should treat others. How she should expect to be treated. We are her examples. She’s learning from us. You never know what she might pick up.”
Dr. Wu’s smile grows wider and he turns to his assistant, speaking in Chinese. The assistant stares at him confused before the doctor points to a tray with five syringes on it. The assistant nods and rolls the tray over. Dr. Wu removes a syringe and examines it. He turns to Tony.
“Mari, enough. That’s not nice,” Steve scolds as he picks up his pace to hold the door open for the medic. Steve reads her badge as she passes, Callaghan. They walk up the stairs to the medical wing. Luckily it was only five floors up so Steve did not have to resort to zip lining.
“No. Absolutely not. I’m not shipping her off to some boarding school where we only get to see her at holidays and summer break.”
Tony sighs. “There’s a lever.” He grabs the bottle and kneels down, turning his back to her. He stands up again after she jumps onto his back. “All aboard the billionaire express. Next stop, electrical maintenance hatch.”
Tony looked up from his phone. Dr. Krevin was standing by the door to his office with his hands clasped behind his back and an over extended smile.
Steve’s in a uniform that looks like it hasn’t been in the wash or patched up in a hot minute. There’s a smudge of dirt across his clean-shaven cheek. His expression, though mostly smooth and neutral, says he feels put out about something or other. And his voice, now that Tony replays the words in his head, sounded more piqued than playful.
He becomes slower. The fatigue settles in his bones like lead, and yet he’s too agitated to sleep at the same time. As the days go by, a never-ending headache comes to life and pounds behind his temples. He’s unsteady on his feet. He walks with a bit of a sway and learns to regret collapsing into his seat when his head ends up spinning with the rapid movement.
He isn't, but he sees the sharp glint of self-deprecation in Tony’s eyes anyway, and grasps his hand that has formed a fist laying on the mattress in front of him. Tony doesn’t find a reason to resist, so he lets Steve’s palm cover the back of his hand and guide it up to lay over his chest–right there above his heart.
The stains on Steve’s grey sweatshirt are the same color as the wild roses growing in the front yard of the family home they’ve been camping out in for months now. Splotches of vibrant red on a drab canvas. Only the stains aren’t stains anymore; the front and the sleeves are virtually drenched in blood, most of it Tony’s but some his own.
Nebula is rarely in the same part of the ship, withdrawing except during the rare times she brings over another cup of water that Tony longs for so profoundly. There are no more games; those had been a bonding exercise and a distraction first, but at some point devolved into a waste of energy.
Everything goes more or less smoothly. He encounters a slight hiccup here and there, what with the Red Skull on Vormir and the guards on Asgard almost catching him red-handed, but other than that, it's a fairly easy game. The power stone goes back to Morag, the time stone to the Ancient One and the Scepter back to the tower, and then the only one that's left is the Tesseract.
Because there’s Tony, and he’s now frantically scrubbing his forearm as he pours water over it in excessive quantities.
Rogers' already palpable suspicion doesn't intensify. Instead, his stance in the saddle seems to loosen, and he nods at Tony as if they have come to some kind of understanding. He doesn't answer and his gaze is fixed on the cabin in the distance, and Tony has no clue what in the world just happened, but he'll take it. Rather that than having the man think he's a criminal on the loose – not that there's much difference there from a moral perspective, but the man doesn't know that.
Above him, Steve smiles. The claws of the device hug the reactor, and the voice that comes out of his mouth is Obadiah's, "The golden goose had one more egg to give."
His eyelids fluttered shut with a few, rapid blinks and his mouth fell open in a long-drawn, breathy groan as he bottomed out,
Fury's office is as expansive as the one Steve was familiar with in his world. The great glass panes behind the desk allow for an almost picturesque view of the city in the back – a view that is disturbed only by the countenance of one Director Nick Fury, whose expression turns to one of displeasure as he notices Steve's increasing absentmindedness.
and although Steve wasn't watching, he could see that was Nat's doing in his peripheral vision. And peace was restored.
and how is that anywhere near the truth? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, yadda yadda, but that doesn't make it make
underneath, curbed only by the drugs in his system and the knowledge that any attempt to flee won't bear fruit.
Tony finds himself not wanting to move from his spot on the side of the road outside the saloon, freezing and hurting yet he may be. The town is cloaked in shadows all but for the building behind him, and the stars shine differently out here.
The one time the physician looked up from his work to ensure his patient was still faring comparatively well, the man had taken hold of Sir Rogers' hand and was digging clawed fingers into his skin with a strain that turned his knuckles white.
Time isn’t, because Earth comes into view in what could only have been hours. It’s unreal. This blue, blue planet is the most beautiful sight Tony has ever had the fortune of laying his eyes on.
"The sayin' does go 'curiosity killed the cat', so you might be onto somethin' there," the man returns, and although he does a good enough job at painting over it with practiced indifference, there's still the hint of a smirk there.
For another, there was the Captain, whom Bruce had not yet entirely figured out. Most interesting were the times he crossed paths with the man after he had just returned from his rides with the Lord – he was almost jovial, greeted every woman and man in the castle with an easy smile and was never to be found with the customary frown or scowl that on other days so often graced his hardened features.
Steve's posture loses some of its tension as he turns toward Tony, frown hardening his features. "How is this sacrificial ritual supposed to work? We know the Stone's not here
Tony uses this occasion to declare their conversation over, rubbing both hands over his face. He's had five cups of coffee in this past hour that they’ve gone over every minute detail in their timelines, finding most things unrelated to the Ultron event matching. He hasn’t forgotten about Tony’s fleeting mention of Extremis the day before, but it’s yet another topic the man only touches upon very briefly. It’s clear as day there’s a story there – one that, by all accounts, Tony doesn’t plan on telling.
There’s the hint of a growl in his voice and Tony falls silent within an instant. Loathing prickles underneath his skin, scorching hot. If there’s one thing he’s sworn to himself he'd never do, it’s shut his mouth at some old bastard’s command who thinks the α on his birth certificate puts him above Tony by default.
minute takers make off, the tablet they punched all the information he provided them into leaving in the woman's hands, while the remaining agent stays positioned at the door.
Steve tries not to be that hopelessly pessimistic most of the time. Really, they manage well, for the better part. The wounds, for all that they are still fresh and ever-present, don't sting unless they accidentally happen to press right on them.
He doesn't mean to, really, but it's only so long until rehashing every minor detail of your past and present existence will start to get on your nerves. The things he hoped to get an answer to were more or less brushed off by the man in the beginning – they'll consider retrieving the Tesseract, yes, but since the odds that it'll take him back where he came from are little to none, it might end up being too great of a risk to take for such a small chance of pay-off.
Stark holds up a rather unassuming packet of cloth to present it to Steve’s critical gaze. It’s tied together at the top with what appears to be a braided string of threads extracted from his shirt, one frayed end dangling at the side of it.
The conqueror had fought his way into the kingdom’s heartland, Klynn its name, when Lord Anthony finished all the preparations needed to mobilize roughly three quarters of the entirety of Mar’vill’s Iron Guard, leaving only a small portion to keep order within.
There, another trademarked Tony Stark trait. Rambling when antsy. The lines are very much blurring. Steve shouldn't have such a hard time reminding himself of the fact that that doesn't change anything about who they are (and, more importantly, aren't) to each other, but– There's no 'but'. He shouldn't.
Steve will try to feign normalcy one moment and then turn around and start arguing about how they should talk to the team, a discussion which Tony consequently shuts down each time or doesn't even entertain. Contrary to what Steve seems to believe, he knows the smart thing would be to let them know. The more dignified solution however is this, and Tony isn't ready to get over himself yet.
He heads over to the joined kitchen, taking two glasses out of an overhead cabinet. Something soft and yearning blooms within Steve as he watches him get up on his tiptoes to reach them, but looks away when he catches himself in the act.
“Hi,” Tony says. He looks off to the side, seemingly in thought, before his gaze shifts back to Steve. The more details he takes in, there more obvious it gets that something’s off. There’s a distinct frown in Tony’s features, and his eyes are wide and glassy for a reason Steve has yet to find out.
The realization that there is nothing to do but sit and wait for time to pass comes with a certain amount of terror, at least for him. Rogers has been aware of the intricacies of this job from the beginning, and he takes the monotony of their existence in stride. Every day anew, he’ll come barreling down the stairs (Tony is
Steve blinks. Sure, he considered it, but he didn't think– Fact is, he's gone through a fair share of invasive medical exams in his time, and this being a possibility is something the scientists never brought up. Hence he figured there was nothing out of the ordinary with… well.
Tony knows what's coming, but the sound of the second shot still causes him to wince. Without another look at him or the carcass, Rogers heads back to camp.
His resolve to wait even another second breaks right then. Steve guides himself in-between Stark's cheeks, another gush of liquid greeting his cockhead as it pushes against the fluttering muscle of his opening.
“Hey! Get off of there!” He runs back over and yanks her from the computer throwing her back into the glass wall. She yelps and curls into a ball as he yells, “Shit, shit, SHIT! What did you do!?!” The man jerks his head up in response to something she can’t hear. “He’s coming NOW!?! Why-” He turns and pins Mari with a glare. His eyes land on the band around her wrist. He kneels down and jerks her arm forward. He sees the red Ironman icon on the display. “Damn it. You little…how do you get this thing off?”
“The nerve center is through here,” says Steve as he nods towards the door that the others are entering.
“Please Mari. I know it’s a big drop but you can make the jump. Trust me. I’ve seen you hyped up on sugar. You can make this, easy.”
Tony chuckles as he puts the slush mix back in the freezer when Nat asks, “Wait. You’re a billionaire. What do you need the money for?”
“How many friends did you have when you were young? Not the Commandos and Peggy. I mean when you were a kid.”
Steve sighs and the tension leaves his shoulders. “I’m sorry Clint. Today just needs to go perfectly.”
“It’ll probably involve blowing up shit and shooting bad guys,” Clint says in a sing-song voice. “Some of which may be some form of Nazis.”
Bucky’s brow scrunches up at that. Was it? He could have sworn it was Natalia. Oh well, what did he know? His brain had been put through the blender more times than he could count. Steve led him through the door and Natasha followed after. They walk up to a large holotable and Clint brings up a map.
“Of course! Food, hotties, kids I can sneak toys to to annoy their parents, i.e. Jeffory from accounting, it’s a blast.” Clint pops a hors d’oeuvre into his mouth from a platter he has balanced on the railing.
"Since you're busy I can come back another time to talk about it -," Steve said, worried that he had overstepped. He should have just told him that he had finished it when all of the Avengers and them ate dinner together.
When he was clean and dressed in sweatpants and a t-shirt, Steve checked his phone again. A message was waiting for him.
“What I’m saying is…you don’t need to do anything. You keep doing whatever you doing. But you also wait and see – maybe Tony will come around.”
A home. That’s what Tony had given him. When he came out of the ice, he had been so lost. He hadn't had any friends. He hadn't had anywhere to really call “home”, but Tony tried to make him more comfortable; he invited him to the Avengers facility and helped teach him more about this century. Sure, their relationship hadn’t always been ‘great’, but Tony still helped him feel more at ease, more welcomed in this century. It was surprising, really, how much their relationship had grown considering how they started out. When he had first joined the Avengers, Tony and him didn’t see eye to eye at all. Steve thought that he was arrogant and selfish. After the battle in New York, though…well, he realized that he was wrong. Tony was so much more than he had originally thought; he was kind, selfless, caring. Sure, knowing that didn’t stop them from bickering, but they at least understood where the other was coming from. They tried to listen to each other, learn from each other. Through the years, Tony had quickly become one of his closest friends, if not his closest friend.
Steve blushed crimson. He tried to come up with some sort of retort, but he couldn’t think of anything. Bucky smirked at him and left the living room, going into his own bedroom. He shut the door behind him. Sighing, Steve went back to his cleaning, wanting to make the place look spotless for Tony. A part of Steve thought that if he could impress Tony tonight, perhaps all of his worry about him not liking him later on would disappear.
A few minutes later, his feet pounded against the sidewalk; the sound was comforting. It was something cement, solid. Something that kept his thoughts from wandering too far. He sucked in a breath as he turned the corner, moving towards a small park. At this time of day, the park was full of kids and families. Steve stuck to the path that cut through the middle so that way they didn’t have to worry about him accidentally crashing into them. Which, wouldn’t happen, nor did Steve ever do something like that. That’s what he liked to tell himself, anyways. One time, when he was just out of the ice, he didn’t realize how busy these parks could get, and this man seemed to come out of nowhere and he almost ran into him. The guy yelled at him for almost running into him. Steve had apologized to the guy, but he hadn’t seemed to care.
“But on the other hand,” Bucky continued, cutting him off. “I want to congratulate on finally realizing this.”
He took a step closer to him and placed a hand on his shoulder. Steve’s gaze flicked from Tony’s hand to Tony. The man was standing so close, he could smell his cologne. Steve looked down at the floor, worried that if he looked up, he'd do something stupid.
. Smiling to himself, Steve entered the room. He didn't get very far before pausing, his eyes widening at the interior of the room. Along the walls were white columns of granite that met crown molding that had a diamond pattern engraved in it. The ceiling was painted white; three chandeliers hung from the ceiling, casting a soft glow to the room. In the center of the room were round tables that some people sat at; others stood around them, talking to the people next to them. On the opposite side of the room, there appeared to be a small stage that had a podium on it. The room was, in short, beautiful. Nothing like Steve had ever seen before.
thinking too much about this. All Tony did was invite him to the event. He probably invited him because he wanted Steve to support him. Steve still had reservations about going, but he could definitely go to show his support.
Steve couldn't return the smile. He wanted to, but he couldn't. This wasn't the way it was supposed to go. He wanted to kick himself for feeling this way. All he wanted was to kiss Tony again, to forget the way he was feeling. But, he couldn't do that. Not when the beginning of their conversation kept replaying in his mind. Not after Tony took out how he was feeling on him. He wasn't mad at Tony - he forgave him for what he did, but he couldn't start a relationship knowing that Tony wasn't completely ready for this. He bit his lip and glanced at Tony.
“I know. It wouldn’t have been the same.” He exhaled softly. “Good thing I didn’t have to say goodbye, huh?”
Steve sighed and leaned against the wall, his gaze resting on the people who were dancing. If one could call grinding up against each other dancing. One would think those in law school would behave better, but…well, guess he was incorrect. Steve pushed himself away from the wall and exited the room when he saw some girl make eye contact with him. No. That was definitely not what he was here for.
“I didn’t feel like making anything else. I'm making a BLT, do you want one?” Steve opened the pantry and took out a loaf of bread.
“I know that I can’t,” Steve murmured. He winced; he never wanted to talk about this with him. He had just wanted to get over his feelings without telling him. That way he could’ve spared Tony from looking like he just got hit with a curveball that he had no idea was coming. "I didn't want to feel this way."
“I’ll be right there,” Steve replied. He turned back to the crowd. He didn't know if this would work, but he had to try. Besides, this is what the owner and him agreed to. No paparazzi inside. “The art gallery will not allow you to be inside since photography is not allowed. Now, you got your pictures. Please respect Tony’s privacy and my own, as well as those who want to visit the exhibit tonight. They do not want to be bombarded by flashes of a camera. If you try to get in, remember that there are security guards here.” He gestured to the security guards. “And if you somehow get past them, there are two Avengers inside.” He smirked at them. “I wish you all a good night.”
"Steve.” His voice comes out flat and shaky because confrontation isn’t easy even when you’re on the interrogator’s side. "What is this?"
She would not hear of his grievances; his mother, a wet nurse, had been entrusted with Lady Maria’s infant son, and there was no dismissing the honor which lay in caring for the Stark heir. With his mother making for a vital role in the Stark household, they enjoyed many privileges; early mealtimes, warm baths every third day and an expansive bedchamber all for themselves were novelties few of the castle's staff would ever experience.
As night falls, Tony finds himself looking out the window repeatedly, always checking for the single, small glimmer of light that belongs to Rogers' fire at the camp. He eats a single serving of canned beans, grimacing at the taste all the way through, and has to wash the bites down with swigs of whiskey. Only when he can hardly keep his eyes open does he leave his seat by the window.
"So," Tony prompts, resolving to get it over with, "what's the occasion? Is this one of the minor anniversaries? First kiss? First time you left your toothbrush in my bathroom, maybe? Uh, first time I farted during–"
With Sir Steven's words, the Lord shuddered violently and desperately bucked into the other's hold, his mouth falling open in a long-drawn
Tony throws up in his stead, what little food they shared emptied out in front of him. Steve swallows the bile back down when he feels it coming, ignoring the burn down his throat.
When he’s recollected himself enough to make his eyes stop burning, he looks back up. Tony is watching him, his expression pondering, but his gaze shifts off to the side once Steve returns it.
In any case, Nebula is around less and less so. Like she can’t stand looking at what he’s turned into (broken, hollow, a shell), or can’t bear to be around him in that soon-to-come moment when he’ll crawl off into a dark corner to die, as an animal does. Tony wouldn’t hold it against her, but then again, he doesn’t think that’s it. Not quite. He thinks she’s seen too much to be disturbed by death. He thinks–maybe she needs space to cope, even if she doesn’t show it, even if their acquaintance has been short-lived.
He’s expected to take another moment to follow Tony over the edge, but the instant his hole spasms around Steve tight and hot, he’s done for. With a blissed-out moan, he comes inside Tony, who’s gasping audibly as he spills his release within him.
His very being strived against the prospect of causing Tony harm, and that was quite enough to make him stop his ministrations as soon as he heard a muffled, pained grunt uttered by the other man.
Steve dug his fingers harder into the flesh at Tony's hips when his walls worked around the head of his dick yet again. He was three inches in, give or take, and Tony was mewling and spasming around him at the tiniest movement, his opening already too far stretched to close up properly.
The way he's pounding into Stark now is brutal – Steve would fear he might be hurting him if everything didn't point toward the fact that Stark enjoys it like this, punishing.
This year and all the ones to come, she saw to it that the armory was steadily improved, expanded and replenished. It was a task she found joy in, and the position earned her respect amongst the castle's inhabitants as well.
) but the moisture on his stomach and the fantastic fullness he’s feeling are testament to it: he’s blacked out for the time it took Steve to come.
“SHIELD,” Steve says, finally. It’s directed at the agents in the room, Natasha and Clint, but his eyes are still on Wanda, which makes Pietro step a little closer to her on instinct. “They still have the scepter?”
do this all day, blue balls be damned. He'd probably remain right on the brink of breaching him, just to prove a point. It should be maddening (it is), except this isn't about Steve being his usual bull-headed self. Tony doesn't approve of his methods, but he is doing this
And then, the woman who introduces herself as Carol Danvers carries them back to Earth with ease and speed both of which make Tony rethink the angel theory as he sits there, strapped to the seat in the cockpit that shakes with the force of their velocity.
He shakes the thought when Tony turns to him, his forehead creased in a contemplative frown before he sighs and hangs his head, gesturing for Steve to come along as he heads down the hall, into the living room.
Steve twists and turns for a long, long time until he finally drifts off, pretending it's not Tony on his mind when he does.
It's a while until Steve is fully convinced that Tony can take care of and defend himself outside of the safety of their home, but the day comes eventually.
Steve sits hunched over at the edge of the mattress when Tony all but stumbles out of the bathroom, dead on his feet and yet immediately alert when he sees the man’s back shake. He sits down next to him and doesn't even have a second to register what’s happening: Steve lifts his head out of his hands, revealing red-rimmed eyes, blood and dirt littering his features, and then Tony's dragged into a hug he couldn't break out of even if he wanted to.
Steve rubs the globes of his ass and then pulls them apart. After a few seconds of teasing his slicked length up and down his crack, Steve presses against his hole with intent. Tony bites back something he knows would’ve been a needy whine.
When he looks up, his gaze isn’t drawn to Tony but instead to Wanda right across the table. Tony doesn’t know if he’s imagining it, but he could swear he feels her subdued anxiety thrum through the rest of them.
Never did the man attempt to make her duties more cumbersome, just like he did not allow anyone to go easy on her during their trainings. It was on her to earn her keep – and Carol did.
He swaps the engineering book for a corny novel about a woman who speaks to spirits, and then replaces that with a thorough guide to garden maintenance when the story gets all too outlandish.
There used to be a time it didn’t, not by a long shot, but now the door to the workshop will keep Steve out, an insurmountable barrier no matter whether it’s locked or not. On the rare occasion he does overcome it, Steve appears with food and an apology. Tony feels queasy thinking about both; he should be the one apologizing. It's not Steve's fault someone not only impersonated him but copied his likeness from the exact octave of his voice to the proportions of his dick.
Feeling Steve's eyes burning a hole into his profile, Tony turns, returning his glassy stare. The corners of his eyes are burning, breathing a irregular sequence of broken gasps and faltering inhales.
The guilt in his eyes gives Tony pause. He nods through a sigh. Steve disappears to do as he said and Tony takes a walk around the house as well, not expecting to find much.
Nobody is around here during these hours, not even hikers, and yet Tony's exhibitionist streak gets a little kick out of being outside and bare. If there’s a bad influence between them, it’s Steve, because there’s no doubt in Tony’s mind that he can tell and is enabling him.
The term of endearment still has something flutter pleasantly in his stomach, and he'd feel self-conscious about the heat in his cheeks if it wasn't so damn nice. It's a pass on the mask, this time around: Tony's going all out, emotional fallout be damned.
"It's funny, because I thought you were the same, almost, but," he laughs quietly to himself, "you're different, and it helps. With the remembering."
Tony's body shook around him violently on the next thrust in, and Steve stilled as a momentary feeling of horror shot through him. The other man whined in response, inching back to take slip more of him inside – the reaction had been a positive one. Steve resumed his movement and aimed to hit that same spot he had brushed previously, and there: Tony twitched again, fingers clutching the sheets spasming, and moaned an obscene sound that made arousal flare up with renewed vigor in every cell of Steve's body.
One evening, just as the sun is setting, Steve returns from the forest nearby, small game slung over his shoulder.
Passing stars blur into streaks of light. Bodies of energy bursting with power the likes of which humanity can only dream of, galaxies away with its little
Tony heaves a long-suffering sigh but gets up anyway. As he fits himself against Steve, he places his own sock-clad feet on top of Steve's and winds his arms around his shoulders from below.
When Tony winks and shoots Rogers a smirk, he finds the man already looking at him. He avoids his gaze the moment their eyes meet, and Tony sees a muscle in his jaw tic angrily when he looks away.
Steve hears him cry out his name, some nights, while he throws his head side to side and whimpers and moans and mumbles
It does. Not a full-throated, head thrown back laugh like he’s so rarely seen, but soft and happy, half smile, like he’s never seen before. “I can work with that,” Steve says. He links their fingers together, and tugs Tony towards the bed.
And when he walks into the conference room after lunch, he’s still thinking about the videos he’d watched of the parades, thinks he might like to take another roadtrip, drive out west, see the Windy City from his bike instead of the stage. He’s not expecting to see an image of himself in uniform arguing with Iron Man projected up on the screen at the front of the room.
Even if he weren’t having a good time, Tony thinks it would be worth it just to see Steve this happy, this relaxed, to have him this willing – eager, even – to talk to Tony about something he’s so clearly passionate about. Something that doesn’t involve battle tactics or a list of Tony’s defects. Tony thinks a lot of things would be worth this, and even thinking that makes him want to kick himself, but he’s already started thinking of other ways to make Steve smile, other things Steve might be willing to go and do, that he might enjoy.
“If we’re sleeping together, you don’t have to – what did you call it? Live like a monk? – and we don’t have to worry about anyone going to the papers with it.”
Clint shoots her a look of betrayal, the effect only slightly ruined by the new mouthful he’s working on. Natasha ignores him.
Tony rolls his eyes again, this time glad no one can see him, and gestures for Barton and Natasha to precede him into the jet.
“Everything okay?” Ms. Potts asks over Steve’s shoulder, not quite in his space – not the way Tony is, and how did Steve not even realize how close Tony was standing to him? – but close enough that no one will overhear.
Tony forces himself not to grit his teeth. “Are you here to mother hen?” he wants to know. “Because I’m trying to work.”
Steve appreciates it, he does, and extra air support is probably exactly what they need, but it still rankles that Tony’s just taken over everything without so much as a by-your-leave. The wedding had been surprisingly unnerving, rather than just awkward, as Steve had been expecting. He’d hoped that the time away from each other – whether intentional or not – would have settled whatever it was, and Tony certainly seems back to his usual irritating self, but Steve still feels off-kilter. It’s a little like he’s forgotten something, or is missing something, but it remains elusive. Tony’s presence just seems to be making it worse, and his attitude isn’t doing anything to help Steve’s frustration, either.
“No,” Tony has to agree. “Probably not. But,” he holds up a hand before Steve can say anything, “mass murdering AIs aside, it’s not like there’s a
“I’m sorry,” Steve says again. He’s got one hand cupping the uninjured side of Tony’s face now, thumb matching its earlier motion, brushing tears away even as they dry. “I shouldn’t have – this wasn’t the time.”
“Don’t do that,” he tells her. “That thing, with your face. It makes me feel like there’s someone killing puppies, and nobody likes a puppy-killer, but I don’t know how to save the puppies.”
Ms. Potts hums agreement. “Yes, the appointment is at eleven. We’re meeting Phil downstairs.” She eyes him. “You may want to change.”
It’s all so ridiculous Steve can’t even think of a way to object, just sits and gapes for a long moment. He knows the world is still fighting over race, religion, politics, pushing smaller groups down, and he hates it, always has, but the very idea that people would think
Steve finishes tying his laces while he thinks. “When was the last time Tony slept more than eight hours straight through when he wasn’t sick or recovering from something?” he asks eventually.
The sound of a door slamming down the hall coincides with the loud gurgle of the coffee machine turning itself on. Clint jerks away from it, curling almost protectively around the remainder of his breakfast.
“If Bigfoot shows up, I’m filing a complaint,” Barton announces when they get their first look at the alligators.
“Look, I have to go shower and change, and then meet Tony and Ms. Potts downstairs.” He starts backing towards the door. “Thanks for the best man offer, but we’ve got it covered. Welcome back!” and he very pointedly doesn’t make a run for it, but walks swiftly back to his room, wondering for possibly the millionth time in the last few days what he’s gotten himself into.
“We’re all proud of you, and of Tony, for going through this – I don’t know that I could, were I in your situation – and we all appreciate what it means. But that does not mean any one of us is blind to the situation. I know how difficult Tony can be, and that many of us may not seem to, but we do have his best interests at heart.”
After that, it’s surprisingly like most of the other battles they’ve fought against multiple assailants, up to and including SHIELD showing up late to head the evacuation process and add a handful of their own jets to the perimeter guard. Not that Steve can think of anything involving giant pigeons as
After what might be a few minutes, or might be hours, Tony manages to pry his fingers from Steve’s wrists, winces at the marks his nails have left, little red crescents in skin bleached white from the pressure. “Sorry,” he rasps, lightly touches a fingertip to one of the indents.
