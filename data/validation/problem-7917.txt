"Oh, no! No, you don't. Not that look. Goddamn it!" He turned back to the road. "You know what that look does to me!"
to celebrate with him. He marveled at this — at this disparate group of people that, five years ago, he could not have imagined putting up with beyond however long it took to take the picture.
crazy. Again, dead now, so, nothing really for anyone else to worry about. Except me, who's like this the rest of my life 'cause, according to the Scandinavian with the hammer—"
Thor frowned as he chewed, and he swallowed and said, "As I understand, 'tis quite natural for those in your condition, and I did not hold it against you for a moment."
"Topical," Barton muttered.
She continued to brush the hair away from his forehead, but there was something almost chilly about her demeanor — like Tony had touched a nerve he didn't even know was exposed. She smiled at him, some strange and foreign sadness clouding her previously clear green eyes, murmured something in Russian, and then said something about it being her turn to relieve Hill from her post.
to? Hadn't once been enough? And besides, would Steve even want another one? Much as Steve adored Olivia, he hadn't even wanted a kid in the Tower originally. He was sure one was Steve's limit, no matter how much Steve may have, deep down, wished for half-a-dozen.
"Well, I do," she said, nudging him a little but keeping her focus solely on Tony. "I mean, I— I've always been this way. I was born this way. But you— Is it weird? Is it uncomfortable? Do you
Tony watched as Steve stared down at the objects in his hand like he couldn't fathom what he was seeing. He didn't linger too much on the portrait of his father — understandably; he'd never known the man — and the photo of himself and Bucky at what looked like Steve's high school graduation seemed to make him just the slightest bit uncomfortable, but he spent an awful long time staring at the portrait of his mother. Tony started to think that he'd been had and these weren't even Steve's old photos at all, and he went to apologize for even attempting to pass off clear forgeries as the real thing when Steve turned to him, eyes wet and awe written over his face.
"I don't know," Bucky said, and Steve realized they were pretty much ignoring his presence at this point. "But I need something to cheer me up. Any of your mom's cookies left?"
," Steve had said purely on instinct, the tone slightly chiding. Very little of what Tony had said had made sense.
"How would Bruce even know anyone in that field?"
But Tony just bent his knees and spread his legs wide, which…did not exactly have the desired effect given that Tony was still wearing sleep clothes.
going to take two-and-a-half hours to make me look presentable."
Steve's face went hard at that, and he went a little stiff and rigid like he was putting himself on guard. "I've heard of it."
Both Tony and Natasha turned to Barton, who was busy staring at Tony's breasts. Tony glanced down and saw his nipples were erect, poking against the thin fabric of the shirt.
After ensuring that the hem was correct for the shoes Tony had chosen to wear, the straps were even, the accent piece wasn't going anywhere, and the gossamer flowed and swayed the right way when Tony took each step, the designer and her assistant gathered up their things and left, and as the designer stepped onto the elevator, she turned back and smiled at Tony and said, "I'm sure Miss Potts will forward my bill to you."
Someone, well, like Tony, as it turned out.
"And how do you suppose I go about doing that?" he asked and sat back some, flipping through the book and more fanning the pages than actually looking at anything.
Everyone took their turn and their time, some succumbing to tears as they told their tale, and they went around the room sharing their struggles and their victories, and when it came time for Steve and Tony, at long last, to share theirs, Steve opened his mouth to begin the tale — presumably in his usual no-nonsense way — but Tony reached back and patted his arm and said, "I got this babe," then turned to face the legion of very curious attendees that, judging by the looks on their faces, had been just barely able to contain their curiosity the entire time the rest of the group had done their sharing.
"Seems like a good man," he said and began to dispense with Olivia's outerwear.
And then, Steven G. Stark-Rogers did something Tony hoped to never see the cocky son-of-a- bitch do ever again.
much of an asshole. I'd never wish that on anyone. However, I do wish you'd give some of Bruce's herbal teas a try—"
Steve whistled, marveling almost at what he'd just heard. "Jeez, back in my day, you just kinda had to wait 'til it was born to know if it was a boy or a girl. Sorta made it a little more fun — more like a present to open, I guess." He shrugged, a little embarrassed. "I don't know," he added and looked down to Tony. "It's up to you."
"—and
for me to finish taking a bite before they took the picture? I look like a fucking cow!"
— past or present. And he'd examined the photographs enough to know.
Tony considered this a moment as he watched his slumbering babe. "Steve would have been disappointed."
. He was a good girl. He was Steve's good girl. Steve's good Antonia Natasha.
Tony made a 'hmm' sound but said nothing, and Steve went back to reading another poster, this time on breast feeding.
"Jersey— Guy out in Jersey. His mother had them 'cause her father had them or something. Didn't seem to know how his grandfather had gotten his hands on them. I'm going to assume Howard had a fire sale after you…disappeared."
"You didn't have to do anything you didn't want to."
don't think Steve thinks the world of you?"
"Like hell I woulda signed a prenup."
Tony motioned at the blank TV. "You know it won a bunch of Academy Awards in 1965 or '66 or whatever. Uh, '66, I think, 'cause I think it came out in '65."
Steve seemingly thought about this a moment before he said, "No, I don't think— It's…kind of hard to explain. I mean, there's things we can do when you're in one form that we can't do when you're in the other and vice versa."
"Because they're thinking of the same exact bad lie to tell us?" Rhodey said.
Steve glanced to him more fully. "You didn't before?"
"A queen has more power," Steve said with a shrug.
"How do you want it?" Steve asked after he'd finished sucking Tony's fingers, and Tony swallowed and thought back to that dream for only a second before he said, "I want you to make love to me."
like Captain America there," Tony said, and Steve shot him another
“I hear you, doll baby,” he called up the stairs. “I’m coming.”
"Yeah," Tony said because nothing else sounded good at the moment.
He blinked and considered this. "No," he said, a little distant and a little contemplative, "I don't." He shook his head. "But, no, she was talking about people we'd never heard of like Sam—"
"No, I don't want you to be gentle. I want you to be all strong and powerful — like a fucking alpha male grunting and beating your chest because you knocked up your mate."
Olivia squealed in joy and clapped her hands together, and Rhodey clapped him on the shoulder and said, "You know there's no coming back from this, right?"
Tony just hummed at that — Steve took it as an acknowledgement of what he'd said — and determining that Tony was OK for the moment, he stumbled off to the adjoining bathroom and grabbed a clean and unused towel from the rack there. He wiped himself off before he went back out into the shop, his legs much more cooperative now, and he went over to the table and was about to reach down to clean Tony off when he remembered that Tony...didn't quite look like himself, and he stopped just as he was about to touch Tony and said, "Uh, I, uh, I have a towel here if you want to clean yourself off."
He was going to find some study that showed coffee drinking was A-OK, and he'd shove it in Steve's face and never let him hear the end of it.
Natasha didn't even bother trying to hide that she was rolling her eyes, and she said again, "
"Whatever," Jim replied and rolled his eyes before he carried the baby over to the couch and sat down on the end opposite Thor. "So, we gonna open presents and be all happy and shit or what?"
"I know," Steve said with a sigh. "Well, you are the smarter of the two of us."
"Do you not know me at all? Do you
don't think we're meeting again. Sorry. I'm sure you're tons of fun at parties, but, yeah, got a life to live here."
: There is a part of a scene in this chapter that some may consider to be transphobic. It is not intended to be. At most, it is intended to be read as Tony using some creep's transphobia to put him in his place. But please be aware that some may consider it transphobic. Also, there is also some derogatory language and a hefty amount of sexual harassment. If any of that makes you uneasy, you may want to skip this chapter.
hanging around. I don't want you running off to missions or taking down governments or fighting off invaders. Leave that to the other guys.
He'd fallen for him from the start, from the moment Tony had dragged him away from that frat party and into the city streets at eleven-thirty at night. He hadn't known Tony was only seventeen at the time; Tony gave a damned good impression of appearing older than he was, and the moment he'd found out, he'd put the kibosh on anything untoward happening until Tony had turned eighteen. Tony had been less than pleased with that and had threatened never to talk to Rhodey again.
"You understand now," she said.
So, to Steve's bemusement, he followed him down to the gym and sat and watched as he ran through some warm-ups then worked at punching the shit out of one of the heavy bags (splitting it at one point and murmuring a not-exactly-earnest, "Sorry," as sand poured from it; Tony waved off his admitted lack of concern and said it was nothing and he'd get it fixed for him).
The text came when Steve was crossing the threshold to his small apartment after suffering through his Thursday afternoon art history class, the one filled with bored seniors looking for an easy elective.
He frowned and made a sour face as he put a hand to his abdomen.
Tony sighed and rolled his eyes. "Steve, I'm really not in the mood to—"
Especially Steve. Steve
"Meaning?"
"Depends on what you consider an 'arcade,'" she replied, and Barton rolled his eyes. "Not sure it was such a great idea to invest in a laser tag arena, though."
it," Steve said, his jaw tensing the way it did when he was annoyed at something or someone. "It's not a tall tale or a myth. It's something that's actually happened to us — something we have to live with, and something we have to deal with. You can think we're lying all you want. Doesn't matter to me. We can't make you believe it. We can only state what we know to be the absolute truth. Whether you choose to believe it or not is up to you."
But Tony just pulled up the tablet and began to read off the words he'd highlighted. "Mucus plugs. Blood. Gushing fluid. Shit— I could

in love before, so he really had no frame of reference for it. He thought about his smile, his manner, the way he walked and the way he talked and the way he looked at Steve like he was the only person in the room. He thought about the easy way they could talk to each other and the easy way they seemed to get each other and understand each other without having to say a word. He supposed, on Tony's part, it was because they had been married for some time, but as Tony had pointed out, he wasn't
Steve nodded, and he set the bottle down and reached out for a paper bag to his right, pulling out what looked like a couple refrigerated bottles of Coke. Steve handed one over to him, and Tony took it and said, "This is so gauche," but still cracked it open and took a long, savory pull of it, pulling it back and belching rather loudly after he'd downed around half the bottle in one go.
Tony reached down and pulled the blanket up some to more fully cover them. "Yeah, but you're so fucking determined to take the world on your shoulders to keep everyone else safe and protected. You've gotta let me help you shoulder the burden more often. Contrary to all the whining I do, I don't actually mind it. There's no one else I'd rather do it for."
He motioned to Tony's abdomen at that, and Tony, for a brief and fleeting moment, wondered how dangerous it would be if word got out he was preg...
Bruce grabbed a tube of silicone gel and turned to Tony. "Uh, Tony, you're going to have to pull your pants down a little bit."
Barnes stood there a moment and processed the words before he rolled his eyes once more and muttered a disbelieving, "Oh, my god." He shook his head and exhaled a sharp breath then looked at Tony and said, "He doesn't really—"
"Unfortunately," Bruce muttered and pulled the stick out of Steve's skin. He stuck a cotton ball and a band-aid over it, and Steve stumbled a little as he stood up from the bed, but Tony was right there beside him to steady him, and Steve stared down at him a moment before he smiled stupidly and said, "Hey."
"Max capacity," Tony said with an exhale of breath as he rubbed his back some more, "the reactor should be able to power the building for five years. Installed the current one last year, so, we should be OK on that front. Really about finding space to put beds and equipment, neither of which we have. How bad is it out there?"
Steve frowned a little at him, almost like he was insulted by what Tony was insinuating. "How 'bout what?"
your explanations. I want to know what you're doing sticking your dick into someone else behind Tony's back.
that Steve was alive. He thought he did, anyway. Maybe it was hormones. Maybe it was his body's way of keeping calm and focused while he was trying to shove a person out of it. But even now, he still
"Well, I think the four-year-old calling her 'Aunt Pepper' is actually what did it."
"Right, so
He went over to the tree and gazed at the small, white bulbs that covered it. He pinched one between his thumb and index finger and tried to figure out how they even worked — they were the tiniest things he'd ever seen — then shook his head and shrugged his shoulders and let go of the tiny bulb. He let his gaze linger over the bevy of ornaments that looked to be an amalgam of everything and not anything that could be considered a 'theme.' In the center, toward the top, was one of what looked like a little mouse wearing a Santa hat and sitting atop a child's letter block, and in powder pink writing was spelled out 'Baby's First Christmas 2014.'
"Ugh," Tony said and slumped into his chair. "They do remember the scent of those things makes me throw up, right?"
"He'll be right out," she said as she hung up the receiver, and Steve nodded and sat quietly, his arms folded, while Tony drummed his fingers on the desk and waited for the head clerk or main clerk or whatever the lead clerk was called to make his appearance, vowing to leave a very honest two-star review on Yelp when this was all said and done.
"Thought babies are born with blue eyes?" Steve asked and looked up in slight confusion at Tony.
"Yeah," Sam said, directing a slight glare at Tony. "He is."
There was silence for a moment before Tony looked at Steve and said, "Wait, how come he doesn't get a 'Language!'?"
"So, I can't really tell you what happened in that gap between when you fell asleep and now, but I can tell you that everything that's happened has been completely, totally, one hundred percent worth it — for both of us. A lot of really shitty things happened to us, but if changing any of those shitty things meant that we wouldn't be sitting here at this moment opening presents on Christmas morning, then I wouldn't change one second of the past for either one of us."
This seemed to surprise Tony, if the way he turned was any indication, his mouth clamped shut but his eyebrows raised slightly.
. "Sweet. Is that why you're squeezing your eyes shut and turning your head away like I'm disemboweling her in sacrifice to some pagan god?"
"Sorry," Steve said with a shrug. "No take-backs. Should have read the fine print on your contract."
"Your personality. Kinda salty."
If only Steve were there with him to appreciate it.
"OK, goodnight," Steve said and turned over to kiss his cheek then turned back and tried to get comfortable.
"So, wait, you don't trust me?"
idea?"
"Had to contain the threat," Steve said. "Had to make sure they didn't make off with the goods."
What Steve meant to say in response, and what Steve
"You cannot be serious," Wilson said, and that was when Tony realized they were both sharing space on the love seat, Natasha sitting on the arm of it right next to Barnes.
"Yes," he said without even thinking, and Tony paused a moment before glancing back up at him again.
Tony just shook his head and buried his face in his hands, his elbows braced on his knees. "I can't believe this is happening."
Steve just shook his head and swung Tony's arms a little more. "Stop it. You love him. Don't even pretend otherwise. You might think I'm a sap, but you're a sentimental fool."
Steve took the container of gelato and put it in the freezer, and Tony scraped at what remained in the bowl. "You know, we never finished our conversation."
"God, I hope this isn't a sign of some kind," he muttered and took a sip.
"Fine," Steve said with an exhaled breath.
"This is not a
be able to come. The way his hands were on Tony's body, the way he touched his abdomen — his ridiculously sensitive abdomen — the way his muscles clenched and yearned for even more of that touch, the way his clit swelled and throbbed with need, the way his vaginal muscles twitched and clenched around Steve's cock, desperate to have it, desperate to feel him thrust into him and force him to take his seed. He needed it. He needed Steve so bad.
an explanation for it." Then he laughed. "Why don't you want to admit that she could have been from the future— from
Wait, Rhodey was in town? Oh, that's right. Rhodey was... They had plans, didn't they? Fuck, maybe he'd been hitting the sauce a little too hard lately.
She shook her head, again in that vigorous way that kids did. "No. Sometimes he does, and Papa says, 'If you die out there this time, I'll kill you.'" She made a disgusted face. "And then they
"Fine. Whatever. I'll buy her her own R8. Black with red trim. I think she'd like that."
and go and get me some—"
to look when he's addressing JARVIS, so I guess the ceiling makes the most sense to him," Bruce added. "Stop trying to pick him apart. You're not doing yourself any favors."
Steve opened both eyes and made a face. "What's the catch?"
"If you mean 'shape,' then clearly you need to have your eyes checked because there is no way a lumpy pillow could ever be confused with that expertly-sculpted marble he calls a torso. If you mean because the shirt would be too small for even the pillow, well, I can't argue with you there." He pointed a finger at her. "But I can tell you don't you
But Anthony would have none of it. Anthony's…bed linens were already quite warmed, as it turned out.
"Can you confirm Captain Rogers is the father?"
"Glad we're on the same page here, J," he said and stopped short when he realized he'd jumped from working on one project to another without a thought. He set the soldering iron down and sat back, drumming his fingers on the tabletop as he tried to figure out how that even could have happened. He glanced down to his hand and watched the way the gold engagement band he wore on his right ring finger bounced and wiggled and turned with each tap of the finger, and he stopped drumming his fingers and picked his hand up. He frowned and pulled the ring off his finger — for as loose as it was, it was actually kind of amazing it hadn't fallen off at any point beforehand — and inspected it a moment. He tried it on his middle finger, then index finger, and finally his thumb to no avail. The ring was too big for his suddenly slender fingers, and he frowned some more and twirled the band between his thumb and forefinger, watching the way the gold caught the light of the lab.
"Would you stop that?" Steve asked, not even bothering to look up from whatever he was reading.
But he could definitely admit that Olivia had not been the relationship-killer she could have been. If anything, she had added to their relationship in ways they were only now beginning to appreciate. So…and not that he was too happy about admitting this, but…maybe Esmeralda was right?
Steve just raised a challenging eyebrow.
She laughed, light and merry. "Oh, no, Captain. That's not the reason. That's not the reason at all." She exhaled a light, happy breath. "But that you must learn on your own."
. Yeah, that would go over real well.
"There he is!" she said quietly like she'd just remembered something.
Steve smiled and shook his head a little but said nothing to that.
"Hmm...well, the more you know," Tony said with a shrug. "Think she would have gotten a little frustrated once she realized she couldn't get anything out of you. Let's face it, she's got your appetite."
"She didn't catch us doing anything else, did she?"
Steve glanced back at him. "It is the best option — for both baby and mother."
"Don't know what you're missing," Bruce said with a slight grin on his face, and to prove his point, he shoved another spoonful of the garbage into his mouth.
Sam stared at him a little longer then shook his head and said, "Buck's right. You two
, and it's just…amazing that I get to have this, and I get to have some part of you that no one else can ever have, and I get to see you in a way that no one else ever will."
you are, but trust me, that body is completely female, and I'd just like to make sure it's as perfect as it appears to be."
"Hmm…yeah, well, clearly you don't know him as well as you think you do then," Tony said. But Barnes let out another breath and murmured a sad, "
"Why?" he asked and folded his arms tight against his chest. "Why should I allow you that favor?"
"Think I want to know what my fiancé thinks of my appearance."
and said, "Tony, I know you're having fun, but I think I have—"
Just another one of those glaring imperfections that had made Howard dislike him so. At least his mother had loved him, even if she would have been disappointed — not that he'd been 'knocked up,' necessarily, but that his father's obsession had been the one to do it.
"Of course," Steve replied and brushed his lips over his temple just as the car arrived at the penthouse, announcing its arrival with a 'ding.' The door slid open, and Steve took Tony's hand to lead him off, and he made to go over to the couch, but Tony tugged on his hand and said, "Come here."
He motioned to what they were doing, and the doctor nodded and said, "With about ninety-five percent certainty."
"He loves me," Tony said with a shrug and glanced back up to Wilson, who was standing and shaking his head a little, but there was a tiny smile on his mouth.
"I think you've done your part, don't you? You took down Hydra, took out the Red Skull, saved the world. That's enough for
Pepper laughed and squeezed his hand. "You're being sensitive again."
Steve was everywhere he turned: from a stupid knickknack to a blanket to a can of soda he'd left on the coffee table. There were his notes on another table and a pair of sneakers kicked off to the side and a picture of the two of them taken at the Avenger-family picnic Thor had made them do last summer (after being introduced to the concept of a 'picnic').
Natasha shrugged. "I'm not sure I can say. I wasn't there. I never even met her. But from what you've said and what Steve has said and what Thor's said and even what Bruce has said… I think there's a reason she chose you two. I think she saw something in you both. I don't think she was trying to torture you or hurt you. I think she honestly thought she was doing something good for you. You and Steve are soul mates. She thinks this is what all soul mates want."
I'm her dad — her 'papa.' I can feel it, Jim. I can honest-to- god feel it in my bones. She looks like me, for god's sake! You can't deny that."
"Look, I'm not saying it
Hey, he'd finally gotten that promised massage after all. Just…not from the person he'd wanted to get it from.
"Yeah? Well, whose fault is it that I'm even in this predicament in the first place? Shouldn't you be the one to fix what you fucked up?"
because of Bucky. Not because I'd see Bucky again. But
"Huh," he said and unthinkingly reached up to rub his belly. "You just told me it was magic."
And he hated that, for the first time in his life, it was being directed at him.
Steve just moved closer and said, "You're pregnant, Tony, and if what Esmeralda said is true, and if what Thor says about her is true, then it's incredibly high-risk, and I'm not having you risk giving yourself a miscarriage out there."
did he even get here?
Her grin broadened into a warm and knowing smile. "I don't know," she said somewhat cryptically. "Am I? And I think the word you're looking for is
"Steve, you pull that helmet off again in the middle of a fight, I'm going to staple it to your head," Tony said, but he was too far away in the field for his words to have much weight, and Steve ignored them and instead kept up his pleading with Barnes.
While he had enjoyed looking at them in general in the past, he did not enjoy having breasts of his own, which always seemed to get in the way whenever he was trying to fold his arms or make a point of some kind, and while bras were, again, annoying as fuck, it was even more annoying to not wear one. And he had remember to sit down to pee, which, for whatever reason, he had to do a
"What? I fail to see how—"
"Fine," she said with a huff.
"You ever seen
Rhodey turned to look over where DUM-E was rolling around chasing after a squealing Olivia, and Bruce was staring at them nervously, biting his lip and telling them to be careful. He shook his head a little and turned back to Tony, but before he could say anything, Tony beat him to the punch.
"Is that what they're called?"
would talk about breastfeeding. Even just pregnancy in general. I don't even think most expectant mothers knew what was going on. And fathers?" He scoffed then glanced at Tony. "You know they let them into delivery rooms now?"
Hill nodded. "You got it," she said and left the room again to presumably make the necessary arrangements, and Steve took a deep breath and rubbed a hand over his face.
"Merry Christmas, you spoiled, little monster," the man said and leaned in to kiss her cheek, and she giggled again. "Got these two wrapped around your tiny, little finger— Yeah, don't get all coy with me, I'm onto you. I know your game."
Tony shot a glare at him and said, "Thank you. I couldn't figure that out on my own."
Natasha must have packed that lunch for him. He got oddly defensive when it came to her.
So, he plastered a tight smile over his face and hoped it would be enough, but Steve just frowned and said again, "What's wrong?"
"You're just figuring that out now?" Steve said and side-eyed him from the where he lay on the bed reading something on his tablet.
The little girl frowned and said, "Vision, are you in the ceiling, too? Papa, why's Vision in the ceiling?"
"Hmm?"
He took the phone from Rhodey and said, "What the hell are you two—"
"Brucie, Nat, Hill,
Bruce heaved a sigh and shook his head. "If you can't figure it out on your own, I'm not going to tell you."
"Oh," Bruce said and turned to Tony. "You shouldn't be on your feet, then. Go rest."
Tony hummed and poured more batter onto the iron. "You think so?"
"They met up with a lot more resistance than they thought they'd get," Natasha explained, pulling her hand back to brace it against the tabletop. "Happened the way we thought it would. The first target went offline as soon as they left the Tower. They were able to get to the third target in time, but they met up with a lot of resistance."
He should have felt guilty for it—
Rhodey stared at him a moment then said, "Oh! Uh, nothing. Not—"
"I'm kind of partial to the cow catapult, myself," Bruce said, and Tony stole a glance at Steve to see him making a rather amusing 'what the fuck?' face.
"I believe I heard something about your government paying you a considerable sum for, oh, how do you say, leaving you in a block of ice for seventy years."
He suddenly realized he'd probably ground the coffee beans to a fine powder — caught in his thoughts as he was — and he shut the grinder off and pulled the top off.
Somebody whistled from the phone Rhodey was holding. Tony couldn't actually tell which one of them had done it. He took several long strides over to where Steve stood, Steve's eyes raking over his form, his mouth having a hard time staying closed, and as everyone took their places for the ceremony, Steve was finally able to utter, "You look amazing."
"Yeah."
"Oh, I'm sorry, are you
He didn't know why, but what he did know was that if he continued to think about it, he'd want to do it again.
"No," he said. "I know what you're doing, and no. Not allowed."
Tony glanced back up at Steve. "All the effort she put into making my toes look pretty, I'm really not in the mood to smudge them."
Tony rolled his eyes. "Ketchup, Goldilocks. The word you want is 'ketchup.'" Steve just grabbed the bottle from the fridge, and Thor continued.
"Yeah, and 'asshole' is putting it mildly."
And he liked looking this way.
Steve gave a curt shake of his head. "There's no proof that it would even be—"
"Oh," Tony said, staring at the portrait that screamed of untold amounts of love and affection poured into it. He noticed Steve was actually pretty far into the book, and so he flipped back through a few pages, Steve sucking in a breath of air as he watched.
The clerk smiled a little, and she picked up her phone and pressed a button for an extension, and after a few moments of hushed discussion said, "Oh, no, this one you've got to see to believe." She shot a look over at the pair at that, and they exchanged looks of equal parts confusion and insult before they turned their attentions back to her.
never said that," Barton muttered.
Tony adjusted himself against Steve, snuggling closer to him. "Yeah, well, Howard and Aunt Peggy were against it from the beginning. They didn't want anything to do with it, which is why Aunt Peggy isn't in it and Howard was rewritten with a completely different name."
Tony really didn't want to think about 'Antonia' in this context — that was something only Steve got to call him — and so he huffed and said, "Tony. Just call me 'Tony.'"
told Pepper
like I did, but Brucie gave me a quick look- over and says everything looks good, so…"
He nodded his head at Tony at that, and Tony frowned a little and sat up.
Not that Tony hadn't tried to seduce Steve the best ways he knew how, and not that Steve didn't desperately want to give into his libido. But through a combination of common decency and Clint's oft-repeated reminder of 'jail-bait,' he was able to keep his cock tucked into his pants—
Steve and Tony exchanged looks again, and Tony once more just shrugged at Steve's confusion before Steve turned back to him and again asked, "What do you want?"
"Yeah, all right," he murmured and swallowed. "Sorry, I didn't mean to—"
"I don't, all right?"
"Then I think that should bode well for the next forty-odd years."
Steve shrugged and dropped his hand away from his neck. "Because. I didn't... I didn't want to be seen as forcing you. I wanted it to be your decision."
"Nat said she'd be here around noon. Not sure when Pep's showing up. Probably around then, too."
was enough for him.
Tony sighed as he carried Olivia down the steps one morning exactly six weeks to the day she'd been born.
The scents coming from the kitchen turned his stomach once more, but he knew Steve was just being Steve and was trying to do nice things for him, so he left the bedroom and stumbled down the steps to the living area, and he walked past the couch and made his way over to the kitchen.
She considered the IDs again, looked at Tony, looked back at the IDs, then looked at Tony one more time.
for. You think I married you for your sparkling personality? No. I married you for your body and for the fact that you're a detail-obsessed pain-in-the-ass."
to each other."
"You know, I actually didn't believe it until this moment."
"But I don't know that he
She grumbled and folded her arms in a pout, and Rhodey eyed her a moment, head tilted in thought, before he said, "Does she… She looks familiar when she does that, but I can't figure out who—"
She stopped in her tracks, finger to her lips and annoyance lining her emerald irises.
"He's not in this country, as far as we can tell," Natasha said as she smeared a thin layer of cream cheese over her bagel. "Outside of that, we're running into a dead end. He's dropped off the radar—"
Steve closed his eyes, squeezing them tight as though to talk himself out of protesting. "Fine," he said and opened his eyes again to meet Tony's gaze. "If that's what you want, then that's what we do."
"Later, baby. Or do you want to leave now?"
"What?" he asked and tipped his head up to look at Steve, but Steve was stone-cold-serious as he met his gaze.
"Tony, don't pretend with me. You're tired. Go take a nap."
Were there any support groups for people that had just had a relationship ruined by the appearance of a child from the future that was decidedly
"She's a week old, Steve."
He snorted a short laugh this time. "Of course you do." He blinked and focused on her again. "Probably know everything that's going to happen to us."
"They told you, didn't they?"
Steve just continued to give him that same look, but this time, he thrust the instruction booklet at him. Tony took it, and he turned it over in his hands then looked up at Steve and said, "Do you think I really read these?"
"You would," Tony grumbled but nestled his head further into Steve's shoulder and continued to sway with him as the romantic music of the verse swelled into the chorus. He closed his eyes after a few moments of swaying with Steve and the baby, and a few moments after that, he felt Steve's warm lips pressing against his forehead.
"That's terrible," he said, unable to stop the angry furrowing of his brow. "I'm not some wide-eyed farm boy that's too naïve to not get himself taken advantage of by some city slicker. I was like this long before I ever met you. It's just… It's not something you went around broadcasting. Not if you didn't want to end up beaten or jailed or…dead."
Tony pointed. "On the bed, soldier," he said, and Steve, almost as relieved as he was happy, complied.
"Whatever," Tony muttered and rolled his eyes but then set a sharp gaze on Barnes. "What's this about 'magic words'?"
Attempting to be as quiet as possible, he didn't turn any lights on, but he was kind of hungry, so he opened the fridge door and peered inside to see if there was anything quick to snack on. There was the last remnants of a pizza sitting on the table, but he wasn't in the mood for that, and he was too far away from civilization to send Steve out for some gelato— Mmm…chocolate peanut butter cup sounded really good right about now.
The little girl tugged at her shirt so it was splayed out over her torso, and with dawning horror filling his gut, she pointed to the Captain America emblazoned there and said, "That's Daddy," before she moved her small finger over to a fierce-looking Iron Man and added, "That's Papa."
Tony rolled his eyes. "They're not the Queens Mets, they're the New York Mets."
But Olivia just stood over by the tree and clutched fast to her little plush toy. She shook her head and giggled and said, "No!" but Tony just raised his eyebrows and said, "Oh, I'm sorry. Did I phrase that as a question? I don't think I did."
"Is that what the kids are calling it nowadays?" Sam mused. "Oh, hey! What about that German grad student? What was his name?"
"Always got my back, J," he said and stepped onto the car. "
Barnes stared at Bruce a moment then said, "If he's a she for the rest of his life, how come we're still calling him a 'he'?"
Steve stared at Tony's abdomen and said, "Yeah, we're gonna have a talk when I get home, kiddo."
would know what to look for more than I would."
"You," he said through his laughs, "thinking you're cooler than me."
And you'd pump into me so hard and so fast I'd feel it for days afterward, and every time I sat down, all I'd be able to think about is you plunging into me and telling me if I don't come on your cock, I don't come at all. Because I'm yours. I'm yours to do with whatever you want. And then you'd come in me. So much, so much and I'd barely be able to take it all, you'd come so much. But you'd make me take it. You'd come and then you'd plug me up and make me keep it all inside me, make me hold it, keep—
situation."
Steve raised an eyebrow and gave him a smug look. "So, you're saying I don't look like myself. I'm not recognizable."
It then cut to someone asking Tony how he felt about the Supreme Court's recent ruling in favor of same-sex marriage. And Tony, in the flippant fashion Steve remembered he'd always used in public — especially when he had a microphone shoved in his face — said,
Tony sniffed a little. "Don't know that pregnancy would be a good look on you—"
"I notice you didn't deny it."
"And how would you do that?
Steve glanced to where he had his arm blocking access to the elevator, and he frowned and dropped before he scratched at his forehead.
The reporter, however, made a face — a smile like she couldn't believe what Tony had just admitted to but was
"A series of tubes," Tony said in all seriousness, but when Steve nodded his forced understanding, Tony said, "I'm bullshitting you. It's— Yeah, OK, that one's kind of dated. It's…"
"Yeah, OK, so, yeah, magic. Whatever. That doesn't mean it's the same—"
" that Wanda woman urged, but Cap didn't move, and Tony watched as Olivia shot a sad and nervous glance over to him then looked back at the Cap.
to talk about, but why don't we can it for the time being, get back to New York, and then you two can go for round two, all right? Sound like a plan to you? Sounds like a plan to me." He clapped his hands together and moved toward the front of the jet. "All right, New York, here we come!"
Barnes glowered at him, or he thought he was glowering. It was hard to make him out, and Tony was so tired all of a sudden and all he wanted to do was sleep.
"Completely different," Tony replied. "Alternate universe. This Cap is so fucking straight you could set your watch to him."
Maybe, on some level, it would always hold true.
Tony scoffed. "What for? JARVIS can monitor all my vital signs—"
"Or a normal Wednesday," Wilson said.
"Mmm…yeah, a little."
Bruce shrugged. "Like saying 'Captain America'?" He paused a moment in thought. "Um…I'm not sure."
Tony slapped his hands on the arms of the chair. "OK, whelp, that makes me feel better. Glad we had this consult. So, uh, six more months until the next visit, right? Right. OK, thanks again. Nice to meet you—"
. 1973. Please try not to destroy it, OK?"
"A comparison."
Sharon motioned behind her and said, "We've actually been at the bar for the past half-hour."
"Yeah," Steve said, looking a little lost. "I know."
," Natasha said and rubbed his shoulders some. "We don't think any less of you."
"That's not what I mean," Steve said, tilting his head forward a little as though to look at him from over a pair of glasses. "I don't— I just— I'm not taking that chance. Baby showers are— You're just asking for trouble with one."
He glanced back and grinned at Rhodey, who smiled a little and shook his head in response.
"Yeah," he finally said, smiling at Steve like he'd just come to realize something he'd always known deep down. "It is."
"Uh, since when are we on a budget?" Barton glanced over at Tony a moment then turned back to the others. "Did Stark cut our funds and nobody told me?"
"Just a walk," Steve said. He stood up and began to stretch some. "It's actually nice and peaceful out there."
He shrugged. "Suit yourself," he said and went around him toward the living room. "Hey, kiddo, what was that you said about cartoons?"
Tony rolled his eyes. "Yeah, I'm gonna bring along my infant daughter for something like that."
"It is," he replied and listened as Tony fumbled in the cupboards for a mug and the sugar.
He chewed the bite, and Natasha said, "I figured that," a tiny smirk tugging at her mouth. "What sort of clothes?"
"Didn't go very far," he said and went over to set the box beside Tony. He tried to take Olivia out of Tony's arms, but Rhodey got there first and said, "Oh, not so fast. You guys get to hold her all the time. It's my turn to hold this spoiled little princess."
"Well. Isn't that fun?" he muttered and set the waffle on the table. Steve readily snatched it right up, even if there were several other ones already made and sitting on a plate. "Guess that means we won't be out of a job anytime soon."
Steve reached over him and flushed the toilet, and he gently pulled Tony back to his feet. "You OK?" he asked as he checked him over.
"All right, Tony," Bruce said, the unit already set up as he wheeled it over to the bed in the medical lab. "Let's get this over with."
"Maria," he replied, his voice thicker with emotion than he'd intended, and Cap nodded his understanding. "My mother was—"
"The one that's on the door! In the bottles! You put it there for me."
But Esmeralda didn't back down. Instead, she stepped up into Steve's space and said, "Would you have spoken the truth if asked, Captain?"
Steve glanced up and tried to hide what he'd been looking at, but Tony sighed and said, "I know, Steve."
"Yeah," the same detractor from before said, "I still don't buy it."
"How do you know '50s sci-fi shit but don't know
, was he? Yes, he knew what RPF was. Yes, he may have read a story or two in his day, one of which was so on-the-nose that he still thought it had to have been written either by Barton or Natasha.
Steve shot a pointed look at him, though there was a tinge of sorrow and apology there behind blue-green eyes.
"I can appreciate attractive features without wanting to get into your pants."
"Well, you're in a good mood this morning," Bruce said, and Tony turned and grinned at him.
She reached for him to pick her up, and, without thinking, he scooped her up and settled her onto his lap, and she yawned and set the pillow on the worktable and then leaned forward to rest on it.
to Bucky's
Steve was silent a moment, and the next thing he said was, "I notice you said you want me to 'make love' to you."
Steve made a face. "I guess… I don't know. I mean, we never really
Tony shrugged. "Nothing some R&R can't fix. See, I kind of pushed your ten-pound kid out of me a couple days ago—"
"Much better," Tony said, a wistful smile drawing over his lips. "At least for me, anyway. I can't speak for anyone else on the matter."
"Look, if I in any way thought that this could happen, I would have insisted on so many layers of protection that it would be like we weren't even doing anything at all. I thought if anything I would just get changed back and that would be all there was to it. I didn't think… I didn't think it would carry over."
Tony again heard something muttered in Russian, and he was able to fly the suit over the battlefield in time to see Barnes get up from where he sat crushing Steve's chest and simply walk away. Tony did a three-point landing beside Steve just as he'd begun to sit up, and he kept the kneeling position as Steve sat and stared forlornly in the direction Barnes was currently walking. Not running, not sprinting, not darting like he was trying to evade capture. Just walking, slowly, like he couldn't be bothered.
"Whatever," he muttered with a roll of his eyes and pushed the entire thought process to the back of his mind. Nothing worth worrying about now. Now, his only main concern was getting Steve to do that thing that he did with his tongue that made Tony's toes curl and his eyes roll back in his head. Good god, that man really needed to teach a class on cunnilingus.
actually believe him, too?
"I was just making a suggestion."
"I'm sure even you can't screw that up."
He went to argue that the other songs he'd tried to introduce Steve to were just as old, but he let it slide. It was easier that way. Steve would just find some way to talk his way around it again.
He shook his head. "No. I won't let them tear you down—"
He stepped into the room and frowned at the rather utilitarian barrenness of it. There was a bed, a dresser, a bureau, and a table with a small lamp on the one side of the bed, the size of which appeared to be a full. That meant he and Steve would have little choice

"Oh, I don't know. Maybe the way that you were ready, willing, and able to reorganize your life around her after

healthy, and
he could use to grind up the beans, JARVIS said, "
Barton swatted at him, but Romanoff said, "Tempting as it is to make jokes about this—" She put gentle hands on Tony's arm then looked to Bruce. "How serious are we talking?"
"And what if it wasn't?" Sam asked. Steve turned to him and went to say…
"Yeah."
"That's not the point," Steve said. "It would be different if this was something we chose — something that Tony chose. He didn't choose it. It was forced on him, and now he has to see it through to the end unless he wants to die, and that's not happening on my watch."
"Why not? Why not, Tony? Explain to me why it's more plausible that that was a daughter from an alternate universe instead of your own future daughter that you're currently pregnant with because of
something more…I don't know, something more
He opened his eyes, and in his peripheral vision, he could see Tony frown in concern at him. "Babe? Honey? What's wrong? OK, maybe not the video I should have shown you, but—"
Steve sighed a little as he stretched out the hamstrings in his right leg. He dropped his leg from where he'd had it propped up onto the chair, and he took hold of Tony's hands and brought them up to his lips, kissing the back of each hand one at a time. "I give you my solemn oath that nothing will happen to either one of us."
"Steve."
Steve glanced at the drink for only a second and said, "Yeah," before he bit into his burger.
Steve didn't even falter in his steps. "What are you talking about?"
"Hey, man, that's not cool," Wilson said just as Tony finally succeeded in getting himself up. He righted himself, straightening his clothes and yanking on the bra that was riding up his back some and turned his attention Barton.
Steve nodded at the window on the other side of the room. "You took this from the girl at the desk, didn't you?"
He shot a quick glance over at Tony as though to drive home the sincerity and gravity of his words. Tony met his eyes and held them a moment before Steve turned his attention back to the road.
'You know, I don't actually have anything against it—"
"Then why did you—?" He stopped short and shook his head. "Never mind. What time is it?" he muttered and looked at his watch.
"You know he's probably awake for sure, right?"
"He is death where you are life. You are a being of creation. You always have been."
Tony made a face but didn't actually say anything to counter him, and he turned his attention back to the brat, who added, "But they're up the state in the other 'vengers building."
Tony struggled to sit back up some and finally deigned to let Steve help him up, his big-ass belly weighing him down. "Look, this is so sweet and wonderful and thank you so much for it, but at the same time, twelve hours does not a honeymoon make. Think of this as a trial-run — you know, to see if we like it."
Tony snorted a laugh. "Yeah, that's not about intelligence. That's about which one of us is the bigger asshole, and let's face facts, babe. In that realm, I've got you beat by a country mile."
But Tony was having none of it and said, "Yeah, and her nails grow like nothing I've ever seen. Now, close your eyes, you big wuss," as he took Olivia's tiny little pinky between his fingers and positioned the clippers.
What does she mean
Steve just side-eyed him.
. "You'll find out."
"Hey, how do we know this isn't some elaborate joke?" someone else said, and Tony turned in the direction of the voice. "Like, sure,
dance."
"Ah, Steve, you're not buying this shit, are you?" Bucky asked with a disappointed whine.
"Really and truly," he said with a nod.
"Merry Christmas, honey," he murmured in return, turning his head slightly to brush a kiss to Tony's forehead.
"A question."
Well, it was
"And did you ask Santa again the following year?"
Steve shrugged again but didn't say anything, and Tony watched him eat a moment before he said, "Do you remember going into the ice? Crashing the plane?"
— 'Dad, remember that nice, safe, secure desk job I had—'"
Steve shrugged again but said, "A couple of times. Wrecked hell with my asthma. I used to have to smoke those asthma cigarettes from time to time—"
"Close enough," he said, surprised that there could ever come a point in some world where he would be able to take out the arc reactor. He wasn't sure how that was possible — did that mean he was able to finally rid himself of all the shrapnel? — and even though it was a bit painful or uncomfortable or maybe caused him slight breathing problems, he had come to accept it as part of him, not as a burden but as a privilege, a terrible privilege but still a privilege.
"You can find a woman attractive and not want to fuck her."
"Well, yeah, that's already been established," Tony said, taking the wrong meaning from the words.
"Tony, try to sympathize here. He's had his entire life taken away from him. He deliberately crashed a plane to save the world. He thought he was going to die. The next thing he knows, he's very much alive and very much in the future. Everyone he knew or loved is dead. The world as he knew it has passed him by. Just… If he wants to complain about his ball team ditching Brooklyn for sunnier skies, let him."
if this parasite at any point dies before I fucking
Steve just raised a pointed eyebrow at him.
"So, you got my twenty, right?"
"Buck," Steve said with a sigh, and Sam held his hands up a little like Steve didn't need to say anything more.
Steve just shook his head and bit back a smile as Tony carried the baby out of her room. Steve followed, making his way downstairs just behind Tony, and they came into the festively-decorated living area. Tony hummed happily and said something about getting the baby something to eat, but Steve stopped in the middle of the room and eyed the giant waste of money that surrounded him.
But there was more to it than that. They had fun needling each other and challenging each other, and Tony liked to show off and Steve liked to be showed-off to. Tony liked food, and Steve liked to eat, so Tony would take him to whatever high-end eatery or greasy spoon was attracting his gullet that day, sometimes even settling for those damned hot dog carts, and he really didn't want to know what was in those, but, god help him, sometimes those damned things hit the spot.
"Whatever." He broke Steve's hold on him and moved over to one of the suits. "OK, J," he called out. "How's the Mark, oh, XVII looking these days?"
They slid into a booth, opposite to each other, and after the tired-looking waitress took their order for coffees and left a couple menus, Tony scanned over his and said, "Pick anything you want.
But Thor just shook his head. "You fail to understand. You are not 'stuck' with one another. You are bonded with one another. You are the perfect balance to one another. In theory, bond mates do not actually need camaraderie or companionship from any other being, and they are often most happy when they are left to themselves without interference from others."
named Wilson or Barnes. "They work well together?"
"Then do it."
He was so into the design for the Mark… Shit, what was he up to now? XVII? Anyway, he was so into going over the design specs for the suit that he didn't even hear the Cap appear in the workshop until JARVIS had the temerity to turn down his music and announce the old man's presence. He saw the Cap had a bag of burgers with him that he held up — almost like a peace offering — and Tony bid him welcome and allowed him into the sanctuary.
Tony frowned and went to say he was insulted, but he took a quick look down at himself and realized.
They were left alone, and Steve just looked at him, bemused, head tilted, like he wasn't quite sure what he was seeing.
Steve looked from the open door down to his bare feet and then to Tony leaning over the seat and looking at him through the open window. He took one last look at his surroundings before he swallowed his pride and went over to the car.
Steve tossed his dress shirt to the floor then nodded at Tony's ensemble that had yet to be touched and said, "Off."
Steve could do nothing but laugh. "Tony, they're in their seventies by now!"
Tony folded his arms and tried not to think about what the discomfort in his pectorals implied. "Yeah, two things. First, not all couples do. Seriously, there are a ton of couples that should not even think about becoming parents. Second, clearly, you've fucked around here before, so you should realize that
"Did Jarvis know that you were, uh…"
Weirdly, while Tony had barely had a moment to himself the past couple days when Steve and the others were gone, the parade of visitors had completely ceased to exist as soon as Steve had made his return.
"Hmm?" he asked and set the clippers aside before he reached into the cupboard for a mug. "Yeah, I know. Ninety-six-years-old and you still don't know how to not put your foot in your mouth when you're talking to people."
Natasha just reached out and ran a gentle hand over his head, stroking it down his hair to his shoulders. "It'll be OK,
it, Steve! Fucking stick it in me!”
, but that's not how it worked where we came from. And honestly? You know, at first — when this all first happened — I…I think I was afraid. I don't think I did want to. I would have been happy staying in another room and letting the nurse come out and tell me it was a girl or a boy or even twins—"
me, but I don't think he hates me."
"Mmm..." Tony said with a nod as he drank another sip of coffee. "You notice the way she's been gnawing on her hand the past day or two? I'm just hoping the crankiness holds off until after Christmas is over."
Steve shot a look at him as the car began the ascent. "Stop that. That's not—"
Steve just grinned a little and said, "I look good for my age," before he turned back to the magazine, and Tony shrugged and murmured, "All right," and wrote down exactly what Steve had told him.
Tony made a face. "Whatever," he muttered. "What else did that little brat say?"
He made a slight face. "Uh…not tonight. Maybe tomorrow."
"Half-price cosmos," Pepper explained with a shrug, and Hill nodded her agreement then grabbed her purse and said, "I've got first round. What do you want?"
He winked at Tony then stepped on, and Tony stood there and stared at the elevator as the doors closed.
"Something like that."
you can be."
," Steve said and raised an eyebrow as he rocked the baby back and forth in his arms.
He swiped at some screens. "And why would I do that, buttercup?"
of your forms." She was silent a moment as she scrolled through, and her lips quirked into a slight smile. She glanced up at Tony and said with a touch of amusement in her voice, "'Asshole' isn't an actual medical condition."
"What?"
"You already said that."
"OK, good. Now, what's today's date?"
"Fuck you! That stuff just rolls right off my tongue."
Steve nodded his understanding then said, "Who do you want Maria to—"
He glanced down and saw that the way he'd folded his arms had both framed and pushed up his breasts, making them much more prominent than they'd been, even with the low-cut, short-sleeved button-down he'd borrowed from Pepper.
Tony took a sharp inhale of breath, and he said, "You have to. We have to trust each other. We've seen what happens when we don't. That can't happen— I will do everything in my power to make sure that doesn't happen here, and I know you — or
Probably taken with a cell phone.
He slid off Steve's waist and onto the mattress beside him. Steve's eyes shot open wide at the loss of contact, and he looked beside him to see Tony laying there, propped up on an elbow, shit- eating grin on his face, cock standing red and proud with a little bead of precome at the tip. Just that sight, just the sight of
"Uh, I was going to call
"I'm still surprised by the fact that there is one growing inside of you," Bruce said, and Tony sighed, his shoulders dropping, but Steve shot daggers at him, making Bruce wince and cower just the slightest.
on the team when we've got the fucking god of thunder?"
He was here and alive and warm and smiling and breathing and talking and just plain old
Rhodey exhaled a heavy sigh and said, "Whatever, man. Look, maybe this is all just a big misunderstanding—"
"I won't tell anyone," Bruce murmured.
"Pepper said she's the best."
He never realized how many people seemed to like Steve only because of the physical aspect — how big and strong he was or how attractive they thought he was. He knew those girls wouldn't have looked twice at the ninety-pound runt that informed the six-foot, two hundred pound super soldier, even if that ninety-pound runt was identical in spirit and personality. It was all about the appearance to them — the big, strong, powerful, steadfast Captain. And not just them but everyone, to be honest — everyone that had ever focused only on Steve's appearance and not on the man underneath the muscles.
"I just wanted to kiss you," he said, his voice dripping with faux sincerity.
Tony just stared at him and chewed on his lip a little in thought — totally not tying to be a come- on at all; seriously — before he nodded his head once and set the stylus down on the table.
"I helped," Steve muttered petulantly.
"Not as such."
"Yeah. Daddy says he'd like t' go back and wing his neck."
He cut a candy cane into the dough, but Tony just continued to stare at him, a concerned look spread over his face.
"No, you—"
was the one mistaken about the whole thing. "But I can't force you to believe me so…"
"What? Am I hideous? Are you ashamed to be seen with me?"
Tony tipped his head back and Steve crushed his mouth against Tony's, hard and fast and taking what he could from him, Tony giving and taking in equal parts.
"If this ever— If we ever have another— If something like this happens again, I don't care what crisis is going on in the world, you tell me if you're going into labor. I don't care if I have to talk you through it over a comm line, you tell me you're in labor."
But it wasn't just work. It was the personal angle, too. They had a shared fraternity in that they'd both been shaped, for better or worse, by Howard Stark. They were both men that had a public and a private persona that didn't always mesh. They were both men trying to do what they thought was Right for the world, even if they didn't always agree on the means to do it. And then there were the ways they balanced each other. Not just physically, though that was a given (
Look, the guy couldn't help it. It was what he was born with. But come on! This guy was clearly, firmly in the 'size doesn't count' column — he'd have to be with that pencil-dick — and Tony would have given him the benefit of the doubt if the man wasn't such a clear and total tool. Who was he trying to impress with that thing?
Tony swallowed again and said, "About what?"
Sam sighed out a resigned breath. "Yeah, all right. Fine. He can have it. But I still don't know why they chose practical strangers instead of us."
…" Steve murmured and hung his head. Tony just continued to sip his drink through his swizzle stick, but he reached over to pat Steve reassuringly on the back. Natasha looked at them in slight amusement, Rhodey shook his head, and Bruce made a face like he'd actually dared to picture that very thing and had horrified himself with the image.
Tony took another sip. "Why?" he asked as he pulled the cup away.
"—clearly you should be chained up and wearing nothing but a pair of gold lamé hot pants."
Tony nodded. "Exactly." He gave him another leer. "And you are indeed the best-looking ninety- seven -year-old I've ever had the pleasure of setting eyes on."
"Principle of the thing," Steve said and picked the bottle up. Tony couldn't even attempt to hide the look of disgust that came over his face, and Steve gave him a lopsided smile. "I have sucked you off, eaten you out, and rimmed you, and
"Exact same," Tony said, his joy cut short as the memory of what Steve had looked like then flashed in his mind: bloodied, bruised, tired, beat-up, and clearly coming from not exactly befitting a Saturday afternoon garden party.
Rhodey sighed again and said, "Tones, you know I love you both, but—"
"What's with the machine though?" she asked. She didn't sound concerned, just curious, but Tony swore he felt some sort of heightened unease vibrating from her. Romanoff liked to play like she didn't care, but she did, and the people she cared for she'd do anything for.
to pay attention to me."
"Tony?" Steve asked, frowning, that deep furrow formed between his brows.
So, why was he expected to keep it up now?
Before either Tony or Bruce could say anything, she ran over to the table beside the couch that Tony had put in the lab, and she stopped cold and stared at the table before she turned back and said, "Papa! That man stolded my pitcher!"
Tony shushed her and rubbed her back as she snuffled into his shoulder. "It's OK. Hey, it's OK. He's not here. There's no bad man here. It's just me and Uncle Rhodey. Even Uncle Bruce's turned in for the night."
He stepped off onto the floor once he'd arrived, surprised to find that the rest of the crew had seemingly disappeared, and Tony was alone restacking unwrapped presents beneath the tree. Steve moved over to him, fumbling for what to do with his hands before he just decided to fold his arms, and he stood just on the other side of a wall of presents and said, "Want some help?"
Rhodey snorted a laugh into his drink, and Wilson frowned and said, "I don't know, man. Not sure that one's really fitting at the moment."
Tony rolled his eyes and playfully slapped at Steve's face. "You're such a pain in the— Steve Rogers is
"Well? Are you going to come in?" she asked in a heavily-accented voice, not even bothering to look up from what she was writing. "Or are you going to stand in my door and let all my heat out?"
Bruce just shrugged like there wasn't anything to do or say about it.

Barton stared at him. "Dude, every sperm is sacred."
"Fine, but I didn't have a hole in my gut the size of Texas."
"Nothing
She hummed. "Well, not in
Steve was attempting to pull him out of the kitchen. "It really would be better…if we…went into the bed— ah,
, you know, the one that killed my parents."
But Barton was intrigued, and he quirked his head some and said, "I have to pay taxes on something like that?"
"What? Lock us both up in this tower like fucking Rapunzel?"
"I don't think he goes that way."
"About?"
Honestly, that was one tradition Tony was actually OK with partaking in.
Tony sighed out a breath and grimaced at a slightly sharper pain than he'd been accustomed to. Natasha watched him and then, when she'd judged the pain had passed for him, said, "You OK?"
"Maybe it's not labor?" he asked, bitter about the words. "Maybe it's just bad gas?"
Rhodey let out a sharp, piercing whistle, and they both stopped their bickering and turned to him.
"I do," Steve said without question. "Welch is an ass, but he knows the right people — or the right people that would tell him this stuff. Ross tried to get more super soldiers. As I understand it, he ended up with a Hulk and an Abomination—"
Strange.
"It's possible," Thor admitted, "but I have been alive for many hundreds of years, and in my youth, there was never any talk of these Infinity stones and what havoc they may wreak on our world. Oh, there was talk of them, of course — as a myth or a legend — but it is only recently that they have begun to make themselves known. I fear for what that may portend."
Tony pulled back to look at him. "Are you sure nothing happened down there?" he asked peering at him through suspicious eyes. "No strange entities visiting you and showing you some horrible vision of an apocalyptic future?"
Steve just stood a little straighter, broadening his shoulders and setting his jaw. "Why?" he asked, and Esmeralda winced from his cold, flat tone.
"Good. Fucking asshole sons-of— You know, you try to do something
Steve nodded and pulled down the covers then said, "I'm gonna go check the house again. Make sure everything's locked up."
"Baron von Strucker?" Tony said as he licked all the gelato off his spoon. "That's like a ridiculously obvious name for a bad guy. Like seriously, why not just call yourself Moustache-twirling McEvil-Doer? God, sounds like he should be wearing a monocle and have one of those hawk-noses — like Colonel Klink but actually evil."
"Look, I'm not— I'm not really crazy about the idea of you sticking it in me at the moment — again,
Make your pal Barnes earn his stripes. You stay here with me and fulfill my every whim and desire."
Steve just dropped his head some, stilling his hand over the swell of Tony's abdomen. He sucked in a breath and picked his head back up and said, "Doctors. Those…self-help things online."
"Yeah, I want something as appealing to the palate as that, I'll eat the cardboard box it comes in. Probably do less damage to my teeth, too."
They exchanged looks again, and Tony said, "Look, just because it worked for us doesn't mean it would work across the board."
Barnes blew out a breath and shook his head. "Only you, Steve. Only you could simultaneously end up with someone both too old and too young for you. It's like something out of Ripley's."
Steve just looked at him.
Stark made a strangled noise in the back of his throat, and Steve’s mouth twitched the slightest bit as he watched Stark’s Adam’s apple slide up and down as he swallowed once more. For all his bravado, Stark was clearly enticed by the prospect of Steve doing whatever it took to get him to fall in line.
"Fuck like rabbits?"
," in his ear, but the woman kept her focus on him and said, "Is this
They moved to another part of the large gymnasium, and Natasha stood and watched them depart before she stepped over to where Steve and Tony were on the mat, Steve at his hundred-twentieth pushup. She stood above them, arms folded but a gentle smile on her face as she said, "So, I hear you're going for an ultrasound later."
like a 'Natasha.'"
Tony kissed back but still had the temerity to say, "You were gone for, like, five minutes. You didn't just return from the war."
He tried to watch as Barnes went about setting it up for him, crouching down to lock the casters in place, but Bruce was on his other side and was saying something about he had an icepack for him, and Tony frowned and said a very eloquent, "Huh?"
"There was a verbal agreement—"
"I think I might."
"Here," he said and handed the cup to her, filled halfway with orange juice. "Try not to get it on yourself."
"What do you mean?"
He sighed out a breath. "Fine."
"The fuck it wasn't! You heard him. You heard him, Steve! He admitted it. He killed my parents."
Tony blinked as the silk fell away, and Steve put it on the nightstand and said, "For later," then took Tony's chin in his grasp and turned his head up toward him. "Look at me," Steve ordered, and he met Steve's hard, lustful gaze, but not before he let his eyes rake over the sight of Steve's cock, hard and erect, right in front of him, a bead of precome formed at the tip.
Tony pulled himself away from the wall and made sure to stand so that he had an escape route if need be, and he put his hands to his hips and looked at the creep that he was about five seconds away from kicking in the balls. Literally. He was really about to do it, and he was sure it wouldn't be to a more deserving fellow.
"What happened in Stuttgart?"
"I'll forgive you this one time," he said, but it was light and teasing, and though his mouth was set in a pout, his eyes twinkled with mischief and delight, and Steve thought for probably not the first time that day that Tony really did have beautiful eyes — maybe the most beautiful eyes he'd ever seen. He didn't even realize he'd been staring at them for as long as he had until Tony said, "See something you like?"
Olivia opened her mouth in a little yawn and cracked her eyes to look at him, and Tony reached out a hand and trailed light fingers against the top of her head and added, "But today is clearly not that day."
Steve shrugged. "You know how some stuff just sticks with you?"
"But if she touched you in any way that you don't feel was—"
you'd wear the princess down."
the one that said we couldn't get married until you'd finished planning your ridiculous bash—"
"Indeed," Thor said, happily shoveling grub into his mouth.
. Oh, he'd had 'friends,' but he'd never had actual
Steve met his gaze only a moment before he looked away, and he closed his eyes and mentally scowled at himself for allowing himself to feel so…so…
"Yeah?" Jim chimed in, fiddling with his napkin as he sat back in his chair. "Sounds like there's some things he didn't tell us."
"Are you sure?"
" JARVIS replied, and Tony nodded at him.
"We thought this place would be safe from Hydra's grasp. We thought even they wouldn't bother with anything here. We thought this could be a place where we could be just 'Steve and Tony' and not 'Captain America and Iron Man.' And with this one," he again motioned to the toddler on his lap, who was whining and struggling to get over to the bevy of gifts, "we thought it could be someplace we could… If things ever got bad enough, at least there would be this."
"Yeah, hey, don't mention it."
"Does she know you know the real Steve?"
"Fine," Steve said and pressed a kiss to Tony's forehead.

"That's rude," he said put got up and carried the forms back to the window. He handed the clipboard over, and the girl at the desk said, "OK, Ms. Carbonell, they'll call you back when they're ready."
He made his way back to the security station, where Bucky and Sam were in the middle of a heated argument over the merits of turning video games into feature-films, with Sam extolling the virtues of modern computer graphics while Bucky was sneering and reminding him that
Tony did exactly as told, and he felt the silken touch of the other scarf wrap around his wrists as Steve bound them together, tight but not anywhere near enough to cut off circulation. He took Tony's bound wrists and gently lowered his arms so that his wrists were resting against his belly. "Stand there," Steve said before Tony felt him move away, and the next thing he thought he heard was the bathroom light click on followed by the sound of running water. He remained standing, blindfolded, his bound wrists a comfortable and yet tantalizing weight against his belly, and in the anticipation of what he knew — or actually
Tony grimaced a little and adjusted how he was sitting. "My aching vagina would say that, yes, I pushed your ten-pound child out of my body the so-called 'natural' way. And, seriously, you'd think for something so
"Don't ask me!" Barton called out to him. "I didn't design it! Though I agree, it would be more convenient to have a bathroom on this floor, too."

Bucky was right. It

"That sounds like the cleaned-up version of something I'd say. Yeah."
"No, not really," she said and waved them through again, "but I know how sensitive you are about this. I thought you'd like to take every precaution."
," he said in that same sneering tone. "Or is it 'Miss United States'? Your defenders haven't been very consistent in their defense."
"Yeah, I picked," Steve said as he swiped to another page, but he side-eyed Tony and said, "That's a little fancy for sleeping, don't you think?"
"Oh," she said, accepting the simple truth of it before she set her spoon down and reached out for her juice.
birthday we're celebrating. It's our nation's birthday. Are you really that vain, Steven? Do you really think that song is about you?"
Tony sighed out a breath. "I don't know," he muttered. "I don't know what to call myself anymore. I look like this, but I
Steve's face blanched at that, and he began to sputter out several
," he muttered with an annoyed groan.
Natasha seemed to understand what he was trying for, and she reached down and helped him pull the baby up closer to his breast. Tony noticed that the umbilical cord still seemed to be attached to her, and he said, "Uh, I think we're still connected here."
this morning? Trying to get a feel to see if Tony

Steve glared at her. "It's gonna be his choice, right?"
Cap flashed a brief, tight smile at him but didn't say anything to that and instead asked, "Is that the issue?"
“Again.” Stark pointed to himself. “Not a follower.”
"What, Tony?"
"Yeah, well, more so than me," he said good-naturedly. "We live in an era where two fellas can get married now if they want to. I don't think anyone could ever have conceived of that back when Ma was still alive. I remember one of the last things she said to me was, '
Steve furrowed his brow. Tony had just vowed never to let Steve go until death, so it couldn't have been that—
Hill twitched a flat smile like he'd just confirmed her suspicions, and Steve stared at him and said a firm and terse, "Where were you when you said this?"
…or however they're measuring success nowadays."
Tony closed his eyes and settled into the stillness, but he sensed something was not sitting right with Steve, and he opened his eyes again and turned to face his lover, who, as he had figured, was lying beside him looking all sorts of disturbed and contemplative.
"What? Wait,
The pain. The hurt.
He arched an eyebrow. "So?"
"Whatever," he muttered after Steve had dropped his hand. "But still, I was…
' question.
dad, but I'm her dad, OK? I'm her dad."
"Well, I am." He shot another quick glance over at Tony. "I'm old enough to be your grandfather."
Barton dropped his fork on his plate. "And, I'm done."
"It's not that bad," Steve said, and Tony snorted.
"Who did you pick?" Bucky asked.
"Aye," Thor said, strolling into the conversation, dressed in a pair of board shorts and a garish Hawaiian-styled button-down, Mjolnir in hand. He set the hammer down on the coffee table, long, blonde hair flowing and small, thin braids swinging, and added, "I have explained to you many a time it is the bond that they share. It unites them and draws them to each other in ways those that are not bonded to another cannot understand. It is how the union of their souls manifests itself and draws its energy, reaffirming its bond and casting all others aside."
he would know what really kind of anyone's guess. Would he just keel over right then and there? Would he start to bleed from every orifice? Would he disintegrate?
"Any pics from any of my benders we can doctor up?"
"No," Tony said with a sigh, "and I've just now come to the conclusion that I've told you way too much already. They don't, but a couple of the others do. None of them live at the Tower with us, though, which is probably a good thing — for the kids, I mean. Safer that way. Livvy's the only one that's there all the time."
asking these stupid questions," Wilson muttered proudly under his breath. Natasha twitched a small, knowing smile at him but simply took a sip of her coffee instead of calling attention to it.
of extensive research and application."
The first few he flipped back through were of him and Olivia — sweet and innocent things like feeding or bath time or cuddling. There was one of Olivia sleeping in her bassinette and another of her resting in her highchair. He flipped back a few more pages and came face-to-face with himself as he'd looked in his later days of pregnancy — big breasts, big belly, and, well, in one picture a tub of gelato in one hand, a spoon in the other, and one hell of a scowl on his face. He flipped back a few more and realized he'd gone into the more 'R' bordering on 'X' rated drawings, Steve's imagination clearly having gone into overdrive from the lingerie Tony had sported around the time they'd gotten married. Tony saw himself in these pictures trussed up in tight lingerie and light bondage, pouty lips and bedroom eyes. Though these were nothing compared to the ones where he was completely naked, knees bent, one hand between his legs, the other fondling one of his breasts, and his head thrown back, dark hair flowing and ecstasy on his face, and— Fuck, was that a vulva? Wait, was that his— Was that what he'd looked like down there?

things with him.
"You're not really being—"
Tony just blinked at him. "I'm sorry. Have we met?"
"Lost?"
Tony stroke and play with himself? He could still see that look of wanton desperation in Steve's eyes, the pupils blown so wide as to make his blue eyes look almost black in the dim light, the way he'd tentatively reached out a hand, so desperate to
"Hey, Pepper-pot."
"Why do I think you already do?" Natasha asked.
"I don't know," he replied and didn't open his eyes. "Just preparing to be violated again, I guess."
He shrugged and looked down at the baby in his arms. "Maybe," he said, almost like he was embarrassed to say the words. Yeah, just like he'd
"I don't know, Tones," Rhodey said. "Kinda getting the feeling this other you is sort of happy with how things turned out."
"It's the principle of the thing," Natasha said, and Tony bit into his slice of toast. "Captain America isn't marrying Iron Man—"
"Oh," he said with a nervous laugh. "Oh, well. I guess you can just toss it unless you want to use it for something else."
"I don't know about you, but I'm kinda not in a partying mood any longer."
"I used to be a dude," he repeated, and the guy snorted a laugh and said, "The fuck you were. Not with a rack like this."
"I forgot to polish these."
"Would you like that?" he asked after a few minutes of working Tony open, watching as Tony lay back, eyes closed, bliss and relaxation and desperate want playing out over his face.
"It's not that," he said as he moved from gazing over a poster of a cross-section of the female breast to one showing the placement of various parts of the female reproductive system in relation to a full-term fetus. "It's just how…
Rhodey was just shaking his head like he was rethinking his life's choices.
"You wanna put money on that, old man?"
"They both sound fine," Tony said at the same time Steve said, "'Sarah Maria' does sound better," and Tony rolled his eyes.
Steve shook his head. "Nope. Not until after."
"Probably almost ten hours. Don't worry," Natasha said, the hint of a soft, loving smile on her lips. "We didn't forget about you."
going to someplace like that by myself! Are you kidding? No, the only reason I agreed to this stupid thing was because Steve said he would go with me. If Steve's not going with me, I'm not going. Period."
He twisted something on the exoskeleton for the suit and scowled as the pliers slipped and jammed into his opposite hand.
Other Tony dropped his hand and shrugged a little, like he wasn't sure how to explain it, and Tony eyed him a moment as he tried to discern the sincerity of his words before he began to collect the photographs and set them back in the box they'd been brought in.
"And you didn't ask him to go into more detail because—?"
The King was being obstinate as he was wont to do. He did not see it as a priority to produce an heir to the throne. This may be all well and good now when the King was still relatively young and in good health, but he would not always be so. He also had a bad habit of running off with Sir Steven and his

Barton shrugged and turned back to the stove. "In the face," he replied. "Your face is fuller, kinda fleshed out. That's one sign."
, he told himself, something warm inside him thrumming at the thought.
And yet, if the reports were true and Steve really was… It seemed
Steve just shrugged and waved off his concern. "Then why bother? Worry about making a good impression when there's someone here to be impressed."
this was, then said, "Something about a shower. I remember something about a shower."
"What?"
He shook his head like the rest of the thought didn't matter before he exhaled a heavy breath like a weight had finally lifted from his chest, and he rubbed both his hands over his face then looked at Tony and said quietly, almost sadly, "And maybe if he hears that from
He shook his head. "No, not— It wasn't that. That was… I still can't believe I said those words. I'm not sure I do believe it. It's just… It's nothing."
"Yeah, I know but I couldn't help but notice you were kind of half-hard when you got out of the bed, and I'm pretty sure I felt nine inches of
Being pregnant at least helped stem some of the desire — not because he craved it any less but because he knew he couldn't have any. He was not that awful a human being that he would chance fucking this kid up before it was even born, no matter how…unorthodox its existence even was. Plus, Steve would outright kill him if he ever did anything like that. OK, Steve wouldn't
"So, no matter the answer, you would have been insulted," Tony supplied for him.
"I know you haven't suddenly become one of those 'life begins at conception' types." He shot a surreptitious glance at Steve then said, "Is someone forcing you to—?"
"Yeah, maybe 'Daddy' isn't the right term to use in light of...not-so-recent developments."
"I told you, I started it a couple weeks ago," Steve said. "I didn't— I mean, I didn't think you would…"
Bruce returned exactly ten minutes after he'd left him alone, bringing along an ice pack while Barnes lugged in what looked like the simple white wicker bassinette he'd secretly been coveting since the covert three-am window shopping binge he'd treated himself to on one of those nights when he just couldn't sleep and Steve was snoring like a chainsaw. He didn't buy anything out of respect for Steve's neurotic wishes, but he'd bookmarked the shit out of everything he was planning to buy the minute the doctor gave him the OK that everything was fine with him and the little monster that had been making
" from Pepper.
Tony snorted a laugh. "I thought you were taking my husband away from me."
Tony rolled his eyes. "That was sexual innuendo, Steve," he muttered and popped the fry in his mouth. He chewed it and said, "I was trying to insinuate you like to suck brain."
"Don't really have much of a choice, jolly green. Nefarious sorts are targeting my tower, and I take that kind of personally."
Olivia.
DUM-E beeped a little in recognition as Steve patted his support strut, and Barnes stared at Steve and said, "You're talking to it like it can actually understand you."
Tony shrugged. "What can I say? I love the guy. I'm just…not sure I—"
"Not my wish, J," he said and began to search for something that resembled a waffle iron. "That's what Olivia wants you to call her, so that's what you're going to call her." He stood straight and frowned, hands on hips. "Hey, you know offhand if we've got a waffle iron in this joint?"
He swallowed the bite and nodded at the door. "That little blue piece of paper."
was a pro at parallel parking; Steve…was not), and he sat there and only then remembered to check his bag to make sure he had everything he needed.
"You had a family, too," Tony said, and the Cap looked up like he couldn't believe had so easily read his mind. He blinked, his face drawn in wonder and…
Sam fake gasped, and Bucky's eyes went wide as he said, "You take that back!"
It was a long drive back to the city, a good deal of which he spent speaking into thin air under the guise that he was talking to his underdeveloped fetus because...why not? No one else to talk to.
"Think you ordered enough there?" he asked as he took his burger and fries.
Tony didn't know if it was a cry for help, but he didn't see any harm in taking it that way. "Whatever he's paying you, I'll pay double."
"I missed you, too," Steve said and pressed a kiss to the crown of Tony's head.
"Then why do you think you would feel it now?" she asked like she was exasperated from dealing with an idiot.
"I never drank Postum!" he said like Tony had just uttered the most vicious lie about him. He went quiet a moment then added a little reluctantly, "My ma made me drink it a few times— but I never did it willingly! Some people used it as a coffee substitute during the war because coffee was rationed."
he could open his mouth and offer to do something that might lead to him, someday, maybe, somewhere down the road, having a life very similar to that other Tony's life: married to a super soldier, father to a precocious, talkative four-year-old that only ate the cheese off her pizza and liked to draw and tell stories.
"Well, I can't speak for them. You booked it under an assumed name, right?"
flooded his mouth with the stuff.

." He put a hand over his mouth. "Good Christ," he muttered, dropping his hand away. "I can't believe those words came out of my mouth."
"Yeah, well," he shrugged, deciding to play off Thor's words rather than allow himself any introspection through them, "work with what you got."
what he was doing? "Something about saving the whales—"
Barnes looked at him, and he blinked then said, "Yeah, I think so. Think that's what I meant. Steve was…a stubborn son-of-a-bitch—"
"And incidentally, the benefits and retirement package
European dining customs, OK? I wasn't raised in a barn. Are we currently
"What?"
"Buck," Steve muttered with a sigh, "I really wish you'd stop calling me—"
. You're someone to love and protect and yell at and talk to and get into trouble with. Steve looked lost — really lost and alone — when he first came out of the ice. There were times I thought he might try to take out another iceberg. I haven't seen him look that way since you and he got your heads out of your asses." She shrugged. "But again, it's a blessing and a curse."
He swallowed and took a deep breath then straightened up, seeing DUM-E's claw raised in concern, and he tweaked a smile at the 'bot and said, "Don't worry, you overgrown erector toy. Daddy's just…"
"We're not back to that, are we?" Steve mused. "Yes, Tony, I love you. And I'm proud of you and amazed by you and don't ever want to imagine my life without you."
Jesus, when did he become so…
"That," Tony said, pride shining in his voice, "is our future Rhodes Scholar right there."
Tony rolled his eyes, and he thought about texting Natasha or Bruce to see what was going on back in New York, but he knew texting them at seven o'clock on a Saturday night was just asking for twenty questions about what was wrong and what was going on.
Barnes made a face, rolling his eyes and shaking his head at what he presumably thought was Tony's thick-headedness. "He's not— Hill asked Clint if they had Steve, and Clint said, yeah, they did."
"Because she looks like you. Aren't you, um... Didn't you, uh,
There was a twitch of a smile on her lips, and her eyes crinkled just the slightest as she said, "Hormones," then nodded her head at the suit. "Get dressed. See you at the 'jet."
"Whatever. I'm out."
The hell he couldn't pretend. He was doing a bang-up job of it so far, and why the fuck should he have to mourn it? He'd only had it for two days, yeah, but it wasn't like he was something he actually wanted
Natasha stayed behind with Pepper and the PA, but Steve followed them over, and arms folded tight against his chest and hands tucked into his armpits, he looked around the setup and over to the doors to the conference and said, "You know, you really don't have to do it this way."
He started to stand from his chair, but Bruce said, "Actually, it's not until the end of the day."
"I don't think it's Hammer," Rhodey said with a sigh. "I think she's just tired and overworked and disappointed that she can't be at your wedding. Wouldn't you be disappointed if it was the other way around and you couldn't go to her wedding?"
"But you still think of yourself as a man," Bruce said. "A man in a woman's body."
Steve glanced up at him. "Sure. What?"
He turned around in Steve's arms, and he looked up and said, "Positive. Make love to me. Like we used to. Before this whole crazy thing started. Take me out of my head. I want you inside me in the way that cannot possibly get me pregnant again."
," Steve grumbled as he shoved another bite of food into his mouth.
He whistled a little and set it on the counter, and from her perch at the table, Olivia leaned over a little and said, "That's not the right one, Papa."
"Tony, I don't think he's actually calling you
That shut Steve up for all of a second before he said, "And what if we ripped it out right now? Just got rid of what you put there?"
He just shrugged at them as they crowded onto the elevator, and as the doors began to close, Steve
"Well, if the crazy space lady said so…"
"How is he?" he asked without preamble. "Is he OK?" His arm was wrapped with gauze, a rust- red splotch of blood visible on it, and Bruce was tending to the wound in his stomach, applying gauze pads while Natasha ran an intravenous line.
"Clearly one deprived of oxygen at birth."
"No!" Steve defended, loud and firm, perhaps to counter the little voice in the back of his head that said yes. "No, not because... Because, honestly, you're a little possessive of that baby, and sometimes I think I'm not good enough to pick her up."
"I feel like I need to have a lighter out," Tony said and made the hand motion for holding a lit lighter up. "I mean, isn't it customary for this song?" he added, but Steve shushed him, and he huffed and sat back in his seat, watching as they passed through green light after green light on the drive uptown, waiting for the long guitar solo that followed through the end of the song. No way did Steve enjoy
" Happy asked. "
Tony just stood there, kneading his hands together, not daring to look at any of the three that were staring at him. He swallowed and fumbled for something to do with his hands before he finally settled on folding his arms, and he held them tight in that space between his breasts and his belly and took several short breaths, some awful feeling welling up from within. He clenched his jaw and blinked repeatedly to dispel the tears that threatened to fall, and when Bruce tried to say once again how sorry he was, Tony snapped out, "
'know' it's a boy. You're assuming it's a boy because of a piece of paper on the fridge that wasn't necessarily about this."
tell him his correct shirt size."
Steve parted his lips almost on instinct, and Tony took his bottom lip between his teeth and tugged on it just the slightest. Then he grinned so much that his eyes crinkled and his nose scrunched a bit, and he laughed and said, "Come on. Some of us still have coffee left."
Tony patted him on the back. "Those are stockings, babe, not leggings. Style of the times. Mini dresses were all the rage. Think I've even seen a picture of my mother wearing one. I mean clearly these ladies have the legs to pull it off and
Steve huffed out a breath and threw off the covers, and Tony saw then he was partially hard. He ran his gaze over the outline of Steve's cock, and Steve got out of the bed and walked over to him, crowding him, and Tony felt every bit of their five-inch difference in heights as he did so.

other half. Again, this
"Huh?"
When Tony's milk came in, it came in with a vengeance.
"What? Getting hit on by every douchebag in the tri-state area? Having to think about how to actually hold my arms when I fold them?
"But it could be."
It had been a while since he and Steve had 'played.' It wasn't that either one was hesitant to; it was just that they never seemed to find the time, and it wasn't the sort of thing they liked to rush.
He startled a bit and looked at the door. Yes, that was definitely a little man figure on the door, and he glanced down at his rather visible cleavage — and so did the stock broker — and said, "Oh, yeah, right."
Tony just snorted out a laugh. What the hell was JARVIS doing?
