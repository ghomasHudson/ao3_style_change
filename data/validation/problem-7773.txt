“That you’re gay, of course!” She said as it was so obvious to everyone.
“I’m so glad you came, Tony. I’m pleased to meet you,” Peggy said, sitting on the couch, pulling Tony with her.
"Look who's talking!" Tony mumbles feeling Steve's lips curls upwards at the compliment between their kiss.
They lived downtown, so the street was crowded with people enjoying this amazing night. Couples kissing, or sat on a table drinking, young people listening to some music out loud on their car while drink with friends, families eating in a pizzeria, and laughing. It all seemed so unreal, but at the same he knew he was living in it. Steve's tip fingers touching his smoothly and discreetly, a smile playing on his lips, the blond was happy, and so was Tony. They couldn't hold hands in public, Tony needs to remember himself all the time that they were trapped in the 70s, but Tony promised to himself that once they get back to 2023, he would always hold Steve's hand in public, proudly.
The lights turn on the exact moment Tony finishes his improvised bomb, when an alarm sounds loud and strident.
"None of this is your fault, Tony. You saved us."
"Blueberry."
"They can't keep doing this."
Tony wants to comfort the blond, hugs him, kisses him endless times. Tells him that he always had his heart. Oh God, they were such fools. They've been playing around all this time, when they could've been together a long time ago, if they only have admitted their feelings before, their hearts always belonged to each other.
Steve's voice is hoarse and sleepy. Tony wishes he could sleep just like Steve was doing a few minutes ago before Tony sighed exasperatedly for his own lack of sleep. That's his fault, wake Steve, he means. He also knew that the painkiller was the reason for Steve being so sleepy. Tony probably should take some of them, perhaps he would fall asleep. The brunet sighed anew.
“I’m sorry about your parents.”
The fact is, they kissed for the first time two weeks ago, and since then they were inseparable. They have been seeing each other a lot, having dinner together, going out after work, Tony got the habit of picking him up almost every day, and when Steve wasn’t busy helping Bucky with the wedding plans, he’d probably be out with Tony. Tony took him out to the places he liked the most in NY, like that nightclub in the middle of Manhattan, which Steve had to admit he had plenty of fun, but only because Tony was with him. On the other hand, Steve liked to sketch Tony when they went to Central Park, or sometimes a photograph, even when Tony jokes that Steve has a lot of pictures of him, and he still didn’t think it was enough.
"It's a bunker, it's fortified and safe, also, it's unknown, it doesn't appear in any documents, it's on my family for generations,. It was built before World War I," Steve nods seeing Tony puts the briefcase in the middle of a shelf with a lot of old metallic pieces, the briefcase would easily pass unseen for someone who isn't looking for it. Steve must looks concerned because Tony says. "Don't worry. No one comes down here for years, maybe decades, and it'll remain like this. Let's go?" Tony tilted his head in the door's direction.
"Not now," Tony mumbles, but he is also impatiently.
He decides to start making lunch without Steve, he is not going to blow up the apartment, he is sure of that. In fact, he does not blow things up quite a while now, he smiles at the thought while some improvement ideas to the Iron Man armor runs through his mind.
Steve looked at him, a small smile forming on the corners of his lips when Tony leaned in and met his lips in a tender kiss. Opening their lips slowly, enjoying the simple contact between them, before his tongue slipped in Tony’s, involved in the warmth of the model’s mouth. Brief, when they pulled away, pressing their foreheads together as Tony traced his thumb on Steve’s jawline.
He stops right in front of Tony, his arms open wide. A slight frown between his eyebrows, a sign that we did not like being contradicted.
Steve feels a growl coming up in his throat, he wanted to correct the brunet, says that he had already chosen. Although, Tony didn't. But he couldn't say it, he couldn't do it.
Tony's brown eyes sweep the room. He notices that the bag he had brought from their old apartment was zipped, everything they had collected since they got stuck in 1970 was in that bag, already packed. Tony mentally thanked Steve for that.
Steve pushes a Hydra agent against one of the desks in the lab. The man falls on it, breaking glasses filled with chemicals, spreading it all on the desk and the floor. Another man comes over Steve hitting him on the shoulder, right where the bullet wound is healing. Steve grunts in pain, quickly recovering himself and knock out the man.
“Horrible child,” Tony told him with a smile.  He crossed the room, squinting up at one of the door panels.  He reached up, his fingers poking at the hinges.  “I do not know what I’ve done to deserve such disdain.”
“Probably won’t work.”  Steve smiled, and Tony found himself smiling back.  “I’d say he broke this lock within days of moving in here,” he said.  “He’s used to slipping out.  He’s had enough practice at Hammer’s place.”
Laughing, Steve leaned over to brush a kiss on her cheek.  “I never doubted it,” he said, affection sweeping over him.  “Now, stop harassing the team.”
“Are you joking right now?” Tony asked.  He snagged Peter by the back of the shirt and force marched him towards the library door.  “It's like you know the script, but don't know what your role is.”
“Not right,” DJ mumbled, his fingers tight on the pamphlet.  The paper crumbled under the force of his grip.  “It’s-”  He shook his head.  “Not right.  Not-”
Steve's eyes fluttered shut. “We're... Going to be here for a long time?”
“Nothing,” she said.  “There were tire tracks at the north gate, but no sign of forced entry there.”
Jan patted her on the shoulder.  “And we're going to teach you how to do it gracefully.”
“Fine,” Steve said.  He stomped his way down the metal staircase.  “We clear?”
Clint threw himself into his chair, and a corn dog went bouncing across the table.  “Fuck, yeah,” he said, taking a bite from the one in his hand.  “You need?”  Darcy’s head jerked in DJ’s direction, and Clint’s eyes followed the gesture.  “Desert time?”
Preferably after a lot of coffee.
“Oh.” She looked at Tony.  “Who does?”
Jarvis passed within his field of vision, giving Tony a speaking look from beneath the arch of his eyebrows.  “I agreed to assist in preventing the youngest member of our household from barging into your room at all hours of the day or night.  I did not agree to assist you in-”  He paused, his eyes rolling towards the ceiling as he unwound the muffler from his neck.  “Defiling every room in this house.”
Jesse yawned.  “I got lucky.”
Steve picked up a toy car. “He might break something.”
Steve took a deep breath.  “You’re sure.”  His voice seemed to come from a long way off.  Tony nodded, and Steve looked away.  “Why are you telling me?”
“As it turns out,” Tony said, trying for dignity, “teasing a humorless stick like that is boring.”
It felt like home anyway.
There were a half a dozen people there, maybe more, PAs and techs, and out of the corner of his eye, he saw Joy getting her hair touched up, saw Ellen talking to Victor, but really, there was only one person who mattered, only one person he really saw.
Grinning, DJ reached for a pair of paper wrapped chopsticks.  “It’s hard,” he said.
“First of all, yes, I am, I have a good dozen magazines that I subscribe to simply because at one point or another they did, in fact, put that in print, and second of all, this is more sarcasm than I'm used to handling from you on the average day,” Tony said.  The gel inside the test tube threatened to boil over, and he fumbled for a pair of tongs.
“Just a hypothetical question here,” she said, rocking her chair back on its rear legs.  “Say there was a tray of like, egg rolls in there.  What would you do?”
“Good luck!” Maya called after him, and DJ tried not to tense up at that.
"And that is not a question," Jarvis said, his face a polite mask.  But there was something like laughter in the words, a note of unholy glee that Steve didn't really understand.
"Peter seems like a logical and level headed boy," Rogers said, and Tony burst out laughing.
“It's Christmas morning,” Steve said.  He turned the tablet around so Tony could see it.  “Look what Santa brought me.  It's our Christmas card for next year.”
“Sass does not become you, Jarvis,” Tony told him.  “I repaired it last month.”
“And Natasha will be keeping an eye on all of us,” she agreed.  She waved at the door.  “All right, boys.  Now that we’ve all seen that Mr. Stark is doing just fine, I think it’s time for bed.”
Steve smiled at him.  “How're you doing?” he asked.
“My undying devotion and affection?” Steve tried.
Furbro appeared around the edge of the stairs, his tail swishing as he considered them.  Tony held out a hand, and the cat wandered over, rubbing delicately against his fingers.  “This wasn’t what I planned,” he said, his scratching Furbro under the chin.  “None of this was what I planned, Steve.”
“Why in the name of all that’s holy am I awake?” Tony asked.  Steve was still laughing, his face buried in the back of Tony’s shoulder. Tony reached back, trying to pat his hair with a clumsy hand.  “I do not want to be awake.”
"I'm considering it," she admitted, as Jan tucked a yellow and red rose into his pocket.  "She's very good at nudging you in the right direction."
“Huh?” Ellen asked.
“Yeah, that’s probably the truth.”  Clint said.  “But he just kind of nodded, and went back upstairs.  Came back fifteen minutes later with Miss Potts and Mr. Stark.  And all three of them stared at us.”  He crossed his arms over his chest.  “So I pick up a biscuit, and I cut it in half, put it on two plates and cover both of ‘em with gravy.  Then I sit down, and start eating.
"Take the risk, kid, she's usually trustworthy."
"No.  Just...  Always achy."  He made a face as he shifted his weight forward and back, trying to find a comfortable place in his own body.  It seemed to ellude him more and more these days.  He sighed.  Being a bot was so much easier.  "Always."
Jarvis inclined his head.  “Of course, sir.  Enjoy your breakfast.”  He paused, pulling a flower out of his lapel and handing it to Tony.  “Good day, sir.”
Tony nodded. “I was thinking of ripping his shirt off.” He shrugged. “Licking something.”
“The two of you look like you've been to war, and you haven't even had to deal with the press yet,” Pepper said, her voice tart.  She picked up her tablet from the side table, her fingers sliding over the shining surface.  “I'm going to need you to pull yourselves together, the press release has gone out and the internet is losing its collective mind.”
Steve dragged him down, his fingers tangled in the fabric of his own shirt, and tried not think about the morning.
Steve shook his head.  "The world's hard enough, right now.  It's like the politicians who open soup kitchens when they want the press, when they want the votes, then shutter them when they're not useful to 'em anymore."  The more frustrated he got, the worst his accent got, the street kid still there, fists clenched, just under the surface.  He shook off the thought.  "And who cares about the men who'd depended on that meal?"
Tony's eyes closed.  “I'm sorry I snapped at you,” he said.
“Of course, sir.  Don’t worry.  I know just how to enlarge the recipe to make sure there’s enough for two.”
Tony spared him a glance as he plodded off, then went right back to his phone.  “You could just arrest her,” he pointed out to the Agent.
He stumbled forward one step, and another, his body swaying with every awkward movement.  But the light was there, just out of reach, coaxing him forward.  It rose and fell, it pulsed like music, like something, something very familiar-
Stark nodded, shoving the car door open. “All right,” he agreed.  He leaned out the door.  “Just give the urchin a nickel and send him on his way, Steve!” he called as he slid out.
Curious.  Unconcerned.  Almost amused.  DJ glanced desperately over his shoulder, but he was alone.  Just him, and the thing that was crawling across the ceiling, across the walls.  The thing that was reaching for him.
The silence that followed that felt thick.  Hard.  He struggled to draw a breath, and it hurt.  His mouth worked, and nothing came out, and he hated that and he was grateful for it all at once.
“With Stephen.” Natasha let the bottle fall back to her side, and Clea offered her a slight smile.  “He was-”
“Steve?”  He heard Tony sigh.  “Not a problem.”
He held up the cereal box.  “I ate your Trix.”
Jarvis paused.  “Yes,” he said at last.  “I suspect that might be the case.”  He lifted the domed lid from the tray.  “It will happen in circumstances like this.”
“Know what?” Tony nodded, his eyes falling shut. “Same.”
“A few hours ago.”
Tony groaned, trying to push his head further under his pillow.  “No.”  Behind him, he heard Steve start to laugh, and he aimed an elbow in that general direction.
Sam peered over his shoulder.  “Pirates,” he said, with a nod.  “Awesome.”
Steve watched, curious now, as the boy glanced at Clint, and then at the basket of turnovers.  There was a pinched tension around his mouth, his knuckles white as he gripped his cap.  He was perhaps fourteen, or fifteen at most, and his sleeves were just an inch too short for his arms.  His wrists were all bone, and Steve wondered if the rest of him was as skinny beneath the weight of his uniform.
“Hey.  Stay inside,” Steve called, but it was too late.  Before he could say another word, DJ had wiggled through the narrow gap and disappeared out into the night.
“What?”  Tony blinked at him.  “Wait-  What, what do you-”
Aimsbridge took it with a smile. “Victor Aimsbridge. I'm honored to meet you, Captain.”
“I think you should hit up some sympathetic voices for an interview or two where you ask for privacy in this time of transition, do a few social events together,” Marcy said, brisk and efficient.  “You'll have a nice photo op or two where you act the way you always do, but now it all seems very romantic.  You keep running the Avengers, you keep things together, and then in six months, after you're yesterday's news and everyone's moved on to the next hot Hollywood scandal, get a quiet, no-contest divorce.”
"A bacchanalia," Tony said to Pepper.  "A lovely party.  With signs.  And chanting."
The helmet tipped forward and back, the sunlight smoothing over the polished surface.  “I know you like to be in the driver's seat,” Steve said, and Tony froze, his skin going cold in an instant.  Steve shifted forward in his seat hie eyes locked on Tony's face.  “But trust me.”  His eyes were brilliant, fathomless and a far darker blue than Tony remembered.    “Just this once.”  Steve's hand came up, the helmet dangling from his first two fingers.  “Trust me.”
Al blinked at him. "But-"
Jess stopped.  Set the comb down.  “Really,” she said, and there was a note to that one word that brought Steve’s head up.  Greer twisted in her chair, her eyes going wide.  “Really.  You got a date, did you?”
Tony held up the vase, and he was smiling.  “Yeah, you’re about the fifth person to contribute an arrangement,” he said.
“It's not an attempt,” Pepper told him.
“Why is Clint in the trunk?” Steve asked, his eyes squeezed shut.
Harris stared, confused, as the Roomba rotated and floated right back where it had come from.  Another bump, another rotation, and he realized, something, or someone was pushing it.  Nudging it.  The way he did.  And the Roomba just kept going right back.
"Sure." Steve retorts helping Tony to clean the floor.
"Oh, really? As you said just minutes ago, no one has my expertise nor my technology. When your fucking system reboots I'll be already far from here. Now give me the damn keys!"
"Uh, sure. I'm not sure if I can stand up right now." Tony mumbles laying his head on the pillow again, his dark hair with some strands of grey falling over his forehead.
"Guess we have a lot of work to do," Steve said turning and kissing his lips.
Steve buried his nose on Tony’s neck, breathing in deeply the Omega’s scent before Thor let go of his arms, Steve wrapped them around Tony, pulling the Omega, if possible, even closer to him. The Alpha breaths out the calming and familiar scent of mint and coffee. It's an odd scent but it pleases Steve a lot. He places a kiss on the bonding mark on Tony’s neck before pulling away, cupping Tony’s face.
Steve chuckles.
The lights of the laboratory were off, it seems no one was in there, he reaches the knob, closed. Steve frowned confused, Tony said he had a vague idea, then that he was almost sure, and frankly, Steve trusted in Tony so hard, he couldn't be wrong, right? Maybe Doctor Pym was out for lunch or something else.
Steve turns with a smile to the billionaire, but Tony has a hand over his chest, he's panting and his body is mid-fold. Steve's eyes switch from joy and adrenaline to concern.
"I got it." He said showing the greenish envelope in his hand. Steve's gaze change between Tony's face and the envelope.
“Okay. See you, then.” Steve answered, in which Bucky said ‘bye’ before the line stayed mute.
"Pym Technologies stays in San Francisco. We should head there as soon as we can." Tony says calling Steve's attention.
It doesn’t take long to Steve comes after that, Tony's wall milking him dry, and his knot swells, stretching Tony’s hole even more before Steve comes hot inside of Tony, his knot locking them together. Steve lets his head rests against Tony’s chest and the Omega drops a gentle kiss, stroking his blond hair. They really need to get back to the tower before Tony hits the second wave of heat.
"They do not give in," Tony mutters.
“Okay. You can text me or call me if you do,” Natasha replied, stapling Steve’s document together.
Steve chuckles, shooking his head while he leaves the bathroom to save his boyfriend before Tony sets fire in the building.
"St-Steve, I need you -- inside me." Tony stammers.
“I proposed to Peggy,” it was all that Bucky said, a timid grin on his face. “She said yes.” Steve threw his bag on the couch, almost unable to contain the happiness and excitement he was feeling.
"Well, thank you." The boy turns back to return his activities and Tony starts making his way to the elevator, but turns back. "Hey, kid!" He shouts, the boy turns around to look at him. "Go break some eggs." Then, Tony turns back smiling nostalgically.
He lost his train of thoughts when a group of friends enters the cafeteria talking too loud, after they gained a few angry stares of the other costumes, Tony included, they sat down and talked in a tone of voice more acceptable.
"I'll be back soon,"
Bucky observed Steve from the corner of his eyes when he took his place on the couch, quickly putting Bucky’s feet on his lap. The dark-haired didn’t look away from the TV in front of him, where a journalist talked about another robbery in a bank this week.
Tony gets the needle to stitches the wound. Both of them grimace at the sight of the pointy object.
Oh, right. That, of course, the main reason for this whole mess.
“Yes.” Steve gulped.
Carol stretched a hand over the counter, touching Wanda’s shoulder and giving a light squeeze.
great. Steve tasting every inch of his mouth, Tony letting his hand sliding on Steve's side pulling him closer, their bodies appreciating this proximity, Steve's hand going and resting on the back of Tony's neck, deepening the sensation.
"What's the matter?" Tony asks, his eyes following every move Steve makes. The supersoldier puts the bottle on the counter harsher than it needed. His blue eyes turn to him sharply.
Steve sat close to Tony on that fancy couch as Tony asked Jarvis to put on the show Steve just mentioned. The soldier repeated it out loud, and the screen lit up with The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel's first episode. Steve went to get his camera and bag he had dropped in the kitchen when Tony tripped. Steve threw the bag over his shoulder. He was just passing next to the counter on his way back to the living room when he saw a few not open correspondences on it. Steve glanced at them longly, noticing the logo in the front of it.
Steve grins. A smile that makes Tony's heart melt and he can't believe that once he wanted to punch those perfect white and shining teeth.
He bit the cushion as the burn appears around the ring of muscles, and he doesn’t even care when Steve quickly pushed another finger inside him. They’re eager for it, and they wanted it as fast as possible. Steve worked his fingers in and out of Bucky, opening him up nicely.
Thank y'all for reading!
“Steve.”
“On your knees,” Steve whispered. That was an order and as a soldier, Bucky knew very well how to follow orders from his superiors.
His father used to drink, sometimes, a lot. Tony had seen where it had led Howard Stark. He spent some much time, made such an effort, for not being like his father that he hasn't realized that he, in fact, became him. And Tony hated it, so much, he hated himself for all the mistakes he had made. He could forgive anyone, even Steve's betrayal, but he couldn't forgive himself for the harm he had caused to thousands of people.
"Maybe, uh, recognize you?" Tony shrugs.
"We will." Steve approaches and holds Tony arms squeezing it slightly. "We always do. This time is not gonna be different. We just need to wait till Pym comes back from the trip." Tony let out a sigh, Steve let go of him and Tony rubs his hand over his own chest, where the arc reactor used to be, a gesture that Steve had noticed a few times.
What the hell he had in mind to keep that secret from Tony? He should've trusted him, he should've told about his parents' murderer, Tony probably would've understood it and everything would be different from now. They wouldn't have spent the last seven years without talking, and right now, Steve couldn't stop blaming himself for it. The past can't be changed, but he could build a future with Tony, learn from his mistakes, and try to be better.
“What’s holding you then?” Steve asked curiously.
"Let's go."
"You go in. I stay here in case of having to deal with uninvited people." Tony whispers.
Tony shrugged, throwing some pills in his mouth and drinking a glass of water. Steve frowns slightly, Tony hasn’t complained about any pains on the way to the Tower. Anyway, whatever those pills are, he hoped Tony would be okay. And maybe that’s why Tony wasn’t into sex today. They had a long, long day of work.
"There" he manages to say but a moan comes out of his mouth, however, Steve seems to get what he said because the blond keeps thrusting in the exact spot. "Harder." And Steve obeys his command. Steve pulls out and goes back deeper inside him, moaning so loud that those thin walls will never be capable to muffle it.
04:32 a.m.
"Yes. Sure, he must've mentioned it." The soldier waved off while putting his hands inside of the pants' pockets. "Do you have an idea when he'll be back?" Stark nods negatively, he seems a little suspicious.
Steve looks in horror.
Steve moves slowly, thrusting inside of him. Steve grunts from pleasure, his eyes closed while he slides his hands to Tony's hips, keeping the brunet steady while he thrusts again harder this time, Steve's cock deepening further inside of his hole. Tony pulls Steve closer for a needy kiss that the supersoldier gently gives back, his nails sliding on Steve's lower back, the blond moan, thrusting again.
“Oh, fuck,” Bucky said, when Steve’s hands went to his shoulders, sending away any tension that could still be there. His fingers traced the scar that joined Bucky's metal arm to his flesh.
“Tony’s a friend, but he does some shit sometimes. Until last year he was in a relationship with Pepper--”
“So do I, Agent Hill,” Steve gave her a shy smile.
"Ahn, y-yes." The boy blinks. "It's on the seventh floor. Just go ahead when you reach it."
Kudos and comments are appreciated <3
Steve got into the old building, the red brick ink was peeling. Steve wouldn’t be surprised if he heard that that building collapsed in the news. He just hoped he wasn’t there anymore. After all, since Steve’s mother died when he was eighteen, he moved in with Bucky, and maybe he got too comfortable to find a place of his own, instead, he stayed at Bucky’s place as long as possible, though Bucky had never complained about it. Plus, Bucky was buying his own house, which means he would leave soon, and Bucky’s place would turn into Steve’s place.
“SHIELD Clothing is a great opportunity, Stevie. I really hope Natasha calls you,” Bucky wished, and Steve knew he was sincere.
Outside, Steve sighed, probably it wasn't so bad as Tony said, he knew Tony has the habit of overreacting. Then, someone bumped on his shoulder abruptly, he didn't realize the high heels steps of the woman, he was caught off guard. The woman turns to apologize, a surprised look on her face, and Steve swears mentally, he shouldn't have to be seen, this wasn't supposed to happen.
"Unexpected." Steve finishes. Tony titles his head and smirks.
Tony couldn't stay still. This just worsens his anxiety, he was utterly aware of his obsessive behavior into folding the clothes he got from the apartment, making sure that everything was symmetric and in the right piles. He probably must have folded that Steve's blue shirt for the eighth time and it still seems wrong for him. Fuck, why can't he just lay down and sleep?
." Steve laughs, that's pretty accurate and sounds exactly like Natasha. "Bruce will give us a shy smile, then pats us on the back and congratulates us." It looks like Tony knows their teammates pretty well.
Natasha was a good person to work with. She was good at catching nice angles to empower the collection. The details seen by her eyes made a lot of difference during that afternoon, and Steve almost regretted that the red-haired wasn’t there for the lingerie photoshoot, it surely would have made an enormous difference. Not that Wanda wasn’t good, no at all. But Wanda was an intern, and Natasha had years of experience that showed the greatest differential during today’s photo session.
"I should--"
They talked for a few more minutes. Steve is unable to take his eyes off Tony, his protectiveness instincts are screaming at him, and Steve has to admit that he never felt so useless in a situation before. Then, the man held Tony’s left wrist and pulled him next to him. Steve straightens his body, watching carefully as their target pulls his Omega upstairs.
Well, kudos and comments are appreciated.
So, they cross the street walking peacefully in the pickup's direction, when they reach it Tony takes control of the situation unlocking the car's door fast like he had already done something like this a lot of times. Steve gets on the car, and Tony is already connecting the wires to make the car works. Steve observes the street through the rearview rubbing his hands nervously.
He observes that scene for a moment, trying to memorizing every detail, a smile still on his face. Then, Morgan’s eyes fell on him and she opens a bright and sweet smile at his sight.
“There you are! I’ve been looking for you for fifteen minutes!” She says while she picked Morgan from Steve’s arms. “Everything is settled, you’re going to be late.” Pepper scolds Tony and Steve.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve thrusts once, sliding his hand to Tony’s hips to keep him steady as he thrusts over and over again, deeper, pistoning inside the tight hole. The coupling becoming a true mess of Steve’s grunts and Tony’s moans sounding loud into the room as they reach their peak, they surely can be heard from the outside, but Steve doesn’t give a damn, and neither does Tony.
After paying for everything, they change their clothes in the fitting room, thanking the salesman and the cashier of the store. Now they were properly dressed to the 70s. When they exit the place, Steve realizes that the sun is setting, he had lost complete sense of how much time they spent in the store. Of course, it was Tony's fault who took so long to choose his clothes.
“Pepper, what are y--” Steve heard Natasha’s voice from the inside.
"Why? There's nothing I haven't seen before." Tony replies sassy. Steve sighs loudly and turns around. "You know, the view is even better from behind," Tony notices Steve's lips curls up by his comment, but he does not say anything else.
"What are we gonna do now? We have the fucking stone, but we can go back." Tony laughs ironically.
“Tony, I found this aspirin in my bag,” she hands the pill to the model.
"Hey, calm down. Take it as a loan." Tony says joyful when the car starts. "Here we go, baby."
“Hey, Capsicle.” Steve stood by his side. Clint and Wanda both hold a glass of champagne and smile at the couple.
He picks it up curiously, for two seconds there isn't any sound on the other side of the line, then a voice came up, hoarse from years of smoking and old.
Tony was tapping his finger on the edge of the table anxiously while looking out of the window uninterested, they haven't talked about what happened in the alley, about the kiss nor the fact that two guys were following him and one of them just said Hail Hydra before killing himself. This event brings out another memory from the past, the one right post-serum, when a man killed Erskine, ran away with a sample, he caught the guy and those are exactly his last words.
“Thanksgiving is tomorrow,” Steve said, uncertain of how to invite him. Damn, he just needed to ask, it’s a simple task.
"No, they don't." He agrees.
Steve barely registers the path Tony leads him out of the noisy studio. Too immersed in his messy and disorganized thoughts. Tony pushes against the cold floor where Steve sits without questioning in the empty corridor, then somehow, the model pulls the window open and the cold wind hits him. It’s not unpleasant when the air hits his face, making him look at Tony for real this time. Tony crouches down in front of him.
"You weren't actually born here, right?" says Tony referring to the sign outside the base that says birthplace of Captain America.
Tony hesitates, even though he trusts Steve. He knows he can talk with Steve.
"Tony" Steve lays a hand on the brunet's back, rubbing it up and down.
“Holy shit, Scott, I forgot my wallet upstairs,” Clint said, moving to the door of the establishment. “Hang in there. I’ll be back in a minute.”
"We've heard about your experiments, or machine, with time travel. I'd like to say that we are very interested in it. I'd like you to join us... To talk about business." The man spoke casually, and Tony felt the anger in his veins, how did this completely strange new about it? According to his statement, he knew that Tony wasn't a scientist from the seventies, how he knew it, Tony doesn't have any idea, he seems to know more than he should. The last time he had felt this angry was when he fought Thanos in Titan.
God, he loved that laughter. He wasn't used to hearing it, Steve looked more relaxed than he already has seen it. It didn't matter that they were trapped in 1970, they were together and that' was enough. They would be fine, Tony knew it from the bottom of his heart. Everything would be fine as long as they stayed together.
Thank you for reading!
“Thanks, Pepper,” Natasha replied, leading the blond toward the door.
Steve exhaled, slowly, then he inhaled, feeling the air filling his lungs until it ached inside his chest.
"Well, good day, Captain..." He looks down at the name written on the uniform. "Horseo." Then, he waves off turning his back and heading to the elevator."
"Let him go."
"I know, " Steve says, a smile playing on his lips when he stares at Tony, which makes the brunet's lips curled up, too. Tony finishes the stitches on his arm.
He walks down the street looking for other security cameras, anything that can help him to find Steve. He feels his phone chimes in his pocket. Tony frowns confused. This is not supposed to happen, mobile telephones are not even available in this time, how can this be happening? He takes the phone staring at the unknown number calling him.
“What? It’s just sparkle water and lemon, babe.” Tony says like he was reading Steve’s thoughts. Immediately, the expression on Steve’s face softens.
Natasha wipes away the tears rolling down her cheeks. She takes her hands to her mouth in an attempt to muffle her sobs, although she knows that no one would heart it. She hold the letter against her chest. God, she will miss them so much, but she is really happy that they could find happiness in each other.
He opens one of the last doors, and he immediately recognizes the blond. Steve lifts his head up to see who is coming in and his eyes widened.
"That must've been fun," Steve answers, rubbing his hand back and forth on Tony's arm.
Tony Stark. Tony Stark. The name sounded familiar, maybe he had heard it somewhere. Well, if they were counting on Stark for the next campaign, then he should be someone important. Why did he feel like he should know this name? S-T-A-R-K. Maybe he heard on the news, Steve wasn’t sure. He tried to bring out the memory but his mind came back empty. He makes a mental note to google the name after his meeting with Natasha.
“I live in Brooklyn,” he shrugged.
(See the end of the chapter for
His hands work fast to untie Steve, and Tony glances at the door every second afraid of being caught, when he unties one of Steve's hands the supersoldier starts to untie the another, both working fast, he is untying Steve's right leg when he sees the knob turns.
"Tony?" He hears Steve's voice calling him, then footsteps coming from the room.
Inside the cab, Tony couldn't stop thinking that the man's name sounds familiar. He can't remember where he had listened to this name before. Thomas, that is a pretty ordinary name, it was his surname that caught Tony's attention, Pierce. Pierce, Pierce, Pierce. He repeats the name inside his head, what connexion could Steve have with this man? How did they found him?
Two days passed by with no incidents, and Steve and Tony were utterly involved in their nest of love, completely absent-minded of the world outside.
He fell on his knees on the floor, panting desperately, while everyone around him was moving. Some were hidden behind the scene or had crouched down on the floor just like Steve. Others were commenting on what happened. There was too much noise. It's too loud. He needs to focus, but he can’t, not with all that noise. He needs to find shelter, get out of the line of shooting, he needs to think. He needs to do something. Anything.
He looks back to Steve who steps forward closing the distance between them. Steve puts his hand on the sides of his arms.
car tank. There was an old lady reading the newspaper nonchalantly behind the counter, a fifteen years old teenager on the back of the store looked like nervous and was staring to a ginger guy who was checking CDs, three others teenagers were hiding, or stealing, products on their pockets, on Steve's left, a couple was discussing what beer brand they should buy for a party. Steve just caught a basket and put some bags of chips, bottles of water, soda cans, and other stuff they might need.
"One of them had a hippie beard." She says like she had just remembered. They head into the elevator, the guard starts talking over the walkie-talkie.
"Keep it. It's yours. I made for you." Steve says. "I'm glad you like it."
Steve carried Tony to the large bed in the room, placing the Omega on it carefully almost as if Tony was too fragile and could break if he put too much strength. Steve peppers kiss on Tony’s beautiful face, making him feel loved, then kissing his jawline and rubbing his lips on Tony’s mark, which sends shivers all over the Omega’s body.
"Huh? I--" Tony stammers, looking back to see Steve closing the door. "I'd like to thank you, doctor Pym, for..." Tony switches the weight of his body from one foot to another. Hank looks confused at him, but he waits for whatever Tony has to say. "I--, actually, I'd like to say that I highly admire your work, these prototypes you're working on, uh." He whistles. "they're revolutionary. I'm certain that it's gonna help plenty of people in the future."
She takes him to a small space in the back of the bakery, there are TVs showing what is happening inside and outside. Tony holds his hand eager to touch the keyboard next to a TV. Tony found it quite hard to keep his hands to himself a few minutes while she explains the whole system to him, it is clear to him that this girl is an aspirant to technology, but she ends up here working in a bakery, and probably frustrated.
"What's the matter?" Tony asks twitching his nose.
The billionaire gets the folder on the other side of his bed. Steve approaches curiously, sitting on the bed again.
The first agent comes in Tony's direction, something in his hand. He tries to punch Tony but he dodges easier than he thought. The other two agents go for Steve.
Sleeping wasn’t really easy for any of them. Sleeping lets them vulnerable in the field. Although, a soldier’s brain never shut down completely. Their eyes can be closed, but their bodies are well aware of everything that is happening in their surroundings. For most soldiers, if not all of them, nightmares were a real thing. Memories of their battles come at the silence of their mind at night to torment them, as well as missions that could go wrong and end up in fatal outcomes. Steve wasn’t immune from them, nor was Bucky.
"They are too modern. We need local clothes."
Tony dresses the clothes they have stolen from the Army's base laundromat again, the badge clipped on the lab coat says that he is Howard Potts, an engineer, physician, and professor from MIT. As to Steve, that is the first part of the plan, to get Steve in. Tony needs to steal a card from one of the securities guards, get a uniform from the staff room, and hand it to Steve from the back door. Once this is done, they would be able to circle in all offices and labs with the ID card from the security guard.
“Steve, are you with me?”
"Well, you said he left two weeks ago, these events don't take long. Perhaps, he's already back, but didn't come to the base." The soldier doesn't reply, instead, Steve watches Tony eating carefully, even so, he hasn't finished his own meal, when the brunet finishes it, he called the waitress. Tony frowns and nods to the blond's meal, but Steve just waves off, he wasn't so hungry, anyway. The waitress brings the bill and both men take out their wallet.
"You don't need to explain, Steve. I'm glad you found someone." She smiles smoothly. "Just be careful, both of you, a lot of people won't understand and they can't be less tolerant to it now." She shrugs.
"It's okay, honey." Tony looks to the void. "Fuck, so it's true." He mumbles to himself.
Natasha wasn't the kind affective and sentimental when it comes to objects. Her room used to be extremely minimalist, with only her basic possessions, although when Tony set them in he had told that all of them are free to decorate their rooms the way that they wanted, it was their home, after all.
"Steve. Where is Steve? What have you done to him?" Tony bits the man's bait.
Tony sees Steve going in the direction of the elevator. Steve turns back to him and shook his head. No. There are no Pym particles in Hank's office. Of course, he should have known better, it is probably in one of the labs, but they did not have the time to check each one.
A woman laughing out loud calls his attention and he turns to see her sat on the floor, her high heels broken and her ankle twisted in a strange angle. The woman was laughing, drunk, the alcohol taking the pain away. He wanted it. He didn't want to feel pain anymore.
"Wow, looks promissory." Hank seems a bit fascinating. "Would you like to visit the labs? Is there anyone guiding you around here?"
Wanda rolled her eyes, then raised her hand up, where Steve could see a beautiful, probably expensive, ring.
Steve laughs, but he can't hide the flush of redness filling his cheeks.
Closing the trunk, he turns on his heels making his way to the front door, a weak glow coming from inside due to the lights. Outside, the fresh wind passing through the trees smells exactly like when the rain hits the ground, bringing up that delicious scent. Steve takes a deep breath filling his lungs with this wonderful scent, it might rain during the night. It smells like home.
"I guess I haven't done enough if you're still alive." And Tony throws the bomb in their direction.
Steve looked at his side to catch the view of two swans in the lake in Central Park. The color of the leaves turning into red and orange matches perfectly with the sky in the background. The reflection of the trees on the water makes it seems like a fancy bloody carpet, where the white colors of the two swans were untouchable. A fragile smudge. A pure thing in the middle of a contaminated world and those swans are still able to keep their purity. They say that swans mate for life, and watching those swans together makes Steve feels lonely. That’s an odd feeling for him. Loneliness. Steve never thought of himself as someone lonely. Though, it was true that since he came back from the Army a few months ago, he has never had anyone. It’s not easy to be a gay fella in the Army, and Steve preferred to keep that piece of information confidential.
“No, no,” Steve waves his hands. “I mean, are we dating? We never really talked about it, and things just start happening too quickly--”
They finished their meal in silence, then Tony paid for the hotel room while Steve holds tight the briefcase with the tesseract. They wouldn't stay for one more night. There was nothing else that New Jersey could offer to them, they needed to head to San Francisco as soon as they can, so if they are traveling they would need as much information about Hank Pym as they could learn, and also to get supplies and, maybe, some money. They exit the hotel making their way to the Army Base once more.
"He's out of the country, that was Howard says. Apparently, he left two weeks ago. There's no way we're going back." Steve isn't scolding him, Tony knows, but he is still blaming himself. It's all his fault. "We both knew it could happen, Tony."
The façade is sinister, and the logo mark with a red octopus was even more devilfish. Steve furrowed while he parked his bike. Maybe that wasn’t a good idea, now that Steve was there it doesn’t seem a good idea at all. There’s something about that place that gives him chills, and a cold shiver goes up to his spine.
Outside, the wind was cold and filled with the salty smell from the sea, messing his hair. A night of reflection sat in a pub seemed to bloom his senses, because the streetlights seemed too bright, he felt absent-minded, incapable of focus on anything. The streets to the apartment were quiet, the only noise came from the few cars passing in the avenue that they have been earlier.
"Do you mind if I take a look at some footages? I've lost my wallet this morning when I went to the grocery store, which is close here, maybe I can see if someone took it?" He asks uncertain, because, in fact, he already asked a lot to this girl.
Tony rolled his eyes.
"It's just..." just what, Steve? He thinks to himself. "the government wouldn't accept it so easily, neither the U.S. Army, being a public figure, well, it's a shit."
"You should be resting, Tony." Steve replies turns his eyes back to the horizon, Tony stops beside him, then he sat cross-legged.
Tony had alerted them to what could go wrong, he had listed every single one of them, still, he went there, he found a solution, he made it happen and now he was lost in a time-space machine he had created himself just to bring the loved one of someone in the world back. That's kind, inspirational and selfless. She was wrong about who Tony Stark is.
Tony twitches his nose, glancing up at Steve.
Steve found it hard to define an accurate moment of realization, but he'd say that was the moment after Tony flew in that wormhole in New York, the moment they were eating shawarma together, and Steve's heart sank the moment he realized he could've lost Tony. For the billionaire, it took a bit longer to admit it himself. Thus, he remembers he got a call from SHIELD telling him that Captain America got shot, and quickly Tony made the arrangements to Steve being transferred to a decent hospital that Tony had afforded, Steve's shock face was too funny to watch, the blond didn't know about it till Tony slipped out.
His phone buzzed in his pocket when Steve parked in the Walmart. Bucky’s name appeared on the screen, and Steve knew he was calling to ask how the interview went, which makes Steve a little sad for not having good news to give to him.
"No, I-" Tony doesn't finish the sentence, cause Steve interrupts him.
"This is gonna hurt," Tony says, glancing up to Steve, who just nods knowing exactly what is coming.
They talked about Tony's PTSD and Steve's nightmares related to World War II. Germany and Siberia were also a topic of conversation, in fact, a relevant and enlightening one. Those hours on the road were gold and allowed them to know each other deeply, make them exposing their fears and insecurities. It was a precious moment that they've shared and Steve caught himself craving for more moments like this, because he loves to hear Tony talking and laughing carefreely, also the fact that Tony had opened up to him and trusted him was curious, but perfectly pleasant. Steve's instincts were stronger than ever to protect Tony no matter what, they always have been, though. Their jobs are quite dangerous, he knew it very well, and he also cared so much about Tony wellbeing that he wouldn't measure efforts to make sure the brunet was safe. Even though, the brunet wouldn't enjoy the idea of protection very much, not if it meant Steve putting himself in risk because of him, but like Natasha said once, they both are too stubborn.
Next chapter is the epilogue.
“Hum, not good. Peggy was right,” Steve admitted.
! Tony thought. He couldn't get rid of the idea that all of this was his fault. If he hadn't lost the tesseract, if Loki hadn't caught it, if he didn't have that stupid idea of going back in 1970, if... So many "ifs". He is always the one that screws up, he deserves all of this crap happening to him. Tony feels a lump growing in his throat.
“Hm. They’re really good,” Steve agreed.
"That's awful. That's terrible, Tony." Steve paces back and forth in the room. "We need to stop this."
"Who are you?" Tony asks taking a step forward.
“Where’s it?”
"It's okay, the bullet is not lodged." Steve grunts.
"I'm going in," Tony says to Steve, but he didn't wait for the blond's reaction, already walking down the street.
Steve and Tony know very well that those are not the only agents inside here, and they could be running right to a trap, however, they did not have many options to consider.
"Nothing." Steve lies getting close to the rail too.
"We-we should get back." Tony gasps. Steve nods.
Tony takes the footage back to the hour that Steve left the apartment. For some long minutes, he watches the boring video of people crossing the streets to go to work, kids accompanying their mother to the market, people taking the dog for a walk, a couple jogging, some men smoking at the corner.
"I'm sorry, what?" Tony takes a step forward, raising a brow in defiance. "I got your back"" He shouts exasperatedly.
They turn the corner, and Steve pulls him to an alley, Tony's back bumps against the brick wall, both of them were being consumed by the desire to touch each other. Steve smashed his lips against Tony's, the taste of the beer they had was still strong inside their mouths, their tongues intertwined in an eager kiss. Tony fists Steve's shirt pulling him closer to his body, the billionaire feels his cock gets hard under his pants. The proximity of them allows Tony to feel Steve bulge against his body. Steve's hands hold his hips with a steady grip while he peppers kisses on his neck, Tony bits Steve earlobe, the blond moans against his mouth before pulls himself back to catch his breath, Tony sees those beautiful blue eyes filled with lust.
"What are you doing?" Tony asks with a hoarse and sleepy voice, he attempts to stretch, but stops as soon as the move makes his hips and legs hurt, he's definitely a little sore, a quick and pleasant reminder of the sex they had last night. He rubs his eyes lazily to glance at Steve.
They found a clothing store two streets ahead of the cafeteria, there were a lot of clothing stores and other fashion accessories from the 70s, luckily, the stores were almost empty, clothes weren't as interesting to tourists.
“I’m not sure…” he lets it hang in the air.
"Hey, did you sleep well?" The blond asks.
"We should leave before the police find us here." Tony finally speaks looking around.
Steve sighs looking disappointed.
"Yeah, I guess my half brother enjoyed the place," Tony lies skeptically, they can't risk rising any suspects about their status.
Tony looks back to the TV showing the ambiance that's when two workers caught his attention one of them puts his hand on his gun, but the other one puts his hand above the first stopping his for whatever he was thinking in doing.
"We don't know when he's going back," The blond asks
Behind the counter, there was a man, he was short, had grey hair and a mustache, he wears a pair of big glasses, and his smile is welcoming. Tony approaches him and requests two rooms. The man seems a little bit disappointed for, probably, lost two customers.
"Great, because I love you so much, Tony. I've been loving you since that battle in New York." Steve confessed. "I can't handle losing you anymore. I-I don't even know how I handled it all these years."
"The plan involves two people."
"We're screwed!" Tony shouts.
"Okay? That's it? Aren't you scolding me for leaving?"
Day 23: Halloween
"No way," Steve replies.
“Will you dance with me?”
Steve opened his eyes. He saw blood on someone’s forehead as Wanda pressed a white towel against the injury, soaking it up in the blood. Red. Scarlet against the pure color of the tissue. He had his hands pressed against his ears in an attempt to muffle the loud, annoying noise. He took a deep breath, even though it hurt. It hurts to breathe. It shouldn’t hurt. Steve’s eyes darted around, looking for any kind of danger. There wasn’t any other evidence than the pieces of glass spread on the floor. Steve raised his eyes.
"Come for me, Tony." And Steve doesn't need to say it again, when the brunet comes, his hot seed spreading on his and Steve's stomach. Tony feels his hole tightening around Steve after his release. "Hold on a sec, sweetheart," Steve says. Right, supersoldier. He thrusts twice more before he releases inside Tony. Steve leans dropping a soft kiss on the billionaire lips before slid out of him.
Steve threw the man's body on the ground, running his fingers through his hair pacing back and forth in the alley, he should've imagined it, the blond's sighs annoyed and turns to face Tony. There are drops of sweat on the brunet's face, he passes the back of his hand on his forehead wiping them away.
The two men walk silently, both lost in their thoughts. This is a hell of a situation that they dive in and Tony couldn't stop thinking about his family, though he knew that Steve couldn't either. Did the avengers get the other stones? Were they safe? How much time has passed in 2023? They were supposed to be back in less than one minute.
"I love you," Steve whispers scooping Tony's face on his hand, his thumb stroking back and forth on the brunet's cheek.
"I'm drawing you." Steve shrugs. Of course, Steve had drawn the brunet plenty of times without him really knowing. "Stay still."
Tony turns around still inside of the supersoldier's grip, he cups Steve's cheek bringing his lips to his, Steve leans down to cut the gap and sealing their lips. It's a passionate kiss, they don't need to say the three words because they're already inside this kiss, it screams a clear "I love you" to both of them.
"I thought you were innocent, Rogers," He teases. Steve smiles, pulling Tony's underwear out, his cock pulls off with a drop of pre-cum on the tip, Steves licks his lips slowly, his eyes observing the brunet.
“Holy shit!” Steve stood up fast, the chair falling on the floor behind him as he ran to the kitchen. “Shit! Shit!” Steve looked to the burned pasta. He had completely forgotten he’d left dinner cooking. “Ouch,” Steve threw the pan in the sink when he accidentally burned himself against the hot metal.
“Go to sleep or I’ll sell your toys,” said Tony closing the door behind. Outside, they could listen to Morgan’s giggles.
“Hey, is it because…” Tony is interrupted by Wanda popping by his side.
Tony laughs.
Thank you for reading.
Steve glances up Tony.
"What's wrong, Capsicle?" He furrowed. "You look like you ate something and didn't like the taste." Steve puts his hand on the genius back, leading him back to the laundromat.
"Professor Pym?" The student says uncertain, he only continues when Hank stares at him. "Professor Evans requires you in his lab, something about a non-approved project, I think." The student slipped out looking uncomfortable.
Bucky curled up his toes when he felt Steve’s fingers sliding up and down on the sole of his foot. The tickles turn his blood hotter and send it right to his half-hardened cock. Of course, Steve knew exactly how to tease Bucky to get what he wanted. Plus, the fact of the two being super-soldiers, they rarely didn’t have the energy for that kind of thing.
"Thank you, too, then." The blond says.
"This is incredible, Mr. Stark. This whole thing of time travel is almost unbelievable. Fascinating!" Pierce speaks in awe. "How did you manage it? Such expertise should not be wasted." He moves close to Tony. "We need someone like you, with your brain, we would be decades forward. We could control everything."
Twenty minutes later, he's sitting on the bed again, dressed in warm clothes, even though his body is shivering and his teeth are clenching. Steve's hands are soft when he puts a bandage over his scratched forehead. There's not much that the blond can do for his black eye and the dark purple bruises on his back and ribs. Tony watches him attentively, Steve hadn't said anything beyond his name since he got home. He finishes with Tony's injuries, putting everything back to the first aid kit, his hands fall on his laps and Steve looks at them for what seems a long time before his blue eyes look up to Tony's brown ones.
"Son of a bitch," Tony mumbles, letting out an exasperate and heavy sigh.
"No shit, Sherlock. Have you just discovered it for himself now? 'Cause I know about it a long time ago" She says extending the word
She turns on her side. She doesn't want to leave the comfort of her bedroom, she doesn't want to face this fuck reality.
There is nothing unusual on his way back to the hotel, he keeps an attentive look around himself, but he does not seem to be followed, actually, he expected Hydra to back off for a while given the fire. There are a lot of tourists in front of the hotel, speaking several languages, Tony supposes that they are waiting for a mean of transportation for tourists attractions, which is none of his business.
? No, he shouldn't let his mind playing tricks with him again, even if Tony felt all of his insecurities growing in his chest all at once, he shouldn't be jealous. Steve never really liked him, no even as a teammate.
"He's Tony. Tony Stark." Peggy's eyes widened by the mention of the brunet's last name."I-I have to check on Tony," He finally says walking out of the laundromat, Peggy follows right behind him.
I absolutely loved to write this one!
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that."
"As you wish, sweetheart." Tony smiles with the pet name, then Steve takes his fingers out of him and Tony feels empty while he watches the blond pouring lube on his length.
Then, everything happened fast after that. Steve has leant to take a bottle in the bag when the shots came. Loud, lethal, bloody. They all stand with their rifles ready to take anyone down. These mountains… they are not safe. Steve had heard the stories from the people in the village. The men who lived in the mountains, they were cursed by evil, that’s what an old lady told him and Jones. Those terrorists were known by many names, and they were composed of several people, they spoke dozens of languages, but the biggest terrorist organization there was the Ten Rings. They were responsible for fires in the nearby towns, robbery, murders, and holding hostages for a fair amount of money or anything whoever was willing to pay was up to give them
He turns around when he hears a low whine coming from the bed next to him, this time they've asked for twins room. The brunet watches the blond trembling on his bed and his face grimacing like he was scared. A nightmare, surely. He didn't know that Steve had nightmares, he actually didn't know a lot lately. Another frightened whine gets out of the soldier's lips and Tony decides to wake him, that's what he wanted people to do with him in these situations, there was nothing as scared as being stuck in your own mind, in plus, he hated the sight of Steve suffering and being hurt.
Someone was moving in his direction. He couldn’t tell who. His sight was blurred, not with tears he hoped, it was just a consequence of the shock. Steve blinked, trying to get his sight back to normal. His eyes watered with how hard he closed them. When Steve opens again, the man is crouching down in front of him, pulling away from the blond strands of hair sticking on his forehead.
Steve went back to the apartment. There wasn’t much else he could do today. He surely would not be hired by STRIKE, but he still had spread his CV in some places, he could only expect that one of those agencies would call him. Or Natasha Romanoff, Steve read the name on the SHIELD Clothing website. She was the head of Marketing and models recruitment for the enterprise, born in Russia but speaks English better than most Americans. There wasn’t much about her life on the Internet, so that was all Steve got to know. He also knew she was the woman Bucky gave his contact.
Steve smirks, standing up and taking off his shirt. Tony props himself up on his elbows observing the supersoldier movements, his biceps contracting while he stretches and pulls the shirt out of his head, revealing a perfect and defined abs, and all Tony can think is how lucky he is.
"Okay. You're right. I'm freaking out." Tony turns around and then turns back to Steve. "We better find a place to eat, then."
They run blindly through the hallways, hoping that each turn would lead them to an exit. They hide inside of a room when a bunch of agents pass by.
English and French are not my native language. I've been studying English for 7 years, and French for 4 years now.
"Yes, doctor." He replies promptly. "I guess he maybe is out for lunch." Stark frowned to his answer.
"Okay."
"It's not healthy. Probably it has a high amount of sugar." The blond twitches his nose.
“I’m good, ma’am, thank you,” Steve answered.
It’s only thirty minutes from Manhattan to his apartment in Brooklyn. Well, their apartment since Bucky is still his roommate even if it’s only for a few more months now. The thought of his best friend leaving soon makes Steve’s heart clenched. They have always been together since they were kids, and Bucky used to protect him from the bullies in the streets, it was also Bucky who dragged his tiny ass home every time Steve got in a fight for something he believed it wasn’t fair. Steve had to suppress his laugh, not wanting to look weird for smiling randomly in public. Bucky has always been there, and he always will be, Steve reminds himself. Till the end of the line, right? That’s what they say to each other.
"Hey" Howard shouts. Steve turns halfway on his heels. "Are you looking for Pym?" He stops for a moment, and the complete with "Captain."
“Not yet.”
Bucky felt Steve pressing his growing, hard girth against him as he undid the knot on Bucky’s pants, sliding his hand in and wrapping the dark-haired’s cock with a hand. Bucky muttered something almost intelligible to himself in Russian. Steve always finds it so sexy when Bucky says things in a language he can’t understand.
She doesn't remember this book at all. Natasha opens it to see a beautiful and artistic handwriting that she had already seen so many times.
"What? I'm a traditional guy," Steve starts to say, but stops when he saw Tony lifts a brow. "Okay, maybe not much that much anymore, but I still care about these things." Tony sighs defeated, but in fact, he is loving it, he loved that Steve was old-fashioned. Also, that was Steve's way to redeem himself for yelling with Tony.
Steve had the TV on, even though he wasn't paying attention in the news, he was drawing again, the amazing sunrise that they had the pleasure to watch together yesterday, he wished he had a canvas to paint it, though he was sure he couldn't reproduce that stunning scene perfectly.
The man looks confused at him.
He writes down the license plate of the van, he decided to make some research and look further, his priority now is to find Steve.
“Wow. I really liked this one,” she said, resting her hand on Steve’s biceps.
"That's where Janet lives." Steve lift a brow without understand Tony's point. "His fiancée. They'll get married at the end of the year." Steve agrees.
By the time they finished, Steve knew everyone’s name in the room. He was good at knowing names by heart, and the team was friendly, so it helped him to feel comfortable. Steve looked over the hundreds of pictures he had taken and that Natasha would choose among them, so he could edit. He didn’t notice when the brunette models got closer to him.
"You don't mind, right?" Tony asks lifting a brow. Steve nods negatively.
Steve raises his head to look deep in those brown eyes. There was desire in his blues ones, Tony could see it clearly, and he was feeling so attracted to those blue eyes, both have waited so long for this, for any correspondent feeling from each other's part and now they have it. Steve didn't move, his lips were parted and his breath was warm. Tony felt an invisible thread pushing him towards the blond, he couldn't resist it anymore.
Steve follows him in. Down there, blue lights on the walls are the only source of light, Steve sees shelves and boxes, old stuff, mechanics pieces broken everywhere.
"You have no idea how much I want this," Steve mumbles kissing Tony's neck.
Tony observes Steve quietly. The super soldier seems absent-minded, lost in his own thoughts. Being stuck here sure makes Steve think in everything he had lost those 70 years frozen in ice, also, the whole situation they are in. They can't go back, at least, not now. They would spend a few days here in the 1970 New Jersey. Steve keeps moving the straw in circles inside of the milkshake. Tony frowns.
"There's nothing to be ashamed of. You're not doing anything wrong." Steve says and the boy's look falls onto him, his eyes widened. "Love is not wrong at all. It's beautiful. Society has no right to make you feel guilty about loving someone, even if it means someone from the same-sex." The teenager observed him attentively, but he didn't say anything, just took his bag and hurry to reach the door, it slammed behind him. Perhaps, the boy was too surprised for being discovered, it's okay, Steve got the feeling, he remembers very well when Natasha caught him looking to Tony with a smile and linked the dots all by herself giving him a convincing smile.
Not exactly what he expected to listen, but he lets out a sigh of relief. He trusted Natasha, after overcoming all that play about Natalie Rushman and get to know her along these years, she became a friend, he could count on Nat.
“You’re early,” she said. Steve nodded in knowledge.
amazing, just like the first one did. It's Tony who breaks the kiss to catch his breath, they keep their forehead together and Steve observes the contours of the philanthropist's face, his beard perfectly aligned, the shine of his skin on the moonlight. Steve strokes his thumb on his face affectionately while Tony keeps his eyes shut appreciating the touch and thank inner for it.
“Okay,” Steve replies, turning back to the window. “So, when Happy is back?”
“I’m fine, I’m okay, see?” Tony pulled away and turned around to Steve checks his body letting the Alpha touches him, knowing that the physical contact would calm him down. Tony is shirtless since the one he was wearing is laying ripped and utterly useless on the floor, Steve quickly pulls Tony close to his chest again, using his body, arms, and hands to cover the Omega’s naked skin as much as he can.
"I woke up, and I didn't see you. Thought I'd find you here," Tony says.
It’s not like Steve had agreed to this, to use Tony as bait, but when does the Omega listen to anything he says? So here he was leaning against a column in the great hall looking his Omega flirt with another Alpha. Actually, Steve was only there in case things go really wrong, which means to the case that Tony’d have to ask for a rescue. The others are spread out there. By the corner of his eye, Steve could spot Clint on the balcony while Natasha was in the middle of those high society members talking to them amicably, collecting information about how the whole Omega’s traffic trading works without them even realized. They were too drunk or too drugged to remember about it tomorrow morning, after all. Plus, if the people who are doing this dirty work learn that someone from inside released information, well, the person is more likely to end up dead.
“I’m Natasha Romanoff,” Natasha extended a hand to Steve that he promptly accepted. “Director of Marketing, and also recruitment of SHIELD Clothing. Your friend James talked about your last time I went checking on the new advertising campaign,” Natasha explained.
“You have a really nice portfolio, you know? The last one you posted yesterday, the two swans. An amazing shot. I was impressed,” Natasha said, and Steve couldn’t help but blush. “Pratt Institute, huh?” Natasha continued, a smirk on her face.
“What’s happening between you and Tony?” Straight to the point. Steve does notice her eyes on him as if she was capable of reading him. Steve does not doubt that, though. So far, Natasha has shown a good ability to read body language.
“You are twenty minutes late,” Steve said when he saw Tony coming at the front door.
"The hot blond, guy?" Tony can't help but rolls his eyes, ignoring her compliments toward his boyfriend. He nods, agreeing that that is the one who is talking about.
Also, there's a 10K Steve and Tony one-shot coming out this week. Pretty much fluff, I love to write fluffy.
He opens his mouth to argue, but he knows Steve is right. They can't go, they don't even have an ID, though Steve needs medical care.
"We're gonna keep it safe. We'll leave the coordinates to the others, when they find it, they'll bring everyone back safely."
They were doing fine. Tony feels they are running in circles when they turn one of the thousands of corners, they saw a bunch of agents aiming their guns at them, Steve retracts quickly pulling Tony with him. The bullets reach the wall.
Tony sighs, he regrets it too. He regretted more things than he should and he didn't want that Steve was consumed by this feeling as well. They could've done differently, they can do different now. Beginning by forgiving each other.
"Peggy" The blond affirms awkwardly rubbing the back of his neck.
Did Steve want to? He looked to the man on the cover again only to realize he was already paying for the magazine. Steve wondered why the name of this man looked so damn familiar. Stark. He had heard it before Natasha or Pepper mentioned it. Perhaps, he had watched an interview with the model on the TV. Of course, if Tony was this famous he would appear on TV, also, Wanda had mentioned something about a model involved in scandals back then. Was it Tony? Steve thought he would figure it out when he read the magazine.
Steve takes a step forward, but the door slammed behind the genius' back. Tony was being mean because that was the only way he knew how to react when he was in pain, it was his self-defense, but Steve wouldn't let the billionaire pushes him away, not anymore.
Steve took a deep breath and before he could mount on the bike and go away, he stepped inside. The smoke almost stopped Steve from seeing ahead, in a corner, he could smell the weed, which made him twitch his nose to the unpleasant scent. The lights blinked incessantly in different colors, and the music was definitely louder than ever. Steve couldn’t understand how someone could spend their night in a place like it. He was ready to walk away, and find an excuse for his absence when he bumped onto Wanda tomorrow when he felt a hand on his shoulder. Steve turned around to face Wanda’s twin, Pietro from finances.
"Yeah, who cares, anyway?" Tony can't hold his tears any longer. He feels ridiculous or crying over it, Steve's words shouldn't hurt that much, he was used to being misunderstood for other people, but hear it from Steve was way too much. A tear rolls down on his cheek.
"I believe you, Steve. I'm sorry it happened to you." Steve nods. Then, Peggy points her chin toward the door, asking "Who is he? A time machine? That's unbelievable." She blinks impressed, and Steve smiles.
(See the end of the chapter for
He keeps telling himself that Steve is fine, he is safe and there is no need to hurry that much, but Tony can't stop walking so fast, he has to be sure, Steve would not be late, he is always punctual. He turns the corner to see the same girl from yesterday in the door, this time she is sat on a wooden box and has a cigarette in one of her hands.
"He is upset" Peggy comments. "Is that true what he told me?" Steve turns to face her, trying to contain the impulse to go behind Tony and checking if he's okay.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Why didn't you tell me before?" Tony mumbled, hiding his face on the blond's naked chest. Steve smelled so good, it was intoxicating, and Tony just couldn't get enough of it. Steve ran his fingers through the genius' hair, dropping kisses near his forehead and ear, never letting go of him, keeping him safe and sound in his strong arms.
Also, Tony wasn't the kind that talk about his feelings openly. He surely talked with his teammates when they're all together, he jokes and teases everyone around him. But when it comes to talking about him, Tony always went to Natasha and Bruce. In the beginning, Steve felt hurt, he wanted to Tony talks with him, trust him, even though he knew that he doesn't deserve it. He, himself, never talk about him either. Maybe, he had treated Tony too harshly those years, he thought that pushing the billionaire away maybe, maybe he would stop having feelings for his teammate, because that was what Tony always would be with him, after all, Tony is straight, right?
"Captain, he left two weeks ago. He is out of the country." He took a step forward in his direction, then completes. "Something about a congress in Switzerland."
The brunet takes a sip from the mug with the Stark Industries' logo, the coffee is cold, dense and gross, he swallowed the liquid with a bad will and puts the mug on the table again.
Steve sits back on the bed facing Tony.
Tony knows. There are no words to describe this whole fucking project. It seems impossible and unreal, but here they are, inside this folder there are the names of victims and the complete experiment report, most of them did not survive to the procedures and the ones who did had suffered several damages, physically and emotionally.
The boy was right, he just needed to go ahead to find a glass blur door with the name of Hank Pym, CEO of Pym Technologies. A piece of cake!
Steve looks around, but the few people still in there seem to be minding their own business.
"You like it rough, huh?" Steve hummed close to his ear, Tony can feel the warm breath sending shivers all over his body, he didn't even reply he's too caught with the amazing sex he's having now to bother it. It's insane what Steve is capable to do with him.
Scott had come back alone, he said that he and Tony had lost the Tesseract for Loki in 2012, then Tony had this crazy idea of going back to 1970 to recover the Tesseract and find the Pym particles to come back, it all seems simple to everyone. Natasha was determined to wait for them, so she pushed a chair and sat in front of that machine waiting. She felt frustrated, worse, she felt lonely.
(See the end of the chapter for
“How about ‘we found love in each other’ plus sparkly heart and swan emoji?” Bucky offered. Steve snorted.
"It is." Tony insists and Steve gives in, rolling his eyes.
Merry Christmas, everyone!
"Tony, where are you?"
Their ride downtown was strangely quiet, not that kind of uncomfortable silence, just the silence's type that they were trying to absorb everything that had just happened. Generally, the silence was broken by Steve and Peggy talking about their lives after the war and nowadays, Tony remained in silence for the most part of the path, occasionally answering some questions made by Peggy, who was being so gentle that he felt bad for being such an asshole with her. He shouldn't have poured his chagrin on her, it wasn't her fault that he was in love with Steve, and Steve loved her.
Bucky sighed, looking down at their mess on the couch.
Steve put a hand on Tony’s lower back, pushing him forward and past Bucky who closed the door.
Misunderstandings between Steve and Tony.
He is frustrated and can't find Steve, his teammate, and now boyfriend. He kicks a can on the edge of the sidewalk, damn it! He turns around to see that the can stopped in front of the bakery, it is almost ironical since he and Steve used to go often that place, Steve loved the apple pie they served. Tony sighs at the memory. Shit, he is even talking about Steve in the past. He is a pessimist and he does not know how to deal with bad news.
“Why not? It’s fun. It makes everything funnier,” Wanda started to dance when another song started to play.
She flips through the book, smoothing the yellowed pages. It looks like a very important book for Steve, he must have read and reread it a thousand times, it looked quite used, there are marks all over the book, toothbrush cream, coffee and even sauce marks. She looks at the book affectionately. Then, an envelope falls from inside the book.
“Okay, go to sleep, it’s late, we have a long day tomorrow,” Steve said leaning to kiss her forehead. “I love you.” he gets up and walks to the door waiting for Tony.
The other guy tried to stand up, but Tony hit him with the repulsor, he hit the wall opposite the alley, groaning in pain he spits blood. Tony stops in front of the guy and kicks his left leg calling his attention.
She went back to the main room, she hasn't seen any soul on the corridors on her way back here. So, she pressed the alarm button and waited for the Avengers assembled. The first one to get to the room was Rhodey, he looked confused at first but he sat down and waited along with Natasha, then Bruce and Thor came in followed by the blue female, Nebula, and the raccoon, Rocket, the last to arrive is Scott still in his pajamas.
"Dinner, then?" Tony asks, finishing the bottle and throwing it in the garbage can.
“Hold on!” Someone shouted when the doors were almost closing, and Steve made the favor of putting the folder in his hands between the doors that quickly opened again.
"Fuck!" Steve curses, he glances at Tony. "Maybe it's time to put your bomb in use."
Tony looks to his feet, upset. Steve touches his hand slightly and discreetly. He was tired of hiding who he is but knew that they couldn't risk it. Look what happened to Tony just a few days ago, he didn't want to pass through a situation alike ever again. One time was already displeased.
"I'm sorry, too. I shouldn't have brought the Accords. I-I don't know what I was thinking."
, Tony thought. Then, he crosses the street, this time looking attentively to both sides, but Steve stays where he is, so Tony turns on his heels from the other side staring curiously to the soldier. "Aren't you coming?" He asks nodding in the direction of the base. The soldier didn't answer but followed him.
Steve should've remembered that Hydra had grown inside the Army after World War II, creating roots and growing along with SHIELD, always being a shadow, always crossing Steve's path and hurting the people he loved. Steve sighed frustrated and Tony stops tapping.
“Thanks, Wanda,” Tony gives her a small smile. The youngest nods, walking away. “Is it because we were holding hands? Did I turn it awkward? You should’ve told me that you are uncomfortable that people know we are dating,” Tony concludes.
"Watch your back, Captain." The soldier got the man by his collar, raising him from the ground, the man laughs unafraid, looking straight to Steve's blue eyes. "Hail Hydra." That's his final words before bits the pill inside his mouth.
“Don’t hide, Steve. Don’t worry about it. Everyone’s here is very respectful,” Wanda assured him. “Also, their model number one is a bisexual involved in many scandals. Really. Don’t stress about it.”
Steve moves in an attempt of getting up, but Tony grabs his arms.
Tony feels the tears rolls down his cheeks, tasting the salty liquid on his lips, then tasting Steve's own tears when he kisses him.
Steve does exactly as told. He moves at a rough pace as both of them like. Shamelessly. They moan out loud, and they don’t give a fuck if someone is going to listen to them. Steve thrust harder and harder each time, going deeper than ever and Bucky allows him while he pushes his hips back to meet with Steve’s thrust. Steve grasped tighter on his waist when he went deeper and Bucky moaned while the blond’s keep hitting that sweet spot inside of him. He probably will have bruises, though he doesn’t care, because he knows any purple will have disappeared in the morning thank to the serum running through their veins.
Just so you know, I'm used to updating it every Sunday.
On the second floor, a female agent of SHIELD got in the elevator too. She keeps looking awkwardly to the them, alternating her glance to the document in her hands and to them. Steve lowers his cap and Tony steps forward attempting to cover the blond's face. The doors open on the fourth floor and the genius steps out.
“She--She’s better handling business than me, so it’s the most obvious choice.” Tony shrugs, then glance at Steve. “I’ve known Pepper for years. She’s perfect for the job.”
Hank looks back to see who Tony is pointing, he frowns a little confused but quickly recovers his wise countenance.
She seems cautious for a while, like she is evaluating if it is a good idea to let Tony go in the security. Then, she nods, agreeing. She shouts something to the boy in the front of the bakery and waves her hand for Tony to follow her.
Steve pulls Tony with him for a building abandoned entry, away from the curious stares. He smashes his body against Tony's, the billionaire's back hitting the brick wall behind.
Thank you for reading!
"I-I know..."
Yes, that's right. They argued for a silly reason, a hypothetical idea, in matter-of-factly. Basically, Tony was wondering along with Bruce about the power of an infinity stone and what could be created with that, or something like that. He just said some ideas and hypotheses about Wanda's powers being related to the stones, and if maybe they could isolate that power to create something great, like the suit armor around the Earth. Of course, Steve got angry about the discussion between the two scientists and scold them, which Tony answered with sarcasm and made Steve even angrier. It was bullshit. No one could manipulate the power of those stones to make something greater, well, not on Earth, the power emanating from the infinity stones was too dangerous to try something so risky. Tony just wanted to create stuff to protect people and the Earth.
The rest of the day passed by fast. Wanda was right, the Winter’s Collection was immense, full of details that needed to be photographed, even though they spent the afternoon among makeup, change of clothes, and set arrangements, they haven’t done yet. Another would be needed to get everything ready before the edition process. Thankfully, Natasha was there monitoring and barking orders to the team, which relieved Wanda’s work, and helped Steve to be more active, and less shy around the others.
"See you at lunch," Steve drops a kiss on his cheek, waving to him before closing the apartment's door.
"You good, big guy?" Tony asks, smirking. He feels Steve nods still on his back.
“Welcome to SHIELD, Mr. Rogers,” The woman handed him a card. “Marketing Department is on the 7th floor.” Steve nodded, murmuring a timid and low ‘thanks’ and walking towards the elevators. The doors opened, and Steve sighed relieved when he got in the empty elevator.
"Then, we fight."
He wasn’t happy at all, not with that Alpha sniffing his Omega. Not when he was so close to Tony’s neck, and the Omega is three days away from his heat, drawing more attention from the Alphas in his surrounding. All Steve wanted was to smash that Alpha ugly face. The man laughs again, leaning on Tony and the Omega laughs politely.
"I'm not upset with you, Tony. If that's what you think." He sighed.
“Let’s get some lunch, Rogers. I’m starving,” Wanda leaned against the doorframe, which makes Steve laugh, and hurried up to go with the intern.
They're in the security room in the back of the building, the cameras show every office, room and lab inside included Hank Pym's office who is leaving his office in this exact moment, Tony's eyes follow him for a moment but he's distracted by a shirtless supersoldier.
Steve was staring at him, pale, a frowning of concern between his brows, his lips in a thin line. He puts a hand on Tony shoulder just like he did last night.
He flips through the folder, taking glimpses of the material in it, his jaw clenched with the things he is reading. Tony closes the folder abruptly, shoving it angrily inside the bag. Fuck. Everything is messed up. He needs to show it to Steve, as well as he also needs to know what happened to Steve while they are in that warehouse.
Tony can't help but question himself over and over again. He feels an anxiety attack building inside him. The billionaire turns his gaze to the window, feeling the wind on his face while he's still in the road. It does not help, matter-of-factly. He digs his nails in the palm of his hands, expecting the pain to help him to focus on what really matters: Steve.
"A little bit, if you touch by accident. But it's not uncomfortable at all. I liked it, though." Tony says smiling. Steve lets out a sigh of relief. "Don't worry, Capsicle. You won't break me." He leans and kisses Steve, suddenly, the blond is on top of him again.
"Oh, I don't think they made them anymore. That's a pity." Tony sighs nostalgically. "I loved it when I was a kid. I used to steal some before lunch without my mom knows, it drove her crazy." The brunet smiles sadly, and Steve can't hold the smile himself imagining a little Tony eating jellies gums hidden behind a door or under the table.
“Thank you, Steve. Enjoy the rest of your day, huh?” There’s a smirk on her face when Steve turns around by the door. He surely will. He smiles back, waving her goodbye.
Steve waved his hand.
"Then, I guess I'm about to have a fucking migraine," Tony says, walking out of the room and locking the man inside.
Fuck! At least, they had talked enough time to FRIDAY be able to trace the call. He looks at the location blinking on his phone screen. It's not far from where he is, but it's a recluse place, next to big factories and warehouses. He was on his own, and Steve would not like him to go, but since when Tony Stark listens to Captain America commands? He was on his way, he would find Steve and bring him back home, safe and sound. That's what they do, what they've been doing the last ten years.
He has what’s he’s asking as soon as the blond slid his fingers out him, pouring more lube in his hands and rubbing it throughout his hard cock. Steve lined up with Bucky’s entrance, and the soldier had to hold himself to not push his ass back, but when Steve pushes forward, he takes it. He takes it all, feeling his walls slowly adjusting to the girth invading him. Both of them grunted.
Steve acquiesced. He couldn’t help but feel a little upset for Tony not having told him about his relationship with Pepper, since they both still work together, and Pepper seemed really close to Tony. Though he couldn’t blame Tony either, after all, it was in the past, right? It doesn’t matter what was in the past.
Steve's eyes sweep the apartment and he realizes that there's only one double bed. It's okay for him, that's not a problem, but he didn't want Tony to feel uncomfortable, even though all he wanted was to share a bed with Tony for the rest of their lives.
He doesn't need to be numb. He needs to feel that pain, he needs to talk with Steve, to see things through his perspectives, only that way he could understand. He's worthy of happiness, he tries to remember himself. Tony took a deep breath. He would stay there and wait until the crowd fades. He would sit there and put himself together, and allow himself to feel.
“Steve,” Tony said a little louder to Steve.
Steve wasn’t a fan of magazines, newspapers yes, but not magazines. However, he’s paying for his mint Trident when a cover catches his attention. Steve is sure he had seen this face before, maybe on TV? He couldn’t remember. It wasn’t just the guy on the cover wearing  sunglasses on the tip of his nose while his brown amber’s eyes were looking directly at the reader, that caught his attention, but the name written in capital letters on the cover:
The door opened, and a dark-haired man stepped inside carrying paper bags, apparently, their dinner in his left arm.
At the end of the day, they have decided to go to a pub two streets away from the apartment they rented. Plus, the Dodgers would be playing tonight, and as Steve roots for the team they had a great excuse to hang out and spend the night together.
Tony takes another sip of his coffee, giving him a thumb up, the gym is just a few streets of the apartment, of course he'll be fine. He almost want to roll his eyes for Steve excessive care over him the last days, but he can't blame him to it, Tony was beaten up in the streets, if it was Steve in his place, he knows for sure that he would also be careful with Steve.
See you next Thursday.
Suddenly, the same woman who was with them in the elevator turns the corner accompanied by two other security agents.
Everyone in the room nods affirmatively. Rhodey gets up.
Tony goes to the kitchen to take what is missing, and he sees a folder on the countertop. He furrows, sure that it wasn't there when he left yesterday. Tony approaches it, checking the note left on the folder, "this is not over" it says, and Tony knows for sure that it is Hydra.
"Don't worry kid." He pats the boy's shoulder smiling back to him. "Would you know, by the way, where the director's office is?" He slips out, taking advantage of the situation.
“Oh, you’re the new photographer Natasha hired!” she said excitedly. “I’m Wanda. Wanda Maximoff. This is my twin, Pietro.” The guy nodded at Steve with a small smile. “We are internships here. I work with Natasha, and Pietro works with Clint. Clint and Natasha are almost like siblings, by the way. They’re best friends, I’d say. He works in finances.” Wanda wandered, waving her hands in the air a little bit exasperated or too excited.
Steve adjusted a lamp at a better angle as Wanda gave the commands to the models. Natasha was right, the young woman knew it all, and Steve did as told. He asked Wanda for suggestions, which were excellent and made all the photoshoot looks a marvelous scene. It wasn’t just a sexy photoshoot as Steve thought at first, and of course, it would never be with Natasha in charge along with Wanda. That photoshoot didn’t have the intention of being provocative but encouraged women to feel better with themselves, and their features. The makeup done in the models wasn’t flamboyant or anything, but it featured the format of their faces without hiding their freckles, lines of expression, or even acne marks. SHIELD Clothing definitely was a good place to work.
“Again?” Morgan nods affirmatively. He lifted a brow and turned his look to Tony who was in silence until now. The brunet smiles and also lifts a brow. Spoiling Morgan as always, Steve thought.
Steve accommodates himself at the edge, bring his knees to his chest and wrapping his arm around his own legs while resting his chin on one of his knees. A few minutes later he hears footsteps behind him and turns to see Tony walking in his direction, in one of his hands he has a box while rubs his eyes with the other one.
Suddenly a little person entered the room running like a lightning. Steve lowered to get Morgan into his arms. She was wearing a cute red dress that Pepper had bought her.
"Thank you for..." Tony gestures, passing by the girl in the counter, she waves a quick goodbye to him.
Tony stretches his hand to greet him.
"I'll pay this one," Steve said.
See you on Sunday!
“Steve! I’m glad you could make it,” Maria said, kissing him on the cheek.

"A shot of whiskey, please."
I'd like to say that I officially finished writing this story. Two more chapters left, Yay!
"We need to go to San Francisco."
He has no idea how he got there. His feet just remembered all the way he had made just a couple of days ago and led him to the place unconsciously. All the way down here the streets were dark and this part of the city wasn't too much crowded like the avenue they had gone through earlier, the only noise filling that street were his sobs. He felt stupid for crying, why was he even cry anyway?
"That's improbable." Steve twisted his nose in an act of disagreement
Steve and Tony found themselves in front of an old and ugly build in the center of San Francisco, which is not bad at all, since it's pretty well located. The owner of the apartment leads them inside, she's a sympathetic and helpful lady in her 50s, she presents the small apartment to them, a bathroom, a kitchen and a room, according to her the water is always hot, so they didn't have to bother about it. Steve grins at Tony approving the apartment, it was fine, as long as they're together everything would be fine.
“Watch some movies, maybe,” Tony turned around to the sink, rinsing the glass. “What was that TV show you were talking about?”
“Thank you.” He replies, smiling joyfully to their friends.
“Why did you become a model?” He asked, curiosity getting the best of him.
“Tony?” he turned his head slightly to look at the blond. Steve had a genuine smile playing in his lips. He looks so beautiful, Tony thought. Steve stroked his hand. “You’re okay, we’re safe now.”
“Thank you,” Steve said, turning his back to look over the pictures and make sure that they were printable, or didn't have any blur.
"Oh." He lets out, he felt ridiculous right now. "How was it? You wanna talk about it?"
"Allow yourself to be happy, Tony."
Steve throws his hand up.
Steve went first, he opened the door of the laundromat, there was no one that can be seen, but they can hear people talk, gunshots practice, soldiers marching turning the corner.
“You did what?” Steve blinked, incredulously.
Steve shook his head, laughing, and typed exactly how Bucky told him. He put his phone down and watched as Bucky took out of the bags macaroni and cheese and some grilled vegetables, then his best friend went to the kitchen and came back with plates and cutlery. Bucky put a plate close to Steve and started to serve himself.
"Yeah, it is."
Steve rubs his hand back and forth on Tony's back, sighing sadly. The genius, generally, didn't open up to anyone, Steve can't remember a single time that Tony has talked about his parents this freely, but it was nice to see that Tony was willing to confide a part of his past to him, even though he didn't deserve it, Tony was willing to trust him again.
Tony types the numbers, and they hear a click when the door opens. Tony sneaks in the room while Steve watches the door, quickly Tony slides four Pym particles inside the pocket on his lab coat. They only need two particles one for each, but Tony believes that it is better safe than sorry, they could break one of them accidentally on their way to Malibu. He just hopes that it does not happen in fact.
"I'm sorry."
"Better than ever. You?" Tony pulls a chair close to the counter.
Tony is worried. Steve can see that clearly, a mix of emotions was stamped on the brunet's face. He is scared, he is lost. And Steve was feeling this way too, but he already has been through there, he knew he would adapt to the situation and he needed to help Tony to do that too.
(See the end of the chapter for
As promised, a chapter with an amount of fluff and domestic Avengers.
"How do you think our teammates will react when we tell them about us?" Tony furrowed. He wasn't exactly expecting the question nor even thought about it really, but it would be fun to imagine their teammates' reactions.
, Steve thought. Damn you, Stark.
Steve chuckles, shaking his head, then Tony winks at him. Steve checks for the memory card inside the camera.
“It’s okay. It’s a recent thing,” Tony took his hand to his lips, placing a kind kiss there. “We have so much in our minds lately with all those photoshoots. It must have slipped his mind. It’s fine, really.” Tony preventing Steve from receiving a scold is a funny thing, which Steve was grateful for.
"It's okay. I--I belong here anyway." Steve closes his eyes to stop the tears from rolling down.
"You're sure?" Tony nods while Steve takes off his underwear flaunting his girth cock.
"Like you would've told me the truth."
"He's not going to stop making jokes about the sexual tension between us during every Avengers' meeting."
“It’s okay if you don’t want to, I should have not presumed--”
They got in the warehouse named "munitions" easily. They went down alone in the elevator until the fifth floor, where they stepped out. Tony didn't say a word about what just happened, neither did Steve, even though the blond was still looking at him with concern stamped over his face. Tony wonders why Steve even cares, the billionaire has been close to death a dozen times, been ran over by a car was definitely the least creative way for dying.
“Then I’ll leave him in your capable hands,” she said.
“Here,” the boy said.  He nodded, smiling at Trip.  “I like you.”
He looked up, and Harris caught his eye.  Then he shook his head, very, very slowly, mouthing the word ‘no.’.  Tony sighed.  “I love you, I’m not dying, and, trust me, really really sorry I ever thought that was something I needed to do.”  He walked back out of the kitchen, water bottle pressed to his eyes.  “I was trying to spare you, you know that, don’t-”
“Do you have the girl?” Tony asked Clint.  “Cause I thought you had-”
Stephen smiled.  “Exceptionally.”  He adjusted his vest.  “I will be back as soon as I have news.”
He shouldn't.  He really shouldn't.  Just being here made him uncomfortable. Everywhere he looked, it was polished marble and gilt, gleaming gold paint and heavy red brocade.  Carvings of ancient patterns and smiling cherubs peeked out from every corner, delicate metalwork and incredibly intricate mosiacs of glass and stone covering surfaces from the ceiling to the floor.
"Yeah, don't...  Don't need that," Tony said.  He ruined his front by immediately coughing.
Its purpose.
“‘He’s French,’ was her exact words, and Stark was laughing by now, just laughing out loud, and he said to me, ‘Really.  You’re French,’ and it wasn’t really a question, but now I had four options,” Clint explained.
He leaned forward. "You can focus on looking back, if you insist. But I'm looking at what is yet to come, and the things we have to leave behind, if we want to move forward. All of us." He smiled. "Together."
“You did that just to see my reaction, didn’t you?” Tony asked him.  DJ gave a firm nod.  “Also a legitimate strategy.”  He looked up at Steve.  “I take it that this is going to be a bit of a wild ride.”
“But this?” Steve flicked the lock with one finger, letting it swing against the glass.  “This looks like the work of a small, clever boy with plenty of time and a few tools he’s managed to pocket.”
“Right,” he said, wobbling his way over to an armchair.  “What, exactly, did I do?”  Peter sat up.  He blinked owlishly at Tony.  Tony tried for a reassuring smile.  Peter smiled back.  Tony waited.  “Parker.”
“He visits a lot, though!” Steve called from the kitchen.  Tony gave him a look over the top of the tablet.  Steve, unrepentant, grinned at him.  “Such a nice cat.  Friendly.  Likes kids.”
Steve’s eyes fell closed.  “What’s your plan?” he asked, his voice quiet.
DJ took a deep breath, and Strange’s hand, using it to scramble back to his feet. “I-”  He reached out, pressing on the portal and it held, elastic and solid, as if an unseen veil had descended.  DJ reared back and crashed forward, hitting it hard.
“That is a very good rule.”
“I love you, I love you, I love you,” Tony said, repeating it until DJ cut the connection.  He let the tablet fall into his lap.  “Thanks a lot, Doctor Doolittle.”
At the door, he paused, looking back at the street.  The car was still there, idling at the curb, and he gave one more wave before he raised his hand to knock.
“And crushed pork rinds sprinkled over the top,” Steve said.  “It’s…  It’s a sight, let me tell you.”
“I cannot tell you how relieved I am to hear that,” Tony said.  “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got to find out if I have any coffee in this apartment.”
"I can't do this, I can't-" He shoved himself away the workbench, his whole body a live wire of frustration.  He wanted to blow something up, he wanted to punch something, he wanted to get out.  Instead, he picked up a wrench, bouncing it back and forth between his palms.  "Pepper.  You've seen what they're doing with my tech, I can't, I just-"  He huffed out a breath, his shoulders flexing with the force of it.  "I can't."
Every night, he dragged the linens and the pillows down to the floor, and slept there, huddled at the end of the bed.  And every morning, he dragged the whole mess back onto the bed.  It wasn’t the best solution, but it was the only one he’d found that worked for him.
“Very good, sir,” Jarvis said.
Tony nodded.  “Let’s work that in.  I’m going to need that.”
“What?  Why?”
“We do not,” Rhodey said, marking his spot in his book.  “I think it’s important that we make it clear that we do not.”
“Huh,” Steve echoed.  “So.  Vegas.”
"I mean, I can't make you,” Steve mused.  “I can, however, ask Buck to-"
There was a long moment of silence.  “So you're taking him to his place?” Sam asked at last.
He heard, rather than saw, Natasha lean forward.  She scooped up a folder from the top of the stack and smacked Phil over the head with it.  “You’re going to have to actually propose, you know.”
“I don't remember asking him for a stag night,” Rhodes said.  “I bear no responsibility for that.”
Steve nodded, pushing himself to his feet.  "Of course."  He looked down at DJ, who was cutting his pancakes into bite sized pieces.  “You okay there?” he asked, taking his cap back and trying to smooth DJ's hair down.  It was a losing battle.
Finally, Tony braced both hands against the bench, staring at the array of tools, each one labeled, each one outlined.  “You are one very smart little boy,” he said.  He glanced at DJ.  “Talking's...   Not easy for you, is it?”
Peter’s shoulders straightened up.  “Yes, Mr. Stark.”
They'd been caught in profile, the blonde's fingers cradling the brunette's chin.  He was smiling, his body canted forward, his head tipped to the side.  The dark haired man was turned away from him, as if the blonde had caught him off guard.  Beneath the edge of his glittering red mask, his cheeks were flushed, his lips parted.
“Right,” Steve said.  “Can you-”
Tony bit back a smile.  Rogers was trying so hard for polite subservience, and failing so miserably.  It wasn't nice, and it wasn't smart, but something about his frustration and disapproval just brought out the worst in Tony.  The grouchier he got, the harder it was for Tony not to pull his proverbial pigtails.
“Luckily for you, I can be very small and have wings, so you can throw me a very long distance,” she said cheerfully. She leaned in, her mouth curving in a slight smile. “Steve? If I didn't think that he felt the same way, I'd be giving you the shovel talk right now.”
“Don’t traumatize him,” Tony said.  To Billy, he added, “Where’s Hammer now?”
Steve picked the blankets up off the floor, shaking them out.  “Nothing to be sorry about,” he said, covering Tony back up before heading back around to the other side of the bed.
Steve looked up, meeting his eyes.  “You can fix it?”  Without missing a beat, the man nodded.   Steve took a deep breath.  “Fine.  Fix it.”  And that was unreasonable.  Steve tried to smile.  “Please.”
“Disappointing,” Tony said.  “Send me a selfie anyway.”
“Forty-five minutes,” Tony amended.  “Better?”
“Oh, I absolutely know.”  Steve shook his head.  “Can you please-” He stopped, the words caught behind his teeth, and he focused on his breathing for a moment.  “We need to consider all options at this point.”
One breath, two, and those were gone, too, faded into nothingness.
Clint leaned back in his chair, his arms folded behind his head.  “Oh, yeah.  She’s on board, says that if it ever comes up, we should just go for it..”
“I know,” Steve said, taking a sip.  Then he set it down on the table.  “Tastes better on your skin.”
She stared.  He stared back.  "Cambridge.  England?" she asked, because no further details seemed forthcoming.
Giving up on his glasses, he kicked his legs free of his blankets, stumbling to his feet.  He squinted out the window, his fingers tangled in the curtain.  From the window, he had a good view of the length of the grounds and gardens, all the way down to the lake.
“I noticed his art has stopped making any sense,” Tony agreed.  “Steve-”
Tony gave her a suspicious look.  “Are you using this little mishap as an excuse for a booty call?”
“You are a saint,” Tony said into his pillow.  One arm emerged from the blankets, his fingers making grabbing motions at the air.
"I did not need to know this," Carol told her.
“Right.  And what’s your codename?” Steve asked Happy.
“Shit happens,” Tony said, squinting down at the laptop.  “Do we have a better scan of this?” he asked Coulson.  “Because this is, this is useless, SHIELD is useless, and I was doing other things, important things, things involving missles, so-”
"He's always tired now," Val said, reaching for the bag of pretzels that was lying between the welding torch and the cans of epoxy.  She stuck a pretzel rod between her teeth and went back to assembling the metal plates.  "Always."
“NOPE!”  Harris fumbled next to him for a second pillow and slapped it on top of his head.
“Yeah, me, too.”  Tony risked a glance in his direction.  “Clint.”
“I mean.”  Her eyes darted to the side, following his gesture.  “There are a couple of vendors selling hats, but no one’s going to make you wear one.” She adjusted the hat on her head.  “And you can’t have one of these unless you’re staff.”  She paused, blinking.  “Do-  Do you want to sign up to be staff?”
“Damn him, and damn you,” Ty said, stabbing a finger in Tony’s direction. “We’re not finished with this discussion, you and I.”
Sam blinked at her.  “I-  If you want to?  I mean-”  He cleared his throat.  “Nice flowers.”
“Yes,” the boy said.
“Right,” Tony said, because that was the best way he could’ve seen that conversation ending. Especially since Clint was doing absolutely nothing to muffle his snickering.  “Everyone eat, and let’s get going.”
“We're not-” Steve started, and Tony snagged the collar of his shirt.
Laughing, Tony pushed his way out the front door and onto the sidewalk, slipping his sunglasses on before the camera flashes could blind him.  “Evening,” he called.  “What are you all doing here?  Slow news cycle?”
Sam’s head tipped forward, and he looked up at Steve from under the line of his eyebrows.  “Right,” he said, his voice quiet.  “What just happened here?” he asked.
“Not helping,” Tony told him, stomping down on the bubble of laughter that threatened to escape.  “You insubordinate wiseass.”
The bump of the tires as they turned into the parking lot brought his eyes open.  “Well, that was-” he started, and Clint brought a finger up to his lips.  His head jerked back, over his shoulder, and Tony turned in his seat to look.
Bucky filled his bowl, picking around the kettle with the ladle to transfer a few prime bits to Shuri’s bowl as well.  “Don’t think she has.”
Stark frowned down at the page.  “Miss Potts is out of her mind,” he said.  “I don't need a guard.”  He looked up.  “I don't need a guard.”
Steve nodded, a slow, deliberate dip of his chin.  “That you did,” he said.  He picked up his book, pulling out a folded piece of paper from under the cover.  Tony watched, amused, as he flattened it out, holding it up in front of them.  “Gone to Vegas.  Back in a few days,” Steve read aloud, his voice droll.
Then the pile of clothes on his armchair moved, a familiar head popping up.  DJ squinted at them from under the leg of a pair of pants.  “Where,” he said, his voice accusing, “have you BEEN?”
Tony choked on a laugh.  “Hello, not-my-favorite-bot.”
“Hey,” Darcy said, leaning into the apartment.  “We all good?”
DJ nodded.  “Yes.”  But he slipped the gauntlet on, holding his hand out in front of him.  The skeletal frame of metal felt familiar against his skin, the weight steadying, calming.  He sucked in a breath, and flexed his fingers.
DJ sniffed, and then rubbed one tiny fist against his nose.  “Yes.”  He sounded more sure now.  More confident.  His eyes flicked up to meet Clint's.  “Can-”  He swallowed.  “Hug?”
Steve knew a trap when he saw one, but he also couldn't see any way out of it.  He sank down into the chair, the folder clutched between his hands.  He was somehow very reluctant to open it.  “Sir?”
Steve took it.  “Yes.  Yes, I do,” he said, and Tony tugged him towards the chapel.
“Why not?  I’m a better kisser than you.” Danny gave a bark of laughter, and Luke stopped, midway through a bite of his beef on a stick.  His eyebrows arched.  “You got something to say, little man?”
His teeth were gritted so hard that his jaw ached.  “Thank you, but-”
“No,” DJ said.  He shrugged his backpack off, letting it settle on the floor beside his feet.  Dust swirled over his shoes.  “But I thought you might’ve ordered.”
There was fabric draped everywhere, bolts of it stacked up on top of the gym equipment and leaning against the walls, draping across the floor and trailing behind Natasha and Jane as they danced a delicate waltz, despite the music and the faux togas they were wearing.
“Unresolved sexual tension.”  Jessica’s teeth sank into a stick of celery, giving it a brutal twist. “One of these days, one of them is going to figure out that threeways are a thing and I will have 98% less problems in my life.”
“I know,” Steve reached out, stroking Furbro’s head.  The cat arched into his fingers, his purring ratcheting up a notch.  “You should be used to that.”
“Tony.”  Pepper pressed a hand to her eyes.  “Are you out of your mind?”
“That doesn’t mean-” Tony started.
Steve chuckled.  "Yeah.  I might've noticed." He caught Tony's hand, tipping his head to the side to press a kiss against his palm.  "Stop lying for me."
Looks like they needed another 'please stop filming these things and just run please,' PSA.
“Pretty sure it was DJ,” Steve said, bopping him with the pillow again.  “Tell your kid you love him.”
The door to one of the back rooms opened and Clint walked out, still in the process of fastening his pants.  As everyone looked in his direction, he wobbled his way across the floor.  “Thanks for the quickie.”
“Wow.  That's disappointing.”  The old priest was holding out a page to them, and Tony watched, his head spinning, as Steve filled out the empty spots on the form and signed with a flourish.  He held the pen out to Tony.  “So am I.  This is going to be one hell of a boring marriage.”
The cat stood up and jumped onto the table.  DJ went still as it padded around him, circling behind his back and taking a seat next to him.  It bumped its head against his elbow, a rusty purr making its ears twitch.  Cautious, DJ reached out, stroking a hand over its head.
Harris stared at her.  “What?”
“Tony,” he whispered.  “I-”
Above them, Natasha appeared in the newly formed hole in the second floor office.  “That...  Wasn't me,” she said.
They exchanged a look, Miss Potts' eyebrows arching, and Rhodes shrugged.  The quick, nonverbal communication passed in a handful of gestures, two people used to reading each other with a single glance engaging in an in depth conversation.
“Mostly because when one of them starts pulling stupid shit, most of us don't know what they're up to until too late,” Luke said.  “The others act as whistleblowers so we at least have time to prepare before the latest 'best idea ever' levels a couple of city blocks or brings someone back from the dead.”
“You’ll clean it up,” she said.  She offered him a chunk of apple.  “Won’t you?”
"Mine was a motorcycle mechanic who sold drugs on the side, but yeah."  Carol gave her a wry smile.  "Probably the same guy."
Rogers' head came up.  “Mr. Stark?”
“Says the guy who keeps trying to replace my furniture,” Harris pointed out, his voice wry.
“Watch Star Wars?”
There was a beat of silence, and Steve’s rough jaw brushed against Tony’s temple “I missed you, too,” he whispered back.  Tony shifted in his arms, reveling in the contact and the friction, and the way that Steve’s arms tightened, trying to keep him still.  Steve’s lips brushed against his ear.  “Behave.”
“Because unlike Pepper, I pick up the phone at obscene hours,” Rhodey said.  “Say hi to Steve for me.”
“Jay?” Clint asked, more focused on finding shorts that didn't have a hole in them.
“It is if you do it right,” Happy told him with a broad smile.
Jarvis opened the curtains with a flick of his hands, making Tony wince.  "He has already finished his breakfast and wished to help me bring yours up." He stepped back, retrieving the tray from the bedside table.  "Wasn't that nice of him?"
Clint grinned.  “Who knew they had this much stamina?”
“No,” DJ said.  He was sitting on the hood of the car, letting Darcy adjust his flower crown.  “You’re fine.” Without moving his head, he glared at them out of the corner of his eyes.  “You’re both fine.”
“If I’m up, everyone has to be up,” he yelled at the closed bedroom doors, lifting the cover off of one of the room service platters.  Waffles.  He dropped it back down with a clatter, refilling his cup from the silver pot with his other hand.  “Children, it can’t take you this long to get dressed.  Let’s get a move on.”
“Yeah, if he’s turned off his hearing aids, then you’re better off turning the shower on,” Tony said.  “It’s all that’s likely to work.”
On the street, directly in front of him, was a child.
“And you’re trying to change the subject,” Steve said, shifting away from Tony, just far enough to shrug out of his jacket.  “You’re going to catch your death in weather like this, then where will we be?”
“I’ll have the spreadsheets updated and waiting, sir.”
Doo doo doo doot.
“And instead of doing that, he took my money and made the shirts I was hoping to never see again into something that’s going to live on my couch forever,” Phil said.
As if on command, Tony felt his stomach growl.  He rested his chin on his arm.  “What's your offer?”
“Rhodey has them, I had him run them over to the office an hour ago,” Tony said.
“Since when do you do pre-breakfast meetings?” she asked.
“Yes, sir,” Jarvis agreed.
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis said, replacing the envelopes on his tray and lifting the coffee pot instead.  Tony held out his cup, and Jarvis filled it with a practiced gesture.
"Yeah, I got the reference, I'm aware, it just, the insult makes no sense," Sam said to Steve.  "He just took a name, and jammed something about potatoes into it."
There was a pause.  “I mean.  I thought you were smart.”
“He…” Bobbi paused.  She looked at Natasha, who raised one shoulder in a half shrug.  Bobbi looked at Steve.  “He didn’t send us.  But he didn’t stop us.”
His breath came out in a sound that was nearly a laugh. “You'd think that you'd be experienced with a polite social lie, Jan.” He glanced in her direction. “I will be fine.” He tossed the pencil aside, sending it clattering across the balcony floor, and reached for another one. “Eventually.”
Clint breathed the word, and Tony looked up, desperate to see what he saw.
Tony took a deep breath, and it tasted of copper.  “Yes, it was a long night,” he managed, as the glow faded around his feet.  He yawned, doing his best to keep eye contact with Hank, who was leaning against the wall at the foot of the stairs, his arms crossed over his chest.  “Not like you wait for me to open the shop.”
The bat impacted in the side of Obie’s head with a sickening thud, and he impact spun him around, tumbling him to the ground.
"I'll leave that to you," Tony said, pouring himself a cup of coffee and digging into his eggs.  "Did you find any good ones?"
Steve hooked a thumb over his shoulder, still wiping down his flattop with his other hand.  “Read the sign,” he said.
“Shhhhhh.”  She leaned in as well.  “Just breathe.  In.  Out.   In.  Out.”  She breathed with him, her breath whispering over his hair, leading him, showing him how.
“Can we move on?” Steve asked, his eyes squeezed shut.
DJ gave his clock a longing look, his fingers plucking a gear.  His eyes darted from Tony to Rogers and back, his face strained.  Tony shook his head, and reached for a rag.  "Don't worry, my small assistant, I won't play with it while you're gone.  I'll leave it right there, and you can come back to it when you're done frolicking through nature."
“Yes, but Clint only speaks French and Hawkeye doesn’t understand a word of it,” Bobbi said.
Sam nodded.  “Thank you, your Majesty.  I think I’m going to need it.”
Hogan swept his hat off his head, bobbing something like a bow.  “In the flesh, in the flesh.”  He slapped his cap against his thigh.  “Went down the t' the station, looking for you, they said you weren't on duty tonight.”
"That's not-"  Steve made a face.  "He didn't invite me to live with him, just to move in with him."  He stopped.  "Or maybe he invited me to move in, but not-"  He stopped.  Sam was staring at him, his expression incredulous.  Steve propped his hands on his hips.  "You know what I mean."
The car rolled to a stop, and he glanced up from the papers in his hands, catching Happy’s eyes in the rearview mirror. “Your stop, sir,” Happy said with a lopsided smile, and Tony glanced out the window.  The house rose over them, dark and ominous, every window shuttered or empty.
His fist caught the gunman square in the jaw, lifting him right off of the pavement and sending him crashing to the ground.
“Hey, now,” Tony said, and Sue choked on a laugh.  DJ grinned at her, clearly appreciating the audience.  Tony, for his part, scooped DJ up and bumped his forehead against DJ's.  “Brat,” he said, his eyes narrowed.
“To find the wand booth?  Yes,” she said, dragging him in the other direction.  “Let’s go.”
“Rose fight,” Steve explained.  Tony's eyes slid shut.  Grinning, Steve took a seat, stretching out one leg and pushed the other chair away from the table.  “Sit down.  Have a croissant.”
“You have far too high of an opinion of me, Jarvis.” Tony rolled over, burying his face in his pillow.  “Since it's morning, you're all fired.  Get out.”
Phil leaned forward.  “Do you?”
He stirred. “Tony?” He smoothed a hand over Tony's hair, pushing it away from his slumbering face. “I think we're home.”
“No, you’re not,” Steve said.  He walked around the desk, and leaned over.  Tony met him halfway, the kiss a gentle brush of lips. “Or I’m going to teach him about collective bargaining and labor strikes.”
“These two photo ops are not at all the same thing,” Tony said, but it wasn't a no.  He knew it wasn't a no, and judging by the way Steve's smile turned just a tiny bit smug, he knew it, too.  Tony wondered when he'd lost the upper hand in this conversation.  He'd never had the moral high ground, but for an instant, he'd had the upper hand.  “Not at all.”
Steve paused.  "The...  French chef?"
Steve froze, caught in the act of picking up an apple.  He looked up, but she didn’t seem to notice.
The man looked down, at the watch in his hand, and then back at Steve.  “I can fix it,” he said, his voice quiet.  He smiled, slight and strained.  “I apologize.  I shouldn’t have taken it.  But I can fix it.”
He was starting from scratch.  Again.  Resigned, he brought up a holographic keyboard and went to work.
"Where were we?" he asked DJ.  DJ reached out, tapping the beginning of the page.  "Ah, right.  Thank you."  He took a deep breath and went back to the book, trying to focus on DJ's reaction rather than the man hovering just a few feet away.  Despite what Stark had to say about their choice of entertainment, he didn't move away.  Instead, he took up a post at the table, well within earshot.
“Please?” DJ asked, his free hand reaching to Steve.
The boy seemed to have lost interest in Tony and was now just grinning up at Sue, his fingers wrapped in the fabric of his bright blue shirt.  There was a white star in the middle of his chest, and he was wearing a pair of pink shorts with little purple arrows on both sides of the legs.  “Hi,” he said.
“Thank you.” Tony ruffled DJ’s hair.  “Let’s go.  Find some seats that suit us a bit better, all right?”
Jesse didn't take it from her.  “After you passed out last night-”
Sam reached over, patting him on the back without breaking his stride.  “Sorry, man.”  He looked at Steve out of the corner of his eyes.  “Having trouble convincing Tony of that, though.  You might want to do something about that.”
Steve stared into the middle distance.  “Maybe it’s because I’m the only one wearing a sweater.”
“Thank you,” Steve said, moving his head to press a kiss on Tony’s wrist.
"You wanted to protect us, Tony. I couldn't see that at the time, but I see it now. I forgive you" Steve scoops Tony's face on his hands and places a gentle kiss on his forehead."I just hope you're able to forgive me, too"
“Sure don’t,” Tony puts the helmet on, wrapping his arm around Steve’s torso.
"Ouch, hell. Guess I have a problem, no way that will not kiss you because a fucking cut." Tony complains and Steve laughs. "I have an idea."
“Well, he should’ve knocked,” Steve shrugged, leaning again to kiss Tony. “Better, he should’ve not come up,” Steve mumbled against Tony’s lips.
He looks to Steve with a thankful smile before getting the bottle and drink half of it. The cold water coming down his throat is a relief, clearing his air passage and relieving the tight in his chest.
Tony is quick to steal the card hanging from the backward pocket from a security guard flirting with one of the receptionists. Why does it look so easy? The philanthropist starts to think, but quickly shakes his head, no need to wonder right now, he needs to focus, and they can't screw this up again, otherwise, bye-bye 2023 and half of the universe.
"Tony? Tony, stay with me. Don't sleep." Steve says cupping his cheek, his voice sounds loud, but he knows that Steve isn't shouting, his headaches like hell, and he can hear his heartbeats loudly inside his ears.
“Oh!” Steve said. Wanda snorted.
People were shouting orders outside, some of them were holding their flashlights looking for the attackers, the fire was spreading quickly and the wind direction wasn't helping to stop it.
In the back of the office, there is a glass that separates the office from another room, the blinds were down. Steve watches Peggy got in the room on the other side talking with another woman. It's been a long time. So long. It was weird seeing the woman that he had fallen in love a few years ago, now she just looks a remind of his past. He was in love with someone else. Someone that couldn't correspond to his feelings, but he couldn't stop caring about him either. Steve sighed.
“Of course she said yes,” Steve ran his fingers through his hair. “Oh God, Buck. Congratulations!” Steve pulled Bucky into a hug, patting him on the back. “I’m happy for you, man.”
"I don't need one. It's summer." Steve excuses, but he catches the jacket when Tony throws it in his direction.
Tony leaves. The hotel is not so far from their old rented apartment, but it keeps a safe distance since Hydra knew where they were. Tony knows that this is not the end of Hydra, in that warehouse, there were only a few soldiers and Pierce, Hydra is everywhere, there are plenty of them, but they'll keep themselves hidden in the Army and in SHIELD. Tony imagines that whoever is in charge now must not be happy about the damages that he and Steve caused, well, mostly him.
Then, a voice came up in the corridor.
The sunlight blinds Steve's sight, he raises a hand to cover the light and glance to the alley, then Steve crossed the street and reach the alley in time to see two men, both wearing suits, one of them trying to pull the briefcase with the Tesseract out of Tony's hand who had a firm and tight grip on it. The other punched Tony's on the face, leaving a bleed scratch on his left cheek. Tony kicked the man who was pulling the briefcase on his stomach, which made him stumble backward. A spike of adrenaline flows in the super soldier's veins, Steve takes the other man by his back by his collar, pulling him away from Tony and punched him on the nose, it instantly starts to bleed, he punched the guy again and so many times, that the man hasn't had a chance to hit Steve, he fell knocked in the dirty ground.
"I know. The bullet is out, and I heal fast, I'll be fine, Tony." Steve sighs. "I'm gonna need some stitches, though."
Smoke rises from the sink when he lets the water drop into the burned pan, which only worsens the smell.
A small smile appears on the supersoldier's lips. Tony sat back on the bed, his hand starting to work on Steve's shoulder, he can't deny that he is a bit surprised when he takes off the bandage and see that the appearance is a lot better than yesterday, Steve indeed heals fast, faster than he thought.
Day 18: Handcuffs
, he thought. Tony turns on the radio and Vehicle by The Ides of March fills the car for the rest of the trip.
They shake their hands in acquaintance.
“Thanks so much,” a red-haired woman that should be in her earlier twenties came in along with a blond, wait, is his hair white/silver? Steve wasn’t sure how to define it.
Steve looks to the brunet with such soft eyes while his hand stirs back and forth on his back.
"I saw Peggy today."
Steve grabs Tony's face between his hand, they are close, too close to each other. Steve can feel Tony warm breath so close to his face, he feels the adrenaline spike going away. Steve strokes his thumb back and forth on Tony's right cheek. He hates to see Tony hurt.
They talked about Tony's reckless impulsive behavior that almost led him for death plenty of times and how Steve almost had a heart attack with each one of them, which Steve made Tony promises to stop with his self-destruction tendencies, otherwise, his one hundred three years old heart wouldn't handle it. Steve attempts to joke made Tony laugh, a genuine laughter that the brunet didn't remember to hear one of himself in years.
DJ smiled back.  “Happens.”
“They coulda shot us, sure,” Clint said.  The jar went back on the shelf.  “But they could’ve done that in the library.”  He gave Steve a look.  “You think the police would’ve done more than nod approvingly if Stark had called them up and told them that he’d heroically shot two thieves that broke into his house and were caught red handed?”
Steve reached around him, picking up the book of poetry, and thumbing through it.  “Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,” he read aloud, and Tony glanced back over his shoulder at him.  Steve was smiling, a slight curve of his lips, the long dark sweep of his lashes hiding his eyes, his face flushed with warmth.  Tony opened his mouth to say something, and Steve kissed his temple.  “Hush and listen,” he whispered.
"An escort?" Steve's head jerked up.  "An escort where?"
"I think there is winning, and I think you're really bad at it," Jesse told her.
Steve locked eyes with him.  “He just watched something very big and very violent try to attack a child.”
Harris was startled out of his reverie, just in time to keep from walking into DJ’s back.  He followed DJ’s pointing finger, looking down the row ahead of them.  There, tucked between a booth selling piles of plush and one piled high with bootleg DVDs, a man was sitting at a small table.  Behind him, a crooked banner stood, reading “The Las Vegas Museum of Mysticism,” and the table was covered in disordered pamphlets.  The man barely seemed to be aware of the people passing by, staring down at his phone with a bored expression on his face.
Harris’ crown was closer to a circlet, twisted silver wire and drop crystals.  Before Tony could say anything, he hustled past, his head down.  “Shut up.”
And so could he, but this was no Coney Island beach, crowded with families with their old sheets spread on the sand and their meager lunches carried in old shoe boxes to protect them from the sun.  Instead, the pool stretched out before him, the water warm and clean, smelling faintly of chlorine. Jazz music echoed in the cavernous space, amplified by the water and the massive arched ceiling, massive windows opened wide to let in the light.
“You’ve very observant,” Greer said, tugging him around the corner into the main room, where two long benches facing each other with floor to ceiling open lockers behind them.  It was a mirrored version of the men’s locker room, but less cluttered, and lacking that unfortunate stain on the ceiling.  Steve still didn’t know if Clint or Thor was responsible for that.
Steve grinned.  “Okay,” he said, pushing himself to his feet.  “I hung your picture up on the fridge.  Do you want to see?”  DJ shook his head, but he was smiling.  “Gonna trust me?  Okay.  I like it, you used my favorite color this time.”
She flicked one finger, and DJ’s abandoned tea cup floated up, landing neatly on the table.  “Who are you, child?”
Jarvis waved him off.  “Fine, fine.  I had just hoped…”  His voice trailed away.  “Was it too much to ask for him to just…  Not try to hire someone?  Just this once?”
“It doesn't matter!”  Franklin's hands came up, a sharp flail of movement.  “We need to be united against the scourge of the little sister!  You are supposed to be on my side!  Unity, Deej!”
“He’s going now,” Happy said. He tipped his head towards the house.  “Jarvis is waiting for you inside, I’m sure he’s got more for you.”
There was a moment of silence, and then the elevator came to a smooth stop.  Clint glanced at the doors, but they didn't budge.  "Jarvis?"
“I'm resigned to it, yes,” Sam said.  “I'll swing by tomorrow with some matzoh soup for him, okay?”
Steve gave him a wry smile.  “French bakeries frustrate me.”
"Thor.  Consent," Jane said, right before a cloth was draped over her head.  She kept going, her voice barely muffled.  "Body autonomy.  We've been over this."
He reached for the card door.  “They don’t come into the house,” he said.  “If Mr. Stane wants to put them on the grounds, if he wants them to guard the doors, then we use that.   Witnesses keep trouble at bay.  But they don’t come into the house.   Any of them.”  His chin came up.  “Do we understand each other?”
“Who?” Clint said to Phil, even though he was still looking at Darcy.
“Well, now we're DEFINITELY watching this,” Steve said, grinning.
He exhaled, a long, drawn out sigh.  “Right.  That’s all I have to say, so-”  He stopped.  “Wait.  No.  One other thing.  Diners.” He stabbed a finger at the camera.  “Diners of New York.  If I hear one more person complaining about the cost of Chinese food in this city, or Mexican food, I’m gonna have to start beatdowns.
Steve grinned down at his tablet.  “You should be used to that by now,” he said.
Steve took a deep breath.  “What is-”
“I know you’re doing that to show off your cleavage,” Harris told her.  “It’s not going to work.”
“Please don't murder anyone,” Steve said.
She looked at them. “No, just subpar.”
“Or more,” Natasha agreed.  She looked up as Clint wandered up behind her.  “Hello.  Want the rest of my potatoes?”
Tony went back to his newspaper.  “It’s been a month, Jarvis.  I doubt he remembers me at this point, let alone is waiting with bated breath for a communique.”
He nodded.  "Fine."  He didn't sound very certain at all.  He glanced at Steve, who wondered if he was looking for reassurance or just support.  Either way, he was worried that Stark had turned to him to get it.  "Fine.  It's...  Fine."
"Definitely,” Ellen said. She cut a hard look in Jesse’s direction.  “You could’ve let me know we had a guest.”
“Fine.  We can work with that.  Because now...”  He swept the tools aside, pulling the sheet of paper free.  “Now, we have a chart.  So if you don't understand what I'm asking, I can show you.”  He smiled at DJ.  “Right?”
Tony took a breath, and another, trying to gather his scattered thoughts.  “Put him in the sub-basement for now,” he said.  “He’s lying, but we don’t know about what, we may-”  He shook his head, cursing.  “He’s a liar.  He’s lied about everything, he’s lying about this now.  We need-”
“It is always for the best to acknowledge your limitations, sir,” Jarvis said.  “Are we expecting anyone else for dinner?”
“Yes,” Peter said from off camera.
Steve’s fingers tightened on Tony’s.  “When your hands are cold, it scares me.”
“Go away, Iron Man,” Steve said, and this time, his smile seemed less strained.  He grabbed his shield.  “But don't go far.”
Tony blinked at the clock, and turned to find Jarvis smiling at him, his expression amused.  “Completely different circumstance,” he pointed out.  “Completely…  It’s different.”
Steve blinked at him.  “I-  Oh.”  He looked down at the mistletoe bells, and smiled.  “I thought everyone else was in bed.”
“Fine, I see who rates here.”  Tony glanced to his right.  “You can eat my egg, then.”
"Is to find every thing that should not be, and say, this is the last time we will stomach this. This is it. This." He stabbed his finger down. "This is where we draw the line."
“What’s better?” Bucky set the bottle aside and started on the next one.  “It is what it is.”  He looked at Steve, one dark eye visible under the weight of his hair.  “Are you?”
“Right,” Steve said, throwing an arm around Peter’s shoulders and guiding him back to the door.  “Peter, c’mon, we’ll wait out back.”
“Buddy, you have no idea.”  Clint wandered back over, flipping a Sharpie end over end before catching it again.  He passed by Stark, one hand coming out to pat him on the chest.  “I contain multitudes.”
"I love you and I'm quite terrified that your heart will explode one day," Pepper told him.  She held up the page.  "What is this?"
“No,” Harris said.
Peter blinked.  “That's not-”
As soon as he got a hot drink and something to eat, he was going to fire everyone again.
For a long moment, there was nothing but the echo of the soundtrack, a faint ghost of sound that hung around them, soft and ethereal.  DJ took a deep breath.
“I currently work for SHIELD, can’t be worse than that,” Darcy said.
Tony blinked at him, his face pasty and strained.  “Sick,” he said, and Steve stroked his hair away from his damp forehead.
“Rude,” Tony said.  He squinted at the petals Steve was pulling out his hair.  “Why-”
“He’s not getting any better,” she said.  “His efforts are still awkward.  Fumbling.  You see, the thing about magic?  If a being has the capacity to work magic, then their actual skills are usually limited by their intelligence, or their willingness to study, their ability to understand larger concepts that are often nebulous and arcane.”
“I hate you,” Steve told him.
“No, we’re talking about hats for my cat!” she said, grinning at him over the top of the box.  “I get bonus fruit hats for this month!”
Tony sucked in a long, slow breath. “First of all,” he said, his voice vibrating with something DJ didn’t understand, “why did no one see fit to tell me this?”
“I don't think I'm going anywhere,” he said, but he shifted closer, his arms tightening around Steve's waist.
DJ was nodding before he even finished asking the question, and Steve bit back a sigh.  “Okay,” he said.  “You didn't eat much this morning.”
“Hey, now, what-” Before he could lose something, he tossed back the rest of his drink, swallowing it in two quick gulps.  The warmth hit him almost immediately, curling through him as he threw the cup at a nearby trash can.  “Okay.  What are you doing?” he asked one of the girls.  She pointed at him, and plucked at the cuff of his tux jacket.  “Oh, you like my clothes?  Great.  Me, too, but-”
The cat yawned.  It seemed to have more teeth than a cat should have.  DJ moved a bit further away.
Carol sighed.  “I’m not asking him to buy you a present, Jess.  In that you’re not five, and he’s not your father on a business trip.”
“Tony?”
Steve grinned. “Always.”
The urge to swear was almost overwhelming.  “He’s not French,” he said, his voice flat.
Ellen recoiled in her seat. "You didn't tell him?" she asked, so appaled that Steve started to laugh.
“You tattooed me.”
“Right,” Darcy said, taking a delicate bite from one fry.  Harris gave her a look as he unwrapped his sandwich, and she waved the rest of the fry at him.  “Did you watch StarkSearch last night?”
Steve smiled at him.  “You going to be, I mean, you’re sticking around, right?”
“I managed to lure him out of the workshop by sabotaging the coffee pot, with the hopes that he would give in and go to bed,” Jarvis said.  He sounded tired.  “However, he made it only as far as the kitchen.”
Steve shook his head.  "No, it's just..."  It hurt.  The thought of it hurt.  He managed a smile, though.  "You're still friends with Pepper, even though the two of you broke up.  We can still be friends." Tony was silent, and Steve fought against an unreasoning spike of panic.  "Right?"
“Bunch of useless, self-important, sanctimonious assholes,” Tony mumbled into his water bottle.  “My kid’s got better taste than you.  Hell, my kid can cook better than most of you.”
“Steve will veto,” DJ said, and he could hear Val giggling, even though she had both hands clapped over her mouth.  Franklin was just rolling his eyes, because he was too cool for this, or so he kept telling them.
“One of ours?  Yeah, but I didn’t see who was driving it, or who was in it,” Happy said, already spinning the wheel.  “Hold on, I’ve got to bring this around-”
There was an unfamiliar car parked at the curb half a block away from Steve’s building, an old, rather battered looking Ford.  A man was leaning against the side of it, his hat pulled low over his face and the collar of his coat turned up against the cold.  As they approached, he dropped his cigar stub to the ground, glancing in their direction.
“I can-” Jessica said, and Sam was already shaking his head.
“I don't want to die,” she said, and the words were thin and small.  But her hands clung to his, her grip painful.
Tony pointed a finger at Jarvis.  “You can adopt him.”
"I'm going to object to this again," Marcy said, bringing Tony's head around.  "Strenuously object."
“Right,” Pepper said.  “You’re not allowed to go out with Clint.”  She drained the rest of her coffee.  “Or alone with Rhodey.”
“A careful magic user can slip past, without even being noticed.”  She tapped the skeleton of the armor, right in the middle of its chest, and Tony’s arm twitched, the urge to cover the arc reactor almost irresistable.  “Usually, an apprentice will gain confidence and skill, rather than power.  They will learn.  They will grow.”
“We are absolutely going to have sex in the car,” Tony said, his head lolling back on his neck. “Take the long, long way back.”
He wasn't sure why it felt so intimate.  And it didn't really matter.  It probably looked good for the cameras.
“Too late and too early,” Tony said, giving the station a cursory pass with his cloth.  “Steve’s getting you a a cab, buddy.”
“Oh,” Peter said, his eyes comically wide.  “HIS Aunt Patricia.”
“Really, DJ?” Tony asked.  “You trust that maniac?”
Her mouth worked.  "Yes, Chef."
“Sue?”
“‘Tis not as bad as it looks,” Thor said, grinning easily as he finished a milkshake for Tony and poured it into a battered tin mug.  “And due to past circumstances, I have most excellent insurance.” He looked around, his hands on his hips.  “I look forward to redecorating.”
Tony landed on his back, his arms stretched out over his head to avoid tipping the food everywhere.  Steve was half on top of him, laughing into his chest, one hand braced against Tony's stomach.  “Tell me you didn't spill that,” he managed, his head coming up.
She laughed.  “I’d appreciate it.”  And she bounced off, leaving both men staring after her.
“Absolutely nothing in the world would make me happier,” Isaiah said, just as the staffer returned, a cup of coffee in each hand.  He leaned back in his seat.  “What do you know.  I was wrong.  This.  This cup of coffee makes me happier.”  He reached out, taking it from her.  “We do apologize, ma’am, the session’ll be starting back up soon, so we’ll be out of your hair.”
“Let’s just assume that the plant would remain, you know, a plant,” Steve said.  “Instead of a giant, mutated…” He gave his head a brisk shake.  This was not something he wanted to consider.  “Thing.”
Sam gave a little shrug.  "Hey, if your significant other lived in space, you'd bring it up."
Steve looked at him.  “I-”
Laughing, Steve kicked the door shut.  “There are diners outside of New Jersey, Tony.”
"You're nothing but a fake, aren't you?" Rogers said, his voice soft.  Tony stiffened, but Rogers was still smiling at him.  "There are more lost lambs in this house than the one he came from."  He ran a hand up and down DJ's back, the gesture slow and comforting.  He didn't seem to be aware of doing it, the movement pure instinct.  "Have you ever put anyone out, Mr. Stark?  In your entire life, have you ever really thrown anyone to the wolves?"
Steve looked up at the sky.  “Yes.”  It tasted like a lie on his tongue, and it must’ve sounded like one, too, because Tony just nodded, a muscle in his jaw twitching.
“You could answer it,” Steve pointed out.
Stark looked down at the armor, where a name tag with the words “Tweedle Dum” had been slapped.  “You don’t say.”
DJ looked up at her.  His big dark eyes blinked slowly, his lashes sweeping down.  “Bye,” he said at last.
“No,” Steve said, stirring the pasta.
“Don’t be so impatient,” Shiro told him, taking another bite.  His eyes narrowed, he took his time chewing. “It is good.  If it wasn’t you, it would pass muster.  But you know better.”  He shook his head.  “Ramen can be served quickly, because the time is spent where the diner cannot see.  The broth, the noodle, the ingredients, all of that requires patience.”
“It's not a good idea to ask a guy in spandex about sex stuff,” Peter said.  “If they try, I tell them facts about spiders and that confuses them and also makes them think maybe I have a weird kink that they don't want to know anything more about.”
“That's when I even HAVE a point,” Tony said, nodding.  “Are you certain that Reed needs us on this one?”  He turned his head back towards the holographic schematic that was floating at eye level in front of him.  “We're booked up right now, very busy, it's hard for-”
“Yeah, but he does that to annoy me,” Stark said.  “Thanks for reminding me that he’s still grounded.”
"My body and I have an agreement.  It won't acknowledge pain until we're out of the situation that's causing that pain, 'cause otherwise, I'd probably have a screaming fit at least once a mission, and people hold that kinda shit against you," Clint said.  He twisted around, holding the light stick up.  The light slipped along the dark tunnel, casting eerie shadows on exposed wiring and pipes.  Clint wondered what had come down after them, collapsing the street above them.  He wasn't sure if he should get her up and walking before it could subside any more.
His stomach hurt.
The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away,
“I looked Stark dead in the eye and said-” Clint straightened up, and pressed his fingers to his chest in a theatrical gesture.  “‘Oui.’”
Steve nodded.  “Yeah.  It’s a shame no one ever figure out a way to make dirty clothes clean again.” His head tipped to the side, his eyes narrowed.  “Maybe a machine of some sort.  That could just-” He made an ‘I don’t know’ sort of gesture with his free hand.  “Fix the problem of clothing that had become dirty.”
“For you and DJ,” Steve said, just to clarify.
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis set a small saucer of chopped meat and gravy in front of Furbro, who sniffed delicately at it.
He wasn't sure what he was feeling.  Numb, mostly.  Like none of this was happening, or if it was, that none of it mattered.  Which was wrong, of course, it was happening.  And it definitely mattered.  He knew that, on some level.  But that level seemed far off, a purely intellectual exercise of knowing.  Of realizing.
What even did Hydra do in Utah? Enough to make Fury nervous and send Steve and Natasha on a mission, apparently. Tony tried to go with them, but Fury had said he should look up the word stealth in a dictionary because he ‘wouldn’t find a red-gold suit of armor in it.’ No, Tony had to stay at home and play the host of another charity event.
Two years later, warm rays of sunshine woke Clint. He blinked slowly before he turned his back to the sun and nuzzled into Bucky’s shoulder. His fiancé was awake too, and drew letters on Clint’s naked back, but Clint was too tired to try reading them. He dozed off again with the familiar weight of the metal arm around his waist.
phone that Steve sent him with the stupid letter in the mail like it was still two thousand and fucking seven. It was in his hand, pressed against his ear.
Later he woke to the smell of coffee and the missing warmth of Bucky next to him. A cup of his favorite beverage waited for him on his nightstand. He darined it down, ignored his hearing aids, and searched for his boyfriend.
Steve the number belongs to. Out of an impulse, probably thanks to the alcohol, he pushed the key to dial the number, and now here he was about to tell Steve everything he wanted to tell him for a while.
He took another sip of the vodka bottle and swallowed it down together with the urge to cry.
“You’re a sap.” Clint told him.
stupid
’. Yeah, right.” Tony paused again, thinking how Steve had promised him, they would defeat Ultron
“Have fun dancing boys. I’ll go search for Thor, maybe he’ll dance with me.”
“Tony is right, you know–don’t tell him I said that–we should go and have fun”, and he dragged Clint along on the dance floor. It was a catastrophe, but Bucky didn’t stop, just held Clint close to him and tried to lead the archer. He didn’t even flinch when Clint managed to step on his toes again.
Rhodey and Bruce had seen him carry the phone,he knew that, and they both had that same sad look on their face but hadn’t dared saying anything. It was hard for Tony to give up this last connection, so for now he refused to.
Clint drank straight from the pot, grinned evil at Tony, and than signed something to Bucky, who laughed and signed something back.
He knew he shouldn’t have it with him wherever he went, shouldn’t charge it every evening to make sure it doesn’t run out of energy, he should leave it in a drawer and never take it out again, or even better, just throw it out.
“Why couldn’t you just tell me Barnes killed my parents. You could have done it in the tower where we could have a real talk about it, where I wasn’t already on the edge because of the threat of more super soldiers. Why couldn’t you told me while we searched for Bucky together? Oh right,  you
The archer made a beeline the coffeepot and ignored Tony when he grumbled: “That’s mine, Legolas.”
Today had been a hard day, an exhausting evening and he had went outside to the next liquor store. His penthouse and the communal space of the tower were still an alcohol free zone, a measure put in place because of his last hard day. The team even got J.A.R.V.I.S in to help them keep the alcohol away from Tony, not that Tony couldn’t work his way around that but he rather just go out and buy some himself.
“I think it’s time we have a talk.”
“Remember how we shared that room at Clint’s farm because there weren’t enough rooms for everyone? And you wanted to be a gentleman and sleep on the floor but I insisted the bed was big enough for both of us? I miss that, sharing a bed with someone. I miss sharing my bed with you. I miss you- ” Tony had to clear his throat before he could continue talking. His anger had simmered down and left only the sadness.
“No, scratch that. It wasn’t his fault either. You allowed for it to happen, you allowed it, by not telling me. Why didn’t you just talk to me back than, Steve?  Didn’t you scold me after Ultron that  ‘
Yes, he couldn’t stop his focus from going to Tony and Bucky dancing every time it happened and he doesn’t even knew why, and now Tony had suggested they should?
During the night, Tony was woken up by his boyfriend who slipped underneath the blanket, still partly wet from the shower, and pulled Tony to him.
When he finds Steve, he is going to buy all the pieces of apple pie he ever wanted, he is also going to give a huge tip to this girl.
Natasha looked at their hands, though she didn't say anything. She just shrugged in response to Wanda.
That's when everything went to hell. Because they didn't listen to the footsteps approaching, then a flashlight blind them momentarily.
“Alpha, please,” Tony whined, rubbing his cock up and down, eager for friction, for Steve's touch on him. The Alpha looked to the wet hole, pushing through the rim and sliding a finger inside. Tony breathes out heavily while Steve thrusts a finger in and out of him, quickly adding one more, scissoring Tony’s hole, opening him up to take his knot. “Alpha, I need you, now,” Tony whispered.
"I used to draw when I was a kid." For a moment, Tony thinks he won't continue, but he does."You know, I was a sick and scrawny kid from Brooklyn, so I couldn't play around with the other kids outside, so I drew. " Then, he adds. "And read, I used to read a lot."
"Well..." Tony faces him and Steve wasn't exactly prepared for what came out of his mouth next. "We're gonna steal a car." Steve was kind shock for this statement, that wasn't exactly his idea, in fact, he didn't have any idea of how they would get in California, but surely a robbery wasn't in his plans.
On the other hand, Tony had a bad feeling inside him, all the cells in his body screaming to the danger he was put himself in. Despite all the weaponry, the place does not seem active or with enough people to deal with an attack. Perhaps, they were not waiting for Tony to attack? Come on, that is HYDRA, they are merciless.
"You okay, kid?" He asks pointing the chin to the boy cornered, the sound of Steve's voice made the other three jump and quickly move to a safe distance from the boy who sighed relieved.
"How did you find us?"
Steve observes how the rays of the sun give Tony's tan skin a beautiful light. His eyes looking over the horizon, his defined profile.
Steve got a plastic bottle he had bought in the corner, taking a few gulps of the still cold water, he closes his eyes before throwing the rest of the content on his face, passing his fingers through his hair and the palm of his hand on his face, feeling the blond hair thick growing on his chin. He opens his eyes and jumps backward.
“He has the fame of being a playboy, but he’s not like this, Steve. When he gives out his heart, that’s for real,” she sits down. “I see that you both care about each other. He deserves to be happy, Steve.”
He's still in control despite the numbness of his senses. Steve goes slow, spreading Tony's legs, trailing wet kisses on his inner thighs and sucking the skin down there, leaving marks that only he and his Omega will be able to see. The thought only makes Steve purrs in pleasure.
"We can't risk being caught, Steve." Tony sighs exasperatedly. "This is not the twenty-first United States century, where there are still prejudice but also laws to protect us. People will not be friendly if they know that we date." Steve sighs, he knows that the brunet is right, but he can't deny that he finds it hard sometimes not to shout his love for Tony everywhere. He kept this secret for so long and now that he finally has Tony, he just wanted to tell everyone.
"No! Two million, Capsicle." Steve's jaw drops, stunning.
"What's wrong, Cap? You are strangely quiet since we left the base." Well, Tony knew there are plenty of things going wrong here. "You didn't even yell with me to fuck everything up."
Tony was in their room, in front of a mirror fixing his bow tie when Steve came in. He was wearing a very expensive dark blue tuxedo, not by his choice, it was Tony who bought it and insisted him to wear it. On the other hand, Tony was wearing a black one. Steve approaches him, taking his hands off the tie and fixing it himself.
So, when Tony pulled Steve to a kiss inside the elevator, Steve wraps his arms around Tony’s waist, pulling him even closer and deepening their kiss. They embrace in a hot, suggestive kiss. Steve’s hand runs under Tony’s shirt, caressing his back.
"I assure you that your Captain is having a great time with us, Mr. Stark." Tony blinks, frozen in place, he makes several attempts of speaking, but he couldn't.
Tony took a deep breath. He would come in and take Steve out with him to the safety of their apartment, although HYDRA agents already should know where they've been living the past two weeks. Tony turned around, decided to continue with his plan, well, he only had one plan, a pretty simple one matter-of-factly: Attack.
“Thanks,” the other guy said, placing himself beside the young woman. Steve nodded to both of them politely.
He opens the package and the smell of sugar coming up in the air. Tony puts a few of the colorful gums into his mouth before offers it to Steve. The supersoldier takes a few, while Tony snuggles close to him, Steve passes his arm around the brunet's shoulder, so he can accommodate himself comfortably.
“I know. And I hope Tony can get over it soon,” he heard another pair of heels on the floor. “Look, Pep, I assured the directors that Tony Stark would be in this new campaign, and I need him to be back here,” Natasha insisted, her tone sounded a little demanding, but not threatening.
When the soldier got home, he didn’t expect to see Bucky pacing back and forth in the middle of the room so late at night. Steve furrowed, and Bucky stopped at the sight of the blond, but he kept running his hands on the sides of his jeans.
"I know it's a lot," Tony says. "I think they might've considered you because of the serum. Technically, you're already enhanced, they just need to clone you." There's a bit of worry on his voice.
"What's wrong, Capsicle?" He raises his head to face Tony, the brunet's was pretty relaxed for someone who was attacked, anyway, he was talking about Tony, whose actions were incredibly unpredictable.
“Hey, man. Wanda will be glad that you came,” Pietro shrugged. Steve gave him a cracked smile before following after him, in the middle of the crowd where people were dancing to the electronic rhythm played by the DJ.
Tony walks lost in his thoughts, he leaves his feet to guide him all the way, when he is close to his old neighborhood he walks fast and kind of nervous, looking around to check if he is not being followed, which he thinks is unlikely, but better safe than sorry, right?
"Stop laughing!" Tony says hitting Steve with a towel, which just makes the blond laugh more.
“You’ve been looking for a job for months now, Stevie. Also, SHIELD Clothing is a good opportunity, you have to thank me if you got the job,” Bucky shrugged with a smile on the corner of his lips.
“Well, when Steve asked I could not say no,” Tony said.
"I'm fine. Better than last night, indeed." He shrugs.
Then, they hear someone coming up, the clicks of high heels getting loud, then Pepper shows up beside Peter, she looks in the room that they are.
Breakfast is ready before Tony even gets dressed, he doesn't know how Steve can be so fast in the kitchen, anyway the coffee smells amazing and strong, just how he likes it. Steve doesn't enjoy coffee very much, but he keeps doing it every morning just because he knows how much Tony appreciates it.
"He will, sweetheart."Steve leaves a kiss on the side of his shoulder. "He will."
"Mr. Stark. Look at all the mess you've done just to rescue your Captain."
Steve had lied. The grocery store stayed way more distant than he said, surprisingly it wasn't crowded when they get in. It was a small place with apparently all sorts of food and brands. Tony carries a basket while Steve takes what they need along the aisles.
"What are you doing?" he mouths skeptical.
“I wish she was here.” Steve sighed. Tony knows exactly who he is talking about. The crew doesn’t seem the same without her here. She was the glue who kept everyone together. If she was there, it would be here celebrating the ceremony. She probably would be the happiest person in the party, besides the couple.
Tony leaned over, his mouth hovering just over Steve’s.  “What do you want for it?” he whispered, the words hot against Steve’s lips.
He arched an eyebrow at her, but gestured towards his sister.  “Please.  Whatever you can do.”
Tony paused.  “Sandwiches first.”
“Up and dressed and heading out now.  I will be on time,” he said, before she could bring that up.  Because she would bring that up.  He smoothed a hand over his hair, giving himself a critical look in the mirror.  Not bad.  He'd pass muster.  It certainly did not look like he'd gotten less than ten hours of sleep in the last three or four days.
Stark stopped.  "You, me, Obie, Thor, Rogers and DJ, Pepper and Rhodey," he said, counting them off on his fingers.  "Eight."
“Wonderful.  The dailies are in the billiard room, a couple of locals and a few out-of-town ones, but I don't know how up to date they are.  There's also the library upstairs,” he mused.  “You know where that is, there are books, if you'd prefer a book.”  He stopped.  “Do you like books?”
“You do!  Every important person in your life has looked at you and in under thirty seconds has gone, ‘yeah, you’re full of bullshit, and I’m not dealing with it,’ and that’s the way you like it.  People who respect you have proven that you can play them, that you can sell them whatever nonsense you’re peddling, and therefore, you hate them,” Clint said.  He snatched his map back from Tony’s lax hands.  “Rhodes.  Potts.  Rogers.  The rest of us.  We’ve all looked at you and gone, ‘under that fancy haircut, those smug sunglasses, and ten thousand dollar suit, you’re a mess of a human being who’d prefer to be hiding in his basement playing with his robots,’ and that’s the only reason you tolerate us.”
“Yeah, me, too, I hate having to re-evaluate my prejudices and general parenting, so, let’s just shift gears,” Tony said, leaning an arm on the containment unit.  “Go print out a mailing address, we’re sending a birthday cake to the Baxter building.”
