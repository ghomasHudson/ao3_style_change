“Mister Stane is going on a three day business trip, he won’t be back for your birthday.” Tony sighed. Yet another birthday he would spend alone.

Tony paced back and forth in his apartment, it was almost seven. He was so nervous at how they would react. What if they left? That would suck, Tony didn’t know if he could handle that. God, why was this so difficult. Why did someone have to try and kill him? He could’ve have such an easier life they hadn’t. Everyone showed up slowly and over time. Steve arrived first and the two of them cuddled, which calmed him down a bit, until Natasha and Clint showed up, then Bucky and Bruce who carpooled and Thor who seemed to have walked. He sat down on the couch. He took a deep breath.
“Boss we got everyone is down. Barton was out for a few minutes and we-” She noticed Tony. The Captain raised an eyebrow.
“Does anyone know where Hope, Scott Janet, and Hank are?” He asked.
“How did you guys do it before?” Tony asked. She shook her head.
“Fine. Do. Not. Get. Caught.” Bruce said. Tony gave him a smile and climb around the ship to where the laundry was. He grabbed a tight shirt and some leggings. Taking a deep breath he slowly let himself turn human. He was already dry from hanging on the ledge of the ship. Slowly, so he wouldn’t fall off Tony put on the clothes.
Early Chapter because I'm going away and will have time to write but wifi is bad so probably I won't be able to post. Hence why I'm posting today :)
“He favoured his left side and his never moved his neck so I figured as much.” She said with a shrug. Steve put a hand on Tony's shoulder.
“Am I hungover or like dead?” Tony asked. Steve gasped and looked up.
“Uncle Steve!” She cried as she noticed the old man sitting on the couch. He smiled at her.
“So?” Steve asked.
“Okay, that’s good, so you won’t remember me when I go back. I mean you’ll remember things I tell you but not who told you them. Like say I tell Clint that Tony is planning him a surprise party and then I leave to back home. Clint would know that Tony is planning it but he wouldn’t remember how he knew he would just know.” She explained.
“Hello Morgan. It’s been awhile.” He said. She rushed up to him and gave him a gentle hug, knowing that while he was still a super soldier, he was an old and fragile super soldier. He was very close to Morgan when she was younger. She quickly pulled away and crossed her arms, remembering something.
“I'm 16 you know I can drive.” Tony said.
“I don’t believe you are in any position to be asking that Steven.” Tony said, as he stopped untying the cables.
"She didn't." Happy whispered.
“It’s my mom.” Morgan mouthed. “Well, you see-”
“How does this all tie together?” Steve asked. She held up her hand.
“Are you sure?” Bucky asked.
DM me for chats, comments and requests!
“That’s part of it.” Steve said.
“How do you remember that?” Clint said. “Like the year he did it? Is it in textbooks now or something?”
“How are we going to get past the receptionist?” Steve asked before the doors opened. Tony looked at him as if he was insane.

“You guys met Stark at least once each, and even if you didn’t what he did ten years ago is proof enough that she’s bound to do something stupid. She’s Stark’s daughter in mind and body, if we don’t get her back soon, things will happen, probably irreversible things.” Bucky said. Steve hadn’t even thought about that. He was too busy trying to get her back, not realizing that she might be messing with the past. Steve took out his phone.
“You can’t do this Morgan. We’re okay now.” Clint said.
“A bomb in case we need a quick get away. It should cause a minor earthquake that will simple shake the building just a bit.” Tony said. “If my calculations are correct.”
“Thank you, thank you, thank you!” He yelled. “I love you both!”
“Hey Pepper it’s Rhodey.”
“Yeah, everyone is here.” Tony said. “Everyone say hi to Pepper!” Tony called as he held the phone out towards the group.
“You may not know me well but I know you pretty well and I like you lot in my time so I figured why not.” She said. He chuckled and ripped it open. He stared questioningly at the device.
“We’re here! We’re here!” Bucky yelled from the elevator. Rhodey, Bruce and Sam behind him.
Her. Natasha
“You’re the first person, not in my family to be so direct with me. I kinda like it. So if you don't have a place to stay, why don't you just stay with me?” Steve asked. Tony looked horrified.
“Aha!” He said pointing at Bucky. “I told you that was the best team! Thank you Tony.” Steve said, leaning back in his seat.
“I’m Tony Stark.” He said, reaching for the railing to try and stand up on his own.
“Oh no.”
“Thanks, I really need help in math.” Steve said.
“Well, Hydra is smart enough to know that they shouldn’t store everything in their computers and they have access to SHIELD’s files so they would store part of it on it’s own and part of it on SHIELD’s. It’ll be encrypted, but I’m sure we can figure it out.” She replied.
“What would happen if I changed the past?” She asked.
“You think we’d poison you?” He asked, looking slightly hurt. Morgan almost snorted.
“Are you sure this is the place?” Clint asked eyeing the forest. Tony nodded.
“Tony, what's wrong?” Steve asked. Tony reached into his pocket and pulled out his wallet. He placed a 50 on the table.
Morgan blew a bubble of her gum as she typed furiously. Her fingers danced against the keyboard faster than Bruce or even Tony. They all stared at her in amazement for a moment before they all went to their own jobs. She stopped typing suddenly and just looked at the screen.
“What I want is for this paper work to make sense! To have this deal be good, not stupid and full of crap.” She muttered. Tony thought for a moment, before walking towards her and taking out JARVIS and handing it to her.
It Tony about a month to track down the one. The one that would take down Obadiah Stone. His Uncle. His father’s friend. His enemy. Obadiah had to die. Tony spent the month doing research and training himself for what was coming. The Captain would not see just anyone and he knew his claim would never be approved, so he would have to take matters into his own hands. He had stashed all different weapons on his body and wore all black. He placed a mask covering his mouth. If he waltzed right in there with no mask he’d be easily recognised and that was not what he wanted. The Captain’s headquarters was based in Brooklyn, of course Brooklyn. Tony hated going down to Brooklyn because of all the turf wars and muggings but tonight he would not hesitate to get rid of anyone who got in his way. Lucky for Brooklyn, no one bothered him. He waited for right time. When most of The Captain’s inner circle was gone. Of course at least one of them was in there but he waited for some of them to be gone. Then he made his move. The guards at the entrance weren’t much of a chore. Inside was a bit harder but Tony managed. Of course he didn't kill anyone and didn't inflict any lasting damage. Just get them out the way. He was right at the doors to The Captain’s office like area. He burst in and The Captain stood up, surprised. That gave Tony conference that he was stealthy enough that he didn't know he here. Tony rushed up towards him and after a small hand to hand The Captain thought he had Tony. He was wrong. Tony had never felt so calm, even though he had a gun to his head.
“Why did she leave without telling us?” Clint asked softly.
“I’m sorry, sir. But no one is allowed up there.” She said. Natasha looked at Steve.
“Of course not.” Steven scoff. Tony looked down, though didn’t lower the wrench.
“It’s not your fault, we should’ve warned you that Pepper was coming over before this happened.” Steve said. “Are you okay?”
“Part of the few that can handle me.” Tony muttered into the phone.
“Turn it down?!” She yelled at Tony. He nodded and did so. Tony, being Tony, listened in but tried not to be obvious.
“Can’t fix what ain’t broke.” Steve reminded her.
“More places to hide” Clint said.
“yeah, that works. I'll meet you in the library at around 7, yeah?”
“Ten minutes of my life?” He said. She took a breath.
Tony had no clue about who he was. He was also discouraged from ever wanting to leave again. He could handle the boy having the rest of the day off.
“I didn't think you would be into football.” Clint said.
“Then it could rip a hole in the ozone layer from gas leakage. But when have my calculations ever been wrong?” Tony said with a cocky laugh.
“Yeah, he was uh, partly bought online and the rest I did myself.” Tony said. Bruce and Tony spent the rest of lunch with Bruce, discussing DUM-E.
Steve was the first one she wanted to get out of the way. He was her first step in fixing the future. She had a great night sleep after Natasha had talked to her and got her to bed. She missed that. Being tucked in by anyone really. The last time she was tucked in it was by her father, the day he left. And never came back. She smiled and ended up in a few clothes Natasha had left for her. They actually fit her which was amazing but not as much because it
“Are you alright?” She asked after he didn’t say anything else. He pulled his knees up to his chest and shook his head.
“A little help please?” Tony asked. Steve turned to him, and all the anger melted away and into concern. Steve rushed over and got the chains off of him. He pulled the smaller boy into his lap, wrapping his arms around him, and Tony immediately leaned into his hug and clutched Steve’s shirt. Tears threatened to spill.
"How are you here?" Bruce asked.
“I’ll take you my place.” He said.
“JARVIS, how did she get in here?” Tony asked.
smart at 17?” Sam asked. Tony was getting uncomfortable again.
“Damn right you should be sorry that desk is nice.” Obadiah yelled at him. Tony took step closer and Steve burst through the door aiming his gun at Obadiah. Only if things could be that easy. Obadiah pulled out his own gun and held it to Tony’s head. “I will kill you both before you even knew the gun went off!” He yelled. Steve knew painicing wouldn’t make this situation any better.
“Okay.” He said as he pulled up to the beach. The two had taken a plane to Florida the drove down to Miami. The house was big and the two looked at each other before rolling their eyes and getting out of the car. They stayed quiet as they walked up to the front door of the large house and ringing the doorbell. Hank answered.
Tony smiled at him and the only thought his brain could come up with, was that Tony looked better with a smile on his face. He looked the adorable when he smiled. Steve paused that thought. Tony could be minor. Wasn’t he a minor?  He mentioned something about being
Morgan was mostly quiet and humming along to the songs that Tony had blasting through the lab. It didn’t bother her much. She would occasionally ask for something but she was mainly doing it on her own. She understood how to make it and was happy to be able to do it on her own. Her phone buzzed in her pocket and Steve’s icon came up.
“I’m from a generation that is not only a terrible, kind of morbid, pun but also holds actually truth behind it.” She replied. It wasn’t an answer but they knew she was getting there. “Generation Phoenix.” She breathed it. “There are so few of us and I understand it.”
“Is it safe?” He asked. “I’ve seen a lot of movies, and half the time the cars are safe but the other half it isn’t.” Tony said.
“Where is Obie going?”
“Generation Phoenix.” She breathed before catching up.
“I’m going on a business trip this weekend and I won’t be around, but I will drive you to school on monday.” She said. Morgan nodded and her mom got but before she left she turned to face her daughter.
“Looked through 100's of online auctions until I found the right items.” He finished for her. She chuckled with a smile.
“How can we warn you if he wants you back like, right away?” Bruce asked. Tony thought for a moment.
“Didn’t your mom tell you no more lab?” He asked. She stuck her tongue out at him.
“I took apart my alarm clock. I’ll fix it again later don’t worry, i’m just trying to make something to use for a bit.” She muttered. “But of course I don’t have all the parts and It won’t work without them.”
“Are you okay?” He asked. Tony nodded again. He turned to the girl, Pepper.
“Aye, we shall not let Tony be afraid.” Thor boomed.
By the time she was done, Morgan was covered with paint, mostly purple which is was she decided to use instead of the old orangish brown color it use to be. Purple was a much better color. But she add some designs so she was pretty much a rainbow of colors. Here normally chocolate brown hair was now blue and green. Her face was covered with colors creating new ones as they mixed. It was mostly dry so she could touch everything without getting paint on it. He stepped back to admire her work. The van was a nice shade of purple and blue with designs of the Avengers on one side and a little memorial of her dad on the other side. She was decent at painting, Steve taught her a lot. They used to have lesson when she was little, he would meet her in the common room at three o’clock every time she was here. She wasn’t as good as him but did it often enough that the van looked good. She looked at her phone. It was 8 o’clock at night.
“Yeah it does.” Morgan said with a lingering smile. They fell into a comforting silence.
Morgan sat down on the couch and took off her quantum-suit. After explaining what happened with her.
“Clint he probably hates me now! I lied to him and then left him! I am the wort living being alive.” Tony said and cried into his arms. Clint placed a hand on his back and rubbed it.
“Isn’t it obvious? I was painting.” She said. “FRIDAY can confirm for me.” They all looked up at the ceiling, which was stupid because she wasn’t in the ceiling.
“Sir, I would suggest leaving this situation. If your heart rate continues to climb, you will require medication.” JARVIS said in a calm voice that filled Tony’s head. He nodded. Without a word, Tony silently ran out of the room and downstairs into the gallery. What was he thinking? He couldn’t do this. Leave and expect things work out find. People were mean. People were evil. People killed his parents. He should’ve stayed home, he couldn't do this. He needed to get home, but he couldn’t do that without Steve and getting to Steve meant go back to where the yelling was, and he couldn’t do that either.
“There are a lot of things that you don’t think you’d do but end up doing.” She muttered. “But no you are correct. None of you would let me. Not even Tony. But no one knew I was doing it. You were just in the building with me. So was Clint.” Morgan explained.
AHH sorta of late, sorry about that hope you enjoy this anyway!
Morgan scrolled through the information and looked around. She found what she was looking for. Her eyes scanned the screen faster than what seemed possible. Her brain worked fast. With a genius father and mother who ran a company, while trying to take care of said father at the same time, their brains had to work fast. Morgan just happened to inherit that. She rolled her eyes and threw her head back.
“Could you do me a favor?” Morgan asked.
“I’m calling her again.” Pepper said.
“Why should I?” He asked.
“Oh my god.” She whispered. Rhodey covered his mouth. It was Tony, they realized.
“You don’t get a say in this Tones!” Rhodey yelled. Morgan didn’t even bother stopping herself from laughing. Clint pushed into the frame.
“Turn around!” He ordered his driver. “Now!” The driver took a massive u-turn, and started to drive back to the city. Unfortunately for Obadiah, they were already an hour out.
“Bucky.” She said.
“Well let's go find her.” Steve said. They looked at him. “We need to talk to her. She
“Here’s my price. We could use a guy like you on our team, join our time and we’ll kill him.” The Captain said. Tony was baffled. It showed.
“Good. Now, take your meds and go to sleep.” Obie said. “I’m not trying to be the bad guy . Don’t make me the bad guy. I am just trying to protect you.” Tony nodded, he understood. Tony was irritating and ungrateful, Obie was so kind to him, and he kept asking him for the one thing he said he couldn’t have. He watched Obie leave, his dominating air leaving with him. Tony sighed and wiped his eyes.
“So, where are we?”
“Alright.”
“Who?” He asked. “About what?” He hung up another punching bag.
“That’s the issue.” Jan said.
“How are you so sure?”
“Th-Thanks you guys.” He stuttered, still smiling, and they stayed like that for awhile. Tony was perfectly content just listening to their stories of customers who were rude, or even downright stupid. He never laughed like this in his whole life. He enjoyed it very much. People were actually kind of fun, and these people were really nice to him. Bucky sighed and stood up.
“Steve! Do you know what you have just done?!” Pepper exclaimed as quietly as she could. “We could have lawsuits filed against us if anyone ever finds out what just happened. He could be a minor, and we could be charged with kidnapping!” She hissed. Steve passed out the coffee Tony had made for them to everyone.
“Pepper? Do you want coffee?” Steve asked her. She groaned and buried her face in her hands.
have to fix on this side of the portal.” She said. “They fix up their side and everything is good to go there but…” She trailed off.
“Something funny?” Bucky asked. His voice was stern and he sounded too much like Tony’s own brother he couldn’t help but smile.
“You are okay Sir, but I recommend taking you medicine as soon as possible. But as of right now you are fine.” JARVIS said. Tony nodded.
“FRIDAY?” Steve asked.
“Please try not to get rear ended.” Scott begged.
“I guess you
“I’m glad you came to your senses boy.” He said as he stood in front of Tony. He slapped him dead across the face. “Just don’t interrupt me next time. I like to finish my insults.”  Tony managed a nod. That slap reminded him of how many slaps Obadiah had saved him from when his father was still alive. There was silence for a second. Tony didn't really want to get slapped again.
“Yes, but could I have some water?” He asked. She nodded and got him a glass of water. He sat up with her support and drank the water.
“I’m okay.” He said, knowing that no one else could hear JARVIS. He felt better now that he knew that Pepper was a friend, but still she looked like she could work for Obie. She had this imposing energy. It frighten Tony a bit. Steve turned and notice the two and half cups of coffee. Tony hadn’t had time to finish pouring the cups of coffee before his mini panic attack.
“I like you.” He said.
“I saw Ty.” Tony whispered looking down again.
“It’s a surprise.” She said and winked at him. He scoffed. She gave him a dazzling fake smile and went over to talk to Natasha. It was a half hour before they had any news.
Tony dried himself off and stood up fully clothed. He stretched out his legs and gave his friends in the water a smile.
“Of course you did.” He said. “Nice work, queens.”
“No lasting injuries. I was careful. I didn't want to kill anyone or even hurt them. No lasting injuries. Just needed them out of the way for a little while so I could make my case.” Tony said calmly. Although, now he was starting to panic. He was outnumbered and outgunned. He needed these people to kill Obadiah. They were his only hope. To his surprise, The Captain smiled.
“I can confirm that Morgan was indeed painting.” She said.
Tony how unfair it was. Tony made a small noise in the back of his throat and Steve almost pulled away.
“So you’re saying she’s trapped, whether we built the portal or not!” Scott exclaimed.
“Maybe. Not right now though.”
“Hmm, that's nice being able to travel. Do you have a place to stay?” Steve asked. Tony stifled a laugh.
“You sound like Bruce.” He muttered. Tony had no idea how to respond to that. The Captain lowered his gun and walked back to his seat. Tony sat down as well, keeping his hands on a pistol strapped to his thigh. “So, what do you want?” The Captain asked.
"You obviously weren't doing your english essay judging by the fact that you’re covered in paint. So what were you doing?” Bucky asked. She shrugged. Although on the inside she was panicking.
Morgan sat at her window of her new room. She was clean and paint free. She had stole Tony’s old AC/DC shirt and Natasha’s shorts. She stared out the window in thought. Nothing had happened yet. No Ultron, No Sam, No Bucky, No Civil War, No Thanos and No funeral. Everything was good and happy. No one was dead. Everyone was Happy. In her time they were happy too but here, everyone was happy. Everyone was alive. Maybe she could help them. Change the future. She pulled her phone out and dialed Bruce’s number.
build that. That would be so simple. He had built things ten times more complex in his sleep. Tony cocked his head to the side again. He did that a lot when he was confused, Steve noted. Almost like a child or a dog trying to understand something.
I love Kudos and comments and thank you so much again <3
“Whenever there’s a loud noise, it usually means I did something wrong.” Tony said quietly.
“No” she said giving him a small smile.
“Alright.”
“Morgan!” Steve exclaimed. “How did you ever come to that conclusion?”
“Yeah. Really, don’t believe me I can call future you and ask.” Morgan replied. Clint shook his head and stood up. He seemed better after she assured him that his judgement was good.
“Threat?!” She exclaimed. “I swear guys! Cut it out! This isn’t funny!” She cried.
“Oh, well I am not. I just know someone who goes there and is on the team.” Tony said.
“Who are you?” The man asked. Tony stood a bit straighter.
“No no.” Clint said. “He might recognize her.”
to keep being friends and it
“Wait, today?” Bruce asked. “Today is his birthday?”
She watched with a large real smiled, and yet tears in her eyes as she noticed Tony kiss back.
“Do you have the papers?” Tony asked, meekly. Obadiah smiled and walked over to a safe in the wall.
“Is it true Mister Stane is planning on giving up the company!”
“I’m sorry but this gift didn’t come with a receipt.” She said. Steve could tell she was smiling.
“Cut the crap Tony! I’m worried out of my mind about you! You said you were getting better and that you would take over the company three months ago! Then you practically cut off contact with me! Tony I love you but you’re worrying me sick.” She cried.
“What?” Bruce whispered.
“So I’m stuck here and there’s still more bad news?” She asked.
“O-okay.” Tony muttered. Steve offered him his arm. Tony rolled his eyes and interlocked their arms. “You dork.” He giggled.
“To the doctor’s silly. I told you, you have an appointment it was the only one we could get.” She said.
“Ahem.” One of them, most likely Clint, said. Tony looked up.
“Those are tomorrow.” Steve said. Tony blinked.
“You lost?” He asked. “I could take you home.” Tony did not like the smile on this man’s face.
“No promises,” She said, seriously. “But I’ll try.” She could tell he nodded.
Wait - hot? Did Tony just think of Steve as hot? Was that even allowed? Tony had seen romcoms, and even a few Hallmark movies around the Christmas season, but not one of them had shown two guys getting together. Tony did his best to shrug it off.
“Shut up!” Tony said pointing the wrench at him. “Now, I have a proposition for you... Do you want your stuff back?” Tony asked.
“Ty?!” Pepper exclaimed. “that's a complete violation of the restraining order. I swear those things are useless.” pepper said. Steve put a hand on Tony's arm. He flinched for a second but it only took another second for Tony to lean into the touch. Steve gave Tony a smile and Tony smiled back.
“It’s all finished! You like it?” Obie smiled brightly at the boy.
“That’s enough for now. Thanks for checking in guys I’ll see you again soon.” She said.
“Did…Did you make coffee for us?” Steve asked. Tony nodded slowly.
“Virginia Potts speaking, how may I help you?” She asked.
“But what?” Steve said.
“What?” Pepper asked, she was desperate for anything that could lead to Tony.
“What was that about?” Tony asked not looking up and also not bitter that he could hear what she whispered into the phone.
“High school is a waste of time.” Tony informed him. Bruce nodded.
“I’d say Natasha.” Bruce said.
“Probably, but it’s too late now, we should trust him.” Steve said, looking around for Tony. Pepper walked up beside them.
“I'm alright Pep.” Steve heard Tony say. He then proceeded to see Tony and breaks a robot. Then Tony turned to Steve. “Thank you Steve, I'll explain Monday.” Tony said and gave Steve a hug. Steve hugged him back. “Tell the others I'm all right. I'll see you Monday.” Tony said as he was whisked away to answer some questions from the police officers and firefighters. Steve nodded dumbfoundead even though Tony couldn't see him.
“He killed my parents, then proceeded to kill my only other family when I asked for something that was mine. If he ever finds out I'm here two of my best friends wollt share the same fate.” Tony said. He was careful to keep no emotion in his voice. There was a short silence but one that was there.
“I don’t know how you get into these situations Stevie.” He said. Steve guestered for Tony to sit.
“Yep, you two had an argument and you both said bad things. I remember that story. He told me it too.” She said. Steve’s face held a faint smile.
“How did you-?”
“I swear if I had been two steps closer that asshole would have been dead.” Rhodey yelled.
“Wait, so it's Tony alright?” Steve asked.
“None that we know of, sir.” He replied out loud. Tony jumped forgetting it was on speaker. He pressed a button to turn it off.
“All right. Under my kings orders.” He said and sadly swam off.
“Three days?!” Most of the group exclaimed. Bruce didn’t, he knew how it was being caught up in your work.
“How do I know I can trust you.” He demanded. She looked down.
Tony stood in the lab, creating devices to help them finish the mission. Morgan had saved his life and now it was time to return the favor. Help her get her life back. He heard the glass door open and glanced over to see Steve. He smiled before continuing to finish his device.
“Wait what?” He asked. “You want me?” The Captain nodded.
“Thank you Natasha!” Tony called after her. He could’ve sworn, he saw her smile. As if she didn’t hear ‘thank you’ all that often. Tony let out a breath.  He'd have to bath, if he didn't Steve would know. He smelled like salt water and fish, which humans didn't like. But if he got wet, he’d turn back into a merman. Slowly, he took off his clothes and got in. Within in ten second he had his tail back. He prayed no one would come in. That would be bad. The bath was nice, despite the anxiety of someone walking in. It wasn’t like the ocean, it was so warm and bubbly. Getting out was a huge issue. He ended up face down on the floor.
July 4th was America’s birthday. And as luck would have it, July 4th was also Captain America’s birthday. She walked downstairs and smiled at the decorations people were putting up. Red white and blue streamers hanging from the ceiling. She leaned on the doorway watching Clint standing on a chair trying to a hang a banner. She watched as he wobbled and almost fell.
“Well let’s go kid.” He said. The two of them left to go down to the lab. It was like Morgan’s dream come true. Going to her dad’s lab with him. It was great.
“I’m guessing the damn thing blew up?” She asked. There was no response. She rubbed her head. “Look, I’m sorry, I know this happened last time but I didn’t think that pressing the buttons would make it blow up!” She cried.
him we’ll need to de-brainwash him.”
What surprised everyone the most, was that Tony knew which utensils use and when. He had perfect table manners and even thanked the staff. Steve let his jaw drop a few times which Bucky had to tell him to close it. All four times. After dinner was the three of them having a nice chat. Tony talked about his brother a bit and a bit about Bruce, but he mostly listened to the two brothers fight with each other. It made him think about how much he missed his own brother. It was nice to be in company nonetheless. But everyone was exhausted and they all headed off to bed. Well almost everyone.
“I’m not sure, he’s obviously been through something, but I’m not sure what. His parents were killed, like he said before, and for the entire walk over, he jumped whenever a car honked. He always walked behind me, and never next to me. He doesn’t hate people… he just…” Steve trailed off not really knowing what to say.

“It doesn’t work like that.” Scott said.
“I'm Prince Steve Rogers.” Steve said. Tony’s eyes widened. He was a prince himself and he knew the correct etiquette. Tony shoved away and tried his best to bow.
“If you don’t know for sure than you should go for it!” Tony called from behind her. She stifled a laugh.
“Where were Tony and I?” Natasha asked. “We heard everyone else and yet we didn’t see nor hear us, and if Tony were there we’d definitely heard him.”
“What do you mean it’s me, Morgan.” She said. and opened her eyes to see all the avengers standing over her. But it wasn’t her avengers. She screamed and pushed herself into the wall behind her. “What the hell.” She whispered. She looked at everyone of them. They were all there. Tony… he was there. He was staring at her. He was real. She did everything in her power to not run up to him and hug him. Besides all their weapons were aimed at her. She did not feel like getting shot today.
Waiting for the man to wake up was like torture to Tony. He watched the man’s chest rise and fall, nervously. What on earth was he going to do when he woke up? When the man finally started stir, Tony began to panic, and ran to side, out of sight and hidden in the shadows of the room. As the man woke, he instantly started to struggled, finding he was tied.
“Okay, here.” Morgan said as she looked down at her tracker. Steve turned off the car. The group had been driving for hours. Morgan had lost track of how long it was but she knew it was at least four hours. They had been tracking Bucky and he had been on the move for awhile. She lost track of what state they were in as well. Everyone got out of the car and looked around.
“Well I’m out. I don’t feel safe around all these people.” Bruce said.
Tony snuck off to the beach, outside his window.
“Go Go Go!” He yelled showing people the way out of the line of fire. “This way! Hurry!” The rest of the team we're doing their jobs perfectly. They were like a well oiled machine out there. Working in perfect sync with each other. He heard yelling through the comms and couldn't help but be captivated by the sight of this team working this well. It was beautiful. He heard Peggy from the comms shouting out who was where and which of the men needed to be taken out first. If Tony had been doing his job correctly, maybe things would've turned out just a little bit better. But he blames that on the team working too well. He heard her before he saw her. Pepper. Pepper freaking Potts, yelling his name, looking for him. Tony cursed under his breath. A few months of training taught him to watch his surroundings and he saw a gun man aim for Pepper. There was no way, after all his work, he would let her die. No. He bolted towards her, not even noticing that shots were getting less and less frequent. “PEPPER” he yelled and dove in front of her. It was like the world stood still again. Almost like he was back in the office, the day Jarvis died. Everything went so slow. The bullet priced his skin and pure agony was all her felt. Pepper covered her mouth as she realized who it was and what he had just done. “Sorry.” He muttered with a smile on his face.
“Yeah, I just haven’t ever walked that far before.” Tony huffed. “JARVIS, I am alright, right?” He asked his A.I quietly.
"Why is it so hard for you to believe you're in Avengers tower?" Steve asked.
“What do you mean heart attack?” Natasha asked.
“Land.” Bruce said.
“If I take you to see the fireworks, you’ll forget any of this ever happened?” He asked. Tony nodded.
“Well, I made mine.” She said quietly. “I know the cost. I know what can happen but it’s worth it. I know it will be. Have fun.” She hung up and huffed.
A lot of people treated Morgan better than others after losing Tony. Rhodey, Pepper, Happy, Steve and FRIDAY. They all treated her differently than other people. Well, Pepper was understandable considering she was her mother. But it was strange to her. Morgan assumed it was because she was alike her father in many ways. She was a genius, her hair and eye color were practically the same as his, her personality was similar. She was basically a smaller Tony. (Which was saying something.) She did, however, inherit a few things from her mother, like the ability to stare down an entire room and make grown men afraid of her and she had her Mother's pale skin tone and freckles. Like her aunts and uncles would say, she was the best of both of them.
“Certified.” She replied. He smiled.
“Y-yeah… yeah, of-of course.” He said. He found some cables he hadn’t used, grabbed a chair from the kitchen, and tied his torse to the chair. He looked inside the bag the man had, and took his camera away. There was also a sketchbook inside, along some papers, amongst them the floor plans of the building. The papers were articles that made Obie seem like a monster, Tony frowned at them, then shoved everything inside the bag along with the camera. He decided that he should hide the bag, and knew the best place too. He walked into the elevator and opened a compartment inside of it one that only he knew of. He used it often to hide things from Obie. He placed the panel back on and smiled. He had a plan.
“Yeah, I’ll be okay.” He nodded. She ruffled his hair and he smiled. He was feeling better. She had his back. They all did. He’d be okay. They walked out to the others and waited for instructions.
“JARVIS?” She questioned. “Man that’s weird to say.”
“Obadiah killed him. Along with Howard and Maria.” Tony said. Steve frowned slightly at hearing Tony calling his parents by their first name. But wasn’t his business. “He has guards on you. Ready to shoot at anytime. Phone’s were bugged couldn’t tell you. I couldn’t risk it. I did research and found these people. The deal was I joined them and they would kill Obadiah.” Tony said. The pair looked Steve. He shrugged.
“Yes, Captain Rogers?”
“So by found you mean?”
Tony’s head was spinning as he woke up. He tried to open his eyes but the light was too much and gave him a huge headache. He didn’t want to move or do or say anything ever again. The memories from the other night came flooding back to him. Obie, how could he have done that. It was almost too much to believe. Tony took slow breaths to calm himself down. He didn't need to have another heart attack. They hurt like hell. He should be happy to be alive. If he was alive. Oh God he was alive right? Tony opened his eyes and finally heard the all too familiar beeping noise from next to him. He was in a hospital room. At least he wasn’t dead. Right? He looked over to his side to see Natasha curled up into a hospital room chair.
“Ready to come home?” Obie asked. Tony nodded tears starting in his eyes.
“Yes, I did.” Bruce said. “What of it.” He  said carefully.
“Not now FRIDAY.” He replied. “So does that mean she’s in trouble or just trying to surprise you?”
“Uh guys.” Bruce said, staring at something. “I think I found him.” They all went to Bruce and saw him, sitting alone at a table with a cup of what Morgan hoped was water and not vodka. Steve started towards him but Morgan held up her hand.
“What are you getting Steve for his birthday?” She asked. He snorted.
“What!? Know! There is no way I'm doing that here. There are people around me!” Tony exclaimed into his phone. His entire table looked up now, paying attention to everything he did.
“I’m sorry I couldn’t tell you before. I understand if you hate me.” Tony said. Steve grabbed his shoulders and kissed Tony. They both pulled away and Steve embraced him.
“I’m not sure. The amount of cell phones being used in the area and the fact that he may be moving is interfering. We’ll just have to look around.” She replied. They did. The group didn’t exactly split up. They stay within eyesight of each other.
“Oh, to our beach. It’s nice, your room’s balcony oversees it all.” Steve said.
“Ow…” He muttered. His towel was just out of arm's reach and Tony ended up awkwardly flopping a few feet to the towel so he could dry himself off and be human again. It’d be nice to not have worry about someone walking in on him. It took awhile, since his hair was wet and he was inside, but he was able to dry off and he had legs again. Wrapping the towel around himself, he walked out into the large bedroom, on the bed, thing, there was a pair of clothes, just as Natasha said. They were fancy and nothing like the clothes he was wearing when climb aboard. They weren’t comfortable, quite the opposite really, but different. He could get use to this. In time of course. He couldn’t wait to tell Bruce what happened. There was a knock on the door. Tony was busy trying to tame his mess of hair. Underwater, hair was always floating and Tony’s hair was a large mess of knots and waves on land. “Come in.” He said distractedly. Steve came into the room.
“Parents?” Tony asked. She let out a breath before she laughed slightly, humorlessly.
“Of what?” He asked.
“So much like your father.” Bruce said. It sounded wet. She smiled and laughed with tears in her eyes.
“N-N-No.” Tony said. “Just let me watch them, I’ll-I’ll go home straight after. I just need to see them!” Tony exclaimed. “Plus the people who took me here are - they’re really nice.” Obie scoffed.
“No just cursing my luck.” She replied.
“You could always come down to my lab if you’d like.” Tony said. Morgan looked up with shock and awe.
“Sorry to leave soon but I gotta go and besides I’m sure you’ll want to spend to some time as a team together.” She said with an easy smile. Natasha smile faintly and nodded to her.
“Hiiiiiii Pepper~” The entire group said in a flirty tone.
“He's joining us if we agree to take down his target. And passes the background check.” The Captain said
“Murder.” Tony replied with a smirk although he couldn’t see it.
“Hey Tony, before I say anything, is someone there with you?” She asked. He was too impatient to notice her tone of voice.
he calls claiming to have news.
“Look, I gotta go home. But there’s an issue that
_________
“What about her? She knew the risk and she made her choice!” Clint yelled back.
Steve and the others rushed over to Stane’s tower. They burst through the door, scaring the receptionist.
“Whatever she did it worked. I’m not even going to question it.” Bruce said, following Natasha. Tony raced Clint to Bruce after he had caught up. Steve looked around before he noticed something strange. It couldn’t be, they had been early. Hydra. He ran towards the group who was at the car now. They looked confused and worried at him as he was running fast.
It was Tony’s. Obadiah was dead. Tony dropped the gun and fell to his knees. Steve rushed over to where he was now on the ground. He hugged the smaller man to his chest. Steve pet his hair.
“Excellent, Sir. It should be complete in just another five minutes.” Tony smiled. With the mobile JARVIS, he could have him with him wherever he went. If one day he
“Okay.” He said. She lit up and he thought it looked good on her. That a smile belonged on her face, that she was born with one. She laughed and slumped back into her chair and let out a breath.
“What year is it there?” Rhodey asked pulling Pepper phone back into his hands.
done a lot of stuff for us. She saved Tony’s life. We have to thank her.” Everyone knew that he just wanted to see her one last time. Everyone did. They’d grown attached to her, which was dangerous in their line of work but, hey, they were affectionate people. They simply nodded and everyone went off to their rooms to get ready.
“Yes that will be all Ms. Potts” He replied. Morgan smiled and Rhodey took the phone from her. Morgan figured it was because she was choking up.
“Oh right. I forgot about that m-Pepper was allergic.” Morgan said slightly panicked that she almost said Mom.
“Enough time for me to say B- when people ask me what's my type, when they mean dating.” Tony said, looking up at Steve. It was too quick for anyone to see coming. Or at least Tony because he was oblivious. Steve pressed his lips against Tony's. He made a noise of surprise then melted into the kiss. Steve pulled away and Tony missed the warm of Steve against him.
“This way, we’ll let him explain when he wakes up.” Natasha said. Pepper smiled sadly. She liked how Natasha said when.
“Couldn’t have waited two days!” He exclaimed as he handed Natasha a 20.
“You look adorable like that. And short.” Bruce said.
“That’s them?” He asked. Tony nodded.
“Alright. Thanks Tony, be careful alright?” Clint said. Tony gave him a soft smile and nodded.
“Bad news.” Peter said. “First is that your suit, only had enough to go there and not back.” She sighed.
“Bye, platypus.” Tony said.
“You think Hydra hasn’t had him target a kid before. I doubt it.” Tony said.
"Jeez man, don't do that." She said, her hand on her chest.
“I’m sorry, but that floor is Mr. Stane’s, and no one is allowed to go up there unannounced.” She said, her polite tone of voice painfully fake.
“He was adrift for at least a week. I offered him a place to stay here. Just for a little while.” Steve said.
Morgan sat at the window seat of her room and held her phone tightly and took a breath. That was it, she was actually going to do this. Her hands were actually shaking as she pressed the call button. The phone shook ever so slightly as she raised it to her ear.
Tony sat up and wiped his face with his shirt sleeve. It smelt like Steve. It made Tony want to cry again. He missed Steve. He missed them all.
“Three days.” He replied.
“Pep, listen, I'm just a little busy, I promise I’ll meet up with you soon. For lunch or something, ‘kay?” Tony tried.
“All security personnel report to the lobby immediately! I repeat all security personnel downstairs now!” Steve smiled, and slipped away behind the desk and in the midst of all the confusion. Not a soul noticed him.
“I think she’s with Val!” Rhodey exclaimed.
“I’ll be back I swear!” Tony yelled as he was pulled out of the castle. It took everybody a full two minutes before Steve went after them. Everyone else just looked at each other and waited for Steve. He came back with his head lowered.
“Well, how do I explain this. Okay. So the government gave some German scientists a deal after World War 2 and Zola was one. He and a few other Hydra agents expanded and well they have a hold on SHIELD.” She replied. “But that’s not to say
“Not really, no. I just I have to say something. I-” Tony’s phone rang. It was Pepper again. Tony rolled his eyes. “Okay, now i'm really sorry. It’s Pepper and she’ll kill me if I don’t answer.” He said.
“Land? Tony are you insane? You could get killed if someone finds out! Or experimented on!” Clint yelled pulling Tony into his chest.
“You’ll have to go up to her room, she’s probably listening to music while she works on her english essay.” Sam said. Happy frowned.
“Jarvis-” His voice broke. He took a breath and swallowed. “Jarvis is dead.” He said. Pepper covered her mouth.
“So?” He replied.
“Morgan?” Steve asked frantically over the phone. “Is everything okay?” She took a deep breath and steadied herself.
change the past she probably would never be born. She missed Natasha a lot.
“There’s a back door?!” Steve exclaimed. Tony leaned away from him.
Suddenly, the clattering stopped in the next room over. Tony froze, unsure of what the outcome was. Was Steve dead? Had Steve won? He slowly peaked around the corner, to see Steve tying up Obadiah with same cords that Tony had tied Steve up with. He smiled at the thought, and proceeded to fall on his face.
“Come on. You need to sleep.” Steve said. Tony stood up and cocked his head to the right. “You can sleep on the pull out bed on the couch in my room.” Steve said and motioned for Tony to stand up, then walked him to his room.
“I love you too, mom.” Morgan replied as she sat up.
"Hello, Uncle James, and Uncle…" she hesitated. Uncle sam was patriotic and he was Captain America. After ten years she still hasn't found a good substitute.
So maybe high school didn’t suck completely.
“How are the Avengers doing in the future?” Steve asked. She chuckled and again.
“Well, I guess I am. I didn’t mean to, really. I was just trying to find out what the van did.” She said.
“How do you know about that?” He hissed.
“Do it.” She said. Tony looked confused as Bucky, Clint and Thor held him down.
“Do you not want me to call the police for you trespassing?”
“How are my people skills?” He asked as he splashed water onto his face.
“We have his back.” Bruce said.
“Aye! A most wonderful day.” Thor exclaimed. The two smiled and sat closer as they were now out in the open. It was nice. These people cared about him and had no idea who he was. This was true friendship. Maybe he shouldn’t lie anymore, tell them who he really is. He figured Natasha already knew on some level. He had built Bucky a new arm to replace the old prosthetic but he didn’t want to give it to him in case. He was dying to do all of it.  He would tell them. Of course not in school.
___________
“Don’t yell, Buck. Listen I can-”
“Well,” Clint said, throwing his arm over Tony shoulder. “Now you have friends! Which gives you a social life by default.” Tony smiled. It would be nice to have more than two friends, that weren't after his money. Even if it was only for a little while.
“What I need to know is what happened?” Pepper asked Rhodey.
“Well that is literally fantastic!” He exclaimed. Everyone looked towards him now. Wondering what was so great. “But why didn’t mom or Howard call?”
The two clashed, and although Obadiah was the only one with a weapon, he
“I’ll go with you.” Bucky said. Steve nodded again before turning back to Pepper, who was sitting next to Rhodey, and placed a hand on her knee.
“Uh, I thought we were going to see the fireworks.” Tony said. Steve raised an eyebrow.
“Thank you.” He said. She smiled back and nodded.
“I didn’t ask you.” Steve said rolling his eyes. “Are
“I love you 3000.” He said before it retreated back into her hand. She placed her head on her knees and took a shaky breath.
“Is she alright?” Janet asked. This family was also a little protective over her. Not as much as the Avengers but still protective. They enjoyed her intellect and liked having her around. Morgan had that ability. She could grow on anybody.
“Trust me, it’s worth it.” She said. He shrugged and nodded.
“Come over here Tony, we’re going to watch T.V” Steve said motioning for Tony to come over.
“Enough beating around the bush, what happened to her?” Hank asked.
“You too seaweed brain.” Clint said hugging him back. “Now where are you going that you don’t want dad knowing?”
“Prove to me that I’m your ‘Auntie Tasha’” Natasha said. Morgan chuckled and nodded.
“I don't care. I just can't tell it. I'm not entirely sure if I understand what happened.” Tony said.
couldn’t do it and he
“Rhodey?” Pepper asked. Wasn’t he supposed to be with Tony?
“Hey Morgan, what’s up?” Bruce asked as he answered.
“I love you, Tony.” She said sincerely.
“Man, you’re so lucky that your coming-of-age-power was the ability to turn human.” Bruce muttered.
the Pym Particles.” Hope said.
“You guys want to come over today? My apartment is cool. I got video games and movies.” Tony asked, leaning to Steve. The group nodded and murmured different acceptances. “Cool, I’ll see you guys around seven, yeah?” This was it. He was going to tell them. Oh God, he was going to tell them.
“She asked me not to tell anyone.” Bruce said. Steve gave him a look.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?” Steve croaked out.
“I thought you guys left me there.” Tony said softly.
“Yeah, a fire escape or a fail-safe if anyone who isn’t supposed to be inside the building gets in. Sort of like you.” Tony said. The elevator opened and they moved quietly behind the  receptionist and through a door that Steve hadn’t even noticed.
“Are they functional?”
“Actually it’s not that bad.” She said. “All the people you trusted are good. You wouldn’t be as calm as you were if most of them were Hydra.” Clint looked up at her.
“Hey Tony, what’s up?” Steve asked. Tony breathed heavily trying to catch his breath.
“Give your phone to our past selves for a minute okay?” Clint said.
will go to D.C and pick up a friend for me, then drive with him to San Francisco.” He frowned.
“Alternate universe interference. Pepper and Rhodey sound different to be too.” She said. It was a complete lie of course but it was the best she could come up with on the spot. “What about Hank and Janet?” She asked, turning the subject back to science in hopes of distracting anyone about to question her logic.
Comments are loved!! Seriously LOVED
“I'm going to kill that asshole.” Rhodey said. “you guys stay here and if things get worse call an ambulance. Tony, call Pepper or so help me.” Rhodey said as he walked off. Tony pulled out his phone as his friends surrounded him to try and calm him down.
“We’ll call you if we get anything.” Clint said. Steve nodded and the two set off.
“O-Obie.” Tony pleaded making sure to add desperation in his voice. He was faking, but no one in the room knew that. “J-just let me go. I’ll sign the paper and leave p-please don’t shoot.” He begged. Obadiah growled and tossed Tony off to the side and he landed on his stomach. Which was not good for his wound. Steve’s eyes widened and almost shot his gun, but Obadiah still had his gun aimed at him and he knew Tony would kill him if he died. It was a standoff. Neither one of them moved. A gun shot rang out in the small office. Steve’s eyes went wide and he stiffened. It wasn’t his gun that went off.
Tony stared at the large, transportation device. He had seen them in the movies and on TV. shows, but he had never actually been this close to one. Let alone actually been
“I think you should try asking  them about themselves, or discussing topics you know about.” He replied. Tony thought for a moment.
“Bucky.” He said, testing it out. “It’s familiar.” Steve smiled. Morgan reached out for Bucky’s hand slowly. Making sure he saw what she was doing and had plenty of time to pull away. He didn’t, however he flinched every so slightly when she did make contact.
“That's what you think.” Tony muttered, still struggling. Not very hard since his wrist and eye and neck and head all started to hurt. Natasha pulled off his glasses and pulled down his sleeve and his collar. They all gasped and let him go. Natasha simply crossed her arms.
“What?” Steve asked.
"So," Steve said. "You're up late."
“Which supplies us with an issue because the Particles are in his house so we need a distraction to get him out. But before that we need to break into his company.” She said. “We need to grab a key card from his daughter Hope. She is the assistant to the new CEO of his company. We also need to grab her phone.”
“I’m telling you Buck, I think I love this one.” Steve said, slumping down in the chair next to his brother.
“It is fairly simple and straightforward.” Tony informed them.
“Show them what you can do.” The Captain said. Tony didn't know what at first but then nodded and pressed the button on his neck.
“I know those floor-plans like the back of my hand, how did I miss that?” Steve asked. Tony shrugged.
“You don't have to apologize Tony.” Natasha said. “your house literally burned to the ground, you didn't overreact.” Tony smile that her reassurance.
“Got that right.”
“You helped him?” Bucky asked. Tony nodded.
“We’re going?” He asked.

“As long as you’re happy I don’t care.” Bruce said writing something down. He didn't even bother to look up.
“Sort of, it’s just, your nicknames for each other-”
“I can’t believe you’ve never watched Star Trek.” Tony complained to Clint almost four hours later. He had somehow ended up on the couch between Sam and Steve. He was small and found he fit comfortably with his legs crossed.
“With you, in the castle? But I'm a commoner!” Tony exclaimed.
“That was a rollercoaster ride of emotions, it went from annoyed to angry to upset then happy in like five seconds, how on earth did you do that?” Sam asked. She shrugged pulling out her waffles.
“What?” She asked plainly.
“Your choice.” She said. “I just think you should tell him. Why can’t you tell him again?”
Pepper banged on his bedroom door, loudly.
“You scared me!” She yelled. “What in the ever living hell are doing?!” She asked. Tony laughed.
“Hey Tony?” Clint asked with a tone that made Tony know he should run away. Instead he just sighed.
convince Obie to let him go see the fireworks, he would be able to experience it with JARVIS. Tony smiled at the earpiece, It was prefect. All he needed now was a way to find the fireworks. And of course, Obie’s permission, but it looked like that wasn’t happening this year. He would have to wait for next year.
“It’s right this way.  This is the main entrance, up those stairs is the bedrooms and down this hallway is the dining room and that hallway is the ballroom and offices.” Steve said. Tony nodded taking it all in. Tony looked past the stairs to two glass doors.
“This.” The Captain said and tossed up a pencil. Tony, thinking fast, aimed and fired. The pencil exploded and everyone stared in awe at. Expect for the girls and The Captain. “How long did that take you make?” Tony shrugged.
“No but I
“Tony calm down before you give yourself another heart attack. And yes you can do this, you finished college and your only 16. High school is a step down.” She said.
“Stevie, loosen your grip, you’re going to dent the steering wheel.” Bucky said. “If you haven’t already.” He said, giving it a strange look. Steve sighed and listened to Bucky and let ago a bit.
be able to come home.” Obie said shoving the bag into Tony’s hands.
“Prince Bucky.” Tony said politely and bowed his head.
“Don’t do that, I need my camera, Steve! This isn’t a joke you promised!” The two started to argue, and it just got louder from there. Tony tried to cover his ears, but it didn’t much.
“I wish it was the latter but judging that it’s Morgan, I’d say the former.” Sam said.
“All of them?” Pepper asked. Morgan nodded.
“Dismal, you’re getting picked up.” She said. Tony frowned. By who and why. He packed up his stuff up and walked to the door. He would have to be careful. This person, whoever was picking him up, could be his killer. Steve and Bucky waved to him. He saw them but wasn’t sure what to do. He was kind of nervous. He guessed it showed on his face because he saw Steve give him a concerned look before the door close and he made the long walk to the front door.
“Same.” He replied. They hung up. Tony pressed his phone to his forehead. “That’s why i’m doing this.” He muttered softly. Tony turned and walk to Steve. “What’s up? Something wrong?”
Scott, Hope, Janet and Hank all sat down around Steve and Bucky. Cassie was upstairs. They hadn’t said anymore then that.
“So you need more power?” Clint asked.
“Who said anything about being healed.” Tony said.
“It wasn’t on the floor-plans, if someone was really committed, they’d find the floor plans and block every exit.” Tony stated simply. “Where are we going?” Steve sighed.
“You’re something else Tony Stark.” She said with a head shake.
“If it’s a problem I’ll just leave. It’s not a big deal, really. I’ll find something it’s really not a big deal.” Tony said. It really wouldn’t. He’d just go back home. It’d hurt a bit but he’d manage.
“Where am I?” She asked.
“No! Two minutes and I can go, I’m sure is fine.” Tony said. “He wouldn’t let you leave if he wasn’t.”
“Good.” Tony said as he put down the wrench, and moved to untie the man.
“Tony!” Pepper scolded. “What the hell were you thinking? You should tell people who are going to be around you about these things!”
“Agreed.” The group, even Cassie, got piled into one car. A few of them sat in the trunk which was apparently hilarious to Cassie. Bucky and Scott were in the trunk while Steve drove Hank sat next to him and the girls sat in the backseat,
stuck in the past after all.”
“Damn it.” Tony muttered.
Morgan spent her day lounging around. It was nice. Being able to do these things with the Avengers, the original ones.
“R-really?! Are you sure?!” She asked.
“Is that not normal? To be able to build things?” Tony asked.
she’d be back there at seven and they’d know she left. If they were going to know, might as well do it in style. Yeah, she really was Tony’s kid. She started off towards the woods.
“What are we going to do with him? I mean the fireworks aren’t for a little over 24 hours.” Sam asked.
“She’ll be okay. I promise.” Steve said and put his hand on her shoulder.
Tony lied down and closed his eyes. His bed at home was
of things, but you’ll be filled in later. Look, I’m going to send Steve Rogers over,
“It’s doable.” She replied. “Okay we can handle this, we just gotta do some stuff here and there. It’s good I can do it. Thanks Peter.”
The game was nothing special, but it was nice to be included. Bruce and him had a very heated discussion on how weird football was. Steve even made the winning touchdown, or at least that's what he had been told. He didn't really get what was going on. After the game, they went to a small diner just the friend group.

“Can’t he wait, like two minutes? Bruce can stall for two minutes!” Tony complained.
“What is it? What happened?” He asked, Clint right behind him.
"Not without making a patriotic joke" she said with a salute. They all laughed at her antics.
Morgan made her way into the elevator for her normal ‘let’s see if I can get in trouble’ act everytime she went to the compound. But something caught her eye this time, a button that she could’ve sworn wasn’t there before. Well, she was here to get in trouble so she pressed it. The elevator slowly made its way down to the mystery floor. FRIDAY hadn’t said anything yet and she knew that if what she was doing would hurt her FRIDAY would say so. FRIDAY didn’t really talk anymore. She only spoke when spoken to, and even then she would answer in as few words as possible. It was pretty bad at first. She got a bit better over the years though. She would only talk to Pepper and Morgan in the same way as before, especially Morgan.
“Okay.” He said quietly. “If Tony was her that would be a very different answer. But I still don’t want you to do this.” He said.
“Anthony Edward Stark.” He said in loud clear voice. He watched as every jaw dropped expect for Widow's who just tapped her screen.
He jerked away from him with a force that surprised both of them, and then, Tony ran. He had no clue where he was or where he was going, just that he needed to get away. Then, Tony saw him, Obie. He ran straight to him, the only way he could think of to be safe.
“Sir, you are lonely.” JARVIS said. Tony snorted. “It’s in human nature to want human contact.” Tony simply nodded, knowing that JARVIS would understand the action.
“Thank you.” He said lying back down. “Damn, I forgot how painfully those things are.”  He said with a small chuckle.
“I don’t know like like five maybe six people inside.” Steve said with a shrug. Tony’s eyes widened. Steve saw the fear within them. “How many people have you met in your life?” Steve asked.
“We love you Tony.” She said. “All of us.” He smiled. She helped him prop himself up  with a bunch of pillows so he could stay sitting up. “I'm going to text the guys to tell them you’re up.”
“Oh Tony.” Steve said. “Do you have any idea how unhealthy that is?” He asked.
“We need to talk. I understand that you got a call for Morgan this morning.” Steve said. Bruce froze.
“It searches through the internet and anything with the tag, ‘Captain America’ or ‘Steve Rogers’. But I have some blockers on because the internet is a weird place and there are somethings you don’t want to see. You could always unblock, because maybe you do want to see those things. I don’t know. Turn it on.” She said. Steve had slight blush on his ears, but he turned it on anyway. There were a few words that scrolled across the screen. It read ‘Meet me in my room and I’ll explain it to you how it really works.’ He looked up her and smiled.
“I know. I know. It’s just that I lost one Stark and I shouldn’t have to lose another. It isn’t fair.” He said.
“You can do that!?” She exclaimed. She shook her head. “No time come on!” She yelled as she pulled him to the lab. She set up Tony's laptop. “Okay, do your thing.” She said. Rhodey rolled his eyes. He knew how important this was, he had just never seen Pepper so frantic. She was always so calm and orderly is was strange to see her like this. Not that it was bad just interesting. Tony had that effect on people.
“Alright, well where is he?” Steve asked sitting across from her. She went from screen to screen and scrolled a little here and there as well as typing things a few times. Clint shivered when he saw the smile on her face. It was a knowing, yet somewhat evil smile that looked
“What are you saying, Morgan?”
“She hung up on me!” Pepper yelled.
“What did you get him?” Tony asked.
“Well, I’ll should you to your room.” Tony said. Morgan smiled.
“Yes, sir. You are alright, I would advise you do not strain yourself, much more.” He replied Tony nodded.
Morgan had a hologram projecting from her wrist. The metal one obviously. She was coding her little heart out. She had to finish it for the next day. She shook her head and scraped a page and started over. It wasn’t the ideal way to work especially because she was working with one hand. But it was Morgan
“Hey, Uncle Clint.” She said with a smile.
It didn't take long for the group to find out, not they were trying to keep it a secret but it was surprising how fast they found out. Luckily, they were all cool with it.
"Of course."
“Avengers tower.” She replied.

“I… Don’t want to say.” She replied after a pause. “I don’t want to alter the future.” The words barely exited their mouth before her phone rang. She picked it out of the pocket of the suit. It was Pepper, her mom. She sort of paled. "I get surprisingly good service here, considering it's the past. Hello?" She said as she answered.
“Goodbye, Platypus.” Tony said through clenched teeth. He hung up without another word. Not even waiting for a response. There was silence for a moment.
“Okay, I’ll try my best.” That narrowed it down to talking about technology, science, Star Trek, Star Wars, both romcoms and sitcoms. Great selection, Tony. He figured he had been in the bathroom too long for just washing his hands, and walked out, placing a small smile on his face as he greeted everyone again. He was outside, just think of happy things, he could do now that Obie was out of the picture.
“I'm going.” He said with a tone that told Pepper he'd be going no matter what they said. She sighed.
“I'll be there in a minute. Just, I'll be there soon.” Tony said in shock.
“We have ways to be contacted if you have a request.” The Captain replied.
“What? Hey! Let go of me!” He yelled.
“Right away, sir. This is Steven Grant Rogers, he owns a small art gallery in Brooklyn. He has no arrests and no run ins with the law. This would be a first time offence.” JARVIS replied. The man’s - Steven’s - eyes widened.
“Thank you so much JARVIS.” She said and started off to the gym. Of course he was in the gym. Her Steve was always trying to get into the gym. Although now on one let him. He was too old. Now he was mostly out, exploring the world a little bit more and staying around for Morgan. She entered the gym and it looked a lot better now than it did in the future. Then again no one used it in the future, expect for Peter when he wanted to test his agility. He watched young Steve punch the bag a few times. She only saw him young a few times. Never under good circumstances. Once when she was like four and had a terrible case of Whooping cough. She was in the hospital for weeks and all of the living Avengers came. That was the first time she met most of them. The second was just after when Steve came to check on her to make sure she was doing better. And the third when the avengers came back to their house to ask Tony about time travel. The last time was the funeral.  She leaned on the door and watched him until the bag was blow off and brust.
“Explain, please.” She said.
“About 7 hours, sir.” JARVIS replied. Everyone was shocked when the aforementioned ‘JARVIS’ replied out loud. No one knew that JARVIS could be used on speaker. It stunned them all into silence. Tony rolled his eyes, seemingly annoyed at the A.I.
“Good morning, Sir. Happy 18th birthday.” JARVIS said into his ear. Tony smiled and sat up, stretching.
“Could it have something to do with the paint?” Sam asked.
“It’s my destiny, to save them” She muttered aloud to no one.
“We go through the back door.” He said.
“So were we
“Yeah.” She muttered. “What am I like in the future?” She asked. Morgan smiled relying the memory.
“You think I don’t know that?” She asked. “You think I’m stupid? I’m 15 and smarter than you.” She exclaimed. “Sorry that was hurtful but still.”
“Must have missed that.” He said. Together they walked outside and into her car where Pepper collapsed into her steering wheel.
“Sorry…” Tony murmured softly.
“Now you know that isn't true. My hair is a large mess.” Tony said, lowering his head to hide his blush. Steve walked over and stood behind him and messed with his hair a bit.
“I found it.” She replied.
“Is Mister Stane really stopping the production of weapons?”
So sorry it's a day late! But here it is! Thank you for read and I really appreciate comments! Please leave one! I take constructive criticism and more so please don't be afraid to comment!! Only one more and I hope to post my new Stony fic on Christmas day! Anyway please keep reading and leaving comments. Love you all!
“Bruce made it.” He said. She looked over to Bruce who was studying the computer.
“What happened to your english essay?” Sam asked. Morgan shrugged with a dorky ‘imma kid’ smile.
“Boys!” Natasha yelled. They looked at her. “Seems we didn’t have a choice.” Natasha guestered to Morgan walking up to him. They froze.
“That sounds like Pepper.” Tony said.
“And so many Merpeople can do it! It’s stupid and so common.”
The first part of the job went well. Steve confronted the man. Everyone was in position and it seemed to be going well. Tony stood among the crowd of people. He was surprised that so many people would be around here at night. And it was his job to get the all to safety. It was a cold January night, so it made sense for Tony to be wearing a ski mask.
“I-I’m sor-sorry.” Tony muttered looking down.
“It was no issue, really.” She said with a smile. “I knew you needed someone and Steve was a good choice.”
“I’m sure.” He said. Tony looked around, down the road and into the forest. “Man, it really is the middle of nowhere.”
He knew he could build faster than most people, which is why Obie always gave him things to build. But he didn’t like the way these people were talking about him. It seemed like they were trying to praise him, but their tones didn’t sound very much like praise. He shrugged and JARVIS spoke up.
"Alright." FRIDAY said at last. Morgan breathed a sigh of relief. She stepped out into the lab and rolled up her sleeves. It was time to get to work.
“Maria and Howard are very busy with the case and asked me to tell you. Maria is ecstatic that you are safe and Howard is happy you can go back to focusing on the company.” She said.
“You forgot your own name?” Steve asked, rubbing his wrists. Tony looked offended.
“Basically, yes. But if
“What?” He asked.
“Today in this world it is July 4th.” Morgan said. “Happy Birthday. And although it isn’t there, I thought to give you a present myself.”
"She just finished it. She must've been working on it all weekend." He said.
“I only heard the story once. It was from my dad himself. Tasha would never tell me anything about it.” Morgan said. Steve stayed silent. “He made it seem like you were the good guy. That your team was right and he was wrong.” She said.
“It’s true my dear. Okay so here goes. You’re father was a great man, he saved us all and from my stories from a few years ago you know that we didn’t always get along.” He said. She nodded.
“And even if it did,” Jan started. “We’d have to choose the exact right time to jump and if we’re even a fraction of a second off, whoever goes will not only die but rip a hole in the space time continuum. It’s too risky.” Pepper sighed. She hadn’t said a word all day. It was the tenth anniversary today. Everyone acted like it was a normal day but the energy was tense. It wasn’t good.
“I-I didn’t mean to go through your guys’s stuff, I just - well, I thought that if I just made the pot alone, that you might think that I made it only for myself. Which I didn’t! It -It
“What’s in it?” She asked. Steve shrugged and sat down.
“Tony.” Steve started. “Is it your birthday?” He asked. Tony stiffened at stared at his device, which was still in Pepper’s hands.
He hesitated, but remembered that he hadn’t been doing a good enough job with his people skills and nodded. He didn’t bother to stand up, he just crawled over and sat in the same position as before. Whenever Tony was on the floor in the lab, he would always crawl to get around. That was why a lot of his lab pants had holes in the knees. He prefered to walk, but crawling seemed to take less effort. Steve was behind him on the couch, and Tony was suddenly acutely aware that he was in a house full of strangers. They could all easily overpower him, even Bruce, who seemed to be taller than Tony by only a few inches. But all was forgotten when the T.V turned on and F.R.I.E.N.D.S started to play. Tony’s face lit up in excitement, he hadn’t watch this show in forever. He had been so busy working on prototypes for Obie that he almost never got the chance to watch T.V anymore.
“15.” Morgan replied.
“It's not the worst thing that's happened.” Tony had no idea why he was still whispering or why Steve was now too.
“It’s Captain America.” She replied. “Anyway, if you don’t believe me, he’ll show up, if not, well what did you lose?”
“I’m going back to the water.” Tony muttered and actually turned to leave but Steve grabbed his arm and turned him around. He literally pushed him into the dinning room while Tony tried to walk away but couldn’t. All while he muttered ‘No’ repeatedly.
was the one that Tony got to share it with. Steve knew that Tony was not going back, he would stay with them. He would be happy, besides, everyone liked him. He was sure Tony would be happy to stay. They would all be happy. Together.
“Hello... Everyone.” Tony muttered.
“Alright, good. Well, I gotting to get back to work. I’ll talk to you soon. Okay?” She said. Tony nodded.
“Yes Captain Rogers.” She replied.
“You are exploring the stars!” She exclaimed with interest and pride. Her mother use to say that when she asked where Auntie Tasha and Daddy were. She knew wherever they were they weren’t coming back, but she always wanted to know where they had disappeared off to. Exploring the stars, she would say.
“Straight A’s, boring and I know all this stuff.” Morgan replied before sitting up and facing her mom. “Mom, why can’t I just skip a few grades! I know everything and I am so bored in class! I want to learn more!” Pepper chuckled.
’ Obadiah clenched his teeth. Tony would not find out that he was a Stark. He would keep Tony here if it was the last thing he ever did.
“Did I say something wrong?” He asked quietly.
“Bathroom?” he asked standing up.
“This whole thing! I’m doing this for them! That’s the reason I am here! I’m not going to let them get killed now! Not after I did all that work to find you!” Tony yelled at him. Steve was quiet.
“Why would the quantum realm spit her out there?” Steve asked.
“Well, I’d rather be here but I pissed off my english teacher and she gave me an essay to write over the weekend for ‘extra credit’, that I don’t need, so I better at least start that.” She said. She wasn’t lying, her teacher had actually done that but she had finished it in the car ride to the compound. Instead she took the elevator back down to the lab. She was greeted by the bots crowding around her. “Hey guys, good morning.” She said smiling. “Ready to get back to work?”
“Morgan I can’t let you do that.” He said.
The park was bigger than Tony could have imaged. There were people in booths everywhere. They were all yelling, and it was so loud. It was pure chaos, but Tony couldn’t care less. He didn’t like the fact that there were so many people, but he felt better when Natasha put a hand on his shoulder. Tony smiled. He could do this.
“That explains why he wants to see the fireworks so much.” Sam said. The group nodded. The mystery that was Tony just became bigger.
“That was…” Tony trailed off.
"Also, could you like not mentioned this to my mom?" FRIDAY hesitated again. "Unless I'm in danger of course."
“I’ve been thinking, and talking to Bruce.” Clint said. Tony looked up confused. “You should go back. For the time being I am king and I want you to try and form an alliance with the humans.” Clint said with a smile.
“I’m saying, I’m going to try and prevent Ultron and Civil war. Therefore you’ll all be there when Thanos comes and you can save the world the first time.” She said.
“We did it.” She said. He nodded.
“No! I will never let you use me or my brain again. Ever!” Tony yelled and walked off towards the elevator. Obadiah cracked his neck.
“That would be the pizza.” Steve said getting up, and returning a few minutes later with two large boxes of pizza. He placed them on the coffee table, and everyone grabbed a slice. Tony titled his head to the side. It became a habit he developed from the lab. If something didn’t make sense Tony would tilt his head, and sometimes the different angle would help him see the issue. It sort of carried over into everything he did. He grabbed a slice like everyone else and just held it with a questioning look on his face.
“JARVIS? How am I doing?” Tony asked, looking at himself in the mirror.
“Do you want to do it?” He asked with a smile. Tony shook his head.
“Why? You didn’t cause the crash. I never met them anyway.” Tony said. “But it’s safe, right?” Steve nodded.
Steve waited, they had moved over to the side a bit, but Tony should still have been able to find them. But, he had been gone awhile now.
“I-I’ll check upstairs, you check the lab.” Pepper stuttered and made her way up the stairs. She walked along the hallway, trying not to cry. If it was ever quiet in Tony’s house, it met he wasn’t around. Why had he lied to her? What was he really doing? Why couldn’t he tell her?
“Ironman is down! I repeat Ironman is down!” Someone yelled through the comms. Every gun man was dead and the world froze. Steve was the first the react.
“Who built the original?” Morgan asked. “I know Tony didn’t build that van because it wasn’t his style. Than who did?”
“Hank, is there an issue?” Scott asked. Hank hesitated.
“I- I don’t know.” Natasha said, sounding a bit hurt.
“We’re not kidding Morgan. Stop it you could die.” Bucky said. She realized she was speaker.
“Get Tony!” Sam called.
“You’ll just have to trust me because I don’t know how to explain it.” She said. Steve walked back in with a desert. Morgan didn’t even realize he had left. He set the plate down in front of her. She looked up at him.
“Then do as I say!” Obadiah yelled back. Tony stopped for a moment.
“If you go up there by yourself, he’s just going to pull a gun on you. Your rather threatening.” She replied. “I can see at least three weapons on him, let alone the ones he has concealed. You hide a lot of things with a hat and jacket.”
“I’m going aboard!” He whispered yelled back.
“And that’s that.” She finished.
“And you said yes?!” Sam exclaimed.
“Thanks, J” Tony said quietly with a smile. He didn’t want to wake Steve up.
“They shoot repulsor beams, more powerful than a gun.” Tony let his voice trail off. He pressed the button again and they disappeared. He nodded to the girl who shrugged.
And that's the end
of SHIELD. is Hydra. That’s not true. I know for a fact that Nick Fury and Maria Hill aren’t and of course all of you.” She said. “But after that, I have no clue after that. We’re not exactly one with SHIELD.”
“Christ.” She muttered smoothing her hair back. She came to a realization. “What year is it?” She asked. Tony frowned at her.
“Where?!”
“Look, I don’t know if you’ve seen the news lately but I’ve been on it with the Avengers.” She said. He snorted.
“You’re way too far to help.” Morgan said.
“What? What is it? Is she okay?” Happy asked. FRIDAY hesitated.
“Oh, God.” Clint said.
“Steve?” He called. “Natasha?” Although it was loud for Tony, his voice was swept away by the noisy people around him. Nothing. He felt a hand on his shoulder, and jumped. He slowly turned to find a man he had never met before there.
“I was wondering, since I’m almost 18 now, and I have wanted this since I was little, I was hoping you could take me to see the fireworks?” Tony said. Obie’s face hardened almost immediately, and Tony knew he had made a mistake asking. Obie stood to his full height, towering almost an entire foot above Tony. Tony was short for his age but Obie was also tall, which didn’t make for a good combination. Tony tensed, waiting for the blow that was bound to come. He was struck with Obie’s hand which such force that it sent him to the floor, and was promptly followed by a kick to his gut. Tony wheezed trying to get air back into his lungs.
“FRI, should I introduce myself?” She asked with a giggle. “Would they understand?”
“Do you need someone to come with you?” Sam asked. Tony shook his head.
getting older, while Steve was at the height of human perfection - just look at him. They threw each other into one of the walls, both trying to get a good punch in. Tony inched his way to his room, and tried to get the chains off with the help of the door knob; but ended up just breaking the knob off the door.
“Look, I am smarter than you’ll ever be, and you don’t have the need to remember your name when you’re doing important work like mine!” Tony said, crossing his arms.
“Hey, you know my name, I believe it's time I know yours.” Steven said. Tony froze for a minute. He didn’t remember. He hadn’t heard it in forever. He started to untie Steven. “Your name?” He asked again. Tony huffed.
say anything. His hands were shaking violently.
“Dad.” Hope said, her voice rising in a warning tone.
“Stab you.” Tony finished, poking The Captain’s chest with his dagger. The Captain almost seemed impressed. Being face to face with The Captain after all this time made Tony smile. They were so close and Tony couldn’t help but noticed how attractive The Captain was. Even though they both could die at any moment.
bumping into him. It was insanely bizarre. Tony looked up at the building and tilted his head to the side again.
! This could be a matter of life and death!” Steve yelled at her. She simply shook her head.
“Hospital.” He said. She opened her mouth to say something but he held up his good hand. “I'm fine.”
“Do you think someone should have gone with him?” Bucky asked. Steve nodded.
“Alright.” He said. “But
“Yes, I remember. What do want this time?” Obie said, almost fondly. It made Tony smiled. Obie cared, which is why he kept Tony here, to keep him protected from the people who killed his parents. “New laptop, a new TV, a gaming system?” Obie asked. Tony shook his head.
“What?” Tony asked. In one swift motion, Obie pulled a gun out of his suit jacket and  shot Jarvis in the head. Dead. Tony gasp and everything seemed to go in slow motion as Jarvis fell to floor. Tears burn in Tony’s eyes. Everything was a blur but something he can remember clearly was a short conversation.
Steve watched Tony’s awestruck expression, and he couldn’t help but smile. The way the fireworks lit up his face was nothing compared to his smile. His eyes were practically shining, showing just how truly happy he was. This was his dream, and he was finally living. Steve had only known Tony for about 24 hours, but he was insanely happy that
“I’m glad you guys still like me.” He muttered.
“Yeah, sure.” Clint said.
“Come on, let's go inside.” Steve said. Tony nodded and followed Steve inside. He didn’t even bother looking up as they entered the gallery, he just followed Steve up the stairs and into what looked like a nice apartment. There were three people on a couch, one person on the floor, and one person on a chair, and Tony could feel his heart stop. Not literally of course but this was too much, he should just go home. Yeah maybe if he asked nicely he could have Steve carry him home or something.
Morgan walked up with her hands out of her pockets and had left her jacket with the Avengers. She made it look like she had nothing to hide. Which honestly, she didn’t. Unless you count her hand but she didn’t. He looked at her as she approached and tensed as she sat down. Morgan noticed his hand go toward his gun. She simply smiled at him.
“It was... Interesting. I didn't get most of it, though.” Tony admitted. It was like lunch but more natural and fun- or it was until Pepper called. Tony rolled his eyes and stood up.
“Why would he be here? This place is a tourist trap?” Bruce asked.
“What?!” Tony exclaimed. “In the middle of nowhere? What the hell is she doing there?” No one replied for a minute.
“How old are you?” Natasha asked.
“So I’ve heard.” She said.
Tony woke up as light streamed into the room. At first, he was confused; he didn’t remember leaving his shades open last night. Then, he realized that he wasn't at home. He was at Steve’s house.
“Looks cool, Tony.” Clint said trying to be supportive. Tony smiled brightly at him. It was the first time Tony had picked out his own clothes. He always wore the clothes Obie gave him, in the order he gave them to him in. ({If that makes sense, sorry author is tired…})
“I’m sorry, sir, but Mister Stane won’t be back for three days. He didn’t have any interviews scheduled for this week.” She said. Steve frowned himself, of course there was no interview. This was just an act to keep her distracted for a little while.
____________
“I don't care you need to rest!” Pepper augured.
“Thank you, Tony. Most of us drink coffee. Bruce is the only one of us who doesn’t.” Steve said.
“Tony, do you know how dangerous this could be?” Clint said.
“I'm Bruce Banner we are starting a new project today so you haven't missed anything yet.” Bruce stated. “If you slept in class you wouldn't have missed anything, this class is such a waste of time.”Bruce muttered. Tony snorted as he sat down.
“Hi. My name is Morgan.” She said. He didn’t reply. He just looked at her. She waited a second before continuing. “I know who you are.” He tensed even more. “But I’m not afraid of you.” He looked confused.
“What?” Steve asked.
come home after we active the portal.” Hank replied.
“Brucie-bear, you worry too much, I’ll be careful, and if worse comes to worse I’ll just turn human.” Tony shrugged.
“It has been killing me, more than the bullet.” Tony breathed. There was a knock on the door.
Tony struggled desperately against the chains that Obadiah had put him in. His protests were muffled by the gag tied around his mouth, as the chains dug into his wrists, causing them bleed. Tony wasn’t nearly as strong as Obadiah,
“Sir, you brother requests your- who’s this?” A redhead girl asked coming out of the office and ballroom hallway.
“JARVIS hasn’t even broken through SHIELDs files yet.” He said. She shrugged.
“Is- Is this some practical Joke? Or like punishment for- for blow up the van?” She asked, barely realizing she was shaking. “Because if it is. That’s just cruel!”
“Your secret is sort of safe with me. It safer with me than Clint.” She said.
“Don't talk like that Tony.” Rhodey said. “I got to go, talk to you later. You'll be fine.”
“I'll drive you. Bucky, I'll pay you back tomorrow.” Steve said. But he noted in the two walked out of the diner.
Slicene.
“How did you know exactly where they were?” Bruce asked.
the rest of the day was completely uneventful, although it was a decent day, he was happy to be home. As soon as he closed the door, his phone rang. It was Rhodey.
“Of course, Sir. For you, that would take only 12 hours 45 minutes and 56 seconds.” JARVIS replied. Tony smiled and looked expectantly at Bucky.
"Yes Morgan."
“Thanks Bucky.” Steve said, sitting down next to Tony. Tony giggled under his breath.
“N-No!” He stuttered.
“Yep shipwreck for weeks and definitely has a place to stay.” Tony slapped his hand over his mouth. “S-sorry. I- I just am always sarcastic and I didn't mean for if too sound mean! I'm sorry!” Tony apologized. Steve laughed.
Morgan did eat her waffles, that was one of the few differences between her and her dad. She knew how to eat while she worked. (Unless she wasn't hungry when she started and was deep into whatever she was doing) She knew her father loved to fix up old cars, god knows he could afford it. So fixing the car part of the van would be in her blood. She used his old tools and tried her best to be careful but accidentally had a runaway power drill try to dig into her hand. Poor power drill hand to be thrown out. T’Challa (Shuri actually) had given her a vibranium hand for her ninth birthday as long as they promised to never give it away. For her tenth birthday Pepper had the first arc reactor along with the words “Proof That Tony Stark Has A Heart” carved into it in italian. (Which she was fluent in thank you very much.) She had used the cloaking device thing that S.H.I.E.L.D had and mixed it with her own stuff and was able to make it look normal. She only did that when she was at school though. She learned fast enough that if she didn't at least keep it covered or else the other kids got distracted by it. No almost no one, at her school, knows, or remembers, that her left hand isn't real. She turned off the nerves in that hand a while ago after she realized that her hand was over sensitive. Now she basically used her hand as shield when she worked. The van was fixing up nicely but it was rusted here and there and the paint was faded. They always did say she was her father's daughter. Morgan decided she would paint it before she finished the last wire that would turn the damn thing on. Luckily, since it was Tony Stark's workshop, she able to find paint cans.
“Pepper, I need you to calm down. I know how hard this is but Tony would want you to be calm. Okay?” Rhodey said placing a hand on one of her shoulders. She nodded.
“Yeah, did me a few favors. I had owed him.”
“Before it’s too late!” Bruce added.
“First time doing this sort of thing?” The Captain asked. Tony shrugged.
“You have an A.I system?” The man asked.
“You mean I should go for it?” He asked.
“I'm here.” Came the weak voice from Tony.
“Good.” She replied. There was a moment of a comfortable silence between the two. “So.” She said.
“I’m the Stark heir.” Tony mumbled, still unsure of it. Obie rolled his eyes.
“Okay,” He said. “What does this thing really do then?” He asked. She smiled and held her hand out and he placed it into her hand. She pressed a few buttons and moved the parts around and gave it back to him. He looked at the little red dot and the coordinates, along with a country and it moved. “What is it?” He asked.
“What?! Why? He can’t- shouldn’t- didn’t do anything!” He exclaimed.
“So how’d your mission go?” She asked.
“Hey kid.” Clint called from the couch. Steve, Sam and Bucky were all there too.
“Alright. I guess we have a plan.” Bruce agreed. Tony smile could light up the water.
“What? No, I was at the football game, what happened at the house?!” He asked.
Morgan was sucked into the back of the van and into the unknown.
“Of course you’d ask that.” She said. “You guys are doing considerably better than you were doing ten years ago.”
“No?” Obie asked raising an eyebrow.
“Why not just plug it into the wall?” Tony asked leaning back.
” Steve asked, looking towards Tony.
“Thanks JARVIS.” He sighed. “Do you have any advice?”
“What? You haven't heard? I thought you were in the house.” She said.
“Wait I am super mad at you!” She said. He laughed lightly. (Morgan was one of the only people, these days that could still make him laugh.)
“Anyone hear from Morgan today?” He asked. She hesitated.
“Name your price, I’ll match it.” Tony said. The Captain opened his mouth before he could speak the doors burst open again. A redhead that had the same imposing feel to her as Pepper did came in. Those two girl could be best friends. She reminded him of why he was here. So one else got hurt. So people would be safe.
“How are those, SHIELD files coming along?” She asked, instead of answering.
It was going to be a huge job and of course it was going to take a little while to prepare for it. Get someone in close. Steve had never lost a man yet and he was not about to start now. He was careful with his planning. Steve had also been right that he was spending a lot of time with Bruce. He was surprised at how smart Bruce was and the rest of the team was starting to warm up to him. It was nice to be able to call people besides Pepper and Rhodey friends. Steve hung around the lab more and more. Which was a problem because Tony was noticing how hot he was more and more. But he could not get distracted and even if he wasn’t plotting to kill his uncle, he was sure that Steve was straight or not interested in Tony. He was working on a new weapon that may be the key to taking down Obadiah. Bruce was helping and proving to be very useful. Then his phone rang. It was Pepper. Pepper. He was so screwed. If he didn't pick up she’d go nuts or worse over to his house. If he did pick up, Obadiah would be able to hear every little thing they said.
“If that’s okay.” Tony added quickly. The man raised an eyebrow at Steve and shook his head.
“Who's Ty?” Bucky asked, cracking his knuckles. He wanted to protect Tony as much as pepper and Rhodey did. It made Tony smile brighten a bit more. Pepper and Rhodey looks to Tony.
“Yep. See it's simple, just have to have the right teacher.” Tony said.
“Are you telling us that you time traveled?” He asked her.
“No, I’m just surprised. You must not get many visitors up here.” Steve said. Tony shook his head. “Should we go?” Tony shook his head again.
“You’ll be fine.” He said.
“You don’t have to do that you know. You can walk next to me.” Steve said. Tony tilted his head again, but shook it and kept walking behind him. Steve sighed. What had this poor kid been through in that tower? They walked into the living room where everyone sat patiently. The scary man was still there,
“I don’t know, last time I tried without Tony I turned Scott into a baby.” Bruce said. “I didn’t get to fully analyze what he did.” They all sat in silence.
“No nothing like that it’s just- Morgan actually.” He said.
“Wow you must've really been on that raft for awhile.” Steve said. Tony nodded.
“Then tell me...why are you here, truthfully or I will destroy your camera and burn it along with your sketchbook and your papers.” Tony said, giving him a warning shake of his wrench. Steven seemed to panic, which made Tony relax a bit. He had him.
“Because,” She said. “My Avengers went the past before.” Everyone’s, save Natasha who looked shocked which she counted as a win, jaw dropped.
“Sorry guys, I have to take this.” Tony said. Then walked over to the side for privacy. “What's up Pep?”
“Steve we have to- Who the hell is this?” A man sitting at the table with a bunch of papers around him said. Tony immediately flushed.
After a nice conversation on how bad high school was and the two of them almost blowing up the entire lab, Tony had a place to sit at lunch at a new friend. Tony didn't speak to anyone else until lunch. Not that he didn't want to but yeah because you didn't want to. he walked through the cafeteria trying to find Bruce. What he didn't expect to see was a group of insanely different people sitting with him. One of which was super hot. He was so not ready for so many people, maybe he could sneak out and eat lunch alone outside and maybe call Pepper or Rhodey. But he was too late. Bruce saw him and ran over to where Tony stood.
Gunshot.
“But here’s the thing Morgan… I loved him.” Steve said. Morgan nodded.
“Well, the same I think. You once threatened to break a man’s fingers. You were babysitting me and he was poparazzi and I screamed for you and trouble ensued. My dad was pissed at you for a week but he got over it.” She said.
It wasn’t long before everything else was starting to wake up. First Bruce, who sat down next to Pepper, then Clint and Natasha walked in, and then Bucky and Sam. They all seemed tired out of their minds. Tony knew the caffeine would help wake them all up.
“Tony! What the hell is wrong with you?!” Pepper exclaimed through the phone.
“You went through the tower, didn’t you?” Tony asked without looking up. She shrugged again.
“Fine. Just, don’t get them involved...” He said. Steve heard every last word and he wasn’t about to let Tony sacrifice himself for him. He wouldn’t let him hurt any more. So instead, he burst through the door and ran over to them.
“You did great. You’re getting better at these things.” Obie said taking the weapon from Tony. Tony nodded.
The elevator dinged, and the two of them faced the doors as they parted to reveal Howard and Maria Stark. Steve could see the family resemblance, it was almost uncanny how much Tony looked like them. Almost a perfect combination of the two. Tony smiled nervously, and Maria slowly walked over. She took his face in her hands and looked at him. After a moment, she smiled and laughed with tears in her eyes. The two embraced and Howard soon joined his wife. Steve stood off to the side, smiling. He was so happy for Tony. He was free, and with his family. Maria looked at Steve and smiled. Steve simply nodded, but she pulled him into the hug as well.
“would tomorrow work for you? Because I have this huge math test and if I fail, I can't play and these idiots will lose without me.” Steve said. Tony nodded.
“Surprise!” They yelled. Morgan swears on her life that Steve was about ready to kill all of them. Luckily he realized what happened and softened into a nice smile.
“I know it was obvious but I’m trying to say it you won’t be able to get on alone. You need to not only access his house but his lab and company. First company to cause a distraction that would make Hank go there and when there you’ll need his phone to be able to get into his lab. But first you have to get into his house and grab a key which you will also need. It’s complex and there is no way to do it alone.” He said.
“I have nothing to show you. But us, or Hydra and I don’t know if I can let you be taken by them. I know what they did to you and I don’t want you to go through that again.” She said, meeting his eyes. He could tell she wasn’t lying. He knew how to tell if people were, it was something he was trained in. This little girl wasn’t. He looked down before nodding.
“I hope he was useful.” Tony said. She smiled wider.
“Well you mean the world to me!” Steve yelled. At him. Tony didn't not know what to say. “Well- that’s not- I mean-” Steve stuttered trying to recover from that. Tony grabbed Steve by his shirt, pulled him close and kissed him.
“Tony, I will love you no matter what. I don't care what you are!” Steve yelled. Slowly Tony swam closer and Steve saw what he was hiding.
“Well, yes, but that’s not why I know that. I was there, he had taught me my first swear word that day.” She said. A few of them stifled a laugh. Morgan stood up. “I’m sorry for startling you guys, but I really need to get home. My mom is going to kill me.” Tony smiled faintly at that.
“What about Tony. He’s short and non-threatening.” Clint suggested.
“Shut up!” Obadiah told Tony.
“JARVIS?” Tony asked, looking up to the ceiling.
“She’s in the past.” Clint answered for her. Pepper nodded.
“Oh my god.” Tony gasped as he stared down at the man he just knocked out. This man was definitely an intruder, and Tony just knocked him out,
“How’s school kid.” Bucky asked. She groaned.
“Morgan who? And why are you covered in paint?” Bruce Banner asked. Bruce Banner. Not Hulk Banner or Professor Hulk or whatever he called himself now. Bruce Banner.
“The crash wasn’t an accident, you cut the breaks…” Tony let his voice trail off. He was shocked. The man who had been like a father to him was dead on the floor and the man who saved him from his actually father had just murder one of the most important people in his life. Tony didn’t know what to do.
“Well for starters, don’t provoke terrorists” She said. “It ends very poorly.” A few people gave him a disapproving and shocked look. Her phone rang a second later, before anyone could ask any questions. “It’s Pepper. Future Pepper. She wants to video call.” Morgan shrugged and pressed answer. “Hey Pepper.” She said with a small smile.
“Steve, you should go, we’ll handle things down here.” She said.
“But it’s about Morgan.” FRIDAY said.
“What do you got there?” Tony asked, eyeing her little scrap machine. She waved a hand at him.
“Excuse me, Captain Rogers?” FRIDAY interrupted. Steve waved her off.
“Where is he then?” Tony asked looking around. Morgan shrugged.
Tony let go of Steve's arm as they came to the dining room doors. He took a breath. Steve smiled and opened the door.
“New comms, It’s hack proof, JARVIS is inside
“I-I’ll to back to work in a minute.” Tony muttered, wiping his face.
“Yeah, I get cold really easily.” She said. Clint shrugged and went off to finish some more decorating.
for comfort, and for the best sleep, but to Tony, this was the most comfortable bed he ever slept in. He didn’t fall asleep though, he wanted to wait until Steve came to bed, just in case. The door opened and Steve crept in quietly. Tony was surprised that such a large man could walk so quietly. As soon as Steve was in bed, Tony closed his eyes. Sleep had never come so easily to him before.
“That’s a lot to handle.” Clint said sitting down, looking lost. She sighed.
Holy Chipotle! We're almost done here! I'm planning like one maybe two more chapter plus an epilogue
“Alright.”
“Oh, Tony. I am so sorry.” Steve said. Tony turned to him, his head still tilted.
“Fine. I'll talk to him.” Tony said as he took out his phone.
His hands started to shake and he stumbled to grab another one of his inventions to see if it matched. He grabbed an old circuit board and tried the same thing. It matched. The same symbol. He wasn’t… he couldn’t possibly… Obie wouldn’t have… No. It had to be true. He was the missing Stark heir. Shocked, Tony stumbled and knocked into a few things.
“How far away are they?” He asked.
“O-okay.” Tony said. He needed to see those fireworks. It was his dream.
much like Natasha’s
(See the end of the chapter for
“You right…” He muttered, letting his voice trail off.
“Look, kid. Even if you could build that. I doubt I’d have the money to pay for it.” Tony frowned at that statement, of course he
“They mean the world to me.” He said.
“What was that?” He asked.
“Nice to hear from you too, Pepper.” Tony replied, smiling at the familiar banter he missed. Tony was too afraid to talk to Rhodey or Pepper often so they almost never talked.
“Deal.”
Posted it by accident without finishing it. Fixed it though. Fun times.
“Don’t say that Uncle Steve!” Morgan whined. Steve simply laughed again. She was good at that. Making him laugh that is. She truly was Tony’s daughter.
“Morgan, I don’t care. I love you like a daughter.” He said.
“You would’ve denied me.”
“What are you doing?” Steve asked.
“Yeah, sure why not?” Tony asked. High school sucked and it probably sucked more if you weren't a genius.
“What do you mean for now?” Hope asked. Bucky shrugged.
“It was a myth. Antman, in the war. A man as small as an ant and helped the war. Now in the beginnings of SHIELD they tried to not only steal it but replicate it. Hank Pym got mad and tried his hardest to keep it out of SHIELD’s hands. It’s under such high security and so many puzzles with a few different locations that need to be… broken into.” She said.
“It’s Steve, and I hoped to use your real name, otherwise I’ll start referring to you with a different name.” Steven - Steve - said. Tony heistated. Then it came to him.
“that's all right, neither does Bruce, you can sit on the bleachers with him and Natasha, she'll tell you when to cheer.” Steve said. Tony smiled.
“No, are just so much nicer than me and my brother’s nicknames for each other.” Tony said trying not to laugh.
Tony swam as fast as he could towards the ship. It was a ship! A ship! That meant people. Humans! He couldn't wait. Humans were the most interesting creatures in the whole world. How could his father not like them. The ship was so big. It probably held at least 50 humans.
“Uh, boys?”
“No, not really, I just had a hard decision to make over the phone earlier and I don’t think I could sleep.” She said. Natasha sat down next to her and faced her. Morgan turned as well.
“It takes two to start a war. It was either of your faults. It was your emotions and your morals. It’s okay though, because I’m going to fix it.” She said distantly. Steve wasn’t sure if she was still talking to him anymore or if she was talking to herself.
“Nat?” Tony asked. His voice was horse and his throat, and by default his mouth, was dry. God what he’d give for a glass of water. She perked up and looked at him with an almost shocked expression that most definitely didn’t belong on her face.
“Yeah, one of them was. I got to sort of say goodbye to that one. Not the other though.” She said. She turned to the small clearing behind her. “You know, this used to be my home. My - dad built it for my mom and I.” A pause. “It was a paradise in a world- a- a universe in turmoil. Absolute chaos.”
“He has a free right now” there was a silence for a moment. “Hello, Rhodey?”
“Do they work?” Asked a quiet brunette. Tony nodded.
will only work with each other.” Tony replied with a smile.
Tony is the prince Merman and Clint is his older brother who dad likes best
“Morgan. I mean I loved him.”
I love you munchkin.
“Go see him Tony you might be surprised.” Clint said. Tony gave him a weak smile and nodded.
“All right, call me platypus and I'll get them.” Rhodey said.
Morgan walked down to the common room as she was fiddling with a device she was making. She didn’t even notice the Avengers staring at her until Clint cleared his throat.
Another early chapter, ish. I have to travel all day tomorrow which means no time to post so here I am. Rip. Anywho here y'all go.
“No, not really anyway. I'm pretty sure I'm clean but like I've been wasted before. Anyway, what I meant was considering who my target is shouldn't it be best not to show you who I am?” Tony rambled. He realized he should've stopped talk and tried to stop the flush of his face. The Captain seemed to smile a little.
“Natasha will be there too.” Tony looked at her, and she gave him a gentle smile and nodded.
“Tony!” Steve called and ran into the water. He got about waste deep before he realized Tony wasn’t coming closer. “What’s wrong?” He called. Tony scrunched up his face as he looked down.
“I love you Morgan. I’ll talk to you later.” Bruce said.
“You-You love me?” Tony asked, tilting his head again. Steve smiled at him and nodded.
“I can even understand high school homework, let alone college level.” Steve huffed.
“They’re fine.” Steve said and crossed his arms. “What the hell, you got shot because you dove in front of civilians! You could’ve died!”
Tony thinks Steve is cute.
“You don’t understand, we need to get up,
“Of course.” Steve said. Tony had seen enough romcoms to know what to do next. He pressed his lips to Steve’s, and everything exploded. He had never felt this kind of warmth before. He loved it.
“Sort of.” He said.
“The f- really? He was?” Tony asked. The Captain nodded.
“First of all, Mom owns the company that makes the newest tech” She said holding up one finger. “And second of all I really want this!” She cried and flopped backwards. Steve nodded with a snort.
________
“Avengers. Tower.” Clint said.
“Morgan, If you want to give me a happy birthday you’ll fix this and come home to me.” Steve said.
“I’m sorry Captain Rogers but unlike boss she didn’t use the holograms or speak to me. I do not know what she did exactly. She also took the last quantumsuit.” FRIDAY replied. They stood in silence again.
“No, not at all. It’s a shame you guys didn’t get together but hey works out for me.” She said. He laughed again. Steve ruffled her hair.
________
“Ms. Romanov you wound me.” He said. Natasha held a hint of a smile. Morgan caught it. “But yeah, if I was the one to crack it, why didn’t you tell them to call me? Why didn’t they call me?” Morgan panicked. Natasha and Tony were gone, two of the most important people to her were dead and now they were standing right in front of her. How could she lie to them. Natasha tough her russian and Tony was her father. They both gave everything so she could have a future.
“No, why?” Steve asked. She breathed a sigh of relief.
“He’s always short.” Clint muttered.
Natasha after all.
“Isn’t that a large leap from that.” Bruce said. She shook her head.
“Right.” Bucky muttered. She walked towards the elevator and pressed the button before turning to them.
“Possibly.” Was his replied. He didn't care if it was his first time or not. He got through didn't he.
“You suck.” Tony said getting into the car. The ride was short but to Tony it took a lifetime. “Pepper, I can't do this. I don't want to! High school is way too big for me! I won't go!” He said firmly Pepper's face softened.
“You said you spoke to him on the phone. Right? We can probably track him.” Rhodey said. Pepper's face lit up and she wiped the tears from her face.
“Pepper!” Rhodey yelled. “He isn't here.” She walked down the stairs.
“About a week. They put you into a coma to make sure everything was okay, then let you come out of it on your own. Just to be sure there was no complications. You were taken off the coma about two days ago. The boys missed a football game to see if you would wake up.” She said.
“Then why not get him? He built it once he can do it again.” Morgan said.
Tony cried. He hadn’t done that in front of Obie since he was little. But he didn’t care, he was too upset. He thought he was cared for. He was wrong. He should’ve know. Obie was picking the flowers out of his hair as he cried on the bed.
“You never did answer me.” Steve said a few weeks later as they sat under a tree during their free. It became a thing, they'd meet there and just be in each other's company.
“Again? I got you that for the past 6 years! Wouldn’t you want something else this year? Like the newest tech?” He asked. She shook her head.
“So boring! Mom says I can’t skip a grade no matter what! My teachers hate me and I have like two friends.” She said then her waffles dinged. She instantly brightened. “Ooh! My waffles!
“If I don't go they'll think something is wrong.” He said.
“Please, just Steve.” Steve said smiling. Tony smiled back before hitting himself in the face.
“I lost my parents a few years ago.” He said. Tony covered his mouth.
“I know I know!” Tony whined. “It’s just there is this really cute guy, and he’s letting me stay with him and- and I really like him!” Clint sighed. “Maybe- maybe if he likes me back we can create a bond between merpeople and humans. That way we can stop worrying about getting caught!”
“Don’t move or I’ll-”
“I’ll handle it.” She said with a knowing smile. He raised an eyebrow at her but shook his head and was off. Morgan scrolled through her phone and remember the number from heart, from the stories she heard. Time to freak a grown man out.
“Yes, Morgan?” FRIDAY asked. It took a some re-coding and a lot of begging but FRIDAY finally called Morgan by her name instead of ‘Boss.’
“They hate you Tony. It’s all an act, for this!” Obie said showing Tony that he had Steve’s bag.
“T-Tony.” He stuttered.
“He’s gone rouge.”
“It was all right. I have what seems to be your friend group, they love your school's team and by default, you.” Tony snickered.
“Well, I could but I don’t know what made up the back. I can remember the wiring and the van part but I didn’t build the inside of it.” She explained.
“Why would you have to pay for it? I’m offering to build it, and I
“He’s clear. In fact he seems to have kept the Howard fund we have.” She said.
“Do you know where she is?” He asked. She could get into huge trouble if she was out there alone. She had been seen with the Avengers far too many times. She could be hurt.
like that everyone’s eyes were on him.
“Tony!” She yelled. Morgan didn’t think. She just ran. She
“Could you make the glass so I can see them but they can’t see me?” She asked. He didn’t say anything for a minute but he did tune the glass up. She smiled. “Thanks JARVIS, you’re the best!”
know.” Bucky replied.
“Jarvis? Would you mind coming with me? I’m going to talk to Obie about taking over the company.” Tony asked as he finished putting on his shoes.
“We’ll have to tell the others.”
“I’m turning 18 soon.” Tony replied..
“Yeah, he is isn’t he.” Tony replied. Morgan raised an eyebrow at his slight blush.
“Yep.”
“So you really are…” Pepper muttered. Tony raised an eyebrow at her. “Hello Mister Stark, will that be all?” She said. Showing him that it was really her. He smiled at her.
“Don’t you dared touch them! They’re innocent, and they don’t deserve to be used in such a way! You asshole!” Tony said.
“They told me you’re the guy to see.”
“That good for nothing secretary of mine... I’m sorry, she told me that-” Steve was interrupted by the doors swinging open, and dozens upon dozens of reporters came flying in. Steve’s plan was working. They shoved him out of the way and ran straight up to the receptionist’s desk, yelling out a million different questions. Steve smirked.
I love you too Aunt Tasha
“Rhodey, Rhodey, Rhodey..” Tony said until rodi turns attention to Tony. “I- I think I'm getting overwhelmed.” everyone saw a Rhodey get scared. He actually picked Tony up and sat on the hood of his car.
“They took him, we can trust them. He does so do I.” Pepper said. Natasha smiled.
“Yeah, why not?” He asked. She shrugged.
“Love you too.” With that, they both hung up.
“2013.” He replied. Her eyes widened and she paled, trying her best not to faint.
“I know I couldn’t. When I lost Janet I couldn’t bare the thought of losing Hope too. We’ll come with you.” Hank said.
“What
“What? I live alone in a tower, not in the 1940s.” He said. It earned him a few laughs and he was oddly proud of himself. They were barely halfway through an episode when there was a knock at the downstairs door.
"Still can't think of anything to call me?" He asked.
“With the Avengers.” Morgan replied. She saw Pepper pale.
“What?!” He exclaimed. She shrugged.
She heard a noise.
“What?” Tony replied.
“Well- uh.” Tony stammered. Bruce crossed his arms.
“No.” He said, exasperated. “I meant with nerve sensors, and please not a poisonous metal this time.”
“I’m sorry I ran. JARVIS told me that I should...so I did.” He said quietly. Natasha raised an eyebrow. Tony tapped his earpiece.
“So, Tony did you like the game?” Steve asked as everyone sat down at one of the round tables.
“The suit I can in wearing is the only thing that can transport me back, I need to wear it and it will transport me back to the portal back home.” She said. “But it only had enough power for one trip, and not a round trip.”
“You speak Italian?” Tony asked. She nodded.
“What do you mean?” Steve asked.
It took about an hour for the entire inner circle of The Captain to get there. One of them (Barton) was a guy Tony had knocked out and was glaring at him the entire hour, since he was already there. There were six of them. One of the guys, with a metal arm, sized Tony up.
“But if you’re right, don’t you think he deserves to know?” She said. “You think he’ll be calm if you don’t tell him? If he finds out you’re hiding things from him.” Steve was quiet there was a silence before she spoke again. “Aren’t you and Tony close now?” Steve nodded. “Then isn’t he your best friend in this time?” She asked.
“What’s wrong? What happened with Morgan?” Rhodey asked already rushing up to Pepper, holding her close.
“I know, and I am so happy that you care about me but I want this.” She said. “And besides if this happens you won’t even remember me.” She said hoping for a hint of humor. It didn’t work though.
“JARVIS?” He asked. “Where’s Morgan?” He figured it out. She wasn’t there. She didn’t come bouncing in wearing a stolen shirt, even though Tony bought her, her own clothes.
“No allergies, I guess. Where is the bathroom?” Tony asked. Steve pointed down the hall.
“I don’t see anything wrong with it.” Bucky said taking a bite of his sandwich.
The hospital kept him overnight just to be sure but he was released a little late and had Rhodey take him in because Pepper had class. He wore a black collared, long sleeve shirt as to cover his brace and neck. Rhodey had written a fake doctor's note to let Tony where his sunglasses inside during school. All in all it worked pretty well, until lunch. Tony quietly eat his sandwich pretending he didn't notice everyone staring at him.
(not)
“They should.” She replied. “They might listen to you then.” Morgan nodded and decided to leave FRIDAY alone for now. She knelt down to the robots level.
“You found me.” She said her voice slightly cracking. They noticed the tears in her eyes.
“Yeah, I know how brothers are, I have one back home. I lost my mother as well, shark attack.” Tony said. Steve nodded. They both stood that for a minute.
Cars.
“Yeah dude, it's all right. We were worried about you. As long as you are good.” Clint said. And may Tony happy that they cared about him even though I've only known him for a week or two.
“What do you guys call each other?” Steve asked looking amused.
“If that happens, Morgan, you may never be born. You could just die.” Bruce said. “You can’t do that, that’s the consequence you can’t handle.” He said.
“What about Natasha?” She hissed, making sure they could hear her over the phone but Tony could not.
“She said Avengers tower but I doubt it’s true.” Pepper replied.
“Come with me please. He’s going to fine.” She said ushering them towards a car.
________
“She’s fine. That much we
to forget you.” She snorted.
“Prince Rogers.” He said but ended up stumbling over again. And yet again Prince Rogers was there to save him from falling.
_____________
“Before my large mental break down,” Tony started calmly which made the British girl snort. “I was able to convince Obadiah to not cancel any of Maria’s or Howard’s I guess. It wasn’t right that just because they were dead that their charities that so many people depend wouldn’t be able to live. It makes no sense. And like I said before, money is not an object.” Tony said as if it was obvious. Which it wasn’t. The group shared a look. Tony started to feel uncomfortable. It was like they were talking to each other.
“What’s going on here? Why did all of this happen?” Rhodey asked. Pepper placed a hand on his shoulder.
“Couldn’t you just build the time machine?” Clint asked.
The police found them sitting together, Steve running his fingers through Tony’s hair, calming him.
“Sounds like me.” Natasha said. Morgan nodded.
“Okay, so Scott, Hope, Hank and Jan made a new portal and they just finished it.” Peter said.
“My boy! You said you have news, what’s up?” Obie asked, clapping his hands together. Tony nodded and held up his prototype like a child held a toy up.
“Are? As in plural?” Clint asked. Tony smirked back in reply. Morgan shook her head fondly and sighed. Handing Steve hers. He looked at her questioningly. She simply gave him a dorky smile.
“I love this show.” He commented with a smile still on his face. That had most of them sending puzzled looks towards him.
“O-on Coffee?” He replied, timidly, almost if asking if that was the right answer.
seen it.” Tony countered. Clint rolled his eyes and pouted slightly. Tony smiled a bit, he had just sort of won his first argument.
“Yeah, they like me.” Tony teased.
“With Scott and Hope.” Clint replied. She sighed.
“Just pick a time, I have absolutely nothing better to do. And don't take that as a compliment. It is just I'm new here and have no social life.” Tony said. Not that he had much of one before. People couldn't handle him. He didn't blame them. He was a handful.
“Get into contact with them. They’re probably the only ones that know how to make it work for real. Otherwise I’m stuck here.” She said. They nodded, before Clint grabbed the phone again.
“Thank you, for last night.” He said. She smiled.
Morgan woke up and her head was killing her. She moved her hand, the real one not the metal one, to her forehead and groaned. She cracked her eye opened ever so slightly to see Clint standing over her before closing it again a second later.
“How are you
“Are you familiar with the fireworks that will be set off tomorrow?” Tony asked. He could do this. He could
“Thanks, I am so going to pass that test. You should come to the game.” Steve said. Tony shrugged.
“What do you want to be called?” She asked, looking up at him. “You’re real name, a name you know now?” Bucky thought for a moment.
“Tony!” He yelled. Tony looked surprised. Steve was shocked. How could someone get in? Tony wanted to know how he got inside too.
“And if they aren’t?” Steve asked.
“Including you? Two.” Tony said. Steve’s mouth fell open and Tony felt his cheeks flush. “W-well I’ve never left my-my tower be-before what’d-what did you ex-expect.” Tony stuttered defensively.
“Yeah, hey, I’m in town. Have you spoke to Tony lately?”
“James, but everyone calls you Bucky. Do you like it?” Morgan replied.
“Yeah, Pepper told us after Howard and Maria Stark showed up.” She said.
“Boo! Cliff hanger!” Clint called flopping onto his back.
“Morgan! Hey, I told you I was always this cool!” He exclaimed. Clint from the past just nodded and smiled proudly, til Natasa hit him in the back of the head.
“Yep, definitely.” Tony replied.
“I can’t lose both of them.” Pepper muttered. Steve softened. She lost her husband and she couldn’t bare to lose her daughter too. Her phone buzzed again and with a sigh she checked it. Steve backed off and went back to looking at the van. He had to say he was proud of her. The art of the van was great. He heard something clater and noticed Pepper now standing. Her phone on the floor, her skin paler than usual. He rushed over to her.
No one said a word. She was crying again but didn’t seem to notice nor care. She just stared out at the lake.
“We did.” He agreed. They looked over to her parents, Hank and Jan were in the middle of a whispering match. Not angry at each other but angry in general. They looked at each other then walked over.
"Yeah, and since when do you take showers in the morning." Bucky asked. She snorted.
“Where’s my stuff? Why are you doing this? Let me go!” The man demanded.
“What?” She asked noticing that everyone stopped and looked at her.
“Okay so…” Steve began.
“Steve?” He called from the waves. He was too nervous to think of anything else. Steve face lit up when he saw Tony.
“Y-yes, Sir.” Tony said. “I-I’m sorry.” Obie nodded.
“Hello.” Tony said bowing to the best of his ability. Steve pulled him back up into a standing pose.
“Bruce you’re such a tattle-tail!” She called into the phone. “No hello? No how are you? Nothing?” She asked. “I
“All right what did you do?” Rhodey asked.
"I'm calling Pepper…" Happy said.
“Well we're docking in an hour. Where are you from?” Steve asked. Tony sighed, finally getting his balance and leaning back on the rail.
“Just take your medicine and go to bed. You’ve had enough for one day.” He replied. He had Tony back,
