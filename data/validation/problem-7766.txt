“Why would you think she wouldn’t do the same?” I continue quietly. Tony gapes at me, thunderstruck by such a simple question, turning the question this way and that in his mind. This is the thing that Tony has never understood: that anyone could ever forgive him. That anyone could feel the same way about him as he does them. The only exception, as near as I can tell, has been Maria Stark.
"Donnie trusts me," Tony cuts in. "And I'm the only one who can help him with the neural system."
EDITED: One of Steve's lines because it was really jack-assy in a way I didn't like. Other than that this chapter is unchanged.
Tony walks next to Rhodey in the pool as they test out the water-proofing on his prosthetic. There are pieces of ice floating on the surface, spiraling from the corner where Donald sits, creating ice floes that Spider-Man is leap-frogging around on. Peter slips for the third time and Donald seems afraid of his own laughter.
Jesus, he hopes she's alright.
"Intergalactic, huh? Pretty fancy name for a tin can."
"Always," Bucky agrees, and the line goes dead.
"I just." Peter wipes furiously at his eyes, over and over, until he can trust his voice again. "I just don't know what else I could've done. He had to go to jail, he had to. But that should've been it, you know? He could've gotten better, and maybe gotten out someday and be Mr. Osborn again. But we put him in there and he died and now Harry's dad is dead and it's-"
"Falcon, meet me at my location. Cloak and Dagger, final sweep, then ready for extraction."
Steve kisses him back, and he thinks maybe he could tell Steve instead. Steve is more than enough to help him believe it. Because Steve is good, and brave, and so much better than Tony.
He gets a smile and a brief tightening of fingers on his shoulder for that, and T'Challa releases him with a glance to the press. "Go, Avenger," the Panther commands. "Give them hope."
If we could equip those to our satellites with an early detection system, something like this wouldn't have even happened. And the Chitauri weapons, adapted to ours?
"I know you can, Don," he says, and the kid looks just a teensy bit mollified. "But practice never hurt anyone."
It's good to hear from you. I'm glad you didn't end up back in jail.
showing it. Make it part of the act and it becomes your strength. So Tony turns to face Bucky Barnes and he thinks of his parents. He lets the grief he still feels settle more deeply into his bones than ever before. This man will not hurt him. He can't. Not more than this.
Tony's grin is all teeth and edges. "Oh, you'll get a lot more than that." As if on cue, Natasha slinks into the room, looking barely ruffled by Fury's presence. Clint, not five seconds later looks a bit more shocked and Rhodey, legs half on and assisted by Vision, almost slips.
think I'm asking of you, right now."
. How can they not come back to him?
pretty damn chatty when we found him."
He wants to get better.
Fury breathes in sharp through his nose, lips twisting down. "We knew your parents had been assassinated. We didn't know by who until Agent Romanov's data bomb, and even then it took us months."
"It doesn't frighten you?"
He laughs without humor, lets his hands relax from the fists he didn't realize he was clenching tight. "I'm holding you to that."
He had been so sure MIT would accept him. So sure that they would see the value of his mind, that they would help prove himself to his parents. Now, with this rejection letter, he was left with nothing, once again.
"No, I - I
"The Avengers
Tony thinks, smiling grimly.
"But you won't, will you, Tony? I don't need to paralyze you. You'll do all the work for me. Because you always come back here. It's where you belong."
is what Tony owes Bucky Barnes.
"Conflict of interest. I see where you're going. The council is talking about this like its registration but that was never the deal. Cage, Spider-Man, Daredevil - they don't want to be Avengers? They shouldn't have to play by the rules we do."
Captain Danvers smiles brightly and pulls him into a hug. "We miss you around the base. No matter what, you promise to come visit us soon, alright?" When she gets a nod from Rhodey she rises and shakes Tony's hand again. "Iron Man's help would not go unappreciated either, Mr. Stark. Food for thought. It was nice to meet you. I'll see myself out."
"You did?" Bruce asks, surprised. Rhodey shoves the stool at Tony, reaching out for him again, but Tony finds himself jolting back, knowing that if anyone touches him right now he will careen into the stars and the desert and not come back down again for awhile.
"Director Carter would've liked it," he barrels on, unable to look anywhere else but his coding. "Making everybody work together. Banging heads together. She'd feel right at home."
He leaps to his feet, kicking away the sheets and blanket and the last dregs of sleep, and stumbles over. Caught up in the sudden burst of adrenaline and - and excitement - he doesn't check the number, a rookie mistake Natasha would have his head for if she was here, and flips open the lid to the phone without hesitation.
as the barometer for popular slang."
but Bucky seemed to understand him anyway if his eye roll was any indication.
It beats like a drum in his head.
And nearly tripped over the man lying in his path.
Tony rubs at his chest and the bridge of his nose simultaneously, nodding. He does. He'd put his life in Nat's hands any day, and he'd place his soul in Rhodey's without hesitation. But there are parts of him that he has to keep safe, parts where he can't let anyone reach anymore. He let Steve in there, and he didn't even realize it. Followed the man proudly on the field, admired the hell out of him off of it. There was nothing Rogers could do that would convince Tony to leave his side. Until there was.
"You always say the nicest thing, honeybear. Just for that, five hours tonight, scouts' honor."
Well, gee, nothing like getting the 'acquaintance' brush-off from the girl you assisted building her eighth-grade science fair volcano. See if Tony ever makes realistic inflammable lava for her ever again. "Agent Carter. This is a surprise."
He can't look at his best friend, cold and silent and still. He leans back against the frozen glass and closes his eyes, thinks of Bucky as the lean, bright-eyed sergeant he'd been in 1944, hanging out of treetops with his rifle and a cigarette, trying to teach everyone German so the Nazis would know when they were being insulted. "God, I miss you," he breathes out. "I wish you were here. I wish we were there." It's not fair to the real Bucky, sleeping just two feet away, but life hasn't been very fair to either of them, has it? Steve will take what he can and get by how he has to.
"The council is not you, Tony," T'Challa says. "And you are not yourself around them. Stop deflecting and tell me." When Tony remains silent over the next few moments T'Challa sighs and comes to a stop, turning to Tony. "My first and only duty will always be to Wakanda, but when I am away and something happens to my team, I cannot help but feel guilt that I could not help. It helps a great deal to have your words and opinions on how the battle fared. Please, Tony."
She nodded, scarcely able to speak, and as one, mother and son flew together, holding each other close for several minutes as the truth sunk in. Her little boy would be
"Why don't you just web your feet, make them sticky?" Donald suggest, thickening up the piece he's working on.
Wanda meets Steve's eyes over Scott's shoulder. "I need to make my own choices," she says, to all of them.
Rhodey isn't having it. "You went to talk with your parents' killer - for three days - and you think we're
father. Oh
Steve didn’t know why that hurt, that this Tony couldn’t stand his Steve. He didn’t always like his Tony, himself, but…but they were friends, in their own way. There was nothing friendly in this Tony’s gaze as he looked upon Steve and saw another man. Another him. Maybe that’s what hurt. To see such coldness in the same eyes he saw every single day, shining up at him – sometimes with laughter, more often than Steve liked with wrath, but always something, never blank and icy and dead – it was like something had been stolen from him.
"Brussels," Sarkissian scoffs. "Was a nothing. Another shot in a war I've fought for years. A...what is that phrase? An 'I-told-you-so' to my associates."
“I don’t wallow,” Steve shot back.
"Iron Man!" Cage shouts. "Get back up here!"
Tony rolls until he is facing up towards War Machine's impassive face, matching his speed from above him. "Baby, you thought I only took you out for a test drive? No, sweetie pie, we are going all the way today."
Steve has used the word 'damn' on one his comments on the front.
Rhodey hadn't even looked up. "I have tried so hard to keep you safe," he whispered. "But I guess I don't know how."
"Uh," Tony says, and Gwen's eyes turn sharp exactly the way Pepper's do when he's done something fond and exhausting. "Of course not. That would be rude."
We meet on the couch in the common room or in the workshop, always in the moment right after the dead of night when neither of us can sleep. The first time we did this, before it was a habit, before it became a therapy that didn’t feel like flaying my brain open, it was an attack on his part, practically begging me to lay out a sob story just so he could tear it to pieces.
"-and you hurt someone seriously. What if you, you who have said yourself that you're still learning everything you can do, take out a load-bearing wall on accident and collapse a building on innocent civilians. What should happen to you?"
Tony's phone rings.
FRIDAY says, something like a warning in her voice even as she follows his commands. "
NATASHA:
Tony takes a breath, deep as he can, feels the echo of those terrifying minutes after Obie took the arc reactor in his chest. "Yeah," he whispers. "Dummy's good people. Dumb, artificial, good people."
Tony practically beamed at the praise, his face lighting up brighter than the repulsor node in his chest. "That's the idea, Cap. I'll be faster, stronger, and all the other Daft Punk adjectives, rolled into one lean, mean, alien-fighting machine. You guys can sit back, relax, and drink virgin mojitos by the wave pool - I've got this totally handled."
"How was Canada?" Steve asks.
T'Challa's pissed.
Barnes' eyes, so dark before, are positively gleaming as they lift back up to Tony's face. "Why do you think you owe me?" Barnes asks, blunt, almost sharp.
“Hey,” Sam protested, proud of himself when his voice only cracked a little. “Its not like Tony’s much better. Do you know how many punching bags Steve breaks after a go-round with Stark? Bloody knuckles, Natasha!”
"We are not talking about Barnes."
"Then you should come show it off to us!" Jan said cheerily. "Steve's dying to see it!"
Later, when he's calmed down, Steve remembers that things happened even after the bomb. Diamondback hasn't changed out of her costume since they returned and she has yet to move from this spot outside Madame Hydra's observation room, but when Steve approaches her eyes snap straight to him, her senses not dulled in the slightest.
his mind and stuffed something else in its place, that's not
They stop there that day, Barnes beginning to shake and shiver enough that one of the icily calm Wakandan scientists comes to collect him. That night, Tony goes out wandering the Wakandan streets alone, buying a cheap knock off smart phone from one of the vendors lining the thoroughfares that shoot of the main street. He dismantles it when he returns to his room, fiddling with the software, the location tech in particular before making some adjustments to the tiny chip that controls the connection to the service provider. When he puts it back together and boots it up, he and FRIDAY work on configuring the modified phone to Stark's most private access channels, the one only a few have access to.
, but all that makes it out is a carefully controlled, "Are you alright?"
-the '21st century upspeak' down pat
, he once told Bruce to convince him to help create Ultron.
That was Tony's vision of the future. Progress, at the sacrifice of everything else, and all controlled by Tony Stark.
NATASHA:
"Yeah," Tony says, feeling sure. "I think it's the right path."
"And you, Tony?" Vision asks. "What would be your best dream?"
“On top of the old,” Tony grouses, and Steve slings an arm around him to drag him close, pressing a kiss to his temple.
Tony slowly nodded, but from the furrow appearing on his brow Steve could tell he didn't quite get it.
Clint accepts that with all his usual grace - none - and keeps away from Rhodey. Even now, as they all gobble down Laura Barton's pot roast and a thousand talking points shift from minute to minute there is still a line there where the conversations don't cross.
Are you alright?
"I'm sorry, Mr. Stark?"
"Is that what I'll be doing?"
T'Challa just raises an eyebrow, glancing to his side. "I'm assuming the spider will be going with us?"
It's not his forgiveness, because Tony can't look him in the eye and give it to him, not yet. But Tony knows better than most that
“But you didn’t have to be,” Tony had insisted, because he had done his job and protected his team.
There is the beginning of a hesitant, cautious smile on Steve’s face that Tony feels himself returning. Like the old man said: Together.
Tony would have done it. Iron Man would always be there when things got tough. But this wasn’t the war, and nobody needed to go dying in any trenches when Tony could help.
Tony actually rolls his eyes. Not the smartest idea, but Bruce can handle it. "You gonna Hulk out and join us out in the field anytime soon? No? Then congrats, you don't have to sign the Accords. They don't say anything about us having consultants. Ross tries anything I got an army of lawyers ready to bury his ass. T'Challa and I have basically stonewalled him anyway, but if you really wanted to stick it to him, you could speak out."
that this way is the only way we can ever move forward, the only way the Avengers can go on existing. And I wasn't lying when I said I thought they were the right thing to do. I believe in them. Or at least what they could be."
is that what you did
thing, like he does
T'Challa watches Tony work with Donald. It's a bad day, the kid gets triggered almost immediately, and Tony heads out into the hall while Blizzard goes into lockdown until he can be brought back out of this state safely.
Stark didn't seem to hear him. He reached out an fiddled with the collar of Steve's jacket, laying it flat just so. "The best man I ever knew. I wish you were here. I wish you were
He has never wished for Steve Rogers more than at this moment. Steve might not have supported the Accords, he maybe never will, but Godammit when the man drew lines in the sand, he stuck to it. Plus, if anyone could shame a senator or representative into remembering the spirit of fairness and righteousness it would be him.
"You can fly."
FRIDAY says softly, and Tony exhales painfully, not even realizing he'd been holding his breath. Donnie is only a few steps ahead of him, loudly reciting some of
"Thinking about it," Rhodey answers. He is currently pouring over the codes for the new AI Tony has built for War Machine. He mutters out of the side of his mouth, "We are not naming her JOCASTA."
And isn't this an uncomfortable case of looking in the mirror. "Peter, Gwen Stacy is a civilian. A very smart civilian, no doubt, but she shouldn't be involved in stuff like this. I'm not saying I won't look into it, but I can't go hacking into something like this - if I'm caught it wouldn't just affect me, it would affect all of the Avengers." His phone begins buzzing again and once more he silences it. "I'll do all I can. Tell Gwen thank you for me."
I'm heading out on a solo mission. This is a heads up. I won't be able to update you on the team.
“They’re getting worse?” Sam asked, dismayed. Natasha only shrugged.
"Agent Barton." There is far more warning in Vision's voice now, if you know how to hear it. Clint does not.
He grits his teeth and bears it. "Still can't decide which one of us you're more jealous of, huh, babe?"
“What’d I do?” he said into her shoulder.
They don't die.
For Big Steve had stuck his hand right into the fog, and was inching forward. “I think this was just a temporary reprieve, Shellhead,” he called over his shoulder. “It’s time for me to go back.”
When Tony dreams that night it is Steve above him again, shield in his hands, ready to bring it down onto Tony's face. Bucky Barnes is lying armless a few feet away. "I want to stop coming here," he tells Steve. "Why couldn't you just tell me?"
"I'm always cheerful," Tandy says brightly. "It comes part and parcel of being the non-brooding half of a superhero duo. Seriously, though, don't worry about them. Leighton broke Tyrone's nose when they brought her in. He was quite attached to the shape of his nose. I don't think he's ever forgiven her." She laughs at her own joke and it rings out high and sweet, not like the slightly maniacal bend to Rachel's laughter twenty feet away as she dodges one of Cloak's traps. "To answer your question. I produce light energy, Cloak produces dark. We feed off of each other."
"That was the plan." Steve hesitated, then barged on. "So you heard, then. And you're not mad?"
back like its a revelation every time and never say a word back, the ones that take almost as much a beating from your grief as you do, they're invaluable. The real deal. Tony should know; his is upstairs.
Yeah, that's not going to go over well.
That sounds like something out of Jules Verne novel. Is this the future?"
-not yet. but hes trying youre trying. itll work out punk. it can't get any worse.
They make an interesting procession to the theater, parking in an enclosed, well secured garage and making their way down to Broadway in pairs and trios. Tony wishes he could sit with the Khans and see their faces light up at the spectacle - because no matter his other opinions about treacly, trope-y
"FRIDAY, call Agent Secretary for me."
"Bringing the car around," Rhodey answers. "You are ice cold, man, like you've been sitting in the snow. You sure you're okay?"
Pepper lays her forehead in between his shoulder blades. The heart necklace falls from her shirt and hits his spine; he can hear the pieces clinking together and his chest throbs in response.
"Me? The drunken blacksmith, the war-monger? They need
"That's okay. You've always were a bit too big for your body. Way back in college when you were like five foot nothing and weighed one hundred pounds soaking wet. Hey, this is nothing compared to Professor Eikenburg's Advanced Mechanics, huh?" Rhodey's voice is completely even, collected, even amused. There is a large hand covering Tony's aching sternum.
Stark set the glass down, fingering the rim, and then turned to him, eyes suddenly very wet. "Are you happy?" he asked, leaning close. "You know I don't believe in God, Sheriff. I don't - I don't know where you went. But I know I'm not going to the same place. Tell me now, while we've got the chance."
"Gee, I wonder how all this could have been avoided," Barton spits, glaring at Natasha.
"Nope, you're not fun, Johnson! That's one of Tandy's qualities. You two! Madame HYDRA is not just going to sit around while you chit chat, let's go!"
"FRIDAY, scan."
"It was better that way. No secret stays buried, and if those Soldiers were found out they wouldn't either. Someone will always be after that serum, Mr. Stark, surely you realize that. The world doesn't need more super soldiers. The two we do have have done more than enough." For good or for bad he doesn't clarify. Everett Ross, from his history, has no strong feelings either way for Captain America, not surprising from a foreigner and from someone brought up during America's fight in Vietnam when Captain America's good name was worth less than dirt. Perhaps that's what makes him so suited to this job.
To both their surprises, this gets a bark of laughter out of him; he internally commends her on having the good grace not to comment on the slightly crazed bend to it. It tapers off, the vestiges echoing faintly around them. Tony grins at the floor tile just in front of where she stands. "Yeah. I've had better days. Better months, really."
"Leave him with me," Tony tells Coulson. "You scare him."
“The other you-“ Tony stopped, shaking his head, but Big Steve just rubbed his shoulder comfortingly. “I was trying to help, but he didn’t like it. How I did it. He said we should do it together but then he doesn’t listen. I don’t know – I’m sorry.” Tony gritted his teeth. “Armor, scan for anomalies. I’m sitting here whining to you when-“
In the middle of the sea of concrete and glass and Winter Soldiers sits Bucky Barnes, strapped up to a dentist chair. Tony remembers things he won't know for years yet, a red-haired woman with sad eyes who shows him files and files of how this chair broke people.
"Yeah, well," is all Steve offers. "I've been neglecting my duties as team leader, but not anymore."
“Don’t leave me,” he whispers into Tony’s hair as the man trails kisses down his neck, lips trailing over the pulse beating double time in his neck over and over, a point of fascination for Tony.
He watches the words spin around and around.
Tony says edgily before he slumps down, tired. "I went there to help. I always try to help, I really do, Viz, but I just can't seem to do that. Maybe I'm not built for it. I'm an engineer, I fix things. I build them. But I don't - I don't know what I am."
," Vision says, going incorporeal.
I tell him about the horrible things, the dark things. I tell him about the smell of rotting corpses - he counters with the smell of burning flesh. I tell him about the quiet of ice and he sneers ‘remember when you almost closed me up in space?’
Stranger still is a red hourglass he instinctively identifies as compassion, a shining medal for loyalty, a black claw of honor, a yellow gem gleaming with curiosity and a green one of forgiveness.
Tony stares at the table, shrugs. "He did bad things, suffered bad consequences. That part's easy. The why of it all..."
"Fury," a voice barks over the phone.
"That, I am afraid I cannot do," he says instead, sending the memo off to Human Resources. "I need you, Jenny Wan Kenobi. You're my - I mean, you're not my only hope, but damn, lady, you are pretty damn close."
"Just go, Tony," Bruce says, giving him a good-natured shove towards the door. Tony obeys, heading out into the hallway and up the stairs to the first floor, where the War Room is held. (Steve had hated that name when he'd first heard it and made that fact well-known, but all it really did was launch a ten-minute discussion between the rest of the Avengers on if Captain America would enjoy
"I didn't hunt anyone down. I asked them to come in quietly and they refused."
But Tony wasn’t paying attention to him, walking a little way so he could see more of the campus. “It’s not a bad idea, I suppose. All those supers in one place, training. Ross would have a field day…Oh, what’s that?”
"Tahiti," the agent says softly. "It's a -" He cuts himself off and steps closer to Tony. The crew behind him spreads out along the living room, looking at the knick-knacks left behind. "I came here because I need your help."
Fury leans forward in his chair, and the creak of it breaks the quiet and all of Tony's righteous anger. He walks carefully over to where Rhodes is and the two of them slowly sink down onto the loveseat. Rhodey keeps a hand on his forearm as Tony beats out a mindless melody against his fake sternum.
"Of course," is the reply, like it would be anything else. Steve gets to work on the computers, noting with dismay that the data is already being corrupted. He finds a drive plug-in and gets the SHIELD-issue stint in place, shutting down the deletion process and allowing him to take a look while the files transfer. "Time is of the essence, and Madame Hydra waits for no bitch. I know her better than anyone here, I could have a lock on her in no time if some people would just let me take a look."
“Cell phones now,” Tony corrects, and Steve looks at him dubiously, and they’re off, cataloging the differences, the similarities, and he never thought of using buildings as metaphors - left that up to architects who waxed philosophic about arches and singers who sang uncomfortably intimate songs about their hometowns - but it seems to be working now so he sticks with it.
Their seats are incredible, of course, and the play is just as trite as Tony remembers but Donnie seems to enjoy it. The Avengers all have their comms in and are muttering to each other about the play, though it is largely taken up by Kamala's awe-struck squeals whenever Christine Daae so much as dips her dopey little ankle. Bruce is particularly occupied with the Phantom while Natasha is oddly enamored of Meg Giry and Tony sings dirty lyrics to 'Music of the Night' until they all hiss for him to be quiet. For the most part they are quiet, just a friendly presence in each other's ear.
"FRIDAY!"
? Not all your fault. I hate it when you guys do that. Stop trying to take things away from me, okay? I chose this. Like, I am fully aware of how pushy you are, dude, and I did all that stuff anyway. I'd do it again. Because it's my choice."
"FRIDAY?" he snaps.
Tony rears back. "I am nothing like Ross-"
Fury's joking, but this is completely accurate. One day Peter Quill tells Fury about this older gentleman who could wrap himself ten times around a pole and his invisible wife but 'like, the guy would not shut up about string theory, man! Your friend there has been ON FIRE for the past ten minutes. Explain that!')
Just as he feet turned back to the quad, the door behind him slid open with a hiss, and James Rhodes spilled out onto the night. He was wearing his rudimentary skeleton armor he wore around campus sometimes on his off days, his giant shoulder gun freshly gleaming on its perch. Upgrades no doubt, and Tony was likely inside rehauling the War Machine.
About the time Tony starts beating out the
"Wanda." His voice creaks; he swallows. He finds himself cataloging her appearance, nonsensical things like does she still have all her limbs and is she eating enough and are her clothes in a good state. All the things that Vision will want to know. All the things he's worried about, when he's let himself worry about her. "You're alright."
Tony closed his eyes, breathing in deeply and conspicuously evenly. “Yeah, okay, that – Christ.” And what was
Tony stares at the compound as a message from Coulson blinks on his computer.
him like this.
He can hear Peter's yelp from the other side of glass as the kid twists in midair around the wound, his momentum carrying him straight into a wall. "Shit," Tony hisses, and he and Nat scramble to the door to get inside.
"You sound like you don't think it was a suicide."
This I swear.
Tony puts up a hand. "Don't mention it. Please."
What's happening?
"Even worse." Tony leans back in his chair, away from Kamala. "Over one hundred people died in Chad, Vision."
Steve said nothing and the tears that Tony had been fighting for what felt like days now welled up. “My Steve doesn’t like
Steve looks up at Bucky's face, so pale and still. "I can't leave - I can't leave my team."
“And looking back now, I can see so many times where Dad tried to help her, or Jarvis. But see, when I was little? I didn’t want her to stop.” Tony suddenly seems very sober, staring down at his drink. “I would bring her drinks in the afternoon. Got my first sip from her.
Kamala turns back to the armor design Tony is working on, biting at her lip a little before she throws her hands up with a huff. "But I still say you should add some blue!"
"My condolences," Tony snarks tiredly before falling into silence, letting them both read through them, pleased to see that he made the right move getting Daredevil's in braille. "I don't need a yes right away - I don't even need a yes - but you both should know all your options. I'll work with you as best I can to make sure you can still help people, but if you don't sign and you don't retire, if you create a mess the public can't ignore, you will be hunted down."
God, he was infuriating and Steve hated him and Steve already felt horribly guilty that he had yelled at him like that. He'd make it up to him - he'd have to. Nine times out of ten it was Steve that had to make the first move to reconcile after their fights. Tony was either too proud or too scared to say sorry first, Steve hadn't figured out which. Maybe it was both.
NATASHA:
What if God, the universe, whoever decided this cosmic bullshit looked at Tony's future and knew that he would do something so terrible he could never be loved by anyone? Saw something inherently lacking in an infant that no amount of wishing or trying could change?
"Scientific journals," Tony confirms with a nod. "Sorry, they were all I had."
"Thank you," Tony says sincerely, knowing he's been all over the place and Bruce still trusts him to be able to carry this weight on his shoulders.
"Good girl. See? You're brilliant," Tony says. His voice shakes. "So." His thoughts begin to stutter now, the peace he felt gone.
Everything just came so easy to Stark. He had never known a struggle in his life, or if he did he just built a piece of tech to take care of it for him. It wasn’t like that for Steve – it couldn’t be, and he didn’t want it to, anyway. He wouldn’t be who he was or where he was without everything he had gone through…
You have to trust us Cap. Can you do that?
“Be patient,” Big Steve repeated. Half of his body was already inside. “Thank you,” he said, his smile a bit stronger now, and then his hand released Tony’s, and he was gone.
Instead he says, "Fury's playing us."
"Simba was a lion," T'Challa says dryly, looking back and forth between Tony's eyes. "And the answer is always you. Shall we proceed, then?"
while he ignores the kid's calls. He can't talk to Peter right now. He can't listen to his voice and try to reconcile how proud he is of Spider-Man with how scared he had been for Peter on that rooftop.
"Fuck off," Tiberius snarls and silence falls on both sides of the lines.
"Civil War," Zemo whispered ominously, and Amora promptly zapped him.
"It's not that I don't trust you," he finally says. "You've never given me any reason not to. And it's not that I don't believe that you're safe around other people."
"Who do you think I am," Tony asks dully for the second time in twenty four hours.
preens a little at T'Challa's obvious admiration of the doctor.
So, it's been a few months, I thought for any new readers I would put some things in order:
There are notes in there for Tony, Rhodes, Nat, Clint, and Vision. Even some for Spider-Man. But T'Challa is discerning and unlikely to pry if his eyes find something unwanted. "Sure."
Peter, who is more than a bit like him. Peter, who will find a way to take the blame for this.
There is more but it's lost in the warm circle of Pepper's arms as she wraps herself up against his back and around him, shushing him softly. He is ruining her sensible but stylish pantsuit, he thinks dimly, but she doesn't seem to notice or care, running her hands up and down his chest and neck until he releases the death grip he has over his mother's name and holds her instead.
Jessica Jones laughs in his face as they exchange a bottle of whiskey. "I'm not a crime fighter, man. I just - I'm a private investigator. I can't -" She looks down into her glass. "I can't do that again."
Her accent is notably more heavy than T'Challa's and her English a little less fluent, and within five seconds Tony's wondering all sorts of things about Princess Shuri and her place as the second royal child and its relation to her current and preemptive passive-aggressiveness. But he's saving all his questions for later; now he just nods and tells her 'Mr. Stark' is fine. She refuses.
are an asset that can't be wasted. I brought you out of Wakanda for a reason. You took HYDRA down twice, Captain, and you'll do it again, but not so long as they can see you coming."
that," Donnie manages. "She's so
"You won't," she assured him, gathering him close again. Tiny arms wrapped around her back and she closed her eyes. "The name doesn't lie, Steve. Anyone ever tries to tell you differently, you remember that."
,  the glory of technicalities. So what's the verdict? Figuratively speaking."
"You remember me?" he asks, and Barnes looks up at him with worn grey eyes sunk deep inside a tired face.
Tony's smile morphed into something incredulous and shy as he slowly laid the Omniwave on Steve's outstretched palm. "I put Lord of the Rings on there, the movie adaptations. You should check those out first."
Tony nods and raises a hand to his eyes. This is just like with Rhodey, he tells himself, just let this one thing go, let someone else have this pain for awhile so Tony can
Bruce blows up the scan, and gets his stylus out. "Look here, and here.
"Honestly?" Bruce asks. "I wanted to see what would make even Tony Stark have the audacity to call me for a favor."
The other man looks down at his hands, unleashing the claws and immediately retracting them. "You are welcome. I will take what you have said into consideration. Things cannot go on as they have, but perhaps I can give Captain Rogers a choice."
Rhodes' face pulled an odd sort of grin-grimace when he saw Steve, and he straightened up into a salute. "Captain."
"Not that kind of 'what,' Fry," he says, ignoring how the shaking in his hands that had only just stopped have now begun again. "How far are you on decrypting Project Samson?"
Tony wasn't even watching the movie and yet the closer Steve got, the more clearly he could hear him recite the lines sometimes even before the characters on-screen said them. However, when Pepper saw him coming and said "Captain Rogers" Tony's head snapped up so fast Steve worried for his neck.
- as well as the embedded audio. I suggest you listen once without sound, once with, and once to the audio by itself. A lot of the stuff you're going to have no idea about. That's fine - Cap tends to use military jargon, Tony has always been overly fond of shorthand commands that takes constant exposure to get used to, Natasha and I talk almost entirely in code out of habit. Don't worry about it. This is practice. There's no pressure."
"Hey, I locked down the labs, I know what I'm doing," Donnie insists angrily. "I didn't put anybody in danger. Besides, I watched that MIT thing, you went under alone-"
"I'm not keeping you here. You can get up and leave, anytime you want." With a sickening pop, the reactor comes out.
Fury sighs. "I've heard Stark's team's side. And I know what happened in Siberia. To learn that a man who railed so hard against his teammates keeping secrets from him just a year ago had been sitting pretty on a ticking time bomb with Tony's name on it for nearly twice that - well. You finally surprised me, Rogers."
For a moment the words almost won't make it past his mouth. Talking about it makes it real. That, and Natasha is going to be insufferably smug. "It's not for War Machine. It's for a new system." He can feel Natasha's eyes on him. "For a communication matrix."
“I’m fine. I don’t. I don’t need to see his stupid movies." Steve would hate how childish he sounded if it didn't feel so good to finally get some of this off his chest.
"No. Nobody does, because
For a brief moment she was afraid reality had slipped away from her entirely, and then it came again.
"FRIDAY. Call in the big guns. Tell him its urgent. Tell him he can help."
"So let's not, alright?" Barnes says.
The shield comes down.
NATASHA:
Tony raises one eyebrow. "That depends."
"Tony, I will not lecture you on the burden of leadership; you have been one for far longer than I. These people need you, that young man in there needs you. You're no good to anyone if you collapse."
Please tell Wanda I asked her to feel better soon.
which is more than i can say about you
"I think it was the right call, chief," Rhodey says, no hesitation, complete conviction. Tony curls a bit into him, trying to absorb his strength. "United we stand. It's trite, but its true."
Now the reporter retakes control of her camera and reports on what they know so far as Tony steps back to where Natasha and Vision wait in the distance. The bomb was above ground and very small, not dropped from the air as the Newark bomb was but left in the park. Steve can read between the lines of what she isn't saying: the bomb didn't create a huge cloud of Terrigen mist but it did cause a lot of property damage which means Tony was right. It was mostly meant to scare people. To let them know HYDRA is still here and still has power. The reporter announces that Belgian police will be setting up a tip hotline for any suspicious activity in and around the city.
Tony can stop right now, let this lie; Bruce doesn't think he's a monster for attacking Barnes and that should be enough. Let this be the end of the story. But Tony is a little drunk right now. "He knew. Before the fighting ever started."
"You wanted us to save him," he says into the quiet. "That's why you did this."
"Healing factor, Mr. Stark. I'll be fine. Might crash on your couch for a few days." Peter lists to the side as he webs the man up, his movements overly precise to make up for whatever the blood-loss is doing to his head.
Tony's breath stutters and he drops his gaze to his hands, watching the muscles move underneath his skin when he flutters his fingers, watches them reach out for Pepper, for Obie, for Rhodey. Watches it all slips through them one by one. Watches them covered in red and gold and stretched above him, trying to block a blow from a shield that will never come because Steve was aiming for his chest.
Tony exhales, casting a long glance at the container. "Right. You have all the notes, right, I made FRIDAY transfer them-"
Tony feels his smile go a little sour. "It's something that needs to be done."
"Look, I know that you don't know me, or my former team very well," he says slowly. "But what I can tell you is this - Fury named us the Avengers, but we were the ones who made it our own. We may not have always been able to defend people like we want, but we could see to it that the justice they deserve is found. Avenger wasn't a noun for us, it was an - idea. A thought. Impossible to destroy. And we made it into reality."
"Leave it alone?" Peter exclaims, standing up. "No, that's not - Gwen gave me that to give to you so you would help us. Build us a hack to get into Osborn's systems, see what he was up to. Mr. Osborn used to take me to tee-ball practice and suddenly he turns into a super-strong maniac throwing people off a building?!
He doesn't sound sure and for a moment, Tony can't figure out what he means, until it occurs to him that with the two of them, there are very few 'befores.' His temper, already fragile, gets the better of him. "What the hell do you know.
,” Steve gritted out. “And no.”
"Terrigenesis."
"I'm on reserve status," Peter says, an edge of pained confusion in his voice as he turns to Tony. "We've already talked about this, remember? You said it was fine, you weren't going to stop me."
"Ms. Fantastic Elastic!" Peter chimes in gleefully.
Steve will never be able to comprehend what Bucky went through, what he still goes through, but he thought that whatever came he'd be able to help. Now it is staring him in the face and he doesn't know what to say.
Bucky grabbed his forearm and reeled him in. "Aw, Stevie. I didn't mean to upset you. Ms. Randall's just been warblin' on about the classics lately and its doing my head in. Just you wait 'til you have her next year. There was this band of brothers, the Sacred Band of Thebes? You'll get a good kick out of them."
, Natasha pondered,
Tony shivered at the touch, not even bothered at the smug smirk he could practically feel aimed at the back of his neck. But his outstretched fingers rested just on the edge of the rejection letter from MIT, making it impossible to forget. "You don't deserve it," he whispered.
In Tony's pocket, in his hand, the phone feels like it weighs a ton. "I'll even throw in a pretty please, Highness. Just ask him."
James edged away so he could look down and made a sympathetic face. “What will I have to do to prevent you from telling this to Anthony?” Steven asked. Anthony would worry without end, and though his mouth set in a pout was one of the most beautiful things Steven had ever witnessed, he was not overly fond of the overbearing caretaking that went with it.
He sees things you wouldn't.
No, that's not accurate, he speaks to analyze data with Tony and offer his own opinions about their extrapolation. Vision doesn't
"If you could go back," Steve parrots. "If you could change what happens to you..."
Steve, and Tony is a
"You look fabulous, Tony," Jan told him, making a space between herself and Steve and waving the three over. "How much stronger is this one than the old one?"
"I did," Tony answers calmly. "I had to."
"And the other?"
Tony starts at that, looking at Bruce like he's crazy. "Of course I'm proud of him. Do you know what that kid has done in the past four months? Nothing short of incredible."
Tony's gauntlet begins to whine as he involuntarily powers up the repulsor. He doesn't need Tiberius Stone telling him how terrifying the Super Soldier Dream Team is, he has an x-ray back home to prove it. Maybe he should do some 'leaking' of his own, show the world exactly what happens to an already fragile ribcage when a vibranium frisbee is shoved into it.
The day his parents had packed him off to Barnabus-St. Christopher's, Howard had stood in front of him, touched his chest with one finger and said 'We know there's nothing in there, don't we, boy?' He'd waited for Tony's nod before another touch came, this time to his forehead. 'This is all you've got. Don't let me down.' No more than you already have, his eyes said, and Tony had sworn to both of them he wouldn't.
"No heart. No soul."
what we're going with? C'mon, Banner, there's a video of my parents' murder on national TV, that doesn't earn me at least one sympathy point?"
Stay gone.
"But - it's got heating pads and earphones and -"
The reactor. This man must have had one, too. What
There is a dark shape forming at the edge of his vision, but when it steps into the light, it isn't Obadiah. Tony feels his pulse sky-rocket as Ultron floats over to him, settling down with the barest clank before him and leaning over his prone body.
He reaches out with a shaking hand and takes the Accords. "For the team, then, highness," he breathes out, aiming for something light. "And world peace."
And to clarify, since someone will mention it: Steve is still intent on giving Wanda her space but he knows what his choice is. As for his, 'I need' stuff, yeah it is kind of pathological, but Steve himself is kind of pathological about this. This is the man who tried to enlist five times because he needed to be out there in the war. That doesn't mean his heart isn't in the right place.
This chapter went through write after re-write after re-write, and ultimately, I'm still not one hundred percent on it, but it does contain one very important plot movement that I will talk about in the end notes. Thank you all for sticking with me, and here's to getting the next chapter out faster!
"Tony, you're just a man," Steve told him. "A brilliant one, but even you can't see the future. All you can do is leave your time in a better place then when you arrived. You can still do that. He gave you time; don't waste it on guilt."
Fury accepts the data but refuses the report, telling Steve to get some rest and come in with his team tomorrow. In the quiet of his room, Steve lays on the bed and runs his silent phone through his hands, the one that never rings. He's beginning to think it never will.
Tony watches her, that smile and the calm determination hidden in the corner of it, and knows that despite herself, nobody does 'better' better than Natasha.
FRIDAY informs him. "
"Gonna take away my merit badges?" Tony mutters. He doesn't hear Rhodey's reply, already drifting off back to sleep. He still dreams, but when he wakes next, at least he doesn't remember.
Tony smiles tightly as Vision tilts his head curiously in his direction. "This letter seems private. May I ask why you decided to share it with us?"
"I know Agent Carter got involved with the other side of your Avengers' conflict, but that's water under the bridge now," Lukin says genially. "She's the best of the best. I couldn't afford to pass that by."
He's trying not to panic for now, so instead he's decided to obsess over other things. Like the terrigenesis formula, and teaching physics to Kamala even though she won't look him in the eye, and pouring over Peter Parker's medical scans -
One thing I do want to note is that my fic has consistently stated that Steve, Bucky, Sam, and T'Challa tore up a freeway in Berlin, but it's been pointed out to me that I might have gotten my cities conflated and that might have been Bucharest? For the purposes of this story, we are maintaining that they were in Berlin.
I'm sure he did fine.
"And you, my friend, suck at subterfuge." T'Challa smiles and shrugs, resuming his walk. Tony sighs. "You realize there's nothing to feel guilty about? There's not a lot you could have done, and if you had you would be in that hearing with us tomorrow. Not a good look for royalty."
I need to go watch CW again because it is fading from my memory.
yourself like you're not a human being."
He still feels it under his nails sometimes, the dirt and blood and snow.
They smirk at each other and Tony steals a screw from her pile. "Cold turkey wouldn't work for us anyway."
They did. The team is safe, the city is saved. Even Bucky, wherever he is, is most likely safe. It’s been a good day, he should be relieved. But all he can think about is how unfocused Tony’s eyes went, how Tony never looks like that. He wants to
"You know the Captain even stopped me from hypnotizing Anthony? Said it was 'bad for his brain' and then got angry with me when I told him that if Stark didn't want to be hypnotized, maybe he shouldn't have such a weak mind! The audacity of that man. I'm only trying to help!"
Hope watches him for a response, but Tony stays silent, thinking. She's just taken it to a much grander scale than he's been thinking of, though he should've been, dammit. Wanda had worked well in isolation, especially with Pietro gone, and maybe that had made them all complacent, but kids like Kamala and Peter (and no doubt about it, there would be more kids like them) would wilt and die out here. And living out here has basically forced them all into a life that is all superhero, all the time. Great for bringing the team together, not as beneficial for actually staying sane.
Tony flicks the series of numbers off his Starkpad and points imposingly at Pepper. "You do that again and I'm having FRIDAY cut off your access."
FRIDAY's voice cuts through his panicked beating and Tony struggles in to take in and keep enough air to answer her. The beeping has stopped, he realizes dimly.
They meet Cloak and Dagger just outside, the latter wrapped around her partner and glowing bright white, echoes of tension fading from Cloak's frame. They need to work on his endurance, Steve thinks to himself, and the thought just makes him tired.
The man's lips thin. "It would be better for his case if we could see the innocent man you have argued so fervently for. Perhaps you could mention that to him."
Tony watches him at the railing for a long time, one hand wrapped around the tumbler of whiskey and one hand half reaching for the panel that would open the sliding doors leading outside. “How long has he been out there, J?” he asks softly.
Back to that again.
"Methodist church next week, Maria. I can't do a full month of Mass, I just can't. Buckled in, T?" Tony makes a noise of assent and the Starks drive off.
…it was just that sometimes he didn’t want to be. But who was Captain America to break down in the middle of quad and cry that he just wanted to go home?
And when they start calling us?
"You've seen the video, Nick," Tony says venomously. "But I'm guessing it wasn't anything you didn't already know."
"I must admit only half of that made sense."
The front page is covered in little notes and drawings from what Tony can see when T'Challa holds it out to him, but it is dominated by the large world sitting between the three printed symbols. The world is protected by a thick black ring, and in the ring are the original Avengers' symbols, side by side. His eyes dart back and forth from the arc reactor and the star, linked together by an unbreakable line.
War Machine drops a little through the sky. It makes Tony's heart race every time, but it's nothing compared to what Rhodey feels every time he pushes himself like this. Tony can't point this out, mostly because it would involve Rhodey knowing that FRIDAY is a bit more keyed into to War Machine's systems then she had been before the fall, so he just watches, heart in his throat, as Rhodey lets the thrusters reengage and brings War Machine to a hover and they all ignore the panting they hear over the comms and Tony ignores the big flashing heart rate in the corner of his HUD that doesn't belong to him.
"Please, just-" she starts sharply, and then she sucks in a deep breath. Tony watches her trying to gain control of her already impassive expression and feels like an ass.
when he looked at Steve, and it drove him crazy. Steve thought he was done with feeling like he wasn’t enough.
"No, thank you," Tony responds automatically. Donald's entire face crumples for a second before growing red, but Coulson steps between them before the situation can escalate.
"But you're not full time," Kamala reasons. "The Avengers only have like, three colors! Black, gold, and red. They need some variety!"
Steve raises the shield higher. "I was trying to protect me."
"He read them?" he whispers through numb lips.
He stiffens, one heel going up to take another step back, raising further when she lifts her hand, but she's shaking it side to side. "No, I meant - with Barnes. Steve asked me to be there. To make sure he stayed stable."
We both know that's not how this works. if you wanted to do this on your terms you should have thought of that before.
But Bruce - Bruce is right there, looking at him steadily. He won't go away without a word from Tony and some old part of him bristles at that but he is mostly just. Glad, really. To have his friend by his side. He looks up, meets big, brown, concerned eyes. He pretends. "Will we be able to reverse-engineer anything out of it?"
"Get me the Defenders and the council on the phone, Fry. In that order."
"I'm sorta drowning in emails right now, Cage. Threat assessment?"
"And there are some things you can," she snaps, finally looking at him. Steve raises his hands placatingly, watching several objects drift up into the air around her.
Tony gives up the ghost, looks down at his hands and watches them tremble where they are wrapped tight around his knees.
he begs himself.
Thank you Nat. I appreciate it.
Tandy looks away from where her partner is begrudgingly practicing with Diamondback. "Lookie, lookie, here," she sing-songs sweetly. "Steve Rogers deigning to speak with me outside a mission!" It is not unkind, but the rebuke is not subtle.
"It could be," Steve answered.
"So what number was that on the list?" Sam asks. At Steve's quirk of an eyebrow, he grins. "The Captain America 'Go Team Go' Speeches. Patented 1944-" Steve groans, provoking a laugh from the other man. "Seriously, though. You know I'm always with you. Someone's got to watch out for you." Sam stands, clapping him on the shoulder as he moves to leave.
he'd said and then - "What am I - where?"
They all, once again, turn to Rachel, who is watching the proceedings curiously. "What exactly are you asking?" she says. "I'll fight to take down HYDRA any day of the week, but we've been doing that. What's so different now?"
His last word hung in the air, an angry echo drowned out by Steve's harsh breathing. He didn't even know who he was yelling at. Tony Stark, he thought, always so good at getting under his skin no matter what the dimension.
I think he'd like to.
I thought you had. I was counting on it because Steve Rogers Hates Secrets. I thought 'wow Stark took that really well how out of character'
So there was a third party. Did Tony know?
"What's the matter, Stark? Truth a bitter pill to swallow, huh. It's hard to do your job when your hands are tied, isn't it? God, who could have predicted that?" Clint adopts a mock puzzled look and Tony stares resolutely at the controls even though his hands are shaking too badly to take over auto-pilot from FRIDAY.
"Sure thing, kiddo."
Barnes maintains eye contact for a long moment before he drops his eyes down to the sheaf of papers sitting on the table in front of him. He fans them out one handed. "He gave this to me."
supposed to mean?
Vision doesn't need sleep so he can keep up with Tony when the engineer works long hours into the night, but every single time Tony sees him open his mouth and then close it, something almost like hesitation on his smooth face. He thinks about what T'Challa said, his team waiting in the wings for Tony, and suddenly he can't stand it. He can't stand to see Vision not let the words out, for Vision to be so unsure.
"Donnie
"I was trying to protect you," Steve says. Tony shakes his head. "I was trying to protect Bucky."
On screen, a tall man the caption tells him is New York City Police Captain George Stacy is frowning at the camera.
"You sound so cheerful."
"I'm not that kind of doctor, Tony."
"Time for Iron Man to change the game, then," Tony decides, stepping into the machine and letting the Mark II assemble around him. "I hear the Raft is nice this time of year. Cap's going to be insufferable."
"I know he made his choice," Natasha responds irritably. "But we can't just leave him to the wolves."
"We don't get to decide what the Avengers are like to other people," Tony snaps back. "We don't get to be above it all, we don't get to pat sovereign states on the head and send them off to take a nap because we know better than they do. Wanda killed twenty people in Lagos, Bruce. Do you know how many we hurt in Johannesburg? Do you know how many Sokovians died because of Ultron? And that was all things that we Avengers did by accident. Do you not see how terrifying we are?"
Clint keeps his eyes trained forward even as he grimaces through his answer. "Sir, Steve Rogers contacted me on the fifteenth and asked for my help in taking down an international criminal. I reported with Scott Lang and Wanda Maximoff to Germany where we were to take a plane to Siberia. The other team tried to stop us and we fought."
"If that was true, Germany would have won World War II," Tony points out. Tiberius makes a noncommittal hum in response. "Besides, I'm an Avenger. 'Avenge' is right there in the name. We don't turn in the badges 'til we get retribution."
"Friends who stuck us in the Raft," Sam points out, keeping his voice calm and even. "Wanda, what happened in Lagos was an accident. Things could have gone a lot worse if you hadn't acted. It's the same principle here."
Natasha's mouth pulls down. "I rarely do."
BANNER:
"But I've been away from the States for months, I dropped out of college." Aamir's voice is filled with self-loathing. "I thought my parents would always be there."
He really was Bruce. We all were.
"Well, that's the thing. We can't settle for
He wants to fill the silence for him; Tony and Steve, that’s what they do, they pick up the slack for the other. He’s going to open his mouth and say Tony, I love you, I’m sorry, Tony, I was wrong I never meant for it to get this far and I wanted to save you, I wanted to keep you safe, I wanted to
“He lost everything,” Tony said miserably. Steve didn’t even have his shield yet, because they couldn’t free it from the rubble.
, she thought as she read. For who better to complete Steve than the boy who had never left his side.
"They are always in danger, Cap. They may not be soldiers, but they've accepted it," Fury responds calmly. "And contrary to what you might believe, I know what I'm doing. Think of it as returning the favor, Captain. You and your friends made this mess. Now I'm cleaning it up."
"You should tell him that."
Steve had seen his Tony drunk once or twice, usually only at the infrequent parties the Academy held; it wasn't a sight he enjoyed. For one, it was illegal as Tony was underage; for another, Tony became incredibly maudlin and clingy and Steve was not well-equipped to deal with that. Most importantly, though, drunk people reminded him of his father, and the reminder was not pleasant. He didn't begrudge people their fun, he simply did not want to be around it.
"You are?" Steve asked, surprised.
"And you never forgave him," Rhodey finishes solemnly. "I mean, what did he know, right, Dummy turned out okay."
"Why?" Wanda asks. "Because the safest hands are our own? Shall I remind you what these hands have done?" And she thrusts her palms towards him, red sparks dancing along her fingertips. "Scott's right. If we are to be under someone else's control we might as well return home and work for Stark. At least they are our friends."
The silence is broken by Happy, a ways away, yelling at someone that they can't be there. Pepper stiffens behind him and extracts herself, getting up on her knees to glare at the intruder. "What do you think you're doing?"
“To King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table,” Barnes added, prompting a cheer from Rhodes.
He turns the page, and finds himself. He is in a vest and tie, slightly disheveled, leaning in towards the viewer. Hand outstretched, palms up. Helping. "Godammit," he whispers, the paper crunching up in his fist.
"You're the boss, Tony," she replies.
Steve looks down at the phone and takes a moment to remember and to believe that they are trusting him with this. Maybe he could stand to trust himself a little, as well.
Well Tony disagreed. Obviously. my friend Bucky got involved and they wanted to kill him. Bucky's completely innocent, he was controlled by HYDRA. So i had to protect him, get him out of the country. We found out Bucky was being framed for that UN bombing by a Sokovian with a grudge and we went after him. Tony tried to stop us to take us in. Bucky and I got away but the rest got caught, thrown in the Raft.
"Practical," Obie corrected. His eyes fixed on Tony with a certain gleam (And years from now, when distance has made the hurt that is his son lessen, he will see Obie looking at Tony with that same gleam and worry, but by then it will be too late. Tony will laugh in his face. 'Obie is the one person who's always been fair to me.'
"Quite. And you?"
A ragged cheer rose up and they all stood to follow the two girls to the new venue, still incomplete but rocking a fully operational bar, in the middle of campus. Only two figures remained.
"Yes," Tony hisses, turning back to the screen. "Do you get it?" His father, in the dream, pumping that viscous liquid into Barnes while the other Winter Soldiers looked on. All the versions of the formula were gone, except those known by Arnim Zola, a man the US Government had let into SHIELD. A man who used his cover to experiment on Barnes for years and years before he went HAL 9000.
It's so quiet. It was never quiet in Wakanda, or in the compound, or in the Tower, or in the war camp, or in Brooklyn. Jesus, Steve hates the quiet, the way it builds up in his head until he feels like he has to scream. No screaming here. He can't show these people any weakness.
"I?" Aamir gapes over at him. "I want?"
For several seconds, Steve got to experience the unique sight of a speechless Tony Stark as the teen opened and closed his mouth and then very carefully laid down his stylus. "What?"
But now Steve was here, in his time, and everything Tony couldn’t be was staring him in the face. Well no, he corrected himself, that would dare imply that Steve saw him at all. Captain America looked at Tony Stark and saw everything wrong with the world, everything that wasn’t there for him.
"I-" Tony stumbles back a little at the realization. "Jesus. I'm my father. I'm actually Howard. Please shoot me, Bruce."
"What about this doesn't make sense?" Tony says wildly. Why are they looking at him like this, like he's to be feared? If he's right, and he's always right, then his father has made a huge mistake, and Tony has to fix this. "If we can isolate Barnes' serum and find it in Terrigenesis, then great. But what if its not? What if it's a different formula, my father's formula? He would never have settled for Barnes. Barnes is weaker than Steve, slower, doesn't heal as fast. Do you - do you
to stop, and it’s
Peter huffs a breath and then, a long moment later, pokes Tony in the side. Tony looks over and raises an eyebrow and Peter rolls his eyes. "You realize you're totally trying to parent me, right?"
"It's fine, Wanda," he tells her, even though the last thing Bucky needs is more people in his head. "Only maybe wait until he can give you permission, next time."
"Is that a threat, Tony?" T'Challa asks, dangerously soft.
And then he heard it.
(And he would tell him. He would show Tony what Zola showed him. But he doesn’t
"You have been. You will be," Tony assures him. "Come gatecrash the party when I see him at OsCorp. Dollars to doughnuts he needs you and is too stubborn to admit it." If Peter and Harry are the kind of friends Peter thinks they are, then Harry needs him doubly so. The friends that you can scream at, the ones who will listen to you repeat yourself over and over about how
“If it was just routine, we could have taken care of it though,” Jan said, and Tony stiffened. Slowly, he turned his head towards Jan, lowering his sunglasses so he could see her clearly. Jan raised her hands. “I’m sure your bots were perfect, Tony, but can’t you see his point? This is our job. What we signed up for. We shouldn’t leave it in the hands of-“
"Pot, kettle. Gee, wonder who we learned that from?"
Of course, they had a point. Learning how to finally fix the serum with the science they had now might not fix Terrigenesis, and even if it did, all those people had still died. What was the point in correcting it? Hadn't Tony just promised himself today that he wouldn't fall into the same traps Howard Stark had?
"No, I mean-" Peter exhales forcefully. "They're gonna lock up anybody with powers that doesn't sign?"
Tony fights not to sigh when Peter relays his information, shifting around his agenda for the thousandth time, chipping away at the few hours he's allotted for sleep. Rhodey keeps expecting him to get drunk, but Tony's just doesn't have time.
"Well, that's reassuring to hear, but I'll still want to ask. Sometimes the littlest things can help take down the biggest of problems. And you've seen what Norman got into."
He moves his finger away, tucks the phone inside his pocket again. T'Challa is back within the minute, and with one grave nod they are off to the helicopter.
"Of course I do," Rhodey says, achingly fond. He drops his arms and steps forward into Tony's space. "Go to town."
"Captain," Sam prompts. "Orders?" He has stepped farther away than any of them, holding himself back or holding himself close or both, Steve doesn't know anymore.
What's one more day, though? There's a whole endless stretch of time out in front of him. Steve has time. Steve has nothing but time. He'll wait here, until its better. He'll be better. Tomorrow.
"Go crazy. Send a free copy to Parker's school, too." He needs sleep.
"You came here because you were scared," she scoffs at him, caustically nonchalant. "You've been stumbling around this place half-blind for two months, we all saw you. You can't bear to be outside a fight, but you're just swinging your fists around. You don't actually care."
Rhodes' smile dropped, and he took a step forward. "Aw, don't look like that, Rogers. Some people just don't see eye to eye. Doesn't make any less of what they are to each other."
NATASHA:
I doing this again?"
She thinks about it and reluctantly seems to accept it, sitting down beside him and carefully sorting the nuts and screws and washers into piles. "I guess we'll have to adjust our expectation from now on."
"Are you
"Thanks, Tony." Peter cannot contain himself; he throws his arms around Tony and squeezes tight. Tony doesn't return the hug but his eyes are still closed when Peter pulls away.
"Diamondback!" Steve warns, and the comm falls silent. Out of the corner of his vision, his excellent eyesight catches Diamondback through the partially open door, petulantly throwing a shuriken at the floor.
Spider-Man is already back on his feet, dodging blows. "You're just a child!" Mean Green cackles. "You think you can beat me? I know you, Spider-Man! I made you! I brought you into this world and now I'm taking you out!"
Kamala takes a deep breath and begins walking around the room, picking stuff and putting stuff down. Tony's not too concerned; Butterfingers has located the fire extinguisher and is stalking her from a reasonable distance. "My parents' funeral," she begins, and his stomach plummets. "Aamir's been putting it off for as long as he can, but they need to be at rest. It's already been too long, the mosque has called and my aunts and uncles-"
bomb, as Madame Hydra clenches her fist and presses the trigger. Steve roars and Diamondback wrenches her blade to the left.
"We promise. You're a member of this team. Reserve status, retired like me, whatever, you are an Avenger," Clint says firmly. "But you
It's new, a bare spark of idea he's been slowly building in the back of his mind all day since he woke up from that dream, feeling a little bit inspired and hopeful. News that Steve had approved and agreed with their plan of attack had not diminished those feelings at all. In fact, to Tony's surprise, he felt bolstered.
"Aw, Caesar," Tony simpers, just to see Tiberius jolt at his old childhood nick-name. "You say the nicest things to me." He and Rhodey stand and head for the door.
He could do all that, and be no better than HYDRA. Make a mold of a man, and fit the broken pieces of a human being inside, burn and melt him until he had no choice but to give in, to fit.
Tony's left arm is aching. It catches at Tony's mind, something about -
BANNER:
Tony's mind sort of blanks out for a moment, stunned by everything Bruce is not saying. He finally takes a step back, then another and another until he is back out in the foyer. "You were there, too," he says and he has never sounded so small. "I know I messed up but I wasn't alone."
Steve stood there, seeing nothing but hurt in the other man’s eyes, and he didn’t know what he could do, he didn’t know how it had gotten this far so quickly, they had only been together one day, they hadn’t work towards anything, and now he was standing there once again fighting against Tony.
“Yeah,” his other self said, and Tony was sure at that moment that the Hulk would have hit him if he hadn’t stopped. When he saw the Hulk again after all this was over he was going to give him a glass staircase as an apology, for the collection of course. “Stop, stop,” his other said with an authority that even now he couldn’t understand, no one had control over the Hulk.
“You two are gross, please don’t talk about your sex life around me,” Tony said throwing a pillow at them, of course she caught it before it hit her and tossed it back.
“Sorry,” he said suddenly exhausted, it had been a long time since anything like that has happened, he usually kept those thoughts out of his mind, he couldn’t handle them, and he knew this. “I wrote this into the story because the whole thing had been pretty much swept under the rug when I was a kid, they didn’t want people to know that you could kidnap a Stark to make money, but for some reason it only ever really happened to me.”
“Why did you wait until now to tell me this,” Tony said not wanting to fear the worse about why Steve hesitated to talk to him.
“You can call her Dory for short,” Harley said smiling at his baby sisters.
“It’s okay,” Thor said making his way towards the glove.
“I regret not being able to save my sister,” she said her face stoic. “I regret all of the years I spent trying to please him, I regret that even when I wanted my revenge against him and everyone who wronged me, I went about it the wrong way.”
“Yeah well, we were grounded for a month because of it… remember, we’re grounded until Christmas, which sucks because we’re not even allowed to go to the dance,” Harley said his voice close enough to hear his brothers bickering. The phone dropped onto the floor as Harley and Peter went at it, it was funny to listen to them fight like that, because he had never had that chance, he was in the middle, with Hank and Bruce being closer in age they were thick as thieves, but Steve was the baby until Peter came and then Harley.
P.S. read the note at the end
“Dad, I want one like that,” Miles said to Tony.
Anyways, back to his first writing class, he was the youngest person in the class, and he was alright with it, he had to get special permission to be in the class too, even with him skipping everything else, because the professor was very adamant that the student weren’t encumbered with a heavy course load. But it was also one of the school’s most prestigious professors, a New York Times bestselling author named Phil Coulson, he had written several books about a team of agents within a government agency, most of the novels diving deep into the corruption of government and the fragility of human relationships. Never knowing who to trust, Tony had loved the books, because he knew that you couldn’t trust everyone you met, there was always someone who had an ulterior motive. Sometimes he thought about Natasha as one of the agents, but that was only because she was very sneaky and shared one particular characteristic with one of the main characters, and that was her love of knives.
“I don’t want anything to do with this, honestly I washed my hands of this the moment he told me that he was going to use it as his final project,” Tony said standing up not wanting to be in the room any longer. “If you want my opinion, yes, he did write at least half of the story, and you can grade him on that, my half of the story doesn’t need to reflect that grade.”
“You should still eat your vegetables, because if you do Morgan will eat hers and then I wouldn’t have so many problems trying to get her to eat healthy.”
“Not really,” Steve said as the lights from what looked like a boxcar diner lit up the road in front of them. “I just wanted to take you somewhere I really liked going growing up.”
An hour after they gotten there and sat under the stars, Bucky and Natasha came barreling through the backdoor, Steve’s brothers not far behind, while Steve’s father yelled something about letting the riff raff into the house. Tony felt Steve laughing before the sound ever reached his ears, it was like feeling a slow rumble making its way up, and he liked it.
Calling Pym and getting him out of the office was easy, all he had to do was tell the man that something was glowing and he was rushing out of the room. The particles were right there, and he was glad to have found them, because it meant that Tony would have to stop feeling guilty for messing up the plan in the first place, even when it wasn’t his fault. He really wanted to punch Scott for making Tony feel bad about something that was out of his control, but at that moment he couldn’t do much. All that mattered was seeing their kids again, so he took four, in case something else happened, and rushed out of the room.
Bruce looked over at the other man disgusted at what he was suggesting. “First of all, that’s horrible...”
“And here I thought my family was big,” Tony said with a smile, “It’s nice, you know to never really be alone.”
Now that he was out of the house though, he had made a promise to his mother that he would work on his social skills. But Tony was notorious for staying away from people and hiding away in a lab, or on his laptop, his mother was glad that Natasha would be close by to pull him out of that deep hole of a life. They lived in the same building, though Nat lived one floor above him on the girl’s floor, so it was easy to move into the dorms, Loki and Clint helping Nat, while Thor helped Tony. When they were all moved in, the Stark siblings went to eat at one of the local Italian restaurants, they needed to know that it was legit Italian, their mother wouldn’t have it any other way. Once they finished, Nat went to her dorm to meet her roommate who was a close family friend, and Tony well he sat alone in his own room, not sure of what to do next.
That’s when he saw him, standing in one of the nearby aisles while reading a book that had been on the shelf, Tony had never seen the tall blonde wearing glasses before, but if Tony could wear contacts well anyone could. It had been years since he’d seen Steve Rogers, even as a teenager he hadn’t been able to approach him, but he had always remembered the smile on Steve’s face whenever he had helped out his grandmother. Tony took a picture and smiled as he posted it to his Instagram page, before getting a message from Rhodey to come over for dinner. He ended up buying all of the books, it had been an impulse decision, he hadn’t really been thinking, though Rhodey making fun of him for buying so much just made him scowl.
“I need to tell you man,” Bucky said pulling Steve out of his thoughts about the whole Tony problem currently taking over his brain. “I’m seriously in love, I didn’t know it until I saw her.”
“Ahh, there’s always something isn’t there, and you’re bribing me with coffee,” Tony smirked at him as he took another sip of the coffee, honestly, he only made it taste like caramel because sometimes when the sun shined on Tony his eyes looked like caramel, and Steve couldn’t help the smile on his face as he watched Tony drinking it. “If you bring me some coffee tomorrow, I’ll tutor you.”
“It’s what we do,” he said walking towards the door. “See you after my morning classes on Monday Pep.”
“I just wish I could have gone with you all,” he said as he settled into the pillows.
“Stop,” he said before pulling his brothers apart. “You can tell me about this later, for now I just have someone I want to introduce to you guys.”
“If they still love each other then it’s good for them, maybe it’s just that they want to keep that part of themselves private, considering how much press your family gets it wouldn’t surprise me.”
Morgan rested her head on his shoulder, she was happy and comfortable, her sisters were home, and all that was missing was Steve and Miles, both of which would show up by dinner time. He hears the car before he sees it, it’s Steve’s Audi, the one that Tony had gotten him for his trips into the city, the one that he wasn’t allowed to install FRIDAY on because Steve liked the quiet. Tony’s not sure what to think when he sees three other people in the car with Steve, he knew it was the time of the week when Steve checked on Nat, and usually dragged her to the house for dinner, but he really wasn’t expecting the two other people.
“They don’t really care, mainly because they leave around five so it’s only the student workers until we close.”
“No, no, no, whoa. Stop. Stop. Wait a sec. Hey, hey...,” they all yelled at him, they needed to think about this, and Thor rushing into doing it wasn’t the best plan they had.
“Ah, well that’s cool, usually the freshmen are too intimidated to take an upper level class so soon, some think that it’s too much too soon, most of the advisors try to keep them away too,” the guy said before sticking his hand out. “I’m Ty,” he said to Tony that smile plastered on his face.
Walking back into the room, he could see the look that Bucky was giving him, they hadn’t discussed anything about Steve liking Tony, but for all he knew it was because Steve hadn’t told him.
“Thanks,” he said not sure if his face was a completely different color, but it was sweet to hear.
“I wasn’t sure if I should have told you,” Tony continued his voice muffled by Steve’s chest, “I think I’ve been trying to keep myself from feeling it, but then you kissed me and I thought, well this is it, this is what I’ve been waiting for.”
“I don’t know it’s entirely up to him, but he’s trying to move on and it’s not my place to stop him, even if he has some rather self-destructive tendencies lately.”
“Fine, see if any of us help you again you fucking idiot,” Barnes yelled out before leaving the room, Tony quickly followed knowing that he had to apologize for Steve’s behavior, but before he could try Barnes shook his head and walked away.
“Damn, with the red-head,” Sam said and when Steve nodded, he cursed to himself. “You know she’s a Stark right, the only girl in the family and all that, I found out the other day, does Barnes know about that?”
“Okay, I get it,” he said but for some reason it felt nice to be taken care of by Steve. “Let’s see what our team found,” he yawned before point towards the door, “Onward my loyal steed.”
“It looks like we have another visitor,” Tony motioned to Carol who looked at them warily. “I honestly don’t know where she came from because last, I heard she had died in the nineties, but if Fury can find you then, I guess anything is possible.”
“Because he didn’t need you, or at least he thought he hadn’t needed you,” Steve said knowing just how much of this was truly his fault.
“I don’t mind at all Tony,” Steve said before pulling Tony out of the car and holding onto him. “Nope not at all.”
They were in and out of the flower shop, he knew that Tony wanted to ask a million questions, like whether Mr. Fury looked like his comic book counterpart, but since Mr. Fury was out of the shop at the moment, Steve was glad to be able to skip that question. Especially if it got around to why Fury had an eye patch, and how did a flower shop owner become the head of a super-secret organization.
“Started it,” Tony lied, he didn’t want Ty to know that he was struggling to start at all. “How’s yours coming along.”
“Not that it's a competition or anything, but Morgan said that she loves me 3000,” he said as he sat on the arm of the chair, putting his head on Steve’s. “You were somewhere on the low 6 to 900 scale.”
“Liar, you planned for me to be as close as possible to you and you know it,” Tony answered not missing the smirk on Steve’s face.
Sitting outside of Bucky and Tony’s room was the only surefire way of not having an angry Tony yelling at him again, or at least one that hopefully wouldn’t run away at the sight of him. Of course, he was surprised to see Tony and Bucky laughing as they walked towards him, he couldn’t help but feel a little bit of jealousy bubble up at the sight of the two of them together, but he squashed it. They barely knew one another so there was no reason to be jealous at all they barely knew each other, Steve couldn’t claim Tony’s affections, hell he hadn’t had a decent conversation with the guy. But from the times that he’s been in their room he’s become obsessed with the character that Tony had on the wall and wondered why he’d become so infatuated with its creator.
“Nat and Barnes, really,” he said thinking about Natasha and the Winter Soldier. “Do I even want to know how that happened.”
“Shit!” he said out loud.
“So, what does he want to see you about?” Ty asked smiling at him, attempting to get back into Tony’s good graces. “I bet it’s about that internship next spring, or that teaching assistant position that he was talking about.”
We have one particle left. Each. That's it, alright? We use that... Bye, bye. You're not going home,” Scott stopped rambling looking at them. They all knew the risks of trying this whole time heist thing.
“Yeah, whatever,” he said before walking away. He wasn’t going to stand there and listen to Natasha get on his case about his lack of skills when it came to dating, he had gotten by just fine in college and when he was in the army, so did they actually know.
“I was doing a thing,” Tony said as he slowly rose from the ground, the queasy feeling slowly abating, but he wished he had a mint or something because his mouth felt horrible. “The tale of Jonah.”
“He’s special,” Tony really was special to Steve in so many ways.
“Uhhmmm, okay,” Tony said before rolling over, quickly he stripped down to his boxers and his shirt before getting into the bed with Tony, “You smell like coffee.”
“I know what you’re thinking Tony,” Steve said as they all started to get into position. “The answer is no.”
“Yeah you wish,” she said turning towards the wall as well, but he knew that she was just messing with him.
“What did you guys do?”
“You weren’t supposed to die,” he whispered to no one, the slight smell of her flowers in the air, an overturned bottle of nail polish on the nightstand. Tony wondered if he had a sister growing up would she have been like Natasha, brave and fearless, but also kind and caring. He couldn’t help but hold the bottle, it was a part of an Avengers collection, and it was the same red as his armor.
“Tony,” Steve pulled him close as he said his name, wrapping his arms around Tony in a half hug that made his heart beat in a different way than the feeling he was having from the almost panic attack, it was good to have a distraction. “Maybe that event shaped your life, maybe it made you more wary of people, but it made you want to be who you are now, think of the things that you want to do in your life, of the things you have done.”
Honestly speaking, Tony just wanted to pass out at that moment, but his roommate was right, he barely had any decent meals since starting school, well outside of his lunches with Jan and Nat, so maybe some food would do him some good. All he did was nod at Bucky and grab the Junior ROTC sweater he had stolen from Rhodey, before his best friend had gone off to college. The thing was too large for Tony’s small frame, but it reminded him of his friend, so it was the best thing in the world. Of course, it went to Tony’s knees and he had to roll up the sleeves, because Rhodey is a giant compared to him, but it was what he needed at the moment.
"Bigger than his?” he said pointing at Steve and Tony’s house, pointing at where Tony had been standing.
“Yes, well it seems as if it wasn’t me who would get that dance in the first place, and while I had loved you once, I did find the man I was meant to be with thanks to you, so I can’t fault you for anything.”
“What’s on your mind?” Steve said trying to stop the train of thought going through his mind right at that moment. He didn’t want to live through another misunderstanding like the one they had had the week before.
“I guess that I had some kind of epiphany that day,” Steve told him with a small smile on his face. “We may never move on from what happened, but I’m almost certain that they would be angry with us if we didn’t at least try.”
“Pepper did,” Steve answered with a smile.
“With my life,” Steve said to Tony, pulling his hand close to his heart.
“Get to work,” Steve said pushing him forward.
“1-9-7-0,” he said with a smile.
“We start at the beginning... well without accidentally creating a murderbot,” he said heading over to the holoscreen that held all of their notes that they had collected about the mind stone, from before Vision came to be, even some that Tony had gotten from him after he had come to life. He wondered if there was a way to make everything work. Pulling up the notes from the element that had once powered his heart and working on calculations about the powers of the stone, Tony and Bruce worked on every calculation they could think about. Nothing was working, and Tony knew that Bruce was a little frayed at that point. The battle of New York felt like a million years ago, that first conversation in the lab when they were on the helicarrier, everything felt like a horrible dream that led to this.
The rest of the day was filled with Shuri and him pouring over hours and hours of notes that he had collected with Bruce, notes that thankfully hadn’t been erased when Ultron had taken over his systems. They went over everything Tony knew about the element that his father had left behind in the diorama of the Stark Expo, they went through everything she knew about Vibranium as well as the raw version of it that he had brought with from space.
Tony knew that it was a joke but they needed that stone, they needed Vision, and mostly he needed to hear that something was going right for once, “Think we could make one,” he said knowing that it was a long shot, but he had been thinking about finding a way to synthesize something for Vision. “I mean, I did create an element in the basement of my Malibu house so who knows what we’re capable of right now.”
“You promise to bring that back in one piece, right?” Rocket said to Clint who was holding the shrunken down Benatar in his hand.
“Yeah but I saw how your last relationship went, I could kill that evil wretch, but I let it go,” she said, and Tony knew how protective Natasha was of him, no one messed with her baby brother, no matter how many months apart in age they were. “I just want you to be happy.”
The rest of the week went about the same way, he was either with Rhodey at the Rhodes house, or spoiling Pepper and May, by taking them out to dinner. He wanted them to have a good break, but also it kept him from being too lonely. Jarvis and Ana came to the house on Saturday and they baked all kinds of treats for Tony to take back with him. He hadn’t seen anyone else even when they had driven him back to school the next morning, Natasha had called and said that Jan and her were coming back late, something about the flight being delayed because of weather, so in the end he was actually alone on the way up. The car smelled like cookies and home, but if he were being honest, he really just wanted to see Steve again.
“I’m going to kill him when he wakes up later,” Tony mumbled to himself, he knew that Barnes had heard him, but honestly Tony didn’t care at that moment. “He knew that we were up there dealing with this and of course the asshole takes the shot for me, so I’m going to kill him.”
Tony had only been thinking about sleeping that night, but he knew that this project was huge compared to the first one. “Sure,” he said knowing that another sleepless night awaited him.
“There’s my little girl,” Steve said to her as he picked her up. “Where are your siblings, they were supposed to be with you.”
“Maybe the one in Wakanda changed its molecular makeup when it came into the Earth’s atmosphere,” he said thinking of what could have made the metal so different here on Earth then the one they had found in Knowhere.
“No, it’s nothing like that, he just always saw the differences in the two of us, things that had been clouded for me because I only saw everything one way where as my dad saw everything at every angle, he had told me that one day Bucky was going to break my heart, and we fought over it and all, but he said that I had to make my own choices and let it go. The break-up happened, and I finally saw what my dad did,” Steve sighed as he told the story, Tony wasn’t sure if he was ready to hear any of it mainly because he was sure that Steve was still in love with Bucky. “And what my dad had seen was the fact that even though we had grown up together we both changed, we liked different things, like Buck likes to go out, you hear about him taking your sister out all of the time, but I prefer to be at home and watch movies. Buck is more of a free spirit in a way, he needs someone who moves like he does.”
“He’s a baby now,” Steve said looking at the drooling infant in front of him.
With the help of Barnes and Thor, they had Steve set up in Tony’s room, his legs set up on a special pillow that Tony had JARVIS order to be delivered the moment they got back to the tower, all the while Steve was grumbling about being stuck in bed. Out of all of them, Steve was the most active person, if he wasn’t in the gym, he was drawing, at SHIELD or with Tony doing a number of things. The things he did with Tony varied depending on their mood, and how tired Steve was trying to make Tony just to get him to stop thinking enough to go to bed. But and injured Steve was a monster, he yelled and screamed at those who tried to help he, but Tony knew it had more to do with his life before the serum and not the actual injuries he had sustained.
“Holy shit, the rumors are true,” Bucky said from the door, holding his laundry bag, which was full of Bucky’s clean clothes, courtesy of his Bucky’s mom. “Dude, that’s Tony Stark, shit my roommate is Tony Stark.”
“I’m the only one in my family that’s not adopted, Thor and Loki are brothers and their parents had been friends with my parents when they died so of course my parents adopted them, after that Clint came along, and then my mom wanted a girl so they adopted my sister only to find out they had finally conceived so I was raised as an almost twin to my sister.”
“Hand over the case, Stark,” the agent next to Pierce said and Tony knew that this was just Hydra trying to get a hold of something that they could use to create those phase two weapons.
“I don’t know if I could, I mean one of the people who was with us on Titan had the time stone, which I heard was the reason why everything went sideways over here, and I thought about how if we had just used it we could have changed the fight in our favor, but now there’s no way of knowing, and honestly I wouldn’t know if I would change anything if it ended up messing with the space time continuum.”
She looked at him as if evaluating his words before nodding. “You’re going to be good for him, especially if you feed him regularly.”
“Enough, I just want to make sure that you take care of each other if you’re going to do this,” she told him. “I don’t want something to happen to either of you, it would devastate those kids, but I also know how badly either of you would take it.”
“Yeah well I don’t like holes in my walls, Thor buddy, we’ve talked about this,” Tony said wheeling himself over to the hole to inspect the damage, Steve with an exasperated look on his face, let him go.
“There's fewer ships, cleaner water, I wish Morgan would have been there, she would have loved to see it, Tony would probably tell her a million things about whales, I would draw them together, and we would go home after seeing something so amazing, all the while Morgan would be talking a mile a minute, all excited about the whole thing.”
“Yeah!” Scott answered and it took everything in his power not to hit the other man, supersoldier or not, Steve wanted to punch the guy for making Tony take the blame for something that wasn’t his fault.
“Did you know that Tony Stark come here almost every day,” he heard someone whispering, but Steve knew that it had to be a lie, there was no way that someone like Tony Stark could show up in a place like this.
“You didn’t have to run here,” Tony said even though he was secretly happy, because for a moment he felt like the world was closing in on him. Even with the lights on the paths it still felt too dark near where he was standing.
“Oh, good you’re awake,” Steve said as he opened the door, he was wearing a new pair of cotton pajamas, but they were riding pretty low on his hips, giving Tony a good view of the V of Steve’s pelvis, and if he wasn’t so worn out he would have jumped on him again. “I brought dinner.”
“No, you need to talk to him, you need family time Steve, I know the risks of doing this more than anyone else, and I know for certain that you and him have a lot on the line if we do end up doing this.”
“No, I’m pretty sure he’s dead,” Rhodey added.
“Look, us sitting here staring at that thing is not gonna bring everybody back. I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So, this responsibility falls upon me. It's my duty,” Thor answered, and Tony knew this was more for the man to make amends to himself for what happened five years ago.
“Time travel suit?” Rhodes said as Steve walked over to join the others. Steve saw the suit that Scott was wearing, it was designed by Tony, using the same nano particles as Tony’s Iron Man suit, so that they would be able to change into any outfit that would be needed where they were going. It was durable, but it also conformed to the suits that they all normally wore. “Not bad, though the color could be different.”
“Uh.... Howard,” he said and almost wanted to smack himself, he couldn’t think of anything else, his father was standing in front of him, the man who hadn’t paid any attention to him growing up, who loved Steve more than his own son.
Tony didn’t hear back from Steve before Thanksgiving break started, mainly because both of them had been mostly busy, Steve had his test though he had also texted Tony that he had a few shifts to work at Starbucks before he left for the weekend. He thanked him several times in those messages as well, and Tony had been over the moon just from a few messages. Tony on the other hand had to start on the welding for his bot, as well as the wiring for the artificial intelligence that would make it a learning robot.
“If you’re proposing, the answer is yes,” Tony said to him with a huge smile.
“You think that’s bad try going through one,” Bruce said looking pointily at Tony as he dry heaved, the taste of vomit still in his mouth even with the rinse.
“Tony.... TOOONNNNYYYYY,” she called out, and he could hear the giggling from Nat’s roommate, their childhood friend Jan, which meant that they were going to torture him and never allow him his nap.
“Take it I don’t give a damn,” he said as he packed everything up, he was fed up with the whole semester, it was ending horribly and now this was just the icing on the damn cake.
He hadn’t realized that Bucky had left until the door swung open and a guy came in carrying a box full of stuff, while mumbling to himself about how hard the mattress was, and how he didn’t get any sleep because of it. Steve, being who he is because his mother taught him manners, helped the guy by taking the box out of his hands.
“Well let's hope that the post brings in more people,” he said pushing his thoughts and their conversation aside.
“What's in New Jersey?” Scott asked but Tony instead started rambling to himself before turning his attention to the little machine that was guiding their way through time.
“Only by a couple of months Nat.”
“Tony,” Professor Coulson called out as everyone left, for some this was their last class and they could go home, some others still had classes to finish, Tony wasn’t envious of any of them, he had finished everything and then some, all the while going through some really crazy things. His life had been a roller coaster of emotions just the last few weeks alone.
“I wasn’t going to drive back just to pick you up Buck, I’m not your god damned chauffer and you know it,” Steve told Bucky, but he knew it would have fallen on deaf ears because Bucky had started snoring not long afterwards. Kicking the chair and forcing his friend to wake up, he couldn’t help but wonder why this was the way his morning was going. “Just go back to the dorms.”
“Yeah, they’re on one of the screens,” Bruce said pointing towards the mixture of screens all around them, “but I’ve been looking at everything for so long and nothing makes any sense, so I really don’t know where to start.”
“Yes, and honestly I don’t know where to start Big Green, I really don’t know,” he sighed before sitting in the chair next to Bruce. “When I had to get here, when it was just me and Nebula, there was a million things to worry about, a million things to do, and now I feel a little lost about where I should start.”
“If it’s not too much trouble,” Steve had asked him for help with studying for his final exam. Tony saw it as another way for them to hang out together, but also as another way to focus his energy on something else, anything else.
Out of one of the portals, Doctor Strange steps forward, and from the looks of it those who had perished on Titan five years before stood next to him. Steve couldn’t help but smile when Spiderman landed next to Kamala, while his son stood stunned as he saw the Iron Spider armor that Tony had told him about.
Bucky came back, freshly showered and dressed, before dragging Natasha out the door, he was taking her to dinner, nothing fancy, which she liked. “It’s nice to not have to worry about a guy trying to impress me too much,” she told him as they made their way out the door. “I’ll see you later,” she called out as Bucky took her outside.
“Clearly you’re not fine Nat, and neither is Clint apparently,” he said to her, sitting down in front of her, wondering if there would be a day when they would all have to intervene. “You know I saw a pod of whales when I was coming up the bridge,” he was trying to get her to lighten up a little, to let go even more, so inane conversations were the best way to go at this moment.
“Yeah, well if we don’t try, then no one else is going home either,” Steve told him, he knew he couldn’t fix this, but he had to try for Tony’s sake.
“All we did was kiss nothing else,” Tony said in his defense.
“It’s not, I’ve seen how happy she is, well at least the little amount of time I’ve seen her, I’ve been a little busy.”
Riri went into the house to set up the movie, Kamala following behind while she talked animatedly about school. From what he’s heard, she was very happy there in her first semester. Tony was certain that she would do so much more than she thought she was capable of and he was happy to hear that she was happy.
“Okay, so Iron Man’s other personality is a mixture of my life and my family’s business, or at least what it used to be, when we still sold weapons, and from there I created a kidnapping where his kidnappers wanted him to build this weapon with this insane destructive capability,” Tony knew that he was rambling, but he rarely got to tell anyone this side of the story, even his readers had expressed more interest in the relationship between Captain America and Iron Man, or when would Iron Man reveal his identity. So, because of this, Tony had kept Iron Man’s origin story to himself, but hearing Steve’s interest in it, he just wanted to spill on everything. “I mean it could wipe out a whole mountain range, anyway the day of the kidnapping a bomb exploded next to him and the bomb embedded pieces of shrapnel into his chest, even the bulletproof vest he was wearing wasn’t enough to stop them.”
“Well considering Steve is standing in front of me at this moment, I would say you may have a story to tell, but not one I’m supposed to know.”
That was the day that Tony brought a tired Kamala Khan back to the lake house, and fed her enough of Steve’s cookies that she passed out on the table smiling. Even after eating so many burgers she had happily ate more, almost like she was afraid that she wouldn’t eat again afterwards. When she was comfortable being there with them, she realized that she had the chance for a home once again, and that made Tony very proud.
Steve reached out for the jar that said Peter Parker, Tony’s protégée, the kid from Queens, the one he had fought against without hesitation thinking he was just another adult. “Do you think that Tony brought these with him to bury them? Or did he hope that they would come back?”
“Hey,” Ty said as everyone left packed up to leave. “I work in the library most nights, so if you want to come over and brainstorm, you can keep me company,” it was nice to make a friend the first day of the class, especially since he was a freshman, at least in their eyes.
“It’s just something I invented, though it’s not as strong as the one I gave you earlier,” Steve told him with a shrug. “I want to make sure you go to sleep after this.”
“It’s in the past,” Steve said before pulling Tony away. “I’m going to show Tony something upstairs, so call if you need anything.”
This is the shortest chapter I've written
“You got it in one,” he answered slowly rubbing his side, it hurt like a bitch, but he was going to have to deal with it.
“She’s been sneaking into the garage, last week I caught her grabbing one of your prototypes,” Steve said as they walked into the kitchen. “Maybe we should lock the workshop when we’re sleeping.”
“Tony, this is Bruce,” Thor said proudly, his chest puffed out, like he’s was showing off. “Bruce, my darling, this is my baby brother Tony.”
That’s if they had a second date and Tony didn’t die of embarrassment from telling the guy that he had wanted to climb him like a freaking tree. Maybe he could finally invent time travel and go back and stop himself from doing anything so embarrassing ever again. He wondered if it was too late to become a monk somewhere in Asia and disappear for the rest of his life.
“It’s a thank you,” he said to him before they walked back into the night, he wasn’t sure if a water would be a good repayment, after being angry at him when they first met but it was a start. “Hey can I ask you a question.”
It didn’t take long for them to sit there in silence, just watching the stars in the sky, Tony often wondered what it would be like to see them up close, but he wasn’t going to be an astronaut, he didn’t have it in him to leave his life behind like that. Plus, he wouldn’t have met Steve if he had actually tried, and that on its own was worth it. He wanted to change the world, but on his own merit. Those were things to think about after he from graduated college, in the future, which wasn’t going to happen for a long time. He wanted to cherish what he had before responsibilities plagued him at every turn.
“I brought some tea as you suggested Mr. Rogers,” Jarvis the butler said, walking in with the tray in his hand. Steve automatically stood up to help the older man, he looked like he was his grandmother’s age, he wondered why the man was still working.
“Did you ever find your right one?” he asked just out of curiosity.
Unfortunately, when Scott came back the second them, he was an old man “Ow! My back!” Scott said which only made Hope laugh even harder than she had before. Shuri snorted next to her causing Bruce to start laughing too.
“Yes, it’s very low maintenance too, so all you would have to do is sit back and relax.”
“That would be great,” Steve said sighing in relief.
“Potts,” he said hoping the word came out clearly enough and not too slurred.
He heard Thor before he saw him, which was hard considering Thor towered over all of them, but Thor picked him up and swung him around. “There you are,” Thor said before putting Tony on the ground. “Come, I need to introduce you to my boyfriend.”
“Is this where Iron Man came from,” Steve was amazed that something his father had made had changed so much in someone else's life. “You wanted Cap to have a sidekick or something.”
Before Tony could say anything, Steve walked towards where the water was and grabbed a bottle, chugging it as he walked towards the register, Tony paid for the water before Steve could pull out his wallet.
“Vision, keep an eye on them, we’ll give you all some time,” Steve said as he slowly stood up.
“Hot Tub Time Machine,” Scott said.
“Some of them aren’t my best work, others were just outlines but... um,” he said looking down at Tony’s eyes, even with his glasses on they were the most beautiful eyes in the world to Steve, and the one thing that had haunted him all weekend. “There’s a lot of you in these pages, I wanted to talk to you so much that I just started drawing your face the way I remembered.”
“It’s a lot to take in, especially after the past couple of weeks,” the roller coaster of him and Steve getting together, Ty using him not only for help with his story but to also further his family’s standing, being alone on Thanksgiving even though Rhodey, Pepper, and May came to visit.
“Shit,” he said reminding himself of the family he had, the little girl who was about to lose her father.
Clint’s kids lived on the land, Clint oftentimes taking missions to work off his anger, leaving the kids with Steve and Tony, which they were okay with. Their weekends filled with sleepovers, and friends stopping by. Shuri joining them, which Steve knew was the best thing for her, because she needed moments where the weight of an entire country was not riding on her shoulders. Nebula oftentimes came with Duranna who saw Tony as an Uncle who gave her interesting things, Nebula always looked at peace when she was around Tony and the kids, like she had found her place after everything.
“Not a bit, but I figure if you’re as far away from the workshop, he can’t come after you until we finish what we’re doing,” he told her before giving her a hug. “No go and stay with them, I know that Kamala and Miles are up to something, and I love you all but I also don’t trust you to not get into trouble here. You’re the oldest, keep them all out of trouble.”
“You’re good with them,” Steve had told him, after the war had ended in all five of them covered in paint and DUM-E spraying them with the fire extinguisher. “You gave them all a family, you became my family.”
They did have dinner at the dining hall, talking for two hours, getting caught up on what they did over the summer, Jan had gone to Europe with her parents, while Tony and Nat had spent it in the Hamptons on the beach. They talked about their classes, and both girls constantly reminded Tony that he needed to get out more and stay away from writing all of the time, he humored them but, in the end, he knew that he would keep writing. He was a triple major in some ways, he was working on his Ph.D. in mechanical engineering and programming, while getting a B.A. in writing. He had already tested out of most of his classes because he had taken a lot of his college courses while in high school, he hadn’t needed the prerequisite courses at all, so all he needed to do was concentrate on his degrees, he had a set schedule for everything so he needed to stay on track for that. He couldn’t have a relationship, even a crush wasn’t optional, it was the only rule he was going to give himself, because he was afraid of someone hurting him again.
He wanted to grumble, he knew that even if they brought everyone back, if they changed everything, it would create more problems than any of them could think about. But in his heart, he still wanted to bring Peter back for May, to bring Laura back for Clint, T’Challa for Shuri, Bucky and Sam for Steve and Natasha. Who had surprised him when he had heard about her past with the Winter Soldier, a past that hadn’t come true for them. They all needed something, but for the Avengers, they needed their family back.
Tony watched as his other self, dropped the case and falls to the ground, he knows how much it hurts when the reactor isn’t working properly, or was actively trying to kill you. He remembered the one time it had been taken out forcefully and he hated his former godfather for the pain he had put him through. Ignoring the scene in front of him, he slowly walked forward as Scott pushed the case forward, as if it were normal for it to move like that after it had fallen.
“That Time Stone guy....” Natasha said breaking the silence in the room.
“It hurt that’s what that feel like,” Tony said running his hand, never really taking his eyes off of Steve, probably thinking of how to retaliate. “But yeah, it felt real.”
When the door closed them in, the lights on, and DUM-E and U in their charging stations, Tony turned to look at him, and all Steve could see was heartbreak.
“That’s a conversation for another day,” Natasha said her eyes looking at picture after picture of everyone they’ve confirmed to be dead, she wanted to stop him from saying any more, but the guilt had been building up for weeks along with the anger that he had been holding in against Thanos. “Right now, we just have to worry about how to reverse the effects of what Thanos did, and if you can help that’s fine by us, if not I don’t really care.”
Before Tony could keep going Steve took his hand before leaning over and kissing the genius on the lips for the second time since they met. It was soft, and tentative, but it made it feel real to Steve. Before pulling away he pinched Tony’s hand causing Tony to yelp out at the pain.
“Well in some ways she’s actually a daddy’s girl,” his mother said with a smile on her face. “When your brothers came to us, your father was still gruff, he worked too hard, but the boys made him more willing to change, plus the board liked that he was a father and not a playboy, hell they thought he was cheating on me at one point.”
Now though, Tony was going to use it to punish Steve for taking that hit for him, and since the medication would have Steve out long enough for Tony to put it in him and restrain him, he was really going to do it. He wasn’t as pissed off as he had been the other day, blame too much time on paperwork, hell at this point he just want relief himself. Before the fight, they hadn’t had sex in nearly a month. Steve had SHIELD things to do, Tony had a conference, they had several battles in between, and of course Tony had to finish the specs for the next generation of Stark phones. It wasn’t that he didn’t do his S.I. work, it’s just that he ignored the paperwork.
“There’s that too,” Steve said as he parked at the diner. “The town is small, but we’re not too far from Main Street, this is just the best diner in my little corner of the world.”
“You have something on your mind,” Tony said pulling his husband away from what was happening. “Tell me.”
“Well... there are somethings that happened over the last few weeks, other than that who misunderstanding with Steve, and it just feels like writing isn’t in my blood after all.”
It was a reminder that Steve still had work to do, even when he was sure that he would never be able to hold onto that shield again. The weight of what it represents hurts him more than anything, the fact that he had hurt the man he loved with it made it even worse. He sometimes wondered if he were fit to be a hero after everything that had happened, but it wasn’t a concern that he voiced out loud to anyone. But Tony understood, Tony who had gone through the worse of his depression with Steve anchoring him had told him that he was worthy of the shield, that he should forgive himself because Tony had forgiven him. So that one of the biggest reasons why he ran the meetings, he was learning to forgive himself for what had happened.
“And yours does?”
“How was that a win?” Steve said, his voice hitting a register that was normally saved for when either Tony or the kids did something stupid.
“Also, you have to stay in that bed for the rest of the day,” Rhodey said which made him groan. “I know you hate it, but the Hulk broke two of your ribs, and while I know that you think that you’re invincible Tones, you’re not so stay put.”
“Yeah well being a hero isn’t exactly a nine to five job,” he said but she threw a pencil at him and he knew that he had to resign to his fate at the moment.
“What’s on your mind,” she said, and he knew that it had everything to do with the fact that he had been sleeping and looked near death with exhaustion. This time it wasn’t the equations running through his head, but the story that he couldn’t write. He did every other project but that one, because he wasn’t sure of whether it would be good enough. Ty had really done a number on him, hell the failure from Professor Coulson had rattled him as well.
“Are we really going to try this?” Bruce said skepticism in his voice. “Because honestly it sounds crazy, hell when I told Thor where I was going and what we were thinking of doing he just laughed in my face.”
“Nat...”
“It’s the same and yet different at the same time,” she said as she broke it down and went over it piece by piece. “I don’t understand why though.”
“Put her on,” he said, the girls squealing from the other side of the house, which made him worry, but he would put that aside for later.
“Really,” she said her face lighting up, “I thought he had a crush on Bucky our first semester here, so I tried not to look his way.”
Steve couldn’t help but feel powerless over everything, he had moved on with Tony, they had all tried to move on, some better than others it seems, which made Steve wonder just how much him and Tony had missed in the last five years if Clint is out there going after bad guys, and Nat is working herself to death because of her guilt.
“Geez how did he get that,” Steve said and Tony knew that he had him hooked on this, even though he’s never told anyone, the creation of Iron Man comes from one of those times that Tony had been kidnapped, Tony used his own life as a part of his character, the kidnapping from when he was six especially, because he remembered having nightmares for years over it.
“No, it’s just that the only really good Chinese place is on the other side of town, and there was a huge line tonight,” Steve said to him before kissing Tony on the cheek. “Only the best for you.”
The surprised look in all of their eyes was enough for him to grab the scepter and walk off without another word. He couldn’t smile, even if he wanted to, because he had just screwed over his other self in this timeline.
“Yes Pete, we will be, just let me get through this first, and you guys can join us in the back yard later,” Steve answered, hopefully Tony wouldn’t mind the extra guests, but when he looked over at his boyfriend... was he Tony’s boyfriend... he wasn’t sure about the whole thing since they hadn’t really talked about it, but he hoped that this was something Tony had thought about? There would be time to answer all of that later on.
“Not entirely,” he smiled back. “I just figured that maybe we needed some time away, do something that didn’t involve being Captain America and Iron Man, to find our way after losing so much.”
“I was kidnapped a few times when I was a kid,” he said or at least he knew that the words had come, but he had never talked with anyone about it, the only person who knew all of the details was his therapist Ho Yinsen. He could see the surprise in Steve’s eyes, there was no looking back from revealing this much of himself to someone. “But the last time it happened, it was a horrible day overall, I was being driven to school by one of the drivers we had at the time, Nat was at home sick, she had the flu, so I was alone with just the driver. We were stopped at a light, and for some reason there hadn’t been any cars around us, I know now that that should have been a huge red flag, but then a bomb went off and the driver head had been blown up all over the seat,” he could feel his heart starting to race, he was going to have a panic attack if he didn’t stop talking about this, but for some reason he wanted someone to know, he wanted a person who wasn’t paid to know, to well understand why he was the way he was.
At his words Tony jolted out of his arms and looked at him with a serious expression, “Tell me you’re not lying to me right now? Tell me Steve.”
“Define lunch or be disintegrated,” she said to him, and he knew that she spent way too much time with her sisters.
“So, now that I’ve told you my part, you have to tell me yours,” he said trying to change his thought pattern just enough, at least to steer away from the fact that he might never get his chance with Tony if the other guy was someone Tony really liked.
“Really? Were you looking for it?”
“You know Tony, no one asked you to look,” Steve said to him over the com line.
Steve didn’t tell Bucky about it, he didn’t want Bucky overreacting over Tony being uncomfortable, because if there was one thing that Steve knew was that his best friend had always been overprotective of him. Not so much anymore, but when they were kids and Steve had been sick a lot, Bucky had always protected him, even when Steve got into fights with bullies three times his size. It wouldn’t matter that Tony was his roommate, if Steve was offended Bucky would fight anyone. And this wasn’t what he wanted to happen because it wasn’t Tony’s fault that it had happened, if he thought about it, well it was mostly Bucky’s fault but, in the end, Steve could only blame himself.
Tony looks from person to person, his team, eyes finally landing on Natasha, who is staring steadily back. "So," he lets out shakily. "Separate but equal here? That's the game plan."
"Already here," a voice calls from above, and Tony rolls his eyes as Daredevil makes a dramatic leap from the rafters to the floor below him, right between Tony and Cage. Cage takes another step back, hands coming up into fists, and Tony hops off his perch.
"We've all been selfish, Tony. That market was cornered long before built yourself a walking soup can." She lets go of his elbow to bring her legs up and cross them Indian-style, fully facing him now. "Listen to me. You don't really believe that. You're just scared," she tells him firmly.
"And it's not your fault," Tony says. "I get it, kid, I do, believe me. It feels like you missed something, but you didn't. There is nothing else you could've done. You were Spider-Man, you saved the day, you did exactly what you have charged yourself to do. You didn't let anyone down. You are not responsible for what happened to him. Come on, say it to me. I don't mind if you don't believe it yet, kid, just say it out loud, at least once. For yourself. It wasn't your fault."
"And we've all seen how good you are at that." Bruce's shadows are distorted from the streetlight slanting in through the windows. It feels like there are hundreds of him in here with just one Tony.
Bucky was looking at him a bit strangely. "Well, it was for the good of their people, weren't it? He didn't let love get in the way of what was right. They had principles and they stuck to 'em. I like that. 'D like to think we wouldn't murder each other, though. Maybe just have a nice long sit-down about it."
"You boys going to rejoin the land of us mortal creatures anytime soon?" Laura Barton calls, her voice faint where she is obviously leaning close to someone else's comm. "Roast should be just about ready."
"Are you okay?"
because you keep him locked up in the basement eighty percent of the time like he's going to snap at any moment!" Tony cringes at that; he hasn't been keeping Donnie away, he's been keeping him safe. If anyone came to the compound and saw the unknown Inhuman wandering around it would raise too many questions. "And you were slow in Manitoba, don't think I didn't notice, but you're probably not going to ask T'Challa how best to manipulate vibranium because-"
Steve watches the black and gold suit shoot across the screen. The new suit is dark, more boxy, and far more frightening than the red and gold was. Or maybe that's because its less familiar. Colder. Darker. There's no central arc reactor, no bright glowing heart anymore and it makes Steve ache. If Tony had been wearing this suit in Siberia it never would have ended.
"What about Donnie?" Kamala asks, and Clint looks to Tony because he had asked the same thing. "And Ms. Hope? King T'Challa?"
"I honestly can't say, Councilman," Tony replies, determinedly not looking at T'Challa, who has been burning a hole in the side of his head this entire time.
," Tony grinds out. "But you know I'm telling the truth. He needs the BARF system. He doesn't get that without me. So
stark is still a grade-a asshole but he's doing okay by me. just stay steve please. i've gotta give the phone back now.
"Will BARF be a threat to Barnes?" Natasha wants to know, eyes flicking across the screen, and Bruce shakes his head.
Carol Danvers beams at him, shaking the hand she hasn't let go more vigorously. "That's fantastic, Mr. Stark. Would you consider an early release to the Veterans Affairs? I know a lot of soldiers who -"
"Fury playing human chess always amuses me when I'm not on the board. But you see, in this case, I think I kind of am. And I'm pretty sure I'm not even one of the fancy pieces. That hurts me."
"Consider me the collective Plus One," Clint replies easily enough. "Besides, I hear HYDRA's making this open-invitation."
"And what does that world look like?" he asks lowly, remembering he's on a mission here. He has to protect his friends - all of them. "You said they were running out of time. You said your daughter had powers, given by terrigenesis. HYDRA has always wanted an army, but this is desperate, even for you. Why this, why now? What's going to happen?"
Everyone's fine cap. We have it covered. We'll call if we need you.
Peter stares hard at him. "Get that changed, Mr. Stark. Seriously, it's messed up. I'll go on trial, probation, whatever, but jail - no way. I'm trying to help."
He faces Vision head on. "I used to think she died instantly. The coroner's report said the whiplash killed my mom on impact. But now I know that she died
"Yeah. Well, sort of. If some of what he said is true and I catch you saying it to him again we'll be having much unkinder words. But this lone wolf stuff he pulls, it drives me crazy. It's not necessary. He's had me and Janet and Pep for years now and we'll always be there for him. Now, he has you and the rest of the Avengers, too. He needs to see that. And he, man, he idolized you as a kid, but he
“How old are you?”
craftsmanship. Then the day came that I had to face them head on and I finally saw the truth of it. All those bodies...you couldn't even recognize some of those boys. It was too far. So I ran, and then I kept running. Nearly died on some train tracks until a kindly sheriff came and rescued me. And I thought 'Stark, this here's the man you always wished you could be.' I'd-a followed you into the dust, Rogers."
"I'm sorry to have missed that," Steve said, and he genuinely was.
Her lip curls up, half pleased and half sneer. "It is beautiful. But it could be better. Your blood, Captain, could help your people achieve perfection."
"That's not a no," she says, then sighs. "This is going to be so
Fuck his pain, and fuck soulmates. It wasn't like they had always led perfect lives either. Just look at Brutus and Caesar. They'd destroyed each other for love.
But for realsies, this chapter was stupid hard to get out and I'm still not happy with it. Kamala has a lot on her plate so lets let her get settled before we do anything.
If Steve wanted to compromise he would be here. Tony wasn't chasing after him anymore. Steve could have fought for himself instead of fighting Tony, but he didn't. "The Accords are at your disposal, T'Challa" is all he's willing to offer.
how much the Avengers were worth."
His heart is very abruptly in his throat. Tony tries not to choke on it, the useless thing. "He left it with me."
"I am not a sucker, Harley and I have a connection," Tony blusters, feeling caught out. Vision smiles as he seats himself in the chair opposite. "They're just...tough, these kids. Tougher than me at that age. Hell, tougher than me now."
"I do not," Vision says, immeasurably sad. "I do not know if that's good or bad. I know that all I would dream of would be her."
be correct."
Rhodey sits, curiously ungainly in his braces. "No. You weren't making a peep. You weren't moving either. Stiff as a board, like rigor mortis. Freaked me the hell out, man, my muscles were tense just looking at you. You alright?"
"Vision is on the council right now," Wanda says softly, holding her hand out to look at Hope van Dyne's Accords. "That's one of the rules, yes? One of the Avengers must always be on the council.
Jan shook her head. “He’ll figure it out on his own.” At her friends’ dubious looks she pouted. “He will. Tony’s been trying really hard with Steve lately, and I know Steve’s noticed. It can’t all be for nothing. They’ll work it out.”
So, I never said this at the time, but way back yonder in this story when Steve decided to leave Bucky, the only real safe haven he had left, to go with Fury because he knew there were people out there that needed to be helped - I thought that was really brave of him (is that pretentious to say when I'm the one writing him?) I thought that it would ring true to his character that even when completely lost personally, doing good was intrinsic to him. But I think CACW showed a real loss of identity to Steve, and this was him forcefully reclaiming it for himself. Is it natural yet, no, because it didn't happen to him naturally. But this, in my mind, is a real turning point for his character and the first step of the climax to Act 1 of this story.
Then be better. That's how you know you're still one of the good ones.
“Oh, I doubt that. Deaf in one ear, innit he? I could shout the house down and he wouldn’t hear.”
It was worth a try.
"Even if its not Fury, can we afford to let whoever Cloak is working for wander around wreaking havoc? There are bigger things at work here, Wanda, and we can't be left in the dark again. We need to know what they are."
"D," Dagger huffs over the comms, that mix of fondness and disdain that seems near permanent whenever she speaks to Diamondback. "Running commentary. Really necessary?"
"The Avengers aren't like that," Bruce says shortly.
"Oh, is that so? And how long will this deferrence last?" Tony laughs, because its ridiculous to think that Natasha won't do whatever she wants no matter how stupid Tony and/or Steve are being. He's witnessed it firsthand. But even he can recognize when its time to let the past lie, and when to accept the open hand given to him. "Like the old man said. It's the only way."
Tony gathers up his papers, slides the phone closer to Barnes, and after a moment's consideration drags it back, opening up the contacts screen and thumbing in a new number. "Now you've got me as well," he says, and reaches out with it across the small table to Barnes.
Steve shoves that thought far, far down. Nothing's lost here, nothing that can't be regained. Even Tony will one day forgive him, even Bucky will one day come out of cryo. There's nothing here that can't be fixed, there's nothing here that can't be fixed. He just has to be certain and true. One foot in front of the other, from the time he was little, sick and frail. If he stopped moving, if he stood still, Fate would finally catch him.
There are seven of them standing in the small pavilion. Steve and Sam, wrapped up in their uniforms and gear; Wanda, small and worried in a sweater and sleep pants; T'Challa, wearing the claw necklace of Wakandan royalty; his sister Shuri, a brilliant scientist fiddling with her gear and her two assistants helping her work. This is the only agreement T'Challa would accept after Steve informed him of Cloak's visit, the phone, and his intentions to rejoin the fight. Cloak must arrive at the appointed time with Director Fury and must allow his powers to be measured by Shuri so that Wakanda could develop a countermeasure to prevent him from ever getting inside their borders again. Fury had agreed without a fuss over the phone, too smug at having Captain America at his side again even if Steve wouldn't be wearing his present uniform for a long time.
Peter doesn't respond for nearly half a minute. Tony gives in.
In that moment, he had only himself, and it was enough. He built a model from the data; if the universe wouldn't give him a future, he'd make his own. He'd apply to MIT again next year, and next year he'd get in. He'd graduate, he'd take over Stark, and he'd change the world right under his father's nose. And they would fall over their feet to praise him while he laughed at them the whole time. He'd never love them back. He'd never care. See how they liked it.
"So that's why?"
Tony tilts his head back in the helmet and doesn't fight the hysterical laughter.
Sam broke first. “Maybe we should-“
He holds her tighter.
She swallowed past the lump in her throat, thinking of five years spent sleeping next to a ghost.
This chapter is a two-parter, and the other should be up much quicker than this one came, that's for damn sure. Thank you all once again!
it, okay, will all present who have never had their heads messed with please raise their hands? I think, what, we're down to Vision and Rhodey? You should form a club! I get how not-guilty Barnes is. I nearly killed the guy, I am painfully aware of how much say he had in doing any of it. But it's all still there, in his head; I asked him if he remembered them, you know what he said?" Nat's head shake is more of a flinch, but Tony is past caring. "He said 'I remember all of them.' It's not like the power of friendship and Steve's halo magically cured him! The thing that killed my parents, that killed hundreds, is still sitting pretty right there in Barnes' frontal lobe. Steve wasn't fighting for the Accords, he wasn't even fighting for Bucky Barnes. You think he even once asked that kid what he wanted to do? No. He was fighting for that
Bruce shoots a confused glare at Tony over his shoulder. "Contract?" he asks at the same time that Tony tells T'Challa that "He's not signing, highness. We've already talked."
"Let him in, FRIDAY," Tony authorizes, and the band lights up.
"One and only," Fury says, turning to Sam and Steve. "We've got your rooms ready; settle in for the night and be ready for debrief in the morning, 0800. No arguments, Captain."
"Are you-" His words are mangled, barely there, but Tony will be damned if this man hears him stutter. "Are you agreeing to the trial?"
(”I used to think I was going to destroy you,” Tony had whispered to him one night. “I’d tell myself that I couldn’t possibly.”
We are in the workshop, and he is angry because I’ve implied something that I shouldn’t have.
It isn't anger. It's the way Steve looked at him. "
"I do."
Neither of them are happy when the rest of the team suits up to head to Canada, but Clint can't go twenty yards beyond the compound's walls and Hope still isn't quite meshing with the rest of them.
Tony rolls his eyes at her. "Widow, I have known Sharon since I was fourteen. She thought we were actual cousins until she was eight. When she was a kid I liked to tell her there were monsters in her closet just to go watch as she went and kicked their imaginary asses. Made the little 'hyah!' sounds and everything, god it was cute. My point is, Sharon Carter doesn't roll over for anything.
He meets Barnes' steady gaze with his own. "Anyone who needs it."
Yeah, it was. It was Tony's. Not the worlds not SHIELDs and not yours Steve.
T'Challa finally turns. He looks worried, Tony notes, unsurprisingly. "You and Barnes will not be in the same room. We have a set of rooms we use for practical research that allows two parties to communicate through speakers and a window."
"They don't," Tony says, eyes on Rhodey. "The Armed Forces are free to call us at anytime; the United States was nice enough to hand those decisions over to them for the time being. We're also free to say no."
He drops down onto the table, head in his hands. "I didn't. I didn't trust him. We can't control everything but God does that man try, Buck. He put Wanda under house arrest, and then at the airport...He's a good man, he is. I know that. Iron Man is...amazing and a hero, and so is the man inside. But I can't agree with what he did. And I can't agree with the Accords. There has to be a better way. If a country doesn't want us there, then, okay, we don't have the right to overrule them. But after what happened in Chad, do you think the others can honestly look me in the eye and say the Accords are working?"
Tony frowns down at his lap. Lukin has been asking to visit the compound and set up a regular government liaison for the Avengers since the hearing nearly three weeks ago. "I think one constant interloper is more than enough," he mutters.
At hour thirty-nine Tony is flicking holograms back and forth when FRIDAY finally gives up, activates one of her more deeply-hidden protocols left behind from JARVIS, and lift the blackout.
Tony's eyes snap to the side, going wide. "What?"
"We found you in here. Agent Carter left five minutes ago with Secretary Lukin." T'Challa hands him a plastic cup of water and he drinks deep.
The kids nod, Kamala already watching the silent version of the 2015 Eastern Europe battle. Tony feels a flicker of admiration for Barton's cool, commanding, but undemanding tone. He still remembers the one-sided conversation he recovered from the audio archives of the Battle of Sokovia, the pep-talk Clint gave Wanda that got her off her ass. Laura was right, as she usually is; he's made for this.
He just stared at me.
Steve sighed and wondered if it was even worth it to include Time Fog shenanigans in his After Action reports anymore and, after watching a few moments more to make sure nothing else happened, turned back to his original destination.
"Maybe she's playing the long game," Natasha says, considering. "She did it with Steve; had him fooled for sure-"
This is the poem Steve quotes and it is one of my absolute favorites: http://www.potw.org/archive/potw351.html
It is not the fun, teasing banter of his old team, of Natasha using a dirty trick to bring Clint to his knees or Thor powering Tony's armor to obscene levels that took out even the Hulk and briefly Steve thinks of interfering. But there's little point; Cloak has already told him several times that off the field he doesn't answer to Steve and Rachel never listens to anyone who isn't Fury and occasionally Dagger.
"I'm sure he did. He hates not having the last word. Reminds me of someone else I know," she says, rolling her eyes but unable to hide her look of pleasant surprise. "Send me up a copy, I'll take a look. Have you decided what you're going to do about Barnes?"
Clint shakes his head. "All of this wouldn't have happened if you hadn't signed the Accords."
He finds three signed copies of the Accords on his desk, as well as a transfer request for S. Wilson, C. Barton, and S. Rogers. He grants before he can think, and watches through the security cams three days later as the men move back into the compound.
"Is he coming back for it?"
Is Tony alright?
"You'd better get to work then."

The spy shook her head. “Two weeks ago. They ate an entire lunch together. Fighting didn’t break out until they were inside the Timeless Archives. That was forty eight minutes and eighteen seconds. Today was-“ She checked her watch. “Thirty nine minutes and two seconds.”
"Nobody made you do that, Carter."
“That’s me. Tony Stark. Red and gold, you got it, you brilliant incomprehensible weather front, you,” Tony cajoled. “You did good. Can I have my hand back?”
There was a moment when James looked unsure, still staring at his wrist like he could make the letters solidify by sheer will, but then the clouds past and he hugged Steve closer. “Sure, pal. ‘Til the end of the line.”
I wasn't trying to hurt him.
"This feels like deja vu," he tells her, and her grin is a bit dark.
Yes, the universe - two universes, in fact - really had it out for him tonight.
"You got it, Big Green!" Kamala chirped, stretching one arm far in the sky, phone in hand, ready to snap away.
"FRIDAY," he begins, but he trails off. He misses JARVIS acutely. He could have bounced ideas of him until he stumbled upon the answer, but FRIDAY has limitations JARVIS did not, limitations that might have stopped Ultron. In a way, she's not much more than Dummy or You, and Tony is occasionally breathless at the idea that she's smart enough to realize this. That she knows what he's done to her.
Tony sees stars. And in the stars sits a rock and on that rock sits a throne and on that throne sits a man - a monster - a
. "Right now and I shut it all down. I find another way. I always do. This is asking a lot of you, maybe more than you can give. You don't have to. Say no and-" What? Keep running, let the ghosts of HYDRA play havoc with his head, or go back in the deep freeze? Tony swallows hard and makes himself keep talking. He just knows he has to try, even if only to know that he did when he tries to live with himself later. "You don't have to do this."
“Director Fury,” Steve answered, still a little dazed from the fact that another him and Tony
"I am fine. I am-" She licks her lips, once, twice, she's nervous about him. "I have been watching you."
"I don't want to control him, I want to help him!"
"These are the
"Yeah," Tony breathes.
. But then, because Tony's still an asshole: "That's all you got?"
"It wasn't personal, Tones," Ty calls after them. "It was just business!"
Lukin shakes all their hands, dropping a kiss on Pepper's and gripping Rhodey firmly. "Colonel Rhodes. You look good. I saw the news; War Machine is flying better than ever. Airforce crows about you every chance they get."
He woke up this morning feeling a bit as if someone had suddenly thrown him a life preserver he didn't even realize he'd needed. He doesn't know if it's resolving what happened with his father, or his new determination to help Harry giving him purpose, or if it's - if it's Steve Rogers on his side again, no matter how peripherally. But he woke up needing to build, not just something he could leave behind, but something he could be a part of. He woke up suddenly and violently sick of the past, wanting a future.
"Don't send me back to them," Donnie begs him one day as Tony brushes the kid's sweaty hair back from where the neural band messed it up.
“Why?” was all he could manage, and for a moment, he thought he saw a light flicker in those dark eyes.
T'Challa agrees to those terms and Tony reaches over to the table where the papers Hope laid out for him rest. He sticks them in a manila envelope and scrawls a note on the front, then hands it over. "You know," he says, then pauses. "Never mind."
He doesn't meet Fury's eye and silence settles in the room for a long moment before the older man leans back. Softly, deadly, he asks "Why didn't you contact Stark, or Romanov for that matter, with your information?"
Tony swallows, looks down at the spaces between his fingers. "I'd like to," he says. "I don't think you know how much." He wants to stop hating this man. He wants to stop letting anger poison his grief. He wants to do the right thing, he wants to
Tony/Tiberius is the worst of the worst, guys. Also, since I know someone will ask me, YES. Steve will get his day in the sun next chapter and finally talk to someone.
He's the one to walk this time.
Tony wants to break something. "Same old SHIELD."
them to go to the source, but they refused. They said it would take too much time to start over. But I saw their hearts; they wanted their own slice of glory. I told them time spent on perfection was never time wasted. They cast me out."
That had been two hours ago, and the last he'd heard from her. The facility is a shit show from start to finish, a frequency knocking out their comms within minutes and forcing them to fight close quarters (which Dagger and Sam do not excel at) in total darkness. Steve cannot call a retreat when none of them can hear him and he cannot abandon his team.
Between the Avengers and the Guardians, a rough plan was sketched out for the next wave of the attack, pairing fliers with ground fighters to launch pronged attacks against the increased number of Chitauri fighters they expected and sending in a team to rescue Yondu, Quill's captured mentor, in hopes that the Ravagers would come to the Academy's aid once their leader was free. Meanwhile, Rocket and Groot planned to visit the Conservatory to search for survivor's from Ronan's attack as soon as the
“Because I went digging,” Tony said, and thrust what he had uncovered into Steve’s arm. “For this.”
? Self-obsessed, volatile, textbook narcissist, not a team player? Stop me if I'm wrong-"
The rooms falls silent as Kamala adamantly refuses to meet their eyes and Tony focuses on the table. Beside him, Rhodey shifts in his seat. "Well," he begins, and when they both look at him he is wearing a large, sly grin. "I think that sounds like a great idea, Kamala. Any idea what you want to do? Tony sort of owns the world, so he can get you anything."
before."
A long pause and then Tony's mouth went tight, his brows drawing tight and low. "Another Tony Stark. Jesus. What's he like?"
"If a cop screws up and they're under good command, their actions get investigated. It's the same here. You're still helping, Peter. You sign the Accords, you do all that legally. Something happens, you have the rest of us and a UN council to back you up. I can't promise it'll be like it was before, and you'll have to attend mandatory training and psych evals-"
Cap please take the deal. for wanda. she's had enough running scared in her life. Wakanda is safe.
It's a mistake he can fix.
“What?”
"Sergeant Barnes did not kill your parents, Tony," T'Challa says softly, comfortingly, but Tony despite his words feels that same anger welling up inside of him again.
whoa dude what happened to u got heart kid? also thank you so much for implying i have no mind of my own i love that really are you sure youre captain america?
He can't hide this any longer. It's time to put all the cards on the table.
“Steven! Did you hear? I was fantastic.”
"-and if she's as smart as me then she's good enough to fool Lukin. Maybe we should accept his liaison offer. If Agent Carter is running some sort of con on Lukin, for whatever reason, then we need to know about it. We need her to trust us more than she suspects him."
T'Challa inclines his head, a flicker of something dark in his eyes when he finally breaks eye contact. T'Challa's not much for deference of any kind, so the whole gesture makes the hair on Tony's arms raise a little.
“He’s always throwing it in my face! How much I’ve missed.”
"Until I didn't. I changed. You changed. It wasn't working anymore, not for me. And you wouldn't want me putting myself through that."
"There," she says, pointing out a dent in Peter's back. "It wasn't done knitting and it tore. With your healing factor you need, oh, probably another day's rest."
"This," he says, scrambling at his holographic keypads. T'Challa says his name once, twice, with increasing urgency. "FRIDAY, throw up the formula that we found."
The table was study in avoidance: Natasha, ignoring the side-eye Jan periodically threw her way as she carefully divested her sandwich of its crust, Sam ignoring the buzzing of Jan’s phone even as the vibrations caused it to inch ever closer to his elbow, Jan ignoring the pointed looks both frequently sent her way, and all three ignoring the distant yelling from the other side of the quad.
