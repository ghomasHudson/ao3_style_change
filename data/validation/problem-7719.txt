Tony, for the most part, stayed quite as he listened to Steve speak. He wanted to protest the position against Bucky but found that it would take too much energy that he didn’t want to waste if he needed it to get away from the thing lying innocently on the floor.
Unfortunately, he wasn’t prepared for the gunshot sounds to wake his dad. Peter jumped and climbed up the bedpost to avoid the fist that flew his way, Tony suddenly screaming like he was being flayed alive.
Tugging at the armor, Tony whimpered slightly, remembering feeling helpless for the two men before. It was also what spurred the memory of Edwin, of being told about truly loving someone. He paused, glancing into the blue eyes of the man whom had held him captive for so long.
“Oh, I don’t know if I’m allowed to say yet,” he admitted gently. “It’s supposed to be a surprise.” The kid tried and failed to waggle his brows, looking ridiculous and causing a laugh to pour of Tony’s throat.
Crossing his arms over his chest, the genius stepped out of the container so that he was closer to the king. “I never got to say this, but thank you, for taking care of my family when we needed it. I’m sorry for attacking you ear-”
Immediately, the bots are moving, going after each avenger with skills that they had never had before. The Black Widow barely dodges a sharp jab to her leg, and the team is shouting as they work to fight the machines that are slowly getting out of control. Beams shoot at the Falcon, the man taking to the air to dodge the deadly fire.
Tony slowly turns to face the right side of the room, noticing the bedside table that was moved so that they could fit the oxygen machine right against the mattress. It has a little lamp, and two remote controls that obviously control the television. Like the other room, there are three separate doors to his right. One by the television (he thinks it leads to the hall), another directly to the right which either leads to a bathroom or a closet, and the final one right next to it. All three doors are a dark navy blue.
“Hey kiddo,” he spoke gently, not wanting to startle Peter from his concentration.
What sounded like a bull crashed from the room, making Tony curse at the fact that he could barely breathe with the activity he had going. Another round of bullets started, this time not just directed at him.
The captain looked almost pleased at the words, his eyes glinting with the insanity that Tony accused him of as he used the free hand to wipe off the spit on his cheek.
Carol frowned, setting down her own tools and sitting down beside the genius. “You’ve been in here too long, if you’re thinking that way.”
While the king and Carol had disappeared to get things prepared, Tony got to spend a wonderful day reconnecting with his family.
They settled the two into the covers, throwing it up so that Peter’s little eyes barely peaked over the covers of the bed.
A hand catches his shoulder and keeps him down, but he only yelps and keeps fighting, wanting to get away. Had they tricked him? Were they taking him back to test more weapons on people?
The blonds gaze went up for only a moment, sensing the look, before he turned back to smile fondly at the man in his lap. Steve spoke, letting Bucky concentrate on getting food into the genius.
“We’ve released over thirty people into society,” a gentle voice made Tony jump as it spoke from behind where he was glancing at the ID of a Donald Blake that looked suspiciously like someone he knew.
A friendship to last a lifetime.
Tony turned his own gaze back to where the sequence of sounds had come through, dread pooling his stomach as the pause between the noises had grown entirely too long. Someone spoke, the words undecipherable to the genius whom could only hear what sounded like rushing water. He recognized the voice, knew exactly who was breaking into the warehouse.
Before Tony could send a suit to grab the kid, Pepper had pointed out that chances were no one had noticed Peter on the street. In fact, the less attention they brought to the kid, the better. Not that the genius didn’t put every single one on standby, in case he needed to get Peter out quickly.
While Bucky had disappeared, Steve had remained in the room and wore a wide grin at the sight of the two of them together. “The team’s eating breakfast together,” Steve explained.
Depending on how the mission went, the others would make a pit stop at one of the warehouses that stored some of the rebellions equipment, and then make their way to Wakanda.
“Lame,” Tony grumbled, laughing again when Peter turned and stuck his tongue out at him. He hadn’t bothered to correct his position, allowing himself to almost completely lay against Steve.
In seconds, Bucky entered with their new head of tech, looking rather pleased. He smiled as Steve looked up, hope in his eyes.
Tony flinched, “Roger’s is obsessed, taking me in as a refugee would mean spotlighting their existence to the world. They don’t want to put their people in danger, not for me, and I don’t want that to happen either.”
Bucky, a cut dripping blood down his temple, let out a laugh into the silence of the field. “Smarter than Howard alright. And damn beautiful.”
The man had then proceeded to run a hand down Tony’s face gently, “remember, you forced me to do this to you. This was your choice,” he added.
He threw a look over his shoulder at the man, grinning. “You sound like you’re looking forward to scaring him.”
Clint looks like he’s nursing a rather nasty cut on his own leg, Sam’s holding his arm close to his chest, his wrist looks like it’s facing the wrong way. Natasha has a straight cut near the vein on her neck that bleeds lightly and a large gash on the side of her stomach where her hands are pressed.
Peter’s gaze slowly traveled over his mentor, taking in the disheveled appearance, the arm wound, the shabby outfit that he’d been made to wear, everything. Tony, on the other hand, couldn’t look away from the kid’s face. He was memorizing every detail, taking in how Peter had already grown up so much since he had last seen him. It had been months, but it felt like they had been apart for years.
Turning on her heel, Wanda started back towards the tree, Pietro disappearing for a moment before he reappeared in the distance. “Come on, I have someone I want you to meet.”
Bucky, having disappeared for a moment into the room, returned with a pile of clothes. The two quickly dressing Tony in a pair of boxers, sweatpants, and an old AC/DC t-shirt that Tony would have recognized as his own if he hadn’t been completely out of it.
“I’ll take the restraints off, but you have to promise you won’t rip anything out. It’s for your own good,” the gentle voice drifted through his brain, a fog still keeping the genius confused.
Peter grinned, “yes. Let’s do it, right now.”
Trying to be quick, a hand moved into his view, reaching for one of the objects that had been settled	right in front of the toddler in a large pile. It was moved back just as quickly as Peter threw his arms out and slapped at the limb.
“Tony!” Suddenly Pepper’s face was right above him, looking pale and uncertain.
“Turn them off!” Steve shouts when Clint lets out a pained cry as one of the bots flings him to the ground.
Peter, whom had started the first film, grabbed a slice before curling into Tony’s legs. One hand clutching the man’s pants while the other held his meal. Rhodey threw his free arm around the back of the genius’ shoulders, relaxing into the sofa as Pepper nibbled on her own slice.
The soldier leans against the counter, smile smug as he unabashedly stares at the genius. Bucky picks up a fork and gently scoots it closer to the man. “Eat, and I’ll tell you.”
“If you’re out of the suit,” Rogers nodded.
“Jarvis, turn up the sound.” He smiled.
“Clint won’t say a word, I’ll make sure of it.” The blond reassured, holding the shirt higher as if that would convince the genius to take it. “Besides, the colors will look really good on you.”

Told you I was already working on the next chapters :) Thank you for the comments, suggestions, bookmarks, kudos, and subscriptions. You guys keep me motivated and give me some great ideas!
Tony Stark wasn’t made of iron.
Carefully lifting his hand away from where it was nudged between Bucky’s stomach and his own side, Tony blushed brightly, brushing against bare skin.
“I know that I promised you that I’d take care of Aunt May, and I’ve really done my best. Did you know that she even knows my secret now? I mean, that was inevitable. I hope I haven’t disappointed you about the power thing, but the world is a lot different now Uncle Ben. The Avengers, they turned on everyone.
Moving to the door by the bed, he stepped into a very modern looking bathroom. A huge bathtub sat to one end, while a huge shower sat to the other. Everything was in soft hues of gold and brown, the towels evergreen and clean.
Tony barely registered as the sound of splintering wood filled his room, the door flying from its hinges onto the carpeted floor. He barely made out the footsteps that walked towards the bed, or the hand that ran tentatively through his hair.
Tony had huffed, but otherwise hadn’t commented after he’d received a hug and a promise that the other man would be careful.
He heard a collective sigh of relief from the other end of the communicator and huffed out a quiet laugh as he started towards the headstone he’d visited too many times.
“How long until these are done?” Bucky asks, glancing around at the room where three fourths of the bots are already fixed.
They tried to get me to join them too, but I refused. I don’t want people to fear me. I still want to be like Iron Man, you know? He’s the best. He rescued me when I was little, and now he rescued me and Aunt May again. Did you know he’s been mentoring me? Tony takes care of me, he’s the best. I wish you could have met him Uncle Ben. He lets me work with him in the lab, we’re even working on a robot that can cook.” The kid paused to let out a watery laugh at the confession. “Everyone frankly sucks at making food, so we’re trying to make sure we don’t waste food anymore.”
When they were far enough away that the rest of the crew wouldn’t hear their conversation, Tony held up a hand and gestured towards a door that led to their living room. “I left a part in here that I need to grab real quick,” was his speedy explanation.
He must have fallen asleep through the film, feeling exhausted from the events of the day and still recovering from the shock of his captivity. His family had kept him warm, safe. It was obvious that either Happy or Rhodey had taken it upon themselves to carry him to bed.
“Tony?” Bucky’s voice rang from the other side. “Doll? Is everything alright? Can I come in?” He knocked a second time, as if the two hadn’t heart his voice from their lack of immediate reactions.
----------
Rogue had decided that while she appreciated the rebellion and what it stood for, that she had no interest in joining the organization. She claimed that if the time came, she would be on their side, but until then, she wanted to roam.
There was no time to get immersed in the past when every second was a moment with his family.
It took a moment, but Tony nodded, knowing that fighting was useless while restrained. If he could get free, there was a chance he could bolt out of the room. Of course, that was if the man leaning over him wasn’t one of the scary super soldiers.
“Never ask a lady her age,” he repeated. “Pepper used to say that to me all the time followed by telling me that I had no tact.”
“Me? Nothing. I have possibly everything I could have asked for, and more. But you, I find you so amusing.” Loki crossed his arms in front of his chest, smile wicked as he stared at Tony.
“Why don’t we just go scare him a bit?” Bucky suggested from over his shoulder. “Seems like a little punk, no jail time needed, just some good fear.”
Like Bucky, the blond didn’t set Tony down immediately. Instead, he quietly maneuvered to close the door behind them, and ambled down the hallway. When they reached the stairs, Tony finally spoke up figuring they were far enough away from the room that he wouldn’t wake Peter.
What sounded like a heavy sigh from the bedroom indicated the only frustration that Bucky had left, the soldier speaking gently. “I’m going to go finish making dinner, Stevie’s going to help me and come to get you when it’s done. Why don’t the two of you watch a movie while we’re doing all that? Relax?”
“Don’t worry, your white boy here will work for me and we’ll own the empire,” she winked.
Tony’s eyes were glazed over, staring blankly ahead as he tried to find a way back to himself. His hair was in disarray, having dried as he slept and sticking in every which direction. Jarvis had woken him before the rest of the bunker occupants and had directed him into the lab. Despite the sleep he’d gotten, the one cup of coffee wasn’t enough to fully wake the man.
Steve pulled back after a moment, concern and adoration shining in his blue eyes. “You’re okay sweetheart, you’re okay.”
Tony seemed taken aback, as if he had never truly put together that the kid would feel just as heartbroken as he had been. With another cry the man pulled the suddenly sobbing teenager into his chest, holding him close.
“Your fever is almost gone,” he grins.
Hope you enjoy this chapter, I had a lot of fun writing it.
------------------------
Peter was having a hard time keeping a straight face as the craft descended, one of his hands tightly clutching Tony’s as they tried to get a glance at the hallway that led to the cockpit.
Steve, unblinking, turned his gaze to the man and raised a brow. “And what about you?”
Tony frowns, wanting to protest when he finds the red hue is thrown over his mouth. He can’t struggle even as he tries to desperately be set free, watching as the girl lowers her hands.
Without hesitation, Tony immediately turned his gaze to look at the bright blue eyes of a smiling Steve Rogers. The man who hadn’t even bothered to wipe away the blood splatters of the life he had taken before.
Without being prompted, Bucky reached forward and gently lifted the sick man from the bed. There was no hesitation as he carried Tony bridal style towards an open door, Roger’s trailing behind only moments later after he had made the call to have the room cleaned. The two worked in tandem to undress the shivering genius. In Tony’s state of exhaustion, the man allowed them to treat him like a ragdoll without protest.
Tony squawked in indignation while Peter laughed, the kid bouncing away and off the bed without trouble.
The teenager was intelligent, sometimes too much for his own good. He had definitively been determined enough if he had risked taking Jarvis offline to get wherever he was going. “Wake the others, have them meet me in the living room.” Tony commanded, forgoing his shoes to sprint down the hallway. He needed to activate the suits, he needed to bring the kid back.
“Don’t worry, I won’t be saying anything. I just want you to know that I’m quite aware of what you’re doing. I only want to stand by and watch, see the outcome, watch the show.”
Thank you for the comments, kudos, and bookmarks! Thank you for liking a story, I always get nervous updating, but I hope you enjoy this chapter too! :)
He immediately looked around, trying to spot why his Spidey sense had suddenly flared. But there was no one nearby, nothing that he could see. Maybe he was just psyching himself out? Shaking his head, he jumped the fence and landed steadily on his feet on the other side.
“What happened?” Tony groaned, hugging Peter to his chest as he faced the blond soldier. A part of him wanted the man’s large arms to wrap around him, but another part recoiled at the thought of it.
As the last two times, lights had been dimmed so that he wouldn’t hurt his vision the second he was awake. Unlike the last two times, he was most definitively not laying in medical.
The lab was no longer monitored. Ever since that night, in which Tony had forgotten himself, the soldiers had stopped worrying that Tony was going to try to get away. His tracking bracelet had been removed, and he’d practically gained complete freedom in the building. They’d even given him their actual weapons to work on.
Carol, deciding that she no longer was going to wait for Tony, ambled into the room and settled onto the other end of the sofa.
And Carol was smart enough to catch on that they were being watched, because she smiled just as brightly back and nodded her head.
With that, the genius did as he was told. He stumbled, truly still weak and disoriented, but resolute. Peter was already walking quickly towards him, limping slightly as the injuries he’d sustained had already started to heal. The kid reached the genius fast, wrapping his arms around the man as if it were their last embrace.
One of Barnes’ hands slipped up so that it rested over the softly glowing arc reactor, and the genius was quickly starting to catch on that they knew more than most. He shook his head, trying not to relive a moment that only his closest friends should have known about.
“No!” Peter argued, doing his best to coordinate his limbs to get to the stolen objects that were currently being held out of his reach.
Clint, looking like he had his own fair share of suits he’d had to fight off, jumped down beside Natasha with an impressed whistle. “I knew he could make some cool stuff, but that was impressive.”
With a shout Tony throws himself back, falling to the ground as Bruce flings himself forward, falling into the training room below as he slowly changes into the green monster he’s known for.
“What?” The blond seemed surprised, his eyes scanning Tony as if looking for some sort of injury that may have caused the attack. Even Peter had frozen, looking like the world had just fallen on his shoulders as he took in the state of his mentor.
The two, donning similar comfortable clothing with plain shirts, carried the genius into the room where the bed had been completely changed. While they had been in the bathroom, someone had put in a new mattress, new covers, sheets, and even pillows.
Across the monitor the words scrawled out. “Hello Sir.”
“Tony’s Old Man Music.”
“You’re not going anywhere,” Steve hissed, using all his strength to start pulling the suit back into the building.
“I’ve done something terrible, I’ve…” He stopped, watching the man he considered his father shake his head.
Ten-thousand and eighty minutes.
Immediately, Steve threw up his hands in a stop gesture. “Woah, we didn’t hurt you Tony.”
“Tony, if you’re hearing this, we’re coming for you. We’ll make sure you’re safe.” Rogers was speaking to a room full of people, but his voice still sent a chill down Tony’s spine as if the man were in the same room. “I don’t know what that mutant has done to you, but we’ll keep you safe.”
“Jarvis,” he marveled, refusing to let the man go, even if the German cleared his throat nearby.
“I can’t hurt you Tony, I can’t,” Rogers murmured.
Tony barely dodges, and with a startled yelp, he realizes that he’s made a grave mistake. He set the bots to go after the original team, and he’s Iron Man.
“Come on guys, we should celebrate!” He paused, realizing that even talking was leaving him breathless.
Tony had been watching the happenings and had refused to roll over when it came to the young man. Using technology in the underground bunker developed to keep them set for several years, the genius figured out the kid’s identity.
Tony was quickly learning that the rebellion truly wasn’t trying to hold anyone against their will. If a superhuman could be out in the open without getting noticed, the rebellion was definitively at the top of their game to help.
She giggled, taking Sam’s hand and disappearing into the hall as both Steve and Clint appeared, a little startled from where the other two had gone.
Not having Bucky and Steve coddling him makes breathing a little easier. Of course, being under a machine covered in oil and grease also relaxes Tony unlike anything else. Even if the other scientist is supervising, Bruce seems to trust him enough to let him do as he pleases.
Tony rolled his eyes, arms crossed over his bare chest as he glared daggers at the man. “No, I refuse. Pick something else.”
“Dr. Strange!” Peter’s face popped out from behind the sofa, looking excited as he rambled. “But you can also call him Mr. Wizard, or Wizard dude… he does magic and stuff.”
“With Peter, I know that you’re not happy that he’s a little kid, but… the world is so cruel. We just wanted to give you the opportunity to be happy, away from all the worries and concerns of this world. The opportunity to raise him right.”
“I can’t lose you!” Peter screamed back, suddenly unable to hold in his own emotions and fear. “Do you know what happened when you sent us away? Do you know what that did to me?” The kid had tears in the brim of his eyes as he spoke.
The desperation and the realization knock Tony to his knees, a sob clawing its way out of his throat as he curls into himself. He barely registers when the soldier slides his metal arm under his legs, the other at his back to lift him into a bridal carry.
He started to turn on his heel, ignoring the grinning Clint nearby. The man’s smile turning even brighter when both Steve and Bucky made no move to stop the genius from leaving the room.
Tony froze, completely unprepared to be given a choice. He hadn’t really been given one since coming into the compound, but that didn’t mean much. “Tomorrow, I have a feeling that they’re going to be a little clingy today. I didn’t exactly have the easiest time waking up yesterday.”
For the first time Tony took a second to look beyond the two super soldiers still hovering nearby and towards the rest of the team. He’s shocked to find that despite everyone being alive, the bots did some major damage.
Quickly, he realized that the person whom he had been snuggling with earlier had disappeared, and a mild panic set in that Peter was gone. However, it took the genius only seconds to spot the little boy curled up on Bucky’s chest, drooling as his little cherub face disappeared into the man’s messy hair.
“Where are we?” He asked, Pietro having run ahead of them.
Sitting on the corner of the couch, was a man that Tony hadn’t seen in years, the man that had helped him keep his family safe. The man raised a hand in greeting, although he did not stand seeing as the two hadn’t moved from the doorway.
Taking a few steps into the room, hand grasping a hold of the loveseat, so he wouldn’t fall, Tony never took his eyes off the other man. Finally, catching the lungful of air he hadn’t realized he’d lost, Tony spoke.
The whole team had been surprised and elated.
He noticed Bruce was standing by a huge brick grill, built so that there was a counter space where they could prepare or set ingredients down on the side.
Laughing, Bucky sauntered across the room and started to drag the blond away from the monitors and towards the door. “That just means his Pop’s going to have to teach him a trick or two when he’s here.”
What appeared to be a sketchbook rested on the bent leg, using it as a makeshift table as his hand idly sketched across the paper.  Steve’s blue eyes twinkled, shining with an emotion that Tony was hesitant to identify. There was absolutely no way that the only emotion the blond was feeling towards the escaped and now captured man was love.
He let out a nervous laugh, reaching forward and ruffling her hair. The teen growled and shoved his hand away, but otherwise did nothing more as she led him further into the bowels of the subway.
He was doing his best to eat a sandwich that Peter had whipped up for him, although the hard bandages made him look more like a five-year old, his coordination completely off. At one point, Peter had taken pity on him and wrapped up the bottom so that the insides of the thing would stop falling in his lap.
“I’ll be fine Pepper, I’m not an invalid,” he’d rolled his eyes as the redhead had hovered by the door.
“Rogue,” Tony supplied. He glanced down at her hands, seeing the black leather gloves that covered the skin. He had read the file, and knew that she held a power that came from touch, so it made sense that she was practically covered from head to toe.
Steve raised a brow, “and that language!” The hand holding his wrists tightened, sending a spark of pain through Tony’s arm as his bandaged wrist ached in warning. “You shouldn’t be talking like that Tones, you’re my sweet, little, innocent genius.”
“Jarvis!” Tony grinned, “it’s so great to hear from you! Are you doing okay after that attack?”
It took several minutes before things started to fade from his vision, and Tony managed to relax in Steve’s arms. When he tapped the hand on his waist gently, he was moved into a sitting position, although Steve merely moved him into his lap rather than letting him go.
Soon enough War Machine was off, going directly after Bucky who was closest to him. The soldier dodged to the right, trying and barely missing getting the man in a left hook.
Both of them paused for a moment before bursting out into laughter, thinking the same thing. Carol, now grinning, shrugged and added, “I used to be a captain in the Air Force… if that helps?”
When his eyes fluttered open three hours later, it was to hear Bruce speaking gently. A hand that had been brushing through his hair paused for a moment, but when Tony quickly pretended to fall back under it started the movements again.
Tony rolled his head as best as he could where it rested against Steve’s chest, making out Bruce’s chin and upper chest. “I’ll cook tonight, something a little less healthy so the little one will eat.”
“Ah, yes,” Edwin smiled, sitting up after he planted a gentle kiss on the genius’ temple. “Safe. But let me ask you this, if life was safe, would you have accomplished all you have done?”
There was a sort of panic on Steve Rogers face as he started to run, sprinting at Tony to stop whatever was coming from happening.
One of them was telling him to breathe. Tony looked up with every intention of telling the person to go to hell when brown eyes clashed with concerned blue. He recognized the eyes immediately, and didn’t stop the knee jerk reaction as he lurched forward and latched onto the man’s shirt.
Steve grinned, “see that you do, dismissed.”
Tony didn’t even complete the trip down the hallway, the exhaustion, fear, and stress finally overriding his already spent system and sending him under. He had never been more grateful to pass out into the darkness.
“Come on!” Tony whined, “no!”
It didn’t work, as Bucky pulled back and moved them so that Tony was laying flat on his back, staring up at the two men that had identical grins on their faces. The dread was starting to outweigh the warmth the smiles sent down his spine, trying desperately to figure out what had happened in their time away.
Tony groaned, looking at the kid who was grinning from ear to ear. “You’re going to pick Star Wars, aren’t you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Looking down at his bare feet, Tony sighed as he took in the worn carpet that felt a little rough under his toes. He had the scar from the leg wound, but fortunately it was healed enough that he could walk on it without trouble.
“I heard you were cute, I didn’t realize you’d be this cute,” the man pointed out. “And the way you rescued that kid!” It was obvious the archer at least respected Tony’s intellect, even if he was on the wrong side of the genius’ problem.
Carol didn’t comment on the change of subject, knowing that the man needed to focus on something other than his distress. It would only send him into a panic attack which would lead the soldiers into coddling Tony and possibly throwing his mentality further into the recess of confusion.
“When I originally had to get the arc reactor put into my chest, there were elements inside that were slowly poisoning me. I figured out a cure, but it meant creating a whole new element to fix it.” Tony explained. “And I have no idea how the serum and de-aging process that they’ve done to me is going to effect the poisoning.”
A girl stood in the doorway, her eyes glowing red. Her hands had the same glow, and she wore a dirty hospital gown and no shoes. Her hair whipped as if caught in a nonexistent wind. Her full attention was on him.
used a weapon that I created as an innocent child on another human being.
Pulling back, she grinned and planted a quick kiss on Tony’s forehead before he could protest and all but bounced towards Sam, looking completely like the teenager they’d made her. Reaching Sam, the blond turned to glance at the quiet genius.
child’s head, do you understand?” He glared, tensing as Steve stood from where he had lay relaxed on the sofa.
The hands gently started to remove all the restraints, reluctant only for a moment before they made sure all the cords were gone and wound up away from the bed. The figure then gently took a seat on the bed and ran a hand through his hair, the affection unmistakable.
(See the end of the chapter for
Using his powers, Peter clung onto the man even as the genius’ arms dropped to his sides, legs failing to keep him upright.
“We found it among your things at the bunker, figured it might be good to have. If I remember reading correctly, you like to play music while you create, right?” Bucky added.
Pouting again, the little boy shook his head in denial. He quickly pulled forward again, burying his face in Bucky’s shirt to hide with a quiet whine.
“Alright kid, let’s set you up so you can help me fix these arrows, yeah?”
Tony figured he was in some sort of mansion, the place an obvious getaway from civilization. But he wasn’t tied down, and that didn’t make sense. He could find his way out of the forest, and the group allowing him free reign after escaping didn’t seem logical.
The music started to repeat again, this time Tony having to step away from a hand as it reached for him. He easily slipped forward, the blond captain not going after him, thinking that Tony meant to check out exactly what was happening.
On the seventh day, Tony was allowed to walk himself to the dining room to join breakfast with the team. Steve had gotten him a pair of crutches, and their trek had been slow. The blond had made it a point to stand as large as he could make himself to hide the metal door from Tony’s view, and the man was grateful for it.
However, the set of curls snuggled up right under his nose remained the same, and he came to the realization that he was settled on a soft mattress. Moving his head only slightly back so he could take in his surroundings, Tony recognized the soft cream and rich green that made up the covers of the large bed that had been set in the room he’d awoken in earlier.
Something ached at the thought of his AI, and a feeling settled deep in his gut. It was the sudden dread that kept Tony from calling out, what if something bad had happened to Jarvis?
Tony didn’t know who it was, but now any form of human contact was welcome to chase away his nightmares. Grateful that he wasn’t alone to deal with the memories, Tony did his best to scoot closer to the warmth of what he now recognized as a body cradling him from behind. The person took his slow movements as open invitation, wrapping an arm around his waist and lifting his shirt so that warm fingers could gently rub his abdomen in a comforting gesture.
Loki had probably taken one look at Tony’s “mistake” and realized that as an engineering genius, the bots wouldn’t have been so strong without some sort of purpose. Sure, he could have passed it off as Tony overestimating the strength of the Avengers, but that would have been hard to do for a man that had fought alongside them.
The brunette released a sigh, hands curled on the sink as he glanced down at the running water. He’d gone into the bathroom to brush his teeth but had let the faucet run so he could spend a few moments lost in his own thoughts.
“I was born human,” she explained. “But there was an…” she paused, looking for the right word. “Accident… and let’s just say I’m not a mutant, but I’m not entirely human either.”
Grinning wide Peter wrapped his arms around the animal, barely able to lift the creature as he was smaller than it. “Goose!”
The laughter echoed behind the two, leaving Rhodey and Happy with bittersweet smiles on their faces. They hadn’t been sure about rescuing the Parker’s at first, but in the end neither had regretted the decision. Tony was more energetic around the kid, and his aunt had been a godsend for Pepper who was no longer the only female in the bunker.
When Peter got to it, he relaxed. His shoulders fell as he crouched down to dust at the stone. “Do you… do you guys mind if I turn this off for a minute?” He heard Tony’s voice protesting before he continued. “Just for five minutes, no longer. I just… I want to talk to him alone. Please Tony?” Peter pleaded softly.
“You have to practice because of that, boss.” Happy held out a hand, looking all too pleased at having thrown Tony down.
“Why am I in medical?” It was still the bunker, he’d known because he put it together himself.
Looking at the suit and knowing that the captain wouldn’t be releasing his grip anytime soon. Tony shook his head and spoke so softly that only the blond could hear the words.
Just as Tony moved to the wall of weapons to grab an arrow, the music malfunctioned, and Black Sabbath started to blast through the speakers, the pounding of the music so loud that even the walls started to shake with each hit of the beat.
Absolute terror filled the genius. He couldn’t recall how he got to the lakeside, nor how he ended up with a shivering little boy curled into his chest. Tony could barely hear over the beating of his own heart as he hugged the shivering kid, Bucky lingering nearby with water dripping onto the small dock.
“Breathe,” he commands softly. “Breathe doll,” his voice is soft, almost nurturing if it weren’t for the fact that they’re about to hurt him irreversibly.
“Daddy,” the word was spoken gently. “I made you cookies.”
“If they ask me, I don’t trust myself not to reveal it. If they try to figure out what you’re doing, I might talk. Please, Carol, just…. don’t. Just take care of yourself and forget about me.”
Tilting his head, the man took in where they had placed him after his hysteria.
Tony blinked.
Turning back to shower, he threw himself under the spray. The bottle of shampoo was flower scented, the soap lavender. The water and products helped to wash away all scents from his experience, and Tony knew that he was in the shower a lot longer than Pepper’s timeline.
Tony snorted, “oh yeah?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Before a fight could start between the two, Happy held up a hand and spoke in a tone that broke no room for argument. There was a reason he was head of security at Stark Industries.
Peter and Shuri were given the job of heaving some of the boxed crates that hadn’t been stored into the large metal transporting enclosures into the craft. Rhodes and T’Challa had taken to attaching large chains, made from a material Tony couldn’t identify, to the back of the craft and the metal containers. It looked as if they intended to empty out the warehouse.
“Should I make vroom noises while we ride?” Clint teased, already starting forward.
“I’d rather be late,” Tony raised a brow. “Or just miss it completely.”
When they finally start to build, Bucky carefully reading the instructions and pausing to let Natasha hand Peter the pieces, the child completely ignored the archer nearby.
Without much hesitation, Bucky reached forward and whisked the kid up so that he was settled on his hip. Tony noted how natural the action had been. And made a mental note to get back at the kid for treating him like a human bouncy house.
Still somewhat dizzy from the tranquilizer, Tony was silently grateful when Steve caught him as he bent down to put on the socks and shoes.
If that meant forcing Tony to eat, they would do it. Fortunately, it appeared as if the genius had no qualms about eating whatever Bucky cooked, if judging by the begrudged looks he’d get anytime he stole a homemade chip.
While intelligent, Steve didn’t seem to know some of the tools that the genius requested. Of course, Tony couldn’t figure out if the ignorance was on purpose, or if the man truly didn’t know some of the basic tools.
Turning wide eyes between the door and the little boy, Tony raised his brows in complete and utter confusion. Almost laughing in the chaos when Peter’s little hands started to make a rolling motion as if urging Tony to speak up.
Standing by the kitchen counter is none other than Jarvis. The man is smiling at him, eyes sparkling as he looks at Tony proudly. The man speaks gently, “whatever they do to you, they cannot take your soul. They will never break the spirit of the boy I raised. Start a spark Tony, and let it blaze like a wildfire.”
“He’s mine, Rogers!” Tony grinned, glad when the captain only gave him a bemused look. Seeing as Peter would likely not be returning to his chair, Steve quickly removed it so that there was nothing between them.
Blinks again and finds himself with Rhodey, getting hugged in his living room as he cries for the loss of his mother (and a little bit for his father).
“I’m assuming we have to trust it’s just going to work?” Tony smiled softly, nodding his head at her question. Carol pulled back from the embrace and beamed, staring at the watch in wonder.
“I healed!” Peter cheerfully announced. “Daddy! I heal!” The kid started to jump in his lap, giggling when Tony let out an ‘oof’ at the weight and movement.
choices. Because of what you and the merry band of psychos have done?”
“An hour, two if you keep talking,” Tony replies.
Tony could make out a toaster, a microwave, and a few other appliances sitting in the pile. It would take him less than a day to fix everything. He didn’t voice it, though. Perhaps, he could take small pieces and hide them away to create his own means of escape.
“Peter?” Tony questioned.
“Don’t tell me your plan. Don’t tell me the day, or the time, or how… just… don’t.” Turning so he was completely facing the blond, Tony gave her his trademark smile. The one that was absolutely bittersweet.
Banner was surprisingly absent, but the assassin had warned him that they had other ways of watching his actions. Thus, Tony was to behave if he wanted to return to the lab. He figured, he had to start slow and continue to gain their trust if he wanted to actually build something to defeat the insane group of former heroes.
Tony sighed, letting the water wash out the shampoo before following it with the conditioner, liking the smell of soft amber that was left behind. He hadn’t realized the situation at first, having been in the medical wing trying to get his brain to function. However, soon enough Tony had realized that they had a large problem that wasn’t going to be easily solved.
“Help me?” His voice was so quiet, a whimper that he couldn’t stop.
“Tony?” The voice didn’t sound panicked, gentle and relaxed.
“I think I deserve an award for that performance,” Peter continues, little arms crossed over his chest. However, he stops talking when he realizes that Tony looks like he’s in a cross between hysterical and a third heart attack.
“Six months ago, Tony Stark, former CEO of Stark Industries, disappeared with a mutant on the streets of New York. And while we don’t believe Tony to be dangerous, we are worried for his safety near this mutant.” With those words, James Barnes stepped forward, looking cleaner than Tony had ever seen him.
He couldn’t withhold a small chuckle at the thought of T’Challa attempting to stop the two from some crazy experiment.
Steve looked grim, silent for a moment before he finally nodded in agreement. Tony’s shoulders fell, and the two men were quick to follow the request.
“Transferring data,” a voice interrupted the calm atmosphere.
Sorry for the wait! This chapter was a little filler, a little plot, so I hope you like it! It's not my favorite chapter, but it gets the plot moving. I'm already working on the next one so hopefully it won't take me very long to update! :) Thank you for all your amazing reviews, bookmarks, and kudos!
“At least you’re getting real underwear and not diapers,” he’d murmured, shrugging as he threw on a pair of familiar sweats and a faded band shirt.
Taking a moment, she raised her hands and threw her hair into a ponytail. They’d put her in the same sports and baggy clothing that they’d been giving Tony. No jeans or anywhere they could really store things. Just sweats, socks, and a t-shirt.
“You’re so beautiful sweetheart,” he got in reply, the blond kissing his way down Tony’s chest.
Before she could argue, he grinned and spoke gently. “Going to those charity galas was actually a benefit for us, I made connections with a young man at the time called T’Challa. He’s the king now. I’ve already confirmed the plan, and to expect you if something were to happen.”
A wicked smile lifted on the Captain’s face, unable to hide the pure excitement that he was finally going to get exactly what he wanted. The Quinjet would take only an hour or two to get them across the country, and in that time, there would be no time for anyone to sense that the system was online.
He had to withhold a sigh as the little boy threw up his arms while nodding his head, making grabby hands at Tony to pick him up.
“Then where did you go?” Tony questioned, eyes meeting Steve’s light blue gaze.
“Keep it under wraps, don’t fight them. When the time comes for you to get out of here, I’ll help.” He put down the hammer, taking a seat to put the pressure off his bandaged leg.
“Who’s Flerken?” Tony turned his head, letting Peter remove his own clothing before the kid climbed up and into the warm water.
Tony swallowed, pulling back and looking at the man’s warm eyes to see his own reflection. A broken, confused, sad human being that had been pushing his limit. A man who had given into the easy solution instead of continuing to fight so he wouldn’t get hurt.  And love, real and unchanged despite the passage of time. Yes, he could listen to Edwin’s request.
There were protests, Peter’s fists were banging on the window as he cried.
“Mr. Stark,” his voice instantly giving away his German accent. “It’s a pleasure to meet you. I have been waiting for you. We all have, actually.”
“Doll,” the voice is a mixture of sadness and love. It feels wrong.
He outright laughed. “The only place in the world where the former heroes have no ruling. They think it’s barren, like you did.”
She pushed the man to his feet, leading him out of the room with the same gun that had killed his coworker sitting snuggly against his back.
“Remind me,” he asked softly. “Remind me that we’re not here of our own free will, that we’re captives.” His voice wavered at the end, a clear sign that Tony was truly panicking.
The battle bots have been worn down, but it won’t take him longer than a few hours to get them all up to speed. It isn’t hard to convince Bruce that in order to make the bots actual worthwhile adversaries, he’s going to have to recode their programing.
“Tony!” One of the figures cried in excitement, before pushing from the tree and starting forward. The gold in her hair almost sparkling amongst the brown, hazel eyes bright and happy, all hints of red gone for the moment.
Carol continued to repeat the mantra until Tony’s shoulder slouched, his poster relaxing as her words cleared his head. He didn’t touch his palm, having a real person grounding him to reality helped. A part of his brain still argued that what the soldiers were doing was affectionate… was love. A part him still wanted to believe that he’d never have to worry with the two men by his side.
“What are you saying?” Tony was a genius, but his brain couldn’t understand why they would want him to leave the two men when he’d already gotten so far. He was safe, wasn’t he? “They keep me safe, I don’t have to fight anymore.”
“Oh!” Shuri looked surprised, before shooting a look at T’Challa whom had returned from helping Rogue find the best place to head for on her map.
“But, people always leave.” Tony argued.
Peter’s smile splits his entire face, clapping brightly. “This is Goose! He’s the Flerken we were talking about.”
Glancing up to catch her eye, the genius took a moment to observe the small dot on her arm where her skin was consistently irritated. They injected her daily so that her powers wouldn’t return, and Tony had taken to keeping a close eye on her health to monitor any negative affects the injection could have.
Clint immediately snorted, hand moving down to finish the last restraint on Tony’s leg. “If you were a prisoner you wouldn’t be laying on these lovely Egyptian sheets.” Standing up the man ran to the hall door and came back seconds later with a wheelchair.
They had barely made it out of the aircraft before it crashed and was destroyed in the dense brush. Jarvis once again claiming that they had no business with his creator before the thing had shut down completely and lost all power.
Three months later, Tony flew out of a cave with a light in his chest and a new perspective on the world. Stark Industries stopped producing weapons, and Pepper Potts, a previously unknown employee of the company, took over PR events.
Tony returned the smile with a fond expression before he wheeled himself into the bathroom, watching as Jarvis slid the door closed behind him. He couldn’t hide the fact that he felt warm from their attention and care, it wasn’t something he’d had growing up.
Tony doesn’t realize that he curled closer into the warm bodies on the sofa, that as the movie progresses he’s bickering with the team like he would Peter. By the end of the film, they decide they need to follow the film up with Annabelle. Tony doesn’t protest, he also doesn’t admit that throughout the film he hides behind his blanket.
“Get out,” he hissed.
The water was instantly warm, and Tony couldn’t stop himself from burying his face into the soldier’s collarbone again as the water sprayed over them. However, when he noticed that Steve was turning off the shower and moving them both towards the tub, he panicked.
The thought of working with his AI seemed to bring Tony back, unconsciously he had leaned towards Peter whom had made his way to stand beside him. “I can… I can do that.”
From the corner of his eye, Tony sees a blur shoot past where he hovers towards the ongoing men. In seconds Carol has appeared, using abilities he didn’t know about as she punched Bucky off the machinery and to the ground. One hand snatching a mechanical wing and throwing Sam onto the top of a nearby building.
Tony merely whimpered, burying his face at Steve’s collarbone as he tried to process what he had gone through. Steve was back, when had that happened?
There were footsteps behind them, catching up.
“Come on kiddo! All you have to do is stick the pieces together! We don’t need to follow instructions!” Clint exclaimed, sitting cross legged next to the little boy.
“No one’s had them yet kiddo, you can share them with your dad.” He winked at Peter.
“It’s okay doll!” Bucky lifted his metal hand and tried to rub soothing circles on Peter’s back. “It’s okay!” He was glad that there was no reason to throw dirty looks at the archer, Natasha had already punched him firmly in the arm.
“You’re beautiful sweetheart.” Steve acknowledged, leaning forward so that Tony could taste himself on the man’s tongue.
“Tony,” he murmurs, trying to get the genius’ attention.
When a hand gently probes his own, Tony doesn’t think.
With the sedative still working, the blond didn’t notice the full-blown panic in Tony’s eyes. Instead, he focused on lifting the man’s body and settling him into the tub. The water covering them both, although Steve had the thought to place Tony right next to him so that he wasn’t pressed up against the completely naked soldier.
Slowly, the walls to protect himself were breaking, and he was getting used to the group. He was becoming docile, wanting the warmth that came from the two men that kept his nightmares at bay. Not that they weren’t the cause of them. There had been no protest when he was lifted and carried into the bedroom.
Through a series of letters, numbers, and sequences they took a good fifteen minutes before the application to transfer was complete. The collection of data had reached ninety-nine point five by the time the group had finished. It wasn’t an easy job, but with the trio at the keys it seemed like transferring Jarvis to Wakanda wouldn’t be an issue.
He didn’t like leaving the child alone in the room with the other man, but without screaming and waking the boy, Tony had no choice but to go along silently.
Resisting the urge to roll his eyes and trying hard to ignore the small nagging voice that told him he was too comfortable; Tony lifted the child onto his hip. It was quickly becoming habit to cock his body a bit to the side so that Peter fit perfectly against his side, and briefly the man wondered what it would have been like to truly raise the kid.
It took several minutes before James noticed the look on his friends face and held up a hand to stop Pepper from her ranting.
He had seen the man have mild panic attacks in the bunker; Peter had never witnessed a full attack before. Without knowing what else to do in his situation, he started to scream for help.  The tears streaming down his face completely real, he didn’t have to fake anything. Even shaking terribly at the sight of the screaming man.
They’d put an IV into his good arm, and he could feel the difference. He didn’t feel as lightheaded, the world was spinning less and his thoughts were focused. Taking a moment to look around, Tony realized that another medical bed had been set up nearby, and it looked ready for a second person. Whatever they were going to do, it was obvious that there was room for someone to get hurt.
When he opens his eyes, they’re moving down the hallway. He knows because Clint is once again pushing the chair, the soft noises he’s making under his breath reminding Tony of the first time the archer pushed him.
Bucky grinned, “And a ticket to Tony.”
The first thing the man did was rig an old speaker to the music player, blasting the music as soon as Natasha left. After that, it hadn’t taken very long for the man to get lost in the appliances they’d left behind for him.
Several tense minutes passed in silence before the king and woman reappeared at the front door, holding a bag each over their shoulders. Both looked ready to go, cautiously glancing around the area as they stepped among the women warriors.
“So-“ Before Rhodey could speak, the door opened again admitting T’Challa back into the room. While the king looked composed, Tony could sense that there was also an urgency to his attitude.
The man quickly realized that the pillow under his head was a leg, and that Bucky hadn’t bothered to stop the motion that Tony had associated with the blond man across from them.
She grabbed his palm and tapped it once, watching as the skin shown orange for a moment. “You are the protector of those of us who were lost. So yes, you saw me die, but I’ve never really left.”
“Peter will be going on the mission, but he will not be in the field.” When the two brunettes turned to stare at him incredulously, he continued. “Tony, you might need help with the tech with that arm injury, and Peter is great with that stuff. The two of you can sit in the surveillance room and be the eyes. Plus, with Peter’s spidey senses you may be able to catch people on the monitor before Tony.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony, still in the chair, asked if Peter would help him get to the lab on the other side of the compound so he could grab some manuals for a few things. He wouldn’t take the kid all the way to the lab, didn’t want the teenager to notice that Dum-E and U had both been moved into the escape ship.
“Do you want to bake some cookies for your daddy? We can finish this right after?” He smiled, “they can be part of dinner, or we can put them in your cake.” The last part was said with a less amused tone, eyes narrowed on the grinning archer.
For what felt like the hundredth time, Tony glanced towards the hallway, hoping that one of the teens would show up telling him that the A.I. was ready to be transferred, or was close to it. Tony understood that the amount of data it had taken to create Jarvis was colossal, and that gathering everything after he had spread so thin would take time.
------------------------------------
He stood, turning towards the hallway where they had all come from. “They’re not going near Peter, and neither are you.”
-------------------------------
“You’re safe Tony, you’re going to be okay baby.” There was no reaction to the words, the genius starting to drift in and out of consciousness as he tried to process everything that had happened. He missed the small smile that lifted the corner of the men’s lips when he did not protest the pet name.
“So not a mutant, but not completely human?” Tony had been left alone with Carol when Bruce had gone to fetch everyone lunch, and the scientist hadn’t returned yet. Their conversation was held over the sound of a hammer and a drill machine, keeping it mostly private if they were being recorded.
Immediately, several holograms floated before them in different shades of color. Tony used swiping motions until all that was left was a large map of Africa, an overview of the land. He used a pinching motion and watched as the hologram zoomed in to show a satellite view of the area.
The man lands on the ground hard, reaching forward and using whatever is within reach to try to raise himself up to his feet.
It appeared to be constructed completely of wood, although he knows that it must be reinforced considering it would be too easy for him to get out. The floors are also wood, and heat seems to travel from underneath so that when he steps a foot outside of the shaggy carpet, he’s still pleasantly surprised. The bed looks handmade, with what looks like manmade branches intertwining high into the ceiling serving as the headboard.
With a frown Tony tilts his head enough so that he can just see past Roger’s broad shoulders, spotting Clint Barton standing with his arms crossed. A wheelchair sits idly by the former hero, cushioned so that whomever sits in it can be comfortable as they’re transported.
The person nuzzled his neck, humming in satisfaction before he pulled Tony off so that the genius was on the bed.
He only prayed he wouldn’t get too lost along the way.
Approximately thirty minutes into building the swing set, Tony was reminded why he rarely let anyone into the lab while he was working.
She tilted her head, the soft raise of the side of her lips as she gazed unblinking at the frozen man. “You have forgotten, but I will show you.”
“I was sent to pass on a message,” she draws his attention back. “You need to hold on Tony, to escape. You need to see what they’re doing and figure out how we’re going to put an end to it. But you can’t break, you can’t give into them.”
“Is there even a television here?” Tony raised a brow, looking at the room where everything pointed at a fireplace, no screen to be seen.
He had been taken from the bunker at some point, and made to live with his former colleagues. There had been horrible mind manipulation that he had never agreed to, but had no ability to change. Just as he had started to find himself feeling warm towards the two men that were obsessed with him, Jarvis had broken in with a… a blond and rescued him.
And Tony, relaxing into the warmth that the bodies surrounding him provided, felt safe. He ran his free hand through Peters hair, using the injured one for pizza.
The first thing Tony heard as he started to wake was the steady beeping of a heart monitor. The smell of disinfectant strong, causing his nose to scrunch as he tried to get used to the smell. It was obvious he was in the medical wing, but why? What had happened?
With horror creeping up his throat, Peter couldn’t withhold the whimper as his eyes met the icy blues of the Winter Soldier. Only with the reflexes that came with training, the teenager threw himself back, sprawling against the headstone behind him.
“Rhodey tried to sneak into my mansion to throw pie in my face in the middle of the night,” Tony spoke with glee, ignoring the look he was receiving from his friend.
It was almost as if Peter hadn’t meant to speak it, his eyes widening a fraction in the realization. He didn’t move from where he had frozen in the doorway, but the tears that had started to well on the side of his eyes didn’t freeze.
Tony snorted, “I’m not a damsel in distress ‘Tasha.”
With a quick thought he ran to the bedroom and grabbed the covers from the bed, deciding that he’d make himself into a human burrito to watch whatever he wanted.
Tony frowned, “what do you want?”
Bucky only held on tighter, keeping him cradled as he desperately tried to pry himself away, unaware that he was not in the cave of his nightmares. The one that had caused the PTSD.
At the age of fourteen, Anthony began his studies at MIT. And while Howard wasn’t impressed, he’d made his first friend in James Rupert Rhodes.  It was also the first time someone other than Jarvis had called him Tony.
Tony was going to drown. He was going to die. Steve was going to stick him under the water, and he was going to die.
The smug look on their faces died almost instantly when they finally got a good look at Tony. The man was sitting up in the hospital bed, as pale as a sheet of paper and hardly managing to catch his breath. Rhodey stood over him, rubbing comforting circles down his back as he tried to prevent another disaster from happening.
Shuri, knowing that it was a two-person job, sat in the second chair and both teens waited to be instructed. The genius had a feeling that both teenagers could likely figure out the process on their own and felt a warmth in his chest that they still leaned on him despite their own genius.
Next chapter will definitively have more of our former Avengers and you know... a six year old.... Let me know what you think :)
Whomever had dealt with him when he had his panic attack had learned their lesson, as he found that his entire body was strapped to the mattress. Several soft restraints had been thrown over the bed to keep him settled down. One over each ankle, two over each arm, and one over his waist.
Before he could think to answer, the pain that hadn’t quite registered earlier finally caught up to him. With another squeak that he would never admit to having made, Tony’s entire body weight fell onto the Captain.
--------------------
“Okay, after breakfast, I’ll bring the coffee machine to the lab.” Steve was smiling, the look a little too fond as he watched Tony’s observance of the rest of the lab. They would be updating it more as they continued to trust him, let him have more freedom. However, the incident in the training room had been a little suspicious, but the fact that the bots had attacked Tony had settled Steve a bit.
Tony laughed, jumping only slightly when the wall furthest from the trio burst to reveal a suit. But not just any suit, this one was made of vibranium. A very familiar voice rang out into the room from the suit.
----------------
Forcing his eyes open, Tony tried to figure out exactly what had happened since he’d passed out. He’d obviously gained some sort of comfort from one of the super soldiers, and he wasn’t about to reject it in fear that his nightmares would return.
“We have to go!” Peter cried, not even waiting to see if his attack had done any damage or slowed the group down. He just grabbed Tony’s arm and started to run like hell, knowing that the only thing the craft was waiting on was the two of them.
Containing a moan as he sipped on the fresh liquid, Tony finally turned his attention back to T’Challa. The king looked weary, like he didn’t want to share the information, but knew it was better to not withhold what he had to say.
“Who?” The word came out strangled, his hand fiddling with the covers beneath them to hide just how nervous he was becoming.
Peter. He had to keep going for Peter.
Only one suit remained, standing at the other end of the field, facing the team. The power to the machine was slowly turning off, as if it had served its final function. The middle finger delicately held up in their direction.
The sofa he’s on seems to be the one placed directly in front of a huge screen, it’s bigger than the one in his room. There are two other sofas tilted slightly towards the television on either side of where he sits. A wooden coffee table in the middle. There’s a bean bag chair on the ground, along with a few blankets and pillows. It looks like the perfect place for a huge family to sit… and several of the former heroes are staring at him from the different perches.
“Yes sir, the scan will take five minutes.”
“It’s a projector! But yeah, there’s a few movies!” Peter quipped, jumping to his feet to get the white screen up, pulling his tablet out with all the films.
Natasha had been the one retrieving the Quinjet, and everyone had boarded quickly with the intent of getting the man back. Unfortunately, it took off in the opposite direction of the two escapees and taken them towards the middle of nowhere. Natasha had desperately tried to hack the system, but Jarvis had easily bypassed all her attempts and flown the jet right into a forest. The system shutting down when they were right above the larger trees.
“James and T’Challa said we’re landing in five minutes. I may not know them that well, Tones, but I think the kids right, you’re in trouble.” She grinned, turning on her heel and leaving.
Shuri blinked, her shoulders slumping though she wore a content smile on her face. “Well, that was a lot less dramatic then I had thought it would be.”
With a yelp Tony flung himself off the bed, ignoring how the splinters dug into his good foot while his leg threatened to collapse from underneath him. The pain was shocking, and he started to tumble forward when the red light stopped it from happening.
This time, it was accompanied by the sound of metal screeching. The occupants went silent, all trying to find the source while the atmosphere grew tense. Something was wrong.
Loki and Thor had been called away to deal with their own uprisings, to keep their territories in line, and that meant Tony was trusted to wander the apartment alone. He’d been told that the bracelet was a means to keep him safe, so that if he were to be kidnapped from the building Steve and Bucky could easily find him.
What the group didn’t know was that her body had also started to build an immunity to the injection. Like Wanda, she was slowly gaining her powers back. At one point during their time together, Tony had had to throw a rag on top of her hands to hide that her fingers were glowing like embers.
In his fight to stop Peter, the man leaned forward and set the cup on the coffee table. He was shaking so terribly that the little coffee left would have spilled from the edges rather easily.
The two of them cleared the hallway, deftly avoiding open areas in case one of the former heroes managed to attack them. Large pieces of concrete lay scattered across the floor, the sofa they had been laughing on only moments earlier completely destroyed.
Tony didn’t complain that the room was warmer than the beach, knowing that his A.I. had done it on purpose to keep him comfortable. Laying on the thick carpet, it didn’t take long before Tony sunk into a dreamless sleep. The lullaby of the ocean swaying him into the land of nod.
“I just want to see what’s going to happen. Who will come out on top. Will you end up defeating the former Avengers? Or are they going to find your friends and defeat your spirit?” Loki asked.
“Platypus?” Tony’s voice sounded unsure, disbelieving that his best friend was so close. Had it not been a dream?
Thank you for all the comments, kudos, and bookmarks!! I've been trying to figure out how to write this chapter, and finally just decided to release it. Hopefully, its not too confusing. Hope you enjoy!!
Tony, because he didn’t know where he stood.
“So, what can you do?”
“Spider to base, spider to base!” He calls into the radio.
I'm excited for the next chapter, I hope you are too! :) Thanks for sticking with me!
He hated the stutter, the primal fear that had been instilled in his very bones of seeing more people suffer at the hands of such horrible people.
“Whatcha’ thinking about doll?” Bucky startled him, having used his training to sneak in quietly behind the focused genius.
She sounded just like Peter. Excited about the concept of science and the ability to participate in something so new. There was no hiding his fond smile, especially as it grew when he spotted his kid sitting at the board in the computer room, looking ready to do whatever was expected of him.
Across the room, Rogers also takes a seat on the floor, setting the weapon next to him so that it points away from the duo and towards the door. There is no struggle as they settle down, only the sound of Tony’s oxygen mask makes noise as it works overtime to help the panicked man.
They were screwed.
Before the genius could attempt to reply, a shriek drifted from down the hall into the open door of the medical room. It would have made them all start running if it hadn’t been followed by May yelling at Peter for burning the dessert.
Heart still in his throat, Tony was glad to find that they didn’t so much as attempt to fight him on going into the bathroom alone with the child. They didn’t try to sit in, so that when the door closed and the teenager returned, the man no longer had to pretend.
“You ripped away his life!” He couldn’t stop the scream, the sudden outrage giving him energy as he threw himself from the sofa.
At that very moment, Tony realized just how pointless the argument was. Steve Rogers was a man whom believed in his own insanity, that everything he was doing was for the greater good. He didn’t see the people who were too scared to talk badly about the Avengers.
Shaking, Tony ambled into his private bathroom, shedding his clothing on the floor as he moved. The lights in the room were dim, comforting as he stepped into the warm water of the shower. Closing his eyes, Tony let the spray wash away an evidence of the nightmares.
With a frown, the genius glanced up to see a smiling brunette staring down at the two of them on the bed. He finally managed to pull enough away to look at the two, processing what he was seeing.
But he hadn’t arrived in time.
Carol smirked, reaching forward and picking up one of the arrows. “So, Mr. Stark, how long have you been here?” Her words were quiet, not that Bruce was trying to pick up on the conversation. The other scientist had turned his sole focus to the chemicals on his table the moment he’d realized that Carol wouldn’t try to hurt Tony.
The genius frowned, looking down at his plate. He had two options, he could deny it and claim he was only trying to get the soldier to let go, or he could stay silent. Not necessarily deny it, but not accept that he had verbally told the man he was in love with him.
Without prompting the male reached forward and pulled Peter into his chest. His hands were tight as they wrapped around the kid, holding him so strongly that for a moment the kid wondered if he had super powers too.
From the corner of his eye, the man could make out Falcon swooping from a nearby building, what looked like tranquilizer guns in his hands. Fortunately, they hadn’t expected the upgraded suit and what would have shot through his old armor bounced off.
His heart plummeted to his feet, and had Bucky not been carrying him the genius was sure to fall to the ground. At that moment, watching as Steve Rogers stepped out of the car with a familiar faced six year old, tear streaks marked down a sleeping face, every single thing came back to Tony.
----------------
“I still don’t understand what the point of this is,” his voice was flat as he stood at the end of the mat, staring blankly between Peter and Rhodey.
“Mississippi,” T’Challa shrugged at the look he got in return. “Small town, actually.”
“Scale it,” Tony replied, his panic had subsided to pure focus to get the kid through his little trip and back to the bunker as safely as possible. He’d had Jarvis open a virtual map, tracking each of Peter’s steps so they could see where the kid was going. With his communicator on, the action wasn’t too difficult.
Her armor shrunk back into the watch, the suit folding into itself until it formed what looked like a frumpy backpack, that she quickly threw over her own shoulder instead of handing it over to Tony.
Missing the looks thrown their way from the three men in the kitchen, he leaned over and helped free Peter’s arms, so the blanket fell to the boy’s waist. He then proceeded to pull the plate forward so that it was directly between the two of them.
The Captain huffed, although his glare started to soften. “He did hold his own in a fight… although if it wasn’t for that War Machine, we would have had him.”
There was no hiding the groan as his eyes blinked open. His body felt heavy, his head pounding with a terrible migraine from the crying. He felt feverish again and wanted nothing more than to close his eyes and possibly never open them again.
“He isn’t like you, or Carol. He’s a child, for all intents and purposes.” Steve shrugged, like they hadn’t just completely ripped away a person’s entire life. “Loki helped in the process, so that nothing went wrong.”
“We can protect you better if you’re with us sweetheart,” Steve added. One hand rested on the golden door handle of the double doors behind him. “This is the Avengers living area. We don’t want to keep you in the vault anymore, not after today.”
They had enforcers to keep people in line, but sometimes it was fun to go out and take care of the problem themselves.
“See!” Peter cried out, his little hands moving to fumble him up and out of the archer’s lap. He only managed to get up a tiny bit before falling, barely catching himself as his little body sprawled completely over the archer’s legs.
Trying to be as quiet as possible, Tony started to shimmy his left arm so that it would slip free from the restraint.
“Peter was about to take a nap!” Steve snapped, watching as the little boy struggled to sit up and look at the archer.
The blond had settled Tony into the bedroom, making sure he was tucked in and truly asleep before joining him in bed. The genius had woken long enough to give a slight grumble of protest, trying to escape the solid arm that had wrapped around his waist. However, there was no fighting it as Steve’s body spooned him close from behind, holding him protectively.
“Advance it. Less buttons, better coffee.” Tony shrugged.
“Get the fuck off me,” Tony retorted.
“I think you may want to play sick for a minute,” was the only warning he got before Tony caught a glimpse of red stomping in his direction.
He and Rhodey had agreed to go on a mission together, even though Tony was useless without the power of his hands. He had yelled at Peter about being reckless. They had run into Steve and Bucky while rescuing Rogue, but had managed to get away. Peter had called him dad.
Stepping forward, Rogers ripped off the blindfold from the man’s eyes, watching unfazed as the man begged and begged. “He was one of the men that trapped you, did you know that Tony?”
“What’s happening here?” A voice came from the doorway.
“Now! If you don’t grab it, I will.” He was panting, breaths coming in short as Pepper disappeared from the room. Rhodey was telling him to calm himself down, to not work himself up, that he was making himself worse. They couldn’t help Peter if Tony was out for the count.
“See you soon,” the archer places a kiss on his forehead as one would do a child, before all but skipping out of the room, the door closing quietly behind him.
“Who missed me?”
“I’ll take Tony, you can take the kid,” Rhodey admonished, already moving to pick up his friend as Happy lifted the teenager.
“Jarvis, Protocol Panther, now.” Tony couldn’t begin to figure out how he’d managed to say the words, barely hearing the affirmation as the ship started to rise, the occupants trying desperately to get to him.
Tony watched as the looks played over Rhodey’s face, contemplating on whether to tell him the truth or to lie. Instead, the man pressed a button so that the brunette’s bed tilted him into a seated position. “Tones… you… you had a heart attack.”
“I love you too,” Peter returned quietly, curled as close to Tony as he could get.
The genius returned the hug as best as he could, laughing when Peter hummed contently and pressed his face against the man’s chest.
The genius let out a fake gasp of offense, throwing himself back against Bucky and ignoring the chuckling that was coming from the soldier above him. However, his expression quickly morphed from pouting to shocked when the soldier leaned down and planted a kiss on his lips.
There’s water rushing in his ears. Tony doesn’t hear the fork clatter as it falls from his hand, eyes wide as he stares straight ahead, unseeing. His body shakes, horror freezing every muscle in his body as the new information reveals the terrifying truth. He’ll never get away.
Moments later, the green light lit the room. Unlike the people before her, the woman did not scream. It was evident that it took all her willpower to hold it in. Tony did not look away, holding her desperate gaze with his own.
He started to walk away from the king, taking a moment to glance over his shoulder and smile softly. “Thank you, for everything.”
Is Tony right? Will he never leave his kid again? Stay tuned for the next chapter, it'll be.... revealing?
Two days passed before they had let him sit up in a wheelchair to get around the bunker. It wasn’t ideal, but Tony knew that it was already a stretch as he had barely won the argument to get off the bed. They had all grown protective over Tony and Peter.
It was the wrong thing to say.
A hand rubbed up and down his back, reassuring and reminding him that he was not alone. But he needed to be sure; he needed to make sure that Steve was real and not a figment of his imagination.
“I..I…I want my daddy,” Peter hiccuped pathetically, whimpering.
Tony nodded, already understanding what they were doing. “So, when that turns blue, we can transfer Jarvis to the Wakanda database as a whole, rather than in pieces and risk losing some of his data.”
Tony tried to get out of the hold, flinging his head to the side so quickly that the mask once again became dislodged from where it had been placed, falling to the side uselessly.
Shaking his head, the male turned his gaze to the floor, hoping that the lack of stimulation would help him focus again and bring his fuzzy memory back.
He jumped when the soldier chuckled, wrapping his arm around Tony and bringing the genius to curl closer to his chest. “Go to sleep, you need rest after all that.”
He could feel Bucky’s grin against his skin. “Not something, doll; someone.”
Without warning, the girl raised her hand towards his face, ignoring that Tony struggled desperately to get away from the approaching touch. The moment their skin made contact, the room washed away from Tony’s sight. He couldn’t scream, couldn’t struggle, as the scene began to play out in front of his eyes.
Tony hated that he could feel his eyes watering, but used every ounce of willpower he could muster to keep the tears from falling. “I can’t… I won’t stand a chance against them. If they have one of you Pep, I wouldn’t even fight them, to keep you safe.”
It didn’t take very long for the stroking and the comfort of the room with Peter’s gasps and awes to lull the genius under. Drifting between awareness and sleep the male didn’t know how much time had passed between his blinks.
Peter went quiet for a moment. Tony panicked, reaching for his watch to send several suits to go fetch the kid when the barely whispered reply echoed into the silent room. “Uncle Ben.”
He huffs, but takes a sip of the cocoa as he continues to glare daggers at the man before him. Tony doesn’t realize that to Bucky, he merely looks like an adorable angry kitten.
“What are you talking about Tony?” Peter asked.
One hand moved forward and flicked the switch on the music player, wincing only slightly as the blasting sound pounded through the lab. The soldiers had given Tony the ability to play his music again.
Bruce had to know that Jarvis’ data had been stretched thin. The man had to know that the A.I. would need a recovery period before the group could truly get him safely into a non-avengers server. Feeling his breath leave him, Tony sprinted after the monster.
“Please Tony?” The words were spoken quietly, but they had good hearing. Both men froze, and the silence allowed them to hear a muffled voice reply.
“We’re going to meet the man whose been behind all of this. The one who sent me, the… semi-leader of our group, you could say.” Carol shrugged, waiting until the passengers had boarded a train before she grabbed a hold of Tony and tore down the tracks. No one present to spare them a second glance.
“Tony, don’t cuss in front of Peter!” Bucky retorted.
Rogers looked up, something soft in his expression as he stared at Tony. “You’re too good for this world, they really don’t deserve you. To give forgiveness to someone who did something so horrible to you.”
But he could do the math, the calculations. It was unlikely he’d ever be able to go back to those days.
“Hey sweetheart, feeling better?” Steve’s voice was gentle.
“And us in,” Tony grumbled, welcoming the anger curling up in his chest again as he pushed himself to his feet and away from the two men. Approaching Peter, he crouched down and held out a hand to the orange creature, smiling when it rubbed against his offering.
“What’s happened?” He inquired, walking in to see a squad of men already getting the information.
He curls into the warmth of the two super soldiers and sinks into a dreamless sleep. Hoping against hope that Peter will keep him grounded.
“Can we have a movie night?” Peter asked, turning to glance at Tony with a large grin lighting up his face.
Tony crossed his arms and allowed the complete disbelief to show on his face. “You do realize that the state the world is in, is largely because of
No Thor, no Loki, the two of them had gotten extremely lucky during their breakout.
When he got a disbelieving look in return for the words, the blond took a moment to gather his thoughts, grabbing his own cup of coffee.
(See the end of the chapter for
But the ramp was closing, and the plane was lifting from the grass and getting further away from his kid. The genius screamed, his hand coming down and slamming against the metal as he tried desperately to reach his family.
As he raised his eyes to pull back and look at Tony, he froze as he spotted something on the counter. The communicator sat innocently on the countertop. The one that they had used to contact the Avengers, the one that had set off all the events, the one that was likely being traced back to the bunker as they spoke.
With the quickest movements he could muster, Tony ripped off his shirt and staggered forward so he could face the mirror. Peter jumping to hold onto the wall with one hand so he was out of the way but still on eye level with the genius. If Tony had been paying attention, the mere sight of the little boy hanging freely from the wall may have scared him.
After a moment of hesitation he found that he had complete control of his body and took a step forward, trying to figure out where he was. As he moved, a single tree came into view.
Jumping to his feet, Tony decided he could at least put his legs to good work. He moved to sprint away from the man when the building shook, a huge boom blasting through the warehouse to indicate that the self-destruct sequence had begun.
“Peter,” he started, getting his attention. “I need you to promise me something.”
A half hour later, Tony had strewn himself onto the ground of the gym and refused to move. He claimed that they were actually trying to kill him with the amount of exercises they’d pushed him through, and inwardly cursed that he was the only one sweating. The man was fit, but hours upon hours in the lab and his body was no longer used to keeping up with physical exertion.
Tony’s eyes flew open, his hand instantly grasping at the warm limb that curled softly around his waist. The nightmare was still close to the forefront of his mind, and he pulled the arm and therefore the large body attached to it closer so that he could hide in the warmth.
“I’ve tried that kiddo, I got lost.” Tony groaned.
“I would have done the same, if I were in your position.”
“You like Shawarma, right?” Clint is babbling as he moves the chair towards the back wall of the room. “After this, I’ll get you some food. Well, we’ll order out.” He leaned down and puts the brakes on the chair, jumping in front of the genius whom upon observing the new room has turned a few shades paler.
Without pausing to see her reaction, Tony made to spin back around, so he didn’t see how quickly Carol traversed to where he sat. Her hands pulled the chair back so that Tony was looking directly into angry blue eyes. The electricity of the expression made him want to look away, but Carol had already predicted the move and put both hands on his face so that he couldn’t do anything but meet her gaze.
“If I may sir, I’m glad that you have made it here safely,” the words rang throughout the warehouse, although no one seemed startled by the AI’s sudden reappearance.
Slowly, as to not aggravate his already fragile brain, he looks around the room.
The blond soldier looked frustrated, although he didn’t make a move to swipe the cup back. “Look Tony, all I’m asking for here is a chance. You fell in love with us before, what’s stopping you from doing it now?”
Tony had two men that absolutely adored him, and a team that was slowly becoming family and took care of him. He had a lab, and he was allowed to create (to a point) while the group made sure he never forgot to take care of himself. His wounds had healed to scars, and all horror films had virtually disappeared from the television.
They keep you locked up so that you grow dependent on them. They have a sick twisted idea that they’re in love with you, and because you’re only having this interaction all the time, you’re starting to believe it. You’re starting to believe that you love them too.
“We’ll get his wounds fixed too,” Bruce piped up. Turning to follow Bucky and the still screaming Peter from the room.
“I just want you to promise me. Because what is going to pass would have happened sooner or later, and I want to make sure that you know it’s not your fault.” Tony reiterated.
Bucky seemed only slightly upset that his food reveal had been ruined by the words and reached forward to gently lift the top of the tray to reveal a bowl of chicken soup. It looked homemade, like whomever made it had taken a considerate amount of time to create the meal.
It would take a week, but he knew that Rogers and his team were going to come for them. And this time, they would find them.
The bed itself was huge, easily one of the biggest he’d seen. However, the room was just as large and left plenty of room to get around. A door had been left open to reveal a huge walk-in closet filled with clothing. Hues of white, dark green, brown, and gold made up the décor of the room. Plush pillows had been set on the bed, some in disarray on the floor from where Tony had kicked them off.
“You’re looking too pale Tony, we’re going to have Helen check on you soon, okay?” The man seems oblivious to the fact that he is the reason the genius is in his current condition. However, when Tony lets out a whimper as the memories start to flood him again, he is shushed and cradled.
“I’ll take the thirteen percent,” Pepper didn’t even hesitate.
“This will get hot and burn if you’re not careful,” he grumbled to Steve’s pout.
At least if he was engaged in conversation with someone, he could be distracted.
Somethings, the man would refuse to do.
In minutes, she returned brandishing a steaming cup.
“You never ask a lady her age, Mr. Stark,” she conceded. With a grin the blond stepped forward and pulled one of the rolling chairs to Tony’s table, plopping herself down and seeming to relax for the first time since Tony met her. “But let’s just say…. Mid-twenties?”
Unwilling to look away from the little boy, Tony turned from where he was being held bridal style in Bucky’s arms to try in understand what was happening. Shock ran through the genius as Steve lifted a large Iron Man stuffed toy, almost the same size as the child, and lay it so that the boy could wrap himself around it instead.
They had absolutely underestimated how small the town was going to be.
Another unit contained identification cards, a way for someone to start a new life.
“Tony has been kidnapped, I want it on every news channel.” Steve tossed his gaze towards Bruce, whom had been sitting quietly at the table behind him. “Tony and the kid, they’ve both been taken by the tyrant group of rebels and need to be returned, unharmed. Advertise a cash reward.”
“Are you fucking kidding me?” Rhodey hissed, his fist banging on the table, eyes glued to the screen in front of him.
If all the original Avengers were there, where was Bruce?
Thank you for all the kudos, comments, bookmarks. Glad you're enjoying it :) I already wrote the next chapter... let’s just say Tony Stark is quite spunky >;)
Clint, grinning like a loon, waves up at Tony as he moves to climb up a faux building. Ready to take his perch as the large clock in the room starts a countdown.
Tony pulled back, still ignoring how badly his hands ached or the fact that they were quickly turning red from the reopened cuts. His clasped the teen’s shoulders tightly, the fear of the moment still pumping through his veins.
made me watch as people died and told me it was because I didn’t behave for you!” He spat. “Barnes took it upon himself to try to spank me, and
The typing stopped instantly. Tony’s brows furrowed slightly as he realized that his friend wasn’t making the snide comments he usually did when on the receiving end of Tony’s sass. With a sigh, hoping that he hadn’t pushed the man too far again, the billionaire finally cracked his eyes open.
The world spun, and for a moment Tony was afraid of coming out of the vision. But he remained in the warm kitchen, remained with the group that sat around him, remained in front of a man he hadn’t seen in years.
It takes a moment to shove the bag and radio into the little spot and to put the little grate that they’ve removed back. But just when the two turn away and Peter starts to pet Goose the door swings open to reveal Natasha carrying what looks like a cat bed and food.
“I want to fix the coffee machine,” Tony finally spoke up.
A part of Tony panged. He had confessed that he had fallen in love with the man. That a part of him, a sick, tiny twisted part that had preened under their control, had never wanted him to leave. And it hurt, that a part of him still longed to pretend that nothing was wrong, and that he loved the man staring at him so fondly.
Using his free hand, he wrapped his arm around the tiny little body, finally able to let out a breath as the little areas where Peter had jabbed faded into a dull throb. “I may be younger kiddo, but that doesn’t mean you can pummel me into the ground.”
Tony was so busy observing the room; he almost missed the foot coming towards his face. However, Okoye had taken the words of the king very seriously and blocked the limb only inches from Tony. With a cry she began going after Natasha, not relenting as she fought restlessly to stop the Black Widow from reaching the genius.
Tony wanted to scoff. How could they act like nothing was wrong? Like he had a friendship he’d never accumulated with each one. They either were truly delusional, or up to something. And Tony wasn’t sure which one to lean towards.
With a grimace, he didn’t want to sit next to the human lie detector; Tony ambled to the seat and glanced down at the homemade meal.
The genius was sitting in his shock when he found a Black Sabbath shirt thrown over his head to sit gently over his torso. Why wasn’t he protesting the physical contact he’d had with the two men? Was he that afraid to lash out?
“You have homeless people,” Tony growled.
Tony had thoroughly enjoyed eating a half-burnt lunch, laughing through the meal because no one had gotten better in the kitchen during his absence. Informed that his bots had all been safely guarded in Wakanda, he promised he’d teach one of them to cook.
When he looked up again, the craft was already in the sky, moving away. There was no sign of his family anywhere, which must have meant that Peter used his webs to attach to the craft. Tony was proud, his lips lifting in a smile at a small victory even as he felt a large hand touch his midback.
Shaking slightly, Tony manages to snag a bite from the plate. The lights around them are slowly dimming so he misses the way that the winter soldier smiles at the look of utter surprise on the genius’ face. While simple, the food tastes just like he remembered.
A throat cleared, sending two faces flying in the direction of the door. Sam grinned, waving an awkward hand at the two of them. “It’s practice time Marvel, let’s go.”
Nodding towards a pile of materials thrown haphazardly on the ground, Steve waves his hand to indicate that the sad pile of materials are meant to be for the playground.
He didn’t resist as tears of his own started to fall down his face. “You’re my family. You’re the only people in this world that give me a reason to live. I can’t sit by and know that you’re in danger because of me, when I could have prevented it. I love you so much,” Tony laughed, finally raising a hand to wipe away at the tears on his face. “Thank you for showing me that men of iron can bend.”
His eyes wander the area, the concrete walls and tile floor, the single drain installed right in the middle. He knows what the room is for, what it was created to do. Generally, if someone was in such a place with another person, one of them was not coming out alive.
One of his hands raised into a fist, the sharp pang of cuts reopening doing nothing to curb his anger. The hand grabbing his own, however, stopped the movement.
“Whatever happened when I passed out yesterday must have taken a toll,” he admitted.
Without hesitation he met the smiling blue eyes from across the room, now understanding Barnes’ hold on him as he struggled to run forward and snatch the old Stark weapon from the Captain.
It was two in the morning when Jarvis’ voice startled Tony awake.
However, five minutes in the woman lost her battle. Unable to do so any longer, Tony whimpered and started to openly sob, body shaking so badly that it wasn’t hard to convince Bucky to turn him away from the sight. The genius buried his face in the crook of the man’s neck, curling into himself as much as he could to look away from the terrible loss of what had obviously been a wonderful human being.
“I can swim, daddy, I’m okay.”  The little voice trying to join Bucky’s cause. “I’m okay.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m not prone to danger,” Tony scoffs quietly, hoping that the conversation isn’t heard by the rest of the team. Unfortunately, Clint snorts from a medical table over.
Anyway, I hope you enjoy this chapter. I had a hard time writing it, but things are still going forth. Thank you so so much for all the reviews, kudos, bookmarks! You guys are absolutely the best!
Natasha paused to look back at him, “positively ecstatic.”
They had left him the coffee machine, alongside it the music player that Steve had given him the night before.
A cat! Why would the kid be looking forward to a cat? After all, what could a cat do to help them in their situation?
He dodges several times, yelping as he hears the bots getting closer. He can also hear the team, chasing behind them in an attempt to stop the things from killing him.
“I hope your cat finds you kid, I’ve heard animals are smart like that,” Tony quickly caught on.
I had a hard time writing this chapter, but I think I had to get it out there. Something about splitting them up was just hard to try to write, but now... now comes the interaction we've all been waiting to see. Let me know what you think :)
One-hundred and sixty-eight hours.
Bucky stood, also tense as he took a step towards the genius.
Breaking his gaze away from where he was held, Tony silently pointed to the ground in the hopes that Bucky would set him down. Instead, the soldier gave him an impish grin and pivoted on the spot, making for the door after a silent conversation with Steve that the genius couldn’t decipher.
“Don’t tell me,” he murmured.
“Steve?” Tony murmured softly.
Watching Peter concentrate, the soldier came to the quiet realization that the child was most definitively a genius. But was he too smart for the age that they’d gotten him to? Every time he read an instruction, Peter would count how many pieces of Lego’s he had left, and of what color, measure them to the ship, and then nod to himself before continuing.
She frowned, “but they’ll know that you built this suit. There’s no way that they won’t realize that you’ve helped me get out of this situation.”
“Yeah,” Tony agrees. “As long as we have each other.”
“I want the blue blanket!” Peter shrieked, his little hands reaching out to snatch the requested object from Tony’s lap, who had moved the blanket to the sofa.
Tony glances at him with wide eyes, realizing that the brunette won’t look away without some form of affirmation. He nods only once, but it’s enough to earn him a smile just as bright as Steve’s before the soldier digs into his own plate. Instead of focusing on the film, Tony is enamored with the food on his plate.
“You’re not going to win this fight. We didn’t fail, you did. Tony Stark is the best in the business, and he’s going to take you out. You’re never getting him back. Never.”
There were several metal doors throughout the corridor, each flanked by a pair of armed guards that didn’t dare look at the duo. They kept their gazes straight, and Tony didn’t withhold the comments that they all looked like they were constipated with their attempts to look mean. It didn’t go so well, but at least no one reacted by shooting him.
And maybe, he’d start to feel a little less helpless when he had power tools back in his hands. Nodding, the genius gulped down the rest of the coffee and handed the empty cup to Steve, taking his time to slide out from the covers and pull himself to his feet. He managed to stay up straight, even if he swayed for a moment.
Brows furrowed, Tony looked at the two again, seemingly realizing for the first time that Happy, May, and Peter were missing. “What-” He cut himself off, eyes widening as the memories finally flashed before his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And he’ll have his aunts and uncles to help out, it’ll be a real childhood.” The blond added, “and this time he can learn to use his powers properly, with all of us around.”
Immediately the genius agreed, nudging his kid when he noticed the slight blush that had lit up his cheeks. He received a pout and a half glare before Peter started after the princess.
Waiting until everyone was out of the room, Steve finally spoke up. “Tony loves us Buck, I’m not letting him get away.” He turned so that he was facing his lover, the brunette still looking murderous where he stood. “He told me he loves us, and she took him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The ceiling above the transportation dock was created to open, and had done so as the building started to collapse to give them a clean get-away.
Two figures were near the tree, one stood leaning, the other sat and threw what looked like an apple up and down. They were both relaxed, and as Tony came nearer he realized that he vaguely recognized one of them.
Sauntering behind Shuri, he listened as she rambled about how the system update had originally gone. How they had temporarily released Jarvis so that he could control and help Tony escape from the facility in which he was held.
Tony’s trembling worsened.
They walked for several minutes before stopping at two metal doors, which Shuri pushed open after swiping her bracelet against a security scanner in the hallway.
Without hesitating, and realizing that the kid was right, Steve once again asked Bucky to leave the room with the boy. There was a large level of protest, but Tony was so gone he didn’t hear the cries.
“I’ve figured it out,” Carol’s voice broke the silence of the lab.
If you have any suggestion on where you think this could go, let me know! I'd love to get some ideas! :) You're all fantastic, thank you!
“And… my fam-the others? They escaped?” He tried to hide how desperate he was for the answer, the sudden knot in his stomach telling him that he was headed in the right direction. He would pursue Loki’s thing later, the barrier was obviously magic.
He didn’t understand why he had seen the house already; when this was the first time he’d visited. But at that moment, with the three males nearby cracking jokes at each other, with Pepper and May smiling gently at him, Tony was home.
“It’s a mildly scary show, is there something you’d like to watch? I know you don’t really enjoy this kind of stuff.” Steve grinned, remote already up as he paused the show to glance down at Tony. When all he got was a shake of the head and the genius curling closer into the super soldier, Steve pressed play and dropped his hand.
Bruce threw up both hands, as if approaching a wild animal protecting its young. “I just want to look at his hands, Tones. Make sure he’s okay.”
When Tony awoke for the second time, he found that they hadn’t left him alone.
Tony frowned, throwing a look at Bruce as he was set down on the toilet lid.
“And finally awake,” came an amused voice from the door.
Without protest, the little boy allowed Tony to wrap him up like a burrito, realizing how much he’d frightened the other.
“You’re part of my family too J, and I can’t have you disappear because some crooks think it’s okay to hack you and tear you apart.” He explained, a part of the plan he’d kept secret from the machine. After speaking to the young princess of Wakanda, she had gotten several servers ready to transfer Jarvis.
It was clear the king was apologetic for accidentally having sent Tony into a panic attack.
After a bit of quiet, Carol looking as if she were deeply considering something, the girl turned to Tony with a very serious expression on her face. He tilted his head, trying to gauge what was about to come out of her mouth.
The smile that lit Roger’s face was cruel. “At eight then, tonight. I’ll only bring the original team. Send the coordinates.” He turned his back to the camera, making his way over to the teenager and grinning from behind the kid. “And Tony, any tricks, and I’ll kill him.”
Tony hadn’t argued, only curled into the bed and tried desperately to set his mind at ease to allow sleep to come. It didn’t.
Tony, having seen the look and knowing something was happening, was quick to throw his plate up and use it as a shield. The sausages and eggs that had been put on the platter by Steve quickly falling to the floor and his lap. With Steve on his other side, the blond barely got a speck of food on him.
“That was…. Weird,” he murmured.
“I’ve missed you, you idiot.” She murmured, gently running her hand through his hair as she stood back up.
Tony finally managed to make a sound; it was a pathetic scared whimper.
Because at the end of the day, he didn’t have to fight anymore.
“See who, kid?” Tony asked. “Who could be so important that you’d risk going out there, without saying anything?”
Clint was going to bury him alive.
And Tony laughs.
Before anyone could even think to tease Bucky again or to come up with a solution on getting the child to eat, Peter twisted in his chair and brought both fists down to smash into the oatmeal bowl. Having made the mistake of putting the plate directly in front of the child, Bucky took the brunt of the meal. With the superhuman strength still intact, the bowl immediately shattered as both oatmeal and plastic flew in every direction.
“Peter!” It was Bucky, who had jumped on the spot and started to jog after the toddler. Soon enough Steve, Tony, and Sam had joined in on the chase.
He’d shut down the creation of weapons that Howard Stark had started. It was disappointing to see that his old friend had turned to money in his own genius. The fact that Howard’s son had turned into what Steve had hoped his father would have been, was another story.
As he had predicted, it was some sort of winter cabin, with huge hallways decorated in warm colors. However, the décor only caught his attention for a moment before the genius was turning towards a sound from what looked like an open area of the hall. When he reached it, not bothering to check where he had come from, Tony found himself at the top of a large staircase, the railing thick to prevent anyone from falling to the first floor.
“You’re not going to murder me, are you Captain Marvel?” Tony raised a brow, glad that he could walk steadily behind her without being pulled or pushed, now that they only had one way to go.
He couldn’t remember falling asleep, but as he slowly started to gauge his surroundings, he realized that he was curled up on a mattress. Opening his eyes to look at the alarm clock, the man frowned when he was met with an obstruction instead. With a grumble he started to move back so that he could get a better look at the form in the dim lighting, only to be met with a wall and an arm wrapping around his waist.
“I know,” she smiled. “But it’s also kind of fun to get to boss you around and have you listening.”
Shaking his head, he moved towards the dresser that they had gotten the clothes out of earlier that morning, he didn’t need much, just a light sweater and a pair of socks. A pair of sneakers laid by the dresser neatly waiting for him.
A huge window to the left side of the bed revealed a large patio on the floor below. It was a place where you could have a lot of friends over, with what looked like a fenced off pool and a hot tub nearby. A green hill slopped gently down past the patio, leading to small lake with a dock and what appeared to be a row boat.
The work is intricate, with little flowers and leaves carved into the wood, but sturdy enough that it would take a good amount of force to break. It was embedded into an opening in the wall, framing the placement of the piece of furniture as if whoever had built the room had done so with it in mind.
A silent understanding rang between the two men at that moment. Both understood the struggle the new world had brought with it, and both had universes hanging on their shoulders.
He sees Peter, staring at him in surprise completely covered in blue foam. He sees Rhodey walk into the lab, pivot in place, and pretend that he hasn’t seen the mess.
“I’ll make you a deal. I’ll send you coordinates, we’ll do the trade tonight. I’ll come alone, in the suit, and switch places with Peter.”

“It should be as simple as-“ he’s immediately cut off when the window explodes in front of them. The bots have been programmed to go after the Avengers, and there’s one in the booth.
Tony doesn’t jump, he doesn’t! Well, he would never admit to it as his head whips to face the newcomers. The movement is too fast, and the genius immediately sinks into the pillows with a groan, his hand flying to his temple and eyes slamming shut to stop the wave of dizziness that hits.
The team had started to call her by the nickname that Tony had given, and Carol hadn’t argued.
An overwhelming sadness overcame the genius, and Tony deftly ran a hand across his face. His shoulders hunching forward.
Bucky looked halfway between shocked and amused.
Without his helmet to block him from the rest of the team, Tony had even started to joke with Sam at dinner. He’d pulled a prank or two with Clint (although the punishment hadn’t been harsh, as the two super soldiers had been pleased he’d started to fit in). He’d even spared with Natasha when she’d claimed to the two soldiers that he had to at least have the means to protect himself if something happened. It was one of the reasons he still had some muscle left.
Tony feels a panic attack starting to come on, the oxygen mask substantially helping keep it under control as he cranks his neck back and forth looking for an exit. Instead, he finds the door opening and the last people he wants to see entering the room.
“Welcome to Wakanda,” Tony laughed.
“Tones!” Their hug was brief. Tony using their embrace to turn Peter so that he could push him into the suit.
(See the end of the chapter for
What if they didn’t come back? What if they left him all alone? His parents had done it. Jarvis had eventually gone. Even his chosen family was gone.
Peter, albeit confused, nodded and started to speak. “Jarvis is Tony’s Artificial Intelligence system. He’s….” It was obvious the boy caught on, an abnormal gasp sounding from the machine. “You’re brilliant!” The kid exclaimed.
With another bang the metal dented enough that the last rays of the dying sun flooded the warehouse floor. Tony sprung to his feet, unable to be of much use in or out of a suit with his hands in the condition they were in.
“Let’s follow these instructions then,” she looked towards Bucky, whom immediately took a seat across from them. Clint looking somewhat rejected as he pushed himself back to the floor where he’d gotten up in his panic, next to Bucky so he wasn’t beside Peter.
Knowing that at that point, he had nothing to lose, Tony turned towards the soldier and tilted his head. Would Bucky honestly tell him what had happened if he asked? Would the man lie or actually understand just how lost Tony was at the moment?
I hope you enjoyed this chapter..... I mean, what's the worst that could happen?
And while the two soldiers looked on, trying to understand the reaction, Tony could only wonder if all the good people in the world were gone.
He curled up that night in bed and tried to keep his mind off of where they were keeping Carol for the night.
“Tony?” Steve finally looked at the man in the eyes and froze upon what he saw.
With no warning, the blond pivoted on the spot and fired the weapon. A burst of green light filled the room before the worst screams Tony had ever heard started up. Just over Roger’s shoulder, he could see the man start to melt. It was meant to be slow, first his hands, then his legs, and slowly his torso. The screaming didn’t stop, and Tony couldn’t move, didn’t dare move.
“I’ve seen enough online videos to figure it out. Besides, do you think any of them have actually been around a kid before?” Peter raised a brow in a mimic of Tony’s own face, the expression absolutely comical on his cherub face.
“Hey! Look! That must be her!” He tilted his head, taking in the woman.
Rhodey had reluctantly taken the two family members away while Iron Man fought against the group of former heroes. JARVIS had deployed another suit when the one he wore started to get too damaged, started to stagger under the attacks. But he was still holding his own.
He’d built rooms that would mirror the outside world, so that if someone had to survive in the bunker, they wouldn’t feel trapped as he had in the dark cave at eighteen. And he had invented technology to catch the outside world’s streams, so that they could see what was truly happening on the outside.
“Are we doing anything with our brains here? Or are we just going to sit and chat about a non-existent world?”
Without saying a word, Bucky lifts Tony from the bed and out of the room, going in the opposite direction that Clint and Natasha disappeared to. He tucks the genius’ head into his chin, throwing Steve a look that speaks volumes as the blond catches up to the pair.
“Why?” He spat out.
Apparently, his laughter was contagious. Soon enough everyone, even Peter, had joined.
The shower was quick, and soon enough Tony (whom had been lost in his own thoughts) was dressed in soft sweatpants and a shirt, curled under the duvet of the bed. Steve had taken their time in the bathroom to retrieve some cream for the bruise around Tony’s neck, and had gently applied it to the tired man’s skin.
“Why were you watching those movies?” Bucky inquired gently after several minutes of silence.
“You’re a tyrannical ruler!” Tony threw up his hands in exasperation, the blanket puddling on the floor beside the chair. “You take what you want, without any regard for the other person! You don’t let society choose their governing class! How many people have died in order to create this perfect world you keep seeking? How many more have to die?” He didn’t realize that he was screaming, the anger getting the best of him.
Like a light switch that had suddenly been flipped, the change in demeanor was almost immediate. Peter nodded eagerly with a huge grin on his face as his eyes twinkled brightly. Quietly, the child wondered what Tony would think when he explained what had happened, and how he was quickly getting them to eat out of the palm of his hands.
Doors were being kicked open, cleared.
--------------------------------
Plus, he wasn’t truly worried, it’s not like the person was going to be smarter than him.
After all, a few hours messing in a lab with kid geniuses, what’s the worst that could happen?
A comfortable silence fell over the two, Tony slumped against the counter with his head resting on his folded arms. The blanket forming a warm cocoon around his body.
When Iron Man had flown a missile into the sky and almost died saving the world, he had started to look into the man. A few years younger than Steve, Tony had quite a reputation. His company donated a lot of money to charities around the world, and a lot of his inventions had helped poor communities start to prosper.
He had been on the verge of snapping when Steve had lifted two of the large beams over each arm without so much as a struggle and moved them to where Tony needed. His smug smile when he caught Tony staring with his mouth slightly unhinged made the man want to test the strength of the hammer in his hand.
Bucky had appeared, taking Tony away to dry him and make sure he was in warm clothing. He got very little help from the man, who was clearly in a state of shock, but managed to get Tony curled under the covers quickly.
Tony felt his shoulders slump, bypassing the kid so he could take a seat on the toilet lid. He rested his head on his hands, quietly gazing at Peter as most of his remaining energy started to drain.
Natasha burst through the door behind the soldier, her gaze set directly on Tony as she rushed at the suit. Without thinking Tony threw up his hand, panicking only slightly when the blaster didn’t react.
Tony didn’t mind that Carol (now fondly called Captain Marvel by the entire team) had started to disappear in the afternoons to train. He was a little jealous that he couldn’t do the same, but knew that it was a good way for her to find her escape. Tony understood he was a captive, and he missed his family terribly, but in the end… was he really that miserable?
Knowing that he was healed but wanting to find an excuse to look at him in the face, Tony gently tugged at the kid.
May smiled gently, thanking them as she and Pepper wanted to finish the film. It was just another night in the bunker, one where the news didn’t send any of them into a full blown panic. One where Tony and the rest of their little makeshift family enjoyed whatever time they had left. Because no matter how far they were from being found, they all had the feeling that it wouldn’t last.
A mug sat empty on the workbench in front of him, white with slight coffee stains on the brim. Tony would never admit that it took several minutes to process when someone refilled the cup with his elixir of life.
Tony’s brows furrowed, and he couldn’t help himself as tears started to stream out of his eyes, even if they were closed. “I miss Peter,” he admitted. “I miss my kid. I want my kid.”
Ironically, Tony had flown out in the dead of night on his birthday. With the help of Rhodey, he had safely secured Peter and May Parker a ride to his bunker. They had not expected company.
“Jarvis!” He’d made to move forward, but was stopped by a hand dropping on his shoulder. Before he could turn to face the owner, he heard Peter release what sounded like a battle cry before the kid had soundly kicked Steve across the room and into the green monster.
“We did it to protect you!” Steve finally hollered in return.
It made sense, with the way the world was, they surely couldn’t stay in one place for too long.
“I guess you were right Stevie, he really is smarter than his dad.” Bucky Barnes drawled, gaze focused on the wall of screens in front of them. Several people sat at computer monitors, trying desperately to find some sort of trace of the Stark genius.
“Start a spark, and let it blaze like a wildfire!” Whomever the woman was, it seemed she wasn’t going down easily. As she spoke she started to struggle against the chains, her words frantic as the weapon slowly lifted in Roger’s hand.
Everything he had likely missed started to run through his mind. Had Peter started shaving yet? Had Rhodey or Happy taught him the proper way to do it? Had the kid created some sort of invention in the lab with the king’s sister that Tony hadn’t gotten to see? He’d missed movie nights, game nights, even sparring in the gym.
“You opened your stitches… again.” Bruce threw a hand on his forehead, shaking his head. “Sam, you and Clint hold onto each other and follow me. Nat, I think you’re good to walk on your own?”
“Tony, what is going on!?” Steve screamed over the music, looking worried.
Loki still wore a look of amusement as he observed the scene, although he didn’t speak as he watched both Bucky and Steve fuss over Tony to check his injuries. Bruce, whom had shown up last as he returned back to being a little guy, scoffed when he saw the slight red hue on Tony’s bandages.
“How many suits do we have left after the whole fiasco?” Tony inquired, picking up the shampoo and throwing it on as he listened to Jarvis respond.
A hand was softly rubbing his back as if to reassure him.
“I couldn’t leave you ag-” Peter started to explain when a knock sounding gently from the door abruptly cut him off, both males freezing like statues at the sound.
While Tony would have enjoyed denying the men, if it meant being left alone with Peter again, he’d jump at it.
“Oh baby,” he murmured. “I’m so sorry. I’m so, so sorry.” The words were repeated, a gentle lullaby that slowly lulled Tony into a state of ease. The man sinking underneath the darkness again.
Unable to stop the blush that bloomed all over his face and down his neck, the genius quickly nodded and tried to not so subtly throw himself forward and out of the man’s hold. Steve’s arm was solid, and he only grinned before tugging the genius towards the table where Bucky was placing Peter into a highchair.
“I brought some soup and a sleeping pill,” Bucky spoke gently from over Steve’s shoulder.
Leaning over, Bucky gently took the blanket and untucked it from Tony so that it was pooled in his lap, hands free to use the fork provided to eat the meal.
“Don’t stay mad too long babe,” Bucky called, his footsteps heavy as they faded from the room.
The soldier immediately threw a glare in the archer’s direction, huffing how he wasn’t getting any help from the rest of the table.
The man smiles gently, setting the book on a side table that Tony again doesn’t remember seeing. He then lifts an old Stark phone model and presses a few buttons, before setting it on top of the now abandoned book. Not once does he move Tony and seems a bit relieved that the genius hasn’t tried to move either.
She was right, the rest of the ex-Avengers were appearing from the building, looking ready to fight with weapons Tony had not worked on. Obviously, they’d discovered that he’d messed with the upgrades.
A green fog enveloped them both, muting the blasting music and showing Tony just how quiet the room was without the sound blasting.
Tony vaguely recalled a similar moment when he’d first been brought in and feared what would happen if his PTSD was worse than before. What kind of messed up reality had he landed in?
Tony awoke with tears streaming down his face.
“We have to talk about our next course of action,” T’Challa spoke softly, breaking the comfortable silence of the room.
The kid, not needing to hear anymore, ran forward and threw Tony over his shoulder using his super strength. He didn’t heed any protests, sprinting down the hall to the room where the rest of their team was.
Instead, the genius was focused on the arc reactor now shining freely in the air. It was small and hard to notice at first, but there were purple lines starting to appear around the reactor, like outreaching veins. It was something that he’d had to fix once upon a time, in secret from the public, and it could get ugly fast.
Without thinking, Tony reached forward and slammed his mouth against Steve’s, hoping that it would bring him down to reality. It helped, but when he backed away all the fears and anxiety of his current situation and what he’d witnessed rang in his head.
Tony got so lost in his work, that he didn’t notice the presence that had entered the lab until a hand had gently rested on his shoulder.
Thank you for all your wonderful kudos, bookmarks, and comments! I love seeing that you guys are enjoying the story. I have a few things planned out, but sometimes the chapters are a little harder to write. Enjoy this one!
Tony lay on his side, his back to Bucky as his front faced Steve, both men watching him with concern in their eyes.
Jumping out of the shower, not bothering with the fact that he was dripping wet, Tony rushed to the sink and froze.
“Grilled cheese and tomato soup, it’s lunch time. I was going to go wake you after I finished eating, but obviously, you’re set.” She turned away, getting back to her meal like having Tony show up halfway through her lunch was routine.
Knowing it was wrong but seeing as it was his only source of comfort, the genius buried his face into the shirt in front of him and curled as close as humanly possible to the soldier. “Steve,” the name came out broken.
Why wasn’t he chasing him? Why was he letting him get away?
--------------------------------------
He wouldn’t admit that the tone was joking. That he was having an amazing time with the family. He would admit, however, that it was due to Peter’s presence.
Steve Rogers sat on an armchair near the bed, one that hadn’t originally been placed in the room. He wore grey sweats and a white shirt, white socks adorning his large feet. He had one leg bent up so that it was hugged closer to his body, the other resting half off the armchair so that he had somehow managed to get his entire large frame on the piece.
“Jarvis, turn on the sound,” Tony asked, watching as five desperate faces peered at him through the glass. They were crying, all of them, and Tony felt his heart break.
“Hey, do you guys want to hear about the time I hacked into Rhodey’s work computer?” Tony chirped, sitting on a box crate that Peter had put at the bottom of the ramp.
Steve found himself pleased when the genius gave a whimper at being put down, but it didn’t last long as Tony curled closer to the man under the spray of the shower.
Knowing that keeping his eyes open will only cause discomfort and possibly nausea, Tony closes his eyes and lets himself get lifted from the bed and into the chair. Immediately, a heavy blanket is thrown over him, whomever does it tucking the edges over his shoulders and feet, so he is completely covered.
Tony was warm.
Before anyone could think of reprimanding Peter for his behavior, Tony couldn’t stop the snort of laughter that escaped his throat. The sound seemed to get to Clint from across the table, because as soon as the archer had wiped his face of the oatmeal, he started to chuckle.
The sound of footsteps echoed over the speaker, and the rustle of the com being lifted raised Tony’s heart to his throat.
Tony doesn’t notice any of it.
Tony had remained on the bed for quite some time, fighting over the idea that the kisses hadn’t bothered him. In fact, he had to fight the feeling in his chest that was suddenly longing for the two men.
The teenager nodded before Tony could even finish the sentence, jumping to his feet. “Let’s do this old man!”
It had been after watching an old animated cartoon about a rabbit and a detective, where they were using a chemical to melt away the cartoons from the world. Tony would have never wanted it to go into production, the terror of something like it in the world had been a horror he hadn’t been ready to face.
Immediately, Peter closes the door after her before setting up the stuff she left for the ca-Flerken. Tony shakes his head and pulls himself up, he settles on the little mattress they’ve set up for the kid and watches as Peter gets himself ready for bed.
After a moment, Tony shook his head slowly and groaned when the room spun. Of course, he’d be caught in some weird version of a panic attack as soon as he remembered that the man trying to comfort him had also killed an innocent kid.
The brunette had never thought that a person’s tears would break his heart, but for the first time in a long time he felt a bit of remorse as the sniffling child clung heavily to him. The feeling was foreign, and Bucky was quick to push it away when words finally started to come from the boy in his arms.
his biological child.
The warehouse shook again and he flinched when something hit the back of his head, a piece of the ceiling. Tony let out a cry of pain, blacking out for a moment.
“I was not freaked out!” Peter turned, lightly shoving at the genius’ shoulder. Both brunettes missing the movement on the top right of the screen as two figures moved through the high crops.
Instead, Tony jumped back as numbers upon numbers started to slide across the screen.
“Excuse you?” Pepper returned, no coffee mug in sight but a tray stacked with oven pizza’s in her hands. The other two following behind with similar trays. “Just for that, I should make you a salad.”
“Ever done a mission like this before kiddo?” Tony asked softly.
“What if instead of whatever lunch Bruce is planning today, we do a barbecue? I’ll make you whatever you want on the grill, and we can have a picnic outside!” The man noticed the boy’s gaze slowly flit towards him before quickly moving back to the pieces in his hands.
For a mille-second, he’d even believed it.
Baring his teeth, Tony shook his head, “I didn’t kill people to stop the manufacturing.”
Tony could see himself, and saw a small glint of determination he’d lost reflect back at him. He was more than fine, laying back down and claiming he wanted to go back to sleep despite the sweat.
“We don’t have an official name, but we’re known as the rebellion.” Carol grinned over her shoulder, opening a door to the right just as the lights of another train started to light up the area.
Plucking a cookie from the plate after taking off the plastic, Tony didn’t hesitate to dip the cookie into the liquid. He noticed that Peter’s big brown eyes were solely focused on his face, wanting to see if Tony liked the baked goods that he had helped make.
Pretending that he had simply been jolted awake, the genius threw open his eyes and looked in feigned confusion around him. First, he noticed that Steve had taken a seat on the worn chair, what looked like a sketchpad sitting idly in his lap.
Peter had been there. The kid had called him dad, and Tony had never corrected him because it left the man feeling absolutely loved. And honestly, he loved Peter as if he
“Your fear of water didn’t start until after that too… the torture must have been terrible,” Steve’s voice was gentle; almost caring in the way he spoke. The concern in his eyes didn’t make Tony feel better, especially as something else was in the mix.
Tony shrugged after a moment had passed, realizing that the kid wasn’t wrong. And Peter had always been intelligent; they could brush off any abnormalities to his intellect.
“The system…” The voice was quiet, the lead technician not daring to make eye contact as he spoke. “That… Jarvis… He created actual artificial intelligence. We didn’t have the capability, we weren’t prepared to-”
Once again, the kid responded, although Tony got a feeling that only part of the motion was an act.
The man panicked, “I…. I’ll aim for sooner sir!”
“Buck, take him and get cleaned up, I’ll take care of Tony.” Steve spoke calmly from behind the genius.
Bruce, having seen the wounds close over at least two shards before Tony had pulled out what he could, was on his feet and moving forward in an instant. He froze, however, when on reflex the genius tightened his hold on the crying child and flinched away.
“Hey sweetheart, how would you feel about helping us with some machines?” Steve leaned forward, setting the sketch pad on the nightstand as he smiled gently.
At first, Peter had been hesitant to play with any of them, but when Bucky had pulled out a large box with a ship design on the front, he’d gone starry eyed and excited.
“A civilian has broken curfew, sir.” Steve glanced down at the surveillance that they had taken of the figure. It was a teenager by the looks of things. The kid was dressed in dark clothing, but other than breaking curfew, nothing seemed too suspicious about the situation.
Carol frowned, leaning back although she didn’t loosen her grip on Tony’s hands. “What?”
“That’s not it, Tony. We want to raise him, with you, as a family.” The look on Steve’s face was one of a man who had just stated a solid plan, not one of a person completely deranged.
He glanced down at the faded letters on her shirt, making out only two visible letters. C.M.
----------------------
Every single pillow minus two had been thrown to the floor, the covers thrown haphazardly over the two bodies on the bed. There had been absolutely no hesitation when they had gotten comfortable on the bed, used to each other’s company and the cuddles. Heck, the two were always cuddle bugs in their time in the bunker, nothing would have changed that.
Tony opens his mouth to speak, to call out for the man who raised him, but cannot as the sight starts to fade. He hears himself scream, wanting to remain with the man who cared for him, raised him, loved him.
Tony merely tightened his hold on Steve’s shirt, as if he were afraid the soldier would simply disappear and leave him alone again.
Stopping just inside the hallway, Bucky smiled when the genius pointed to the floor again and quietly told the soldier to put him down. Without argument, he gently set Tony on his feet, although he kept a firm hand on his shoulder so that he wouldn’t attempt to go back towards the room.
“Never do that again!” He bellowed.
Something in the atmosphere changed very quickly. One moment Barnes was holding him in comfort, the next the arms started to become constricting. Whatever was coming, Tony wasn’t going to like it. He didn’t even attempt to hide the panic when Rogers stood, bringing the weapon with him. He had created the design for the weapon as a joke, to test himself to see if he could really do it.
Finally looking up from the blueprints of his latest invention (they were underground, not dead) Tony turned his attention to the press conference televised by the news. He vaguely registered Peter throwing himself onto the sofa on the left, but chose to stare into the cruel blue eyes of a man that had once been a symbol of freedom.
But then again, Tony couldn’t deny the small pang in his chest that still came from even glancing at the soldier.
“So, what? You’re saying that if someone does something that you don’t like that they can just… walk away?” Tony leaned back on the chair as he had already emptied out his cup of coffee, half the omelet still cooling on the plate.
Curious about the shipping containers, Tony made his way towards the large pile, grinning when he came across several open doors.
The bunker was too far underground to be registered by heat trackers. There was only one entrance, but several emergency exits. The only way to access the entrance was to find the secret door located in the subway. The person then had to follow a long tunnel and find the right door. They’d have to pass several coded doors, several metal contraptions, before they could even make it to the vibranium enforced door.
