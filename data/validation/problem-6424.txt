Tony begins, “I have lust in my heart, I’ve been fantasizing of this person for months now. I’ve been thinking about them constantly and being close to them has caused me to find oulets to let out this feeling, to fuck other people.”
Slowly, Steve started to move, small jolts of muscle that barely soothed the need to seek completion until he was moving in deep pumps. They were too lost in each other to pay attention to the telltale signs of an approaching orgasm, consumed with kissing, touching, and sweet nothings. Steve came deep inside of her while whispering how much he loved her, she cherished those words more than the prospect of life the come gave.
telling me isn’t going to give you a free pass to doing what you want and dealing with the consequences later. I need to know what’s going on. I can’t lead to the best of my abilities if I don’t know where my team members are, or what they’re doing. Just tell me what the change in plans are, or that you need to take a detour, so I can compensate. Like yesterday; if you’d told me that you needed to go help a civilian, I could have immediately given Thor the orders to move Clint out of the situation he was in. Instead, I had no idea that you weren’t on your way and Clint was in trouble because Thor almost didn’t have enough time to get there.”
“Anthony, breathe.” Rhodey barked, and that was an order so Tony did. He sucked in air until he choked on it, stopped thrashing and instead sat there and trembled while he tried to get in another breath.
He stopped, again, a few feet from Clint; waiting for him to make a move.  He stayed absolutely stock still and Tony whined.
“I’m not sure how long you’ll be staying with me, but we’ll get you a collar anyway. How about blue?” Peter held up a plain blue collar, and Tony huffed, swishing his tail. “No blue? Alright. How about red?” Tony leaned forward to investigate the red collar, which conveniently had gold studs all the way around. Perfect. Tony agreed, lifting his tail as he bopped the packaging with his nose.
Tony, for once in his life, had no answers. For now, he decided to get up and rub some of the blood onto the corner of the coffee table, and pretend that he’d run into it at some point in the night. Tony would be granted some time to consider his predicament if the suspicion was taken care of.
Two days and Tony had made no progress. The first day, he’d jumped with the trash bin again, and he’d been chased out by an angry Steve with a lawn chair. The second day, they’d realized his trash secret, and had put the bin inside the gate to thwart him. Animal control hadn’t been called again, though it was likely because Tony hadn’t been in the yard for more than five minutes since the last incident. He was still going to count it as a win.
“Relax, Cap. We’ve got his back.” Clint said, patting Steve reassuringly on the shoulder. Tony had a brief moment to realize that Steve had used his first name before they were being hustled outside and into the car. Steve stood on the porch with Bruce, arms crossed and face set in a frown, as they watched the van pull out and start towards SHIELD headquarters in D.C..
didn’t want to be found. They were all lounging in the living room as he recounted the tales of his search.
He kicked his chair, and it smacked into the wall with a dull thwap. The kid sat down on his bed and put his head in his hands. Tony, feeling oddly guilty after the display of aggression, bumped his head into the kid’s arm. He heard a sigh.
“I would need confirmation from Coulson himself, Mr. Parker. And Mr. Stark doesn’t own any cats, anyways. Where-”
“I’m fine, sour-patch. Right as rain.” Tony said, wishing he could gloss over that little episode without anyone talking about it. Luckily, Rhodey always knew what Tony needed.
Footsteps padded down the hall towards the room, and he closed the application just in time for Peter to stroll back in. He looked curiously at the cat, before scooping him off the desk and petting his head.
“For brevity’s sake, yes to all of that.” She turned back to the navigation screens, and began flipping switches to initiate the start-up sequence.
It felt like forever before Tony saw the first building- or, well, what used to be a building. There was a good reason for this town to be abandoned. None of the buildings were taller than two stories, and few without extensive damage. A good number were just crumbling walls outlining a pit of rubble and bricks.
“There you go. No fun-vee, no desert. You alright?” Rhodey asked, and Tony shook himself out, getting Steve to loosen his hold.
“Hi puppy, are you okay?” The guy cooed, crouching down to Tony’s level and reaching out a gloved hand. Up close, it was easy to tell how hand-made the guy’s outfit was. Yikes.
Tony took in the whole situation, looking for ways to free her leg without sending rubble down on top of them. He could barely see through the sheets of plaster and aluminum vents that had fallen down, but he was just the right size to wiggle through to her knee. There was a beam midway down her shin and Tony could tell that the bone was at least broken. It would hurt like a bitch to get her out.
. You and Steve are totally dating, right?” The rest of the cats dissolved into quiet chuckling, while Tony gave a small nod. It wasn’t…
Tony urged her along as fast as he could, but they only made it down the steps to the second level landing before the building gave way.
“None of what you did was your fault.” Tony whispered after it was quiet for too long. Clint didn’t react besides a shuddering hiccup, and Tony rubbed the side of his face against Clint’s shoulder.
That was kinda dramatic but basically I haven't given up and I'm still going strong. Please leave a kudos or a comment if you enjoyed! I really really love feedback and I respond to all the comments I get, whether you have a question or are just sending kind words. Thanks for sticking around!
The next day they had to be briefed about the mission, and Tony complained the whole way up to the helicarrier. Clint and Natasha were fairly annoyed by the time they sat down in the meeting room.
“Alright, handsy, put me down! I won’t bite you again, just put me down.” Tony meant for it to come out as threatening, but his meows sounded more like cries. He was promptly deposited on the bed (which was unmade and smelled like dirty laundry, but Tony was glad enough to be free that he ignored it).
Tony decided to camp out next to the decommissioned robot, investigating it to see if he could figure out where- or who- it actually came from. He couldn’t get it open without any tools, but the casing was telling on its own. Smallish head compared to the body, cheap materials, military grade weapons system, no intention of using human pilots… It all reminded him of someone. Someone who was supposed to be in
Thank you for sticking around this long! Please feel free to leave a kudos or comment, they're very encouraging and help me stay motivated! Also, if you saw any typos or mistakes, feel free to let me know. I edit my own stuff and sometimes miss things. Thanks!
Tony lifted his tail in success when Dum-E came rolling back with a glass of water. He didn’t end up spilling (they were both delightfully surprised) and set it down for them to drink.
Tony dabbed the pad of his paw in the paint and started to write, being as neat as he could so that they could read it. All of them crowded around to watch, faces set in frowns as the sentence took form.
He didn’t mention it, though, and just did as he was told. The last thing he needed was to squabble with his ‘superior’ right before a who-knows-how-long mission. The quinjet touched down a mile or so from their target town, and as soon as it was twilight they prepped to send him in.
Tony was left alone and he rolled onto his back, staring at the ceiling as the clock ticked and the occasional nurse walked by the window.
Tony had heard enough, so he crept away and went back to the main communal area. It made him uncomfortable how much Clint seemed to see right through his media persona, but he could put it aside to deal with more pressing matters. On top of them hating him, none of them trusted him. It stung a bit, since he’d never truly let any of them get hurt during a battle. There might have been a few last-second saves, but Tony was a multi-tasker like that. He knew what he was doing. He was a professional, godammit!
“Very well, sir. The shipment should arrive tomorrow morning.” Phil finished his conversation with Fury and wandered off to organize a search party for Tony, and the cats each made their way to their respective rooms. Thor remained in the living room to guard Loki, though they doubted the god could do much harm as a cat.
“Steve, he’s not lying. This is actually the real Tony.” Bruce said, giving Tony a quick scratch behind the ears before he stood up and cracked his back. Steve looked at him as if he’d sprouted a second head and Bruce sighed. “He knows the codes for Harlem and Laundry Day, I think that’s plenty of proof.”
Tony pretended that he hadn’t thought that, and was immensely glad that the collar hadn’t spoken it aloud. He must just be elated from the vindication he was feeling at the moment.
“It’s an intubator, in case he stops breathing on his own. It looks different from a regular intubator since it’s standard issue for a vet’s office instead of a hospital.” Harley said, going back to his clipboard. Clint made a face.
“Widow, there’s a batch making their way up 44th.” Tony warned, shooting up and over the buildings towards the center of the chaos. Thor, Hulk, and him were taking care of the biggest cluster while Clint tracked the smaller groups that broke off, and Natasha and Steve maintained the the perimeter. It was almost a week since their last battle and this time they were fighting back hordes of large, vicious grasshoppers. And Tony wasn’t one to exaggerate the mundane, so when he said that the grasshoppers were large and angry, he meant that they were all the size of your average sofa and desperate for destruction. They chewed and ate anything they could. Including, but not limited to: street signs, parked cars, lamp posts, buildings, humans, parking meters, outdoor patio furniture, each other (Tony gagged when he discovered that one), and deadly flying suits of metal. Tony had already lost a thigh plate and a few shoulder plates to the beasts. They couldn’t necessarily fly, but they could jump and glide high enough to snatch Tony unsuspectingly out of the sky. He did his level best not to get grabbed again but it was a bit inevitable, since he couldn’t watch all of them at once.
The code was completely fucked. Loki must have known something or other about computer programing, because he managed to botch up almost half of JARVIS’s subroutines and turned him offline. He also changed all the overrides, which had Tony wanting to yank out his hair. Or, well. Fur.
Thor had been out of the house more often than not, returning to sleep and hang out with them on occasion. Apparently Loki
“Loki?” He asked, finally sitting down to lick the fur on his chest to hide his embarrassment. They all sat down as well as Steve nodded and explained. “Tony?” Bruce looked behind them, but the mechanic was nowhere in sight. They all shook their heads.
Tony glanced one last time at Natasha and Clint before he trotted down the ramp and hurried to the edge of the clearing and into the woods. He heard the ramp close and when he turned to look the quinjet had gone into stealth mode; you wouldn’t know it was there unless someone told you. Tony turned back to the trees and took a deep breath. He wasn’t exactly nervous, but he hadn’t really been on a stealth mission before. So he stayed low and made sure not to cause too much ruckus with his heavy footsteps and bulky vest.
They set out soon after everyone was ready. Coulson had a backup team of agents that were scouring New York for any energy signatures from Tony’s arc reactor, while Maria, him, and the cats worked as a unit, checking where they had projected Tony’s flight path to land him.
“What happened? Why is there a bloody rag in your bed?” He asked, frantically patting down Tony’s sides and then his face, which caused a full-body flinch from the contact of hands on his cut. Steve parted his fur gently and sucked in a breath through his teeth. “Well that can’t feel good. What the hell happened?” Steve asked, turning Tony’s head to look him in the eye. “Where did your collar go?” He frowned as he felt the fur around Tony’s neck.
“I don’t think you have the right to this cat, or to any of the others, for that matter.” Coulson and Maria both shifted slightly in their seats, exchanging a swift glance. Natasha and Clint jumped up into Hill’s lap while Thor wedged himself on the seat in between them. “Nobody who experiments on animals deserves to own any. Period. So I don’t know who you actually work for, or where you came from, but-”
In other words, Tony lasted two days before he tipped over a trash can and went at the spilled contents like it was Thanksgiving at the Jarvis’ residence.
Natasha seemed satisfied with Tony’s dryness and she sat back, good ankle popping as she stretched it out.
“This dog says he knows Anthony, and that he wishes to speak with him.” Thor said gravely, and the rest of the team looked at him like he was nuts.
“I know what we can do to inform Coulson of our predicament. Remain here, friends.” He raced over to the emergency staircase, and began to descend to their rooms below. Steve and Bruce looked at each other in confusion. He took a few minutes, and they finally heard him returning, the rhythmic sound of metal thumping up the stairs announcing him. When Thor stepped back into view he was dragging Mjolnir, walking backwards with his teeth gripping the cloth handle. When he came to a stop beside them, he curled his tail through the loop and shimmied underneath the hammer, balancing it on his back while his tail kept it steady. Steve was silently impressed that he could still lift it as a cat.
but Tony sprinted past him and kept going, through the kitchen and into the dining room. He managed to get around Natasha by darting under the table and back into the kitchen, but as soon as he rounded the island she was there, and she grabbed him around the ribs and lifted.
“Be careful, Tones.” Bruce said, turning the TV off and gently maneuvering himself out from under Tony.
Tony wasn’t sure what time it was when he woke up, but the first thing he noticed was how tight his chest was. It was night, it was completely dark, and he could barely breathe.
It had taken them awhile to wrap Loki in his cape, but after that it was a breeze to drag the bundle to the door and carry him down the staircase. Clint was in charge of helping Thor, and didn’t look very sorry when he ‘accidentally’ bumped their burden on a few of the steps. It also helped that he couldn’t hear Thor when he was scolded.
“Coyote, Agent Dawson is going to do one last equipment check before you leave.” The woman who hooked up his vest sent him over to a man tapping away at a tablet, who held up a finger until he was done typing. He then pressed a button on his comm and did a check- everyone was on and operational, so Tony had to sit there for almost a minute while Dawson fiddled with his vest.
“Tony, seriously!” Steve shouted, skidding as he slowed down to round a corner without running into anything. Tony was already halfway down that hallway and going as fast as he could, but Steve had more traction and was faster in the long stretch, managing to scoop Tony up as they reached the end.He had to quickly slow himself down to keep from hitting the wall with their momentum.
“That was awful.” Natasha said, getting up and slinking in Coulson’s shadow as he motioned for them to get into one of the vans. Clint trotted after her with his ears back and the rest of them filed past, Tony hopping in last and wedging himself underneath one of the seats. He didn’t want to talk to any of them after that. He wasn’t even sure if they’d want to either, since everything Coulson had said was right.
As soon as he made it outside he ran head-first into something solid and human, sending them both to the ground. Tony got back up and tried to leap over the living roadblock, nearly face-planting in the dirt when it grabbed the front of his vest and held on tight.
“Oh my god, all of you guys?” She put a fist against her mouth in thought, and then stooped to pick up Tony, who purred like a motorboat when she started to scratch his chest, fingers skating around the reactor. Her eyes watered a little bit and her nose was starting to turn pink but she didn’t seem to mind.
He turned to face her and pushed her hair out of her face. He cupped her cheek, wiping the tears away. He would miss her, too. He would miss her and Jim the most.
Pepper closed the distance between them and put her hand on his free hand. Her fingers were cool to the touch.
He cupped his cheeks and kissed him slowly. He couldn’t be careful with his words, and he was never delicate, but he could be purposeful. He wanted Tony to know how much he loved him, how much he missed him, how much he thought of him while he was away. The mission had been longer than the last and had left him feeling dreary. He hadn’t thought there would be someone waiting for him.
Of course, my father didn't feel that way. The memory of my mother haunted him. And so, looking into my eyes, he only saw reflected his worst nightmare: a woman covered in ash. Of course, it was too much to bear.
Using what little momentum he had, he turned, and reached for the handle just out of grasp. He held on, tightly. He was running out of air and breathing erratically. He needed to open this hatch, he needed to get inside, but it was stuck. Of course, it was stuck. He had made it this far; he wasn’t giving up. Kamala was counting on him.
Soon, he would think back on this time. The memories of this night and the ones to come would sustain him. He would remember his home and his friends. He would remember their parting words, and their words of encouragement.
The Fates had taken his one true love and had left me in her stead and for that, he could never forgive them. And I wasn't worthy, so he could never forgive me.
I was swimming with the current, and he swam behind him, quick to catch-up. We stood; the river being quite shallow, made it easy to stand. Turning to face him, I watched as he licked his lips. The water droplets fell from his hair onto his bare shoulders.
“I had come with the news that my brother had escaped Asgard, but I knew not that he would travel here.” Thor’s hand gripped Mjolnir’s handle tight and Tony didn’t envy the hammer at all. “Though I am not surprised.”
What was with that, anyways? JARVIS had to know by now that their Tony was the wrong one. Loki could never completely mimic him- it was an illusion, there was no way he knew enough about Tony to get that good.
“Alright, alright, don’t panic. He can’t have gone far. I’m mobilizing a team of operatives who will be there shortly, so please give them some room to work. Once I’m done with my meeting I’ll be right over to help, okay? I’ve got to go.” Coulson hung up without saying goodbye, and they all sat there for a few seconds, angry and unable to do anything about it.
“So, what have we got here? You’re a beautiful boy… Tony, did you say his name is? He seems in really good condition.” Hannah picked up his feet and examined them, checked his teeth, his ears, and his eyes. She hummed to herself before jotting things down on her clipboard and then turning to Steve when she pulled off the Hawkeye hoodie and gently peeled back the gauze from the stitched wound on Tony’s shoulder. “This is really recent. What happened?” She asked, turning back and investigating it closer.
Steve had set up an alert for JARVIS to tell them whenever Tony made it over the fence. It was the only reason he had been so quick on the draw the second day.
’ Tony thought desperately, putting both his paws on Thor’s shoulders for a moment before backing up and beckoning him forward with a paw.
He gasped from the pain in his head, and had to sit and breathe for a few moments, shaking as he tried to control the pain. It eventually subsided and he sighed. Apparently, Loki had been casting a spell in addition to the scepter’s powers. He hated that asshat.
“Oh, that’s where you went. What’s up, Tones?” Clint said, scratching Tony behind the ears when he sat down next to him. It always made Tony irrationally happy when he heard the nickname- it had only started the week prior, and before then Rhodey was one of the only people comfortable enough with Tony to use it.
“Got it, be there in a sec.” Bruce lowered the phone when Steve hung up, and made an unenthusiastic face at Tony. “Hopefully they can keep this under control, but I have to go just in case they need me.
Tony wondered. He darted between its legs, and kicked out the back of the knees. If it was indeed modeled after his specs, it wouldn’t be able to recover very fast from a blow there.
“Aye, Steve. Loki cast a spell upon us in his rage, which seems to have altered the forms of us all. Even Loki himself.” Steve’s vision was different now, and he had to get up and walk around to see everyone. There were four other little bodies on the ground, and satisfied that they were all uninjured, he returned to his post next to Thor.
“What were we invited to, a party?” Fury asked, elegantly taking a seat at the other end of the table with both his aides on either side. “Also…” He pointed at Spider-Man, “This guy? You’re a hard person to get ahold of, Spider-Man.”
“Because I’m your teammate, and I’d like to call myself your friend.” Tony said, inching forward a bit. Clint turned away and wiped furiously at his face, as if he was angry that he’d cried. Tony was intimate with the feeling of thinking you’re weak, or pathetic, or anything less than perfect because you couldn’t hold your facade together.
“So what’s the plan, guys? Are we all going to make sad eyes at him until he relents? Because I haven’t graduated from Torture University yet, so I couldn’t help you there.” Peter joked. Tony could tell he was nervous about confronting Loki, the being that could cause so much devastation in mere hours.
The room settled in a comfortable silence, besides Tony’s rattling breath and the shuffling noise of Natasha and Clint’s cards.
Hi all!!!! Thank you to anyone returning, and hello to anyone new! I'm quite excited about how this story is coming along, and I hope you're liking it! Thank you so much as well so everyone who's left a comment <3 <3 it makes my day, no lie!! Enjoy the chapter, and I'll see you around next week!
happens again, you’re being put on temporary leave when things are put back to normal. All your behavior today was completely out of line.” Coulson finished, standing up and leaving them all there in stunned silence.
Steve adjusted his arms, one under Tony’s chest and one under his belly as he maneuvered them through the rubble and down to street-level.
“I always am, Bruce.” He replied, watching Bruce retire down the bedroom hallway, to do whatever it was he usually did when he wasn’t working. Tony decided to take the opportunity to nap before dinner, hoping to dispel the lasting nervousness from earlier in the morning.
“Anthony must be put to rights.” Thor called, straightening up as he looked over to where Steve was leaned against the wall. “Though I must also continue my search for Loki. He can not have left Midgard, and now that we know he is near, we shall find him.” With that he strode out of the workshop and turned to go back up the stairs. Natasha walked in as Thor walked out, phone held out in one hand.
“At least Spiderman is there. It would have been much… worse….” Tony trailed off, a sudden memory smacking him upside the head.
“Thanks bud.” Tony gave him a quick pat on the claw before he finished off the rest of his food, tossing the empty carton onto the scrap-metal table and getting back to work.
“COULSON!” Tony all but screamed, scrambling in Peter’s grip to be let down. The poor kid was freaked out, and he clutched at Tony to keep from dropping him. At first, Coulson didn’t seem to notice, but then his head dropped down to his feet, and he turned, making eye contact with Tony. “COULSON, COME BACK!” Tony wiggled even harder, but Peter juggled him from hand to hand and refused to let him down.
, and after the events of the days before, Tony had settled into a depression that seemed ready to stay. At least Pepper made it a little easier, stroking the fur of his back and humming sadly.
Tony picked up his pace and singed his fur a few times in his recklessness. It payed off when he reached the collapsed rubble to see Natasha’s bright hair in a small pocket underneath a large portion of the upper floor. He could only see her head and shoulder but she was breathing.
Tony took a minute to get his breath back while the nurses checked his vitals and the clipboards and Clint rested a hand on his back.
“Alright spider-guy, debrief room is this way. Bruce, would it be alright if you grabbed some sandwich stuff from the fridge downstairs? We’ll get settled while we wait for Fury.” Steve said, gently steering the kid with a hand on his shoulder.
The kid plowed on, completely unaware that Tony was in fact a highly-functioning previously-human cat, and would actually understand what he was saying. “I’d better be careful, I guess. Are you bugged, kitty-cat?” He added in a baby-voice, scratching behind Tony’s ears, which flicked in irritation. “Well, I suppose I should think of something to call you. Hmm… Tommy?” Tony stopped kneading, giving the kid his best unimpressed glare. “Alright, alright, not Tommy. Lincoln?” Tony turned him down again, but he kept throwing out names anyways. “Jessie? Robin? How about Ishmael? That’s a really good book. Anyway… Let’s try some bands. I don’t think cats can listen to music like people can, but I don’t think you really care. Angus? Rick? Malcolm? Vivian?” Tony finally flicked his ears and sighed, settling his head on his own paws. The kid sighed in return and let his hand still on Tony’s back. “Let’s just go with Vivian. Def Leppard, huh? The name is elegant, though. Like you!” His voice got high again as he cooed, booping Tony on the nose.
Tony growled, unable to pick up on the noise with all of the extra input. He could tell it was on a lower floor, but where exactly, he couldn’t figure out unless he could track the noise.
“I’ve got to go check something in the lab, but I’ll be back up again in a bit.” He said, shuffling out of the foyer and leaving Tony alone with Steve.
“There are different sides to Stark, according to Pepper. And after she pointed that out-” Clint was thrown over Natasha’s shoulder, and hit the mat with an
“What’s wrong, Clint? Why are you baking so late at night?” Tony asked, softly, since the silence felt akin to some testy creature- one he didn’t want to wake. It felt like a wrong word would make everything so much worse, and upsetting Clint further was the last thing Tony wanted to do.
“What, fido? Is timmy down a we-LL SHIT!” He yelped, grabbing Tony suddenly around the middle and swinging them on a web into an alley. “Stay, boy!” Spider-Man said, then turned and leapt back towards the robots. Tony was impressed as he watched spider-guy dispatch the suits rather efficiently, gloved fists punching right through their chest cavities one by one. That seemed to be a vital part of their hardware, because each one was shut down from the blow.
as he went to get out the cookies, setting them on the racks to cool off. After he put in the next batch he then proceeded to climb up onto the fridge and crouch there with a slingshot ready. He had a whole bag of what looked like marbles; he had one loaded and he kept his gaze trained on the door, except for when he glanced at Tony and waved his hand as if to say,
That… was Steve. Right! Steve was there! Tony dragged his head up, and wrenched his eyes open to see Steve frantically shaking him and holding the shield over them like a shrapnel umbrella. His face was covered in grime, and his eyes were wide and alert. Scared.
“Well, don’t let him see your master bathroom. That tub is the size of my pre-war kitchen.” Steve padded over to join them, where Peter was watching them gather in front of him with alarmed interest. Tony bunted Steve’s face with his head, and they both accidentally started up a purring-bunting-feedback-loop, which lasted until everyone had gathered and Clint practically smacked Tony in the eye with his tail. Steve leaned back and gave Clint a Look, but Tony shook himself out and dialed down the purring.
“Thor, why did you let the dog in?! We’ve been chasing him off for the better part of this week-” Steve stepped forwards as if to grab Tony, but Thor put out an arm to block him.
“Tony?” Bruce leaned back into the doorway to frown, holding up a toothbrush. Tony leaned forward and took a step, but his heart was starting to race and he was panicking, he didn’t want to go in, he didn’t want to be left in the dark again- he whined, and backtracked a few feet.
“Director, this smells like a training run. We could do something like this in our sleep.” She rested her fingers on the manilla folder she had been given, frowning. “What else is going on?”
“Ready to be briefed, boss.” Clint called, walking in with Natasha in tow. Everyone took seats around the table- including Tony- and the two of them gave him strange looks.
“You haven’t torn anything, so you won’t need surgery. Just a really bad sprain.” She began, pointing at the image of his foot that Tony couldn’t make heads nor tails of.
“We’re in here! Help!” A man’s voice called and the agent tapped on her comms, checking on the backup she’d requested when they went in.
“Alright, we can do red.” Peter picked out a matching leash and harness, and Tony barely had time to voice his displeasure at the notion of exercise before the teen was bouncing into a new isle. “Last thing- cat litter. Aunt May has some spare totes somewhere that we can use.” Peter grabbed up a random bag and led the way to the checkout counter. The cashier glanced over at Tony with mild interest before she began to scan the items.
“That makes sense. Jarvis is still down, right? Do you know how long until you get him back to normal?” Steve whispered, looking around the room. It was still strange not to have the pleasant (albeit sarcastic) voice interjecting with data and clever quips.
“So how do you know all this? And who are you, anyways? Are you actually a dog?” Bruce asked rapid-fire, but Tony knew exactly what to say, stepping on the tube of paint to get more and start a new sentence.
“I hope it’s not too long. I still have bruises from Karamay.” Natasha sighed, turning off her phone and sliding it back into her pocket. Tony watched them all from his bed and felt his chest start to ache; he couldn’t do anything as a dog, and his status had been changed from ‘Active-duty Consultant’ to ‘Suspended’, which he hated. He missed being Iron Man, and it had only been three weeks.
“I know, I’m sorry. I won’t do it again.” The teen turned on his puppy eyes and dialed them up to full blast. Tony was done for.
Tony didn’t even have time to let go before someone clocked him in the side of the face. He was so startled that he let go of Loki’s leg and jumped back, barely managing to dodge the follow-up kick.
“Why are you up so late?” He asked, and she glanced over at the microwave, which read 2:19 A.M. in bright green font.
“Alright, I need to see you walk a bit. Don’t put pressure on it if it hurts too much. This is just to give me an idea about how bad the sprain is.” Hannah said, stepping back as Steve lifted Tony up and set him gently on the ground, taking off the oxygen mask to keep him from tripping.
It had been nearly a month since his first stealth mission, and this time, there was something in France- though he was going sans-assassins. Steve was immediately anxious that Tony had to go by himself, but he could use comms now, and he wasn’t helpless anyways, thank-you-very-much. Clint and Natasha hated it, too, but there really wasn’t much to be done. Natasha was benched until her new leg boot was off, and
appreciates my jokes. How are ya, Tones?” Clint asked, dropping his arms to lift Tony’s chin and tilt his head.
Shunned by his only friend on the team, Tony wandered off to find someone else to annoy. Almost twenty minutes and two laps around the mansion and he got nothing.
“You’ll get hypothermia if you don’t dry off. I’ll get some towels.” He said, rummaging around in the linen closet. Tony reluctantly stood there and shook, while everyone took a towel and helped to scrub him dry. They all had pinched expressions on their faces and Tony wanted nothing more than to escape, crawl underneath something, and hide until they forgot what a pain he was.
Tony kept up an internal monologue all the way to the town. It took all of his concentration to avoid branches and make sure he didn’t knock into anything as he weaved between the trees and over rocks. He saw the old stone facade of a building through the trunks and he hustled through the last stretch until he was standing in front of what he could tell was an ancient town; it had seen better days, with bricks scattered across the ground and paint peeling from all the walls, entire buildings literally crumbling and collapsing in on themselves. Vegetation was crawling up the brick and the whole town seemed to be holding its breath. Like it was waiting for something.
Or, well, not so much. If the Avengers were going to call Animal Control because he was lying around in their backyard, he wouldn’t make much progress getting into the mansion. He needed a plan- and fast.
The circumstances were almost identical to the last mission: abandoned town, strange energy signature, yadda yadda. Tony was surprised, however, when he saw that Rumlow was supervising the mission. he was part of the STRIKE team, and had no business on a non-combat mission. Plus the fact that Tony knew Steve hated him really didn’t help anything. The others were starting to rub off on him in their own little ways.
It was so entertaining to watch the two of them battle as little animated characters that Tony forgot altogether to mention the tesseract.
Most of the streets had been cleared of civilians, though the bugs were starting to chew through the buildings, and they wouldn’t be safe for long. Tony ran a few probabilities and wanted to swear at the results JARVIS gave. All of the available options resulted in civilian casualties and he refused to accept that.
“Something else happened. I haven’t seen him worked up this bad since the Chitauri.” The whole team winced at the mention of it, but she stopped, sighed, and picked Tony right up. Everyone stared at her in disbelief as she carried Tony- all 110 lbs of dog- and retreated out of the kitchen and all the way to the second story library, leaving the team to wonder just what had happened.
“Well he was turned into a dog about two weeks ago-” Steve started, turning to look at them. Pepper shook her head and cut him off.
“This isn’t pretty.” Hannah put her stethoscope on again and listened for almost a minute as Tony’s chest heaved. It was like he was back at thirty percent decreased lung capacity, so he hadn’t really been worried besides the burning in his throat and nose. The oxygen mask was really helping and he wanted to take a nap with it on. Preferably for a long time.
“We haven’t had a discussion about that yet. Spider-Man is just helping us debrief, but he’s welcome to talk to me after about that if he wants. So-” Steve changed the subject to their data, pulling up recordings and scans from throughout the fighting.
Tony shifted impatiently in his seat and whined, pulling against the straps they always insisted he wear. Clint glanced over his shoulder and shook his head.
“Dude, slow down, you’ll trip and break your-” Steve didn’t catch the rest of Clint’s sentence, because he overstepped and was sent tumbling down the lower half of the flight. Clint’s pawsteps pattered down to where Steve was sprawled on his side. “What did I tell you? Are you okay?” Clint leaned down until they were almost nose-to-nose, and Steve groaned, rolling away onto his stomach. He felt a bit bruised, but otherwise he was fine.
Tony took a breath and paused. He didn’t feel like his chest was on fire. He felt around and didn’t feel a hole, didn’t feel the empty casing cold and dark like after Obadiah reached in and-
The shout seemed to trigger something, because the black cat flickered out of existence, and a junior SHIELD agent materialized, sprawled out and unconscious a few feet from the door. Loki was nowhere to be seen.
An hour of running later and Tony was slightly less wound up. He went back to find the living room with only Natasha and Clint left, who were playing a board game on the coffee table.
Coulson was tapping at his phone the entire time they ate. Maria talked with them a bit; Bruce was the only one who didn’t know morse code, but Thor happily translated for him.
Steve was incredibly Not Impressed when he found them a few hours later, but he seemed to understand as he helped Clint clean up the mess and toss the unused dough in the trash. His only question about the whole incident was,
“What? What else would he be? He ain’t a robot, or a clone... I don't think.” Clint scoffed, but Natasha and Steve were contemplating a bit more heavily.
He thought, dashing into the street and back towards the fighting. If he was lucky, an Avenger or Spider-Man would spot him and come to the rescue.
“Her name is Angerboda, and I am trying to save her.” Loki didn’t meet any of their eyes, even as Thor gasped.
Tony typed out, leaving it at that. Peter quickly changed the subject and started wandering around the lab, letting Tony sit on his shoulder again to supervise. JARVIS- ever helpful- chimed in and described the projects as they walked by, but the end goal seemed to be the wall-length row of Iron Man suit displays. They spent a few moments at each one, until Peter came to a stop in front of the Mark VIII. It stood out from the rest of the collection because of all the damage it had obviously sustained. The faceplate was gone and the body was dinged, scratched, and dented all to hell.
Nurse Harley left and the other three members of the team scrounged up some plastic chairs to wait in. Tony glanced at them in confusion and Clint shrugged, pulling out his phone and tapping away at the screen.
- and it didn’t get better from there. He’d only be able to manage five or six beats of silence before he was shifting again, making Clint rub his eyes and causing Steve’s fingers to twitch where they were holding his book.
After almost a minute of Bruce assessing the situation, his hackles dropped, and he relaxed a little.
“I’m alright. Let’s go.” Clint chuffed in exasperation when Steve got up and shook himself out, but he followed nonetheless.
“Damn. I wonder if he was born enhanced.” Bruce said, shaking his head. “If he isn’t careful, he can be out of this field before he’s even really in it. Maybe we should keep an eye on him.”
“With all due respect, Hawkeye, Agent Jackson and I were the only two grounded, and one of us had to stay at the jet. If I hadn’t brought Coyote, a family of five would have died.” She said, and there was a beat of silence as the last unspoken question seemed to cross all their minds.
“What’s with the yelling, Cap? It’s barely six in the morning.” A groggy voice piped up from the doorway, and they both turned to see Bruce standing there, rubbing his eyes.
“We’re working around the clock to sort this out. Getting the Avengers back into commission is our top priority right now, so hopefully they’ll be back to normal relatively soon.” Coulson assured her, before they said their goodbyes and Peter hung up. There was a brief silence before JARVIS decided to move the elevator, taking them down to the holding level. Everyone but Pepper got off, and she gave them a short nod before the doors slid shut and she was lifted back up to the private quarters. Peter’s phone had been pocketed and he had Tony and Natasha cradled with both arms as they made their way down the hallway.
He hopped down off the bed and up into Peter’s lap. “Let’s get this straightened out, Pete. Steve has probably paced a rut into the livingroom floor by now, and I’m sick of sweaty workmen traipsing all over my house.” Tony reached out a paw for the keyboard, but Peter pulled it back.
The bomb was carefully placed in the middle, and Tony gave it a final nervous look before he bolted out and locked the door behind himself.
Tony stopped fighting the team about every single thing they did. He stopped getting up on the furniture, ate his kibble and occasionally threw it up in private. He slept in his dog bed and didn’t shred anything else after the living room fiasco. It was nearly a week of him being the ‘perfect dog’  of sorts before he saw any progress.
“Aw, nuts.” He muttered, leaving Tony’s side for a few moments. He wasn’t sure what Clint was doing and he focused on drawing in air while ignoring the burning in his chest. It was reminiscent of when he’d nearly drowned thanks to a gigantic grasshopper, the bastard.
As it turned out, another twenty minutes, and the security upgrades were complete. Tony swept the files into his ‘Completed’ folder with a flourish, and hopped over to the discarded armor with a bit more pep in his step. He loved repairing and working on the armor; it was something that never got old. He’d been cranking out that software for too long and this was Tony’s equivalent of taking a break.
Natasha and Clint both frowned but didn’t mention it again, instead listening intently to the information they were given on the Starkpad Fury had brought.
When they first met, Tony was lonely and dying, and not a soul cared, not even his Board of Directors. Ms. Potts had called them “callous fucks,” and Steve hadn’t heard a woman use such profane language before, but he couldn’t deny, it was warranted.
He found the crisp, cool air refreshing. June would bring with it the summer heat. He looked forward to sunbathing, to boat rides, and the water beneath his toes. He looked forward to hiking and stargazing from the mountaintops. He had never been much of an explorer, but things were about to change. He found himself in such a unique circumstance. How many people could say they were preparing to leave earth? How many people could say they were preparing to travel through space?
And she was of the sea. Her blue eyes were the color of the Tyrrhenian in winter. Her long, soft waves fell around her delicate face. They were the color of obsidian. In the sun, traces of gold were visible. Vulcan seemed to have a hand in her birth, or so the rumor went. When she smiled, the world was set aflame. And when she danced, the grass beneath her swayed.
He smiled mischievously. I always liked that smile of his; the slight smirk of his lips, the way his eyes crinkled.
After some time, he confessed to Jarvis and Jim. He told them the truth. He told him what had happened, what had really happened. How he had been deceived.
He didn’t mean just now either. She was always looking out for him. Their friendship had had its ups and downs, but she had never stopped keeping an eye out for him.
“No! I’d prefer it if you didn’t. I don’t want… Don’t let anyone see you come into the building, Steve.”
Once inside, behind the locked door, she pulled him into a kiss. Her lips were soft, and she cradled his head as if he were something precious. He gave into the kiss, relaxing at her touch.
“And you do that admirably and well,” I said. “Now, come sit with me. I have something I’d like to share.”
The condensation coated his fingers. Why hadn’t he thought of taking a napkin when he had the chance?
Herculaneum was the wealthier of the two cities and being that Maria was born into wealth and married wealthy, it was only fitting she died there instead.
Life on the ship hasn't been easy for Tony, who's still getting used to things, and struggling to let go of that which he left behind.
He would never get used to seeing Gail and Bucky as old and frail. She was always full of life, but these days, she was coming to terms with her husband’s worsening condition and inevitable death. She would be a widow.
He saw it as a parting gift, and he hoped she’d understand it was always hers. He had just been holding onto it because he couldn’t hold onto her. On second thought, maybe he didn’t want her to gleam that. It was too much to bear and much more so once he was gone.
Just then, Steve fell into his arms. If he hadn’t been in the armor, they would’ve tumbled to the floor. Luckily, Tony could support his weight as he was still in the suit.
He pulled away. He didn’t want to bring up Sunset. He didn’t want her to think it was more than a passing thought. He was reminiscing, but he didn’t want anything to do with Sunset. Once had been more than enough.
When he returned, Gail and Bucky were seated on the couch speaking in hushed voices. Steve had intruded enough. They’d been polite enough to invite him to dinner, but dinner was over, they needed their space, and Bucky needed to rest.
Oh, he could’ve used the time to repose, but he needed to keep working. If the gears stopped, they would jam.
Although many thought he would find himself another wife, he never did. Often, I was told I resembled her. It brought me solace. She had left her mark on the world, and I would try to honor her. I like to think all my best qualities came from her.
Terrified and distraught, Tony was left to pick up the pieces. No one understood. He was conflicted.
He had wanted to get back, shower and shave, and then come up to see Tony. That was, until he was in the elevator, and without meaning to do so, had pressed the button for the penthouse.
Steve entered from the parking garage, he entered the code for the penthouse, and the elevator took him straight there. The doors opened and revealed… A mess.
If anyone knew, we were none the wiser. They kept their silence, for which we were eternally grateful.
Annoyance emanating from his person. He took a swig of whiskey from the tumbler in his hand as he walked to the kitchen. He set it down roughly, the amber liquid sloshing across the counter.
That night, he slept in my bed. He caressed my cheeks and told me all the things he loved about me as my eyes grew heavy and the moon rose high in the sky. I slept in his embrace, surrounded by his warmth. His placed his palm on my waist, grounding me.
He couldn’t believe he would soon be leaving earth. Next year, he’d be celebrating his birthday on a spaceship with a crew he hadn’t yet met. He would be living a different life. For so long, he had wanted to escape. He wanted to leave the box to which he was confined, for the prodigal son was expected to follow in his father’s footsteps.
I would know the smell of him, the curve of his spine, and the feel of his lips on mine. The way his body reacted to mine, pressed so close. I would know those clear, azure eyes anywhere. Anywhere in the world.
She had pulled him out of the doldrums when no one else could. He was grateful, happy even. She saw something in him he didn’t see in herself. She brought out the best in him. And he kept trying to be worthy of her love, of her dedication.
This future was strange. All his life, he had been taught to hate the things about himself he couldn’t control. He had been trained in the art of war. He was a machine for killing, another tool of the state. He was the perfect soldier, but he was far from being a perfect man. He had his weaknesses. His eyes lingered for far too long when walking through the showers. The more he tried to clear his mind of impure thoughts, the harder it was to stop thinking of them.
Gratefully, Steve took him up on the offer. They were sitting across from each other, enjoying each other’s company and the pad Thai before them, when Steve brought up the topic. The next day, Tony had Pepper reschedule all his meetings. He spent the rest of the day deliberately avoiding her and her questions.
His flushed cheeks were pink and would be warm to the touch. And his skin glistened with sweat. He was iridescent.
“Yeah, we’ve got to get you out of here,” said Tony. He’d explain it all later, but now wasn’t the time.
It was then he noticed. There was a man. There was a man strapped in the gyrosphere. Tony squinted, trying to see who it was, tying to see if he recognized him.
He couldn’t believe he was thirty. For the first time in a long time, he was looking forward to the future. In a few days’ time, he’d be meeting the crew.
He searched his kitchen until he found the cookbook. It was one of the few things of hers he kept in this house. There was the piano in the center of the living room and a chandelier overheard, both had been hers too. This though, this was more personal than either of those.
We returned to the house; our togas soaked. They dried as we walked, but not enough. We would have to leave them out to dry. My father rose early the next day, he was going to the Senate. He saw the togas hanging out back and questioned one of the house servants. She didn’t have an answer, but my father was a smart man. He knew.
“Right. I’ll get ready for dinner. Is…” He trailed off, but JOCASTA knew. And she answered his unasked question simply. “Captain Rogers will be joining the crew for dinner. He has spent the day training with Ms. Romanova and has worked up an appetite.”
He looked into my eyes, but I was trying to hide my tears, so I turned away as the tears fell. I didn’t want him to see me like this. But he turned my face and held my gaze, he wiped the tears away.
Tony stood too quickly and slipped on his dressing robe. It was loosely tied in front and dragged along the floor. He fell forward and the bottle in his hand slipped and rolled toward Steve. Some of the vodka spilled, but luckily the bottle didn’t break.
“There was something buried, deep beneath the Bay,” he said. “Linked to the reactor, working its way to surface, every minute.”
He hated to think what would become of him if he lost his memory. He hated to think who he’d be without the knowledge of where he had been. The learning curve had been steep.
He composed an email. He let her know he’d gladly arrange all accommodations for her. She only needed to state her preferences — flight time, hotel, and the like. Happy would be waiting for her at the gate and would take her to her hotel. If she wanted a tour of his home, he could arrange for that. Likewise, if she wanted a tour of his offices. And if she wanted to do both, they’d make time.
However, Stephanos cared for me from the moment we met. Kindness soon developed into a genuine friendship. And from then on, we were inseparable.
Days before, Tony accepted. He arrived on Roberta Rhodes’ doorstep with a duffel. His dark red scarf was threatening to fly away, when she opened the door. He stood there, unsure what to do. Thankful she pulled him into a warm hug. He hugged her back. No one had hugged him in weeks, not since he learned the news and this simple act brought him to tears.
He took his time finding an interviewer. She had to have the right voice, the right approach. Someone who understood. He read many, many different interviews. Finally, he found her. The right person to tell this story.
“I did, Jan, but he asked me not to tell and I didn’t know it was going to be so soon,” he said. He was trying to justify his actions to himself, but there was no justifying.
Then, he recalled Steve’s penchant for sketching, and laughed softly. Steve looked at him quizzically, before turning back to the stars.
Standing face-to-face, he was taller, but not noticeably so. It was only at this distance that I noticed. He stood up straight and held me at arm's length. Examining me. I thought I’d hate it. I thought I’d hate to have someone bore into me, but I didn’t.
They all praised her for her work. She was a brilliant engineer. She created remarkable things. When questioned on her creative process, she was tight-lipped. The ideas she brought to fruition were much too like ones Tony had shared with her, but he didn’t think her capable of such treachery. He didn’t think she’d steal his ideas and use them to make a name for herself.
He sat up as he spoke. He moved so gracefully, I almost didn’t realize what he was doing until I felt his nose touch mine, ever so lightly. Softly, he brushed the sand from my cheeks. I shuddered at his touch and met his piercing gaze.
He had never been this reclusive. He focused all his energy on his company and spent very little time with the Ultimates. The others didn’t know, and Steve wasn’t comfortable discussing someone else’s medical history, not even Tony’s, so he stayed quiet. Tony had entrusted him with something grave, something he hadn’t wanted publicly disclosed. Steve wasn’t going to betray him.
“The entire San Andreas fault was about to blow. I had to do something, Tony. The ocean would’ve consumed the city. Millions would’ve died.”
And so, Jim was the one and only choice. He was all the things Tony wished he could be. Jim would do right by him, he knew that. Knew that as well as he knew aerial maneuvers.
He was almost there. The atmosphere was so thin here. Next thing, he was crashing into the solar panels, knocking them out of orbit.
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you. Transformation charms take a lot out of you, I’d bet you’re going to feel a bit wobbly for a while.” Loki crouched down to look Tony in the eyes, and Tony swung his arm out, catching Loki on the cheek. It didn’t land very hard and the god laughed, picking up Tony’s arm and letting it drop again.
“I have some paint and paper, I’ll be right back.” He strode off to his bedroom, muttering all the while and leaving the rest of them to sit and stare at each other. Clint broke the silence.
Peter wasn’t paying much attention to Tony, and he was still stumbling through another excuse, when Coulson’s voice startled both him and Pepper, who both looked down at Tony and the cell phone he’d acquired.
The rest of the night was mostly Tony holing up in his lab while the rest of the team went to sleep on their respective floors. Steve tried to stay, but he knew how Tony got, and that sometimes his issues needed to be worked out alone. After the third failed time he tried to get Tony to talk he gave up. He rubbed their cheeks together and murmured,
Tony did everything he could to prove that he was just as worthy of being an Avenger as Iron Man was; he was cranking out assignments for SHIELD left and right, continuously upgrading the Avengers’ gear, attending board meetings and press conferences for SI as well as keeping on top of the R&D workload. Suit repairs were also on the Mandatory list, as well as developing new tech and fabricating entire new suits. He was burning the candle at both ends.
Dummy gave him an enthusiastic greeting, quelling Tony’s anger a little as he bobbed his claw up and down, not unlike a bird would. He waited patiently while Tony had the armor taken off and as soon as he could he was up in Tony’s space, bumping into him and beeping excitedly. Butterfingers and U were more laid back but they too patted him with their arms and started to beep. Tony felt a hundred times better after they’d said hello and he even sang to some Metallica during his shower, as opposed to screaming, like he usually did after arguing with Steve.
“Hey, guys! My name is Hannah Hill, and I’ll be helping you out today. Director Fury called me in when you requested a veterinarian, since SHIELD doesn’t actively have any on payroll.” Hannah explained, and Tony whipped his head around to give Steve his best murderous expression. He wasn’t phased, and just shrugged.
Steve curled up similarly next to Clint and pressed their sides together. He unconsciously began purring, though he didn’t realize it till the other cat relaxed against him.
“Can you identify what materials are being used in these? You seem like you have some engineering knowledge.” She said, subtly making a diversion so Tony and Steve had a chance to communicate.
” He hissed, snatching up his phone and racing down the hallway towards the elevator. When he entered and spun around his anger dissolved, turning into a determined energy as his teammates trotted in behind him and sat close enough for their fur to brush.
“Maybe we should check out the bedroom then? Get settled in?” The blush that exploded on Steve’s face definitely didn’t stop below his collar and was a sure fire way for Tony to know he knew exactly what he meant.
We got to see you for the first time today! The doctor confirmed there was just one of you too which was a big stress reliever. I don’t know if either of us could handle twins right from the start. Though Wanda did so maybe we could have too, but thankfully we don’t have to test that theory out right now. Your Oma tried not to but we both cried when the nurse, Sherry was her name, show us the ultrasound. You’re so tiny but already our hearts are yours. I drew a flower today thinking of you.
You’re here and you’re more perfect than I could ever imagine. We just got home yesterday and both you and your Oma are asleep right now. Your uncles and Aunt Pepper are coming by tomorrow to see you. I don’t even know what to write right now, just that you’re absolutely perfect in every way. I can’t wait to see you grow. You already have a head full of hair that I’m sure your Aunt will fuss over. I love you. I love you so much. We both do. Please always stay this little. The thought of you getting any bigger right now tears me up.
“Steve, please. One more hour and then you’ll have my undivided attention.” Tony pulled a holo screen up from the side of the table to adjust some levels. Steve had stopped moving but stayed silent and Tony almost looked up and insist he leave when he heard another sigh.
“I know, but that doesn’t change the fact they’re already paid for. I’m just happy they’ll go to someone who’ll like them.” Tony stared him down for a moment before opening his wallet and taking a white card from it. Without pause he grabbed a pen from the cashier cup and wrote something on the back before handing it to Steve. There in neat writing was 9 digits that would have sent younger him into a panic attack.
Tony was about ready to lick the container clean when Steve plucked it from between his paws and snapped the lid back on it.
At one point, Steve walked up behind him and put down his food bowl, full of the disgusting kibble. Tony didn’t even twitch. Eventually they all filed out and after almost a half hour of silence Tony uncurled and looked around. Nobody. He slunk over to the fridge and stood up on his hind legs to get it open, but he found that they had put a safety lock over the handles. There was no way Tony could get that open without fingers.
There were several voices at that point and he struggled harder because they were angry. They were going to hold him under until he drowned because he wouldn’t do what they wanted. Tony felt his resolve crumble. He would beg, he would crawl, he would do whatever they wanted because he didn’t want to die in a cave with a battery wired to his chest and his head submerged in a bucket of water.
The dough was cut into little dinosaur shapes (courtesy of one of Clint’s cookie cutter sets) and put in the oven to bake while Pepper set out some food for Tony and Steve.
When they got to the door, one of the employees sweeping the sidewalk stood up and held out an arm, stopping them. Peter clutched at Tony and gave a small, hopeful smile.
They were all disappointed that Loki was hiding so well, but there wasn’t much they could do about it.
Three hours and he’d nearly finished his smoothie, picking it up and sipping from it whenever he needed to think. He was on the last stretch for that wretched SHIELD assignment. He’d thought it would only take a few hours, but it continued to get more complicated, drawing out the process nearly to a full day.
Tony was trying to remind himself that he was in a tub, that he was with Steve, that Steve would never hurt him- but as soon as there was pressure on his back he snapped, scrambling away from the hands and trying to get away, away from the water and the people trying to kill him and the hands keeping him still-
“Honey, I removed that job title from the payroll and moved them to other departments the day you gave me clearance. I remember where you left it, so I’ll go get it.” Tony was trying to ignore the parting lick on the cheek and instead focus on the fact that Steve had Done Things with Tony’s company without consulting Tony first. It was trivial, and Steve wasn’t the kind of guy to do anything more than that, but it was really the principle of the thing. Steve was pretty great at so many things; it was always a struggle for Tony to find something to be irritated about. Not that he wanted to be irritated at Steve, but the balance was always skewed, since Steve seemed to find more irritating things about Tony than the other way around. He was just trying to restore an equilibrium. That’s all.
Tony did a circuit and didn’t see anything amiss, so he padded over to fall into step with Steve, nosing his ear for a brief moment of comfort.
Hey all!! I've been cranking out a lot this week, so I'm actually in the stages of finishing up all of the writing for this story! Enjoy the chapter, and get ready for the plot to thicken :)
“Steve? Have you found something?” Maria looked up and down the road, but Steve darted into the alley, nose on the ground like a dog. The rest of the team flanked him as he made his way to a dumpster. It reeked of garbage and rotten food, but there was something underneath that, and Steve was sure it was Tony.
Three days of working on the code, and Tony had barely made a dent. Part of the issue was the fact that he had paws instead of fingers. The other part was that Loki had really done a number on everything.
“Yea, he’s pretty smart. Right, Viv?” Peter leaned down to pick Tony up, one arm under his body to support him while he grabbed the bags.
“My brother can be crafty when he so desires. His magic is weak as a feline, but as soon as he is restored to his rightful form, there is no telling what he will do. If we are lucky, he will leave us here as we are and return to whence he came. If we are not…” Thor trailed off and let them all get the broad picture, most of which was being agonizingly and brutally shanked by the god of mischief.
“You’re also not supposed to be in here past visiting hours, but I suppose it doesn’t hurt anything.” Harley added, giving Clint a smile before the nurses- all in their pajamas- left again, dimming the lights as they passed.
Peter manhandled the phone out from under Tony without disrupting Natasha too much, which they all took a minute to stare at in amazement. Then he was explaining to Coulson what was going on, who didn’t sound very impressed.
“Stark, you’ve been barking for hours. What the heck do you want?” Steve walked up behind the couch, and Tony watched him observe the scene for a few moments before he suddenly
“Nasty, nasty. I’ll go get a few bags of fluid, and an oxygen unit. Should I grab an intubator, just in case?” He directed at Hannah, who nodded from where she was shaving Tony’s front leg. They couldn’t put the I.V in with fur getting in their way.
“You want a mission briefing, right? I’d like to get it over with sooner rather than later.” Tony said, waiting for Fury to step into the corridor and close his door with a resigned sigh. He led them down the hallway to a small meeting room, snagging an agent on the way. She didn’t seem pleased to be filling out paperwork instead of whatever she had been doing, but Tony couldn’t write and Fury was too high-ranking to do grunt work, apparently.
“Stay off the furniture.” He said, then returned his attention to the screen. They were watching some chick flick, and Tony snarled at him before leaving the room and walking into the foyer.
“You wish to speak the language of humans again, do you not?” Thor asked, and Tony could hardly believe his ears.
Tony knew better than to touch it, but he padded around the area, feeling the cold energy flow off of it in waves. It was the only place so far that had any kind of air movement. Somehow, it was colder still than the winter night. The chilled current cut right through his fur and prickled at his skin. He avoided the twisted metal debris to prevent himself from being shocked.
Tony was seeing red and he wanted to hit something, or maybe chew on something. He took off at a sprint and went to the garage, noting with dismay that the doors had been closed since he’d left. Tony continued around the property to every single exterior door to find all of them firmly shut.
The first thing Steve registered was pain. His head was throbbing, and he felt like his skin was crawling with bugs. That was enough to make him scramble to his feet. He ignored the persistent pain in his skull as he tried to brush at his arms, only to look down and see himself covered in… fur? He staggered backwards and tripped on his uniform, which was huge, and not on his body. What the fuck? Did Loki turn him into a fucking
Time passed in the slow, repetitive way it seemed to be doing as of late, and Tony’s lungs cleared up. He was closer to finishing JARVIS’ repairs, thanks to a little help from Bruce. He sat with Clint in the kitchen a few times a week, though there hadn’t been any crying since the first time. Clint would bake whatever struck his fancy, and Tony would sit at the counter, licking his utensils clean when he was finished (as long as there wasn’t any chocolate involved).
Tony didn’t even encounter anyone until the next afternoon, and it was Thor, to find out that he was leaving.
Everything snapped back into focus and Tony realized that he’d just made Steve chase him around the house and yard while he freaked out. God, he’d panicked- he’d completely lost it.
Tony was still exhausted, and he must have dozed again because the next time he opened his eyes, Steve had replaced Clint- who was now over by Natasha and playing a card game using an empty breakfast tray.
“What do you want? Leave. Go. Shoo!” Steve stuck out a leg to push him back, and then slammed the door in Tony’s face. He felt a surge of anger well up and he snarled at where he knew the camera was hidden.
“Well, it seems the party is over. It’s been rather dull if I do say so myself, and I must be off.” Loki sneered, raising his hands as if to cast more magic. The rest of the team tensed up for the fight, but Loki didn’t act upon his threat. Instead Loki looked down at Tony and put his fingers together as if ready to snap them and vanish.
to one of the seats by an adamant Steve, who insisted it was to keep him from getting hurt. Natasha took a couple of sneaky photos of Tony in the Hawkeye hoodie as they took off.
“Captain Rogers stopped by at 11:15.” Tony rubbed a hand over his mouth in thought. Cap was frustrating and confusing- he was doing little things like that all the time. He brought down food at least once or twice a day. Then, whenever Tony went up and actually talked with the guy, he was hot and cold. They could be having a pleasant conversation one minute, and a screaming match the next. Tony had paid close attention to figure out what set the man off but found nothing. No matter what he did, Cap would suddenly get closed off and defensive, and things would be said that they both regretted but refused to talk about. Steve would apologize by bringing Tony food and giving the bots a little TLC, while Tony would give Steve’s armor a few extra upgrades and introduce him to a new book or movie that he knew Steve would like. The next week the cycle would repeat. Tony had a hard time managing the constant whiplash of the whole thing, to be frank.
“We’re with you, Tony. Just making sure you realize the stakes.” Bruce meowed, the calmest of them all.
“Why the hell would I help you?” Tony asked, silently cheering the other cat on. Loki was flagging already, ending up on his back as the other cat used its hind claws to tear at his stomach. Tony felt a twinge of pity, but he tried to swallow it down and ignore it.
The summary of their mission; there was a strange energy signature at a building dead center in the abandoned town of Tocco Caudio, and SHIELD wanted to take a look. Tony would be going into the town solo with Clint and Natasha stationed a small ways back. He was to find the source of the energy, get readings, and get back out unless the circumstances were dangerous enough to warrant a full-scale takeover; another reason Clint and Natasha were on standby. They nearly got to the end of the briefing before Natasha suddenly spoke up.
“...don’t know. What isn’t he telling us?” Steve grunted, landing hit after hit on the bag, and rocking it so hard Tony was afraid it was going to pull right out of the beam it was hooked into.
Tony heaved a sigh and redirected his gaze to the door, and sure enough, Natasha peeked in a few moments later, out of view from where Clint was sitting. She made eye contact with Tony and held a finger to her lips as she lifted up a blanket and crouched down. Tony averted his eyes once again and she waited a few moments before she leapt, but Clint was ready. He shot a marble right at her forehead and dodged the blanket, pelting her with ammo as she made her retreat. Tony chuckled and Clint showed off a bit with the slingshot, banking a marble off a cabinet and getting it right in the fruit bowl.
“Oh yeah? What’s the big fishman going to do?” Tony threatened as Steve’s lower half moved at an angle so Tony could essentially sit on his lap despite them floating. He wasn’t sure the technicality of it all, but he knew Steve could float in place without much effort.
“Papa no!” He jumped out of his seat and ran around so he could climb into his papa’s lap. Tony easily made room and wrapped an arm around his waist so he wouldn’t fall off. Peter’s tiny hands grabbed onto his shirt too for extra security and it had Tony’s heart hurting from how adorable it was. “I love my Lego nights wit you. My fwiend Ned is jealous we have so many.”
“Please, Tony. Can I?” Could people who breathed through gills be breathless? Maybe it was just the strain in Steve’s voice but he sounded breathless. Ether way, Tony was already this far along, might as well finish the job.
“You boys from the 40’s really aren’t that smart with undertones are you?” Tony grabbed a water bottle for himself and tossed one to Steve, who caught it without much effort. “Just two nights ago after movie night I asked if you wanted to walk me to my room.”
“You should really get to bed yourself.” Steve’s voice would have startled him, if Tony had not gotten use to the super solider sneaking around behind him by now. He simply leaned back, meeting the firm chest and hummed.
“Tony, your blood pressures rising.” God, of course he was awake. Tony wasn’t sure if he was relieved or felt even more guilty that he had woken the blonde up.
“Okay?” Despite his confusion, Tony still followed him out back. There was nothing fancy set up, just a two person swing chained to the ceiling with a nice view of the leaves in front of them. Tony didn’t question him as they both sat in the swing or the silent five minutes afterwards where Steve was going through a complete internal panic. “If that was too forward-” he finally started which broke Steve out of the war going on in his head.
“I love you too, Tony. I’m so glad I found you.” Steve’s grip on his waist tightened and Tony took the chance to wrap his legs around the man’s waist, or rather where his waist would have been. He could feel the smooth transition of skin to scale and suddenly wanted to know what it would feel like against his fully bare skin.
“That was Uncle Bucky’s fault not Daddies!” Tony had only left for fifteen minutes and yet in that amount of time Steve and Bucky had managed to not only lose an entire bag of pieces, but also break several bricks in half trying to make them fit together when they clearly didn’t go together. He thought he would have been safe with Sam watching over them, but the other had just laughed and said it was too funny to stop them.
“Okay, spill. He’s had to have told you something.” There was barely enough room behind the counter for them to stand shoulder to shoulder, yet Steve wasn’t about to leave before he got his answers.
Today’s the day!! We’re already in the room getting ready. I can barely keep the pencil from shaking so this won’t be long. Only a few hours now and I’ll be able to hold you. I almost feel like crying thinking about it.
“Not yet, there’s only an hour left if you can wait.” Steve paused as he looked over at the handsome man for a moment, both admiring the view and seeing what he was doing. “You know, you could enjoy the scenery outside instead of staring at your phone.” This caused the billionaire to look up and give him a knowing smirk. “I’m not just saying that because I’m old. Seriously, this area is known for being beautiful in the fall.” Steve motioned towards the line of trees bracketing the highway they drove on. It truly was very pretty and the main reason Steve had picked this area.
“Now where is your food, demon.” Tony checked a few of the cabinets before finally finding the bag of all natural, dehydrated raw kibble. Of course they would feed her some fancy stuff. That’s why she had the craving for flesh. He dumped a cup of food in her dish and refilled the water. When he went to set said water back down, there she was. Staring up at him and sitting by her food dish but not touching it.
“Okay, give me a minute big guy. Lemme just readjust.” Slinging one arm over Steve’s shoulder, Tony carefully pulled his legs up and settled his knees on the flat plans of Steve’s underbelly. The merman’s hands were instantly around the back of his thighs, holding him in place for extra stability. “Don’t let me go under. I’m trusting you.” Arching his back, Tony slipped the hand coated in Steve’s fluids between his legs. The back of his shorts were cleanly ripped down the center seam which made this easier even if it also meant a very embarrassing walk back home. “Talk to me, Steve.”
“He is not staying with us. He can stay in the nursery downstairs.” He remembers saying, though it did nothing to that look Steve was giving him.
“And the other parts?” Tony took to rubbing his hands up and down Steve’s chest, taking in how muscular his upper torso changed during the shift. Another set of soft gills had formed under his arms and while Tony desperately wanted to touch them, he kept his hands away for now.
“Maybe we’ll have to invite Ned over sometime so he can help build one.” Tony leaned back in his chair and watched Peter’s face light up. Suddenly he was off talking up a storm about Ned and which ones he’d want to build with him and how amazing it would be. Tony could listen to him talk for hours and still be just as amazed with every word he said as he was the first time Peter spoke.
“Out or I’m docking your pay.” Bucky’s laughter could be heard even as the door closed, and Steve was left alone. Steve just took the seat Bucky had previously been sitting in and shook his head. By the time eight hit, Steve had only helped three customers, answered half a dozen anxious texts form Bucky, and completed three cross word puzzles. He was just about ready to call it an early night when a man walked in, dressed in a three-piece black suit. His hair was styled but not slicked back while his goatee was practically drawn on with how perfect it looked. To say he was attractive was an understatement, but given the date and the products Steve sold, he didn’t bother letting the thoughts go any further than that. It was rare single people made it into their shop so there was no point in getting interested.
The Avengers had always used his tower as main base, but they never stayed past work stuff and Tony didn’t mind. But then a mission hit harder than any of them had expected and it was late when the Quinjet landed. The offer of ‘Stay the night’ had slipped from his tongue before he had really registered what he was offering. Never did he expect any of them to say yes let alone all of them. That opened the doors for what was soon to become a weekly team bonding sleepover. Once a week turned into twice and then three times a week.
“Not going to happen. You promised me if I went to that wedding with you, you would swim with me.” Tony recalled the deal that had been made but he was hoping that the fun they had at the wedding, and afterwards, would make Steve forget about Tony’s half of the deal. Clearly the man had not.
“If you want it so badly you’re going to have to help me get out of these-” Before Tony could even finish his taunt, Steve’s hands were already on his ass and ripping the back end of his shorts open. “Steve!” Tony panicked. “I still have to walk back to the house after this!” He tried craning back to see the damage but Steve had plans of his own and was pulling Tony flush against his chest making Tony let out a yelp in protest.
You’re going to be a girl! Of course, when you’re older you can decide if that’s what you identify as but for right now, you’re going to be our little girl. Your Oma and I have been going back and forth with names, so I’ll list a few. Hopefully you’ll like the ones we didn’t pick;
“I can’t help that I’m curious.” Tony rolled his eyes but continued on. “Why did you react the way you did? You’re never this…needy on land? Or really vocal. I thought you were having a good time in bed but that was nothing compared to this?” Steve’s face went red and to avoid answering he ducked under the water for a moment. “Hey! No, you have to answer. You weren’t…” Tony gasped as the sudden realization hit him. “You were faking it weren’t you!? All those times you ‘came’ in the bathroom. You didn’t actually come did you?!” Steve looked so utterly ashamed that Tony knew he had hit the nail on the head. “Steve!”
“No, I need sleep first. I’ll catch up on everything tomorrow or…later today technically.” The ride back to the penthouse only took minutes but Tony was ready to just climb into bed with his super solider and sleep for a solid six hours. Maybe he’d take Steve out tomorrow as an apology for blowing him off today. Not that today was anything special, just another Saturday right? Or was it Sunday. He shook his head once the doors opened figuring it didn’t matter.
“I know…I know. I’m okay, just gotta…breath.” He trusted Steve more so than anyone else, maybe even more than Pepper. Tony took several deep breaths, letting them out just as slowly until his heart resumed a normal pace and the panic had mostly dissipated. He wasn’t going to go under; Steve was there to hold and protect him.
“This is where our reproduction organs are. Like some of your species we do secrete a fluid that allows for penetration as well as keeping our cock lubricated for breeding. If you do want to try, you’re welcomed to collect some with your fingers to open yourself up. It’s pretty water resistant so it shouldn’t mix with the water while you do it or I can’t prop you out of the water if that would make you more comfortable. As you said before, I can’t exactly help with the prepping given my claws and webs.” Tony was already hard in his shorts but seeing the blush go up to Steve’s cheek had another feeling rising inside him.
“Y-Yeah. Just, be easy. First time riding royal sea dick.” Humor had always made the other laugh and break the tension but there was no laughing this time. Only a grunt before more of Steve’s unnatural dick pressed out of his slit and against his hole. Everything felt too slippery and after three failed attempts to get in, Tony finally just reached behind and guided him. On the next thrust up Steve slid in with a moan. Tony expected a different shape, made a wide girth, but he didn’t except the large member to push right in with no hesitation or resistance. It was smooth, wet, long, and shot right up without a single movement from Steve’s hips.
“Oh?” Why was that a turn on?! “Gonna take a chunk out of me fishman?” Tony shivered at the feeling of sharp teeth against his skin.
“Yes, she is. Last time we spent the night here she tried killing me in my sleep. She’s just planning her revenge.” Tony eyed her cautiously as he side stepped around his husband and the evil creature just to put distance between them.
“Oh? You mean rich and famous?” He was teasing him, and Steve was beyond happy he hadn’t taken offense to what had been said.
“Tony, we both know you will never truly be retired, and I don’t fault you for that. If Sam called me saying they needed me in blue and white, you know I’d be there.” Steve’s large hand came up to press against his cheek, slowly guiding him to look up.
“I’ll make it up to you tomorrow! Sleep tight, cap.” Tony turned back to the computer when an error message came up, cursing under his breath. He barely heard Steve’s retreating steps or the sound of the door closing with more force then necessary. It was close to three in the morning when the pieces finally came together and a success screen popped up. “There we go. I told him I could finish it.” He flopped back in his chair with an exhausted huff.
“Guess you have to spell it out for me next time.” Steve downed his bottle in two easy swallows and by the time it was drained, Tony had made his way over to stand in front of him. The man’s calloused hands, skirting over his chest but not touching just yet.
“No, I’m supposed to be retired. We both are and so far you’re the only one actually sticking to that.” Tony looked down to avoid Steve’s face but staring at his naked torso seemed to do other things to him.
“Move.” He whispered, keeping his voice low so Steve wouldn’t hear him from the other room but at the sudden movement she stood up and let out a loud meow. “Shit, no. Shush.” Almost to make him suffer more, she moved closer and weaved her way between his legs. Just to spite him a loud purring sound could also be heard and Tony felt his palms go cold.
“Yeah? What does that mean then?” He pressed a second finger in and was surprised when there was no sting or pain. Strange enough his rim felt almost numb while his insides were starting to feel tingly.
In the matter of a year his tower had grown from just him and some robots to overfilling with people. Steve seemed to collect friends like trading cards and somehow, they always ended up homeless and needing a place to stay. But who could blame them? Tony was not immune to Steve’s charm or the way the old man knew exactly how to get him to blush.
Your Oma is 16 weeks now, we have another appointment in two weeks. There we’ll find out if you’re a boy or girl. It doesn’t matter ether way to us but I know your Oma wants to wait until then to pick out a name and to start decorating your nursery. He’s already cleaned the room out and started wiring cameras and sensors to make sure you’re safe. Your Oma’s officially retired as of last week, but I still have a few months left. Your Uncle Sam will be taking over as Captain America then, he’s currently training with me now to be prepared. We haven’t told him or your Uncle Bucky yet. We’re planning on doing a little announcement party for them once we decide on a name for you.
“Think he’ll pop the question?” Steve loved watching Bucky’s face get even redder at that. He already knew the answer of course, Sam had called him a few weeks ago asking for permission since Bucky’s father had since passed. It touched Steve knowing Bucky had a good man in his life. They had been dating for over two years now and while Steve missed all the old stories, he was just happy knowing his best friend was happy.
“Whoever’s fault it was doesn’t matter, I still had to buy you a whole new set.” Not like money was any issue but they were eight hours in and had to completely restart. “Besides, I like our Lego nights. Unless you’re too old to hang out with your Papa now.” Peter’s face pulled into one of shock at the insulation.
“You…have?” He didn’t exactly remember…any invitations. He would have had Tony invited him, but he wanted to call the other out because he most certainly hadn’t.
He could have just asked Tony flat out what he thought they were but a part of him was scared for the answer and another part wanted to go all out. Make a big declaration of feelings so Tony couldn’t misunderstand what he was saying and where he was coming from.
“Tony….fuck. Tony.” Tony felt Steve rub his forehead against the bite but once more there was no pain. Just warmth. “I’m sorry. We should have talked about this before you got in. I knew this might happen…thought I could control it. I’m so sorry.”
“Okay, oceans gift. I’m going to assume your freaky secretions is what’s making me feel all warm and tingly so let’s see if that dick of yours can help.” Tony was about to sit back down when Steve jerked his thighs and had his legs wrapped around his waist once more. Tony managed only one slightly girly yelp as he clung to Steve’s shoulders so he wouldn’t go under in the sudden movements. “Could warn a guy, Jesus-Steve what is that.” He felt something pushing against his hole and realized in that moment he could feel the muscles underneath his ass contract and release.
“Alright, you win.” Steve’s chuckle was just as sweet as Peter’s laugh and Tony found himself thinking again how lucky he was to have them both in his life.
“Tonyyyy,” Steve finally pulled his head back up with a little laugh. “I’m sorry, it was too hard to explain. When I’m in that form, it feels good and all but it’s not…it’s like if you had three socks on your dick and tried jerking off. It feels okay but it’s not going to make you come. The only times I’ve been able to actually get off in that form is if I edge myself like this first and then immediately get in bed with you.” Tony just sat there in complete shock. He thought they had a wonderful, fulfilling sex life and now. Now!
“The couch is a pullout. Figured if you didn’t want to share a bed I could sleep out here.” Steve said it so nonchalantly just so he could make sure Tony knew he wasn’t expecting anything. He hadn’t really been thinking of sex in general, just some nice clean cuddling. Maybe a little kissing and touching hands, but he still was a gentleman of an older time.
“Probably will.” Bucky flashed him a smile and Steve couldn’t help but laugh. They both knew Bucky would never say no, he loved Sam more then he’d ever admit.
“I was protecting myself.” Steve merely rolled his eyes before picking up the food dish and adding some water to it. The moment it was put back down, now officially a soupier texture, Alpine jumped down and went to town making Tony grimace.
“Guess we’ll find out.” He fired back, feeling proud of having something ready. Tony always kept him on his feet, giving a thrill of what the man was going to say next.
So many things have happened since your last letter! First off, we decided on Natasha as your name after a close friend of ours. The middle name is still a work in progress, but we still have time. Your Uncle Sam, Bucky, Rhodey, and Aunt Pepper now know you’re coming. Well technically Aunt P knew a few weeks ago because your Oma couldn’t keep his mouth shut but your uncles now know too. Bucky cried and yes you can tease him on that later because he started teasing me when I started crying too. I can’t wait for you to meet your family. We’ve told the rest of the Avengers too and they’re all excited to meet you. Scott already started sending us some of his old daughter’s things and giving us a long list of things we’ll need. I’m not sure how much we’ll actually buy but he’s insistent on a lot of it so we’ll give it a good look over. I’ve slipped some sketches in of the mural ideas I had. Still haven’t decided on one just yet but I’ll try getting that narrowed down this week.
“We are having a whole sex education lesson tonight, just so you know.” Tony carefully took his right hand and trailed it down Steve’s arm until he reached the slit. “Second off,” he carefully traced the outer fold, eyes sharp as he watched and felt the muscles twitch under him. “We’re finding a secluded part of the beach and I want to absolutely take you apart. Will you feel pleasure if I put my finger inside?” He looked up to see Steve’s answer but was met with wide eyes and flared gills.
“Steve, are you crying?” Steve looked up from the notepad in his lap and smiled, seeing his love standing there in nothing but a robe.
Your Papa has been talking nonstop about these letters and showing me the ones his Oma wrote him so I’m going to try this. Bare with me, okay? You’ll probably already know this by the time you read these letters but I’m the type to buy the premade Birthday cards and sign my name. It’s hard for me to really put words to feelings, probably all the stuff I’ve been through. Don’t worry, we’ll get you a good therapist by the time you’re five. God knows I needed it when I was five. Right, getting off topic. Sorry, pregnancy brain has got me firing off lately. You should see the state my lab is in right now. I couldn’t even find U yesterday and he was standing right by the door! I’ll have to build you a little robot friend when you’re old enough.
“No, we get those a lot. Props to location for that, I guess. I meant single attractive men, that is assuming you are single.” Oh god was Steve really hitting on Tony Stark? Bucky had always told him to shoot his shot if he ever got the chance and guess that’s what was happening right now. Tony’s eyebrows went up and then the most perfect laugh escaped his mouth.
“Can’t understand you, Stevie.” A frustrated groan was pressed against Tony’s neck, and he finally decided to cut him a break.
“And what about the weird orgasm but not orgasm feeling?” His own cock had sadly since softened but that didn’t mean the aftereffects of such a powerful orgasm, even if it wasn’t his own, didn’t still ring through his body like a steady drum.
“Won’t hurt. Please.” The words were mumbled and hard to understand but Tony caught them enough to hear the no hurt part. Fuck it. He was already this far along. If he had to retire early then so be it.
“Alright, just… I don’t know what this is between us and I’ve been a little afraid to ask because maybe it wasn’t what I thought it was, but I have developed feelings for you Tony. Feelings that I’ve not really dealt with since the 40’s and I don’t know the proper way to go about it at all in this century. Back then it was all secrets and hidden words, but I want to date you. Like officially, call you my boyfriend type of date you not just going out to eat and sharing a kiss in the darkness type. I don’t want to ruin whatever this is, but I don’t want to lead you on if we’re not on the same page here.” Tony’s smile didn’t slip once from his face and that fact alone both caused him to panic a little more but also feel confident in what he was saying. God why had he sounded so smooth when he practiced with Bucky but so frantic with Tony. Something about Tony’s brown eyes just had his palms sweating and his brain misfiring.
“You can’t prove that. Why are we the ones watching her after all? Bucky knows how much we don’t get along.” Steve gave him a pointed look but thankfully carried her along in his arm while he finished watering the way too many plants that covered the small two-bedroom apartment.
“Fine you-” Tony couldn’t finish his sentence as Steve bit down. Pain exploded throughout his body and had a curse flying out his mouth. Didn’t hurt was complete bullshit! “Motherfuck-” and then that bulge was pressing past his rim, expanding and pressing so fucking heavily against his prostate that Tony couldn’t think straight. A moan ripped through both of them as hot cum shot off inside him and the feeling of his belly extending against his fingers just the slightest had Tony squeezing down against it. Just as suddenly as the pain came, it was gone and replaced by a warmth over his entire body. Tony was strangely hyper aware of the seed spilling inside him and the teeth still lodged in his skin but he felt incredibly. His whole body felt like it was experiencing the best orgasm life could give him yet remotely he knew his cock was still hard and aching in his trunks. Was he feeling Steve’s?
“Mate mean sex in fish tongue?” Tony teased, working the finger in and out until his body adjusted. The fluid was in fact a very excellent lube and the thought crossed Tony’s mind of bottling it up later for shower sex.
“Well, I’ll be damned. Usually, men need at least three shots in before they even have the balls to hit on me and since you’re still on the clock I would assume you’re as sober as they come.” Steve may have arched his back just a bit to puff out his chest as Tony’s eyes scanned him up and down. The uniform wasn’t exactly flattering especially with the apron, but clearly Tony saw something he liked since he didn’t flat out shoot him down.
“Such a good stud for me.” Tony cooed, pressing in further so he could feel more of Steve’s length. “You’re going to breed me up good, aren’t you?” Steve wasn’t a wild animal but talking to him like this looked like it was about to trigger something within him.
“I’m going to shift now, okay?” Tony nodded but didn’t say anything. One of the reasons he had agreed to this deal was because it meant he could see Steve’s true form up close. Even after almost a year of being together, he had only ever seen it a handful of times due to his fear of the ocean and Steve’s inability to shift in anything but the ocean water. They had tried filling Tony’s bathtub with ocean water which had taken several hours but it was a no go. Steve said it had to do with the heart of the ocean giving him his form, not just the water itself.
“Or we could check out the porch out back!” He stepped back to put space between them which had Tony’s puzzled expression coming back. Steve needed to get what he wanted out first before they did anything physical. He needed to know what Tony’s intentions here were because he couldn’t go through being just a friends with benefits thing when the feelings he held for him were this strong.
“I am aware, Jarvis relayed your message.” He heard the larger man start walking closer and part of his shoulders prickled with each step. It wasn’t that he minded his husband being in the lab, there was specifically a couch near the wall exactly for him to be in there, but Tony didn’t need a distraction right now. He was so incredibly close to fixing the power failures his new rescue suits were having. If he could just get another hour or two of uninterrupted work then he could give Steve all the time he wanted. “Tony, that message was from four hours ago.” And there goes that disappointed Captain America voice.
“Right, flowers. Sorry, we don’t get a lot of…people like you in here. Just caught me off guard.” Steve licked his lips as Tony moved closer to the counter, even going so far as leaning against it.
Casual touches had also increased after the first time they kissed. Little ones like Steve touching the small of Tony’s back when he had to walk behind him, or Tony sticking his feet under Steve’s thigh during team movie night. Hand holding had only been a one-time thing so far and Steve found he enjoyed it most of it. Playing it off cool, he flipped his hand around and threaded their fingers together. Even going so far as to move them to rest on Tony’s jean clad thigh. The other man made a small humming noise but didn’t protest it. Instead, giving his hand another little squeeze.
“Honey-s, we’re home!” Clint called, arms spread open like he expected a hug. Natasha only raised an eyebrow at him, but Tony huffed a little laugh. “At least
“Do not get involved in matters that do not concern you.” She hissed, fur puffing up as she got ready to finish her work with Loki. Tony darted over to the exhausted and bleeding villain, any trace of uncertainty gone as he stood over one of their worst enemies, this time to protect instead of maim.
“Damn.” Clint said, padding over and sitting down. Steve nodded, wishing he could help as Phil struggled to manage the squirming bag and tidy at the same time. The other Avengers were wandering around the room and surveying the mess. Natasha trotted out from behind the couch and joined them on the coffee table.
“Okay, awesome. I-I should probably go help them finish, first. Get rid of the robots, I me-mean.” He said, pointing awkwardly towards the dwindling fight.
! Otstupit'!” She yelled, pushing a junior agent aside to reach the two of them, the agents stowing their weapons reluctantly. “Are you hurt, shchenok?” She asked, crouching awkwardly on the ground to reach Tony and check him for injuries. He minutely shook his head- he was a bit rattled from the day’s events, but he’d be fine after a little rest.
Tony poked his head out of the alley, ears swiveling and nose twitching as he tried to sort through the new information he was getting. He could hear everything, and smell way too much. He also had no idea where he was. “Well, you gotta start somewhere.” He muttered, taking off and heading to his right, down the sidewalk. ‘At least it’s daytime’, Tony mused to himself. He would have been reluctant to leave his armor, but he had managed to shove most of it behind the dumpster, and put his scent all over it so that he could find it later. Tony was much more comfortable after rubbing his face all over the metal, though he knew it was just some cat instinct, and wouldn’t matter anyway.
“Any news on Tony? It’s getting dark out. If he’s still wandering the streets, at night…” Natasha trailed off, since they didn’t need her to elaborate for them to get the picture. Steve felt a spike of anger flare up in his chest.
“Coyote, are you on target?” Rumlow’s voice crackled over the comms, just as Tony rounded a corner and came up to the demolished structure he was supposed to climb in.
“How was the mission? Can’t have been too bad, if you’re still in one piece.” She said, shutting the door behind Tony and taking his flak jacket off for him.
They waited a few beats and then Natasha got up, reaching out as if to grab for Tony. He panicked and snarled, backing himself up into the corner. She just leaned forwards and grabbed him by the collar, dragging him to her. Tony’s heart started to beat against his ribs. She was going to put him back in there, back where it was pitch-dark and cold, where his demons were waiting to drown him and choke him and he wasn’t going back-
Tony didn’t even understand what he did wrong- besides being a cruel reminder to Steve of what he had lost and could never get back, but that was hardly Tony’s own fault. For once he refused to accept the blame even though most of their other issues were more than likely because of him. Tony was a selfish asshole who had an ego the size of Manhattan. Unsurprisingly it put people off, so he understood why Steve hated him so much.
“Well, I can’t say I’m not surprised. Wait…” He looked down at the bundled up cape, and his face got a bit paler. Steve had never seen him have such a reaction, and it caused a silent ripple of unease to go through the assembled cats.
“Coyote, we hear you. Bark twice if we move something that hurts you guys.” She said, and Tony was forced to wait once again, silent as the voices got closer and closer.
“What the fuck!” He spat, kicking his back legs uselessly. He may have been grateful for the save, but he really didn’t appreciate being cradled like a baby. He flattened his ears, growling in warning at the face looming over him. The kid got the message, and leaned back, letting Tony wriggle himself upright on the arms bracing him.
“Natasha was trying to get him off the couch, and he flipped! He was growling and snapping and he just-” Clint made a violent biting gesture with one hand, and shrugged as he picked up his coffee again. “The guy’s driving us crazy. Maybe you can reason with him.” The team murmured in agreement and it was Pepper’s turn to scoff.
Loki dropped his illusion and went back to looking like himself in full ensemble, pulling an Asgardian knife out of a pocket in his robes. He tightened his grip on Tony and pointed the blade at the assembled heroes. Tony growled and turned his head, more than ready to bite Loki right on his smug looking face.
“Where’s the shampoo? Maybe we accidentally put it in a different bag?” Steve wondered aloud, glancing at Tony before he got up and left the room.
“Lady Widow, please calm yourself. Loki casted a spell upon us all, including himself. We are safe at Anthony’s tower.” His voice was a low rumble, in contrast to his lean body and large ears. Steve wasn’t an expert on cats, but Thor didn’t even seem to be a normal housecat. Natasha looked at them all warily, before slinking forwards and pressing up against Clint’s side. He started to purr, and she looked at him with amusement.
Tony didn’t hear anything coming after him so he laid there and panted, letting the cold soak into his bones as he shivered. His heart was beating so loud that he didn’t hear the person approach him, just felt arms wrap around his chest and he surged up, struggling with everything he had left.
“JARVIS, what’s in here? Where did he get it from?” Tony sniffed the blender, but it smelled fine, nothing strange or any traces of anything unfit to be in a fruit smoothie (such as asparagus, but Tony tended not to remind himself of the numerous fruit-veggie smoothies from Dummy, which always tasted horrendous).
“Want to go down to the track?” Natasha asked, standing up and stretching before leading the way to the elevator. “We can run off some of this stress. I’ll race you both; we can see which of us is the superior cat.” She waggled her rump and trotted past the metal doors, leaving Steve and Clint to scramble after her.
“Hey Stark, Thor is back. And we’re also getting a dog, hope you don’t mind.” Thor and Tony were at the front of their little group, and when Loki turned around, he looked them up and down with a look of mild interest. He searched Thor’s face and seemed to realize that he knew, dropping the expression for one of disdain.
The lights suddenly came on full-force and there were voices- much louder than Clint. Tony recognized Harley from earlier and he was messing with the I.V, injecting something into the stream while someone was smacking his back hard enough for Tony’s chest to loosen and whatever was in his lungs broke up, letting him get enough air to stop coughing.
It wasn’t a pretty sight. The pavement was churned up at random intervals, and the sky looked like it was buzzing with angry metal bees. He caught a glance at Thor chasing a group above the buildings before Tony was out of sight, eyes peeled for any kind of Shield agents or vehicles. Steve couldn’t reasonably be mad at him if he got himself to safety, right?
“What now? There’s not much we can do like this.” Bruce sighed, nearly falling over when Clint bumped their shoulders together.
“This paperwork isn’t for you, Stark. Peter needs to fill it out before he starts.” Coulson got up and smoothed down his jacket, the very embodiment of suave as he swept out of the room, agents trailing after him like puppies. Peter turned to Tony with a look of fear in his eyes, and Tony patted him on the arm.
“You injured Anthony?” Thor asked, sounding like he’d been betrayed. It was a kicked-puppy sort of look that would make anyone feel guilty. Tony almost felt bad, but he had to remind himself that it was Loki, not an innocent civilian.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Tony ventured, setting his head down on the cool counter while she stirred her tea.
“Thank you, thank you-” The second man said, as the agent helped him maneuver the kids under the beam and into the hallway. The youngest- two years old, at most- had stopped screaming when they were rescued, but he started up again when he saw the fire, clutching onto his older sister’s leg.
“You’re welcome, Tony. You’ve got some dog-breath going on, though.” There was quiet for a few more moments before Bruce spoke up again, careful.
“Dear God… Tony, did Loki get those specs off of the server? Why would he do that?” Bruce wondered aloud, fingers rubbing against his mouth and eyes wide as they watched the news.
“Pete, my man, my awkward guy, my nerdy friend- just a bit farther. Please?” Tony pulled on the leash a bit, giving a few pathetic cries and his best sad eyes. Peter sighed, rubbing a hand over his mouth.
Tony lurched to his feet, wobbling unsteadily before he regained his balance. His heart was still pounding and the panic was just under the surface of his skin, ready to seize his lungs and
Tony rolled his head back and perked his ears, watching as she approached him and crouched down with an exasperated expression on her face. The rest of the team milled around and Clint started to make lunch with the help of Steve. Pepper ran a hand over Tony’s head and his tail started wagging back and forth with the first glimpse of joy he’d seen in days.
“Oooh, I’ve got this one.” Natasha called, jumping up onto the couch and fishing the remote out from between the cushions. After a moment of struggling she started typing out a title and Peter made a tiny groaning noise when he realized what she was aiming for.
. These spiders could eat metal and he couldn’t make himself move as they made quick work of the structure, causing it to jerk and wobble as the pipes gave out one by one.
“Where are we going? Why do you look so ruffled?” Steve didn’t answer (Clint wouldn’t have heard anyway), instead gesturing for Clint to follow him as he led the way to the elevator. It was already descending with Natasha on board.
The rest of the afternoon passed comfortably, with Tony dozing in Bruce’s lap while the rest of the group slowly filtering out until they were the only two left.
“The only times he’s been actively violent were Afghanistan, and cleaning up Obadiah's mess afterwards. There was also an instance or two during his Palladium poisoning, but other than that, the fighting was all self-defense or Avengers work. Are you telling me that Tony, Tony Stark,
Even if you manage to find where I place it, once armed, it will go off at the gentlest touch. So consider your options carefully.” He finished, smacking Tony’s head against the ground once more and leaving him to see stars.
“You with us, Tones?” Rhodey asked, and Tony turned his head to see Bruce standing next to Steve, holding out a tablet with a live feed of Rhodey’s concerned face.
Tony coughed out a mouthful of water, head tilted up to keep his lips and nose above the rising water line.
Tony trotted happily through the mansion’s front door and made a beeline for the living room, finding a rubber toy and snatching it up while the rest of the team filed in behind him.
“I hear you loud and clear.” Tony said, breath puffing out in front of him. He was glad for his fur and the flak jacket; as a human he likely would have needed at least four layers to even begin to feel comfortable.
“What’s going on? Why is there a dog?” Bruce paused halfway into the kitchen and finally seemed to notice Thor. “Oh, hey. When did you get back?”
“So my first complaint, is that you won’t let me back in my lab. It’s like if I locked all of you outside, in the rain, with only socks on. It’s terrible and I’d like it to be rectified immediately.” Tony said, sitting up straight and puffing out his chest so that they could tell how serious he was.
Before Coulson could get much farther, Peter’s face started to scrunch a bit. At first Tony thought he was incredibly uncomfortable, but the kid kept accidentally smiling, so it was obviously more of a matter of him trying to be composed and failing horrendously. Tony was about to ask when Coulson’s phone gave an angry chirp.
Ten minutes of stifled chuckles and pictures before they made it to the helicarrier and Tony was finally released from his new personal hell.
SHIELD medical was, as always, a chore. They’d apparently hired a vet tech onto the team after The Incident, and he made sure to give them both a thorough check-up while they were there. Tony ended up with one of his back legs shaved for stitches, and Steve nearly rolled off the table laughing when he’d seen the final result.
It was just like space. Silent, pitch-black, and lonely. Tony started to hyperventilate and he circled the room as he tried to think, tried not to look in the corners where his brain tried to trick him into thinking that shadows moved.
“Gwen would have adored you.” It came out as a hoarse whisper. Tony was taken aback- the kid had been fine (though a little mad) only seconds ago, and now he looked close to tears. The expression on his face looked so lost and broken that Tony immediately dropped any dislike he had for him. He was a cat, so logically speaking, he could purr, right? People loved it when cats purred. He squinted in concentration as he breathed, searching in his throat and chest for something that he hadn’t had as a human.
“Widow? Status. Widow!” Steve barked, but there was no response. Clint swore a colorful streak and talked right over Steve when he was told to watch his profanity.
Okay, now what? How had he even ended up here, let alone as a feline? He combed through his most recent memories, trying to suppress the pounding headache he had.
“Yeah, think of it as pet-sitting, but for a famous person. You’re just… taking care of Tony Stark’s cats while he’s away. This is until they’ve been transformed back, of course.”
Tony yelped again as he was brought back into the living room where everyone besides Thor had gathered. All of them were
Tony didn’t bother giving it any further thought. Instead, he threw caution to the wind and scrambled up the shelves to reach the ceiling. He had to be careful not to disturb the tile the device was sitting on, or it could drop to the floor.
“Loki-kitty antagonized the wrong cat, apparently. I was sitting here, minding my own business-” Tony rolled over and pointed at the table he had been laying on, “-when they both appeared out of thin air, fighting to the death. She kept telling me not to ‘get involved in something that does not concern me’, but that’s all the information I have.” They all looked at one another in uncertainty and Thor reappeared, humming in thought.
