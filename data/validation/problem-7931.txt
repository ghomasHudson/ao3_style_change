And he’s had the shrapnel out of his body for years now, hasn’t had a reason to be worried about his heart since he was in a relationship with Pepper, but the way it’s pounding now makes him feel like the arc reactor in his chest now is still keeping him from dying. “You...love me?” It comes out a lot softer than he means it to.
“That's good.” Steve slotted his lips with Tony's in a deep kiss, both of them moaning into it as their passion grew. “That's very good.” Steve breathed and he reached down for Tony's belt. Steve unfastened it with quick hands and worked his pants open and pushed them down Tony's thighs almost hastily. Tony lifted his hips up and kicked the offending clothing off, and letting them drop over the edge of the bed. Steve splayed his hands over Tony's abdomen, tracing the tips of his fingers along the band of his boxers. He could clearly see the outline of Tony's cock, and the wet spot forming from the young man's leaking tip. Steve took a moment to breath and gain his bearings on the situation. He himself was painfully hard and he wanted nothing more than to take and pleasure Tony all night, but he was the adult here he had to be certain he wasn't taking advantage. Steve's better sense was finally overpowering his lust addled brain.
“Good...” Tony closed his eyes and rocked his hips back, going slow at first their combined breathy moans filling the room. He increased his pace, riding Steve's cock like an expert, bouncing on him and relishing the intense heat of pleasure spiking through him with each downward thrust.
“Not exactly.” Steve replied with a soft smile. “I was just wondering if we ever would have done this if we hadn't been doused with that pollen.”
“Y-yes. I can hear you.” Steve croaked out, his throat felt raw and his voice rough. He swallowed hard to try and moisten the dry feeling in his mouth.
Tony slipped his arm around Steve's waist and leaned into him. “No sense dwelling on what-ifs. It happened and we're here now.”
Tony sat up again and glowered at Pepper. “Don't you think I realize that? That's why this is such a giant problem.”
“Doesn't that hurt? You have to be oversensitive!” Tony protested but there was no denying how good it felt. Still, even as much as Tony wanted to reach his own release he was willing to wait and do the deed himself if needed. The last thing he wanted was for Steve to hurt himself in trying to pleasure him.
Steve had to be thorough, and always insisted on taking the time to prep Tony properly for fear of hurting him. Tony had grown accustomed to receiving the mass that was Steve's cock, but the initial penetration was always intense and somewhat uncomfortable. There was always that moment of doubt that this time he'd have to tell him to stop, that his body just wasn't ready for it, but Steve would always move slow to give Tony time to acclimate. He would move and push in, his length sliding deliciously into Tony's channel until he would seat himself fully, and Tony would feel the depth, the fullness of the man's heavy and thick cock inside of him.
As he stood by the window Steve was unsure exactly how he felt. He should feel relieved, but if not for the centipede he and Tony never would have gotten to where they were now. Steve never would have admitted his feelings to himself let alone tell Tony how he felt.
“See? Now you are getting where I was getting with it. Those models can be so full of themselves.” Sam stood up from the table to return to his duties. “Good luck with it and let me see how it turns out when you're finished.”
Instead Steve felt the wet warm suction of the centipede's gaping maw enclose around the tip. Steve groaned around the appendage in his mouth. God it was sucking him, its mouth was so wet and warm the suction so tight around his cock. Steve began to thrust wildly into the gaping maw all while Tony's own cock slid over his oversensitive prostate. Steve pulled his mouth off of the slender penis to catch his breath.
“You have a sensitive prostate don't you? Want me to finger you soldier? Stroke over your pleasure spot until your a spurting mess?” Tony purred into Steve's ear while still fondling his balls.
“I'm no ordinary alpha. The serum changed a lot and only made me more...let's say...potent.”
“Ah! Steve I-I think, I think I'm close.” Tony moaned. It felt as if every nerve ending was on fire. Steve's warmth above him, he could feel the subtle weight of Steve's body against him as he drove his cock into him repeatedly. Tony had been on edge since Steve had worked him open with his fingers and every push and pull was only drawing him ever closer to tipping over into that blissful edge of orgasm. Tony's own cock ached and throbbed with neglect, and precome leaked profusely from the tip dripping down onto the sheets beneath him.
Tony nodded slowly, his eyes trailing over Steve's naked form. Steve's body was perfection, and Tony hungered for it. He wanted to touch, kiss, lick, every inch of that gorgeous body. Tony bit his lip a small moan escaping him as he bucked his hips up against Steve. Feeling the naked glide of skin on skin it was incredible "Yes that's so much better." Tony leaned up and kissed Steve urgently, his hands running over his chest.
“Of course Steve! Do you have any idea what this actually does?” Steve had opened his mouth to reply but thought better of it and sighed. All he knew was that it kept Tony alive, but he had no idea how. “When I was captured in Afghanistan one of my own missiles exploded nearby and pelted my chest with shrapnel. This stops it from reaching my heart.” He tapped it. “...then my business partner wanted me to build more and I refused so he took mine and left me here to die. Fortunately I had the spare I had built in the caves and I managed to get it implanted in time. This isn't some technological marvel that everyone makes it out to be, it isn't pretty, it isn't a blessing, it is a fucking curse that almost got me killed on more than one occasion.” Tony exhaled sharply and ran a hand through his hair. He kept going, kept talking because it was like the floodgates had been opened and he was letting loose all the insecurities he had so carefully hidden away.
“Yep! Piece of cake.” Tony answered simply, but Pepper wasn't buying it.
“Do what exactly?” Tony asked.
“That's it Tony.” Steve encouraged as he worked his fingers in and out of Tony, and slowly scissoring them to stretch him further. “Focus on how good it feels.” He pumped his fingers into the tight hole over and over, each pump getting easier, the glide smoother as Tony opened up for him. Tony turned his head and kissed Steve's lips sloppily between his gasping shudders and moans. If Tony was this responsive to fingesr Steve could only imagine how it would be once Tony had a cock in him. He needed to know.
Tony shook his head and tightened his grip around Steve's cock as he stroked him from base to tip. “and I don't care if it hurts.” Tony leaned up and trailed his lips along Steve's neck to shoulder. Sucking and nipping gently across Steve's skin before he bit down harder at the juncture of shoulder and neck. Steve sucked in a surprised breath and let it out in a quiet moan, it was painful but it felt good at the same time, something inside of him twisted pleasantly and more precum beaded and drizzled from the tip. “It's a good kind of hurt.” Tony mumbled while mouthing over the forming bruise.
Steve had to draw it, he had to capture this sexy, dirty image. He set to work drawing in the detail of Tony's most private area. Steve never imagined he'd be doing this, enthusiastically, drawing in a man's erection, wondering what it felt like...the weight of it in his hand, the silky smoothness of the skin. Steve swiped his tongue over his lips, thinking of what a man's cock tasted like. That bead of fluid forming at the tip and dribbling down, pooling onto Tony's stomach. The arousal was heavy in the air Steve could smell it, so masculine, natural, he craved for a touch to Tony's skin as he etched in the lines and shadow on Tony's manhood
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony paced a bit in the small space, Steve just standing there made him feel jittery. He needed to expel some energy somehow. Tony continued “Nebula and I had no idea what to expect once we arrived back on Earth so a decision had to be made. I couldn't fight with a broken arm and if Thanos was still here I had to make sure I could be of some use, I knew I'd have to fight again. Once on the ship she found that hunk of junk but it would work. She herself had gone through a number of cybernetic enhancements and replacements and was capable of attaching the new one. So, I told her to do it.”
Steve was there holding it out with an apologetic expression. “Sorry I couldn't be there I thought this would be appropriate. Not everyday you graduate college, and with two masters.” Steve smiled warmly as Tony took the cake.
“How-how long?” Steve forced out. “How long have I been here?”
“This...is pollen collected from our little friend in the lab. Don't worry its been heavily diluted so neither of us will go into the exact same sex-craze as we had before but-” Tony wet his bottom lip with a swipe of his tongue before continuing. “this may give you enough of a sexual urge to bypass the mental block.”
Steve gripped Tony's hips tightly as he increased his pace, driving his length harder into Tony and hitting the man's pleasure spot repeatedly. Tony dropped down to rest his weight on his elbows making his back arch in a perfect curve. Steve dropped his weight over Tony, bracing his arms on either side of him and worked his hips to thrust his cock harder into Tony. Steve was in a complete pleasure high, Tony's body was hot, it squeezed around his shaft so well, the velvety walls almost massaging along Steve's sensitive cock. Tony's body took him perfectly, as if he had been made to take Steve like this.
Business? Steve wondered was that business tracking himself? Sam? Natasha? And Wanda? Or was it more to do with the Sokovian accords. Asking would probably only cause their already delicate situation to escalate so Steve shrugged. "Let's say I'm traveling, and like you, looking for a place to unwind.”
In response Tony gently pushed Steve back onto the bed, and crawled over top of him and kissed Steve breathless. It was a less fierce dominating kiss, it was deep and romantic, and Steve found himself clinging to the man above him. He never wanted to let go of Tony ever again, and that wasn't only an effect of the pollen.
The first time Tony realized he may not be the only one with a problem. He bumped into Steve in the early morning which wasn't typical for Tony to be heading to his workshop at that particular time. He had a difficult time sleeping and had decided it was best to get an early start on his latest project before he had to get cleaned up for his board meeting later. The odd thing was Steve had been in Tony's workshop. Tony walked in and Steve jumped dropping something to the workbench and he spun around with a blush forming on his cheeks.
So perhaps asking a woman to model was a bit out of his comfort zone, as Steve wasn't entirely sure he could separate the idea of sex and art just yet. He wondered if it would be easier to ask for a male at first. With no difference in anatomy it may help to ease Steve into the process of drawing another human being, and he didn't have to start right off with a nude. With his mind made up Steve had ventured down to the lower chambers of the castle and met with Master Fury to set up a meeting with his concubine.
There was no worry about the noise, the penthouse was soundproofed enough that no one would hear a thing, but in a fit of pride Steve wanted the others to know. The sounds of passion the grunting, moaning, the unmistakable sound of men fucking, there would be no question what was happening in that room. Steve didn't hold any sound back and he took it as a compliment that Tony was incapable of staying quiet. Especially once Steve had reached his arm around Tony's middle and grasped his neglected cock.
Steve typically didn't like it when people targeted him for personal amusement, however this was different. He could tell that Tony wasn't doing it in malice, it was probably to help loosen the tension in the room and he found that he was actually laughing. “I walked right into that one didn't I?”
Steve lightly caressed Tony's face and planted a soft kiss on his lips. “You're sure you're ready for that? It isn't always pleasant the first time.” Steve warned. The last thing he wanted was to hurt Tony, which with anal was a very high possibility.
“Do you believe me now?” Steve mustered and opened his eyes to gaze up at the gorgeous form of Tony Stark. Tony was tilting his head in confusion. “I told you I thought the arc reactor was beautiful.”
“I-I'm sorry please come in.” Steve finally found his voice again and he stepped aside to let his guest enter. The concubine didn't say a word, but walked gracefully into the room. “You-You can go ahead and sit there. Just make yourself c-comfortable.” Steve felt himself stammer slightly. He hadn't known what to expect from a male concubine and so far he felt thrown off kilter. This individual was gorgeous in ways that Steve had never known to be possible for a man.
“Alright let's hear it.”
There was an amused chuckle from Tony and he perched onto the edge of the chaise. “Wow you are easy to rile up. I knew what you meant, but I just couldn't resist. Wanted to see how you'd react.”
“As long as no one else gets to touch you.” Tony stated, he ran a hand down to Steve's hip and slipped it under, angling his pelvis so he could grasp at the perfect globe of his ass. “This is mine. All mine.”
“You feel so good.” Tony continued. “Tight and warm. You were made for this, to be fucked.” He assisted the best he could with lifting Steve up off his cock and sinking back down. The room was permeated with the wicked sounds of wet flesh slapping together, Steve's thighs were coated in lube and sweat as he sank down onto Tony. The cheeks of his ass clapping against the top of Tony's thighs as he rode him harder. Both men moaning together with every shift and slide of their bodies. Steve's cock was bouncing with his rise and fall, bobbing in rhythm with his every move.
“Captain Rogers...Sir is requesting your assistance upstairs.”
“Steve...god I feel so...so full.” Tony panted as he acclimated to the intrusion in his body. It wasn't exactly a good feeling, but Tony had to admit it wasn't really bad either. Steve then gave a gentle nudge of his hips, driving himself just a little further in and the head of his cock struck against Tony's prostate. “Oh my-oh fuck!” Tony gasped. Steve took that as a good sign and did it again, slow gentle pushes into Tony. Steve was in no hurry to get off himself just yet as this was all about Tony, and he was determined to make his first time as memorable as possible.
Tony exited the elevator and walked into the gym, but stopped mid-step as his senses picked up on the signals from the alpha in the room. There was no mistaking the scent in the air, Tony had been around it long enough the previous day to know what Steve smelled like when he was aroused. It was almost like a reflex. Tony felt himself grow excited from the aroma alone. His baser instincts taking control and recognizing what lay ahead for him...pleasure. Tony's cock was getting hard. He stared at Steve's backside as he moved, striking the punching bag with precision and determination. The sweat on his skin, how the muscles in his arms tensed and flexed. Tony raked his eyes down the man's muscled back how he could see defining outlines through Steve's tight t-shirt. The soldier's narrow waist and perfectly round and sculpted buttocks.
“Knock yourself out Cap.” Tony called from the closet. He waited a few moments to see if Tony came out, when he didn't Steve got out of the rumpled bed and walked over to the closet.
Steve sighed again and absent absentmindedly stroked his fingers along Tony's arm. “You need to understand Tony, no one will blame you, but if anyone finds out about this? about us being intimate with each other? I could face some very unfortunate consequences. Howard would surely find some legal way to keep me away from you. Two fellas together isn't exactly well accepted. I mean it's better from when I was a kid, but I don't want you to face any of that.”
“Not going to happen!” Tony ground out, he dropped to his knee the effort of holding Thanos' fist too taxing on him. He had to make a bold move and fast otherwise this was going to end quickly. The armor wasn't replacing itself anymore, he had probably seconds before Thanos ended him. He couldn't hold the block, his arm was shaking from the strain and the pain was searing up his nerves like fire. Tony had to buy the others time, maybe they could escape with Strange and the stone.
Steve couldn't resist the full body shiver that ran through him. Tony had raised an amused eyebrow as he moved off the stool and tugged Steve along to follow.
“You are too...I mean...I don't know if I'd use pretty, but well not that you aren't...I...Uh” Steve fumbled. It didn't seem proper to call another man pretty, but he felt that Tony was owed some compliment. Tony smirked there was a playful light in his eyes.
"I wasn't sure what to expect, perhaps you had just been leading me on for kicks.” Tony eyed Steve as he took his jacket off, studied him, really took the time to appreciate Steve's physique, and he truly was something to be admired. Tony had to even the odds. Steve had thrown him off with the kiss and he was trying to make him falter now. Tony walked up to him, putting his hand on Steve's arm. "After all...we did just meet." Tony pushed Steve against the wall,and pressed his lips to Steve's in a hasty kiss.
“Oh-Oh fuck, oh fuck oh fuck!” Tony chanted as his entire body quivered, his cock spilled over Steve's fist and abdomen as the orgasm rippled through him. Tony tensed up, full body everything tight and clenching and Steve came again too. Tony sagged down, using his hands to keep himself upright but his shoulders and head dropped as he let the wave of post coital bliss just wash over him. Steve sat up and gathered Tony in his arms and kissed him sweetly. They remained like that for a time, just lazily kissing and coming down from the endorphin high.
That was how they found themselves here. Steve set the ax down and walked over to the house up to Tony and leaned down to give him a kiss.
“Yeah, yeah still with you.” Tony replied in a rough voice. Steve settled in close to Tony on their bed holding him protectively.
“You keep a bottle of lube in your belt?” He asked in confusion.
Steve tilted his head in uncertainty. “what is plan B?” he asked.
"Nice room." Steve commented as he took in the surroundings, it was a lot nicer than what he and the others had been staying in lately. He turned and looked back at Tony with a small smirk. "You seemed surprised Tony. Didn't think I'd show?" He asked while he took his jacket off, and put it on the chair.
“You recovered that quickly?”
Tony had disappeared back into the lab and Steve was once again left alone with his problem. He took a cold shower as Tony had suggested and managed to sleep for a couple of hours before the morning, but missed his usual early run. Steve only felt exhausted at this point and the serum was doing little to alleviate the side affects. He felt moody and irritable but did his best not to take it out any of the others. In the end Steve found it would be best to isolate himself until he had an opportunity to speak with Tony again. He wondered what sort of plan the resident genius was cooking up, and if it had any hope of working. Tony was an engineer not a biologist, but Steve believed if anyone could help him at this point it had to be Tony Stark.
Tony visibly swallowed and slowly he lifted his metallic prosthetic. He clapped it down into Steve's palm and entwined the shining red fingers between Steve's. They stood there a moment holding hands silently, Steve with a look of utter relief flashed a smile at Tony and they gave one another a brief nod.
“But-”
Soon Steve was thrusting his hips back against Tony's wet coated fingers and crying out with each motion as Tony brushed against his spot. “Ahh ohh ohh yes.” Steve moaned. “More, Tony please give me more!”
Steve froze after his last punch and settled his hands on the bag in front of him. He set his forehead against the leather and sighed. Why? Why was the universe torturing him further?
“Hmm” Tony hummed with a smile and opened his eyes, looking over to Steve. “So...was I a sufficient model for you Steve?”
Steve knew just what angles to thrust at to hit his prostate. Tony arched up against him, rolling his hips back with Steve's thrusts, chasing the pleasure he was providing. "Yes, yes Steve, God yes that feels so good! fuck yes!" Tony moaned, hey he warned him he was vocal. "that's it, fuck me good and hard, I can take it! Yes! that's good, so good!"
“Gah-! That's the worst part!” With a sigh Tony relaxed back onto the reclining chair with Steve still nearby. “Okay...you were a good assistant.” Tony admitted with his eyes closed. Letting his body finally return to a state of normal.
Before his was even finished coming his cock began to swell and the knot formed sealing itself within Tony. The two of them caught their breath, Steve still on his knees holding Tony's hips, and Tony stomach down on the bed, his head buried in his arms as he came down from the the post orgasm high.
“No...No we stopped you!” Tony argued. “This is over, it's been over.” Tony could feel it, he could feel Steve's hands on him, he could feel his warmth, the tickle of his breath on his skin. That had been too real, it had happened...hadn't it?
Tony shifted and crawled over to Steve and laid down beside him, the centipede shifted its body to make room and even pressed its body up close to Tony cushioning them both. Steve turned his head and looked over Tony with hungry eyes. He reached over, curling his fingers into Tony's dark hair and pulled him forward. They kissed, desperate and aggressive, Tony gripped his own cock and began to stroke himself. Steve was panting heavily, his mouth hung open as the suckling mouth continued its assault. He felt something, wet and slippery sliding into him and probing further. It-it had a tongue? Steve's body shuddered and he arched his back up from the floor.
Tony shook his head. “You don't understand Steve I cold lose everything if people knew. My company would suffer, hell even the Avengers could suffer. They could remove me from the team!”
“You can do it babe, come for me.” Tony encouraged through soft panting breaths. He was working his fingers in and out at a rapid pace to keep Steve on edge. Steve was moaning, and writhing on the bed. Every brush of Tony's fingers across his prostate felt incredible, the warmth pooled and grew inside the pleasure ratcheted higher and higher until he felt he couldn't take it anymore. His balls felt tight and throbbed, his cock was stiff and twitching with each stroke over the sensitive bundle of nerves inside his body.
-End-
Tony pulled Steve up to kiss him as they came down from the high of their orgasms. Steve was gentle as he pulled out wincing slightly when he saw the look of discomfort on Tony's face. Steve rolled over onto his back beside Tony, and the silence settled over them. The game had been long abandoned now here they were again...and Tony frankly had no clue where they stood now. He was still bitter, and hurt...but it didn't burn inside him as it had before. Neither one of them said a word there was nothing to say really.
Steve had drawn himself back up to full height and turned, his hands resting on the front of the belt. “Stark, can you give me a hand with this?” Tony had snapped his jaw closed and gave Steve his a-typical disinterested expression, but approached the computer console anyways to assist the Captain. He pushed the inappropriate thoughts to the back of his mind and believed that would be the end of it.
“Yeah...like Clint's, out in the country, there's enough work that would need to be done to keep us busy.”
Steve's cock was pressing more insistently against the fabric of his trousers, it throbbed sympathetically for touch, specifically Tony's touch, he watched the skillful fingers rub and fondle. By keeping his eyes on the paper Steve thought he could keep his focus on the drawing and wouldn't be tempted with lewd desires. Only the drawing was Tony nude, his cock full and luscious between his legs. No matter what Steve tuned his attention on it was filled with sexual energy.
Tony scrabbled his hands over Steve's uniform, searching for the releases to undress him. He wanted skin, he needed to feel another living body next to his own to be reminded that they were both here, they survived the dusting. Steve seemed to register what Tony was trying to accomplish and he pulled back just enough to assist in unbuckling and unsnapping the catches of his uniform. He shucked the top part of the uniform, his broad chest now exposed to Tony and Tony ran his hands over pectorals, palms brushing Steve's nipples and caressing his shoulders and arms. Steve shivered from the touch and his breath caught in his throat. The surface of the prosthetic he had expected to feel cold like metal, but it wasn't it was warm and left behind a subtle but pleasant tingle from the energy that thrummed through it.
Steve's head snapped up. “Isn't it? It's why you've avoided me? I never intended for things to get so out of hand. I thought I was helping you, but I know now. I understand it all, you weren't being rational. The heat was so intense and you needed the relief. I don't want you thinking I'm like all those other alphas that can't control himself around an omega.”
“So I take that and go on my way?” Steve asked with diminishing hope. “and then what? Report to you if it worked or not?”
“Poor choice Stark. You cannot defeat me, this is all for the good of the universe for life itself to prosper life must be taken.”
“Hm?” Tony mumbled apparently already half asleep.
Steve reached up and took Tony's metallic prosthetic in his hand and pressed a kiss to the metal palm. Tony involuntarily shivered as his body registered the soft touch of Steve's lips. “You shouldn't have had to go through this alone.” He whispered gently and trailed his fingers down over the metal surface. Tony reached up and stroked his fingers over Steve's beard, letting the course hairs tickle and scratch over the artificial hand.
Before they had to be quiet for fear of anyone discovering their secret. As much as everyone had been hurting after the initial dusting they both had concerns over what the others would think of them, think of Tony for falling into Steve's bed after losing Pepper so soon. It didn't matter anymore and Tony knew Steve wanted to hear him lose control. So he did. Tony arched his back, he keened, he moaned, and let Steve drive every noise possible from him.
“You didn't let me finish.” Sam said. “There is a type of servant that probably would be happy to help you out and given what you are asking, way more tame than what they usually do.” Steve didn't follow and raised an eyebrow in question. “The concubines.”
Steve closed his eyes and leaned in, pressing his lips to Tony's in a chaste kiss. Tony felt as if his heart would give out on him at any moment, Steve was...kissing him...they were kissing. The uncomfortable twisting of his insides uncoiled and for the first time in months Tony felt a balance, a peace within himself he was unaware he was even capable of experiencing again. Steve had let Tony's wrists go and reached a hand to cradle Tony's neck and the other wrapped possessively around Tony's waist.
They made love, and Tony swore he was going to either buy or build them a new bed that didn't squeak as often as this one did. It was comical at times, except when it wasn't, and it was incredibly distracting in the throes of his passion. Steve moved above him, bracketing his arms on either side of Tony and leaned down to kiss him as he thrust his hips rhythmically.
Steve gave Tony a final kiss before he stepped backwards keeping an eye on Tony while he found his way to the bed sitting down and tilted his head. "What is a good time for you?" He smirked leaning back on his elbow running his hand over his chest and along his thigh while keeping a hungry gaze on Tony.
“Ride me Tony.”
As the pleasure waves receded Tony pulled out, and stripped the condom off himself. Tony didn't look at her, he couldn't bring himself to look at her as he stood up from the bed, still panting slightly to catch his breath Tony walked out on her and shut himself in the bathroom. Tony normally wasn't so callous, and he rarely left a bed partner unsatisfied, but he couldn't pretend that everything was okay. He couldn't even come until he thought about having sex with Steve and that was an alarming realization. Tony turned the shower on and tried to scrub away the dirty feeling.
“What? We're all thinking it.” Tony peered into the cage as the centipede scurried around on its many legs. It was approximately six inches in length, and two inches in diameter its segmented body appeared to be more organic and fleshy like a worm. It was a deep purple color, the legs and underbelly were red, Tony wasn't exactly an expert on arthropods, but he was certain something like this was probably some kind of new species. After all, why else would Hydra have the little creature in a lab in the middle of the mountains?
“I won't ask the servants, they are paid for a job which is cleaning, and cooking, I won't exploit them. I know of too many lords that do so already and I won't be one of them.” Steve replied with a frown.
There was no sense in looking back at what ifs, and could haves...the damage was done and all they could do was move forward. Steve's breathing eased and he felt the worst of the anguish leaving him, his mind clearing he looked up at the sky at the stars above. Thanos was out there still and they had to find a way to stop him from committing such an atrocity again. He stood and wiped the dirt from his pants and let out a heavy sigh. This war for the infinity stones appeared to be over, but they couldn't give up just yet. Somehow they'd find a way to undo it or avenge the lives of all those who had been lost and they'd do it as a team.
Tony was moaning now. “Oh that feels good.”
Steve arched his back, pulling Tony's hair as he moaned. "Tony that feels amazing, it's so good." He was panting. He was breathing heavily. When had Tony gotten so good at blowjobs? He wondered. Steve tried not to thrust too hard into Tony's hot mouth, but Tony was moaning around him. He liked it rough.
“Take it easy you're doing great. You're really tight so it will hurt a bit...” Tony just silently nodded and focused on keeping his breathing even. Steve chewed his own lip in a bit of worry, he was much larger than two fingers wide. Tony would need a lot more prep to take a man of his size. Perhaps going so fast was a mistake.
Steve wasn't saying no, so Tony kept going. He ran his tongue down the length and back to the tip. He took the head into his mouth, slowly sucking it and bobbed his head a few times, taking Steve's cock deep into his mouth. Tony backed off catching his breath, running his tongue along Steve's impressive cock, tasting the bitter precome leaking from the tip as he licked the head a few more times. Tony slowly took Steve's full length into his mouth, deep-throating him like an expert.
Steve wrapped an arm around Tony. “I...I'm happy to have made your first time good.” Steve replied softly. He held Tony close to him and lightly traced his fingers along his sweaty skin.
Steve's jaw nearly dropped in surprise at how causal Tony was being about exposing himself. He tried to keep his gaze from roaming over the concubine's nude form, but he couldn't resist. His eyes slid over Tony to the prize between his legs, a finely shaped cock, half hard and resting against Tony's thigh, long, not overly thick. Steve swallowed hard, throat clicking from the sudden dryness and averted his gaze. To his horror he realized he had been staring...he had been staring at another man's cock.
Now Sam was suggesting that he invite one to his chamber to act as a model for an evening. Which meant conversation to keep them at least somewhat entertained as they sat for him, and what would he talk about with a concubine? Tell me about your work? What do you do in your free time? If it led to anything of their bedroom activities would they ask about his experience?
“...I can't come.” Steve finally admitted in a broken tone.
“Damn it.” He cursed quietly. “Be right there!” He called and picked up the candles quickly and threw them haphazardly back into the cabinet, only for them to roll back out. Steve caught a few then shoved them back inside and slammed the cabinet closed. Turning and not used to the way he had reorganized the room he nearly tripped over his stool and ended up hitting his knee on the edge of the chaise lounge. Limping over to the door he opened it and tried to recollect himself while wincing in pain from his knee. “Sorry for the delay please co-” Steve stopped mid sentence as he finally brought his eyes up to view his model for the evening.
“We split and I don't know where they ended up, they were gonna grab the stone from KnowWhere but he obvious had all six so...I don't even know if any of them are alive.” Rocket explained.
Steve got up from the bed and slipped on a pair of sweatpants making sure to adjust himself so his erection wasn't as obvious, and then pulled on a fresh t-shirt. Sleep wouldn't come easy, that he had learned the past few nights while squirming in discomfort from his persistent hard-on, so the best option was to run himself ragged. The gym was unoccupied at this time of night leaving Steve the opportunity to work out his frustration.
Tony gently tugged at Steve's hair pulling him back from his chest, he was breathing heavily his chest rising and falling as he stared down at Steve with intensity. Steve found himself unable to look away, his gaze locked with Tony's his lips parted as he panted for breath feeling a rush of energy coursing through him. His hand touched Tony's face as they drew in closer, he closed his eyes leaning in towards Tony closer-closer. Their lips touched, gentle and hesitant at first, but Tony took control right away deepening the kiss by slipping his tongue into Steve's mouth.
Something warm, wet, and stiff slipped between Tony's cheeks making him gasp in surprise. It was slender and rubbed deliciously against his own rim. Steve beneath him whined from lack of stimulation, Tony turned his attention back to the blonde in front of him, to Steve's perfectly shaped ass. Tony ran his hands over the round cheeks, he squeeze and kneaded the flesh with his fingers, and spread them apart to gaze at Steve's wet hole. Behind him the centipede gently probed with its own slicked appendage. Tony could feel it, but it wasn't terribly invasive, in fact it felt good in a teasing way.
Tony walked over to the bed and sat at the edge, he let his hands wander over Steve's form. He felt over his chest, pectorals, muscular arms, chiseled abs, narrow waist and strong thighs. Tony's touches were like silk on skin, feather light teasing little tickles, it made Steve shiver and his cock ached for a touch too. Tony had a small smile gracing his lips as he idly traced his fingers along Steve's skin, and his eyes only seemed to brighten in satisfaction when he heard Steve's breathy gasps and small moans once he traced a line from the base of Steve's cock to his tip. Tony then straddled Steve on the bed and reached back holding Steve's cock by the base as he positioned himself above nestling the tip of Steve's cock against his cleft.
“Easy for you to say.” Tony turned his head and met Steve's eyes. “Tough to keep a positive.” Steve didn't want to argue tonight, instead he just pressed a gentle kiss to Tony's lips. Then another, and another, slowly parting his lips for Tony and allowing him to slip his tongue in. They made out for several long minutes while Steve petted his hands along Tony's body. He tried again to coax Tony's penis into hardness, but tonight his body refused to cooperate. Tony grunted and reached his hand down and closed it over Steve's wrist to stop him.
Time seemed to slow down drastically after Tony left that night. It was as if the world just decided to want to turn on its axis slower now that things were possibly looking up for Steve and Tony. Steve knew that wasn't really happening, but that’s what it felt like. It didn’t help that he barely heard from Tony, either. Tony texted him a few times each week, but not as much as Steve had hoped. He supposed it was best for Tony though not to contact him that much while he was sorting out his feelings.
Steve nodded and opened up his menu, trying to look busy. Tony watched him for a few moments before glancing back at his own menu. For the next twenty minutes or so, Steve was quiet. After he had figured out what he wanted to eat, he switched his attention to two of the guys sitting next to him – Clint and Sam. Apparently they were in their class, too, but they had just transferred into the school this year. Tony busied himself with talking to Rhodey for a bit until the waitress came over and asked them what they would want for a drink.
“Damnit,” Steve muttered. Drawing a bowl with some lemons in it shouldn’t be this difficult. He had drawn stuff like this multiple times, back when he had first come out of the ice. This should be a walk in the park.
“Steve?” Tony asked. He sounded surprised for some reason.
“Steve!”
Steve chuckled at that. “That’s one way to look at it.”
This is a short chapter but I hope you enjoy it!
“I was talking to you right before it happened.”
Tony shrugged. “It's pretty clear...just tell me something about you.”
“Yes,” Tony breathed against his mouth.
The rest of the day went by thankfully without thinking too much about Tony. Whenever he felt his mind start to wander, he’d force it back to the task at hand. Not that he was always successful at that. But he supposed at least being able to control his thoughts a bit was progress. At the end of the day, Steve said goodbye to some of the people he had been supervising and walked towards the exit. He walked to the parking spot where his motorcycle was parked. His phone buzzed in his pocket right before he was about to head home; he took his phone out of his pocket and glanced at the screen. A text was sprawled across the screen.
Just one more to go!
“Why would I lie?”
Steve’s eyebrows shot up. “Did you know that those are complementary colors?” The words were out of his mouth before he could stop them.
Steve’s gaze fixed upon the screen. He hadn’t seen Tony since that night where he drawn that art piece for him. What should he do? Certainly he couldn’t see him again. Not after what he thought, what he almost did. But…Bucky had told him to let Tony dictate things. So, did that mean that he should meet Tony for dinner? Steve wasn’t sure how long he stared at the screen for, but eventually he felt his thumbs moving across the screen, tapping letters the letters needed for a message. He sent the message and let out a breath. Well, there went his plan for avoiding Tony.
Whenever Steve tried to talk about this with Natasha, she just told him that he was avoiding talking to Tony and he had to talk to him. It wasn’t that he was purposely avoiding the topic. It was just that…if he talked to Tony, there was a chance that Tony would not want to hear what hear what he would have to say. Or, he could accept his apology, but things between them could stay the same. He tried to express that fear to Nat, but she always said that he had to talk to him.
He glanced at the clock and groaned; the event was in twenty minutes and Steve was still not on his way. He wasn’t even dressed yet - he had just gotten out of the shower. He
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve said.
He planned on trying to draw quickly though so Tony wouldn’t get bored or find that the situation was too awkward since Steve wouldn’t be talking. He had tried to make conversation while drawing before, but it hadn’t turned out well. Steve had told Bucky that he didn’t need to keep it, but Bucky had kept it. He had said that it would be rude to throw it out, especially since Steve had spent so long working on it.
Steve stared at him; he remembered. His pizza order wasn’t odd, but he was still surprised that Tony remembered since Steve typically was the one who ordered food when they were at the facility.
“Of course I am,” Nat said. “Let us know how it goes, okay?”
Here's the next chapter! I apologize for the delay.
For the next hour or so, Steve sat there, moving his pencil across the canvas, trying to capture the way Tony was sitting, his facial expression, the slight creases in his shirt and pants. Some people wouldn’t care much about the latter aspects of the drawing, but Steve wanted this to look as realistic as he possibly could. Besides, it wasn’t every day that he had a chance to draw someone famous. Sure, Tony wasn’t that famous compared to actors and such, but he was still famous. And surprisingly, Tony stayed silent throughout the whole process, allowing Steve to concentrate on what he was working on. When Steve thought that he had finished drawing Tony, he smiled at him.
The beeping of the heart monitor caused Steve to wake. He groaned as his body lit up in pain; it felt like someone had burned half of his body. Blinking a few times, the room came into view. He was lying on a bed, a heart monitor on his right side. Sunlight poured in through the white blinds that adorned the window. On his left, there was a chair. A man with short brown hair sat in in it; cuts marked the side of his face. His head was tilted downwards, his gaze focused on the book that was sat on his lap.
Steve took a long sip of his drink. Anything to buy him some time.
Steve frowned. “Do what?”
Hope that you enjoyed it!
“You think so?”
Since he still had a lot of free time, Steve decided to enroll in an art class. He had been wanting to take one since he was in his 20s, so he decided that it was time. He decided to take an introduction to art class since the school was only a couple of blocks away from his apartment. The classes weren’t mandatory either, so if he had to miss one or two due to work, he wouldn’t be breaking any rules.
Steve could feel his cheeks burn just a bit under his gaze. One drink wouldn’t be bad. And he couldn’t quite remember when the last time he had an alcoholic drink.
Steve knew that he could contact Tony, but he wasn’t sure if he should. When they parted last semester, Tony had said that they would have ‘hang out’ in the fall. Steve took that to mean that Tony would contact him.
Surprisingly, Steve’s breathing hadn’t skyrocketed to a fast pace only ten minutes before Tony arrived. He had thought that it would, given what happened the last time Tony was here. He was still nervous that Tony wouldn’t like how the portrait turned out, but he couldn’t do anything about that now. Besides, from what he could remember, Tony
Steve shook his head. “Of course not.” He could never forget about this place.
“Thank you,” Steve told the driver. He gave him some money and got out of the car. His hands ran over his suit, smoothing out any wrinkles in his suit. Some people dressed in long gown dresses and suits brushed past him. One of the women muttered something about Tony Stark to a man who was next to her. Well, at least he knew that he was in the right place. Taking in a breath, Steve followed them into the hotel.
“That’s okay, Tony. I can get my own copy.”
“I’m being honest, Nat. It’s our night.”
When Steve got home that day, he told Bucky to not make a mess because he had a guest coming over. He spent the afternoon bustling about the apartment, trying to clean it. It wasn’t that the apartment was dirty – both of them were pretty neat, but he wanted it to look nice. Presentable. Especially since it wasn’t as fancy as Tony’s place. Bucky sat on the couch, and watched Steve with an amused smile.
Feel free to leave comments!
(See the end of the chapter for
Ah. And this is what Steve had been so worried about. He glanced down at the table.
He didn’t draw people very often, but he did enjoy it.
“Why are you staring at me like I have multiple heads?” Tony asked, tilting his head to the side.
“Did you ever think about not being honest?”
“Valid point. I’m just surprised. You haven’t invited me to your place before.”
“That’s my name.”
“You seem to stare a lot.”
exactly?”
“Steve,” Tony said gently. He crossed the room and sat down on the end of Steve’s bed. “Do you want to talk about it?”
“I thought so. So, I was playing in my lab and I came up with this.” Tony held up his hand which had a bracelet wrapped around his palm, with a small circular screen in the middle. The date, time, and location was on the screen. “It’s a time-travel GPS. It allows you to travel to the location and date of your choosing.”
“Well, that was certainly a surprise,” Steve said, referring to his entrance.
Along with the message was the address of the place. Steve smiled softly at it; he knew exactly the place Tony had chosen, and thankfully, he had just enough time to get to it.
“My poison?” Steve asked, somewhat offended.
“Then you asked me if I had feelings for anyone. At the time, I told you that I didn’t, which I thought was true. Well…it wasn’t.”
“I found that resentment is corrosive…I much rather go without it,” Tony said.
Steve shrugged. He wasn’t sure about that. He had shown his ex-girlfriend, Peggy them once, and she said that they were good. But he had figured that she had said that because he was her boyfriend at the time.
Thank you for reading this chapter!
“For what?”
Steve thought. But he didn’t voice that thought out loud. “I don’t know; I guess I’m just not used to getting this sort of attention.”
Feel free to comment or leave kudos.
His shoulders stiffened at the thought of Tony setting him up with someone. He trusted Tony’s judgment…but no, he didn’t want him setting him up with anyone. Not just because he thought that the relationship wouldn’t go anywhere, but because…it felt wrong, for some reason. Steve shrugged; he took a swig of his beverage.
Around his waist was a red silk, low on his hips it was intricately wrapped and tied off in the front. The excess fabric covered his groin and hung down to about his knees. Steve noted the trail of dark hair that led from the man's navel down below the red silk. Typically from his understanding concubines were often kept shaved for the enjoyment of their lords. That included chest, underarms, navel, legs, arms, and even the groin. Perhaps someone preferred him like this, less boyish and more of a man.
“No...It's not!” Steve bit out forcefully.
Tony glanced at the destruction around him, Titan had already seen the destructive force of Thanos' power If he and the Avengers couldn't stop him this would be the fate of Earth as well. Thanos stalked towards Tony, his gait long and confident, his heavy footfalls sending the dust up in clouds before him. Tony narrowed his eyes on the otherworldly being, he refused to give up even in the face of a hopeless battle such as this. It was all up to him now, Spiderman, and the Guardians were no where in sight, Dr. Strange's magic was no use against the energy of the stones. Their very realities could be shifted and manipulated by the power of the stones.
Tony shouldered his backpack and looked over to Steve as they walked through the palace to the outside. After a few weeks of recovery for Tony, Steve and the rest of the Avengers decided that it was time to leave Wakanda and offer their assistance to the rest of the world that surely needed it. Wakanda offered limited supplies and would be in contact with the Avengers if any new developments were found. Thor, Rocket and Nebula had gone into Quill's ship in search of any leads on the stones, on Thanos, also to find any potential allies that could aid them if possible.
“Three days...” Steve sighed and thumped his head against the back of the bed. He sniffled again, what he would give to have use of his hands to blow his nose. “and...Tony is he?”
When typical masturbation habits didn't suffice Steve switched it up to more extreme practices. He used fingers in his ass, a dildo, a vibrator, but that too proved fruitless. Steve sat on the edge of his bed feeling completely rotten. He began to wonder if there was something else that the centipede had done to him that Bruce's tests hadn't caught. Was Tony experiencing this problem as well? It wasn't as if Steve could really ask though. They didn't talk about the centipede, Tony was still performing research but he never discussed any of his findings with Steve.
Steve turned his head, panting and moaning as he rocked his own hips and used the bugs appendages as his own personal sex toy. “Ah-ah-ah!” Steve was moaning with each deep thrust of the shaft into his body the tip rubbing deliciously over his pleasure spot. The legs enclosed over his own cock squeezed him and the motion of his own rutting rubbed his length along the soft ridges. Steve felt nearly delirious with the pleasure coursing through him, from the sensation wrapped around his cock to the jolting, almost electric waves from the prodding of his prostate.
Steve steadied his gaze on Tony for a moment then strode over to him, he closed the gap between them, catching Tony's lips in his in a sweet kiss. Tony made a surprised noise and froze up. This...he hadn't expected this. When Steve broke away he gave Tony an apprehensive look with those mesmerizing blue eyes and even bit his lip as he waited for Tony's reaction. Tony only stared as his brain finally caught up to him. Steve had kissed him. Why would Steve kiss him? They had been arguing about the arc reactor and Steve had been acting weird about it and touching it and...it was in that moment it all clicked into place for Tony. Steve...Steve wanted him scars, arc reactor and all. Tony felt almost overwhelmed with fear at that idea as the last person he had trusted had shattered him, but Steve was staring down at him with those perfect blue eyes and those kissable pouty lips. Tony said to hell with it and pulled Steve towards him and licked his way into the soldier's mouth.
“Oh just...uh trying to get this next spot to look right, it's giving me some trouble.” Steve replied. He had moved further down in the drawing to Tony's taught stomach, and that damn tease of hair leading down past the fabric covering was making Steve's insides twist in anxious wonder.
Steve inserted a second finger, bobbing his head now as he sucked Tony. He drove his fingers deep into him, stimulating his prostate. The first press had Tony groan a deep and sexy noise, and Steve was driven to force it out of him again. He drove his fingers hard and deep into him and pulled back to focus licking and sucking on the head of Tony's cock. Tony's hips were thrusting shallowly forward into Steve's mouth, he needed more he was so close just a little more.
“I don't think you are sick, or deranged. What happened to us, it's unusual it could be described as horrific for some but I honestly don't get that feeling when I think back on it. We're Avengers we take these things in stride.”
“I don't deserve this, I don't deserve you.”
"Well personally a good time always includes a good blowjob." Tony undid Steve's belt then his pants, unzipping them. His eyes darted up to Steve's briefly before easing his hand into his pants and coaxing Steve's large erect cock out. Last chance for him to back out. Tony sank down to his knees, holding Steve by the base and leaned forward to lick the tip, lap up the precome leaking out. Steve watched Tony intently, he took a slow breath in anticipation, his cock twitching. He gasped when Tony licked him.
“Hey there soldier.” Tony purred and he turned onto his side, so Steve could get a good long look at Tony's hardened cock. “Mind helping a fella out?” Steve's mouth felt dry...it was all so overwhelming. His skin felt hot, his clothes were warm...way too warm, and his pants felt unbearably tight as his own cock stiffened.
“It's kind of hard to date in college when you're underage.” Tony sighed. “Girls don't really like guys younger than them, and the ones that did well.” He shrugged. “They just wanted money.” He mumbled.
“Always a kid to me.” Steve had that typical lopsided smile of his as he leaned back on the bed looking at Tony. His gaze flicked over to the bottle on Tony's desk and he cleared his throat. “Speaking of age I am certainly aware that drinking laws have changed in the past 50 years...what's with the sauce?”
Here they were now. Talking tactics, mission. Moving to the next step and working as a team again. Steve knew it was Tony's best method to cope and maybe he could take a page from Tony's book here. Focus on fixing the problem and maybe the rest of the awkwardness would go away. Still, Steve was having a hard time not focusing too closely on Tony's mouth and thinking of how the centipede's sucker like mouth had felt over his cock. He really hoped these inappropriate thoughts would lessen soon.
“I-I don't...understand...” Steve stammered out quietly. “Why are you here? I thought...I didn't think you'd want...” He swallowed hard and dropped his head. It was hard to talk to him, after days of quarantine and thinking of the worst ways this conversation could turn out. There was so much that Steve wanted to say, but now he was at a loss for the words he had obsessively worked over in his head.
“I...” Steve found that he was speechless. Tony had masturbated to thoughts of their experience together? “...I've thought about what we did...” He said in a hushed tone. “I couldn't tell anyone, I believed you would think I was deranged, that I was sick.” Steve felt a warm touch on his cheek and a gentle pressure of fingers coaxing him to turn his head and meet Tony's eyes again.
“I can't I have to go meet with Pepper, and I'm already late.” Tony replied.
Steve stood there silently, still sporting his uniform a bit more worn and the star and stripes blackened out. His hair was longer and he had grown a beard out, in all honesty the look suited him well. Tony wasn't certain what Steve was expecting from him, there was already a thick tension in the air and he wanted it to go away. He didn't need Steve to be a reminder of his past mistakes, sure in the moments he had been staring down death he had all the notions of making it right with Steve, of fixing this...unnamed something...that never had been.
“How much longer am I going to have to wait?” Steve asked, shoulders sagging. He felt that miserable weight settling over him again. The gloom that came with the knowledge that he wasn't out of the woods yet.
Watching Tony in such ecstasy was intoxicating. Steve wanted to see it again, and again, he wanted to see Tony's face as he reached that edge. Steve wrapped a possessive arm around Tony's waist, and subtly adjusted the position of his knees. His cock was still buried in Tony's body.
“Well we're going to die with regrets because there is no changing what happened! They are dead, they are all dead and we are left to figure out whatever this endgame is for ourselves with no help, no-whatever! Steve what are you doing?” Steve had stepped into Tony's space his arms coming up around him. “What the?” Tony moved to shove him back, but Steve caught both of Tony's wrists in his hands.
Steve was moaning with each thrust as Tony's body hugged and clenched him in all the right ways. Tony's slick made the glide smooth and easy for Steve to thrust into him with little resistance. Already Steve could feel the building tension the heated coil growing tighter and tighter with each thrust into his lover. This was a heat he wasn't concerned with making it last. They would have plenty of time to experiment with taking it slow, but right now it was about getting off and working out the frenzy of hormones.
“So tense...you need to take it easy.” Tony observed as he pressed his thumbs into Steve's stiff shoulders. It felt good.
Having enough of watching Steve have all the fun himself the centipede slithered up to him, coiling around Steve's body and rubbing and clutching at his skin almost possessively with its many fleshy legs. Steve shivered from the contact, every brush of its body against his all too sensitive skin sent shocks of pleasure though to his core and cock. Steve found himself on his back the centipede wrapped around him, cushioning his head as it settled its lower body between his legs. Steve looked down finally seeing another appendage jutting out from the centipede's lower body, it was red like the rest of the underbelly and legs, but it was thicker and it too secreted a wet fluid from the tip. It nearly pulsed rhythmically and pressed in closer to Steve's body.
“It's okay Tony...it's okay it's never easy. Just relax, relax for me, breath out there you go. There you go.” He praised and soon his finger was sliding easily into Tony's body. Tony gave soft little mewls and light gasps while Steve worked his finger in and out of him. “You're doing so good.”
Steve's hands roamed up Tony's back and clung tightly to the fabric of his shirt. He felt the need to touch heated skin, to caress, kiss, and lick whatever he could gain access to. It took every ounce of self control not to rip Tony's shirt from his body. Tony walked Steve towards the bed until the back of Steve's knees hit the edge. He dropped down and gazed up at Tony with hunger.
“Fuck, Cap, you can just manhandle me anyway you want?” Tony breathed as he positioned his hands and knees beneath himself and raised his body up. Steve's breath was coming out labored and rapid, he didn't reply he just needed to bury his cock into Tony's perfect supple ass.“Steve?” Tony looked over his shoulder when he hadn't gotten a reply. He saw as Steve reached down and wrapped a hand around the base of his own cock to help guide himself, he shifted his hips so the head pressed right up against Tony's hole. Tony hung his head and squeezed his eyes shut as he prepared for the inevitable discomfort of initial penetration.
“You want some extra hands just in case?” Steve asked her, he needed something to do just a small task to occupy himself so his mind wouldn't trail back, back to watching his friends turn to dust before his eyes.
“Okay.” Steve replied and gave Tony a hard demanding kiss. “Okay.” They continued to kiss and just feel over each other, cataloging everything about each other. Tony ran his fingers through Steve's hair, carding them through the locks and over his beard. The look really did suit him. Steve turned his head and kissed at the palm of the prosthetic, he loosely closed his own hand around the wrist and stroked his thumb over the shiny red metal. Tony stroked over Steve's cheek and then traced a single digit across Steve's lower lip, the readings supplied him with the sensation of the wetness, and the warmth. Steve closed his lips over the tip, stroking his tongue over the finger joints, and sucked it deeper into his mouth.
"Yeah more of that use me Steve. I can take it..." He closed his mouth over him and sucked him hard, griping tighter, and stroking faster. The sound of Tony moaning was such a turn on. Steve wanted to hear more of it. When Tony started to suck harder his hips jerked in response. "Tony....." he panted. He gripped onto Tony's hair while he started to thrust his cock into the wet heat. Steve moaned again, he was so close, so close.
“Hmm why don't you give it something good to swallow?” Tony purred. “And put your own mouth to work?” Steve groaned and then took the appendage back into his mouth, he sucked it greedily while feeding the centipede the length of his own cock. Tony never thought the sight of Steve sucking off a giant sex bug would do it for him, but the visual of those lips wrapped around a cock had his balls tightening from the wave of arousal. The bug suddenly appeared to be convulsing, its fleshy body rippling and the legs spasming as the clear fluid spilled from its penile appendage into Steve's mouth.
“Yes-yes anything you want.” Tony panted and with a hard thrust he drove his long thick cock into Steve's slick, and tight channel. “Ohh-Ohh Steve, fuck you feel so good.” Tony groaned.
“That's not-”
“I liked it. A lot actually. Well except when...uh...you know I...” He gestured unhelpfully. “Prematurely.” Tony forced out. Steve's eyebrows went up in surprise at that rather intimate admission. A sudden heat spiked inside that he chose to ignore as he cleared his throat.
“It doesn't have to be.” Tony surprised even himself with that reply. “I don't know what this is, what to call it, or if we should put a label on it at all.” Tony took a stalling breath before continuing. “But, it doesn't have to be just for tonight.”
Steve felt himself grow hot inside and out, settling in his groin, his blood rushing down south so suddenly he nearly felt faint. It was happening all so fast he didn't understand it at first. His cock grew hard in seconds, and pressed uncomfortably against the fabric of his uniform.
“It is.” Tony replied softly. Steve trailed his fingers down Tony's thigh and lightly grazed the tips over the smooth velvety skin of Tony's sac noting how Tony kept himself shaved and trimmed. He wasn't completely bare, which Steve liked. He wanted to think of Tony as a man, and men had hair, but he enjoyed the smoothness of Tony's balls as he lightly cupped them in his hand. Tony's breath hitched and he would gasp quietly as Steve explored him. Steve ran his fingers up from Tony's balls and along his shaft from the base to the tip making Tony shiver. He gave Tony's cock a light stroke with his hand and watched the brunette moan and buck his hips, more fluid collected at the tip and dribbled down.
“Tell me, when a colony of parasites invades do you let the parasites decide fate for themselves?” Thanos asked and tightened his grip on Tony's arm. “Or...do you exterminate them before they overrun you?” He twisted Tony's arm back at an unnatural angle, it was quick, the bone snapping rang in Tony's ears as the pain seared up his arm. Tony screamed from the agony, not even the adrenaline pumping though his system was enough to dull the pain. “You are nothing but parasites, consuming everything in your path. I'll save you from yourselves.” He released Tony's arm and Tony dropped fully into the dirt cradling his injury close to his chest. His nerves were shot, he could barely make any movement at all in his fingers, they felt numb compared to the throbbing pain of the splintered bone. “Why fight, why die for those who would never do the same for you? Give up.” Thanos had turned away from him, apparently believing that was enough to finish Iron Man off.
However, Steve ended up being the only one that was given the miracle substance, the alchemist was killed by a spy of Schmidt's shortly after Steve had received it. Armored up with a shield emblazoned with a white star the symbol of his home country and kingdom, Steve fought against Schmidt's forces, destroying his otherworldly unnatural technology with the help of a team known as the Howling Commandos. They were commemorated for their efforts and Steve and Bucky saw their dreams coming true, they had come so far from the pair of scrappy slum kids.
Steve looked down at himself at Tony almost disbelieving that this was happening that he had his cock buried in a man's ass, that Tony a concubine was letting him do this. Tony was gorgeous perched on his lap as he was, his body sculpted perfection in Steve's eyes. “I-I...don't...” Steve stammered. “What...do I do?”
“Well you're not wrong there.” He admitted.
“I...I can't...”
“What? Huh? Oh come on we're exhausted!” The centipede re-positioned its body, it began to coil around Tony and grip him with its many fleshy legs. Steve sat up bit on his elbows confused as to why the centipede was behaving so strangely all of a sudden. The centipede opened its pincers and prepared to release a fresh cloud of pollen.
“I want you to have me.” Steve continued as he opened the vial. “I want all of that again.” He held the vial up and inhaled deeply he closed his eyes and waited as the centipede's pollen worked its way through his system. Almost immediately Steve felt the heat of arousal ignite in his core and spread out through his body to his limbs.
“I can fix that for you.” Tony stated.
“No, you stop with that.” Steve ordered with his best commanding voice. “You deserve it Tony, you deserve peace you deserve all the happiness in the world.” Steve kissed him then. “You earned it, and you have me here to be damn sure that you get it.”
“I uh...” Steve didn't know what to say. He had let some pretty raunchy ideas slip out and now he regretted it deeply. Probably freaked Tony out. “We don't have to...what ever you are comfortable with Tony.”
“No I mean it. This whole evening you have been nothing but perfect, exactly what I wanted in a model. You don't complain and you are...you're beautiful and I want to draw you. I could get you out of this life Tony I don't want strangers to have their way with you. Not like...not what we just did...I want that for myself. Only if you'd let me that is.” Steve said hopefully. He knew what he was proposing was a little crazy, and there would be a lot of negative talk about him for taking in a concubine.
“Please...” Steve begged, his voice cracking and his thighs trembling. The centipede clicked its pincers together as if it were pleased, and its coiled body flexed around him. The tip pressed into Steve's hole and slid deep into his channel, the glide was smooth and easy it had Steve's head lolling back while he moaned with pleasure. It enclosed its legs around his stiff cock once more, encased in the warm rippling heat while it shifted and pulled its length out and shoved it back into Steve. The fluid the centipede was secreting trickled down and out of Steve's ass, it was so wet and messy. He felt defiled and used, but in such a good way.
“That is not what this is about!” Steve bit back in anger. “I'm well aware of the benefits of talking to mental health professionals, and I am not a homophobic bigot!”
Tony stood and gazed out the window at the city below him. It was late the sun had gone down hours ago and a soft patter of rain sprinkled across the valley. There were a few flashes of lightning in the distance. From here was easy to pretend that everything was normal. The world was still moving, people living, and the mass amount of death had never occurred. It was a pleasant fantasy, but always short lived. Tony heard movement behind him and he turned expecting it to be Rhodey or Shuri, perhaps Bruce or Thor...he hadn't expected Steve Rogers, Tony's guard went up immediately.
Bucky was gone, so was Sam, and there was nothing that Steve could do to bring them back. Half of the world's population had dissipated into dust, and there was no telling the chaos that would ensue now because of it. Who was left? Did it matter? Steve grit his teeth and hit his fist into the hard ground. He should have been there with Tony. For two damn years he waited for the phone call and when it finally had come it hadn't been Tony. Maybe, just maybe it all would have been different or at least Tony wouldn't be knocked out in a teenager's lab with a robotic replacement arm.
Tony dropped his arms from the armor and he spun around facing Steve finally. Tony's eyes were searching Steve's in concern and mild confusion. “Used me? Take advantage? You think that's what happened?”
“Hey...feel me here okay? Feel this...” Steve said pressing his chest closer against him, his arm tightening around him. “This is real, this is our life, we bought a farm on the edge of nowhere. We left our responsibilities behind and came here so we could be together and move on from the horrors we both faced.” Tony closed his eyes tightly and just nodded, hoping, wanting, believing that this could be real.
“You don't have to put on the brave face in front of me Rogers. You can talk to Bruce or Natasha, Thor, Clint, anyone. Even me if you needed it.” Tony paused for a moment before continuing as if weighing his words before he spoke. “I get it, I'm possibly the worst person to be giving advice as far as seeking professional help. I've experienced my fair share of unhealthy coping mechanisms, but I recognize that wasn't the best for me and I wouldn't encourage it in others.”
The first time Tony saw Steve in the stealth suit he had a momentary existential crises. The lines of the suit, the way it hugged and framed every portion of Steve's sculpted body. The emphasis of his shoulders that tapered into his narrow waist, and defined the shape of his supple perfect ass. It was devoid of the (in Tony's opinion) obnoxious red and white stripes, instead it was all a single dark navy blue, and the star emblazoned across his chest silver with three horizontal lines across the chest. The stitching along the heavy fabric, obviously tactical in function for the body armor but aesthetically pleasing to look at. Paired with the uniform was a handsomely fitted leather belt, a crisscrossing harness to hold the Shield, and a pair of matching finger-less gloves.
“You like that idea don't you Tony?” Tony could only give a soft mewl in answer. “Say it, come on. I like it when you say dirty things. Tell me you want that.”
“...I don't know what I would have done had I lost you too.” Steve held firm, his thumb slid over the smooth surface of the prosthetic, like a gentle caress and the touch receptors fed the signals to Tony. A tender warmth ignited in his core, he couldn't remember the last time anyone had touched him like that.
Steve interrupted again. “I said take me down Jarvis.” He repeated sternly.
“Fuck-me...” Tony muttered as he watched the creature rim Steve's come dripping ass. Steve was holding his thighs open and rocking his hips, rubbing his rear against the wet mouth. His blonde hair was mussed, there was still fluid from the centipede's dick smeared at the corner of his mouth, his own come was drying on his chest and abdomen. Steve's cock was still hard and wet from the centipede's maw, fresh come still dripping from the tip, was there no satiating the captain's insane sexual appetite? It appeared that Tony was going to follow along that path as well, he looked down as his own cock valiantly filled once more and grew stiff within seconds. He wondered if he could market this thing's pollen as a male performance drug. Beat this Viagra!
“Tony? Tony wait!” Steve called to him, but Tony was already hitting the button for the doors to close. Steve jogged up to the elevator, but he was too late. He pressed his palms against the door and rested his forehead against the metal surface. This was what Steve had been afraid of...he had come to this terrifying conclusion on his run. The possibility for Tony's behavior for avoiding him that morning.
Tony was thrusting his own hips up, meeting Steve's movements and driving his length deep into Steve's channel. The head of his cock struck Steve's prostate repeatedly, sensitive as it was had Steve wailing in ecstasy. Steve could feel the tension in his groin, like a hot coil winding tighter and tighter ready to burst. The heat in his core was rising as he grew closer to the edge of orgasm, and Steve could feel the twitching need for release along the length of his cock to his throbbing balls.
“Hmm very nice. I knew you'd be pretty.”
They settled into silence with the post orgasm highs wearing off and the reality settling in once again. They were still in Wakanda, their friends were still dead, and half the world had perished from the snap of the mad titan's fingers.
“Nonsense.” Tony waved a hand dismissively. “I actively have multiple projects at once, what is one more plus who know how long it will take Shield to issue you a new one and obviously I can make it better.”
“I want it Tony, oh, I want it so bad!” Steve moaned, unable to contain the vocalization of his pleasure. A sheen of perspiration coated Steve's fair skin as he grew closer and closer to his climax.
Steve rolled his eyes and shook his head. “You know this was supposed to be a shared labor thing...you wanna go feed the girls while I get some hay for the kids?”
Steve crawled up and over Tony, wiping away the excess fluids from his mouth before leaning down to kiss him. Tony returned the kiss lazily and slowly, he felt like he was flying high on endorphins just in a blissful wonderful state of post orgasm hormones. It took him a moment to register when Steve had pulled back and had left the bed.
“Ah yeah-more-more!” Steve begged, thrusting, humping the air, rutting himself against the creature. One of the legs skirted across his cheek and prodded at his hole making Steve gasped in surprise, an all new wave of heat overcame him. His cock throbbed and with an excited twitch he came a second time.
“Come on Soldier...don't keep me waiting.” Tony said with a low growl. Steve captured Tony's lips in a heated kiss while he flicked open the bottle and poured a generous amount onto his fingers. “You know what you're doing?” Steve adjusted his weight so he wouldn't crush Tony and settled between the man's legs.
They made their way up to the penthouse, Steve carrying Tony in his strong arms his hands cupping the man's well shaped ass. Once in Tony's...no...their bedroom. It was a mad dash to remove each other's clothing. Button's flew in the air, a T-shirt was tossed to the floor, belts were removed and pants pooled at their feet. Steve's hands felt over Tony's sides and he captured Tony's lips again in a heated searing kiss. Tony felt Steve walking him backwards and he dropped down onto the bed, Tony gave his alpha a smirk as he brought his knees up, spreading his legs for Steve to get a view. Tony's cock was hard and flushed arching up from the trimmed dark hair of his groin. There was already a steady stream of precome leaking onto his abdomen, his balls pulled up tight, and his thighs glistened with fresh slick. Steve felt a wave of possessive need and want rush through him as he gazed over Tony, his omega.
Tony began to move his hips, rocking back and forth at first just getting used to the push and pull of Steve's length inside him. He got more bold, more heated as the drag of Steve's cock rubbed gloriously against his prostate. Tony worked his hips and rose up down on Steve's length, bouncing, moving with a solid rhythm. Tony glanced back at the mirror, he watched as Steve's thick cock disappeared into his body and pulled out slick and coated in his fluids.
Steve settled back down against the bed and relaxed, letting his legs fall open for Tony. Soon he felt the next wet dip of tongue teasing his rim, circling around it before a careful probe inside. Steve's cheeks were heating up in a flush, he felt wet and used down there. Surely Tony would be tasting...himself...leaking from the abused hole. Steve found he was reacting more and more with each swipe of that wicked tongue over his skin. He shuddered and gasped, his hips jolted and his cock twitched with heated arousal.
“I feel good. Really...really...good.” Steve sighed.
His mind drifted to a hot mouth on his cock, sucking and licking, his hands clutching into short blonde hair. Tony could picture it, Steve' Rogers on his knees in full uniform sucking his cock, hungry for it, running his tongue along the length and taking the head into his mouth. It'd be wet, sloppy and so sexy, Steve's perfect lips around him, pink and a little swollen, shiny with saliva. He'd nuzzle into Tony's groin, kiss at his inner thigh and softly lick and suck on Tony's balls. Then he would swallow Tony's length down again, all the way to the root he'd take him into that wet cavern to suck and bob his head. Tony would spill his load into that mouth and Steve would hum with pleasure, his throat contracting as he swallowed. Steve would pull back and look up at Tony his pupils dialated with arousal and drop a hand to cup himself through the uniform a dribble of Tony's come leaking down the corner of his mouth.
“Steve-alpha please! Can I come?” Tony begged. Steve pulled off of Tony's dick and his blue defiant eyes met Tony's desperate chocolatey browns.
Steve turned his head and just gazed at Tony in the dark, how tired he looked how utterly defeated he appeared in that moment. Steve felt it too. Perhaps they could find some solace together despite the tremendous loss that weighed heavily upon them. He reached over wrapping an arm around Tony and held him close. They had survived, they were here together and somehow they would find a way to continue forward.
Steve had hardly any experience with this, he really had no clue what he was doing or why he wanted to do it. Something about Tony ignited a fiery passion inside of him and made him want to do and try things. Things Steve had only heard from fellow soldiers during the quiet lonely nights on the front lines. Of course those talks had been about women, but a lot of the same principles still applied and from Tony's reactions had the same effect.
“Fuck Tony!” Steve said after some time to gain his bearings. “You say the dirtiest things.” Steve lifted his head and pressed several kisses to Tony's neck and shoulder. Tony turned his head so they could kiss, sloppy and heated.
Steve suckled on Tony's nipple and slid his hand up along the man's naked side, feeling over the curve of his hip, up over a flat tight stomach, rubbed his palm over Tony's chest and toyed with the other nipple with his fingers. He was rewarded with a sharp inhale that shifted to a moan from Tony. He brushed his thumb over the areola, gave a soft squeezing tug on the hardened nub. Tony was gasping, moaning as Steve suckled and teased his nipples The noises coming from Tony's mouth made Steve ache to hear more.
Steve walked Tony back towards the bed, his hand on Tony's waist, his thumb gently grazed over the scar in Tony's side, it was nearly healed thanks to the advanced medicines of Wakanda. Tony hissed softly and covered Steve's hand with his own. Steve's eyes met Tony's briefly the despair and sadness still present, they nearly lost Tony too. Steve coaxed Tony down to the bed and kissed him again but slowly, taking his time to explore Tony's mouth. It was nothing like he had imagined, it was so much better than in his fantasies.
Steve blew out a long breath and gave a short, but firm nod. Tony was right, had he known earlier than Steve could have had a solution already. “and how do I handle this until then?”
Steve didn't need any further encouragement, he pulled his fingers out and sat up on his knees holding the bottle in his hands. He poured a generous amount onto his palm and rubbed it over his cock, coating it thoroughly. It felt so good to finally touch himself, Steve bit back a soft moan. He tossed the bottle aside and then grabbed a hold of Tony, hoisting him over onto his stomach and grabbed a hold of his hips.
Tony had wanted to see Steve's face during this, but he would be lying if he said he wasn't a little scared. He decided to listen to Steve's advice and he rolled over onto his stomach and looked back at Steve. “Like this?” Steve was sitting up on his knees and looking over Tony...it was so sinful what this young man was doing, what Steve was about to do, but he couldn't tear his eyes away. Tony on his hands and knees with his lubed ass presented for him, Steve could see a trail of the wet slick he had used trailing down from Tony's open hole and down his thigh. What Steve would have given to pump that man full of his seed, and see the fluid leak from his abused hole. He had to get a handle on himself this was getting a little out of control, but Steve hadn't had a sexual partner in years and now with Tony in front of him so needy and willing it was hard to push aside those dark and dirty thoughts that Steve tried to suppress.
“Going for this whole Grizzly Adams look?” Tony gestured at his face, indicating the beard. “Not bad actually.” He picked up a tablet from the desk and tried to make himself look busy in hopes that Steve would just go away. The Captain remained by the door just giving Tony his sympathetic kicked puppy look, and Tony just found it aggravating. “Was there something you needed?”
“Oh? Oh you like dirty talk baby? Had I known that I wouldn't have held back. My horny soldier, so desperate for a thick hard cock in his ass?” Tony panted, it was a little difficult to concentrate on words while Steve was bouncing on his dick. He was going to do his best, if anything talking could help him stave off his own fast approaching orgasm.
“She's a friendly?” Steve walked up to them and looked down at the raccoon. Rocket grimaced slightly and gestured with his paws unhelpfully.
“All you had to do was ask.” Tony soothed as he watched Steve from his perch by the bar.
like spindly fleshy fingers, its wet protrusion that had been nudging and probing Tony's ass was forced roughly into his body, Tony's hips stuttered, and he thrust particularly hard and deep into Steve, gasping from the sudden invasion.
“All I ever want is you Tony.” Steve confessed. He reached down and coaxed Tony up, holding him around the middle to help Tony sit upright onto his knees. Steve held him, his chest against Tony's warm back, his arms bracing him Tony lifted his arms up and arching his back slightly and turned his head so their lips could meet. Tony grasped at the hair on the back of Steve's head as they kissed, long and passionate. Steve's knot still settled deep and tight in his lover's body.
“Fucking hell Steve!” Tony ground out as the last shreds of his self control receded. Steve's words had implanted themselves as lewd images in his mind, and Tony couldn't shake them once they had taken hold. -Yes- He wanted that, all of that. He wanted to get Steve down onto his hands and knees then pound his cock into that supple ass until Steve screamed in ecstasy. Good lord what was he thinking? What was happening to him?
“...and...” Steve's voice wavered and the wetness prickled at his eyes. “And our friends...would still be alive...”
“Tony!” His hips jolted up suddenly when Tony moved his hand from his cock and cradled his balls.
“I can't reach an orgasm!” Steve clarified with a huff of irritation. What did he have to do spell it out? “Ejaculate, jizz, whatever you wanna call it I can't get there! That's my problem because I can't stop thinking about what happened, and not in the I am so horrified way, no in the...the...depraved and wrong way.” Steve heaved, spilling everything. This was it. He was done. “I'm sick, there is something horribly wrong with me and I cannot fix it. I would think about it and become aroused and I thought maybe it was a side affect. If I got it out of my system I would be okay, but I can't get it out of my system. This is like the worst case of fucking blue-balls and I don't know what to do!”
Steve headed down into the workshop and punched in his code. He found Tony crouched down under the torso of an Iron Man suit and working on some wiring, Steve couldn't help but take a moment to admire. The tension in Tony's arms as he worked, his eyes focused, brow furrowed in concentration, the way his skin had a shine from sweat and the spots of grease on his arms and shoulders. Tony was truly beautiful when in his element and it took Steve a moment to remember the reason he had come down to the workshop. He shook his head and tried to force those intruding thoughts away, he was better than that.
Tony had to turn back and braced his hands on Steve's chest as he took the last few inches of Steve's alpha cock. It burned and it stretched him so far. Tony couldn't believe how easily they had done this during his heat. Tony was settled, resting on Steve's thighs and his ass feeling impossibly full. Steve let out a shaky breath as he held still so Tony could acclimate to his size. It was all so good, better than good. Tony gave a little rock of his hips and Steve shuddered beneath him.
Steve returned to the tower and took a nice long shower to wash away the sweat and grime from his early morning run. He let the water run down over his skin, and closed his eyes while using his arm to lean against the shower wall. Almost absentmindedly his right hand trailed down over his chest and down his abdomen and cupped his half-hard erection in his palm. Steve let out a heavy sigh, it had been a little while since he had relieved himself sexually. Given what he had been through with the centipede Steve would have guessed he would have gotten his fill, but that wasn't the case. Still, weeks after he had a lingering need, an itch he had been desperate to scratch but couldn't while under the heavy surveillance of quarantine.
Steve felt Tony's full weight settle on him, resting on his lap his own cock still erect and straining, he bit his lip and tried to remain as still as possible so as not to cause any discomfort. His cock though it was throbbing, aching, he was buried in Tony's body and it was so wet, warm, and tight all around him. Tony took a moment to allow himself to acclimate to Steve's size, he wasn't by any means a small man.
Tony was seldom speechless, but everything coming out of Steve, spilling his innermost thoughts and feelings had Tony at a complete loss for words. Maybe he didn't have to say anything and just let actions speak for themselves. Tony pulled Steve in and crushed his mouth against Steve's again, kissing with renewed enthusiasm and need. He was rewarded with a moan from Steve, and the sound ignited a fire in Tony. They crowded up against the window, Tony's back pressed against the hard glass as the solid body of Steve Rogers pressed into him. Tony clutched onto to Steve's uniform as if he were afraid to let go, and that doing so would result in Steve disappearing into dust like all the others.
"I know.” Steve said leaning in close to Tony's ear to kiss, and nip at his lobe. He sucked it between his teeth, and bit gently making Tony gasp, and writhe under him. Steve sped up his hand, adding a twist of his wrist on each upward stroke over the head making Tony shudder.
“Harder!” Tony begged. “Please Steve harder.” Tony was spent already from Steve's thoroughly satisfying blow job, but even though he wouldn't be cumming for a second time that night the experience of being railed was still immensely gratifying. Steve was more than happy to oblige Tony's request. His thrusts grew more shallow and rough, fucking Tony thoroughly. The force of his movement had Tony rocking with his motion and the bed frame creaked noisily beneath them. “Ah-Ah-AH!” Tony choked off moans with each of Steve's thrusts.
Steve had grown more curious about that circular light in his teammate's chest after that battle. All he knew was that somehow it kept Tony Stark alive and it had been implanted during his capture in Afghanistan. Other than those facts there was really no information as Tony had been incredibly secretive about the device. There had been some reports from Natasha during the palladium poisoning, but to Steve's disappointment many of the facts had been redacted from records. Judging from the lack of information Steve had deducted that Tony did not like to talk about it so Steve let his questions fester unanswered out of respect for the man's privacy. He figured that Tony had to be proud of his accomplishments though, the little circular light provided enough power to run the Iron Man suits. Any of the government agencies that had attempted to replicate the technology had run into several issues regarding powering the suits. Steve had written it off as Tony being cautious of his creations falling into the wrong hands. Steve had no clue how wrong he had been.
“Why would anyone want this thing to exist?” Steve muttered.
“Mmm.” Steve hummed and pulled back with a wet pop. His fingers still teasing over Tony's leaking ass. “You get so wet for me Tony. I love you like this...so natural.” Steve praised between fervent kisses to Tony's member. It hadn't always been like this, it hadn't always been easy. It had been a long and bumpy road to get Tony to this level of comfort and acceptance of himself. Not now though, now Tony was wet and open and he wasn't resisting.
The centipede uncoiled itself from Steve's body seemingly pleased with the turn of events. Steve stood there panting heavily, his head swimming from the pollen. The Centipede wriggled between Steve's legs and reared up head first behind Steve's back, its maw opening and it spewed out four web like strands, one around each wrist and Steve's thighs. It pulled back and the webbing tightened and held Steve in place as he tried to pull against it, his arms ended up above his head and no matter how hard he pulled he couldn't free himself. Steve was trapped, exposed and horribly vulnerable.
Steve stared at the vial of pollen. Tony's solution was to use the very substance that had caused this whole mess for them. Any sane person wouldn't consider putting themselves through such an ordeal again, but Steve trusted Tony and this plan of his. Only now, what was Tony expecting him to do with the pollen? Was Tony going to hand off that vial to him, wish him well and leave Steve to take care of the problem alone? He felt a sudden wave of disappointment he had hoped...before Tony had implied that he wanted to help him in a more intimate way. He must have been having second thoughts on the matter, maybe sleep deprivation had clouded his initial judgment.
the filthy noises echoed throughout the lab as Steve bucked his hips, rubbing his cock into the tight heat of the centipede's enclosed spindly legs, stroking along the soft belly so wonderfully. Its own stiff length driving into his hole, Steve clenching around it greedily wanting more.
Steve drew what he though or at least what he could see of the arc reactor. He didn't quite understand his fascination with he device just that he wished he could get a better view of it. He kept his drawings classy and tame when in Tony's workshop, but when Steve was alone in his room he found himself fantasizing about more than just the blue light in his teammate's chest. Steve would focus on Tony's chest...what he imagined it looked like. The black tank tops Tony wore provided a good view for Steve to draw his shoulders and arms which were well defined in shape and muscle as it had to be hard work piloting the Iron Man suit, but Steve found himself wondering further. How defined were Tony's abs? He had a slender waist and a shapely behind (not that Steve had noticed...nope.) Steve imagined Tony's hip bones and that V shape that angled and drew the eyes right down towards a man's groin.
Steve didn't hesitate, his cock was hard again already he was hungry for more and eager to come again with Tony buried deep inside of him. Steve picked up the lube from the side table and poured out a generous amount onto his fingers, he was already wet and lose from Tony's fingering so he used the lube to coat Tony's length. He slathered Tony's erection in slick from base to tip, and was careful not to grip too tightly. He didn't want Tony coming just yet.
Tony felt his body tensing, he was getting close. "I will baby, I will, I'm so close." Tony kissed him. "yes right there!" Tony moaned while he reached down, and began to furiously stroke himself. Steve changed the angle of his thrusts so he hit Tony's prostate repeatedly.
“Just keep vital areas protected. We cannot let him get that stone!” Tony ordered his A.I. companion. With a groan Tony stood up just in time to attempt a block from Thanos' fist by crossing his forearms. The infinity gauntlet already with four of the stones embedded into it, pushed down upon Tony's arms to break his block. With a shout Tony pushed against Thanos, his left arm was screaming in pain from the healed fractures he had sustained only a year ago. The HUD of the Iron Man suit was scrolling through a number of errors and his video feed even cut out sporadically.
caused this.”
“I know,” Steve said.
“Ah, right. You’re the kid who always sits in front of all of the classes.”
“She may be the person he’s meant to be with, but you don’t know that. Now that you two are friends again, maybe he’ll realize that he wasn’t actually supposed to be with her.”
“I know I’m lovely to look at, dear, but if you keep on staring you may create a scene,” Tony said, walking over to him. "Not that I'm opposed to creating a scene, but word has it that it is your night."
Steve was just about to take out his notepad and pen when the opposing lawyer walked into the courtroom. He froze, his gaze resting on the man. The man strut into the room like he owned the place and nodded to the judge as if he had known him his entire life. Steve swallowed thickly. There was only one person he had known to act that way. One man who dressed in suits that put all other suits to shame. Tony Stark. The Tony Stark was the lawyer he’d be going up against. The one lawyer that he always joked that he wanted to go up against, but truthfully never did. The one person that he wanted to see again but kept telling himself that he didn’t. He forced himself to breathe. Oh, this was going to be interesting.
“What do you mean?”
Here's the next chapter! Hope that you like it.
Steve stared at him for a few moments, searching his face. When he saw no trace of amusement in Tony's face, his shoulders slumped and he let out a sigh.
Steve was actually a bit disappointed when the study sessions ended. He was glad that he didn’t have to study anymore, but he knew that he would miss studying with them. Sure, there was always next year, but Steve wasn’t sure that they would still want to hang out with him then. And, apparently, second year was supposed to be more hectic than the first year. So, even if they wanted to hang out with him, they might not have time to. And, not everyone was required to take the same classes, so there was a possibility that they might not even be in his classes.
I hope that you enjoy this chapter!
“Look who’s up,” she said, smiling broadly at him.
The odds had seemed so stacked up against them…but somehow they managed to win. Perhaps it was because they were together that helped them win.
“It was nothing, Tony. I was happy to do it.”
“Well. I’m glad that you didn’t.”
(See the end of the chapter for
[I’m having a study group later today. You’re invited. –Stark.]
The man’s gaze narrowed a little bit; it searched Steve’s face, as if he was trying to place him.
“Oh, Steve, it’s great to see you,” Pepper said, leaning in to give Steve a hug.
“Me too, Steve.”
He opened the door to his apartment and closed it behind him. A few seconds later, his phone chimed again.
Tony sat back in his chair, a confused expression on his face, as if trying to figure out how Steve having feelings for someone impacted him in any way. For a moment, Steve thought that maybe Tony wouldn't figure it out. That maybe, just maybe, Tony would ask him who he'd have feelings for. Of course, that hope was silly to have. Tony shook his head.
“It’s…” Tony paused, as if considering his next words. Steve braced himself; he hated it. He knew that he hated it. He was just trying to find the right words to let Steve down. “…great, Steve. Exactly what I wanted.”
Steve paused by the doors of the school, waiting for Tony to text him back. When a minute passed and there was no reply, Steve slipped his phone into his pocket and went into the building.
Feel free to leave a comment or kudos. ^_^
Tony smirked at Steve. “See you in class.”
“Yes…how do you feel now?” Steve asked. His palms began to sweat. His heart beat echoed in his ears.
Tony waved a hand. “I don’t mind.” He winked at Steve before opening the door and stepping out of the car. Steve got out behind Tony and quickly fell into step with Tony. He was
Thank you so much for your continued support!
“You think so?”
He turned on his heel and left the room, forcing himself not to turn back around to look at Tony. Although things were better between them, he wasn’t sure when he’d get to see him next. He couldn’t believe how far they had come though. They went from not speaking to each other to being friends again. As he walked down the hall, his thoughts roamed back to that one night when neither of them could sleep, so they ended up staying up almost all night together.
“I thought that it was the only way that we could win.”
Tony waved a hand. “You know that I’m a light sleeper.”
Steve smirked; he knew that he shouldn’t be enjoying this, but he did. He liked the idea of Tony not having any idea of where they were going for once.  It made up for all the times that Tony randomly surprised him. Luckily those were all good surprises, but still. He liked returning the favor.
The next day, Steve found himself at the site with arms crossed over his chest, waiting for the groundbreaking ceremony to begin. He stood in a half circle behind where the groundbreaking would actually happen. He stood next to Happy, who was busy texting. Bucky stood on the other side of him, hands in his pockets. Natasha was next to him, whispering something to him. He chuckled softly and whispered something back to her. Around them were people who helped clear the site, along with some others: Fury, Sam, Rhodey, Scott, Hope, Peter Parker. Happy took a step forward and cleared his throat.
Steve bit the inside of his cheek. He glanced down at his keyboard. “I…was thinking about something.”
Steve let out a soft sigh and shook his head. He was being illogical. Sure, Tony could decide that he didn’t like him if he went, but if he didn’t go, Tony could also think that he wasn’t interested. So, he may as well go. And…if it turned out to be exactly what Steve feared it’d be like, then so be it.
Tugging his messenger bag over his shoulder, Steve left his room and headed to Tony’s place.
“Remember – stay still. I’ll let you know when you can move.”
Tony’s eyebrows furrowed. “Why not?”
“The answer is obvious,” Nat said.
“Glad to hear it.” He smirked at Steve, but it didn’t reach his eyes.
“Of course I haven’t forgotten,” Steve said softly.
Thank you for your continued support! Here's the next chapter.
He opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came out. All of the words that he wanted to say raced around in his mind, begging to be the first ones out: I’m sorry, Tony. I never wanted to hurt you, Tony. You’re so important to me…you’re my best friend. Which phrase to say first though, he had no idea. He took a sip of his water and placed it on the table. He kept his gaze on the table.
Thank you so much for reading. ^_^
“I am Iron Man.”
“You know it?”
Steve smiled softly at the memory. After that night, things had seemed to finally heal between them. Things obviously didn’t get better right away, but they started to talk more and hang out more. Steve would go to Tony’s lab to see what he was up to, they’d watch movies together in the family room, and sometimes they’d even cooked together. They didn’t cook together often, but when they weren’t both busy before dinner time and the other Avengers were starving, they’d make their way to the kitchen to make food for everyone. Most of those things weren’t very exciting, but after not seeing each other in so long, the daily tasks were welcomed.
They ended up agreeing to meet at Steve’s apartment again. It seemed like the option that would provide them with the most privacy. Although the Avengers were on a “break”, paparazzi and journalists still liked to follow them around at times to get the “dirt” on what was happening. No matter what was agreed upon during their meeting, neither of them wanted the paparazzi to know what was happening between them.
About ten minutes later, there was a knock on his door. He put down the towel he was using to clean the kitchen counter and padded over to the door. He opened it;  Tony stood on the other side of the threshold. He was wearing faded jeans and an ACDC t-shirt under a leather jacket. Dark circles rimmed the bottoms of his eyes. His hair stuck up in various directions. Steve frowned at him.
Feel free to leave a comment or kudos if wish. :)
The blonde nodded and led him into the hall. He smiled at Tony softly as he leaned against the wall that was across from the doors.
“So…mind telling me why we’re at an art gallery?” Tony asked, glancing around the room. “Not that I’m against people expressing themselves through lines and color.”
Sighing, Steve slid his way down the mattress again. He shifted this way and that, trying to get comfortable.
big night,” Steve corrected. “The Avengers’ big night.”
Tony grinned at him. “You make a very good point. I
He turned around to see Tony. His eyebrows furrowed.
“It’ll be okay, Steve,” Tony replied, seeing the question on his face.
“It isn’t very long,” the brunette said, gesturing to the list. “But it has some of my favorite books.”
With that, they set to work. Their project that they were working on was about how certain cases related to each other. None of them broke the same law, but they had to figure out how they were related. Apparently, according to the professor, the cases were related by the type of law that they broke. Not very difficult, but these types of projects always made Steve nervous because he could never tell how the professor was going to grade.
He squeezed Steve’s hand, which helped some of the tension in his shoulders melt away. Tony was right – it would be okay. At least, he hoped that it would be.
“Because you know that I spent a lot of time working on this?”
"Is it?"
“Well, yeah, I’ve got to live somewhere.”
Steve nodded. “I’ll keep that in mind. How’s work going?”
Bucky lowered his arm just a bit. Steve’s gaze flicked from the remote back to Bucky. He knew that he could try to get the remote from him, but he probably would lose. He always lost when he tried to wrestle Bucky. Sighing, he nodded.
“Well done.”
A couple of hours passed before they were finally finished with their presentation. And, by the time they were done, it looked, well, great.
blush every time you look at me,” Steve countered.
(See the end of the chapter for
Bucky and Natasha, on the other hand, seemed to have plans: they were going to find an apartment in New York City together. He hadn’t realized that they had gotten close so quickly, but apparently they had been dating prior to the Snap and after it…well, they decided that there was no point in trying to take it slowly. The way they looked at each other…well, Steve knew that they were definitely into each other. Sam stopped by briefly to check in on Steve and see how he was feeling. When Steve asked what his plans were, Sam told him that he was going to move back to Washington D.C..
“Good point. Sorry.”
“You still could’ve said hi to me.”
“I’m glad that you do. After all, I did make it for you.”
“I’m not sure, Tony…my drawings aren’t that good.”
Steve went two like that; he barely talked to anyone and barely answered his texts. The only texts he really answered were Natasha's, but his replies to her were brief. Not because he was upset with her, but because he didn't quite have the energy to discuss everything that was going on currently. His short messages only seemed to worry her though; she sent more messages as the days went on. He didn't know why she was worried - he hadn't told her anything about what happened with Tony. Not that anything had "happened" with Tony; all he did was look at him for a bit longer than he should have. Steve didn't want to tell her what happened, even if she reassured him by saying that he hadn't done anything wrong. He still felt like he betrayed the trust that Tony had placed in him. It felt like he couldn't do anything right by him: he kept the secret from him, broke his friendship with him, and hurt him. And now when he finally got Tony back…he was pining over him when he was married. Steve grimaced; he really was a terrible friend. The one silver lining in this whole situation was that he didn’t receive any texts from Tony; he had told Steve that he would be traveling for business so he wouldn’t be on his phone much. As much as he wanted to talk to him, Steve knew that he needed the space to figure all of this out.
Tony had to swallow hard as he was overwhelmed by his senses and needs. This must be the heat, it probably wasn't fully out of his system yet. Tony had read that situations like this could occur for some omegas and heat-like symptoms could return after the fact. He made a move towards Steve but paused again when he felt it. The wetness...the slick. The reminder that he wasn't a normal man, he was an omega bitch. Now that he was no longer in his lust addled state Tony felt the shame and disgust within himself.
“It made me feel so good Tony.” Steve looked back at him over his shoulder a sultry little smile on his face. “You feel so much better though, you're filling me so good.” Steve finally registered what was happening behind Tony, his arms suspended above his head by the webbing and the way the centipede's body was curving in towards Tony's rear. It flexed and moved and each thrust moved Tony deep into his channel. “Oh? It's-to you too? Does it feel good? You like it Tony?”
“We managed to survive, for some reason we were spared. I don't know what for or if we can ever hope to reverse it. At least...I...” He pressed a gently kiss to Tony's cheek. “At least I had the chance to be honest with you and share this with you. Even if it's just for tonight.”
Steve didn't go as hard as he had before, he built up to an easy rhythm, sliding easily in and out. He kissed Tony repeatedly, breaking away only to catch a few panting breaths and uttering soft “Uh-uh-uhs.” with the rocking motion of his hips. There was something overly intimate about this position, it was more gentle and dare they even admit it...loving...than the rough wild fuck they had just engaged in.
“Oh? Oh baby...” Tony pulled him into a sloppy kiss. “You thought about this? Having me? Fucking me? Please Tell me Steve, tell me how much you wanted me.” Steve buried his face against Tony's shoulder...as if he wasn't wound up enough as it was now Tony was starting up on dirty talk? Steve didn't know how much he could take of that. He needed to come and soon.
Tony hadn't realized he closed his eyes at some point. He opened them hazily and his gaze locked back onto the mirror. It was dirty, filthy even and his cock throbbed with need as he watched Steve defile him so wonderfully. The nagging shame was slowly fading, all he could think was “more, deeper, yes, harder.” Tony's skin was now flushed, and a light sheen of sweat covered his body. He looked dazed, his eyes heavy lidded and mouth slack as his breaths came out in sharp pants. Steve's fingers were sliding into his body so easily, in and out, in and out, Tony was beginning to rock his hips with the motion wanting more friction. His legs were tense, and shaking slightly with each of Steve's plunges. Tony watched, mesmerized by the motions of it all and he realized with alarming clarity he wanted to see Steve's cock do the same. He wanted the stretch and burn of Steve's alpha cock, and to feel the insane stretch of his knot to keep him in place. To have the warmth flood his insides as Steve came in him in hot pulses.
“But...” Steve attempted to protest.
“It looks like an arthropod of some kind possibly Myriapoda.” Bruce observed. The others gave him blank stares. “Look at how the body is segmented and it has a pair of legs per segment, it's probably some species of centipede but...”
“Tony, oh Tony!” Steve started chanting with his thrusts. He reached a brutally fast pace, his hips snapping forward and pulling Tony's hips back to meet him stroke for stroke. Sweat slicked skin slapped together audibly along with the wet plunge of Steve's cock driving into Tony's ass. Sinful, dirty noises accompanied with grunts, heaving panting breaths, and moans.
When Tony assured Steve he was good Steve coated himself with the lube and tossed the bottle aside. He positioned himself nudging the head of his cock between the cleft of Tony's ass, and pressed right against the rim. Steve met Tony's eyes waiting, wondering if Tony was going to back out at the last moment, but Tony gave him a nod.
There was also the idea of Steve taking Tony while he wore the uniform. The blue fabric hugging him and showing off all of his assets, his sculpted perfect body. The leather harness framing his chest and the bite of the leather gloves on Tony's skin. Steve could hold him down so easily, unbutton his fly and pull his cock out. What an image Steve in full uniform with his huge dripping cock jutting out and exposed.
“Wait...I thought...you only came multiple times because of-of my heat...” Tony replied hazily. His eyes looked distant and lust addled.
That was part of what drew Steve to him, but he didn't want to just give up and lose this chance for something greater. He could understand wanting to keep this quiet for now, but he also didn't want to have to lie or feel as if he were some dirty secret. For now he would agree, but he would work with Tony and see if he could convince him to slowly ease off the suppressants.
Steve couldn't believe that Tony really thought all that about himself, he had been convinced he had helped to sway Tony's opinion. It was apparent now that nothing had changed in Tony's perspective. Did that mean Tony regretted what they had shared? Had their words at the end there been nothing but a giant lie? “You're not a freak I told you how special you are, how rare it is for someone like you to even exist. You're more than just your omega nature Tony, and if you gave others the chance they would see that too.”
“Take a cold shower and try to get some rest. Read something boring, try not to think about-” Tony waved his hand around for emphasis. “-you know
“Damn it Steve wake up! This thing its using you, using us.” Steve dropped to his knees and looked up at Tony with dazed blue eyes, his hands stroked up Tony's thigh, and grasped his belt with deft hands. Steve unfastened it and pulled Tony's slacks, and boxer-briefs down. The centipede moved and adjusted its body for Steve to easily pull Tony's pants down to his ankles. Steve leaned in pressing little soft kisses to Tony's thigh, and hip. “Steve...stop please. You don't want to do this.” Tony said in a strained voice.
“And as I said...I want to and I know you do too.” Tony bit his lip a moment and drew his eyes up to meet with Steve's so there would be no mistake in what he was asking for. “Fuck me Captain.”
“...but-”
“Yeah? Don't sell yourself too short there.” Steve said with a kiss to Tony's ear. “I think you're damn fine Tony. You've become such a handsome, beautiful man.” Their hips slotted together and Steve gave a slow roll of his hips, bare skin on skin, their cocks rubbed together. “Oh god!” Steve groaned.
Steve covered his face, there was no way he could ask a concubine to model for him it just felt so indecent. Not that there was anything wrong with their profession, but Steve having such little experience with sex found that even talking to a concubine filled him with anxiety. They were so comfortable in their profession, care free and beautiful he often ducked his head to avoid looking at them when he had passed them in the halls. Steve couldn't help blushing and he could hear their amused giggles, it was is if they could smell his inexperience and awkwardness. It was best to avoid them and keep his little dignity intact.
Tony glanced down at Steve's offered hand and paused. His first instinct was to ignore it, give him a low five like a bro and act as if it were some sort of team camaraderie. Only Tony couldn't because he didn't want that, and he couldn't bear to see the shattered expression that Steve would surely give him. This...unnamed thing...was so much stronger than he had realized.
“Then we try plan B.”
“I'd prefer not...but up to you sweetheart.” Steve couldn't fight the blush that rose to his cheeks when Tony used the endearment.
Tony shook his head. “Trust me?”
“Tony...are you sure you want this? I don't want you to consent to this if you feel pressured at all.” Steve asked in a gentle voice, his blue eyes searching Tony's for any sign of hesitance.
“I love you too Tony.” Steve replied, blue eyes shining bright with adoration.
Either way Tony would have been happy to do both take or receive it would probably be a wild ride with Steve Rogers. What was sexier? Fucking Steve over a table while still in uniform? His pants pulled down and bunched around his legs while Tony pounded into him all while Steve begged for him to go harder and faster. Tony gasped and moaned as he began to stroke his cock again., his hips began to thrust up into his fist as he really got into it and chased his pleasure.
Tony paused mid sentence his back was towards Steve. He turned slowly to look back at the Captain. “What?”
“If I am...why are you standing there asking silly questions instead of giving your omega what he needs?” Steve didn't wait another second, he kicked the door closed with his foot and began to undress. He tore his clothes off quickly, discarding them haphazardly across the floor as he approached the bed. “Alpha...” Tony whined, his eyes closed as he continued to stroke himself. “Been waiting...I need you.” Steve knelt on the bed, his eyes dark with lust. He grabbed Tony's wrist to pull his hand away from his cock, and leaned in for a deep, heated kiss.
They stood in Shuri's lab, a bit worse for ware after the attack but everything appeared to be functional. They had placed Vision's body onto the table and Shuri was scanning for any signs of life remaining. The outcome was looking grim. Steve had to give the girl credit, for just finding out the fate of her brother she was holding it together remarkably well.
“Fuck!” Steve cursed alone in his room while shutting his sketchbook in irritation. This was wrong...it was so wrong, but Steve couldn't ignore the heat of arousal growing inside. This was becoming a problem and he knew it. Steve wasn't new to the concept of homosexuality. He had grown to accept it many years ago when he had been a teen and cuddling up to his best friend during cold winter nights. They had never talked about it, but Steve had spent more than a few shameful nights stroking himself to the thought of Bucky doing things to him that men only discussed as appropriate for dames.
One night they laid together in bed, Tony resting up against Steve's chest, an arm draped across him.
Steve had read the files on Tony Stark, he was more than aware of the technological marvel that was the Iron Man suit, but the most puzzling piece of technology had to be the arc reactor. He hadn't paid it much mind when he saw it for the first time when on the helicarrier. After they had successfully incapacitated Loki and managed to talk Thor out of bludgeoning anyone further with his hammer, as amusing as it had been for Steve to witness Tony throw backwards by the frustrated demi-god. Steve had known about the piece of tech inserted into Tony's chest, it was noted on his file and it was just considered a part of what made Tony Stark into Iron Man.The circular blue glowing disc in the center of his chest shining brightly even through the fabric of his dark t-shirt.
“Fuck.” Steve cursed as he formed a fist and pumped his own throbbing dick with his hand. He could still hear all those dirty things Tony had said to him during their ordeal. Calling him a cock-hungry slut, because well that had been true then hadn't it? Steve had begged for Tony to fuck him, and damn had he fucked him good. Steve bit his lip as a soft keening whine found its way out. He was so close to coming, he could feel that he was right on the edge...so...close...so...Steve panted as he continued to work his hand over his stiff member. Any moment now he would reach that blissful edge and he could feel the joy of release as his orgasm rocked through him. Steve could feel it in his core, a tightly wound coil, his cock was aching with need, his balls tight and drawn up close to his body.
Tony reached for the bedside nightstand and opened the drawer to rummage around inside it, he smirked as he held up his prize, a bottle of lubricant. With a generous amount deposited onto his fingers Tony reached down and slid his fingers over Steve's waiting hole, who rocked his hips and whimpered with need.
“It's not everyday we are given such a request. We are often referred to as exotic beauties, our lords shower us with compliments and gifts, but to be captured as a work of art. Now that is something and perhaps the most flattering of requests. I do hope I meet your desires for a model.”
Tony summoned up his energy and went for Thanos, the bleeding edge armor shifted into a heavier weapon and Tony charged it up. He boosted into the air at the last second and hovered in front of Thanos and fired off a shot, but at the same time Thanos summoned another blast of that purple energy. The combined energies forced them both backwards a few feet, but Tony recovered quickly, and he boosted forward again firing off repulser shot, after repulser shot, giving it his all to try and gain the upper hand. Thanos though charged in too and with his heavy fists battered Tony's armor repeatedly. The bleeding edge couldn't repair itself fast enough and he had already lost his connection to FRIDAY.
Tony slipped his hands down further over his flat stomach and let the leather rub over his thighs. He teased himself not going straight for his cock just exploring and touching everywhere around it. Steve would be thorough he liked to have a plan, he never went straight in for the goal. Tony skirted his fingers around his groin and dipped a single digit below his balls and lightly grazed the pad up and over the taught skin. Tony shivered and went more bold, cupping and fondling his balls and the texture of the leather gloves created a brilliant contrast of sensations prickling through his skin.
The concubine stayed silent for a moment, his eyes dark orbs in the lower candlelight bore into Steve making the blonde shift slightly in his seat in discomfort. Steve suspected he was being measured up in a sense, maybe they didn't use names? Or was he supposed to know already? He was about to apologize when the concubine spoke up at last.
Steve's previous misconceptions, his worries, his anxiety over the whole thing simply dissipated as the pollen worked its influence over Steve's sensibilities. He could tell it was milder, he was much more in control of his senses but the usual shame that reared itself in his mind was gone and all he could feel was the intense desire for Tony's body.
“Steve, Steve are you awake? Can you hear me?” There was a voice over the intercom within the room. Steve opened his eyes slowly, his vision a little blurred from the wetness. Over by the door was a window and on the other side was Bruce. Steve stared at him for a moment, blinking away the tears and sniffed giving him a brief nod.
Steve tightened his grip on Tony's wrists and he leaned in closer, crowding Tony against the window pane. Steve's breath was coming out in shaky uneven pants, his blue eyes guilt ridden and sorrowful. “I should have....I-I...” Steve's eyes searched Tony's handsome face, looking for what? Tony had no clue. He felt his own insides twisting in anxiety. “...Tony...” Steve sounded so broken, on the edge of some metaphorical cliff and ready to tumble down into the black abyss.
“I know you can Tony, you are always so good Tony. I can feel how wet you are, I got you close. Hm you are so tight, so wet, god Tony.” Steve praised as he thrust into him. Tony gasped and his body grew tense he felt Steve still, and the warmth of his come flooding him. That sent Tony over and he too felt the explosive orgasm rock through his body. Steve was panting hard as he settled the two of them onto their sides careful to ensure Tony was comfortable as his knot swelled within him. Steve held Tony kissing and whispering sweet loving things into his ear as they came down from the endorphin high.
“Just fuck me already Rogers.” Tony demanded after several minutes.
“Tony...I don't want to hurt you. I can pull out and-” Steve attempted to protest.
Steve jolted when Tony's tongue brushed over his hole. “Tony that's...oh...oh that's so dirty.” Tony lifted his head and looked up at Steve with worry in his eyes.
When he arrived home at the tower he took a quick shower to freshen himself up, changed into some more casual clothes and sat down on the couch in the communal to read. Steve was deeply involved in his reading, so much so he hadn't heard the movement or footsteps across the floor. Normally he was much more observant, but here at home Steve had learned to set aside the alertness for relaxation. When a pair of hands eased over his shoulders Steve did flinch slightly in surprise, but he soon sank into it and leaned back against the couch and looked up at Tony.
Steve wasn't going to last much longer he felt the pressure building, that tension in his core, his balls drawing up tight, he was so close. He pulled Tony down onto himself, he slid in and out so easily he worked up to a faster and faster rhythm. With a few more particularly hard thrusts Steve felt the tension release and his cock pulsed. Steve was groaning as he rocked his hips up, still holding Tony by the waist as each rippling wave of relief rushed through him. Steve just came, and came he had never felt so good.
“I may have experimented a bit...” He admitted with a blush on his face.
“Thanks but I'm on the liquid diet.” Tony replied while raising his coffee mug for emphasis. Steve just playfully rolled his eyes.
Tony reached his hands down and pulled the fabric covering loose, he unwrapped it from himself slowly as if he were unwrapping a gift just for Steve's eyes. Slowly the silk came undone first exposing more of that teasing trail of hair, down, down...
“Gold digging at that age? That's awful...you're more than just money. I hope there were a few good ones?”
“Yes Steve, yes I-I want that too!”
Tony gasped and tilted his head as Steve kissed his neck -holy shit- Steve was getting into it, and -wow- Tony could feel him could feel the hardness of Steve's cock in his pants. Tony bit his lip, rutting himself against Steve for more friction.
Tony shook his head slightly and only continued to gently rub his fingers over Steve's puckered entrance. “We're gonna take this nice and slow. I'd hate to hurt you.” Steve huffed out a quiet whine and threw his arm over his eyes as he tried to still his hips. He wanted penetration, he wanted to be filled. Tony took his time gently stroking his fingers over Steve's skin, and spreading the slick all over. Steve could feel the wetness spreading down his cheeks and crack, it was warm and viscous but thicker than what the centipede had secreted over his body.
“You too Tony.” Steve mumbled while already starting to drift off. It had been weeks since he had felt that relaxed. The tension in his muscles and the frustration had vanished and knowing that Tony was there beside him made it all the more comforting. Steve drifted off into a blissful sleep within minutes.
“Oh Tony...you want me? Tell me...let me hear it. How bad you need your alpha?” Steve ordered him with a growl. Tony groaned and rolled his hips back, rubbing himself against Steve.
"Is that better?" Steve asked as he straddled Tony, Steve was already hard again and rocked his hips, rubbing his own cock against Tony.
“Next time, Next time Tony I promise.” Soon he too tipped over that edge of release. Steve pumped himself a few more times into Tony's body before he stilled and held him flush against his waist as he emptied himself into the rubber around his cock. “Oh...my God Tony...” Steve panted.
“Oooh!” Steve moaned. “This is so dirty.”
The first time Tony masturbated to thoughts of Steve Rogers he felt ashamed and disgusted. Tony had always been open about sex, there wasn't a lot he considered to be inappropriate and jerking off was a private guilt free experience for him. It felt good, he felt relaxed and loose afterwards and often had a clearer head for working. Not this time, and for many reasons.
Steve memorized the numberh He could see it in Tony's posture that he didn't believe that Steve would show up. In reality he really shouldn't it could be dangerous, a trap even to get him into custody, but something was happening here and it had started in the bar. Steve was determined to see this through.
“Of course. They’re mainly about me not being able to save you during one of our missions.”
Tony pursed his lips and stared at his lap. "Not really..but I probably should."
“Yeah?” Tony asked, without looking up.
Tony’s mouth turned downwards. “I’m sorry, Steve. I didn’t mean to be late.”
“Black trousers are my thing, though. You most certainly copied my look.”
“This is for you.” Tony said, handing it to Steve.
It took a second for Steve to react to the hug. Honestly, he hadn’t been expecting it. He felt like he hadn’t done anything compared to Tony. Tony was the one who had risked his life; he had just been the one to try to save him.
“Blush when I look at you.”
“T-Tony, you can’t do this.”
“I’d let you borrow my copy but I’ve scribbled all over it.”
“I know,” Tony replied. He sighed and leaned back in the couch. His shoulders seem to slump forward. “It’s…just easier to be mad at you than myself.” Tony’s gaze flicked to the blonde. “I’m sorry. You didn’t deserve that. I'm not sure what came over me."
Steve stared at a new blank page, pencil in hand. Minutes passed by, but his hand didn’t move. The page remained empty.
Steve nodded and stood up. He threw down some extra bills to pay for Tony’s drink.
“Yes, then you can leave.”
They decided who would pick out their first date by flipping a coin. It landed on heads, which meant that Steve would be able to pick where they went. At first, Steve had a lot of different ideas of a date; they could go out to a movie, go out to dinner, or get coffee together. None of those ideas seemed very exciting, though. In fact, they seemed a bit boring for their first date. Perhaps “boring” wasn’t the right word; they just weren’t unique. He wanted this first date to be one that Tony would remember for the rest of his life.
“Perfect...so nice.” Steve praised as he ran his hands over the firm globes of Tony's backside, massaging and groping the heated flesh. “I can't believe you want me to do this with you Tony...you could have anyone.” Steve whispered as he lined himself up. He had his left hand on Tony's hip and gripped his shaft with his right to guide himself in.
Steve looked up over his tablet and tapped the screen a few times. “It's actually rather remarkable.” Bruce began, he realized how that sounded when Steve raised a skeptical eyebrow. “From a biological view was what I meant.” Bruce continued “That bug possess an incredibly potent pheromone. We don't know why Hydra was researching this creature, or if they were the ones to engineer it. Now in our experience the serum in your body counteracts all toxins at a superhuman level. That's why you don't get sick, you can't be poisoned you don't get drunk. Your ability to metabolize at such a rapid rate renders most, nearly all, outside substances innate. Even to keep you sedated we have to give you what would be considered lethal for normal people. Except for this pheromone.”
Reluctantly Tony released his cock and moved across the bed to rummage through the drawer for the bottle of lube he kept on hand. He re-positioned himself with his back against the mattress legs open, knees bent. With the bottle in hand he poured a generous amount onto the leather and reached down to spread it over his length. Tony sighed while he leaned his head back, and coated his cock giving himself a few extra pulls, it felt good, but he didn't want to be too hasty. Tony returned to slow delicate touches up his length lightly running up the underside with his fingertips teasing himself.
“My alpha, please...I-I'm so...” Tony swallowed and forced the words out. “I'm so...wet...and open for you.”
Steve finally stilled, and he went lax on the bed, his hands loosely held Tony's hips. Steve's knot began to fill, expand and stretch Tony further. Steve only groaned as the pressure around his cock increased further, making his length throb and harden more. Tony was tense, right on the edge but he waited...he waited for his alpha. Steve slowly slid his hands up and down Tony's sides and along his sweaty thighs. Tony gave a small keen of need.
He traced a finger along Tony's crack and down between his cheeks and massaged the wet entrance while he sucked on Tony's shaft. The slick was already leaking down his thighs, coating them, his hole was already relaxed and open for an alpha to take and ravage. Steve moaned pleasantly around Tony's cock as he use his fingers to tease and play, rubbing and circling around Tony's hole, but not quite penetrating yet.
When Tony came, messily between their bodies he went limp against the bed as Steve finished off himself with a few more rough thrusts. They kissed again, quick and sloppy as they caught their breath. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's neck to keep him in place, his brown eyes meeting with Steve's blues. The moonlight was filtering in through the windows casting Steve's sweat slicked skin in a heavenly beautiful glow. Tony's breath caught for a moment, at how this could possibly be his life. The emotion swelled inside of him, the warmth enveloping his very being.
Steve shook his head slightly, his forehead still damp with sweat. “Since when do you monitor my routine?” The answer to that question was obvious, but Steve wanted to hear Tony say it. They had been monitoring him since he had gotten out of quarantine.
“Tony.” Steve whispered and bent down to plant a needy kiss on his lips. Tony's hands moved down to Steve's pants and decided they both were still very much over dressed for this. With skillful hands Tony worked Steve's belt and pants open, then impatiently began to shove them down. Steve sighed in relief when his cock was freed from the tight fabric, and he shifted his weight to kick off his pants and boxers to the edge of the bed. Tony regarded Steve with envy, want and lust in his eyes as his gaze roamed over his body and focused on the man's impressive dick. Tony licked his lips almost obscenely and Steve felt another wave of hot arousal from that, his cock twitched in anticipation, and a bead of precome drizzled from the tip.
"Hm good looking fella like you in a place like this and you weren't expecting someone to try and snatch you up?" Tony smirked he wanted to see if he could rile him up a bit, see how long Steve would go along with this, because now that Tony thought about it, had he seen someone like Steve sitting alone in a bar he would try his luck in taking them home. Obviously that wasn't going to happen, not with where they had left things before, not with how the Avengers had fallen apart, but for now they could pretend that wasn't them. That didn't happen to these two strangers meeting for the first time, so there was no harm in having a little fun now.
Steve tilted his head slightly. Buy him a drink? Was this a game to Tony? He knew he couldn't get drunk. So that wasn't going to give him an upper hand, and it wasn't like drugging him would work either so what was Tony trying to pull? Well he could play this game too. "I don't take drinks from strangers. Going to have to tell me your name first."
"Oh...I promise Steve I'll make it good. So good." Tony resisted the urge to nip Steve's neck, he leaned back pulling his hand away. They were in public, and this was just a game, certainly they would part ways once they left the bar. Maybe have a laugh at the entire thing and go their separate ways once more. Tony stood up, pulling out his wallet and paid their tabs. Steve stood up with Tony left the bartender a tip and they walked out together.
“Did-did I hurt you?”
Steve shook his head and wiped at his moist eyes. “Not entirely on you. I let you do it against my better judgment.” Steve sniffled a bit. “I shouldn't have entered the lab alone. Jarvis even warned me not to, but I charged ahead without backup.”
Tony opened his eyes and gazed at Steve with a small playful smile on his lips. Slowly he traced his fingers up his chest, and circled the pads of his fingers over his nipples, already hard and tight from arousal. Gently Tony took the small golden hoop between his fingers and tugged it slightly resulting in a sharp gasp and trailing off into a moan. Steve had never found himself wanting to hear such a sound again so desperately. He pictured taking that hoop into his mouth, biting it between his teeth, laving his tongue against the cool metal and hard nub of Tony's nipple.
When Steve had first woken up from the ice all he could think was how much he had wanted to return to his own time. Since he had met Tony though and once they had officially bonded and sealed their relationship Steve found that he no longer desired to return to the time he had come from. He had found a love so unique and so important to him that he couldn't imagine any life without Tony there by his side. As a team mate he could depend on, as a friend as his lover. A mate for life.
There was a long pause before Jarvis responded. “...Indeed Captain that is a compelling argument and as I am inclined to ensure Sir's safety and health I cannot deny you entry.” The door clicked open and Steve smiled in satisfaction.
“Please. Tony. Please!” Steve begged. “In, I want you inside.”
...It didn't last...
“Thank you.” Steve murmured, his body felt lax and worn, a little sore in places too. After the intensity of their sexual romp he was feeling tired and in need of a full night's rest to recover.
“If this is what you want...” Steve replied and let his gaze linger over Tony's exposed member. The young man's cock was flushed and hard, his balls already drawn up tight.
“You know...” Tony started after the quiet had gone on long enough. “I'm glad you're still here, and like what you said before...I-I feel the same. I don't know what I would have done had I lost you with everyone else.” he admitted quietly. Tony typically wasn't the type to talk of things such as this, feelings, and fears it was territory he rarely ventured. However, surviving the battle against Thanos, not disappearing to dust with half of the world's population put a lot into perspective. Tony couldn't keep hiding forever.
“Maybe I'll go see my specialist and see what he says?”
Pepper reached over and took Tony's hands in hers to help soothe him. “I think the first thing you need to do is clear the air and talk with Rogers.” Tony made a pained expression. “I know not your strongest attribute but you have to tell him something Tony. It could crush him to find out that you don't want to pursue anything more serious...but I believe you should at least try.”
Tony practically collapsed onto the bed then, breathing heavily and Steve still behind him. Not wanting to crush the much smaller young man Steve caught himself before he too fell onto the bed. He pulled out from Tony with a soft grunt and pulled the condom off himself, tied it and tossed it into the nearby trash bin. Steve then laid back against the bed and let himself drift in the afterglow of the post orgasm haze with Tony beside him. “Come here.” Steve reached a hand out and rubbed his palm over Tony's back. Tony pulled himself up with a slight wince and laid himself nearly on top of Steve's solid body. An arm around his waist and his head resting against Steve's shoulder.
“Yes-Yes I like that.” Steve panted.
Tony's breath was shaky, he took a moment to try and compose himself and his racing heart. He needed Steve to believe that he wanted this, because he did. “Steve...” Tony breathed and touched Steve's face lightly with his hand, resting it on his cheek. “I've wanted this with you for a long time. Please. I want you.” Tony leaned up and kissed him. “Please.” That was all Steve needed, although he still had the hint of doubt the throbbing in his cock was more distracting every second. Steve returned Tony's kiss and hooked his fingers in the waistband of Tony's boxers and tugged them down.
“Close, so close Tony!” Steve was shifting his own hips, rocking back against Tony's own dick as if he couldn't get enough. Tony watched as the Captain's ass enveloped his own cock, the slick wet slide and slapping skin, the perfect globes of Steve's ass cheeks ramming against the top of Tony's thighs. It was pornographic. Tony had never imagined that Steve was capable of acting like this. He flexed his arms and tugged on the bindings of the centipede's webbing. Tony wanted to reach down and spread those cheeks so he could watch his cock sliding in and out of that stretch dripping hole. Tony's hands itched to slap Steve's rear and make him gasp, to make it hurt in that dirty oh-so-good way.
“Don't hold back, I'm here to pleasure you, fuck you until you're boneless. Come Tony, come for me as many times as you can.” Steve ground out.
War is hell though...After Steve lost his friend he put all efforts into the final push against Schmidt and went after the man himself, his fortress high up in the mountains to the North in the biting cold. Steve overcame the crazed conqueror, but sadly was lost for decades in the icey waters after bringing down Schmidt's doomsday flying contraption.
Tony took a moment to breath and calm down before he set to fondling his balls, rolling and gently tugging them in his hand. He shifted slightly on the bed into a more comfortable position and sighed contently as he drew out the experience. Tony wondered if Steve would be a top or a bottom would he be as domineering in the bedroom as he was on the battlefield? Tony shivered pleasantly at the thought, but then again Steve as a power bottom, begging for Tony to fill him and fuck him, that had its appeal too.
“Avenger...” Thanos' voice boomed above him. “this is the fight you cannot win, not against me.” With that Thanos threw a punch with his other fist straight into Tony's chest plate and sent him reeling back once more. The HUD within the suit flickered before his vision, and the intricate knitting of the armor began to dissipated from around Tony's hands. It moved up towards his forearms, revealing the fabric of his shirt underneath.
“No...No Steve you didn't make the wrong call.” He took in a slow heavy breath and let it out slowly before he continued. “ I should have told you why I was avoiding you. I went to the gym intending to talk to you and being there and seeing you in all your alpha super soldier glory. I lost it. I...was experiencing symptoms you know? I had to get myself under control before I could be in the same room as you. I couldn't risk any of the others seeing me get all sex crazy and blow my secret.”
“Fuck, yes, yes oh god fuck!” Steve chanted unable to keep himself quiet, how could he when he had never felt something so incredible before.
For his time in quarantine Steve had managed to hide the awkward boners from Jarvis since his vitals were only monitored at certain times of the day. At first Steve suspected it was only a side affect, that there was still some of the pollen in his system, but with Bruce's careful monitoring it turned out that wasn't the case at all. Steve felt disgusted with himself and chose to keep it to himself. If anyone found out he would be removed from the team for sure. He focused on trying to sleep and ignore the persistent throbbing erection in his pants.
Tony reciprocated the kiss, sucking lightly on Steve's lower lip before he pulled back to look up at him. “So...you're saying you want me to date and try it out with other people, but we can fool around if we want to?” Steve nodded in reply. Tony gave Steve a soft kiss and whispered against his lips. “Deal...”
"God, oh my god Tony...." he panted and rocked his hips with Tony's motions. It felt so good.
“I do...something about seeing you all wet and loose...it-it does things to me...” Steve replied in a deeper tone, almost hoarse from strain. Steve reached down then between Tony's legs and grasped the base of his own cock. Steve sighed a little as he held himself firmly with his fist and gently rubbed the head between the cleft of Tony's cheeks. “I just want you to see yourself how I see you Tony...that you should never be ashamed of what your body does” Tony watched it in the mirror, his head turned, his back starting to hurt a little from twisting so much to see, but he wanted to watch the way Steve shoved his impossibly large cock into his tight ass. Tony felt a clenching of worry and also excitement all in one at seeing the size and wondering how Steve had ever fit that into him before and how it was going to now. It didn't seem possible.
“Ooohh.” Steve let out a long moan as the pulsing waves of pleasure crashed into him. The centipede wriggled out from between Steve's legs and circled around him as he remained on his hands and knees, catching his breath. It seemed to be studying him, watching intently for his next action before it moved in on him again.
“A Farm?”
Steve rose up onto his knees and sank back down, he repeated the motion, rolling his hips with it to create fluid natural motion. Tony's cock slid out of him, the friction sweet on Steve's stretched rim.
Steve was moving off the stool before he even realized what he was doing. He knelt in front of Tony, leaning against the edge of the lounge. Tony raised his hands from his chest to Steve's face, caressing lightly over Steve's cheeks, jaw, over his temples and through his short blonde hair. Steve's hands were shaking lightly and his breath felt ragged and uneven, he had never done anything like this before. Tony reached both hands to the back of Steve's head, gripping tightly in his hair and sat up further as he coaxed Steve to lean down over his chest and....Tony gasped. “Yes!”
“I don't know yet, but I'll make one up, and another and another if I have to.” Tony took a few steps backwards towards the door, abandoning his original plan of going for a run on the treadmill. “Until we find the solution to this problem of yours.”
“Okay...I guess I'll see you later then?” Steve asked but he got no further reply. He had the urge to wrench the door open and ask Tony if everything was okay between them, but he decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he really did have to meet with Pepper, and Steve was just being paranoid. Steve walked over towards the bed and picked up his clothes from the floor and headed into Tony's luxury bathroom.
Steve pulled off from Tony, feeling some of the warmth leaking out from his hole but he didn't care as he rolled onto his back beside Tony and took a much needed breather. The pollen's affects had nearly vanished, but Steve felt languid and satisfied. It was exactly what he needed and he was grateful to Tony for everything.
“Are-Are you okay?” Steve asked suddenly in alarm. He managed to snap out of his sex drunk haze for at least the moment at hearing Tony in pain.
His omega...Steve called him his omega and Tony felt a swell of pride and pleasure all at once. Tony took a breath to calm himself and to find his voice again. His words came out strained and needy, practically a keening whine. “Thinking of your cock.” He forced out. “Thinking about your knot in me. I want to watch it plunge into my wet hole. I want to feel you come in me, I want you to knot me and just use me again and again.” Tony replied nearly breathless. Steve practically growled in response. He pressed his forehead against Tony's shoulder and his arms tightened around Tony's middle.
“There is so much Tony, but right now I want your cock in me. I wanna ride you.” Steve watched as Tony swallowed hard and reveled in the view of Steve's naked form. He stretched suggestively to emphasize his point and reached out to Tony, stroking fingers down his thigh.
Steve just gave small shrug, he held some pencils and a sketchbook in one hand. “No none of that...just...wanted to see how you were doing. You always spend so much time alone.” Steve's blue eyes met Tony's then briefly glanced down towards his chest then back up again. Steve always did that...always examined the arc reactor...Tony kind of hated it.
Steve stared at the arc reactor. Fully exposed for the first time...and he couldn't stop looking at it. So this was the device that kept Tony Stark alive. Tony opened his eyes slowly and gazed at Steve realizing the Captain couldn't tear his eyes away from the horrid thing in his chest. Tony cleared his throat and began to pull the medical monitors from off himself. He needed to cover himself, to hide the ugly monstrosity lodged into his chest. “I know it isn't pretty Cap.” Tony started as he hopped off the chair and made a grab for a shirt. “but it keeps-”
“Ah too-much-too-too much! Fuck!” Steve panted as the last burbles of his come leaked from his dick, the milky white fluid dribbling down and coating the centipede's underbelly. Steve was shaking, long full body tremors, quivering from over stimulation. He gripped tighter at his thighs still holding himself open, the slick shaft still pumping into him and the legs squeezing and tugging at his sore cock. Steve felt as if he needed scream, the creature flexed and coiled its body closer to him as if to soothe, he couldn't take it anymore it needed to stop he couldn't-
“You're beautiful you know that?” Tony stated as he pulled his own shirt up and tossed it to the floor. “Just...damn they weren't kidding when they called you the peak of human perfection.” Tony said while he tugged Steve's shirt up. Steve lifted his arms to make it easier on Tony, and once he was shirtless he settled his hands on Tony's waist and drifted his hand up his bare back. Steve leaned in and trailed his lips over Tony's chest and around the glowing arc reactor.
Steve still carried the heavy sorrow of their lost friends, his eyes never quite losing that sadness that had etched itself into them. Tony too was plagued by the nightmares and memories of his own failure, Peter's dusting still shook him to his core and only Steve had been there to help soothe the panic attacks. There were times where they still fought, shouting matches, Tony shoving Steve in anger, but no matter how badly it had gotten they would still find themselves sharing a bed during the lonely nights.
Steve had always prided himself on his self control and especially his serum's ability to counteract negative affects of toxins, poisons, and other foreign substances. This experience though only left him feeling vulnerable and weak. He could have handled what had occurred had it only been himself and the bug, but since he had forcibly involved Tony...Steve could never forgive himself for that.
“NO!” Steve clamped his hands on either side of his head and hunched over on his bed as he tried to will the images away. He was hard, painfully hard, and leaking from the tip of his cock. This had been going on for weeks now and Steve feared that it wasn't getting any better. If he couldn't get past this then he would surely be removed from the team.
“Exactly, we don't know what it is and it would be a lot safer if we just exterminate it before it hurts anyone. The thing could spew acid for all we know!” Steve argued.
“I'd like to yes, but it's up to you. As I said before, we don't have to.” That pinch of worry in Steve's brow had returned and Tony couldn't have that. He sat up and reached over to Steve to pull him in closer and this time Tony initiated the kiss, a sinful delicious kiss full of tongue and promise.
“Tony? Really?” He asked feeling breathless.
Tony raised himself up on his elbows and looked back at Steve over his shoulder. “I figured after what we had done already that maybe I could give this another try again. Let's face it. Sex is...it's so much better off the suppressants. I wanted to know if I could let myself try it again and, fuck, Steve hearing you seeing the way you look at me. All needy and wanting me...just me...” Tony gave a slow roll of his hips back against Steve and shifting his knot ever so slightly the walls of his body clenching around him. So wet, tight and warm all over. Steve's mouth fell open in a gasp.
“Yes I meant it. I would like to do this again.” Steve sighed as his better senses and logic began to return to him. “But...” Steve added. “I don't know if we really should Tony. You're so young and I really shouldn't-”
“T-Tony-wait-” Steve breathed but Tony was already slotting himself between Steve's legs and his hands settled on Steve's narrow waist.
Tony regarded Steve for several moments as he thought over Steve's additions. “I can agree to those terms, as I have no intention of really involving myself with anyone else. Regardless of my reputation I am actually respectable when it comes to being monogamous, however I am known to be a notorious flirt so you will have to put up with that to a degree.”
Tony set his empty mug aside and stood up with a stretch. “Yeah, I can do that.” He headed over to the barn and grabbed the bag of animal feed. On his way out Tony paused and spotted a lump of black fur snoozing inside, apparently they had adopted a barn cat. The feline lifted it's head and blinked emerald green eyes sleepily and licked at a black paw. “Tell you what kitty cat, you can stay as long as you pull your own weight and do something about the mice around here.” The cat yawned and nuzzled back into a little ball. He'd ask Steve if he knew about their latest visitor.
A massive thunderstorm had struck New York City which made Steve not want to go outside. He didn't mind thunderstorms, but he didn't like walking around the city in them. So, he decided to spend the day reading. Normally he would read in his room - he enjoyed reading where it was quiet, but today he decided to read in the living room. He wanted a change of scenery and he liked watching the rain patter the large windows that lined the living room.
Tony pursed his lips. “I understand.”
The blonde looked at his phone and then glanced around his apartment. It wasn’t messy, but it wasn’t as neat as he would like it.
That comment made Steve blush. “I don’t mean to. Just…you have a nice place. Nicer than mine.”
Hope you like it!
“It-it’s okay, Steve. I’m okay.”
He continued to slowly breathe in the fresh air. Eventually, his heart rate went back to normal and his fingers uncurled from his fists. It was just a speech. He could do this. If he failed, maybe he could get Sam or Nat to help him out. Yeah, that could work.
Tony got up and opened the fridge, taking out a beer. He opened the bottle before passing it to Steve.
Steve wasn’t convinced. He trusted Tony, but he knew that Tony wouldn’t necessarily tell him if he absolutely hated the drawing after he put so much time and energy into it.
“One…two. It’s been two seconds.”
“I figured that we could do work here,” Steve said. “Unless you prefer to do it in my bedroom.” The statement caused Steve’s face to turn warm. He glanced down at his feet, hoping that the other couldn’t see how rosy his cheeks were.
“Beer.”
“You too,” Steve replied.
Thank you for reading this! I hope that you enjoyed it.
Steve shook his head, his gaze not leaving Tony. His eyes raked over Tony; that suit hugged his frame perfectly. He licked his lips and watched the billionaire walk over to the shovel that was leaning against some wooden planks. He picked it up and turned towards the crowd.
“It’s just…hard to believe, that’s all.”
“Yes.”
“Thanks for coming, Tony.”
“It’s not as if you act subtle around him.”
“To spare my feelings?” Steve offered, shrugging.
“Yes, ma’am,” he mumbled.
“You knew how hard trusting is for me…yet you threw that trust right back into my face.”
“Dammit,” he muttered as he got up. How long had be been out for?
been waiting and normally Steve wouldn’t have minded, but today he did. This had been
“It’s a Friday night.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The brunette took a sip of his champagne. “No, I didn’t. But I wanted to.”
Steve blushed and stepped to the side. “Sorry, of course, come in.”
“Sounds like a plan.”
“Tony!” he called, waving at the man.
The answer was probably obvious to the both of them, but Steve knew that it was best to talk about it, even if he didn’t want to.
“Do something stupid?” Bucky offered.
Steve stared at the phone, completely in shock by what just happened. Well…this would certainly be interesting.
“Thank you all for being here today,” Steve started. “Tonight we are celebrating the new Avengers facility, which is comprised of two buildings. There is a building that will act as a home for the Avengers and another one that will act as a workplace for those who work with the Avengers. Today, Tony Stark,” he gestured at Tony. “...and I would officially like to open the facility.”
“It was a nightmare about you...you didn’t make it back from space. Carol came back with the ship but it was too late to save you,” he said, his voice barely above a whisper. “I was too late to save you.”
“Yes. It’s what people eat at night?”
Thank you again to everyone who has read this story. This was my first fix-it fic so I was very nervous about writing it. Your support helped me want to continue to write it, so thank you for all of the kudos and comments. They really meant a lot to me.
“Appreciating the view?”
Tony closed whatever he was working on – it looked like a new Iron Man suit and glanced at him. “We can talk about it right now.”
Steve stopped assembling his sandwich and looked at him, eyebrows furrowed.
“Bucky,” he said, voice hoarse.
“Ah, I appreciate it. Do you have any plans yet?”
Tony winked at him and bounded away from him, swiftly making his way through the crowd. Some people tried to talk to him, but Tony just nodded to them as he rushed past. He didn’t slow down until he was a few inches away from the podium. Steve canted his head to the side; his lips pursed together. What on earth was Tony up to?
Steve’s gaze peeked over his laptop. He shook his head. “I’m not thinking anything at all.”
“Tony, don’t give up, I’m on my way-,” Steve said into the communicator Tony had given all of them.
“Steve?” Bucky asked, his voice cutting through the daze that Steve had fallen into.
Steve recoiled back into his chair. He glanced down at the table, unable to meet Tony’s gaze. To hear him refer to what happened between them as ‘the incident’ and not by what it actually was, made his heart break. He thought that with their conversation a few weeks back, Tony had forgiven him or moved past what had happened…but apparently that wasn’t the case. Not that he could blame Tony for feeling the way he did.
Steve smiled to himself as he reached a packet of tea on the counter; they liked to keep various teas on the counter. “I know…I haven’t forgotten.”
He did have a point. Tony was never one to favor feelings over being honest. A smile spread across Steve’s face; his gaze moved back to the easel.
“Not at all. I’m just working in my lab.”
“It’s not a party, it’s a get-together.”
“I can’t wait that long, Steve. I need to get this off of him now. You know that he can’t use it again.”
Steve was just packing up his messenger bag when his phone buzzed. He pulled it out of his jean pocket and glanced at the screen.
The hostess nodded, completely unfazed that Tony Stark and Steve Rogers were at the restaurant. Steve wasn’t sure if she just didn’t care about who they were or if Tony had visited this place so many times that it didn’t seem surprising when he swung by. She led them to a table off to the right, near a window that looked out into a courtyard that was between this building and the one next to it.
Steve nodded. “Yeah, it is.”
“Why didn’t you tell me you were coming?”
Tony chuckled. “Yes, really.”
“But, Buck-”
“Here’s the frame - do you like it?”
“He told me that you texted him.”
“Steve?”
Steve’s gaze flicked to Tony. He took a long sip of the mixed drink that Tony had gotten him.
He glanced to the doorway; Tony was standing in his room, a black bathrobe draped over him. Steve shifted, pulling the covers up a little bit higher.
Steve laughed. “Of course I did. I have learned a thing or two since I’ve been out of the ice.”
Before Tony could respond, Steve went to the other side of the café to order the coffee. He got Tony’s favorite drink – a coffee with a shot of caramel along along with his own favorite drink: a cappuccino. While he waited for the coffees, he glanced at Tony every few moments. The man met his gaze a couple of times and smiled at him. Steve had seen that smile so many times before but he had never grown used to it. Perhaps it was because he hadn't gotten to see it that much after the Snap. Steve sometimes smiled back at him. When their drinks were ready, he carried them back over to the table.
“Could be about a day, don't give me that look had I known sooner I would have done this a long time ago.”
“Steve you with me? I'm gonna get you out of this. I just...I gotta...” The centipede moved closer forcing Tony to take a step back.
“I know...” Tony replied, his voice going soft. “that pollen was some seriously powerful stuff. I felt it same as you, I literally couldn't think about anything other than how I was going to get off. This right here is why I knew we needed to talk. You were going to beat yourself up and take the blame and if anyone is to blame it's me. I had that thing in the lab and I didn't take the right security measures.”
“What can I do for you Steve?” Tony asked simply while continuing to work. Steve blinked in surprise. Tony wasn't running off, he wasn't telling him to leave he was just continuing his work. What was this? It couldn't be this easy could it? Not after the days he had agonized over everything.
“Yeah-yeah okay plenty of time later.” Tony planted another light kiss on Steve's lips. “Drawer the bottle we'll need that.” Steve nodded and reached over towards the night stand and pulled open the drawer. Inside was a small bottle of lubricant and a box of condoms.
“Help me!? Help-Tony I practically raped you!” Steve nearly shouted. The guilt and worry was too much and it finally spilled over, the tears streamed down his face as he hung his head. Steve brought a hand up and held his head.
“ It won't be long now, we've been at this for hours already, your mind is already starting to fracture.” Thanos held up the gauntlet, the stones all present glittered in the low light. He leaned forward and gave Tony a sympathetic look. “I'm giving you your paradise you just have to let it happen. Every time it gets easier and easier to just let go doesn't it?”
“I couldn't save..them...I-I couldn't...save...them!” Steve's insides twisted and a wave of anxiety filled him when he heard that voice. His reaction was automatic, he turned from the group and retreated back down the hall.
They lost more of their clothing in a hurried frenzy, hands and lips touched and caressed over every inch of exposed skin. Steve kissed Tony deeply again, pulling the smaller man flush against him and rocking his hips into him so Tony could feel all of him, feel the affect he was having on his body. Tony bit back a moan when feeling the hardness of Steve's still covered cock pressed against his thigh, a jolt of arousal hit Tony settling deep in his groin. He needed more than this, he needed Steve naked, he needed the man to fuck him senseless so he could feel something other than the pain he carried and he suspected that Steve felt that way too. Just one night. One night they could forget about Thanos, the Avengers, the dusting, their falling out and just be together. Finally. After years of tip toeing and avoiding the issue they finally gave into their needs.
“Serum, and a combination of the pollen. I'm very viable, always been capable of going multiple times since becoming a super soldier, and the pollen just...” Steve shrugged. “...it helps me get over mental barriers I guess. This is all stuff I have wanted to do, but was always too afraid to take it.”
“Tony you still have your entire life ahead of you. You could meet someone that would be perfect for you...I don't age with the serum. I couldn't do that to you, and you need to understand it would be incredibly hard for me to face that. To watch the people I care about fade away and I just stay here...stuck.” Steve touched Tony's face lightly. “I'm not saying no, but I just want you to have all the options open.
Pepper gave a little shrug. “I think he's someone that can keep you in line...at least better than I ever could.”
Through the muddled lust addled thoughts Steve managed to get an arm free and attempted to shove the segmented body away from himself, but the centipede only coiled more tightly around him. Part of it was bunched up against his groin, its many legs reaching rubbing, massaging and Steve had to bite back the moan that threatened to escape his throat. He had never needed to touch himself so badly, ached so much to take his cock in hand and stroke and stroke until he came messily over his own hand. Steve needed it, his balls were drawn up tight and ached already for release that was so close, but beyond his immediate reach.
“So when you ran off that day?” Steve asked Tony with a hopeful lift in his voice.
“You sure you don't want to buy a model? They are used to that sort of thing and I doubt anyone of them would object to nudity.”
“Yes.” Tony confirmed. “Be my alpha?”
Steve made such sexy noises of want as he moaned into their kiss. His large hands found their way under Tony's shirt and roamed over Tony's chest to feel every curve and angle, and Tony found his skin on fire from the man's touch. He wanted...no...needed more of it, and Steve was peeling the shirt up and over Tony's head. Steve couldn't suppress the gasp when he felt Tony press himself more firmly against him, slotting their hips together, and he felt the hardness of Tony's cock through his pants. It sent a jolt of arousal though him that pooled inside his belly. Tony broke away from Steve's lips and kissed at his neck then suckled lightly on his left ear.
“Regardless of what it looks like.” Steve continued ignoring Tony. “It could be dangerous so we should just kill it and move on.”
“Fuck, oh fuck! Steve I-ah ah I'm gonna come, Steve I'm gonna come!” Tony's body went rigid. The hot pleasure that exploded within him was beyond anything he had ever experienced. The tightly wound coil finally released, his balls felt tight against his body he rocked his hips forward, and his cock pulsed with each spurt, his come splattering on sheets beneath him. Steve's hand continued to stroke over the hard flesh milking Tony of every drop causing him to gasp and buck his hips from the oversensitivity. Steve quietly moaned as Tony's walls clenched, almost vice like around his shaft, Tony was practically quivering beneath him as the intense pleasure rolled through him. He had to hold still for it to pass, and didn't move again until he felt Tony relax beneath him releasing his spent cock. Steve pressed several long kisses to Tony's neck and back, he could taste the subtle saltiness of sweat along Tony's skin.
“Fuck-oh-fuck!” Tony moaned the combined pleasure of his dick sliding into Steve and the centipede assaulting his prostate had Tony coming like a geyser himself. He couldn't recall the last time he had an orgasm such as that, and such a copious amount of his seed that had spilled. Tony panted heavily as the centipede had finally released his arms from its hold and he let them fall limp to his sides as he caught his breath.
It was good, it felt so good. “Ah yeah right there, don't stop please, please!” Steve begged as the centipede continued its assault on his body. Steve writhed beneath the creature, holding his own legs open, his fingers digging into his flesh. He felt the tension building, the increasing pressure in his balls as they grew tighter against his body. Close he was so close, winding up tighter and tighter teetering right on the edge of bliss. The release was nearly explosive, Steve threw his head back practically wailing in his pleasure as his cock pulsed with fresh streams of come. It spattered up across his chest, and abs, but the centipede didn't relent on its stroking, gentle fucking, its legs only tightened the pressure around Steve's oversensitive cock and milked him of every drop.
