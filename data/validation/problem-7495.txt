Sooooo....last chapter was the most comments any chapter I've published in any verse has ever received. And they were all heart-warmingly kind and positive and you all are just awesome. Thank you! And please keep those kudos and comments coming!
Yes, there was quite a lot still to do indeed. But for now Phil was perfectly content to praise and pet his submissive for just a while longer.
The hammer thing, at least, turned out to be true, though the alternative was in some ways just as terrifying: Bucky climbed down off a perch carrying what looked to be a Chitauri-hybrid weapon. He kept his distance from Tony, the way he seemed to know (or had maybe been told) he had to, but the sight was still disconcerting to say the least.
“I don’t really know. In this universe? Yeah, probably; he wants to know what happened to his people, so he’ll probably at least try to make contact at some point. But as far as staying here in the Tower…” Rhodes paused long enough to rub a tired hand across his face. “Something happened, I’m pretty sure, with the other versions of you guys.”
“You’re gonna take your own eye out there, Big Guy.” Tony didn’t mean to talk, he really didn’t. He’d wanted to hang back, unnoticed, a little longer and try to sort out how any of this was possible. (If this version of the team was remotely like his own, their weapons were extensions of themselves. They’d grudgingly give them up to Tony for upgrades when absolutely necessary, but to exchange them this way? To laugh and joke while these core aspects of their identity were in someone else’s hands? It was unthinkable.) But Thor had been investigating the Bites by sticking his face right against the barrels; all it would take was one accidental brush of the charging button and the idiot was going to electrocute himself. And it had been weird enough for Tony to see his own Thor with two differently coloured eyes, dammit.
. Oh, Steve.) “…how about you come inside and protect me from there, huh? Sight lines are better, plus the added benefit of, you know, an actual mattress.” Steve shook his head, face set into stubborn lines that Tony knew well, though they felt far less familiar on this version of the man. “No? Why not?” Stubborn silence. “Gonna need you to use some actual words pretty soon here, Steve.”
“I…sure, yeah. Same thing?”
“Right, I forgot you were collecting social security already. My mistake.” She rolled her eyes, and for a moment she looked so much like Peter that Tony wished he could have taken a picture. Teenagers really were gonna teenager. It seemed to be an eternal law of some kind. “I don’t mean that you’re not reliable, Kamala, or that you need to stop doing what you’re doing. Honestly, you’re one of the lucky ones. You have a good family, a supportive network of friends, and a good head on your shoulders. But it’s still nice to have somewhere to go where people are going to understand. Somewhere to…” Unbidden, an image of Bruce, waiting in the labs each morning with endless patience and empathy and attention swam to the surface of Tony’s mind. “…to check in, I guess.”
Steve took his time with the aftercare, lavishing Phil with praise and touch and small acts of service. Usually, this would have been enough to keep Coulson in that sweet, quiet place for hours, but it had been less than forty minutes when the other man glanced at his watch, and then nudged Steve.
Content Notes: Okay, I don't exactly know how to warn for this without giving half the chapter away. So if you have no triggers, maybe skip this note. In short, Tony is the only one available when JARVIS lets him know that Steve is about to arrive at the Tower in the midst of Dom-dep. He knowingly (without informing Steve, whom he rightly suspects would reject the help to the detriment of his own health if asked directly) presents/performs some behaviours that read to Steve as submissive. Steve's instincts respond by exhibiting some of their own minor shows of Dominance, which he believes at the time to be unwelcome and non-consensual to Tony. None of what happens between them is sexual, and no one is harmed; Steve just doesn't have full knowledge of what's going on, and has some guilt about responding exactly the way Tony is trying to get him to in order to give him some degree of relief from the Dom-dep.
Emotional breakthroughs did not, unfortunately, heal hangovers, and once the food was eaten and the remains of the Maintenance Day festivities cleaned up, all Tony really wanted to do was sleep. But as he watched Barnes wave his goodbyes to Dummy and teasingly bid him to bring a pail upstairs for Tony, he had a niggling feeling that he’d left something undone.
“I can’t…I’m so not even close to ready.”
“Ah, Peter, good. Have a seat. How have things been going this week?” Peter shrugged.
) “How’d you sleep? Bruce said you refused the sleep aid and the pain meds. Wanna tell me why he offered pain meds in the first place, Tones?”
Steve arrived at therapy feeling almost cocky. In the past 48 hours he had scened with one of his partners, an involved, incredible scene that Nat had texted to inform him Thor had been dopey with subtonin over all day; then yesterday he had made it through an entire conversation with Tony. More than that, he’d actively helped Tony with several portions of his contract that had been giving him trouble. Sure it had been difficult at times to be on the outside of that dynamic, but maybe that would be changing soon too.
The reminder of Barnes and Cap is a useful and well-timed one. It had all been starting to sound kind of tempting. The science behind the orientations alone must be fascinating, and the thought of learning it all with Bruce at his side, like the Science Bro olden days before Bruce had left and come back inexplicably BFF with Thor? Amazing. And while Tony had never been particularly interested in the spying end of things, it was still such a novelty to have Clint look at him with anything but anger, and Natasha with something other than regret, that even those lessons had had a certain kind of appeal. But when Steve found out Tony was even farther from what he’d wanted? He’d probably throw him out of the Tower personally, with Barnes’ help.
As you might imagine, Steve is raw and broken and overwhelmed here. If you need to give this response a miss, please feel free to do so. Its only function plot-wise is to confirm that D/s Tony is indeed dead.
“Look, I’m pretty tired from the move. Thanks for the pizza, but I think I’m going to take the rest of it and eat in bed, then pass out watching TikTok or something. Goodnight, Steve.”
“From what I understand, Colonel Rhodes has already been taking care of Tony unofficially for a few days now. I would suggest that, if they both agree, we formalize that arrangement. That way Tony can still get the things he needs without feeling additional anxiety about our expectations or desires for the future.”
“Yeah.”
“What about the other side of things?” Bruce asked. “It was one thing not to explore much about Dominance when we were just talking about putting on a show, but if it’s going to be more than that then we shouldn’t make assumptions.”
He didn’t know quite how tied up in knots he felt about food, though, not until Rhodey playfully attempted to take an orange wedge from his plate and Tony jerked the plate away. His attempt to protect his food was counterproductive to the extreme; half of it ended up sliding off the plate and onto the floor with a splat. Whatever chance he had of not catching the attention of not just Rhodey but everyone in the kitchen was forever ruined by the string of loud, furious curses Tony let loose afterward.
“You’re up. Forty-sixth floor.”
“Peter is
“What are you—”
There was, in short, no reason he could think of for Everhart to burst into his office with a frantic air about her. The woman’s usually flawless hair was tied back in a perilously loose knot that threatened to fall apart any second; she was wearing make up that was smudged and was likely several days old, and instead of her carefully tailored suits she was in a pair of ripped jeans and a t-shirt that looked slightly too big to be her own. He might not have even recognized her if JARVIS hadn’t provided her name when she’d requested access to his personal floor. Before he could even muster a snarky greeting, she was rambling.
“Any further actions will be negotiated as they are required, Princess. I suggest that we not get ahead of ourselves.”
“For me too a little bit. You look great, though.”
Steve was aware enough after a few sessions to recognize the sounds of his temper flaring, and he made a grab for the super-soldier proof stress ball on the side table next to him. His fingers dug into the rubber and whatever the stuffing was made of (Tony had told him once, but he hadn’t listened well enough, had assumed like a fool that if he didn’t keep up with Tony when he got going about science the first time that he could just ask again later) offered the perfect level of resistance, giving just a little.
“I think he needs something in his mouth too. Clint’s right, I think he’s just so hungry for it he doesn’t know which way is up.”
“I understand, Rhodey please please please I understand, I’m sorry!”
Across the room, a repulsor blast from one of the Iron Legion was immediately followed by the telltale sound of shattering glass. (It was downright distressing that Steve knew the sound of the Tower windows breaking without having to look. The fact that they had managed to convince anyone to permit the Avengers to take out insurance on the property was remarkable.) One of the seemingly endless henchmen screamed, begging for Taskmaster’s help before the sound was swallowed up by the now much louder noise from the street below. The man didn’t spare him so much as a glance, entirely focused on the prone figure beneath him.
Some small part of Tony was already mourning for the beginning when all of this had been new and sparkling and exciting. He’d been uncovering not just a potential relationship, but an entire world behind it, filled with tantalizing opportunities for discovery. But mostly the prospect of trading in the shiny newness of it all for something a little less volatile and unpredictable felt wonderful. They reminded him of the brief times he’d imagined a life after Iron Man in his own world, except where the visions of settling down with Pepper on a farm or whatever had always remained vague and elusive, like trying to hold on to a dream after waking up even as it was already slipping through your fingers, this was solid. Real.
“Breathe, doll.” Didn’t he understand that Tony couldn’t breathe, that pain had never, ever been like this before? He didn’t need breath, didn’t need anything but Bruce’s flogger pulling him apart with every delicate, perfectly-aimed blow. “
“I told you, I’m fine to go out again tonight. I took a nap yesterday afternoon and I’ve never needed much—” Masdee did not even look up from the digital map she was surveying with Ayo. (Steve barely restrained a wince; being ignored would push all of Talia’s buttons on the best of days.)
“I texted him yesterday to ask if he wanted to grab some lunch, but JARVIS implied that he was busy with something for Coulson.”
“Would it be overly optimistic to ask if any of my clothes—”
Neil M. Richards and William D. Smart. “How Should the Law Think About Robots?”
am not liking the sounds of where this is heading,” Tony muttered petulantly.
“It was very smart of James to help you learn to associate this kind of communication with pleasure. I’d hate to send mixed messages by having you do the same during what is technically part of a punishment, but perhaps if you’re very good for me over the next couple of days I might consider making later sessions more, mmm, participatory, shall we say?”
“That’s alright. Can I have your permission to try some things over the next few days, to get a handle on what you might need with food? Not as a Dominant—okay, to be a hundred percent transparent I’m sure it would soothe those instincts too—but mostly just as a friend and a doctor who isn’t wild about how ragged you’re looking?”
“He’s not joking. Most of us live in perpetual hope and dread of him performing that little bit of witchcraft,” Clint said wryly, not a hint of concern or pity in his voice. “Un-pretzel just a little bit for us, honey, let Thor get a cloth in there to clean you up. I promise you can go right back to your koala impression as soon as we’re done.”
“Honestly, buddy, I don’t understand it either. Only parts of it. But I do know it’s damn good to see you.”
That…that, Tony hadn’t been expecting. He’d lived this lie for so long and with such flawless execution that this particular option never even occurred to him anymore when people threatened to expose his secrets (which they did on practically a weekly basis, to be fair.) Ice-cold panic gripped him, the pressure so intense and sudden it felt like it had when he’d first woken up to find half of what had once been his chest cavity taken up by the arc reactor. (Invasive, his insides suddenly on display, he couldn’t think, couldn’t breathe…oh fuck, anything anything but this.)
“You don’t even know me. It’s him you want to save, him you want to get the chance to rest with.”
was not a goddamn option.
Bucky elected to forfeit his turn.
They had all grown used to the closer relationship with that Bruce and Hulk were working on developing, but this particular entrance still made Coulson jump, then laugh aloud and wish he could take Hulk up on his proposal. It would certainly make compiling this document more efficient.
“You don’t owe me any apologies sweetheart. It’s just…it’s not an easy topic.”
Dummy on my case about stealing all the food he pretty clearly made for you.” Tony muttered things about conspiracies and overfeeding and something about his jeans not fitting; the latter was particularly absurd given that he was narrower, especially at the waist, than their Tony had been. But Steve still made a mental note to get JARVIS or Pepper or someone to ask if Tony wanted to order some new clothes.
“Uh…six, maybe. After the surgery things got better, but after Siberia…it got worse again. The shield collapsed parts of the artificial sternum they made to hold things in place once the arc reactor was gone.”
Well I don't know about anyone else, but this week felt about a year long for me. I'm feeling pretty drained and defeated by the world.
No warnings I can think of for this set of replies, but as always, let me know if you have concerns or questions.
“Yes.” He waited for her to expand on this statement which was stubbornly non-communicative even for Natasha. Nothing came.
“Yeah? Anyone grab
His stomach was in his throat as he raced to the roof where the quinjet was already landing. Most of the team was still getting suited up, but Coulson had beaten him there. He stood, arms crossed and expression grave, and did not seem remotely surprised to see Tony.
“Everyone gets like this after scenes with Phil,” Bucky advised sagely (and correctly.) “Personally I think that’s why he’s classified relatively low on the scale. I don’t think anyone could survive being Dominated by him on the regular. S’like being turned inside out.”
Right away Tony ran into somewhat of a roadblock. Practically all of the articles were written with the assumption that the person aiming to support the Dominant in deprivation was at least partially submissive; there were things other Dominants could to basically stall until someone else got there, but from Tony could understand, none of it really did much.
Maybe it should have felt less special to see the prized substance on another member of the team, but sometimes this whole poly deal was a little easier than Tony anticipated. Instead of feeling jealous, or like his own gift had been somehow cheapened, it felt like the watch took on a new level, marking him not just as Thor’s, but as a member of something larger. He flushed at his own sappiness and hurriedly made to stare down at the blank notepad on the table.
“Do you want Bruce to come up and check on me, or would you prefer to do it yourself?”
As this is a question mercifully not focused on, say, Stark’s psyche, I volunteered to take it on.
“How about a fashion show?” she proposed. Tony snorted, ready to play it off as a joke, at least until Clint made a dramatic show of pausing the movie and grabbing the popcorn, which had previously been untouched.
As the team continued to prepare for their departure, they all kept sneaking sideways glances at Tony as if trying to catch him in a lie. The last time, he waved jauntily at Natasha, who had the decency to flush just a little and quickly look away. He couldn’t entirely blame them for their skepticism, though. Even as he watched them file into the Quinjet and fly off, Clint a familiar silhouette at the controls, Tony knew he should have at least felt guilty for not fighting to join them when they were already a man down. Turned out the only thing he felt weird about was not saying much of a goodbye. But they’d given Tony access to the comms so that, at least, was solvable.
Any suspicion Tony had that Strange was just making some kind of snipe about Tony’s intelligence as compared to his was stifled the second the spell or whatever it was started. The scenes didn’t come in any logical order; it was more akin to waves of data washing over him. He asked about Rhodey first, because the immediacy of his presence in this universe had his counterpart on Tony’s mind almost constantly.
“Sam! You bastard, are you aging in reverse or some shit? Or is it the lack of proximity to this one,” Clint pointed to Steve, who rolled his eyes, “that has you all dewey-skinned and fresh-faced?”
“Want my advice?”
They’d gone through the list of exactly what Tony was being punished for before this had started, and Tony had agreed with most of it, but this…this one was too much, too far. He shook his head, face rubbing against the leather of the bench, and Steve sighed from behind him. Tony knew a brief moment of relief and disappointment when he thought Steve might have already given up on this whole punishment thing.
Ultimately, it was a simple and as complicated as that, wasn’t it? Tony was a version of the man they had loved, but they weren’t the same. And there was already a risk the subtle distinctions between them might start to wear, leaving behind that vague sense of dissatisfaction you got when you ate just enough to near being full but not quite enough to actually
“Sokovia fell,” Bucky added after they’d all discretely pretended not to have been paying attention to JARVIS and Steve. “It fell, and Tony has alluded to other circumstances, something about a bombing at the UN? Anyway, a bunch of countries got together and demanded regulation in the form of the Accords.”
“What, watching Cupcake Wars?”
He started sobbing only two blows into Thor’s set, undone by the demigod’s combination of intense force and even more powerful verbal expressions of love and support. His tears dripped down onto their clasped hands, and Rhodey used his thumb to stroke across the web of callouses and scars (some familiar, a few not) that made up Tony’s fingers and palms. He was so damn close now, Rhodey himself wanted to beg the team to finish it, to push him that last step of the way. Clint's set (dear God Rhodey had never thought about what a benefit the man's legendarily flawless aim would be to him as a Dom, Jesus) edged him closer still.
“I wanted to. I really—”
Content Notes: This chapter contains non-sexual punishment for a 'real life' (that is, non-scene based) transgression. If you want to avoid that, skip the section beginning "Tony was still tingling from a combination of..."
If Tony hadn’t already been naked in front of Rhodey for the past 24 hours, he undoubtedly would have felt way more embarrassed at the sight he made: kneeling and strapped face-down to a piece of furniture the team had called a spanking bench (which, could it not at least have a less embarrassing name?), his ass in the air and his legs cuffed down a foot or so apart. The thing was well padded, which was probably the only reason that lying with so much of his weight on his chest and hips wasn’t painful; the team had also forgone the strap that could have been buckled across his back to reduce the pressure. It wasn’t exactly a comfortable position, but at least for now that had way more to do with emotional strain than physical.
Tony said his safeword at a near whisper, not entirely certain if he even wanted Clint to hear it.
“General?” It was hard for Steve to tell, sometimes, but he was relatively sure C’Chemi was teasing her commanding officer, because the plane was already reversing its progress to cross back over the shield. Masdee chose either to ignore it or was genuinely unaware. Certainly she wasn’t
“We gotta go tell him he’s awesome!” He stood on wobbling legs, yelping in outrage as Thor hooked an unfairly huge arm around his waist and plopped Clint into his lap.
“Woah! It talks?”
Slowly, the room started to fill up as the rest of the team trickled out of bedrooms in twos and threes. They all greeted Tony with their usual warmth, and so many of them offered to bring him food and beverages of one kind or another that he started having JARVIS greet each new person with an update about exactly how much Tony had already consumed that day. They exchanged pleasant inquiries about the quality of one another’s sleep, debated acceptable yogurt parfait inclusions (prompted by Clint’s attempt to put a layer of chocolate cereal in his), and they made a group video-call to Dummy and the other bots to assure them of their well-being and their plans to return. The latter especially was fucking adorable, but the longer the whole thing went on, the more worry started to gnaw at Tony. Were they going to spend the entire vacation like this, ignoring the circumstances that had brought them there in favour of keeping the peace? Once upon a time, Tony would have been all in favour of that kind of thing, but now, well, they’d gone and taught him to want more. (Assholes.)
Clearly, Peter thought wryly, the multiple discussions that all of his nearest and dearest had been forced to endure about enhanced cybersecurity in the wake of Peter’s outing as Spider-Man had not been lost on Ned. MJ had replied to this with an eyeroll emoji, but then added,
“He won’t be again, Natasha. I can’t promise much when it comes to him; things are too new, there are so many variables…but I give you my word that he will never be alone again.”
“Yeah probably! Look, the two of you—especially you—waited so long to do this that it’s practically reached mythic proportions by now. You gotta bring it back down to Earth a little bit, otherwise both of you are gonna be on edge the entire night.”
In what felt like seconds, the room was empty again save for Steve and Natasha. She didn’t bother with any preamble, nor did she address his takedown (assault) of Alex.
“Oh Peter I’m so sorry—”
“I don’t follow,” Phil confessed.
“Naw, just already regretting that tonight will eventually be over, and wishing I could live it and archive every part of it at the same time,” Steve confessed with a self-depreciating smile. Tony made a quiet, thoughtful noise, which Steve honestly thought very little about for the rest of the song as he held Tony close, sliding his hand up from Tony’s waist every once in a while to toy with his curls.
“Trust me. This will drive Steve absolutely insane.”
The others proved to be just as interested in Tony’s work with Coulson as Bruce had been, and that conversation lasted them through the preparation and serving of the meal. Natasha had prepared
“I used to wonder, a lot, what would have happened if the other Coulson had lived. If he could have stopped us from disintegrating the way we did,” he said in a voice just louder than a whisper. On screen, the smarter of the two mice was attempting to build a mechanical human suit in an elaborate plot to avoid work and plot world domination instead. It was just similar enough to the Iron Man armour that the resemblance had to be intentional, which meant Phil had not only chosen a date involving cartoons, he’d personally curated the collection. Tony pressed a secret smile against Phil’s shoulder, then hummed when Coulson’s hand found his hair and started toying idly with his curls. (The team all had such a thing about his hair; it wasn’t that Tony minded it longer like this, but it was mainly the fact that none of them could seem to keep their hands away from him that kept him from ever doing more than trimming it.)
“But I’ll go make more,” Bruce continued, smiling as Thor rose to join him. (The demi-god claimed he wanted to help, though Steve was pretty sure he also intended to scope the place out for additional snacks.)
sense.
In what was becoming far too common a scene, Tony stood in the elevator of Stark Tower with no clear destination. He’d gone down to the shop at first, planning to continue his sneaky work for SI, only to find that Pepper had replied to his encrypted plots to save the R&D department from itself with one of her own.
“Oh?”
“Yeah, I think there are several things we should say to each other,” she snapped. Clint turned back to glance at Tony, and for just a few seconds his features softened, frustration morphing into concern and something almost resembling awe. And that, far more than his attempts to make her feel unwelcome, made her flush with guilt.
Now…now Steve was done. A distant part of him was aware that Domen probably had more to say. Hell, he knew enough of protocols to be aware she would at least want to debrief, make sure that Steve wasn’t going to be on his own tonight. He wanted none of it. Steve had done what was asked of him, had spoken those hateful fucking words (deaddeaddead Tony was dead he was never coming back). He had nothing left to give.
“How are the eggs?” Steve teased, gesturing to the mostly untouched plate in front of his teammate. Thor glared halfheartedly.
“I…it was.” He swallowed, and appealed to Coulson which what had to be a truly pathetic expression. “Yes, I’ve thought about it a lot. I just…it’s a lot. To take in.”
Finally, Steve snapped. Got the kid into a modified crab hold and let the true extent of his strength turn it into something brutal enough to make the other man release a piercing scream that painted the walls of the gym. The room, filled just moments before with taunts and shouted wagers and encouragement for both sides, was suddenly silent. He released Alex as quickly as he could, and was attempting to reach out and help the other man to his feet, when a flash of red hair near one of the corners revealed Natasha, reclined across the ropes as if lying on a hammock. (Steve had long since learned to stop bothering to ask when she’d suddenly appeared somewhere without his noticing. She never answered anyway, and it gave the woman way too much satisfaction.)  She made no attempt to aid Alex, and needed only one venomous stare to essentially forbid Steve from doing so either.
Coulson was using his most vicious tone, the one that promised severe retribution under a veneer of bored, bureaucratic disinterest. On its own that voice was usually enough to get Agents confessing their darkest secrets and offering their most sincere repentances. Talia didn’t bat so much an eyelash.
Tony didn’t offer an explanation for his erratic appetite, which these days was a constant battleground between his body’s visceral, frantic desire to never experience real starvation again and his much longer history with struggling to eat during periods of stress. Natasha didn’t say more on the topic either.
So, I created a major outline of the story as a whole before writing. It’s broken down into Big Beats (things that absolutely have to happen and won’t be changed); these have included things like D/s Tony’s death and its cause, the results of MCU Tony’s bloodwork and his decision to stay in the D/s universe, and, as you recently saw, the contact with Peter. The outline also contains certain scenes that, while I knew I absolutely wanted them to happen at some point, I didn’t yet know where they would fit best. The Clayton Park scene is a great example of that. I had the idea for Clayton Park almost right from the beginning and I
“It has been…complicated. Most of the major players who the Feds have proof were in the know about Howard’s cover-up have been indicted by now. Which is nice, and it does mean that I can finally feel safe taking my garbage out at night and other silly little things that got difficult near the end of the stand-off. But it still comes with a price. Morale is low—a lot of people resigned, and then another wave once the stock drop came in. For the most part the ones who are left respect you and think you did the right thing in sharing the information about Howard, but I think a lot of them are feeling a little lost. Maybe I am too.”
“No one’s fucking taking my blood. I mean it, Banner, I’ll leave first.”
“Please. Please, Clint, fucking please. I need, you’re too, it’s, yesyesyes.” What started as a plea ended as more of a chant, because the second Tony took the cue from the story and started begging in earnest, Clint’s hand was finally wrapped all the way around him, jerking him off with brutal efficiency. It felt like Clint had about thirty fingers; he used the pads of each digit to create constantly varying degrees of pressure, a maddening dance that made it impossible for Tony’s brain to track individual sensations. He’d never felt so entirely outside his mind before, so purely made of base reaction.
No additional warnings I can think of for this chapter other than that Bucky breaks down why Steve's yelling at Tony in the previous chapter was such a crappy thing to do, and that one of those reasons involves it having risked, however unintentionally on Steve's part, a non-consensual power-exchange. If you need or want more information before reading, feel free as always to let me know.
Thor abandoned his previous pursuits entirely in favour of striding across the room and coming to kneel in front of Tony.
If he hadn’t been on the very edge of panic, he would have taken out a sketch pad and tried to capture the sight on paper. Instead, he stared at the arc reactor (he knew Tony called it something else, but to Steve it would always be the arc reactor, the very heart of Tony) sitting on his bedside table. He was terrified to touch the thing when he was this close to losing control, but it helped to see the light still shining from it, bright and unwavering.
“I didn’t kick you anywhere, Tony. You told me you were leaving. Should I have barricaded the door? Set Hulk outside?” Steve asked. “And I don’t see our friendship as ruined in any way. I
“Hey, Cap.”
“I just think we need to review now that we have more to go on,” he explained to a decidedly displeased team who was eager to drink and rant. Only Steve seemed to be in quiet agreement; the only thing that halted his almost manic glee about his and Tony’s decision to involve themselves romantically these days was the merest mention of the Soul Stone, especially what it had been used to do to the Tony of their own universe.
compared to seeing them like this. None of the Doms tried to imitate or compete with one another, they worked with a singular, focused purpose; the punishment built slowly and steadily, the distinctions between each of their styles enough to keep Tony off-balance and focused without tipping him too far toward abjection or self-loathing.
“Look,I know you’re concerned and based on what JARVIS has put together about what happened in your universe you have cause to be, but Ultron is perfectly safe.” The glass that had just barely escaped damage earlier in the call is not so lucky this time; from the sounds of it, Tony had launched it against the wall.
It wasn’t low stakes, though, at least not for Steve. He held his breath for the close to a minute that it took Natasha to put Tony on his knees and slip the ball gag into his mouth. It was a good choice for a beginner—small, breathable, not something that would make him drool or cause him discomfort if worn for several hours—but he still found himself on edge, awaiting a sudden show of panic or anger.
Hearing from Tony himself largely eliminated any remaining efforts to argue against Steve’s plan. He watched as Clint seemed to fold in on himself, saw the way Phil grew quiet and still and Bucky stared aimlessly out the window. (Steve truly had no idea how any of them would survive it if Tony didn’t choose to stay.)
“I have no idea,” he sighed. Bruce’s gaze on him grew sharper, more assessing, and Tony couldn’t even muster up the energy to blush, or try to avoid being studied by eyes that always saw too much. At this point, maybe someone telling him what the hell his deal was would be a welcome break.
to be Ultron?
“Some of the other ones I’ve seen, the tails were harder, and lighter. Or braided together. What’s the difference?”
The author also wants to interject! This takes place during the events of Chapter 33, and I’m super excited this question got asked because I wrote and then cut this scene, and always felt a little sad about it. Thanks for giving me the chance to share!
He was off the bed and on his knees before he’d even consciously planned to stop feigning sleep. By the time Steve seemed to catch up with the sight in front of him, Tony was halfway done unlacing the first boot, and was urging Steve to lift his foot .
The room was silent for close to two minutes. Tony ate, and tried very hard not to stare, or to fill the silence the way that a childhood in high society had basically trained him to do. Eventually, Clint’s hand was on Tony again; this time, there was no mistaking his touches as anything but definite and purposeful, because Clint dragged two fingers lightly all the way up Tony’s forearm, pressing unerringly down on Tony’s medial nerve once he neared his wrist. His hand twitched like he’d been shocked, and Clint arched a brow.
Unlike with Clint, there had been very little talking prior to Tony’s scene with Natasha officially starting. She’d asked a couple of clarifying questions about his feelings on water, she had him repeat his hard limits and safewords, and had made room for Tony to ask any questions he had about her own contract.
“Space, actually. The first time out against Thanos we tried to take the fight to him. Followed him to his home planet, actually, and almost had him beat—but then we lost. Most everyone there with me,”
“JARVIS, is this a makeshift Hulk playroom?”
“Agreed.” Natasha nodded and then stood, sliding the plates from Phil’s hands and shoving them at Clint.
It was longer than a standard pillow, rectangular and heavy. A press with his foot left an imprint that took close to a minute to fully smooth out again (probably memory foam in there then.) The fabric was well-worn in places, but had obviously been cared for well, no signs of staining or discolouration.
“Let your hips open up for him, beautiful. Trust me, you want your muscles as relaxed as they can be for this.” If Bucky’s nearness was a surprise, the absolute Dominance threaded through the seemingly gentle suggestion was stunning. Tony’s body was responding before his mind could even comprehend it.
“Well, the best Bruce can figure is that spider physiology does not like Asgardian liquor. There’s some kind of study he cited where spiders exposed to regular booze were something like 19 percent less effective at simple tasks like forming webs…”
In symphony, we of course get a darker view of the Hamilton/Tony parallels, one that on one hand accepts the fact of Hamilton/Tony’s death as an inevitable turn of events. But I also love the lines that make up the title because just like the way Hamilton talks about America as an unfinished symphony that he got to briefly participate in composing, Tony’s life (in both universes) is so. damn. unfinished. And I liked the idea of exploring what would happen if forces beyond him kind of recognized that and refused to let him go. Tony started this story prepared to die, but not remotely prepared to live, so it’s very much a narrative that tries to think through how he could go about doing the latter, and how the team can help him make a livable, healthy, joyful life for himself.
“He didn’t seem fine when he left the gym today, Steve.”
have it easy. Ultron was not easy for him. For any of us.” And wasn’t that the understatement of the century. The circumstances leading up to Ultron had been some of the worst of Steve’s life. He was furious at the implication that any of it had been easy just because it was different from this Tony's version of things.
desperate and broken teenager. This child was Tony’s just as surely and completely as any child had ever belonged to any parent.)
“Why?” Steve rasps. He sounds like he’s been screaming nonstop for days. The words sound like they’re scraping his throat up as they leave his body. Peter feels sorry for him, and then annoyed that he’s sorry, especially since he’s also so damn angry at Steve.
“And having always been very into self-care, it makes complete sense that you’re suddenly going to bed at two in the afternoon and staying there until dinner,” Bucky muses aloud.
“I’m going to show you,” Steve vowed, later when Tony was half asleep in his arms. “I love you and I’m going to show you what that really means.”
“There’s my good boy.” But Thor was back to shaking his head. “No? How come you think that?”
“Just because you’re not bound to something doesn’t mean the implication of the cuffs isn’t clear. Hands on your thighs and don’t move ‘em again unless I tell you to. If you want to be my good boy you’ve gotta earn it, don’t you?” Clint’s index finger flicked out to play with the head of Tony’s cock as he said ‘good boy,’ and he chuckled darkly as Tony all but thrashed against the bed in response. “Right. Now, storytime. It’s a bit of a choose your own adventure tale, if you will. I’m gonna talk to you, tell you some things I’ve been thinking about since I read through your contract. I won’t touch on any hard limits, or anything you ranked below a 3 in terms of interest. If you particularly like something I’m saying, you’ll ask me politely for more. If you don’t like something, you can stay silent, or say ‘something else, Clint.”
They were sat at one of the semi-circular booths made for large parties. Like most restaurants, the base of the table was narrow and far enough away the booths that submissive who wished to kneel would have ample space. By the time Steve arrived, Clint had already collected a kneeling pillow from the basket by the coatrack and settled himself at Bucky’s feet. The latter still appeared faintly surprised by this turn of events, as if he were still getting used to having a sub or a Switch so casually put themselves on their knees in front of him.
Hulk grunted out a skeptical ‘pah,’ but thudded in the direction that Tony had instructed and deposited his handfuls of civilians. Tony intended to shut up after that, content in the knowledge that the most visceral parts of Bruce’s psyche still trusted him. But then Clint got that look in his eye that meant he was under a minute from jumping off something high, and neither Thor nor Rhodey were near enough to catch him.
It was the type of thing the other version of Tony never would have done at a public event, too conscious of ramping up the mania around his and Steve’s relationship. This Tony was also the one to ask Steve to dance first, though it was Steve who did exactly as Pepper had already given him permission to do and brought them just slightly closer together than seemed to be the general rule at these things. Tony flashed him a wicked little grin in response and laid his head against Steve’s shoulder. Cell-phone cameras flashed from multiple sides, and Steve heard the woman dancing next to them give a wistful sigh. He wished, somewhat absurdly, that he could pause the moment long enough to draw it for himself. He had spent so long not wanting to be in the present that he was greedy to capture it from every possible angle now.
That hope dimmed a little when he returned to his room to find an extremely irritable James Barnes, who despite agreeing the night before, was now entirely disinterested in calling his therapist for a phone session.
“No need to break out the pout,” Natasha laughed from the regal position she had assumed atop Thor’s lap. “My god that should be illegal. All Bruce meant is that we know you’re tired and today has already been a lot. It’s okay if you want to just float in your headspace for the rest of the night. What we had planned is fairly…intense.”
On the wall of the conference room was what looked like a giant wooden maze, which was covered by a thick layer of glass. It appeared to be empty, except for a gold ring that sat in the bottom right-hand corner. On the opposite wall was a bunch of unrelated lab equipment that Tony could only assume had been misplaced at some point.
Content Notes: Rhodey provides some backstory about D/s universe's Tony and his relationship with his father. It involves deliberate withholding of access to submissive headspace and resources. If you need to skip it, stop reading the chapter at the paragraph that begins "I met my Tony..."
“Try the first day,” Bruce interrupted smugly. Tony blinked and glanced at Steve as if for confirmation. (And damn if, even in the midst of everything, that didn’t feel fantastic, the way Tony now looked to Steve so easily for affirmation, even of something so minor.)
Phil had given this particular element of Tony a great deal of thought ever since Bruce had made similar claims about his reactions the previous evening. They knew so little about cross-dimensional travel that there was simply no way of gauging how likely or unlikely the kinds of changes Bruce was talking about really were. And certainly that kind of metamorphosis would solve many of their current problems.
“Well, that was probably the best possible news,” Rhodey said once she’d gone. He had guided Tony over to the workshop couch and he had his arm open wide, clearly ready for Tony to curl against him like a cat. He wanted that, would never get entirely over the easy way that everyone in this universe offered touch so freely and frequently. Today, though, Tony sat down at the other end of the couch, body closing in on itself. Rhodey frowned a little, but continued his cheery monologue. “I mean the cortisol is an issue, obviously, but this way it sounds like your body will have a lot of time to adjust instead of it being like just flipping a switch.”
Conversation flowed relatively easily, too. Phil, Tony, and Natasha were all clearly skilled at filling any silences that became too lengthy, but it didn’t feel like a forced kind of intimacy. Some of the questions were the same basic, eye-rolley ones teenagers at any social gathering with adults got asked, but it never felt like an interrogation. And they all offered some pretty great tips and anecdotes about the superhero gig, too. Peter was able to be open about what he did with May and Tony now, but this was different. This was a whole room of people just like Peter. For once, he didn’t feel like the odd one out. How could he when Clint was in the middle of a lengthy rant about the various substances aliens tended to ooze?
, and he still didn’t care enough to tune into all of it.
“No, I want to try it,” Tony interrupted before he could lose his nerve. “But you’ll help me, right? I still don’t want to hurt anyone, and if Thor doesn’t want this—” Clint leaned forward and kissed him again, and Tony let himself become a bit more aggressive in response than he normally would, thrusting his tongue into Clint’s mouth and biting at his bottom lip. When they clawed their way apart, Clint’s eyes were sparkling with mischief.
(See the end of the chapter for
1. Yes, Dr. Banner does provide check-ins to Switch members of the team. They are mandatory the morning following a scene where the Switch has been in a submissive headspace, and are held a minimum of once a fortnight
say what I think you’re about to say or I swear I’ll disable your communications with everyone in the Tower but Drama. And, fair warning, she’s newly obsessed with trying to steal Steve’s coin collection.” It blew Tony’s mind sometimes that he had ended up with someone who possessed an honest-to-Thor
“Alive, barely. He’s careful never to kill, though he’s made promises to everyone he’s gone after about coming back if they don’t give him what he wants.”
“Well, Malibu might be temperate but late November is still a little too chilly for surfing. As long as the floorpan is the same, though, there’s a sunroom and a pool on the upper level. Being warm sounds pretty damn good right now, as does seeing the lot of you wet and in very skimpy swimwear. Come on, you basically can’t say no to me right now, right? Dropping, broken sub and all?”
Tony noticed Natasha first, mainly because the sight didn’t make sense. She was perched on a ledge in the northeast corner holding…was that a bow? (Was this universe somehow so backward that Nat, not Clint, was Hawkeye?)
“Just. The questions. I’m asking. If I need you to clarify or expand I’ll let you know. Stop trying to anticipate where we’re going and what I need from you. The beauty of this whole thing is that I will tell you.” And that kind of does sound beautiful, actually, the thought of someone’s expectations of Tony being clear and open and achievable. Nuance was great and important and all, but when the entire world existed in varying hues of grey as Tony’s so often did, that kind of simplicity was decidedly rare.
“Clint, for goodness sake, we have guests,” Phil chided, frowning down at his grilled cheese.
Taskmaster was a mercenary through and through, though, which meant the amount of effort he put into any particular battle was directly proportionate to the amount he stood to gain through from a victory. Judging from the full-scale assault he had mounted today, the potential paycheque had to be absolutely enormous. Even Steve was panting a little with the exertion of dodging blows that so closely mirrored his own in strength and accuracy.
Peter had long since given up figuring out how it was that Gwen was able to move so quickly and quietly. However, the pained expression on her face when she moved to sit down across from him was entirely new. He frowned, wondering whether to broach that subject or his grovelling first. Remembering how irritated Aunt May used to get when she felt like Uncle Ben was trying to rugsweep a mistake he’d made, Peter went for the latter.
Coulson minimized the other screens, spreading those in the SWORD (ugh) pile apart so each was individually visible.
“Find Bucky,” he ordered, his own system calming in response to Natasha’s discontent. “The two of you…I know I haven’t always handled it well, how violent you both sometimes need to be with each other, but I’ve seen first-hand how much it can help. Go find him, work some of this out, and don’t go back to the penthouse until you’ve had at least five hours of sleep.”
“I do not!”
“I knew there was a reason you were my favourite.”
“We didn’t mean it Mr—err, Dr.—err—”
2. You are absolutely correct that in a relationship involving this many people, jealousy does occur. There were several potential examples to choose from, but this felt like a particularly rich instance.
It was like watching a tennis match. As one, the eyes and attention of everyone in the room turned to Coulson, who was looking not at any of the other humans in the room, but up at the nearest camera.
As always, feel free to let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
Some time passed. Tony had no idea how much, or how little. At one point, Phil asked his permission for Clint to come onto the floor.
“He’s
So, this chapter was initially going to be pushing toward some of the more intense, dramatic and plotty stuff that's coming, but the world is a scary and difficult place just now. I needed some tenderness, and thought you might too. I hope you enjoyed the chapter, and as always I value your comments, kudos and questions.
“So you’re bleeding from your cheek here. Anywhere else I need to know about?” Tony rolled his eyes with a hint of a playful grin, forgetting for just for a moment to be guarded and scared and whatever else he was feeling; witnessing this scene, one that had played out a hundred times exactly like this, was almost worse than the moment when Tony remembered where he was and brought all his walls back up.
“Well he called me Platypus and Honey Bear, for one,” Rhodes said, leaning against one of the treadmills with a smile both fond and pained. Their Tony had always called him Popcorn. “Other than that…he’s pretty scattered. It came in bits and pieces, and I didn’t want to press too hard on anything; he came close to what looked like a panic attack on two separate occasions.” Steve’s gut clenched, dominant instincts screaming at him at the very notion of his (a, goddammit,
“It is Asgardian gold, a rare and treasured substance,” Thor explained. “It is capable of responding to the wearer’s needs, and may be able to offer comfort in our absence.” Which, okay, Tony had no idea what the hell that meant, but it was impossible not to return the puppyish grin the demigod shot Tony before he nodded and followed Natasha onto the jet.
At least this time Tony got to be the one to walk away from Bruce instead of the other way around.
, and met Pepper’s blue eyes.
“I’m fine, Cap, geez. Have you forgotten what I do for a living or something, Boss?” Clint teased as he resettled himself, this time square in the middle of Steve’s lap. (He must have gone down for someone last night; Clint rarely initiated physical contact when both he and his partners were at baseline, and he was sparing and calculated with it in Dominant headspace.)
“Finally decided to get out of bed, huh sweetheart?” He couldn’t quite place the tone in Steve’s voice, which was warm and soft as always, but also threaded with something like a secret. He frowned at the smoothie that was handed to him, trying to put together the pieces of this puzzle. “Didn’t get dressed up though, I see. Can’t say I mind the thought of you sitting around all day in my clothes. You been missin’ me while I’m at work?”
Finally, Steve and Talia encounter and work with several a small contingent from the Wakandan army beginning here and spanning the next couple of chapters. Their cultural practices surrounding how orientation is practiced are different than those familiar to our heroes. Specifically, Dominance and submission are actively used by troops, while orientation is legally kept out of all workplace situations in North America. Everything is still consensual and safe, just different from how things are done elsewhere. I can't warn much more about the details without giving away plot points, but if this is a trigger and you're concerned, get in contact with me and we can chat privately.
He’d assumed the water question was for the aftercare portion of the proceedings (he’d done a bit of reading, and baths seemed pretty common), but that turned out to be their first stop. Natasha stripped them both with more gentleness than he’d known her capable of, then drew a bath into which she added a small disk she told him was some kind of oil. It smelled like ginger and some kind of citrus, and even if Tony himself was a bit bemused by starting out this way, his body was certainly happy to find itself surrounded by warm water and calming smells.
The rest of the team was already in the living room, even Bucky, though his eyes looked a little red-rimmed, and he had seated himself away from the others, a clear signal that he intended to witness the scene but not actively participate. Tony smiled nervously at him anyway, and felt reassured by the wink Bucky sent him in return.
The thought of taking full ownership for everything the Soldier had done was…well, more than Bucky could take. It filled his veins with ice, made him feel like something toxic that should be contained to one of the bright, carefully marked bins down in Tony and Bruce’s labs.
Getting his mouth on Bruce, finally, felt both familiar and new. He was wider than any of the others, a pleasant, solid weight against Tony’s tongue. Where the blowjob he’d given Phil had been quiet and peaceful and almost soothing, however, Bruce seemed determined to keep Tony off-kilter just enough to make him want to die. He was constantly changing his angle, or drawing back out of Tony’s mouth entirely, shaking his head when Tony reflexively chased him with his mouth.
Steve had been the one to cry that night. He’d gathered Tony into his arms, had picked him up the way Tony usually forbid him from doing, and carried him all the way across the penthouse to the bedroom. For once, Tony had managed to keep himself quiet as Steve had undressed him with painstaking care, then slid on his softest pair of pyjama pants and the sweater he’d stolen from Steve’s wardrobe during his first mission after they’d gotten together. After tucking Tony into the bed and surrounding him with every damn pillow in the room, Steve left only to return with a platter of food that could easily have fed five of Tony, and watched with almost visceral satisfaction as his submissive ate every bite he could manage.
After several aborted attempts that left Tony confusingly half-hard and anxious as hell, he decided that it wasn’t a good idea to start with any of the more intimidating possibilities. After another glance at the list, he selected one thing he’d already experimented with, and one of the more vanilla options: kneeling and dildos. He moved those two items into a separate window, minimized the rest of the list to avoid distraction, then closed his eyes and tried to summon the scene.
Watching all of this play out was diverting enough that Steve didn’t obsess about Tony the way he’d expected to. After everything Tony had been through in the past several days, they’d been prepared for just about anything in terms of a reaction, and Tony taking some time to himself (even if it was colder outside than Steve would have liked) was on the tame side. And Clint, endlessly flexible and capable of handling Tony even at his worst extremes, was ready and waiting downstairs.
“Anthony Edward Stark is alive and, as of several days ago, fully conscious.” She did, at least, pause the footage before the crowd’s reaction to that statement. Steve held his hands up in the ‘I surrender’ position.
“I’ve told you what’s going to happen if you can’t behave for me. I’m not in the habit of repeating myself.”
“Fletcher,” Phil said, already in the process of digging his phone out, presumably ordering SHIELD’s systems to run every conceivable check and surveillance on the guy.
In seconds that felt like they spanned lifetimes, Strange opened the portal he’d come through and drew an object from his desk, setting it on the table in front of them.
“Why not tell him that, then?” Tony asked, recalling his own scene with Natasha. The pain had been awful, but it had also helped, and if that was what Clint felt like he needed there was no reason for Coulson to refuse, was there? The archer smiled a little too knowingly for Tony’s tastes. (The team had definitely been gossiping again.)
Before he could work his way into much of a panic, Thor was moving Tony effortlessly across the bed, positioning him on his front with a pillow under his chest. Clint got off the bed, padded almost-silently across the room in that spy way of his and returned with something Tony couldn’t see.
What if, after so long just spending time in his own skin, Tony couldn’t convincingly manage to put those defences back up again? (What if he succeeded, and the team decided they liked the facsimile of Mark II better than the incomplete and flawed version of submission he could offer them?) The bit of cucumber he was still chewing turned bitter in his mouth, and Tony nearly choked trying to swallow it down.
And then they’d met Kala. He was a Polynesian artist with a small shop near Clint’s old apartment. He’d agreed readily to the exclusivity clause, in large part because it aligned neatly with his own policy of never making any design more than once.
Tony!” the blonde boomed, beaming and holding his arms up in celebratory greeting. (And if the aborted attempt at a more possessive greeting was slightly awkward, it was worth it for the fact that it got the damn Bites out of his face.)
Steve proposes a plan; Steve is also the one who hates the plan the most.
Cap, Tony realized once they were all seated, wasn’t coming. It shouldn’t have come as much of a surprise, given how little he saw of the guy in general, but Steve was usually the first one to want to have Talks like this; he must really be uninterested in having anything but a surface-level acquaintance type thing with Tony.
“That’s not—Tony didn’t consent to—and we’re—I’m fine.”
Rhodey sat on a chair beside the bench, holding both of Tony’s hands. This, Tony felt, was a way better option than the cuffs that were attached to the arm rests.
“I’m assuming we can all see the problem here without me spelling them out?” Pepper asked coolly. They nodded as one. “Good. Then I’m going to take my shadow here,” she gestured to the suit, “down to the shop, because I’m willing to be that while
When the team had drawn straws (literally! drawn straws! like hanging out with Tony was some kind of prize they were going to fight over without some kind of system) and Clint had turned out to be the winner, Tony had downgraded even those expectations. Lose the flowers, add maybe some time on the shooting range, or a retreat into the air vents if things took a particularly disastrous turn.
Though some kind of medical event might, he thinks with a sinking feeling, explain the beeping.
“And presuming I agree to this little stunt of yours, what exactly do you plan to say to ‘everyone’ once you have them in one place?”
), but, well, Rhodey was Rhodey. He’d taken one long look at Tony once he’d collapsed back onto the couch following Barnes’ departure, pulled him half into his lap, and started stuffing berries into his protesting mouth. And sure, Rhodey’s willingness to feed Tony’s ever present skin-hunger without at least a token show of resistance was a little odd. But also almost worth having to cede defeat to the stupid symbolic fruit.
“For what?” When he paused too long, the paddle fell again, on his right thigh this time. Tony managed less than a half a dozen blows before the dam inside him shattered as completely as his physical resistance already had.
“I trust you. More than anyone. And this…” he gestured down to the housing unit glowing in his palm. “I gave this to another you, once. I told him to use it to hide from what was coming, because I knew we’d already lost and I wanted to hurt him as badly as he’d hurt me. I want to give it to you because you’ve given me hope. I don’t have to be Iron Man here, you’ve made good on that promise, made me feel like the rest of me matters. Is worth something.”
“Yeah well…I’ll tell you all about it someday if you want. But today I really did just want to check in and hear about you, and to—and to say I’m sorry. That I haven’t done that in a while. I was a coward, and I was selfish, and I told myself I was staying away for your sake, so that you didn’t end up more hurt and harassed than you already were, but it wasn’t. It was for me, so that I didn’t feel quite so awful seeing it happen up close when I already could barely make it out of bed in the morning. Of all the mistakes I’ve ever made, I think I regret that one most.”
Steve didn’t bother to force himself to listen to the quiet pleasantries the two exchanged on the way to the elevator. The entirety of his attention was on the man who stood in his arms, eyes drooping and head falling forward and then snapping back up as he fought the lure of sleep.
“You’re excused, Agent Avelino.”
“It’s also a regional thing, to a certain extent,” Rhodey added, filling up his own plate and plopping down next to Tony. “Food is a huge aspect of most Southern dynamics. It matters everywhere, of course, but in the South it’s one of the most fundamental ways Doms or switches in dominant headspace demonstrate care and affection. My Mama is a Dom and Pop is a submission-inclined switch. If he tried to prepare or cook his own food I think she might cane him on the spot.”
Phil provides a hands-on lesson about the value of honesty, and Tony learns why no one messes with Dom-Coulson. With a date with Tony finally on the horizon, Steve is a giant sap.
In all, the press conference hadn’t been all that difficult. They’d provided nothing in the way of leaks in advance, which meant everyone there had been stunned and forced to think on their feet. And Pepper, as usual, had out-thought most everyone, preparing Tony well for every single question that had come his way.
“He always opens up the link to the Bifrost when he does this,” she whispered at one point, gesturing to a minimized window which sat at the bottom right corner of her screen. “He doesn’t really need to, he only needs an Einstein-Rosen bridge for spacetime travel, but it’s not usually safe for me to be collecting data when he actually needs it for battle, and I think he still feels angry on my behalf at SHIELD for seizing all my equipment and notes way back when. He’s a really good guy.”
“My last omelette took three hours to make, Rhodey, and it was still barely edible. You seriously do
“I get that, maybe more’n anyone else here. Steve and I…it took a long time, after I came back here, for him to really accept that I wasn’t the guy he knew. Even longer to believe that I didn’t want to be. I wouldn’t wish what happened to me on anyone, and I’m sorry for all the people I hurt, but I ain’t got the time or the inclination to hate all the ways I had to change and adapt to survive. The Soldier is as much a part of me as anything else, and he’s done a hell of a job keeping me and the people I love safe over the years. I ain’t sorry I’m not just James Barnes anymore, and you shouldn’t be sorry you’re not the other Tony.”
“I…now is not the time to discuss this—” Steve wasn’t at an angle where he could see precisely what it was that Bucky did with his face, but whatever it was turned out to be effective as hell. Phil threw his hands in the air and sighed. “Yeah, okay, sure. More time in Dominant headspace would have been good.”
“Are you, you’re pissed off, right? Can you just tell me what I did?”
“I was thinking of changing up the art that’s hanging in the Tower. There’s so much in storage, and since you’ll actually appreciate it way more than I will, I thought maybe we could look through it together sometime.” It occurred to Tony a few seconds after the words left his mouth that it was maybe a little too weird to be keeping up a conversation while in the middle of an explicitly sexual scene. He just felt so damn comfortable, lazy just like Steve had said, and while the fantasy of being kept the way they were playing at had mostly to do with sex, it was also fundamentally one about having time to devote to all the aspects of pleasing his partners. Steve really would get a lot out of the art that Tony had mostly only treated as investments before. Steve smiled and leaned down to kiss him, a slow drag of tongue and teeth that left Tony breathless when it was over.
“He didn’t even hit me!” Tony blurted, then groaned and buried his face in his hands. The rest of his confession was muffled, but Steve’s enhanced hearing was enough to compensate. “He made me come
The existence of the Ultron technology is predicated on the supposition that artificial intelligence can and, under the correct circumstances should, be regarded as sentient and feeling beings capable of meaningful contributions to global security, communication, and wellness. However, this recognition also necessitates an understanding of the system’s moral and ethical responsibilities to other beings.
Peter had therefore looked forward to a peaceful night surrounded by nothing but the occasional whirs and beeps he assumed originated from the various servers and fans that kept FRIDAY and her systems running. Instead, the absence of sensory overload seemed to send his brain into a state of complete disarray. After tossing and turning for hours, his ears seeking out nonexistent noise and trying to form a narrative out of it, he’d given up and hopped on the group chat that he shared with Ned and MJ. Neither of them were up, but it was soothing enough to catch up on their chatter about homework and the latest atrocities offered by the cafeteria. Every once in a while, one of them asked Peter a question too.
“I don’t mind.” There was a rumble that in Bucky’s chest that might have turned into a growl if he’d let it; honestly, it was probably good it hadn’t. Tony didn’t even want to know how apeshit that would make his body go. “Look, I’m not trying to force anything to happen that you’re not comfortable with, I’m really not. If all you ever want is to sub out with me on the floor, I’m cool with that. But don’t avoid it for my sake, okay? Whatever resentment I had towards you pretty much burnt out the second I saw you with my bots, and it’s had weeks to turn into something more positive. And I’ve—I’ve thought about it. You. That way.”
Cautiously, as if about to handle an unstable weapon (actually, with way more care than Bucky tended to treat dangerous weaponry, Steve admitted grumpily), Bucky reached down to stoke Tony’s hair, murmuring something in Russian. Tony rolled instinctively toward the noise, his head practically in Bucky’s lap, and Steve bit harshly on his own lip to stop from grinning.
“Oh Stevie is that what you been thinkin’? Course I miss him. I miss him all the fuckin’ time. Miss him whenever there’s coffee leftover in the pot at the end of the morning, and every time I look at my arm, or Dummy does something especially ridiculous. Mostly I miss him whenever I look at you, because it feels like I lost you both that day.” Bucky bowed his head, and this time he was the one gripping Steve as if trying to press his fingers into Steve’s very marrow. “We’ve been excited to have some version of Tony here because he’s sweet and funny and kind, so much like our Tony but different too. Careful in a way ours wasn’t, and so hurt by the world that sometimes I swear I could just blast my way into the other universe and…the point is, don’t think I don’t care for him on his own terms, I do. But I, at least, have also been excited about having him here because I felt like maybe his coming home might bring you back to us too.”
“Look, most of the time I’m surprisingly okay with all this. Like the whole submission thing, right? It wasn’t  a part of my universe, but it’s—it’s good. It’s helped things that had been broken so long I sort of forgot they weren’t supposed to be that way. But it’s—Christ it’s hard to need people like this. Especially now that my body is literally rewriting itself, so it’s not even a choice anymore…it’s a lot. And every day my old world feels further and further away, and that’s mostly fine because by the time I left there wasn’t much left there for me. But there was…well, him. There was Peter.”
say every damn thing he thinks.)
. Tony had grown to regret much about his impulsiveness, his willingness to deal with the consequences as they came rather than spelling them out ahead of time. But there had still been a kernel of truth in what he’d said to JARVIS that day, and nothing, nothing that had come after would ever take away the sheer and uncomplicated joy Tony had felt when he’d flown for the first time.
“What else does it, uh, do?”
“Meaning?” Clint’s free hand ran through his hair, leaving the short blonde locks messier than before.
“I don’t…idealize anything.”
“Okay good. I…ugh, how is asking someone on a friend outing so much harder than a date? Dates should categorically be more stressful, shouldn’t they? There’s so many more variables at play, and—”
His time with Coulson had been one of the first occasions where Tony had subbed for another member of the team without Steve present. Steve had been surprised to find himself feeling fairly relaxed about it at first, but the longer Tony appeared to be struggling in the aftermath, the more Steve started to wonder if this whole thing hadn’t been a mistake.
After a long, confusing morning, Tony has decided that even if their methods were a bit…odd, he knew what the team was doing. They wanted him to stay, maybe for good reasons, maybe for shitty ones. It was simply too early to tell. But right now they were trying to get him to forge connections to this universe, to care about this version of the team, about Rhodey and his
Steve, it turned out, wasn’t looking—at least not at first. He rattled around in the bench at the foot of the bed, emerging at last with a long wooden case, a promisingly-sized bottle of lube, and something Tony didn’t see that was deposited on the top of the bench. He didn’t make Tony wait long to learn the contents of the box, which turned out to be a series of dildos arranged by size. The smallest was barely wider than one of Tony’s fingers; the largest was definitely among the longest and thickest he had ever seen, easily capable of leaving someone gaping, and it was wickedly curved at one end. He reached out by impulse, ever the tactile learner, and Steve readily surrendered the case so that Tony could handle each of the toys in turn. They were all made of what he was positive was handblown glass that was cool to the touch, and each was a different colour that already gleamed in the low lighting of the room. He suspected that out of the velvet-lined case they’d be stunning. Leave it to Steve, he mused with a barely contained laugh, to seek out sex toys that doubled as art.
“You mean beyond the fact that it’s total bullsh—“
These nauseatingly happy thoughts managed to be absorbing enough that he was stepping inside the gates off Clayton Park before he even really realized his short walk there was over. Most of the team was already there (perhaps Tony was slightly late after all), gathered at a large table in the centre of the main courtyard. Tony allowed himself a moment to just drink in the sight of them. The majority of the team was wearing one of Thor’s most recent attempts at knitting. They were pretty good, mainly because Natasha kept sneaking in and fixing some of the more glaring flaws in the middle of the night. There was no altering the boldness of Thor’s design choices, though, like the neon green of the toque perched on top of Bucky’s head. Most of their hands were covered by some manner of gloves, but Tony felt confident that most of them were wearing the engagement rings he’d designed. They used a variation on the nanotech in his suit; this would allow those of them who needed to remove them frequently for work in the lab (Bruce) or on missions (pretty much everyone) to do so easily. The nanites also held a secret that wouldn’t be revealed until after they were married: a single orange stone, one each sitting in the centre of all of the rings. It was a quiet nod not only to the soul stone, but to the seven pieces of Tony’s own soul that would stand across from him on that day, making promises he’d never truly believed he would ever receive from anyone.
He was pulling apart the muffin, which smelled incredible and was still steaming for goodness sake, when Tony flopped gestured expansively to the contract.
The same character (for reasons unrelated to his orientation) is also asked to leave his home in this chapter. He has somewhere safe to go, and his alientation from his guardian will not be permanent, but again it's something I can help anyone who wants to avoid this material skip if necessary.
Tony knew intellectually that the Switches in the Tower sometimes did check-ins with Bruce. He’d found it vaguely comforting to learn that he was at least not alone in this humiliation. But it was something else entirely to actually witness it. He backed up, hurriedly trying to make it back to the elevator in silence, but this was naturally when Natasha registered his presence and craned her neck to meet his eyes.
“Oh for—that was one time!” They bickered pleasantly all the way to the fifth floor of Hudson Yards, where Bucky steered them into a restaurant called Kawi. The interior was warm woods and soft lighting, nothing like the chaos Steve associated with mall dining, and he caught the scent of a warm, thick stew on one of the tables they passed. Bucky arched a brow as he held out Steve’s chair for him, and Steve rolled his eyes.
For what felt like a long time after the video-call ended, Steve simply watched. To most observers it wouldn’t appear that there was much to bother noting. Masdee was consulting with C’Chemi about the likelihood of T’Challa ever green-lighting Shuri’s proposal to use the exhibition, and herself, to draw the brothers in; Talia remained tucked into the same corner of the tent she’d been in most of the morning, reviewing the thin files containing all the confirmed intel they had on Kaikara and Ochen Ssenjovu. She and Masdee didn’t exchange longing stares or find transparent reasons to interact with one another. There simply hadn’t been enough time for that kind of bond to develop, and if Steve and Talia left within the next few hours with the UN team, nothing was ever likely to come of any of the hints of chemistry that seemed to exist between them.
“That’s the Spiderman! This is great! We’ve been trying to do an intake with him for ages, but he’s surprisingly slippery when he wants to be. Let’s go!” Natasha’s grip on his arm tightened, and Steve glared in exasperation. However untrained and unpolished Spiderman might be, he was incredibly fast and resourceful. If they didn’t hurry they would lose him and it would be weeks before they got another chance like this. Natasha was way too smart and savvy an agent not to realize that, which meant—“You know something.”
“But the Force!” cried Coulson. Finding out Phil Coulson was apparently one hell of a nerd was only like the fourth best thing about this conversation, which was a testament to just how awesome Peter’s life felt right now. He had forgotten all about Tony by the time he and Bruce were debating the physics of the Force-choke.
“All of it I guess. I mean, your world, your Tony, that’s such a definite thing. There’s a whole identity, a whole life built around it. I don’t…it’s not like that for me. It could never be like that for me.”
Shouting was, admittedly, kind of an overreaction. But the check-ins were easily one of the most difficult parts of daily submission. They were embarrassing and invasive and like all the hardest parts of subbing rolled into one. For Steve to insinuate they somehow made Tony feel better was just…no. He stomped his way to the elevator and all the way into the labs.
Steve hardly considered himself good at predicting the future. That had always been more Tony’s arena. But he could see the path ahead of Sam and Bucky so clearly that he felt almost impatient waiting for it to come to fruition. There were already so many little tells—the awareness the two of them had of one another in battle, the way that their once cutting remarks had morphed into a warm series of inside jokes, the way their touches and stares always lingered just a few beats longer than was strictly necessary. They would be marvelous in the field together, but that was nothing compared to what Steve knew they would eventually be off the field.
“I’m not telling you that you taking on additional qualities of submission changes nothing,” Steve continued. “I realize it takes the choice away from you to some degree, and I am truly sorry if you would rather it have been different. But it doesn’t make me want or need you any more or less than I did before, as a submissive or a man.”
On this occasion, even Peter’s morning-brain did consider lying. Lately, though, he’d been finding that the truth of his life was so alienating to most people that trying to fabricate a fiction that would have the same effect was just not worth the effort. And something about Steve’s hesitation in asking made the unnecessarily antagonistic part of him (the teenager part, May would have said) come out. For once, he didn’t want to pretend to be fine when he wasn’t, not even if it made Captain America uncomfortable.
A bit of tardiness was not unusual, but the longer Peter waited, the more anxious and guilty he started to feel. Had Gwen been so hurt by his not attending her show that she’d skipped out on practice entirely? She didn’t seem like the type to take things so seriously at such an early stage, but Peter was also a complete novice when it came to dating. As he pondered the likelihood of his own jerkiness, he made the mistake of making eye contact with Flash. The other boy wasted no time in realizing that Peter was still without a partner.
Both those strategies were temporarily unavailable to him, however, due to the fact that his head felt like it had been stuffed full with cotton wool. The glacially slow movement from one thought to the next, which had felt like a welcome relief during his scene with Clint, was now a major hindrance. It annoyed him enough that he was unfairly pissed at Clint for making him this way; Tony rejected several of the other man’s subtle, reassuring touches, and refused outright Clint’s multiple attempts to bring the discussion temporarily around to dinner. Finally, Clint got frustrated enough that he rose from his place on the couch next to Tony and stalked out of the room. Pepper followed his angry path through the house with an uneasy expression.
“Permission to interact with you as a Dominant?” The second Tony had even begun to nod, Phil was right up in his space, reaching a hand out to touch his cheek with a terrible kind of gentleness. The first tender touch after a fight had always been overwhelming for Tony, like his body had to fight to re-accustom itself to the absence of violence every time. “The request you just made of me took maturity and bravery, Tony. I am incredibly impressed.” Reflexively, Tony shook his head, tried to evade the kind touch and the even softer words. Coulson’s thumb pressed down insistently against his cheekbone; it nowhere near painful, but enough that his message was clear.
When Bucky and Steve had explained their idea for the playroom decorating scheme, however, she had known pretty much instantly what she wanted to add. She’d resisted the idea for a while, frightened both by the intimacy of it, of how much it would lay bare. But Steve had already caught her crafting a box for a collar they hadn’t even given Tony yet; it wasn’t like she had a whole lot of mystery left where Tony was concerned.
“Am I allowed to ask what kind of assessments?” Bruce cocked his head, considering.
“Doesn’t SHIELD take care of that, the legal stuff?”
“Sure. That’s the one with Hugh Grant as Prime Minister, right?” May had hit him on the arm and made a sound that resembled both a laugh and a sob. It was a contradictory and ridiculous noise, and for the span of a few thudding heartbeats Peter wanted to beg her not to go. She had been the closest thing he’d ever had to a true constant, and the thought of losing her now felt like falling through the sky the day of Thanos’ first invasion, but without the knowledge that Tony—or anyone—would catch him. (If this is what real adulting was supposed to feel like, then he was pretty sure his generation was actually under-stating how shitty it really was.)
“Yeah, buddy, it’s me.”
Stunned that someone at SHIELD had a sense of humour, and a youthful one at that, Peter allowed his attention to be drawn back to the screen. He was just in time to witness the hand of the speaker, a girl wearing a long blue costume with a yellow lightning bolt on the front, grow massive. She raised it and brought it down above a scrap of a girl in shorts and a blue shirt bearing a white star. Incredibly, the latter wasn’t immediately crushed. She met the giant hand with nothing but a high kick, which somehow managed to knock it backward.
The next day, Steve cornered Natasha in a conference room at SHIELD HQ after a briefing. She was his second, and incredibly adept at reading other people, whether strangers or those closest to her. Natasha was his last and best shot, a fact which she proved by not even needing to ask why he’d asked her to stay behind.
“The majority of the mistakes you make all come back to the fact that you think some truly horrifying and entirely untrue things about yourself. I know that’s been true for a long time, I know it probably doesn’t feel like a pattern that it’s even possible to break, but hear me when I tell you that we will do whatever—”
Eventually, when he felt somehow both near sleep and intensely awake, Tony was rolled onto his back. The position wasn’t a simple mirror of how he had been on his front; he lay with his back against Clint, inclined upward enough that he could watch with hooded eyes as Thor and Phil slid a pillow under his hips, then another under each of his knees after they spread them and pulled them into a slight bend. He whined lazily at the latter, which caused Clint to chuckle in his hear.
“Got a plan here, Stevie?”
The anticipation he felt related specifically to Tony, though, was so intense and had taken such a long time to unfold that it was starting to become a paralytic rather than a motivator. Steve didn’t realize it had gotten quite so bad until that morning. He had started to clean off the surface of the island in his kitchen, speculating that perhaps he and Tony would end up on his floor rather than the penthouse once their date had ended. (The penthouse was for all intents and purposes a common level now, and then team would have absolutely no shame about waiting for Steve and Tony to come back from the gala.)
“No, Ms. Parker. My name is Tony Stark—which I know you’re not going to believe, and I can give you any kind of proof you need later. But I wanted to let you know that Peter is here, and that he’s safe.” The quiet sound of a bell chiming preceded the loss of almost all of the other ambient noise; she seemed to have stepped inside a shop or something, which meant that there was no distracting from how absolutely lethal May sounded when she demanded,
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah. He did. And if you need to be pissed at him forever about leaving you then that’s your business, kid. I’m not going to try to convince you otherwise, and I won’t let Tony do it either.” He pauses just long enough that AI-Tony could speak if he wanted. He doesn’t. “What I do know is that he loved you. As much as he was able, in ways that weren’t always healthy or fair, Tony loved you. Tony was also raised by a man who was broken the entirety of his child’s life, and he very nearly took Tony down with him. And whether you agree with his choice or not, I think he truly believed—believes, wherever he is—that the best way he could love you now was to be healthy and whole somewhere else rather than broken with you.”
So it made sense, in a way, that Bruce was the one to start nudging gently at the thick, heavy walls Tony had put around himself, keeping almost every one of the other team members at a safe distance. And it started harmlessly enough. Natasha had been offering Phil, who had come up a bit since the afternoon but was still not quite at baseline (at least from what Tony could tell) bites of pasta off her own plate, while Rhodey scooped a heaping serving onto Pepper’s plate, ignoring her half-hearted protestations.
that’s not a challenge for you,” Clint complained as he made a beeline for a table set up with a host of food and hydration options. The neurotic level of organization of said roughage practically screamed Coulson, and Tony was unsurprised to find the man himself seated behind the table like a parent at a bakesale—except for the fact that he was in a suit bespoke enough to be confused for one of Tony’s less expensive pieces, and taking notes on a tablet while shooting Clint that dry, bemused stare.
The gym, Tony realized with a start strong enough to temporarily derail his train of resentment and bitterness, was moving. The entire room was resetting itself. The obstacle course had vanished, leaving the space ominously bare. The soft padding of the walls was replaced by a secondary reinforcement wall; it hit the ground with a thud so loud that Tony could tell without bothering to inspect the thing that it was adamantium, which—well, the only place Tony himself had ever bothered to reinforce to that degree was...
“Don’t debase both of us further by lying,” Thor snapped, hurt and anger at Steve rather than at himself colouring his tone for the first time. Steve pressed a soothing kiss to the back of his neck, then turned it into just enough of a bite to ensure he had Thor's full attention.
“I believe you’ll find that DUM-E’s protocols allow him to intervene in cases where he witnesses any resident of the Tower engaging in behaviours classified as self-harm.” JARVIS had ‘helpfully’ pulled up the relevant lines of code on the nearest screen to Tony. He spared a second for wondering when and how those conditions had been added, before swiping the data away with an impatient flick of his wrist.
“I’m sure you handled it beautifully, Tony. I’m just sorry you had to. You can go get some rest in your own bed now. One of us will handle Steve from here.”
“We went over safewords. They were one of the first things we—”
“The shrink. She’s threatening to bench me from active service if I don’t start seeing some kind of—professional. To handle the sub-dep.” She spat the last word like it was something horrible and dirty and shameful, and for a long moment Steve wondered if he would make it out of this conversation with his own dignity in tact. Because Talia was just….so very, very much like Tony. Clever, brave, and deeply, uncontrollably angry at what felt like a betrayal from her own body. It had taken Tony years to come to terms with his need for submission; even now Steve couldn’t say for sure if he’d ever truly embraced it. From the best anyone could piece together, Talia had been resisting her orientation for nearly a decade; she’d spent most of her adult life in some degree of sub-dep, struggling to keep a steady job because of mandatory wellness programs much like SHIELD’s. She didn’t identify as trans-oriented, she just (like Tony, though for different reasons) had a deep and profound hatred for the things her body and mind required to stay healthy.
“Tony.”
Ah yes. The team does spend a rather disturbing amount of time on this topic. Perhaps I should show you, as they tend to get a bit sloppy for my taste.
May, after an almost reflexive laugh at the absurdity of meeting someone from another universe, had remained quiet and unreadable through Tony’s entire explanation.
“WHAT?” at increasingly loud volumes. Natasha didn’t even pause before breaking into a series of hand gestures that even Tony’s relatively untrained eye could recognize as fluent sign language, and their bickering formed a relatively amusing spoken and gestural accompaniment to the meal.
Steven Rogers, of course, sits at a classification of 10.
Steve hummed in wordless agreement. Nice, he thought, was rather understating it.
Though Steve continued to reject all of the junior agent’s attempts to pry into his personal life, the flight was still faster and more pleasant than he would have anticipated. It was a relief to be around someone who had no affiliation with the Avengers, someone who neither knew nor cared what was going on in the Tower. Usually he appreciated the way that the team was so utterly encompassing. At the beginning when he’d had nothing else he had welcomed the way their strong personalities and wide mix of needs, preferences, and interests formed a such an enveloping web around themselves. Team, family, friends—they sustained one another in every possible way; Steve could, and often had, gone days without leaving the Tower or speaking to anyone else except for his morning runs. (It had been another reason he and Tony had struggled with one another at first; of all of them, Tony had had the richest and most involved life outside of the Avengers, and Steve had come to realize that he had initially feared and resented that, frightened to need to Tony in ways that he didn’t seem able or willing to reciprocate.) But when the team was under stress from within, that same pleasantly overwhelming quality could morph into something else entirely, a suffocating and paralyzing thing that only heightened Steve’s tendencies to dwell and obsess.
Tony Stark (not
They shared several plates of rice cakes to start, catching one another up on their jobs and books they were reading and other facets of their daily lives. While Steve been worried it might upset him, Bucky had particularly great insights about the cross-training program at SHIELD given his experiences with HYDRA; he also offered to speak to any of the bureaucrats who were giving Steve a hard time in all his Winter Soldier glory, which was a cathartic image even if Steve would never actually take him up on it. It had been so long since Steve had spent time with the team like this, just talking casually about something other than Tony. It was nice, he realized with a fond smile. (Bucky had always known how to take care of Steve. Even, and sometimes most especially, when Steve didn’t think he needed caring for.)
Thus far during their time with the MCU Tony, the D/s team has chosen to keep scenes fairly limited in scope. However, they absolutely do partake of scenes and sexual encounters as a group. Both the Tower and the Malibu home contain playrooms designed for this purpose, which I will say no more about now since you are fairly likely to encounter them in the near future.
Peter arrives at the Tower early for his lab time with Tony by almost half an hour. This happens with disturbing frequency, because the MTA’s favourite little joke is for the trains to run perfectly only when you’re not in an enormous hurry. Normally, he’s happy to wander Midtown until closer to their meeting. This is always a fraught thing, mainly because money was so tight for so long that wandering past bakeries that charge $13 for a narrow wedge of cheesecake always makes Peter acutely aware of the vast chasm separating him from the likes of Tony Stark.
“I decided it might be time to change that once it became infinitely clear that none of you fools were going to let anyone else treat anything but the most superficial scrapes and bruises. Did yours, did he never…”
Partner and I found a house and are moving in this weekend, so comment replies and #AskStrange responses might be a bit delayed. But they are coming, I swear! Your comments, kudos and questions continue to be a singular delight; I couldn't ask for better readers. Have a wonderful weekend, y'all!
Peter promptly puts the hours he’s just put into the web-fluid alterations to waste by spilling his Red Bull all over them. He tries his best to clean them up, even sacrifices the shirt he’s wearing, one of his only ones without any holes, toward soaking up the worst of the mess. Sam tries to help, and FRIDAY assures him that one of the many protocols she inherited from JARVIS had been an auto-scan of active documents any time there was food or drink nearby. None of this is reassuring.
“…of course. Yes. Please inform the General that I will join her this evening, though I may not be able to stay long.”
He was almost relieved when a blaring alarm brought all of his thoughts to a sudden halt.
“You take out your own garbage?” Tony blurted. He knew that Pepper eschewed many of the protections and luxuries that came with being a Fortune 500 CEO, but when Tony found whichever member of her security team was allowing her to take her garbage out to the bins, there were going to be words. Many words. Meanwhile, Pepper glared and opened the drawer to his desk, likely to find something to fling at Tony. When she found only a single pillow, the glare went from semi-annoyed to downright poisonous. “Oh come on, I’ve never been able to get stuff done in spaces like this. All my real work happens down in the shop, you know that.”
“You—every single thing about you—are precisely what we need. We just want to make sure we are what you need too, Anthony. That is our responsibility and our privilege.” Tony seemed so happily overwhelmed by that that Steve expected that to be the end of his active participation in the conversation, but as they all rose to prepare for sleep, he stayed on his knees.
“My best guess is that it has to do with one or both of these things.”
“You can offer pleasure to whomever you’d like, whenever you’d like. It doesn’t even have to be to one of the Dominants that’s actively involved in the scene. But to give it, you have to be willing to accept it in return. Until you are…” She gestured again, this time to a large bench that hadn’t been in the room that morning, at least not unfolded and in the centre of the space as it currently was. In basic function, it looked to be similar to the spanking bench they’d had him on in Malibu. But where that had been a fairly functional piece of furniture, this one practically oozed comfort. That felt like a strange thing to think about something designed for positioning a person to receive pain of one form another, but it was true. The leather looked softer and thicker than the other bench, the padding more substantial. There was nothing metal or harsh; even the buckles on the restraints were covered. They’d had this made for him, he was sure of it, and it definitely hadn’t been cheap. Bruce stood next to the bench, a brown leather riding crop held in his left hand.
Two hours later, Tony swept his way onto Steve’s floor with blustering anger, which was already somewhat undermined by the fact that he was flanked by Dummy on one side and Drama on the other. The t-shirt that he’d taken off into the shop wearing that morning was also covered in some kind of bright and viscous purple fluid that made him rather resemble the dinosaur from a child’s TV show Clint had once made Steve watch. In short, Tony made a thoroughly unintimidating and rather adorable sight, and the fact that he seemed to know it only made him angrier.
“Yessir.”
Oh gosh. I'm nervous to post this, way moreso than usual. Please be kind (you always are, but I feel the need to ask anyway.) And thank you, as always, for your wonderful kudos, comments, and questions.
blamed Clint. He’s been muttering about fire-arrows in his sleep lately. Everyone
“Tell me what you wanted to see, Sir. Please.”
He dialed the number he still remembered by heart before he really had time to consider whether or not it was really a good idea.
“Go get a kneeling pillow from the basket by the fireplace.” Tony’s brain stuttered, and he took a reflexive step back towards the elevator, but Rhodey wasn’t having it. He gave Tony a gentle push towards the living room and pointed to the basket. “Not joking, Tones. The submission ain’t an option, not anymore, and I know that you’re not getting any real peace out of spending time with your Dominants when you're keeping this from them. So until you’re prepared to tell them I’m gonna need to take you in hand a little bit.”
It was the most torturous form of pleasure Tony had ever encountered. He wasn’t entirely a stranger to anal play, but it had been a long time, and certainly he’d never been with anyone who had been interested in doing anything more complex than ramming up against his prostate with a cock or a dildo. Bruce played the thing with even more competence than he’d bragged about. With that same deceptively light touch he built up a slow, maddening rhythm, and once he found it, Bruce never varied. He never altered his pace, or modified the pressure, or changed his angle even a degree. The closest he came to any variation was when he occasionally allowed his fingernails scrape at Tony through the gloves, which never failed to send shockwaves all the way through him.
Tony opened his mouth to deny this, then shut it again as he remembered how it had felt when Bruce had hand-fed him that very first day, and his first secretive experiments with kneeling on his own.
Now, see, that one wouldn’t seem all that unusual except for the fact that you had just spent two pages describing in detail everything Clint did to take down a group of similar size a few floors down. Why the absent agent again, and the strange lack of detail about what actually happened?” The fact that Tony heard pages rustling instead of seeing them was the only thing that made him realize he’d closed his eyes at some point during this interrogation. He kept them screwed shut as Phil continued reading. “Ah, yes, this one is my favourite.
Tony wasn’t sure if that thought, the idea of being known and seen that way, was more disquieting or arousing. He was, however, willing to find out, so he stood and stripped off, though without making the kind of display of it he might normally have done. Clint still nodded his approval, raking his eyes over every inch of Tony with a leisurely kind of arrogance, like it was his right. Unsure if he was supposed to sit without invitation, Tony withstood the inspection as long as he could. Just when he was considering making a break for the couch without permission, Clint gestured to the spot next to him.
“Because we are not leavin’ you, you stubborn bastard. I know you’n me, things haven’t been quite the same since I got back. I know I’m not who I was, and that’s hard for you sometimes.”
“Why does it matter if I remember the good things? Doesn’t everyone? It’s not like there’s a point in picking a fight with someone who…who’s dead.” Domen made a quiet humming sound that Steve had learned meant she was really considering her answer; that felt reassuring, the fact that she was at least taking his concerns seriously and putting thought into her answers.
“It’s partly a power thing, of course. A way for you to start to get into the right headspace for a scene. I also like my subs naked whenever possible because I read people’s body language for a living. You’ll tell me just as much with what makes you tense up, or cringe, or shudder, or get hard as you will with the words you use. Sometimes more if you’re being recalcitrant.”
“Hey, does Sam ever come around? Sam Wilson?”
“Try me,” Tony taunted, though Steve suspected that needling covered up something kinder, something Tony seemed to realize Bucky wouldn’t accept.
“If this is another ‘I was right’ speech—”
“But I thought—I mean, aren’t you—”
*****
“I’m already barely able to let myself go down for you. If we keep talking about this I’m going to take myself right out of headspace. Let’s go get this Dep under control and then we can sort through the rest of it. Idiot.” Steve’s hand tightened on the leash, even the insult Phil had added not enough to distract his instincts which had suddenly become aware that he was in close proximity to a willing submissive. Phil stumbled forward slightly, but caught himself and took several more steps until he was situated between Steve’s open legs.
Ah, yes, the Stark children. Or as I like to think of them, the sources of my eternal headache.
Except that when Tony opened the book, it barely looked like Howard Stark’s machine-precise handwriting. It was messy and frantic, the letters smudging and running into one another and drifting suddenly off the lines. Howard did many things drunk, but keeping written records wasn’t usually one of them. There was something different about this book. Tony knew that before he realized that the messy sketch on the first page was of a uterus.
Whatever the case, Tony appeared to be entirely on his own, which was probably why he was seated not on a chair, but on the island that dominated the centre of the kitchen. His legs dangled loosely off the edge, and he looked, there was no other way to say it, thoroughly well-fucked. His hair was mussed in that way it only got when Tony had spent a lot of time writhing against a pillow, his bottom lip was swollen and raw from where he’d bitten it, and he wiggled in place every few seconds as if unable to comfortably remain still. Having a sight to accompany the passionate soundtrack he’d heard the day before was more temptation than Steve had anticipated when he’d chosen to venture into the penthouse, but he was still confident that he’d be able to make it through. (Even if Tony was wearing Steve’s sweater. Again. Still. Had he been wearing it when he’d touched himself the day before?)
Now, I don’t wish to speculate about the cause of the omission, mainly because forcing myself to identify with Stark is simply undesirable. However, I would note that Stark’s reaction to learning about the diverging fate of the Ultron program in this universe may be relevant and worth considering.
you and not the other you—”
Oh great. It always went so well for Natasha when disembodied voices used her full name.
As always, your comments and kudos are so valued, and are a huge source of motivation and excitement. (And you can, of course, #AskStrange about any outstanding questions you might have, too!)
“No?”
“Did I do something to piss you off? Because if I did, it’s really not cool to take it out on me professionally. It’s something the other version of my team might have done, but I’d kind of stopped expecting it from you lot.”
“Of course, it’s not like he’s the only one who might be worthy. That thing you did, Stark, speaking out against your Dad and giving us the information from that study he commissioned? That could change a lot of lives for the better, man.”
“S’just…it’s like, my head’s a machine that needed maintenance for so long that I didn’t even notice how much gunk had built up in the systems, slowing down all the processes, bugging up all the programs, because it was so gradual, right? But now it’s all gone, it’s clear and everything is running at peak efficiency, and it’s so good Bruce, so fucking good to be fixed.”
hurt, to realize the ways in which HYDRA’s influence had permanently altered who he had been.)
Thank you for your understanding and support of myself and the rough last chapter! This one should  be a little more polished, though knowing me there may still be some errors.
“I’m not entirely sure that’s true.” Natasha had positioned herself so that most of her face and body were masked by shadows created by the dim lighting and setting sun. She hasn’t used those kinds of tactics to hide from them in ages, but even for her this was not bound to be an uncontroversial statement and she undoubtedly knew it. “Even leaving aside his response to the hand feeding, I’m fairly certain he’s been practicing kneeling. The pillow keeps moving a few inches here and there every couple of days. He was limping with no known cause the other morning and avoided answering questions about the reason, and he blushes every time he looks anywhere near that corner of the room.” There was another noise that Steve wasn’t sure didn’t originate from him, at least not until he saw Clint put a hand on Phil’s shoulder and murmur something that Steve couldn’t quite hear.
This is a fascinating question, and one that Barnes himself is very much still attempting to work out. In lieu of a definitive answer, I can offer instead a brief view into one of his more recent conversations with his therapist.
“…what?” He heard Tony perfectly well, and if the other man weren’t drunk off his ass he’d undoubtedly skewer Steve for making him do something so inefficient as repeat himself. But how the hell was Steve supposed to begin to answer this question?
“You,” he concluded after pondering the options for a few seconds. Steve chuckled and Tony realized how vacuous that probably sounded. “No, not…I mean, I liked how you were—you were like this perfect mix of firm and kind. It made me, I didn’t feel quite as—I don’t know, taken over by the submission as I sometimes do, because you made me help put myself there, so I was more conscious of it happening. And that was really embarrassing but it also felt really—um, good.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I hate you,” he muttered petulantly. He heard the smile in Natasha’s voice when she answered,
“I need a job.” Phil’s eyebrows rose slightly, betraying his surprise. And to be fair, it was a slightly humiliating thing to admit, but Tony could see no other way forward. The Avengers (plus Pepper and Rhodey, neither of whom could risk having their work connected to Tony until he came out) were the only ones who knew Tony was here. If he was going to fill his days with something, they were the only ones who could help. Tony shivered again—was the heating in the whole damn Tower malfunctioning?—and laid it all out as plainly as he could.
“He told me he was terrified. That a threat greater than we’d ever faced was imminent, that New York hadn’t been an accident or a one-off. He told me he’d watched me, all of us, die after I told him he could have done more.” Maybe Steve shouldn't have said what he did next; the answer was already evident in the heavy weight of Tony’s silence. But he asked anyway, because he had to know this wasn’t another in a series of horrible misunderstandings. “Did you tell your Steve those things, Tony? Did he ask?” Tony snorted; a ruffling noise followed by a warning from JARVIS seemed to indicate he had gotten, rather unsteadily, to his feet.
The issue of Iron Man is also one that Coulson is interested in trying to tease out. D/s Tony had begun speaking of retirement, but also showed little inclination to actually stop serving as Iron Man alongside the rest of his team. MCU Tony, meanwhile, has yet to repair his suit, something that Coulson suspects but has not yet confirmed.
"And it went badly?” Phil guessed.
The world reacts to the Avengers' press conference, and Tony sends word to the MCU.
Bruce abandoned his steady exploration of Tony’s chest to massage the growing tension at Tony’s neck and shoulders.
Though usually much less predictable about timing, the rest of the team had already been gathered in the expansive living room for forty-five minutes, ostensibly to have breakfast together, but mostly because none of them wanted to miss it if Tony happened to arrive early. By silent consensus, they’d agreed not to acknowledge their own absurdity, which at least meant no one (Clint) ended up throwing food at anyone else (Thor.) Poisoning attempts (Natasha) were also thankfully absent thus far, though Steve had definitely planned to stop accepting any food or drink from her should Tony end up late for any reason.
Had anyone but Steve asked, Coulson was sure the AI would have played it off, pretending (as Tony sometimes did) that he was incapable of being deeply affected by anything. After the two had finally reconciled following Tony’s death, however, JARVIS had vowed never to lie to Steve again if he could help it, and it was a promise he took extremely seriously.
As always, feel free to let me know if you have questions or concerns before reading!
Tony he was speaking of. But Tony could hardly even pretend to keep his gaze averted after that, which meant that he met Natasha’s weighty stare head-on as she answered in a near-whisper.
Steve thought of every time he’d seen the other Tony after a mission that had involved children going wrong. Tony never took his own perceived failures well, but with kids…well, Wanda had known precisely what she was doing when she’d fabricated a child for Tony to save. Losing kids he hadn’t even known had nearly destroyed Tony every time; he would drink for days, or try to goad the nearest person into a violent round of fighting or fucking. Even once their relationship had matured and stabilized, those occasions had always been the ones where Steve had most feared they might lose Tony.
“Rhodey’s waiting downstairs. Get dressed.”
Natasha’s face wasn’t giving anything away, but getting a better look at the knife in her hand did. It was perfectly-sharpened and immaculate the way all Natasha’s blades were, but it didn’t look like anything he’d ever seen her wield before. The tip wasn’t a sharp point in the middle of the blade, but rather aligned almost perfectly with the cutting edge. The shape of the handle, too, would have been incompatible with the kinds of holsters Natasha most preferred. And the design was all wrong for Natasha; the handle was too ornate, too delicate for the kinds of ops where Natasha tended to prefer knives over her Bites.
Ah, yes. I wondered if this might come up. (I’m also impressed that you know enough of the former Stark to be so confident, and correctly so, that he did not always manage to use safe words when necessary.)
This proved to be a more challenging instruction than Tony would have guessed. He was immediately confronted with the purple kneeling pillow, nestled invitingly in the corner, but he still felt oddly reluctant to give away how much kneeling had already come to mean to him when things were just starting out. But if not there, then where? A chair might make Clint think he was avoiding the option of being touched, but the couch might make it seem like Tony was pushing himself on Clint…He stood motionless in the centre of the room until an amused huff sounded from behind him, where Clint stood holding two bottles of water and a small black duffle bag that he must have come up with.
“But you do not believe it to be a hopeless cause?” Thor wanted to know.
manage to tug them over his saggiest parts, the pants suggested Phony must have had a pretty spectacular ass. Enough of Tony’s life was going to involve constantly being measured against that bastard and found wanting, dammit, his ass was not going to be included on that list.)
“Glad to see they were unsuccessful, Ms. Potts. Now pull up the memo you were talking about and let’s get to work.”
“Not really,” he said honestly. Phil chuckled.
“It is no bother,” Thor chuckled. He helped Steve rearrange Tony on his back, a pillow under his hips, and then fed him his cock slowly, letting Tony adjust both to the new angle and to Thor’s size. Tony’s own cock visibly spasmed, a prelude to an orgasm he wasn’t permitted to have yet, and Steve chuckled.
“Sorry, but despite the rumours that might be floating around, I’m not actually a mind-reader. I can give you a couple of suppositions and a recommendation, but that’s my best offer.”
“See, now you sound like him. Go with that,” Clint advised. Thor nodded in agreement, but Phil shook his head.
“Mr. Stark?”
Tony remembered with a shiver that went all the way through him hearing the others talk about Bruce’s crop with something close to reverence. Even the switches that didn’t often need or want pain spoke in hushed tones about the experience. He’d planned to ask Bruce for a demonstration before they’d left the Malibu house, but they’d run out of time, and maybe Tony had been slightly intimidated by the idea of something that could make even Natasha speak in a voice just above a whisper. And now it was finally being offered up as the answer to a pleasure he wasn’t ready to accept. (He wondered how they’d known, how they always seemed to know.)
“Mmm. How good it is to see you this happy, mostly. And wondering if you want to finally go on that date we’ve been talking about. Pepper mentioned there’s a benefit coming up, the Maria Stark Foundation?” Tony stiffened in his arms, just for a matter of seconds, but it was enough to rouse Steve’s slumbering protective instincts. “What is it?” Tony shook his head and aimed another kiss at Steve’s neck, just under his ear. But Steve had learned tricks of his own by now.
, “to get you there.” Far from hating the bench now, Tony knew with absolute certainty its forced structure was the only thing stopping him from collapsing in a heap. The cuffs and straps didn’t feel like restraints anymore, they were holding Tony steady, helping him stay good for his Dominants. “Buck, you want to take this home?”
That had been their protocol way back in the beginning. When Bucky had been terrified that he would spin out of control, forget himself and start harming innocent people at any moment, he’d asked for Steve to receive detailed updates about his sessions so that he could be on watch. The loss of privacy had been well worth the assurance that someone with the ability to actually take Bucky down if necessary knew what was going on with him.
Morning found Thor still in rope, though the set-up was much simpler this time: just a chest harness and a cock ring. But Thor had already been lingering enough in subspace that the small push was really all he’d needed to go back under entirely. Steve hadn’t entirely planned on that one, he’d intended the harness as a kind of transitional system to move them towards aftercare. But for the first time in ages, he didn’t find himself in any particular rush to end the scene, so Steve surveyed his submissive with an almost lazy pleasure.
“He did.” Tony thought about leaving it there. Steve might be uncharacteristically focused right now, perhaps in an attempt to make up for having so massively derailed their earlier conversation with mind-blowing sex, but he would leave it alone if Tony clearly indicated this wasn’t a conversation he wished to be having. “SWORD is big picture stuff, about as big as it gets. It’s trying to protect the whole damn galaxy from anything else that might be coming. And that’s important, but…God, I thought of nothing but big picture stuff for years. I’m kind of happy about the idea of keeping my feet a little more on the ground, focusing on solving some of the problems here, you know?” Steve was silent for long enough in the face of these complaints that Tony wanted to burrow back through the bedsheets and maybe into a vortex of some kind.
“I…I told him he would talk about expanding the dynamic soon, but then I got hurt, and it kind of went on the backburner,” Clint said.
No, he needed a gesture, something that Tony would instantly understand, that could convey the depth and severity of Steve’s regret. He took several long strides, coming to rest a foot in front of Tony. And then he sank, in a single, fluid motion, to his knees. It was an old-fashioned move, just like Steve himself. Dominants nowadays tended to avoid even the most glancing reminder of power dynamics during or immediately following arguments. And most of the time it made sense; it avoided exactly what had happened that morning, with Steve unintentionally abusing his power over a submissive because of his own anger.
“Even if I wanted to ‘get off my ass’” Natasha’s imitation of Steve was not a kind one, “there’s nowhere to go. I’m not running or involved in any active ops at SHIELD, all is quiet on the Avengers front, and did I mention I don’t feel like it?” There was murmured agreement from several other members of the team, including Bucky who had been Steve’s ally and defender these past couple of days. Alright then, it was time to take action.
There's also a mention of a past consensual punishment scene between D/s Steve and D/s Tony. The scene itself is not depicted directly (though it'll probably show up as a one-shot someday if anyone is interested), but Steve hints that he was somewhat reluctant to deliver said punishment and did so because Tony explicitly and repeatedly requested it as a way to force him to discuss a difficult topic. If this is a trigger or something you want to avoid, skip the paragraph that begins "How much could he reasonably be expected to tell Tony?"
Those of you keeping up with Dr. Strange's responses to questions will already know the background that Steve will be thinking about regarding Sam Wilson, but a warning for those who haven't: it concerns mentions of harassment based both on race and orientation. (If you want to skip this, stop reading at the paragraph that begins "And then Tony had died..." and pick it up two paragraphs later, the paragraph beginning "You're really not the best friends, are you?"
This bit of tidying should have taken roughly five minutes, maybe seven if he used that special spray the cleaners had told him they used to help keep the granite surfaces of the kitchen gleaming and spotless. Except as he’d been doing that, Steve had spotted a bit of dust on the top of the fridge. And sure it was unlikely that Tony would be inspecting that particular area, but Steve would know it was there, wouldn’t he? Even if they did spend the majority of their time in the penthouse, Steve wanted to be proud of his space, and for Tony to enjoy spending time here.
“But I
But for the other Tony, the daily practices—the rituals, the boundaries, the guidance—they had been just as meaningful, maybe moreso, than the other aspects of his submission. This Tony might not be working with the biological imperatives, but from everything Steve knew of the man there was a good chance he felt utterly adrift without any integration of that newly-discovered side of himself into the rest of his life.
Steve had no desire to ever interfere in or dictate the terms of Tony’s relationship with Peter, but he also wanted to ensure that his partner had enough time to make a decision that he wouldn't come to regret. So he said the first thing that came to mind (which was the first thing his own Ma, or Bucky’s, would have said.)
“When?”
(They would be alright. They had to be.)
,” Bruce cut in, rising to his feet. He might be trying to exude a semi-neutral position. But even Tony, who was maybe less attuned to the signs than any of the rest of them, could feel how badly Bruce wanted, maybe even needed, whatever was coming. Even if Tony hadn’t been interested for his own sake, he didn’t think his submissive side would ever be okay with not giving his Dominant something he clearly desired so much. “I know that most of today hasn’t been negotiated in advance, but there are some things we don’t feel comfortable not discussing with you beforehand. The first is that we had intended to play around with pain, which we haven’t done since getting back from Malibu.”
He wasn’t entirely sure what he expected to greet him when he stepped out. Phil naked and on his knees, perhaps, or ready to present Steve with any number of tools suitable for a highly intense scene. All of them involved an interaction between a submissive and a Dominant, because Steve was a True, and that was how everyone always thought to bring him comfort.
“Any other pain I should know about, related to the scene or not?”
“You make everyone, including me,
“He didn’t ever talk about it, so this is just me extrapolating from bits and pieces of ranting over the years. Take it for what it’s worth. But I’m pretty sure Tony had feelings for you. He was probably tempted to come back to you as much as to anyone else. Just like Peter, you’re welcome to continue being pissed off that he didn’t. To be honest, I really don’t care. But whatever relationship you end up having with his memory, you need to decide right now to stop letting it interfere with your relationship with his kid. You made a commitment to him, Rogers. My Mom, she used to say family isn’t a one time thing. It’s a choice you make and then you keep making every single day. To put someone else first, above everyone and everything else. It’s damn hard work. Tony was a genius at this age too and I practically raised him, so believe me when I tell you it’d be a full time job even without all the freaky spider stuff.”
“Tony thought he might want to play tonight,” Clint announced lazily, picking up a strip of leather from on top of the dresser and tossing it between his hands. “More specifically, Tony was wondering if Thor would have any interest in being a guinea pig for Tony to learn something about bondage from the Dominant side of things.”
“Five tools. Name five tools in this room, Tony, now.” The command was clear and beautiful and Tony’s brain, so much closer to a panic attack than he’d realized, latched onto it like a lifeline. He didn’t really need to cast his eyes around the room to catalogue its contents, but he remembered enough from the few sessions of therapy he’d been forced to attend to recognize that this was less about accuracy and more about grounding himself in the material present. He focused on the bench near the back, the only one that didn’t seem to have been cleared off in the wake of the other Tony’s death.
“The General anticipated you might decline her invitation, and asked that I remind you of the time-sensitive documents you requested that the two of you review together.” Steve drew a blank for a long few seconds (another bad sign, cognitive processes starting to slow down), then nearly smacked his hand to his forehead in a gesture belonging far more to his 40s self than his current status. Masdee and Talia’s contract.
Now, yes, watching both Steve and Phil at their most strategic and hyper-competent had led to a brief but intense make-out session in one of the utility closets once the op was complete. (So sue Tony. He was newly collared and engaged to boot, and he was going to take full advantage of that high for as long as possible.) But even aside from the effect the whole thing had had on Tony’s libido, it had also been illuminating to be reminded that these were more than just his partners. The majority of the Avengers worked for SHIELD in one capacity for another; they were accountable to other people, other organizations, and Tony hadn’t had to drag them kicking and screaming into it, either. They did it because they truly believed in something larger than themselves.
“Only if you tell me if you’ve really made a breakthrough with nanotech. I’ve heard rumours about improvements to the suit, but you haven’t made any public statements, and Captain Hardass has some annoyingly strict rules about revealing anything to do with you that you haven’t already said yourself. I ask you, what is the point of knowing the boss when you still don’t get any of the good gossip?”
After a confusing morning, Tony retreats to the safest spot in the Tower. Steve attempts an apology.
“Something wrong?” Tony asked, perceptive as ever.
As you might be able to predict based on my last answer, yes there certainly members of the D/s universe who abstain from sex, either for religious reasons, or simply because they are asexual. Asexuality, while analogous in some ways, is distinct from those in the D/s universe who refer to themselves as un-oriented; for that population, it is their classification according to the Orientation Classification System that does not align with their own self-identification. They may or may not enjoy sex if it is removed from orientational practices.
“Gonna last long enough to actually let him tie you, buddy?” Clint teased, sprawling out on the large bed next to Natasha. Thor whined.
,” she rolled her eyes, “but they knew and I knew that if we took the contracts and the terms were violated it would be decades worth of legal battles to get those products off the market again. That would harm the company and give the Board a legitimate case to argue I was negatively impacting their bottom line”
“So you’re not losing your shit about the date.”
“Steve, you are not being set adrift. I would only ever be a phone call away. And I already have a colleague I think would be perfect to take over your care. If you give me permission, we can start the transfer pretty much immediately. It might take a few extra days because of the additional rounds of screening and legal documentation he’ll need to fill out, but you would probably still be able to get in for a first meeting by late next week if you wanted.”
“Here’s fine,” Tony insisted, because it was fine, there was no room for shame or embarrassment or anything negative, not now. There was a few seconds of silence, and that was good too; without anxiety creeping its way in Tony didn’t mind giving his Dominant the time he needed to think.
“He’ll need aftercare obviously, but there are no wounds or injuries requiring attention. If you want to be extra cautious maybe start off with a bath; throw some Epsom salt in it, and be extra thorough washing him and he’ll be all set. What else do you need this morning, Steve? How’s the drop?”
) until he was sure the boy was asleep. It didn’t take all that long; Peter had clearly been exhausted long before the emotional upheaval of being kicked out of his apartment, and that was outweighing whatever weirdness he must have been feeling about sleeping in an unfamiliar place. At least in sleep Peter looked like a kid, starfished on his belly with one leg under the covers and the other on top. He was hugging his pillow, too, in a way that gave Tony the bizarre urge to get him some kind of stuffed animal, even though that would be way age-inappropriate and probably freak the kid right the hell out.
It was only his years of training that stopped Steve from visibly wincing. Dynamic interactions in Wakanda functioned differently, especially in the military. While in North America it was strictly illegal for orientation-based communication to become intentionally involved in professional interactions (an attempt to eliminate any potential for workplace abuses), in Wakanda it was perfectly natural for military leadership to use Dominance in their interactions with their subordinates. They found that it encouraged loyalty, troop cohesion, and performance. And this did not mean leadership positions were limited to those classified as Dominants, or lower-level positions to those classified as submissives. Over the years Wakanda had developed methods for cross-training; the biological classification of their troops was never erased, but their practices influenced and enhanced the social aspects of orientation enough that Wakandan soldiers could serve in whatever capacity was required of their position without risking their health. (Trans-oriented activists were thrilled by the program, and eagerly awaited the day when Wakanda would release more information about its specifics.)
“There was a small fire in one of the labs today. Something about a bunch of at-risk kids sneaking but not really sneaking into the Tower, which no one but Pepper and Rhodes knew anything about until today when we all got an unexpected shower?” He snorted, imagining the lot of them running around the Tower trying to figure out why the building’s extremely comprehensive sprinkler system had been set off in the first place.
, because those had just been the items covering him. Now Natasha was stripping away everything, every bit of dust and every city smell and every touch that hadn’t been her own, so that all he could feel was her.
“It’s illegal to shut down Clayton Park for private functions,” Bruce noted, his tone just as carefully neutral as the rest of him. “Access to it is considered an essential public service.”
“JARVIS?”
“But you’ve been before? He, the other Tony, he invited you?” Bruce smiled, that same fond expression tinged with sadness that bringing up Mark II always produced in the team. (Tony wondered if he would have his own version of that look now, whenever someone asked about his old life. It was somehow both sad and weirdly comforting to know how much he and this version of the team would always be bound by their intimate familiarity with loss.)
“Don't worry about it, Big Guy. Intimate situation for you, literal apocalyptic-level dry spell for me, it happens. Doesn’t have to mean anything.”
“Oh my God yes. Ooh, or concern troll—except he’s a real troll!”
Tony manages disagreements, both professional and personal, and meets a friend of Steve's.
“Good boy. And yes, to answer your whine, we’re going for a run after breakfast.”
“Shh! And yes, it talks. That’s the AI that Tony installed.” While Ned was moaning in wordless glee at this development, Peter gave in to the somewhat reckless urge to take a picture. The scene was ridiculous, the sleek brightness of the mask clashing horribly with Ned’s robot pyjama pants and his worn Nintendo shirt. But he couldn’t not have a record of this moment, when the two parts of his life that had once felt irreconcilable were coming together with such easy joy. Far from being offended, Ned started mugging it up for the camera. He pretended to shoot webs from his middle fingers, then made a show of pushing his desk chair across the room while pretending it weighed roughly the same as a car. Peter cackled and captured it all, their antics growing steadily more absurd (and loud) until Ned’s Mom called them to the kitchen for breakfast. On a whim, he sent one of the images to Tony. He captioned and deleted and re-captioned the picture several times before deciding to send it without commentary, but Tony seemed to recognize it for the ‘thank you’ it was all the same.
Tony’s mind and body were both at war with themselves. By the time Clint’s little speech was finished his cock was half-hard, rising as if to seek out more of Clint’s razor-edged voice and his calloused hands and his keen regard that saw so much and gave away so little. This was every fantasy he’d had about Clint over the past few days come to life and turned up to eleven. But it was also terrifying. Tony wasn’t even bound down to anything yet; Clint had really not done any more than talk, and Tony felt more exposed than he’d ever been. His hands fell to his sides, gripping at the sheets in tight fists.
“Why the hell not?” Tony spat.
up, he definitely would have worn the boots with the lifts if he’d known who he was going to be dealing with today) and put a hand on that big green bicep.
Bucky calls up a holographic shooting range and gun. It would look a little goofy to watch him, crouched down in sniper pose with an imaginary gun on his shoulder, if his accuracy weren’t so damn terrifying. He is closer to the man who ripped the steering wheel out of Sam’s car than he has been in a long while.
The promise of access to a computer or a phone was a tempting one, but some part of Tony wanted to do this as Phil clearly preferred; he maybe even liked the idea of Phil gathering up the things Tony wrote at the end of the sessions, placing them in a dedicated folder with the same kind of care he would give highly-classified intel. There was just one problem.
“I’m going to get you changed back into something more comfortable. Is that okay, sweetheart?” (Fuck. His Pep had never gone in for nicknames, not even when they were together. Even though he knew there was no romantic future for himself and this version of her, he wanted to fold himself inside that naked affection in her tone and never, ever come out again.) He swallowed around the lump in his throat and nodded, sitting passively as she raised his arms and unzipped the SI hoodie, replacing it with an oversized sweater his other self must have lifted from Rhodey (though it felt differently shaped than his Rhodey-handoffs.) The pants followed; Pepper encouraged him to lie back on the bed, slid off his sweats and replaced them with a pair of soft gingham pyjama pants. Then she’d crawled into the bed, positioning herself behind him so that when he slid up toward the headboard he could rest his head against her chest and let her wrap all her limbs around him like an octopus. It was an encompassing, nearly-suffocating hold, and the only force in the world that felt capable of grounding him right at that moment.
“Is-I mean, you’re the team’s handler, can’t you overrule him? Tell him to stop being such a stubborn prick?” Tony didn’t care if he was overreaching, didn’t even really give a damn about the org chart. Being entirely cut off from the team when the last thing he’d heard was that Steve was
“Okay, well good to have an unambiguous sense of where you’re at. Now, I brought that up in advance partly because Bucky is going to be taking part in the scene. He’s not one hundred percent certain he’s ready even to be Domming alongside someone who’s hurting you. For today we’d prefer he didn’t have to leave, so the plan is for us to switch over to something else if that becomes necessary.”
HOWARD STARK’S TAINTED LEGACY: BIGOTRY, LIES, AND THE SON WHO TOLD THE WORLD
.” This drew a harsh, bitter laugh which never should have emerged from someone as young as Peter. Steve winced.
“Not that I know of,” Tony assured him, unable to stop himself from reaching out to squeeze Steve’s hand. “I think it’s done with me as long as I don’t mess with it. And I think—well, it’s just a guess, all based on magical bullshit, but I think I wound up here because of the stone. It gave me a chance, somehow, to start over.”
Steve assumed this was some kind of nonsensical allusion to the Clint’s ankle somehow preventing him from disciplining Tony (not that it actually would, but injuries really did bring all the brat out in Clint), at least until there was a chorus of agreement from the others. Pepper frowned, her eyes meeting Steve’s.
(How long had it been since anyone had catered to a simple creature comfort of Tony’s like that, even if it was technically made to other-Tony’s preferences?)
“Option two is a combination of punishment and reward. It skirts right along the edge of what I’ll allow during a check-in, but, well, these are unique circumstances. Have you ever been milked before?” Unable to bother being embarrassed about his lack of experience when he felt like he might actually die from arousal, Tony shook his head. “It is a massage, typically internal, of the prostate. It is pleasurable for the recipient, intensely so. However, if the person delivering the massage is knowledgeable and experienced enough, both of which I am, it can result in ejaculation without the full release of an orgasm. This form of milking is often used as a punishment in our communities, because it ensures the continued health of the testicles and seminal vesicles while withholding the full pleasure of an orgasm from the submissive.”
The slightly glazed look on Peter’s face suggested that the boy probably wasn’t taking much of what Tony was even saying in. As soon as the adrenaline of not knowing if his basic needs of housing and food were going to met had vanished, the kid’s body had essentially started to shut down. This was probably for the best, Steve thought. None of what Tony was suggesting was likely to be half as easy as he was making it sound, and it was probably better that he and Peter not have to have that particular battle tonight.
The longer Tony spoke, the more he started to see the holes in the plan. It was probably weird to ask for the wedding, which was ostensibly the only one of the ceremonies not about Dominance and submission at all, to be in a space designed to honour someone who had placed those needs above all others, even her own freedom. Not to mention it would be way more efficient to just do both ceremonies on the same day, and given that Tony was the one forcing them to have two separate ceremonies in the first place, that was probably the least he could do. Steve cleared his throat, cutting through the mental noise in the way only he could.
“No ma’am,” Coulson replied at once, without a hint of irony or even playfulness.
“N-no, no, no,” he whimpered as she slid off of Tony enough to reach down and begin removing the cocking. “You can leave it, it’s okay. I didn’t mean it, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” The cockring was off now, and his cock twitched and dripped into Natasha’s hand.
Proposal and Bibliography (10%)
to get hard and come had his cock twitching in his own palm before long. He groaned, tipping his head back as the lace danced across hyper-sensitive skin. As he continued his slow exploration his knees slid further apart, Tony’s joints for once fully cooperating with his desires; hell, his whole body felt fluid in a way it never had before, like it could just make itself into whatever shape his Dominants wanted. It made Tony feel infinitely powerful and incredibly submissive all at once, and he groaned aloud.
“Good. Now also make sure you understand this: beyond those words, and whatever choices I
“Tell me what you were thinking about. What made you react like that?” Tony said nothing and made a valiant attempt to distract Phil by increasing the suction. Unfortunately, all these efforts got him was tugged all the way off the other man’s cock. “You don’t use sex to hide from me. You don’t hide from me at all. Not like this.” Tony wiped at the spit and pre-come on his chin and looked anywhere but at Phil.
Mark II must just have not gotten around to showing this particular tradition off to Barnes, because the bots definitely knew what Tony was planning. All three let out a long string of celebratory beeps and whistles, and then hastened to clear all extraneous objects from the floor of the shop. As soon as the room was prepared, they made their way back to Tony and Barnes and lined up side-by-side right behind a piece of discoloured concrete that apparently marked the starting line in this universe.
“Carol has a fondness for them she refuses to explain to anyone except Nick. The records were a gift from her to him, in fact, but he left them with me for safe keeping a few years ago.”
“You know, you guys are really good partners—amazing, honestly, I’ve never seen anything like how you are together. But you’re not really the best friends, are you?” Steve blinked, wearing an expression so stunned it would have been funny under any other circumstances. “I just…Pep, Rhodey, Sam, I don’t understand how the same people who fight so hard for each other just let the friendships in their lives fall apart the second things get tough.” Silence so thick it practically coated the room made Tony wince and want to curl into a ball, protect himself from whatever might follow. Then Steve kissed his head and said,
“No apologies are necessary, Captain. My preferences should not be given priority. I simply dislike reviewing evidence of my own failure.”
“I suppose we would both be a disappointment to them now,” he finally said in stiff, stilted Russian. (Once, they had spoken to one another in Natasha’s mother tongue with far more frequency, but it was a rarity now.)
“Yeah. You go, give him the whole ‘Captain America is proud of you son, now come under the well-funded and regulated wing of SHIELD and also eat a sandwich or twelve’ speech. I can design his tech without him ever knowing, stay five degrees removed from anything he so much as breathes on. It’s brilliant.”
“He really is.” Then, because Tony would never be able to entirely restrain himself, he added, “You’re definitely going to come to the Tower so we can get drunk and go over that data soon, right?”
Some of the toys and specific sex acts listed were compelling but kind of terrifying too. The list included everything from cock cages and electro-stimulation to double and triple penetration, which, was that even possible given the kind of absurd size of half the people living in this tower? Trying to imagine that quickly turned into more of an intellectual challenge about physics and geometry than a sexual daydream.
“I—I kept information from you. I almost ended our relationship based on assumptions that weren’t—weren’t accurate, fucking
Bruce was clearly bewildered and a little bit hurt by the outburst, and for a few minutes after that the whole conversation seemed kind of doomed. But Tony hadn’t counted on Thor, whose natural and simple sweet nature was pretty much made for these kind of scenarios.
“Tony—”
—to get to bask in his glory and get old and retire and—
Tony tried not to hold SI’s Board in contempt. He really did. For several of his most irresponsible years his versions of them (and Obie) had been the ones who had kept the company afloat behind the scenes, completing all the work Tony deemed too tedious to bother with.
“Somethin’ wrong?”
involve pants, can someone please fill me in on Maintenance Day?”
He and Thor shared breakfast at a greasy spoon that was too simple and old-fashioned for the trendier members of the team, but which the two of them adored for its massive portion sizes and classic menu. Of course, Thor’s focus was not really on the food today. The rope harness, while completely concealed beneath the other man’s loose fitting thermal, was plainly never far from his mind.
“Steve.” He didn’t want to look at him, he wanted to hide in a cavern somewhere and never be seen again, but Steve’s voice right now was everything he’d ever wanted from the man and had never dared to really expect. When their eyes locked, Steve repeated, “Steve. Not Cap, not Rogers, not anyone else who is not you and I in this room right now. Can we start there?”
“Where do you think you’re going, Stark?”
Time and his forced acceptance of Bucky’s help made everything else slightly more bearable. Steve could see it so clearly now, how foolish he’d been to think things could work out between he and Tony. Tony would always be Iron Man, would always throw himself on every live wire he could find, and Steve simply wouldn’t be able to accept it. And seeing as he wouldn’t dream of trying to separate Tony from Iron Man, the solution was simple: they could never be more than what they were now. It would take time to accept, yes, because even Steve’s therapy had been based around an understanding that he was aiming to eventually be capable of offering Tony more. It might take a few more days to let the sting of disappointment wear off, but it wasn’t like Tony’s friendship was nothing. It was far more than Steve had dreamed he’d have just a few months ago, after all. He could learn to be grateful. To accept what he could have, and stop grasping hopelessly for what he couldn’t.
Natasha, along with most of the rest of the team, was thankfully out of the Tower today. This had left Tony free to venture down to the shop and break into SI’s system. (The firewalls had clearly been changed since Mark II had passed, and while whomever had done the work was good, they just weren’t equal to any version of Tony.) In less than half an hour, he’d located the worst offenders in the attempted coup against Pepper, deactivated their credit cards, alerted two of their wives about extramarital affairs, and programmed the phone of the one who had attempted to find a loophole to deny Pepper’s holiday bonus to play an endless loop of Rihanna’s “Bitch Better Have My Money.” He’d also, with a slightly more guilty conscious, worked his way into Pepper’s private server in order to find some of the ongoing R&D projects and leave corrections and suggestions, along with an unsigned and triple encrypted note telling her she didn’t have to pass any of it on until after the news about his presence in this universe went public.
Steve didn’t use the crop this time. Tony was beyond needing that kind of distraction now, and he worked his way through the series of toys with no room for any thought or concern beyond making it to Steve this time, and surviving the oversensitivity that felt like being on fire from the inside out. By the time he reached the damn fourth dildo again, Steve looked almost as impatient as Tony felt; he had undone his slacks and slid them far enough down his hips to slide his cock out. It was hard and deeply red, and when Tony reflexively licked his lips, Steve gripped it as if he was barely in control of himself.
Content Notes: Lots of big feelings in this chapter, folks. Tony is obviously still working through the trauma of having lost his own Peter in his universe, as well as with his decision to stay away from his own universe. With big feelings sometimes come disagreements, so Steve and Tony have it a bit rough in this one.
Oh team. I'm so sorry this took so long! The last few months have been absurd. But I have deliberately arranged personal and professional stuff to be much lighter over spring and summer, so I swear I'm going to do my absolute best to stick to the usual Friday posting schedule now. I'll also be catching up on comment replies. Get ready to feel sick of hearing from me!
A long time after the evening in question, Peter (with MJ’s help, because parts of the evening are largely inaccessible to his memory after the fact) will create a timeline mapping out the stages of drunkenness involved in the consumption of Asgardian liquor. The first stage is a kind of giddiness that he suspects in hindsight were more the result of successfully sneaking out of the Avengers compound with stolen, otherworldly hooch than the actual liquor itself.
Tony has long since learned that sometimes his Dad’s questions are a trap, and this definitely felt like one of those times. Because before now, Tony would have said he thought it sounded kind of nice, the way that different orientations worked together, making individuals stronger together than they were apart. The thought of knowing someone that way, being known in return, he was too young to really know much about the details of what it would entail, but as a concept, the notion that there might be someone out there like that for him had been a comforting fiction on the many days and nights he spent mostly on his own.
A couple content warnings for this one: MCU Tony drinks to excess in the latter part of this chapter. This won't be something that happens a lot in this verse (I imagine Civil War and the Snap as having pretty much detoxed MCU Tony from his more severe alcoholic tendencies), but if it's a sensitive area that you want to try to avoid, let me know and we'll sort out a redacted version.
“So he can argue the repairs fall under his company’s jurisdiction too. Fuck, I hate this guy already. Gimme the ramrod. Gotta clean this mess up and make sure it doesn’t explode on us before I rip this shit off my beautiful suit with my bare hands. See, Agent Agent? Safety first!”
“I don’t know if I want to spank him or fuck him more,” Bucky declared to fevered nods and murmured agreement from the rest of the team. For his part, Steve sat frozen in his seat as the news replayed the clip of Tony denouncing CNOW and categorically denying the possibility of his company’s future relationship with them.
That had to be Steve or Phil, they were the only ones who called him by his given name. It felt unexpectedly good that he knew that, was becoming familiar with their patterns and habits.
“There are dozens of potential effects, and they can vary widely from person to person. And both are referred to as ‘Domino Hormones’ because a large part of their effect is to stimulate the production or circulation of other hormones that the body wouldn’t otherwise naturally produce, at least not in high quantities, during the conditions of a scene. These include testosterone, serotonin, oxytocin, dopamine, estrogen, and of course endorphins. But they also have some functions unique to them. Generally, subtonin works primarily on the anterior cingulate cortex, which is the part of the brain that—”

“I…yeah, I guess that’s true. That’s how Coulson and Clint, and Nat to some extent, have always operated, I think, long before I was in the picture anyway.” Tony nodded, summoning the chart from the Wakandan report back to him with a complicated gesture Steve hadn’t seen before. (Had he been upgrading SHIELD’s holoscreens too, somehow?)
Sam knows all the reasons that the overrepresentation of people of colour in the military is not necessarily a good thing. That doesn’t make it mean a damn thing less to stand there and receive a compliment from a man like Rhodes, someone who knows exactly the kinds of barriers Sam has faced to be standing here now—the kinds of barriers he will continue to face should he accept the shield somewhere down the road the way Steve and Bucky have both been encouraging him to do. He manages a stiff nod, and Rhodes smiles like he knows why it is that Sam can’t offer more.
Tony sent the coffee cup emoji again, followed by about 15 hearts. Steve countered with one that looked like a sandwich.
an escape room?” Tony demanded when it finally came back to him. Clint gave a slow clap.
“You’re okay. We’re going to make this better. You’re going to be alright, okay? You remember what to do if it gets to be too much?” Bruce prompted.
Up until this moment, there had been something just slightly off about the sound of Tony, something that didn’t quite capture the little vocal tics and lilting nuances that Steve’s memory has been playing on a loop for longer than he’d care to admit. But the protective fury in his voice, oh that was all Tony. It felt like a punch to the gut when Steve was a hundred pounds lighter and several inches shorter.
“I didn’t mean to make you feel neglected, darling. Let’s go sit in the living room, spend some time together, hmm?”
“Sh. Don’t harsh what’s left of my sub-buzz. And pet my hair; you all do it so constantly that I’ve basically been conditioned to need it all the time. It’s borderline cruel to withhold it at this point. And tell me I’m pretty and good and all the floofy stuff.”
“I can do you one better than that, Brucie Bear. The repairs aren’t entirely finished yet—see over here on the side, and up near the neck, and the right arm of course—anyway, if you can make time in the next couple of days you can come work on it with me.”
“Wait, is he religious or something? Oh man, I made a Jesus joke the other day that would have been so offensive—”
