Thor shook his head vigorously, a look of abject horror appearing on his face. “Nay Friend Tony, that is blasphemy to the ears of a god!”
Not sure what the updating schedule will be for this as some scenes will be more difficult to write than others and it takes a while to write out even a small scene. I won't let it go more than two weeks for an update though that's for sure.
Every member of the team sent a glare at Tony at the reminder of his experiments of Gladstone. “He was never harmed and was my dog too,” Tony sighed in response.
Also this is obviously going to be a Stony ending as shown in the tags and I have the idea of how they are going to come together but would you guys be interested having just a declaration of love and a kiss or a more smutty type of getting together? I'm happy to do either but would like to know what you guys would prefer to read since either type of ending would work for what I have planned.
“Remember when I said that he had cost us the rent more than once,” pausing to allow the team to nod in acknowledgment Tony continued, “well more than once was about five times, so that bad.”
“This was the 1800’s remember, it was the time of inventions and even though I’m a quick study and an unparalleled genius, there were still things that I had yet to learn and discover. I may be the world’s leading tech genius today but back then I put my talents to other uses and other people made the discoveries.”
Steve tensed up at the knife at Watson’s throat. He may not exactly be the man’s biggest fan but that didn’t mean he wanted to see the man go in such a manner. Although judging by the almost bored look on Tony’s face, he figured that he didn’t have much to worry about. Steve frowned slightly at the sight of Tony’s face. The look was similar to how his past self had worn and something about it concerned Steve. It was almost as though Tony was distancing himself by appearing unaffected by matters.
“How did you even get the woman in on the deceit?” Thor questioned, not recalling Tony interacting with the woman.
“Well that’s not entirely true,” disagreed Tony with a grimace. “I’ve never disregarded magic due to my condition and I had no proof to confirm or deny its existence. The ever so miniscule amounts of contempt that they were picking up came from their ridiculous notions of importance through their belief in their system and their practices.”
Steve didn’t want to know or watch what was going to happen next, his fingers digging in painfully on his thighs. He briefly wandered if he was going to end up with bruises from the amount of grabbing he had done and will most probably do.
Tony remembered the anger that he had felt at the fact that those poor girls were not the first and that he had not known about the other murders. He had of course suspected that they were not the first that Blackwood had killed due to the profile that he created on the man, but he hadn’t had it confirmed until that point. The detective had tried to uncover the poor souls who had become victims of this unnecessary business, but they had been covered up so well that he could not find a single trace of the murders. It was just another unforgivable failure of his that still haunts him to this day.
Tony interrupted before Clint could finish the question. “You ever call me that and I will destroy you.” The mechanic’s voice contained a slight trace of amusement but underneath lay a slightly dangerous undercurrent.
“Crap” Tony said realising that he couldn't keep up the charade anymore. Silently cursing Loki, Tony took in the faces of the people who had become more than a team to him over the year and wishing that they wouldn't hate him for what was about to be revealed.
Steve frowned at Natasha’s words, his eyes flicking from Tony’s guilty face to the screen before he understood her meaning. Moving his shoulder out of Tony’s hand, he recalled on Tony’s earlier words that there were things he hadn't been ready to deal with, Steve finally understood. Tony or Sherlock had feelings for Watson that were more than a friend should have for a friend. A strange feeling began to take up residence in Steve’s chest at the thought of Tony being in love with another person.
The Avengers sans Tony raised their collective eyebrows at the woman’s prediction, clearly engaged with the scene playing before them.
Tony gave Hulk a grin that promised the answers to many of life’s unanswered questions. “It’s a very distinctive bump.”
“Seeing and hearing are two different things and my time as Sherlock was one of the hardest lives that I’ve had to give up and move on from. Watching the film may bring up feelings and memories that I’m not yet ready to deal with.”
Steve couldn't help but grin at the sight of Tony, even though the noises coming from the violin were hurting his ears. “You’re in that zone,” he commented absently as he looked on in wonder at sight of Tony in his own world. It had always amazed him how absorbed Tony could get in his work, allowing Steve the opportunity to draw the man without any complaints. Those pictures were locked safely away in a drawer, to be treasured now since Steve figured he wouldn’t be able to draw Tony like that ever again.
Steve's not having a easy time with the movie at the moment and I feel bad for doing it to him but he's going to have to wait to be set straight unfortunately.
“Because of the way that you’re looking at me right now, the look that says that I’ve finally gone of the deep end so to speak. There wasn't any way to prove it to you and I haven't had good experiences in telling people. The last person that I told who I trusted explicitly accused me of witchcraft and let’s just say that it didn't end very well for me. As for how Loki found out well I most certainly didn’t tell him so don’t think that I did okay.”
Not a single person in the common room moved a muscle at the reveal, all of them stunned into shock as Tony broke into a giggle at their faces.
Once pointed out to her it became obvious as to how Natasha had recognised the body. She remembered seeing the photograph of the man from Irene’s letter. The question was now, how was Irene’s case related to Blackwood?
“Loki is a great master at magic so it may be possible that when he was last on Midgard he was able to sense something within you. Did he or any object that he possessed touch you in anyway?”
“I wish you would too,” Natasha grumbled, her head starting to pound slightly with all the twists and turns of the movie.
“Great,” Tony muttered, “now we’re going to have Thor pretending to be Jackie Chan. Better hope the news cameras stay away.”
“What year was this again?” Steve wondered, his eyes lit up in fascination at the sight of the past.
“What are you up to?” Steve wondered out loud, his sharp eyes taking in everything without much understanding.
There was only one way Natasha could think of that Irene would have been able to use her abilities outsmart Tony and it wasn't pleasant. She would have felt a murderous rage at the woman for playing her friend like that but did she really have a leg to stand on when she herself had done it many times.
“We both do,” Natasha chimed in, “but we’ve never been able to master it. Do you think you could teach us?”
“You should be more careful of your things,” Steve scolded, not at all happy with how flustered and uncoordinated Irene had made Tony.
Tony looked around the room to see everyone’s reactions. The team seemed to be nodding in agreement with Watson’s action which caused him to pout slightly. Steve noticed and gave him a stern look that was ruined with the twinkle of mirth in his eyes. “You deserved that.”
“It’s just like when your down in the workshop,” recalled Steve remembering how Tony could lose track of time so easy.
“I am confused as to what is wrong with these doilies,” said Thor, his face twisted in confusion since Asgard had no such thing.
Seeing the wince Natasha raised an eyebrow. “It can’t be that bad if you're willing to tell us about your past lives.”
Thank you for all your comments, reading them really gives me inspiration and makes all the work for this story worth it :)
“My laundry is not dirty at the moment,” pouted Thor, thinking that he was going to miss out on a fun team exercise.
“Are you two really having a conversation whilst choking a man?” Bruce mumbled, regretting his question when he sees the look of grief pass over Tony’s face before being covered with a mask.
The team minus Tony gasped at the sight of the ‘dead’ dog, shooting Tony dark looks. Tony just shook his head and pointed at the screen.
Steve flushed slightly at the sight of the glasses. For some reason whenever he saw the billionaire wearing sunglasses, it caused slightly inappropriate thoughts to run rampant through his mind. The sight of a kinda rough looking Tony with longer, shaggy hair and those glasses, well that was an image Steve was certainly going to treasure.
Tony gave him an eyebrow quirk at the act but made no mention of it. “I’ve lived in multiple time periods where indoor plumbing and hygiene weren’t even a consideration. Something like putrefaction isn’t going to get to me that easy.”
“Ignorant apes,” growled Tony darkly, receiving confused glances from his teammates. “That was an apartment so there were several other occupants within the building. Also, the buildings were connected so the fire would have spread causing untold damage. And let’s not forget that the lab had an unknown amount of unidentified chemicals that could have reacted in a number of ways to the fire.”
Luckily before Natasha could inflict any bodily harm on Thor, Bruce stepped in. “I think what Thor meant to say is that it is not the fact that she is a woman. It’s the fact that with the time period and social expectations, her ability to fight and protect herself caught us by surprise.”
“POP TARTS BLEH,” Hulk grumbled, having tried them once at the begging of Thor and promptly spat them out and punched the Asgardian for making him try them.
“Of course, it just has a British accent is all.” Tony responded not understanding why she needed the clarification.
Clint pointed at his eyes, some part of him trying to reassure that his eyesight was still the best.“I.A.”
Hulk shook Tony gently, causing the genius to turn his head slightly to make eye contact. “WHAT WAS THE JOKE?”
“He had served his purpose, it would have done no good if he went the whole way. It was purely for the good of the meeting,” Tony said, waving away the praise as he waited to get back to the film.
“But she is a fair maiden,” Thor said as Bruce, Steve and Clint winced at how the comment sounded. Natasha’s face went oddly blank as her hand reached behind her back, her gaze firmly on Thor.
Silence followed Natasha’s admission, no one quite sure how to break the tension that had risen during the explanation.
Receiving mumbles of yeah’s around the room, Steve teared his gaze away from Tony and resumed the film.
“JARVIS my old friend, did I somehow sleep walk to my room or perhaps invent technology that can teleport people in their sleep?”
Whilst Steve didn't approve of Tony’s lifting, he couldn't help but recognise the usefulness off it. Perhaps Tony could teach him one day, purely as a training exercise and nothing more.
Natasha frowned at him. “Don’t be jealous Tony, you know that was a flawless performance and I bet that was the performance that just won him the competition.”
“Just accept your punishment Clint so we can carry on with the film,” Bruce chimed, his voice barely containing his humour at Clint’s predicament.
Clint began laughing uncontrollably, arms clutched tight around his waist as he shook with such force. The team decided to let him get it out his system, looking on in amusement since they felt the humour at the name. “Can I-” he began as he started to calm down although tears were still flowing freely down his face from the laughing.
“Just normal tobacco. Could you really imagine me on anything else, I mean I tried one of Bruce’s brownies once. High. For. Hours.”
“It’s Tony Stark!” The presenter shouted as Tony’s grinning face was revealed on the screen as the winner, his face slightly shiny with sweat from the heat of the mask.
“You had friends back then? As in plural?” Clint asks, his tone laced with scepticism. He loved Tony and would most definitely call him one of his closest friends, but watching him on screen, he found it difficult to believe that he endeared himself to many back then.
I don’t know either, Steve thought sadly as he sat watching Tony slip away from him with each passing scene of the movie. I don’t know how to stop it.
“He has a point there,” Natasha remarked, not in the least bit surprised at the looks the men gave her in return. “Come on, how many of us have been dead or presumed dead, only to come back stronger than ever?”
Natasha recognised that tactic for what it was. “You just wanted to catch them off guard instead of the other way around.”
“Your sense of smell is that heightened and yet you didn’t find the smell of putrefaction overwhelming?” Steve asked, knowing that his own sense of smell wasn’t strong enough to smell the things that Tony could. Although right now it was certainly strong enough to catch wisps on Tony’s aftershave, something he found very intoxicating. Steve had to shove his hands under his legs to stop himself from reaching over and pulling Tony close in order to press his nose against the man’s neck.
Tony rubbed the back of his head sheepishly. “I may have gone a bit overboard back then and I’m just going to blame it on the stress and emotions of the day before and leave it at that.”
“I don’t think masochist is in your vocabulary to be honest,” Bruce said with a straight face, carefully observing Tony who had started squirming.
Steve nodded his assent, his face barely concealing his longing with a hint of conflict creeping in as well. “It was perfect and whoever that was for is a lucky person.”
Clint wanted to ask who that was but decided to wait. It would most probably be revealed later in the film he thought.
Tony seethed. He remembered reading about those girls from information that their families had given him. Those girls had a whole life ahead of them, three were engaged to be married, one had just secured a job as a Governess and the other one was only fourteen. They weren't meaningless creatures that could be used and discarded to serve someones delusion. They were human beings who had deserved better in life.
“I kinda feel how that man looks right now,” grumbled Bruce, rubbing his forehead wearily as he felt the beginnings of a headache start to emerge.
“So many questions right now,” Clint moaned, trying to curb his desire to sprout question after question at Tony. Seriously the suspense at not knowing what exactly was going on was starting to take it’s toll on his impulse control.
“No one is blaming you for anything Thor, it’s just that its caught us by surprise since we thought that if he ever escaped he would attack and not leave us a cryptic message. Speaking of the message Tony do you know what he was talking about when he said that you were keeping something from us?” Steve interjected trying to get a handle on the situation.
“Is everything a joke to you?” Steve asked, half seriously and half fondly, this time the words not holding any bite. He tried not to show how humorous he found the names given to the men.
Steve noticed Tony’s reaction and he too felt something in his body. A feeling that had intensified from the dinner scene although he still couldn’t put a name to it. Of course there would be someone else that captured his attention and it would be a stunningly beautiful woman.
A stab of concern lanced through Natasha’s chest at the sight of Tony stumbling before she narrowed her eyes. She was learning that Tony was a master manipulator and she wouldn’t put it past him to try something during a fight.
“Explain,” Natasha commanded, her arms folded in a no nonsense type of way, obviously not in the mood for games.
“And you never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity to criticise someone for something that you could have done better,” Natasha noted, easily recalling several instances where Tony had criticised or pointed out a fault during a mission.
Tony pursed his lips to keep back the smile threatening to break free. “It plays to their ego, makes them feel like the bigger person when they sprout such nonsense.”
Clint tried to find some levity in the situation before them. “It’s like a weird twisted version of Donkey Kong.”
“I guess if you like the smell of horse manure and pickpockets but it’s nothing special,” he dismissed.
Tony barked out a laugh at Bruce’s comment, not explaining why he found the comment about a random stranger funny.
Bruce jumped out of his seat and started pacing in agitation. All eyes were on the doctor as he tried to calm himself down. After several minutes to which no one dared to speak, Bruce let out a deep breath and sat back down. Pointing an accusing finger at Tony, Bruce’s expression dared him to argue. “You and I are going to have a very long chat about what you can and can’t put in your body.”
“All night?” Steve asked, not realising that a slightly substantial amount of time had passed between the two scenes in regard to the matters at hand.
“Are you going to go and help her?” Steve asked Tony, turning his body around to catch the amused smirk on the engineers face. He may not like the woman, but that didn't mean he wanted to see her get attacked by anyone.
Firstly, I just want to say thank you for all of your kind messages of support about why I had to take time away from my stories, reading all of your messages really helped me through a difficult time and I was blown away by the support.
“Idiots,” Natasha muttered fondly, her heart breaking just a little at the reminder that Tony no longer had Watson.
Tony scooted closer to Steve, silently offering the larger man comfort with his presence instead of his words which the soldier accepted graciously.
Bruce interrupted before Tony could annoy the red head assassin anymore at the evidence of his deception and before Natasha could nudge at Tony’s feelings for a certain someone. “Don’t hate me for asking this but why that song at the end?”
“That would do it then,” Steve said with a wince, as he knew what men went through during times of war.
Steve let out a soft huff. If anyone else had called a bowl of honeycomb peculiar then they would have gotten a strange look but for some reason when Tony said it, it seemed reasonable. Perhaps even endearing. God, the things the man did to him and he didn’t even have a clue and would never if Steve had anything to say about it.
Bruce shook his head at the evidence of Tony’s clinginess. It was quite endearing to see how far the man would go to keep the people closest to him but also worrying that he would feel the need to go to such lengths.
"Yes!" Thor shouted, pumping his fist into the air at the appearance of Watson. “Now the fight shall be won in your favour.”
“He was a veteran of the Second Afghan War and even though he survived he suffered some trauma to his leg that resulted in the limp that you can see.”
“A little archaic isn’t it to be performing a sacrifice,” Bruce muttered, the film intriguing him even further.
“Shit,” Clint whispered, accurately summing up what the rest of the team were thinking in that moment.
I don't know when I'll post the next chapter as I'm going to update my other story first and don't want to rush writing this story for the sake of an update since you all deserve the best that I can deliver so I would say an update for this may come in about two weeks.
Tony sent an apologetic look to Bruce in response to the man’s glare. “Would you believe me if I said it wasn’t my intention to antagonise him?”
Steve glared at her, his eyes glancing to Tony before he answered. “I would call it respect for a man who seems to have gone through so much in his life and yet has the courage and will to carry on and make a difference.”
Deciding that he had enough of the social interaction that he had been forced into, Tony started to make his way back to the elevator. However, once he reached the doors they didn’t open.
“So that’s what it looked like,” Tony absently mused to himself, not noticing how the other occupants of the room were freaking out.
Bruce picked up the case, his eyes widening as he saw the image on the case. He kept flicking his eyes from the case to Tony, not knowing what to say.
“That would be just to start with,” granted Natasha, knowing that something like that would cause much more than panic. No one would be safe if that information got leaked.
“I pretty much make a name for myself in every life, it’s not intentional, it just seems that something out there forces me into situations where I literally become a household name,” Tony shrugged his shoulders as if to say what could he do about it.
Thor opened his mouth to question the meaning of the musical phrases when Natasha answered the unspoken question.
Thor was not impressed with the way the Inspector was talking to his men. If a leader wanted his men’s respect, then they needed to show compassion when needed. A leader could not rely on fear and bullying to keep his men loyal. “The Inspector could have taken his men’s feelings into consideration, it would do no good to force them to do something with which they are obviously uncomfortable with.”
“I believe that he intends to simply talk to Friend Tony and that if we observe silently, everything will become clear,” Thor answered.
Thor noted that the way the Inspector had entered the fray, would have most likely caused him harm since he was vastly outnumbered and had not drawn his weapon. One of the things that Thor disliked was incompetence and so far, the Inspector had not been making a good impression on the Prince. Hopefully the rest of the film would help to change his perception.
“It wasn’t to prove a point but to open his eyes to the reality that he was going to bring upon himself,” defended Tony quite sullenly.
Tony broke into a smile at her words, mostly in happiness but partly in relief that the assassin wasn't going to give him an ass whopping.
Bruce held up a slightly apologetic hand in front of the three men who were on their way to the elevator.
The mechanic just ignored her as the team turned their attention back to the screen, the panel throwing out guesses that the Eagle was either Hugh Jackman or Ryan Reynolds.
“Oh he likes the singing all right. Specifically the singing of one certain celebrity,” laughed Clint as Steve turned even redder. “Stevie here has a crush.”
Natasha easily read between the lines of Tony’s defence. Whilst technically true that they had indeed been attacked first and that he hadn’t intentionally caused that, it wasn’t entirely fair to say that Watson hadn’t been slightly manipulated into going. At this rate, the master assassin was going to have to give up her title of Black Widow to Tony, who was deftly creating his own web that was becoming more difficult to notice.
The team shook their heads at Tony’s antics, no comments needing to be made at the slightly desperate attempts being made.
When JARVIS failed to respond to the override code that would allow him to communicate with Tony if he was compromised, Tony began to panic. The only time when JARVIS had gone off line was followed shortly by Stane ripping the arc reactor out of Tony’s chest.
“I want one,” Clint exclaimed, picturing himself looking mighty fine with a weapon like that. Everyone else though thought differently but were willing to humour him so that they could make fun of him in the future.
“Have Clint show you later,” Bruce responded, not looking the least inclined to explain the whole variety of cosmetic surgery.
“I think that I can speak for everyone hear when I say that we understand where you're coming from and that even though the circumstances weren't ideal, we’re glad that we know the truth.”
“Good riddance,” Clint murmured, unaware that the film was soon to deliver the first of many twists.
Clint chimed in at this point taking over whilst the show went to a commercial before the next performance. “Tasha and I watch it to use our spy skills to work out the celebrity although we’re forbidden from using SHIELD or JARVIS to figure it, we have to use other means to figure it out.”
A frown marred the Thunder god’s features as he was certain that he had seen that book before. Both his mother and Loki had an extensive collection of magical tomes and records, so it hadn’t been an unusual sight for him to see one in their hands on Asgard during all times of the day. He tried to rack his memory and knew he could sense it on the edge of his consciousness but for some reason he just could not pull up the memory, something that had never happened before.
“Oh,” Thor mumbled, ducking his head in embarrassment at having jumped the gun. He now realised that Friend Tony was manipulating the man for his own gain by trying to take him down a peg.
“I don’t know what is grosser, the cut open frogs or his missing front teeth,” Clint groaned in exaggeration, “seriously would it have killed the man to have gone to a dentist?” Tony just rolled his eyes at Clint’s complaint. Honestly Reordan was one of the better ones as he was only missing two teeth. Tony had seen people whose teeth were rotten and black. He made a mental note to ask JARVIS to send Clint some articles later for the sole reason to educate the agent. Maybe make a slide show with pictures as well whilst he was at it too since some visual aid couldn’t hurt.
Natasha leaned further towards Clint so that her mouth was directly next to his ear. “Don’t add more fuel to the fire. It’s bad enough that Cap’s already thinking that Tony has something for Watson, you don’t need to accidentally encourage it.”
“And the winner of season two of The Masked Singer is… Eagle!” The team whooped and clapped at the result, happy that their favourite had won and now anxiously waiting for the reveal of the one that had captured the ‘respect’ of their Captain.
Words can not express what I am feeling but I urge you all to just take a moment out of your day to be grateful and thankful for those around you and I hope that one day I can come back to this platform.
With that she turned back to the screen, where indeed a panel where complimenting the Flamingo on her performance and throwing out guesses at her identity. Tony blinked for a second, before shrugging and making his way over to the team. Steve saw him coming and scooted over, making enough room for Tony with a shy smile that never failed to take Tony’s breath away. Tony graciously took the seat next to Steve, just enough space made that they ended up touching from shoulder to knee, not that Tony was complaining. He had had a crush on Steve for the past six months and wasn’t going to pass up any opportunity to have physical contact with the man.
“You have history with each,” Natasha noted, her suspicions confirmed when Tony’s face twisted in anger and pain for a brief moment.
Tony thought back on that moment when Dredger had destroyed that beam. He remembered that several workers had been injured and one man lost a hand from the destruction and could no longer work. All because Tony had thought that he knew what he was doing. He couldn’t help but feel angry at himself for how he acted back then.
"But you didn’t even know what the show was when you came in!” Clint spluttered as he looked back and forth between the Tony on the screen and the Tony in front of him.
“I was a ballet dancer,” she shrugged, “I learnt a fair bit about the music in order to translate it into my dancing.”
With a teasing grin, Tony just patted the super soldier’s knee, leaving his hand there as he turned back to the film. “All in good time Cap.”
Bruce too exhaled a long sigh. He was going to hazard a guess that whatever was going to happen next, would be testing on his control.
“Really Tony?” Steve groaned, feeling slightly embarrassed for the genius at how oblivious and also obvious he was being.
I was informed yesterday that my best friend who I met at uni in September 2017 and have spent the past two and a half years being inseparable with passed away in an unfortunate accident yesterday. The past 24 hours have been some of the worst hours of my life and I can not find it in myself to write when my world has completely changed.
The green giant gave him what Tony considered to be a pitying look. “BECAUSE TIN MAN MAKE PUNY BRUCE AND HULK FEEL SAFE. FEEL LIKE FAMILY.”
Steve flinched at Tony’s tone, his shoulders hunching over making himself look smaller and sending a faint sense of guilt running through Tony.
Tony thought back to that headline. London had indeed been in terror at the revelation of what had happened at Blackwood’s tomb and Tony had felt as though he was the reason to blame for the fear and terror spreading like wildfire across the city. If he had thought ahead and ensured that all the loose ends were tied up, then people would have continued to feel safe.
Clint handed over ten dollars to Natasha, whilst Natasha wore a smug look on her face that screamed I told you so.
"You're running on the fly now,” Natasha commented, taking in the slightly panicked way Tony was retreating.  “You didn’t expect things to go like that and now you have no plan and a bunch of civilians in the way.”
“I just like the singing,” Steve mumbled refusing to meet anyone’s eyes. Tony raised an eyebrow, doubting that was the reason and turned back to the team to find them grinning at Steve’s expense.
Finally, today is my birthday (cheers to being 24!) so here's a new chapter as my gift to all of you! It's not the best chapter since I haven't written in who know how long but it felt good to get back into it and further the story in a way that I hadn't planned. This story is officially of hiatus but I don't know how often I'll update but I do have new plans for the direction of this story.
“Don’t rub it in Tony, none of us have heard you sing before so we didn’t relate the clues back to you,” growled out Natasha in both annoyance at having been duped as well as appreciation at being out manoeuvred. “Although the colours on the wings now make sense,” Natasha finished with a quick glance at Steve.
Thor felt his anger rise at the sight of his Shield Brother being held up in such a way. He swore to himself there and then that he would do everything in his power to make sure that Tony would never again have to deal with someone placing their hands on him in such a manner. If he failed then there were going to be consequences.
Clint jumped in then, a smirk on his face as he realised Natasha’s train of thought. “Don’t worry about it man. That accent is pretty hot though, wouldn't you agree Steve?”
Natasha sighed in in commiseration for Watson, she knew what it was like to have a partner that turned every situation upside down, darting a quick glance to Clint who waggled his eyebrows at her as he knew what she was thinking.
Steve shook his head in disagreement. “I think he looks fine,” he retorted in defence of Tony before blushing at the knowing looks of the team.
“Aye Loki is a trickster by nature but his actions are usually fuelled by a semblance of truth. I do not think that he would deviate from this.”
“Is he reading something from the Bible?” Steve questioned, trying to recall his Catholic upbringing, but drawing a blank.
Sitting up right Clint shared a look with Natasha as they both recognised the style of fighting but had never been able to master it.
“I liked to have a friendly fight sometimes and it earned me some money on the side,” Tony defended. Only Thor nodded his understanding since he took it as another way of sparring. The others were doubtful that this was a friendly fight due to the look on the other mans face but declined to say anything.
Turning the case around the Avengers gasped as they saw a man who was the spitting image of Tony standing on the case with his arms behind his back. Next to the man was another who was dressed in the same style of clothing but was wearing a bowler hat and a cane over his shoulder. A range of buildings found in London is shown faintly behind the two men whilst the words Sherlock Holmes were written in the middle of the case over the two men.
“I fell into the railing and since the ship was unfinished, they hadn’t yet but it in the railing to go onto the water. The ship was sitting on top of the railing which is why I was not reduced to a smear on the hull.”
Steve cringed at the loud crash as he wondered if the man was going to help Tony out of whatever predicament he’d just found himself in.
“Is that Tower Bridge?” asked Steve, trying to imagine that bridge as the one he had crossed back in the war.
Natasha stared intently at the shocked expression on Tony’s face. Was it shock that the facts were coming out to begin to twist the theories to support the supernatural?
“Well let’s go get our drink on then, who wants to hear about my life as a man named Charlie Chaplin?”
“Basically a chromatic scale has twelve pitches which are semi tones apart, they are equally spaced. Atonal is ignoring conventional harmonies and lacks a tonal centre. So what he’s discovered is that following something regimented elicits no response whereas playing something that does not follow a set key or tone causes the order of the flies.”
I'm thinking that the next update will be in a couple of weeks as I'll update my other story first but I will try to get another chapter up by the end of the month.
“Well then,” Tony started, his voice kept carefully neutral lest he gave away his emotions. “I can’t wait to see who the lucky person is that managed to gain your respect without even showing his face.”
“Woah,” Clint murmured quietly, taking in the destroyed remains of the tomb. How on earth had Lord Scum managed that?
“Wait a minute,” she said, her sharp eyes watching the scene with curiosity. “I don’t think he actually means any harm to Tony.”
“It was a different time Thor, criminals were treated differently back then,” Bruce answered, his eyes glued to the screen lest he miss anything.
Taking a deep breath before releasing it, Natasha began to read the words written to the rest of the Avengers.
I know that this is not what a lot of you want to hear but I am sorry to say that I am taking an indefinite hiatus from all writing.
The costume easily recognisable as the animal that it was meant to be except with a few changes to the colour of the feathers on the wings. Instead of the usual tones found on eagles, the wings of this singer were in beautiful shades of red and blue, interspaced with white and on the very tips were flecks of gold.
“We could use that image as a before and after plastic surgery advert!” Laughed Clint, who seemed to be the only one who found his joke funny.
“Shouldn’t you be pointing that evidence out to the officers?” Thor questioned, confused at Tony’s lack of following the chain of evidence, especially as Thor had strictly been told that on missions he was to report any evidence he found.
Clint tilted his head in thought. “You do have a point there, asides from trying to reel him into helping you. Something like that would have very negative consequences for his career.”
Bruce just sighed and raised an eyebrow at Tony sitting in his lap with no shame and a beaming smile. “What did I miss?
“Who’s that?” Steve asked in worry, knowing that Tony only ever got that angry when he or someone he cared about was being personally threatened.
“It had been a while since we had seen Irene so he most probably couldn't easily recognise her and I hadn’t told him that I saw her at the fighting match.” The only reason that he hadn't told Watson about Irene that night was because he had first thought that he was imaging her and then when he realised she was real, he hadn't wanted to deal with all of the teasing that would follow.
Steve watched as Tony leaned into Hulk for a brief moment before moving back into his original position, a surge of jealousy welling up that Tony wasn’t taking comfort from him.
“See I didn’t kill the dog,” Tony informed them as he rolled his eyes at their collective sighs of relief.
Hi everyone! I know it's been a while since I've updated but I've just stared uni and had to kind of put everything on hold as I moved to a new place and dealt with all the welcome talks and first couple of weeks. I tried to make this chapter longer as I don't know when I'll next be able to update.
“Yeah man,” Clint added taking the focus off Bruce. “I mean Nat and I are trained to spot that kind of thing and you totally got one over on us.”
Tony smirked back in response but his eyes held amusement as he knew what Steve was referring to. “Funny things are.”
Tony noticed her questioning eyes and heaved a heavy sigh. “The one time that I didn't do that, was the one time that I got shot. Luckily Watson noticed the shine of the gun and pushed me to the side so that the bullet only hit my shoulder but it was a close one. That’s why I always open doors and then check before entering a room.”
Steve broke into a face splitting smile at Tony’s words, his face lightening up with unabashed happiness. With a quick reflection at his words, Tony realised that he had basically just spewed his emotions about the team out loud. He felt his cheeks heat up in mortification, fully expecting someone to make a joke about how much he cared.
Clint found himself wincing at the injury list since he himself had experienced all of them just never at the same time.
Tony shook his head in amusement. “If I did that then I would never have seen it again and the outcome of the case would have changed dramatically. I couldn't really care about the proper chain when it comes to stopping a dangerous man.”
All the men in the room winced at the sight whilst Natasha made a mental note to stock up on walnuts in all common areas for the future. Holmes sniffs again as a female voice begins to speak.
Everyone turned to look at the super soldier in surprise to which Steve blushed in embarrassment. “My ma tried her hand at making one when I was a kid with some spare fabric, we spent the whole afternoon trying to figure it out before we gave up. It’s one of my favourite memories of her.”
Thor felt his anger rise at the sight of the sophisticated coffin. Why should such a lowlife get an upscale burial when he had committed such atrocities? If his crimes had taken place on Asgard then he would have been stripped of his title and denied his resting place with his ancestors.
Catching Natasha’s smirk, Tony smiled. He had a feeling he knew what the master assassin was thinking and began preparing himself for the observations she would be making on him as he knew that the fact he had been able to play her irked her a little.
Tony raised an eyebrow at that revelation. “So the super spy twins weren’t able to deduce that it was me from the clues or voice?”
Half the team looked a bit green at the sight of the bugs crawling on the man’s face and it wasn’t a Hulk shade of green either.
Here's the next chapter since I found myself on a roll from the last one and wanted to give you all something a bit longer than before.
Natasha wrinkled her nose in disgust. She knew full well what had just been chucked and felt her stomach churn slightly.
“No clue, I mean the man is a bag full of crazy and like he said, he’s the God of Lies and Mischief, can we really trust what he’s saying?”
Thor smiled in relief at seeing Tony awake and seemingly in good shape. He had never seen him look surprised at a piece of technology before. It was a strange sight to see.
“Well now that we have that sorted, how about letting Bruce come back out to play?” Tony asked, slightly uncomfortable with the show of emotion as he tried to extricate himself out of the Hulk’s lap as carefully as possible.
Bruce tried to hide his embarrassment with a cough. “I’m not going to apologise Tony. I am amazed at how well you came up with a disguise in such a short amount of time though.”
The emotion in Tony’s eyes answered her question without the need for words. Natasha felt overwhelmed with the depth of emotions that Tony was showing, knowing that Tony felt ten times more overwhelmed.
“Fifty bucks says that it’s the other way round,” Natasha whispered back with a mischievous gleam in her eye.
Thor frowned at the slight towards the young maiden. Friend Tony may not have wanted to meet her but that was no excuse to treat her unjustly.
“Okay first of you’ve seen me fight before so seeing me do it on screen shouldn't be that surprising and secondly that future thing was just me predicting the outcome of the fight.”
“Why can’t the villain ever speak clearly? Is it so difficult for them to speak plainly?” Steve huffed in annoyance.
“Oh no,” Steve whispered at the sight of the stunning ring lying among the mess. He hoped that Watson would be able to find out so he could propose to Mary.
“He didn't even blink an eye at your antics,” Natasha mused, impressed with how well Watson seemed to deal with said antics.
I know I said that I was going to try and get this up within two weeks and it's been over a month but unfortunately plans don't always go to plan and things get in the way. I won't go into details but I found enough time to write this chapter out in about two hours, so if it may be a little rough but you all deserve an update.
Well, that explained why four of them were watching, leaving only Steve to explain. Tony turned to the super soldier in question, surprised to find the man in question blushing lightly.
“And did you forget about the landing you thought you could stick back in Vegas that involved the suit, a rabbit and a Captain America impersonator?”
Tony shrugged, deferring not to answer at this particular point as the reasons would become apparent later in the film.
The team sans Tony just sighed at the revelation of Blackwood’s parentage, slowly coming to learn that this movie was going to full of twists and that it was better to save their reactions for when things inevitably went to pot again. Even Hulk was getting used to the plot twists and he hadn’t even watched the whole movie.
Next chapter will be up at the weekend as I quit one of my jobs so should have plenty more free time to do some writing!
Steve reached over to Tony and snatched the remote out of his to pause the movie. Tony pulled his eyes away from the screen to see the incredulous looks on his team’s face, knowing that there were still many surprises to still to come.
But if Thor’s expressions were anything to go by, then the book indeed did have the power that the Order believed in, which lead to the question, why had it not worked in their hands? Why had they not used the power of the book like they claimed if it indeed had been real?
“I mean are you sure that the light didn't do more damage than shown or have you finally gone off the rails?”
“Well that was different, my life compared to eight million lives was really a no brainer and it wasn’t as if anyone needed me anymore,” Tony explained, understanding but choosing to ignore the sad looks that the team sent him in response to that logic.
Secondly this story hit over 400 kudos, so another big thank you as I didn't think that this was going to be something that people were interested in.
“Come on, come on, come on,” Steve chanted, his face going pale as Tony failed to take a breath. It couldn’t be over like that?
Tony slumped his shoulders, fighting the urge to chuckle since the big guy was only looking out for him. “I have a very active mind and need stimulation. Nowadays I can keep myself in control and occupied due to the change in technology but back then I found that if I had no cases, my mind would go slightly haywire.”
The giant rage monster vigorously shook his head before Steve even finished his question, deciding to turn his body so that he was facing the TV with Tony still firmly planted in his lap. “HULK KEEP TIN MAN SAFE UNTIL PUNY BRUCE BACK. TIN MAN DO STUPID THINGS WITHOUT HULK.”
“That really got to you didn’t it,” Natasha observed, thinking that their friendship was similar to how Clint and Coulson were. Coulson being similar to Watson in essentially taking care and being a rock for Clint. When Clint lost Coulson it had been devastating, so she could only imagine how Tony would react to losing Watson who he seemed at times quite dependent on.
Before he could comment on the lie, Clint let out a cackle and pointed a finger at Tony in amusement. “You are one sly dog, you seriously made a joke like that in that time period and in a prison no less?!”
Thank you for all your kudos and kind comments, reading how much your enjoying this story really brings a smile to my face after a hard day at work :)
Tony sniffed in faked indignation. “Don’t be ridiculous Steve, I’d say at least a seven year old although an argument could be made for maybe six.”
Tony turned bright red at the reminder of that night and purposely turned back to the screen, ignoring Steve’s inquisitive gaze.
“Never take your eyes of your opponent,” Clint offered, his eyes meeting Natasha’s across the room as they knew how a mistake like that could nearly cost you your life.
“1890,” Tony responded promptly, the sounds of the carriages beginning to make him feel nostalgic already.
“Wait, you two did all the work and yet your giving the credit to the Inspector?” Clint questioned, disbelief colouring his tone that Tony wouldn’t soak up the attention for himself.
“If I see that crow one more time, I’m going to shoot something,” warned Natasha, leaving the men in the room to wonder if she was serious or not.
Natasha shook her head. It was ridiculous that the men who sat above everyone and ignored the plight of the less fortunate only cared now because they were now the ones in danger, actually thought that Tony would be willing to work for them.
Bruce looked on at his friend in amazement. It was truly amazing to see the skills that his friend had but Bruce had to wonder how Tony could even operate on a day to day basis when he noticed every single tiny detail. It must be overwhelming and exhausting, yet it never showed. Not once had Tony ever shown any discomfort around the team even though in the movie it was obvious that his skills took a toll. Bruce realised that there was still a lot that Tony was hiding from them and he wasn’t sure if the movie was going to break down those barriers that Tony was keeping up.
The team looked on in amusement at the show, finding it slightly funny how Tony was reacting to a seemingly inconspicuous old lady.
“That’s just nasty.” Steve looked a little pale at the dead rats which Tony found fascinating considering the guy had gone through a war. All the blood, guts and other nasty things should have given the man an iron stomach. Although in all honesty, the mechanic found everything about Steve fascinating so really he didn’t find it strange in the long run.
“Why was that surprising?” Steve asked, the buff blonde slightly confused as to why it would make a difference if it was a Lord.
“Thanks J, although take some credit yourself for keeping it a secret as well,” grinned Tony to the nearest camera as the team shook off their shock.
Thank you all for still following this story and your comments mean the world to me as it's really special reading them and knowing what parts your enjoying and looking forward to seeing.
“Yeah right,” Bruce muttered under his breath, low enough so Tony couldn’t hear but Steve did with his super soldier hearing and adopted a confused stare.
“Did they actually believe that the Temple of the Four Orders was responsible for the course of history?” Steve asked, not liking that these men who were in high positions of power as well as secret societies with hidden agendas, were responsible for the running of governments.
This chapter is slightly longer in terms of translating the movie and we are now over half an hour into the film!
That being said, I finally forced myself to finish this chapter and move on with the movie which will hopefully kickstart me back into writing as it's a new scene and chapter.
“It’s not the craziest thing I’ve heard believe it or not and I don't think that even someone like you could make up a story like that. Although the next time you decide to keep something big from us, I will not hesitate to kick your ass.”
“JARVIS,” Tony began, drawing the attention of the Avengers to himself, “would you be a dear and open the doors for me?”
“For a supposed genius that was a slightly childish response,” Natasha teased although she knew why the genius in question had a bad comeback.
“I wouldn’t say that,” glowered Tony at Watson’s compliment. “Her left eye was slightly lower than her right,” he finished with a sniff.
“Say that you are telling the truth then why didn't you tell us this before?” Natasha asked breaking her silence to ask the question that Tony had been dreading for fear that the team wouldn't understand his reasoning for keeping it a secret.
Bruce thought that he understood why Watson wasn't rejoicing at the sight of Blackwood’s end. Even though it was slightly satisfying seeing a murderer get what he deserved, as a doctor it was hard to see someone die whilst doing nothing to help. It essentially went against everything that as a doctor you fought for.
This is a slightly shorter chapter but I felt that the cut off point should be here as the next chapter will be dinner and a fight so that one will be slightly longer.
“No, no, no! You have to get out of there!” Steve urged, a sickening sense of unease passing through him as Blackwood played Tony with his words.
“See!” exclaimed Clint, pointing dramatically at the screen. “I’m not the only one who jumps to the conclusion that Tony isn’t human when faced with the facts!”
“Why do I get the feeling that whatever you’re going to find or do will exceed his ten minute limit?” Bruce asked Tony with a raised eyebrow.
“What do you mean sort of?” Steve demanded, starting to get annoyed with the lack of trust Tony was displaying.
I know it's been a while and I want to thank everyone for their patience as I settled into university and completed my first semester, I know it's not always fun to wait for new chapters but sometimes RL has to come first :(
“I don’t think we need to start on my sexual preferences right now,” Tony growled, only catching a brief look of anger on Steve’s face before it disappeared. Huh. Maybe Steve was just as annoyed and uncomfortable at talking about sex in a public setting he thought. That must be it Tony though with only a small amount of certainty since there wasn't any other reason why Steve would be angry at that.
This chapter for some reason was really difficult to write, maybe because there was a lack of dialogue and I may go back and change some parts later but for now I'm reasonably happy with it. Also I apologise if any of the French is wrong in this chapter, I used translate as I do not know the language. That being said I give you my first chapter of 2018...
“That’s you Friend Tony! But why are you running away from your friends?” Thor boomed, already confused with the movie.
Bruce started stammering his denials which fell on deaf ears as the team already knew about the brownies.
However, Tony wasn’t deterred and once again voiced his question as to what on earth was happening. Seriously, it wasn’t a normal sight to see five of the most feared superheroes on Earth and perhaps the universe, sitting around a TV watching a giant bright pink flamingo strutting across a stage whilst belting out Proud Mary.
“Punk,” Steve muttered under his breath although Tony heard due to his closeness and had to stifle a laugh in response.
“Ouch,” Clint winced, his worry for Tony outweighing the amusement he felt at the face and sound his teammate had made before being thrown.
Thank you for all the comments and kudos and special thanks to the people who gave me the idea for a jealous Steve, I hope this is what your looking for :)
“That actually did happen once,” Tony informed the team, his eyes alight with humour as he remembered that day. “We spent four hours tracking him through London to find him pinned to a wall in a bar being used for target practice.”
At the revelation, there were no exclamations of surprise as the remaining Avenger’s already had an inkling that there was some kind of connection between the two. Otherwise Reordan wouldn’t have been found in Blackwood’s coffin. What they didn’t know was what they were working together for.
“Not when people’s lives are on the line,” replied Tony seriously. “I’m not going to risk people’s lives because someone made a stupid mistake. If they can’t handle being told how to avoid it in the future so people don’t die, then they can leave and find a job where a mistake doesn't equate to a life.”
“Shakespeare, Henry V, interesting choice of words,” Bruce noted recognising the words from his time in high school.
“It’s a little weird,” Clint said a goofy smile beginning to lighten up his face, “but I fully expect to hear stories from those past lives, I bet that you totally used a bow and arrow since you didn't have any fancy technology!”
“No Sir, Captain Rogers came by to the lab after you had passed out to bring you some food. When he saw that you had fallen asleep he decided that it would be better if you slept in your bed. He carried you to your bedroom and proceeded to tuck you in. I have the security footage if you would like to see for yourself.”
At Bruce’s question, Tony tensed up. He had forgotten about that song choice and about the fact that he was sitting next to the reason for why he had chosen that song.
Steve felt as though he couldn’t deny that, so he wisely left it and returned back to the movie, a smile tugging at the corner of his lips.
“Yeah I’m definitely not going to make you angry,” Clint said, trying to alleviate some of the tension in the room. “I’m not going to be blamed for humanity’s enslavement.” With a collective snort the team resumed the film, although five of them were now wondering how else the film was going to make the re-evaluate one of their own.
“And there it is,” whispered Natasha, pleased that these revelations were coming to light at last and that Tony was finally realising what they had all known and accepted a while ago.
Tony spared a moment to be jealous at the ease of which the very hefty man managed to make that action look as he remembered full well that his own attempt was much less graceful.
Surprisingly Steve was the one who answered the confused Asgardian. “They’re ornamental mats that are usually used for protecting surfaces. They look very intricate and are considered to be quite feminine.”
The Avengers also duck at the noise, as Natasha gave the screen a calculating look. “Why do I have the feeling that was you?”
Steve on the other hand was wondering how much more torturous the film was going to be. Honestly there was only so much one man could take before certain matters had to be taken care of if his body wasn't going to take note that his mind had declared Tony off limits due to certain revelations. The super-soldier hoped that nothing else in the film was going to cause unwanted reactions that would be difficult to explain.
Thor took in the good doctor’s expression, curious as to why he would be confused. “Why does he look like that?”
“I don’t even know how you manipulated the situation to do that,” Natasha confessed, impressed at subtle manipulation used to turn the situation to Tony’s advantage.
Tony sneaked a peek at Steve once he had finished his explanation, allowing the team to wrap their heads around that. What he saw pleasantly surprised Tony. Steve had an expression of understanding of which Tony took to be that Steve knew what it was like to stumble through a new time period whilst having memories of a previous one. That was partially the reason why it was so easy for Tony to help the super soldier in adjusting to the 21st century as Tony had many years of experience behind him. Although helping Steve had the unfortunate side effect of Tony falling for him since they ended up spending hours watching films alone in Tony’s penthouse.
“I thought that we were a team. That we trusted each other with our secrets and our lives and yet you didn’t tell us because you thought that we couldn’t handle it. Do we mean so little too you Tony?”
“That man is twisted,” snapped Clint, his distaste for the man dripping from his words. “Who does he think he is, insisting that you both have some kind of bond. What is he trying to gain?”
"I think we all know very well,” Clint growled darkly, his hatred for Blackwood surprising the rest of the team apart from Natasha. She shook her head at the other men before they asked what was it about Blackwood that was getting under Clint’s skin. They wisely took her unspoken advice and faced the screen once again.
Tony’s breath hitched and his eyes were glued to the sight of the woman who he thought he would never see alive again. Tracing the long lost beauty and grace of Irene Adler, Tony felt something in his heart clench even though he had long ago accepted her death.
Natasha was the closest and so she picked up both items, eyes quickly scanning the paper as her body tensed with each line she read.
“Maybe because they’re about to execute someone?” Clint answered, slightly baffled as to why Steve even needed to ask.
“So what would you do if someone truly angered you?” Natasha asked as a faint spike of fear went though her at the thoughts.
“It’s a Midgardian thing Thor,” Tony responded, his eyes promising that if the rest of the Avenger’s disagreed with him, then there would be hell to pay.
“Are you sure that you should be questioning his commitment issues because I think that your’s are slightly more problematic.” Clint had barely finished the sentence before Natasha leaned over and pinched him. Hard.
For a moment Thor thought that he recognised the strangely drawn creature on the panel but the drawing disappeared before he could get a strong handle on the thought. He should have paid more attention to his studies like Loki did rather than skip them in favour of fighting.
Clint noted the way Tony called Blackwood dangerous. Sure the man had killed five women and he didn't want to belittle that but he had been easily stopped by Holmes and Watson alone, how did that equate to dangerous?
Natasha smiled sadly. “It’s not something that you can casually bring up in a conversation. Besides we’re all allowed to have some secrets, even if they do have to come to light at some point.”
“It’s called misdirection Legolas, couldn’t let you suspect anything plus do you know how many forms I signed swearing me to secrecy?”
