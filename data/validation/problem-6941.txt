Tony finally smiled back, absent-mindedly looking in the direction of his bedroom. “Uh,” he laughed to himself as he ran a hand through his hair a couple times, “we could—wait sorry, are you hungry?”
“You would be lost without me, Tone.” Rhodey smirked as he tossed Steve’s file onto Tony’s desk. The force of the toss propelled the file into Tony’s lap who laughed as soon as it hit his stomach.
On top of that, Tony hadn’t been looking forward to being in the same room with his so-called surrogate father, Obadiah Stane. The two had been bumping heads lately, to say the least, and the last thing Tony needed to deal with was an unflinching Obie who thought he knew how to run the company better. Also, Tony was still too awkward around Pepper to have a normal conversation since their breakup last year, even when it came to discussing business. Nick Fury had been the only person in the interview process that Tony wasn’t on the outs with, which wasn’t saying much.
Steve eyed Loki, but then conveyed neutrality to avoid making the atmosphere between the two men more awkward than it already was.
The team had gathered to visit Clint at Mount Liberty Hospital. The group looked on from a window in the hallway as Dr. Strange and some nurses whirled around Clint’s bed. Strange stopped to talk to a nurse before walking out of the room to greet the team.
Obadiah’s mouth dropped opened, bobbing open and close for some time as he tried to mentally parse through the situation he had found himself in.
“Could I borrow your phone while it charges?” Tony asked meekly as he finally remembered how to act like a human.
“Tony, you could have gotten either yourself or Steve hurt. What if Obadiah found out? What if he already knows? How did you meet the buyers without them recognizing you?” Pepper couldn’t help herself from inadvertently interrogating Tony.
“Tony…” Steve started. He looked downward, taking his hand away from Tony’s back to clasp it together with the other in his lap. He felt so terrible for possibly offending Tony, again.
worst fucking time to say this to you, but I’ve been trying to tell you this since we talked earlier…”
“Steve,” Steve looked downward to see that Peter was tugging at his pants, “…you can sit next to me.”
Tony grinned. “Okay, good. We’re taking the newest jet which is in an undisclosed area in Queens. I haven’t installed the GPS tracker in it yet, but let’s try
Steve took a moment, trying to remember the layout of the building before sprinting down another hallway, spotting an opening up ahead that overlooked the East River. He then, without thinking twice, backed away a few feet, clinching Tony as tightly as possible without doing more damage to his body, before he ran and jumped out of the opening. They landed in the water as soon as Thanos’s weapon exploded, sending a visible radius of the explosion throughout the campus and the surrounding area on the island. The blast retracted as the buildings caught in the radius imploded, sending a significant portion of Roosevelt Island into the water. Steve ducked himself and Tony under water as the island sank.
Tony followed Steve, now more determined than ever to make Steve more comfortable around him again, maybe to the point where he could make things right between them.
Steve nodded as he waited; it sounded as if Tony wasn’t finish with his thought. Tony sighed before scooting closer toward Steve. He rubbed Steve’s leg before placing one hand on the other side of his body.
Tony grinned widely. “Thanks for the confidence, Obie. You’re a real one.” He smirked with a wink, his tone dripping with sarcasm.
“I really don’t want to talk about, okay?” Tony looked intently at Bruce before looking back down at his tablet.
It was later in the evening, and Tony and Steve were standing in the former’s kitchen making dinner for themselves.
“Who’s this culprit who’s gotten you all up in a tizzy, Rogers?” Tony asked, resting his hands on his hips, finally acknowledging Steve’s uneasiness.
Tony placed a hand on Steve’s chest, looking up at him. “Thanks...Steve…uh…let’s leave early tomorrow…we can make up lab work later in the week…”
He thought maybe he could have a conversation with Tony about the way he had acted the night before but was afraid that the conversation would escalate beyond repair. He was also afraid he might beg Tony if they could get back together, but Tony’s actions suggested that he wasn’t willing to seriously commit, especially after trying to make a move on Steve while he was seeing someone else.
“I don’t see what’s so funny, you two.” Steve huffed as he looked back and forth between Tony and Peter with his arms crossed.
“Don’t worry about it,” Tony kept his hand out, “I’ll show you how.” His expression returned to its usual shade of confidence.
Steve grinned before sending an affirmative response. Although Sam had complained a few times about Tony’s behavior following the first failed simulation, Steve knew his friend had been secretly hoping to meet Tony.
Tony hung his head low, now unable to stop tears from streaming down his face. He leaned over the console, crying to himself.
“Yep.” Steve quickly answered, trying to mimic Tony but failing miserably, encouraging Tony squint his eyes at him with a sneer.
Steve was on his back on the floor in an instant, a knife pressed against his throat. "If you know what's good for you,
"You still think it's a bad idea." Tony didn't move from his Steve burrito, upset that they weren't on the same page but reluctant to lose contact regardless.
"I know, baby. I love you too, now would you keep going with what you are doing? Getting a little antsy here."
"You're right," Rhodey admitted. "Tony, you're right. This is your decision. Just hear me out, okay, man? Okay?"
Groaning, Tony lightly touched his cock, feeling the heat build. "Oh, Tash, you are good. You are so good."
He slowed and stopped -- chest heaving with the exertion -- lowering himself onto Tony's back, kissing every available inch of skin. As he caught his breath, he pulled out slowly, his cock coming free, a stream of come dangling from the tip to Tony's rim, his hand going down to feel Tony's hole as it quivered and contracted around the emptiness.
Steve grasped Tony's right leg, pulling it up to better fit his body against his own and slotted his left in between Tony's thighs. Slowly, he rubbed upwards, eliciting a throaty moan from the mobster.
When he finally makes it to the kitchen, it's to find Coulson at the stove flipping pancakes. The sight is bizarre; Tony isn't sure anyone had ever used the stove to cook. But it smells wonderful, and he sits at the table, sifting through what he's learned and the questions; he still had to come up with a topic that would be neutral enough not to upset him. He's still not quite over the breakdown he had upon waking. Nothing comes to him until they’ve almost finished eating. That's when Tony realizes that he knows nothing about Coulson's current charges.
"You said that." She spoke softly, coming to stand by the bed and studying her friend. He followed her with his eyes, looking for all the world like a deer in headlights.
"Bruce, just one drink! You'll see!" Howard moved to put his arm back around him. "I'm not a bad guy!"
"Can I preface this," Howard started slowly, "by saying that I realized I'm not angry that Tony is dating Steve? It just took me for a loop?"
The heat from the water was heaven on his body, but nothing compared to the way Steve had so gently placed him into the tub. Tony leaned forward so Steve could climb in behind him, and rested his back against Steve's chest, sitting in his lap.
one other person. Every product created by Stark Industries is wholly created by me. R&D comes up with some apps and some upgrades, but you're looking at the brains behind it all." He handed the tablet to Howard. "Don't believe me? Google it." He was like a peacock strutting, but all Steve saw was, 'Daddy, look at me! Look at me!' It made him ache inside to see Tony almost begging for validation.
Tony's giggling echoed along the walls of the workshop like the sun echoed across the glass windows of the tower. Beautiful and missed after a rainy morning.
Tony claps Clint in the back as they leave the range, "If it's any consolation, you're the only two."
Steve's heartbeat under his head was lulling, the steady beats giving him something to ground himself with. "Can't you just make love to me, in your stupidly sweet way, and we can talk about this in the morning?" That sounded like a damn good plan, right? They
Clint rocked his head back and forth, weighing how best to explain the situation. "He cast a magic spell, in 1961, on a pin Steve had given him. He set it up so that the pin would be returned to Steve and as soon as he touched it:
"Steve," he faltered, swallowing, "Steve gave me hell a few nights ago. Rightly so. I'm aware of how much Tony means to those around him, and I'm happy that despite what my future self does, he has that. But I assure you, I have no desire to hurt him. Not here. Not now. And I have every intention of doing whatever it takes to change how I raise him."
Bruce continued like he hadn't even heard him, "-They don't want well composed harmonies waxing poetic about love and loss." He sat back, giving her a small and kind smile, "I don't mean to burst your bubble. Really. But you need to face facts."
"Well," Thor started again, "you were on your own then. The label was jerking you around and…" he paused, "you didn't have me to fight in your corner. I'm sorry for that. But I can't change it now."
"Definitely. They know who's buying the most tickets. You'll do a 45 minute set; I recommend a mix of the old and new, because there will be some younger people there or an older crowd who could be swayed by a good live show-"
As he approached the door, Dum-E took a corner too sharply and knocked a handful of blueprints over. Howard flailed and jogged to pick them up, but Tony knocked before he could place them back on the table. Entering, Tony gestured to the blueprints. "Don't worry about it. Dum-E is a disaster. I'm used to it."
Rhodey rolled his eyes, signing at the ceiling, "Thanks for the vote of confidence." He knocked, three quick raps on the door, before keying in his personal code. He could go anywhere he wanted in the tower, another perk of being Tony Stark's best friend.
If she couldn't have it personally, she could at least attempt to give it to someone she cared about.
"I know you did something awful." She coughed, her body convulsing, the fluid sounding sickly in her lungs.
The thought of Steve sent a burst of happiness through him. Their day out had been so wonderful. Tony had felt protected, he felt joyful, he felt like a teenager again, getting to spend time with the person he liked.
Midgard had quickly become one of Thor's favorite places simply because it housed some of his favorite companions. He spent as much time there as he could because his fellow Avengers, mortal as they were, didn't have a millennia to live. He had a finite amount of time to enjoy their company and friendship, and he didn't intend to waste a single second.
Tony nodded as he stepped out of the elevator, grabbing Steve’s hand before leading him to the suite’s bedroom. As he opened the door, Tony felt Steve hug him from behind before turning him around for another kiss. Tony let Steve kiss him deeply and slowly before he turned them around again with Steve’s back facing the edge of the bed.
“It’s now a quarter after six, Sir.” Tony nearly jumped as J.A.R.V.I.S.’s impassive voice interrupted his mental gymnastics.
Before he could get to his apartment, Steve stopped abruptly, turning around suddenly before jogging back to the car. He knocked on the window a couple times before mimicking a revolving motion with his hand, the universal sign for rolling down a window before cars were completely automatic. Tony laughed as he pressed a button to roll down the passenger window.
As he was slipping into bed, Tony’s phone buzzed on his bedside table. He flipped it over to see that he had received a message from Steve.
The officer’s mouth dropped open as she glanced at Tony then the device then back at Tony before craning her neck to gawk at Steve. Tony nodded at her with a widening grin as the realization set in.
. Tony’s insides felt like a smorgasbord offering varying levels of pain. Hopefully, the smile he was wearing for Steve masked all of that.
Tony had acknowledged him once or twice while in the group. Something about it still felt timid, but Steve thought it was more related to Tony’s personality than anything else. Honestly, he was looking forward to getting the chance to work in Tony’s lab. Their short encounter together provided Steve with enough information to figure out a strategy to effectively engage Tony and any of his quirks.
Steve also enjoyed spending time with Sharon, but they hadn’t gotten to that point in their relationship where Steve could see a future commitment. Sure, they always had a nice time whenever they met up and Sharon was easy to talk to, but Steve didn’t feel the same way around her the way he had with Tony, although Steve had been lying to himself that he would eventually get there.
“Did Selvig send you these sequences?” Loki asked quietly as he pointed to a projection above the console which displayed the mysterious set of numbers. Clint walked up to the console to wedge himself in between it and Loki. Loki scoffed, clearly offended, as he turned around to face the rest of the group.
Tony’s body suddenly went still before he slowly turned around to face Steve. He looked solemn now; the cocky expression on his face had become stern.
Tony groaned as felt Steve from behind. He braced himself against the countertop as he let Steve give him a hug.
Tony sighed as he rested his hands on his hips. “What’s up, Banner? You wanted to show me something?”
He knew this would keep him up all night, so he figured maybe having a drink would calm his nerves enough to get a few hours of sleep. He took a moment before walking over to one of the cupboards to retrieve a bottle of aged whiskey before finding a glass.
“I’ll set up an appointment for the both of you to meet the therapist, sound good?” Mr. Beck’s expression remained the same as he rummaged around in his desk for a pad of paper.
. Sorry if that makes me sound naggy.” Bucky huffed as Sam nudged him in the arm again. “Also, stop jabbing me in my arm, Sam. I’m fully aware of how annoying I’m being right now.”
“I know we haven’t heard any rumblings from Thanos and his ilk in a while, but that doesn’t mean he’s not working on this weapon, especially now that we have this random-ass list of numbers…we need to proceed as if he’ll deploy it in the near future.”
Steve worried to himself, yet something about the phrase “with me” was a tad unsettling. As he ruminated on Tony’s question, Steve began to torture himself again over what he could have possibly done to ruin his relationship with Tony.
Tony’s eyes widened from the unexpected provocation, clearly surprised by Steve’s forwardness. Without further delay, Tony quickly removed his clothes before jumping in the tub, but before he stepped in, he turned around to ran back to the bathroom door.
Earlier that morning, Steve hadn’t felt anxious about his first day, but as the elevator zoomed past each floor in the tower, Steve felt his heart beat even louder. He exhaled deeply as the elevator arrived at his destination. He stepped out, looking each way down a long corridor. He took another deep breath; the moment had finally arrived.
“I apologize for Anthony’s short fuse,” a small smile marred his expression before he continued, “unfortunately, he’s been that way since he was a child, I’m afraid.”
Usually Tony appreciated flattery, but he knew Fury was only using it to get him to train Steve on the tech.
Tony closed his eyes and breathed deeply. “Thanks, J.A.R.V.I.S.” He answered back with a hint of annoyance in his voice. He gave himself another moment before walking to the foyer to greet Steve at the elevator.
Tony was standing in Bruce’s lab, examining a projected image of whatever they could surmise of Thanos’s weapon.
Steve sat up straight in his chair. “‘A Steve and Tony thing’?” He looked back and forth between his friends, “are you guys talking about me?”
Bruce sighed loudly as he removed his eyeglasses. “Your guess is as good as mine. We never got the numbers from Clint.”
Steve nodded, carefully holding Tony still so he didn’t accidentally rip up his bandages and rip out the tubes running to the machines.
Tony then wrapped a hand around Steve’s shoulders before making a move to lead him away from Thor and Loki. Steve sighed to himself with relief; he had become uncomfortable around Loki, trying to figure out where he might have seen him before.
Tony tapped on his earpiece, as he backed away from the microphone. “Romanov, Barton, and Thor, please be on the lookout for a herd of panicked nerds coming your way.” He then motioned for Steve to follow him off the stage, jogging back toward the conference room.
After a second, Gamora’s hand looked to be on the verge of squeezing the trigger, sending Obadiah into a wave of panic.
“Sorry I’m late. But you know the deal, Fury, when you asked me to work on this thing. I have other matters to attend to.” Tony smirked.
Steve nodded, knowing that Tony wouldn’t allow any more room for debate. “So, uh…,” he coughed as he continued watching Tony work, suddenly feeling his heart race, “I know you said you needed to figure out what your plans were for this weekend, but would you and Peter like to come over to my place for dinner?”
“You guys suck.” Steve tried to counter, but Sam and Bucky were doubled over one another laughing so loudly it nearly disturbed the other patrons.
“…when I was a lot younger…when we would spend more time here…I remember sneaking out of my room at night to watch my parents dance in the living room…”
“Dude, Buck,” Sam said immediately as he closed the door to the room behind him, “you need to relax and leave Tony alone.”
The elevator finally reached the penthouse and both Steve and Tony virtually fell out into the foyer as the doors popped open. Steve held onto Tony, gripping him tightly. Tony moaned even louder into Steve’s mouth, completely caught up in the moment. To regain some control, Tony placed his hands on both of Steve arms, trying to get him to slow down for a second.
Tony considered the statement against everything else they had encountered thus far. “Nothing is out of the realm of possibility, Banner.”
Steve opened the door to his bedroom before sitting on the edge of his bed. As soon as he sat down, he hung his head low with a sigh. He found his phone in his pocket, staring at it as he seriously considered cancelling dinner plans.
“I hope Sam didn’t give you too much shit about Saturday morning.” Tony was smiling, but he felt empty inside from trying to navigate his feelings.
Tony chuckled as he entered the kitchen, walking over to the island to ruffle Peter’s hair before giving Steve a hug.
Shuri and Bruce looked at each other, both appearing anxious and exhausted, before answering. “Maybe another few more weeks…” Bruce sighed, “…possibly a month at the latest…”
“Okay, so the food is done. Help yourselves. There’s probably more space out in the living room.” Steve motioned for Tony and Sam to grab plates. The three of them shuffled around until they were out in the living room: Tony sat on the couch next to Steve while Sam sat in an armchair facing them.
“Tony…we might have to implement the failsafe…” Tony didn’t have to be in the same room to feel Bruce staring at him intently.
Tony shook his head quickly. “No, I’m okay. I didn’t want you to think I was only thinking about sex now—or uh…” He cringed from accidentally saying his thoughts out loud.
“You really think so, Tony?” Pepper managed to convey how shocked she was with Tony’s allegation although she kept her voice low.
“We worked out the blast radius and no one is going to get hurt. I promise, Steve. Trust me on this.”
“Well I can tell that you’re a humble person, if that makes you feel less weird about me basically objectifying you just now.” Tony teased as he tried to interpret Steve’s dating history.
Tony waved the employee off before rapidly pressing the “close door” button through a surge of desperation.
As they drove along, Tony grinned a little too widely as he thought about Steve finally meeting Peter.
Steve blinked a few times before gauging the reaction of everyone else in the room. Both Clint and Thor appeared a bit perplexed. Natasha’s expression hadn’t really changed since Steve first met her and both Bruce and Tony were grinning uncontrollably.
Rhodey expressed confusion before settling. “I mean…you do look a little miserable…what’s going on?”
Tony nearly lost that edge as he willed away his thought, trying to focus on Steve. He reached downward for his cock, squeezing his eyes shut, thinking about coming all over Steve than telling him that he loved him.
“I feel like I could never get comfortable…maybe it was because we couldn’t see each other as much.”
“Be honest with me, Bruce. What do you really think of the algorithm?” Tony asked, adamant about changing the subject.
performance.” Tony ended with the sharpest edge to his voice, simmering on Steve’s erratic behavior.
Steve sat down awkwardly at the table, wondering if he should ask how Tony was doing since that morning. Tony sat down across from him, serving himself, appearing absolutely fine.
“You know…,” Tony started, smiling through another kiss as his hands traveled down Steve’s backside, “I could probably come from just rubbing your ass…”
As soon as the elevator doors opened into the penthouse, Tony threw his jacket on top of a statue. He groaned to himself as he retrieved his phone, looking at Steve’s contact profile while walking to the kitchen. He groaned once more as he reached the space, placing his phone on the island in the middle before stepping away, looking intently at it.
Steve laughed as Tony gently pushed him onto the bed, grabbing Tony to scoot up the bed to meet the headboard. Their clothes were scattered about the floor around the bed.
Steve gazed at Tony; his expression was soft and inviting, making Tony wished they were somewhere more intimate.
Steve was lying in Tony’s bed underneath the covers in his briefs, watching Tony as he emerged from the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his shoulders after taking a shower. While Steve felt more comfortable around Tony considering the current state of their relationship, he still felt anxious; although he had admitted to Tony that he was sexually inexperienced, he was afraid that said lack of experience would be more hindering than he had anticipated.
After a moment, Steve finally hopped out of the bed before making his way to Tony’s kitchen. There, he found a plate covered with some wax paper on the island in the middle of the kitchen. Steve walked to the island and uncovered the plate to find an omelet. He smiled to himself, thinking about Tony cooking for him. Steve settled at the island, eating as quickly as possible. After, he made sure to clean up the kitchen.
Tony shook his head with a coy expression. “You know we can’t talk about that. Government secrets or whatever.” He turned to a degree to grin at Rhodey who only rolled his eyes.
As each word left Steve’s lips, Tony’s body froze, so much so that he thought he had imagined it. Steve smiled at him, patiently waiting for him to respond, but Tony couldn’t. He thought by this point he would be able to say “I love you” out loud and here was Steve confirming their feelings for each other, but he couldn’t bring himself to say it.
An unexpected force nearly launched Steve out of the bed. He woke up instantly, turning to the other side of the bed to see that Tony was awake, out of the bed, and feverishly dressing.
Steve nodded as he approached Tony. He reached out a hand to rub Tony’s cheek before kissing him again.
After the karaoke ended, the gathering dispersed into smaller groups. Steve and Sam sat down on a couch near the middle of the space. Tony strolled over to sit next to them.
Tony then turned slightly away from Steve; he no longer felt the closeness he had been experiencing with him up until now. And Tony knew it was his fault; Steve hadn’t called him out on his poor response to his love confession, but Tony couldn’t think of a productive way to try to explain himself, especially since it had been several days since.
As Tony and Bruce entered the conference room, it immediately became apparent that there was something unfortunate hanging in the air.
Steve took his time pulling his jeans on before exiting the bedroom with Tony closely behind him. He tried straightening out his hair, but he knew it wouldn’t help the scene Sam was about to witness.
Shuri nodded slowly. A smile crept up onto her face, revealing a nice white smile. “I would just say
Tony shrugged. “I vacation there sometimes. But of course, it wouldn’t be a good idea to go there now. You know with trying to stay low while spying on international dealers and what not.” He waved his hand around.
Tony chuckled, but he didn’t sound as jovial as usual. “Uh, yes. Definitely. I’ll check with May if she can take Peter a few extra days before the wedding, but yeah, that should work out.”
“Hey, so,” Tony walked toward Steve, but he stopped short, “I know this is kind of last minute, but I’m having a thing at my place this weekend if you would like to stop by…?”
Suddenly, Tony stopped walking for a split second to seriously assess the statement, watching Pepper continue down the hallway. He figured that might usually be the case, especially when he was younger and overly confident in his genius. But Steve was good at what he does.
They walked with Steve inside the restaurant, sitting down at their table before ordering. They chatted for a bit about their family summer plans before Peter made a show of getting everyone’s attention.
Steve laughed with a huge smile as he leaned downward to kiss Tony. In that moment, it felt as if all the tension between the two finally melted away. As Tony held onto Steve at the waist to draw him nearer toward his body, pushing upward slowly, that vulnerable feeling resurfaced.
Tony tried to return the expression but his conversation with Obadiah and his weird chest pain turned his face into a half grimace.
Tony knitted his brow with irritation, but he didn’t pull away from Steve. “I’m your ‘friend’? Okay.”
“Sam, you’re one of Roger’s best friends, right?” Tony motioned for Sam to inch closer toward him away from everyone else at the bar. Sam took notice of Tony’s anxiousness, but played along.
The question sent a sharp pain through Tony's chest. He sat rigid in his chair, clenching the armrests with both hands before straightening up. He attempted to compose himself but Obadiah's unwavering smug expression and willingness to aggravate him at every opportunity was over running his composure.
Tony turned around with a huge grin on his face before he used his fingerprints to access the private express elevator.
Steve was able to keep up the ruse the rest of the night before leaving earlier than he had planned to with Sam in tow. He wished a good night to everyone, except Tony; he was too mortified to even face him.
“…so…uh…” Tony started, looking down at his hand which was now on top of Steve’s other hand before looking back up at Steve, “…it doesn’t sound like you and Sharon are serious…”
Tony nodded as it became clear that Steve was finished. He inhaled painfully before letting out a ragged exhale. Of course, Steve and Bucky were close; they grew up together, went to college together, served in the army.
There was more shouting and screaming as someone yelled that they could see someone lying on the ground in the lab.
Tony nodded back, nearly half-grimacing. “So, how do you know Steve?” He asked, hoping by some miracle they were just friends.
“Would you like to meet one of Synergy’s finest?” Tony clapped his hands once as he addressed the crowd. Everyone cheered and clapped again as Tony motioned for Steve to join him.
Steve smiled a little at Tony, but then his expression changed slightly as he hung his head, looking at his glass. Tony shuffled around, knowing he needed to be honest with Steve about running into Tiberius at the board event. He knew that seeing Tiberius had triggered all of his usual dating/relationship insincerities and he just hoped that Steve wouldn’t be upset with him.
Ever since Peter had created his comics that featured everyone they knew as various superheroes, Tony had been secretly working on the Iron Man suit. The idea had been intriguing; an armored suit that any person could use that had blasters and whatnot attached to it was something he could not pass up.
Steve groaned as he pushed inside of Tony, sitting up straight again before touching Tony’s cock. Tony squirmed as he felt Steve, losing his mind from how great Steve felt. They remained like this, Tony humping his body on Steve’s cock and Steve pushing inside of him, starting out slow before speeding up. Tony whined some more as Steve pushed harder into his body.
“Steve,” Tony took a step away from him, “I don’t think I can do this…I thought I could, but I can’t. It’s difficult enough working with you every day. I can’t even function normally whenever you smile. I totally screwed up, but I knew—know that this can’t work.”
Obadiah seized the moment as he grinned at Tony. “Speaking of Mr. Rogers. Part of the board’s decision is resting on the fact that
After some time, Tony finally calmed down, but all he could think about was how angry Steve was with him. He waited for some time, making sure Steve was out of view before talking to a few people, but before he could completely relax, Sam settled next to him.
A disgruntled sound caused both Steve and Bruce to turn around abruptly. They laid their eyes on a sullen-looking Tony making his way from the entrance of the lab to the other side.
With a nod, Riri lowered her arms at the same pace she had risen them, looking guilty. “I would check on your access codes, whoever installed them…they were easy to bypass…”
“We thought the first few cases might have been the flu, but then the symptoms turned into something more serious. This past week alone we’ve received more than fifty people at the clinic and the numbers are rising.”
Steve smiled and waved as he approached the car. Tony was standing next to it with the door open, looking shocked that Steve had followed him outside.
“Oh, I wouldn’t have expected that. That’s cool though.” Sam reached into the fridge to retrieve a beer for Steve who begrudgingly accepted it. He had promised his friend and he needed to follow through. Besides, he suddenly felt like celebrating anyway.
Bruce sighed before answering. “I’m not sure what to make of it, Tony. But it doesn’t look like the equations from the precinct explosion.”
Loki scrunched up his face, turning away to look at nothing before looking back at Thor who looked so solemn that it made him want to gag.
Tony grinned at Steve before walking to his bathroom. Steve watched the door close, listening for the shower.
“Steve, I really appreciate that, but please don’t beat yourself up over it,” Tony freed a hand to point toward himself, “it was my fault, okay?”
The device clicked, indicating that the main hatch to its hardware was open. Loki grinned as he proceeded to tinker around. Everything was going according to plan, until Loki came up against the failsafe Shuri had helped Bruce and Tony reconstruct. Loki grimaced as he tried to work around it, but he knew something about the failsafe would trigger a reaction. He tried to reroute the wiring, but couldn’t figure out the mechanics of the failsafe.
He then rose out of his chair, buttoning his suit jacket. “If there isn’t anything else to discuss, I would like to suggest taking the board to the Synergy labs to see some of the work thus far.” He kept his eye trained on Tony who only returned it with a toothy smile.
Steve gave him a small smile, not a real one, but a smile nonetheless. "It's okay. Tony, it's okay. I shouldn't have avoided you." And he walked away, back inside the tower and far from the man who loved him quietly.
"It's supposed to be a good thing!" Tony bursts out, his throat tight. "A huge honor! That's what Bridgette said!"
"He's not that fragile, Miss Potts." Clint was a little indignant on Tony's behalf. "He's survived this long for a reason. He's strong."
. The trouble came when they were dried off and got dressed, Tony continuously reaching out to touch Steve until they ended up a tangled mess on the couch across from Steve's bed, both shirtless and content to hold each other.
They're quiet on the way down, and aside from the night security guard at the front desk, no one else is around yet. Steve holds the door open for Tony and as soon as they step out, they're hit with a chilly burst of wind and a swirl of fat snowflakes. Pulling the collar of his coat up, Tony leads the way, taking a left out of the building and walking along Park Avenue. Tony allows the crunch of snow under their feet to fill up the silence between them for a moment before he speaks again. It's tentative like he's afraid of scaring Steve away, but he knows they need to talk this through. That the distraction will help for the interim, but after they build the snowman, Steve's problems will still be there. They have a ten-minute walk until they reached the park; if he could choose his words wisely, they could cover a lot of ground.
. "And no wheat products are allowed on the rest of the counters. We discussed it, and we all agreed." Tony nodded, running his hand over the marble.
God, how Steve had missed him. "You're really singing Grease? Now?" He gripped Tony's hips, giving them a little squeeze and a shake. "Sure that's what you want?"
If anything, fear was a good motivator, and he was beyond fearful of her after she had confronted him about his reaction to Tony and Steve's relationship. He could always
"Duh," he snatched the bacon and shoved it into his mouth. "All right, what have we got here?" He asked, picking up the bowl filled with scrambled eggs, "Cheese in this?" He could act okay.
About ten minutes later, a gentle knock on the glass alerted him to Clint, standing outside the workshop in Christmas pajama pants, despite it being February, and a Halloween t-shirt. He wore Tweetie Bird slippers and held two steaming mugs in his hand. Tony told Jarvis to let him in. It wasn't like he was working anyway.
Turning, Tony grabbed him and kissed him one last time, before he was gone, following his men up through a hidden exit. He looked back once, catching sight of Steve slipping through an open window to safety, and knowing he'd never see him again.
A line of police officers had set up a perimeter, and at the barricades three blocks down, after Steve had found two more civilians, he hastily handed them off to the cops. As he turned back, he felt the heat of the fire before he saw it. The dragon, with his mouth open wide, was burning a line down the center of the block.
The battle lost, Tony let the tears slip down his face. He tried for a joke, but all that came out was a stilted, "Boy, have you got me pegged."
We're getting into the meat of the story now, and I'd like to apologize for the delay in uploading. Hopefully, I'll have the next chapter by next Monday.
"Look, it's fine. He's gone now, right? Stevie here tossed him on his ass. I'm sure he'll think twice before he tries to grab someone's butt again." He paused, floundering for what to say. Boy, was he hating the subway even more! Forced interaction with strangers sucked donkey balls when he wasn't mentally prepared for it.
"So good, baby. You feel so good on me," Steve kept up the stream of praise, letting it rain down upon Tony like the silver condensation rolled on the windows. "So beautiful, so perfect."
In the kitchen, Bruce was pulling plates from the cabinet, he looked over his shoulder as they came in. "Dinner's done. I kept it simple. Just a quick stir fry. Set the table?" He held out a stack of plates, wiggling then gently. It felt so
Tony shot him an incredulous look, "I'll take 'Things that are never going to happen for 500,' Alex!’"
At some point, right after Steve had woken up, he would have been overjoyed to see a face from his past, especially this one. But at that moment, Steve could only let his eyes follow Tony's escape as he jerked free of Howard's exuberance and chased after the fleeing form of his boyfriend. "Tony, wait!"
He and Tony had such a fantastic time during their outing the other day that his muse was bubbling. There was another story here. And it needed to be told. His fans
"Is that..  Is it you?" The man's head whipped around, his eyes still bright after almost thirty years living on the streets. But Steve knew them like he knew his own. "Oh my God." He dropped to his knees next to him, reaching out but afraid to touch. Petrified that he wasn't real.
Steve likes how he says 'mutz' instead of mozzarella. He's only ever heard it in cities that boast a large Italian population, but the way it rolls off Tony's tongue is both adorable and attractive. "Definitely extra on the pickles."
"Thor, when are you going to call me Tony?" he responded, hovering by the coffee machine but thinking better of it. He had just brushed his teeth; it wouldn't do if he actually got to kiss Steve to have coffee breath.
When they're at last out of view, Steve sits forward, pulling his hands from his pockets and rubbing them through his hair. Elbows on knees and a rock in his throat. He wants that.
He hears the door open into his private living room, and the hallway light spills into his bedroom as Steve lets himself in. He doesn't move. Just keeps his gaze out toward the skyline, his back to Steve. If he can focus on the stars that make it through the ambient city light, then he doesn't have to think about Steve being in his bedroom.
Steve was cornered, his eyes going wide. He had a choice: leave and lose his one shot at the money he needed, or telling the truth and saving the most important person in the world to him. Decision made, he spoke. "My mother. She's sick. Consumption. Doctor says she needs the dry air, and we gotta move to Arizona. Need the expenses to buy a place. Need to take care of her."
The first spurt of Thor's come hit Steve on the face, surprising him. Thor cursed loudly in a language they didn't know, and bent his body to finish on Tony's ass, aiming for the wrecked hole. Steve let it gather, and pushed it in with the vibrator, his breath coming quicker at the mere thought of both Thor and Clint's spend coating Tony's inner walls.
It was Steve who spoke at last, "Okay," he started, still a bit hesitant, "Okay. But if this doesn't work, you let the issue drop."
Steve sat up, hoisting Tony to balance in his lap and removed his shirt, tossing it to the side of the bed. "Who you calling old, you geezer?"
There was so much to say. Steve felt the beginnings of a thousand words form in his throat and get stuck at the back of his tongue.
He was fully aware of how overprotective he could be. But someone had to. All those years before he had Steve to share the load with, worrying and worrying, fearing a kidnapping or attack. Afraid of Tony sleeping with the wrong person, or shutting down a business deal with someone dangerous, petrified that the man he cared for like a little brother would end up hurt or worse. It was awful.
Steve jumped, sailing out of his chair and falling hard on his ass with a loud grunt, the blanket tangling on the arm of the desk chair and sending it toppling over. He reached out for his shield to defend himself from the intruder, but only managed to knock it to the ground, where it comically rolled away and flapped to the floor, right at the edge of the bed. Right where Clint fucking Barton was sitting, legs pretzeled and hands tucked under his chin, smiling coyly. His grin widened when Steve glared at him.
Tony gives him a look of half-fondness and half-exasperation but instead flips it over again, looking at the bright paint.
“You’ll be happy to know that he already has an Omega visa for both America and Germany. It seemed his previous owner was quite fond of travelling between countries and brought his Omega along with him.”
Steve travels lower, digging his feet into the bed as he makes his way down, stopping just where Tony’s cock lay. He grins up mischievously, delighted as he find Tony already hard and leaking for him.
The man isn’t immaculate as he was in the picture, which bring some comfort to Steve. A hair out of place, clothes slightly crumpled, it somehow humanizes the man he’d seen on Time Magazine (He did a google search).
“He’s attentive after all, give him a round of applause ladies and gentlemen.” Tony’s grin is contagious.
Impatient fingers find their way to the hem of Tony’s shirt as Steve leans forward, burying his nose to the crook of Tony’s neck where his scent is strongest. A burst of fresh dirt, roses and steel, underlain beneath the smell of soap and shampoo, underlain beneath the smell of soap and shampoo. He groans as he is surrounded by it, something deep inside him flaring to life, demanding to be set free. He presses his lips to Tony’s neck, noting the groans from the Alpha as he sucks and kisses along skin.
The Curator follows after him, quickly lead off by Tony. He produces a paper with bank information. “The company’s bank account should suffice, if you’d like to copy it down-”
It’s a mess, SHIELD is in near chaos, Steve can smell the panic that wafts across the hallways of the helicarrier. Disarray in the Agents like he’s never seen before. Director Fury had briefed him about the situation on the cube, but not much else.
his friend, and this was something they could share. He reaches down, utters a sound of question. Clint bares his neck and let’s him scent, the soft scuffle of sheets and hair the only sound for a while.
Still, it made him feel like a fool, standing in front of actual men who’d fought on the field, those who have seen actual horrors. It had taken
Steve licks his lips as they dry at the memory, takes a shuddery breath and the sight of the cock in front of him instead. Tony’s not even hard, not yet anyway, which Steve want to remedy. He strokes the flesh appreciatively with his hands, a light squeeze when he gets to the base, which earns him a groan from Tony.
Small warehouse. Seized boats on the pier. The struggling Omegas. He submits himself to the process and tries to be as unbiased as he could with the report. Purely professional. He doesn’t let the anger of the bust pour through. The report would be used by whoever needed it, so he gave as much of the facts as he could. The size of the operation had been relatively small, but that only made them conclude that this was but a small branch in the scheme. That there were probably hundreds of these low-level smugglers scattered around.
After the fourth miss, Hawkeye calling out each shot, Steve feels a tap on his shoulder, signalling him to stop.
“I dreamed about Peggy once. Peggy, she, uh, she was a good Alpha, real forward thinker, didn’t beat around the bush if she could help it, I think the two of you woulda gotten along swell.” He explains. When Clint doesn’t make a sound he goes on. “We had a house in Brooklyn, dunno how we could have afforded it but we did. It was after the war, cos I had a medal of honor framed on the wall, and she had one too. We had two kids, a girl and a boy. Rachel and James.” He stops before his voice cracks.
“Very well. Dismissed. And you better cause any incidents or else I’ll have your ass dragged back to base.”
Inside is a bangle, small like a child's but somehow Steve knows it will fit his bony wrists perfectly. The design is nothing glamorous, plain all around except for three blue gems that glitter in the diner's light.
“Whatever, let’s just get this over with.” Tony relents, taking the pamphlet being handed out and walks ahead of them into the viewing room.
He also undertands that Tony is busy, much busier than he lets Steve know. And yet he agreed to seeing Steve through his Heat. There were just too many things that he didn’t know about Tony Stark.
“Hmm, but it’s no fun if you don't take a guess.” Tony actually pouts at him but continues anyway. “It’s from Wakanda, a relatively small nation but technologically advanced in their ways. It’s often contemplated that Wakanda was one of the first nations to educate their population equally, regardless of orientation, and they were better off for it. Imagine that? Alphas, Betas and Omega receiving the same education as early as the eighteen hundreds?”
“Holy shit.” He gasps, finding it hard to breath, and his dick can’t quite agree to whether this position is less or
Tony could imagine that, a younger Stevos, running around, determined and stubborn, defiant even if he were smaller. He smiles at that and prods on. “Did you ever go on that quest?”
Steve laughs and sniffles, circles his arms over Tony’s body, rubbing his wet cheek on Tony’s shoulder, muttering thank you until it turns unintelligible over his stammering.
Tony makes a motion to leave, but Stevos grabs his arm. It’s not enough to keep him there, and Tony considers just leaving anyway. But some part of him carries the guilt of his actions, the part that hasn’t been eaten away by bitterness suggests that he stay with Stevos, as a repentance.
(He doesn’t know it’s because his Ma had to sell their house to pay for the debt that his Dad owed.)
“I wasn’t always like this.” Stevos starts, motioning at himself with his free hand, careful not to jostle Tony from his position. “I was once a demi-god, half-god half-mortal. My mother, Athena, fell in love with my mortal father, who held the position of Captain in the army. He was a soldier, first and foremost, excelled in battle, brandished a sword with mastery, and commandeered the hearts of men when he spoke.” There was almost mock pride in Stevos’s voice. “But when he was thrust with a child, he floundered.”
“Pepper, she’s going to want to know I’m safe and alive. Mostly because it would mean a fuck ton of paperwork for the company.”
“No, it’s uh- Sorry.” Steve abruptly stops the nervous thumping of his foot, and rubs his sweaty palms over his expensive pants.
that rouses Steve from sleep. He blinks in the darkness, light slowly brightening to ease him from slumber.
“Oh, fuck you, Steve Rogers, you know exactly how much I liked it.” Bucky barks, challenging in just the way that he knows Steve can’t resist but bite back. “Question is, if you can come into terms of liking it.”
He remembers when they had to hike three miles from their makeshift camp to get any reception for their radio, in some desperate attempt to send a message to base, and even then it crackled like a bitch and there was always the threat of being intercepted.
Steve curls in on himself as he orgasms, body suddering in waves of pleasure, coming all over his chest in spurts, he can feel the wetness of his slick dribble out of his hole, pants turning sticky with his fluids.
Tony laughs, fast and unbidden, and Steve joins him until they’ve got tears in the corner of their eyes, fighting to catch their breath as Tony leans on Steve’s shoulders for support.
“Get in here Tony, before I maul you.” He breathes, shifting on his back to have a better look at him.
Which is strange in itself, being able to read about himself in book, almost as surreal as dying. He feels near anxious about the things they’ve gotten right and takes some comfort on the details they’ve gotten wrong.
But the dark lines are harder to ignore when they appear like spiderwebs over his chest. The last straw is when his chests starts to burn up and steam rises from underneath the plate.
, my fucking jaw, holy fuck did I lose a tooth?! Fuck, fuck, fuck, it hurts.” Justin wails, which sets about a commotion.
Tony dumps himself on the workshop couch, tumbler of health juice brought along as he down the rest of it.
“Oh my god, you’ve gone feral, haven’t you?” It’s a question, one he ignores as he grumbles in disappointment. But not for long as rough fingers plunge into his hole, massaging his insides with almost tactical precision.
“Just needed a small word with Stark, nothing to be concerned about.” Fury says, as if he read Steve’s mind. “He’s expecting you inside.” With that, Fury claps him on the shoulder and takes his leave.
Steve nearly jumps in surprise. “No. It’s alright.” There’s still another seat for Tony, and he’d feel awful if they’d hogged all the seats.
“Just don’t. Break anything.” Tony says in a tone that makes Steve huffs, as if he needs to be told, shoulder hunching up defensively.
To Steve’s credit, he manages to hold in a cringe. He’s seen the 'memorabilia’ in his image. From pop art comics, tin boxes and statues, it felt strange to see Captain America in almost every form imaginable. People wore shirts with designs of his shield, in hundreds of different ways.
When he’s said all he has to say, he feels more tired than ever, more exhausted than he thinks he has been in a long long time. But it feels like a step in the right direction, as daunting as it sounds, towards a direction. He hates being lost, and now he wants to find his way again. He wants to be
“Military. It’s-” Steve shakes his head, wanting some excuse to not talk about it. “I know the type, military Alphas establish the pecking order, set things straight in a unit. I’m not saying they’re awful at their job or anything but sometimes they just-” He rubs his eyes wearily.
He can almost see the tick in his father’s jaw, the narrowed eyes, the usual amount of perception with everything he does, held underneath a microscope and examined, molecule by molecule.
Also, again, I feel like I need to say this just in case some people missed it, but the fic is entirely based on Steve's point of view.
Was that what Tony had been hoping for? Two Omegas by his side? He could certainly support them both, as was so bitterly thrown earlier.
But it never did happen. On inspection of his room on his first day, there was a set of pencils on the desk, a straight line of blue and black, from 7H to 7B, and a stack of sketchbooks, neatly laid out for him. Steve never did quite know how to thank Tony for the gift, because the Alpha had never mentioned it.
Jasper motions for him to follow, so Tony does, still a little confused with it all, as they walk through yet another part of The Gallery.
They make their way to Stark Tower, and Tony is dismantled from his suit. And just as Steve had predicted, his side is caked with blood, dark over his undersuit. Steve doesn’t miss the wince Tony peels it off his body.
The heat in his belly is intolerable, and before Steve knows it, he’s coming all over the sheets, clenching on Tony’s dick like he was made for it. He hears the tell-tale grunt, the gush of hot liquid inside of him as he feels Tony’s knot lock them together, inflating to the point of burn, pressed inside him ball deep as Tony empties himself into the Omega’s hole.
Steve leaves tomorrow. He knows that, he dreads it, and somehow coming back home (home?) brings that realization to the front of his mind.
She’s also very pretty, impeccable, the kind of dame that he would have assumed was with someone like Tony Stark from the magazines. It also doesn’t help his nerves that she’d seen both him and Tony naked together. He’s still a bit embarrassed, there’s no helping it all.
“Yep, no one was happy about that either, Omegas were the best baby makers around.” Tony nods, like consoling a child. “The three tiers basically mean potency, how much hormones and pheromones are being produced by their bodies.”
Savagely, his plunges two fingers in his hole, scissoring himself open as he slows his own hand, groaning as his cock pulses in response. His brain has all but turned off, the fog of Heat upon him, the desperation to be fucked so overwhelming it’s all he can think of. He growls in desperation, adding another finger to his hole, furiously massaging and stretching himself open for something,
“Where- I wasn't-” He sputters, still caught between the throes of the cold and harsh reality as everything comes crashing back to him. He was in the future, where there were LED television, computers and robots and-
“Is that so? Me and my boys just want a good night ourselves, and I think this would do just the thing.” He runs a hand over the bike’s seat. “C’mon. Couple of faggots like you don’t deserve something as nice as this.” The man makes a point to say, a slimy smile on his face.
His shooter is already making it down the path, gun ready to finish the job. The man yells something at him, but it becomes apparent that Tony doesn’t understand him, no doubt his impatience will run out and he’ll kill Tony for all the trouble he has caused.
It’s a tense minute, waiting for his machines to remove the rest of the armor, before they basically magnetize back together, Stevos seems much more desperate than before, a new bite to his kiss, an aggressive tongue between his lips. His fingers are near claws with how to grip onto Tony, digging into his flesh where he holds him, yet doesn’t draw blood even if it feels like the desperation ought to.
“May I?” He motions with his head, indicating towards his scent glands, located on either sides of his neck.
“He sounds like a good man.” Steve smiles, catching the warm expression on Tony’s face, soft and mellow.
“I’m open to suggestions.” Even as Tony tries for casual, Steve twists his thumbs on the band of Tony’s loose pants and does little more than play with the fabric.
Commander Fury took him aside and explained that Tony Stark was already on base, but he needed to have a conversation with him first, before the Scenting. Steve nodded. He probably couldn’t have stopped it even if he wanted to.
Except apparently some super secret spy guy comes to talk some sense to him, and Pepper’s hot legal assistant jabs him with drugs that make breathing easier than it has been in months.
) “High-level. At the end of the day, it means hormones, charts and numbers, along with a subset of standards that people can place you in. Aggressive, over-protective, rut-triggered, Fight-driven, to name a few. No one tells you that to your face, no, they nod and agree, they stay quiet, but all of them are just waiting for you to fail, just one misstep to blame it all on biology. Because why not, an
The information isn’t divulged to him, instead Steve hears it in hushed arguments just by the door, and whispered growls that they exchange when they think he’s passed out in Heat-exhaustion.
He curls up next to the Alpha after cleanup, breathing in his warm scent, the sudden weariness that comes after sex demanding to be sated with sleep. The buzzing in his mind quiets to a murmur, worry and anxiety melted away from his bones.
Steve's head snapped up, and he smiled, but it was worn and forced. Tired and strained. Tony felt something clench inside him. This was his fault.
It was Steve's turn to look offended, "There's nothing nasty about it," he said, letting Tony go to get the glasses for the juice, "Bruce, as a man of science, you should know that intercourse is-"
“Pretty much.” Tony says with an uncaring shrugs, opening and closing his hands like a child, motioning for the shield.
(There’s another kid in the orphanage who’s also named Steve, so the others call him by his last name instead.)
tell me you’re going to the gala with me. Pepper might set me up with another date, and having your Ex pick your dates is, in itself, a new bar for pathetic.”
As the week would go on, the urges of Heat would taper off towards his last wave, where he would be most desperate. It was still days away. Surprisingly, Steve didn’t feel particularly worried, trusting that Tony would see him through. The Alpha had been nothing but
“Help the civilians. You are not at a hundred percent right now.” He grunts, even while he narrowly avoids a drone headed straight for him. “It’s less for me to worry about. Take out the drones on the ground, make sure everyone gets out alive. That’s an order, soldier.”
That was just incredibly unhelpful. Steve thought, an inkling that JARVIS was enjoying this back and forth a little too much. “Err, well. It’s about a couple of hours to dinner time. Does Tony have any food restrictions?”
Steve snarls when the man tries to pull him off his cock, sucking so hard that he can feel the Alpha’s moan through his cock. There’s a sharp tug to his hair and he stops, pulls off the Alpha’s cock with no doubt swollen lips, panting for air and looking absolutely ravished.
“It was a nightmare.” Steve admits. There's no point alluding to it, he knows it's there. He still remembers the first night he woke up like this, drenched in sweat, confused and too cold to move. As far as he knew, he didn't normally have them for too long, or at least S.H.I.E.L.D. hadn't noticed or thought much of it.
Steve blinks. Slowly, he moves just the slightest towards Tony, who maintains a stoic gaze on the door handle.
Just watching Tony maneuver the kitchen is surreal enough, even if it’s something as simple as chopping away at the brown lump, turning them into smaller chunks. In fact, he hadn’t been sure Tony even used the kitchen, everything had been far too pristine when he had first started using the kitchen, he had doubted that it had seen much use before him. Maybe he’d been wrong though, Tony seems to know where the everything was, as he pushes the chunks into the steaming milk, taking out a whisk next to lightly mix the pot.
Steve likes to see the best in people, a way for them to show that they could be more than they appeared. Others might not have given him the same opportunity, but that did not mean he would let bitterness cloud his judgement.
. “What? Did you think SHIELD has Harley-Davidsons just lying around for ninety year old to joy ride?” He scoffs. “It was dad’s. Or yours now anyway, since he left it for you in his will. When the bike’s tracker didn’t coincide with your phone’s, Jarvis assumed something was amiss.”
Tony sits through most of it, watches as people bid for the Omegas, each one brought up to the stage, still naked. They go anywhere from a hundred thousand to two hundred. He almost feels sorry for them, how they must feel to just stand there and be stared at. And with each successful bid, there’s a smatter of polite applause for the winner.
Omega yet. So, instead of forming a permanent triad of Alpha, Beta and Omega, they look for Omegas who can satisfy Cara’s desires.”
“No. It’s alright.” Steve quickly interjects, feeling foolish for being treated like a child who was lost. A small voice tell him that that was what he had become, ever since waking up but he hushes that with a practiced smile.
without you.” One of the women quips, after a chuckle at Tony’s comment about her fourth Omega within the month.
With his territory checked, Tony rounds back towards Steve, shucking away his clothes while he does so. Clever fingers undo the buttons of his suit and undershirt, clothes discarded on the floor as he gets closer and closer to Steve.
JARVIS had been deactivated in his room during heat, a matter of privacy, but now that it was over, Tony had reactivated him. It was still a better convenience to have the AI help him without bothering Tony.
“Twenty fifth, actually. There was a slight complication that had to be settled at short notice.” He thought it redundant to ask whether Tony was keeping tabs on him. He already knew that JARVIS could break into SHIELD’s network, almost on whim.
“Oh no. His papers are still in-process. I’ve moved it up the priority list however, it will be another hour before it’s finished. No, no. Oh, you’ll see, I think you’ll be quite pleased.”
“It was real nice to meet you, Happy.” Surprised by the genuinity of it, despite only knowing the driver for less than a day.
He doesn’t know why it hits him just now, because he should have known ever since he’d step foot in the Stark premises, but it does. He knows, really
By the end of it, she managed to land five hits (according to Hawkeye) on him and incapacitated him once while he only hit her three times (Four, but he was not going to count when she pretend to be unconscious just so that she could wrap her legs around his neck into another submission hold). There had been little hope to pin her down, not with the way she maneuvered herself. It was humbling in a way, and frustrating in others.
Scenting was a small ceremony, performed by the Alpha and Omega if a contract constitutes it. Optional at best, as there were no definite findings that a successful Scenting meant that the Alpha or Omega got along, though research has shown that it had a high percentile of success if done properly.
When he finally allows JARVIS to run diagnostics on his arc reactor, it’s not good news. The palladium core, the very thing powering the arc reactor and keeping him alive, was slowly poisoning him.
"I'll get better." Tony says with certainty. "Which leads to the second thing I wanted to talk about. Would you like to go to South Korea with me?"
case, again, Agent Barton was suppose to be of assistance.” Phil shakes his head, looking suddenly fatigue. Steve can emphasize, it was the look he got when Bucky would mysteriously disappear from a mission.
It’s polite, he thinks, the way Tony hovers between his doorframe, like he’s not sure if he’s allowed.
“Colluding with my Omega, are you?” Tony gurgles through the coffee, both eyes still closed. Steve wonders how he can even talk around the cup at all. Tony grabs one of the sandwiches, takes a curious bite, and then scarfs it down.
“I think so?” Steve has to wonder why it was that Tony was going on and on about this. Yes, he understood that Wakanda had practically spat in the face of the war at the time, specifically at the America for handing over such a thing in the first place. Like handing over a candy wrapper to a hungry beggar, almost goading.
Tony prowls, circles to the side of the bed and sits just by the Omega’s back, he runs light fingers on the Omega’s back, feels the heat that comes off from him in waves, hot and sticky in the air.
Bruce held his hands up, trying to diffuse the fight before it escalated. "Whether or not Tony was abused isn't up to you to decide, Steve. And it's neither here nor there at this point. We have a unique situation in which the man that may or may not-" he glanced at Tony, placating, "-have abused Tony in his future is here now, and not only is he fully aware of what he did, but he's pre…" he faltered, struggling to find the right words. "Pre whatever he turned into."
Rhodey took a bite of the cookie he ordered, chewing thoughtfully before he answered. "You are always so against the notion that you were, but anyone who knew you -- like
"Excuse you, I'm a fantastic chef," Steve patted Tony's belly, "no complaints here!" Tony could tell Steve knew something was up and he was grateful he didn't mention it.
But that didn't mean what they were going to do couldn't be special. It didn't mean he couldn't make it so good that the memory would keep him warm, even in the dry heat of the deep South.
His own fingers were pulsing against his prostate, and his right hand was flying up and down his cock, periodically flicking over the tip.
But he can't. He doesn't know why. Doesn't understand why he's squandering his second chance, but he just can't say it out loud. It's a promise broken, he's fully aware, but when he attempts to formulate the words on his tongue, nothing happens.
"Made a deal with him last night. Said I'd deal with the frat party if he used his culinary genius." Rolling over, Steve grabbed Tony's pillow and shoved it under his head. "Didn't say a time though."
"No," she said smugly, "but if you don't back off the questions about him, his actual lover is going to rip your balls off."
"There's no controlling this, Agent Romanoff, it's out there and there's video proof. Experts have been called into news stations to run facial recognition, the video and subsequent photos have been studied. They know it's Howard Stark."
For dinner, Steve made a meatloaf with the chopped meat. He was adding the bread crumbs when Bruce entered the kitchen.
"Good move," Bruce supplied, "that's like bacon sausage. From what I hear, you're kind of obsessed."
"Steve," he breathed out, moaning as Steve took his lips again. His hips rolled, knees spreading further apart to bring him closer.
Steve grabbed the sides of Tony's face, yanking him down to shove his tongue in his mouth, unable to control himself as his hips jutted up, slamming into Tony, his movements completely involuntary at this point. "Come on, doll, let me see you come," Steve purred, feeling the familiar tightness in his balls and willing himself to hang on, just a little longer. "I've missed seeing how beautiful you are when you come."
"Okay," Tony says suddenly, sitting up, "I appreciate the info dump, I do. But I can also read my way into these books and come with any clarifying questions later. So, how's about
"Good morning! I just need to check your vitals, get some info, then the doctor will be in." She busied herself at the counter for a moment, snapping on fresh gloves and picking up an ear thermometer. "Your temperature first," she said, and Tony tilted his head for her to put it in his ear. "99.6. A little high, but not bad. Can you take your hoodie off for me? I need to do your blood pressure."
She could sit there forever. At first, she had lamented the loss of her own youth. Envious that she would never get the chance to have her hot Massapequa boyfriend bridal carry her onto the drunk train or be able to lean on her best friends and navigate the steps together, speaking along with the automated voice as the train pulled away.
"Fuck." Tony had no choice. He'd have to make a run for it. It would have been a triumph of agility, lunging over the couch again like he did, except Steve made a grab for him and he, well. Tony zigged when he should have zagged, as the saying went. And he tumbled over, coming to rest at Howard's feet.
He was halfway across the kitchen, set on getting a glass of water from the filtered tap before bed when Howard popped his head out of the guest room.
Tony's mouth is opening and closing, unsure of what the heck is going on until he hears the name of his dead friend. "Yinsen? He's here? Is he okay? Can I see him? Wait, I don't think he's Christian—Come to think of it, I'm not—"
Rahib laughed, his face friendly as he loaded the brown cardboard food boxes with the hot dogs. "That's fifty, but for you, my beautiful friend, I charge forty."
Thor chuckled, "I have been alive a long time compared to you. But I am still young among my people. Still learning."
It took all of ten seconds before he was exploring. Steve had said to stay, not that he couldn't look around. He needed to know when in time he was to begin with, and knowing exactly where he was, well, that was pertinent information as well. He
Steve's hand slid around Tony's waist, pulling him closer, and moved his head to kiss down Tony's neck. Tony sighed, tilting his head to better accommodate, and let out a groan that had the soldier gripping him tighter; Steve felt so warm. He licked a line up Tony's neck, pulling back to speak. "I like you in my clothes."
Of course it was still unsettling that the the rest of the team had found the stories (or Tony had found them and shared, but even that sent a tingle down his spine.). They all were seeming to enjoy them and it did lead to Tony telling them all the he was bisexual.
"Then Steven would take Anthony again. And you, my dear friend," Thor said to Clint with a lascivious grin, "would sit on Tony's erection and ride him until
Tony's eyes went round, he felt a sting and blinked, willing the tears away. He was too old to cry over his father, had been through too much to let old hurts bring him back down. "Howard, I…" His throat was closing, and he fought desperately to quell the panic rising up within him. "Because, you… Fuck, Howard.
"Any of it!" His voice was rising, the pitch wavering back and forth between fury and something sad and filled with longing. "What the fuck did you think you were doing?" The anger shot out, like the spittle he ejected as he said it, flying across the room and making Howard flinch back.
"That's okay. You can have it. Looks better on you," Steve remarked, reaching over Tony's head to lift the can of Chock Full o' Nuts and hand it to him. Tony almost went red at the statement. Almost.
For the first time since he was young, he was left feeling guilty. And it was for something he hadn't even done yet.
"In that case, see if Thor would like some tea as well. And ask if all the pizzas have pineapple on it, because if they do, I have a Hot Pocket with my name on it."
Tony laughed outright at Tasha being referred to as a dame. She'd skin him alive if she ever heard him call her that. "Everyone knows Tasha is loyal to me. No, I need someone not on the payroll, officially that is. You are not
A creature of habit when he's not in the field, Clint lifts his phone to dial, but an affronted JARVIS stops him. "Do you see me trying to shoot a bow and arrow, Agent Barton?"
Tony made a face, he was trying to! But he really didn't feel like discussing the finer nuances of StonyFan1918's writing. He wanted to experience it instead. So, he lied. "Not yet, in the middle of project."
him? - but now, oh shit. Now it's worse. It's so much worse. He needs to deflect. Can't let Steve make the biggest mistake of his perfect American life.
"Thanks," Tony said, turning away from the pot and facing Thor. "Have you seen Steve? I need to talk to him."
Tony sat up and slid his right leg over Steve to straddle him, "Feeling horny? Is that better? Because I don't think it is, but if that's what you want to call it-"
With nothing else to do aside from waiting, he made his way into the bathroom to shower, all the while contemplating just how bad it would be if Howard found out about his and Steve's relationship. He could be furious and that, Tony supposed, was the most likely. Things were different back then, abjectly so if the beginnings of his and Steve's affair was anything to go by. Steve had been terrified of being found out, had tried to hide his attraction behind cool words and avoidance of Tony all together. It wasn't until Tony had dragged him to NYC Pride that it began to sink into Steve's handsome head that the world really was more welcoming of same sex relationships. There was a long way to go, of course, and they finally compromised by coming out to their friends but not to the media and the public.
"Don't start, please. I'll...I'll think about it." It wasn't a yes, but it was better than they had got before whenever seeing a doctor was brought up.
with Howard. Natasha didn't seem to mind; she was almost encouraging it. But what she thought wasn't what mattered. This was about Tony - and Steve to a lesser extent.
Natasha grabbed the mic and handed it to the paparazzi behind her. Tony smirked, ducked his head, and got into the car. He was really grateful for her.
Rolling to his side, Howard groaned and covered his face. Seeing the footage of the attack was horrifying. The blue beam pointed to a split up sky, the twisted visages of the Chitauri as they attacked Manhattan. The wreckage and carnage, the piles of dead. And Tony. His own flesh and blood, a man whose brain, logically speaking, was worth more than any common civilian, flying up to his own death to save them all. And somehow miraculously surviving. The luck of the Starks continued.
The young man on the seat stood threateningly, "I'll throw them out just like Captain America threw out that prick. Fucking try me."
"Hey!" Steve started with a pleased look, "That's my old pin!" Tony gave him a confused look and Steve explained, "I was part of the art club, one of the only things I could do."
"You know Tony wouldn't have been okay with that. And he would have caused issues. Because he's Tony, and that's what he does." Tapping her fingers on the table, Nat tilted her head. "So how much trouble are we in?"
He sighed heavily. "And nothing. I like it. Even if you do hate me." Shrugging, he held his hands out. "Just an observation?"
Steve leaned down, "You can kiss me." He knew Tony needed contact, and not just any; he needed to feel loved and appreciated without any obligation. Contact he never received from Howard. Until they were able to get his father back to his own time, Tony's mental health was probably going to be as up and down as the March weather. Steve needed to do what he could to stabilize it.
With nothing more to say, Steve left him, entering his room silently and letting the door click behind him. He let his enhanced hearing follow Howard down the hallway and waited until his own door shut before texting Tony and dropping his head back against the door. The important thing now wasn't being angry with Howard. It was reconnecting with Tony, something they both needed.
She nodded, "The different vegetables at least give Tony some variation. Potatoes? Turnips? Those would go well."
The man had his back against the glass doors to the landing pad and was hastily feeling around for the door handle, while Barton did his best to keep Romanoff from disemboweling him. Banner was nowhere to be seen, and that was probably for the best because Thor
"Up, come on, babe." Steve gently coaxed him. "Did we ever actually cook before this?" He asked Clint as Tony gingerly sat up.
Tony looked up at him, taking Steve's hand, his own trembling. With a tight smile, Steve kissed his head and led them into the other room, projecting a wall of unity. She watched them, feeling the earlier elation at their regrouping slip away to nervousness. It wasn't just Howard being stuck in the wrong time, it was Tony's future as well. If Howard couldn't go back, were they going to lose Tony?
"And what about you?" Bruce asked astutely. Tony could hear the clanking of beakers and phials, and he found himself missing his workshop and Bruce's lab, quiet nights bent over their experiments, joking with each other and doing eighth grade science projects just for the fuck of it. It had been days since he let himself fall into the security of his work. Howard had derailed any attempt he made.
He blinked again, free arm still raised defensively, finally getting a clear look at the figure in front of him, who must have been the reason for the flash.
Next chapter is back to the fun with Tony! And OH THE FUN! After that it's one more chapter. That's it! Unless you guys want one more interlude in between them, please let me know in the comments!
With that in mind, he literally sauntered into the common kitchen after Jarvis informed him that Steve was home, because if you got it (the hoodie, that is), you flaunted it. "Evening, Cappy." He stalked up to the coffee maker and made sure to purposely walk in front of Steve. Let him try!
Which left Natasha to rally up Tony the next morning, dragging him from bed (because of course he stayed up waiting for the phone call), and dumping him rather unceremoniously in the shower.
Howard Stark was nothing like he'd pictured him. Most of the photos he had seen showed an older Howard, white hair and mustache, skinny, and distinguished. Always with a drink or a cigar. He had met the man only a few times while at MIT. Brief interactions that usually involved him dragging Tony away for some ridiculous reason in the middle of the night. Some research, some
He knew, after this, that he was ruined for anyone else. No one could come close. No one could ever make him feel like he was at that moment.
"Fuck yeah," Tony groaned, leaning back into the chair and lifting his legs again, "fuck me until I'm leaking, Doctor." Steve moaned, pressing his palms, fingers pointed down, on the backs of Tony's thighs and sliding down to cup his round and large ass, squeezing and kneading the skin. His face, hovering above Tony's, moved closer to nuzzle into Tony's hair.
"I'm glad my childhood obsession is so funny to you!" But Tony is laughing with him. It's nice to hear Steve laugh, just as nice as it is to see the way the orange sky reflects off of Steve's hair and the way the streetlights glitter in his cerulean eyes. The blue of his irises complements the sky in a way that has Tony's breath catching.
hard at first for me, because Peggy was still alive but she had Alzheimer's, and it meant things were always rough when I went to see her. And she had lived a full life in my absence, you know?" Howard nodded, understanding dawning on his face. "But you? You are in the same predicament as me. I… I
"We can adjust," Bruce said, taking the black coffee and nodding his thanks, "I'm less worried about Cedar Park and more worried about Chicago. I didn't like their security last time."
Leaning onto the counter, Steve gripped the edge and squeezed his eyes shut. He felt any lingering respect and friendship he had for Howard slip away. Even the memories of laughing with him and Peggy couldn't save how he felt. It was almost as if Steve had been holding a photo of Howard and it had melted slowly over his relationship with Tony, and within the last hour, had disintegrated completely. All at once, the man he knew became a stranger.
"No!" The voice came from nowhere, and Steve felt his heart drop. They had left him in the tower, where they thought to keep him safe, but Howard Stark wouldn't be who he was if he didn't take unnecessary risks. "Get away from my son!"
"I appreciate the honesty. Okay," Tony turns to look at Hill, giving her a dazzling smile, "What do you have for us, honeybuns?" She looks like she wants to claw his eyes out, but all it does is entertain Tony that much more.
It was only partially the reason they were not 'out,' so to speak. The less the bad guy's knew, the safer Tony was. Tony would say the same about Steve. The other reason was because of Tony's importance to the tech world and his company. Being gay was definitely more accepted in the new millennium, but not nearly enough. Not yet.
Steve was waiting by the door when they walked up, an embarrassed grin on his face. "I, uh, didn't think this through." With his elbow, he gestured to the closed door.
?" Oh damn. Tony's eyes looked a little wet. This was more serious than he could ever have imagined. "Would it help if I said I'm sorry?" He tried, holding his arms out in concession.
"Fury will be here soon," Hill warned, "so not too much longer. Have JARVIS alert them at least. And Dr. Banner and Thor?"
"I bet you that as soon as I touch you here, your eyes will close, thus proving that this-" he pointed to Tony's hole, "-is connected to these." His finger trailed up through the air to point to Tony's eyes.
Tony wrapped his legs around him, holding onto Steve's shoulders and laying a chaste kiss on his neck. "Glorious, glorious porn."
It wasn't like Tony didn't keep lube in the workshop. He kept it everywhere. I mean, you honestly just didn't know when the right moment would just...pop up.
"Regardless," sitting up straight, Rhodey made sure he had Tony's full attention before continuing, "the more I think about it, the more I think she's right. This is a rare opportunity, Tones." Tony looked uneasy but gestured for Rhodey to go on. "I only met the guy briefly on the way in, but from what Romanoff and Barton said, he's not a monster yet."
"Oh." Tony sits back, thinking. "Because they had my weapons; because they were bad people. Because...Because I didn't want anyone else to get hurt."
Tony could never stay annoyed when he was kissed. It was Steve's secret weapon, though he mostly used it to rouse him from sleep.
Steve couldn't have chosen a better person to align himself to. Stark or not - Howard was learning that a name really meant fuck all - Tony
"Earth's mightiest heroes, my ass." Steve glowered, and turned, holding tightly to Tony and walking off the jet.
She smiles, her hand coming to brush his hair away from his forehead. "It means 'kitten.' It's a term of endearment."
Sometimes, she got off at Farmingdale and took an Uber with the girls to the all night diner for fries and mozzarella (mutz-zi-della, she would say, to fit in) and brown gravy. Other times she would hop into someone's Civic and race off to the beach to watch the sun rise with them, sipping on wine coolers and eating 7-Eleven packaged fruit and sandwiches, seated on a sandy blanket pulled from the trunk of the car, her heels left on the floor of the backseat.
Steve emerged from the bathroom moments later, shaking his hands dry and grinning indulgently. "I carried you to bed."
"Don't you stop, don't ya dare fucking stop!" Tony demanded, hooking his hands under his knees to open himself up further.
He was expecting a monster, some alien lifeform sent to wreak havoc on the city. He was not expecting Howard Stark, looking a bit older than he remembered but still kneeling on the floor of the living room like he had been there all along.
to understand. Didn't he? Steve didn't punch Howard for himself. He did it for Tony. Hell, he did it for
The train was packed, full of tourists and locals, a rare nice day in February drawing people outdoors and into the cheapest means to traverse the city. With the subway so packed, there were no seats, so they stood close together, Steve looking like he belonged, and Tony trying to push down his anxiety. How in hell did people do this daily?
Tony and Howard emerged a few minutes later, Howard holding onto a pair of pajama bottoms and a Slayer t-shirt. "Just leave them by the door," Tony was saying of Howard's borrowed clothes. "I'll get everything washed."
His mouth hung open, panic spreading across his face as he answered. "How can you expect me to hurt him now? I can't… if I know… I won't. I won't do it, Natasha. I won't hurt him again."
Tony huffed, his arms crossing over his chest. Which unfortunately drew attention to the arc reactor under his shirt.
He always scrambled to pick it up, needing the mental visual of Steve on his knees behind him working him over with his tongue.
"You idiot!" He yelled, but there was a smile on his face. "Don't ever, for one second think you're not good enough for me. Oh, for Christ's sake, Tony." His eyes rolled to ceiling in exasperation, "I love you! And that means loving all of you! You think I don't got issues?”
"You're right, I didn't know that." Clint snarked back. "And I honestly don't care." He paused. "I need a new phone anyway."
There was good humor on Steve's face, they did this song and dance often enough it was almost scripted. Steve would tease that Bruce wanted to steal Tony away with savory goodness, and Bruce would make fun of Steve's cooking.
"That he gets sick after he eats. Vomiting is only one of, like, twenty symptoms. He refuses to see a doctor, and we're at a loss."
Tony stretched and rolled over into his stomach, bringing his right leg partly up and clutching the pillow. It was how he slept when he didn't have Steve to curl up against. "Yeah, yeah," he mumbled, "gather your thoughts. Just tell me he's going back to whatever fires of hell he came from." His eyes closed.
"Comedy is probably our best bet," Natasha said as she filed her plate with the salad. "But, Howard, why don't you decide?"
"This is incredible," Steve breathed. He walked up to a photograph of himself and Natasha, both looking exhausted as they stared above, the object of their focus unknown, but the emotions displayed across both faces speaking volumes.
They made his follow-up appointment at the desk and left, once again facing the onslaught of cameras and a new addition to the bottom feeders: reporters.
Wordlessly, Steve handed him the tin. Tony opened it, delight blooming on his face, and handed it to James, who laughed loudly.
Ria Rose - 3136 - S1 - Soul bond (I definitely didn't realize this was supposed to be a soulmate AU until after I wrote it, but I hope you like the prompt anyway!)
that it almost took Steve for a trip. After everything that had transpired, it was bizarre to think that things could settle down again, but there they were.
"It's okay," Bruce is saying. "You're alive, it's not your fault. We're just thankful, Jesus. We're just happy you're okay!"
Children on their parents laps and teenagers sitting next to their mothers and fathers looked with wide eyes at him. Adults both with recent diagnoses and and older ones found themselves suddenly attached to the figure before them. A superhero who was just like they were.
With a smile, Rhodey pushed off the door frame, walking into the kitchen. "They're together in Steve's room, talking. Been in there a while, so probably more than talking." At her raised eyebrows, he laughed. "Tony and I had a really good conversation before. He knows he was wrong breaking up with Steve. And I doubt Steve wouldn't take him back."
Yes, they fought. They bickered like an old married couple. Said some pretty shitty things to each other as well. But when the cards were down - when they needed each other the most, they knew without a doubt who they could count on.
His temper was no secret to anyone that knew him. It had gotten him into trouble more times than he could even count, but never -
Michael shakes his head. "No, but I wanted better for you. That's why I put Happy, Rhodey, and Pepper in your way. So you could meet them and cultivate at least some meaningful relationships."
Looking directly at the oak tree and the bench underneath, no one would guess that the small square of solitude had Manhattan springing up around it, buildings on all sides and the sunlight partially blocked by the tree. The wrought iron fence cast strange shadows across Tony's face as he sang, the light moving the dark bars across his features with the breeze. His eyes were closed, and the guitar sat propped on his knee, the strap curling around his body like armor, protecting him.
It was like his two worlds were finally connecting, the seventy year gap closing. He felt like a worn pair of much loved jeans, finally being patched after sitting at the bottom of a drawer for months.
which translated from Russian to Restful Place. Only Clint knew of it, though she had often considered the idea of letting the other Avengers know. It seemed fitting for them to have somewhere to go that no one else knew about, where they could escape the confines of their now very public lives.
Hill brushed aside all pretense of etiquette, uninterested with the niceties of meeting someone with so much at stake. "With not much time to even attempt to elucidate, I'll come right out and say it." Hill stood straight, her shoulders rolled back and tense. If Natasha didn't know her so well, she'd think Hill was calm and in control, but if someone knew where to look, they would see the small tremble in her hands that gave her away. Hill tried to hide it, but Natasha was sure she had grown to care about the Avengers in her own way.
"Start from the beginning." Bruce's hand stilled on his back, but he didn't remove it. "Just, wherever you think you need to. Tell me what happened."
She was just pushing her legs out straight in front of her, gearing up to stand, when someone plopped down next to her and held out a coffee cup.
could be heard, and Tony recognized the sound as one of Dum-E's tennis balls. Beyond the glass, Howard stood in the middle of the shop tossing the ball for Dum-E to fetch and bring back. The robot excitedly wheeling after it -- again and again -- retrieving it in his usual hazardous way. He had already knocked over one of Tony's tool kits, but Tony was nonplussed. Dum-E knocked that particular one over at least once a week, and he was honestly so used to cleaning it up, he could do it in his sleep.
"Been colder." Steve mumbled, picking up the computer and snapping it closed. "Besides, I wr-do better work when I'm outside and alone."
Steve grimaced; he also believed he should have been in the meeting but figured Tony had handled himself fine.
Bucky sighed. “Steve, chill. Why don’t you enjoy this extravagant party?” He waved his hand around affectively.
Steve nodded promptly and wordlessly as his hands squeezed Tony’s ass. Tony stroked Steve’s cock with one hand while touching himself with the other. He leaned over toward one of the beside tables to find a tube of lube before rubbing some all over Steve.
Tony stood up to be somewhat at eye level with Bucky on the opposite side of Steve’s bed. “Bucky, I really don’t understand what your problem is with me, but not only is my kid safe with his aunt, I’m going to keep visiting Steve until he wakes up.”
“I should check on Banner.” Natasha motioned with her glass toward Bruce’s general direction before walking away.
He walked back inside the building up to the security desk. “I have an important package arriving this afternoon,” Obadiah began, staring the guard down, “please make sure it gets delivered to my office promptly and personally.”
Thanos let out a dramatic sigh as he swiveled in his chair to face his daughters. He delicately folded his hands in his lap without responding.
Tony slowly looked up in Steve’s direction, a little unsettled by Steve using “we” as if they were still a team.
Peter nodded quickly, making a move to exit the room, but Tony jumped off the bed to catch him before he could leave.
“…you know, I could probably scale the building if I exited through the window…” Tony offered before peeking out through the curtains.
Pepper only responded by inching closer toward Obadiah for effect. “Dr. Thanos gave you up, Obadiah. We know that you helped him plant the explosive on Roosevelt Island. So, back the fuck up or I’ll have Fury’s agents arrest you here on this podium.”
Tony moved the hand on Steve’s ass to the front of Steve’s body, finding his semi-hard cock before stroking it gently. Steve nodded again, letting a moan escape as Tony took his time.
“Oh, I’m sorry. Excuse me.” Steve said politely to the hurried individual, but he didn’t respond as Steve watched the man jog down the sidewalk.
Tony struggled with opening the lock because he couldn’t think clearly enough to unlock it. He could sense Steve standing right behind him before feeling two hands around his waist.
“It looks like the buyers are planning to attend this event out in Malibu this weekend.” Tony was mostly talking to himself, but he was loud enough for Steve to hear.
He stared up at the ceiling, now thinking about the time he and Steve went out to Malibu. He laughed as soon as he remembered how terrified Steve was to use the facial alteration device.
Tony used his good arm to point at the device. “We need,” he groaned again, “…we need to get the device to stop shaking long enough for it to finish constructing the detonator. We—” Tony shrieked, trying to hold his bad arm with his good arm. Steve carefully propped him up as he continued, pointing at the chip in Steve’s hand, “…we gotta use the chip…to keep the device stable as we work…I remember seeing this in my dad’s schematics…it was something about…what happens in the event the device is compromised…but the key…the chip keeps it stable, Steve…”
