Except - well.  He'd been dreaming for all of two minutes and he was already conscious of the fact that he wasn't exactly a
He lets out a choked sob, resting his head back against the raft as he looks at Steve’s face, his closed eyes, and he reaches out to brush the frost off it once more, fingers tracing over his nose, his lips, his jaw.  The light shines over him again, but he ignores it this time.  The boat doesn’t matter anymore.  Nothing matters.  He had one reason to go on, and now it’s gone.
"She was already dead."
Then he sees the little lifeboat the light is attached to, and he realizes where it’s coming from.
"Why do you think that?" Cap asked.
"It's just a question, Stark."
Tony's lips quirked upward at that, and he smiled, looking fond.  "I know, darling," he said.  "Well, I suppose if we have at least
"Jesus," Tony muttered.  "That's a hell of a hunch.  But I'll pick your brain later.  Can you wake Pepper and Rhodey and ask them to get ready?  I'll meet you outside."
So he was dead, as Steve had suspected.  "Was it because of a herd?" he asked gently, since Tony had gone quiet.
And no matter what Tony tells himself, that’s exactly what he wants.  He wants to find his missing soulmate and just spend the rest of his life with them after hanging up the armor.  He wants an amazing pal like Rhodey or Steve, but minus the part where Rhodey’s off doing military things all the time and Steve is dating other women and plus additional romance and sex.
was what the infection was.
flooding, but he doesn’t know how bad the damage is, doesn’t know how quickly the crew responded—too many unknowns.  “Either way, this is bad.  Steve…”  And here he swallows, not sure how the other man will take it, but he makes himself press on anyway.  “We have to tell my father and Sunset.  You—you understand, Steve, don’t you?”  If something’s happened, they need to know.  He may not like them very much right now—hell, he’s planning on getting away from them as soon as they make it to shore—but he doesn’t want them to
There was a pause, and Steve could tell that Tony was deciding if he could trust her or not.  "It's not," he finally agreed.  "It's meant to mass-deliver biological or chemical agents."
—Then watched as the glow suddenly vanished, leaving nothing in his hand but a distinctly unmagical-looking stone.
With that, Steve stops the movie and switches to a television show, and Tony doesn’t bring it up again.
If Rogers rolled his eyes at him, well, Tony couldn’t see, so it might as well have not happened!  But then he took off, and Tony had to wonder if maybe he shouldn’t have goaded him, because—well.  It wasn’t very comfortable.  Then again, could riding a sabretooth bareback
With that, she disappeared from view, and Steve could hear her shuffling above the ceiling tiles, away from them.  A few minutes later, there was the sound of loud banging and shouting, and the sounds of the biters at the door waned.  To be sure, Steve got down on the floor, peering through the gap under the door.  "It's clear," he said to Stark.  "You ready?"
, and something inside him snaps, because Steve
Ty flicked something at him - a corn kernel, apparently - which was enough to bring Tony back to the present.  "Why aren't you listening to me? You've been like this since school started again. I mean, it's kind of rude.  You need to be paying attention to me when I talk."
He really should stop, he thought, even as his hand slid downward.  What would Tony think?
Steve's heart skipped a beat, and it wasn't in a good way.  He remembered all too well the "experimenting" that had gone on during the war, and he wasn't about to tolerate it happening again, government or not.  "Maya, if you're talking about human subjects—"
"The influenza vaccine took years to develop," Steve said.
"Let's go."
“Oh.”  Steve goes back to touching him, hands roaming his chest and arms, and Tony makes a low sound in the back of his throat.
“Let me be the judge of that.  Can I pick you up?”
Stark slung the rifle back over his shoulders, shaking his head.  "Don't mention it," he said.  "Let's get what we need and go."
for this, he can’t help but feel, well, empty.  But then the bottle of lotion is pressed into his hands, and he remembers something much better is going to replace it soon.  Without needing Tony to tell him what to do—the fact that Tony’s cock is right in front of him, hard and thick and shining with wetness is instruction enough—he squeezes some of the lotion into his hands, warming it for a moment before reaching forward, coating it well.
"So where's army intel sending us now?" Bucky asked as soon as they were settled.
In response, Fury slid the folder back toward him, fingers drumming the table afterward.  "Hunting for this mystical relic
Tony glances back at him, looking perfectly cheerful.  “Absolutely it is,” he says.  “I’m just disappointed that I won’t be able to see their faces when they discover it.”  He pauses.  “Then again, that’s probably a good thing.  Come on, this way.”
Rhodey tossed up a length of rope, which Tony managed to catch with his gauntleted hand.  "I know you can't pull on anything right now.  But I've made some footholds and I can climb out on the rope if you tie it to something.  Can you do that?"
Cap came up to stand beside him.  "You want me to remove the body."
"Yeah, I'm here," Tony said, holding one arm out.  It wasn't much of a hug, encased in metal as he was, but Pepper accepted it anyway.  "We tracked the transceivers here before they were destroyed.  What the hell is going on?"
And Steve—Steve had
"I don't see the resemblance," Stark said.
,” he breathed, scrambling to his feet and grabbing one of his gauntlets from his pack.  “Rogers?” he tried again, lowering his voice to a whisper—not that it really mattered, since he’d just spent the past five minutes laughing loudly, which, come to think of it, was not the greatest of ideas when he had at least one fractured rib.
Steve nods again, biting his lip as he looks off to the side, chest heaving.  “I trust you, Tony,” he says.
"I know you know what this is," Birch said.  "And I know you have the other pieces."  He set the piece down on his palm, and they all watched as it oriented itself toward Cap, seeking to be reunited.  After half a second, he closed his hand, then rested it on his lap.  "I can only imagine what could have been accomplished had I had the complete relic.  But the beauty of it was that even the one piece was enough."
wrist.  How is it even possible that she felt the need to move on from him?
"What?" Steve said as someone else cried out, "Luke, the shield!"
“No!” Steve squawks before Tony can finish the sentence, even though he
"I'm going to try and divert at least one of them," Cap said.  His shield wasn't out, instead still attached to his back, and Tony realized it was meant to be a target—assuming the Japanese had heard of Captain America, there was no way they would be able to resist trying to take him down.
“You want to grab lunch?” Steve asks as they stand in the rubble after defeating one such threat, chin smudged with dirt.
"Are you okay?  What did that guy do to you?"
The caveat?  The Savage Land was such an unknown that Fury—and by extension, S.H.I.E.L.D.—wanted a nice, long report about what he found.  And they wanted one Steve Rogers to accompany him.
"He wasn't himself today," replied the woman whose silhouette was visible through the doorway.  "I worry."
this to happen,” he said quickly.  “I’d much rather have you as a human.”  He was a lot easier on the eyes as a human.  “But anyway, don’t worry.  I’m sure there’s a way to fix this.  I’m Tony Stark, remember?”
A flash of movement caught his eye, and he whirled to the right, his shield coming out—but it turned out to just be a rat, and he forced himself to relax, shaking his head.  Maybe it was just a damned rat this whole time.  Maybe there was no one up here, much less Natasha's James.
His last thought before passing out was how nice and familiar it all felt.
Steve frowns down at it, but he’s smiling a little by the time he looks at Tony again, leaning forward to press his lips against his nose.  “Fine,” he says.  “Let’s go.”
It was strange, Steve thought, where their relationship was right now.  Things between them had been so different not that long ago—well, not that long ago for him, anyway.  And then Steve had been so
while—but he’s not a virgin.  “Just—just be careful.”
Tony blinked, his eyes following the pelt down to a limp-looking paw, then went back up to Steve.  “Oh,” he said.
"Four in the morning," Cap said.  "Please?"
There was the sound of furious whispering, and then one voice spoke.  "You're damn right we're here," said the voice.  "And if you want to live, you'd better drop your weapons."
Steve feels his cheeks heat up.  “Uh,” he says.
Tony's parents died, and Steve never came back to him.
, his exhausted mind told him.
Tony let out a sigh, running his fingers through his hair.  This wasn’t working.  He glanced at the sky for the first time—he’d been too busy listening to Rogers to pay attention to the light—and frowned.  He couldn’t see the sun because of all the trees, but he suspected it was late afternoon.  The first sunset of their deadline was approaching.  “I’m coming back down,” he announced.  Rogers’ eyes widened at that, and he shook his head wildly, but Tony ignored him, taking hold of the rope and sliding downward as Rogers whined uselessly.  “We have to find another way out,” he said.  “And I can’t let you wander off on your own.  So let’s go—if we follow the perimeter, we should be able to find another exit.”  He hopped on and held on tight, and with a bit of goading, Rogers finally took off.
They fall silent then, with Tony’s hand still against his cheek as they just watch each other in the night.  Steve wants to say something, to
"The next Carl Lewis, coming through," Ty announced as they walked out of the locker room (after a shower that was a lot shorter and less private than he would have liked).  He had one hand stretched out, and his other was around Steve's shoulders as he made his proclamation. "Future Olympic champion, right here."
.  We’re here.  You’re not supposed to stay like this.”
day—away from Bethesda.  And now he felt like his world was ending.  "I don't understand," he said finally.  "Always been too late?"
Tony’s lips quirk upward.  “It’s the Schrödinger equation,” he informs him, and when Steve continues to look confused, Tony adds, “Her words, I mean.  It has to do with particles.  You know, like Pym particles.  Jan’s convinced this means Hank’s her soulmate, but you can guess what happened when she tried telling him that.”
Still, he'd turned around, lifting his head and meeting his gaze.  "Nothing, sir," he'd managed stiffly.
"I'm sorry to hear that."  The idea of serving his country but not being officially acknowledged for it… it stung a little.  Tony was as much a soldier as any of them, and he deserved the same kind of honor and respect.  "Hey.  Look."  He pointed to some dried muddy footsteps on the floor of the building they were in.  "These seem recent to you?"
“Steve?” he calls out, needing to hear his voice.
“Do you want to stand around listening to my life story?”
being the implication—"and you don't just wind up with a homogenous group like that by accident.  Something's fishy."
He was over halfway through the room when he ran into a problem.
And what, he wondered, would he do if he ever found himself in this situation again?  It was, he felt, all very well and good to know that it
"And if we find this guy, or at least what happened to him, you'll return my blueprints?" Tony pressed.
He forced himself onto his feet, wavering a little as he held his gauntleted hand up again.  “I don’t want to have to fire at you,” he told him as they began circling each other slowly.  God, was this his life now?  Getting into showdowns with national-heroes-turned-extinct-animals?  This was probably the last thing he ever wanted.  “Really, now.  You’re tearing me apart, Steve.  Don’t make me cry—it’s not pretty, it really isn’t.  So get that wild look out of your eyes and be my friend again, pretty please?”
Tony's lips twisted upward.  "That's right.  All that action, all that danger… it was all for my own benefit.  Sure, entertaining the nation was a nice side effect, but… Jesus, Steve.  I was so selfish."
.  Tony can look at Steve’s words now, if he just flips his wrist over.
Exactly how or why that happened was still a mystery, and one that Tony had an uncomfortable feeling would never be solved.  Whatever it was, it seemed to be triggered at random every few days after getting a good night's sleep. Naps didn't result in him waking up in Steve's body, and pulling all-nighters seemed to prevent it as well.
“I won’t go away,” Rogers said, and the next thing Tony knew, he was rolled onto his back again, Rogers reaching up to undo the buttons of his shirt.  Tony tried batting his hands away, but it was no use—Tony was far too weak, especially after plugging the gauntlets into his chest plate, which yes, okay, was only supposed to be done in case of emergency because that charge was supposed to be for his
lunch.  On top of that, he found homework assignments that he didn't remember, but they had his name on it - not written in his own handwriting - and were already done.  Infuriatingly, the math and science questions just had the answers penciled in and no work showing how the answer had been reached in the first place.
Ty peered at something to Steve's side.  Steve looked too, but there wasn't anything there.  "Well, since you apparently forgot to bring your backpack, I think we only have time for you to go back, grab your things, and then go to class.  Shame, because you'd really benefit from having some extra time to fix your terrible bedhead." He smirked. "Need help with your schedule today, Mr. Forgetful?"
"You realize that you're supporting the idea of him knowing exactly where we are and where we'll be coming from so that he can prepare for us at his leisure, right?" Tony replied, frowning.  "I don't see how that's better."
It was hidden inside a large bag propped up against the wall, which he supposed kept it from discovered immediately should someone step into the room, though its shape looked plenty obvious to him.  Still, as much as he wanted to take it out and touch it, he kept it in the bag for now, awkwardly sticking it under one arm as he finally went and answered the door to see Bucky on the other side, raising an eyebrow at him.  "What were you packing for, a vacation?" he demanded. "You said you were coming nearly five minutes ago."
"Come on, how many times do we gotta do this?  I have coffee."
Half an hour later, he came across some footprints that looked like they were recently made by a large, Steve-as-a-sabretooth-shaped animal.  Tony leaned down to inspect them, not sure how to feel.  Either this was a good thing because it meant he was on Steve’s tail, or it was a very bad thing because there was another sabretooth wandering around.  But even if it was the latter, well, what the hell could he do?  He had to find out.  So he kept on moving forward, praying that the tracks belonged to Steve and not some other thing that would only be too happy to eat him.
"I already said you could," Cap replied, sounding overly patient.  "Have some faith in me."  He brought Tony's pack over, opening it up and showing Tony what was inside.  "Look.  Mr. Jarvis showed me how to recharge the gauntlet."
, and he rocked his chair again, enough that Maya cringed away.  "Don't you say that," he snapped, his voice raised.  "Every life has value."
“Yeah,” Tony replies absently.  Changing the world is something he wants to do, and yet he gets the idea that his vision is somewhat different from Sunset’s.  Beautiful, smart Sunset, who wants to marry him because his father owns Stark Industries.  He remembers telling his father once he was hoping to meet someone he could talk to, someone whose company he enjoyed.  Someone who could look at him and have no expectations based on his name or his family.
His shield was nearby, and he was quick to pick it up, staggering to his feet and taking a few more steps back.  "You're going to get us all killed," he said.  The range of the—the fire ring was short, but he could see some of the papers they'd been fighting close to already starting to burn.  "Is that really what you want?"
Tony hesitated, torn between the desire to just end this and blast a hole in him, or hold out for more answers.  He spared a quick glance at Cap, who was looking at the two of them intently.  His shield was still out.  Deciding to take a chance, Tony flipped up the faceplate with one hand, then held the gauntlet out in front of him again.  "I'm looking."
And, maybe, if he were being honest with himself, he was a little afraid of what he would find if he did go looking.  What if Steve had actually passed away a few years later? Or what if he'd passed away a few years ago in Tony's present?  What if he'd changed and wasn't the same person Tony had grown to - to care deeply for? There was one way things could go right and so many ways it could go wrong, he felt.
hit him on the head after all, and he just couldn't recall?  In any case, he didn't plan on worrying Ma further, no matter what - he'd get to the bottom of this himself.
, he tapped out.
Tony starts walking off, but he turns to wave before disappearing among the other passengers, and Steve waves back.  As soon as he’s gone, Steve turns to a fresh page in his sketchbook and immediately gets to work, hands itching to draw those eyes, that smile before he can forget what they look like.
" - So I didn't have time to actually raid the workshop for parts today, but I did some more theorizing and I think I have a solution for powering the microbots," continued the box.
Cap turned the jar around.  "Mind if I take it out?"
"Need help?"
But as much as Tony wanted to stay awake, stay
"Good, because I don't plan on needing to take any from you," Steve said, following after him.  "I didn't realize you didn't officially serve, though.  You were on the front lines."
a more common name out there?  He doubted narrowing it down to Brooklyn would help much.  There were just too many Steves and too many Rogers and too many Steve Rogers, he was sure.
“Tony.”
He looks back up, heart fluttering.  “I have a headache,” he announces.  “For which I have you to thank, Father.  So I’ll be heading back to my room.  Good evening.”  Before they can protest, he leaves the dining room, heading for the staircase—and there Steve is, facing away from him, studying the mural surrounding the clock.  “Steve?”
“Oh, Tony,” Steve says softly, and he leans forward to kiss his forehead.
Dimly, Steve remembered something about how the Soviets had apparently become their enemy after he'd gone into the ice.  Was that something that mattered, though?  Did nationality or politics have any sort of significance in a world like this?  "Is that really something we should be focusing on?"
Cap looked up and met his gaze, his lips parted in—shock?— and then a loud explosion from above rocked the ship.
Tony hmphs, adjusting himself so that he’s pressing lightly against Steve’s entrance and looking smug as Steve swallows.  “No,” he admits.  “You ready?”
.  And maybe yet another part had something to do with the fact that okay, yeah, Steve was very, very nice to look at.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Sunset scoffs, one eye twitching.  “He doesn’t want to do that.”
"Really?"  Tony sighed and closed the cover over his heart, obscuring the glow of the fusion reactor inside.  "It's… nothing."
Steve blinks, glancing at Tony again, but then Sunset speaks—”That’s not his.  It’s yours, isn’t it, Tony?”
"We won't," Jessica promised.  "Good luck to you both.  It was an honor working with you."
"We're not going to make it back to Natasha tonight at this rate," Tony said a couple of hours in, the streets going dark around them.  Steve was stumbling often now, with Tony almost supporting him full-time, though he hadn't made any comment about it.
Without Tony having to prompt him, Cap pressed down on all the right latches, the armor opening up enough for Tony to be able to fit in.  The sound of it closing around him was comforting, as it always was.  Standing on his own was difficult without support.  But standing inside the armor—it didn't matter how weak he currently felt.  The armor would keep him upright.
And that’s when he sees his father.
Damn it.  They were getting nowhere fast.  "Tem?" he pressed.  "Where would Tem be?"
Tony scowled at the floor, hand reaching up to clutch at his torso.  Just how bad were his ribs?  “I was cut,” he insisted.  “Superficially.  Go away.”
already prepared?"
There was no time for this, not when the plane would be back any second.  "Go!" he insisted.  Not wanting to wait any longer, Tony took off his pack and pulled out a gauntlet he'd pulled from one of his suits—he'd thought, maybe, that it would come in handy in case there'd been a cave-in or something, but he supposed taking down an aircraft that was actively firing at them was an alternative, if undesirable use for it.
"Captain America," he tried, even though he knew that if Steve had said he couldn't receive, then he couldn't receive, but he didn't want to believe it.  "Cap, I'm here.  Can you hear me?"
The most pressing thing, he supposed, was the light filtering into the room.  He found that as soon as he opened his eyes, he was practically blinded, and so he was forced to close them again, placing a hand over his face as he groaned.  Light sensitivity. Definitely not something he'd experienced before.
Tony gazes back at the stars with half-lidded eyes, watching them twinkle into and out of existence.  The night is silent around him, and all he’s aware of is the sky, the ocean, and Steve wrapped around his body.
All he had to do was -
There was static.  Tony waited with bated breath.  Then—
Tony inhales sharply, briefly reminded of that moment two nights ago when he’d climbed over the railing on the opposite end of the ship, but he forces the memory away.  This isn’t anything like that night.  Steve isn’t going to hurt him.  He’d never hurt him.  So he steps up, his free hand reaching down to grip at the rail.  “It’d be really bad if I fell over,” he says.
Steve blinks again at him, very slowly.  “Oh!” he manages at last, far too delayed and feeling his ears start to burn.  “Right.  Um… just, um… just lie down.  On the couch.  In whatever way you think is most comfortable.”  God.  No wonder Tony is so vain—he’s
Things weren't alright, but he wasn't going to cry, he told himself.  Maybe later, when he was alone, but not here and not now.
“It’s not aimless—” Rogers began, but Tony was already walking off, heading down the small hill they’d been standing at the top of.  “Stark—”
“Go for it.”
That was the plan, anyway.  It lasted for all of a minute before she lunged again, her momentum carrying her past him.  He kept a firm hold on her wrist, not wanting her to topple over—but then he heard a sound he'd only heard during the war, a sound he never wanted to hear again: skin ripping, joints popping, and just like that the hand he'd been holding was no longer attached to her body, and now it was dripping discolored blood onto the otherwise white snow.  "Jesus," he heard, and it took a moment to realize it was just himself saying it—because the woman hadn't uttered a sound upon losing a damned limb.  Not a whimper, not a cry, nothing.  He dropped the hand and backed away, only to find himself suddenly on his ass—the woman had stuck out a leg and he'd tripped, his reflexes still muddy.  And then she was on top of him, blank eyes staring nowhere as the stump where her missing hand used to be rubbed blood all over his shirt, and her face was so, so close.  But he couldn't do it; he couldn't hurt her.  How could he, when it was obvious she wasn't in control of her own actions right now?  And how could he use force when he knew her body could fall apart at a moment's notice?
"So suspicious," Cap chided.  "You're really doubting Captain America?"
"We do this together, or not at all," Pepper said as she and Rhodey jogged back toward him.  Damn them.  Damn them both.  "How can we help?"
Steve tried to sit up, but when he straightened his arm to brace himself, it buckled, and he fell back down.  His vision felt blurry.  "What do we do now?"
Steve had a feeling Tony was being obtuse on purpose, though he couldn't imagine why.  "Is something wrong?" he pressed.  "Is the reactor broken?  Is your heart okay?"
"Yes," Steve said, scooping Tony up with only minimum protest.  "We have to get out of here now."
Before he could head back for the pit, though, several more bullets hit the pillar, forcing him to stay put.  It probably wasn't luck, he thought as he hastily stuffed his good arm back into the gauntlet.  He hated it when the bad guys were lucky.
Steve reached over to take Tony's hand.  It felt right.  "You're one of the most capable people I know," he said.  "If anyone can help bring an end to this, it's you."
He had his answer soon enough.  Not too far down the tunnel, there was a slight cave-in—it wasn't so bad that the train wouldn't be able to pass through, but there was a pile of debris lying in the middle of the track that would likely prove problematic if they tried to push through it.
She gave them directions, and they went on their way, dealing with any biters they came across—fortunately, there weren't many of them, and the halls were relatively clear.  Once they were there, Steve carefully opened the door, shield out.
"Like what?" Steve asked, not sure if it would be anything he could bear to hear.  Tony, to his surprise, motioned for him to turn around, so he did, unable to deny him anything.
drivel."
Then he heard a sound from behind him.  He turned to see a large shape shuffling out of the adjacent room, the darkness obscuring its features—but the soft groaning made it clear it was a biter.  Steve sighed, readying his shield to do what needed to be done.
"So those are my rules.  Easy peasy, right? Tony, out."
He heard Tony exhaling softly, but the other man eventually nodded. "Okay," he said again.  "Let's go."
"You'll need it someday," Natasha insisted.  "Better to have a gun of your own than to not."
“Should be illegal to look that pleased with yourself,” Steve mutters.  Nonetheless, he rolls his hips slightly, looking back up at him in return.  “Give it to me.”
Steve frowned, trying to remember what he'd said yesterday.  The way he remembered it, there hadn't been many words exchanged before the action took place - that was why Dougie talking to him now was so surprising, even if the hostility wasn't.  "I have no idea what you're going on about."
“It’s not a heat reading, so it’s not lava,” Tony replied, rolling his eyes.  “And I’m not asking you to dig any holes.”  Wouldn’t that be hilarious, though?  Captain America with a shovel.  “There’s something else I’m picking up.”  He wandered over to a large rock nearby, brushing his fingers against it.  “Look.”
"There were some we left alive further into Milford," Steve said.
He was in denial, Tony thought at the same time he read those very words written down on the page - a page that now had drops of wetness spattered onto it.  When had that happened? Carefully, so as to not smudge the pencil, Tony dabbed away the water with his shirt, rubbing his eyes afterward.
And besides, even if Steve is, what does it matter?  He thinks of Happy and Pepper, Hank and Jan, Firestar and Justice.  Happy and Jan are dead.  Firestar and Justice have broken up.  Their fated words were no guarantee of happiness.
"I… I don't know," Tony admitted.  He reached down to pet Steve's hair.  It felt nice.  Tony hadn't done that since… since they were together.  "You're hurt, and I can't do anything."  His voice cracked, but he continued, "I'm afraid that all I'll be able to do is wait and see if you turn."
Steve shrugged and put a peach slice in his mouth.  "If she's sincere, then weakening us is the last thing she needs."
, I saw him fall—I should have known if he was still alive—"
Tony snorts.  “Pushy,” he repeats.  But he leans forward, and suddenly Steve can feel a warm tongue against his skin, causing him to buck and moan in response.  Seemingly encouraged by that, Tony shifts, and the next thing he knows, Tony’s just full-out lapping at his cock, eyes closed as he leaves a wet trail along every vein and ridge.  “God,” he manages between licks, voice deep and breathy.  “I’m—I’m dead serious, Steve.  I think I could actually stay here forever.”
Then Rogers was moving, his strides clunky at first but getting more graceful as he continued to run, and then he was leaping and Christ, Tony was almost too afraid to look—
He pulled up the command-line interface, typed in a query to display a list of recently-created files, hit enter, waited - and then a single result appeared.
And yet Tony had an inkling that while all of the above was possibly true, there had to be more.  Even after all these months of sharing Steve's body, of getting into his head, Steve still found ways to surprise him.
Tony looks back at him.  “Really…?”
That was when he felt a gentle hand slide into his hair, carefully massaging his scalp.  Despite himself, Tony could feel his eyelids drooping, and he turned to glare at Cap before it was too late.  "What do you think you're doing?" he demanded, though the words lacked the bite he was hoping to put into them.
“I’m worried about you,” Rhodey tells him over the phone one day, and the tone of his voice makes it sound like he’s plotting to fly in from Camp Hammond to ambush Tony and make sure he’s doing alright any second now.
Tony and Birch both stared at him.  How could Cap know this?  Was there some kind of plan the others had that he hadn't been aware of?  He wanted it to be true, but—how?
Tony had killed him.
"Hm?"
Finally, though, Steve spoke up.  "Tony," he said.
His father is staring at the cutlery very intently, and for a moment Tony wonders if he’s just going to ignore the both of them.  Well, that’s for the better, he supposes.  But then Howard takes a deep, shuddering breath, turning his gaze up to glare at Tony.  “
Somehow, he finds it in him to take the stairs one at a time, but already his breath is catching, his heart fluttering.  Soon enough, he’s almost there, so close he can reach out and
"So we might get into a fight with people who have committed war crimes."
"Wow," he said.
Surprised, Tony leaned closer, peering at it.  The item inside looked just like what had been described in the folder—a golden-colored, banded stone, maybe tiger's-eye.  It was shaped like an arc, but the edges were ragged, as though there was more to it that had been broken off.  Tony couldn't help think that although it was as pretty as a broken piece of polished tiger's-eye could be, it looked exceedingly ordinary.  "This is it?" he asked.
, Steve replies, and Tony doesn’t know if he should laugh or cry.)
The grin slid off Bucky's face - and oh, boy, Tony actually had no idea what Bucky's real name was, so hopefully there'd be no need to address him in the near future - to be replaced by a look of mild confusion.  "C'mon, is it that awkward watching this? Don't you like seeing how good it is for troop morale?"
Steve just had to charge at him once more.  Hissing in pain, Tony hauled his ass out of Steve’s way, firing at him again—he hated to do it, but if Steve was anything like that other sabretooth they’d fought, it’d just be an annoyance at worst.
Then he saw the tattered remains of Rogers’ clothes spread out on the floor, and suddenly he feared the worst.
“Steve!” he cries as he bursts into the room again.
Steve stared at Stark dumbly.  "I thought the war ended," he said.

Ma must have seen something change in his face, because she smiled again.  "So will you do that for me, Stevie?" she pressed.
, he writes in an email.
There were so many things he could do with something like this. First things first, though—he’d fix his heart, and then Rogers would never have to be annoying again.
But now - now it suddenly seemed like the impossible was possible.  The past was maybe mutable. History could be changed. Was it right?  Tony didn't know. He didn't want to think about it too much. One thing he was certain about, though - there was no way he could say nothing and let Steve just die.
Steve blinks at him slowly.  “Oh,” he says, once he’s processed the words.  “I—
Steve didn’t look happy, rapping one paw against the ground to catch Tony’s attention.
Tony's eyes flashed.  "We're armed and you're trapped," he said.  "You should rethink your decisions."
Steve looks back at the small crowd of people around the lifeboat here, all jostling to get on even though it’s almost full, and nods to himself when he seems to spot Howard after a moment.  Then he turns back to Tony, placing a hand against his cheek.  “Don’t worry,” he tells him.  “I’m here for you.  It’s gonna be alright.”
Steve becomes the new top cop, and his first order of business is to throw out the Superhuman Registration Act.  His second is to reform the Avengers and give Luke Cage his own team.  “You can’t have Thor or Iron Man,” Steve says to Luke with a smile, and Tony feels a little twist of guilt in his stomach.
And Steve, he thought with dismay, was going off to war.
But these words were written for
When they came across an abandoned ad-hoc military base that was littered with bodies with head injuries so obvious that Stark didn't even bother to jab them, Steve had to admit that maybe Stark was right.  Still, as Stark went to forage for supplies, Steve went to each soldier anyway, collecting their tags and pocketing them.
Steve can feel his heart flutter in his chest.  Not because Tony’s still touching him, though that certainly helps, but because Tony… Tony seems to think this is more than just a one-night deal.  Sure, he could just mean until the ship docks in New York and they part ways for good, but… Steve wants to believe there’s more to it than that.  “Promise.  Now come here.”  Without waiting for an answer, he sits up, slipping an arm around Tony’s shoulders to pull him close and kiss him deeply, eyes slowly sliding shut.  God.  He can taste himself on the other man’s lips.
has sequels, but you gotta stop talking about it to Ty.  You're freaking him out.
All the strength Tony had exerted to stay upright, to get himself this far—he didn't need it anymore.  He could finally, finally relax.
"I killed him," Tony cut in before Steve could say the words himself.  "I killed him because I couldn't let him get away with a weapon that he could use to kill innocent people, and because he wasn't my father anymore.  And I wouldn't have done anything differently."
, finishes the note
Finally it was moved, and Steve had to stumble back to catch his breath, arms aching a little.  He didn't have long to rest, though—a cluster of four or five biters were practically on top of him now, and he sent the shield flying, kicking as hard as he could afterward to knock the closest biter off of him.  Then he threw himself at them, pushing the biters off the track as the train came bearing down on them.
to make Birch do those things in the first place?  Was it something he could have changed?
That startled a laugh out of Steve.  Was this the first time he'd laughed since he'd come out of the ice?  It… it felt like it.  "Sorry," he said.  "It is.  We can only talk about normal sleeping."
After picking their way past several bodies—and having to put down a few that were still moving—they arrived at the boarding area, where a lone train stood waiting, its doors open.  "Jackpot," Tony said, beaming as he made a beeline for the engine.
Steve grunted and writhed at the impact, turning long enough for Tony to catch the glint of the shield on his back—right.  The shield.  That had helped before, hadn’t it, the last time Steve went full sabretooth on him?  Maybe it would help now.
The pistols lowered.  "You wasted one of my traps and now the smell of blood is in the air.  Get inside before you bring the
First, his words were never about Sunset.
"You never did tell me why."
Then he goes and reads the full text of the act, and when he’s done, he reads it again, and—
Tony pursed his lips, buttoning his shirt up.  “Why does everything have to be so complicated all the time?” he groused.  “Okay, Rogers, just relax.  We’ll figure something out.  So tell me, what do you want to do?  Do you want to look for stuff down here, or get out of here?”
“Trigger the protocols,” he says to Pepper and Maria once everything is ready, and then he starts the long, slow process of brain death.
Calmly, the man sets his boots off to the side, shrugging out of his jacket.  Heavens, his shoulders must be a mile wide—but Tony forces himself to clamp down on that thought before it can progress any further.  It’s not right, he tells himself.  It’s improper.  Immoral.  “I’m gonna go in after you,” the man continues, going back to leaning against the rail.  “Won’t be fun.  I hate the cold.  But I’ll brave it for you.”
"Uh," Tony said.  He had no idea what she'd said yesterday, because he hadn't been here and for some reason Steve hadn't written about it.  "You'll have to remind me, because I'd really like to open this door and check up on you."
The man sighs, and Tony looks again to see him taking off his boots.  “You seem pretty sure of that,” he says.  “But alright.  If I can’t stop you, then I’m gonna go in after you.”
Tony's eyes flashed.  "How can you say that?" he snapped.  "This was exactly the sort of thing that you worried would happen when I built the Jericho in the first place!  And you were right!  Look at what it was used for!"  He made a choked sound in the back of his throat, continuing, "I thought I could end the war.  But all I did was start another one."
“Okay.”  Steve doesn’t say anything for a moment, blue eyes drifting, and then he reaches up, fingers brushing against the edges of Tony’s goatee.  “I want m-more time with you,” he says.
… Tony is going to be safe.  Tony is going to live.  And even though he’ll be reunited with his father, Steve’s hopes are high that he’ll be able to break free of his influence and do the things he was always meant to do—to design planes, to fly high into the sky.  Steve’s changed his life for the better, and there’s no higher honor, really.  And if he passes tonight, he’ll be able to do so with no regrets.
"See?" Stark said.  "Now let's get a move on.  We've got a thousand miles to go, and I mean that literally."
, Steve had written.
"What is it?" Steve asked.
“There’s nothing
," Tony interjected, his voice gone hard.  "Don't.  It's too late.  It's always been too late.  Don't take away my hands."  He reached up to run his fingers through Steve's hair, and Steve didn't know if he should move closer or pull away.  His touch was cold, but ultimately, Steve couldn't resist it.  "I'm sorry."
"Steve, stop," Tony said, the worry clear in his eyes.  "You're being irrational.  None of that matters anymore.  You've been bit and it's my fault.  Please just relax."
"Steve," said Cap.
It was a woman in her underthings.
.  He awkwardly adjusted the pelt around his body, then looked down at Tony, offering his hand.  “Please tell me you have clothes for me.”
Jarvis let out a bark of laughter, cracking his knuckles.  "That alone is reason to go.  It's our patriotic duty."
And, perhaps, most distressingly of all, Steve's conclusion about the double date had been correct.  (
“And you deserve it.”  Howard walks up to the table, eyes glinting.  “You are not to see that man again, do you hear me?”
It felt like an eternity between Captain America requesting assistance from Tony Stark and him actually needing it.  Tony had been hovering at the radio the whole time, feeling unsettled and anxious.  So much had happened between them, but it was over.  Had been over.  Tony had made the choice to leave, and Captain America… Steve… had made the choice to not contest it.  And that was where they were.
He’s already in the air by the time Carol gives him the hospital name and room, soaring across the country as she tells him the details.  Apparently Steve had been taking a late-night walk when he’d encountered a gang fight and broken them up, and from there one of the victims, still frightened, had shot him at close range.  “Can you believe it?” Carol asks when she’s done.  “The guy’s fought Kang.  Ultron.  The Red Skull.  And in the end, it’s some civilian kid that gets the drop on him.”
Something about the way she says those words catches Tony’s attention, and he blinks, glancing back at her.  “Why did you call me, Carol?”
“God,” he whispers to himself.
Neither said anything for a while, the silence between them dragging on.  Steve thought—hoped, maybe—that there was something Tony wanted to say, but he couldn't bring himself to.  Maybe Steve had to be the one to say it instead.  Maybe he was the one who had to take the chance.
And so they walked.  As they headed straight into the herd, the moaning became almost unbearably loud, and the stench even more so.  Steve could see Tony holding his arm over his nose and mouth, trying not to gag, but when Tony caught him looking, his eyes flashed, and he motioned for Steve to keep his gaze forward, which Steve reluctantly did.  After a few minutes, everything became the same—wave after wave of blank-eyed, ashen faces, of torn clothes and bloodied teeth.  Every now and then, one bumped into him, but Tony's logic had proven true, and apparently they considered him to be one of them, stumbling off uncaringly after contact.
And no matter how many times he dreamed that night of wild eyes and pointed teeth, each time he woke up in a cold sweat and looked at Steve’s sleeping form, he told himself, over and over again—Steve was going to be okay.
Tony.  The name stirred something in him, fuzzy memories of a half-remembered dream over a decade old.  He'd known a Tony, once. No, even more than that - he'd
, read the first line, written in a handwriting that wasn't his own.
And no matter what happens, Tony will not let Steve die alone.
“You’re cold,” Steve replies reasonably, as though he’s explaining that the sky is blue.  “You need this jacket more than me.”
Not too long afterward, masked men break into a Stark Industries facility and steal half-a-dozen prototypes in a precision strike, somehow knowing exactly what to do and where to go.  Weeks after that, Sunset says she’s breaking up with him.
Tony tried to throw his arms up in exasperation, but all he accomplished was another wince as he was painfully reminded of the fact that one of his arms really should not be moved right now.  "You did this earlier, didn't you?" he tried instead.  "I remember."
Blindly, he fired into the smoke once, twice, three times—but the recoil from the gauntlet was fierce, and he cried out in pain each time it went off.  Still, he struck
Then he hears the clack of heels against the deck, looking up in time to see… oh.  Whatever this is—a dream, or limbo, or something else—it’s over now.  Time to go back to reality.  “Sunset,” he greets, reluctantly pulling away from Steve’s embrace and standing up.  “It’s freezing.  What are you doing up here?”
Everyone nodded.  Tony drew back from the huddle they'd unintentionally formed, looking around.  "Cap, you stay here.  Rhodey, head north.  Pepper, south.  I'll keep going east.  Stay within sight of one another at all times."
Steve coughed as consciousness returned to him, trying to shift but finding his movements were limited.  This woke him up fast, and his eyes snapped open to see himself strapped to a chair—not just with rope, but duck tape as well.  They hadn't wanted to take any chances, apparently.
Despite their situation, Steve glances up at him, cracking a small smile.  “Ideally?”
“I will
There Cap went again with all that encouragement.  Tony was starting to believe that he really meant it.  "Yeah," he said.  "And we got you, too."  He'd been annoyed at the prospect of Cap tagging along at first, but… it wasn't so bad anymore.  It wasn't bad at all.  Even ignoring the fact that he was a handy man to have in a fight, his presence was just… comforting.  He trusted Cap.
Magic was weird, but Tony would take what he could get.  “See?  There’s a way to fix you.  We just have to do it within a timeframe.  That’s all.”
He was about to keep running anyway when he spotted a fire escape ladder that went up the side of the building, carrying Tony over before realizing that there was no way to get them both up there—not unless Tony wanted it.  "Hey, Tony," he said as he set him down against the building, placing his hands against his shoulder.  "Tony.  You with me?"
“I won’t hurt you,” Tony promises.  With that, he slowly urges a lotion-covered finger in, gaze finding Steve’s.  “This okay?  Jesus, you’re tight.”
"Steve?"
"I know what this is," Tony breathed as he stepped in, blindly running his hands against the cool metal.  He'd thought of it before, conceived of it in idle thoughts and corner scribbles in his notebook.  But it wasn't real—or at least, that was what he'd believed.  But the evidence, even as poorly-lit as it was, was right in front of him.  Someway, somehow, this was his design.
Rogers sighed.  Even in the dark, Tony could tell how put-upon he was.  “Stark.  Tell me something.  Do you know where its ‘big ugly face’ is?”
Steve nods as he quickly complies, fingers flexing.  “W-water’s cold,” he says.  “Can’t feel my hands anymore.”
Tony looks away, back into the rain, and he thinks again of crinkled eyes and beautiful smiles.
Steve's eyes darted around the room, and Tony felt his gaze linger on him before sliding away.  "How much later?" he asked quietly.
in what Tony recognizes as Father’s handwriting.  It’s the car he was driving the day they met, she says, and that was when she
"Yeah," Tony said, mind churning.  He hadn't recognized him, but… he almost felt like he should have.  He didn't know why.  Maybe it was because… "He didn't have to be there.  He probably shouldn't have, if he's calling the shots.  But he must be invested somehow."
"No," Jessica said, shaking her head.  "There are too many cables and things up here.  It's a tight fit, even for me… and I'm not sure if the ceiling tiles can hold your weight, anyway.  But listen, I have a plan.  If I go left from this room, I can start making a lot of noise.  Draw the biters away.  And you two can go right and head for the cafeteria.  I'll meet you there, okay?"
"Worth it," Tony said with a shrug.  He went over to pull open the curtains, figuring some sun might be nice.  Then he made his way to a box sitting under her bed and pulled it out, retrieving some pieces of scrap fabric he knew she kept around.
Tony doesn’t know how long he ends up standing there, eyes shut as dawn approaches, but it’s long enough that when he opens his eyes and doesn’t see Steve in front of him, it feels like a punch to the gut.
"Steve," Steve replied.  "And my friend is Tony."
fun on this dreadful ship.  “In fact,” he continues, “why don’t you have dinner with us tomorrow?”
, you know.”
Tony had sworn to himself as soon as he’d gotten off the ship that he’d never set foot on one again, and for eighty long years, he does exactly that.
“Don’t lie.  Your father had someone go look for you.  He says they found you below decks with that vile man from dinner.”
And that was when he felt it.  Something under the covers was poking at his arm.
It had taken Tony some time to realize it, but it had come to him eventually—the terrible truth Steve had touched on when they sat together on that plane and Tony had thought that their future was infinite.  Steve had known.  He had known, even then, years before it happened, what he would do and what it would lead to.
They chuckled, exchanged a few more words, and stepped back with a wave—and then Steve and Tony were off, continuing their journey south.
The other man disappears through the first-class entrance and is gone, leaving Steve there on the deck alone, freezing wind gusting through his hair.
“Not without you,” Tony repeats, lifting Steve’s hands and studying the handcuffs.  He lowers them after a moment, looking back at him.  “Steve, you… you made my life worth living.  There’s no way I’m just going to leave you here to drown, not after everything that’s happened.  So don’t argue, because I’m not going to listen.”
“I don’t care about your words,” Tony informs everyone he brings to bed.  His partners will always glance at him, surprised, but in the end they’re happy to sleep with him anyway.  Inevitably, these relationships last little more than a night, but it doesn’t bother him.  Soulmates mean nothing.  His words mean nothing.  The tabloids treat his lack of interest as something scandalous, but Tony doesn’t care anymore.  He’ll sleep around and have some fun, and that’s all that really matters.
you?" he managed.
He just wished he knew what was so important to Steve that he would want to put his life on the line for it.
Steve frowns at him.  “What happened?” he asks, unable to take this at face value.  “Was it Sunset?  Your father?”
nothing.  This happened all the time - no need to make a big fuss over it.  "I mean, he's the only one who's ever had a problem with me," he said in an attempt to make her feel better.  "I've never mentioned anyone else doing this, have I?"
"How adorable," Tony teased.  Steve rolled his eyes.
But now here was Steve's mom, smiling at him like he was the greatest thing in the world and telling him that she believed in him.  And Tony didn't know how to handle it.
going to get that last piece, and we
"Weapons," Tony said.  That was obvious.  "And let me guess, you're going to attempt to set them off in order to destroy something."
So Tony does, tilting his head up a little as he does so.  Is Steve going to kiss him now?  It’s certainly a good time for it.  But no, Steve is leading him forward instead, guiding him toward the rail.  “Step up,” he says softly.  “Keep your eyes closed.  I’ve got you.”
.  "What are we even going to do?" he asked.  "Once all this is finally done with?"
And yet, if he
“I see you’re back to old joking self,” Sunset says, and for a second, she almost looks genuinely charmed.  Then the moment passes, and she reaches into her pocket to produce a small box.  “Nonetheless, I know you’ve been… discontent lately.  And though I would have
"Let's go back to talking about the mission," he said.
Tony shrugs, tossing the used wipe into the trash can before getting out the antiseptic.  “True.  But it’s not the same.  And I know I’m the last person who should say that, since I’ve kind of revolutionized long-distance communications, but let’s face it, even talking to each other using the best StarkTech isn’t as good as grabbing lunch together.  But don’t tell the media I said that.”
God.  When had Steve even had a chance to do this?  Had he done the whole thing yesterday? Or had he been working on it for a while, hiding it somewhere Tony wouldn't find until he was finished?  Either way, it was just so - so
The next six months pass in something of a haze.  Tony still goes on solo missions as Iron Man.  He keeps in touch with the usual—Steve, Rhodey, Happy, Pepper.  He gets some of his credibility and funds back.  He considers, for a while, sleeping around in an attempt to soothe some of the pain, but it feels wrong, so he doesn’t.
Steve flushed, a little embarrassed for real.  "I'm going to go to my room," he announced in a thoroughly unsubtle attempt to dodge the subject.  Ma just chuckled softly and turned back to her cooking, leaving Steve to do what he said he would.
Steve woke up with the oddest feeling.
Jarvis' gaze flickered to Tony and back.  "That's true," he agreed gruffly.  Why did everyone want to talk about him like he wasn't right here, Tony wondered.
Then they arrived in Baltimore.
Steve groaned, turning to bury his face in his pillow again.  Again with the "easy peasy" nonsense. For someone who claimed that he just rolled with it, Tony sure did have a lot of rules.
"Got it," Cap said.
Steve sighed and shook his head.  "Don't be," he said.  "I'm just glad you're okay."
"It grows here?" Cap asked.
“Is everything a joke to you?”
Steve blinks again as he moves up to stand beside Tony.  It’s rare to hear someone of Tony’s standing openly criticizing their spouse.  Or spouse-to-be, anyway.  “Really…?” he asks.  “Wanna talk about it?”
Steve closes his eyes for a moment, just focusing on Tony’s touches, trying to keep his body from moving too much.  “I-I’m not hiding and I’m not perfect,” he says.  “A-and—and what, do you expect me to walk around naked?”
"I don't know," Steve admitted.  His heart had started to thud loudly in his chest, even though they were doing nothing but sitting in a quiet hospital room.  Maybe he should back away while he was still able to.  Maybe doing this would just lead to heartbreak again, just like during the war—a heartbreak that he could now admit was his own fault just as much as Tony's.
They headed off, Cap leading the way as he walked forward with his non-shield arm held out.  For a moment, Tony considered taking the fragment back from Cap—he was fairly sure the fragment orienting itself wasn't dependent on who was holding it—but it felt wrong.  It was Cap's discovery, and he should be the one to see it through.
Stark peered through the next window they passed by, motioning for them to stop.  "This one seems clear."
"It's okay," Steve said, nudging a plate of bologna and peaches toward him.  "Eat."
Cap waved a hand.  "You know," he said, even though Tony didn't.  "Things like… the pieces being attracted to each other.  That seemed like an obvious conclusion to draw, even though rationally I know it wasn't.  That's what I mean."
Marvels, it said.
“Stubborn,” Rogers murmured, but he kept on working on him in silence, bringing out a roll of gauze after a while and beginning to tape it over the gashes.  “Almost done.  How are you feeling now?”
It hurt, but Tony could still speak through gritted teeth.  "You know," he repeated.  "Because—agh—you've read
That wouldn't work.  So he'd just tried to wave everything off, and while he was sure Jarvis hadn't actually bought it, he'd at least given him space.
"Liar," the man hissed, and Tony jolted despite himself.  The movement, fortunately, was mostly hidden beneath the bulky armor, which Tony was grateful for.  He rolled closer, seemingly undeterred by the gauntlets Tony was still holding up.  "Look at me."
“I need you to get a hard drive I left in Texas and give it to the new Captain America,” he tells Maria Hill.
"What does it look like I'm doing?"  Steve took a deep breath and went over to Bucky's body.  The shovel was still sticking out of his face.  He knelt down, searching his pockets, and came up with a photo of Natasha.  Jesus.  So was this relationship between Bucky and Natasha mutual?  But why hadn't he known if Bucky hadn't actually died?
new, though, was seeing it all at once on his own time and with complete privacy.  He could… appreciate.
promising.
.  He’s alive now, but for over a
Tony blinked and looked at the newsreel.  There was Cap… and there was Bucky, his famed sidekick, charging off into battle together.
The memory of last night's dream came back to him unbidden, and Tony tried to somehow blink away the gnawing feeling of hunger that had plagued him the entire time he'd been that scrawny kid.  Maybe getting just the one donut hadn't been enough. "Uh, yeah, I guess," he said distractedly around his donut, chewing with more gusto than he normally did.
Tony smiled a little.  "It's fine," he said.  "I'm glad to know Captain America isn't perfect."
he thought.  If he was going to believe that maybe someone had actually somehow lived their life as him yesterday, he would need to gather even more evidence first.  One thing was certain, though - he wasn't going to say a word of this to Ty. Who knew how Ty would take it? He'd probably call up the school nurse and say something was wrong with Tony's head, laughing the whole time.
"I'll do it for you," he repeated, mostly to himself, and he reached out, placing a hand against Tony's cheek, feeling the scratchiness of his beard.
"Jarvis!" he yelled, on the off chance that Jarvis would reply, but there was no response.  It didn't matter.  Maybe he was unconscious or otherwise unable to respond.  There was, of course, only one way to find out.
"Well, if you put it like that…" Tony drawled.  "All right, then."
Eventually, though, he realized what Rogers was getting at.  “No,” he said.  “I am
Tony beamed at him, curling up close.  His expression sobered a few seconds later, though, as he looked up at him.  "What is this?" he said.  "I mean… you kissed me, and now you're here.  I know you said you weren't angry anymore, but friendship and… this are different things.  What if we hurt each other again, Steve?"
Damn his broken body.  But he’d deal with it, one way or another.  Either he’d find a cure, or he’d die trying.
That was what she'd yelled when they'd first come in, Steve remembered.  But… "Everyone else here has turned," he said.  "Are you sure you're not just hurt from something else?"
And Tony had returned his love by killing him.
“We were,” Tony replies.  “I was going to tell you during the talk, so I guess that means this is the talk now.”
Howard pulls away, though his gaze remains as intense as ever.  “Tony Stark,” he says, his voice steely, but softer—then again, he’d just been screaming.  “You are my only son.  My only successor.  All I have wanted is a child who I can be proud of, one who will follow in my footsteps.  Why do you continue to refuse to be him?”
“Glad to hear it,” Steve replies.  He pulls away to look at him, and that’s when he remembers—Tony’s arm is covered in blood.  “…You’re bleeding.”
What on earth is going on?  Has Tony already died, only to wake up in some sort of limbo where people care about him for some reason?  “I… think the fall alone would kill me,” he manages, still trying to wrap his head around the mystery that is this handsome stranger.  “It won’t be cold.  It’ll be like… it’ll be like flying.”  He’s always wanted to fly.  Maybe not when the end result is breaking his neck upon impact in the freezing waters below, but he figures it’s better than never flying at all.
"Tony," Steve said wearily into - what was it called again, a laptop? - as he made his voicelog for the night, "you know as well as I do that this is real and it's happened more than once and it's probably going to happen some more.  And I think we need some rules."
.  And after everything that had happened… Tony didn't want to do that to him.
slide.  "This wasn't your fault, Tony."
No, he tells himself.  No one’s going to see them.  Everyone’s getting ready for dinner, and it doesn’t even matter, anyway, right?
It’s cold.
Steve blinks in surprise when his drawing pad is suddenly covered in shadow, glancing up and shielding his eyes to see who the newcomer is.  “Tony?” he manages, wondering if this is really the case.  Why would he be here, though?  Steve would think that he has other obligations, doing… whatever people like him do.  But his eyesight adjusts enough so that he can make out the other man’s goatee in the glare, and he finds himself smiling.  It
Steve glanced at Stark, then Jessica, who nodded.  "Guess so," he said.  "We'll back before you know it, Luke."
"Yes.  Exactly like that."
Steve had apparently just done a fine job of putting his foot in his mouth.  "Oh," he said.  He hesitated, then added, "I'm sorry I assumed, Tony."
he wrote in Steve's journal and on his newspapers and even on his pale, pale skin.
"Steve!"
Tony grabbed it back, quickly flipping back to the passage he'd been on.  "I was in the middle of reading that, thanks very much."

Tony winces just a little, though it’s impossible to tell given that he’s in the suit.  “It’s the future,” he says, because he doesn’t think Steve will take it very well if Tony refers to it as a
Steve stares at him for a moment, and in the silence Tony can’t help but fear that he said something wrong.  “I know,” he says at last, and for some reason, his hand strays down to rub at the wrist with the watch on it.  “Tony… that was what I wanted to talk about, actually.  Making things right.  Between us.”
one to be making any moves tonight.  Running a hand along his thigh, he continues, “Put your leg like
Despite himself, Steve snorts.  “You—you can’t be serious about that.  Aren’t you famous?”  Tony doesn’t seem like the type of guy to fade away into obscurity—name change or not, Steve’s pretty sure he’ll make headlines again sooner or later.
“I was starting to wonder if you’d ever wake up.”
He needed more information first.  Once he found out where he was -
Cap reached out, and—and he was holding Tony's hand again.  "There's a future," he said.  "After we find Ms. Potts and Mr. Rhodes and Mr. Jarvis.  And after we find the final piece.  There's gonna be a future."
Strangely, Tony’s not afraid.  Disappointed, maybe.  Definitely sad.  If only they’d talked earlier.  If only Steve had joined him.  If only Steve had just
For a long time, they are silent save for the sound of their quiet breaths as they pant and move together, fingers clutching at sweat-dampened skin.  Tony’s thrusts are rhythmic and even, and the initial ache is all but gone by now.  In this moment, Steve feels like there’s nothing in the world except the two of them in this stranger’s car, as close as two people can possibly be, and everything is perfect.  Tony is beautiful like this, the humidity making his hair curl and stick to his forehead, and Steve reaches up, brushing it out of his face so that it doesn’t block his eyes.  “Tony,” he says softly.
"Yeah, just—"
“Not yet,” comes Steve’s answer.  “Do you trust me?”
he got there.
There was a knock at his door, and Tony jumped, realizing a second later that he'd probably been staring at the wall, lost in his thoughts, for the last several minutes.  "I'm coming," he called, sticking the sketchbook into his bag. He was nearly at the door when he realized - his
have to do so when his face is
He took a deep breath, looking at himself in the mirror again.  Tony looked like Clark Gable in a few ways. Mostly because they were both dark-haired, but they also had similar builds, broad in the shoulder and chest.  One thing Steve had never been sure about was what color Clark Gable's eyes were, as the films were all in black and white, and he didn't know how accurate the movie posters were.  With Tony, though, it was easy to tell. His eyes were very big and very blue. Sure, Steve knew he had blue eyes himself. He'd seen them in the mirror enough. But looking at Steve Rogers in the mirror just wasn't the same as looking at Tony Stark.  The latter was definitely better.
Steve let the curtains drop shut, turning back toward the table.  "They're still people, Stark."
“Okay,” Steve says, even as his heart flutters a little in his chest.  Tony—Tony is so
The helmet gets put on last, and once it’s secured Tony immediately accesses the news outlets, unable to help but grin as he scrolls past the latest headlines.  “You fought another Master Man, huh?  Nice.”
Eighteen years since he had first brought Steve here in the first place, watching his eyes light up in surprise and delight and finding himself inevitably, irrevocably, falling in love.
There wasn't time for reflection or tears, not yet.  There wasn't even time to reach over and close Yinsen's eyes, because that required a level of dexterity that Tony didn't possess when wearing the gauntlets.  There was only time to move forward.
"We can't—" Steve began, and then he tripped over a fallen tree branch.  Before he knew it, he was crashing to the ground, Bucky's body tumbling past him like a ragdoll.  He cursed to himself and struggled back to his feet, but his limbs gave up on him, and he fell back down.
So he summoned him in his mind's eye: the Steve who always got back up when fighting bullies in Brooklyn, the Steve who had stood his ground when facing off against his father, the Steve who charged so fearlessly into battle even knowing what awaited him in his future.  It came to him like breathing, because Tony knew Steve in a way he knew nothing else, the way he moved and felt, and so long as he lived he would know him.
Hours passed.  Lizards and insects skittered toward him, then away, as though they wanted nothing to do with him.  Tony wondered more than once if his suit would become his coffin.
Steve let out a long sigh, glancing down at their intertwined fingers.  "It doesn't change anything. It doesn't fix anything."
"The hell—" Steve began, but then he felt a hand against his shoulder, turning to see Stark shaking his head at him.  Steve was tempted to keep yelling anyway, but something in Stark's eyes made him go quiet.  It felt so wrong, brutally stabbing what must have once been a friend of hers, but… it was done.  "Now what?" he asked after a moment.
"Mmm," Stark replied, but otherwise said nothing as he lit one candle and went to the shelf of food.
was just… strange.  Not that the idea of anyone else calling him that sat with Steve any better.
"But," Tony said anyway.
But everything else had.  "Okay," Steve said.  "Well… I'm glad you won't be keeling over.  I'm still upset about… before, but I do prefer you alive."
Tony blinked and smiled up at him, though his smile faded as he got out the thread and needle.  "Time for the fun part."
Damn it.  Someone flying over them right now, here in an archaeological site in central China, was almost certainly an enemy and a bad sign.  "We have to get out of here."
Feeling better now that he had some sort of plan, he went upstairs, made his voicelog for the day, and then sketched out thumbnails in an old notebook until he fell asleep.
At that, Tony grinned widely, glancing up from the fabric he was measuring.  Steve was way too shy about these things, and he could only imagine how out of the loop his poor mom was.  "I would
Steve stared at Tony blankly for a moment, barely able to process it.  It had already been such a terrible weapon to start with, and to hear that it was used to effectively end civilization as they knew it… "I don't understand," he said.  "It wasn't meant for that.  Was it?"
“Jesus, Steve,” Tony managed weakly, looking back at him.  “What the hell are you saying?”  Vividly, he remembered shooting twin blasts into that other sabretooth’s mouth, but… “Do you want me to
It was the last letter.  Tony's gaze was drawn back to the bit about the cognac, how it was the only thing besides Sarah's replies that Joseph looked forward to.
Stark let out his breath in a soft hiss, turning to gaze in the direction they'd come from.  "Be right back."
, his every breath tickling his member?  Christ, he must be doing this on purpose.  “Yes,” Steve growls, and he finds himself hooking a leg around Tony’s back.  “Trust me.  You’d know if I wasn’t.”
He just had to figure out what it was.
There was another woman there.  She was asleep, her face pale and her body swaddled in blankets.  Natasha shut the door and turned back to them.  "Yelena," she said.  "My… colleague, you could say.  Maybe even my rival, once.  But she's one of the few people I have left.  I can't lose her."
"Tony!" Cap shouted at him, his face specked with red—God, was that Tony's
Once he was done, Tony turned back to the other man, who appeared to have finished some time ago.  “Ready?” Rogers asked.  Tony nodded, and so Rogers turned on the flashlight and put out the fire, then ducked out of the igloo, Tony following.  “Smell that?” Rogers said, his nose wrinkling in the dim light.
"You didn't have to stay up for me," she said, but she was smiling gently.  "I know you don't get enough sleep as it is."
, but he’s here now.
"I," Cap said, but then failed to follow up with anything meaningful.  Tony stared at him a moment longer, and finally Cap shook his head.  "No.  Sorry.  It was just a rough landing, is all.  Let's go."
Tony squeezed his eyes back shut, hoping he hadn't been caught still awake.  Even though this was just a dream - a long, strange dream - he was still scared of what might happen if he were found to be pretending to be the blond-haired boy he'd seen in the mirror.  The man's tiredness could so easily give way to something worse. He'd seen it enough in his own father, and here, he had no dog to curl up against for comfort.
“You sure?” Steve asks.  Tony fights the urge to glance back at him.  Seriously, those eyes of his—God.  He could get lost in them.
“Of course I do.”  Of course he didn’t.  What did Rogers think, that he had a map of this place tucked away somewhere?  Not that he wanted Rogers to think otherwise, really.  If he knew just how clueless Tony was, no doubt he’d bodily haul him up and take him back to the airship, and that was the last thing Tony needed, regardless of how mentally pleasing the image was.  Best to fake confidence.  “Just follow me.”  At the very least, he knew they had to go in
Steve thought about Bucky, about his metal arm and his relationship with Natasha and how Steve would never know what truly happened to him because he was
“Steve…”  Everything in Tony wants to say yes, especially the part of his mind that can’t even remember the relationship going to hell between the two of them, the part of his mind that loves Steve more than anything.  But just because he can’t remember doesn’t mean he doesn’t
Tony shakes his head, promptly scooping Steve up into his arms bridal-style and ignoring his protests.  “Showing you that movie was such a bad idea,” he says before flying them back to Stark Tower.  Once they’re there, Tony gets out of his suit and steers Steve to the bed in one of the guest rooms, making him lie down.  “Jarvis would do this, but he’s sleeping and I don’t want to wake him, so you’re stuck with me.  So strip,” Tony commands, and, looking amused, Steve does.
.  Damn him.
“I’m a genius,” Tony tells him.  “But I can’t predict
"Answer me when I speak to you, boy!"
This was - not entirely surprising, Steve had to admit to himself.  Tony slept in only his underwear at school, and Steve was starting to suspect that the reason he even had underwear was because Ty was liable to barge into his room at all hours of the day.  And now that he was at home, there was apparently no more need for that last bit of modesty. Here he was, just… completely exposed.
“Holy shit,” he gasped, arms flailing as he scrambled backwards, reaching for his pack so that he could retrieve his gauntlets.  The giant sabretooth whined, and Tony blinked, belatedly remembering that oh right, this was the kind of company he was keeping these days because his life was crazy.  “…Sorry,” he said after a moment, still trying to catch his breath.  Was Steve trying not to laugh?  It looked like he was trying not to laugh.  “Hey.  I dare you to react any differently if our positions had been reversed.”  Really!  If Steve had been in Tony’s position, he’d probably have decapitated him with his shield by now.
This was it.  This was when he had to decide what kind of person Steve Rogers was going to be.
attitude, he told himself that there was no way he'd let this Ty fella win.
"Mr. Stark."
"Other things," Cap repeated.  "Like thwarting Nazi plans to find magical relics?"
sure was Steve's mom's, but… it didn't sound so good.  It was weak and rough and hoarse. "What'd I tell you yesterday?"
Steve wordlessly turns back toward him, reaching over and curling around his body—and somehow, Tony feels a little bit warmer now.  Or maybe he just feels less cold.  “I love you,” Steve says, very quietly.
Honestly, he didn’t know anything.  But the cave drawings had suggested that the tallest mountain in the area was a good place to be, and if there was something,
that you would confide to your future wife about this… perhaps this will help.”
Well, today didn't mean right now, so for the time being, Steve figured he had an opportunity to explore and get used to things.  The first order of business, now that he'd caught up on the latest voicelogs, was to get dressed. So he pushed the covers off, swinging his legs off the bed -
Sunset takes a bite out of her crumpet, glaring at him again.  “It’s for your
, Steve had written, and it was ridiculous that he'd started things off with an apology.
Stark flapped one hand.  "Loud," he said briskly.  "Can't stay in the air forever, and with the noise I'd probably get mobbed whenever I landed."
Along the same note, while Tony wasn't sure exactly which benefits had been provided to soldiers back then, there were probably at least a few.  And with Steve's health problems, to put it lightly, maybe he'd have a chance to get them looked at.
Tony had read the details once.  There weren't many available to the general public, but what little he'd seen hadn't been pretty.  And yet it had been almost horrifyingly predictable - Captain America, war hero, had died doing something heroic during the course of the war.  The exact cause of death had never been revealed, but whatever it was had involved partial remains being recovered from the English Channel, which had then been buried at Arlington National Cemetery.  And so it was only the tales of Cap's deeds that had lived on past the end of the war, while Cap himself never survived to see it.
Jarvis rolled his shoulders.  "Your archeologist friend evacuated because of the Japanese, and we're looking for something the Nazis are also hunting."
Steve blinks, glancing over at the clock on the wall as he shakes Tony’s hand.  “Um, yeah, I guess I am.  Is this a problem?”
And so they split up, each heading in their assigned direction, with Cap staying where he was.  Tony jogged around the parts that were already excavated, only slowing down to examine the occasional remains to see if they seemed relevant.
Tony pulls away, putting his finger against Steve’s lips again.  “Steve,” he says.  “You’re not
?  God, he didn't want to think about what Dad would say about that.  His only comfort was that Dad probably didn't care enough to actually look at what he was taking, so he'd probably never even find out.
"If I say yes, will you let it go?"
Jarvis headed for the door, apparently deciding this conversation was over.  "I'll be landing the airship now," he told them.  "Start preparing to disembark."  Then he left, Pepper and Rhodey following after him.
.  “I got upgraded, Steve.  I’m faster.  Stronger.  We’re better-equipped than ever.”  When Steve doesn’t say anything, continuing to glare at him instead, Tony adds, “Please.  Your heart rate’s risen by twenty beats per minute since we’ve started this conversation.  Calm down.”
Realizing he was staring, Tony quickly looked back down at his own sad pack of beans before Rogers could catch him, picking up a fork and beginning to chow down.  Aside from the sound of Rogers’ chewing, which Tony had to admit was kind of obscenely loud, they ate in silence—Rogers, obviously, was in no state to talk, and Tony didn’t really have anything to say.  When they were done, he packed up all their things, frowning disapprovingly at Rogers’ bowl.  “Ew,” he said.  “Sabretooth slobber.”
He’s already in his sleepwear that evening when Sunset lets herself into his room, looking around and frowning.  “I see that you once again have no plans to invite me to your bed tonight,” she says, sounding testy as she picks up a small object from his desk, prodding it.  “What is this, a turbine?  Did you make this after dinner?”
Once he was done panting, though, the realization of what this meant dawned on him.  His heart was better, it seemed.  There was no more battery, no more danger of running out of power.  Just the gem, which needed no charge.  Whether it had actually
“Oh?” asks the man.  “You like to fly?”
That earned him a laugh, for some reason.  "You're
But then his brow furrows a bit, and he glances up at the deck above.  “Damn,” he murmurs.  “My father’s up there.  He’s probably looking for me.”
It wasn't, and Tony was frankly exhausted and he still hurt everywhere, and yet… he found himself not caring all that much.  "It's fine, Cap," he said.
, apparently, Steve just had to treat this as much worse than it actually was.
But he'd seen things now.  He knew things.  Jessica and Carol.  Him and Bucky.  Tony and his father.  It wasn't wrong, and—he had to do this.  For Tony.
He'd become Captain America.
Thoughts of Ma came to him unbidden, and immediately Steve could feel his throat go tight as he tried to block them off; still they persisted.  He couldn't help it. Tony's Pa naturally made him draw parallels to his own Ma, who was kinder, happier, better than him in every way.
As it turned out, said practice referred to track and field, which was not exactly one of Steve's strong points in his waking life.  That by itself shouldn't have been a problem - he was dreaming, after all, so shouldn't he have been able to zoom past anything and anyone?  But track and field apparently consisted of far more than just running as fast as you could, as though you were chasing a fleeing bully. He thought he'd be able to handle it at first - this Tony fella he'd dreamed up was quick on his feet,
He screamed in pain, fire shooting up the length of his arm, but somehow he found it in himself to tighten his grip despite the agony, a voice in his head reminding him that what he was holding onto was far more important than himself.  He couldn't fail Cap.  He wouldn't.
sound.
"Ms. Potts damaged them when she took control of the airship," Cap said.  His brow furrowed a little.  "You know she's a war correspondent on the Pacific front?"
One night, as the two of them sit on the couch together watching the end credits to
Steve frowned a bit and turned his attention to Tony.  "She's a strange one," he said.  "You learn anything about her?  Was anything unusual?"
"Right," Tony said.  "And someone with your skills would definitely be nice to have around."
"Master Anthony," the man greeted.
was his second.
“Okay,” Steve says, and the word is barely a whisper.  “I’ll miss you, Tony.”
Steve must have been so scared.  He'd probably been scared since Ma had first fallen ill, and then he'd chosen to never bring it up in a hopeless attempt to make it not real, even as Tony had continued to mention it.  And the thought of Steve scared like that, living in a body that was already so frail with that kind of crippling fear, made something in Tony's chest ache.
and none of their communication devices worked down here.  He glanced down at his chest, idly tapping at the metal plate that he knew was there.  “You can hang on for seven days, can’t you?” he asked.
“W-what?” Tony stammers.  He shimmies away again.
Tony blinked up at her, then took the papers back.  "Thanks," he said as he slowly turned them over in his hands.  "Almost forgot about these."
“R-right,” Tony manages.  Is… is Steve
"Isn't it?" Tony countered, sounding anguished again as his hands threaded through Steve's hair with increasing agitation.  "You've been bit, Steve.  Because I couldn't stop it in time."
He’s sleeping when his Avengers card, which he keeps mostly out of habit, goes off, and when he turns it on, Carol’s voice, sounding calm but restrained, becomes audible.  “Tony?” she asks.  “Is that you?”
Tony looked at him, realized Steve was looking back, and then quickly glanced away.  "Soviet spies say funny things, huh?"
Feeling slightly calmer about things now, he made himself read the rest of Steve's entry.  There actually wasn't that much left, which seemed unusual, given the content -
down on us."
me you and Iron Man were the same,” he huffs once they’re back at the mansion.  Tony throws up his hands, listens to a few lectures about trust, and eventually things return back to normal between them, but it’s funny.  Once his closely-guarded secret is out to Steve, he feels better, not worse, and somehow their relationship gets even better once Steve knows the truth.
Cap made another grab for Tony's hand, and this time he managed to hold on.  Tony hurried to pull him up, cognizant of the fact that they were so close to this ordeal being over—
“He’ll be okay, then?” Tony asks the lead surgeon as she comes out, and she nods, somewhat pointedly telling him that Steve will recover quickly as long as he doesn’t immediately run off to battle.  Behind him, he hears Carol snort, but the news is so good to hear that he feels his knees buckle, and he has to reach out to support himself against the wall.
"Doesn't mean
"Uh huh," Tony said as he looked around.  "Nice place you've got.  How many people here?"  He hadn't, Steve noticed, mentioned that they were planning on looking for a cure, too.
"A woman?" Rhodey pressed, intrigued.
Steeling himself, Tony finally made himself open up the lid, letting it scan his face and boot up everything.  How must Steve have felt when he saw the new GUI with its new layout and colors, he wondered? Had he figured out that the laptop had a touchscreen?  Would he have marveled at it, or was he too jaded by everything by now?
"So," he said finally.  "Cap.  Steve.  I gotta ask—what is this?  What are we doing?"
“A secret place.”
A knot of dread settled deep into the pit of Tony's stomach.  Nonetheless, on instinct, he got onto a motorcycle to follow after it, intuiting the controls as Bucky settled in behind him.  The drone was still slow, but it was picking up speed, and they were running out of options fast. Part of his mind screamed at him that this mission wasn't as harmless as it seemed, that there was a real chance that danger would befall them, and that this could very well be it.  Soon enough, it was his whole mind screaming that, and Tony realized he had no choice but to take the coward's way out, because better for Steve to be cowardly and alive than selfless and dead.
Through it all, Tony stood off to the side where he'd be away from the fight, and he stared.
"This is
Rogers tapped at the watch’s face.  “It’s not working right,” he said.  “It’s stuck at 1:23.”
“Well?” Steve presses once he’s on, peering over at him.  “C-come on, Tony.  You too.”
Cap still looked suspicious, but he went over to Tony's pack, digging out the notebook and bringing it over.  Tony accepted it with his good hand, glad that Cap hadn't thought to pull out the pen he'd stuck into the spiral of it.  "Thanks," he said.  He felt like he was thanking Cap a lot, but he did have a lot to thank Cap for.
Tony’s hand slides away, and the moment ends.  “Maybe,” he says, his fingers running against the cool metal of the rail.  “And so do you.  But we can’t always get what we want.”  He draws back then, looking at Steve, his eyes melancholy.  “I’d better head back before my father sends people out to hunt for me,” he continues wryly.  “Thank you for tonight.  I think that that was the most fun I’ve had in my entire life.  I’ll see you later, okay?”
Instead, he tried some of the other adjacent tiles, carefully triggering them with his toes.  Finally he found one that seemed safe, albeit awkwardly positioned from his current spot.  But as soon as he started stepping over to it, a loud, pulsing sound issued from aboveground, enough that Tony could feel the vibration in his bones, and he found himself losing his balance—
Finally, Steve does.  “I shouldn’t have shouted at you,” he says.
Still, he thought as he brushed a finger over the scribbled
Tony huffed as he got a napkin to clean the wet spot off his shirt.  "What are you even talking about?" he asked. "You have a whole day to work on it."
Tony inhales, exhales, and then rubs his eyes to make sure he’s seeing right.  “It’s you,” he says after a long moment, and she just quirks her lips, slipping her bracelet back on.
That was, Steve remembered, what Pa had done so many years ago.  He hadn't run, but he'd left the country, gone so far away from home, to fight for something that mattered to him.  Maybe it wasn't such a strange idea.
It was irritating to not do anything, but Tony had to grudgingly admit that Cap was in much better shape to be pulling out people from deep holes than Tony currently was.  He resigned himself to examining the edges of the hole instead, wondering how it had been disguised, and that was when he smelled the smoke—and also when, as if on cue, Tony felt his transceiver vibrate, spelling out Jarvis' distress signal.  "We're in trouble," he announced.
"I suppose I'll take that as a compliment," Jarvis said.  He took a seat across from Steve, folding his hands in front of him.  "Distracting you from your usual pastries is probably high praise, indeed."
"Of course," Stark said softly, gazing at the wall behind Steve's head, "we didn't actually realize that at first.  Everything had happened so quickly.  All we knew was that the bite was fatal.  We thought getting
One thing was for sure - he couldn't stay.  Gripping his head in a vain attempt to stop the pounding, he managed to stumble out of bed without making too much noise, spotting what looked like his shirt lying on the floor and pulling it on.  Then, with a glance back at Ty to make sure Steve hadn't woken him, he left the room, shutting the door behind him.
“—And you’re no doctor, either, so quit it.”  He pulled his shirt on a little too forcibly, grunting softly in pain afterward.  Right.  It would be good to keep in mind that he kind of had fractured ribs right now.  “Onward.”
His dad's letter…?  Tony panicked briefly, having no idea what Bucky was talking about - until he realized there was something tucked away between the pages of the sketchbook.  He opened it up, finding a folded piece of paper inside and skimming over the words written within. He knew this letter. It was the last letter Steve's dad had written to his mom, the one that spoke of the horrors of war while simultaneously professing that he would do this again and again if that was what it took to keep her safe.  What was it doing here, he wondered?
Steve took a deep breath, and Tony thought he could somehow detect a note of anxiousness in there.  "What I'm trying to say, Tony, is that I'm fighting for - uh, I'm… I'm fighting for… someone too." In the ensuing silence, the irrational disappointment Tony felt was almost palpable.  But then - "No," Steve continued suddenly, and the solidness of his voice stood in stark contrast to what he'd sounded like just moments ago. "No, I'll do this right, because there's not enough time to do this wrong.  I'm doing this for you, Tony. I will never be able to see you with my own two eyes. And I will never hear you with my own ears or touch you with my own hands. But I can shape your future because I'm your past. And if anything I've accomplished as Captain America makes that future better, then no matter what happens to me, it'll be worth it.  You are worth it.
“Of course I remembered.”  He can feel Steve lowering their arms, the other man bringing their hands to his front so that he can embrace him.  “I know I can’t give you a lot, Tony.  I have the clothes on my back and about ten dollars in my pocket.  But… I can give you this.”
This time, Tony seemed to hear him, and he jolted, pulling the shovel out.  "Steve," he said, voice raspy.  Whatever strength he'd had seemed to drain out of him, because his knees buckled, and he had to grip hard on his shovel to stay up.
"I've ruined a lot of people," Tony replied, managing to keep his voice relatively steady.  He thought about his first night on the mission, lighting Virgil's candle.  "And I can assure you, it all mattered to me."
.  This place was the opposite of that, and he wasn’t sure how his gauntlets would do in such an enclosed area.  Then again, that just meant now was the best time to find out.  “Okay,” he said.  “Let’s fight.  How hard can it be?  It’s just a cat.”
The next thing was the pounding headache, which was making him not want to move anywhere.  To make things worse, he also felt as though his mouth was stuffed with cotton; it was so dry.  He wanted water, but he couldn't move. Ugh.
"What do you want," he said flatly, even though he already knew what Dougie wanted.  His fists clenched in anticipation.
“Yeah,” Tony said again.  He grinned, feeling like a huge weight had been lifted off his shoulders.  Getting back home was nothing compared to what he’d feared had happened to Steve.  “Don’t worry.  I have a plan.”  He reached into his own pack, thankful that he’d gone through the trouble of lugging everything with him, even after Steve had run off.  “Remember those fireworks you saw earlier?  The ones you looked like you wanted to nag me about?”
Tony was scared.  Just the idea of Steve somewhere out there, all alone as the sun set—it was enough to make his throat go dry, to make his chest constrict painfully.  Because once that sun went down, and they weren’t at the top of that mountain, then based on Tony’s best guess, Steve was going to stay a sabretooth.  Worse, Tony feared that he was going to stay an
And he was Steve.  Thin, asthmatic Steve, who in the coming days would undergo a procedure to make him as heroic on the outside as he was on the inside.
Tony let out a nervous laugh that was loud enough that Steve could see Luke, a ways off, glancing their way momentarily before turning his attention back to Jessica.  "You could say that," he said.  "I know about it because in 1939, I found out that Hydra used it on my father and turned him into Baron Zemo."
Nonetheless, he bends down, plucking a couple of flowers off the ground, and he tries to remember the way Steve would look at them so intently, brow furrowed before he put his pencil to paper and began to sketch them.
, and he remembered he'd thought that it absolutely
"And then I remembered the other thing you wrote.  'Don't go.' So I put two and two together and I guess I figured out, kind of, what was gonna happen, which I'm assuming is why you didn't want me to go.  But obviously you can see I went, and - and maybe you're upset that I did; I don't know. So I wanted to explain why I went, and why I'm still there even after I realized what'll probably happen to me."
“Hi,” Tony finds himself saying.
Finally, though, he forced himself to open his eyes again, gaze landing once more on the paw just barely in his field of vision.  Even if he didn’t go anywhere, even if Steve-as-a-sabretooth was still alive and interested in eating him, he just… he had to say something.  So slowly, he reached out, laying one hand lightly against the paw, fearing he’d wake him up but needing to make some sort of contact, and then he let his eyes flutter shut once more, taking a deep, shuddering breath.
Tony's raised eyebrows made it clear what he thought of that idea, and he glanced down meaningfully at one of the woman's hands, which was still holding a pistol.  At least the other one was sheathed.  "If you're hanging onto that, then I'm sure you won't mind me hanging onto my things," he said.
"I know."  Tony turned away, letting out a yawn.  "Thank you."
The agent leaves.  A lawyer arrives.
He took a few deep breaths, trying to ground himself.  A dream, he thought. A dream where he was a boy named Tony.
“What—” Tony begins, stepping away from Steve in surprise as two stewards approach him, making the other man take off his jacket.  “Father, what the hell—”
Tony wins.
Steve looked down.  He wasn't sure this was a conversation he wanted to have, so he changed the topic.  "Do you think the woman is alone?"
"Closer, darling," Tony said softly, and Steve couldn't help but comply, drawing nearer to him as though Tony were a magnet.  "There are some things I should tell you."
"I can't expect great things out of you if you're falling apart," Cap said, but it looked like he was trying to hide a smile of his own.
"I'm gonna make things right again.  You'll see."
“Impossible,” he hears Steve murmur.  And suddenly, the other man’s arms are around him, holding him tight.  “Well, whatever it is, Tony… I hope you can overcome it.  Everyone deserves to be happy.”
"Is that what you did?"
After several minutes of searching, his fears were confirmed—Steve had apparently wandered off entirely, and Tony had no idea where.  This was bad.  Should he stay and wait for him to come back?  What if he didn’t?
Well, he supposes he’s a bit too inebriated right now to really come up with a proper rebuttal.
Finally, near midnight, a hand was laid against his shoulder.  Steve jolted from his seat, looking around blearily. There was a dark-haired woman in front of him - when had she arrived?  He must have fallen asleep, having curled up in a chair with some paper so that he could sketch what he remembered of the Starks' garden.
"Stark is still unconscious," the man said smoothly, unperturbed.  "The gas we used had previously been untested on humans, and he is not handling it as well as you are.  The paralytic agent he was injected with complicates things further."
yeah so i'm kinda going to be really extremely very mean to tony but it

He’s only twenty-one, but there are scars on his arms and on his thighs and so many more over his ribs, because that’s the coldest part, that’s where the crushing weight tends to settle, but
He’s only twenty-one, and he’s all alone, yet heading up one of the most profitable companies on the planet.
