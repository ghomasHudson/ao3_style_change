"Of course I do," Steve whispered, carefully helping him back down onto the bed, kissing his cheek this time. "I'll still be here when you wake up again, darling."
Steve had saved his life by taking the brunt of that blast, and he wasn't sure if his husband even
Something was definitely wrong. While he couldn’t place a finger on what it was, Steve knew that something wasn’t right. When he woke up, there was this feeling on his lips, like… he couldn’t explain it. There was something wrong, there was something missing, and yet he couldn’t explain
laughing at him, or the thought that he would ever be a good husband to someone like Steve. No, of course. Now he just needed… to convince himself of that.
It wasn't like they hadn't been dating for a while now. The two were inseparable. Steve had told Tony that he was happy about it, since Bucky had come a long way since they'd brought him home from being Hydra's brainwashed assassin. Steve got his best friend back, the team was all happy, and everything had been going pretty smoothly up until a few days previous. That's when Loki apparently decided to mix things up a bit, and they found themselves in a fairytale world.

"When did you make that? I could've used that earlier!" Clint complained, crossing his arms.

Steve glanced back and forth between Tony and Bruce. His boyfriend was staring at the doctor, eyes wide and scared, while Bruce opened the first aid kit.
Steve barely had a chance to stand up before two people appeared from the rainbow colors of the portal. Tony ran over and attack-hugged him the moment that he laid eyes on the super-soldier. Clint, who'd had his bow strung and ready, lowered his weapon and hurried over.
It was painful to pull out of Bucky's grip so that he could grab his suit.
"Glad you don't have a problem with... this," the Captain chuckled, gesturing to the way that Stark was glancing between the two and smirking.
worried about a villain, thank you, but now you're giving me more things to worry about. Great. Thank you for that."
"You're not going to lose me," Steve murmured, loosening his grip on Tony just enough to be able to look him in the eye. "It can't be because I'm an Avenger. You've never had a problem with me being on the team before..." Tony could almost see it in his eyes as he tried to solve the problem. Solving problems was something that Steve was always too good at. "It's because of Bucky, isn't it?"
done that. Only Bucky had little to no memories of what he'd been forced to do in his past.
It felt like it was all his fault. There wasn’t a single thing that he could do that would make a difference, and being the genius that he was, he wasn’t ready to accept that. He
"I don't exist here?" Clint gasped, and Steve wrapped an arm around his shoulders.
"You're right," he said between kisses. "No more Mom and Dad dinners—we're taking the kids out tonight, too."
“You were missing, and I… I had to figure out where you were,” Steve whispered.
"That might work," Tony mused, and once more there was a sparkle in his eyes that told Steve he could relax. It was nice, being able to go out somewhere with just the two of them. He did miss Team Dinner, and he knew that Tony did too. At dinner, they'd been talking about their team like they were their
The thing that he
The only thing that scared Steve more than anything was the possibility of losing a teammate during a battle. They'd become like a family to him, so the thought of never having them around again really hurt inside. They were his
before. Clint and Natasha had taken back control of the plane and were heading towards the closest S.H.I.E.L.D. base to put the plane down and arrest the Hydra agents. He was trying to take down the Hydra agents and keep them away from the S.H.I.E.L.D. weapons that they'd been trying to steal, but apparently they'd already taken a few weapons.
But when he went home, after a long day of working, he didn’t have any time to think about blueberries. No, because the baby was being fussy and the older two were driving their mother crazy and Peggy was grouchy and in pain and life was just all-around exhausting.
There was no way that he was going to let his teammates get hurt because he didn't destroy the big guns—the ones that could
"I know it was pretty strange... the first time I accidently ended up in another universe," the alternate-him said, patting his shoulder. He was standing nearby, watching as the Avengers attempted to help Jarvis with the last of the cooking. Steve wasn't sure if he should try to join in or not, but it was a little overwhelming because they were so much like his family, his team, and just seeing them made him miss his own team. He knew that fixing up a portal to come get him would take some time, and he should enjoy the time he had with this team.
The pure joy on Tony's face was stunning as he reached out, gingerly taking Steve's hand like the first time that they'd danced together, carefully, before he let himself get pulled out of bed into strong arms that would always be there to keep him safe. Tony stole a quick kiss before pressing his head to Steve's chest, listening to his heartbeat as Steve rubbed his back. Yep, everything really was perfect.
. “You’re sure they weren’t teasing you—they actually laughed?
“I can’t go through that again, I just
But this morning, something was different. He couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was, but he could feel that something was...
It was enough for Steve to be able to tell that he was having a nightmare. Gently turning his boyfriend around so that he was facing him, he saw the subtle twitches in Tony's face, which normally looked so peaceful when he was sleep. But now—he looked terrified. A small whimper escaped Tony when Steve carefully placed a hand on his shoulder. It broke his heart.
Clint grinned at the little faerie. "Then we'll be fine, right?"
Bruce didn’t know how right he was.
"Well, Janet's the girl we call Giant-Girl, pretty self-explanatory. Ororo, we call her Storm, is the one who was manipulating the weather. Peter is Spider-Man and Logan is Wolverine... it should be easy to tell which one's which," Iron Man said. "You don't have
The quiet beeping of the heartrate monitor was nearly deafening, but… Tony had been the one who insisted that they kept it on. He needed to know that Steve was still alive, that his heart was still beating. It wasn’t necessary anymore, because he wasn’t in any danger, but… it was comforting.

Steve and Bucky were so close—they'd

felt real.
Did they just think it was okay for Steve to date him, as long as it wasn’t something permanent?
All in all, it wasn't like much had changed. The team got used to it just as much as Tony was getting used to it.
glad that you're by my side," Steve said, gripping Tony's hand. The genius smiled at him.
“I do have a team… I have a team,” he said, repeating it a few more times. He had names, people he had to find. He needed to know where they were and that they were
"I'm going to tell them," Tony said, faceplate flipping open as he started off for the tower.
“But they’re not going to

them. Like he hadn’t been touching her at all. Shaking his head, he pressed a kiss to his youngest’s forehead.
After all, trusting anyone and anything was difficult when the shapeshifters could look like anyone.
Tony just shrugged. Steve sighed, gripping his hand a little tighter before he pulled, and Tony got up and came closer. Steve captured his teammate in a hug, pulling him down onto the bed.
"I understand. I'm not mad, Steve," Bucky said, keeping a tight grip on one of his hands. "They told me
“The ritual’s starting,” the guy replied, looking far too eager for whatever was going to happen. “Those beasts keep coming back here, and the more we get rid of them, the less power that witch has over this place.”
“Congratulations! Fuck, we really messed that up, didn’t we? I should’ve known that you wouldn’t joke around with something like that this morning, but I just thought—this is great news though! It’s about time—I always knew that the two of you would get married one day,” Clint said, patting Tony’s back.
He reached for his shield, which wasn’t there. The vibranium shield would’ve been enough to break those chains.
"Where do you want to be?" Tony asked, muting his and Clint's comms. as they looked around for the best tactical location.
Now, as they went into battle, Steve couldn't help but worry. This was the first time that Bucky was fighting alongside the team as an official Avenger. He'd asked about Iron Man, and why the man didn't stay with the rest of the team. Steve had tried explaining how Iron Man's identity was secret, and how he had a life outside of being an Avenger that he didn't want to be affected by him being a superhero, but Bucky hadn't been so thrilled about the answer.
"Iron Man," the scientist in the cage shouted, and Tony looked over at him. "Iron Man, you have to let me out! They blackmailed me, I swear. A lot of that stuff is dangerous. Iron Man!"
a genius," Steve murmured, smiling at the thought of his boyfriend. It still made him feel giddy inside, calling Tony his boyfriend. It had taken forever for him to chase away the press, to try and convince them that
Steve covered his mouth to try and contain his laughter, unlike Clint.

woke him up.
that the team feels the same."
The huge werewolf snarled at snapped at people but wasn’t close enough to anyone to actually hurt them. Steve was frozen in place, staring at those golden-brown eyes, wishing that he knew what was going on, wishing that there was some sort of human intelligence in them.
The faceplate hissed as the latch came undone, moving up to reveal the terrified face of his lovely boyfriend. He looked pale, far paler than he should've looked. Was he bleeding out? How could he have missed that? "How did you know?"
Once he'd caught his breath and recovered from the fall—it was a height that normal people wouldn't have been waking up from, and while it hurt like hell, he healed quickly—Steve charged over to where the 'DoomBots' were, managing to take out quite a few before the battle died down.
you they'd figure it out," Natasha said, and Tony was glad that she and Bruce both looked so happy. He was glad for them.
Blasting out a couple of the lasers, Tony managed to get a hole in the roof right when the team busted in through the front. Steve dropped down into the building while Tony landed beside him, repulsors up and ready to take out Hydra. Steve charged off into the battle, shield raised as he started taking down Hydra agents.
"You ready to end this?" Tony asked, patting Steve's shoulder while he got his shield off his back.

“Papa,” the kids repeated, and the youngest started crying from her room.
"You know, if we were to try to just sit out here and enjoy the day, we wouldn't be able to," Steve said, settling down on a park bench. Tony took a seat beside him, smiling a little when Steve wrapped an arm around his shoulders like a teenager on a first date would. There was a blush on the blond's face, and a soft smile on his lips. How did he end up so lucky as to have Steve as a husband? He'd never know. "I think that's what I like most about this situation. I know that it's going to be fixed, and I'm glad that it's going to be fixed, but I'm glad that we can just enjoy our time a little."
No, they must’ve been laughing at the fact that Steve would marry

“I can do that,” Steve promised. “I don’t know why they took you, Tony, but I’m so glad you’re alive. I was worried that they… that they got rid of you. That’s what your doppelganger told me when I was interrogating him. He told me they’d already killed you, but… I knew he was lying.”
As the Skrull lifted him up ever so gingerly and started carrying him out of the room, Tony let himself lean against the alien’s chest. After all, if he was going to be ‘rescued,’ then he was going to at least enjoy being carried around. At least he got to see Steve’s face again.
He was going to ask him out.

“I don’t know anyone named Tony,” Peggy said calmly. “And neither do you, Steve.” Before he could say more, she added, “Go check on the children, darling. They need you.
Steve watched as Iron Man shot off into the sky, back over to where there were several other people that he guessed were the Avengers. The multiverse? This place obviously wasn't his own world. He recognized Iron Man, Captain America and the Hulk among the heroes that were fighting off the 'DoomBots,' but he didn't recognize anyone else. There was a

thing," he murmured. "I know I'd rather have you here by my side any day. You know that, right Tony? Because... while I know that these next few days aren't going to be easy for you... you seem to have forgotten that."
Setting up his own search had been simple, but tracking down the super-soldier proved to be a lot harder. The whole team was helping out, but even with all of the help Tony was struggling with tracking down his and Steve's missing boyfriend.
The thought of losing his entire family made the tears fall freely from his eyes, blurring his vision. He was breathing hard, trying to figure out where he was.
“It’s okay,” Tony tried saying. Why didn’t he check the date? This whole thing… all of those negative thoughts… if only he’d checked the date…

“Steve?” Tony asked at last, probably now finally coming to his senses.
"Wait, how do we get home?" Steve asked. "Do you know? Is there a way?"
“The man who did this… he didn’t think that you were ever going to wake up,” Bruce said as the team slowly approached. Steve smiled at them, and they all seemed to relax. “He was convinced that you were going to be stuck in that simulation… forever. But then you seemed to be… struggling against the simulation, and we thought… he said that if we shut down the simulation it was going to kill you, and the only way to get you back was to wait until you woke up…”
"I'm staying up with you," Stark decided, jumping onto the couch.

Steve, poor, sweet Steve, had never seemed as nervous as when he asked Tony to marry him. The inventor hadn’t expected it, but after an incredible day and then a sweet evening with just his man, Tony had been presented with a ring and an adorable declaration of loving him forever. They’d been dating for around three years, so it really shouldn’t have been too much of a surprise, but…

It wasn't something he liked to think about—anyone dying in battle, really. But he thought about it a lot—constantly, every time he led the team into the fray. It

"I mean.... it was impossible to hide it from me, and you didn't mean to send Steve to another universe, Clint and Natasha are spies so I wouldn't be surprised if they figured it out... And to be honest I wouldn't be surprised if Bucky knew, too," Bruce said, shrugging. "It's not that you're bad at keeping secrets—the media never figured it out, and you've been Iron Man for a

"I'm glad I'm back, too," Bucky mumbled, yawning. "I think there's something you need to go do, Stevie."
Tony just rolled his eyes. “Okay, big guy, you can let me walk myself out of here from now on. Don’t act like you don’t know what you did.”
Tony grinned a grin that was so characteristically
Steve laughed as he stripped his clothes off, giving Tony a kiss that promised that he would forget about those dinner plans in just a little bit. It was a good thing that Jarvis would remind them, wouldn't want to disappoint the kids.
“I know it can’t be easy after…” …after Steve lost Michael and Mary and Susan and the baby, the children he thought that he had.

“Come
“There’s a sofa bed in the living room, very comfy, it’s gonna be good,” he says, maybe a bit over enthusiastically, just as Tony is finishing lacing up his shoes. It really doesn’t take a lot of convincing – Tony knows he’s probably going to inherit the family fortune at some point, but that’s going to take a lot of time and patience, so for the time being he has
“Yeah, pretty much. You understand now?”
“What are you…” he yawns out as he turns in the opposite direction, his eyes finally finding Grant, sitting on a chair with what looks like a notebook in his hands. The other shoots him a quick glance, smiling a bit shyly – why, Tony doesn’t know, nor he can guess – and gives a reply before the question is complete.
“That’s the spirit!”

. His last visit still haunts him – sarcastic and ironic as that might sound, all things considered – to the point that he has often thought, hadn’t that been impossible, his heart had actually broken all over again at seeing Steve in those conditions. ‘There’s never enough time’ they used to say to each other back in the day, constantly pulled in every direction, fighting aliens and domestic threats, but right now they both would take that over

Steve tries and tries to define, but in vain. Exhaustion eventually catches him and he falls into a deep sleep.
“Knock it off, kid. It’s me.”
“Perfect, can’t wait. Is it near? How soon can we get there?”
“Anyway, then I saw you on TV, at the Inauguration, and I don’t know, something kind of clicked in my brain, because all of a sudden I got this idea stuck into my mind, and I just couldn’t get it out of there, until eventually… well, I figured, in our line of work, you never know what’s gonna happen tomorrow, right?”
“Well, without knowing exactly what happened, or the extent of his injuries, I can’t tell for sure. But if I had to just go with my gut feeling? This guy is clearly a fighter. Wouldn’t make sense if he gave up now, just as help has come for him, would it?”
“Rhodey, slow down, please, you’re killing me. It’s not Pepper, and it’s nobody new, I’m far too busy to even… look at other people in my office, even if I

It’s not much to go on, but Steve does find the thought comforting somehow. He nods: “Keep me posted, please.”
Just like that, everything is crystal clear.
“Did you just pull

“Of course not!” Mr. Field replies, slightly frustrated, and Tony sees him walking towards Steve; if this wasn’t real life the scene would seem taken straight out of an old western movie, both of men pointing their guns against each other. “Put the iron down, soldier. Your friend needs medical aid as soon as possible. You don’t

“Earth to Steve? What is going on?”
“I’m not with the Army…”
he is, and as he becomes aware of Steve’s arms still wrapped around his body, although looser than during the night, his first, irrational reaction is that he must be inside a dream, or having a vision of sorts, because surely this cannot be happening. Usually the observant kind of person, Tony has to admit to himself that focusing on details of not human nature – such as interior design or the house plan – was just as remote from his brain as it could ever be yesterday, so it’s no surprise that he doesn’t recognize the room around him. But then of course the memories of what has happened overwhelm his head, making it impossible for him to keep a smile out of his face, although it only lasts that bunch of seconds needed for the

His next step is calling off another kind of engagement, and this one turns out to be slightly more painful than the ‘we’re going to get married’ type he had with Pepper; but, although he feels really guilty thinking of it in these terms, he also can’t deny it is the truth. They both return to L.A. the following morning, but after telling Happy to drive Pep to the SI Headquarters, he gets back on the plane to fly to upstate New York.
“Of course. I’ll see you in a couple of hours, alright? Just want to give my armor a last check,” he explains, and before the other can say anything else, Tony gives him the quickest pat on the shoulder and goes.
, plus to finance a couple of superhero teams who have the very annoying tendency of breaking things, so I need to make ends meet.”
“Agreed, Cap. Fascinating as this might be, I don’t see anything resembling a ring…”
A veil of silence falls on them, Steve struggling to find something meaningful to say and Tony finding himself wishing he could even just sniff some whiskey. Luckily for them, the waiter comes back with their drinks, and after their glasses are full, Tony is again in control of his feelings.

voice yelling, and suddenly his throat goes as dry as desert. He
“Mrs. Young, could you please put me through my counterpart in Wakanda? I need to make sure that both of our countries agree on the same line at this meeting.”
For a long while neither of them speak, and as the silence goes on Tony grows more and more uncomfortable. Then, just as he was about to cave in and agree to his proposal, Fury talks again: “Alright Stark. I wish you good luck. Do get in touch when you get back, don’t let me have to come to you,
“Do you… think he’ll act differently now?” Steve eventually asks him, turning in his direction, but before Tony can answer he spots his glasses and blinks, adding: “You wear glasses now?”
Tony’s eyes reading into his mind as they often seem to.
“Why would I mind?” Tony yawns again, and it’s clear his brain is not fully awake yet because if it was, he would be already up and hurrying to get dressed and go, because he doesn’t get days off, and judging by the light outside there’s a good chance he’s already late. But he still doesn’t know it.
about them. Only now, that proves to be completely pointless. Almost as if it was a mechanism of self-defense, he pushes the phone away from him, sighing deeply and listlessly scratching the incipit of his beard, just to do something with his hands.
At first Tony doesn’t think he has heard it right. It can’t be. It’s Steve, come on.
“Well, okay then, shall we say… 7 sharp? I just need a shower but it won’t take long.”
touches as well. To make it more
She nods.
That is, admittedly, a good save, and when he looks at him, Tony can’t help but recognizing a certain urgency and (maybe) desperation into his friend’s eyes. Which is why, after throwing a quick glance at the clock on his desk, he decides that perhaps a distraction is just what he needs to help him figure out the tiny detail that has been escaping his calculations for the whole afternoon.
“What you are thinking but don’t dare saying out loud.”
he had been storing into his head for all these years.
But if nothing else, his outburst has the effect to shake Steve a bit, mostly latching onto his self-respect, because without any further solicitation he actually mirrors Tony’s move, his thumb tentatively caressing the other’s palm. It’s a sweet albeit awkward attempt which attenuates his outburst, so much so that he feels the need to say something: “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to lash out, patience is not my… strongest suit.”
“About what?” the other wonders without lifting his eyes from the flowers, completely at ease, and he can tell by his tone he doesn’t actually know what he’s referring to.
“Hey, Tony, you alright?”
Steve wants to shout something now, maybe to shake the other out of the trance he seems to have fallen into.
“I’d say so, yeah. As it turns out, I was doing a bunch of stuff
“I trust you.” he nods, and then kisses him for a second time and a third, because now that they have started again, it would be an insult to the dead to stop.
?!” Steve stops his sentence as he sees Tony making an attempt to stand up. “The doctor said you should rest and…”
“It’s good to see you again. How was space?”
, but for like, your… research purposes.”
“Come on, let’s get out of here…” Steve says instead, stretching a hand towards him; Tony blinks, his eyes on the other man now, and stays there for a bunch of moments, trying to see if the words he’s heard actually mean what he thinks they mean. But Steve doesn’t flinch, so eventually he stands up too, catching his hand, letting him lead the way this time.
, he ponders as he starts inspecting both front and back doors, the first step of a fairly long list to tick off before the bank actually opens at 9.
on the spot.” Tony jokes, mostly to hide the truth behind what he’s saying, which is that he had in fact actively enjoyed their fake date together.
“So I’ve heard. Must say, I was a little offended you didn’t come to see me. I figured, after Strange and Banner I’d be next in line on this side of the ocean at least.”
Tony absolutely hates having to sit a mission out, especially when it’s because of some poor ass excuse like he just couldn’t finish the repairs on his suit on time. So what if the cooling is not tested? Or if one of the propellers goes off unexpectedly? There are worst things that can happen, right? But unfortunately for him, that isn’t what the others thought as well, so after a very quick vote, they decided he would remain behind to give them directions and stuff. Which means, he’s bored out of his mind right now, because the team is on its way back after a fully successful operation, and he’s sitting in the control room watching as the jet (painfully) slowly makes its way back to the Tower, a blue dot crossing the map, currently situated over the Atlantic Ocean. He thinks of bringing a project up on one of the side screens, just to make time go by faster, but he knows he’d get distracted anyway, the team’s safety being on top of his concerns at any given time, but especially right now. So what he ends up doing is taking one of Cap’s baseballs to throw it up in the air absentmindedly, eyes promptly shifting on the central monitor between takes.
All of the ugliness and brutality outside can wait a couple of hours more.
He gives a brief nod, just to acknowledge the truth and take some time, but still it’s all a pointless effort to find a logic explanation to something that, frankly, doesn’t have one. So he lifts up a hand and places it on Steve’s cheek, barely managing to touch it, but it’s been so long that it’s enough to send shivers down his spine, and by the look on the other’s face, the feeling is reciprocated.
As FRIDAY had anticipated, Steve is in the living room, sitting on one of the couches with a dossier opened on the table, its papers spread out all over, a cup that reads “America’s #1 Superhero” (one of the many gifts Tony has got him over the years) on the coffee table next to him.
“I still don’t know what’s happening afterwards.”
Fury seems to think this over for a few seconds, but when he speaks again it’s only to deliver yet another empty promise: “Let’s wait until the end of the summer and see how it goes, alright? We’ll touch bases again in September/October and we’ll take it from there.”
Steve was asleep. The nightlight on the bedside table cast a faint glow over his sleeping face, blotchy and red and half-hidden beneath the bedding. He had one arm resting on top of the covers, enough for Tony to see that he was wearing one of Tony’s T-shirts, rather than his own pyjama top.
Those who know their Doctor Strange comicverse may have already worked out who our mystery evil sorceress is. Mordo certainly has, and he's not terribly pleased.
“It was keyhole surgery, not trepanning,” Tony said irritably. “And you should have said something the moment you guys decided on this bright idea of yours,
“Fixing up the armour. Want to see?” Tony allowed him to stay perched on Tony’s knee as he finished reassembling the boot, turning the finished result this way and that so he could see the repairs.
hate him. The minty drink was a million times more effective at getting rid of the foul taste than anything he’d found stateside. “What’s in this stuff?” He surrendered the basin and the peered at the remnants in the bottle. There appeared to be green things floating in there.
“Well, he was right on the money on that front, but no, I’d already figured it out.” M’Baku’s comments had been the final bit of evidence, but he’d had quite a bit of the information laid out for him already. The others, ridiculously visible in Burkina Faso, almost jumping up and down yelling
“- then you could be removed from the Avengers roster for seeking treatment,” Tony realised. His stomach sank. “Or even for having something on your medical record - oh, of all the -! Why didn’t he - for fuck’s sake! Why didn’t he just
Anyway, notes. Tjaila is Xhosa slang for "time to go (home)", although again I'm entirely reliant on Google and Wiki for this. Steve greatly enjoyed the finger-painting, and he is 100000% not enjoying having that followed up with Tony going away. Tony doesn't have the best feeling about this, either.
It did not escape Tony’s notice that Lang’s version of ‘everyone’ did not include him.
Well, that was clear enough.
Wilson ignored him. “I’m gonna say something now that I shoulda said earlier.” He leaned forward. “
“What do you want, Nat?” He was so fucking
Maximoff piped up at that. “Unless they’re wearing a glamour.”
“I gotta tell you, doc, I’ve never had to sit an exam on going to the bathroom before,” Tony tried, his voice a bit shaky despite the bravura.
After a moment, Steve reached up and took his hand. He looked back up at Tony questioningly.
Her smile did not flicker. “It is close enough, yes.”
No, he wasn’t going to be losing any sleep over this.
“Identify entries with all of the following keywords: ‘Tony’, ‘Bucky’, ‘Siberia’.” Four entries lit up. Tony stared at them for a long moment. The first was about a week after Siberia, near the start of the audio record. The other three came up a few days later. After a moment, he cleared his throat. “Remove keyword, ‘Siberia’.” Six more entries lit up, flashing
“Okay. Well, not to worry. My friend will come get us very soon, and we can take you back to where you’ve been staying.” He had a sudden thought and winced. Grit his teeth and ploughed on. “You can even see your pal Bucky again.”
he thought resentfully. He didn’t know the guy from Adam; no way was he folding him into the general spirit of
. “Steve?” He asked uncertainly. “Is that OK?”
“If this sorceress is such a significant threat, we must all go.” He inclined his head. “I would not place the child in danger, Dr Stark.”
Tony resisted the urge to rub his face. “OK. So, the change was an accident, that seems a reasonable assumption to make. So what the hell was the intention?”
!” He raised his free hand to scrub at his eyes angrily.
“You have armed yourself,” she said quietly. “You have the suit, you have the guards. And yet you arm yourself with some hot water. You are afraid of me.” Her lip trembled. “I did not think that I would ever be that person. But I am.” She looked away. Her eyes were glassy and wet. “All I wanted was to somehow make the pain of my loss go away. And instead… There are children whose nightmare tonight will be a red witch coming to kill them in their beds. The - the
he reasoned, bargaining with himself the way he’d used to as a child.
“It is unfortunate, Mr Stark,” the swordsman said, standing over Tony’s prone form. Tony stared up at him through the cracked and distorted viewscreen of the HUD. “Your loss will be a loss to the entire world. I wish you had not made this necessary. I regret it.” Weirdly, he sounded as though he meant it, frowning down at Tony as he raised the glowy shield again -
Copies of Wanda’s bracelet were around the swordsman’s wrists, crackling faintly with power at random intervals. Tony guessed that it was the swordsman’s work, testing for weaknesses.
Maybe. Tony hoped not. He hoped that whoever it was running the New York holy place - hell, whoever it was they were going out to meet in Hong Kong - was a little more considerate of the minor trappings of humanity.
hold this world hostage.” He looked away. “He would have made the same choice.”
Barton made a non-committal sound. “Maybe.” He shrugged, looking at Tony sidelong. “You know, when Lila was five, she went missing.” Tony looked at him sharply at that, and Barton waved it away. “I know; where could she possibly go, right? Tiny little town, homestead; what, she’d hide under a bushel of hay or something? But anyway, Laura went down to the post office down the road, the kids with her, and Coop was supposed to be watching her as she queued, and he’d wandered off to chat to another kid, and the next thing you know, Laura’s looking around, and Lila isn’t there.” He laughed softly. “She went absolutely nuts. I mean, Cooper’s still probably never gonna hear the end of it. She ran through that entire town like a banshee,
“I don’t want Sam helping me with physio,” Rhodey said on the exhale. He stretched his fingers as far as he could, every muscle on his back jumping. “He does everything else, and it’s too much. I don’t… I don’t want that.”
Barton shrugged. “Seems fine. We weren’t shot out of the sky by the Air Force, so we’re probably OK.”
And all of a sudden, the pieces fit together. (Goddammit, Tony wished they didn’t. Just
“Something is happening outside, I need to go check. I need you to stay out of sight, OK? Stay inside the room, hide out of sight if you can. Alright?” He shook Steve’s shoulders a little, forcing the child to make eye-contact. “Look at me. Promise?”
(Something prickled through his chest at that, sharp and painful.)
with you,” Barton said peevishly, not turning around from the pilot’s seat. “It’ll be another six hours at least. Go read a book or something.”
Tony had been woken from a thankfully dreamless sleep after six hours and informed in no uncertain terms that he had to man up and face the inevitable:
“Latched on?” Happy supplied helpfully. “They do that. By the way, he’s been texting every day. I’ve sent a summary to your tablet. He rescued a stray cat yesterday. And aced his Chemistry test.”
(Maybe it would have been better if she had been just as cold in turn. That, at least, he knew what to do with. Not a Natasha visibly hurt over his jibes. Not one who seemed to be trying to meet him halfway.)
Tony was wondering if this conversation was one he should have saved for when they were safely within US territorial waters and it was all a done deal. As it was, Steve was busy packing up his things and getting dressed, and Tony had thought, foolishly,
T’Challa’s eyes widened in shock, his mouth hanging open.
He hadn't needed the hospital, in the end. He'd taken a few heavy hits, sure, but Rogers had pulled enough of his punches that there wasn't anything broken. A couple of cracked ribs, sure, and the bruising wasn't going to fade anytime soon, but nothing requiring hospitalisation.
“That he has an army at his disposal,” Tony murmured back. “That the whole lot of them are as fanatical as he is.”
She met his gaze, unflinching. “Which way will the dominoes fall if Oakland come up trumps?”
If he could only be a better person, maybe...
(See the end of the chapter for
Maximoff looked discomforted at that. “I…”
(The screaming still filled his ears, childish and terrified and growing fainter with distance. Was he moving, or was the child? Either way, someone was trying to separate them.)
He looked down as the child gave one more large, hiccuping sob and abruptly quietened, all the fight draining out of him.
“Ah. Without wishing to speak on behalf of my sister, I am sure that can be arranged. It seems a sensible step, given we seem to have plateaued in our investigations.” T’Challa frowned. “I do have one question.”
Despite himself, Tony felt a pang of regret at his blurted words. Howard had used ‘what use is he’ whenever Tony had fallen short of his expectations somehow, or whenever his mom had forbidden him to be involved in something she didn’t approve of.
, not the other way around; he couldn’t dump this on him as well.
“Inside the suit,” he said. Fuck, it was cold. “It's heated, it'll warm you up.” It would also - helpfully - keep an eye on Steve’s vital stats. The suit was capable of acting as a life support system when required; if necessary, Tony could seal the kid inside until help arrived.
(Now, Tony wished he’d complained a little less vociferously about being made to walk everywhere. Jarvis had been old, yes. But now, it appeared, so was Tony.)
and this guy had just casually torn it open, like it was nothing, and -
Some joker - Tony was starting to suspect Barton’s hand in all this, and the bastard was lucky that he’d scarpered - had put the kid in an Iron Man T-shirt, tiny little baby khakis, and even tinier Converse sneakers. With more Iron Man on them.
“It is if it’s eating up the first quarter’s R&D budget. Without the derogation, the tax exemptions aren’t applicable and he’s worried about the shareholders. With that, the fallout from the Accords, and the dissolution of the Avengers Initiative...” She shrugged. “There’s paperwork you need to look at for the Avengers subsidiary, by the way. Some of the lawsuits look pretty solid and we’re likely going to have to settle.”
Steve didn’t seem to have anything to say to that, sniffling a little in his sleep and turning to tuck his damp face against Tony’s neck, oblivious to the drama he was causing.
that’s not true.”
The king's knowing eyes tracked the movement. He seemed troubled by it, hesitating a little. “Some have returned to look after their families, and others to pursue a different approach. At any rate, I cannot reach them at this moment. Oh - there are ways to contact them, of course, dead drops and suchlike, but they will take time. And I am not certain that the Captain has that time to spare.” T’Challa paused, seeming to weigh his words carefully. “Dr Stark,” he said finally, “I have tried alternate methods of contacting Captain Rogers. But he missed his check-in point. He is not answering his communicator. And Ms Maximoff - she cannot find him.”
“Well,” Lang said reasonably, “you’d probably still look fairly hot in a ballgown.”

Goddamnit, everyone in this fucking country hated his guts, and basically 99% of the population hadn’t even met him yet. Tony had never been so insulted in his life; wasn’t it good manners to at least
“- when they - what?” Tony blinked. The last he’d heard - the last every scrap of available information had assured him - the Avengers had been broken out of the Raft, and had been safely ensconced in Birnin Zana.  He'd tracked them himself. “But I sent -” he snapped his mouth shut.
“That’s not what you want to ask me, anyway.”
Minoru turned to look at him, displeased. “Intact?”
.” He looked around the room, at the gathered ragtag Avengers and Dora Milaje, at the frowning Jabari guards. “In fact, can we please have quiet from the peanut gallery until we finish?” He turned back to the screen. “Apologies, Princess. Please, continue. The terrible, no-good plan built from your beautiful data.”
Vision said, still keeping himself out of reach, as if he could protect the child by hovering a mere three feet away.
“That he did. But that’s why we’re in a mountain, so he can’t do that again.”
But, wait. He suddenly remembered how profoundly Lang had been rattled by the images of the killed children, all those long weeks ago in Birnin Zana; how Lang had almost looked green with the effort to keep his face still.
Tony took back every nice thought he’d ever had about Sam fucking Wilson. “Yeah, in a gross breach of privacy!”
“You wish to go back to Birnin Zana with him?” But T’Challa’s eyes said plainly that he knew that was not true.
Instead of answering, Rhodey eased himself back down again, letting his upper body weight stretch him out.
He grabbed for the pebble and scrolled through to the contacts. Rhodey had been loaded up as a contact, although his name still showed up as greyed out. Lack of connection or the contact hadn’t been set up correctly? It had worked when Rhodey had called
That probably wouldn’t have made for a comfortable conversation. Well, then, it was a good thing that Maximoff was volunteering.

Huh. “Send her a holding note, FRI, polite but - well, you know the drill. Jet lag, cranky child, will contact her when possible, et cetera.” Shuri wasn’t waiting around, evidently. But Tony wasn’t taking Steve anywhere other than the Stark Industries facility right now; after they’d all had a chance to adjust to EST and get some decent sleep,

Steve swallowed. “Yeah,” he whispered. “OK.”

“Steve - he saw. He thought -“
You look across at Rhodey, at his hand hovering over his phone, halted in its motion as if he has forgotten what he intended to do. (He needs to call whoever still exists at the State Department. It’s right there on his list, under ‘Other - Avengers Business’, the work that would have been done by Tony, if Tony was here. If Tony had lived.) His mouth is a little open, his eyes on the open windows.
He’d never precisely trusted her in a personal capacity, of course, but he’d previously been fairly sure she’d have his back in the field. (He’d been fairly sure of that with all of them, hadn’t he? And look how well

The king nodded sharply. “Yes, we must intervene. Even if there is no larger goal, these attacks are unconscionable. And Interpol would be ill-equipped to handle a magic user.”

All they had so far were some inconclusive readings and a whole lot of conjecture and hand-waving. Who the hell knew what had truly happened, and what level of awareness Steve had of his situation.
Standing shoulder to shoulder with Okoye, Maximoff drew herself up as tall as she could, and reached for the attacker with her powers.

Wilson said, and he did have a point. He did. Tony could wrap himself in his rage and hand the kid over to Barnes and go back to Birnin Zana to recover from his injuries. He could let the others all deal with it all.
? Who’d cast the deciding vote, with Tony, Steve and Rhodey all out of the loop?
It seemed to make no more of a difference this time around.
“Barton, how long?”
Certainly not when Tony was stuck halfway around the world and couldn’t poke at their tech with anything more substantial than a hologrammatic digit. Well, that was something to think on, certainly; with Mordo no longer intent on skewering Steve, there wasn’t a particular reason for them to be holed up in Jabariland. Tony could just pick up the kid, and - “Gimme a sec.”
“Máahn ōn,” Okoye said to a young, pretty woman that Tony took to be the proprietor. “Néih sīk-m̀h-sīk góng Yīngmán a?”
He had the faceplate down and the repulsors powered up before the cell door was even open.

He met T’Challa at his rooms, ushered in by one of the Dora.
At this age, Tony estimated that Steve’s kicked puppy look was lethal at twenty paces. “Except you,” he finally amended, and then glared at the face Barton was making in the corner. “You’re more childish than the actual child, you know that?”
He was watching Hill with narrowed eyes, seeming to think it over. “Yeah, OK. That’s… OK.” he relaxed slowly.
Put him in a suit, give him a lectern and an autocue, and he could be standing in front of world leaders explaining calmly, gently, why Umar was a grave threat, and why the world needed to work together. Why they should choose option A, and not option B. Why Mordo’s judgement on this should be relied upon.
Hey, apologies for the missed week, I was on holiday. Please enjoy this longer-than-usual chapter as recompense.
And yes, that was adult!Steve being ever so briefly accessed by the conjunction of proximity to the mind stone as well as the portal opening. Anyone placing any bets on how well that's received, given everything?

his mother had said, when a seven-year-old Tony had asked how he was supposed to deal with his (first) expulsion from school. So Maximoff hated him; so what. He’d dealt with worse. (He’d lived with worse.) He squared his shoulders and brought his gaze up to meet hers.  “Go on, then. Let me have it.”
It was mostly luck that had kept him from fatherhood. He winced at the thought of subjecting a helpless child to the mess that was his life. Oh, sure, any child of his would be loved and cosseted and would want for nothing. But they’d also be hounded relentlessly by the press, unable to live a life of their choosing, and would be forced to deal with a parent that had not-inconsiderable chance of being blown up, magicked into space or impaled by aliens. If Tony had had kids… well, he was fairly certain that being a father and being Iron Man was fundamentally incompatible. Barton had hidden his kids away and left the raising of them to his wife. That wasn’t an option for Tony now - not that it had been much of one when he’d been in a relationship with Pep, of course.
Rhodey smiled a little wanly. “He doesn’t hate you. He just doesn’t know you,” he said. “Once he figures out you’re just as big a mess as the rest of us, I’m sure he’ll love you.”
he reminded himself, and went to look for coffee.
Unfortunately. “Yeah. He’s just… he was taking a bit of a nap, so they’re waking him up now to see you. Hopefully not too long.” He patted the kid’s hand. “And then you can stay with him while we figure out how to turn you back, OK?”
Tony nudged the coffee pot in his direction. “Drink some coffee, you’re disgustingly whey-faced.” He turned to Romanoff. “Barton got mind-whammied again, FYI; if he decides to re-enact
in some way?
Shuri has offered you all sanctuary in Wakanda. She is Queen now, looking small and frightened and far too young to have lost all those around her. M’Baku and Okoye do what they can for their Queen, and there has been no talk of challenge, no rumble of rebellion.
Tony shook his head, focusing on her. His paranoia could wait, probably. “At least eighteen hours,” he said hoarsely. “We gave him a dose of albuterol and a quarter of a tablet of Tylenol for the fever. He’s been… he has, uh, pleurisy, I think. But the whistling is new. And he was in extreme cold for close to a day with inadequate thermal protection. I think we warmed him up before hypothermia or frostbite kicked in, but…”
“... right.” Tony rubbed the bridge of his nose.
He’d been holding out the vague hope that the kid had been too turned around by everything to have really processed what had happened, but if Steve had narrowed it down to abandonment or bereavement…
Barnes seemed unruffled by this possibility, or by Tony’s comments on his memory loss. “You are very fragile, even for a baseline human,” he observed. “The heart condition, the cerebral haemorrhage, the…” He waved a hand, as if indicating the entirety of Tony’s… everything. “And you don’t look after yourself properly anyway. I doubt anyone could pin it on me.”
Tony pressed his lips together. “Well, thanks for that pearl of wisdom, Yoda, you have been of no help whatsoever.”
“Look.” Barton folded his arms and leaned back in his chair. “You have to know that there’s no risk, right? M’Baku would never have agreed to anything that would put his people - or a child - in danger. The trail leads to an uninhabited peak a little way from here; there’s a million tunnels in there and we should be able to contain your swordsman when he turns up. You - and Steve - were never in any danger. We’d never do that.
I've tagged this as Sam/Rhodey background only, because this fic is through Tony's eyes so it wouldn't be the same level of focus/page time as the Steve / Tony main pairing. (Although I do love those two together, so I'm toying with later writing the companion piece to this where they get together.)
needed to happen.
he muttered, scrubbing a hand through his hair.
On the other side of the room, flanked by the two Dora Milaje guards and a grim-looking Barton, Barnes was staring at Steve as if the kid had just stuck a knife in his gut.
“Yeah, well.” He shifted uncomfortably. “Just ‘cause I’m a selfish bastard doesn’t mean everyone in his life should be. Take your own damn advice and just - I don’t know. You know what to do. That’s your job, right? Physician, heal thyself.” He waved his fingers in a vague gesture to illustrate.
. Someone he could sit down with; someone he could count on to give him good, solid advice; someone who…
“Oh? What do I want to ask you?”
Tony did not drink tea. “Uh… sounds great. Come on in.” He cast a nervous glance behind him at the closed door to the sleeping area. Steve had been asleep for since Tony had put him back down again and Tony had been debating about whether to ask for some food to be delivered, or to try to get him up and dressed and fed properly. The little kitchen area had been stocked with the basics - enough for him to sort out breakfast, coffee and snacks, at least - but he’d never been one for cooking and he figured that the other meals would involve the rest of their ragtag little group. (And hadn’t he been left with just the most delightful assortment? Not that those departed had borne him any special love, but at least they hadn’t tried to kill or brainwash him. Well, that he knew of, anyway.) He was abruptly nervous. He’d agreed - in principle - for Maximoff to try to turn the kid back, but that had been… well, it had been more under the understanding that he could just hand him over to Barnes and let him take responsibility for those choices. Now that the situation had changed, Tony wasn’t quite so sure about things. Not that Maximoff would hurt the kid, of course.
“I’m so glad, Rhodey. Seriously. I’m so fucking happy for you.”
Trying to figure out Wilson's reasoning on the Accords has been such a struggle, not least because I would have thought that - as he has a military background - he'd be in favour of oversight. The fact that he wasn't, combined with his direct experiences of how the US military treats mental health needs, made me think on this point. No, this isn't the reason why Wilson is pissed off at Tony, but it does explain why - at least in part - why his instinctive reaction to the Accords was "hell, no!" and why he tried to work out a way to compromise afterwards, once things turned south.
The image changed. Steve was on a train (a train? Why a train?) and Barnes was falling into the snow, a broken ragdoll with his neck snapped. Steve followed him into the snow but it was too late (it was always too late). Barnes’s lips were moving, blood spilling down his chin, his eyes milky-white with death.
Tony took a deep breath of mountain air, closing his eyes against the memory of Steve’s pale face, tight with terror. “I’m fine, Legolas. Let’s get on with it.”
“D’you know what time it is?” Wilson snapped, sitting up in bed. “You call Jim at this hour often?” He looked as sleep-deprived as Tony felt, and there were pillow-creases on his cheek.
Well, clearly Rogers had been a bad judge of character since infancy, Tony decided. Although given that the only other person he’d properly met so far had been Barton, maybe it was just that Tony was less shit by comparison; who knew. He settled on a sharp nod. “Yeah, Steve. I can look after you.” He hoped. Actually, he was rather counting on getting some help on that front, because he wasn’t entirely sure what he was supposed to do with a kid while he worked. The court official who’d accompanied the doctor had explained that he was now in charge of the kid, and that he wasn’t allowed to do anything major without the court’s consent. And he absolutely wasn’t allowed to remove the child from Wakanda without prior permission. (Well, that was a bridge they could burn if it they ever came to it.) That the child in question wasn’t Wakandan seemed to be neither here nor there; as far as the court official was concerned, Steve was staying put until the court said otherwise, or until they figured out how to unshrink him. (That last bit was Tony’s extrapolation, and he hoped to God that T’Challa would be able to make the wardship go away once Rogers was back, because otherwise… well, it didn’t bear thinking about.)
After a moment, Tony dropped him to the ground, disgusted. He kept the repulsor trained on Mordo’s face as Okoye stepped forward and grabbed the bracelets, hesitating. Was it even worth putting them on him? Master Minoru stood to one side, seemingly not inclined to intervene one way or the other. They had to check on the others, they had to make sure that no one was hurt. They had to - “FRIDAY, check in with Vision.”
“He’s said no for the moment, but he may not have a lot of choice. We haven’t made much headway in tracking down this Umar who’s supposedly the Big Bad, and I doubt Mordo is going to be sitting and cooling his heels if we don’t kick things off again.” He took a deep breath. With him and Barton gone, who did that leave to argue Steve’s corner? “I know it’s a lot to ask, especially as you’re just out of surgery. But I need someone I can trust to be in that room.”
That was the problem. He didn’t. They had too little information, and he’d been out of the loop so much that it was difficult to make informed inferences. And the others… Romanoff might well put all the pieces together, he couldn’t dispute that. (But would she tell him?)
Taking the hint, Tony sat down on the bench. “I’m sorry,” he blurted out before he could stop himself. Rhodey’s eyes snapped up to meet his. “I’m sorry if I made it so that you couldn’t tell me things important to you. It’s… I’m sorry.”
He couldn’t stop thinking about how small Steve was by comparison. Sure, he’d grab onto Barnes like a barnacle the moment the supersoldier was in sight, but was it the best plan? There was a reason Barnes was under; shouldn’t T’Challa have arranged for him to be made safe
“Please,” Barton said fervently from the corner.
“Eh.” Romanoff made a noncommittal gesture, one eyebrow arched. “I’d say he can be reasoned with.” The corners of her mouth crinkled as Steve ran back in, presenting himself for inspection. “Seems he’s not a fan of the world ending.”
Wilson’s lip twitched. “I am honestly amazed Jim hasn’t suffocated you in your sleep.”
He swallowed. “I need to know what we’re talking about here. No bullshit, no withheld information, no coy glances, OK? Everything.
Hill made space for Barnes to slide in next to her, Barton rounding out the square beside Tony and Steve. She paused for a moment, and then a small smile quirked her lips. “Francis. It’s been a while.”
“OK, we’re ready,” the stranger who had to be Barton - and wearing the same suit / wire combo, sans gloves - said. He had a Stark Industries pass clipped to his belt. “The car’s signalled us. Is there anything that isn’t safe to leave to your staff to transport?”
Wanda reached out a hand and laid it on Tony’s arm. “Tony.”
“To what?” Tony asked, bewildered, before realising and flushing. "Wilson," he started.
, I promise, I just want my
Wilson sighed. “I could have told her it was a bad idea. Barton, too. For a pair of super-spies, those two have the subtlety of a brick shithouse.”
The child didn’t seem to hear this, wriggling until he could peer at the half-reassembled boot. “What are you doing?”
Steve sniffled as best he could behind the mask, his eyes wide and scared. “I thought it was a dream. I thought I’d wake up and I’d be home. But I’m still here!” His thin fingers gripped Tony’s anxiously. “I want to go
It didn’t change anything. It
They weren’t even sure if this physical state was permanent, or whether it would start to degrade or destabilise. Would Steve grow normally if left to his own devices? Everything seemed to point to his situatedness in this time, from his responsiveness to the antibiotics to his ability to ingest food and expel waste, but that wasn’t a guarantee. Mordo had called him a fixed point; they still didn’t have a clear idea of what that meant, other than he could use Steve to somehow fight Umar. Did being a ‘fixed point’ imply the permanence that Tony would have attributed to the description, or was it just Mordo’s turn of phrase?
“No, we
The recording stopped, the screen still lit up softly in front of him.
“He zipped up his lips!”” Steve explained a little breathlessly in Tony’s ear, evidently having been born with the ‘honourable defence’ instinct. “He’s not speaking, he zipped them up!”
The swordsman’s eyes flickered to him, then back to T’Challa. “Ah, yes, the threat of violence. How original.” He was silent for a moment, calculating. “Very well. As a show of good faith… My name is Karl Mordo. And all I want with your time-altered friend is a link back to…” He hesitated. “To whoever altered him,” he finished.
Something was very loud in the room. After a long moment, Tony realised that it was his own breathing, harsh and wet. His hands were clenched in Steve’s T-shirt as he hugged the child to his chest. “Well, now, that’s a problem, Robocop. I don’t give a rat’s ass about what Rogers would want. His ‘wants’ are what got us into this mess in the first place, so no, I don’t care if you think he’d rather be filling out his spandex again. That’s not justification for putting a kid in danger! It’s the same attitude that got you all into this mess - get your mission accomplished and hang the collateral damage; well I’m not letting you sacrifice anyone else on the altar of getting your own way!” He ran out of breath, staring at Barnes furiously. God, he hated the man. Hated him beyond what his hands had done, what he’d been forced to do. Hated him because he was squarely in Rogers’s corner and that, right now…
And all Tony could think was,
After a moment, Steve reached out and touched the arm as well. A crooked grin appeared as he tentatively stroked the metal, trying to pry his fingers in between the plates.
Because he’d be damned if he’d sit around under T’Challa’s thumb (and Nat’s quiet, behind the scenes manipulations) and have Steve raised by committee. It was bad enough that he’d given way to them on so many occasions so far; any further surrenders on his part and he wouldn’t blame any of the others for assuming they just had to push to watch him buckle. He owed the kid more backbone than that when it came to his welfare.
, and he was
“But… things are complicated. We’re not quite sure how to undo the magic on you and send you back that way. And if we do -“ He hesitated again.
Then Steve might still come back all on his own, with all that was unresolved lying between them. (And the child, some small part of Tony thought and clenched as if physically wounded. The child would be gone.) What would Tony do, if that happened? If he walked in one morning and found Steve Rogers lying in the child’s bed? If the child was gone, and all that had been left behind was someone who had no further use for Tony; someone who had lived a life and who had made his choices, and who regretted nothing except living?
“No,” Tony said, opening up the small toolkit he had in one of the inner suit compartments. It was wholly inadequate to do a complete repair job, of course, but would be enough to get the suit operational again - he hoped.
Dhakiya chose that moment to enter the room, smiling to see the kid up and about. “May I interrupt?”
Barton looked even more uncomfortable, if that was even possible. “Someone had to watch you. Wanda had to be there for the surgery, and you were agitated, didn't recognise anyone else, so I had to be there, you know, to... Everyone else is still out in the field, tracking down Aragorn and trying to get ahead of the next attack. It's OK, the Dora and some of the Jabari guards were with him the entire time.”
“You could say that.” He shrugged. “It turns out my party days weren’t quite as long ago as I thought.” They’d gone for the ‘secret love child’ route - overlaid with about three different conflicting cover stories - which would keep anyone who went digging busy for quite some time. (It was always easier to use a scandal as a cover story, Tony had found; people tended to stop looking once they thought they’d found your deep, dark secret.)
The first entry with all three keywords was a mere two minutes long, time-stamped 03:22. He should probably leave that one until later, though; he should start at the first one tagged ‘Tony’ and work his way forward chronologically. He should…
could be against military and political oversight.
Tony wondered.
But Barnes was shaking his head. “He doesn’t know me,” he croaked. “He… I can’t do this. I’m sorry.” He pushed past Barton blindly, almost running out of the door. The two Dora Milaje smartly followed, leaving Barton and Tony alone with the child.
. Whenever he had drawn it, for whatever purpose, the drawing clearly mattered to him. He’d kept it in between the pages of his favourite book. And, for whatever reason, he hadn’t shown it to Tony.
‘word of the day’?”
“I don’t know.” He thought. “Maybe flea-dip for aircraft?”
Split.
“I will leave you to talk,” M’Baku advised, hoisting his children up in his arms. The littlest said something in a language Tony didn’t understand and immediately wrapped her arms about her daddy’s neck, smearing green paint on his cheek. He nodded cordially to Vision and walked out, his arms wrapped securely around his kids.
T’Challa smiled at that. “Yes. That is a good word for them.” He nodded at the tablet. “But you had a question?”
“He doesn’t need to smell you, he’s not a dog,” Tony said, irritated. He hefted Steve in his arms, jostling him a little. Steve had done as promised and stayed under the blanket the entire time they’d been in the storage room, not making a peep as Tony recorded the bodies and the smeared symbols on the floor. “Hey, kid, you awake?”
Tony hesitated. It had seemed simple enough to explain this when he’d been thinking it over, but somehow the words had deserted him in the face of Steve’s earnest confusion. “Steve, listen. I know we’ve been moving around a lot, and I know it’s been confusing. But I need us to take one more trip, OK, buddy? I’m going to move us back to the US.”
“Thanks,” Tony said faintly, feeling his stomach roil. “Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that. So, uh, send me whatever it is I can work on remotely, and I’ll see about taking a few meetings here; someone built my least-favourite person a new toy, so I really wanna meet whoever was able to whip one up -”
Tony.
“It’s not,” Tony cut her off. He didn’t know what she had been about to say, and he didn’t want to have this conversation again, or to second-guess himself. He’d agreed - in principle - to let Wanda near Steve. In theory.
Tony rang off, feeling about a thousand times better, and went to check on Steve.
would have gone away entirely at this point so Rhodey's injuries are probably still exacerbated by that.
think to do a DBS check?
“Oh, yes. Of that, you can be sure.” Mordo looked back down at his wrists, at the faint glow of Wanda’s magic on the bracelets keeping him in check.
“So, what is it you needed to tell me about Maximoff?” Tony interrupted. He set the shake to one side gingerly. (It wasn’t even the green bits that he objected to. It was just… his stomach felt a trifle queasy and he didn’t really want to chance it just yet.)
,” Steve said mulishly, hugging his knees to his chest. “I did. It was
“That is true, isn’t it? You don’t think of him as a shrunk version of Captain America. There are two people, and you think that we have endangered one for the benefit of the other.” She sounded confused, and a little sad. “But… you know that is not true. We are all working towards the same goal, here. We need to stop these attacks, and we all want Steve back.”
“Ow, quit it!” Rhodey pinched at his fingers, hurriedly grabbing the wheels and positioning himself out of reach. “You - you really have to stop doing that,” he said. His voice sounded oddly strained.
“I’ll bet.” He looked down at the HUD innards. “Out of interest, what’s the plan once you drop a cargo net on Inigo Montoya and drag him to our dastardly lair?”
Fine. How’s your dick doing, honeybear?”
Shivering as the cold hit him dead-on, Tony made his way outside - not too far, and keeping the entrance in his line of sight - to take care of the call of nature.
Minoru shrugged. “He will not give you a choice.” She waved a hand, and a portal formed by the side of the desk: the airport, where the cloaked quinjet had landed discreetly, hidden by the noise and flurry of the other traffic. The jet itself could not be seen, still under cloak, but there was a figure sat on some nearby crates, waiting patiently. He was fiddling with what looked to be handcuffs but were in fact the bracelets, interlocked.
been under some impressive drugs, after all, so he was gonna cut himself a little bit of slack for being slower on the uptake than normal.)  But even so there was a big difference between knowing what was happening and being able to do something about it.
Groaning, Tony covered his face with his hands.
Shouldn’t they be facing the back of the building behind this one?
Barton looked away, the corner of his mouth twitching. “In my defence,” he started, “you were genuinely concussed for a while. Not to mention that whole bit where you were, oh yes, bleeding in your brain and having
“Steve had it,” Romanoff said, confirming all of Tony’s suspicions. His breath huffed out of him. “He’d started looking at it around the fourth attack, when Interpol connected the dots and the Russian authorities started worrying they had a serial killer running around, gutting entire kindergarten classes. He might have thought -”
He glanced at Barnes, side-eyed. Well. Maybe
“Steve?”
they gave him a new arm?
Mordo looked up at him. He sounded genuinely regretful. “You do not trust me. I understand; I have caused you harm. You are concerned for the child. But I promise you, Dr Stark, I do not intend to hurt him. And our goals are the same. We all wish to stop her.”
“Begin playback, half volume.”
Tony’s breath caught somewhere south of his windpipe. “Oh?” He managed.
They must be intending to keep him there for a while, if they’d hooked him up with an uretic catheter as well.
And as for this latest debacle… he could see that his indifference was hurting her. It was obvious, in the way she had reached for his hand, and he had permitted. In the way she had squeezed, and he had… permitted it.
Wilson blamed him, Tony blamed Wilson; and Rhodey was stuck in the middle with both of them fucking useless.
Steve seemed to think long and hard about this before shaking his head.
“Well,” Tony said after a moment, surveying the jam-covered child, jam-covered table, and jam-covered rug. “I guess we can squeeze in a bath before we set off.”
Barnes lay crumpled in the walkway, clearly having jumped out of his seat but managed no farther. His metal arm, black metal gleaming, was outstretched, his flesh arm folded awkwardly beneath his twisted body. He, too, was breathing.
(There’s no spaceship, no miracle. There is no one riding to the rescue.)

“So, I look away for one moment and you fall on your head, is that how it is?”
He’d been in danger, and they’d come together to do their thing. (Okay, it was him and Steve, but he wasn’t going to be picky here.) A small, cold place inside him abruptly warmed at the thought. Surely it had to count for something?

Both Avengers froze when they heard Bucky and Steve mention Clint's name.
Rogers' words made him feel a bit better.
“I’m still sorry that it took a whole week to track you down,” Peggy said. Yeah, a week after he’d crashed the plane, they’d found him frozen in the ice. Peggy had been devastated, but he’d healed up pretty quickly. And after that… Things had been wonderful.

"You can do that," Steve said, rolling his eyes and smiling when Stark laid out across both Captain Americas' laps. While Stark got comfortable, he finished up the drawing that he was working on. He wasn't surprised to find that his alternate had the same love for art that he did, so they decided to just sketch out their own teams, for the other universe. If he saw anyone in his own universe that was on this team, he'd definitely see about befriending them and making them Avengers.
better with it than he is. If I wasn't sent off ta war, I would've become a mechanic so I could work on all those high-end, expensive-looking cars."
"We're landing in two minutes," Clint called from the pilot’s chair of the plane. Natasha, Bruce and Sam were all towards the front of the plane, too, letting Steve and Tony have what little privacy they were able to have.
“I was so worried that I was going to lose you,” Steve whispered. He’d spent two days fearing what might’ve happened to his teammate, and then to find him captured by the townspeople and nearly killed? What if he’d come to town a little earlier, and had just

Tony replied back in Russian. The moment he spoke, he got a lot of strange looks from his teammates. “What? Tasha taught me Russian.”

,” Tony replied. It was easy to see his self-hatred, and it hurt Steve a little. He hated that Tony could never see how wonderful of a person he was, and now that he had to deal with the fact that he was cursed, too. “If you hadn’t been hurt, I might’ve attacked you too! But you were just a hurt human, a-and then I had a chance to recognize you, and then the team was there so it was easier to recognize all of them…”
“I know you will,” Steve said, taking a step back. “Keep yourself safe, alright? No matter what happens, just know I
"You little punk," Bucky growled, but he was still smirking.
"I have to say, whatever you did was pretty amazing, because I haven't been able to figure out dimension travel just yet," the man admitted, rubbing the back of his head. Tony stared at the man, who looked far too much like himself for his own liking.
"Remember to leave one of them conscious," Sam called, swooping down to take out a couple more Hydra agents.
"Out of everything that you

Firing up his gauntlets, Tony walked over to one of the exits, ready to get the door open. Sure, they hadn't landed yet, but when had Iron Man ever waited for them to actually land a plane before he headed off into danger?

With Peter down the aisle, that left only one person…
"So, you're some kind of genius, hmm?" Bucky asked, curling and uncurling his fingers, a smirk on his face. "Maybe I should've come to you earlier 'bout this—Hydra's not good at making things. It's been broken for quite a while now... How's Steve been doing?"
“But they don’t act that way,” Steve said quickly. “I was instantly suspicious, and so when I asked the impostor if he remembered the fact that he and Bruce had been dating for the past four months, and if he remembered that the anniversary was tonight… he said that it must’ve slipped his mind, and asked me for dinner suggestions… and I told him that he just needed to make sure he didn’t take Bruce somewhere where they served seafood because of how allergic Bruce was. He agreed not to right away and thanked me for being such a good friend—I dragged him off to an interrogation room directly after that. He should’ve known that everything I said was a lie.”
"How did I... know that you're Iron Man?" Steve asked, tilting his head to the side. Why were they wasting time if Tony was injured? Unless he wasn't injured. Checking again, Steve realized that Tony was just really
Tony chuckled, taking the super-soldier’s hand and pressing a kiss to it.
, then there's a chance that you might kill yourself trying to fix it," Tony said, not missing the way Bucky smirked.
“I’m not
"Tony?" Steve whispered. There was no way that Tony was Iron Man. He'd said that Iron Man was his bodyguard. He was supposed to stay out of trouble. Steve thought that he was safe, every time the Avengers went out into battle. He thought that Tony would always be fine when he got back every day.
"Let's go get Steve back," Tony said confidently. Maybe... maybe he could tell his team. They obviously cared about him. Maybe they'd be okay with him being Iron Man. "Let's go bring my boyfriend home."
The worst part of the virtual world, though, was the fact that the man had built a monitor to make sure that the world was just as happy and wonderful as it was supposed to be.
The dread turned to fiery hot anger. “I’ll kill you! There’s no way… there’s no way that I could’ve lost everyone… I can’t believe it, I won’t believe it… I’ll find you—you’ll pay for what you’ve done.”
The green soul was next.
"Is there anything else you need, or can I go be bored in the living room instead?" Tony asked. He wasn't allowed in his lab, he wasn't allowed to work with his suit
"What he did?" Steve prompted, feeling ice in his veins. No, there was no way... Howard had always been someone who spoke bluntly and he could see the man saying some cruel things, but there was no way... The look on Tony's face was enough for Steve to know that Howard had become a different man in his later years.
He nodded before blasting off into the sky again, not surprised that one startled person decided to shoot at him. Flying back over to where he'd left Clint, he hovered in front of the air as Jarvis disabled the shield.
"Right over there," Clint said, pointing to one of the larger trees that had a whole bunch of branches. It would provide good cover and a place for him to be able to balance a lot easier. "Why'd you mute the comms?"
"I have to worry about you not eating and not sleeping," Tony muttered, giving Bruce an exasperated look. "That's
Tony had talked with Bucky and suggested that they let Steve have both of them, and they work on their own relationship—whether it was just a good friendship or it led to dating, it hadn't been all too important in the beginning. So they suggested the idea to Steve, promised that everything would be okay, and then the three of them went off to Malibu for a while to try to build their relationship. (And anyway, S.H.I.E.L.D. had missions on the west coast for them, so it all worked out.)
“I love you too,” Bucky whispered, and this time Tony knew that he was serious.
"I'm so tired
But it wasn't only Tony he was looking out for. It was Steve, too. He'd thought in the beginning that Tony wasn't the best guy to be around—he did do a bunch of research on the guy, after all. Again, he was a
of his teammates was actually in the kitchen at the moment. Oh well, he’d just track the rest of them down.
"I love you too," Tony whispered, that gentle, loving look turning devious as he looked Steve up and down. "Well, are you comin' over here or what?"
"You little punk," Bucky muttered, flipping Tony off when he landed beside the two super-soldiers.
Steve nodded. He heard Tony’s voice—he heard
Tony rolled his eyes, but Steve could see the tears in his eyes.
Barnes looked over at him.
"Anytime," Stark laughed, while Captain America raced over to grab his sketchbook, tearing off the page.
, though, he came running over.
Tony gripped Steve’s arm tightly when the ship took off, flinching horribly when the ship started moving. He couldn’t help it. Last time he was on a spaceship it was because he was being kidnapped. He couldn’t help the shiver that shook his body so badly.
If he stayed the night, he could look for Tony all day and have some time to send the news to the team—everyone was out searching in other places. Natasha, Clint and Bucky had all been searching in the area around where Tony had run off, and Bruce was back at the tower trying desperately to find a way to help Tony.
"I don't really know if my world's Steve and Clint were affected or not... I was the closest to the portal, so..." Tony shrugged. He flinched again, grabbing his forehead. God, why'd he drink so much? He was a little surprised that this world's Steve—calling them by their last names might be easier—offered him a hand.
"Shower?" Steve suggested, and Tony smirked.
While it wasn’t something that either of them had talked about, Tony was glad that
Tony had barely made it to his seat before Steve wandered into the kitchen, yawning and stretching.
Steve knew that Tony hated having all of the attention in the room on him when it wasn't a happy, easy conversation.
He really shouldn't have been surprised that he caught everyone's attention. All five of his teammates were sitting at the table or standing beside it, and yet Steve was the only one who was able to act like everything was normal. Bruce, to be honest, looked like he was trying, and it was hard to read Natasha, so she could've been surprised but failed to show it.
'I love you.'
“This is my life,” she insisted, though she had the face of a stranger now.
"I know," Tony groaned. "I'm pretty sure you yell at me after every mission."
He made sure to keep the Hydra agents away from Iron Man's back while he shot down another couple Hydra agents. There were a bit too many for just the three of them to be fighting comfortably, but if they got to the controls... Clint and Natasha needed to be able to fly the plane, not deal with Hydra agents.
“It’s not about…” Tony huffed angrily, trying to find the words. He felt too hot in the suit, and deep breaths really weren’t helping. “It’s not about the
. It was really starting to bug him.
"We're going to need to get the bullets out of him so that it doesn't cause an infection," Bruce said, looking like he was trying to remain calm even though there was a chance that Bucky could lose himself to the Winter Soldier at any moment. "I know drugs don't work well on Steve—"
he was able to go home. He couldn’t be more thankful than he was right now.
There was a slight accusatory tone in his voice, like Steve wasn't thrilled that he hadn't stuck around. Tony could understand that—he left his husband at S.H.I.E.L.D. and went back to the tower alone. He
He raised an eyebrow at her. "Not quite—he advised against it without supervision. And I'm

Tony smirked behind the mask. "Hold on tight, Cap."

instead of by my side..." Rogers shivered a little. "I trust him, and so does the rest of the team. With our lives."
The doctor glanced down before he quickly disposed of the needle. “You’re back, and you’re not… seizing… anymore. No—I do need to make sure you’re okay, but… I think we all need you to stay awake for a little while right now.”
“Stevie… I don’t know how you’re going to wake yourself up, but you need to do it sometime soon,” Bucky whispered, taking his friend’s hand. “Tony needs you now more than ever. You’ve got such an incredible life here, and you don’t even know that the one you think you’re living is fake.”
"We can... do that," Tony agreed, and Steve grinned as he put an arm around his boyfriend's waist.
"When Steve's stressed he kills all of the punching bags in the gym... unless he's already killed them. Then he just practices alone," Tony pointed out. "That's not 'in bed' either."
"But you know what would be good for you right now, more than anything?" Stark asked, and Tony smiled a little at Rogers' disapproving look. "I wasn't going to say a threesome, I swear. I think we should figure out how to get you home. That way you can talk with your team, hug you own Steve, and see that your team

that you're going to believe it."
with the team,” Steve growled, nearly punching the button to go to the gym. “Buck said he’d be waiting in the gym since he didn’t want to come out on a run this morning, so I was going to meet up with him there. I’m sure at least some of the team’s going to be there, especially since I’ve been trying to make team training mandatory.”
"Ah, Steve, you're still hurt," Tony gasped, pulling away from him, eyeing the wound. "They hit you hard. You need medical attention."
This was a completely different situation. Steve wasn’t just
like yourselves again," Clint commented, patting Tony's shoulder. "That's something, at least. Welcome back to the real world."
the purple soul spoke. Hope, there was hope in that promise that drove Steve to agree.
“But you didn’t,” Steve pointed out.
Humming happily upon hearing those words from his lover, Steve tightened his grip a little before letting the sound of Tony's arc reactor lull him off to sleep.

Now, he just sat and stared and waited and
"Maybe tomorrow you could just tell us that you're going to be staying out late?" Clint suggested.
Clint groaned.
“I can’t do this without you. And I’m not
"You're cheating," Tony muttered, eyes half-closed. "This is just part of your plot to get me back into bed, isn't it?"
"Please," Steve murmured, tightly embracing the shorter man. Tony just smiled, relaxing against his lover. He loved being able to touch Steve—he'd had some issues in the past with people touching him, or handing things to him, but with
"Let's go home," Steve murmured, glad to have his team around him. Perhaps one day he'd be able to talk with Tony about him being Iron Man, and about the trust that he'd never lose.

like to hear about it, if you’ll tell me…”
The angry people seemed to understand just how serious he was, and most of them were gone by the time S.H.I.E.L.D. showed up to lock up Hydra.
“I know. I just didn’t want to let that be the only option,” Steve murmured, leaning into the touch as Tony gently stroked a hand across his cheek.
“No J, I’ve gotta tell them too. I can’t just tell half the team,” Tony grumbled, getting in the next elevator. “I mean, they’ve probably heard by now, but I’d rather be the one who tells them even if Barton or Banner has already said something about it. Might as well show off the ring, since
He nodded, not letting go of Steve’s hand, though. “I refused to tell them about my family… I refused to say anything that would help them hurt you guys.”
“You’re a strong woman, Peggy. Everything will be fine,” Steve promised. It was one of the reasons he loved her so much—she was strong and independent, but she still loved him and let him care for her whenever… whenever he spent too much time in the lab, or forgot to take care of himself, or when he decided to go all-out with things that didn’t need that much care and attention but he overthought every detail and… Who was he talking about? Not Peggy. “But I’m not going to leave. I’ll find a job in the city, and I’ll stick around here. We’ll raise our children, and everything will be okay. Don’t you trust me?”

"I know you do," Steve said quietly, giving his hand a gentle squeeze.
bringing him home. Tony froze, though, when Bucky pulled out a gun, aimed and fired it all within an instant. Tony knew that his eyes probably made him look like a deer caught in the headlights. Well, until he realized that the gun was pointed at something behind them.
They were both alive—alive and well—directly in front of him.
Something inside told him that it had been longer than a week, but… he believed her. He believed her as much as he loved her.
that this is going to be different for them—it's going to be different for us, too! But we're trying to keep things normal, why can't they?"
"Aww, you two really did miss me," Bucky chuckled, keeping his forehead pressed to Tony's. They'd taken him to the bathroom and made sure that all of the blood was cleaned off of him. "I can't believe you thought I wouldn't want you there, Tony. I-I thought maybe they
"I'll build you a new arm," Tony promised, kissing the injured shoulder. Bucky just smiled and leaned over to kiss him, though he was unable to put an arm around Tony because he was still missing one. With his right arm he was gripping Steve's hand like if he let go, he'd find out everything really was just a dream. While Tony wanted to be able to hold Bucky's hand, he could see how tight Bucky's grip on Steve's hand was and knew that if it was his hand, it would already be broken.
"You're in one of our medical rooms," Steve said. Tony watched him, confused, because while this man looked like Steve... "We weren't expecting you to just fall out of the sky like that."
"I know," Steve mumbled, sighing. "They don't know him, they don't know any of us. But it still hurts, you know?"
"Sorry," Bruce murmured, concentrating. "But this is going to hurt. We didn't think you were ever going to come back to the tower. What changed your mind?"
sometimes, and Steve looked like he could still win a marathon.
He slowly nodded before leaving the room. She was hiding something, yes, but she was right: their children did need him. But that didn’t change the whispered promises of love and the lingering taste of blueberries.
"No," Tony cried out in his sleep, and Steve quickly hugged the other man close when his lover gripped his shirt and tried to pull him closer.
"You usually tell us before you stay out late," Natasha pointed out as Tony tried to drag Steve back up to their bedroom.
Natasha didn’t say a word, but she did hug him tightly. While the Avengers had started off pretty rocky, they’d really grown close and become the family that Tony had never expected to have.
"You're okay," Tony murmured, and Steve held him close. God, he'd missed this man.
Tony had designed the earpieces in a way that they'd constantly be transmitting sound, and if someone mentioned a specific name—or codename—those ones would be louder, or the volume would be increased if the earpiece was tapped. But regardless, the earpieces were almost
What was weirder than the numbers was that he could swear that he was hearing things.
. He needed to know that his family was safe.
“I need to make sure… that you’re aware of something, okay?” Bucky walked over. His left hand was twitching, and to settle that down, he gripped the end of the bed tightly.
“I know,” Steve murmured, gently squeezing his hand. “I know, Tony. I was a little out of it a while ago, but I remember. You… you’re able to

"...Is Tony here?" Steve asked, raising an eyebrow. "And should you really be drinking all that in the lab? You might hurt yourself."
"I missed you too, punk," Bucky said, sighing. "I just... keepin' a lid on the Winter Soldier is tough. I think I've got it now... but I need you to lock me up if I lose it. I don't want to hurt anyone anymore, Steve, I

Too much smoke to be good, plus whatever they drugged you with... Are you in pain? I can get Bruce back in here, he's been making sure you were going to be okay—"
Tony if he got stabbed—anywhere, probably.
, remember?”
"Good," Steve said. "I can do that. You're right—you're one person, no matter if you are or aren't wearing the armor."
His husband was still so beautiful. When Tony looked at him, his heart still skipped a beat, his face still flushed, and he still wanted nothing more than to be by Steve's side. That's all he'd ever wanted—the chance to make the other man as happy as Steve made him. It was wonderful. But after seeing himself in the mirror... he really wouldn't blame Steve for waiting until they were back to normal to be by his side.
He hadn't meant to say it, not really. He really had wanted to give the man a chance to be able to come to him and talk about it first, when he felt comfortable enough to. But that didn't stop Steve's panic-induced mind from trying to tear the suit open.
to see Steve right now, but he knew that there was no way for him to hide what he was feeling from his lover. No, Steve was always able to read him like a book.
old—wait until you've at
The best thing about watching Steve day in and day out was the fact that he was right there to see those beautiful blue eyes of Steve’s open again.
A sudden and powerful pain flashed through Steve, starting with his hand and coursing up through his arm, igniting a fire in his bloodstream that was only fueled more with every breath, every passing second. He didn’t bother arguing out loud, not with something as eternal as the infinity stones, so instead Steve just snapped his fingers as fast as possible.
scared him more than anything. No more Steve, no more Avengers, no more
Steve's eyes snapped up to the faceplate. "Iron Man, please, what happened? Are you hurt?"
"Nope, you need to stay here and get some sleep," Steve said, grinning when Tony turned around to face him. The shorter man pressed up against him, and Steve pressed a kiss to his lips. "I haven't had a chance to snuggle with you in days, and I miss it."
, Steve. You gave that up to come stay with me, remember? We both gave it up to have our family,” Peggy said, glaring at him. “But sometimes I get the feeling that it isn’t enough for you, Steven Rogers.”
"I know you did—you did an

to believe me that I’m only here to get you out,” the man said. It was getting harder and harder to insist that it was an impostor. He was able to copy Steve too well. Had they replaced Steve, too? Had they been stalking Steve like they’d been stalking him?
"Yeah," Bucky said, looking real smug as he flew over and landed on Clint's shoulder. "True love's kiss, that's how every fairytale ends. Bruce and Natasha went home yesterday."
Steve wasn’t completely sure where her powers came from, but she’d threatened the team and she’d ‘cursed’ Tony. No one had actually believed her until…
. The man was great.
"I'm not surprised that they weren't exactly thrilled with the attention," Tony chuckled. When had they just walked through the park together, hand in hand, and just enjoyed the day? Every time they tried they were always swarmed by the paparazzi. "I mean, we weren't reacting well to them giving us too much attention and treating us like we're fragile—"
... But Steve had always treated him kindly. Steve never used his for his money, Steve never hurt him, Steve never did any of that.
go easy on throwing me down? My ribs hurt.”
"I mean... the team hasn't been together for more than a few months—"
"I've had some trouble breathing," Tony muttered, knowing that if Bruce found out that he had kept anything to himself after he'd sworn that he'd said
“I’ll see if I can look through the code, make sure the system’s still functioning like it should be,” Tony assured him, patting Clint’s shoulder. “Don’t worry about it, Clint, it wasn’t your fault. Things happen, and I’ll just… keep anything bad from happening, okay? It’ll all be fine.”
, he couldn’t think. He just… he needed to find his team, his family. He needed to find Tony.
"I know. Believe me, I
At first, Bucky hadn’t understood what was going on. All that he knew was that Steve was lying unconscious in a bed and there wasn’t
Bruce, on the other hand, had gotten the short straw, because he had been an ogre. That's why Tony had been prepared to attack him, because he'd already
He took a deep breath, reaching up to take his helmet off. He paused for a second, taking another deep breath. Steve glanced around, noticing the easygoing smile on Clint's face and the calm look on Natasha's face.
"I haven't seen Steve yet this morning," Bucky commented. The sharp smell of coffee was enough to make Tony start waking up some.
"What?" Steve gasped, eyes wide. Tony knew that saying anything was a terrible idea, and now Tony knew for sure that he'd never be able to face Steve again. "Wait, but Tony's straight."
," Clint insisted, crossing his arms and huffing in anger.
“Be prepared,” Bucky shouted. “We’ve got company!”
. Don't they know who the Avengers are?"
"Glad to see some things stay the same," Iron Man chuckled, heading over towards the elevator. The Avengers must've been on their way. "So, it seems like you know me, and you know alternate-you... who else do you know?"
Tony then adjusted his wristband to 2012 and smiled at him once more, taking Steve’s wrist and adjusting his to 2013 for him.

it was different. He never had to worry about his lover hurting him, not like that past lovers had. Steve would never hit him or try to choke him or—
Tony rolled his eyes. "What, never seen a guy wear his lover's clothes before? I mean, his male lover's clothes? Might be a bit difficult to wear women's clothing... 'specially if you're larger than she is..."
Tony gripped his hand tightly, and Steve smiled, leaning over to press a kiss to his forehead.
“It’s a good thing that I don’t mind having our family around,” Tony mumbled, closing his eyes as he let himself relax in Steve’s arms.
“Okay, something serious that I’ve only ever talked to you about… looks like everyone’s gonna know now,” Clint mumbled. “So remember the first time that the two of us went out drinking together and we ended up down in your workshop? We were both pretty drunk by that point in time, and you were showing me some designs you made for new arrows. I was
His heart ached, and for a moment Steve wasn’t sure if he’d be able to breathe. He hadn’t lost the entire team, but two people who meant the world to him were now dead, and… and it hurt more than he’d ever be able to explain. It was more than losing a piece of himself.
Clint chuckled, making sure his weapons were all loaded. "Yeah, but so can everyone. You can't be happy all the time."
"I'm not sure I'm ready to tell the public," Tony whispered, and Steve leaned forward to kiss him.
. “We settled down, we had a family, and now we’re just husband and wife. Not agents, not soldiers, just
"Tony," Steve said firmly, and the genius froze in place. "Let's go get bagels, okay? You've been working too hard, and I haven't noticed enough... I need to be spending more time here, with you, outside of the lab. We can't keep searching twenty-four seven, and you need to destress. I've been working you crazy. And I'm sorry." Steve reached a hand out, and Tony couldn't help but take it. "Now, I'm pretty sure it's been a while since you've got a blueberry bagel, and I haven't had one of those cinnamon bagels in a
So Tony stayed in the lab. He kept searching for Bucky, he kept sending Steve out to new places, with Wilson or Clint or Natasha. Bruce kept trying to pull him out of the lab, but he only really managed to whenever Steve wasn't home.
Stark pointed over to part of the room. "Your team is coming for you."
to think about. While he'd trusted Iron Man before—the man had become a close friend, despite the lack of time he spent around the team, seeing that he claimed to have another life that was separate from his being Iron Man—it was nice to finally know who it was that he was trusting with his life.

The werewolf snarled at him. He was sniffing the air, as if trying to figure out whether he wanted to kill him or not. It took another step towards him. Steve tried to stand up, but whatever the bullet had hit was
As he watched the door where eventually Steve would show up, Tony watched his closest friends walk down the aisle, two by two, grinning brightly. First were Rhodey and Pepper, who both gave him a hug while Pepper also kissed him on the cheek. They stood over on ‘Tony’s side,’ giving him some comfort.

"I thought you were in danger," Clint gasped, hugging him a little
Bruce just grinned at him, still looking half-asleep and quite, well,
“What are you talking about? Tony, we’re here to get you out. Just hold on,” not-Steve said frantically, taking his well-crafted shield off the strap on his back. Not-Steve used the shield to break the lock off of the door—at least they were changing it up. Last time not-Steve had managed to ‘get the key away from the guard’ and just unlock the door before not-Bruce and not-Clint helped him out of the cell.
where you'd be best right now, and you know it." Steve offered his friend a smile. "It's also pretty comforting knowing that you're watching our backs when we can't."
"If he's anything like me, then he's madly in love with you and wouldn't even begin to think about being with anyone else," Rogers said. He sounded so honest when he said it that Tony couldn't help but believe him. He relaxed a little when he felt Stark start rubbing his back.
be here, whenever you need me. I don’t want you to even question the fact that I care about you.”
Panic started rising, and Tony wished that he'd revealed himself to the world so that he could've brought a suit with him so that he could fight his way out. But he couldn't do that, he knew he couldn't do that...

Tony ran his fingers across the man’s upturned palm, tracing the lines of his skin. “I really do miss hearing the sound of your voice, you know. It’s one of your best assets…”
As he ran through the data, he wasn’t seeing anything that was wrong. When Natasha brought his bagel in, he migrated over to his chair and kept going through the data as he ate.
Steve stood there, staring out into the darkness of Vormir for another minute after he was once again alone. Well, alone as he could be with a ghost of an enemy behind him.
"I don't know how many times it's going to take me saying I love you for you to realize that it's true," Steve whispered, pressing kisses to Tony's head. Thankfully, his wound had been healing up a lot during the flight back, and hadn't ever really been
The man must’ve noticed how sick Steve looked, because he asked, “Did you know someone who was cursed?”
No, Steve loved him. He
“You won’t ever need to again, I swear,” the blond said, gently gathering Tony up in his arms. “When I get you home, I’m locking you away in our room and I’m never letting you out.”
He spent most the time he spent with Tony flirting back and forth with the other man, trying to figure out if Stark was teasing him or actually being serious. He flirted with most people, but he seemed to flirt…
"No, nothing like that—it's a good thing, really," Tony said quickly, pressing a quick kiss to his husband's cheek. "It's good, I promise. I just... I wanted you to know how grateful I am that you stepped in when you did at that battle."
"He'll be fine," Tony reported, keeping his repulsors powered up just in case any Hydra agents had snuck past the team. He didn't think so, but he wasn't about to take any chances. It wasn't until they'd gotten him back to the ship when Bruce got a chance to look at Bucky. Once he was sure that Bucky would be fine—"You're going to get a thorough examination once we get back, but you seem fine for the ride home"—the brunet found himself sandwiched between Tony and Steve.
Clint looked really guilty. “I kinda assumed, based on the holiday…”
"You... make dimensional portals while you're drunk?" the mystery guy who was still there asked. "Tony, why don't you do that? Is alternate-you just that much smarter?"
"Actually," Stark said, shaking his head. He offered a small grin. "I'm not surprised about the situation you're in. I'd probably be in the same place if I didn't feel that I could tell the world that I'm Iron Man. I needed my team, they really did help. Plus, Steve and I do a

hurt, Bruce,” Tony said, grinning. He didn’t fight with Steve, though, when the super-soldier led him over to the bed.
What kind of human being would he be to destroy the goodness in Captain America? There were already a lot of angry journalists that had found out about it, seeing by the number of alerts that had been appearing on his phone. Poor Steve would have to deal with some bed press too, but at least people would think that he was forcing the man to do this.

“And what about…?” He wanted to ask about Bruce, or Clint or Natasha or Sam or… He wanted to ask about Tony. He
Tony.
"You seem so sure that this is going to be resolved quickly," Tony said. He didn't have that same kind of optimism. He had to look at this honestly—hope for the best, expect the worst. The worst was maybe a couple of years with the team before he died, and that was looking at the worst in a positive light. The best could be a few days and then back to normal, but he doubted it. He'd put his faith in Bruce, yes, but realistically it would be more than a few days.

Tony stared at the man who was sitting across the table from him. Steve Rogers, with a dark suit and gray dress pants, looking more like a nervous teenager than a strong leader of a superhero team. His hair was perfectly combed, shoulders squared, back straight. In a way, he almost looked like he'd been forced into the seat, even though
The sword could

"Where are Clint and Bucky?" Bruce asked as Steve pulled Tony to his feet.
"I hope not... he
thinking it, but he’d actually said it? Tony looked crestfallen, probably jumping to his own conclusions, so Steve just held him in place and smiled at him. “I did mean it—I was sorta hoping that I’d tell you when you could actually answer back, but… I do love you, Tony.”
The team looked surprised to see Steve
“We’ll deal with that—you’re recognizing us, and maybe… maybe the other cursed people will be able to start to remember, too,” Steve said, though there was a pain inside at the thought of it. How many people had died because of those peoples’ ignorance?
"S'cause I built it," Stark muttered, glaring at Tony, then at the way he was still holding hands with Rogers.
“No, he can’t be. The simulation’s working perfectly,” Tony said, pulling up the data on his tablet. “See? There aren’t any issues at all, I made
Next down the aisle were Bucky and Clint, arm in arm, and Tony knew that eventually there would be another wedding, though he was unsure which set of friends would get engaged first. It was great to be able to send his teammates in pairs down the aisle with their dates. Clint hugged him tightly while Bucky patted his back, then the two stood off to the side, leaving a place for Steve to stand.
“Those beasts have to be
“Tony,” he whispered, not able to believe that his husband was right there. The man had said that he was gone, that the team had died and he’d missed out on
The instant he was in the sky, Hydra started firing on him. They hadn't been expecting him to show up right there, and they weren't exactly prepared for him, to say the least. Tony swooped down closer, blasting a couple of repulsor blasts at their big guns to knock them out and make sure that they couldn't hurt either of the super-soldiers.
pick me up,” Tony said, trying to scoot as far away from the shapeshifter as he could. Those things touched him enough already, when they beat him and cut him and… And he didn’t need one pretending to be Steve, carrying him out to ‘safety.’
“Get up, we’re getting out of here,” he demanded, voice angry as he glared at the townspeople. Everyone looked like they wanted to kill him, too, but they were too scared to get close enough to Tony.
or something.
“It’s okay,” Tony whispered. It was his voice that Steve had been hearing, when he thought that he was going crazy in the simulation. Tony was always here. Tony was always waiting for him. “Everything’s going to be okay now. You’re awake, you’re
"Luck of the draw, I guess," Tony mumbled.
where the town could’ve killed Tony. This was bad—and he couldn’t even contact his team! He was going to use the pub phone after he lost his along the way…
Wind rushed by him as he spun in circles down towards the ground. Everything was a blur of blue, green, blue, green as the sky and the land created a whirlwind of colors around him.
"...Tony?" The second voice was familiar too, and Tony couldn't help but grin.
"Tony—"

Steve let go of Tony’s hand and looked like he was going to punch Bucky, who was approaching up until then. “Why the
once more, just in case something went wrong?
"See? That's progress," Steve said, and Tony noticed a small smile cross the ex-assassin's face. "The good news right now is that Bruce gave you an all-clear—the serum you've got is slowly coming back, and the bullets are gone, and you're all stitched up. The only thing that's left is that arm of yours."
Before Steve could go into the pub, though, he noticed that the ritual must’ve been starting because so many people were gathering in the center of town. He glanced into the pub and saw that it was empty—no doubt everyone there were all over at the ritual, so he’d have to talk with them after. Hopefully they still had a room available.

that he’d said any of that to the Skrulls. In fact, he was pretty sure that the Skrulls didn’t even know that he and Steve were dating. They’d never tried to use it against him, so he just figured they didn’t know. It wasn’t like it was public knowledge just yet. Tony wasn’t planning on announcing it until they’d been dating for, like, two years or something.
“The luckiest man on earth right now,” Bucky interrupted again. “And he asked me to send you a message. He’s been dying in the other room, not allowed to see you yet, and he just wanted you to know that he can’t wait to get to the aisle because he’ll see you at the end of it, waiting for him. Sappy punk probably said it better than that, but…”

, not a super
"The team's been worried about you," he added as they headed towards the kitchen. "They were worried that you were hurt, so they're going to be a little... overprotective, for a while."
Bruce had explained it all to him. The machine that had been attached to his head was keeping him trapped in what the doctor had called a ‘virtual simulation.’ It wasn’t real, it was just something that was keeping him trapped and unconscious. The man who’d done it was trying to get rid of him, but in a humane way—he wasn’t going to
"Glad to know he still thinks of me as his brother, even after all this time," Bucky said, and he could actually hear the quiet joy in his voice. "You do know that he's not going to leave you, 'specially not for me, right? 'Cause when Stevie loves someone... it's with all his heart. And it only took one look at him for me to tell just how much he cares about you."
, and I think that's old enough to be considered old," Steve said, crossing his arms with a slight smirk. "Glad to know my team knows not to mess with me."
"I knew you were real, there's no way Hydra could've made you up," Bucky whispered, pulling back away from him long enough to press his lips to Tony's. While he was still in a bit of shock—Bucky really

"Really?" Stark said, surprised. The glare disappeared, to which Tony was thankful. "We've been together... off and on. Falcon's a bit new. Maybe you'll find your own Sam? Ours was working for Fury first. You got a Fury in your world?"
"No, it's a warning," he muttered, flying over to check on his teammates. Everything had gone quiet, and he noticed that Steve was trying to check on Bucky, who just looked pissed off.
the beasts. They stabbed them to death.
"I want you back here, Bucky, I really do, but I need you to understand that I'm not about to let you stay here if my team is in danger," Steve said, helping the injured man over to the medical room. The brunet nodded, wincing in pain as he laid down on the cot.
“Who’s that? Steve, Stark’s name is
“I’m not willing to sacrifice everything,” Tony argued, which was exactly what Steve’s argument was going to Vormir.
Tony Stark was not a morning person. Everyone knew that. So when he strutted his way down into the kitchen that morning, it should’ve been a sign of something important, something special.
Spinning on his heel, Steve stormed off towards the edge of the mountain, the place where he knew Natasha had jumped from, where she had sacrificed her own life so that countless others could live. He couldn’t help but glance over the edge into the depths of the darkness, seeing nothing more than a stain of blood where his friend must have been.
"I don't," Steve said.
It was only moments later when the rest of the team scurried over to congratulate Tony, and Steve too, but the angry super-soldier was still really upset and he’d pushed Bucky away when his best friend tried getting close to him.
"You can't be serious, right?" His husband looked appalled, and he gave Tony's hand a gentle squeeze before he said, "Tony, no matter

“Me neither,” Tony admitted sadly. He thought that the team was really like a
Sighing, Tony laid down on the cold, hard floor again. Tomorrow marked two weeks. If he was being honest, it would probably take a week or two to track him down in the first place. But they had to know that he was a fake first.
Steve just chuckled. "It's already healing. It would've been a lot worse if you hadn't caught me when you did—it wouldn't have been a very pretty landing, I can tell you that."
Getting some food into his system did a good job at alleviating the hangover. While he was sitting in the kitchen chatting with this team of Avengers, he'd learned about the vast differences between this world and his own.
"котенок, I thought Bruce told you that you shouldn't be working in the lab for a little while," Natasha said as she approached.
Steve never got violent.
"And the team... believes that?" Rogers asked. "Your Steve
“I never would’ve left you there,” Steve whispered, gently stroking the injured man’s face. “I just wish that it wouldn’t have taken so long to break that Skrull into telling us where you were…” He pressed a kiss to the top of Tony’s head. “But we did, and now you’re coming home.”
But then there was another gunshot—this time it hit a tree, thank God—and Steve realized that Tony was trying to get him out of the town.
"I guess I shouldn't be surprised, he

He’d put Steve in a world where he hadn’t been frozen for seventy years, where he’d instead married Peggy and had a family with her and…
Turning his attention back to his husband, Tony placed both hands on Steve's shoulders before he leaned up, stealing a long, passionate kiss from his lover.
“It’s okay,” Steve whispered, gripping him tightly. Steve’s comforting arms wrapped around him and grounded him, letting him know that this was
anyone—what if he forgot about their relationship? What if he had to get Bucky to fall in love with him all over again? He wasn't even sure if Bucky
Steve just rolled his eyes fondly. "I should've been able to tell that you were Iron Man earlier, but I didn't even look hard enough because I was too in love with you. I'm pretty sure there have been many times when I've asked Iron Man about his boss, and about whether or not he seemed happy with dates, and whether or not he seemed interested in me—"
? Was it really? He always lost track of the date, especially after spending a ton of time in the lab, and he’d definitely spent most of the past week in and out of the lab, then an entire day just with Steve and then… April? Already?
Tony stood up, never once letting go of Steve’s hand as he leaned in to kiss his husband. “It’ll be okay. You don’t have to worry about that. I’ll take care of this family for you until you come home. I promise.”
the one making the mistake,” Bucky spoke up as he, too, joined the room. With so many people, it was starting to get a bit crowded. “Bruce, Tasha wanted to talk with you.”
“Knowing that this was all one big misunderstanding is nice,” Steve said, leading Tony out of the elevator and over towards their room. Tony followed, not really caring to get breakfast right then if it meant that he could instead go snuggle in bed with Steve. “But that doesn’t mean that they’re off the hook, just because of what day it is. I
Searching his eyes for any hint of a lie, Tony caved in. Steve was telling the truth. "Okay."
Bruce would kill him if he knew that Tony was struggling to breathe and had locked himself in the lab, alone. It was a good thing that he'd instructed Jarvis not to say a
"At least the Avengers still exist here," Steve pointed out, and the Captain nodded.
The moment that Steve let go and let Tony get a couple of feet away, he watched as his teammate’s skin started getting covered in fur. There were loud snaps as his bones rearranged themselves, and within a few seconds Steve wasn’t staring at his friend anymore.
Tony didn’t know what to say to that. He didn’t make the rings,

to lose part of his newfound happiness.
"I see," Bruce said, considering what Tony said for a moment before he added, "I'm going to trust you on the fact that it's nothing too bad. I'd tell you to avoid strenuous physical activity for a while, but I'm sure you already know that. Working in the lab—I know you're going to hate me for this—should only happen under supervision or not at all. A lot of what you work on is either very heavy or potentially dangerous, and you're not in the best... condition, to deal with that right now."
"You were helping people," Steve pointed out. "You couldn't have guessed that they'd know you were there—and they chose an
“I know that this isn’t what you want to hear about right now,” Natasha said, her fingers gracing his shoulders, “but the adoption agency was calling again. They didn’t want to say anything to us because they’re only allowed to discuss things with you and… They wanted you to call them back sometime. I can understand if you don’t want to talk with them—I’ll tell them not to call back if you want me to.”
He didn't even realize how many hours had passed until he heard a familiar voice calling his name.
The blond was somehow able to get the bottle out of his hands and put it down on a table as he walked past, leaving Clint standing there trying to figure out exactly what had happened. Instead of pondering on that too long, he just turned and wandered back over towards the main room. The lights flickered as Tony apparently got the power plugged in.
, seeing how much anger was seething off of Steve. It was nearly
He wasn’t expecting his lover to come running over to greet him, no. They’d never really been very touchy-feely with one another, but he was okay with that. It was just part of who they were. No, there were others that he was expecting to come running over to greet him.
“I’ve thought about this a lot. We never… No one’s ever going to be able to unhook this machine. If the power goes out, it’s got an automatic, reactor-driven power source to keep it going. I know you’re alive, I know you’re well, and I know that… I know that you’re happy.” This time there were tears in his eyes. “I know that you’re happy, and that’s… that’s enough for me, you know? That’s all I’ve ever wanted—for you to be happy. And I know… I know that you’re happy right now. I can feel it—you’re relaxed, you’re not in pain, you’ve always got the hint of a smile on those beautiful lips of yours. And you’re… you’re with your first love. You’ve got the family that you’ve always dreamed about, and while I know that it isn’t real… it’s real for
Steve was ready to crash after a long day of searching. His muscles were sore, he felt like he hadn't slept in a week, and somehow Bucky had managed to get away again. Of course, he didn't disappear until after they'd taken down the groups of Hydra agents that had been attacking them. He had a little bit of time to actually talk with Bucky—the man
As Tony dragged himself over to the door, he glanced back to where he'd left the suit. The thing had been a pain to get off, but at least Jarvis was able to remove most of it. In a way, he wanted to just put it back on and pretend that nothing had happened, pretend that he still looked and felt just the same way as he always had.
They could keep him safe until Steve
"Dinner's in a half an hour," Natasha said, like that was the only reason she'd come down—not to scold them or anything. Steve seemed to get the real reason why she had come down, but he just kept a smile on his face—definitely not a genuine one. "Bucky's cooking. We expect you to be there."
He made sure to keep an arm around Tony's waist. Eventually his boyfriend would be able to tell him about being Iron Man, and he wanted Tony to know that he still trusted him. He threw his other arm around Clint's shoulders.
"We were just out to
Were they right? Were they right in thinking that this was all some kind of big joke? Did they think that
“I’m not going to let them laugh, Tony. That’s not fair to you, because you’re one of the greatest things that has
"We love you too," Steve murmured, hugging them tightly.
"I'm never going to think any less of you for being Iron Man, or for not wanting to tell anyone about it," Steve whispered, kissing Tony's cheek. "I know that it must've been hard, keeping that secret for so long, and... I really did mean to let you come to me, first, but you weren't moving, and I started panicking... I hope you realize how much I do love you, Tony, and respect you... I hope you realize that it'll be okay to tell the rest of the team, too."
, so weak. “I don’t want to hurt you. Just… it might be better this way.”
He gripped Tony’s fur again. “Please don’t leave again… I can’t lose you, Tony… I
Even now, with a new member on the team, they worked flawlessly together, able to give and accept a little help when needed as they took on Hydra.
, it’s not about S.H.I.E.L.D. or which villain of the week is going to show up… it’s…” He sighed, struggling to choke out the words. “What if Steve’s making a mistake?”
"And he doesn't want to be here. I... I can't force him to come back to the tower if he doesn't want to be here," Steve said calmly. He leaned down and kissed his boyfriend. "But that's okay, Tony. I'm not going to give up on being his friend, but I... I haven't been here for you. Last night you were alone in the lab, and I know why. If I was here, you would've been with me, not alone. And I'm
Soon enough Bruce and Natasha were down the aisle, and Tony was glad that they’d settled on the colors red and blue. Everyone on his side was dressed in black suits with red ties or vibrant red dresses, while everyone on Steve’s side was the same except with a rich blue. Both Natasha and Pepper looked
hair just turned gray. Not fair," Tony muttered, but he couldn't deny that the gray looked nice. It made him look far more experienced—Steve had been through a lot more than the team ever really thought about, because he typically just looked like he was about twenty-five. But he was older than
"I'm going to have to talk with them again," Steve muttered, with a clear
Most of the team either didn't know about it, or they just kept out of it. Clint wasn't pretty sure it was the first, or else Steve would be down here dragging their sorry asses off to bed. He'd always been a bit of a Mother Hen to the team, and Clint could see just how much Steve cared about Tony. He was happy for his teammate and friend when the two of them ended up in a relationship together. He'd been the one who'd talked with Steve about the fact that it was okay to be gay in this day and age, to which Steve was very thankful to learn.
Tony smiled at him, and he was glad to see that it
“With S.H.I.E.L.D.’s resources it only took a week to find where the spaceship was,” maybe-impostor-Bruce spoke up. “The hard part was getting the alien to talk. We had to get S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel to interrogate because… it was hard to force him to talk when he had your face, Tony. It’s longer than anyone would’ve wanted, but we’re here now—we’re bringing you home.”
"Calm down," Tony chuckled. He'd always found it hilarious when Steve Mother Hen-ed the team after missions. "I'm fine. It was just a little smoke and a chloroform mixture, nothing to worry you. It
There was only one problem. That
"You can have him," Stark said, smirking as he took his Steve's hand. "I've already got my Steve, thanks. And while more Steves might be
"He doesn't have to control you anymore... It's going to take some time, because this isn't going to be an easy battle, but I'll be by your side the whole time, if you ever need my support," Steve murmured, stretching as he got out of bed. He reached out his hand, offering a kind smile to his lover. "I'll always be here for you."
"You did. You found me," Bucky said, snuggling closer to Tony. "You found me, I'm here now, and I can't wait to be home."
Steve smiled fondly at his boyfriend, rolling his eyes. He shouldn't have been surprised to find that Tony wanted to fix Bucky's arm because he
Bucky’s smile was weak, but he knew that he’d gotten through to the other man.
to think that they can laugh at the fact that I’m marrying my better half,” Steve said, pulling Tony into a tight hug. “If you won’t yell at them and tell them off for doing that, then I will. You mean
When Steve got to their bedroom, he wasn't surprised to find that Tony was already in bed. Now, he was easily able to tell that his boyfriend wasn't asleep just due to the pattern of his breathing as he wandered over, and the fact that Tony snored lightly as he slept.
"I know you can," Steve murmured, smiling. "I trust you." It took all he had not to say 'I
“It wasn’t your fault,” Tony whispered, putting his hands on either side of Steve’s face. He pulled Steve’s attention back over to him. The super-soldier was surprised. “I’d never blame you for being stuck in that simulation, Steve,
"Just... a few cups," Bruce said dismissively. "That's not important—I've run the simulation

highly skilled, and he easily managed to get the sword out of the man’s hand and hold it up, ready to protect his teammate. “Don’t touch him.”
really well-made.”
“Stop,” Steve shouted, shoving past as many people as he could to get to the middle of the crowd.
God, that meant that each and every battle, there was a chance that he could lose Tony.
to, but Steve needed to kiss his true love, so...
," Tony groaned, leaning against the other man. Steve was still the same warm, solid presence that he'd always been. "That's not a lie. That's just me being old. I just... I also... I mean, maybe if we turn the lights off... I just don't want to have to see myself."
"I know you love me," Tony said, because it was the truth. He knew that Steve loved him. He wouldn't have married him and pledged
“I forgave you a long time ago, Stevie,” Tony half-laughed, half-cried as he pressed his face against Steve’s chest. “God, you’ve always gotta be the hero, don’t you? You’ve gotta be my hero, and now you’re gonna be Morgan’s hero too… for bring her Dad back.”
drunk anymore.
Steve had tried getting into the lab about four hours back, and every hour he tried again. Tony felt bad about shutting him out, but Steve hadn't actually seen him just yet. He wasn't ready for his husband to see how he looked now.
Icy tears of his own ran down his cheeks as Steve was pulled into a somewhat sitting position. His left arm ached as it was moved, but it only took a few more seconds to realize that the glove had been removed from his hand.
There wasn’t a damn thing he could do, and it drove him crazy.
"I'm used to it," Tony pointed out, and Steve laughed. Steve was basically the definition of overprotective, especially when it came to the team.
"Never should've doubted you," Tony agreed as Bruce shouted something about turning the machine on in
When that golden blast had hit them, it didn't send them through time. Tony almost wished that it had. Instead, it had some rather...
you didn't feel like you were able to tell us."
“There’s this little boy,” Tony said cautiously, not wanting to sound desperate. “He’s four years old. Originally they weren’t even going to consider us until a little later, some other people have applied earlier, but… Due to some trauma in his life, he’s developed some mutant abilities far earlier than he ever should have, and I know he’s had some trouble controlling them. They don’t think placing him in a foster family would be a smart decision.”
Tony sighed, but there was no point in arguing. When he thought back, he was pretty sure Steve had mentioned going out, but he was a bit engrossed with the battle. "Fine, fine. But if
Right then, Tony wished that Steve hadn’t gone on his morning run with Sam. If Steve was here, perhaps they wouldn’t be laughing?
