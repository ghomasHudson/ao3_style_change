But Master Phillips is not done. “And Hodge?” he says, stopping in front of the other Jedi Initiate. “I expected better from you. Rogers may be a mouthy pain in the ass, but I expect you to approach the situation calmly and accurately evaluate his threat level as minimal. After all, a Jedi would not use a lightsaber against a porg, son.”
“Forgive my impertinence, Antony, but are we not shopping for cloth to be fashioned into a new toga?” Stefanus looks past him at the array of fabrics in a variety of hues. “That wool over there is quite nice,” he says, indicating a brilliant red with gold trim that would suit Antony’s olive complexion.
Steve is not going down so easily, and now that the number of his opponents is down to one, he estimates he has at least an even chance of survival.
Cap is lucky Tony showed up at all. By Tony’s reckoning, he had earned his minor mental breakdown, and he could inflict it on Cap if he felt like it, but involving Cap in his freak-out meant he’d have to involve the man in other ways as well, possibly for the rest of his life, and Tony isn’t quite sure he is ready to face that particular outcome just yet.
However, one of the few times Antony could reliably be counted on to behave was Parentalia when he and Hadrianus tolerated each other’s presence long enough to pay their respects to his dearly departed mother.
Steve is not fine. Tony knows it, and Tony is pretty sure Bucky knows it. He can see it in the slight tremor of Steve’s hands, in the way his eyes are level with everyone’s shoes, in the low haunch of his shoulders.
It starts like this: Tony is sitting on his parents’ bed, his legs swinging with the toes halfway to the hardwood floor, while he watches his mother apply lipstick in front of the vanity. His eyes meet hers in the reflection, and she smiles at him much too soon. Her lips are red, and the color feathers out to stain her flawless skin.
Rogers grits his teeth, his back straight and shoulders squared. “I won’t beat a man while he’s defenseless, but you will learn your place on this team.”
“On it,” she confirms, before turning to their hired hands and directing them in Arabic to break out the pick-axes and get to work.
“Okay, here’s what I never understood about the Jedi. You live your whole lives from the age of three on up always training and studying to be these super-charged knights only to never get laid,” Stark is prattling on. “How does that make any sense? You could be sex symbols across the galaxy instead of the eunuchs you are.”
If it had just been Tony at risk of being disowned, he would have called Howard’s bluff in a heartbeat, but he can’t do it to Steve, jeopardize his home and welfare just to prove a point.
“Meet the Mark LIII. It’s essentially a drone with a VR holographic interface that I control from the safety of… anywhere but the actual battle. Once I get the bugs out, it will have near instantaneous bidirectional feedback, allowing me to still provide real-time combat and air support while minimizing personal risk.”
Steve’s reply is squirrelly, though Tony is too annoyed to notice. “What do you mean? Of course I like girls. Who doesn’t?”
“Yeah. The child prodigy in my materials class.” The guy tries to scrub out a particularly difficult stain, and Tony wonders if he’s imagining Tony’s neck under his rough fingers. “Fifteen. MIT student. Deeply philosophical musing on theoretical tech. It wasn’t that hard to put two and two together, though I’m surprised you came out tonight. Aren’t you usually holed up in your dorm or the labs?”
Tony looks… not well. He is not as composed as he usually is. Though he wears an expensive suit, it isn’t pressed, his tie is done crooked, and the dress shirt underneath is floppy, missing the crisp edge of an ironed and starched collar. His hair is longer than Steve remembers with his signature goatee not quite as neat and trimmed as he is accustomed to seeing. Based on the state of the man’s personal grooming, Steve supposes Tony must still be on the market for another butler, having already gone through a string of three in as many months according to Thor. Steve isn’t quite sure whether he fired them or if they had quit as he never seemed to learn any of their names, calling them all “Jarvis,” including the women. He wonders whether “Jarvis” was even the real name of their predecessor. Perhaps it had been a power move on Tony’s part, or it was simply a quirk – one of the eccentricities of the filthy rich – to force a name (however ridiculous) on their subordinates. Whatever his deal was, Steve hadn’t liked it. The least Tony could do is recall the name of the person mixing his morning martini every day.
“But hey… it’s not like he’s taken. I haven’t heard… Maybe it was just a fling. It doesn’t mean you’ve lost your shot,” Bucky tries (poorly) to cheer him up before mumbling, “And maybe now at least one of you will know what to do.”
Is this punishment for an imagined slight, for Stefanus’s refusal to give up Bacchus when he had the chance? And now, he must kill him after all. The betrayal, the deception, tastes of ash in his mouth.
Steve must be drunk because he only continues, “Don’t get me wrong. Dames can be quite nice, but nothing beats a partner who can really throw their weight around.”
“Why did you phrase it that way? That is not an encouraging answer in the slightest,” Rhodey complains. There’s another pause during which Tony can practically hear the man turning the answer over in his mind, deciphering its likely meaning. “How uh… how durable did you say he was?”
“How far along are you?” Cap finally asks, his voice strangled, his body tensed as if stuck between flight and fight.
,” Steve bellows. “I am nothing without Captain America. Don’t you understand? Gail and I were supposed to get married, have a gaggle of kids that would keep my parents company in their old age. And my brother? Dougie was only fifteen last I saw him; I never got to see him grow into a man before he was gone, too. I was supposed to come back and live a regular life with people I knew and loved, but I’m going to outlive them all!” He places his hands on his temples, sweeping them back to run his fingers through his hair. “I tried with Jan, but it didn’t work, because I’m too old. I couldn’t connect with her. I don’t understand anything in this damn future, and yet, I will be forced to watch this pass as well. Captain America was only supposed to be a temporary solution to a short-term problem with an end date, but now he’s all I got. He’s the only thing in my life that has and will endure. A life like mine… long and unending… it’s a curse.”
Tony frowns. “Okay, I’m going to let that slide because you’re upset and I’m magnanimous like that, but have you ever considered that you don’t have to be a Boy Scout to be an amazing Cap?”
Also, in the late 70s/early 80s, only 1 in 5 Americans had cable. Most families had like five channels. And VCRs came out in 1975 at a cost of $1,400, but it was around $640 in 1982 (when the average yearly income was around $14,500). Bucky thinks Tony is rubbing his family’s wealth in his face to point out to Steve how much better off he is now, and Tony doesn’t understand that the average family doesn’t have these things.
Tony follows him down the stairs and out the door, stopping at the porch steps when he sees Rhodey walking up. Steve pauses when they cross paths. “Thanks for coming; he’s uh… he’s going to need someone for a while,” he says, and then he’s off in the direction of the nearest subway station.
Tony supposes Steve has a point. Still, he wants to see the man squirm, even if just a little. So he suggests, “Well, what about us?”
Antony’s head snaps up. It is a secret, him and Tiberius, and if Hadrianus ever found out… “You cannot tell anyone. Swear it to me, Romulus. No one else can know.”
“Oh hey you, long time no see,” the bartender says as he pours a scotch neat for Tony and a beer for Steve.
…Which Antony then promptly spilled on a server in his revelry, staining the man’s tunic. “I must apologize. I will replace your tunic, my good man.” He pulls out his purse, squinting at the contents. “How much could one tunic cost? Thirty sestertii?”
Tony had done a lot of soul-searching on his own, and though he clearly loves Steve, he isn’t quite sure whether he is in love with him or whether that even mattered, because again: Steve could have moved on by now. The thought hurts him more than he expects, prevents him from calling and getting the answers he desperately needs (even if he’s not sure he wants to hear them).
So from then on, Tony sticks to women and alcohol. It’s easier that way, and with a clean nose, he won’t have to suffer the worried glances of Steve when he stumbles home at an obscenely late hour smelling of sex and scotch.
He’s watching the net, the mechanism of his defeat. Tangled underneath, he’ll be powerless to Aemilius’s final assault.
His surroundings are preternatural silent. There are no birds, no chittering of crickets, nor the footfalls of rabbits and other woodland creatures save the crunch of his very own.
Rogers lets out a low, strangled groan followed by a pant and a breathy “Jesus, Tony. That… That feels so good.” He pushes back incrementally on Tony’s fingers, shallowly thrusting against the desk.
Suibne doesn’t respond, but Aemilius does. “Lack of sleep will stunt your growth, boy, and Stefanus needs all the help he can get.”
“What? Safe sex, guys,” Clint protests. “Speaking of… Tony, you got any dental dams?” He takes Tony’s silence for refusal to engage in his gentle ribbing, and so he moves on to his next target.
A futurist and a man out of time walk into a restaurant, angling for a fight they don’t know they can’t win. The futurist is full of ideas, and his partner is full of ideals. They want to save the world, to make it a better place. And they do for a while. There is no war, no hunger, no pestilence. All the struggles plaguing the human condition solved within a single month. They achieve everything they’ve ever wanted…
. Things didn’t work out with Jan? So what? No one gets it right the first time out; some don’t get it right the first fifty times, but you get up, have an open mind, and try and try again until you find something that works. You… you have a clean bill of health – the perfect body, really – and all the time in the world to make the most of it, and you have the audacity to be unhappy about it,” Tony says, quietly furious. “I’m
“No!” Dracula cries out. He tries to cover Steve’s mouth with an iron grip that may have crushed the jaw of a lesser man.
“So… when you say you love me, you mean like the way I love honeybear, right?” Because there’s no way Steve is
Steve eyes Captain America, suspended within the billowy softness of a jumbo cotton ball. “Hey… What if his best friend is named Bucky, who he’s sad about leaving behind in the past?” he says as an aside, utterly breaking character.
is a fairy, they’ll probably send him packing on a blue ticket. “Don’t ask; don’t tell,” and now that everyone knows…
and his ex – who is a man, a gay man and a good friend – has a shiny new boyfriend, thank you very much.”
Steve is about to take the opening to connect with Dracula under the guise of common interests when the vampire makes a sound of disgust. “A game for children. Grown men should not have a vested interest in such matters.”
Steve bristles. “I have finished my training, and I was just about to undergo the final Jedi trials.” It’s not strictly the truth but close enough. Master Erskine had thought him prepared, even if Master Phillips had not.
“Sorry,” he says, because he feels an apology is owed. Steve had wanted to take things slow, and this is not most people’s definition of slow.
“He is a pattern. Priscus the Younger would boast of your proclivities, of the disgusting things you allowed him to do, and I chose to not only ignore the warning, but cover it up entirely, not because I thought him a liar but because you were young. The young are prone to thoughtless deeds, but you are a man now, and I do not think even the whore we hired for you that night taught you your…
when you grow a full beard. The five patchy pubic hairs you pasted to your chin don’t count. Until then, go to sleep, or I’ll pluck each one while you doze at midday on the morrow.”
But Steve is already looking past him into his expansive game room. “Are those Legos?” he asks, referring to Tony’s collection of kits he had built, torn down, and spliced together into his own make-believe hodgepodge metropolis.
“Oh, I have an alert that informs me every time my name is mentioned in the media. It’s probably that fluff piece I interviewed for a couple weeks back.” He clicks on the indicator to expand the news article, but instead of a review of his role on the Ultimates and what it meant for Stark stock prices, it’s a blown-up photo of Steve fucking into a dark-haired stranger from behind, cropped for decency but the situation obvious based on their matching expressions and nude torsos, his beefy arm swung around to delicately handle the man’s throat, with a headline splashed across the top declaring “Captain America’s Crippling Sex Addiction.” There’s a round inset stock photo of Tony looking upset with a smaller subheading, “PRE-NUP? Tony Stark Devastated Over Husband’s Infidelity, Considering $2.3B Divorce.”
Steve is doing much better, or as much as can be expected. He pretends well enough when the guys pay their respects and when Bucky tries to convince him to stay over at his parents’ place for a few days while he is on leave,
Tony relents, his hips slowing, the grip on Steve’s neck going slack then sliding up to stroke his hair in apology. He dips forward, being sure to curl his chest inward and away as he kisses the man’s upper back and reaches around to pump his erection until both are spent.
“Another botched sale, and I will sell you to the mines,” he mutters darkly, his sandal digging into Suibne’s back. He tugs harder on the leash, arching Suibne’s spine until he cries out. “You know what a man has to do to get sent to the mines, boy? That lot has nothing to lose. Pretty little thing like you won’t last among hardened criminals, but you will wish it was ever quicker.”
And he sounds so confident, so sure that everything will always work out as long as they stick together, that Tony almost believes it himself. “…Alright.”
Three nights later and they’re at it again when there is a crash signifying the demise of Steve’s brand-new bed. Stark is right; the man really didn’t know when to quit. So, Clint simply stops up his ears with ear plugs, folds a pillow over his head, and drops back to sleep.
Priscus looks down his nose at the boy still cradling his bandaged wound. “Mark my words, boy. Though I favor your rather delicate countenance, I will not hesitate to ruin it should you run.” He grabs Suibne’s hand, digging his fingers into the angry flesh of his brand as the boy cowers. “Do not mistake my benevolence, my mercy, for soft-hearted foolishness.”
Clint wakes to the sound of wood and metal creaking then snapping – the final death knell of a king-sized bed – followed by Stark’s muffled speech from the adjacent room belonging to the co-leader of the Avengers, Captain America. He can’t hear Steve’s response through the walls, but he does hear the movement of heavy furniture, a chase followed by laughter, and–
Steve turns just in time as a zombie, its gaping maw open to reveal teeth dull and yellowed but still sharp, clamps down on the thick leather armor of his upper arm while another grasps onto him. In surprise and terror, Steve pushes off the one that had tried to bite him, withdrawing his knife to plunge it up through its lower jaw back into its brain stem while he simultaneously tries to create space between himself and the second. At the same time, three more advance, attracted to the commotion, their hands up and trying to grab at Tony’s legs to pull him down.
Pepper comes to the door as they are about to land. She’s dressed in a sharp light-colored suit and blouse with a matching cloche hat, her heels tapping impatiently as she waits for Tony to crack open the door. He’s wearing little more than a robe with wrinkled lounge pants and slippers peeking out the bottom.
Fidelis turns to him. “You best win your next bout if you desire to remain amongst the living, Bacchus. You’re far too pretty for him to spare.”
“Well, first off, you might want to keep your elbow straight,” Steve says as he steps in to adjust Tony’s stance.
. Also, from a practical point of view, he needs to protect the asset, and he can’t do that if he’s balls-deep in someone else.
“And then the villain takes off his person mask, and he’s like… I don’t know, a bloody skull underneath.” Because Nazis don’t deserve skin, apparently.
Tony rolls his eyes. They’re just as bad as his older classmates salivating over girls. Steve’s focus on things that were
“Quiet, you,” Tony huffs but still manages to sound fond. “I still can’t believe you turned down twins. I’m sure they would have said yes if you were game.”
“Behave or your dominus will have you castrated,” the man had threatened before roughly pulling a cap over the crown of Suibne’s head.
Tony didn’t understand. He couldn’t understand because he lived in a debauched future where anything goes, where any number of traditional taboos were overlooked to the point where being attracted to the same sex wasn’t quite the automatic black mark it had been, especially if one had access to his bank account. No one cared if eccentric billionaire Tony Stark fucked men, but Captain America? Well… he had tried to avoid the tabloids in the days since the announcement, but he can’t imagine it had gone over swimmingly with the general public. However, once the mission is over and their marriage annulled as unconsummated, then they’ll understand it was for the greater good.
“Hey!” Steve yells as he sticks his knife deep into the temple of his second assailant, pulling it out as the zombie falls. He kicks at one of them, pushing it into a second, and drawing the attention of all three who turn to pursue him, leaving Tony upon the ladder.
If Antony were to own him, Stefanus would never be free; perhaps he would even cease to want to be, content to be the envy of the villa, serving as nothing but a hard cock to please his Dominus and any he may deem to share him with. What if Antony grew weary of him? He doubts he would cast him aside, but it will always be a possibility so long as he remained subservient to him. Would he ever free Stefanus if doing so meant the end of their public relationship? Would he be a liability to Antony’s reputation and standing in the community then?
In the aftermath of Stark’s revelation days before, Steve had spent quite a while thinking about the Jedi and their aversion to attachment. He always knew where he stood with Master Erskine. Though his original master had espoused many of the same beliefs as the instructors at the Academy, Steve knew the man cared about him all the same, but then again, Master Erskine cared about everyone. His attachment to Steve hadn’t been particularly specific or special. The man had compassion for all beings and cared for them equally as is appropriate for a Jedi.
“If you want to cop that attitude, you can forget about sex later,” Tony says with mock sternness. “You’ll be sleeping in the pool house.”
Stefanus thinks of Bacchus’s mother. What promises had her dominus made? What private arrangement had they had before he married another and sold her and their son off to parts unknown? Stefanus doesn’t think Antony would be so cruel, but then again, Bacchus’s mother probably didn’t think her dominus would be either.
Romulus looks from Antony to the man in the ring, who now has his opponent in a headlock. “Do you think it wise?”
Perhaps it is the nature of having only one friend or the fact that Steve literally lives with him that Tony eventually comes around, even without an overt apology on either side.
It isn’t until he comes home the following month that Tony realizes Steve omitted one not-so-tiny detail.
Stark is silent at that, and Steve thinks that maybe he gets it, a supposition that is confirmed when Stark inquires, “This isn’t about your Jedi vow to forswear all attachments, is it?”
“Don’t lie.” Purple Man doesn’t know why he even tries. Stark’s wasting his breath, what little he allows him anyway. He straightens up. “I don’t have time for this. Captain?” Rogers looks to Purple Man. “Strip.”
The guys graduate high school that summer – Steve and Bucky and all of them – and scatter shortly after as they enter the next phase of their lives. Bucky and Dum Dum enlist in the army after graduation, while Jim goes to technical school. Jacques becomes a plumber’s apprentice. Pinky gets a job at his stepfather’s grocery store, and Gabe attends community college while hoping to transfer to a SUNY later.
“He’s with you right now. Some would say that makes him complicit. Your mother promised Sarah to take care of the boy before she passed, but… he’s 18 now, too, isn’t he? No longer a boy by your reckoning.”
Tony can feel Steve shudder, his Adam’s apple dip, and the next thing he knows, Steve’s hands are on his ass, and he’s lifted into the air as Steve walks them back the short distance to his bed. He spills Tony across the surface, his lips swallowing Tony’s squeak of surprise and his hips lightly thrusting between his thighs.
I had to split the last chapter in two, because it got very VERY long. I also updated the tags to include racism. Tony meets Rhodey spring semester of his freshman year at MIT (circa early 1986). In late 1986, there was a study published about black student experience at MIT based on surveys of alumni who attended the university from 1969 to 1985. Many participants said they felt isolated and experienced cultural barriers with white students, and a minority (15%) experienced discrimination from classmates and white faculty (there apparently was a suggestion that they ‘go somewhere and do things you people can do’).
Tony falls back a bit behind Steve, his baseball bat raised but still a touch squeamish about being so up close and personal with the undead. He will adjust in time; they all have had to. Eventually.
Stark’s interest sounds piqued. “A fugitive?” he repeats. “I would ask if you are on the market for some professional help, but I suppose you have already contracted a bounty hunter…”
“I wouldn’t call it dating,” Steve clarifies. “We’re part of the same scene, and we used to hook up from time to time, but nothing that serious.”
Steve has a sinking feeling in his gut. What if Bucky hadn’t made it; what if he’s talking to his murderer right now? He can’t betray their location, especially with the ship out of commission. They’re sitting ducks. If it was Steve alone, he’d risk it, but with Stark stuck here as well…
They appear at the opposite end of the aisle, having run in from the direction of the back room. Sam has a large box under his arm. He had clearly forgotten to drop it in the alarm. “Everything okay?” he asks as they converge on Steve and Tony.
“You’ll die if I don’t,” he tries to reason. First Master Erskine, then Master Phillips, and now Stark himself? Steve can’t lose another person. He can’t. “I can help you.”
Aemilius pats Suibne on the back, pointedly casual with an easy smile to reassure the boy even as he tells Fidelis, “Better the babysitter than the pet.”
He’d been filling out, too. Whereas Steve had been a scrawny shrimp a mere four months prior, now he had grown tall – taller than Tony even – and while still slim, he’d started to bulk up a bit as well.
The stranger is rinsing his formerly brand-new Air Jordans in the bathroom sink of Tony’s dorm room, his socked feet tucked into Tony’s shower shoes. “Don’t worry about it,” he says, though he sounds annoyed and isn’t quite looking at Tony, concentrated as he is on the task at hand.
“You will have to stay longer with no excuse for an early exit,” Stefanus points out, even as he hooks his arms under Antony’s thighs to lift him up, walking him back to the bed as Antony holds on and plants kisses along Stefanus’s temple.
“Master Phillips, this is Steven Rogers. He will be accompanying us back to the Academy,” Master Erskine says, as if that is in any way a reasonable course of action. He addresses the boy, “Steven, this is Master Phillips; he’s the headmaster of the Jedi Academy I was telling you about.”
“Debatable, but ultimately irrelevant. I’ve got an arc reactor now, enough juice for fifty lifetimes,” he quips. “Now, are you going to be able to find your way back, or do I have to draw a map?” Tramp stamps are so 1999, but if he has to break out a sharpie and draw a downward arrow, he will.
Steve makes a beeline to his side, quickly assessing the restraints before breaking them with his bare hands. “Let’s get you out of here.” He hands the gun to Tony. “Here. I got you a gift.”
“I am entering the house,” Tony calls out from the back door. “I expect to find two of my favorite people in the entire world in the parlor. Intact and alive. With no further damage to the surroundings.” They can hear him remove his boots in an exaggerated fashion. “I will be sorely disappointed if this is not the case.”
“Is it true, Antony? Did you let this man…” Hadrianus can’t even finish his inquiry, too ashamed to speak the words, to even look at Antony.
The man holds the hem of his toga to his nose to staunch the blood. “Goo’ luck wit’ tha’ one,” he mumbles as he quickly shuffles away.
And so by the time Howard calls their hotel room and very sternly orders Tony back to MIT, Tony wants to tell him to fuck off, that he’s not done finding himself yet (AKA he hasn’t gotten Steve laid).
“You and I both know it’s got to be real. Cap doesn’t love me, and the only thing telling him is going to do is make him feel guilty for something he can’t control,” he reasons. The ache in his chest deepens and burns at the thought. “This isn’t his fault, alright? I know I can be a selfish asshole, but I’m not gonna do that to him.” Tony already has a bum ticker; it will be best for Steve and everyone else to assume it was his heart that ultimately gave out.
“Still can’t believe with a face like that, you’ve never been with anyone,” Stark is saying once again as reclines against a tree trunk, watching Steve practice his forms. “Never even been tempted, huh?”
Steve only sighs and moves to sit at the foot of Tony’s bed, keeping a careful distance from the man so he doesn’t so much as accidentally brush up against him. Tony is not surprised, but he is moderately disappointed at his friend’s behavior. Steve will likely distance himself from Tony entirely, physically if not emotionally. It hurts, but if this is what finally severs their decade-long friendship, so be it. If everything in his life is going to burn, then it is only a matter of time before–
Bucky gives Tony a curt once-over, likely sizing up the competition, so Tony stands up straighter, his chest puffed out in false bravado as he meets the other boy’s eye.
Romulus must be blind for him to not have been similarly smitten, Antony decides. Or he simply has bad taste.
“I will drink to that,” Antony finishes his wine only for Priscus to refill it. “Now about Hadrianus’s candidacy…”
Master Erskine had reviewed the file of one Steven Rogers. Orphaned at age four, he had been fostered out to a series of homes before landing in the group home ten months prior. Since then, he had been involved in a series of unexplained incidents and subsequently racked up a long list of demerits. The director of the establishment seems eager to be rid of him and is even willing to waive the customary waiting period and adoption fee, though he had heavily hinted that a donation in exchange for a speedy process would not be remiss.
“Honeybear’s at the National Society of Black Engineers tonight. He’s angling to be president by senior year,” Tony gushes over the phone. “And he can pull it off, too. He’s got real leadership potential, you know. No bullshit.”
Purple Man isn’t sure why. (He’s not a mind-reader after all.) The good captain is attractive but dull, too principled to be interesting, not like Stark, not like the Purple Man himself. He supposes there is no accounting for taste. Purple Man wonders whether Rogers has ever removed that stick out of his ass and let loose.
“Yeah, I can still come. I don’t have to be hard for that.” Tony sounds almost resigned at that. “We don’t have to, you know. I don’t need or want a pity fuck. Hell, I never even thought you’d be interested. I thought you were straight.”
“Cap?” Stark whispers, but Rogers doesn’t respond, his eyes closed and shut off to what’s happening to his body.
“That is correct. Largely, we create families by adopting foundlings and passing on our traditions, but we can have romantic liaisons if that’s what you’re asking.”
“All of them. They’re even rounding up the younglings. Nearly everyone with so-called Force sensitivity.”
Tony simply scoffs and curls into himself, bringing the sheets to encircle his shoulders in a cocoon of faux security. “You’re not my father. My father is dead.”
His piano lessons stopped that very summer after he had begged his father to stay, and he hadn’t seen his ex-piano teacher again until he was thrown out of his mother’s funeral, caviar smeared over his black suit. Perhaps Tony had always known…
Steve examines the photo, the colors faded with age, then tosses his own shield to Tony. “Come on. I’ll let you practice with the real thing.”
Steve knows Tony doesn’t really pay that much attention to the personal lives of his fellow Ultimates, but it’s been
Steve tries to placate him. “Look, sometimes… Sometimes, you talk about different things with different friends, okay?”
“I have to say Rhodey, I think going to Dr. Ferguson is really helping me, you know?” Tony tells him during one of their weekly calls. “So thank you for um… thanks for the recommendation.”
“Do you think me blind?” Tiberius says indignantly. “I can see plain as day that you still wear the praetexta.”
“I think you called it team bonding,” Tony replies, deliberately obtuse, as he eyes Cap’s aggressive posturing, the vein slightly pulsing in his temple. He congratulates himself on selecting the right target to drum up the man’s ire. He had initially considered the wisdom of using Nat to bait him instead but had settled on Bruce for two reasons:
It could be a trick. Bucky could be another bully, swooping in when Steve’s guard is down to uncertain ends, but then again, he did stick up for him. He didn’t need to do that, and Steve can’t yet surmise what possible scam Bucky might be angling for, and so he tentatively agrees, “…Okay.”
“The report claims it wasn’t a one-off, that it was an established pattern. They tracked down seventeen people – men and women – since your breakup with Jan.” It’s a question phrased as a statement.
“They would have sabotaged our ship in the hangar, obviously.” Master Phillips cuts down another two and telekinetically throws a third into a stone column.
And so, they talk about other things, about how Tony has been doing since the funeral – Tony says he’s been doing fine, just peachy; in other words, he lies – and about Rhodey’s job as an officer in the Air Force. There’s a lot of potential for upward mobility, and he believes he’s really found his calling in public service. Tony is happy for him. Rhodey would have been miserable working at Oscorp or SI; he’s sure of it. There’s also a new woman in his life, a fellow pilot named Carol, who seems promising, and maybe Tony will get to meet her for Christmas if the relationship lasts.
“You don’t get better for him. You do it for yourself, and if he happens to be standing there at the end of it all, then you figure that part out later.” Rhodey slips him a folded sheet of paper where he had handwritten a list of names and phone numbers. “I think one of these people can really help you. They’re good, you know. Professionals.”
“I’ve missed you, too.” The receiver is shaking in Tony’s hands. “And I’m sorry. For before. For everything. I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have… I know no means no, and I shouldn’t have pushed your boundaries or you. I know why you left. I know it’s my fault.”
Hadrianus’s expression is calculated but stern. “Have you finally grown tired of him? I must admit your infatuation lasted longer than ideal, but I am glad you finally have gotten
Tony narrows his eyes. “Careful, darling. People may take that the wrong way, and there’s only so many bruises I can explain away by saying I ran into a door.”
Tony sits up, his back straight and eyes wide. “Oh my God, you’re a genius,” he dives for the phone. “I have to tell him!” he tries to dial, but his fingers are clumsy and slow, much slower than Rhodey who similarly flops over and slams a limp hand down on the cradle of the phone to cut the call. Tony tries to push him off, but Rhodey is persistent, slapping him away.
There’s a crash from within, followed by shouts and curses, metal objects clattering and banging. Rhodey flinches; Steve holds tighter to the man’s blasters.
“I didn’t say anything,” Tony protests, and he wasn’t going to. Far be it for him to judge how the other half lives, especially someone who hadn’t inherited his millions.
Tony rolls over to face away from Steve. He lifts an arm, rolling his hand at the wrist. “Yeah, you’re probably bored anyway. Might as well cut our losses.”
Stark must step aside at the not-so-subtle threat because the table moves once again. Steve’s hand fumbles for his lightsaber, but it falls into the space between his hip and the hull, settling somewhere underneath him where he cannot reach.
“…So you’re saying that wasn’t the best sex of your life?” Tony says accusingly, vaguely insulted that Cap looks a little green around the gills.
Bacchus uses his metal shoulder to shrug off the blunted blade, dancing back an appropriate distance and keeping Stefanus at trident’s length. “I prefer to ask while you are otherwise occupied,” he swoops in and nearly manages to dislodge Stefanus’s shield, though the man manages to hold on at the last moment. “It’s harder for you to lie.”
“Hail Bucky?” Steve calls out, dropping the pile near the charred remains of the prior fire. “Dum Dum?” He peaks inside a lean-to, finding it empty. “James? Percival?” He walks the perimeter of the campsite. “Gabriel?” He looks down a path of crushed leaves and disturbed branches, recently traveled with footsteps leading away from camp. “Jim?”
“Not in the traditional sense, no, but there is more to life than the pollaxe and mace,” Bucky insists. As the younger son of a nobleman, he is always one fall of the horse, one rusty nail away from becoming the heir and so was required to learn his letters from a young age. By contrast, his men drew from the lower classes where such pursuits were more recreation than necessity, and a poor choice at that.
Cinaedus: Derogatory word for a man who is non-gender conforming, possibly androgynous or effeminate, and is the most frequent word for a man who allows himself to be anally penetrated. Cinaedus are also said to be highly attractive to women but devoid of true Roman manhood.
Stefanus brings a wooden sword down against Bacchus’s galerus. “Is this really the time?” he asks rather incredulously.
“Look, Stark, I’m not trying to be difficult for no reason, but every time we go out there as Avengers… there are no guarantees. I can’t say what’s going to happen next time. We get hurt; we hurt ‘em back. We get killed, we walk it off. And then we go out there the next day, and do it all over again. I’m comfortable doing that because it’s just me, but if I was an omega – and a pregnant one at that – I’m not sure I’d be comfortable putting my child’s life at risk.”
“It will be but a moment.” Antony retrieves a large soft leather case before passing it to Stefanus. “I had Proserpina acquire it from a merchant specializing in unusual imports from the north.”
Tony stiffens for a moment, just long enough for Purple Man to know he got to him, before he continues out the door.
It does nothing to cheer Stefanus up, the loss having put a damper on his plans as well as his spirit. “You go on ahead. I’ll… I’ll come by the room later.”
He glances at his companions. Pepper is holding up well, but Steve seems to be suffering in the dry heat, though Tony had supplied them both with wide-brim hats and hand fans to stay cool and out of the direct sun. Perhaps Rhodey had been right about Steve, though Tony is loath to admit it. With his weak constitution and lack of academic or experiential knowledge of what they are about to undertake, perhaps Tony should invite Pepper along instead, leaving Steve behind to mind the workers.
Steve is the one that pulls away after a moment, his eyes drifting open. “I’ve wanted to do that for years,” he admits, a touch breathless. He leans his forehead against Tony’s nude shoulder. He raises his head and sits back, his gaze trained on the way the sheets are rumpled between them. “You’re right when you said seeing Ryan upset me, but not because you’re gay or bi or however you identify.” He looks up at Tony. “It’s because I wanted it to be me. I wanted to be the fella who got to wake up next to you, but I thought for the longest time that it wasn’t possible because you were straight. It was easier when I thought you were straight because… because then I never even had a chance, you know. You’re bold, Tony. Fearless. You do what you want whenever you want. The fact that nothing has ever happened between us… it wasn’t that you’re just not into guys. If it’s never happened, then you simply didn’t want it with me.”
Steve’s skin is clammy and salty with sweat as Tony sucks a mark on the back of his neck and listens to the gentle hitching of the other man’s breathy moans, his near-inaudible pleas. With Steve’s thighs spread and draped over Tony’s still-clothed arms, the position allows him to gently bounce Steve up and down his length. His body is svelte and lightweight, more like that of a woman than most men he had been with, the differences all the less obvious with Steve turned away from him, but Tony knows better than to say that out loud, lest he end up with another black eye and blue balls.
There’s something about it that rubs Tony the wrong way, riling up the fighting spirit he had always reserved for Howard. “You got something you want to say?”
“I said shut up!” Steve stuffs three fingers into Tony’s mouth to stifle any further conversation and pushes back in, setting a punishing pace, uncaring of any whimpers from Tony. The slick squelch of their bodies moving together, Cap’s heavy breathing and Tony’s stifled moans blend together to form an obscene soundtrack to their frantic coupling. Tony’s hand slides downward to stroke his own weeping erection, tears forming at the corner of his eyes.
And so, Master Erskine appraises the child, noting his sickly countenance and sunken cheeks as well as the sharp shoulders sticking out from under his scratchy burlap shift. Steven fidgets under the attention, until Master Erskine finally breaks the ice. “I saw you earlier… outside. Why did you attack your friend?” he inquires bluntly, getting straight to the point.
Fat chance of that happening. Steve rarely shies from what is difficult. He has plans damn it, plans that require he meet Dracula, look him square in the eye, and–
“Not exactly.” Tony pulls back the cuff of his jacket to activate the device on his wrist. Immediately, thin, nearly-liquid feelers made of nanoparticles extend from the cuff, crawling over his hands to the tips of his fingers as well as up his arm over the black undersuit he’s wearing under his clothes to reach from feet to neck and over his ears. A blue holographic interface encompasses his head and wrists, engulfing him in a virtual world of interconnected dots, a soft blue spiderweb.
I revised the note on Chapter 1, but in case you haven’t seen it, please take a look at Jayjayverse’s wonderful art piece that inspired this fic located here:
“Relax,” Steve says, leaning back against the hull. “I’m only messing with you.” He knows only a Mandalorian has the right to bear their signature beskar armor.
Steve lies beside him, gathering Tony in his arms. “It’s not…” he begins, kissing him on the temple. “It’s not that I don’t want to, but I was thinking… if you wouldn’t mind… well…”
Tony quickly learns there is a reason for Steve to abstain from wine and spirits. Firstly, his alcohol tolerance is questionable at best, and he’s teetering by his second drink, which is unsurprising considering his size. And secondly, whereas Tony is a rather jovial fellow when inebriated, Steve, as it turns out, is a belligerent drunk, more so if one were to insinuate he came by his unfortunate disposition honestly.
“He told me he loves me,” Stefanus admits, shocking Bacchus into silence. “And I think I might… I think perhaps I…”
Stefanus meets Antony’s first lover, a freeborn patrician named Tiberius. Antony becomes jealous of Bacchus.
Stefanus thinks about his sword slicing down the base of Aemilius’s neck, about how every red denarius he earns will be going towards his and Bacchus’s freedom so they won’t meet the same fate. “I’ll consider it.”
He folds the pillow over his head, trying to block out the noise and get back to sleep, but there’s another crash then –
“Didn’t feel like nothing,” Tony murmurs, a mischievous smile tugging at the corner of his mouth, as he pulls him off the dance floor entirely in the direction of the exit. “You know, if you want to move this private party to the honeymoon suite…”
There’s nothing to do but talk. However, even knowing the reason is likely boredom, Steve finds the Mandalorian to be particularly chatty.
the tomb of Pharaoh Ramesses VIII,” he tells Steve. “He didn’t accomplish much during his reign, so most of this is about his ascension, his family and daily life, and…” he trails off to silence, a queer expression dawning on his face.
Perhaps the fates themselves had frowned upon his actions and saw fit to punish Antony swiftly because at that moment, Hadrianus enters the courtyard. Antony hopes he is just passing through to the tablinum, but he stops in front of Antony, peering down at him until he is acknowledged.
“Up pup pup, Cap,” Tony holds up a finger to silence him before folding his arms over his chest. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
Tony covers his ears then, his face pinched with grief as he nearly chokes on air and silent tears stream down his cheeks. He can barely believe it. His father is letting her die. He isn’t even going to try.
Steve’s fingers hook at the corner of his mouth, stretching his jaw as he drapes himself over Tony’s back, pushing him harder against the wall. His hips move erratically, nearly unbalancing Tony with his desperate thrusts. He’s close; Tony can tell, and when he finally comes, he spills deep inside Tony, his body becoming rigid and motions stilling as he mouths at the back of Tony’s neck. Tony’s hand slows as well, his dick still heavy and unsatisfied.
Tony doesn’t remove the arm around the good doctor’s shoulders. It could be a gesture of camaraderie, if he hadn’t been complimenting the man on the muscle definition of his biceps minutes earlier, just loud enough for the super-soldier to hear. “Don’t know, Cap. If it’s a question of ability–”
“He’ll be fine. What could go wrong?” Tony wants to retract his words the minute they leave his mouth. Virgil’s death, Gialetta’s betrayal and subsequent madness… even Rhodey himself had been forced to leave him after a number of years, no longer able to stomach his selfish obsession with adventuring, with finding a cure at the expense of everyone around him.
“Yeah. Who wouldn’t? He said he’d stop by the Mansion this summer. He has an internship with Oscorp this summer, but I’m trying to poach him for SI.”
He’d shut his eyes and grit his teeth against the abuse, silently suffering, too ashamed to tell anyone, perhaps afraid no one will believe him or worse, they’ll think he made it up in his hormone-addled mind, accusing him of having a crush on the teacher and trying to smear an innocent man whose only crime was to rightfully spurn him. Is that why Tony is so flirty with such a large segment of the student body, almost desperate for the touch of someone else? Anyone else? How long had this been going on with Dr. Pym pushing him to deeper and deeper levels of depravity before it escalated to unspeakable acts that resulted in the loss of his unicorn?
As luck would have it, Julia is quite nice. She listens to him talk about his relationship with Tiberius, about how he had tried so hard for so little, and sympathizes with his plight.
“Sorry,” Steve mumbles against the hickies trailing down his neck, as he places his large hands under Tony’s ass and lifts the man before turning to press him flush against the door. He moans, gently thrusting his erection in the space between Tony’s thighs, his length sliding over the lubed entrance. It’s a hint, a promise of what’s to come. “I can’t wait to be inside you, sweetheart.”
“There’s one,” Tony points to a dusty box with the top popped open on an upper shelf, “Lucky me, last one in stock.” Steve watches as Tony drops his bat and gleefully retrieves a rolling ladder, wheeling the creaky contraption across the concrete with a loud squeak and screech to line it up before he climbs it, reaching inside for his prize. “Got it.” He looks down at Steve in triumph before his face turns ashen and terrified.
“You Jedi… aren’t you clairvoyant?” The Mandalorian asks before simply shrugging at Steve’s silence. “He said there was something wrong, a rot in the Republic they were trying to identify and root out. He worried that if they failed, there would be repercussions for the Jedi.” He looks down at the pile of dead clone soldiers. “Seems he was right.” He holds out his hand for a shake. “The name’s Stark, by the way. Tony Stark.”
“Stay for a spell, dear Staius,” the host urges, his eyes drifting to the boy who had served Antony all night. “I’m sure the fair Lucius would love to entertain you further.”
Hodge waits for Master Phillips to leave. “Nice job, Rogers. You got us both detention,” he complains, elbowing Steve who subsequently rounds on him.
. We have cows back at the settlement. Real cows, and the bulls are useless as a source of dairy. Yeah, there’s always jerky and salted meat, but don’t you think we could all go for a good old-fashioned American cookout every once in a while when they’re freshly slaughtered? The small return to normalcy might improve morale.”
Steve curses then pulls at the belt holding his robes together, quickly wrapping it around his eyes and securing it with a knot behind his head. “Better?”
Tony reclines back in his leather chair, tugs at the black tie still dangling from his neck and unfastens the top two buttons underneath. He then lifts his heavy tumbler, eyeing the half-inch of amber liquid still sloshing clumsily from side to side. It’s the very last of Howard’s scotch, his special stash Tony had never been allowed to touch or so much as look at…
Dracula seems to cotton on to the source of his unease. “I do not wish to cause my son pain, and Anthony would be very sad if you were to meet an untimely demise at my hand.”
Steve grimaces and pushes him face-first into the pillow, his hand firmly planted on the back of his neck. “Quiet. No talking,” he orders. He picks up the pace, fucking into the man with reckless abandon, his expression pinched and eyes squeezed shut against the swell of memories, tears leaking at the corner of his eyes and mingling with beads of sweat dripping down his cheeks.
Steve is silent at that. He approaches, sitting at the foot of the bed Tony had claimed as his own and patting Tony on the calf. “I had a lot of fun, Tony. I always enjoy spending time with you.”
It’s Tony’s ninth birthday, and that means his father is leaving soon for his annual summer sojourn to the Arctic on a quest to recover an American icon.
When Steve had been a boy, back when his mother still drew breath, she had warned him of wandering too far off the beaten path.
His mother had died for Captain America, had died for Steve Rogers, and now Tony is here, allowing the very same man to kill him, too, to impale and slowly suffocate him upon the altar of an American icon.
“I am, but no one’s going to approach me if you’re standing right next to me looking like a member of the Secret Service instead of a man on his honeymoon.”
“If you hang tight, maybe I can swing by in a couple days, but it’s crazy here, man. You know that Supreme Chancellor Palpatine guy?”
Purple Man isn’t stupid. There must be an endgame to this little venture, a bigger play, and he wants in on the ground floor of whatever Stark’s got planned. It’s not too difficult. He’s used to this, to getting what he wants exactly when he wants it. No one can resist at this range. Truth told, he should have ruled the world with his power, though he’s limited to only as far as his pheromones can travel. But Stark? Stark has the money, the social capital, and the ideas – the very means he’d need to take over everything – but he clearly lacks the stomach for it. The want, that clawing needy ambition in his belly, now that’s where Purple Man
Tony holds the rounded weapon, lightweight and balanced, but still lacking a little something. “You know, I can take this to the lab and make some modern improvements.” But at Steve’s face, he quickly backtracks. “Kidding. Sort of.” It wouldn’t be hard, but perhaps some things are best left alone.
He may be (temporarily) confined to a physical prison, but Stark is trapped in a cage within his own mind, constrained from pursuing what he most desires. He will never escape him, even now. He will never be free of what had transpired during their time together, and when Purple Man gets out, they’ll pick up right where they left off – him and Stark – working to build that better tomorrow in a haze of purple…
“And you always do everything Daddy Fury asks you to?” Tony allows his eyes to drag up and down Rogers’s body, letting his disdain shine through. “What am I saying? You’re wearing a spangly outfit that does absolutely nothing for your ass. Of course you’ll do whatever you’re told as long as they claim it’s for the good ol’ U-S-of-A.”
“See, it’s housed outside his body, like a normal scepter,” Tony says in hushed tones, a touch triumphant.
“I am worried about you, Antony,” Romulus had said once when he had noticed Antony had dropped considerable weight in an effort to maintain Tiberius’s boyish ideal.
It isn’t a terrible idea, but – “Because dating a fellow Ultimate worked out so well for both of us?”
He couldn’t, of course. For one, it would tank Stark Industries’ stock price, and however will his shareholders afford their private islands then? They may have to downsize their yachts to last year’s model, and wouldn’t that be a travesty? And two…
Rhodey reiterates, “So, if you’re putting a cop car on a building – even a fake one – it’s gotta be without me; got it?”
The grinder is a loss, dented and covered in rancid flesh and sinew. He drops the device with a loud clunk and sighs, nearly falling to his knees as Steve catches him.
Steve glares at the journalist. He may be right but bringing up Natasha was a bridge too far. It was ghoulish, unseemly, and completely inappropriate given the circumstances. He takes a half-step forward, but Tony grabs his hand before he can go any further and squeezes, subtly reminding him to play nice, to smile or at least not challenge the guy to step outside and settle it like real men.
He holds up his hands palms-out in placation. “Or maybe it found an even-more innocent mark, like it wandered off after a kindergartner or something. I don’t know? Did we have family visits recently? I’m sure it’s got nothing to do with what Stark may or may not be doing on his free time.”
G-E-T-T-I-N-G / T-H-E-R-E, then a pause, D-U-M / D-U-M / S-A-Y-S / Y-O-U / G-O-T / D-E-T-E-N-T-I-O-N / A-G-A-I-N
They’re faster and more agile than the ones outside, having been shielded from the heat and sun in their warehouse mausoleum, and with three attacking at once, Steve is having more trouble dispatching one while trying to fend the others off. He manages the first while another reaches for his exposed elbow…
“The man’s arm was broken during training; it will take six weeks to heal, meaning he will miss our match altogether!” Stefanus shouts. “Crispus has been disciplined, but still he was able to afford multiple prostitutes to warm his bed for the week!” His arms flex, and he looks very much like he’d like to strangle Antony, but instead his hands cover his face, his fingers sliding down like claws over his eyes and down his cheeks as he takes a deep breath. “Bacchus is slated to be his replacement.”
“You should celebrate, Stefanus, for tonight we are alive when by all rights we should be dead,” Bacchus says as he pours another draught of wine into his clay cup. “If Pompeia is not to your liking, there are many other ladies willing to entertain the victors.” He follows Stefanus’s line of sight, settling on the half-naked youth across the room. “Or boys.”
A common tunic typically costs around 15 sestertii. (For reference a loaf of bread cost around 2 Asses. A Roman secretary made around 15 denarii a month, and a lecturer made 12 denarii a month. Rent ranged from 48-288 denarii/year while a male slave cost approximately 500 denarii and a female slave could run you 2000-6000 denarii.)
He sweeps back his foot, outstretches his hand and flexes his fingers as the suit mimics his movements, the final command charging up the repulsors.
“Oh my God,” Tony exclaims, realization dawning. “You know exactly what it means to eat someone out.” There is only one possible explanation. “Steve. Have you been watching porn?”
“Bah! You young people are always throwing out perfectly good things when something new and shiny comes along,” Dracula grumbles, leading them towards the dining room. “Back in my day, all we had was a stick and a ball and were glad for it.”
“Like charming 2012’s Sexiest Alpha Alive, Channing Tatum?” Clint inquires, only to be kicked by Nat. He turns to his fellow Avenger and best friend. “What? We all saw the pictures of last week’s charity shindig. He’s got to be what? Ten years younger than Tony.” Clint gives him a double thumbs up. “Good job on pulling Magic Mike, by the way. Respect.”
“Of course not. Everyone’s different.” Steve rolls in place, heel-toe then back again, before blurting out, “So, is it true you have super-hearing? To make up for…” he points at his own eyes, but probably realizing that either Tony can’t see him or that it’s rude to point out someone’s disability, he quickly drops the gesture. “Bucky – that’s my best friend, you know – he says that if you lose one sense, the others get even better.”
“If you’re having so much trouble following guidelines, how about I simplify it then, make it easier for you to remember: No talking. Period.” Tony flips onto his knees and elbows and spreads his legs. “Now, fuck me like you mean it.” When Steve doesn’t immediately shuffle over and slide back in, Tony looks over his shoulder. “What are you waiting for? A written invitation?”
“How about a kiss to celebrate?” Tony suggests as he clumsily maneuvers once again into the guy’s personal space.
“I cannot believe you,” Hadrianus fumes, his hand tight on Antony’s forearm to the point of bruising. “The crowd clearly desired the retiarius’s death, and you reprieve him instead. What have I told you about shirking popular opinion?”
“Oh look, another one there be,” says a voice emanating from a bouncing blue light flitting from one end of the circle to the other.
“That vappa ac nebulo, that cursed bearer-of-filth,” a familiar gravelly voice grumbles, a quiet sort of rage behind the invective.
“Or maybe the Easter Bunny? The rabbit that shits colorful eggs we’re expected to collect and ingest.”
“That’s what? Like fifty rejections? Has to be an Academy record,” Bruce comments, as he opens his locker beside Tony’s.
Antony scoots away, the bathwater sloshing as he stands and reaches for a linen to dry off. Stefanus follows suit, wrapping the towel around his waist and trailing after Antony into his nearby bed chambers.
“How gullible do you think I am exactly? The one time I bring a man home, and it’s got you tied up in knots, and you expect me to somehow believe it’s unrelated? That you’re cool with me liking dick? Well, fuck you, Steve Rogers. Fuck–”
And with that, Hadrianus leaves, exiting the peristylium into the tablinum to sort out his affairs for the day.
Tony offers to cosign on Steve’s student loans, but Steve declines his offer, instead attending part-time community college for graphic design while working retail in a paint shop.
But the man insists. “I need it. I’ll buy it. Besides, it will make a great addition to my private bath. An inspiration really.” His voice drops low. “Perhaps you can accompany me in the bath later, and we can… appreciate the arts. Together. People say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.”
Dolete puellae. Vos mentula desuerit, dolete puellae. Pedicare volo. Cunne superbe vale! = This has been translated as “Weep, you girls. My penis has given you up. Now it penetrates men’s behinds. Goodbye, wondrous femininity!” or (less charitably) “Cry, girls. My penis has given you up. Now I want to fuck ass. Goodbye, arrogant vagina!” So uh… translation is more an art than a science, probably.
And so he pulls out and does just that. Stefanus hisses in pain. His body goes rigid and taut, but he doesn’t dare move away. The man moans, shudders, then pushes Stefanus down into the mattress as he comes, spilling over his ass and down the back of his thighs. Then he gathers up some of the dripping come on his fingers, plunging two into Stefanus’s empty channel to the knuckle. Stefanus grunts at the intrusion, his back arched in surprise.
So… last night hadn’t been a simple nightmare but the actual hate-fueled fuck fest he remembers. They had gotten into an argument – a common incident since the formation of the Avengers ten months prior – but one that had escalated in intensity until an irate sort of lust overcame their better judgment. He had tried to shut Cap up by shoving his dick in his mouth (which hadn’t worked), and Cap had in turn bent Tony over his workbench and fucked him so thoroughly, Tony barely managed to muster the limited brainpower required for the most banal of insults. They were half-hearted at best, ill-conceived and lacking even the shadow of truth that could cut his adversaries to the quick. Because there’s no way Cap took that whole ‘small-dicked wonder’ thing seriously when he was buried balls-deep in Tony’s moaning, shivering body, plowing deeper within than any other alpha had ever managed to do. And Cap knew it too, that bastard.
“I am not trying to do so,” Stefanus insists, finally confessing, “I love you, Antony, and I want to be with you! I don’t want Bacchus, not in that way!”
He hears them: the crack of snapping vegetation, the heavy step of metal boots, their identical shouts and high pitched whine of their weapons as they spread out and pepper the underbrush with blaster fire. Some even travel ahead, skirting the edges before doubling back, trying to surround Steve in a net of personnel.
Bacchus can’t quite meet Stefanus’s eye. “Yeah. And I’m sorry. I said what I said at the time because… because something terrible was about to happen, and you needed to believe there was a way out, that it could get better someday. I thought maybe you’d wise up on your own, but you weren’t born into this; you don’t know how it works, what free men are like.” There’s another moment of hesitation before Bacchus turns to face him, looking him directly in the eye. “I was a vernae, Stefanus. A vernae. I had no father, but my mother was a concubina at the villa, and my dominus was… Vernae are supposed to be cared for because our sires are usually free men of the house. But then Dominus married, and his new wife… she didn’t like my mother much. Or me. And so when the harvest was bad one year too many, she found a way to rid her villa of us both, but not by freeing us.”
Steve blushes scarlet, and Tony knows he’s hit on the truth. Then he remembers how Steve had appeared flustered in his apartment. “Steve, when you said the second bedroom was for guests…”
Tony narrates the action. “…Until finally – Naught remains but a frozen, petrified figure in a state of suspended animation,” he says, moving the submarine in a slow arc around the minifigure, “a figure which drifts past the undersea craft of – The Avenger!”
“It’s good for him. Can you imagine going through all that and being evicted on top of everything? At least he has a home.”
The Mandalorian nods. “That may be so, but it does not change anything. I took his money and gave him my word to see this mission through, and you should know a Mandalorian’s word is his bond.”
When Steve returns hours later with some edible mushrooms, Stark had already snared and spit-roasted two small mammals over the fire. He rotates them to evenly crisp the skin as Steve takes a seat across from him. Steve fills up a pot with some water from his canteen and places it near the fire to boil. He’ll have his mushrooms while Stark eats whatever he’s cooking. Steve hopes he chokes on the creatures’ tiny bones. He hopes–
“Where do you think the meat grinders are? Home appliances?” Tony hazards a guess as he tags along, his eyes trained on the passing overhead aisle listings. “Is there a kitchen department?”
That does nothing to reassure Steve. He is a light sleeper, but vampires are even lighter intruders.
From then on, Tony resolves to grow out his facial hair in an attempt to make himself look older. It grows in thin and patchy, but Tony cultivates it, hoping he can pass off his five-week growth as a five-o’clock shadow. It doesn’t really work. Even if his goatee had been passable, everyone already knew of Tony Stark, fifteen-year-old wunderkind. He is something of an anomaly on campus, and he wrecked the curve in all his classes, earning the ire of many an engineering student, who often jeered that the only friends he had were ones he had built himself.
So perhaps Tony’s original intentions while embarking on this little affair weren’t exactly pure. He had seen a chink in the façade of a perfect all American hero, and he had picked at it, hoping to defile Steve, to degrade the image of Captain America as one last fuck-you to Howard and his legacy. Just imagine: the quintessential all-American hero balls-deep in an all-too-American monster.
Mr. Rogers’s mouth straightens into a thin, hard line. “So, are you saying Irish need not apply?” His tone is harsh, his demeanor transformed into one of fight rather than docility as he straightens out to his full height and crosses his lanky arms.
“What’s the status, J?” Tony says, the gantry still whirring about removing his armor. He stands still for the scan, holding his breath for the AI’s verdict. He should have seen the hit coming. He should have protected his core. He should have–
“Not a problem, but the next bed will be steel-reinforced, so the only issue will be the mattress if you want to try again.”
Antony accepts the greeting before reclining on the empty settee opposite Priscus. “Yes, very much so,” he replies, easing into an informal diplomacy on behalf of his father. “I hope we can count on your support in the upcoming election.” Among certain circles, it always played well to pay lip service to the paterfamilias, such fealty being the cornerstone of Roman society, at least in theory.
“It’s about Tony,” he clarifies instead. He sighs. His planned speech isn’t going to work so he might as well get to the point. “As you know, we’ve been together for a couple years now. I love him, and he loves me, so I would like to ask for his hand in marriage.”
“Uri, Vinciri, Verberari Ferroque Necari” is a vow gladiators recite before fights. It means “(I will endure) to be burned, to be chained, to be beaten and to be killed by the sword.” Even freedmen/freemen who have sold themselves to the ludus take this oath with the understanding that they could very well die.
“What does it matter? If a dominus and slave can form a relationship, then why not a free and freedman?”
“You’re on.” Clint shakes her hand. “They don’t even like each other. Easiest twenty bucks I’ve ever made.”
Tony leans back in his conference chair, his head tilted and fingers fanned over the side of his face from chin to temple. “Cap, your suit,” he says.
Bacchus is not one to skirt the issue at hand. “What troubles you so?” he asks, digging into his own bowl.
“You can’t go to the Arctic this year,” he tells him. His approach is sheepish, a touch unsure. His hands are clammy around his stack of collated and clipped papers.
“Pleased to make your acquaintance, miss,” Tony says, but from behind his sunglasses, his eyes flit around her to catch a glimpse of Steven.
Unable to stop or collect himself, Tony collapses to his knees, his body shivering with exertion as he coughs loud and wet, expelling a deluge of full-bloom gardenias weighed down and slicked closed with bloody mucus. Cap’s hands are on him again, trying to lift him up, but Tony pushes him off. He doesn’t want his help, had never wanted Steve to see him like this, but then he feels the flowers searing through his lungs, the painful breathlessness, and he’s doubled over again and retching.
There are things Tony missed about being a child: the endless potential, a metabolism that can’t be beat, and hell, being able to turn his head all the way to the left after sleeping on it wrong.
Stefanus brings his wooden sword down on Bacchus’s unprotected right shoulder, causing the man to hiss in pain and roll out his arm to ease the ache.
“I suppose not,” Purple Man concedes, resting his cheek on a closed fist in boredom. “I never made my G.I. Joes have sex as a boy.” He angles his head to look at Rogers’s face in curiosity. The man’s eyes are closed, his jaw tight and squared, teeth indenting his bottom lip in what might be either pain or pleasure. It’s hard to say when the only noise is the squelch of wet fingers and Tony’s muffled cries.
“Where do you want me, Dominus?” Stefanus asks, while he folds up his tunic to prevent wrinkles and sets it by his feet. Though he lacks body hair as is appropriate for one of his station, it is clearly not his body’s natural state. He must shave to maintain the Roman ideal, but even then, he’s much too large and muscular, well past his prime for such work, but Antony doesn’t care. He prefers the strength and virility of real men over the dainty affect of boys.
Tony looks perplexed. “I sort of do. I don’t know about where you come from, but that’s part of the educational process around these parts.”
“Easy for you to say,” Tony retorts. “You’ve never spilled your deepest, darkest secrets out to a… to a–”
He says as much only for Stark to grumble about how much trouble Steve has already proven to be and how it is possible that he might even lose money on this mission. He should have asked for more up front.
That shuts Steve up. “I’m leaving,” he says over his shoulder as he exits. “Give me a call when you’re sober.”
So, maybe Steve is not ready to settle down exactly. He’s not looking for forever – has learned that forever is never guaranteed to begin with, no matter his partner – but he could spend the next two years or however long he’s got with Tony, living each day as it comes like the gift that it is.
“You are worried for your friend, the Barnes boy. You are afraid you will lose him,” Master Phillips says, and for a minute, Steve thinks maybe he understands, but then he continues, “You should not. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side. Attachment – the desire to hold onto something – can lead you to take more extreme measures to keep it. You must let go of these desires, accept that all things pass away eventually.”
Though he hadn’t seen a thing, blindfolded as he was, he had felt the curves and angles of his face. He knows Stark sports a trimmed beard or perhaps long stubble, and his skin had felt soft but still firm, with no deep wrinkles to speak of. Would there ever be an occasion where Stark will voluntarily remove his helmet in Steve’s presence? Let him see what’s beneath?
“You’re still a child yet. Sometimes, it takes a while…” Mr. Morelli plays a sample of the new music, his tanned fingers moving deftly across the ivories. “And a little practice.”
Stripped of his home, his clothes, his freedom, all Suibne has is his name, until Priscus takes that away from him as well shortly before he enrolls him as a novicus in his ludus.
“…Why are you wearing dark glasses inside the house?” Steve asks with all the bluntness of his eleven years. “Are you blind? Do you need help finding your cane?” He surveys the general vicinity, looking for the signature white cane of the visually-impaired. “There’s a blind kid in my class, and sometimes she wears sunglasses indoors, too.”
“I was only pointing out the obvious. Look at you. You have to know what you look like, what you are. You’re going to fail out of the Order after the Initiate Trials anyway. I don’t know why they even bothered admitting you.”
And their men – Gabriel, Dum Dum, James, Percival, and Jim – had they not had his back in the thick of battle when he became stuck in the press of bodies and blood-soaked mud, when he had swung wildly to avoid the mace and wooden bludgeons of the enemy? Had it not been they who covered for him, helped pull him from the muck and viscera?
It was a good fight, and the crowd seems to agree when a prone Aemilius raises his forefinger in a bid for mercy, the demands to “Slay him!” drowned out by the cries to “Let him go!”
On the flipside, what if he’s too big with Antony’s body unable to accommodate his massive girth? He supposes the solution would be the same in either case, but he would be relying on spurious rumor for his satisfaction.
“And Ms. Sarah has a son who’s your age. Isn’t that nice, Tony? Why don’t you show him around your play room?”
Tony looks disappointed but understanding. “They’re in the toiletry bag alongside the lube,” he repeats.
“Lady and gentleman, this is what we are after.” He unrolls the copy of the inscription with a flourish, revealing a young maiden – a servant perhaps – presenting the Golden Rod to Ramesses III in the time before it was passed down to his son and eventual heir, Ramesses VIII. Steve, who stands to his immediate left, has already seen it, but Tony cannot resist the pomp. “The Golden Rod of Destiny, last owned by Pharaoh Ramesses VIII. Legend holds that the wielder will be granted untold powers, bringing peace and prosperity to the land…”
It had been a laughable dream, in retrospect. A fairy tale you’d tell children about heroes overcoming impossible odds with everything returning to normal as if nothing bad had ever happened. And yet–
“You’re not ready to go yet? The ship has docked, and– Oh!” she stops when she sees Steve still in bed, nude from the waist up, blond hair sticking up in all directions and red and purple hickeys down over his neck and chest, the sheets rumpled in ways that indicated rather rigorous activity. He pulls the sheet up under his armpits and turns an interesting shade of scarlet, looking away from Pepper’s gaze.
Master Phillips, on the other hand… Master Phillips had been unexpected. He had spent years trying to metaphorically beat the attachment out of Steve only to have taken extraordinary measures to ensure his survival, beyond what he had done for anyone else. Perhaps it had been a favor to his departed friend or maybe it was because Steve was his padawan and he had felt a certain responsibility for him.
