“We should come back to the Mansion one of these days,” Tony said idly as they walked.  “High limit room, private pool, VIP entrance, courtesy Rolls, you’d like it.”
“I’m sorry. That’s…well, clearly, it’s none of my business how to live your life,” Steve said, and Tony could practically hear those words being forced out. Someone doesn’t like to give up without a fight, he thought, oddly pleased by the idea that he’d become worth fighting over just because Steve didn’t like…didn’t like what? That he thought it was okay to be used. Well, when you put it like that…what the fuck was he even doing, playing around in some shithole closet in Brooklyn anyway? Sure, this guy was a specimen, but he was Tony Stark. He wasn’t quite this desperate.
“Yes, I know you did.  Difficult to understand for you, I’d imagine, but that isn’t quite what she was hoping for. You know that I do not countenance some of your parents’ choices in regards to you, but, it would be good of you to visit.  Let her see you,” Jarvis urged.
“I know!  That’s basically what I said about it.  And see?  Here we have a situation where that exact kind of knowledge comes in handy.  I mean, let’s face it, with us, you really never know.  Better to be prepared, I say, instead of just flying by the seat of your pants, hoping for the best, reacting instead of thinking it through—you’re just going to let me go on, aren’t you?  You’re far less judgmental like this,” Tony observed flatly.  Steve dropped the breadstick on the ground, then let out a distressed whine as he flexed his empty hand, lip trembling and forehead scrunched in confusion.  “Or not,” Tony amended.
“I missed you at dinner,” Steve said in slight reproach.  “I wanted to talk to you about something.”
So, a dear friend over on tumblr drew some art in the Celestial Navigation 'verse, which featured Tony in lingerie.  I was...very inspired by this whole concept, let's say.  Here is 7500 words of CN lingerie/uniform fetish porn.
“I—yeah. I am. I guess. We are,” Tony replied.  The endive salad disappeared and dessert was served.  Some kind of puff pastries with a deep, red sauce drizzled over them and a spot of cream on the side.  Not rhubarb pie, Tony thought with a rueful look at Jarvis who returned it with a raised eyebrow.
“No,” Tony said after a moment.   “Delete it.  All of it.”  Tony lay back against the pillows and stared up at the ceiling.  This wasn’t a big deal.  It wasn’t. Few hours of babysitting was all it was.  Nothing to get worked up about.
“Ah-aah--oh,” Steve stuttered, ending in a moan.  He knew he liked touching himself there, but he hadn’t realized  how much more intense it would feel when someone else did.  Tony massaged his balls, squeezing and tugging seemingly at random, finally releasing them when Steve’s cock spurted a copious line of pre-cum across his hip.  “Sorry,” Steve managed.
“Huh.  Appears the vegetables are all that is left for your poor King,” Tony huffed, gave Cam a stern look, then laughed.  “I ate with the Court, do not fear, I am quite full.  If you are ready to retire, you may return to your room.  A surprise awaits you.  I’m told,” he continued, looking briefly down at Steve, “that it is one that will please you quite a bit,” Tony said, his tone growing more serious as he studied Cam.  “I cannot wholly undo what was done in my name, but I can begin to right it.  Go.  Enjoy your surprise.”
Well, shit, Tony thought, closing the cigar box lid with a soft thump. A stroll down memory lane was not on today’s agenda, but there it was, laid bare, these soft, secret places best kept hidden in boxes on bookshelves and shoved in the back of drawers.
Tony frowned bemusedly and tilted his head to the side, opening his mouth, then thinking better of it. “You know, some things are just better left a mystery.  But, really, you don’t have to do this, just saying.”
Steve let his eyes fall closed. He tilted his head to the side, offering his neck.  “I am here, Tony. I am here,” he whispered, feeling the breath rattle around in his chest.  Tony leaned over him, wrapping his arms around Steve in a semblance of an embrace.  It felt good. Steve leaned in to the hard press of Tony’s body, solid and strong. He felt Tony’s lips on his, brief, chaste, barely a kiss, but a promise, nonetheless.
,” Steve reiterated.  Tony grimaced, but didn’t correct him this time. “He was drunk off his ass, so were most of the guys with him. Security or hangers-on, whoever they were, I don’t know.  I handled it. I can take care of myself, Tony,” he said, giving Tony a small, rueful smile. He looked down at his lap, where Tony’s hand was wound so tightly around his that he could see the whites of Tony’s knuckles against the usual tan of his skin.  It was nice. To have someone care so much. To have someone want to fight your battles for you. To have someone on your side. He supposed, that’s why he was here, now, ready to go face a press corps that wanted to eat him alive, then spit him out, because Tony deserved that, too.
Seemingly satisfied, Tony turned back towards one of the trunks. One with a lock, Steve noticed, nostrils flaring as he breathed out and let the outer robe fall to his feet. The diaphanous inner robe was next and it soon joined the other, leaving Steve bare, save for his collar. He reached up and fingered at the blood-red jewel at its center, the familiar feel of it somehow calming.
Tony, really see him, see all of him at once and not look away. The spike of pure want that burned through him wasn't a surprise, exactly, though the force of it was. He wanted Steve. Here, now. Everywhere, all the time.
“The Tower has a lot of extra security features.  Not all of them obvious.  I can go through them with you.  Again, I mean,” Tony offered, trying not to sound overly excited at the idea of explaining everything again to an avidly-listening Steve who kept telling Tony how amazing everything was.  Sure, that was nice in a…life-affirming sort of way, fine, but he only listened to the recordings those few—ten—twenty--whatever, times.  “Besides, like you said, comes with the hero territory, and if they’re going to come at us, better we’re together, right?”
“That’s it, baby.  That’s it.  Come for me, Steve.  Come on my cock,” Tony commanded, his voice clear and sure in Steve’s ears, and that was all it took, though when he came, the strength of the spasms took him almost by surprise.  He shouted, and could feel himself contracting around Tony as long streams of white spilled out of him.   Tony grasped his hips harder now and thrust up, again and again, pounding into Steve.  He wasn’t sure which one of them was making the long, low keening noise, though Steve suspected it was him.
Steve made a harrumphing sound, then lumbered over to his bed by the fire, sitting down and arranging the quilt around his legs again to ward off the draft the opened door allowed in.  “Well, have a seat, then, I suppose.”
“Okay, well, good, I guess. Doesn’t matter. Forget him,” Tony amended, waving a hand.  “Just, you know.  Don’t think about him.”  That…seemed to be an important point.  The car pulled up to the Rio’s VIP entrance, though that, too, was packed this time of night, with people dragging themselves back from other casinos and hot spots.  A few of them shouted as he and Steve got out of the car, but, luckily, most of the crowd was too drunk to be anything other than friendly.  Tony nodded good night to Happy and followed Steve inside the hotel.
He had caught Tony’s eye in the mirror then, Steve remembered as the carriage rolled on.  He hadn’t known what he wanted to say.  Everything. Nothing. His thoughts had been a knotted jumble and a smooth plain at the same time.  If he tried to pluck a thread loose, it disappeared, floated away into nothingness, but the urge to say something was there, gnawing at him.
Tony hunched forward over the steering wheel and squinted until he caught the glint of a metal railing in the Audi’s headlights.  He pulled off into one of the five parking spaces lined with barely-there yellow paint.  A sign next to the brown and yellow state forest marker warned them to beware of falling rocks.  A smaller sign nailed to the railing in front of the car’s hood told them not to sit on it or lean.  Charming, Tony thought.  If you’re a forest ranger.  Or a serial killer.
He was going to give himself a day.  He’d known that before the justifications for it even flowed through his head.  If this was all he got, then he was going to take it.
“Patton.  Actor for Patton,” Stark amended, toggling his head back and forth.  “You know who I work with,” Stark said.  It wasn’t a question, though he did raise his eyebrows at Steve in speculation.  “Natasha, Wilson, every one of them, heroes.  So, what makes some kid from Brooklyn sign his life away to the good, ol’U-S-of—wait,” Stark laughed then, bright and clear with none of what Steve had come to think of as Stark’s usual way of making a laugh into some kind of judgment.  “I think I’ve heard this story.  Nevermind.  You.  I’m supposed to ask you questions. That’s what people do on dates, right?  Get to know each other?”
It was over in a flash, and Tony wondered if it had been for the cameras furiously recording and clicking around them like a wall of small, intrusive, brightly-colored bricks.  But, then Steve smiled, that soft, warm one that made all the worries and questions seem to melt off his face, and it was just for him, Tony realized.   This look, that open, easy happiness that smoothed away everything else, that was for Tony.  The wide, pasted-on smile, the self-deprecating one he gave the paparazzi, the devilish one he flashed sometimes, those were looks he gave the world, but this one…this one was Tony’s.
“Get it over a mile and I’ll put on that other little red number you like so much,” Tony threw in as Steve leaned down to place the ball on the rug in front of firepit.
“He’s four, Obie, stop seeing dollar signs,” Maria admonished, though it was light and fond, without a hint of real censure.
Tony was quiet for a long moment, then he took a drink and rolled his lips together before setting his glass side and looking over at Steve. “I guess we all know a bit about seeing only what we want to see.  Wanting to...only show the world the best parts of us, not the...parts we don’t like so much.” He stood up and slowly stepped forward into the shallow pool, almost seeming to Steve to loom there, larger than life, larger than he should be, tilting his head to the side and regarding Steve with a careful expression.
“You may have mentioned that, once or twice.  Hard to really keep track,” Tony mumbled, the words lost to a garble as Steve found his mouth.  Tony laughed, a light, breathy sound that turned into a moan and tightened his hold on Steve’s neck, letting his spine curve back as Steve’s hands dropped to capture his hips.
“I’m in a cab on my way over,” Pepper replied, sounding harried.  “I texted Deborah. She’s doing a Fifth Avenue brownstone, but she’s on her way, too.  And I had David pull some folks off the Tower job, so we’ve got people. He wants to know what the hell is open in Brooklyn all night that has drywall.  He has an architect friend who does small spaces.  Caught him at the end of a dinner date, so he’s on his way over, too.  We’ll take care of it.”
The jet had been hit, Tony remembered that much. It had been in stealth mode, so that should have been impossible, but the bits and pieces of it strewn over the side of the mountain begged to differ.  One minute, Steve had been standing behind where Tony sat in the pilot’s seat telling Tony with a completely straight face that Wanda seemed to have taken an interest in computer programming and asking if Tony had any books on the subject he could recommend, the sly, little shit with the aw-shucks, innocent routine down pat, and the next minute the jet was in pieces, and they were falling.
Tony shook his head and walked closer to the circle.  He lay a hand on one of the rocks, pulling a leaf off a vine that had snaked into one of the crevices.  “Exaggerated, I’m sure,” he said, glancing back at Steve.
“Captain Rogers. I’ve brought Mr. Stark.  The one I told you about.  He’s just here to meet you and answer any questions you might have about the Avengers Initiative, if you feel up to it, of course,” Fury said mildly, hands braced behind his back.
“Love makes you crazy,” Tony replied, meaning it to sound flippant and teasing, but he didn’t stick the landing.  “I know you can’t just flip a switch and have everything be okay with us again.  And I realize I didn’t help myself the other day at the Tower.  That was…not my finest moment, let’s just say.  I know, I shouldn’t have—I mean, obviously, I shouldn’t have.  Full stop.  But, even then, even with thinking what I did, I still wanted to be with you.  Can you—can that count for something?”
“Is it…does it hurt?” Steve asked.  He was still.  Not moving, not touching, everything wound up while he waited.
“It’s working!” Steve called over his shoulder.  A tentacle thumped at the side of the boat, probably Shellhead’s way of saying, ‘Of course it’s working, dummy, I designed it.’  Steve smiled.
“Forget it,” Tony heard himself say, waving a hand through the air.  “That’s nothing compared to what the Board dishes out.  She’s used to deflecting for me.  Look, Steve….this…I really am sorry about it.”
“Keep people at a distance, I guess,” Kirk shrugged.  “Easier.  With all of this.  Or, whatever.  Most people don’t like me much anyway, so, why bother, right?”
Which…through a Rube Goldberg-esque series of events, somehow led him to a point in his life where he was standing in a tiny Brooklyn apartment, cooking hamburgers over a grill that seemed to run on the equivalent of gerbil-wheel power, while getting berated as a slumlord by some kid who thought premature gray was a good look for him.
“It has been a while,” Tony agreed.  “It is good to see you, Wendell. And you, Daniel!  You’ve grown into a fine young man, from what I hear.”
“I blame James for this,” Steve said around a sigh. He rubbed a hand over his forehead and scraped it back over his head, making his hair stand on end.
“That…ah, that so?” Steve asked, punctuating each word with a sort of strained tone that pulled at the vowels.  He looked across the table at Tony with something that might have been mere curiosity, but felt different, more…possessive, Tony’s mind settled on with a small shiver that raced down his spine and coiled warmth low in his belly.
“First time I thought about it, not counting middle school through high school years, which I think— rightfully—we shouldn’t consider, you being a Capsicle and all,” Tony began.
“Oh, thank God, it’s Bruce,” Tony said, covering his face with his hands for a moment.  “Bruce, it’s happening. Steve’s…” he waved his hand at the machine.
“Yeah, that happens,” Steve whispered, a thread of something raw in his voice that made it go tight.  Tony flinched at the sound, hating it, whatever it was, hating hearing that kind of pain from Steve.  It hurt Tony somehow, which made no sense, but there it was, souring his dinner in his stomach. “Good night, Tony.  Thanks for…well, just thanks.”
.’  Like that was what I was asking you about.  I mean, you tell me that you’re getting married and what you come up with about your future husband is that he’s agreeable to you traipsing off to war when it suits you?  That’s your standard?  You aren’t seriously expecting me to believe this is remotely what you want?”
“So,” she started in her familiar clipped, serious tone that usually meant she was going to tell him about dividends and quarterly earnings and probably use letters like SEC, and not mean the fun kind that involved guys in tight pants slapping each other on the ass.
“Together,” Tony replied.  “Ancient proverb,” Tony quipped, belying the joke by running a gentle hand through Steve’s hair, eyes narrowed and focused, the same look he got when he was figuring out something wonky with one of the suits.
Steve was watching him with dark, rounded eyes. He stretched, catlike, and reached out a hand, rubbing it over his torso where Tony had been warming him, then kicked the sticky sheet off and rolled over onto his stomach. Steve pushed himself up to his knees, bracing his arms on the mattress just below the headboard and let his head hang down between his shoulder blades. Well, you couldn’t really argue with that logic, Tony figured.
“Steve, skin cancer is cumulative,” Tony informed him with a knowing nod. “Here, I made a flashcard for you,” Tony replied proudly, holding up the laminated card.
When he closed them, he meant to think of his home, all that remained to be done to piece together a shattered people, his team, with the blank, dark space next to him where Bucky was meant to be, his mission, his oath, and the ravings of a madman before fire engulfed him and the sea claimed them both, but thought instead of the way the King had looked at him that first night, how the King’s voice tremored just slightly when he called Steve beautiful.
He was still buried inside Tony, and started to move, but Tony’s hands went tight on his back, holding him in place. “Not yet,” Tony whispered, then sealed the words with a kiss to the side of Steve’s head.  “Stay with me a little longer.”  Steve stilled, Tony’s words enough to bind his body back together somehow. He wasn’t sure how long he stayed there, feeling Tony’s fluttery kisses down his jaw and neck, over the curve of his shoulder, hands still stroking across Steve’s back.  When Steve finally pushed himself up on quavering arms and slipped out, separating them, it was Tony who sighed, hands gripping Steve’s upper arms, like he needed some way to maintain the connection.  Steve pressed a long, hard kiss to Tony’s forehead, then rolled to the side, exhausted, but not willing to let the moment go long enough to sleep.  He felt Tony turn into him, pressing his body flush with Steve’s, skin still damp with water and sweat, hair a wild array of dark curls.
“Oh, I like him!  Has a bit of a mouth on him, doesn’t he?  He’s going to be fun.  Did the King like you?  I’ll bet he did.  I’ll bet,” Hammer continued, pushing himself to a sitting position on the divan.  “I’ll bet Tony liked you a
“Yeah, but…” Tony trailed off helplessly.  It was weird, sure, but…but, what?  He had no idea.  “What?” Tony asked distractedly.  “Looks like a boot, what’s wrong with it?”
The limo ground to a halt, kicking up gravel and dry dirt beneath the tires, and Tony peered out the darkened window at the cabin. The light by the front door was on, probably zapping moths who couldn’t resist trying for something bright and beautiful.
“I did not roll around in pig shit, Kadina,” Nyma shot back after a moment of silence, sending a frown at the older woman.  “Why must you say these things in front of him?  We had a farm.  No
“They said he used you for his own gain, and you…” Steve trailed off, looking down at where his hands were slightly distorted as they moved through the water.
“Would it help if I rubbed it?” Tony asked, to which Steve responded by doubling over with laughter.  “Wow.  I honestly completely missed that one.  I was concerned.  Your hand and the cold and--dammit, Rogers, quit laughing!  I was trying to be thoughtful.  No, wait, don’t.  It’s a good look on you.”
“Use your words, Steven,” Tony admonished lightly, a teasing grin forming as he reached for the last onion ring.
His cock throbbed as he slipped his fingers out of his mouth.  He wanted to touch himself. Just a little. It wouldn’t take much and he could come.  A couple of strokes, that’s all, and he would be there.
“No, it isn’t,” Steve countered softly.  “I lost someone.  A—ah.  A buddy of mine,” Steve said, walking slowly towards where Tony stood just outside the front door.  “No.  Not a buddy.  He was…he was my best friend.”
Tony put the sleeping Peter carefully down in his crib, and followed Steve back to the bedroom to crawl back into bed.  Steve rolled over to wrap his arms around his husband, placing a light kiss on his forehead.
Which was how the Movie Education of Steve Rogers began, Tony thought a few weeks later as he pawed through the remaining DVDs in his collection that they hadn’t managed to watch just yet.  They mostly stuck to science fiction, fantasy and comedies.  War movies were out, after a disastrous attempt to watch Saving Private Ryan that ended with Steve getting up and walking out to the deck without so much as a word to Tony or a backwards glance almost as soon as Tom Hanks set foot on Omaha beach.
Steve brought one hand up and wrapped it around Tony’s wrist, then tipped his head down to where Tony’s hand curled into a fist around the dice.  Tony felt the barest brush of Steve’s lips over his knuckle, then a pulse of warm breath across his skin, and who knew the knuckles were erogenous zones?  Tony felt the hairs on the back of his neck bristle, his whole body seeming to contract, then loosen, almost too loose, like he was being liquefied part by part, admittedly, starting somewhere in his groin.  Steve was looking down at him through truly ungodly long lashes, and what had been a joke, because he could, because this was the kind of thing he did, teased and talked and made it a game because that way there was some distance, had become something else entirely, though damned if Tony knew exactly what.
“That’s good.  She’ll be glad to see you,” Bucky said. Actually, she probably wouldn’t even notice, but Steve didn’t say that, just grabbed his wallet and a baseball cap and headed out the door.
That didn’t…that couldn’t…it made no sense.  He watched Steve walk over and pick up the paper off the counter and settle into one of the kitchen chairs, immediately turning the pages to check the box scores.
?  The kids will be having a snowball fight?  Right.  Uh-huh. Steven Grant Rogers, did those words just come out of your mouth?”  Natasha demanded.
Tony was holding him fast, or Steve was sure he would have collapsed.  It was good. Everything was good.  Dreamlike, he thought, though he hadn’t had a dream like this in so long, he could scarcely remember it.  He watched Tony pull his collar down and draw his fingernail across his own neck, leaving a thin ribbon of red.
“I know you do,” Tony replied, voice going rough and thready.  “I just,” he sighed, almost defeated sounding, “I don’t know what to do with the
“Husband, actually,” Steve corrected quickly.  “I think I’m required to say that I’m the lucky one, but, turns out, it’s kind of true.”  That, at least, didn’t feel like a lie. Whatever this thing was with Tony, it was a stroke of luck that had been missing from his life for a long time.
‘See? I know you do,” Bruce smiled wanly.  “Now, stop trying to bait me, Tony, you know how I feel about all this.”
“Actually, it’s probably gamma ray bursts or strong nuclear, depending on how you define force,” Tony said with a self-deprecating sigh.  He swiveled his head to the side in enough time to see Jarvis swallow a smile and duck his head.  “But, I take your point.”
“You thanks too.  I mean, thanks.  You, too.  Look great,” Tony stammered, squeezing his eyes together in frustration.  Because, dear Lord, Steve did look good.  It was easy to forget that.  Or, not exactly forget, but not be so acutely aware of it.  Just one of those background facts that Tony filed away as true, but unimportant for daily living.  He was definitely noticing now, though.  Definitely very aware of it now, thanks so much, brain, good timing.  Helpful.  Obviously, this information and a vocabulary above that of Furby at the same time was too much to ask, but whatever.
Steve shuffled a few things around on the large conference table and beneath the t-shirts and kids’ bedding, there was a stack of mock-up posters, one for each Avenger.  Well, except for him, apparently.  There was no Captain America poster.  Steve frowned a bit, and was on the cusp of asking her why not, though a part of him hesitated because that seemed a tad egotistical, didn’t it?  But then he caught sight of the Iron Man poster and his frown deepened.  It was the suit.  Just the suit.  Glowing eyes, red and gold paint, repulors held up at the ready.  Gorgeous, and the artist had certainly done a good job, Steve had to admit.
“I didn’t ask for this, you know.  Any of it.   You show up and throw more papers at me--I was fine,” Steve insisted, voice shaking with the effort.  “I was doing just fine, and now you’re—just stop.  Whatever this is, guilt or reliving the past or—whatever you think you have to prove to yourself--just stop it.  I’m askin’, Tony.  This—you made your point okay?  I get it. You’re sorry.  You didn’t mean what happened.  Great. Fine.  This—this fantasy or whatever—whatever you’ve got built up in your head, you need to let it go.  We can’t go back.  We’re not those people anymore.  Or, I’m not, anyway.  You—you want something that can’t exist, not now, if it ever even did.  Just—enough, Tony.
“Steve, what the hell are you talking about?” Tony asked again. “Who said you had to leave? Howard?”
“Sometimes, it’s like I never left that cave.  Like I have to keep building this…this thing.  Like I can’t stop or—or something.  I don’t know.  If I stop now, I’ll never get out,” Tony rasped out, blinking, then squeezing his eyes shut, taking in a harsh, breath of air that scraped cold down his throat and into his chest.  “But, then, maybe I get out, and you’re not there, and that’s—all I could think about was getting back to you.
It was pointed, snappish and bristling with righteous anger, sending Tony mentally reeling from the force of it.   He knew Steve hadn’t meant it that way, but Tony caught himself tapping at the reactor in his chest anyway, like some kind of Freudian compulsion, and had to force his hand to his side.
But fuck it all, it had been an odd way for Steve to answer, that was the thing, Tony thought hours later as he stared at the blue schematic hovering in front of him. Granted, he’d probably caught Steve a bit off guard, considering Steve had still been spending himself inside Tony at the time, hips jerking with the last few erratic thrusts. He had terrible timing, but that was probably the only time he could have managed to get the words out, in the dark like that, the walls they both threw up around them crumbled enough for the other to scale, Steve buried so deep inside him he couldn’t tell where one ended and the other began, when Steve was the most his.
Rhodes just shrugged, though Steve had to admit, the other man had been good company on the ride back, though most of their conversations covered the safer topics of the recent mission and the changes to the city’s defenses that were already underway, carefully avoiding the other thing they held in common.
“Sure.  Why not?  Guy gets hurt over there, and now they want to keep him from getting medical care?  That’s bullshit.  Who’d he piss off, anyway?” Tony guessed.
. I’m not,” Tony insisted to the quiet garage, swiveling his chair around to face the bots.  “I’m really not.”
“It isn’t nonsense. He can do it.  I’m sorry if that thought terrifies you, but it’s Tony’s company.  I know he’d appreciate your support,” Steve said, not really meaning it, “But he doesn’t need it.”   He turned to head for the door.
“Your friend remains in cryosleep.  My doctors tell me his vitals are stable,” T’Challa told him, started to say something else, then hesitated, the air of dignified power he usually wore like a mantle slipping away for a moment.  “He dreams.  I hope they are…of good things.”
He just didn’t know why, when he tried to think about it—his plan, going back, leaving Tony to someone else--there was just this deep, gray maw of nothing swirling in his mind that made his stomach go cold and his throat tighten to the point it hurt to swallow.  So, he just…didn’t think of it.  Escape.  That was the mission.  The rest…the happiness, the joy, the relief at being back home, that would come once all this was behind him and he was home, where he belonged.
Tony sat the bottle back on the coffee table with a loud thump, the sound echoing through the darkened room too loudly in the quiet.  You needed quiet for this, he thought.  Noise somehow made this whole thing all the more pathetic.  He’d mentally agreed when he placed Pepper’s hand in Happy’s, the two of them beaming at each other, to give himself this night, one night.  Hell, not even—fuck, what time was it?  Not even a night.  A few hours.  Then he would go back to reminding himself that he was Tony Stark and none of this had ever mattered.
Steve nodded. “Yeah.  Call the concierge.”  He paused, taking another sip of coffee. “He’ll probably just enjoy being right and tell them to get rid of me.”
Steve could feel his face heating and eyes prickling, though he managed to nod.  What could he say?  Your dick’s just fine the way it is?  It’s a great dick, and I’m totally just thinking about how to draw it and not what it might feel like or…other things.  With a sigh and a flat grimace twisting his mouth, he picked up the pencil and started sketching light contour lines, peering around the edge of the canvas every few seconds as he drew.
“Ms. Everhart, if you’re looking for more quotes, this really isn’t the time,” Steve said, stepping between the woman and Tony.  “We said everything we intended to say at the press conference yesterday.”
“About dinner?  Yeah, I know I promised you white tablecloths, Sugarbear, but we’ve got to wait on Steve anyway, so,” Tony said with a shrug.  “I mean, unless there’s some reason we shouldn’t stay?” he continued, looking innocently between Rhodey and Natasha, who was watching him with a calculating look and probably poisoning his lo mein.
“My mouth does tend to have a mind of his own,” Tony agreed with a lascivious leer that probably worked better on whatever blue movie Tony must have seen it in.  “Eh,” Tony said, tossing up his hands in a gesture of surrender. “Sometimes, you just gotta take your shot.” Tony bit his lip, rolling it between his teeth and smiled wickedly up at Steve from under his lashes.
“Hmmm,” Steve responded, giving Tony a look.  “How far would SI be from something like that if you were part of the development team?”
Steve was standing by the garage at the edge of the driveway, silhouetted by one of the lantern lights that cast a flickering shadow over him.  He was facing away from Tony, hands shoved in his pockets.  For a second, Tony thought about the Tesla coil, sitting atop its pillar, waiting, radiating barely-contained power.
“That’s…no, that’s not what—do we need to go over where medicines come from again?” Bruce asked as he stood up from where he had stooped over a fallen log.  “This is,” he began, holding out a few thick, odd-shaped flowers in his palm for Tony to see, “this, Tony, this is where—why am I even…I know you know this.   You see how he likes to jest with me, don’t you?” Bruce asked, turning towards Steve, then back to Tony. “Why did you even invite me to come all the way down here?”
“Steve…” Tony began, with no idea how to end it.  There was so much pain in Steve’s voice, Tony could barely hear the words that were blanketing it.  “Don’t do this.  Please.  Please, just listen—“
He knew he should be dealing with this better.  He’d seen it before, after all.  Of course, that had led to a murder-bot with a God complex.  How that vision had ever frightened him seemed impossible to understand now, faced with the in living color version.  This was a thousand times worse.  That had been the end of the world, but this was the world falling apart, tearing at the seams, piece by piece.  That had been a fight.  This…this was a prayer, a plea coursing through his veins, asking something he didn’t believe in to intercede when he had nothing of any value to offer in trade.  It was the powerlessness of it, he realized, the utter helplessness, that left him reeling.  He held the only things he could offer that might help in his hands, the basest part of himself that had no business standing between Steve and death.
“Look at me, Steve,” Tony coaxed.  “Need to see you, Steve, need to see, please,” he pleaded.  Steve’s eyes snapped open and found his.  Tony eased his cock past the ring of muscle at Steve’s entrance, sliding in with little resistance.  He paused, breaching Steve halfway and reached up to grasp Steve’s hand, lacing their fingers together while the other hand splayed over Steve’s hip.
Steve stared at it for a long time, trying not to hope it would open again or there would be a knock.  Of course there wouldn’t.  Tony had done what he came to do.  Job was over.  Tomorrow night, maybe he’d do this for someone else, some traitorous, awful part of Steve’s mind suggested, and he felt his gut twist at the thought.
Steve huffed out an acknowledgement of the truth of that statement, then frowned. “Your strategy depends on the Ul assuming you are the kind of man that he is and willing to take the measures he would,” Steve began, “and if he knows you at all, he would know that isn’t true. You would never harm the boy in his father’s stead were he to break the peace, Tony, I know you wouldn’t. I would bet the Ul knows that, too, which is why I suspect he didn’t put up much more than a token argument to your suggestion.”
“Eh, no, none of that. Come on now, up with you,” the King said quickly.  “Well, not up.  More like, down, but over here.  I need you to reach—yes, there, can you feel in the gear?  There should be a small, interlocking cross-piece that is, rather determinedly, not interlocking.  I need you to push it through this opening here, see?  And then we’re going to add a bolt and mortis it into the side piece, like…this.  Good,” the King said.  “Excellent.  Hold it there.  Now…don’t move it,” the King said. He got down on his hands and knees next to Cam, and a moment later sprung up with a grin.  “Outstanding.  Good lad.  You did very well,” he said, patting Cam lightly on the back as he pushed himself up and walked back over to sit down at his work table.  “Eh, don’t go anywhere just yet, Small Hands.  Come over here.”
Tony forced himself to swallow, closed his eyes and let out a breath.  His cock throbbed almost painfully where it was trapped in the panties.  He opened his eyes.  Steve was standing completely still, one hand suspended out in front of him, almost like he had been raising it in greeting and someone hit the off button.  Tony pushed himself up onto his knees, the lace thong rubbing against the sensitive flesh as he did, turned his head and dipped his chin to touch his shoulder, looking up at Steve through the cover of his lashes.
Tony’s smile was soft, but his eyes were fierce and intent. “That is the only dream I have, and the only future I ask,” Tony whispered, clasping his hands on the sides of Steve’s face and bringing his lips to Steve’s forehead.
As he made his way down to Tony’s workshop, he felt his feet dragging more and more with each step. His heart felt like it was going to pound out of his chest and he was sure he was sweating more now than he had been sparring with Clint, though he probably shouldn’t say that to Clint.  He rolled his eyes at himself when he realized he was checking every Avengers signal as he walked through the Tower on the off chance a supervillain would save him from himself.
“You could at least open the door,” Steve called to the armor. It ignored him. “I could stub my toe. Drop the tray and injure myself. Trip. Really, any number of hazards could—okay, no!” Steve amended quickly as the armor raised a gauntleted hand and pointed it at the door. “You know, I think I’ve got it.”
“I’m sure,” Tony said, shoving his head under the pillow.  Steve did not, absolutely did not, pause to think how adorable that was.  Steve showered and dressed quickly, surprised to find Tony up and about, wrapped in a deep red silk robe and sitting at the kitchen bar tapping away at a tablet.  A quick glance told Steve it was his clean energy presentation for the Board.  Tony handed Steve a warm mug of coffee and pointed to a basket of muffins that had magically appeared, as most food seemed to do around Tony.
There wasn’t much of Peggy left here now, except the sketch and his memories.  He gave Angie most of Peggy’s things when she moved in with Willie, or William as Steve supposed he was supposed to call him now, since he was a man grown with his own family and not the wee, snot-nosed toddler clinging to his mother’s dress anymore.  Hard to believe that was so long ago.
“Okay.  Yeah.  That—that sounds good,” Tony replied.  “I’ll just be a minute,” Tony said, nodding towards the hallway.  Steve grunted an assent, watching Tony the whole time.  Whatever it was tightening Steve’s features sloughed off, as suddenly as it had appeared, and he leaned his forehead down against Tony’s and brought his hands to rest on Tony’s shoulders, grounding him somehow.  It always did.
When he couldn’t fit anymore, Tony grabbed a beer for himself, two forks, a wad of napkins and, somewhat defiantly, a couple packs of soy sauce, then went over and sat down by Steve.  He put the plate on the coffee table near his knee, and twisted the cap off the bottle of beer, holding it out to Steve.  Steve did the same, then clinked his Tony’s, lifting it a bit in salute.
Tony wasn’t sure why Steve’s words felt true, or truer, anyway, except that he trusted Steve in a way he wasn’t sure he had trusted anyone before.  Even Jarvis had owed some kind of allegiance to Howard, and that had always been a wall Tony couldn’t, or wouldn’t, try to climb.
“Noooooo,” Tony whined. Rhodey shot him a look, fingers hovering over the phone, sighed and set it down.
“If your heathen food choices are what tips the scale, I’ll buy out Smuckers,” Tony offered, the words coming out more shakily than he’d intended.  “I love you, too, you know.”
Tony frowned at the assemblage before him.  Steve was talking and gesturing, his arms spread wide.  Yinsen rushed over, stammering something about the cannon needing to be repaired and remounted.  Which it obviously did, seeing as how it was somehow arrayed in pieces, though Tony could tell just by looking that the repair could be done fairly simply and quickly.  Nothing truly vital had been damaged by whatever calamity caused the cannon to…suddenly decide to carefully fall into pieces.  He side-eyed his Alpha.
“I really didn’t,” Steve said.  He picked up a piece of bread and put it down on his breadplate, staring at it for a moment while he tried to remember if you were supposed to butter it all first or put a pat of butter on your plate and butter each bite, wishing all the while for an easier dilemma.  Like negotiating an armistice.
“Sorry, Shellhead.  It was only a joke, and not a very good one at that. Didn’t mean to offend.  Besides,” Steve paused, then smiled mischievously, “you’d probably taste terrible,” Steve said with a shrug.
“I—what?” Steve stammered, trying to get his mind to leave the fact that Tony was flirting with him behind long enough to catch up with whatever it was Tony was rambling on about.
,  not some actor. I know sometimes this whole life seems like some crazy fantasy, but it’s real, it’s my life, and, fuck, in some of those, I was barely legal, and—so yeah. Yeah, I get it.  Dehumanizing. That’s the fancy word for it, I guess. It’s treating people like shit, that’s what it is.”
“Good.  You may come if you can.  Or not, if you can’t. It is of no matter to me.  You may say your word, but that’s all. Otherwise, you will not speak until I speak to you. I can’t have you distracting me from my letters,” Tony said.
“Thanks for destroying my car, by the way,” Tony said after a beat, waiting until Steve turned away from the window to face him.  “That’s like Lloyd Dobler-boombox-outside-your-window levels of some crazy romantic bullshit.”  Tony grinned, a wide, shit-eating smile that broke into a low laugh, tinged with a little bit of leftover amazement.
.  Apart. Separate. Away.  Alone. The feeling, intense and cold, cut through the numbness in his mind, sharp, like a knife, then it was gone.
“How do you know what I’m thinking?” Steve asked, torn between intense curiosity, embarrassment and not a small amount of fear at the idea.
He could see himself, sauntering over, crawling into Steve’s lap.  He would brace his knees around Steve’s thighs.  Steve would flush that lovely shade of pink that Tony liked, maybe look up at Tony, eyes the dark, deep blue of stormclouds over the mountains.  Tony would lean down and kiss his way along Steve’s jaw until Steve’s arms wound their way up Tony’s back and pulled Tony’s mouth to his own.  The sun would beat down on Tony’s back, warming his skin through his t-shirt.  He could almost feel it.  He drew in a shaky breath and glanced back over at Steve, who was finishing his sandwich, wholly unaware that Tony was picturing mauling him.
“You said you wanted to watch it plummet off a cliff,” Steve said with a degree of nonchalance that Tony felt completely missed the moment.
“Okay, really?  That’s what you latched onto from all of that?”   Tony demanded somewhat incredulously, his head swiveling to the side to look at Steve while he rocked back and forth on his feet, the earlier tenseness Steve had noted replaced by a flurry of movement that seemed to touch every part of Tony’s body in some way.   “Not the whole Get Out of Marriage Free Card?  The tie is what you want to lead with?”
“Working on setting up a visit?  Tony Stark is working on setting up a visit?” Fury demanded incredulously.
Steve reached down and fingered a strand of the pearls and opals that dripped from the chain that circled his waist, then up to the golden collar at his throat with the large ruby that proclaimed him Tony’s.   He forgot, sometimes, that it was there.  The weight of it, the discomfort of something around his neck, the awareness of it, all that had faded at some point.  He wondered what it would be like to take a breath without it.  He wondered if he could.
“Asleep at your worktable on a bed of notes and designs, with a smudge of soot on your cheek and your hair askew,” Steve replied, smiling a half-smile back at  Tony.
“Good,” Steve said after a pause where it seemed neither of them breathed.  He looked over at Tony and caught his eye.  “That’s good, right?  What you wanted, I mean.”
“Be right there, Maria,” Howard called out, his gaze sharp on Tony.  “Whatever it is you’re thinking, don’t.  That’s your problem, Tony.  Always trying to figure something out instead of just letting those who know better handle things.  Well.  Not this time, do you hear me?  We can’t lose this chance.  I know you’re thinking you can make the Captain change his mind.  And yeah, you could do that,” Howard said, voice low, like they were conspiring, like this was, in any way that mattered, a group effort.  “But, and you listen to me, boy.  There is no outcome here where you skip merrily home and go back to your little “inventions,’” Howard sneered, the way he seemed to have to in order to get the word out whenever he applied it to Tony.  “Your books and those online courses you think I don’t know about.”
Steve’s whole body jumped and his eyes flew open, hands twisting reflexively in the sheet, and if he wasn’t carefu—yep, there went the sheets.  Tony smiled, keeping Steve’s nipple between his lips, jabbing his tongue out to lick lightly at the sensitive peak.
“There’s nothing to talk about,” Tony replied.  He fisted his hands on top of the workstation desk.  What was there to say?  He’d screwed up again.  They could just leave it at that, really. No need for rehashing and awkward recriminations.  “I just need to work.  Okay?  Can you just leave me alone and let me work?  Please?”
There was something about that sound, the desperation of it, maybe, the lack of self-consciousness, the wildness, he didn’t know, but it drew him back to plunder Tony’s mouth again.  His tongue pushed past Tony’s lips, delving deep, sliding along Tony’s, gliding over it, tasting him, this wonderful taste that was Tony, like ambrosia or fine wine, it left him almost dizzy with pleasure.  Tony moaned into Steve’s mouth, teeth scraping, nipping lightly at Steve’s bottom lip. It would be sore tomorrow. He’d feel that and know it was because of Tony. His mind seemed to revel in that idea, sending hot, sharp quakes of want down the length of his cock.
“Eh! Can you two please not,” Tony protested with a laugh, holding the phone at arm’s length.  “God, are you both twelve?  Insult him tonight over food and beer like a real man.”
“I'd love to meet them one day. If you wanted me to, but, I mean, not that you have to, I understand if you don't want me to—like when I draw something, I don't usually like to show it until its ready, and sometimes its never ready, so I completely—ah, I'm—are you okay?” Steve asked, smile fading to a concerned frown as his words slowed down because Tony had gone very still.
“Buck,” Steve cut in softly.  “Of course you were busy with everything, and that’s great.  You know I love Nat, and I’m so happy for both of you.  I’m not your responsibility.”
“Yeah, no. Not the paperwork,” Tony immediately corrected, then winced and shoved his hands in his pockets, twisting around a bit in place. None of his conversations with Steve ever seemed to go as planned. “I mean, yes, the paperwork—you know what? Can I—can I come in? I'd just as soon not have this conversation with Leaving Las Vegas next door listening in.”
Steve didn’t answer.  Cam was right.  Steve could barely focus on anything the boy was saying.  He wanted to apologize, but he wasn’t sure if he could.  If he opened his mouth, he thought he might scream in frustration.  Instead, he tightened his grip on the edge of the padded carriage seat and let out a hiss of breath, trying to focus on nothing else save breathing in and out.  Each movement of the carriage--any movement, really--carried a fresh wave of agony with it.  He was sure, if he looked down, his knuckles would be white where he held onto the seat, lest he curl over in on himself.
"Had to bypass Stark's AI, which regularly sweeps for recording devices, but that's a lot easier here than at his house or on his plane.  As two completely hypothetical examples," Natasha said.
“Guess you have job security for the other eight, then,” Tony said, wiping his mouth with the napkin.
How did he want to touch himself?  What did he like? He liked what Tony did, he supposed.  It was a good place to start, anyway. Experimentally, Steve ran a tremoring hand through his hair, tugging at it a bit.  That was nice. Like with his nipples, it wasn’t the same as when Tony did it. He didn’t think he did it as hard, and he liked Tony’s hands in his hair.  It always felt decadent, Tony’s hands, those amazing hands, doing nothing more than working through his hair. But, it was good.
“They put that on flashcards for you?” Tony asked with an abrasive, terrible sounding laugh that didn’t sound like anything was funny.
that he missed something in his design and (somewhat, slightly, maybe a tad bit) abrupt testing phase. Run before you can walk and all that.  In his defense, dying was a hell of a distraction. So, yeah, he could have missed something. A flaw. A slightly out-of-whack piece of equipment.  Some unknown he didn’t factor into his calculations.
A moment later, Tony’s hand was wrapped around Steve’s cock again, warm and slick with something this time. Some kind of oil, Steve thought distantly, feeling Tony’s hand glide up and down, wrist twisting around the head.  A few more strokes, harder and faster, the sound of flesh on flesh filling Steve’s ears.  Tony leaned down and mouthed at the heated skin there, catching on his Adam’s apple as it bobbed, sucking small circles of bruises on the flesh where Steve’s shoulder curved into his throat.
“I’m just saying, the guy’s totally into you.  Thought he was going to rip my arm off you and beat me with it.  He’s so wound up about this, it would be funny if it were anyone else but you.  I mean, sorry about that part, man,” Bucky shrugged, patting him slowly on the back with a cartoonishly apologetic expression on his face.  “Gotta give him some credit for sheer balls of steel to invite you over right in front of me though.  I mean, considering.  If I were banging you, I’d be highly offended,” Bucky said with mock grimness.  “He’s going to have the absolute fucking shittiest night though, the poor bastard,” Bucky laughed, grinning widely now, shaking his head back and forth.  “I, on the other hand, am going to sleep like a baby.”  He clapped Steve on the arm and headed upstairs, leaving Steve standing in the vestibule, feeling utterly flabbergasted by emotional up-and-down of the whole evening.
“They didn’t have any real evidence linking me to the Pentagon hack, anyway.  I’d run it through the MIT servers, so they were shooting blanks, but I’d gotten busted poking around old DoD files when I was eleven, trying to help Mulder find his aliens.  But, whatever.  They weren’t even that pissed.  Really, they just wanted to know how I’d done it,” Tony told him.  “Plus, Dad had good lawyers, and it wasn’t like they wanted to advertise some snot-nosed kid got past their firewall.”
“Stern wants the tech, true, but don’t think the Las Vegas PD or some hot-to-trot local FBI wouldn’t love to be the one to serve up Tony Stark’s head on a platter. You’ve got to be smart about this,” Matt urged. “Not your usual kind of smart, the one that goes off half-cocked and tries to catch a shark with a cane pole. Stern played you, Tony. They’ll try to get a warrant for whatever is on that drive that Batroc says he was trying to buy, at the very least.”
Tony finally pushed himself up to his knees when the wracking tremors stopped running through Steve’s body.  Steve looked at the mess on Tony’s stomach and thighs and felt an odd surge of pride.  He liked Tony like that, messy and dripping of him.  Tony caught his eye, then ran a finger through a streak of it and brought it to his lips to taste, tongue darting out to lick it from his finger.  Steve’s eyes widened.  He sucked in a breath and felt his toes curl into the coverlet, making the glittering bands on his feet clink lightly.
“I—yes?  I mean, yes, I want it.  If you do.  You don’t have to, Tony, really.  It’s okay if you don’t want to.  I love the way we usually make love—I do. Really, I love it. It’s—God, being with you is amazing.  It’s just…when we’re together like that, you just look so—so gone sometimes, and I thought, maybe.  Maybe it would be nice.  To feel like that,” Steve admitted, almost reluctantly, eyes shifting away from Tony.
“Who are you?” the King asked, eyeing him sharply.  “Not just a soldier, we already established that the other night. Soldiers don’t look at a table and just know how to reposition an entire network of defenses.  To hear Zola tell it, you deserted, got picked up by slavers while on the run and he saved you from a life of hard labor in the quarry or the mines.  All of my benefit, of course, glory to the realm and all that rot,” the King said, rubbing a finger across his lip as he studied Steve.
It means he thought about me.  While he was away.  He thought about me.   No, that wasn’t…that wasn’t quite it, Tony thought, giving the mug a frown.
“Just needed the right partner,” Steve responded after a beat in a deep, husky tone that went straight through Tony and coiled low in his belly, filling him with an impossible heat that left his mouth dry and heart pounding in his ears.  Tony dropped his gaze to just over Steve’s shoulder, where the canopy of stars spread out over the mountains.
“Tony…God, Tony…I,” Steve couldn’t form any logical thought beyond that, but hoped that got the point across.  He let his head loll back, body going boneless and just rode out the bliss. That was always good, of course, but that had been…tonight…jeez.  He didn’t know what to make of it.  He didn’t get much time to ponder as Tony shifted back between his thighs and pushed his legs apart, reaching down to cup his balls and gently rub, lifting them up and down.  Steve nearly came off the bed.
“After such an insistent entreaty to visit? How could I not?” Jarvis asked.  He put the French press down on the counter and went about opening various cabinets until he found a little used kettle, giving it a shake of his head before filling it with water and setting it on the stove to heat.
“I think I’ll sit this one out,” Tony replied with a slight shake of his head.  “You go right ahead.  I’ll just be up here, absolutely not silently mocking you.”  Steve ignored him and gathered a few cups and other items he could use, then trod out to the beach to begin construction. Fifteen minutes later, a shadow fell over where he was digging a round channel for the moat.
“The check?” Brock chuckled lowly.  “God, you’re cute when you’re all sleepy.  Wake up, bank opens in ten.”
“This,” Tony said, tracing his thumb through the fringe of gold that covered Steve’s face.  “This is meant to amuse me, yes?” Tony asked, eyes dancing with delight.  Steve felt his face warm, but couldn’t help the answering smile that formed under the veil and lit his own eyes, making Tony grin in return.
Steve started to object.  He wasn’t actually anywhere near the mountain, and he wasn’t planning on going up there, certainly not in the dark like this. He was just running.  Just trying to get away.  Anywhere that was away, not up the mountain. Why would he go there? That was ridiculous, he thought, then stopped himself, his mind grinding to a halt.  He wasn’t headed to the mountain on his wild run through the night.  Was he? Steve blinked, staring at the man with a frown.
“Do you need to come?” the King asked.  Steve nodded jerkily and choked on the breath he was trying to take in.  The King knelt down in front of him and put his hand over Steve’s where it was stroking his cock, then drew it off and wrapped his own around the weeping head of Steve’s shaft.   A low, throaty groan that was half sob tore from Steve’s lips.  “That…looks very uncomfortable for you.  Being hard like this, needing release, but not being able to find it,” the King said in a hushed, silky voice.  “How unfortunate something like that must be.”
“I can’t believe I didn’t do it sooner,” Tony retorted, grinning and curling his hand around Steve’s neck, fingers lightly trailing through the hairs there, sending tingling shivers down Steve’s spine. “I missed you.”
interested in that,” Stane retorted, leaning over and tapping the words out on the edge of the table with one long finger.  “I could help you. Give you a few pointers. Help you figure out what you might call a ‘safe bet.’ I
He said he would tell her and no one else, because what choice was there?   It took nearly two days to get through her questions, but she had finally believed him.  She’d let him go back to the lab, the one where he’d appeared, but the pieces of Howard’s machine made no more sense to him than they had decades from then, or months ago, depending on how you looked at it.  Oh, he remembered what the final machine was supposed to look like. He had gotten them that far, but the intricacies of it, the delicate connections of this wire here, that part there, he was as clueless as the rest of the SHIELD techs who kept looking from Steve’s drawing to the carefully laid out pieces, as if a spark of inspiration would come along if they stared at it long enough.
“On your super-secret mission I’m not supposed to know about? How will I even know where to find you?” Tony demanded with a frown.
“Think the King will let me go get sweets from the kitchen again?” Cam asked, bright-eyed now, voice eager, the cobwebs of their discussion wiped away in an instant by the thought of food.
“Well, he ought not be running off in the first place,” Howard added.  “You hear me?” he said, wagging a finger at Tony, who had stood up only to find himself scooped up into Jarvis’s arms, small hands holding the figure dangling down Jarvis’s back while he buried his head in the curve of Jarvis’s neck where his tweed coat met the collar while Steve’s mind conjured a golden glow, warm and enveloping, protecting them all even when there wasn’t much to be done.  “Is that still recording?  God, turn that thing off for Christ’s sake.  Peggy—”
“Steve!” Pepper shouted, nearly bumping into Tony as she practically flung herself into the room. “Oh, I mean Mr. Rogers. Or can I call you Steve now? I don’t know, this is all so sudden,” she ground out through clenched teeth, throwing a pointed look at Tony.
---we both love, and walk away out of some sacrificial bullshit you’ve drummed up in that head of yours, I can’t stop you.  But, do it now.  Do it right now, or give the man a chance.  A real chance, not this chase-me-to-the-bus-stop, playground nonsense,” Rhodey demanded.
Maria stared at her for a moment, then dropped her eyes to the floor and gave a jerky nod.  Stane curled his mouth, lifted his eyebrows high and nodded his acquiescence, as well.
“No, the other suits are trying to help. That one is a pillow away from going all Hall 9000,” Tony grumbled. Once the doors slid shut, Tony hit the button to take them to Bruce’s lab. “How are you feeling? Everything okay? I got the readouts from 30, of course. Your blood pressure was a little high this morning, so I had 21 make sure to elevate your feet—“
“He said The Palms, right?” Brock asked after taking a sip from his drink and smacking his lips together at the taste.
“You make me sound like some kind of Pollyanna. I was in the Army for eight years, you know,” Steve countered, shaking his head at the two of them.
“You do help.  Every day.  You help,” Steve replied, an unreadable expression on his face for a moment before it lapsed into Steve’s practiced smile.  “Just…keep being you.  Keep being happy.  Let me…” he stopped and cleared his throat, chin dipping down to his chest for a moment.  “Let me take care of you. There’s so much…sometimes, it gets to be too much.  Noise in my head.  Trying to make things fit.  Trying to make
His mouth went dry. All he could do was stare. It was obscenely beautiful in a way he could only begin to put into words. It was a nice ass. Very nice, Steve realized. Supple and plush, but firm. He’d always had an eye for that, even when he wasn’t supposed to be looking. He wanted to put his hands on it, then realized that he could. That was the whole point of this. He could do anything he wanted. This was here for him to use as he saw fit, and that was, apparently, what the man wanted. To be used like this.
Tony isn’t thrilled with being trussed up and delivered naked to the barbarian warlord storming through their country, but if it saves his people, he supposes it’s worth it.  At least their leader isn’t dreadful to look upon.  Younger than Tony expected for someone with such a reputation.  He doesn’t expect the man to take his cloak off his shoulders and shield Tony from the watchful eyes of Obie and his men and the other soliders, but he doesn’t flinch when the man touches his cheek.  Later, when the tent is cleared, and they are alone, he’s scared.  Ends up talking too much.  Not that the man he’s been given to as a bribe can understand him.  He doesn’t talk much, anyway, and Tony has no idea what he’s saying when he does, other than he seems to think Tony should eat more of the food he keeps piling in front of him.  Tony’s stomach is way too nervous for that, though he drinks the wine. He’s pretty sure it is from his father’s cellar.
“Miss me?” Tony asked with a jaunty wave.  Natasha and an African-American man he didn’t recognize flanked Barnes like angry terriers.  “Nat, Random Guy,” Tony acknowledged with a nod.
The door opened.  He was outside, blinking into the haze of the sun.  They dropped him on a stone bench by the door.  One of them cuffed the back of Steve’s head with a fist, making his vision swim.  Rumlow followed them out.  Frowned at Steve, then nodded at the wagon that rolled up in front of them, pulled by two mules, slathered in sweat and dirt and objecting loudly to the demands of the driver who tapped their backs with his whip from his seat.  The wagon carried two long trunks of whatever goods Steve’s new owner might have picked up at the port, a barrel of mead and three other slaves in long tunics chained together by a long line of metal that threaded through their collars and attached to a post on the back of the wagon.
“I could’ve taken that away from you that night, right then and there and the money?  Wouldn’t have been anything to me.  But I chose not to because I wanted you too badly.  If I could go back…I should’ve just demanded you tell me why that first night, taken you to dinner like a normal person, gotten your number…but no.  Couldn’t do that, could I, selfish bastard that I am.  You were so…bright.  And everything had been dark for so long.  I’d been out of that God-forsaken cave for two years, but that was the first time it had felt like it, and I wasn’t strong enough to do the right thing, even if it meant hurting you,” he finished harshly, self-loathing evident in his voice.
Many thanks, as always, to my beta, tastes-like-coconut for her input and help with this chapter.  She is also an amazing artist, so check her stuff out on tumblr.
Steve swallowed thickly, then cleared his throat.  He let go of the napkin and looked up at Tony, who was watching him with a sharp-eyed look. “Okay.”
“O—oh,” Tony said, the air suddenly punched out of his lungs.  Behind him, he heard the skid of a car and the slam of a door as bright, whirling colored lights flooded the street.   He grinned up at Steve.  “I knew I recognized that ass,” he said with a smirk.
“Yay!” Tony shouted gleefully, then signaled up to the jet. A door opened in the back and the armor headed for him. “Be right back, Snack-size, don’t go anywhere!”
“I’ll put the two of you down for a maybe for the dinner. It’s at the Bellagio. They offered to comp you the Presidential suite for the night if you showed.   You remember that one?” Pepper asked, without waiting for a reply. “Please don’t make them have to empty the fountain this time,” Pepper said, tapping something into her phone.  “Well, I should go work on the press conference.  Talk to Steve.  Seriously, Tony, talk to him.  Don’t get on a bus.”
“Tony Stark is…well, let’s just say he’s a huge get.  I know agency heads on six continents that would sell their own daughters to slavery to have Tony Stark on their client list.  They’ve dangled their best in front of him for years and he has never so much as nibbled.  But you…you show up and in one night, bam!  I’ve got Tony Stark calling
“Right,” Tony said after a beat, then sat back against the back of the car, the flurry of motion seeming to drain out of him.  “Right.  Of course.  That’s…yeah.  Good point. No reason to carry this thing too far, right?  High Roller, Happy,” he added, almost as an afterthought, slashing a hand through the air, then letting it drop to his thigh where he fisted both his hands, then splayed them out again, before reaching up to tap at his chest.  A habit.  Some kind of anxiety reflex.
“I’d always had something of a knack for getting myself in trouble.  Shooting my mouth off with nothing to back it up, trying to do these crazy stunts, giving my mom fits, I guess,” Steve began, speaking slowly, drawing Tony’s attention back to him.  “I don’t know, kid stuff, mostly.  Stupid. But…that time, for the first time, it didn’t feel like kid stuff.  It felt like I was making some kind of decision, sitting there watching the previews, with my pockets full of so many contraband snacks I think my pants shook when I walked.  I was suddenly going to do something, but…something that mattered.  Me.  Nothing-to-him-Steve-Rogers.  Even if I did get my ass kicked.  Because it was the right thing to do.  Crazy, I guess,” Steve said, running a hand around the back of his neck and looking away, like he was glancing down the Strip, but Tony thought he wasn’t seeing much of anything except maybe a darkened theater.
, Steve thought stupidly for a moment, tasting blood where the inside of his cheek had scraped his teeth and looking at Stane, both seemingly momentarily frozen by shock.  But Steve wasn’t blind to the shift of…something…behind Stane’s surprise.
He stepped out into the water, letting it wash the grit off his skin.  Spat out flecks of sand and swiped his tongue over his teeth, using the saltwater to rinse his mouth. There were streaks of dried fluids flaking across his skin in various places.  He decided not to think about what, exactly, those were and just washed off as best he could. His chest, neck and arms were dotted with small, circular marks, he noticed, now that he was up and in the sun, like the ones he found on his arm when he woke up here on the island.  Looking at them, he felt a tug deep inside the pit of his groin, not quite desire, but like an echo of it. He liked the marks. They made last night more real, in a way, which made an odd sort of sense. Steve felt somehow permanently altered, after all, like someone had remolded him from clay and fired him into something else, and the marks were talismans of that. Tangible proof that he was not as he had been before.
“They come to see you! The King’s Prize.  I think they were almost as excited to see you as they were the King. Everywhere, at Court, in the taverns and lodges, in the shops and down at the port, in the shacks down on the Low Road and in the merchant’s manses, everywhere, they talk of
At least, this happy pronouncement was what the doctor had cheerily assured him would happen during the exam his father had insisted on, when his ass was still sore and stinging from the coiling pressure of the metal speculum sliding inside and stretching him open, and he was desperately trying not to dig his fingers hard enough into the ridiculous paper covering beneath him to tear it.  That would have been some kind of admission that it had seemed important not to make while the doctor worked latex-covered fingers deep inside his gaping body so he could check off some box on a form that said Tony hadn’t been knotted.   There really was a form for everything.
