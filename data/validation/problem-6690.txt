“Oh.” Steve looked away, suddenly self-conscious. “While we were looking for you, I finally had the scales fall from my eyes.” When Bucky only made a questioning noise, Steve shrugged and ran a hand over the back of his neck. “I realized he wasn’t the man that I thought he was. He’s been kinder to me than I deserve, and has risked everything to find you.”
Tonight Steve and Tony had little appreciation for the bright light of the gibbous moon, which lit up the pale stone of the Vicomte de Chatellerault’s castle like a beacon in the night. It wasn’t a very large castle but it was built for war and well-maintained with a keep, towers in each corner and ramparts; the walls had high narrow windows for archers and the approach to the castle was clear of trees or underbrush that would hide someone’s approach.
“Before he was taken Grand Master Molay charged me with protecting the Temple’s relics.”  As they moved deeper into the keep, Steve could see that the order was in chaos; he overheard so many insane rumors – of the Grand Master himself being arrested, of Knights being pulled off their horses by angry mobs – that his head was spinning.  “I should have left immediately but I couldn’t let you get arrested.  Do you have someplace safe to go?”
“You’re going to be fine,” James said. “I’m sure Steve is racing hell for leather to get back to you so you can make the beast with two backs and live happily ever after.”
He was just about to ask Steve to take over driving when he felt the man’s hand on his arm. “Do you hear that?” Steve asked intently, staring ahead with his brow furrowed.
“Bucky?” He called out in confusion.  He stumbled out of bed and threw open his door, surprised to see that Bucky was fully dressed.  He glanced out the window but he hadn’t overslept, the sun wasn’t even up yet. “What-”
“You’re back! I take it you and James are finished hiding the true relics?” After examining the relics, they had all decided that the world wasn’t ready for objects of such power; the Templars had been right to keep them locked away from the hands of the greedy and power-hungry. But clearly having them in one place was too much of a temptation; even though the King and the Church were now squabbling over which relics were authentic and which were forgeries, the risk that someone would find about the
” he said. “This whole time, you’ve been poisoned? For God’s sake, Tony, why didn’t you say something?” His hands hovered like he wanted to grab Tony but didn't know where to put his hands.
Stark’s words knocked Steve off balance. “Because…” He started, his eyes involuntarily moving to the closed door of Stark’s bedroom. “Because you took an oath,” he managed. “An oath of chastity.”
As the neared Loudoun, Tony took the lead as Natasha fell back to watch their rear. They kept to the outskirts of the city until he came to a charming cottage surrounded by a garden so robust that it threatened to overtake the path to the front door.
“No one gets their hands on the real relics,” Tony explained. “So no one can use the powers that you say they have. And the first time someone tries to tout them to the public, the others will come forward as well, and then they will all argue about who has the real one and who has the forgeries.”
“You too, Steve.  Don’t do anything stupid until I get back,” he ordered, and then he was gone. The sound of battle was starting to ring out on the other side of the Castle, so Steve climbed onto his own horse and turned its head towards the servant’s entrance, forcing himself to not look back as he raced to Starks’ church, his horse’s hooves clattering on the cobblestones.  People were just starting to make their way out onto the streets as Steve reached the church.  He led his horse to his usual box in Stark’s stable, leaving the saddle on with a murmured apology and a pat on the nose until he knew for sure that Stark would offer him sanctuary.   For once, he couldn’t muster up too much disapproval at Stark’s penchant for taking lovers because the back hallways of the church were always deserted this early in the morning, the better to keep prying eyes from knowing too much about Stark’s barely secret affairs.
Steve paused with his food halfway to his mouth, then slowly lowered it. “Okay,” he said slowly. “Why?”
Steve waited for Tony to say more, to explain what Stane had wanted and why he’d been here, but Tony remained silent, staring at the fire. “Are you alright?” Steve ventured. "You seem..."
Almost a fortnight later, Tony was humming happily in his study at Notre Dame when Steve came in holding a message, frowning down at the paper in his hands. “Tony,” he started, and Tony looked up at him and smiled. Steve was still dusty from the road, wearing his armor and a surplice with Tony’s crest on it. Sunlight shone on his golden hair and beard, glinting off his mail, and he was so handsome that Tony’s heart hurt.
Dragging his hands from his aching erection felt like one of the hardest things he’d ever done, but somehow he managed, bringing them to his thighs and tightening them into fists against the urge to touch himself again. Stark was waiting expectantly, fingers drumming on the curve of his shoulder, so Steve struggled to say, “Thank you, Your Grace.”
Steve thought about that for a while, and finally said, “The chapter in Castile is strong and enjoys the support of their Queen. He and the relics would be safe there.”
have an- impossible,” he sputtered. “No child you sired while in the Church could possibly inherit.”
Steve didn't notice Tony standing there until he was pulling the man that he had tackled to the ground to his feet and dragged him over to his injured and unconscious friends. “You didn’t want to help?” Steve asked, a little breathless with exertion. His color was high and eyes bright from the thrill of the fight and Tony couldn't stop staring, stomach swooping and heart skipping a beat.
“Right,” James said, raising an eyebrow. Of course, they healed him with the grail as well; Tony barely recognized him without the bruising and swelling and the constant pain that had been drawing brackets around his mouth since they’d rescued him. “The way you told me and Steve what was going on because we were here and already in Stane’s path?”
“Well, we will give Sister Natasha some time to interrogate your new friend, and she’ll give me her suggestions, which I will imagine be to drug him into insensibility and spirit him out of the kingdom.” Stark turned and held up a bottle of wine, looking at Steve in inquiry. When Steve nodded he poured Steve a glass as well.  “On the next ship to Africa, perhaps.  Neatly solves the problem, whether he is truly a Templar or not.”  He handed Steve the glass and sat back down.  “What to do with you, however, is another story.”
Tony stared at Edwin’s hand over his own and swallowed thickly; Steve saw a flash of vulnerability in his eyes as they studied Edwin’s swollen knuckles and pale skin, spotted with age. “I, uh,” Tony cleared his throat to disguise the wobble in his voice. “Thank you,” he finally managed with a tired smile. “I appreciate that. But I can handle it.” With a satisfied nod, Edwin squeezed Tony's hand and and returned to his dinner.
“Really?” It took a force of will for Steve to keep his face blank and not look at Tony, to not let his voice betray his sudden worry. “Turn them in to who? Does the king have men stationed in Loudoun?”
That he and Tony would have come so close to the relics without knowing it beggared belief; what perverse hand of God brought Bucky and Hassam together, and then had him and Tony follow so close on Bucky’s heels? “How did you meet Bucky? Why would he trust you with the relics?”
“No.”  Well that was…better, Steve reflected.  It was surely better that Stark had regular employees that he occasionally asked to commit crimes instead of him secretly running a vast criminal enterprise out of a
“And the relics?” Bucky said after he downed half the cup. He was eyeing the food that the nurse had brought, so Steve set the cup down and picked up the plate.
“Perhaps, but I intend to give them back to their rightful owners,” Stark pointed out.  “If they can be located, of course.  I think your friend’s things are in there as well.”  They were, Steve saw as he dug deeper. Steve exhaled and his shoulders slumped as he ran his thumb over the cross of Bucky’s rosary, purchased at the same time as his own right before the disastrous battle at Belen Pass.
“I’m alive,” he said to his empty bedroom. He looked down at his hands and saw that his bones no longer pressed in sharp relief against his skin, and as he flexed his fingers the numbness was completely gone. He was also
When Stark was gone, leaving his candle behind, Steve sighed and knelt down on the packed dirt floor to pray for wisdom; maybe God would reveal to him why he could be civil around everyone else but was always an ass around Stark. “And please protect Bucky and keep him from danger,” he added. “If You could find it in Your wisdom to give me a hint as to where he is, that would be great too.”
When Tony opened his eyes, Steve must have seen his thoughts written on his face, because he just pressed one more kiss to Tony’s forehead and stood. “Please eat, Tony,” he said, and Tony nodded, vowing to try. “I’ll see you at dinner.”
“I cannot speak for the Muslims, of course, or the empires of the Orient, but much of our history has been a struggle between monarchs, who believe their power should only be checked by God himself, and the Church, which believes that their authority over matters divine should extend to earthly matters as well. Whenever one gets too strong, the result is almost always war. Lately, the Church has been ascendant and in its infinite wisdom,” Stark’s sarcasm was particularly heavy here, “it decided to embark on the Crusades.” Steve couldn’t even find it in himself to protest Stark’s opinion of the Crusades; during his time in the Holy Land, he’d found little Christian in the behavior of the Crusaders towards the native people. “Normally, we would have a period of peaceful balance, but King Phillip is trying to put the Church under his thumb. Without a strong Pope to keep him and the other monarchs in check, he will cast greedy eyes upon his neighbors. And having the artifacts under his control would only increase his power.”
Steve moaned, stifling the noise in his fist, and his hand moved faster. His skin was on fire, prickling with the need to be touched. In his mind, Tony murmured
Tony nodded, relieved. He pulled a note out of his pocket, sealed with a spot of gold wax and a thumbprint. “Go to Notre Dame in Paris and give this to a monk there named Brother Scott. He will give you further instructions.” He held out his hand. “Safe travels, and I hope we meet again soon.”
“No. If you sent them to Paris, we haven’t been in Paris for some time. But I’m sure they are safe,” he added hurriedly when Bucky’s eyes widened with alarm. "Tony has people he trusts who-"
After a moment, Steve shrugged. "Good question. Being able to sin as much as he wants without consequences?"
“We aren't,” Tony said firmly, so confident that Steve could almost believe him. Tony put a hand on Steve’s forearm and squeezed, and Steve felt his heart skip a beat. “You know, I admire your loyalty to your friend. It’s quite rare, in my experience. Something to be treasured.”
There was another chair next to the fireplace, so Steve pulled it a little closer and sat down. Now that he was closer, he could see that Tony’s hair was tousled and his eyes were dry but red, mouth tight in the corners. He was wearing the silks and satins of a nobleman, but right now they were wrinkled and askew. “And Stane? Is he still here?”
“They are looking for Templars at the gates,” Brother Peter said, sounding apologetic.   “Stark will contact you later.  For now, you can trust Thomas, he will get you outside of the city safely.”
Stark raised an eyebrow. “First, for the love of God please stop calling me Stark.  If nothing else, call me Tony, though you should get in the habit of referring to me as Brother Eduard so long as we are on this ill-considered mission. Second, virtuousness isn’t measured by misery, Rodgers. God doesn’t care if you sleep in comfort.”
Tony let his head fall back against the chair, too numbed by the loss of hope, thin though it had been, that Stane was going to let him live to feel anything but tired by Steve’s anger. “What would be the point? It wouldn’t have changed anything,” he said. “But the important thing is, it’s over. The ambitions of the King and Church are blunted so Europe is safe, for the time being, and Hydra will never have the real relics, whether they have mystical powers or not.”
“Look, Steve,” Bucky said, wiping his eating knife on his handkerchief and putting both back in his pocket.  “People aren’t perfect. We make mistakes and we sin, and God knew that.  That’s why in His wisdom he told us that we may confess and repent so that one mistake won’t doom our immortal souls forever.  Right?” Steve nodded reluctantly, unable to argue with his logic. “So lighten up already and get over it.”
“Not Paris, the Templars. The entire order is under attack,” Bucky said, voice grim.  “The King has turned against us, and scores of knights are being arrested all across the country.”
Steve bit back a frustrated roar. “Take me to the relics, and I’ll tell you,” he gritted out, and something of his urgency must have made an impression because Natasha finally nodded and gestured for him to follow. He followed her through the stone halls of Notre Dame, past the corridors he was familiar with and down through ones he wasn’t, until they were deep inside the bowels of the church.
“No, you don’t understand.” Bucky fell back against the sheets with exhaustion, eyes burning with intensity. “The relics are real. They have power.”
“Ready,” Natasha whispered down, then Tony’s weight was gone as well as he climbed up and into the window. Steve waited until he got a thumbs up from the window before he climbed up as well, rolling so he landed lightly in what turned out to be a sitting room.
“Blasphemy," Edwin said reprovingly, rapping the back of Tony's hand with the wooden ladle before spooning stew into bowls. "And what things?” Edwin asked. “Now would be a good time to tell us what’s going on.”
“Lord Stane,” Tony managed after a moment, hoping that his panic wasn't showing on his face, acutely aware of everyone's eyes on him. He couldn’t think of what to say; his thoughts spun crazily between
Stane raised his eyebrows as he circled Steve’s limp, bloody body.  “I’m impressed,” he said. “I didn’t think you had it in you.”
“You seemed to have it well in hand,” Tony said a beat too late, suddenly remembering that Steve was talking to him. "You didn't even need this," he added, handing him his sword.
Tony narrowed his eyes at Steve, studying his face. The question was sincere enough, but something about Steve’s tone made it seem like Tony’s inheritance was not what he was actually thinking about. “Of a sort. It will be held up in court for years while they search for another male in my family line, which buys me some time since they’re going to have to go to Italy to see if they can find someone on my mother’s side.”
“Horse. Shit,” Natasha said with emphasis, following him as he retreated. “Don’t you dare say it was for our own good.”
“Good.” Steve must have decided something, because he stood suddenly and went to the door, latching it. When he turned, the heat in his gaze took Tony’s breath away. "Like I said, I missed you."
With another dubious look, Natasha thankfully dropped the subject. Looking over the shoulder at the barn, she pulled Tony inside the farmhouse. “Did you know Lord Stane, Vicomte de Chatellerault,  has recently been paying his respects to King Phillipe?”
“He was getting there on his own.” James finished his bowl and set it aside. “I just helped him talk through some things.”
“Don’t you dare,” Tony said, gripping the arms of his chair tight and trying not to panic. Ana would easily recognize the signs of poison. “Do not bring them into this mess, it’s too dangerous.”
“We just have to get as far as Loudoun,” Tony said, petting Friday apologetically on the nose for pushing her so hard as he fed her an apple. “Then we’ll be on my father’s lands.”
"Well met, Brothers." Sam sheathed his scimitar as he eyed Tony and Steve warily, taking in their plain homespun robes and their high-quality swords. “Tell me, do all men of God in your country carry weapons?”
“Wait,” he said. His voice was tight with concern, but all he said as he climbed out of the wagon was, “I think I know who this is. Let me talk to them first.”
“It’s not like that,” Steve said softly. He kept his hand on Tony’s chest, feeling the beat of his heart, the rise and fall as he breathed. “’Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God,’” he quoted. He’d had a long time to think while waiting for Tony, and there had been a small, worn Bible next to Bucky’s bed in the infirmary. As it had grown too dark to read, Steve had decided that Bucky was right; listening the Church was not the only way to live a righteous life. Tony was silent for too long, and when Steve looked up at his face, he saw that Tony’s eyes looked anguished. “What?”
Tony started to speak and hesitated. “The people there will be loyal to the Duke of Anjou,” he said after a moment. “We will be able to find help there, and perhaps a wagon for us to transport him to my manor.” Steve thought with regret of the wagon that they’d left in Chatellerault, along with all of the belongings that they couldn’t carry with them. Their belongings were left in the care of the anonymous farmer who had let them use his farm and the wagon left as payment.
This time, Tony could feel James's eyes on him, and he refused to meet his gaze. “The grail will not refuse to heal you, Tony,” he said softly.
“Huh.” Tony lay back to stare at the ceiling. His breath was ragged and labored, whistling in and out of his lungs. “What if it doesn’t work all the time? For everybody?”
“Steve needs one of the relics,” Natasha said, and when Hassam turned to her he bowed respectfully. “The Iron Cardinal needs them.”
“You must have had an appointment with Sir Rodgers today,” Sister Virginia commented from the doorway shortly after Sir Rodgers had left.  As always, her habit and wimple were immaculately clean and pressed, somehow still crisp even though it was already past midday.
"Sister Natasha?" Tony said with surprise. After checking to make sure no one was lingering near his room, Tony leaned out the window and said, “You can come up now.” He stepped back and then offered her a hand as she climbed over the sill, straightening her wimple and shaking the dirt from her robes. “I'm surprised to see that you came yourself, I know you hate leaving Paris,” he said. "Anything wrong?"
“What was all that?” Steve asked as Tony sat down at the table where the serving maid had already set down bowls of stew for them both.
“Looks like I’m going to meet your Cardinal Stark,” Bucky said a few days later after matins. He held up a cream-colored piece of paper and Steve recognized the neat, sloping handwriting on it. “He’s holding a dinner and the Grand Master has charged me to go in his place as his trusted advisor.”
“So you eliminate them. Or rather, have the King eliminate them.” Natasha bit her lip and her eyebrows drew together in concentration. “Stane probably expected some sort of reward for his involvement – at the very least, he’d be able to talk his way into accessing the relics. But then Barnes runs off with them-”
“Complicated? What happened to make it complicated?” Natasha said, studying the look on Tony’s face. Then her eyes widened. “Did you two-”
Steve’s heart was pounding in sickening thuds in his chest as he raised his hand to knock, fear and excitement warring in his chest. It was always thus when he came to Stark’s door, ever since the first time, but tonight it was worse. Worse because he hoped that tonight a line would be crossed, a line that Steve dreaded to approach even as he longed to fling himself across it.
Tony took the candle while Steve knelt next to the man, shaking him gently to wake him up. The man’s head lolled, and Tony sucked in a breath at the purple bruises and dried blood there. Tony thought he’d been wearing dark rags, but as he moved closer he realized that Barnes' clothes were dark with blood and dirt, not dye, and his gaze traveled down to see that the man’s feet were dark and misshapen, clearly broken. There was no way Barnes was getting out of here under his own power.
“I found a bunch of Steve Rodgers.” She held up the candle to the iron gate that secured the dungeon, showing half a dozen men assembled inside, staring at them with baffled hope. They were all tall and broad-shouldered with blonde hair and blue eyes. In fact, they all would have easily matched a description of Steve to someone who had never seen Steve before. "What would you call them? A herd? A flock?"
Steve glanced over to where Cardinal Stark was explaining something to some visiting nobleman from the Kingdom of Arles, eyes bright and smile wide. “For one,
“No, Your Grace,” Steve admitted, raising his gaze to meet Stark’s eyes. He licked his lips and saw Stark’s eyes follow the movement of his tongue. “I confess to the sin of lust,” he said, feeling a little breathless.
“Of course! Stay as long as you need, you are always welcome.” Edwin patted Tony once on his shoulder. “Come on inside, you all look exhausted.”
“I’ll try,” he promised, kissing her on the cheek. “Now, is there anything I can help you with until Edwin gets back?”
“It’s just a lot to deal with right now,” Tony gestured at the papers on his desk. “Once I’m done, I’ll be able to sleep for a week and I’ll be back to my old self.”
made the tips of Steve’s ears go pink, even though he’d asked the same question almost every time they had the privacy for it. Steve seemed intent on making up for lost time by trying out every time of kiss he could think of, from chivalrous pecks on the cheek to deep, thorough kisses that left them both breathless. “Yes,” Tony said. He was trying to be strong, but he was too weak to deny himself this; not now, when he might not…Tony shook his head to dispel the thought before it could spoil the moment, because Steve was coming around the desk and Tony’s heart was already starting to race in anticipation.
Edwin reached across the table and put his hand on Tony’s, squeezing it. “Stay as long as you want. Whatever you need, my boy, we are here for you. You should know that by now.”
“I know, I know.” Tony sighed.  When Steve had first come to him, Tony hadn’t realized that King Phillip’s pronouncement against the Templars had been the opening skirmish in a war to exterminate the order instead of just another power play in the endless game of money and influence played by the Church, the nobles, and the king. By the time he’d realized the true extent of the King’s plans, the noose around Paris had already tightened.
“And why me?” Tony sighed and scrubbed his hands over his face.  “Hopefully next time he’ll stay awake for longer and tell us what in God's name he did with those blasted things.”
“You still carry yourself like a knight, Rodgers,” Stark said, voice gentling.  “You are known to the people of this church, to this neighborhood.  Their loyalty to me has been keeping you safe.”
“Perhaps that’s why they study the stars so much,” Tony said musingly. “You know, the Muslims come up with some very interesting tables about how to predict the movements of the stars through the sky, and how to use them to navigate. I imagine it will revolutionize map-making and navigation.”
“I don’t know.” Well, the obvious answer is that they were likely after the relics in Bucky’s care, unless Bucky made some persistent enemies while he was stationed in the Holy Land. But what did a group of assassins from the East want with Christian relics, and more bafflingly, how did they know that Bucky had them? “Sam, is there anything else you know about these people?”
” Steve snapped, then stopped himself when he saw Bucky smothering a grin. “Funny,” he grunted, taking a sip of his wine as his eyes were drawn to Stark before he forced them away again. “So what exactly did the Grandmaster want you to accomplish at this soiree?”
He held it there for a long moment as if savoring the wet heat of Steve’s mouth and then began to pull back. Steve pressed his tongue to the underside of Stark’s cock as he withdrew until the flare of the head tugged against Steve’s closed lips, then he had a moment to suck on the soft, smooth skin of the tip before Stark was sliding back in. “So good for me,” Stark said, voice low as his thumbs stroked Steve’s jaw. “But remember, when you’re inside these walls you take what your God gives you, no more and no less.”
“Are you ready?” Ana said from the doorway, snapping him out of his thoughts. “Lord Antoine is already in the cart.”
“Of course not, I would never have allowed it if I had known.  Which is probably why they went to such great lengths to keep it from me.” Steve could hear Stark’s fingers drumming on the wood of the desk and he lifted his head.
Steve stilled. “We would sometimes find this on the bodies of dead Templars,” he said grimly, and Sam nodded.
“Not until you.” Steve sat down on his straw mattress and leaned his back against the wall, trying not to stare at how the candle highlighted Stark’s strong jaw and made mysterious shadows of his eyes. “Why are you here?”
“It’s only blasphemy if it’s not true,” Bucky insisted. “But I swear, if you had those relics, you could heal me in less time than it takes to say Ave Maria. The Templars weren’t protecting these relics from the world, they were protecting the world from these relics.”
“Steve, you had enough to say about the man without knowing that he was running a secret empire of spies and criminals,” Bucky said. He tried to reach for the water but grimaced when the movement pulled at his wounds, so Steve held the cup to Bucky's mouth to drink. “Especially since I couldn't figure out his motives. I wanted to get the measure of the man myself before I even said anything to the Grand Master.”
The strange feeling lingered well into the next day, making Steve feel more pensive than usual. Tony, if he noticed, didn’t seem to mind; he happily chatted about whatever came to mind given the landscape they were passing. Fields of grapes remind him of a new invention called a wine press that was going to revolutionize wine making; he was apparently helping vineyards invest in the machine for a portion of their future profits. When they stopped to feed and water the horse, he described a new type of well developed in Artois that would bring water up from the ground without pumping, and as they stopped by a monastery to sell them a cask of mead, he explained how an abbey on the Isle of Reichenau had built a way of heating that worked from under the floor.
By the time he got back to the inn, the shame had faded to resignation. He’d done enough Hail Mary’s for his sins on the walk back to satisfy the most exacting confessor. It wasn’t until he was outside the inn that he realized now he was going to have to face a well-pleasured Tony and sleep in the bed the man had just fornicated in. With a sigh, he dipped his hands in the cold water of the horse trough outside and rinsed off his sweat and washed his hands.
"I never knew my father," Steve said when he realized Tony wasn't going to say anything. "He left for the Crusades before I was born and died in battle."
For two days Steve rarely left his sparsely appointed room, leaving only when necessary and even taking his meals alone.  Part of it was fear of discovery, but it was more that he felt raw and sensitive, and speaking with people just seemed to add more salt to his wounds. Fear and worry had him jumping at every sound, kept him awake at night and made him pace the walls. At the end of the second day, Brother Peter knocked on his door and said that Cardinal Stark was inviting him to dinner.  Steve’s first instinct was to decline, but then he realized that Stark might have new information so after a moment of hesitation he followed Brother Peter to Stark’s quarters.
“I don’t know if he can go on like this much longer,” Steve said. Bucky was fiery hot against his back, making him sweat, and Steve could feel and hear every flinch and moan of pain as the ride jostled his injuries.
“People know that I will pay good money to someone who can tell me something I don’t know. The more interesting or useful it is, the more I pay. I’ve bought many a traveling minstrel a new instrument for bringing me news from outside of France.”
easily, as I’m sure you’ve thought in the past.” He nodded his head towards the corner of the room, where Steve suddenly noticed the bed that dominated that side of the room, an enormous wooden four-poster with heavy curtains. Steve swallowed thickly, trying to reign in an imagination that was trying to show him all the things that could be done in a bed like that, and turned his gaze back to Tony’s.
“Can I help you with anything?” He asked, carefully tidying a stack of papers. “You know, I still have a good hand with the pen from when I was training to be an illuminator."
“I’m sorry, Steve, but I can’t tell you that,” Bucky said. He put a hand on the back of Steve’s neck and pulled him into a fierce hug. “If the worst happens, I can’t risk anyone knowing where I’m taking the Temple’s relics.”
“Tony, it’s good to see you,” Stane said with the easy geniality of a man who knows he’s holding the winning hand. He eyed Tony as he made his way into the study and leaned with a sigh of relief against his desk. “You don’t look so good, are you ill?” He asked, voice solicitous.
“Just the usual, Edwin,” Tony said ruefully. “We are also in need of concealment. Can we stay here until he’s stable enough that I can take him to the manor?”
“You’re right,” Steve said finally. “But I don’t like it. You need to take better care of yourself.”
“You mean my life or the relics?” Tony gritted out. “Of course we have a deal.” He held out his hand for the pill but Stane put it back in the bag instead.
Tony looked at him, puzzled. "Why go anywhere?" He looked around the tavern, which was starting to fill up with people and the buzz of conversation. "If you stay here and make conversation you might learn something about your friend, you never know."
The man hesitated for a moment, clearly weighing the risks, before he scooted closer to be heard over the crowd. “It’s not much. A week ago I was called up to the castle to do some work, but they wouldn’t say what it was until I got there. They had emptied out one of the cellars and wanted me to put in a pair of bolts and rings in the wall, then reinforce the door with better hinges and a stronger latch.”
“Who would think to search a Muslim for a bunch of Christian artifacts? It’s not like he’s going to steal them,” Natasha said over her shoulder as she pushed the door open with a loud squeal from the hinges.
Steve understood what Tony was saying, he really did. He’d been the one to counsel hot-headed youths fresh to war of the value of patience, of knowing when to strike to double the chance of success. But never before had Bucky been in danger without Steve by his side, and he found that he couldn’t find any of his former wisdom right now. “How long will it take us to get there?”
Then he’d taken one look at the man and gotten irrationally angry at him and that feeling hadn’t really stopped since. On their walk back to the Templar Keep, Bucky must have guessed the turn of his thoughts because before they went their separate ways he said, “Let it go, Steve. Just do your job and leave the rest to God.”
Bucky’s raised his eyebrows for a moment and then he shook his head. “And let me guess, you shoved them under your bed and never wore them?”
Tony nodded thoughtfully and folded the piece of paper, setting it on the tray next to the empty plates. “I agree that the relics need to be protected,” he said. “But that doesn’t solve the immediate problem of people trying to kill us to get their hands on them. None of them will rest until they are located.”
“I hardly think he’d invite the liaison to the Grand Master if he’d invited the Grand Master himself,” Steve pointed out.
Tony studied Stane thoughtfully over the rim of his wine glass as he took another sip. “And what if I told you I had an heir?”
“Sometime in the morning, Stane will be coming here, and he’s going to ask for the relics. I’m going to tell him what we agreed. But I’m going to need you in there,” Tony said. “And we’re going to have to make you look as bad as Bucky did when we first got him out. Stane won’t believe me unless he thinks I tortured this information out of you.”
“Don’t get all worked up about it,” Stark said, waving a hand dismissively. “I was just wondering.” Steve gratefully fell silent, trying to smother the guilty memories of dreams he’d had about Bucky when he was younger. “And it’s not a game,” Stark added. “Or rather, it
in sharing the pleasures of the flesh too freely. In my opinion the world could do with a little more of that.”
“He’ll be fine,” Ana whispered as she handed him a blanket and a pillow. He tucked both around Bucky, both to keep him comfortable and to hide the bandages so they wouldn’t draw attention.  He went back inside to get the last of the supplies, mostly food and water, and tripped over his own feet when he saw Tony. Tony had shed his coarse brown monk’s robes and was wearing only his braes, and Steve's mouth went dry as he watched the lean muscles of Tony’s back move under his smooth, dusky skin as he pulled on the black robes of a priest instead. Tony smoothed out the robes so they fell in straight lines to the floor and adjusted the collar. As he turned around Steve realized he had shaved, the scruffy, half-grown beard of the past few days having been tamed into a sleek goatee.
“Please,” Steve finally gasped out, pressing his hips back in a desperate attempt to get more than that teasing touch.
“Very well.” With an internal sigh, Steve sat down across from Stark, sitting so stiffly his spine didn’t even touch the back of the chair.  He took the paper Stark handed him and started skimming the financial calculations written out in a cramped but elegant hand.
“Clearly he needs someone to keep him out of trouble,” Sister Natasha said. “If he says something to the wrong person this will all be for naught.”
,” he said, making it clear that he didn’t believe such a person existed but was willing to pretend as much, “recognized so that he may inherit, but there’s something you must do for me in return.”
When he came into the room, he was surprised and, though he would never admit it to himself, a bit disappointed to see Tony fully dressed and sitting at the writing desk bent over a stack of papers instead of lounging in bed, tousled and sleepy. The shutters were closed, but there was no smell of sex in the air, so they must have been opened earlier; Steve felt an unwelcome wave of heat crawl down his back at the idea that they’d left the shutters open while they fucked, letting their moans echo in the night air for anyone to hear.
Steve pressed an ear to the door but couldn’t hear any voices on the other side. He knocked lightly and heard muttered “what?” in response. Warily, Steve opened the door quietly and was relieved to find that Tony was inside, and he was alone. “Tony?”
“It would probably be best if we told everyone that he was touring his estates but then they both travel in disguise,” Sister Natasha said, clearing her throat as their inappropriate giggling fit had died away.  “Between Captain Rhodes, Sister Virginia, and me, we should be able to keep your little empire running in your absence.”
Stark’s insouciance towards the whole affair was making Steve angry.  “We should do something,” he said, pushing his plate away, the food on it mostly uneaten.
. “Sanctificetur nomen tuum,” he said loudly, trying to drown out his thoughts, but he still heard Tony’s voice purring in his ears -
Tony smiled at the memory. "It's not a story I can tell on my own," he said. "You'll have to wait until we are with Sister Natasha and Sister Virginia." Steve was silent for just a moment too long, giving Tony enough time to realize what he'd said and curse himself.
After a moment, Stark slowly pulled out and Steve let go of his legs, letting his crimson robes fall back into place. Now that Stark was finished the ache of his own arousal hit him anew like a punch in the stomach, and he clenched his hands in Stark’s robes to keep from touching himself.
“The Pope issued a papal bull calling for all European monarchs to arrest Templars in their kingdoms and seize their assets,” Stark said, sounding apologetic. “If that’s where he went, he’s not safe.” Steve cursed and put his face in his hands, resting his elbows on his knees as he fought his temper. He wasted
“I understand. Be safe,” he said hoarsely, stepping back as Bucky’s horse sidled under his weight.  There was no one on this Earth more important to him; they had been raised together, joined the order together, went to war together, and now he was leaving Steve behind for a mysterious mission.  Going, for the first time, somewhere that Steve wasn’t allowed to follow.
“Take off your sword and set it to the side.” There was only the barest hesitation as Steve obeyed, unbuckling the heavy belt that held the sword and sheath at his waist. He set it down on the long, low couch that lined the wall. “And your surcoat and mail,” Tony added. The only sound in the room was the soft chiming of the chain mail as Steve lifted it over his head; now he was down to his gambeson, emphasizing the breadth of his shoulders and trim waist. “Do you not feel lighter already? Now you are no longer a soldier, merely a penitent in search of absolution. You may continue.”
“Poison,” he said. “Stane has poisoned him, and there’s no antidote. I need the grail, and I pray that it works as Bucky says it does.”
“You were expecting me?” Tony said with a frown. The bad feeling grew, turning into a rock in the pit of his stomach.
Steve held his breath as Tony studied him. “’All my youth, I have loved, often,’” Tony recited softly after a long moment. “’Long loved and keenly yearned, and it hast cost me dearly.’”
“Natasha says she’s done with the first set of forgeries,” Tony said. “With one set done, the rest should be faster and easier to make.” Tony’s network had been scrambling to lay the groundwork for the discoveries; the harder the agents of the king, church, and Hydra worked to find the relics, the more convinced they would be that theirs were the real ones and the others were fakes. If the stakes were different Tony would actually be amused at the thought of agents racing across France following an increasingly obscure set of clues until they found the carefully hidden but not
“What?” Tony said from the doorway, holding a bowl of Ana’s bone broth. “What do you mean he doesn’t know where the relics are?”
“Well?” Tony said after they had been studying the castle for a while. “Got any ideas?” This was clearly going to be one of the hardest parts because they risked being spotted by sharp-eyed night watchman and would be vulnerable to archer fire.
Sure enough, after the monastery had gone quiet and still, when the light of the full moon was drawing squares of silver on the floor and crickets and frogs were singing their nightly chorus, there was a gentle rap on Steve’s door. As Steve stood to open it, he realized his heart was racing and his palms were sweaty; over the past few hours, Steve had realized that the difference was that now Stark seemed approachable in a way he had not before, almost like he was a completely different person. In his richly furnished rooms with his cardinal’s robes and the small army of people at his beck and call, he’d seemed out of Steve’s reach. Now, however, he was just another fellow monk as he stepped into Steve’s cell with one small candle to light his way.
One day, though, it was raining heavily, too heavily to work outside, and Steve was left alone with his thoughts.  He tried to read a philosophical text from the church library, but it couldn’t hold his interest; for some reason the sound of the drumming rain was making him restless rather than soothing him.  He paced around the church like a nervous cat until he saw that the monks were starting to give him funny looks every time he passed by, so he forced himself to sit and repeated the Lord’s Prayer until the words jumbled together in his head and became a nonsensical string of gibberish. Eventually, with a sigh, he started to stand, planning to do exercises in his room until the restlessness eased, until he was brought up short by a hand on his arm.
Steve frowned slightly as he thought about it, and eventually said, “I’m not sure, but I think I know what you mean.” As Tony turned his gaze back to the fire, Steve thought about everything Tony had ever said about his father, which was, admittedly, not much. “Do you want to tell me about him?”
, too, which was a feeling he hadn’t had for far too long. He swung his legs over the side of the bed and stood, waiting for the dizziness to come but it never did. He was staring at his feet, contemplating actually jumping for joy, when the door to his room swung open.
Tony opened his mouth to protest, but he knew Edwin was right. He did, however, pull some money from his purse and press it into Edwin’s hand. “Go ahead and buy anything else you think you’ll need,” he said. “I don’t want you to worry about having three extra mouths to feed.”
“Dear God,” Steve whispered, feeling sick to his stomach as he realized how foolish he’d been. “If the King sent him here to look for me…”
“No, Steve, this is bigger than that, bigger than your life or even mine.” He sighed and scrubbed his hands over his face, clearly gathering his thoughts. “Look, it would not be overstating things to say that the fate of all Christendom lies on your friend keeping those artifacts out of the King’s hands.”
“Well, they were certainly calling out His name a lot.”  Steve was turned away, but he could hear the smug grin in Stark’s voice, could well imagine the way the man’s mouth would curl at the corners and his whiskey-brown eyes would grow darker.  Not for the first time he wished that Grand Master Molay had made someone else the liaison with Paris’s Cardinal Stark; every time he came here Stark’s impiety seemed worse than the last.
"That's just it, though. The Stark family is rich as Croesus. And unless Stark is disowned or walks away from his position, all of that money is going to the Church when his father dies."  Steve frowned, and Bucky noticed the expression as they crossed a patch of bright moonlight. "Odd, right? If he's not in the Church because of a religious calling, which from your experience he definitely isn't, then what does the Church give him that being a spoiled son of a rich nobleman does not?"
“Who is Sister Natasha?” Steve asked, recognizing the name, as Stark returned and sat down across the desk.
“Come in.” He sat up straight and tried to look alert as Steve came in, carrying a tray of food. Though the smell of the food made him nauseous, under Steve’s concerned eyes he forced himself to reach for the bread and tear off a bite. Steve sat and looked at the piles of paper on Tony’s desk with sympathy.
"I guess I'll have to lay low for a little while," Tony said ruefully. He looked down at his hands, opening and closing them. "I mean, I feel even better than when I got sick. I'll close up the house here and go back to Paris. It will be easier to hide there than here, and we will just tell everyone to say I'm still sick."
“We’re getting you out of here, Buck,” Steve said grimly, and put the iron crow against the rings holding the shackles to the wall. Tony stooped to calm Barnes while Steve snarled with effort above him, knuckles white on the pry bar until the ring finally snapped and Barnes’s hands dropped to the floor. He cried out with pain at the movement and Steve flinched.
“Buck? Stay still,” Steve said, throwing off the blanket as got up. “You’re injured, you don’t need to be moving.”
Suddenly there was a sharp smack and a flare of pain on his ass that made Steve’s breath hitch. “You take what your God gives you,” Stark reminded him, and Steve swallowed back a whimper.
“My immortal soul appreciates all your hard work,” Tony said dryly.  When the space was clean, he gestured for her to sit in the chair across from his desk.
“Enough, Tony." It was already going to be hard enough to sleep in this bed while trying not to think about what Tony had just done in it, he didn’t need his teasing on top of it.
“He should drink from it, obviously,” Natasha said brusquely, hip checking him to the side. She grabbed a pitcher of water from next to the basin Tony used to wash his hands and took the grail from Steve. “Hold him up.”
“Yes,” Steve whispered, and then there was another crack followed by a white-hot flare of pain. Steve’s breath caught on a cry, more from surprise than pain, and his cock pulsed, his braes growing damp.
"I'll send for Thomas," Natasha said. "I assume all three of you are going?" Steve met Tony's eyes and smiled, then they both nodded. James just shrugged. "I'll take care of it." She turned to leave and paused, then took a step back and grabbed James's arm, eyeing Steve and Tony. "You're going to probably want to come with me."
Sure, it could mean that your old pal Bucky ran across this poor Templar fleeing for his life and sent him to you to help. If your friend is an
He didn’t realize he was frowning until Brother Thibault leaned over and said, “Are you feeling well, Brother Grant?”
“Are you sure?” Stane suddenly leaned forward, gaze intent. “Because we have reason to believe that he may have asked for your assistance leaving Paris when the King dissolved the Templars.”
“Cast your gaze heavenward and give thanks,” Stark murmured in his ear, breath hot on his neck as his fingers curled around Steve’s cock and stroked him, fast and rough. He put his other hand around Steve’s throat, squeezing lightly; between his legs Steve could feel the filthy wetness where Stark’s spend was seeping out of him, and all of this became a dizzying whirl of sensation as he strained for his release. “God inspires all holy desires and brings them to fulfillment.”
“Lord, protect those who seek your help,” Stark grunted as his thrusts grew erratic. “They desire to be strengthened by your blessing and consecration. Oh, God,
“This goes to Captain Rhodes,” Stark said, folding up one sheet and sealing it. “And this one to Sister Natasha.  The King has apparently moved against the Knights Templar, and I am very displeased to find out that I am the last to know about it.”
“Oh,” Tony said with a soft huff of amusement. “No, I don't have a child. A mere bastard child would not have been sufficiently scandalous to force a first-born son into the church, if you take my meaning. I go to the orphanage because I like to spend time with the children there.”
“Hell yes, I’m angry! We – the Templars, I mean, but also you and I – served the Church faithfully and then one day it destroys us, calling us heretics and scattering us to the four winds, torturing us and burning us at the stake, and why?
“Do you actually expect me to believe that?”  Steve had to pace away before he committed violence on church grounds, unable to look at Stark sitting there unrepentant.
Steve barely heard what Stark was saying because the look in Stark’s heavy-lidded eyes was setting him on fire from the inside out. Steve saw his own hunger reflected there, banked and controlled, and suddenly felt light-headed with want. “Yes, Your Grace,” he managed, and Stark nodded approvingly.
But Steve only stared as if seeing Bucky for the first time. “I never thought about it like that,” he said instead. As a young squire, he’d been sparring with the other knights in training one sweaty afternoon and had come away from that session with an embarrassing erection that had only gone away when he’d found a private place to touch himself to thoughts of hard bodies pressed against his own. The next Sunday, the pastor’s sermon had thundered against deviant desires and Steve had felt like the pastor had been speaking directly to him, like God had seen his thoughts and was warning him away from a path of sin. He still remembered sitting in the pew with the sick feeling of fear and shame turning his guts to water as he listened to the pastor.
“Forbidden, yes,” he said slowly. “Or if it is because they do not do anything without this man’s permission.”
“And through me, his servant, the Lord may consecrate the resolution you have formed in your heart.” He released his grip on Steve’s hair and took a step back. Steve’s gaze fell down Stark’s body where his fine robes did little to conceal his arousal. Steve felt a thrill at that, at the evidence that Stark took as much pleasure in this as he did, and longed for the weight of that arousal on his tongue again. “But first, if you truly wish to give yourself fully, your body should be as bare as your soul. There are no secrets from God.”
“Isn’t this place cozy,” he said as he glanced around Steve’s cell, making Steve smile faintly. “How’ve you been?”
“You know, it’s not a bad idea for you to get out of town for a while, too,” Sister Natasha pointed out. “You could go south as well.”
After a moment of studying Bucky’s swollen and discolored features as he slept, Steve turned so he could sit on the floor and lean against the bed, resting his head close to Bucky’s. Behind him, he could hear Bucky’s deep and even breathing, glad that he no longer sounded like he was in pain. “I’ve missed you so much,” he confessed softly. “I’ve screwed things up so much without you." Bucky had always been good about keeping Steve from making too big of an ass of himself and saw things much more clearly than Steve himself could. Steve scrubbed his hands over his face, exhaustion suddenly a weight on his shoulders. "Though, in all fairness, I didn’t get captured by a madman and tortured, so it looks like you’re not doing so well without me either. From now on, we're in this together, you hear me?” In the quiet of the room, he bowed his head to pray and didn’t realize that he had fallen asleep until he was startled awake sometime later by the sound of someone making noise above him. He sat up swiftly when he realized that it was Bucky waking up and trying to move.
“It was the relic,” Steve said, smiling faintly when Tony made a face. “Bucky was right. The grail, at least, can perform miracles. It healed you and Bucky both.”
“What do you have here, anyway?” Tony said as he thumped the barrel behind his back. “Mead? Ale? Wine?”
“The power of life or death,” Bucky said, and if Bucky hadn’t sounded so afraid Steve would have thought Bucky was trying to pull one over on him. “One is a cup that gives life, another is a spearhead that takes it away. One relic, Jesus’s knife from the Last Supper, creates many things from one and another, the sudarium, gives a weak and weary man the vigor of a stallion. There is also a crown of thorns that makes the wearer unable to tell a lie.”
“Are you injured?” Steve asked the stranger, turning away. Tony blinked and shook himself, then went to stand guard over the captives, still dazed by his sudden very real desire to kiss Steve senseless.
“No, nothing like that. Well, sort of.” Bucky sighed at let his head fall back against the headboard. “I had researched the relics when we first came to Paris, out of curiosity. The Templar’s records described the powers of the artifacts and even had signed testimonials attesting to their power, but I didn’t believe them, not really. But when I fled the city, they weren’t wrapped very tightly and one fell out of its wrappings when I stopped to camp. This one,” he said, pointing to the picture of a spearhead. “When I went to pick it up, the plants around it were withered and dead. I took off my shirt and used it to pick the relic up, and touched it against a small sapling.” He looked up to meet Tony’s eyes. “The leaves dried up and fell off the branches as I watched. In seconds, the whole thing was dead. That's when I realized that the legends were true. So the next time I went to town, I bought the stoutest box I could find and locked that evil thing away.”
Steve swallowed. He felt lightheaded and realized that his breath was coming fast and shallow, so he inhaled deeply, breathing in the scent of burning candles and the more exotic perfume that always lingered on Stark’s robes, reminding Steve of his time in the Holy Land. Steve often fantasized of stripping Stark and finding the source of that perfume but had yet to have the courage. He lifted his hand, which was trembling with the force of his arousal the way it never did on the battlefield, and made the sign of the cross. “I confess to the sin of pride.”
“Good night,” Steve said automatically, but stared at the sky for a long time before falling asleep.
Tony leaned forward as well, eyes steady on Stane's, refusing to be cowed. “If your information was any good, you would know that Sir Steve Rogers despises me. Given the number of times he’s told me I’m going to Hell, I doubt he would come to me for help.”
"I doubt Barnes would still be alive if Stane had the relics, so we're just going to have to hope they are safe until Barnes can tell us where they are," Tony said shortly. He didn't have to put a hand on Barnes's head to know he was out of his mind with a fever, probably from infection. He turned to leave and was brought up short when Natasha appeared in the doorway.
Steve pressed his fingers to his eyes before his traitorous brain could start imagining anything. “You know we had a meeting scheduled today,” he said tightly. He heard the bell ring for the quarter hour and said, “For fifteen minutes ago.”
Steve made a noise of agreement at that, stirring his bowl idly. Pieces of fruit would emerge briefly before sinking back into the porridge, and to Steve’s tired mind it seemed like a good metaphor for Tony, how Steve could get glimpses of the person he was beneath all the masks before he disappeared again. He desperately wanted to get to know Tony, to understand him, but he felt the chance to slipping from his fingers; once at Chateau d’Angers, Tony would become Lord Stark, farther from Steve’s reach than even Cardinal Stark was. And what help could he offer Tony to find the relics, other than caring for Bucky until he could wake up and tell them where they were? Steve sighed and pushed the thoughts away, setting himself to eating though he had little appetite. He finished his bowl of porridge as quickly as possible and stood. “I’ll take him breakfast so it doesn’t get cold,” he offered, refilling his bowl for Tony.
Steve’s throat closed and he let out a shuddering breath.  That was Bucky, alright.  He started to chide the man for taking the risk of coming up to a stranger with so little description to guide him, but when he looked around he realized sheepishly that he was easily the largest man in the cathedral and that he was also the only man with yellow hair.  “Right,” he said. “Come with me.”  They stayed there for a few more moments, during which Steve sent up a quick prayer for guidance, then he led the man to his room.  “Stay here,” he ordered.  “I’ll return shortly.”
“You must not have gotten very far into the collection then. Not all of those books are, shall we say, church-sanctioned.” Tony wrapped up the rest of the bread and stood, brushing crumbs off his robe. He started to climb into the wagon but when he saw Steve staring at him, aghast, he laughed. “I’m joking,” he said. “Even I’m not that much of a reprobate. Novitiates have access to that library.” Relieved, Steve took the last bite of bread and was just about to swallow when Tony flashed him a wicked grin and said, “I keep
“Oh,” Steve said when he realized what Tony was trying to say. Suddenly the exchange of money made sense; he must have been negotiating for... He put his fork and knife down, appetite gone. “Ok, that’s fine, I’ll just…I can bunk down in the stable –"
“Steve recognized it from the Holy Land, and we ran across a fellow traveler who knew what it meant. They call themselves the Hydra and apparently they are a bunch of fanatical assassins from Baghdad. They think that they can become gods through magic or prayer or something.” Tony ran his thumb over the impression, mind racing. “Maybe they think the relics can give them power.”
After the disastrous dinner, Steve started avoiding Stark; judging from the lack of invitations to share meals, Stark was more than happy to let him.  Then one day Brother Peter showed up at his door and gestured for Steve to follow him to the stables, where he handed Steve a shovel. From that day forward, dressed in his simple novitiate robes, Steve fell into a routine of work and prayer that kept his mind too busy and body too tired to dwell on his problems; the one time he summoned the nerve to ask about it, Brother Peter said that Cardinal Stark was working on it and would keep Steve informed as he saw fit, which Steve took as a rebuke and a suggestion to not ask again. So he scrubbed dishes in the kitchen, stacked firewood, shoveled coal, tended to the sick and performed whatever other chores they found for him to do quickly and without protest, hoping all the while that he’d be too tired at the end of the day for the nightmares to come.
“Right.” Against his will, Tony found his eyes starting to close; exhaustion suddenly hit him like a wave, the weariness tugging on his bones. “Wake me up when he gets back, will you? I want to see this miracle for myself.”
Stark must have caught them looking because he held up the utensil as if surprised by their curiosity, pretending to be unaware that the whole table was staring. “This is a fork,” he explained, and there were low murmurs of interest from the table. “My mother’s family is from Italy, and a distant cousin sent it to me. Isn’t it interesting?” Someone asked a question about it, drawing Stark’s attention away, and Steve rolled his eyes and turned his attention back to his food.
Steve thought about the Cardinal of Paris and the Duke d’Anjou and the Iron Cardinal and about lying and hiding and suddenly wondered how often Tony got to be just
“To attain the dignity of being the bride of Christ you must give yourself entirely over in service of the Church,” Stark said, his words heavy with meaning as they tightened on the curve of Steve’s hips. Steve felt a hand disappear for a moment and then Stark was sliding a slick finger from Steve’s tail bone all the way down to his balls, making his hole clench at the touch. The touch was repeated, then again, and with each pass Stark’s finger lingered longer and applied more pressure, coming close but not quite breaching the ring of muscle.
“We do it tonight, right?” Steve said, leaning forward. “It’s not going to get any easier if we wait.”
“Have you decided where we will go?" Steve stroked the horse's jaw to have something to do with his hands. "Ana mentioned Chateau d’Angers, but that’s where your father is, right?”
They pushed the horses as hard as they dared, riding through the night until the sun crested the trees. Steve stayed on his horse’s back the whole time, even as they rested and watered them, because he was afraid that if he got Bucky off the horse he wouldn’t be able to get him back on it again.
Tony stared at the door for a long time in shock, blinking rapidly as his mind raced. What in the hell did he mean,
” Steve muttered, and followed Bucky out of the restaurant. Steve well remembered the meeting he’d had with the Grand Master regarding Cardinal Stark.
“You…” Steve said, staring helplessly.  The black fabric made Tony’s features seem downright saturnine, with his warm brown eyes and dark hair. The goatee framed Tony’s mobile mouth, which was right now turned downward in a frown, making him seem stern in a way that made an entirely inappropriate thrill go up Steve’s spine. Apparently, it didn’t matter what Tony wore - the rich raiment of a Cardinal, the homespun robes of a monk, or now, the black cassock of a priest - he had the power to drive Steve out of his wits.
It was another couple of days before Tony got the message that everything was in place, and by then he was so weak that his hands shook as he unrolled the tiny scroll that had been fastened to a pigeon's leg. It had been nine days since his meeting with Stane and Tony was barely holding it together. At this point, only his force of will was keeping him going, sending him staggering from bed to desk every day as he used every weapon in his arsenal to foil Stane’s plans.
“Ask for the one about the King’s mistress,” she said, raising her voice to be heard over Tony’s protests. “That one’s my favorite.”
Natasha nodded and knelt on the bed as she took Tony by the jaw and tilted his head back to pour the water from the grail into his mouth, tipping it slowly so he wouldn’t choke. It felt like it took an agonizingly long time to get the contents of the small cup into him, sip by sip, having to start over every time the water spilled out of Tony’s slack mouth, but eventually the grail was empty. Steve set him gently back against the bed, and they all held their breath as they watched him for any sign of improvement.
There was a long silence, and then Tony made a shocked sound when something hit him on the arm. Looking down, he saw that James had thrown a dinner roll at him. “I understand now what Steve sees in you,” James said, rolling his eyes. “You are both
Tony’s throat closed up at the sincerity in Steve’s voice and the warmth in his eyes. His words were failing him, so the only response Tony could think to make was to rise up and press his lips to Steve’s. Steve made a muffled sound of surprise, and then with a groan from deep in his chest he wrapped an arm around Tony’s back and pulled him close. “God, Tony I was so scared,” Steve murmured against Tony’s mouth, voice wrecked. His kisses were hungry and desperate, and Tony’s morning had the potential to get a lot more interesting if two things hadn’t happened: one, his stomach rumbled with an almost embarrassing loudness, reminding him that it had been some time since he’d eaten, and two, they both heard Natasha and James’s voices coming down the hallway. As the sound of their conversation grew louder, Steve released Tony with a flattering reluctance, pressing one last kiss to his mouth.
"I missed you too," Tony said. Playing least in sight for the past two weeks had been impossibly dull, he was very ready to make a miraculous recovery from his extended illness.
“I could help you,” Stane said finally, to Tony’s surprise. “I may not be a duke, but I am not without my influence at court.”
Tony made a face; that should have occurred to him, too. He’d played in Stane’s dungeon often as a child while his father and Lord Stane had business meetings in his study two floors above. “So what did you find?”
The stranger jumped when Steve dragged up an empty chair sat down next to him, eyes darting around the tavern nervously. Natasha snapped her fingers to get his attention again. “We already promised you protection against Lord Stane,” she reminded him. “Now you have to tell us what you know.”
“He’s breathing easier,” Natasha finally said with relief, shoulders slumping. She reached over and smoothed a hand over Tony’s hair, growing out again from where he’d cut it short all those days ago.
“But a bunch of people kept insisting that he was real. Then it seemed like I saw evidence of him everywhere. But I don’t think anyone would have guessed that the Iron Cardinal was an actual Cardinal - rumor was that he was called that because his clothes were constantly red from the blood of his enemies.”
Steve grunted. "He wouldn't be the first broke son of a nobleman to make his riches in the church," he said, keeping one hand on his pommel and a wary eye on the dark alleys as they passed even though lately the Captain of the City Guard had done an admiral job suppressing robbers and thieves.
Steve inhaled sharply. “Oh, Tony, I’m sorry.” Tony only shrugged and silence fell, broken only by the sounds of the fire. As Tony took another swallow of wine, Steve suddenly realized that this was the first time he’d ever seen Tony actually drunk; he’d seen him often enough with a glass of wine in his hand, but much less so actually drinking from it. “How are you doing?” he finally ventured. “I know the news about your father must be…” Steve didn’t know how to finish his thought. His father had died when he was young, and his mother had been ill for a while before she passed; Tony’s father’s death had been sudden, and they had apparently been estranged for a long time. He couldn’t imagine what Tony was feeling right now.
He dropped the message on the desk and wished he felt happier about this; mostly he just wondered if he was going to live long enough to see Stane pay for his crimes. With a sigh he wrote a message for Stane then reached for the bell and rang for a servant. He gave the footman instructions to have the message sent immediately to the Vicomte then asked the servant to send Steve up to his study. While he waited, he levered himself to his feet and shuffled over to the mirror, grimacing at how gaunt he looked. Grateful it was night, Tony poked the fire to make the flames die down and blew out some candles so Steve wouldn’t fuss at his appearance. He got himself settled comfortably in his chair, pillows at his back, and called for Steve to come in when he knocked.
“Nothing certain yet,” Stark said. “A few sightings, but he’s always moved on by the time my people get there.”
and saw the sinful curve of his mouth. Saw his hands, with their long clever fingers and narrow palms, stroking over smooth skin; imagined the way the long, lean muscles of Tony’s back would move as he-
“Sir Rodgers!” Stark said with every appearance of pleased surprise. “I did not realize you were acquainted with Sir Barnes.”
“The sun’s been up for hours,” Steve snapped. “Is he ill, that he is still abed?”  He lifted his fist to bang on the door but was brought up short when it swung open before he could knock.  A woman was on the other side, hair clearly hastily brushed and tied back, face still slightly flushed from exertion. Steve noticed that her blouse was improperly buttoned and jerked his eyes away, gritting his teeth as he felt his face go red.  Already infuriated at being made to wait, he felt his anger irrationally tick higher.
“You said that I should come to you when this was all done,” Steve said softly. “I’m here, and I want you more than ever.”
“Brother Grant!” Steve wiped an arm over his brow and lowered the axe as Brother Thibault waved to him from across the field. “It’s time for dinner. We have a special visitor, if you wish to wash up.”
“Why would you say that?”  Tony started shifting some paperwork to make room for her to sit for their weekly meeting.
Steve kept going until he was in his braes, torso bared in the slight chill of Tony’s chambers. Tony’s hands tightened on the arm of his chair against the need to touch the miles of warm skin and muscle.
With effort, Steve forced his thoughts away from the ball of rage in his chest and tried to think. “He has an uncle with a farm outside of Chatellerault,” he said. “I think that’s where his family is from.”
Natasha sighed. “Sister Virginia said you were pretty oblivious to certain matters, but now I have to wonder if you are being deliberately obtuse.”
“A calling card. I am surprised to find that symbol here, though. If their reach has spread this far, that is very concerning. They thrive on chaos; they spread it wherever they go like the wake of a ship.”
In answer, Steve pulled the grail out of the bag that had been thrown over his shoulder, unwrapping it carefully from the silk as he let the bag fall to the floor. “Now what do I do?” he asked, turning it over in his hands. It was hard to believe this plain, simple peasant’s cup could have the powers Bucky said it did.
“No! No. Look, I don’t want to talk about it,” Tony said shortly. “What’s this news you have? You said you knew where Barnes was.”
“Sorry, Tony,” Stane said over his shoulder as he stepped over Steve’s body to reach the door. “There never really was an antidote. Not that I’d give it to you, anyway. You are far too much of a pain in my ass to keep around. Hope you took this time to get your affairs in order.”
“I want to help find him,” Steve suddenly, not even realizing what he was going to say until the words came out of his mouth. Stark stilled, and even in the dim light of the candle and the moon Steve could see the look of disbelief on his face. “I'm not going to let you keep shuffling me around the country until I know what’s happened to him.”
“What’s this?” Tony forced himself to say lightly, tapping the seal. “I don’t recognize that as being one of yours.”
Steve had never ridden this hard for so long in his life, not even in the desperate dash to get Bucky to safety. His world narrowed to the rhythm of the horse’s hooves, the hypnotic rush of its breathing, the beaten dirt road framed by its ears. His back and thighs ached, hands blistering from the reins; each time he switched horses, it was harder and harder to get back on as his muscles protested the abuse. But every time he sat down for a moment as he changed horses, when he accepted food and water that was pressed into his hands at each stop, he saw Tony’s face, its waxy paleness and sunken cheeks, and was driven back to his feet.
He thought about the man who had stars in his eyes and talked excitedly about windmills and realized anew just how much he had hurt him with his thoughtless accusation of perfidy. “You’re a good man, Tony,” he said softly.
“So do we,” Tony said, gesturing to Barnes. “He can’t ride by himself like this. I’m not even sure he can sit on a horse.”
Steve snorted. “Next time you decide to be a hermit in search of religious revelations, don’t pick a dungeon.”
“It’s been a trying time for you,” Stark said with a short nod, but despite Steve’s apology his originally welcoming mood had clearly cooled.  When he started to serve himself Steve hesitated and followed suit, finding an appetite for the first time in days as the tantalizing smells of wine-braised chicken and fresh bread reached his nose.  They ate in silence for a few minutes, then Stark took a sip of wine and cleared his throat.  “I believe these are yours,” Stark said, using his foot to nudge a box tucked under the table closer to Steve. Glancing down, Steve recognized the belongings that he’d been forced to leave behind as he fled the Templar keep.
“Tony,” Steve said, and the note in his voice made Tony look up from the rest of Natasha’s notes, trying to find another mention of the men wearing this symbol. “Are these men-” He stopped suddenly, casting a furtive glance at Sam. “Er, going to be a problem?” he finished after a moment. He gave Tony a significant look, and Tony barely stopped himself from rolling his eyes at Steve’s obviousness, since Sam was glancing between them with interest and listening intently.
“What else can I do?” Tony said, letting himself lean on Steve for the moment as they left the study and started heading towards Tony’s rooms. “I don’t know the poison, so I can’t take an antidote. I’ve already tried all the ones that I knew of and nothing worked. As you’ve pointed out, I’m getting weaker and weaker. I’m losing feeling in my hands; it’s getting harder and harder to hold things. I’m sure the numbness will spread, and eventually my heart will just…” Tony gestured. “Stop. Or maybe my breathing, but I hope it’s my heart first, less painful that way.” He glanced up at Steve’s stony expression, then glanced away again. “You should take James and go. You should be safe now, and I don’t want you hanging around and making faces like
“St. Mary’s Children’s Home,” he read aloud.  He stared at the plaque as if it would reveal the reason why Stark was visiting but suddenly had a vision of the door opening again and Stark discovering that he’d been followed, so he turned on his heel and made his way back to the water.  He found a place to sit in the grass and idly sketched the river scene, but his thoughts kept going back to Stark and the orphanage.  The only thing he could imagine was that Stark had an illegitimate child that he couldn’t acknowledge because of his position in the church; the fact that the child was at an orphanage instead of with its mother hinted at some sort of scandal or tragedy. Stark must have loved the mother deeply, for him to take the time to visit the child in person and risk discovery.
“And you had sinful thoughts about this man?” Stark asked, leaning over to speak right into Steve’s ear, his voice husky and breath hot on Steve’s skin. He was standing so close Steve could feel the brush of his robes against his bared skin.
“Who is Stane?” Steve suddenly said from the doorway, making Tony jump. The look on his face was grim and his hands were curled into fists at his sides. “And where do I find him?”
Tony wondered. Given everything, Tony had a hard time believing that Stane’s presence here was only about getting his hands on the duchy. “Is that why you were meeting with my father?” Tony asked idly, taking a sip of wine and then cradling the glass carelessly in his fingers. “Trying to get me disinherited?”
Early the next morning, as the city was just starting to stir, Brother Peter knocked on Steve’s door and handed him a monk’s hooded robes to change into, then led him through the church to where a wagon was waiting outside.  There was a man already sitting behind the sleepy draft horse and the bed of the wagon was filled with chests, presumably themselves full of goods to be sold outside the city.  Steve started to climb into the seat beside the driver, but the driver shook his head and jumped down. He fidgeted with something on the side of the wagon, and then a panel fell away, revealing a secret compartment below the driver’s seat.
“So you didn’t know?” Steve slumped forward in relief, burying his head in his hands.  That had been plaguing him his whole ride; if he’d been wrong about Stark, he could have been riding right into a trap.
“When he wakes, he’ll need something to build his strength back up. The best thing is bone broth so someone needs to go to the butcher and get soup bones,” Ana said without pausing her examinations. The grim set to her mouth was worrisome.  “The sooner the better, because they’ll need to boil for some time.”
relics was too great. So Natasha, Steve, James, and Hassam agreed to leave Paris and spread them far and wide: one was on its way back to the Holy Land, one was buried in an anonymous orchard in Moorish Spain, one hidden in a fortress off the coast of Scotland and one buried deep in the foundations of Notre Dame herself.
“But if it is the Hydra, then it is everyone’s fight,” Sam said stubbornly. “If they are here, then they will be in my new home soon, if they are not already.”
“Go in slow, get out fast,” Steve said. “Even grass is more cover than we had in the desert.” While waiting for the late hours of the night, they’d bought lighter colored cloaks and Steve showed them how to use dirt and ash to make the cloaks mottled enough to confuse the eye at a distance. They hid the horses as close as they dared then started making their way across the open expanse agonizingly slowly, hearts pounding as they jumped at every noise, expecting to be discovered any minute. But there was no outcry, and eventually they were able to take cover in the shadowed lee of one of the towers. “Ok, now what?” Steve whispered, craning his neck up to look at the window far above their heads. “Throw the grappling hook?”
“Well, yes,” the footman said, stepping back to let Tony inside. As soon as he set foot over the threshold, Tony noticed the yards of black cloth shrouding the mirrors inside the front hall. Blinking rapidly, stunned, Tony’s eyes fell to the black armband fastened to the sleeve of the footman’s uniform, then flew up to meet the footman’s eyes. “We sent a messenger yesterday to Paris, my lord. As soon as it happened.”
Stark rubbed his fingers over his eyes.  “I’ll figure this out,” he said, sounding like he was trying to convince himself as much as Steve.  “For now, just go back to your room.  I would suggest you gather your things in case you have to leave quickly.”
Bucky raised an eyebrow, eyeing him critically. “Sounds like you finally figured out that you want him so badly you can’t think straight.”
“No, I don’t.” Steve raked his fingers through his hair and sat down for just a moment before he was up again, pacing. “I’m worried that he’s in danger. That we all are.” His armor and sword were carefully hidden in the cart they’d borrowed from Anna and Edwin, but that had likely been taken to the stables and the attendants had already told them they weren’t allowed out of the room on Lord Stark’s orders. Escape was out of the question without Tony, and Steve knew that if he tried to barge in and save him there was a strong chance he would mess up some intricate plan Tony had in motion. As much as it pained him, their only option was to stay put and try not to attract any attention.
“During this meeting, no matter what you hear in there,” Tony said urgently, willing Steve to understand how important this was, “
“Don’t look at me like that, Rodgers,” Stark said. “I’m not going to abandon you to the wolves. I just mean that you aren’t safe here anymore.”  He took a pensive drink of wine, eyes far away.  “I guess we could always put you on a ship to Africa as well,” he mused.
“And miss my chance to sleep in a bed?” Tony said lightly, flashing Steve a grin. “Seriously, though, I think we could both stand to have some hot food and a good rest.”
Steve nodded without looking up from his food, trying not to think about what Tony meant by ‘prepare.’ Bucky had often teased him for how little time he spent with women, particularly women of easy or negotiable virtue, but he’d seen them in the market and lounging in doors with their kohled eyes and rouged lips. His traitorous thoughts flashed an image of Tony looking up at someone through darkened lashes and kohl-rimmed eyes and he realized his hands were shaking. “I’m finished,” he said, pushing his trencher away. He thought about returning to their room to gather his sketchbook and pencils, but realized he was in no state to sit still and concentrate. Instead he cleaned off his knife and fork and tucked them into his belt. "I'll go...walk, I guess."
And Steve would go, taking off his clothes and letting Tony pull him into bed.  Tony would press him back against the sheets, hands roaming over his chest, skimming his shoulders, gripping the back of his neck with one hand while the other slid down Steve's stomach and up his thighs, teasing.
“Steve!” Weeks later, Steve was suddenly jerked from sleep by the frantic banging on his door. “Steve!”
Steve took a deep breath and let it out slowly, staring out of the narrow window of the infirmary over the castle’s vegetable garden. It had been over an hour since they’d arrived and he still hadn’t seen or heard from Tony, and he was starting to get the uneasy feeling that something was wrong. A maid with a black band around her upper arm had brought food some time ago and scurried away without answering any of Steve’s questions, and now he was sorely tempted to go looking for answers. But instead he stayed at Bucky’s side, knowing that the first question Tony would have when he saw him again would be about the relics.
“Is that what this symbol represents? A cult? One of the other sources in Paris said it was the symbol of a secret organization.”
When Steve came in from the stable, he saw Tony in a dark corner of the tavern speaking to the innkeeper. As he watched, Tony pulled something out of his pocket that gleamed briefly of gold before it disappeared again. After seeing it, the innkeeper nodded and leaned in close as he spoke, clearly trying to keep someone from overhearing what he was saying. Tony’s eyebrows drew together in concentration and he nodded periodically as he listened. When the innkeeper finally pulled back, Tony shook his hand and passed over a coin, which disappeared into the innkeeper’s pockets. Then to Steve’s surprise, they spoke again for another few minutes and money changed hands again before Tony finally made his way through the crowded room over to where Steve was sitting.
“We're doing fine,” Tony said absently, tapping a sheet of paper against his lips as he thought. “So it seems like Steve might be right about Barnes going to Chatellerault, then, if he was seen passing through Tours?”
Tony, of course, was the one who realized what he meant first. “You’re talking about forgeries,” he breathed, face lighting up as he picked up the piece of paper to look at the pictures of the relics again. “Of course! I could kiss you, that’s brilliant.”
“Not directly. But someone carved that symbol,” Sam gestured to Steve’s book with his chin, “into the wood of my family’s home in Baghdad. I told my family we shouldn’t let them drive us from our home with vague threats, but my father and his brothers would hear none of it. That is why we are now in al-Andalus, rubbing elbows with unbelievers.”
“And then he proceeds to not visit nearly as often as he should. Tiffany, will you please go to the drying room and bring me garlic, willow bark, the gentian, the plantain, and the cinquefoil?” The maid dipped her head and brushed by Steve, offering him a shy smile as he stepped back to give her room to pass.
Tony sighed and shook out his hand, stretching his cramping fingers from where they’d been curled around a quill for too long. His back was hurting too, from leaning over the desk, and his head ached from staring at letters and figures for days on end. But none of that was new; sometimes he wondered that he could stand up straight at all, for all the hours he spent bent over his work. The worrying part was the creeping numbness in his fingers, the way his stomach cramped and turn at the mere thought of eating, and dizziness that struck increasingly often. One of those struck him now, and he sat back in his chair and rubbed his eyes with a sigh as he waited for it to pass.
"I'm so sorry, Antoine," a deep, familiar voice said from the top of the stairs. Tony glanced up and his blood ran cold as he watched Lord Stane coming towards him, his heavyset face arranged in a look of sorrow. "He was thrown from his horse and killed instantly. There was nothing I could do."
An hour later, the fire was burning merrily and everyone was clean and fed. Tony reached for his messenger bag while Sam showed Steve the curved blade of his sabre and they talked about the unique dappled pattern of the steel. He listened with half an ear to their discussion about the forging process as he flipped through the pages provided by Natasha yesterday; halfway through, a drawing caught his eye. Natasha’s spidery scrawl underneath it, written in code, said that people wearing this symbol on a signet were also asking for a man matching Bucky’s description.
“He’ll talk,” Steve said darkly. “As scared as he might be about this Lord Stane, he’ll have more pressing problems.”
Steve drained his cup of wine and set it down heavily on the wooden table, scowling at Bucky.  “I hate arguing with you.”
“They want to use me to get to Bucky,” Steve finished. Stark just spread his hands at that, looking tired as he stood and went to his liquor cabinet.  “So what happens now?”
“Forbidden,” Tony answered, and Sam looked at him sharply. Tony kept his face blank but cursed himself inwardly; a simple monk would not know Arabic. Natasha would be scolding him for his carelessness if she were here.
“I know what you’re going to say,” Natasha said, crossing her arms. “You’re going to say, ‘But I didn’t want anyone to worry.’ Right?” When Tony nodded sheepishly she scoffed. “The truth is, you want to be the first to help people but you are incapable of asking for help. You gotta be the hero, right? The invincible Iron Cardinal? Pure pridefulness. And because of that, we almost lost you.”
“Brother Steve,” Tony said quickly before Steve could answer, not confident that Steve would remember that they were technically supposed to be in disguise. “And I am Brother Eduard,” he said as he shook Sam’s hand as well. "Of the congregation of Saint Victor."
“Perhaps we should ask the inn if they have a bundling board,” Tony continued, his voice still light and teasing. “To make sure that no one strays from their side of the bed.”
“That would be unfortunate,” Stane said with a deep sigh. “I’d be disappointed to learn that you weren't any smarter than your father.”
"Oh, that's a story for another day," Tony said, voice deceptively light. "It's long and sordid, just the kind of story you hate."
Tony nodded stiffly, skin crawling at Stane’s touch. “Please make yourself comfortable, I will be there shortly. I would like to wash up after my travels.” He exhaled silently with relief as Stane turned away, until his steward spoke up.
“To be honest, I’m not entirely sure what’s really going on,” Tony admitted as he helped Ana set the table for dinner. “There’s a lot of rumors and speculation, but all we know for certain is that Stane is involved, and he seems to be after some relics that the Templars brought back from the Holy Land. Relics that were last seen leaving Paris in the hands of the man currently lying on the bed in there.”
“I’d like to hear it from you, if you don’t mind,” Tony said diplomatically, not missing a beat. He pulled out a sheet of paper from under the breakfast plate and handed it to Bucky. “Are these the relics you mean?”
Steve nodded. “Just got in, and Peter handed me this,” Steve said, returning Tony’s smile. “You got a message from your network.” Steve held up the piece of paper. “Apparently the Vicomte de Chatellerault is dead.”
“A serious sin indeed,” Stark said thoughtfully and cracked the whip once, a threat and a promise. “But you’ll need to be more specific, if you want your absolution.”
Steve almost dropped the plate with surprise. “The Iron Cardinal?” he repeated. “You…you knew about him? The whole time?”
just yet - the steward produced a basin and a pitcher of cool water. Tony gratefully washed his face and hands, raking his hands through his hair before drying them on a towel. He changed out of the black robes, aware that he was fortunate that Stane hadn’t noticed or cared enough to ask why he was wearing them. He hesitated for a moment over his scarlet robes of office or clothes befitting the son of a Duke – he needed to wear the best armor for the battle ahead of him, but he just realized he had no idea why Stane had been here with his father in the first place. He wished wryly for Steve’s chain mail and shield before settling on the rich linens and silks of a nobleman’s tunic and pants. With a sigh, he started to wave away the assistance of Howard’s page, a young boy that looked vaguely familiar, before a thought occurred to him.
“He may not be the most devout man, but I’m sure prayers wouldn’t hurt,” Steve said with a bow before he turned to Natasha. “I need a fresh horse.”
Steve didn’t get a good glimpse of the look on Stark’s face before he looked away. “Friend, huh? Just a friend, or a
“He didn’t really say, sir,” the boy said diffidently. “I just heard him say that he was here to meet with Lord Stane.”
“Good idea,” Bucky said.  They were in the stables where Bucky already had horses bridled and ready. “They probably won’t think to look for you with him. Keep your head down and don’t trust anyone until I come for you, ok?  We’ll let the first of the flames die down and then we’ll figure out where to go.”
Tony suppressed a sigh at his thoughts and rolled his neck on his shoulders, trying to ease the tension there. Edwin's horse shook its head with irritation, and Tony realized he'd been tightening up on the reins without noticing.
“No, I mean why do you spend so much time and effort to learn about things like forks from Italy and wine presses and vertical windmills?”
“Now how did you know that?” Steve sat down in the chair in front of the desk and read the message out loud. “’V de C’ – I’m going to guess that’s short for the Vicomte – ‘found dead in the middle of an apparent ritual with eight other members of the nobility. Observers think it was a suicide pact, probably Satanic judging from the symbols arrayed around them.’ I’m going to guess one of those symbols might have been for a many-headed snake.” Steve folded the paper again and passed it over the desk to Tony. “So I repeat, what did you do?”
"I always thought that men measure themselves, for better or worse, against their fathers," Steve said thoughtfully. Tony risked a glance over his shoulder and saw that Steve was scratching his jaw, staring at the road behind them. "I can't help but think that my father dying in a Crusade is why I agreed to become a knight."
“Yes, Your Grace.” Steve bowed his head modestly. It was a good look on him; usually he was stubborn as a mule, argumentative and single-minded. It made his offer of submission here that much headier, like a fine wine.
“I was afraid of something like that,” Natasha said, and spat a word in a language Steve didn’t recognize. “His missives lately had a tone I didn’t like.”
“There is – there is a man,” Steve said in a rush. His tongue was growing thick and he felt like he was going to crawl out of his skin with shame and excitement.
“What? Deceptive? Two-faced?” When Steve just stood there, tongue-tied, Tony scowled. “Just say it, Rogers-”
“Stop it, Steve,” he muttered to himself, and started reciting the Lord’s Prayer to himself as he ran. “Pater noster, qui es in caelis,” he panted, and his mind whispered,
Cardinal Stark,” Steve said automatically then raised his eyebrows. “Trusted advisor? Sounds like a promotion from aide de camp.”
There was still some light to the day when they rode into the first good-sized village on their route, large enough to have a tavern with a barn and rooms for travelers but not so large that there was more than one intersection. The streets were busy, with chattering groups of women carrying laundry, men on their way home from work with the tools of their trades, and children herding goats, making it seem crowded compared to the open road they’d been on all day. It was more people than Steve had seen in one place since he’d left Paris, and he hadn’t realized how much he had gotten used to the solitude.
“As nice as that sounds, I need breakfast,” Tony said, giving Natasha one last squeeze before letting her go. “Then I want to see this grail, and we can decide what to do with it.”
Stane’s smile sent a chill up Tony's spine, cutting through his anger. “Maybe.” He leaned forward and tapped his wineglass against Tony’s. "Or maybe not."
“We know your friend went south and west when he left Paris, but he never showed up at Castile,” Stark repeated. “I’m hoping he found a safe place to hole up and wait out the storm. Did he mention anywhere else he could have gone?"
“Thank God,” Bucky said simply, then smiled wryly as he looked down at his hands, where the fingers were still splinted and bandaged. “I don’t suppose I could have some, too?”
Of all the answers Steve had imagined, that was not one of them. “Was that the mother of your child?” Steve blurted, wincing as soon as the words left his mouth.
“Well you didn’t give me much of a choice, did you?” Tony pulled a folded sheet of paper out of his desk and handed it to Stane. “This is what we got out of him. I’d have him tell you himself, but,” Tony said with a shrug, “well, his pretty face is pretty much the only thing we left intact.”
You said yourself that Bucky sent you here to keep you safe, to hide you, right?” Steve nodded reluctantly.  “Then why would he send another knight, a complete stranger, to you and potentially draw attention to you, to risk your cover like that? Here? In the center of the worst of the persecution?” Steve had no answer to that, so Stark continued, ticking off his points on his fingers as he made them. “As I was saying, King Phillip is looking for the Templar treasure, which means he’s looking for your friend. He knows that you and Bucky were particularly close, so now he’s looking for you.  He knows that you and I knew each other, and I’ve already been questioned about you multiple times – what you might know, who you might know, where you could have gone.  Is any of this drawing a picture for you?”
Tony stood more slowly as Steve disappeared inside, knowing that Steve would want a few minutes alone with his friend. “Is he going to be okay?” he asked quietly, concerned by the shadow of worry in Ana’s eyes.
“You should rest,” he said, noting Bucky’s wan face. “I will wake you up when Tony comes, then you can tell him about the relics.” Bucky nodded, and Steve rearranged the pillows and blankets to make him more comfortable. He stretched out on one of the other beds and told Bucky rambling stories about his time with Tony until he heard Bucky’s breathing level out in sleep, then settled in to wait.
“Yes, Your Grace,” Steve said, mouth dry. Stark stepped away as if retrieving something else and Steve closed his eyes against the sudden flare of nervousness; then Stark was back, stroking Steve’s back possessively, and he settled again. The touch continued over the curve of Steve’s ass and then he felt the silk of Stark’s dressing gown against his calves as Stark knelt behind him.
Steve started to make another joke, but there was an odd twist to Tony's smile that made him think better of it. "You might be overestimating my virtuousness," he said instead. "Besides, one damsel in distress at a time, and right now it's Bucky's turn."
Tony raised his hands in surrender. “As you wish.” He watched Steve fold his robe neatly and set it on top of their traveling chest and then said, “By the way, I like to sleep naked. I hope that doesn’t offend your sensibilities.”
“Not the whole time, no.” Hands bandaged, Bucky paused expectantly, gesturing towards the plate with his chin, and Steve fed him a piece of chicken. “Didn’t think he was real for a long time, just a character from a bunch of songs,” he continued after he swallowed.
“Er, excuse me, my lord,” the woman said, dipping a quick curtsey before edging around Steve and his escort.  The cleric that served as Cardinal Stark’s assistant took advantage of Steve’s surprise to duck around him into the room.
It turned out that Hassam was a merchant that had been attacked on his way to the town that Steve and Tony just left. Steve tied up the would-be bandits and rode them back to the town to wait for the bailiff while Tony agreed to help Sam relocate his horse and wagon. They found the wagon a little further down the road, mired in mud from where the horse fled from the fighting. Freeing the wagon was muddy, miserable work; whatever Hassam was transporting, it was in heavy barrels and by the time the wagon was light enough to get out of the mud they were both filthy and exhausted and the sun was low in the sky. When they were done, Tony sat down on the grass and leaned against one of the barrels, groaning as his thighs and back complained from the unusual labor. Sam followed, sighing with relief as he sat.
“What?” Tony said defensively. He smoothed a hand over the robes self-consciously. “People might be looking for a pair of monks that ran hell for leather from Chatellerault, I thought we should change.”
“I am.” Concern for Bucky had been in the back of his mind since the incident with the Templar in Stark’s church, but now that he’d put the feeling into words he knew that’s what he was going to do, with or without Stark.
Despite everything, that brought Steve up short. "It's past noon," he said with a frown, and Stark looked surprised. “Are you really just now- never mind. There is a Templar downstairs that needs our help,” Steve said urgently.  “He needs sanctuary or – or help fleeing Paris…” His words faltered to a stop when he saw the incredulous anger on Stark’s face.  “What?”
“You’ve trusted me this far,” Tony said, voice pitched low to avoid waking Hassam. He sounded unbearably intimate, speaking in the darkness like this. “Please trust me a little more. There are…” He hesitated for a moment. “There are other people working on helping us find Bucky. We’re not alone in this.”
“He said he doesn’t know where the relics are, but he knows how to find them. His friend left him a map and clues, things that only a Templar would know.” Tony tapped the page, which had a map on one side and a series of notes on the other. “This is everything anyone would need to find the relics. Believe me, I made sure this one told me everything ”
“Yes,” Steve said, and it was two lashes this time, delicious flares of sensation. He panted and shuddered on Stark’s floor, heart racing as his body seemed overwhelmed by sensation. Stark noticed and came closer, running his free hand through Steve’s hair and cupping his cheek.
“Our Antoine has always had a hard time being still,” she said. “Especially if there was something that needed doing.”
“Stane. He asked me if I’d seen a man matching either of these pictures,” he said dryly, pointing at the sketches on the bottom of the page. “Now we have three separate parties looking for the relics. The crown, the church, and Hydra.”
Blocking the door, the footman drew himself up and looked down his nose as much as he could given that Steve was a foot taller than him.  “His Excellency said you were to be held in quarantine,” he said again. “He will see you when he has time for it, and no sooner. You will wait here until he is available.”
Steve took that for the dismissal it was and returned to the house. Bucky barely stirred as Steve and Edwin lifted him and put him as gently as they could in the back of the cart, trying to take care not to jostle his injuries. He looked so small laying there, Steve thought with dismay. So fragile.
Bucky had a restless, feverish night that night, waking Steve up mumbling in his sleep and trying to move. Steve soothed him, sponging sweat from his face and chest when he was hot and tucking blankets around him when he shivered, spooning the tisane and broth past his lips when he was awake enough to swallow. He tried to talk to Bucky about the relics but he was only speaking nonsense, so Steve stopped asking. Eventually Bucky fell back to sleep, the heated flush of his face finally fading as his fever broke, and Steve lay gratefully back down on his pallet.
Frowning, he looked again; from a distance, it certainly looked like Cardinal Stark, but he was wearing a very simple cloak and robes instead of his normal richly dyed and impeccably tailored vestments.  Curiosity piqued, he followed Stark around the street corner, staying half a block behind as he tried to figure out where he was going.  They wound through the streets and away from the water to end up in one of the poorer but still respectable districts of Paris until Stark stopped in front of a large plain brick building.  Stark knocked and wasn’t kept waiting long before a tall, lean monk answered the door, bowing respectfully as he welcomed Stark inside.  Steve waited until the door closed before he went closer to investigate the plaque mounted beside the door.
“They can perform miracles,” Bucky said, and even though Steve knew that there was no way that Tony believed that, there wasn’t even a flicker of doubt or skepticism in his expression as he kept his gaze on Bucky. “This one,” he said, pointing to the grail, “heals. This one kills.” He went down the list, naming the powers that he’d described to Steve until he got to the bottom one, which was a coil of rope. “This one didn’t do anything, though,” he said. “Not that I could tell, at least. “
“Can I see it?” Sam asked unexpectedly and Tony handed over the drawing. As soon as he saw Steve’s sketch he looked grim. “Not
“I do.” When Steve got to the far wall with his pacing and turned around, he realized Bucky was studying him. “What?”
Steve rotated the picture slowly, still studying it, and then he stopped. “Yes, actually,” he said, sounding surprised. “But this is a very poor picture. Hold on.” He got up quickly, dug through the chest of their belongings, and pulled out his sketchbook and pencils. Tony watched with interest as Steve’s hand moved quickly over the page; he'd never seen Steve draw before, and he really was very talented. Under his hands a slightly different picture emerged; what before had looked like a nest of snakes eating each other became one snake with many heads. “I saw this more than once in the Holy Lands,” he said as he passed the book over for Tony to study the picture. “Where did you see it?”
I knew Stark wasn’t going to get through this dinner without doing something outrageous. He can’t stand not to be the center of attention.”
“I know, I know,” Steve said soothingly, hoping Bucky didn’t injure himself. “Tony told me how important they are.”
Steve took first watch that night because he knew he wouldn’t be able to get to sleep, not with thoughts of the Hydra chasing themselves around his brain. The fired died down to banked red coals, and Sam and Tony had long since fallen still and silent. Keeping watch was always dull work, but tonight was excruciating; knowing that somewhere out there was a shadowy group of assassins and that they were also looking for Bucky made it difficult to sit still and listen to the nighttime chorus of crickets and frogs. Today’s brief skirmish had showed him how much he missed the simplicity of a sword in his hand and an enemy to fight, and he longed to find the right person to hit enough times to get Bucky back. More than once his gaze fell to the horses, who were dozing at the edge of camp, hoofs cocked, and he had to resist the temptation to take one and ride as fast as he could to Chatellerault.
Sam shrugged. “I was planning on traveling to Paris anyway. That is where the king is, that will be where the money is.” At the dull clop of hooves against the dirt road, they looked up and saw Steve returning, looking damnably clean and barely tired. With a groan Tony grabbed the edge of the barrel behind him and pulled himself to his feet.
Tony mused sardonically. "I'm sorry to hear that," he said, wondering what Steve was getting at. If he said anything about gratitude, Tony would not be responsible for his actions.
“Distribute the funds to the orphanages?” Sister Virginia finished.  “You mean, your favorite day of the month? Yes it is.”  She pulled out five purses, heavy with gold, and lined them up on Tony’s desk.  “This time, do try very hard not to blaspheme in front of them.”
“But- but you are-“ Clearly Steve couldn’t bring himself to say the words, so Tony said them for him.
“I just gave Stane a taste of his own medicine, so to speak,” Tony said with a shrug. “I figured if Hassam was right and Hydra was after the relics for their powers, the first thing they would want to do would be to drink from the Holy Grail. So I poisoned it.” At Steve’s look of disbelief, Tony added defensively, “If they had just stored it somewhere and not tried to use it, they’d be fine. It’s on them, really. I just gave them the rope and let them hang themselves.”
“Desperate times calls for desperate measures, my friend,” Sam said. He pulled a chest out from the corner of the room, which was stacked high with what was probably illegal contraband, and produced another key. “Your friend took a risk, yes, but it would have gone much worse for him had he been discovered with these in his possession.” Sam glanced at him with amusement as he opened the lid to the chest. “Perhaps if you and ‘Brother Eduard’ had been as trusting, we all would have been saved a great deal of trouble.”
“I’m glad you have come to me with these fears,” Stark said, coming to a stop in front of Steve. “Are these the same lustful thoughts from your last confession?”
“I know what you’re thinking,” Tony’s voice said softly out of the darkness. “But if you do that, you might as well be waving a flag for everyone looking for him.”
“I don’t know why you complain so much,” Bucky said mildly. “He’s been nothing but a gentleman all evening. You make him sound like a dissolute, pretentious wastrel.”
he told himself. Tomorrow they would find Bucky, rescue him from whatever trouble he was in, and…well, that was where Steve’s imagination failed him, mostly because he was weak enough to wish that finding Bucky meant that life would go back to normal. Steve let out another long, low breath, feeling a stab of pain at the thought. The idea that the Templars might be gone forever hurt like an open wound; his thoughts always shied away from it, and today was no exception. And now, the thought of a future without Tony in it somehow seemed colorless and dull.
To his surprise, Stark opened the door almost immediately after he rapped on it urgently. “Rodgers? What in God’s name are you doing here this time of day?”  To his surprise, Stark seemed alert and wide awake, as if Steve hadn’t dragged him from his bed
Tony had to work to keep his eyebrows from going up. The page had said that a meeting with Stane was what had brought his father here out of season. Why would Stane lie about something so minor? Tony rubbed his eyes and thought furiously. “I’m having a hard time believing that he’s gone,” he said. “I suppose I have to track down his will and start reviewing his accounts, arrange for his funeral.”
Tony woke up slowly with the most intense feeling of well-being that he’d ever had in his life. He could hear birds chirping and the early morning sun was a dim light behind his eyelids, telling him that the sun was starting its journey across the sky. He stretched and inhaled deeply, luxuriating in the feel of soft linen against his skin and the warm weight of the blankets against the chill of the morning air. He sighed happily, then suddenly his memory came back and his eyes snapped open as he sat up sharply.
With each mile that passed, Tony’s stomach tied itself into tighter and tighter knots. The silent but unforgettable presence of Steve behind him was like a loose tooth. He was sorely tempted to turn to study the surprising, frustrating man, but was afraid it would start a conversation and he had no idea what would come out of his mouth right now if he tried to talk. Steve's startling confession had hit like a lightning bolt from a clear blue sky, sending Tony's thoughts scattering like a flock of startled birds and distracting him at a time when he desperately needed to focus. Focus on the relics, focus on Hydra, on what he was going to say to his father. He and his father hadn’t exchanged words since a blistering encounter in Paris where they’d almost come to blows. It had only been the fact that his father was exceptionally drunk that had kept it from getting worse; Tony had too much pride to fight someone so inebriated. He had no idea what brought Howard to Chateau d’Angers this time of year, when the social season in Paris was beginning. A scandal? Illness? Somehow an event of this importance had escaped Tony’s attention, and the lack of knowledge was another weight on his mind.
A thought occurred to Steve, a mean, unworthy thought, but he was suddenly so tangled up in fear and lust and a hot, crawling shame that the words came out unbidden. “Is that why you’re helping me? To get your hands on the relics?”
slid inside him with a flare of sensation that sent sparks flying in Steve’s head, a vague feeling of wrongness twisted up with the deep satisfaction of a scratched itch or hunger sated.  Steve wanted to pull away and press into it at the same time and managed to keep still by the barest margin. As Stark’s finger withdrew then pressed in again, deeper each time, Steve set his teeth into his wrist, the sting of it grounding him as he felt like he was going to fly apart. He was so focused on the pleasure coming from his ass that when fingers circled his aching cock he jerked and made a strangled sound deep in his chest. As Stark stroked his cock with one hand, his finger curled as it pressed in, sending more bursts of sensation rocketing through Steve’s body. Steve’s hands were fisted in the pillow as he panted, breath rasping in his lungs with each breath, hitching, desperate sounds. He wished he could see Stark, wanted to see the dark, hungry look on his face again; was Stark watching where his finger was disappearing into Steve’s body, ready for his cock to be in its place? Did he enjoy seeing Steve fall to pieces in front of him so wantonly?
“I mean it,” Steve insisted. “You were right. I wasn’t ever angry at you, I was angry at myself because of…” Steve took a fortifying swallow of wine, trying to find courage in the bottle before he handed it back. “Because of how you make me feel.” He stared at his hands, scared to look at Tony because of what he might see on his face. “You make me feel
As more people arrived, he did his best to maintain polite conversation, but he knew that if he hadn’t been there with Bucky he would have made his excuses a long time ago.  At least when dinner was served Steve finally had something to do that would give him a good excuse to avoid conversation. At the head of the table, Stark was talking animatedly about something, hands gesturing expressively as he explained something to his neighbor, a Marquis who had trapped Steve into a conversation about hunting dogs that had lasted an interminable fifteen minutes before Steve had been able to escape.
Despite everything, Tony barked out a laugh at that. “Hurting my feelings isn’t a capital crime, Natasha,” he said. “Stane is the enemy right now, not Rodgers.” When Natasha nodded reluctantly, with a martial look still in her eyes, he changed the subject. “I’ll send updates when I can about Barnes, and you let me know what's going on in Paris when you get there.”
Soon, he could tell that Stark was close because his cock felt even bigger and harder in his mouth as he thrust, thigh muscles trembling. Then there was a bitten off curse, a groan, and Stark stilled, cock throbbing as he pulsed, filling Steve’s mouth with the sour, salty taste of his seed. Steve swallowed and felt like he was going to burst out of his skin if he didn’t reach his own release soon.
“We will be safer when we can get to my home. When Barnes can be moved, we will get a wagon and take him the rest of the way.” Tony eyed Steve critically and realized that Edwin was right; Steve looked like he was dead on his feet and Tony probably looked just as bad, but he knew neither of them would be able to sleep until they had news about Barnes. “Come. I’ll get us something to eat and then we’ll stay out of Ana’s way so she’s not tempted to throw us in the soup pot as well.”
Tony made a rude noise at that and packed the pillow back in the trunk. “If your faith in God can be compromised by the presence of a pillow, I don’t think the pillow is the problem. But fine, I can find you a rock and some gravel to sleep on for the good of your soul.”
“Well aren’t we a pair,” Tony said, completely exhausted from the effort of feeding himself. He was in bed, propped up against his pillows while James was in a chair next to him, having made his way up from the infirmary to join him for dinner. The walk had taxed James's strength, and he was eating his own dinner with slow deliberation so his shaking hands wouldn't spill his food.
“Gladly, Your Grace.” Steve was rewarded for this with a brief hand running through his hair, giving it a brief, sharp tug that made lightening go through his veins before it disappeared. He opened his eyes as he heard the rustle of robes again, listening as Stark went across the room and wearing the slight creak of a cabinet door opening. As he realized what Stark was getting, Steve’s hands tightened into fists for a moment before he forced them flat against his thighs; the anticipation was making his cock strain against his braes. He found himself holding his breath and forced himself to release it slowly.
“Thirsty,” Bucky croaked, and Ana must have heard them talking from the other room because she hurried in with a warm tisane, steam curling from the clay mug.
“Couldn’t completely give up your creature comforts, eh, Stark?” Steve examined the pillow, which was made of sturdy burlap on one side and cloth on the other, before handing it back. “No thank you.”
Something inside Steve squirmed with humiliation and excitement. “There – I hear there are ways, for a man to lay with a man as he does with a woman. That it can bring pleasure. So I have imagined what it would be like to do that with – with this man.”
