Steve grinned against Tony's skin. "Well then, why isn't he here with you?"

like a sweet praise that curls around his ears, making him cling for dear life.
UPDATE: I made Steve a little older to fit my quickly-growing-plot because suddenly there was, erhm, plot. More plot than what I intended to fit a PWP. So naturally, there were some plot-holes that needed to be fixed. Hence, Steve's age. He is no longer twenty-nine, but a few years older. I would say close to thirty-two?
would understand how to make that first contact of touch without fear of doubt. The floating image of Steve on top of a more female
He is still confused, not willing to tread further without proper guidance—which doesn't make sense. Tony usually bulldozes himself into everything. But Steve's face, the man's high-sloped cheekbones and soft, delectable lips...everything about Steve
The corner of Steve's lips twitch. A flicker of something; gone too fast for Tony to discern, then he has all of two seconds to react before Steve is sitting up, the Alpha’s hands gripping his waist. Tony is once again aware of Steve's bulk, his breath catching when he realizes that even while sitting, Steve fills the room with his presence. The Alpha’s nostrils flare. Tony's cheeks burn. Right. His pants. The mess in his pants. The very
“That’s different. You’re forgetting I approached you and offered you a drink, that
The buildings differentiate between tall and short, thick and narrow, a variety of brick, granite, and more; resembling a rich style that is unique to every era this part of New York has survived through. There is a mural that swirls chaotically along the stretch of one building, bursting with neon, almost eclipsing the surface in its entirety with a feeling of urgency, before stopping abrupt in the center of itself in blooming petals of orange and violet. The words 'peace' and 'freedom' painted in gold beneath it.
Aside from a few people walking the strip of various love motels, Tony doesn't recognize anyone, which is a good thing. That won't last for long, however. Which is why he needs Steve inside and booking them a room before that happens.
"How old are you, Tony?"
He must scent like Steve, too.
“Well, not really a proposition, more like an offer—or a favor, if you will,” Tony rambles, nerves tingling, ignoring Steve’s imploring stare. “If you haven’t noticed, I’m an omega,” he feels like such an idiot as soon as he utters it because
It baffles him.
Jenny.
Steve's hand smooths a trail along his arm and it grabs his interest, his skin still very sensitive to Steve's touch. And then it strikes him—an epiphany—no, more like his own selfish curiosity—Tony drops his gaze and sees the bulge in Steve's pants, still hard.
The Alpha takes it away when Tony’s finished. Then he’s being laid back down and pulled into his arms. Tony sighs, cuddling closer, a faint pleased noise heard in the timbre of his voice. He is content. Safe and sated. Relaxed.
The heat thrums in his veins, increasing and coaling with a sharpness he feels deep in his gut, his cock beginning to harden; Tony's body now finished with its rest.
Tony would have sworn he was good at hiding how tired he really was. Steve must have read his mind because he chuckled.
"Exactly."
"Dad-"
6224 days to be precise, not that he was counting or anything. He should be proud, and he was, on better days. But saying it to Peter had an awful bitterness to it.
"Yes. Sorry. Lost in thoughts. So. Yes."he tried to gather his thoughts together. "I'm gonna send someone take my stuff, and my lawyers will arrange something so that you keep the house and have the custody of Peter. And keep the car too."
He knew that voice. Familiar tone. He had known this voice all his life, maybe.
"He lied to you! He-" Steve looked at him with the flattest face he'd ever seen."What? "
Tony was pissed at himself, at Steve, at his past-self for keeping the cabinet full, for drinking so much that now he needed a full bottle of whiskey to be slightly drunk.
"I'm tired."
A lie couldn't hurt, right?
"On Wednesdays."
His heart jumped in his throat. Tony tucked his phone between his ear and his shoulder as he hurriedly put his shoes on.
The sweatpants were unexpectedly too big for him and hung on low on his hips. He was drowning in Steve's clothes and allowed himself to burry his face in it for a second. He was so tired.
"You sure you're in shape to drive ?"
He felt the soldier refrain himself from asking more questions. He owed him some answers, didn't he?
He walked away from the frame, remembering that he was here to sleep. He lied down under the covers, Steve's smell engulfing him. It felt like a dream. The unfamiliar darkness around him clashed with the comfort of being burried under Steve's things, in Steve's room, In Steve's home, like coming back to your childhood bedroom now turned into an office.
Tony gulped. He wasn't supposed to know that much.
Tony was fine with avoiding the subject. So he followed.
"Da- Dad?"
"Well he seems kinda dumb."
He brushed his fingers against Tony's skin.
James gave him a look he couldn't quite decipher.
"I'm sorry I scared you," he whispered.
"What does it look like, then? Stupidity? Rashness? Hazard ?"
" Don't be stupid. "
"Friday, transfer the file on my personal server, gonna work in the workshop."
"If you come here and kiss me," Tony retorted.
"Wow, you feel good. Come here." Tony pinched the front of Steve's t-shirt between his thumb and his forefinger and guided him up until he was sitting, Tony still in his lap. Tony took the hem in hand and Steve raised his arms, letting Tony peel his shirt off.
For some reason that response seemed to twist Tony in a knot, his anxiety palpable in the air. "Alright. Well, I guess I should get going," he said shakily. "That was gr-"
But a long moment passes and Steve's prolonged silence begins to feel like rejection.
But his legs are weak and they give out as soon as the Alpha pulls out, his seed spilling onto Tony's stomach and chest, leaving him wet, loose and empty.
He feels out of place—probably looks it too with his expensive suit and burgundy shirt, his tie long forgotten somewhere along the path here. It doesn’t matter though, he is frantic inside like a fast-beating drum. But his external presence does not betray his inner conflict as he calmly takes a seat by the bar.
Also, he doesn't have enough cash on him to ensure this liaison stays quiet and under-wraps.
Steve pants, harsh and breathy, as if the alpha is also shattering from the intensity of it as well. “Look at you. You’re doing so well, baby. So
The sound of the radio can be heard in the undercurrent of the pair's conversation, Steve chuckling every now and then.
The Haze. Tony blinks. Right. Correction: 'Omega Haze', a state of mind similar to that of a subspace but more...omega-ish, for lack of a better term. It occurs only when the Omega reaches a state of total relaxation that is stimulated by pleasure and/or intense emotion, the drop quicker when stimulating the bonding gland at an Omega's neck, an erogenous zone especially sensitive to an Alpha's proximity.
Then quickly in understanding, draws himself out, making sure their gazes are connected when he slowly pushes back in. Tony is so sensitive that he feels every burning inch, his body greedily taking him in; his skin tingling like before when Steve's mouth was exploring him. He feels like he is being turned inside out in the most pleasurable way.
The man moves his coat to the other side and Tony plops down on the bar stool next to him. He’s instantly hit with a wave of alpha musk: there is whiffs of citrus and bergamot, and an underlying woodsy scent that’s similar to fresh-cut wood. It's heady and intoxicating, more-so than the drink. It's impolite to inhale the scent of another, especially a stranger, but it's also too intense to ignore. No one else has scented this good before. Tony does his best to refrain from deliberately sniffing the man and forces himself to relax.
Steve's fingers close around his wrist, a thumb gently sweeping across his pulse point.
Until he decides it’s too much.
The ache returns, striking through him in a hot throb he feels all over.
“No,” Tony can't help but whisper, then proceeds to press the softest of kisses against Steve’s lips. He pulls back and stares deep into the Alpha's blue eyes. “No, I wouldn’t.”

an alpha. He can use a beta, or even an omega to help solve his issue. But the other denizens occupying the bar consists of an old, beta male with a beer gut, drinking with a not much younger alpha who is balding at the crown of his head; not that promising, so he doesn't bother eyeing the rest of the crowd. But there is a beta woman sipping a martini that sits across from him: mid-forties, a bit gray around the temples. He catches her eye and she offers a smile. She is pretty, but not interesting enough in Tony’s definition.
He totally saw himself as a beta guy, yet here he is, upon the precipice and the dawning of a new age. Of sex. With an
The sudden laughter draws the Alpha’s attention.
He’s teasing him, Tony realizes.
The presence of the alpha disappears.
"Hold on." Tony gripped his shoulder and Steve stilled, trying to pull away, but Tony stopped him.
Tony rolled onto his side and looked up at Steve with a lazy smile. "Come here."
"I know. I know." Tony rose up off Steve's lap making him groan. He got on his hands and knees and looked over at Steve. "Come on, baby, fill me up."
Steve skated his hands lower, gripping Tony's waistline for a moment then letting his fingers curl boldly around the curve of his ass.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Okay."
Steve prushed the pad of his thumb over Tony's hole and the responding moan made his cock twitch where it was pressed against the back of Tony's thigh. He shifted around so he could slide it between Tony's legs instead and Tony clamped them together, giving him a warm soft place to rut against while he teased Tony's ass.
"Trying to make sure this isn't all over in two minutes," Steve admitted with a breathless laugh.
"Sorry." Steve winced. "I'm -"
Thanks for reading!
we are definitely doing. But first…" Tony rolled his hips, and the sensation combined with the implication that they might do this again had Steve biting down hard on his lip and grabbing both of Tony's hips to hang on for dear life.
Tony braced his hands on Steve's chest and bounced, knocking moans and cries out of both their throats. "Fuck - touch me!" Tony called out. "Touch my cock."
"You said you didn't mind going bare if I got tested. Is that still -"
Steve tilted his chin, finding more contact with Tony's lips, and Tony pressed even closer, driving Steve over until he couldn't support his weight on his elbow and he tipped to his back. Tony shifted so his hips half covered Steve's and he could drive down into the kiss.
Steve shoved deep as he came, pulsing inside Tony, once, twice, then he rocked back and shot over the lace, watching it slide down the curve of Tony's ass. He released the panties and the fabric settled between his cheeks, instantly soaked in Steve's come. Steve stroked his hand down Tony's thigh and gripped the back of his knee while he waited for his breath to come back.
Tony seemed to have no desire to rush things along, though Steve flushed deeply when he realized he'd just been sitting there, hugging Tony like a teddy bear, burrowed against him as tightly as he could be.
Tony hummed. He rolled onto his stomach and lifted his ass in the air. Steve dropped the lube bottle by his hip and ran his hands over Tony's ass. It was even better in person. He let his thumb slip under the edge of the lace, rubbed it up and down, sliding closer and closer. Tony sighed and melted into his lap, face buried in the pillows.
Steve wrapped both arms around Tony's waist and drew them close together, his face pressed into Tony's neck. Tony's chin rested on top of his head. He smelled spicy and sweet at the same time, not overpowering, gentle enough that underneath was the smell of Tony's skin. Steve could feel the thud of his heart against his collarbone and without realizing it, he started breathing in time with the draw of Tony's breaths.
Tony stared at him long enough that Steve's heart started pounding hard enough to hurt. Then Tony twisted around and grabbed his phone off the bedside table. He typed for a moment then held it out for Steve to take.
Something in Tony's voice dug deep in Steve's chest and twisted. "I'm falling for you," fell out of Steve's throat unbidden, and Tony's mouth dropped open. "I didn't see it coming but I am. I can't stay all weekend, but I desperately want to stay all night and I want to have breakfast with you tomorrow and I don't want to be in your contacts as an eggplant emoji anymore. So don't -" Steve cleared his throat as the words clogged up. He pushed them out. "Don't ask me to stay the night unless you want that too."
Steve grinned. "The better to hold you up against a wall and fuck you, my dear."

"You okay?" Tony gave the back of his neck a light squeeze.
"Please." Steve groaned and nuzzled into Tony's neck.
Steve drifted his hands down again and cupped Tony's ass, pulling him even deeper into his lap. "You smell nice," he said stupidly, immediately regretting that nothing more poetic had sprung to mind. After four months of nothing but dirty talk, it seemed every suave word in his head had evaporated.
"Whoa, baby."
Tony grabbed a handful of his ass and ground against him. "Fuck me, Steve."
That's all folks! Thank you for reading!
"Steve?"
"Oh. Wow." Steve hooked his arm around Tony's waist, held him to his chest and spun, ending up on his back with Tony in his lap, chest to chest, his cock still buried deep inside him.
Tony beamed, eyes falling shut and head tipping back as Steve breathed warm air over the straining lace. "Because I wore them for you."
Steve popped the cap of the lube bottle and drizzled some so it slid over Tony's skin and slicked him up. He ran his fingers through it then petted one tip around Tony's rim before sliding in. He was hot and tight and Steve's slide was smooth and easy. He pushed in deeper, his hips automatically rubbing his cock between Tony's thighs. He wasn't going to be able to resist pushing inside that wet, tight hole much longer.
Tony.
As Steve bottomed out, he could feel the soft lace where it was bunched up off to the side. Lace Tony had worn for him. He bit his lip and groaned, eyes squeezed shut.
The next button only revealed an inch of Tony's undershirt and Steve growled - surprising himself and making Tony chuckle. Tony popped another button then grabbed a handful of the bottom to tug it up out of his belt.
"It's not. His name is Carlos. Beautiful man. Six-four. He plays basketball."
"Take your shirt off?" Steve husked out, voice pack-a-day rough and dripping with need.
"Is this position okay?" Steve asked.
"I'm…" He trailed off again. Deep red lace hugged Tony's cock, barely able to contain where it peeked out the top of a thin band. The panties arched up, promising to be even more revealing when Tony rolled over. There was a patch of dampness where Tony's eager cock had leaked against the fabric.
"Ah. Feels so good, baby." Tony's fingers furrowed through Steve's hair.
Steve twisted into the touch then pressed a series of open-mouthed kisses up Tony's length, swiped his tongue over the tip of Tony's cock that peeked out the top. He smiled at Tony's moan then kept working his way up, a row of kisses that ended with Steve's mouth latched over his nipple.
Steve broke into a messy laugh, too full of emotion for his own good, but Tony was grinning too and his eyes were bright. "That's a good upgrade," Steve said softly. "Thank you."
"Oh my god," Steve breathed, his balls starting to tighten, his cock leaking - leaking
It turned out that was completely wrong, and he was in fact an
So there was absolutely no explanation that Steve could see for Tony's ebullient mood today, or for the fact that he'd let a woman with pink hair paint a rainbow flag on his right cheek, or the collection of rubber bracelets, in a wide spectrum of colors, representing a dizzying array of causes, that he had around both wrists.
"Don't you dare."
He really wanted Tony here, doing all the things he'd promised to do to make Steve beg.
Steve kept thrusting into Tony, as deeply as he could, until Tony shuddered and clenched around him, almost painfully tight, as he came into Steve's hand.
, was Tony's reply.
"'S okay," he mumbled. "We can pretend this didn't happen." This was the best of the plausible scenarios he'd envisioned if Steve found out.
Steve shook his head a little, then kissed Tony. "Don't," he said.
Tony opened both eyes and turned to look at Steve, who'd turned so that he was facing Tony directly.
"You're going to kill me," Tony said, sounding far too happy for a man who claimed to be close to death. "I mean it. Here lies Tony Stark, he died from an overdose of Captain America's sex noises."
Or maybe he was just tired of pretending. The fun was wearing off for both of them, so it was time to put a stop to it. They could "break up."
Tony groaned. "God, do you think he noticed?"
"Yeah?" The word was rich with amusement, but more than that: interest. "Not seeing how that leads to drawings in a special sketchbook, Cap."
And then Bruce said, "Cap? Tony? You guys still there?" Then, to someone on his side of the portal, "You're sure these were the settings when we talked to Cap before?"
, Steve wanted to say, but then again, if making jokes got Tony through this, he could make all the jokes he wanted.
--Well. There really wasn't a better word for it, under the circumstances.
"I'm fine," Steve said. "I just-- Tonight, when we were out dealing with Unicorn and Killer Shrike."
If it had been Clint, for example, that people were speculating about, then he'd have asked Clint to pretend to be dating him, even though he had no interest in dating Clint.
"Have you heard me complaining about it? I just thought I might like a clean shirt at some point."
"Would I do that?" Steve asked, in a wounded tone.
The situation where apparently, someone going by the handle of "the great and powerful Karrin" was trying to imply that he and Tony were... a couple?
Steve closed his eyes, thinking about Tony's hands. He'd always liked them; he had sketchbooks full of proof of that. They were clever and capable and strong, and Steve had absolutely no doubt that they'd feel incredible on his skin. That Tony would know exactly what to do with those fingers once they were inside Steve.
It didn't necessarily mean anything. Maybe he wanted to talk to Nat. Maybe he just got tired of sitting next to the same person.
it, if that helps cure your whiplash."
"Never said 'she,'" he repeated. "Not a woman I'm in love with."
"Mostly, they're not of you, though," Steve said, his mouth dry. "They're
Steve wasn't sure whether he hoped the answer was yes or no. Would he rather know that Tony had overlooked him, or that he'd realized what all Steve's little gestures meant, and decided that Steve wasn't worth the effort?
Tony couldn't possibly be drunk, because he and Steve had been together all day, and he hadn't been drinking anything but water.
“Maybe you’ve never had the right motivation.” Steve waited until Tony was settled in the bed, then rolled over onto his side and put an arm over Tony, just below the arc reactor.
"Okay," Clint said, in between sips of his drink. "Shoot."
He couldn't see what it was doing. He didn't want to, any more than he wanted to look Tony in the eye.
"What I mean is--this seems so, so elaborate. Not to mention public."
Somewhere in the back of Tony's mind, there was a tiny corner that was still completely sober, and that corner was horrified to hear the rest of him say, "You should probably put me to bed."
Tony bristled visibly. "Got that, thanks."
Steve hadn't actually planned that. He'd thought they'd kiss for a while here in the elevator, but eventually, they'd have JARVIS turn it back on and continue up to Steve's apartment or the penthouse.
"I beg to differ. This is an excellent Tony. Top of the line, satisfaction guaranteed."
Steve normally hated Tony's driving, but right now--
"Bring them out into the light." Not that the cabin actually had light, but the thin gray winter sunlight trickling through the cracks between the logs was better than nothing. At least Tony would be able to see the candles.
"Sure, if you want to go out to dinner wearing armor and a cape, ask Thor. That's going to be on you."
Which was great, honestly, because not only was that Steve's plan, but it left his schedule free to accept last-minute invitations like the one that had come from Empire State University's Gender and Sexuality Alliance, inviting Steve (and Tony, if he wanted to come) to ride on their float in the Pride parade in two weeks.
Well, that answered one question. Tony wasn’t a good enough actor to fake that level of surprise. “You didn’t know you sleepwalk?”
"I had time to think about it," Steve said, and Tony tried not to grimace. "And despite the fact that you're an unbelievably frustrating human being sometimes, you really are my type."
And then Natasha said, "How did that interview go today, Tony?
"No, it's fine," Steve said, and immediately wondered why he hadn't taken Tony up on that.
Steve was thinking about going to get more coffee when Tony spoke up again. "You know, I thought I was making it all up, but this is one of the things I mentioned in that interview."
Of course, with Tony involved, there was always the chance that Tony would get distracted by something and go running off to his lab because he wouldn't be able to relax until he worked out this idea that he'd had. But Steve could follow him, and sketch him while he worked, and then convince Tony that science went better with the occasional break for something other than coffee.
Tony didn't like that Steve clearly felt the need to put a lot of space in between them. That was something new, and it was his fault.
"I know that," Steve said. "But you have to take pictures while things are happening, and I'm a little bit preoccupied when there are criminals rampaging through the Bronx." He rubbed a finger over a bit of the drawing, softening the line left by his pencil. He usually had trouble getting Thor's hair right, but the less-realistic style he was using for this drawing was working well for him.
But there was no chance of finding that out tonight, so Steve let himself fall asleep the way he’d wanted to for a very long time: in Tony’s arms.
Tony did the math. Six of them. Three teenagers, plus he'd seen how much food Thor could inhale. He gave her another twenty. "Get two dozen assorted. Make sure there's a lemon and a cherry-filled one for me."
The cabin they'd initially entered was primitive, but that was clearly deceptive. The back room wasn't a room at all; it was a cave, though Tony couldn't be sure if it was man-made, or if it was a natural cave that had been made more inhabitable through technology.
"We can do that," Tony said.
"Maybe I want you to connect the dots for me," Tony said, and maybe Steve deserved that.
"You'd better," Steve repeated, because if the thought of losing Tony forever had been bad before, now it would be almost unbearable.
They'd been spending a lot of time together. In public, of course; not just scheduled events, but if one of them wanted to go to lunch, the other one usually came along. Steve liked going to small art galleries when he had the time, looking at the works of new artists and buying the ones he especially liked. It was hard to wrap his brain around the idea that he could afford to buy art, just because he wanted it on his wall, but he did enjoy it.
He returned his armor to the armory, took an obscenely long, extremely hot, shower, and changed clothes.
--and see what they added up to?
"Okay," Steve said. "Be here at eight. I'll be ready. And Tony?"
He might have gotten away with that, if only because most of the time, Tony's plans were something like "wing it," which barely counted as a plan. Unfortunately, Colonel Rhodes was in New York and had come by the Tower for dinner.
If they were really together, Steve thought, he would love Tony so much right now that his heart would be bursting with it.
Steve might rip his damaged heart to shreds, but Steve wouldn't hurt him, and Steve didn't even know that Tony had a heart to be broken.
Tony had kissed him before. It was part of the image they were trying to present, and Steve had done his best to think of it as acting. It didn't mean anything, any more than two characters kissing in the movies meant the actors felt anything for one another.
But there was always long enough between their nights (or afternoons, or mid-mornings) together that the bruises had always faded before the next time, and they usually weren't very dark until the next morning, so maybe Steve hadn't known he was doing it.
He'd assumed Tony wouldn't mind, because it wasn't like Tony was ever a big fan of sticking to a plan.
"This is about the Andrews Sisters, isn't it?" Steve propped himself on a couple of pillows and reached for his sketchbook.
Better to keep focusing on taking stock of their surroundings. There was a doorway in the far wall of the cave; Tony opened the door to find a dormitory: four spartan-looking bunks--the mattresses thin and, when Tony sat down on one, not especially comfortable, but with several thick blankets piled on each--four small lockers, and another heater. Tony turned that on, too. Later, they might need to be careful about their power use, but right now, he wanted to get the damp chill out of their new living space.
Steve grinned. "I have a handful of sketchbooks and a shield," he said, "and you can't have the shield."
Steve couldn't answer right away. He was glad, too, grateful that the picture someone had snapped of him and Tony in a completely platonic moment had led him to this. But it was a lot to take in, sometimes.
"Stark Industries has a float," Tony said. "There's an LGBTQ employee group. If you'd told me you wanted to ride in the parade, I'd have set it up."
A few seconds later, the phone in Steve's pocket chimed with a text alert. Shaking his head, Steve pulled it out to read what Tony had sent him.
There was nothing ugly about the ragged gasp of, "Fuck, Steve, yes, that's so good…."
When he got to the green room, he discovered that he didn't have to tell Tony: he already knew.
They didn't have anywhere to be, and they weren't likely to be interrupted, not with the storm howling outside. They couldn't even get away from one another when it was done, so there was no reason to rush this.
could sleep on the couch, or go back up to his room.
"Great," Steve said. He wasn't sure how he was going to approach this, but there was a bright side: he was fairly certain he couldn't make things any more awkward between them.
Now, over a month later, someone else had found that picture and decided it needed a wider audience; they'd attached the caption "
They didn't talk.
"Tonight," he said. "Eight o'clock. Wear something nice." He paused. "If you need help picking something out, ask Sam or Natasha. On no account ask Clint."
he’s eating.
They were home.
"Besides," Tony said, "Steve and I are going to be dating. This won't work if we're not very public with our relationship. As far as the public sees, this would look exactly the same if this was genuine. And it's nobody's business what happens, or doesn't happen, behind closed doors."
"Duly noted, sir."
Then Steve would turn up at the door of the penthouse, or he'd nudge Tony on their way out of a mission briefing and they'd meet up fifteen minutes later in a supply closet, or, once, he'd come into Tony's workshop. (Tony had been impressed by his own ability to assemble the components of an elbow joint while Steve was attempting to suck his brains out through his cock. And people told him he was bad at staying focused.)
But of course the conclusions Steve jumped to were the right ones, because the universe hated Tony sometimes, at least where Steve was concerned.
"People also love seeing famous people miserable, so we'll give them that, too."
"How nice is 'nice'?" Steve asked. "I'm pretty sure our standards are different for that kind of thing."
He tried to picture the two of them at the zoo, and something twisted in the vicinity of his heart. "That should be perfect," he said. If it stung that much knowing that none of it would be real, that meant it was exactly what they should do.
By Steve’s calculations, SHIELD is about two minutes out when Tony smirks at his companion. “What do you say we get out of here?”
Tony didn't laugh. "Fair enough," he said. "I have to have something to look forward to when I get back, don't I?"
"Last night," Tony said. He took a drink of coffee to give himself a chance to think of how to phrase this. "Was I--no, wait.
Steve straightened up, taking his hand off Tony's back. He poured more lube into his hand and began applying it to his cock. "Good," he said. "It'll be our little secret."
Steve finished cleaning Tony up and set the washcloths and towel aside, waiting for Tony's answer.
And it sure as hell hadn't survived the rest of today.
"How long does it take to get home?"
MJ looked at the money in her hand. "If you throw in another ten, we can get a dozen doughnuts, too. I know they made the cherry-filled ones at Downtown Doughnuts this morning; I went past there on my way to Ned's and they had the specials sign out."
Steve laughed again. "You actually thought I'd want to keep this a secret?" He paused. "Some of the details, yes. Please let's make sure nobody has any idea about those. But in general?"
It hadn't occurred to him until his last night away that he could have called Tony. Even though no one would know whether or not he had, even though it contributed nothing to their pretense.
Tony got slightly more pointed questions than Steve had: "Did you cheat?" "Did
"I've had nights like that." The apple was gnawed down to the core; Steve tossed it into the trash and concentrated on drinking his coffee.
But also, the lab was the place where Tony was the most himself, and Steve wanted that. Steve wanted, loved, everything about Tony, even the parts that frustrated him--but Tony Stark in his element, giving his brilliant mind free rein in his workshop? Steve didn't really understand how anyone could see Tony like that and not fall at least a little bit in love with him.
Tony looked at Steve. "You told them we were moving in together? You told them where you live? Are you nuts? We'll never get rid of them, they're like roaches."
Tony had already pulled out his phone and was starting to make notes. "I can use that to simulate an opponent. If we come up with a more comprehensive list, the training room AI can generate randomized opponents--with different physical attributes and skills, as well as different sets of magical attacks and defenses. JARVIS, we're going to want all the recordings from any confrontations with, let's see. Loki, the Enchantress, Victor von Doom--"
The door whooshes close behind them, shutting with a
"You're nervous." Steve states, continuing his search through the channels as if his word weren't blunt enough to cut through Tony.
“Why does it have to be sex? Why can't it be something else in the contract?” Steve presses, ignorant of Tony’s inappropriate thoughts.
"There is more to art than just putting pen to paper, Tony." Steve smirks for the first time that night, a sort of playful glint in his eye.
There is a motel standing four stories high, tucked neatly between two other buildings with enough room along its side to house stairs climbing upwards in a zigzag; the surrounding streets looking discreet enough with nondescript people. The exterior of the motel appears long-established, emitting a blink-and-you-will-miss-it feel to it with visible walkways wrapping along its front, and deep hallways striking a line in the center of it on each floor. A neon sign blinks
I will leave the rest in the end notes.
His quip makes the Alpha purse his lips in quiet contemplation, before looking resigned when he finally shrugs and replies, “sure, why not?”
in pale luminescent color.
"Why?" he presses. He feels like he is treading on thin glass here, as if this accumulated image and opinion he has of Steve can be shattered if Steve doesn't answer the way Tony wants him to. But how does Tony want him to answer that?
"If you're not going to help me, I’ll find another who will," Steve clenches his jaw at the admission,
Tony raises his eyes directly to Steve's.
Nonetheless his eyes slip down to the Alpha’s thighs, the fabric of Steve’s pants restricting of Tony’s wandering gaze. Why does he have to be so God damn
when Tony finally realized the point Steve was making, begrudgingly following him into the backseat of a yellow cab. Sure, he teased him about the cab, but that doesn't mean Tony would've actually got into one if Steve had sent him home.
Tony can
"No," he denies.
The gland at his throat
It allows time for Tony to breathe, to suck the air back into his lungs before Steve thrusts back in with a force that equally shoves it out of him.
he doesn’t know what he’s asking but Steve acquiesces him, understanding what Tony doesn’t, and takes the rest of his shirt off.
"What are you doing?!" he almost shouts, embarrassed.
' the teacher had announced, clinical and to the point. Before flicking her wrist at the projector, the sound of a button being clicked; the image and diagram changing.
Tony sees it then, the hard, intimidating jut of Steve's cock held back by his trousers. He's breathing, right? Tony is breathing? The Alpha begins to unbutton his own shirt, portions of pale, alabaster skin becoming unveiled. The muscles beneath the flesh rippling with each movement when finally, the shirt is sliding off.
Actually...yeah. That sounds good. Real, real good. He could... he could
Tony lowers himself to his chest and relishes the feel of Steve’s chest hair light against his own skin, and drags his mouth up the middle of Steve’s sternum, sweeping his palms up and around Steve's shoulders while titillating his hips. The muscles beneath his palms flex in response.
Tony remembers Steve barely glancing at him in the bar as if he was afraid of seeing something, but hidden within the sanctuary of this room it's like Steve can't do anything but fixate on him. Like Tony is the moon and Steve is the burning sun, both on the verge of eclipsing.
And in the way Steve speaks to him, has been treating him all night like he isn't someone lesser; tender, playful, and sincere. So kind and unlike everything Tony has faced in his life. The breath whooshes out of him and he is left staring in stunned silence at Steve, once again trapped within the confines of the acknowledgement he earlier refused in the cab.
The light isn’t any better outside, but Steve’s eyes seem to glow a tad brighter in the surrounding streetlights, like the moon reflecting off trembling water.
ugh, just thinking about it makes him bristle. "Listen, it's just the deal-breaker, okay? It's how my world works. Everybody follows these stupid, crazy ass traditions and expects their children to do the same." Where the
, shouldn't—but he imagines a pretty, doe-eyed Omega writhing beneath Steve’s massive frame. Another omega whom, perhaps, has been touched by Steve; whose had Steve’s hands all over her body. His mouth on her hips and stomach, making her cry out from the pleasure—Tony is seized by a sudden and fierce feeling of possessiveness—and hastily decides he dislikes that image with a passion.
Steve's hands continue to explore him, discovering which spots make Tony writhe; a finger pinching at his nipple, making Tony gasp, then suckling the puckered nub into his mouth. His thumb pressing into a soft spot behind the crook of his knee, then another spot found in the indent of his hip; Steve unraveling him with soft, gentle touches, and even softer kisses pressing into his flesh.
more firmly this time, a hint of Alpha tone, as if to brush off what Tony gave voice to; like Tony just said something so ridiculous and irrational the Alpha couldn't stand another second of it.
Again, I'd like to thank everyone for reading and allowing me this opportunity to share my work. If you enjoyed it, please don't forget to kudos and comment! :) I love reading your guy's feedback, it's important to me and it's always a blast!
He doesn’t know what to do after that. Steve must understand, considering he begins to show Tony how to touch him, how to grip and how to suck—
And then he’s floating.
Tony berates himself.
If you see any grammatical errors or misspellings, please let me know. I am open to constructive criticism.
When the Alpha doesn't seem convinced, Tony stands straighter and lifts his chin, challenging the man to sway him. "I'll wait for you out here."
“What’s so funny?” Steve asks.
Steve cups his cheek, swipes his thumb across the bone of it, and whispers husky and low: “God, yes."
Lost somewhere in space, somewhere beyond the physical realm, maybe. A buzzing in his ears. He feels limp and sluggish, his body melting into the sheets, becoming liquid. His legs holding no more strength and spreading further open without shame. There is no shame to be had when all he feels is a strong warmth of contentment and a want to burrow himself deeper into the alpha scent hanging around him, thickened with the tang of deep arousal.
Citrus and lemon and bergamot, alluring and delicious, cloying on his tongue and teasingly caressing his Omega psyche. But he searches for something, knows innately it will be found. And there it is. Tiny, but present, sweet like peaches and cinnamon, hanging along the edges of Steve’s musk, Tony’s omega scent possessively weaving in and out.
At the prospect of more though, his breath tumbles slow, and he licks the sudden dryness from his lips.
Steve hooks his fingers and rubs that same spot from before. Tony’s hand shoots out and closes tight around Steve's wrist, the pleasure too sudden and sharp. But he holds him there, encouraging the Alpha with a thrust of his hips, wanting to chase the spark of electricity that licks down his spine. Steve angles his fingers and thrusts in again, hitting home; the sensation curving Tony's back into a sensuous arch.
If you are enjoying this story, PLEASE don’t forget to leave a kudos or comment! Feedback is very important to me UwU I like knowing what your thoughts are regarding my fic! :)
But then Steve’s shock quickly dissolves into impassive silence. It's such an abrupt change from their earlier interaction that it makes Tony feel small under his unreadable gaze. He is far out of his element here, literally and figuratively, but it doesn’t lessen his desperation one bit. He understands that alpha’s don’t appreciate it but Tony meets the man’s gaze head-on, hoping he will understand the severity of the situation he is currently stuck in.
"Anything you want," Steve reaches over him to the nightstand, slightly jostling Tony. He pulls away from the crook of Steve's neck and looks up out of curiosity, spots a phone clutched within Steve’s big hand. "I have Uber eats," Steve adds proudly and gestures to his phone with a slight shake, smile so soft and warm Tony could fall into it.
The Alpha looks over at him, quizzically, as if he is trying to figure him out. And then he says, "I said we have all night, Tony. And I meant it. This is your first time."
The warmth of his hand falls away, replaced by cold. "Wait here then, you stubborn omega."
a genius, you ever hear of post-coital bliss and how it mucks up your brain?" Tony quips.
perhaps the omega fights back instead, much like Bradley, the investigated witness in the crime novels he has read. The lone wolf who preferred dominance over the baring of his soul, challenging the alpha detective to bite instead of kiss, to fuck instead of make love.
"But..." the words muster and coil on his tongue, another refute ready, but he can't bring himself to say it. Steve appearing so earnest and believing of his own words it has him at a loss.
He hears the same wild noise from earlier, a mixture of Steve's name and a whine.
while Tony sits there and nods along. It might be the alcohol or—no, it's definitely the alcohol, because Tony opens his mouth and says something along the lines of
Steve settles himself between his legs and rubs the tops of his thighs, then moves his touch up and along his torso. "You’re a work of art," he mutters in a deep baritone, watching Tony. He leans close and brushes a kiss against the plane of his stomach, trailing up along his ribs and to his chest. “So sweet,” he stops at his nipple, flicks a tongue out to taste it. "I could eat you up."
“Steve,” he whimpers, breathy and filled with heat that the Alpha pulls back and looks at him. His eyes are dark, hungry, the sea behind his gaze swirling with lust. Tony wants to drown in it. "Please..."
, omega." He quips back, can't help but snatching the last word, mirth twitching his lips when the older man rolls his eyes.
Another moment passes with a look of quiet contemplation on Steve’s face, an honest but still playful glimmer in his eyes, before querying, “was I really that broody?”
, he thinks quietly, a wild contrast to the man's earlier impassiveness, watching the corners of his eyes crinkle like leaves. Would Steve be gentle with Tony? Would Tony want that from Steve? He hasn’t put much thought into it, not really thinking beyond the wham-bam-thank-you-alpha aspect of it.
The words do something to him, make him shutter and shake because
The image is arousing but also ridiculous, Tony realizes, and snorts a laugh.
it. The want to submit burning a hole inside him; a terrible need to show Steve how good he can be almost knocking everything out of range and focus.
"What she doesn't know won't kill her, right?" he offers, observes as Steve grows quiet again.
(See the end of the chapter for
away.
“Well?”
He wishes he had called Jarvis.
It's the Haze—or O.G.—working its greedy grip onto him. It has to be.
He is painfully hard by the time the alpha pulls back, whining at the loss of his touch.
His gland aching all the more.
There are tears slipping down his cheeks and he cries out, drags his nails down Steve’s back, torn between wanting more and telling the Alpha
That process of thought has red flags all over it.
Steve frowns a bit, his handsome face shifting, "I may not be on steady ground with her at the moment, Tony, but I still have a fiancé. If she finds out..." he attempts to explain.
"No way. I'm not going to leave you by yourself." Steve dismisses.
Steve stares at him.
A fog rises in his head, a slow encompassing feeling as he feels the sudden need to
Then the world falls away.
this.
Tony sets down his cup on the table. "You mean, you want to make sure I'm conscious enough to make this decision."
Steve rises and gently maneuvers Tony backwards, Tony going willingly. He towers over him, the top of Tony's head reaching a bit under his nose when Steve stands at full height. With one hand he grips Tony’s chin and tilts his face up, his touch so gentle and soft it makes Tony feel like his skin is made of glass, prone to shattering with one hard press.
Tony does the quick math, which would make Steve thirty-two. It also makes him 13 years older than Tony. It should not, in anyway, make Tony feel a little hot under the collar—he swears he doesn't have daddy issues—but it does, regardless of Steve’s current situation with his fiancé—ex-fiancé?
It's a motel.
“The image of you wearing nothing but a leaf,” he responds, not missing a beat despite the heat in his cheeks.
him to, even if Tony fumbles in his pursuit.
“Have you ever touched yourself, Tony?”
of all alpha's. Tony knew he only had so much time left before his father finally married him off. He’s lucky he even made it past nineteen; an omega marrying later than that was unheard of.
“This will hurt,” Steve warns, looking down at him with worry.
Tony gasps.
Decent looking, but far less luxurious than what Tony is accustomed to.
Tony presses closer, his fingers curling around Steve’s shirt.
Tony sighs, staring at something above him but not quite seeing it. Not wanting to. He feels no urgency for anything. Not when he is being gathered into strong arms, the scent of Alpha strengthening. Tony chases the scent, finds himself burrowed in the Alpha’s neck and scenting at his gland. He licks it, tastes the explosion of citrus on his tongue, feels the Alpha tremble beneath his attentions.
Why is his heart beating so damn fast?
Now that Tony is closer he can see how the lighting in this dingy bar doesn’t do the man’s eyes enough justice. They are deep, imploring, and an ever-shifting blue. He wonders how deep they go, if he can see straight down to the depths of his soul.
his vast knowledge and expertise falls short. Can't Steve just bend him over already? Pick him up and throw him on the bed? Perhaps rip his clothes off and perform that trick Jenny's alpha did in the book; hand on his neck, finger pressed into his gland and...Tony coughs, looking down and away.
He glances away and looks around, taking in his other options. He doesn’t just
good. He was perfect. Like the Alpha. Like his big, strong alpha.
Wait, what?
after the media spent all day exploding with news of his engagement to Tiberius Stone—and knowing how fast news spreads, Howard would catch wind and be here within minutes, putting an abrupt stop to his carefully thought-out plan. Yes,
Tony orders two more bourbons with no ice—he doesn’t need his alcohol to be watered down tonight—and moves to sit beside the blonde Alpha.
They have made it to the motel—a love motel, sure. A place where all sorts of inappropriate things happen, such as affairs, like that one between that Alpha politician and his Beta dog-sitter that blew up on social media just last week. Yeah. Okay. Is this an affair? He thinks about Steve's supposed fiance and his mate-to-be that is probably wondering where the hell he disappeared off to. It's been several hours since the adjourning of his meeting—well, his father's meeting, Tony was only there to sit and look pretty.
His softened cock twitches in interest, but he ignores that in favor of his curiosity—
Steve chuckles softly at that, “you’ve no idea.”
The cloth is pulled away and Steve is sitting up, throwing it to the side. Steve returns to laying beside him and watches Tony stretch his limbs like a cat; Tony subconsciously arching his body this way and that, preening beneath Steve’s appreciative stare, craving his attention like a newborn babe.
he thinks, or rather doesn't, his body understanding the implication faster than him and gushing more slick. It soaks through his Calvin Klein’s, trickling down his inner thighs, his pants teetering the line of being completely soaked. Steve's grip tightens in response.
Dammit, he just had an orgasm! He needs to cool down and get his body back under control, lest Steve thinks him needy—or does Steve like needy Omegas? Has Steve been with another omega before Tony? Is Steve's fiancé a—nope. Don't go there. Stay far away from that thought.
Not that Tony is complaining. He just has a vivid imagination, especially when the Alpha’s clothes appear to have a difficult time containing his mass. Tony’s exaggerating. Steve’s clothes fit him just right—well, in all the right places. Except for the places that should be more tight. Like his chest. Or...not his chest...he glances down.
Steve uses the key to unlock the door, then holds it open, ever gallant—whoever said chivalry was dead is a liar—and waits for Tony to step in.
His pace of thought is usually faster than this.
But it's his body's biological response to Steve that has Tony feeling embarrassed.
But he keeps rolling his hips, enjoying this embellishment of power and having a big, strong Alpha beneath him; the man's grip almost bruising, but still relenting enough to allow Tony the pace he wishes. And he presses insistently, again, and again, and
Tony rubs his palms together, fast, and feels the slight dampness, hoping his scent isn't haywire with his obvious direction of thought.
The Haze itself tempting and salacious at his ear, threatening his forefront voice by consistently trying to persuade him that he should please the Alpha—
His mouth parts; vision blurring and growing hot.
Tony waits with baited breath.
“You’re very beautiful, Tony.” Steve rumbles low in his chest. “How you’re not bonded yet is beyond me.”
He pretends it is the hormones and post-coital bliss that pushes him deeper into the Alpha's embrace, wanting to disappear into Steve’s warmth and have the man reform around his shape, like the feeling he evokes within Tony from his gaze. To say
He doesn't realize he is panting; soft, tiny breaths to keep him from whining low in his throat.
mess in his pants, the scent of his arousal permeating into the air now that he’s not sitting down.
"Fuck," Steve moans low, deep and guttural. A sound that echoes deep inside Tony, pulling an answering whine from his throat.
He might as well go move in with his alpha-to-be.
They go on to talk about Steve's work and how he is a professor at some Art university; he also offers free beginner classes on the side for seniors who started life too late.
"Please," he begins with a scoff, the urge to roll his eyes intense, but he quells that. "I am Howard's one and only omega son." A burden on his father, sure, but also a blessing to him in some sick, twisted way. The media is already well aware of that and, naturally, Tony assumes the rest of the world.
is that bartender?
and so damn gentle—how can an Alpha be so soft? But the good kind of soft?
Tony sighs, "because it's one of many obligations written in the contract that legally prevents me from being intimate with another person," it was actually at the top of the list fucking underlined and everything.
But he doesn’t want to move.
He can't help himself, he laughs.
He sobs at the loss, feels lips brushing his gland in apology, a final lick of pleasure intensely shooting through him at the small brush of contact. Overstimulated, it stretches him too thin, spasms wracking him.
“Wait!” He tries, breathless, trying to push at Steve but the alpha only grabs his hand and interlocks their fingers, ignoring Tony’s cries and persisting in his gentle attack.
He thinks of the man's fiance. Or rather, doesn't. Not willing to step into that. Not when a spark of jealousy hits him hard in the chest, which is ridiculous—Steve isn't his. He
He grips Tony by his nape, his thumb pressing into the gland now swollen and ready by his throat. It shoots white-hot pleasure through him, intensifying the incursion of it all, a high whine tumbling out of Tony’s mouth. He feels how Jenny felt. God damn, he
too fucking good to stop.
"So you're here to find a way out," he surmises.
At the mention of food his stomach makes its interest known in a loud grumble. "God, yes," Tony groans, rolling into his warmth, Steve's arms easily welcoming him.
He releases Steve and tries divesting him of his pants, but Steve helps him by doing most of the work; Tony feeling too drunk on his lust, his skin aflame with sensitivity. Then the Alpha is laying back down, naked and languid in all of his glory, all sinew and chiseled flesh. His cock laying thick and heavy on his stomach, flushed a deep pink at the tip and already leaking pre-cum, matching the color of Steve's lips. His knot sits at the base of it, thicker in girth. The sight of Steve almost has Tony twisting himself around and presenting himself, his instincts roaring, but he stays willful and present.
"Yes," Tony allows, "but you teach
Then the Alpha is back, the bed shifting as he sits. He helps Tony sit up, the touch of something against his lips. He tastes water. Cold and brisk and sweet. He greedily gulps it down, doesn’t mind the water slipping past his lips, not when the Alpha makes a pleased rumble.
"Am I nervous now?" He taunts, staring down at the Alpha who lazily moves his gaze from the TV to him. When he attains no reaction from Steve, he turns the TV off for emphasis, the room now falling silent except for his harsh breaths—which he attempts to steady.
Tony licks his lips and Steve follows the movement with his eyes. When he returns to Tony's gaze his eyes are less impassive and more open, a kind of hesitant hunger swirling behind his baby blues. It’s the first show of honest emotion he has seen from him all night, aside from his playful smirk and sullen looks. It matches the heat simmering beneath Tony's skin.
Steve kisses him one more time, his teeth softly dragging at his lip before pulling away. He begins deftly unbuttoning Tony’s shirt; the Alpha's eyes flitting between working the buttons and watching him. Tony has this innate sense that he is being unwrapped like a gift when Steve looks at him like that. Then Steve tugs, making the shirt hang around Tony's shoulders, baring slivers of tanned skin. Steve leans close and kisses Tony again, like he can’t get enough of him; softly, slowly, a touch of tongue grazing his lips. Then he lowers his head and brushes his mouth above his right pectoral, proceeding to lay another across his chest and up into the juncture between shoulder and neck—close to the gland swelling hot and pink near his clavicle, the area around it heating up.
Yeah, there is no way Tony is letting this chance slip through his grasp.
Steve pays and thanks the driver—saying the man’s name because Steve seems to be nice like that—and climbs out of the cab, offering a hand to Tony. Tony briefly wonders if it's all an act, this nice card that Steve is pulling, like how some Alpha's are known to do; drawing in their prey by false acts of kindness before closing their jaws around them.
“Whatever you want,” the Alpha reminds him.
He drags his eyes down along Steve's muscled front, along the chiseled cut of his shoulders and pecs. The urge to taste overcomes him and he presses a kiss beneath Steve's collarbone, darts a tongue out to taste the salt on his skin.
Tony draws his gaze up at the Alpha, "consider me conscious, then."
Steve's affirmation makes the heat draw hotter beneath his skin. The anticipation coiling tighter and coalescing with his hunger. "Okay." He startles Steve by trying to turn over, wanting to present himself the traditional way, knowing this is how it happens. But Steve's big hands halt him, the Alpha chuckling softly.
With an
The atmosphere is tense so Tony stays quiet. They drink in solemn silence, clinking their drinks in tandem when needed. He’s probably lonely, Tony thinks after a while, because when he gestures for another the man nodded readily. They go from having two drinks to four and he assumes the guy is pretty buzzed when he finally breaks the silence and says, “I’m Steve, by the way.”
He goes there.
He presses more insistently against Steve, his carnal need to satisfy leading him deeper into the fog—Steve will take care of him. Steve wants to make
He didn't realize he was scenting distress when he feels Steve put his hand on his arm. "I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have asked. Clearly this subject upsets you.”
The lights flicker green.
Steve’s eyes flash. Then the Alpha is on him, slanting their mouths together.
in his plans. Yes. Bump. Correct choice of words. An obstacle—a very difficult thing. Not like he is nervous upon realizing his plan is close to fruition and instead of being an idea floating around in his head, it has now become a real concrete thing in the present.
The Haze relents enough for Tony to think,
Steve wants him.
Steve throws his last vestige of clothing to the side, then grips his thigh, spreading him.
He sits straighter, now twice as nervous, a bit ashamed at how turned on he already is to jump Steve's bones. He should be more omega-like, he thinks, more mannerly and strait-laced, but the thought is quickly erased by the fact Tony doesn't know what Steve likes. He hasn't been privy to that knowledge or even hinted toward anything, the Alpha being as cool as spring, disciplined and collected in a way most alpha's aren't.
“I don't want to give you blue balls, Steve, or blue knot." He whispers, a far away part of him wants to burst into flames of embarrassment at the words, but it feels unimportant. Unnecessary. Why should he feel embarrassed about wanting to please the Alpha?
”Yes.” He finally admits.
Thank you everyone for being amazing! I appreciate every single one of you!
(EDITED AND REVISED 10/22/2019)
He sets down his empty glass, clears his throat, and made bold by the liquor running through his veins, he begins with: “I have a proposition.”
Tony wants to say
I will also be introducing a different type of Omega male anatomy that I’ve always wanted to explore. Key word: intersex. If you don't like that, I advise you don't proceed with the fic. If you do, by all means, read on!
He feels a deep throb echo inside him, more slick pooling.
read, by the way—to understand what can happen; like the alpha becoming overwhelmed with desire and throwing the omega on the bed, pinning them into place, a firm grip on the back of their neck and a rutting cock pressed to the back of their thighs; and the thought of Steve—eyes dark and possessed, the total opposite of the kind Alpha he has witnessed so far—it sends an unwilling but healthy amount of wetness between his thighs, his cock throbbing.
Steve holds out his hand.
Well, he’s conscious and if he’s being completely honest, he is a little more than just excited.
He can no longer stand the distance between them and swiftly leans in, clumsily pressing his mouth against Steve's unsuspecting one. He brushes Steve's mouth once, before the heady scent of Alpha slams into him. Steve's scent of arousal thick like molasses, heavy with his alpha musk and a tinge of sweetness that makes Tony whine low in his throat. The scent in itself like a lewd caress to his Omega senses, his gland flaring to life.
He hears a rustle of movement, his pulse jumping, and looks up to see Steve lounging himself on the bed. His long, legs crossing at the feet, using a remote to turn the TV on. The quiet of the room is then filled with the sound of Steve flipping through channels.
Tony thinks for a moment, contemplates leaving again before running his eyes one more time over the alpha. He is handsome, overwhelmingly so. It’s enough, Tony thinks, then pushes toward his decision: “can I buy you a drink?”
“Do you want me?” Tony tries to make it sound teasing, coy, like how Omegas are sometimes portrayed in movies. But his voice comes out breathy and soft, vulnerable.
he reaches down and runs his fingers along the bulge in Steve's pants. Steve's breath hitches and Tony takes it as a good sign, settling his fingers more firmly against him.
he hears himself say, tasting it on his tongue, the name rolling off easily. The alpha—Steve—looks over at him.
to. He doesn't care if he appears needy or desperate because
But then Tony pulls away. His mouth dry. His puffs of air almost sticking inside his mouth.
Omega male's are built differently from the average Beta and Alpha. Where both gender's of the Alpha have the knot, Omega males are intersex, granting them the use of a uterus and the ability to bear children. And even though Tony is incredibly turned on, he feels uncertain about himself.
Tony gathers his courage and presses his hand intently against Steve’s shirt, feeling the muscles flex beneath his palm. He would still very much like to see that chest of his, but he wants to begin with something he’s more familiar with.
He turns and almost drops his pen.
Mindlessly, he tries digging his heels in, to keep the Alpha in place so his knot can lock them together—and for a brief sweet second he thinks it will.
He understands why Howard wants Tiberius as his Alpha, but he'll be damned before he ever follows through with it. Tony is also aware that Tiberius has been coveting him since they were first introduced when he was fifteen. Far too young an age to expect marriage, but still old enough to discuss it. Since then, the man has been hanging around like a dog in rut.
(See the end of the chapter for
Until he decides enough is enough and his hands are on Steve's belt, the clink of it echoing in his ears. He unzips Steve's pants and slips a hand beneath, searching.
"You had a lot to drink," Steve comments, watching with pleased eyes as he accepts it. "Just making sure you're not dehydrating yourself."
"I'm a professor," he states bluntly.
Steve's brows furrow, taken aback. “What?”
he wants to say. "Never better," he responds with instead, sounding final, wanting the Alpha to stop pestering him.
Straddling Steve has Tony pressed against the material of his pants and if he lowers himself just so—Tony gasps. Steve's hands fly to his waist. A slow flush spreads across Steve's chest, the man's cock pressed hard against Tony. So close and searingly hot—but not enough. The Haze chooses that moment to strike him hard, making Tony move without thought and rolling his hips experimentally. The jut of Steve's cock presses against his own. It pulls a moan from his lips at the abrupt spasm of pleasure that shoots through him; Steve dragging a breath in as his mouth parts, his already flushed cheeks deepening in its rouge color, the Alpha’s grip tightening.
A beat of silence, then.
he thinks petulantly. His inner omega can’t help but agreeing, cut short from basking in the alpha’s attentions.
The thought draws heat to his cheeks, a wetness pooling deep down—not a whole lot to alert the Alpha, but enough to make Tony feel stupidly abashed because
He remembers reading a line from Jenny's perspective in his book, regarding the Haze. '
Tony's eyes flutter against his cheeks, blinking slowly past the intensity of realizing Steve is inside him—where no one else has ever been— and aside from the pain twinging within, how fucking good and
. Of course he already knew that, but the heady thought sends a wave of omega pheromones washing over him, lulling him deeper into its tide. He is ready, feels it innately, like sweet Jenny from the book with her famished alpha. A deep desire unraveling, letting loose, his own body gushing more slick around Steve's girth, wanting a move on.
Like the BIGGEST SMILE ever.
A twist of his wrist, a suckle on the tip. No teeth, though. Teeth is bad. Teeth will hurt. But when Tony swallows him down again—Steve hitting the back of his throat and making him gag, the width of him barely fitting into his mouth.
"I thought you were a genius, Tony," The Alpha teases, a call to Tony's earlier boast. "The Haze ring any bells?”
wants
Tony swallows, silently praying to whatever deity out there who will listen to him after all the raving he did about religion, that it won't filter past the material of his pants and leach into the sofa. But the slick from earlier is still drying. He knew he should have donned his scent-blocking body wash. It would've at least lessened his scent of arousal, but Howard insisted he went without for their meeting with Tiberius to ensure his chances of success. Tony hated every second of it. Hated how Stone watched him.
Then he feels the grazing of fingers, slipping past his cock and straight below to where his cunt is, fingers gently spreading him, dipping into the slick gathered there.
to, Tony. The proper way."
"Do you have any idea," the Alpha begins, running his eyes along the length of him, his stare like a physical caress. "How difficult it is to resist you?"
remembering the words are almost enough to pull him back under, but Steve breaks their kiss and looks deep into his eyes, commanding Tony’s will to focus. He can feel the Alpha hard and wanting against his thigh. A reflection of his own need to be filled.
There are shock waves of sheer ecstasy starting from the heartbeat between his thighs and spilling into each nerve-ending in his body, an all-encompassing pleasure hitting him everywhere. He tenses around Steve's cock, his own spurting cum and coating both of their bellies. He thinks he is going to sag from the relief of it like before, but Steve continues driving into him, merciless, shoving Tony further over the edge and higher into the clouds. The pleasure of it overwhelming and bordering on pain—but it's too
The colonel sat on the bed, his hand resting on Tony's arm. Steve was hovering behind.
"They said you didn't want to be examined."
Tony raised a clean thumb to his eyebrows and eased Steve's frown. Surprisingly, he let him.
"Is there anything to talk about?"
"Isn't it always," the sound was muffled by a pillow, Tony guessed.
Tony was starting to doze off when he heard Steve's breathing changing, and shuffling under the cover.
"Yeah, and I'm sure Ned told his parents he was at your place."
Everything is fine.
Tony took a step back, taken aback by the sudden change of ton. Steve noticed too, because he paused and took a deep, shaky breath.
"They're gonna find us."
"Tony he's your son too, let's try share custody, you don't have to -"
"Yeah, it's more your area of expertise, dumb teenage things."
Some people were outside of the house, mostly smokers, given the low temperatures, that didn't seem to either recognize him or care that a 50 years old man sneaked in a highschool party. He got inside the packed house, the noise and the music ringing his hears. He pushed through the crowd, none of the kids were much older than Peter. He entered what had to be the living room. A kid tripped on his feet and bumped in Tony, half of his beer landing on Tony's shirt. The day couldn't get any better. He cursed more that he should in front of highschoolers. The kid stumbled forwards and Tony held him up and started swimming through the people again. He spotted a flight of stairs, the lower half invaded by the kids, and climbed upstairs.
"You're the best heater I've ever had it's crazy."
"You just lost your parents-"
Water was sipping inside the suit, from the leg the alien had destroyed, and all the little gaps Tony hadn't thought to render waterproof. Water was awfully close to the arc reactor, JARVIS told him.
"Are okay Dad?"
So he entered the kitchen. His dad was sat the table, back to Peter. He was still in the weird pyjamas he wore to work ('To be more comfortable in the armor, Peter'.) but it wasn't black and clean like usual, there was dust on it and it was torn in some places, where Peter could see some red peaking underneath. His shoulders were shaking.
He pushed Ned on the the backseat and put his seat belt on. The kid's head lolled against the window and he fell asleep again, nose scrunched up on the window.
The room was clean and ordered. Nothing was out of place. Even the frames on the dresser were perfectly angled. 5 years old Peter looked at him with a giant smile and a big teddy bear tucked in his arms. Tony was surprised to find their wedding photo on the wall. The one in front of a giant wedding cake, Steve holding a plate with a piece and a spoon full of whiped cream colliding with Tony's nose. Tony held his breath as he got closer. Steve hadn't change much in two decades. A little wrikle here and there around his eyes, his frekles had darkened slightly where the sun hit the most and, if you looked closely, a few lighter streak of hair on his temples. Tony rarely felt his age as much as he did now, watching his younger self's mock indignation at the wiped cream.
He had been abducted with Steve and put in a giant fridge. One or two degrees below freezing, if his internal thermometer was right. The edges of the arc reactor were burning him and the light jacket he was wearing wasn't doing much. They had tried to force the huge door, but even the super soldier's strength hasn't been enough to open it. Iron man could have cracked it, with one or two reactor blasts. Tony stark was, on the other hand, useless.
He wasn't sure himself. He had tried to work. To distract himself from something. He didn't remember what.
"What, I should have let E.T. smash you with a 2 tons hammer ?"
Those damn tears wouldn't stop. Peter's hand, covered by the long black sleeves, came on Tony's knee. He looked up to him, his big brown eyes behind blond curls.
"Pete? Peter, why do you have pop's phone?"
"You okay?"
Flashes of a cave, cold and dark, passed before his eyes. Faces distorted by water and phrases in langages he didn't understand muffled by screams and pleads. Obi was there too, hovering in the background, making sure the job he'd paid for was done correctly.
"Give me your phone," he said in a tone that didn't leave room for argument. Steve had that military way of dealing with Peter, or anything, really.
"The press heard about your hospitalisation. So as far as they're concerned, you overworked yourself."
Steve told him once he would go to rehabilitation they'll try share custody. He was craving for a bottle of scotch.
He had tried. He had tried so hard. But that was expecting too much of him. The glass of scotch was mocking him from his desk. He had throw 6 years of soberty away when Steve had told him he wanted a divorce. He was too busy to care, too miserable to try again. He finished his drink.
He didn't open the box. He poured all his bottles into the sink. He had done that before. He had just bought new bottles, in the end. This time, this time it would different. This time, it was the last time. He tried not to think about all the times it had been his last time. He sat at his desk, working on the things that had accumulated during his absence. He was craving for a bottle of scotch.
He tries to stop moving and turning, with poor results. Steve is sound asleep next to him, the lucky bastard. It's not that it's a rare occurrence, no, Tony's well aquainted with sleepless nights. He has been since he was 5. It's either the stress, the parties or a surge of ideas in the middle of the night. But it's been four days that he hasn't been sleeping more than 3 hours at night for no reason. He now knows Steve's ceiling by heart, every little imperfections, every trace of old infiltrations, illuminated by the arc reactor. Steve's breathing pattern. Steve's scrunched nose when he's about to wake up. Steve's frown when he's dreaming of unpleasant things. The hunch of his shoulders when it's a full blown nightmare.
"You're gonna tell me what woke you up?"
"Dad-"
"Don't, not now, please."
"Dad?"
"Don't worry. You got me out of a very boring mission in the middle of nowhere."
Tony wanted to go back to sleep. He would ask where he was or why his friend had traveled through the ocean latter. He closed his eyes, slowly drifting away.
"Not astrophysics?"
"Peter? Why aren't you in bed?" he asked, throat tight and too dry.
"Will you too shut up?"
"Okay. If you need to talk, you know you can call me." he nodded, even though they both knew he would never take the offer. "Here, I wanted you to see this, and work on it. Due for friday."
His free hand circled Tony's waist, and found its way under Tony's shirt. Steve trailed kisses on his neck, excruciatingly slow. Tony wanted to turn around but he couldn't, his hands deep on the soapy water, and he knew Steve was taking advantage of this. He peeled himself off of Tony a second to find a tea towel and dried his hand up before circling Tony's waist once again. He started off where he'd left, his mouth finding its way along Tony's neck and shoulder.
Steve's voice started to be shaky.
"Peper told me."
Tony clunched the blanket. He took a few sips of coffee.
He clenched the counter, Steve's knuckles turning white with strain. Tony stepped back until his legs hit a chair.
"Ow come on! You cheated on him, and then left him! What did you expect?!"
"You good?"
"Not like I do. He is neither of those things."
"Go home, take a shower, sleep. You've been in there for two days."
"A bit? Really?"
Tony used to be there when Peter had nightmare, or when he couldn't sleep. He used to be there. And sober.
"What are you doing?"
Peter mumbled an apology in his cereals an excused himself after he finished, saying he'd check if Ned was still alive.
"Mmh? What are you doing here?"
Tony felt Peter nod in the crook of his neck, curls brushing against his bird and getting stuck.
Steve had turned around the table and put a grounding hand on Tony's shoulder. He squeezed until Tony acknowledged him with a nod.
"It's okay to cry, honey. If you need it or if you feel like it..." His dad paused, debating whether to continue his sentence or not. "My father had outdated views on a lot of things and he didn't think crying was an okay thing to do. And I just..." He vaguely gestured to himself, with the face he made when he was looking for simpler words for Peter. "I started to believe him?"
"Why what?"
"Not a big deal ?! You've gotta be kid-"
There were something she wanted to say, but she pressed her lips together in a thin line. She exchanged a look with James.
"Until now. "
That voice. He knew it too. In a different way. More intimate. More intense. That voice was what he tried to distract himself from. Why would he, though?
James disappeared. Tony knew he wouldn't see his friend for months.
He pours the yellowish liquid in the first glass he finds drying next to the sink, maybe the equivalent of 2 or 3 shots. He downs it in one go. He doesn't waste time to dwell on the fact that kitchen rum is really awful to drink. The rum burns his throat and his chest. He lets out a sigh of relief and refill his glass.
He was curled on himself, his knees under his chin. If it wouldn't warm the arc reactor, he could press against his chest until the pain from the pressure was higher than the one from the burn. Steve was somewhere behind him.
And then it all went to shit.
"Like shit. What happened?"
"I would worry about someone else if I were you. That was incredibly stupid-"
He slowly opened his eyes. White lights appeared, burning like hell. He forced himself to keep them opened. When he had accommodated to the neons, he turned his head to the left, to see a sleeping colonel.
His dad pulled up the covers on Peter's shoulders. The Hawkeye lamp on his bedside table illuminated the room in a soft purple light.
"Hey don't..."
" Of course not. "
"I know you don't like being touched, but body heat."
"Not really."
"Yeah?"
"My point is, I'm never going to be okay with you drinking. I know it's not entirely rationnal, I know that drinking a beer once in a while will not cause problem but I can't help it. And when you called last night I thought- I thought you were walking in my shitty footsteps and I freaked out, but I'm glad you called, and that you trusted me enough to call. And I'm sorry I reacted that way, it wasn't... I shouldn't have."
"I don't know. He thought it was a girl thing and he didn't think girls were as good as boys. Or something like that"
"I'm sorry you had to see that. No, I just want to talk to him."
"We're Thursday, Tony"
His dad sniffed again and wiped his cheeks with his long sleeve.
Tony squeezed back and snuggled against husband.
"Friday, make sure his phone rings," he said as he tucked the phone to his ear.
He hadn't gone to the board meeting, nor did he to the aa one. He had locked the workshop down, had opened his hidden cabinet near the tool table and popped a few pills with his scotch. The project due to the next day was slowly taking form, not near as far as it would usually go.
"You okay?" Peter reiterated.
"You're a grandpa."
He tried light-hearted tone.
Rhodey's hand squeezed his arm.
It took Tony a good second to get where the question came from, and then looked down at his shirt, as to make sure it was what Steve was talking about.
"Tony."
Steve completely ignored me and made for a bee line to the sink. He took out a glass and filled it up with water. Tony couldn't shake the feeling that this day wasn't going to end well, as he expected when the doctor told him, oh surprise, that he was fine and good to go.
