Steve’s mind wandered through the possibilities for most of the rest of the flight.  By the time they got off the plane, collected their bags, and got a cab back to Brock’s apartment, it was too late to do much of anything except change out of their clothes and fall into bed.  They didn’t even bother to upack.  Steve took the check out of his pocket and looked at it once under the light of his phone before he sat both down on the bedside table.
“I’m going to try something. I think it will help you relax,” Steve informed him.
“Shut up.  What happened?” Bucky said, cutting him off.
But, he couldn’t help leaning forward enough to bend his head into the center of Steve’s chest, leaving the back of his neck exposed. Not that he thought Steve would do anything, of course, but just because it felt good.  His Alpha was pleased with him.  He was helping, and even if Steve didn’t want him like Tony wanted him, it still fulfilled some deep-seated need to offer comfort to his Alpha.
“I don’t know if I should like sailing, anyway,” Cam said. Steve could almost hear the frown in the boy’s voice. “Do you think I would like the Free States? What is it like there?”
“Personal reasons?” Tony snorted.
“So, we’re really not going to do this?” Tony asked, somewhat incredulously. “I came all the way down to…wherever the hell I am, and now, you’re saying the deal is off?   You have got to be kidding me,” Tony spat out, a grimace flattening his mouth into a thin line.
“How can I?  You’re taking all the stupid with you,” Steve replied by rote. Bucky huffed out a low laugh and laid back down on the bed.
“Don’t blame me, Pepper made the schedule,” Tony shrugged.  “At least the mine is interesting,” he added, walking over to nudge Steve’s legs over far enough on the bed so that he could sit down.
“A divorce?  Are you kidding? Of course I don’t want a damn divorce, Steve. I love you, you giant, noble idiot!” Tony shouted, standing up fast enough to nearly knock Steve off his feet.  “I want in.”
“Please,” Steve whined. “Please. Want you inside me.” It really wasn’t his fault that Steve could make such reasonable counterarguments, Tony thought, letting the groin piece snap off. There had been a slight design flaw that he’d noted with the armor during a battle shortly after he and Steve Bonded. Of course, Tony had remedied that almost immediately. He fumbled for a moment to get his cock out where it strained against his pants, but finally managed.
“No…no, it’s—I want to.  To tell you,” Steve insisted.
“Yeah?” Tony blurted out in surprise.
“Speaking of Coulson, I need to swing by SHIELD,” Steve said as they walked out into the too-bright sunlight.  “Just for a bit.  You can visit the R&D department, if you want.”
Steve vaguely remembered passing through the gate on his way into the city, watching a monkey delight a gaggle of children and collect coins in reward.  A small, bitter laugh escaped him, causing Cam to look his way, though he shook his head and dropped his eyes down from the bright burn of the sun on the rock.
“Great. Wonderful. Man in Tights,  the world’s surliest detective, your gym buddy, and the dude who cuts Sam’s hair all know about what my husband is up to, but not me,” Tony spat out, tossing up his hands.  “Does Nat know?  Of course she does, what am I saying.  So, everyone except me gets to know about what my husband is up to when he’s supposed to be going to therapy or whatever down at the VA!”
“No—no, you don’t just hit—you’re messing with me. Again.  Good luck when you can’t get on the Wi-Fi,” Tony grumped.
“Yes, you do,” Steve said with a tired sort of acceptance.  “You should meet Agent Coulson.  I think the two of you would get along.”
Steve sucked in a deep, bracing breath and put his hands to his hips, letting his chin sink down to his chest, then glanced around again.
“I’m good, Tony,” Steve repeated, though he reached out, plucked a few of the deep, purple grapes and popped them into his mouth.  “A little sore.  Not bad, though. Good-sore, I think.”
Steve released a shuddering breath, then closed his eyes let his head fall back against the cradle of Tony’s shoulder, both a surrender and a plea, because it was dark against his eyelids, and he wanted desperately for it to stay that way. He felt Tony shift behind him, the metal of the disc a sudden coolness against the heated skin of his back. Tony kissed the side of Steve’s head, hard and fierce, then moved the hand fisted over Steve’s heart down to cup the hard length of Steve’s cock, just holding it in his palm, warm and slick with the oil someone, probably Jarvis, Steve realized with a rush of embarrassment, kept atop a low candle by the bedside. It felt good, just to be held, touched like that.
to me,” Hammer grated out. Steve felt the hand in his hair give a sharp, brutal twist and jerk him forward.  Hammer’s other hand came up to cup Steve’s chin.  His thumb traced the seam of Steve’s mouth, then pulled down.  “Open,” Hammer ordered, his eyes narrowing on Steve.
He wasn’t sure when he drifted off.  He didn’t mean to do anything more than just close his eyes for a moment.  But, he must have slept.  He knew that, because waking up to two-hundred and forty pounds of supersoldier clutching a towel around his waist and leaping off of your lap, slamming through a coffee table and leaving a large dent in the drywall tends to wake one up, no matter how well you were sleeping.
“Oh, er, ah.  Yes.  Yes, Tony, we were just saying that…” Jarvis began, then clamped his mouth shut and looked helplessly over at his wife.
Tony felt Steve’s hand at his waist tighten, just barely a hold, but it was enough he could legitimately take it for a signal.  “Music, J,” Tony ordered softly, hearing the first strains echo through the room almost immediately.  He started to sway, shifting a bit closer to Steve when Steve continued to stand stock-still.  “Just move.  Nothing complicated,” Tony urged.  “Just a dance.  Won’t even ask you to dip me,” Tony said, trying to lighten the mood, though the words came out almost strangled, sticking in the back of his thoat.
“Uh, what?” Tony spluttered uselessly, looking between Pepper and Rhodey in confusion.
Nothing good ever comes from snooping, wasn't that what they said? He wasn't even sure what he was looking for exactly.  Answers to questions his mind was still trying to form, that was part of it, sure.  But there was also a desire to know, to know Steve, this Steve, the one who went off to war and came home to the same life he left, with everything except Tony in it.  It wasn't as if Steve was going to tell him anything, not with Barnes playing Gatekeeper to Nat's Keymaster, like two angry, vodka-swilling sentries.  It wasn't an excuse, or even really an explanation, for why he didn't step right back outside Steve's door and wait like a normal person, but it was a reason.  Since he was already going to hell anyway, he gingerly opened the lid to one of the cardboard banker boxes and peered inside. Rows of folders were lined up in some kind of order, probably vaguely chronological, since it started with Army and ended in tab after tab labeled VA/Medical in Steve’s neat print. Tony closed the lid without looking further, a frown creasing his forehead and something that felt a lot like guilt, however misplaced it might be, making his stomach clench and turn over. What happened to Steve was not his fault. Hazard of Army life and all that.
“Well, let’s just say you haven’t seen it yet,” Steve replied, trying to find some humor in the old joke, but it just came out grim and tired sounding.
Slowly, deliberately, Steve leaned down and captured Tony’s mouth in a long, lingering kiss.  As he pulled away, he started to push the boxers down over his hips in a long, slow slide. His cock, red and hard with strain, bobbed up as soon as it was freed.  Tony’s eyes dropped, following the motion. He licked his lips, where Steve’s had been just a moment ago. Tony watched, fixated, until the boxers reached the floor, then seemed to drag his gaze slowly back up Steve’s body, like he was trying to commit it to memory,  until he finally met Steve’s eyes.
Tony, and it was horrible and Tony couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t get air and everything was too loud and too close, pressing in on him, and there was no room, no space, and it
Steve’s grip on the table was almost painful, would have been except he couldn’t feel anything except the way the King’s mouth felt as he drew Steve’s cock in deeper again, deeper this time than before, until Steve felt a slight shift as he slid all the way down the King’s throat.  The King swallowed around him once, the motion constricting and then releasing around Steve’s cock, then pulled back and let Steve’s cock slide almost all the way out before the King’s lips caught around the head and sucked hard.  He looked up at Steve with a wicked gleam in his eye and reached one hand between Steve’s legs, just behind his balls and pressed the pad of his thumb into the smooth skin there.
He could see them, the way Steve’s blonde head hung listlessly in Thor’s arms, hear it, in the heavy echo of Thor’s steps on the jet’s ramp as he carried Steve inside the jet, but there was an unreality to it, like his mind couldn’t process what he was seeing fast enough.  Bruce was barking orders that registered only as background noise behind the ringing in his ears, one hand squeezing at a plastic bag that seemed to cover Steve’s nose and mouth.  Natasha was asking quick, rapid-fire questions and grabbing various things from their medical supplies, but it was all happening out there, in some other place, because it couldn’t quite gain purchase in his mind, which just kept repeating the same mantra over and over.
Steve wondered if it was Natasha who had suggested Anthony for him to consider.  A favor for an old friend, that’s what Fury had said about putting the file into the stack the doctor had given Steve. Steve had assumed Fury meant the father, but with Fury, anything was possible. He knew Nat and Fury went back a number of years, but he hadn’t really considered her someone who would intercede like that, though he supposed he didn’t really know her all that well.  If it was even possible to know her all that well.
“Morning,” Steve nodded in greeting and started adjusting the weights on one of the machines.
“Tony tells me you are a good man, which is high praise, coming from him, I assure you,” Jarvis said.  “I only want what is best for him.”
“No,” Tony cut him off. “Not now. Not tonight.”
“Because you think differently,” Jarvis replied evenly.  “Than those people.”
“I—yeah.  Yeah, she’s sure. She wouldn’t have called if she wasn’t.  So…so, I guess you should probably—shit, Stevie, I’m—this is my fault,” Bucky muttered, flopping down in the overstuffed chair next to the sofa.  “I’m sorry, man, but you know it’s gonna get out there.”
“I don’t want to live my life not doing the things I want to do, even if everything isn’t exactly the way I’d want it, I suppose is what I mean,” Steve continued, his voice dipping low and soft.  He wasn’t sure if he was even talking to Shellhead as much as himself anymore, but it felt like it needed to be said.
“Don’t worry, Tony, just stay with me,” Steve urged, his voice strong and firm.  It was an order, Tony recognized, and the thought somehow made him almost giddy with happiness. Technically, that was probably the lack of oxygen, but whatever. Steve was alive, and Steve was
“Do you have any idea how much sugar is in those things?” Tony asked.
“Hey, hey, who said anything about losing anyone?” Steve demanded, pulling back and twisting around enough to bring his hands up to the sides of Tony’s face.
“Having a good day?” Steve asked with what Tony recognized as a forced attempt at a smile.
“Detoured weapons?” Steve asked, brows drawing together in confusion.
He got one hand around Tony’s waist and the other under one arm and around his back, then lifted to find the right angle.  Tony tightened his legs around Steve’s waist, his knees digging into Steve’s sides, and for a moment, as the head of his cock caught against the rim of Tony’s entrance, then slid down and in, Steve lost his breath, the air rushing out of him as Tony sank down on him, taking him all the way in until he was buried to the hilt.  Tony hadn’t looked away from him the whole time, the slight moue that his mouth formed and the way his nostrils flared and eyes glittered, sharp and vaguely predatory, the only change to his expression.
“Yeah. We worked something out, alright. That’s one way to put it,” Tony said with a harsh twist to his words. “If we’d worked it out, he wouldn’t be here.  I like your way of working things out, though.  We should’ve tried it sooner,” he said with a short, bitter laugh.  “That’s nice,” Tony said, nodding down towards his knee, where Steve realized he had been rubbing circles against the knob of bone there.  He stopped, caught Tony’s eye, felt the other Steves watching him, then slowly started to rub the skin again.
Cam grinned and took his place on a cushioned ottoman by the dais.  “You are brave and strong, Your Highness. You have been trained by the finest knights since you were a boy.  You will show him.”
“Intellicrops, huh?” Steve said, wiping a laugh away with his hand.
“Okay, show’s over, people,” Rumlow announced.
Steve looked up at him.  He was curled against Tony’s thighs, while Tony stroked his skin, leaning over him and letting his sweat-damp hair fall over his forehead, curling a little there and at the nape, the way Steve liked.  His eyes were soft and full of a gentle yearning, like he was looking at something fragile and precious, and Steve thought he should tell Tony that it was just him, just Steve Rogers, and he didn’t need to be looked at like that, but he held his tongue. Even if he wanted to say the words, he didn’t think he could.
“This is far enough.  Fan out here, but go no further,” Tony said to Josiah.
Walking back to his room had taken on a kind of solemnity over these last few days that Steve associated more with preparing for battle than a simple stroll, but he could almost feel whatever carapace enveloped him in Tony’s chambers slowly slough away as he left the hallway for the tunnel to Zola’s compound.  When had he stopped looking at the suits of armor that lined the hall?  When had he stopped counting his steps?  When had he forgotten to measure the length of the torches that burned in their cradles and marked the last time someone had come this way?  It was harder, each time, and Steve knew if he wasn’t careful, one day, he wouldn’t truly leave at all, and that thought alone was enough to sober the lingering sluggishness from his mind.
“Oh,” Tony replied dumbly, slow blinking at Steve to make sure he understood.  “Oh, okay. Thanks. Thank you.  That’s…I’ll have Pepper send over a key to my place.  And a keycard for the Tower.  That’ll let you have unlimited access.  So.  You could stop by. Whenever you wanted.  Not that you have to.  No pressure.  Because, I’m wooing.  See?  Still wooing. But, you could, is all.”
“Nasha, Bucky, he…” Steve sighed, shaking his head. Tony looked over at his Alpha, his chest squeezing painfully at Steve’s words. He knew how much it pained Steve to talk about the friend he lost. “I’m sorry. I tried to keep him safe.”
“Yeah… that’s not really gonna matter,” Bucky said with a grin.  “Don’t worry,” he added at Steve’s expression.  “You know she can handle herself.”
“You know that I can see you looking at me through there,” the man announced with an annoyed frown, making Steve jerk his eye away from the apartment door’s peephole and stagger back a few steps, nearly tripping over his half-opened backpack.   “I’ll give you ‘til the count of three, and then I’m gone.  One,” the man began.
“You can never return,” Tyber said.  “You will be dead to everyone. Including Jhrvis.”
is here now. With me. With us. What becomes of the Free States is not your concern anymore. You served them, and served them well. It is time to move on, is that not what you meant back at the oasis? Is that not what you want? We can have that, Steve, we can have everything! Each other. Cam. Peter. We can make changes, together—have I not been willing to bend? But, if you let the past rule you, it could destroy what we have, you must see that.”
“Good,” Tony agreed.  “Come,” Tony commanded, though his voice was gentle now that his attention was back on Steve.  “It has been a long afternoon.  I’m hot, and I stink of horse,” Tony said with a brisk laugh.
“Merry Christmas,” Tony replied. “Thanks again for the present, Uncle Obie.”
He thought it would be wonderful, though. If he thought about it.   Which he didn’t. But, if he did, he would think it would be wonderful.  They’d brought Omegas to him during the war sometimes. The war had been long, and the able-bodied Alphas were off fighting, for the most part.  Now, they have medications, apparently. That was what one of the Strike Team mentioned letting his Omega use. But then…he remembered how much they had needed him.  Shy at first. Embarrassed, but desperate enough to agree. Then less shy. Steve had liked that, watching them grow needy and demanding with it as they cycled through their Heat, then soft and pliant under him.  It felt good to take care of them, of course, and he’d liked it, but they’d belonged to someone else or no one at all, but not him, and they both always knew that. It was different. He knew it, and they knew it. It hadn’t meant anything, not really.  Just a fleeting moment of pleasure in between horrors.
And now—fuck. Now, Tony’s car is at the bottom of a cliff because…because he said he wanted the damn thing there.  No. No, that’s not—fuck.  That’s not what happened.  None of this made sense.  It was all too jumbled in his head to parse out, like someone had upended the Scrabble tiles and all that were right-side up were the Zs and Xes.  He couldn’t do anything with what his brain had to work with.
“Ah…let’s call it a glass paperweight,” Steve laughed, solid and genuine.  “They start you with just getting a feel for the way the heat works on the glass, how to move the blower, that kind of thing.  So, it kind of turned out to be a glob.  Bucky has it on his desk.  Calls it a high-class pet rock.  Nat kept moving it around the apartment and leaving it in random places, driving Buck crazy, so he got it mounted on this pedestal thing.  Then, she put some of those googly eyes and a little bow on it and had the pedestal engraved with Pretty Pretty Princess Award, and now he blames me.”
“Thought,” Steve started, then had to stop and draw in a breath of air to his parched lungs.  “Thought you wouldn’t kiss.  Or something.”
,” Anthony added, canting his head to one side as he had in the picture.  “
By the time they arrived at Tony’s house, Steve’s whole body was thrumming with tension.  He wasn’t sure if he wanted to strangle Tony or kiss him or maybe a bit of both.  Why hadn’t Tony just asked him about Bucky?  Because the man thought he knew too much for his own good?
“You’re using your powers for good,” Tony agreed, slapping Bruce on the shoulder with one hand. “What? Steve really loves those spring rolls.”
“You’re really going to love the island, by the way,” Tony promised. It made his heart swell that Steve was so overcome that he was slowly banging his head against the wall above the pass-through slot.  He should really stop that though.  They were probably going to need to stand like this for a long time.  He should see about getting Steve a magazine.  Maybe that one from Time where he was named Man of the Year. But it really wouldn’t be a good idea to move just yet.
“You designed the armor. I, ah—I like it.  Always have. It’s beautiful.  The lines, the colors, the way it moves,” Steve said, and Stark nodded, dropping the burger back down to his plate and wiping the napkin from his lap over his mouth.  “The first time I saw it, I remember thinking, that was it. That was what the future was supposed to look like, not this—I mean, it was just, you know, really, ah… impressive.”
First time for everything, Tony supposed, sucking in a warm, clean breath of air.
So did the bone-lion.
“I’m thinking,” Tony replied.  “My mom,” he said, sucking in a shaky breath. He wiped a hand across his eyes.
Coulson was waiting when they arrived back at SHIELD.  He made some quick small talk with Allen, then waved him off, turning back to Steve as they walked up the steps to the doors marked by SHIELD’s emblem and a “No Unauthorized Visitors” sign etched into the glass.
Steve knew Tony wasn’t particularly discriminating about his partners, at least before Ms. Potts.  Early on, when Steve was first out of the ice, someone at SHIELD made sure Steve saw the videos, though he had clicked away as soon as he realized what he was seeing.  It had felt intrusive. Tony was Howard’s son, after all, a possible teammate, someone who had already done his fair share to keep the world safe, and—well, Steve hadn’t liked it.  But it had told him enough to know that Tony wasn’t what they called straight these days, not that Tony ever tried to hide anything, really. He seemed to prefer to shove it in people’s faces first, like some kind of preemptive strike.  Steve wondered, now, seeing him like this, if that’s exactly what it had been.
“Would you?” Tony asked in surprise.  “You don’t have to.  But, yeah.  I’d like that.”
He heard a cheer erupt, splitting the solemn air as their friends whooped and hollered. Steve brought their bound hands up, hands still joined and pulled Tony into a searing kiss.  If anything, the noise behind them got louder, but it barely registered.  There was Tony, only Tony, and he was everything.  They walked out of the Sept together.  The soldiers were gathered outside, and as soon as he and Tony exited, they knelt behind their swords, heads bowed in a show of fealty that they had already shown with far greater surety earlier that day.
“One of them offered to bust me out of here and then demanded bath soaps,” Steve replied.
“A political arrangement, I told you,” Tony said with blithe wave of his hand.  “You’ve no need to be concerned.  You must know that by now,” he added, voice going low and soft.  “Is
“Feels a little like Coulson decorated,” Steve commented with a huff of a laugh.
“Sorry about Bucky,” Steve offered after a pause, darting a quick look in Tony’s direction.  “I’ll get the papers done,” he promised, pushing open the building’s door as he did.
“A Hero Reborn,” Maria supplied.
“It’s difficult for Omegas to eat a whole lot during Heat, and with Steve’s metabolism, it will be even more of an issue, so right now Tony’s hindbrain is basically telling him to feed Cap, you know, carb him up like before a race,” Bruce yelled in explanation from the other side of the Steve Zone.  It was okay to say to himself, Tony allowed.  Steve Zone.  Steve Zone.  It really did have a nice ring to it. He’d have Jarvis throw out some explanatory graphics over the video feeds and send it to the team.  They would probably appreciate the visual.  Wow, Steve’s helpfulness was really rubbing off on him.
It was impossible not to imagine Steve making the same trek out here, though somehow Tony doubted Steve, riding up on his bike or walking up from one of the bus stops they passed on the way out here, had received quite the same welcome.  Steve, who was no one and everyone who mattered, who would have come out here, maybe with Barnes, but probably not.  Probably by himself, Tony decided as a wall of air conditioning and track lighting hit him.  He blinked and pocketed his sunglasses, shooting Pepper another look, though she had her head bowed to read something on her phone.
Anthony said. Steve could see him reflected in the glass, sitting in the chair Steve had just vacated.
Two guards with two doors.  One can only tell the truth.  One can only tell lies.  One door leads to death.  One door leads to freedom.  Problem was figuring out which was which.  But, there was a door, and he had to go through it.  He’d never shied away from choosing, until now, when it felt too much like a choice.
“This…all of this, it must be hard on you,” Rhodes started, flattening his mouth as if he didn’t care for the taste of the words.  “Going from a soldier to…this,” he said, motioning into the air.
“I did,” Tony replied.  He walked over to sit next to Steve on the thin mattress, one hand skating lightly down Steve’s back.  Steve glanced over at him, then back down to his lap, where he dropped the thread and made a fist against his thigh.
“As it happens, I only saw him for the first time tonight,” the man said, as relief gutted through Steve. “Though, I...very much regret that I did not have the chance to meet him sooner.  I have not been back this way for some time, you see.”
“Well, I suppose I should thank this right person for never showing up, then,” Tony said in a tight, bitter voice.
Tony. They were talking about Tony.
“On a purely professional level, unless you’re agreeing, in which case there might be coffee involved,” Stark said, nodding his head back and forth, as if just now considering the possibility.
“Well, we’ll…” Tony started, then stopped because he actually had no idea what to do about that. Bruce was the serum expert. He just built stuff for Steve to throw or otherwise mangle. So what, exactly, he would do about this, he had no idea. Fix it sounded wrong somehow, and he found himself oddly resistant to suggest that. The serum had corrected Steve’s ailments, but it hadn’t ‘fixed’ Steve. There hadn’t been anything to fix, wasn’t that Erkine’s whole point and the unfortunate lesson Bruce had learned the hard way? “We’ll figure it out,” Tony finally settled on, having nothing more to offer at the moment.
“Sorry,” Tony said as he took his seat again.  “Duty called and all that.”
Steve nodded slowly, the motion strangely difficult, as if he had forgotten how to do it.  He stood.  Unbelted the robe and let it fall away.  Heat from the fireplace danced across his skin, adding real warmth to the heat that flowed to his skin from embarrassment.  He was nude underneath, except for the gold bands on his upper arms that he almost always wore and his collar, the weight of which almost went unnoticed until now, when it was all he had.  It felt good, the weight of it, like it kept him tethered in place somehow.  Anchored him.  He should hate it, chafe against it, but he didn’t.  Not here, anyway.  It meant something between them, at least in here, though he didn’t know why or if that even mattered.  He felt it, though, as sure as he felt the heat of Tony’s gaze, in a way he couldn’t quantify or name, but was nonetheless real for it.
Shellhead.
, Steve though idly.  He looked up at Tony and with a punchdrunk grin, just offered an apologetic “Oops.”
Tony switched to Steve’s other nipple, giving it the same treatment, while his hand rolled and tugged at the sensitive nub he had just left.  Steve choked out a moan, hands going to the back of Tony’s hair, though to pull him away or hold him in place, he wasn’t sure.  He settled for threading his hands through Tony’s hair and trying to breath, a far taller order than it should be.
It surprised him just how much he despised the man, though it probably shouldn’t have.  This man had used Tony for his own gain. Toyed with his affections, then rejected him as soon as he had what he wanted, which was apparently a lordship and the lands and income that went with it.  Quite a boon for a lowly Sir to end up a landed Lord, and all he had to do was make Tony fall in love with him then leave him as soon as he had what he wanted from him. This man held Tony’s regard and threw it back in his face, and Steve hated him for it.
Slowly, deliberately, Steve did as he had been told.  He rested his forehead against the cool, pitted stone.  He put his hands up, flat against the wall. Spread his feet apart.  His cock jutted out from between his legs, lifting the chains around it in an obscene fashion.  He could feel the chains slide over the curve of his ass, though the position left the bottom exposed and open.  Arousal curled deep within him. The head of his cock spurted fluid, just at the new position. At knowing what was coming.  At wanting it. Needing it. He should be embarrassed. He was, but…it was good somehow, too.
“My—my file?” Steve asked, frown deepening.  He sat up, body coiling tight, going rigid.  “That’s—there’s nothing, I mean, it’s just the same—”
“Okay.”
He took a long, steadying breath.  Do not, do not, do not lose it in front of Steve.  Don’t look at him.
“Nugh,” Steve said as he looked down at Tony, which he sincerely hoped Tony understood as something along the lines of thank-you-oh-my-god-that-was-amazing-I-want-to-sit-on-a-park-bench-and-critique-philosophy-and-discuss-Heinlein-and-please-do-that-again-forever.
“Tony, of course, you don’t have to,” Steve interrupted. “I can walk just fine. It’s not a big deal. Really,” Steve assured him quickly.
“Your Highness,” Rhodes said, “I merely think that you are a very tempting target, and---”
Tony could see his mom start to form the words to ask what damage, when everything went a blur of motion and a loud cracking sound rent the air.  Tony jumped out of the way before he realized what he was moving away from, then looked down.  The desk was split into two parts, both folded in like two cards, with Tony’s father on the floor between them.  Howard’s head lolled to the side, a smattering of papers blanketing him as the tumbler of Scotch rolled across the floor, leaving a trail of droplets.  Tony watched it with an eerie sort of fascination until it came to a rest by Howard’s left shoe.
“I’m sorry.  I shouldn’t…I don’t mean to put this on you,” Steve said gruffly, mouth flattening into a thin line.
“Suppose we should toast.  For luck,” Steve suggested with what he hoped was a conciliatory tone.  Tony stared at the glass for a moment, then held his up and clinked the edge to Steve’s before taking a long drink and setting the glass back down on the table.  He turned to look out the window, shoving his hands in his pockets.  Steve walked over and put his glass on the table as well and then stood next to Tony, looking down at the glittering Strip where it spread out below them.
He should call Bucky back, but Bucky was going to see through all this marriage bullshit in two seconds flat, and he just…didn’t want that.  Not tonight.  Tomorrow, he’d have to deal with it, but for now---for now, it had been a good night.  Surprisingly good.  Maybe it was the food or the alcohol or the jolt of seeing Hammer again like that or something else entirely…something like the fact that if he thought on it, he could remember how Tony’s mouth tasted, honey-sweet from champagne, how it felt, warm and soft against his, the sharp scrape of Tony’s beard offering almost too much of a contrast of sensations…so, really, it could be any number of things, but he was going to let himself have at least this.  Just for tonight. Reality could wait until tomorrow.
“Count it off,” Tony commanded, breathing hard.  “If you lose the count, I’ll start over,” he warned. Steve could hear a slight tremor in his voice.  For a heartbeat, Steve had no idea what he meant, and then he remembered, relief washing over him.
“I-I would never use that against you, Tony, you must know that,” Steve protested, swallowing thickly.  His heart thudded against his chest, raging in his ears.  He didn’t want to hear this.  It had been the one hope he did not dare speak.  And now, it, too, slipped through his fingers. Politics, intrigue, the grasping tenuousness of it all…it would hardly surprise Natasha that these things would be the fights he finally couldn’t win.
Steve watched in fascination for a moment, then reached for the brightly colored blocks, knocking them down.  Which, it turned out, was apparently wonderful and amazing, because as soon as Tony stacked them again, Steve stretched up and repeated the action, sending the blocks tumbling over the side of the tub.
“I won’t do it,” Steve told him. The darkness overhead was deeper now.  He glanced up. There was a circle around the sun like a ring of fire.
.  I’m going to have nightmares for, I don’t know, years, probably.  I would have helped.  Why didn’t—
“So,” Coulson said finally, putting the tablet down on the seat next to him.  “Happy here will be your driver, whenever you need him.  This,” Coulson said, taking out a smartphone, “Is for you.  Happy’s number is in there, and so is mine.  I programmed it with a few other numbers that might be useful—Dr. Reese, pizza place—“
“I didn't—I didn't think you would think—I mean, Coulson handled everything for you, and I left my passcode on the computer. I thought you'd be... pleased? Or, maybe not pleased, that's not, I mean, of course, not that I don't hope you're pleased, but, I guess, maybe relieved is more...damn, I'm not,” Steve stammered, a crease forming between his brow as his mouth flattened into a thin, tight line. It occurred to Tony for the first time that Steve's longer than expected absence may have been deliberately designed to give Tony some time to himself, time to get used to his new situation before his Alpha showed up.
“I don’t want to kill Camp anymore,” Tony said. “Well, okay, that’s not true,” Tony amended in response to Steve’s raised eyebrow.  “But, I won’t.  Because it would be wrong, however wonderfully and completely satisfying.  I really am better now, I think.  I mean, at least I seem to have stopped wanting to bathe your feet.  For now, anyway.  We can talk.  What the hell was all that about, anyway?  I thought bonding hormones were supposed to make you all happy and stoned-like?”
“Yes, Pepper,” Tony replied with a nod.  “Completely and totally not fake-married.  Got it.”
“How do you know this guy, anyway?” Steve asked.
“Good, good,” Tony said to the wind.   This was so pathetically awkward.  He was trying to be normal about this and not scream at anyone who would listen that Steve—God,
The other doctors called it comatose and talked about scales and neurological responses, scans and MRIs.  They spoke in hushed tones, as if by saying it quieter, it would help soften the words themselves.  It didn’t, but Tony supposed there was really no good way to speak words that no one wanted to hear, so you might as well do it quietly.
“What did Stane say to you?” Steve pressed.  “Tony?  What did he say?”
“It’s fine, ma’am.  Sorry to keep you waiting.  We’re right behind you,” Steve said.  His voice wasn’t even shaking, damn him.  Tony’s mind was currently engaged in some toddler-level version of Scrabble where it was just tossing out letter combinations and hoping for a triple-word score.
“Funny,” Steve said.  “Fine,” he muttered, taking a swig of his beer as if he could swallow back the word.   “Fine, I’ll try it.  Once,” he finished, voice dropping with emphasis on the last.  “Just a date, after all. How hard can it be?”
Heat, a real Heat, was nothing like that, as he’d learned last month when his body finally decided it was ready to kill him slowly and painfully for a few days because of one tiny little, utterly useless quirk of genetics.  Fucking fuck, that had been awful.  Hell, he’d have taken Obie and his creepy old man dick by the second day if he could’ve gotten it, but, instead, he’d been given a case of Powerade, some protein bars, a bathtub filled with cool water and a few anatomically questionable toys.  Most of the worst of it was a hazy cycle of pain and need that, thankfully, he could barely remember, except nothing had been enough, no matter what he did, and fuck, he’d tried everything he could to find whatever it was his body demanded, but nothing worked.  Everything he’d tried left him in a frustrated state of over-simulation, chasing a release that he couldn’t quite find no matter how many times he came, until he was empty and open and sore as fuck.  It was never enough.
Tony looked down at his t-shirt with its pink triangle and stained sweats and felt a wave of remembered shame sweep over him.  He liked to tell himself that he didn’t care how he looked, but he knew the way he dressed was as much an act of defiance as anything else, if for no other reason than Howard hated it and his mom despaired of it, and he liked to call it self-expression when it was really a small battle he could fight that didn’t matter to anyone but him, but it did.  It mattered.  When it was one of the few things he had, it mattered, and he hated that he could still feel like he looked like an idiot even when he chose it.  It felt like losing, and he wasn’t sure if he hated himself or Steve more in that moment.
“Yep,” Steve said without an iota of concern.
“Because you’ve met me?” Tony replied with a quirk of his lips.  “The whole time I was there, I kept thinking, it had to be for a reason,” he continued, letting the teasing pretense slip away.  “All of this.  It has to mean something.  I can’t…I can’t have it not mean something.  I have to make it mean something, Steve. I have to.”
The guards held the doors open for them, then silently kept pace behind Steve as he followed Rhodes down the now familiar corridor, down the stairs at the end, and through a wooden door that Steve had noticed, but never seen used.  The door opened into a long, narrow hallway that, as Steve soon discovered, zigged and zagged, and sometimes sprouted stairs, almost at random, it seemed to Steve. Occasionally, long, slim windows appeared to one side, and Steve caught glimpses of the gardens, a bailey at one point, and what appeared to be another courtyard.  Confined, as he had been, to Zola’s compound and Tony’s suite of rooms, Steve hadn’t had a chance to do much more than look out over the castle grounds from his balcony or peer out one of the windows in Tony’s chambers, and he wished he could stop and look longer at what was below.  No one passed them in the corridor, though Steve could hear the bustle of movement coming from nearby as they walked.
The man shook his head and gently wrapped his hands around Anto’s wrists, lowering them from his face.  He cleared his throat and made more sounds. Anto recognized some of the sounds from before, but their meaning escaped him.  Finally, the man stopped and sighed, running a hand through his hair and putting his hands on his hips so his elbows stuck out at odd angles.  It was such a strange pose, Anto skittered away and blinked at him.
“Oh, I see! You think I like you because of the unfair attractiveness.  Well, joke’s on you, soldier.  I happen to like the smart, funny, stupidly-heroic, mini-golf cheat underneath. So there,” Tony said, emphasizing the point by stabbing his fork in the air between them.
“Go on,” Tony urged.  “It’s fine.  I’ll be fine.  Go.  Get tuda choppa!  Sorry, sorry, that was terrible. But, really, when do you get a chance to use that quote?  Like, never.  Unless you’re you.  Or Bonded to you.  Seriously, you shouldn’t let me leave the cabin, you know?”
“I need—“ Tony broke off, sucking in a harsh breath because all the air seemed to have left his lungs.  “I
His mouth twisted up in self-disgust.  He really was terrible at this.  At least Steve got SI in the bargain.  Forgive me, but I come with great financials?  He should put in more of an effort, though. Contribute.  He picked up the pepper shaker, then set it back down and rocked it back and forth along the edge of the table.
So, bed was better.  Bed was great, in fact.  Bed was warm and his and no one was bothering him, which, come to think of it, was a bit odd.  How had he managed to go this long without being reminded of how lazy and slovenly he was?  It was almost as if he didn’t need the constant reminder, and still managed to rise and shine and feel shitty about himself all on his own.  And Howard said he wasn’t self-sufficient.
“You choose,” Steve said.  So that he’ll know I missed him, Steve’s mind echoed.  He gripped the edges of the tub and pushed himself out, sending puddles of water to the floor.
He found himself slowing as he walked up the steps to the fifth floor apartment he was currently sharing with Bucky, his best friend, and Clint, someone Bucky had met at work.  They all worked for one of the local construction companies, working on office buildings downtown. Bucky had gotten him the job shortly after he arrived from New York.  Bucky worked on the welding crew.  Clint did heating and air conditioning work.  It was Clint who had first suggested this particular line of work, saying he’d done it a few times and how it was a great way to make a quick few hundred dollars.  Steve had brushed the idea off at first as ridiculous, but as things came closer and closer to a point with his mom and the situation with his finances got more and more desperate, it had started to sound like a more attractive option. Bucky, on the other hand, was adamantly opposed to the whole idea.  He’d argued strenuously against this.  But, when it came time tonight to get ready, Bucky had helped him do the bowtie, knowing Steve’s fingers would never be able to finesse it.
Steve dropped the tags abruptly and stepped back, turning towards the railing and bracing his palms on top of it.  He dipped his head to his chest, let out a long breath and closed his eyes for a moment before looking back at Tony.
Whatever it was, it had been unexpected, Tony thought, twisting the word around a bit in his head again.  Unexpected.  Such a simple word that held so much.  Unexpected meant unpredictable.  And unpredictable meant Tony couldn’t figure out what he was supposed to do, how he was supposed to act, what he should say or not say, and that, dear friends, usually ended up going very badly for him.
“He was just trying to drive a wedge between us and doing a damn good job of it,” Bucky said.  “I mean, yeah, we got this thing, you and me, and then--and then we got out at the same time, and I know, Steve, I fucking know that I wasn’t in a good place for awhile with the hospitals and the surgeries and all this shit,” he added, curling his arm up into a fist.
“No,” Tony admitted in a flat voice.
“I guess you could say it became something of a mission in life to find you,” Tony said, eyes on Steve. “Then, I did, and, well.”
“I know. I do, you know? I get it,” Bucky acknowledged, holding up his hand in a placating gesture. “Believe me, I do. I think you know that,” Bucky continued, and Steve had to look away at that, because if anyone knew the burning, clawing anger that wound its way inside you until you had to let it out or succumb to it, until you weren’t sure if there was a difference, then it was Bucky. “And I understand why you needed to be the one to do it, too. Same reason I needed to be at Stane’s hanging, watch him dangle and kick while the life was choked out of him. I wanted to see that. I
“It was a hell of a ride,” Tony said, a sad half-smile forming.  He punched the comm signal. Not that anyone could hear him out here, but, well, he performed better with the possibility of an audience.  Habit, he supposed. He cleared his throat and turned back around to face the vast emptiness that spread out in endless night.
I reblog Stony stuff and sometimes post things on tumblr when I can figure out how: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/sabrecmc
“You're going to see I'm right about this when you've had time to think,” Steve answered stubbornly, without looking up from the doorknob. “Look at what you've done with your life, Tony. Look at who you are. You and me, we don't make any sense. We never did. You're gonna see that once you get a chance to really think about it.”
“A welcome distraction,” Stark replied, shrugging a bit and shoving his hands back into his pockets. His voice was a bit softer than when he spoke to Brock, or so it seemed, though Steve supposed that could be the wind.
“I don’t remember any men,” Steve frowned.  “Wait...the Reverend? He was…”
“Do not listen to her.  Old age has made her jealous and bitter,” the girl commented, shooting a narrow-eyed look across the pool at the woman.
“Got any names you want to share? Can’t keep calling her ‘Bump,’” Tony whispered, almost reverently. His cheeks were wet, he noticed, and ran a hand over his face.
thing to do, but, it’d be crazy not to, wouldn’t it?  A million dollars for one night...how can we say no to that?”
“God, Steve,” Tony choked out, eyes roving over the lines of Steve’s body, the way the muscles of his back and flanks moved and bunched, how his powerful thighs trembled with the effort. Steve’s cock was hard enough to press against his stomach, even at that angle, his balls hanging heavy and red, swaying slightly when he shifted on the bed. There was a wet patch on the sheet beneath Steve, Tony saw, and felt his cock jump in response to what his body knew that meant.
In red.
“Steve gave it to me,” Tony continued.  “Basically, it says I’m his Omega, and he says I can do what I want.  Okay, so, technically, there are some fancy words, my picture, a California DMV stamp and Steve’s Alpha ID on there, but same diff. I’m ninety-nine percent certain he just went to SHIELD’s version of Legal Zoom and told them to give him one.  Want to see?”
Steve knew he should probably refuse the ride and just walk to the bus stop, but he couldn’t have given up these last few moments with Tony for anything.  He crawled into the car without looking up and sank back into the seat.  To his surprise, Tony slammed the limo door shut without getting in and walked over to where Hammer was about to get into his own car.  Steve couldn’t see what was going on with the concrete pile-on or hear anything from inside the limo, but that didn’t stop his imagination from running wild with the possibilities.  Probably something along the lines of, “Dodged a bullet with that one, Hammer, too clingy by half,” Steve imagined bitterly.
“He’s doing the face thing again,” Cam offered helpfully.
“I know. Sorry.  That…that came out wrong,” Tony said.  “I didn’t mean—damn, look, I don’t care about the stripping thing.  I’m certainly not going to judge you for it.  I mean, really, me?  Have you Googled me?  Okay, then, see?  Not judging.  You just seemed, I don’t know, bothered up there, I guess.  You can’t let Hammer get to you.  Guy really is a complete prick,” Tony told him.
Feeling brazen, he cupped his balls and hefted them, one in each hand, rolling them around and giving them a squeeze while his cock throbbed painfully, the veins standing out in relief against the delicate, red skin, shining in the firelight. He huffed out a harsh breath and let out a low groan.
Of course.  That made sense.  The rumors and whatever talk it was that had his parents so concerned. Tony may not want Steve, but he probably figured, like his parents had, that this was the best of whatever limited options he had.  Steve wondered what Tony wanted. What he really wanted. He tried to imagine it in his head, but no image would come, just a dark blankness that filled his head. His chest hurt. He sucked in a gulp of cold air. He’d forgotten to breathe again.
“All the more reason not to Bond,” Steve pointed out.  His voice sounded weary to his own ears, and her face visibly softened.  An affectation.  Her heart-rate was up.  Nerves.  She didn’t like arguing with him.  Good.   She would stop soon, and he could leave and go back to his room, where no one asked questions, and he could turn the thermostat up to eighty and no one would care.
“You’re part of a small, but very exclusive club, then.  Congrats. I think there’s a secret handshake and maybe some kind of lapel pin if you keep your membership going at least a year,”  Tony replied. The elevator doors opened, and they walked through the Hotel lobby towards the exit. People watched them, of course.  Steve could feel their interest as they strolled across the marble floors. They took pictures. A low buzz of voices followed them. He wondered if they had seen the videos.  If they were talking about him. Thinking about him and what he had done, thinking about how he had somehow convinced Tony Stark to marry a stripper like the worst kind of cliché.  Someone yelled out something crude, something about understanding why Tony picked him now, and Steve felt his throat tighten, but he kept his eyes glued straight ahead. He clutched at Tony’s arm a little harder, and Tony turned, waved and smiled, even held up the peace sign.  Steve shot him a grateful look, though Tony just shook his head once and went on with it.
“I’m going to be really uncool for about thirty seconds here, and I’d like you to just pretend this never happened,” Tony announced.
“Then take this. Take this from me,” Steve heard himself husk out, a hollow, empty sound in the quite of the room. “Don’t let me go.” Rationally, Steve knew he asked the impossible, unfairly so, even. There was nothing and everything to take, but Tony occupied the space between gods and ordinary men, and if it could be done, Tony would make it so, and that was enough to cling to for now. It was enough that Tony would try, would want to, and not care, or care too much, Steve wasn’t sure which it was, but the line distance between those things didn’t seem to matter now.
“How’d he get the location?” Tony asked.
The words 'Temporary Restraining Order' were emblazoned in bold letters across the top of the page. Tony's eyes scanned down to the bottom of the page where, yep, the same extremely friendly judge who had granted the dissolution and sealed the file had signed the order. Bet he got a nice, cushy job after retirement, Tony thought with a sharp, bitter pang. Bet we are going to be revisiting how much he is enjoying that retirement.
“Tony--” Steve began, a warning in his voice.
“Master Zola said you are to stay here, now, and since I’m to take care of you, I stay here, too,” Cam said with the matter-of-factness of youth.  “I have my own room, just back there,” he added, turning and pointing with a wide grin.  “With a bed and a window and everything.”
Holy shit.  Tony grabbed at his chest, hands splayed wide as he breathed in and out.  Deep, heaving breaths. The kind he hadn’t been able to take since Afghanistan.  He lifted his hands and looked down at the smooth skin of his chest. There wasn’t even a scar.  Nothing. No trace that the reactor had ever been there. Shaking his head with amazement, he stared down at his hands. Turned them over, palms up, then back.
“Steve,” Tony repeated, throaty and thick, his grip on Steve’s hand tightening, fingers digging in.  Tony pulled their hands to his mouth, and pressed his lips there, holding it as he looked up at Steve, then letting their hands fall to his chest.  Steve could feel the slightly puckered skin of the round scar beneath the back of his hand.  This is where his heart is, Steve realized, and it felt like a choice.
“Rogers, Steven Grant,” JARVIS’ voice sounded from the tablet on top of the dresser as Tony adjusted his tie in front of the mirror.  “Born in Brooklyn, New York, 1981.  Currently residing in Las Vegas, Nevada, as you know.  Unmarried.  Father, Joseph Rogers, deceased in 1989.  Mother, Sarah Rogers, deceased in 1999.  Graduated from Fort Hamilton High School and subsequently enlisted in the Army the following August.  During his enlistment, he earned a Bachelor’s Degree in Middle Eastern Studies from American Military University in 2005.  He went on to complete Army Ranger School 2008 and attained the rank of Captain before receiving an honorable discharged just under a year ago.  Employment tax records indicate that, in addition to the employment of which you are already aware,” JARVIS continued primly, while Tony rolled his eyes.  “Mr. Rogers also works for a road construction subcontractor called Comstock Paving.  A search of property records did not reveal any real estate holdings, past or present.  No prior criminal history.  No bankruptcies.  One Visa credit card with a balance of just over $4300.  One application for a loan with Chase Bank and one with the Bank of Nevada, both denied due to insufficient assets.  One Macy’s card account, opened in 1999, now closed and paid off.  No other credit history.  One bank account, with a current balance of $567.58 and a savings account with just over twenty-three thousand dollars.”
“So sensitive.  You should have jewelry for them.  They make chains for them that attach to your collar or your cock, you know?  Beautiful decorations that you wear beneath your robes, that only I would know about.  You would wear them and think of me each time they pull or tug, and they would.  All day.  While you are sitting with your paints or having a repast.  They would make you ache and think of me.  Would you like that, my beautiful one?” Tony asked and wrapped his hand around Steve’s cock, just holding it there, heating Steve’s skin even against the warmth of the water.
“Who said you could put that away?” Tony demanded, then grinned and tugged at Steve’s shoulders until he fell down next to Tony on the bed, making the whole thing bounce underneath them.  Tony sat up, then turned over and twisted himself until he had one leg thrown over Steve’s lap.  Steve sat up and gripped Tony’s thighs where the gown bunched up between them.  One of the shoulders had fallen down, and Tony saw Steve’s eyes dart to the curve of his neck, unblemished, unlike the other side.  Tony reached out and cupped Steve’s jaw in his hands, titling Steve’s head until his Alpha was looking up at him.  “I missed you, too, you know. I hate it when you’re gone.”
“Looks like I win the prize.  What do I get?  Isn’t a soon-to-be-dead goldfish the usual?” Tony asked, seemingly to himself.
“That’s placating. You’re placating me,” Tony grumbled, mouth twisting into a grimace as he walked over to the circular platform he’d built for the armor where it could be stored and cleaned. “So--aside from your Evel Knievel impersonation--overall, I’d call that one a success. I mean, helping overthrow Kree enslavement one backwater outpost at a time wasn’t on my to-do list, but I can’t say I’m against it.”
“Rhodey’s at my place,” Tony said to Steve.  “He’s assessing my upgrades.”
Not that Steve could really judge Brock’s plans.  Brock and Rollins had the business background, not Steve, who hadn’t even managed to finish college yet.  He would, though.  He could now, thanks to Tony.  He thought it might make Tony happy for him to do that, even if Tony would never know.  Maybe when he graduated from art school, he’d send Tony an announcement.  Just to let him know.
Another. He stopped counting.  Floated. A memory of his mother playing the piano came to mind.  His favorite song. He could listen to her for hours, just playing that same song.  Howard said it was the only time he could be still. He was still now, though. Still and held.  Complete. Happy, looking at Pepper, as he took her hand to help her out of the car. An alien face he didn’t recognize, but trusted and loved and missed,
Tony sighed, shifted his hips back a little, felt an answering flare deep within him where they were tethered.  Mine, he thought, digging his fingers into Steve’s skin.  He turned his neck, craning around to find Steve’s mouth. The kiss was sweet, almost chaste, just the two of them, connected.  Together.  A part of each other.  They stayed like that, twisted around one another, foreheads touching, lips barely parted enough for air until Tony felt the knot slowly dissipate.  He blew a puff of air out over his lips as Steve slipped out of him.  He felt empty.  Not bad-empty, exactly.  Loose, open.  Laid bare.  Separate, his mind supplied, and he scrubbed a hand vigorously over his face.
Steve took in a quick breath when he could and tried to relax his throat even more as he pushed his face flush with Tony’s abdomen as Tony’s cock slid fully into his throat, cutting off his air. He swallowed around it a few times, letting his throat muscles work to massage around Tony’s shaft. Tony’s hand was wrapped in his hair, holding him in place, and suddenly, Steve felt Tony’s whole body stiffen.  He could feel the warm, thick fluid leaking from his hole, running over where his balls hung, heavy and tight, and puddling on the bed beneath him.  His own cock was painfully hard, pushing insistently against his stomach, already leaking a steady stream, but he wouldn't touch himself.  This was about Tony, and he would come from taking care of his Alpha or not at all.
“You don’t have to do that.  You must be tired,” Steve pointed out.   “You should get some shut eye.”
“Ah, so...remember what I said about my pacemaker?” Tony asked.  “Well, it’s—thing is, it’s—it’s a little big. And there’s scarring from the shrapnel.  It isn’t pretty.”
“I’m not.  I’m not sure about anything,” Steve replied, mouth flattening into a thin line.
Two slaves pumped the air through the bellows.  Steve didn’t know their names, he realized.  He righted himself in the water and let his gaze flicker over to them then away, letting them fade into the background.  He thought one was called Ott, though he wasn’t sure.  They wore simple loincloths in the heat and sweated as they went about their work, though both appeared well fed and in good health.  Steve wondered when that had started to be a testament to anything.  There was a creeping blindness that came with waiting for Tony to change.  Bright, round circles that blotted his vision where clarity used to be.
Still, he needed to try. Try something, anyway.  For Tony’s sake.
“He’s a good lad.  Clever,” Tony remarked, shrugging his robe over his shoulders and tying the belt.  “You could have proper attendants, though, you know.  I’m not suggesting putting the boy from you,” Tony added quickly, holding up a placating hand.  “You are worse than one of those hens with a chick under her wing about him,” he grumbled, then ruined the effect by laughing lightly.  “I was merely pointing out that it is customary for one such as you to have something of a retinue to see to your needs.  I’m told.  By Pepper. Who is always right, of course.”
“He’s been defending Jerry Lewis’ honor and eating brie or something,” Tony added with a shrug.
“It is his duty to see you safe,” Steve reminded him.
“You know that I’m probably the last person to talk about this stuff with, right? I mean, me and Betty…we’re not exactly the model of a successful relationship,” Bruce admitted, his voice going careful and heavy for a moment. Bruce didn’t talk about Betty very often, Tony knew. He’d never asked if they were soulmates. Whatever they were, Bruce loved her enough to walk away, and it didn’t take a lot of digging to see where the anger he was able to sustain came from, not now, anyway, when Tony had spent the past few months nursing his own hatred for a world that would try to tear this from him.
“You don’t think so? One night is hardly a barometer to judge,” Tony pointed out.
Steve lifted his champagne flute and held it out between them.  “To being easy.”
“I don’t know,” Steve answered finally. That might have been the only truly honest thing he’d told the boy all morning, he thought grimly.  I carried it, because no one would take it from me, except at the end, when everything was gone and it was done.  Maybe this was the price for winning, a balance that had to be struck.  Maybe they knew that, he thought with a dull sort of horror.
“I wouldn’t…Wait, who?…No.  No, Steve.  No.  Nothing like that, no,” Tony was shaking his head, and Steve couldn’t quite make out the expression on his face in the darkness, but he could have sworn Tony looked like he was in pain. He heard Tony take a deep breath, “Just…do you have a preference?  I’m fine either way, but I generally prefer to top, at least at first.”
It was a long time before Steve fell asleep. He didn’t remember them, but his dreams were troubled, and he woke restless and tired. And alone.
One of Tony’s hands found the center of Steve’s chest and splayed wide.  Steve could almost smell the lily’s scent while his mind said star, and the strange thought that it could be both filled his head, powerful and insistent.  He kissed a line up Tony’s jaw until he felt the scratch of beard, then found his mouth and teased at the lower lip, until Tony grew impatient, reached up and grabbed the sides of Steve’s head, tongue thrusting deep and warring with Steve’s own.
“I don’t know, Buck. Just quit—what if—how does that even--“ Steve started.
“That is…not quite how I recall the situation,” Howard protested with an exaggerated look of confusion, while Peggy rolled her eyes and Jarvis made a harrumphing sound in the back of his throat.  “Neat bit of tech, though. Simple, really,” Howard said.  “Could probably whip one up in the garage in no time.”
He felt Tony’s other hand on his back, warm and solid, pressing against his spine, holding him in place, pressing hard, like he could push out whatever was in Steve’s head. Maybe he could.  Steve wanted that to be so with a need that bordered on desperation.
And Tony knew it. Tony
“Steve. Tony.  How, ah…how’d class go?” Rhodey asked hesitantly.
“He will avoid them like they carry a plague now,” Steve guessed, walking over to the bed where Tony reclined and stared up at the ceiling. He doused the few lamps that still burned and climbed onto the surprisingly soft mattress next to Tony.
Thank you so much for reading, commenting and kudo-ing. Makes my little stony heart so happy!  Next chapter is half written.  It is mostly porn, lol.  Enjoy!
Even the wrong kind of attention was still a recognition that he was there, that he existed, that he mattered, which, he realized was fucked up.  Didn’t make him stop, but at least he was self-aware.  He snorted out a caustic laugh and scrubbed his hands over his face.
So, no pressure.
By the time they arrived, Steve was starving, which he imagined Tony knew he would be.  The two guards took up their post outside the door and gave Steve a deferential nod as he ducked inside. The chambers he shared with Tony at Greenbriar sat atop a turret, lushly appointed in lush fabrics of greens, blues and golds. A large harvest tapestry stitched with fruit, barley, cloves, and all manner of bounty hung above a huge stone fireplace opposite a thick-postered bed carved with stalks of wheat, acorns, berries and leaves, leaving no doubt where Greenbriar’s riches lay.
“Yeah, well, I’ll just explain to the citizens of Gulmira that I was too busy getting handed some useless award to pay attention to where my weapons went.  I’m sure they would understand. Except, you know, for being dead,” Tony spat out.  “Kind of puts a bit of a damper on the understanding part.”
Long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs has nothing on me, Tony thought grimly, but none of the Alphas so much as looked at him.  He had his Steve-shaped invisibility cloak, he supposed.   The absence of scrutiny still took some getting used to, but, dear God, it was nice to not have to plaster on a second skin, to not have to worry, even just for these few moments.  He hadn’t realized how much energy it took to be constantly aware of himself and his surroundings until he didn’t have to be.
So, dinner it was.
“Who is he?” Tony asked, still looking at his watch.
“I’d chew through an actual cow first,” Rhodey agreed.
“Jane is one of the foremost authorities on the subject.  She leaves me for Berm tomorrow to speak at one of her science conferences.  She will be the notekey speaker!” Thor announced with clear pride, one arm sweeping around Jane’s shoulders and shaking her in what was probably meant to be a light, fortifying gesture that probably rattled her teeth.
“Yes. Yes, thank you.  That’s good. I’m good. Are you good?” Tony questioned, looking Steve up and down.
He’d been in their apartment, surrounded by all the brand new things Steve had gone binge-shopping to buy with his father’s money, wanting so very desperately for Steve to deny it, but, of course, Steve had owned up to it.  He’d give him credit for that, at least, though all the proof had been right there in front of him.   He remembered what Steve said to him though.  Take care of yourself, Tony.  How fucking flippant.  Take care of yourself?  How, he’d wanted to shout.  How was he supposed to do that, when everything was falling apart around him?  But that was then, and this was a very different kind of now.
Steve stopped abruptly and turned to face Tony, balancing a foot on the step above him.  “They didn’t have anything on you—you admitted it was you because I told them I was the one downloading the music, didn’t you?”  Steve asked in a rough, thick tone.
“Seems unlikely,” Rhodey acknowledged as he fell into step by Tony.  “So, going off-campus, huh?  You know, I think a small, robotics start-up is like the twelfth anniversary gift, just saying.”
“I think the first time I really saw you was in that diner, explaining to me in an admittedly somewhat concerning level of detail exactly where Doofenschmirtz was going wrong. And that’s the person I’d like to see again,” Steve replied, turning around to look at Tony.
“Good, you’re here,” Tony called out, the words coming out garbled around the pin.  “I was just thin—”
Thank you to everyone who took the time to read this.  I really appreciate it.  If you liked it, I live for comments and kudots!  It's the only way I know you enjoyed it.
The door to their room was open and light spilled in through the window.  Someone had dusted recently.  It smelled like polish.  Tony dropped his bag on the bed, then walked over to the window and stuck a finger between the blinds to pull them apart.  The caretaker had put his telescope on the deck, though a dark cover shrouded it for the moment.  State of the art, with a few of his own modifications, though the original telescope still sat in a corner of the garage.   He would ask Steve to get it out, he thought.  He wanted to see the stars through that lens again, though he couldn’t quite capture why.
With that, Cam tossed the towel he had been holding in his lap down next to the bath and stalked off to fall dramatically onto the bed, arms thrown akimbo, still muttering.  No doubt about Steve’s stupidity, Steve admitted to himself with a small amount of fond exasperation.  He pushed himself out of the bath, stood there dripping for a moment, then stepped out and reached for the towel, drying off as best he could.  Wrapping a robe around himself, he walked towards the bed, where Cam flipped on his stomach, fisted his hands under his chin and peered out across the balcony.  A few, hopeful birds gathered on the edge of the balcony wall waiting for one of Cam’s handouts to appear.  Across the sea, the sun was a bright pink fireball slipping into the dark depths below.
“Feel better?” Tony rasped out.  Next to his head, he heard the rush of water being poured from the plastic pitcher, and a moment later, the cool rim of the cup and blessed water reached his lips.  An arm slipped behind his back, lifting him up to a recline so he could drink.
“Sorry!” Steve said quickly, dropping his hands and stepping back so fast, it left Tony reeling forward into Steve’s chest.  No, wait.  That wasn’t why.  He was slipping forward because his legs were suddenly the consistency of Jello.   “Are you okay?”
If you did enjoy it, the only way I know is if you click the kudos and/or leave a comment. I really, really appreciate that effort.  It lets me know that this is something worth doing and people are enjoying it.
“Sorry,” Steve acknowledged, with a slight nod to Rhodes, who was watching him with an entirely too knowing expression. Steve risked a quick glance to Tony, who was swaying lightly in his saddle, a softly pleased expression fleeting across his face before he shuttered it.
Steve smiled ruefully from behind his veil and felt his face flush with heat.  He was thankful no one else could see it, though he had no doubt Tony knew the effect his words had on Steve.  Steve bowed his head to Tony, then to the Lords Rand.
Steve looked up at him, then set the sword to his side and pushed himself to his feet, crossing the room to where Tony lay on the bed with a few, quick strides.  Tony sat up in surprise, then found himself pushed back against the bed cushions as Steve climbed on the bed, knees straddling Tony.
There were other things in the huge room, though Steve could barely light on one for more than a moment before he moved on to the next incredible thing.  A tall cabinet painted in flowers.  A chandelier that dripped strings of carved glass.  A shelf of leather-bound books.  To his left, he could see other rooms, and to his right, the thing that his mind finally caught on and clung to, a large balcony with vines of the same flowers he had seen in the courtyard stretching up the sides.  A divan was spread out under a large fabric canopy, and a small table laden with food and drink waited.
“I do,” Steve said, flashing him a quick, reassuring smile.  “I’m just…worried, is all.”
“Always,” Steve said softly, walking over to stand in front of Tony.  Tony slid his arms around Steve’s waist and pressed the side of his head into Steve’s shoulder.  “Always, Tony.  I promise.  You were really going to give up your dream project because you thought I might get hurt?”
Tony had not so much as stirred, Steve noted, still flopped on his stomach on the bed, one arm dangling towards the floor. Steve walked over to the bed and sat the breakfast tray down on the bedside table, then picked up a pillow that had fallen on the floor at some point last night. He grinned a bit as he put it on the ground and dropped to his knees on top of it. It shouldn’t matter so much, he supposed. It was a small thing compared to everything Tony did for him, but the desire to have Steve be comfortable had been one of the first things Tony had done after they Bonded. The pillows were one of the many ways Tony made Steve’s happiness his priority, and Steve couldn’t help but find it all rather endearing.
Tony wandered over to the wall of neatly folded jeans and pulled a couple of pairs in his size out of one of the bins.  Even though he didn’t need anything, picking out his own clothes was a bit of a novel experience.  A dark blue long-sleeved shirt almost made the cut, but then he remembered his mom’s admonition about blue, and put it back on the rack, pulling out a black Pink Floyd t-shirt off the bottom of a stack instead.
“Don’t!” Tony shouted, banging a fist against the metal table so hard the instruments on the nearby tray clattered and clanked.  “Don’t start rationalizing this.”
“You, too, Happy,” Tony replied.  Steve climbed in next to him, and gave Tony a quick, searching look before buckling up.
“He’s…unique,” Natasha said, and smiled into her martini.
They met the rest of the group in the great hall, which gave Steve his first glimpse of the now barren feasting tables and banners that hung above them bearing the King’s standard just above the Lord of the Ridge’s sigil, a bright, golden fist.  The ride down from the Highcastle was uneventful enough, though Cam steadfastly refused to open his eyes. Lord Rand’s sturdier carriages, pulled by mountain-bred ponies who were used to the rocky, uneven terrain, waited for them at the bottom. Once they were in their carriage, Cam chattered in an endless combination of nerves and excitement.
Steve could only stare at Tony as a slowly dawning understanding settled into him.  A stranger appearing at night in the middle of a terrible storm, in need of help.  An entreaty for entry into the safety of a home.  The Shadowman will get you, if you don’t watch out, Steve sing-songed in his mind, the way Lizzie and Ian used to do, but not William, who didn’t want to believe in such nonsense.  The Man of the Mountain, his mother called him, who came to ferry the worthy through the shadow realm.  He could feel, in that moment, all the failings of his body in a way that the gradual years rarely allowed.  He could smell the sickly sweet stink of decay on himself.  He could see the blood slow as it pumped its way through veins that stood out in heavy relief against flesh that sagged and stretched.
“Come on,” Tony urged, pulling Steve by the arm towards the shower.  The glass door was grayed out with steam, and clicked as Tony pulled it open, letting a rush of warm air, heavy with condensation, billow into the room.
, Steve responded.
“How’d someone like you end up in a place like that?” Steve countered as their first course arrived.  Cannelloni and avocado with Scottish salmon in some kind of cream sauce, according to the waiter.  Steve glanced over at Tony and raised an eyebrow.  “Scottish salmon?  Tell me you’re not imagining them in little kilts.”
“You’ll always come and get me,” Tony reminded him gruffly.  Steve choked out a low, wet laugh and pulled Tony up against him, nearly lifting Tony off the floor.  Which he could do. Because he was Actual Fucking Captain America.  Tony let out an involuntary giggle.
“Glad you asked,” Tony replied after a moment.  He gave Steve a somewhat grateful smile, then launched into an explanation of what Steve knew that he could so clearly see in his mind.  By the time they reached the Highcastle, Steve could almost picture what Tony was talking about as they walked past the wheel towards the platform. He stood at the bottom, looked up the huge pillar of rock to where the castle loomed, then over at the men waiting at the wheel’s spokes and wondered if they knew how much their lives had changed.
. Everywhere he looked, he could see them, together. How it could be. Maybe how it should be.
“They’re his benefits,” Steve insisted, then frowned down at Barnes.  “They’re your benefits.  You served honorably.  You got hurt in the line.  You earned them.  It’s only fair.”
Tony stared at him, mouth wagging open and closed, then pushed himself to a stand.  He staggered over to where a bottle of wine sat on the workroom table, his gait so ungainly, his hip banged against the table’s edge, sending two of his map table figures lurching forward onto their carved faces.  He grasped the bottle, but did not drink, just held the neck wrapped in his fingers.  The next thing Steve knew, the bottle exploded against the far wall, flung with such force the glass shattered into pieces no bigger than Steve’s palm.
Tony’s head rang, a loud, low whine that seemed strangely elongated.  Stabs of pain jarred his nerves. He blinked, slowly, but it was something.  His fingers seized, grasping at the air as spikes of feeling started to return.  He sucked in a breath, just a thin wisp of air, but it burned like fire down his throat and bloomed icy-hot in his chest.  His head lolled to the side. His phone. His phone was there, where he had tossed it earlier. He could call Rhodey. Rhodey could help Steve, Tony thought desperately.  Save Steve. That was all that mattered.
Tony looked up in shock.  Steve. Steve had come back, Tony thought with a surge of panicked relief.  Steve had come back, and they would talk or—or something. Tony could explain better.  There were so many things he wanted to say, and not that he had been
“It does.”
“Well, we are just glad you are both here now.  Aren’t we, Howard?” Maria asked a little too airily.
“That’s…wow. Thank you,” Steve said, looking over at Tony.  “That’s pretty impressive.”
Steve straightened, panting, and swiped the back of his hand against his cheek again.  “Stay down,” he warned when Brock started to turn.  “I mean it, Brock.  Are we done here?”
Which, as it turned out, was hole fifteen, when one of the bachelorette party members in the group behind them hit a stray ball and knocked Steve’s ball out of the area of play and towards a row of claw machines promising a winner every time.  They’d run through Tony’s favorite movie—Raiders of the Lost Ark--favorite kind of food—New York pizza--his best childhood memory, an afternoon of building a pinewood derby car with his butler, which had taken far longer to answer than Steve would have anticipated,  and ended on his favorite way to spend his downtime on hole fourteen, when Steve figured Tony was one hole away from stomping his feet in annoyance, but he’d started the whole challenge thing, so Steve wasn’t going to feel guilty about using it to his advantage.
“Let’s just say, it’s classified,” Fury said, giving Steve a long look that was definitely a yes.
close.  It’s going to work,” Tony told him.  “We got the Army Corps onboard.  They’re looking for different renewable sources—solar, geo, wind, whatever, but this…this could replace all those at a fraction of the cost.  Pepper’s got all the financial data.  I’ve talked to R&D, manufacturing, marketing, legal…we’re there.  We can do this.  I know, it’s a risk.  We’ve been a weapons manufacturer since Dad hung out his shingle.  But, I think it’s one we have to take.  We’re…supplying an industry where the market has become something I barely recognize.   It’s not like when you and Dad started. There’s no Big Bad to fight, not anymore.  We stopped fighting to protect freedom.  Now, we just…fight what we tell the people to fear, and call that security.”
Tony jumped back, the berries spilling out of the makeshift pouch he had made of his tunic.
“No.  You don’t,” Tony said dully.
“It…writes.  On its own.  What the Professor is saying.  Just…writes it.  Tony made it,” Steve said, which wasn’t quite true, though Tony didn’t correct him, because Steve had said it like it was the most wonderful, amazing thing, and it was so familiar, that tone, the warm burst of pleasure deep in his chest when he heard it, the way his stomach turned somersaults, and his mind let him believe it.
“Well, that’s just ridiculous,” Clint said, sliding Steve his plate full of pancakes before looking down at his empty place and blinking in confusion.  “Anyway, putting aside conjugal food groups, Cap, much as it pains me to agree with Stark, you might want to rethink this whole commercial flight business,” Clint argued.  “I mean, think about it.  Someone doesn’t share the armrest, and you’ve got Tony going ballistic at thirty thousand feet.  Not to mention, what if some pimple-faced TSA agent decides to prove they aren’t profiling by patting down Captain America? All of a sudden, the terror alert is lighting up like a nightclub disco ball because Iron Man has declared war on the TSA.  ‘Course, I’m not totally opposed to that, come to think.”
“That’s not funny,” Tony complained, giving him the best annoyed look he could muster when Steve was so wonderful and perfect, even when he wasn’t being reasonable about this.
“I—yeah.  Yeah, it makes sense, Steve,” Tony said softly.
The gift is life, Tony thought, and looked up at the alien hovering above him, still stroking his forehead, and came with a surprised cry, spilling himself into the cylinder.  He stared, blinking, as the cord siphoned off the spend into regions unknown, licked his lips, then looked up at the alien again. His expression, Tony saw, was soft, and Tony had the strange thought that it was...apologetic?  Maybe. Almost. But, not unhappy, he didn’t think. No, definitely not unhappy. Maybe just worried, Tony wondered, and had a nearly overwhelming desire to brush that worry away. Almost as quickly as he thought it, the alien’s face went slack, he blinked, then smiled softly down at Tony again.  The alien stroked his hand over Tony’s forehead again, and Tony felt such a sense of deep, aching tenderness flood into him that he thought for a moment that he might actually cry, but then it diffused, settling into a warm sense of languid peace.
The topic switch caught Steve off-guard, but he was starting to adjust to Tony’s rapid-fire conversation changes.  “My friend brought some over,” Steve reminded him.  “Last night.”
“Well, I’d say it’s been good seeing you, but I hate lying, so,” Tony said with a shrug of his shoulders.
, but he did have a visceral reaction to it every time he looked at it.  It made him feel… emptier, somehow.  Which didn’t make sense, but he couldn’t shake the feeling every time he looked at all those zeroes.  He’d feel better when it was gone and all this was over and done with.  Then they could start… living their dreams, Steve thought, a frown pulling his face down.  Everything would be great.
Steve was so intent on his drawing, he didn’t hear Tony return until the door closed behind him.  He looked up in surprise, then realized that the light in the room had grown dim and the fire needed stoking.
“I would not have come on this mission if I didn’t want to,” Steve said, somewhat surprised to hear the truth in his own words. “Bucky—he can handle himself, and he would return in his own time.  He wouldn’t miss the wedding.  But, I—I need to go back.  I know that.  I would not want to do so without you, though.  I don’t even know if I could.”
“Oh. Well.  I’ll just—“ Tony started.
Didn’t he?
“I still can’t believe that happened,” Tony said around a bite of donut.
Steve nodded, and Stark poured two glasses of warm, brown liquid and dropped a single cube in each one.  “Didn’t you win some award?” Steve asked as he took the proffered glass.
Tony recalled spending most of those first few days after The Event huddled in his garage over reams of detection data that Professor Thorne provided, courtesy of LIGO.  He had stuck his head out just long enough to grab whatever food it was that Steve left in the oven or in plastic containers stacked in the refrigerator.  Steve went to SHIELD and played very intense games of beer pong or whatever it was Steve did there.  Yes, Tony had been hiding.  He wasn’t proud of it, but it had been unlocking the mysteries of the universe or putting a bag over his head and shame-walking around the cabin like he was Cersei Lannister.
He bid them goodnight once they delivered him to his rooms, opened the door and stepped inside.  He half expected Cam to try to tackle him or have some sort of celebration set up, such was the boy’s usual enthusiasm.
was ridiculous.  This whole thing was crazy.  No wonder Steve didn’t want him.  Steve was…fuck.  God, just say it. Steve was Captain America.
Steve's gaze was dancing all over Tony's face, like it couldn't quite decide where to land, but kept darting down to Tony's mouth, and Tony was far from stupid. He slipped his tongue out to wet his lips, and watched in fascination as Steve's eyes followed its path, and yeah, okay, he hadn't really intended quite this, but mouths and gift horses, and something he couldn't think of because Steve was right there, mouth slightly parted, eyes darkening to the deep blue of the sky just before a storm.
When he turned around, Steve was standing statue still, a shadow of something that looked like sadness passing over his face, making it tighten for a moment before it disappeared, to be replaced by a soft smile as the music drifted between them.
, Tony,” Steve repeated. “It was good. Last night.” He could feel the heat rise in his face, despite the coolness of the water.
“That worked.  It worked, until you made me take it apart, but it worked,” Tony cut in, almost out of air, his throat was so tight, but it had
“What are you hiding, Stark? Is it this new technology everyone keeps talking about?  Something so revolutionary you won’t share it, but you built in in a cave with a bunch of terrorists looking over your shoulder, that’s the story we’re supposed to believe, right?” another voice called out.  “Come on, anyone really buying that line? What’s really going on here?”
“Back in Brooklyn, you mean?” Tony asked.  Steve’s New York accent was showing, something it rarely did.  Usually only popped up when they were talking about something to do with Steve’s childhood.  Ward bosses. Huh.  He hadn’t heard that term before, but California was its own political beast and probably didn’t share a lot in common with the East Coast.
“Kings do not get to cling to ignorance to absolve them of wrongs done in their name.  Besides, you tried to tell me,” Tony shot back, grimacing.  “You tried to tell me what Zola was, and I—well.  I did not care to believe it.  I did not know,” Tony said again. “I did not know.  I would never—“ he sucked in a breath, wet and garbled, and drew his hand to his mouth.  “I would never allow—you must believe me, I would not—you are—” he broke off, clenching his eyes together and holding his fist to his mouth.
, whatever way he could get that.  “Can I...can I touch you?  Is that okay?” he asked.
Tony cared.  He’d actually listened to Steve’s thoughts and experiences and then
“I love you, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I love you,” Steve babbled into the soft wool of Tony’s tunic. It smelled of oil and soot and metal and Tony. Home, Steve thought.   He couldn’t say when these things had replaced salt sea air and river brine, cool grass and wet earth, but this was home now. “I don’t know how to do this,” Steve admitted hoarsely, one hand still fisted in the edge of Tony’s tunic, the other finding its way to the center of Tony’s chest, feeling the hard metal disc there, seeking an anchor and offering a prayer for penitence at the same time. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I don’t want to lose you, but I can’t seem to stop walking away and I don’t know how—I don’t know how to do this, Tony, please. Please, I’m sorry, please.”
“What do you want?” Steve asked.
This is what they did to each other. The rest was some fantasy Tony had clearly created in his mind.
“I meant your chest,” Tony said after a moment, giving it another quick pat.
the wall.  Behind it.  In a box, and he couldn’t get out, he was trapped there, forever.  This is what I dream about, he thought.  What disturbs Tony at night.  Steve felt his teeth gnash together, and he tasted bile in the back of his throat, the remnant of this morning’s  food trying to work its way out.
Steve stared at the now cold pizza.  Tony had not returned from his meeting with Marketing, which was apparently taking a lot longer than Tony had anticipated.  Eating alone was one of his least favorite things, particularly when the meal was intended to be shared.  Giving up, he tilted his head slightly to the ceiling, though he knew, rationally, that JARVIS was no more in the ceiling than he was in the doorknob.  It just felt more natural for some reason.
sorry, Tony.”
“Yeah, that,” Steve agreed with a rough, brittle kind of laugh. “Buck give you a hard time?”
“Can I, ah, can I get a picture of the two of you? If it’s not too much trouble?” the man asked.  “It’s for the Vegas Sun.”
Or they did, but it was different now, wasn’t it, he realized grimly.  He wasn’t Tony Stark, Omega son and heir of Howard Stark, scion of the weapons and technology industries, a curiosity, if nothing else.  Not anymore.  He was some stranger’s Omega. Someone else was going to tell him where to live and what he could do, how to dress and what to read, but it wasn’t any of these someones, these men who had come to drink and smoke cigars and take away what little control he’d been clinging to, even as he’d known it for the illusion it was.  He was someone else’s property now, and we really must keep up social mores, mustn’t we, Tony thought sarcastically as the men walked past.  Wouldn’t want to do something improper while we’re handing someone off to play whore to some Alpha.  Good Lord, no.  Hide the good silver, Jarvis, Tony thought, feeling hysteria bubble up in his chest.
“As I said, I have many names,” Tony replied.  “Vetala. Draugur. Alukah. Moroi. Dhampir.”
I’m trying, Tony thought to himself with a rush of desperate longing.  I’m trying.
Anto had never mentioned the counting sticks again, though he sometimes thought about them in his head as he gathered the grasses, plants and bark that he needed to keep his medicine bag supplied.  Anto hadn’t told anyone about his cave, either, not until he had to. For the Stranger. Anto had known what would happen if Tyber ever found out that Anto had kept his cave a secret, but he had kept it to himself anyway, at least until now.  It almost felt like he had completed some task without ever realizing he had been in the middle of doing so until he was done.
. Blearily, Tony buried his forehead into the pillow, inhaling deeply.  The scent of sex hit him, all musky and sweaty with a sharp sort of tang on it when he breathed it in, and damn, he could admit that was nice after all this time.  The way the air smelled. The way his skin felt the slightest bit damp and dirty. The deep, pleasant soreness that echoed through his body. It was good. Familiar, sure, but…different. Better.
Tony padded back across the room and sat down on the edge of the bed, picking at the coverlet where it rested over Steve’s hips.  He let one hand rest on the curve of Steve’s thigh, then tugged slightly, urging Steve over onto his stomach. Tony picked up the edge of the coverlet and pulled it down, baring Steve’s bottom to the chill of the morning air.  Steve felt the rough scrape of Tony’s hand glide across his flesh and shivered with the feel of it, warm and possessive as he lightly cupped and kneaded the skin. Steve kept his eyes on Tony, watching Tony’s expression darken with pleasure even as a slight frown creased his brow.
“Oh, hey, you that lawyer guy?” a voice called out from across the hall. Tony turned and realized that Steve’s neighbor was standing in his doorway, holding a Big Gulp cup that appeared to contain something a little more than just slurpee by the way the guy's words came out slurry and thick-tongued.
“I can’t wait,” Stark replied, his eyes going slightly sharper.
“I’m gonna hit the shower,” Steve said with a nod.  “Leave me any hot water?”
“Didn’t you do this when you were a kid?  Parents take you to the beach and all that?  Or, I don’t know, your own island or something?” Steve asked teasingly.
“That’s a…” Steve began, staring at the approaching dot. He twisted around to look at Stark. “We’re taking a helicopter?”
“I’m sorry, too,” Steve replied.
“I’m what?” Tony asked, mouth suddenly dry.
“Obie?” Steve asked.
“Yes,” Steve gasped, his breath ragged around the word.  “Please.”
Tony looked down, and noticed there was a dark spot forming on the front of the gown where his cockhead pressed against the silk.  His hips jerked, just a bit, canting forward against the gown, and Tony couldn’t help but pull it tight, letting the head of his cock graze across the soft material.  It wasn’t enough.  It wasn’t nearly enough friction, but as much as he wanted to touch himself, he
He opened his eyes to brightness.  No. Not brightness. Light.  Fluorescent light, to be exact, flicking a little over the hospital bed.  Next to him, a monitor beeped a steady thread of noise and another machine hissed lightly. His head felt like it weighed a ton and was stuffed with cotton, but at least everything here was familiar.
“Barnes and Natasha are coming over to Steve’s with dinner and judgment,” Rhodey replied.
Steve shifted and turned towards Tony in the back of the car, then leaned forward and reached out both hands to Tony’s neck.  Deft fingers undid the tie, then pulled the length of it through Tony’s collar, slow and smooth, warming the skin and making the chain of Steve’s dog tags press into the fold of his neck, until one end of the tie hung in Tony’s lap.  Cross, fold, over, through.  Tony’s throat clicked at the motions, but there was nothing in it to swallow, just air he wasn’t breathing.  Steve’s fingers brushed lightly against Tony’s shirt with each movement, until he finished, tightening the knot and smoothing the fabric down over the front of Tony’s chest with a quick stroke before drawing back his hand.
“Don’t be mean,” Steve objected. “He’s just trying to help.” Tony rolled his eyes.
Steve cupped his hands under the water and carefully sprinkled it over Tony’s hair, just enough to wet it, studiously avoiding getting it anywhere near Tony’s face, and yeah, okay, so Steve was probably familiar enough with waterboarding to know what was in Tony’s head. There was something terrifyingly freeing about that, Steve knowing and them just…moving through it.  Working around it, whatever, like it wasn’t something weird and strange, like he wasn’t messed up and broken, it was just a thing they dealt with without it stopping them. His body felt loose and shaky, his limbs sort of dangling, like they were almost detached, his mind hazy with the relief of a burden he hadn’t realized he had been carrying. It wasn’t gone, not really, it just wasn’t going to be A Thing, and he hadn’t known how much he needed it to be normal for them until it just…was.
“Shut up,” Rhodes said, shaking his head and smiling.  “You shut up, too,” he added, pointing a finger at Tony, who was watching them with a deep intensity that made Steve’s stomach twist.  I am a soldier, he wanted to shout, though he didn’t, just clamped his jaw together and returned Tony’s gaze.  “Are all the soldiers in the Free States like you?” Rhodes asked as he got shakily to his feet.
“We are both of us broken things, Steve. Both of us.  You said I take what would make me weak and turn it into a strength.  I do that by looking to you.  You are my rudder.  I would be that for you, if you would allow it,” Tony offered, almost hesitantly.  “Poor one though I may be.  But you must choose to turn to me instead of trying to find your way on your own.  This thing that you carry with you?  I would help you bear it.  You don’t have to do this by yourself, Steve.  I would follow you on this path, same as any other, but you must choose to let me.  I cannot make you,” Tony finished, lifting a hand to cradle the curve of Steve’s jaw.  “But I will not let you go.  No matter what.  Even if you need to turn away from me.  I will be here when you do not.”
“I told you.  All Pepper’s doing. Something to keep you busy during the day so you don’t talk to people and make her blood pressure spike and her face get all splotchy.  She hates that.  I’ll tell her you liked them,” Tony demurred.  Pepper shot him a severe frown, then just huffed out an annoyed sound.  He’d actually forgotten about the anything-he-can-do-I-can-do-better-paints, but it was nice to hear the thread of excitement in Steve’s voice.
“That’s why you missed the painting class,” Kirk said, finally breaking the silence.  “Your mom.”
“You,” the King huffed, then grinned and rolled back over, slinging an arm across Steve’s shoulders and leaning down to place a nipping kiss on the jut of bone there, before flopping back next to Steve and lifting his gaze, all levity draining away from his face.  “You,” the King said again, voice soft and husky and filled with something that sounded a bit like surprise.
“I was thinking,” Steve began, his words halting Tony in his tracks, like he had known they would.  He should let Tony go. To bed.  Let Tony go to bed. It was late.  I can’t let him go.  I should let him go.  “Nevermind. It’s late. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“I need you to stay,” Tony said, reaching out for the front of Steve’s shirt.  “I need you to stay with me, even if I push you away again.  Even if I’m horrible.  Because I can be, you know that.  I’m probably going to get really pissed about all of this when I can think straight again. Just…stay, okay?”
“We’ll walk the rest of the way in,” Tony said. “Give us some time, then follow.  Rhodey, have the men camp here.  Here, and no further, until you have my leave,” Tony ordered.
“The wheel’s too thin,” Steve said.
“Right, because it makes you feel weird to get awards, even if you deserved them, which you did, I’m betting, but you don’t like to think about what all that means, so you just don’t think about it at all,” Tony said, making Steve’s mouth drop open to apparently wait for a protest that wasn’t going to come. “This is a military convention. They gave me the award because they want to try to place nice, so I’ll keep building them better bombs instead of trying to interest them in things like an AI that can analyze huge amounts of information and predict where peacekeeping efforts would be most effective or when a mass migration is likely to occur. The award’s to make me feel good about what I’ve done up until now.  Make them feel good about it, too, because who doesn’t like an award? Awards mean you did something good.  Something right. But, I don’t want to validate any of that, so they can ship it to my office, and I’ll use it for a doorstop or something.”
“Tony!” Steve shouted.  “That is not—Tony, Zola is not set in his ways or making mistakes in his dotage.  He is evil.  He uses pain and threats to keep everyone too scared to say or do anything against him, but he is not who you think he is.”
“You couldn’t put another one in?” Steve asked.
Tony lifted his hips long enough for Steve to help him out of his pants, and he shimmied down onto the bed under Steve.  Steve broke away long enough to look down at him. His hands skimmed over Tony’s skin, slowing on the sharp jut of his hip bone, his elbow, the curve of his shoulder.  He was surprisingly well-defined. Not like Steve, but Steve could trace the muscles of his arms where they arched under Tony’s skin. He was tan all over, making Steve think of Tony’s remarks about hanging out by the pool.  He imagined Tony lying naked on some chaise next to an aqua pool, while Steve slathered sunscreen on his back, and found himself smiling.
He could practically hear Bucky’s laughter in the background.  He wasn’t good at this stuff under normal conditions.  In this situation?  He was hopeless.
The truth was, fixing any of it seemed all but insurmountable.  They had to try, of course. Not just because of the circumstances, but that was just who they were.  None of them were built for walking away.
“Were you raised in a cult?  How did you miss Star Wars?” Tony demanded incredulously.  “Star Trek?  No?  Seriously?” Tony said when Steve shook his head.  “Okay, well, we have a lot of catching up to do, sounds like.  What about Lord of the Rings?”
Steve turned his head, fast and clearly unexpected.  Rumlow screamed, almost a gurgling sound, as Steve’s teeth found a hunk of flesh and tore.  Blood spurted into his mouth.  Coppery, he thought, somewhat dazedly, before someone yanked at his collar, jerking his neck back and taking the tip of Rumlow’s ear with him.  A blow to his lower back sent him flying off the bench and face forward onto the sand.  He spat out what was in his mouth and glanced up.  Rumlow was holding a hand to the side of his head, shouting and blubbering while rivulets of blood streaked down his neck.  Steve grinned, feeling a wild looseness flow through him, even as the guards wrenched him to his knees.
"Told you" Tony said, turning to Steve.
Of course, there was the minor complication that whatever Steve may have felt for him once upon a time, Loki had removed all of that from his memory, and this Steve either didn’t know or refused to acknowledge that anything beyond friendship with Tony was even a possibility.  So, a bump in the road, as it were.
The wrongness of it, the incomprehensible wrongness of the whole thing, soured his stomach, making it roil and turn over.  He looked up and stared at the blank metal of the jet’s hull in front of him, one hand gripping the bags of blood while he tried to make some sense of something that refused to compute.  404 Error, he thought, with an edge of hysteria.  There was a low ringing in his ears.  He could hear it, drowning out the voices behind him, saying things he didn’t want to know.  He forced a deep, shaking breath into his lungs, and braced a hand against the side of the jet above his head, letting his weight lean into it for a moment.
“Tony,” Pepper entreated softly. “It's okay, you know? To love him. I'm not saying you do. At all,” she clarified quickly. “But. If you do. It's okay. We all do stupid things when we're young. I mean, you've seen the pictures of me with a perm, right?” she teased with a wobbly smile. “Five million dollars? That's security for a lifetime when you're nineteen. I'm not saying it was right, not at all, it was terrible, and you deserve so much more, let me be the first to say, but...if he's who makes you happy...then, that's okay, Tony. You don't have to justify anything to anyone. Not me. Not James. We just want you to be happy. You know that, right?”
“How are you doing?  I’ve tried not to bother you.   I know how it is, newly Bonded and all,” she said with a tittering, nervous laugh.  “Probably don’t want to hear from your poor, old mother, now that you have your Alpha, but you could at least email sometimes, Anthony.  Your father and I were beginning to worry.”
He wanted to leave.  He wanted to be done, but they were here again.
Steve shut the balcony door on whatever Tony was going to say in response and pulled out his phone.  He stared at it for a long moment, then looked down over the Strip where the morning sun was already making it spark and flash with a trying-too-hard sort of brightness.  He hit the contact button for Bucky and waited out the rings.  It went straight to voicemail, which helpfully told him it was full before clicking off.  Figures, Steve thought.
Tony was watching his movements, his hands running up and down his stomach, skimming over his nipples until they pebbled, and Steve felt his mouth water. Tony wasn’t touching himself, not yet, but coming close enough that Steve reached up and circled a hand around the throbbing length, stilling Tony’s movements where his hands splayed wide across his chest, fingers brushing over the disc where it sank into his chest in a cradle of raised, puckered skin.
Tony studied his reflection again, smoothing the lace that flared above the satin bodice so that it flattened to a vee in the center of his chest.  His dog tags swayed a bit at the movement where they hung just above the low point of the bodice.  He reached up and wrapped his hand around them, holding them tightly in his palm for a moment.  Sometimes, it almost seemed to him that if he held the tags hard enough and long enough, the raised lines of Steve’s name and serial number would imprint into his skin, marking him, so everyone would know who he belonged to and who belonged to him.
“It was just an offer, Steve,” Stark said, gently enough that it felt a bit like an apology and left Steve reeling in his own righteous anger, which, yeah, he could admit was at least partially due to Stark’s question and his guesses hitting a sensitive spot.
“You got plenty of finer points, Tony, and the least of them is your money,” Steve countered.
Great.
“Yesterday, you said that you saw them and thought how it could have been you.  I suppose the thought stayed with me, and…well. Lord Rand will have replacements for them in no time, though I’ve promised him a machine to do the work eventually.  It is nothing. A single drop in an ocean. I don’t even know why I did it, except to please you, of course,” Tony sighed, raising his eyes to Steve. “But, I could not leave them there.”
“I suspect they would like that very much, indeed,” Tony replied, casting a quick look over the boy’s head to Steve.  “Keep at your studies and perhaps you will meet them one day.  Your tutor says you are his brightest student.”
Or, Steve hoped it was still there.  It only showed on a few of the older maps in Tony’s collection, and Steve had no way of knowing if it had become impassable due to some calamity over the years, but it was his best chance.  Horses couldn’t follow, so being on foot wouldn’t be a disadvantage. The high ground would let him see anyone approaching. And if he was right, it would lead, eventually, to the other side of the mountains and the sea beyond, where he hoped he could find safe passage back home.
“What?” Steve demanded with a frown. “What do you mean lost both of us?”
“Excellent.  Well, then.  Should you require anything further, send your boy to arrange it,” Zola told him, flattening his mouth into a thin line.  “As always, we want to ensure the King’s happiness in all things. As I am sure you do, as well,” Zola continued.  “You understand the importance of that, I am certain.  The King is…very generous, when he is pleased, but, like all men, he is fickle in his interests. Nothing lasts forever.  Something to…bear in mind.”
Beer and pizza and an episode of the Daily Show later, Steve wrapped his arms around Tony as they lay curled in bed, the muted TV still flickering in the background.
Deep breaths, he told himself.  Count by sevens.
Seemingly satisfied with the state of Tony’s cock, the alien gave his hand a final twist, flicking his wrist around the head, and withdrew, waving the gel back around Tony’s throbbing length.  He could feel it prickle up and down his cock, rippling this way and that, creating suction here or there, friction in other places, soft laps of sensation in others, like the world’s best blow job/handjob/fleshlight.
Tony didn’t stop there. Instead, he trailed his tongue back down to Steve’s hole and circled it, again and again. Steve ground his forehead against his hands as his body shook under the tender assault. His knees quaked.  He couldn’t think. He barely remembered to breathe.  Small, nonsensical sounds--gasps, moans, and a low keening--filled the bedroom.  Steve realized they were mostly coming from him. Tony moaned against him, making an obscenely wet sound as he licke and sucked at Steve’s rim in earnest.
There was a space where the car had been, but the car wasn’t there anymore and Steve was walking up next to what was left of the railing, where it split into a large, gaping wound, with one side hanging off the edge of the mountain by a thin, twisted metal cable that twirled and banged against the side of the cliff.
Tony glanced up.  “Fantastic,” he said, going back to his phone. It was like these people learned general relativity from the back of a cereal—oh, hello, Tony mentally stuttered, thoughts grinding to a halt as his mind processed the image he’d seen.
“Here,” Steve said, rapping on the glass with his knuckles making a dull, hollow sound. Steve pointed at something, and for the first time Tony noticed a small locked handle on the side of the wall next to the glass.  He thumped over to it, footfalls of the suit echoing loudly in the empty room.  He stared at it dumbly for a moment, then looked up at Steve expectantly.  “It’s one of those slots they use to hand things to me when they can’t come in,” Steve explained.  Oh.  Oh, so if he opened that, he could be closer to Steve, be in the same air Steve was breathing, be almost able to—huh, how’d the handle get broken, he wondered, staring at the piece of metal in his hand as the screws hit the floor with light pings.
He had always known that Steve would love him as he was.
“That lie,” Anto said with a frown.  “Steve make joke.”
.  I’ve spent the past ten years doing what I thought was right to make things better.  Better weapons for our soldiers.  The scholarships.  Working for Omega rights.  Being an example.  None of that mattered.  None of it made a bit of difference out there.  To those soldiers in the Hum-vee.  We were—God, we were taking selfies and then my stuff,
Not exactly a choice Steve relished having to make, though it looked more and more likely that he would have to, whether he liked it or not.  He sighed wearily, then looked up as he caught sight of a familiar splash just off the bow. Shellhead’s head popped up, his face breaking into a rather pleased-with-himself look when he caught sight of Steve. He chittered a bit, not quite excitedly, but Steve could almost imagine him giving Steve a bit of a go in some droll tone while he teased out whatever it was he wanted to share with Steve. Because there was clearly something, Steve knew that much.
With a sigh, Steve turned away from the armor and let his gaze roam over the rest of the room.
“Don’t apologize,” the King said quickly, cutting Steve off.  “Let us say that I find it…refreshing,” the King finished with an odd sort of half-smile and that same intent, puzzled look that Steve was growing familiar with.  The King waved a hand at him, stood, walked over and cupped the sides of Steve’s face in his hands.
Steve thought he could hear the lie there, too, but didn’t challenge it.
Tony blinked and rolled his eyes, then scrunched his face up and shifted again and scooted up, until he was lying flat across Steve’s chest with his feet pointed down between Steve’s legs.   His dog tags lay bunched up in front of him, one on top of the other.  He reached out and picked at them with the edge of his finger, absently tracing the letters and numbers there, though he knew them from memory.
Tony lifted Steve’s hand, threading his fingers through Steve’s, which forced Steve’s fists to unfurl, then placed a kiss to the inside of Steve’s wrist before gently placing the hand on top of Steve’s thigh. He did the same with the other hand. When he was done, he snaked under Steve’s arm and fisted it over Steve’s heart, like he was holding something in, and maybe he was.   He hadn’t realized he was shaking until Tony’s hand pressed firmly there, holding him tight against the press of Tony’s mouth against his back.
He sprinted back to the blanket, shook it out, and brought it and the basket down to the end of the dock where Tony waited.  He stopped at the edge of the dock, momentarily struck by how beautiful Tony was, standing there in the sunlight, his body framed by the dark water and green of the trees and reeds behind him, like he stumbled into a Monet painting and made it coalesce around him somehow.
“You really think the suit can fly?” Steve asked as the pencil flew over the pad in his lap.
, Tony sing-songed in his head with a dizzying sort of hysteria.   God, he thought, sucking in a deep breath.  He was probably going to end up in a room with someone asking him if he owned Catcher in the Rye.  He flexed his hands off the wheel for a moment, letting the fingers get circulation.  They shook, whether with the feeling returning or something else, he wasn’t sure.  He closed his eyes for a brief moment, then opened them and stared straight ahead through the windshield, letting the sun blind him until dark splotches danced in his vision.  He needed Jarvis’s special viewer. He needed Steve.  It was all mashed together in his head somehow, but if he could get to Steve, it would make sense.
If only.
This close to the sea, the tributaries that broke off from the River spread wide, some nearly as broad as the River herself, others, like this one, barely the breadth of a man. It rushed down over rocks smoothed by the ages into a small pool, the constant, pounding flow of the water enough to keep much of anything from growing in it, leaving the pool relatively clear of reeds and water plants.  He came upon it almost all at once, like it had simply appeared in front of him, sending him nearly stumbling down the flat, sandy bank that animals must still use to reach the clear waters.
“You gotta get some cassettes for it,” Stane added after a moment. “What are you kids listening to these days?  Osmonds or something?”
“Good-weird.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess that’s about right,” Steve said with a sharp laugh.  “Don’t you need to get to your meeting?”
Tony turned around and looked at him, long and hard, then, to Steve’s surprise, he took two long strides forward, grabbed Steve’s tuxedo jacket by the lapels and tugged at them, pressing himself against Steve’s body, eyes blazing.
Steve wanted to yell at the man, put some of the pain and guilt he’d been feeling the past week onto Happy’s shoulders, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it.  Happy clearly cared about Tony, and he had been trying to protect him.  Looking back, Steve could see how the whole thing might have looked from Happy’s point of view.  Would he have done any differently if he’d thought Tony was at risk of being used?
He felt the stretch and pleasant burn against the chill as Tony added a third finger.  It seemed like he was wide open. Gaping. He had to be. He was cold inside. Cold, and Tony was warm, like fire, searing and bright, and Steve wanted more. Wanted all of him.
“There was that,” Tony mused with a grin.  “It’s easy.  Isn’t it?  I know what you think.  Remembering all those good times, that I’m just trying to recapture some romanticized college fling.  We’re different now. Both of us.  You’re not wrong about that.  But, Steve, some things…some things don’t change.  How I feel about you?  That hasn’t changed And I’m betting it hasn’t changed for you, either.  Not really.  Not where it counts.”
“I handled it.  Though, I would suggest leaving those on until he learns his place.  He still lacks proper discipline, though I’m sure that’s something you are more than able to provide.  I’m told he was a soldier, once.  Raiders fished him out of the sea or some such story,” Lord Sitwell remarked.
“You know that’s not going to be my call,” she replied.
He was only late that once.
“Is this an ‘Ellis is fine’-fine or do you really want the tortellacci?” Steve asked, eyebrows raised.
“I—I guess,” Tony stuttered, trying to find his bearings, which seemed to be a constant state for him when he was around Steve. “I mean, it was a long time ago. They keep talking about going back. Or Mars. But, who knows? Budgets and all that. Guess science isn't a good investment or something.”
“You okay?” Tony asked.
He glanced back over at Steve, who was watching him with one arm laying across the car door below the window, his knuckles rubbing absently against the glass. There was a muscle ticking in his jaw.  Tony watched it pulse, counting the seconds as the silence stretched out.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Steve shot back.  There was danger here.  A warning bell seemed to be sounding distantly in the back of Steve’s mind.  He could taste copper in his mouth, flooding his senses, his body ramping up for a fight that he wasn’t sure he could win as easily as he had on the sparring mat. This was a different kind of fight, one played with words and lies, and Steve wasn’t sure he even knew the rules.
He cast a long, lingering look at Steve, who stood dumbfounded, waiting for Brock to...to say something.  Punch the guy.  Something.
“I know,” Steve said. “I’m sorry.”
“How many medals do you have?” Tony asked, canting his head slightly to the side.
“No jumping on the bed.  If you build a pillow fort, you have to put them back when you’re done,” Tony said.
“He has already chosen you, Tony.  Inartfully, perhaps, but I believe he is trying,” Jarvis told him gently.  “He does not see that you have already chosen him, as well.”
Tony lifted his head enough to look at the door, steadfastly ajar. He wished Steve would just get it over with. Okay, that wasn't true. But, it was a good lie to tell himself, he supposed, as lying to yourself went. Lie back and think of the garage, he told himself with a semi-hysterical bubble of laughter. How many times had he let his mind fill with numbers and machines, beautiful machines that could be more real than whatever was happening to him if he let them. He could do this. It was just sex. People did it all the time. Omegas were made for this, right? It was what his body was supposed to do. Take his Alpha's knot. How bad could it be?
“Right.  So, being the responsible citizens that you are, you called the police and let them do their jobs in the usual efficient and able manner in which the New York PD handles these kinds of things down in Flatbush,” Tony nodded sagely.
“Stay away from the Ul and his people, will you?” Tony requested in a clipped voice. “They are not to be trusted.”
“We should all eat. Clean up a bit,” Tony suggested, looking out to the sea.  As soon as Tony said it, Steve’s stomach decided to remind him it existed.
“Holy
That was the thing that made Steve’s insides squirm in mortification and seem to heat until they melted.  Pulses of pressure sparked down into the shaft of his cock, building, building, building against the head.  And still, Tony knew.  It was the most wonderful, awful, mesmerizing feeling. He didn’t know what to do, and for a moment, he could feel the edges of panic set in.  He blinked at Tony. Licked his lips under the veil. Swallowed. His throat was parched. He could hear his heart pounding in his ears.  He needed something. He had no idea what.  No words would come. No request formed. No entreaty. All his plans for what he would do when he was finally alone with Tony were gone, and there was just…too much. Too much to feel. Too many thoughts in his head.  Too many things he wanted.  He didn’t know what to do. A soft, involuntary cry escaped him.
“We don’t have to,” Steve said quickly.  “Undo it, I mean.  We don’t have to.”
“I...I hope so,” Steve replied.  “I’d like to help. With...with whatever you need.  The Harem, Stane, all of it, if you’ll let me.”
“Um…Coke, I guess,” Steve replied, giving Tony a questioning look.
“I’d like to ask his parents for permission to Court him,” Steve said, repeating his earlier words.
“Now, that wall,” Tony said conspiratorially as he tugged at the lapel of Steve’s jacket and nodded at the wall to their right where a painting of a ship in a storm hung next to a number of plaques from various organizations lauding Howard’s many accomplishments, which seemed to coincide with donations, as far as Tony could tell.  Man of the Year, sign here, please.  “Is a bearing wall.  So, pretty solid. Just pointing that out.  For no reason.  Well, architecture.”
.  Whatever’s next. I don’t know.  I don’t know, okay?” Tony sputtered.
“Like what you see, Soldier Boy?” Kirk asked, making Steve jerk his gaze up from where he had apparently been staring at the man’s dick.  “Don’t worry about it.  It’s got a mind of its own.  Feel free to Dirk Diggler the hell out of it.  If I see some tiny Renaissance penis on this thing, we’re going to have words.  You can do my face, by the way. Wow. I didn't even see that one coming.  Second wow. I'm on a roll. I blame you, hot stuff.”
“You realize that you are literally making my point for me.  Anyway, I’m not saying it wasn’t funny,” Steve said quickly, holding his hands out in surrender.  “Not sure I’d shoot for refined, though.”
.  All of them.  Whatever.
“We don’t need to consider it,” Steve said. “We’re sure.”
“Look how cute we are,” Tony said, holding up his phone where the picture from a moment before had popped up on his Twitter feed.  “JARVIS?” Tony called out.
“Yeah?” Tony said.
They didn’t, but it wasn’t long before Steve thought they regretted the choice.  When it was over, he stood among them, breathing heavily, the shield at his feet where the men were in strewn various states of discomfort and looked up at Tony, who was staring at him, mouth agape, like he had just sucked in a breath, eyes wide and darkened, though they gleamed with a fierce sort of avarice Steve had rarely seen cross Tony’s face.  A tremor ran through Steve’s body.  He looked down at the shield, lifted his foot and slammed it down on the edge, catching it with one hand as it leapt into the air, then looked up at Tony again.
“Steve signal,” Tony said.
“You passed,” Tony assured him.  “Steve! I want him.”
Steve sucked in a breath and his  hips thrust against Tony’s hand of their own accord at Tony’s words.  Steve thought he might have tried to speak, but it came out as just a long, stuttering groan that might have started as Tony’s name.  His head exploded with desire, and the breath that came out of him felt like someone had punched him in the chest.
any of it, and if he was going to sin, as all men must, he’d like to think he would at least remember it. Yet, there was nothing but a cloudy darkness and a vague sense of someone--
“Okay,” Tony said, glancing over at Steve before dropping his gaze down to his shoes.  They were still shiny, catching a bit of the glow from the low lights that illuminated the back of the limousine.
“Don’t know. Never tried it,” Tony admitted, flashing Steve a grin.  “France, huh?  Well, thank France for me, would you?  Do I have to call myself the Nutty Professor?   Wow, the militarizing of our resident squirrel population went unexpectedly ironic, didn’t it?  I draw the line at wearing a beret, though, just so you know.”
“Up pops the Devil,” the stickman called, indicating a seven, though Tony caught the knowing smirk and had to forcibly suppress the desire to roll his eyes.
“If you’re going to keep doing that, what I say is going to get a lot more interesting,” Tony warned him  in a droll voice.  “We were thinking that maybe you and I, we just…sort of…keep, ah…going.  Obviously, if it doesn’t work out, we’d ‘divorce’ or whatever,” Tony rushed out, making air quotes with his hands.  “Go our separate ways.  Nice bit of alimony for you. No harm, no foul,” he finished weakly, flattening his mouth into a grim line and turning to look out the window as the limo pulled up next to the entrance to their hotel.
.  All of this. I guess I’m just trying to get my bearings here a bit.”
“You see what you did there? You hit Sharknado Plot Stage. Cheers,” Tony said, clinking his Captain America mug to Rhodey’s bottle of the equivalent of chocolate flavored meth.
It went on like that for a while, the two of them trading stories and questions, most of them innocuous, but sometimes, Tony would say something, something meant to be flippant that wasn’t, like his first crush, some boarding school classmate with what Steve decided was the asshole-sounding name of Tiberius, and sometimes, Steve would share a memory of his mom or the hospitals, being sick all the time, and there would be this moment…Steve was starting to recognize them more and more, these moments that felt more real than others with Tony.
Not that any of that fine philosophizing would matter if he could not make it back home.  And Steve knew to do that, his chances were far greater outside the city, where he could disappear into the mountains, and Tony…Tony could tell anyone curious whatever tale suited him, Steve told himself with a pang of something bright blooming in the center of his chest.  An accident, perhaps.  That was plausible.  Some terrible fate that befell his concubine.  People would nod and understand. These things happened.  No one would question it, or if they did, they would hold their tongues. Tony could save face.  Tony could—Tony could move on. Forget about Steve.  Find someone else, someone who would…cherish Tony.  Appreciate him.  Someone who would love him, even, deeply and without reservation, the way Tony deserved. Steve wanted that for Tony.  He did.
“You found me,” Steve said, his voice slow and thick-tongued.
Shit, his mind blared.  How many times had they hit him with those darts?  What kind of concoction was in those things anyway?  Enough to overdose someone?  Tony tried to roll and managed to make it to his back, so his hands were underneath him. He tried to scoot his hands out of the plastic bindings to no avail.  His phone was gone from his pocket.  Damn.  That would’ve been too easy.  He had to think. Quickly.  Steve. Steve, the perfectly nice guy who draws Iron Man and likes Men in Tights, who was now probably in a ditch somewhere, if he was even alive.  Tony shook his head.  No.  He wasn’t going to think that.  Steve needed help.  He needed Tony to escape and get 911 or Cho or
This was not fine.
The garage door closed behind him with a soft snick, and he heard the reassuring beeping of the keypad resetting. A part of him still couldn't believe Steve had capitulated so easily. It probably wasn't going to last, but he'd take what he could get.
“Well, shall we, husband dear? The night is young, as they say,” Tony said.  “Someone, and by someone, I mean Pepper, has tipped off the press to our evening plans, so try for besotted with a side of enamored.”
“There was a…cabinet behind you.  Glass.  With a bunch of…ceramics?  Plates, crystal, that kind of thing,” Steve said.
“Pep, this is Steve,” Tony said, without further explanation.  Except that was apparently explanation enough.
“Yeah, but…I mean, they could’ve ended the war.  Stopped Hitler.  Saved all those people,” Tony argued.  He curled his legs further up underneath him on the sofa and turned to face Steve with a frown.  “If you had that kind of power…why wouldn’t you use it?”
“You don’t have to like it, Tony.  It’s okay.  I keep…sorry.  Sorry, nevermind.  We’ll just…we’ll find you something else,” Steve replied, glancing out the window at the house, then forward, where Happy was studiously scrolling through his phone, having gone temporarily deaf, apparently.
Steve leaned his head down until his mouth was against the shell of Tony’s ear.  “Anytime,” Steve vowed, the word almost a growl, making Tony shiver.  “I have to go,” Steve said.
Just two guys being fake-married pals, sitting inches apart, almost holding hands, trading wedding rings.
“And then I wouldn’t have met Tony, so—so don’t ask me to regret it, okay, Buck?  Because I don’t,” Steve added, turning towards Tony. “I don’t.”
Tony was looking down between them, watching his hand work at Steve’s cock, so Steve let his gaze crawl over the familiar lines of Tony’s face.  He wanted this.  This whatever it was with Tony.  No, he corrected.  He wanted Tony.  So, open a door, old man, he chided himself listlessly.
“You’re not weak, Tony. For God’s sake, you’re one of the strongest people I’ve ever met,” Steve cut in sharply.
“Think of it as a fancy pacemaker,” Steve said.
“Mine,” one of the armors by the end of the bed said.
“She’d have hated it.  Betty Carver, always getting in trouble and needing to be rescued.  She’d have punched Hitler herself,” Steve gritted out, looking down and across the lobby without really seeing anything.  “Let’s go,” Steve said sharply and started heading for the door, leaving Tony standing there next to Coulson without even looking back at him.
“He helped, alright. Helped himself,” Tony heard himself say, the words welling up from whatever pent-up spring of rage he'd been nursing for years. They tasted like copper and Scotch on his tongue, and he hated Steve a little for that. “He got exactly what he wanted out of it, don't worry. I'm one-hundred percent positive he considered it the best money he ever spent,” Tony spat the words out with more caustic venom than he would have said he had left for Howard, but he wasn't even really sure who he was talking about or to. Hating someone and loving them at the same time seemed to be his life's work, but that shit stopped now, he told himself as he reached out and wrapped his hand around the doorknob.
“I feel like that’s a gross mischaracterization,” Tony retorted.  Steve sank down next to him on the sofa, and Tony gratefully leaned his shoulder against Steve’s, a solid, anchoring presence in all the chaos.  Steve shot him an understanding look, then frowned at Fury, who had the good grace or sense or whatever to shift under Steve’s glare.
Tony would tell him he was being ridiculous. Tony would tell him a lot of things, but Tony wasn’t here, and he wanted to just… he wanted the control. That was it. The absolute control he had in the room. The complete and utter trust of the man behind the wall, without having to worry about whether he deserved it or not. He wanted that. Needed it.
“You should hear out you say my name,” Tony whispered breathily, face going soft and slack. “Like it is the most beautiful word you’ve ever heard.  I could hear it for the rest of my life and never grow tired of it.”
Steve blinked and gasped, folding over on himself on the floor.  Horrified shame crashed into him.  He had wanted it, begged for it.  Even now, his mouth opened and closed around an entreaty.  He looked down at himself, cock still dripping and straining for relief.  He closed his eyes and sucked in a long, bracing breath, then slowly wrapped the loincloth around his hips.  His cock jutted out against the fabric, and each move and stretch of the material over the overly-stimulated skin there felt like agony.  He got to his feet on shaky legs and cast one last, quick look at the King.  The King did not return it.
.  Bah, he is a jealous one,” Cam continued with a breezy snort and wave of his hand as he finished counting and stuffed the coins back into the pouch.
…change.  Could happen.  With time, right? I mean, we’re Bonded, so.  Not like I’m going anywhere,” Tony said with a nervous laugh. Steve wouldn’t set him aside.  He wouldn’t.  He had promised.
Definitely going to happen. It was just…it felt so good, not just Steve’s body moving under him, rubbing against him in an effort to mark himself with Tony’s scent, though, okay, sure that felt great. It was…God, fuck, that felt great. There was some other thing, too, but who the hell cared? Tony could feel Steve’s cock hard against his stomach already, the tip leaking slightly, leaving a wet trail where it brushed over Tony’s skin. Steve’s hips began moving, rhythmic, insistent little thrusts against Tony’s thigh, his hands gripping Tony’s back, but not stroking or attempting to calm like he usually did, just holding on, as if he needed the anchor.
“Keep telling yourself that,” Tony replied, quirking an eyebrow.
“Oh,” Tony said stupidly.  What could he say?  He should have said something yesterday, when Steve asked about them dating, and he’d known that.  He’d fucking known that.  But he’d been selfish and, if he were honest, absolutely terrified he’d already lost something he didn’t know he had, and he’d wanted a day, just a fucking day to enjoy it.  Naturally, that backfired completely.  Why wouldn’t it?
“With the good Reverend’s suggested cure? Or drinking yourself to a stupor like your father? Do you think I don’t know your mind by now?  Anyway, I think not,” Tony scoffed, his face hard, and Steve was reminded again that this man--this creature--was a killer. Then, Tony’s face softened, and he seemed to diminish in some way, looking weary instead. “A vampire’s Claim is not meant to be idle, as it turns out. It
“Exactly,” Tony agreed, then caught himself frowning and rolled his eyes at Jarvis.  “Fine, so maybe I was a bit jealous.  A tiny bit.  A tad.  Speck.  Molecule of jealousy.”
“Anytime, man, you know that…but, you gotta work this thing with Stark out, man.  This isn’t good for you,” Sam said more seriously.  “Plus, I want better wings and Stark ignores me unless you ask,” Sam said with faux petulance.
“I think my sister, she got your message wrong.  Now, I think, maybe you wanted something nice and quiet, with just your friends, after all the banging and hammering and drilling at all hours, but then, as I was shivering in our shower—you know, the one that gets maybe, say, five minutes of hot water before it gives up—I remembered that I don’t care,” the young man responded.  “Oh, and welcome to the building,” he said, saluting Tony with one of Tony’s beers that he’d helped himself to from the ‘fridge.
“Always so warm,” Tony repeated, and then Steve felt a streak of cold down the center of his chest.  He sucked in a sharp breath. Oh. “So warm everywhere.” The line of cold dipped lower, over his stomach, to his belly button where it pooled for a moment.
“Is—is that from my—did you put beamed power cells on there?” Howard demanded, striding over and bending down to pick the robot up.  Steve watched Tony’s eyes track the movement and something, some kind of—of tightening happened to Tony.  Steve wasn’t sure how to put it into words, and there was so much going on in the frame, if he hadn’t been watching Tony so closely, he would have missed it.  This shift.  This…wariness.  A sharp stab of cold pierced Steve’s gut and he was leaning forward, gripping the side of the laptop as if he could reach inside, the word ‘No’ clanging to the front of his mind like a claxon. “Damnit, Maria, I’ve told him a thousand times, he just doesn’t
He was so fired.
“I’m not going to make it much longer if you keep doing that,” Steve admitted hoarsely.  “Sorry.”
“You could be a bit more appreciative, though, you know?  One tiny, little murderbot trying to destroy the world, and all of a sudden, it’s like you don’t trust me,” Tony mumbled absently as he ran the cloth over Steve’s head and down his back.  “You didn’t know what to do about it, either, you know?  Protecting the Earth.  You were just as lost as I was.  And now, somehow, we’re back where we started.  Granted, one of us is taking that a bit more literally at the moment.”  Tony dropped the cloth into the bath and took one of the cups, using it to pour some water over the back of Steve’s head to wash the soap bubbles away.
“Put the lighter down, Joan,” Steve said, making Tony frown in confusion.  “I’m hardly the only one with a martyr complex at this table, Tony.”
“No—no, you’re right.  You are.  God, I mean, I want it to all be Howard’s fault, because I can just keep on hating him and leave the side of self-loathing out of it, but—okay. Okay, look, so…,” Tony stopped and cleared his throat.  “I haven’t thought about kids.  I’m…open to it.  I’m selfish enough to want you to myself for a while, but…kids.  Not hating the thought.”
“Buck—“ Steve started.
The file whirred to life, and Steve blinked at the sudden brightness.  Not lights this time, but sun, radiant and high, catching the camera’s lens head on for a moment before the angle shifted.  Off to one side, he heard a splash, followed a moment later by high-pitched shrieks of laughter.
“Please don’t have this argument,” Nat said with a shake of her head.  “Again.”
“What?” Steve’s head snapped to him, eyes searching his face, maybe looking for mockery or the joke that he was missing, Tony wasn’t sure.
“No, no, it’s fine.  I shouldn’t have—I shouldn’t have done that,” Tony replied, finding he meant it.  That had been a boneheaded move, for any number of reasons.  “Nothing to be sorry about, Cap,” Tony assured him, probably too quickly for it to be entirely believable.  “Look, it’s late.  Long night.  We’re both tired.  Let’s just…can we just forget this?  I don’t know what the hell I was thinking. I wasn’t thinking, let’s just leave it at that, okay?”
Tony was talking.  Of course he was, Steve thought with a familiar fondness attached to the knowledge.  It sounded oddly distant, but it seemed to slowly get louder, as if Tony was approaching from afar, and then, suddenly, he was right there, next to Steve, all warm, sweat-slick skin and damp curls of hair pressing against his temples.
He shouldn’t have doubted.  He never should have doubted.  Never.  He looked over his shoulder, out the open garage door and caught sight of Steve standing at the railing of the deck, looking out over the valley. Waiting.   Steve had been waiting for a while, though, hadn’t he?  For Tony to catch up.  Polaris, Tony thought, with a bright, sure clarity.  I didn’t want him to love it or hate it, just accept it, Tony realized.  I just missed that he already had.
needed to happen this weekend.  A getaway had been his idea after all, and he’d practically twisted Brock’s arm to get him to agree to this trip in the first place. Steve had suggested just getting a place upstate, but Brock wanted Vegas, and, well, that was fine and all, but with the flights and getting to the airport and all, they didn’t really have a whole lot of time left to be together this weekend.
“Years?” Tony repeated.  “
Maybe there are other paths.  Other ways.  He sees me.
“Statistically speaking, the IQ of lawyers is much closer to the average.  I spotted you ten points though,” Tony replied, grinning widely.
“Hey man, this is kind of a private party, so…” Preston said.
“Tony, stop.  You’re not buying the building. That’s—that’s ridiculous,” Steve said.  “He’s not—he’s not really doing this,” Steve told his neighbor.
“He stays,” Steve said in a puff of air that whited the oxygen mask.  “Don’ touch ‘im.” Tony swallowed and looked around the room with what he hoped was a ‘So there’ look while the heartrate monitor beeped its own warning.
“Promises, promises,” Tony said, quirking his mouth into a half-smile.
“The Gift may always be refused,” the alien replied with a confused frown.
“Every day,” Steve said, tapping softly at the edge of the glass in the frame.  He bent down and placed a soft, gentle kiss to Tony’s lips.  “I love you,” he added as he pulled away, smiling softly down at Tony.
“I’m here, Steve.  It’s okay.  I’m right here,” Tony said. It was silly.  Of course, he was right here, but it worked.  Sometimes, silly things did that.  He felt Steve’s hand loosen, settle, though Tony kept their fingers intertwined.   “I told you, there was no way for you to do anything, Steve, you were a world away, for Christ’s sake!” Tony said.  “Hey.  Hey, look at me,” Tony urged, tugging at Steve’s hand.  “We can’t both have debilitating guilt complexes at the same time, come on,” he said, giving Steve a rueful twist of his mouth that was trying to be a smile.  “It wasn’t your fault.  It wasn’t, Steve.”
“I tried!” Cam said with the air of exasperation only the young could manage.  “But, they did not come to me at all.  And I waited for
Tony went back to kissing him again, and Steve thought he could get used to this, the way Tony’s goatee scraped his chin and brushed over his lips, leaving them raw and swollen.  Tony’s hands had picked up their undulations as well, smoothing over his stomach and down his thigh, then back up again to spread across his hip and down the curve of his ass as Tony’s kiss deepened to something more. Steve felt a slight pull and found himself eagerly rolling towards Tony’s embrace, and couldn’t contain a gasp as he was pressed against Tony’s hard cock as Tony’s tongue darted deeper into his mouth.  Tony drew back and Steve’s mouth followed him of its own volition, he would swear.  Then Tony was moving on the bed, pushing pillows off and covers down haphazardly. Steve watched in a daze, still feeling sated and languid.  Tony turned to look at him, eyes glittering, pupils blown so wide there seemed to be no white left, and Steve blinked himself to realization.  Oh.
Tony smiled softly. “I’m… I’m very glad to hear that.” Steve watched him swallow thickly and glance away, blinking, before he turned back to Steve and smiled heartily, shoving a huge bite of donut in his mouth.
.  Come here often?  If I play my cards right, let’s say that’s a definite yes.”
“It’s okay,” Steve said, moving to get up his legs underneath him.  “I’ve had worse.” That was true, though he thought he had been pretty close to that not being true.  Maybe his father had gone home.  Or was sleeping somewhere in the forest.  Or maybe
Tony nodded, then shrugged.  “A lessor bargain, but one that placates him. For now.  He needs my navy too much to do more than be a thorn in my side about his disappointment.  Can’t very well move gold around the world without the bureaucracy of the Guilds, and they won’t work with privateers. And he knows my machines are half the reason he’s able to dig as deeply as he can, so he’s in a hospitable mood after spending years worrying that he would be the Rand to finally exhaust the Illum.  Rands have been mining gold from there since shortly after our people arrived,” Tony told Steve.
“Me neither,” Steve husked out.
“Yeah,” Steve agreed.
He twisted and repositioned himself a few more times, finally settling.  Closing his eyes, he tried to clear the thoughts from his mind, but he could feel them pulling at him.  He sighed, brow furrowing. A moment later, he felt a light stroke of fingers over his forehead and through his hair.  He huffed a low, pleased sound, and sighed again. God, that felt good. Shellhead hummed, a low, trilling sound that Steve could barely hear over the waves, but it never failed to soothe him.  He opened his eyes long enough to see Shellhead hovering above him, looking out at the sea while he threaded his fingers through Steve’s hair, an unreadable expression on his face. Sleep snuck up on Steve before he meant it to, but he dreamed again, this time that he was marching, marching in rows of soldiers, marching and singing, but it was all wrong.  It wasn’t, but it was, and he knew it, and only at the end of the dream did he realize the soldier next to him had a hole where his eye should be, and he was marching, marching forward, in rows of the dead, and someone was crying, and he needed to find them, but he couldn’t, because they were all dead, everyone was dead,
given it thought, he wouldn’t have imagined quite what he found.
letters, which need my attention,” he said, a hint of amusement in his voice, and Steve remembered,  yes, the letters were important. “So, I’ll have to trust you while I work. Can I do that?”
“You spoil him,” Steve said, watching the boy run off.
“M’good, Tony,” Steve replied, voice slurred and heavy sounding.  Tony waited what seemed like a long moment for him to elaborate.
“No one shows me. I just know,” Tony told her, still dragging his figure back and forth across the floor.  He hadn’t touched the robot again, Steve noticed with a pang.
space (and Steve wondered when he had begun to think of it that way), like he belonged there.  Steve hadn’t hated many people in his life, not really, truly hated them, but he was well on his way to making an exception for Stane.  “Anyway, I’m working on it, okay? So, just keep things on the downlow for a bit while we sort it out, that’s all I’m saying. No more press conferences,” he finished wagging a finger at Tony like he was admonishing a wayward schoolboy.  Steve was this close to slapping Stane’s hand away when he dropped it back down to his stack of chips and started lifting and dropping them into neat piles.
“Jarvis, there you are!” Maria said brightly as the camera jerked up.  “Tony, you are absolutely not to leave Mr. Jarvis’s side again, do you hear?”
“Take care of him, Peg.  He needs someone,” Steve said.
“Huh.  Don’t remember reading anything about that, but we don’t get a lot of East Coast news out here,” Tony replied.
Steve could hurt him.  But.  Somewhere along the line, he’d stopped thinking Steve
Tony tuned him out and tried to think up some plan for regaining Steve’s willingness to try this whole relationship thing that didn’t involve begging, lavish gifts and blow jobs.  Or, at least, best two out of three, he figured.  It took a few minutes for him to notice what Steve was doing, and when he did, this, for some reason, this was the thing that made the whole damn evening’s worth of shitty revelations almost too much.
too long.  We looked away, and plowed our lands, and planted our crops, and raised our families.  And then Schmidt came for the rest of us, and we said, why will no one help us in our time of need?  I asked that of you, remember?” Steve reminded him.  “We only saw an enemy when he was at our door, and by then, it was almost too late.  He was us.  In our ranks, in our government, standing next to us on the battle line with a knife at our backs. You are not the only one to miss something you did not want to see.”
“Me, too,” Tony agreed after a moment.  He looked down at the beer bottle in his hands for a long while, then back up at Steve.  “I don’t know the last time I did something like this.  Maybe never.”
“Er,” Lord Rand began.  “Your Highness?”
Steve suspected Tony was right. He knew Tony would never do such things. It was an exercise titillation, that was all. Putting these thoughts in Steve’s head like worms boring into an apple. He couldn’t explain why it drove him to madness, these things Tony sometimes spoke about, especially when he knew that was all it would ever amount to, talk. But something about the cadence of Tony’s voice, the low thread of pleasure and daring, the suggestion of a bright, horrible humiliation, somehow it all managed to coil heat through Steve’s gut and down his cock in a different way than even Tony’s touch could achieve.
“And what was the point of that little exercise?” Tony asked.
He resisted the urge to shift on his feet and held still, waiting.  Tony’s jaw worked, like he was trying to hold back whatever he might want to say. Steve could see the line of his shoulders tense as his hands curled into fists, and he huffed, a low, bitter sound.  He rubbed his arm across his face and looked away, then back at Steve with a shake of his head.  Whatever wisp-thin hope Steve might have had that this would go well and simply faded in an instant.
Tony turned on the kitchen faucet and watched the water flow into the sink. Running water. Running.  Was he running?  He didn’t know.  He didn’t know what this was.  Something had changed though, in that cave, and he couldn’t go back.  Worse, he wasn’t sure if he wanted to, and what did that say about him?  He splashed the cold water onto his face, then grabbed for the red-checkered kitchen towel that hung from the cabinet door and wiped it across his face.  For a moment, he could taste water in the back of his throat, fetid and metallic, filling his nose and mouth and closing off his airway.  His throat burned with the scrape of sand that wasn’t there.  He closed his eyes, forced himself to swallow past the taste that wasn’t really there, coughed and spit into the sink, a glob of saliva that had nothing in it.  Of course, it didn’t.
He opened his eyes and blinked, staring, for a moment, at the sky overhead.  Clear and blue with nary a cloud. Good sailing weather, he thought, almost begrudgingly, because it meant he had to think about everything else.  Today was the day. He would leave the island in hope of rescue, and while that thought, and a bit of rum, he conceded, had given him the courage last night to ask for what he wanted, in the light of day, it felt a bit like a yoke around his neck.
It was strange, Steve thought hazily, because the words seemed plucked from his own mind and echoed back to him.  It was Tony who was more than any man had a right to be.  It was Tony who occupied so much of the world, who pushed everything away and held it at bay for Steve, Tony who took all the air out of the room until Steve was lightheaded with it, dizzy and thin-minded, and floating.
“This is just one example of the evidence we’ve received of Mr. Stark’s
“It will be,” Steve promised.
His limbs felt like they were filled with lead, his motions sluggish, but he reached behind himself and spread his stinging ass apart.  He felt the metal cock move a little as his hole fluttered and stretched, and he craned his neck enough to look behind him where Tony stood.  Tony’s chest was covered with a glistening sheen of sweat.  He was breathing hard through his nose, chest rising and falling with each breath.  His hair was plastered to his scalp.  Steve could see the bulge of his cock hard against his breeches.  His lips were bright red, as if he had been biting them, and his eyes were wild and gleaming with a greedy possessiveness that made Steve tremble.  I’m the only one he looks at like that, Steve realized with a burst of insight.  I’m the only one he will ever look at like that.  He was the most beautiful thing Steve had ever seen.  He looked strangely…awed, Steve thought.  As if he was on the verge of being overcome, but that made no sense.  It was Steve who was coming apart, held together by numbers that filled his head.
Steve rolled over and stared at the wall, letting his eyes fall shut.  Duty.  Sacrifice.  A soldier’s way.  Keep telling yourself that’s the only reason why you’re wondering if he’ll send for you tomorrow, some traitorous part of Steve’s mind whispered as his heart sped up.  No! He didn’t want this.  He didn’t want any of this.  He wanted to go home, share his grief with Natasha, have Clint make them all smile, tell Sam what he could of this nightmare and let him tell Steve it would be alright, even if they both knew it was lie.
“No kidding,” Coulson snapped back.  At least he sounded annoyed, too, Tony thought, relishing a bit when the doctor had the good sense to look abashed.
“Because they were boring and obnoxious,” Tony objected.
“Hey,” Clint said in a slightly affronted-sounding voice. “I was helping.”
“Steve?” Pepper called out, expression going soft.  “I know this is crazy.  Don’t help, Matt!” she ordered briskly, cutting the lawyer off before he could interject.  “You really are doing the right thing.  I know it might not seem like it—what with the lying to the police and pretending to be married because
“What?  No!” Steve said sharply, dropping his hands onto the table with enough force to make the silverware clatter against the plates. “It’s…there’s a reason everyone is skeptical of this relationship, Tony.  You have to see it?  You and me, we don’t seem to really fit together, at least not from the outside. I mean, I’m a—I’m me.  No one.  And you’re
“It was not a tricycle. It was a three-wheeled bike,” Rhodey said at the same time Tony repeated the same well-worn phrase.  Rhodey shot Tony a disgruntled look.
toes weren’t cold, Tony would bet.  Steve was always warm, like his body remembered being cold enough for a lifetime and refused to allow it to happen again.
The caravan set off at a slow, but steady, pace two days later, wagons loaded with supplies and the parts of armaments they’d broken down the day before. The journey back took several weeks with the wagons and armaments they’d brought with them, a long road made particularly difficult with many of the roads and bridges still in the condition they were after Pierce’s march north.
“Tony.  I think you know that wasn’t all of it.  He couldn’t have done what he did to us if our relationship had been half as strong as how we felt,” Steve pointed out.  “Being in love with you, that’s the easy part.  Always was.  But us—us together, I mean.  We gotta be on the same page from the get-go.  I can’t…all that.  I can’t do that again.  And if we go at this the wrong way, or to make up for something we missed, then we’re just going to end up making each other miserable.”
“Cam!” Tony cautioned, trying for stern but having to cover a laugh.  “Bloodthirsty, isn’t he?” Tony said to Steve.
“You’re going overboard there, big guy, but thanks,” Tony laughed and patted the alien’s hand where it was splayed wide over Tony’s huge belly.  He turned his head slightly, catching the vivid blue eyes watching him like twin crystals.
“I didn’t know what you liked,” Steve said over his shoulder as he dug a wad of bills out of his pocket and handed a few to the driver.  “Hope something here is okay.”
“Huh? Yeah. Fine. It’s fine,” Tony muttered, ducking his head.  “It’s—I’m fine.”
“Of course,” Coulson said, giving Tony a long look before pushing up from the table.  “I should be getting back to SHIELD.  This—I know it’s a shock.
“Home,” Steve answered after a moment.  It sounded more barbed than he meant.  Deliberately cruel, but he couldn't seem to help himself.  His head was a storm of emotions. He couldn’t think.  Tony’s words left him reeling, unsure of what it all meant. He should just tell Tony the truth, but he couldn’t seem to make himself, not after everything Tony had said.  I saw you, he thought to himself. I saw you, and I loved you more than anything.
the plaid shirts.  Please don’t burn them in effigy or something entirely overly dramatic,” Tony said as he slid into the back of the SUV and buckled his seatbelt.
“Oh, yeah, all good things, of course! I mean, when you know the right people, word gets around, right? Hey, how about we get ourselves out of this heat?  Give you a tour of the facility, let you meet some of our people?  We’ve got a lot going on, Mr. Stark,” Estes told them with all the charm of a used car salesman, as they turned towards the building.  “Going to blow your mind, I’m telling you—”
“You’re like Peter Jackson’s dream fan, aren’t you?  Don’t worry, you’ll love it,” Tony promised, taking a large bite of pizza.
“I’m not going on a blind date.  Not happening,” Tony said, pushing himself off the creeper and climbing into the driver’s seat of the roadster.  “Okay, first, I can get a date on my own.  You might not know this,” Tony said, wagging his head a bit and squinting at her, “but, I’m kind of what you’d call eligible.  Second, why doesn’t Michelangelo just get his own date? What’s wrong with him?”
“Uno isn’t for the weak,” Steve agreed, then smiled widely, making Tony suspect he wasn’t the only one a bit tipsy.  “Only the strong survive,” he agreed.
“Unh,” Tony managed to half-gasp, half-groan.  He tried to speak, but no words came out. He blinked slowly up at Steve, then reached up to wrap his hand around the amulet at his neck.  “Alpha,” he husked out, head lolling back against the furs. He hummed with pleasure, body quaking with small tremors. “Steve.”
Steve held his tongue.  He wasn’t sure what he could say. Sometimes, he thought.  Sometimes, I think that.  An answer, but not the one the King wanted, Steve knew instinctively.  The King’s expression hooded for a moment, and he rubbed a hand up and down his face, shaking his head as if to clear it.
Rhodes, or someone, had, in fact, ordered Tony a cheeseburger and fries, along with trays full of pretty much everything on the menu, it turned out.  A round of applause, whistles and whoops greeted them as he and Tony emptied out of the elevator and headed for the dining table that looked like it might bow under the weight of the food.
That was cruelty, Steve thought. It was. It had to be. Wasn’t it? Cruelty to Tony or to himself? He wasn’t sure. Both of them, maybe. Probably. He knew he hated himself for saying it, and wanted nothing more than to keep saying it. He meant it, he knew that. Here and now, he absolutely meant it, but it settled wrongly in his gut, the words seeming to curdle as the moments ticked on. Tony’s happiness was real, and there was hurt enough to come later. Would this memory lessen the sting or rub salt into it? Steve didn’t know.
Steve wanted more.  To see more, feel more, touch Tony the way Tony touched him.  Suddenly, the image of his own lips wrapped around Tony’s cock appeared unbidden and fully formed in his head, and he felt his mouth water as saliva pooled.  He wouldn’t be able to do what Tony had done, but he wanted to, wanted to know what he would feel like, filling his mouth. What Tony would taste like on his tongue.  He didn’t let himself hesitate, just bent his head down and took the head of Tony’s cock in his mouth, sucking lightly at the delicate skin and salty fluid.  Tony’s whole body jerked, and his hand shot out to grab Steve’s hair, winding a fist into it.
“There’s three.  I missed the one over the desk.  Fuck, I think it’s about teamwork.  I hate it here,” Tony groaned, letting his head loll to the side.  “I don’t know where here is.  Ty drove.”
“I have to go,” Tony rasped out, turning towards the door.
“I didn’t say you were!” Tony retorted, turning around to glare at Steve, who was watching him with narrowed eyes and probably grinding his teeth to sand from the look of his jawline.
“Figured I’d go for broke,” Steve breathed out, aiming for teasing, but it came out high and needy.  Steve drew back enough to look down at Tony, one hand coming up to cup Tony’s jaw. There was wonder and hope and even a little something like fear there, and Tony was fairly sure the same was reflected on his own face, though whatever Steve saw there must have been enough to convince him, because his expression softened, the edges waxing away, leaving something in its wake that was too true and pure to be anything other than what it was.  “While I was getting everything I wanted.”
“Obviously. We still don’t know all of what Erskine’s formula can do.  As you know, he was the only success.  Many people think that was because Erskine insisted on using an Omega for his trial, but with the formula lost, we’ll probably never know for sure.  Anyway, he’s here, and he is, by rights, an Avenger, so that makes him your business, Stark,” Fury explained.
Coulson hummed in response, paused, then looked up at the numbers above the elevator, as if they might hold some answers.  “And has strike team business been handled or can we expect additional strike team business in the future?”
