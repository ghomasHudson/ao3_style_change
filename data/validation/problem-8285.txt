“I… don’t really know, to be honest with you,” Tony answered, dazed. “I, uh… It’s a… vampire, thing…I think.”

seen him, because he was floating so high on his own excitement by then that he’d lost all connection to the real world. By the time he began the ascent to his house, somewhere around midnight, he could barely remember how he’d gotten there - he might’ve walked right into a photographer and he wouldn’t have known it.
“Jesus Tony,” Steve breathed, rushing to unbutton Tony’s shirt, running his fingers over every inch of newly exposed skin as he went. And then he dropped his head to kiss Tony’s chest, and the thrill of it actually caught him off guard; having so much of him, having it be this real. The softness of him and the taste of him, the way he arced up into it. The almost pleading little sigh…
Steve let go like that…
Even in his rapidly encroaching feral state, Tony remembered that The Diary was

In the end, it was petulance and cowardice that won out. Tony knew that his next words were more about reasserting his right to the moral high ground than any imperative to say them.
And Steve sort of stuttered mid thought, as it suddenly occurred to him

Steve stepped aside to let Tony stride past him, taking the opportunity to run his eyes over Tony’s back… He was wearing one of those beautiful, expensive suits that had been tailored to hug every sweep and curve of his body. The excitement in Steve’s stomach began to simmer down into something slower and hotter, as he followed Tony through to the living room, watching the roll of his shoulders, the rhythm of his step… There was a particular spark as he noticed the black silk shirt - not only because he’d always loved Tony dressed all in black, but because he knew that Tony
The automatic lights had turned themselves off again… Steve didn’t know how long it’d been since he lost patience with waving his arms to wake them up each time. And, anyway, lying here in the shadows seemed more fitting, somehow.

“Yeah,” he grinned. “And I promise to do my best to explain how the hell you did it, and I’m guessing you’ll be able to work it out from there - you did the first time… But the point is that I already know you.

basis for the nagging, emotionally manipulative counter argument that kept piping up in his head.
By then it wouldn’t even have occurred to Steve to scream or cry or beg. By then, those were things he just didn’t do.
And neither of them could control it when it did.
“Oh, God, that,” Tony groaned. “Well… The short answer is that it’s just a power station, and it doesn’t give us any more idea what’s going on here… And, if I’m honest, I’m starting to think that nothing else

“FRIDAY: alert all Avengers to come to the conference room immediately, we have an imminent threat”
Zan just shot him a withering look. And seeing as she didn’t outright call him an idiot, he assumed the truth serum had worn off.
But he trusted Tony.
What Steve had was the lived experience of how SHIELD, and The Avengers, and The Accords, and everything else besides, had worked out in the first timeline.
It began, as it always did, with that little surge of relief. A rush of light-headedness, as Steve’s ribs relaxed enough for him to take a comfortable breath.
Christ, he could really feel how strong Tony was, when he did this.
ALSO - again, I appreciate that this update is only telling one side of the story. I would just like to reassure people that the other side of this conversation is going to happen, from both party's point of view. Also, as much as I think Steve probably would have a strong reaction to all of this - please remember that he is on drugs here, is all I'm saying... (not that I'm nervous about this update, or anything...)
How nice it was, to feel the weight of someone sleeping next to him.

Maybe it was because that was the

But Tony clearly wasn’t worried about that, and therefore neither was Steve. Tony decided those things, now.
He knew this man was aiming at Bucky, that he
“Yeah, my bad – Tony called the office for you yesterday, and it’s very important you call him back,” Bucky winced. And Steve actually broke into a grin for just a fraction of a second – and he was beyond caring if anyone had seen it.
“Shouldn’t I be the one spoiling
It wouldn’t have mattered, if Tony hadn’t cared
And then he started again.
“It’s all I want,” Steve whispered, his throat tight with emotion.
Steve wasn’t sure whether he was relieved or mortified that she could read him so well.
“Please Tony – I just want you to live.”
He would’ve liked to ask exactly what Steve was implying. What he imaged Tony would be getting up to. Why he always thought the worst of him.

I’m not mad at you for wanting to help Bucky – I’m not even mad at you for choosing him over me. Maybe I was… and that would’ve been unfair, I guess...”
“Yes Sir,” Freddie nodded, with the ghost of a smile, “here to provide anything that might make your stay with us more comfortable.”
The fear of seeing Tony grew increasingly hysterical, as he remembered how much he loved him, how much he
Actually, it was something of a comfort to be able to look over to Bucky and get a sympathetic smile. Even though Steve would have hated for anyone else at the table to know what was going on, he was very glad that there was one person who knew

Everything he’d planned to say began playing in his head, all the lines on top of one another - along with all the worst possible consequences, however unlikely.
It wasn’t until Tony carried on talking that Steve realised-
“Jesus, guys!” Scott yelled, waving his arms. He managed to shock the group into a brief lull, which he used to give them all an incredulous look. “For God’s sake - you’re

. That maybe he should have some understanding of such a big event in Tony’s life, if he wanted to share that life with him…
His anxiety, and his hope, and his elation - and, most notably, his guilt - had grown steadily as he’d fully woken up, until he felt so much of everything that it was like not feeling at all. Like a tingling numbness he could feel on his skin, like a barrier between him and everything else…
“...Tony does, sometimes,” Rhodey replied, clearly surprised by Steve’s random outburst, but too stoned to think that deeply about it.
Steve heard Tony snort a laugh – so, apparently he’d heard it too. When he glanced up at Steve, he looked undeniably
Steve’s vision flashed with stars, his spine jarring with the inhuman effort it took to stay still and quiet. A more immediate desperation flared up in him, a wordless urgency shouting in his head.

He was vaguely aware of the computerised beeping of his own pulse, starting to increase as that twenty-minute deadline grew closer. He glanced up at the monitor once or twice, but wasn’t able to take in any of the readings… There were just too many things to worry about, for Steve to care whether he was about to have a heart attack.

Because, on a deeper level, he’d always been scared to commit to certain thoughts and feelings and personal traits… in case he needed to deny or ignore them, later.
And then there a strange, expansive emptiness just washed over him. Steve had been so focused on his immediate plan, so aware of the pressure to do something…
Steve’s instinct to protect him from the world… Didn’t feel bad…
“You optimistic fool.”
“Hey,” Tony smiled, holding a glass out for Steve to take. “What’re you grinning at?”

It was only a few notes about the blood. When it was taken. The readings from the little heart monitor. A few details about the serum and measurable effects it had on Steve’s biology, all of which he knew by heart, by now.
And why? What crime had Steve ever committed to warrant that level of intrusion? How had Fury justified it, to himself or his superiors or… God, Steve hadn’t liked to think who else might have known…
Tony looks relieved, and… touched.
Steve and Tony both snapped to attention, turning to face the man who was watching them from just a few feet away. A tall man with a round, kindly face and a solid body, dark olive skin and eyes that looked worn rather than wrinkled… It was impossible to guess how old this man was, or where he was from, or even what level of strength he might have been concealing, under his lab coat.
Steve was trying so hard to control himself.
Was he saying it would be okay, if…
If he’d been even slightly less sure of Steve’s love for him, Tony might’ve been threatened by that… But as it was…
. And, not just you, really – I always begrudged that
For a second, Tony was too busy thinking that Steve was adorable to recognise what he was saying. And then it hit him.
“And, okay,

And, okay, that wouldn’t have included a little tube of lube, if it weren’t for the fact that Steve had kept his jeans on the last time he fucked Tony. It was only that his pocket had been the easiest place to stick it when he was done with it – but Steve knew that’s what he’d done.
“It’s only been six weeks,” Tony reminded him, in a tone that added,
Tony looked at Sam and Bucky briefly, his sad smile breaking out into a genuine grin for the first time in hours. And then he turned back to the officer to answer, confidently,
But, as it was, Steve slid that glass panel back into its slot – and accidently ran the edge of it over his fingers.

comment he could possibly have pulled from the whole fucking debacle. And he’d had so many other points! Polished, practiced points that he’d carefully perfected over the last two years. Points about accountability and fairness and trust – grown up points, about professional behaviour and personal ethics. Instead of which, he’d chosen to whine about not being invited to Steve’s little team of Super Friends.
He thought of Steve baring his neck for him, letting Tony run his tongue along his throat, not being afraid-

His phone screen went dark, and instinctively Steve swiped it awake again. Every time he did that, he reminded himself that it was pointless. That he’d see the text either way. That he couldn’t make it arrive any quicker by being more prepared for it.
Because they couldn’t trust the person they were discussing it with to just
understand it, he didn’t know where this sudden burst of…
“Change the eco system” Steve repeated, unimpressed.
He groaned impatiently.
“Well, if you know how I’m about to get myself killed, maybe,” Tony frowned at him, stepping closer.
And Steve just burst out laughing. That head back, full laugh that Tony had seen him do so rarely… that laugh he’d always loved more than anything.
His entire body braced as his orgasm tore through him, at first just a blinding, overwhelming

big, outside the city.”
Belatedly, he recognised how kind Tony had been to him all evening. How calm and in control he’d been, throughout the whole ordeal. How gently he’d responded to all of Steve’s strange behaviour…
Steve braced one arm around Tony’s waist, his hand pressed firm against the opposite hip, locking Tony hard against him as he began to rock, softly. Tony let go of a trembling breath, his hands going to Steve’s shoulders as he moved to meet his rhythm-
…And Tony ignored it.

would only lead to a thousand other questions that Tony couldn’t answer. Probably a hundred well-meaning suggestions that Tony couldn’t possibly act on. God Bless Rhodey and his eternal optimism that Tony might one day be able to make a single step back into the world… But Tony wasn’t in the mood for it right now. He winced at the very thought of Rhodey suggesting he ask for Steve’s number, or pointing out that it was healthy to like people, or any of his usual encouragement. Tony didn’t want to have to argue with it. He didn’t want to have to think about it.

He felt like whatever difficulties there might be, there was
And Steve knew this meant he should stop, at least for a moment. That was a basic mission protocol, hardwired since his army days – if something doesn’t feel right, you have to check it out. If you have the opportunity to pause and reassess the situation, you should. That’s how you avoid ambushes and traps and moments of madness…
Like Tony, he’d immediately felt embarrassed by his paranoia, and the severity of his reaction… and then, like Tony, he’d second guessed himself -

“So, are you feeling a little more balanced now?”
Tony was just too clever, too adaptable, too impossible to beat. He’d found ways to hide his kindness, and his vulnerabilities, but they were all still there. He took all of those impossible, unfair burdens onto himself – but he wouldn’t let them best him. He’d found a way, after all those years, to put up a mask and hide the hurt and push beyond it, a way to reach out to people whilst still keeping his distance…
Without really thinking about it he lifted his glass, gesturing a little toast to nothing in particular.
And, Jesus, Tony just loved him

It was the abject terror that there might come a moment when he really did have a choice. A moment, like last night, when he knew exactly what they were doing… and that he
And then Tony stepped away, and there was the soft sweeping sound as Tony slipped his jacket over his shoulders.
Tony groaned, and sat up, and threw his arms out sulkily. Then he let  his head fall back against the couch, huffing angrily at the ceiling.
Tony sank back into his chair with a sulky huff.
And then they got in, and found themselves in a huge, white room. The end furthest from them was open, save for a low iron railing, which obviously overlooked something further down – something they couldn’t see from here. Beyond that Tony could just about make out a wall of lights and shadows, also white, moving in and out of focus as his brain struggled to make sense of the dimensions. And then Tony’s eyes adjusted, or caught some sort of flicker, and he realised – the three walls this room did have weren’t walls at all. They were screens, all switched on and set to a blank white channel.
And, oh, Tony’s hurt made even
“I love you,” he whispered, smiling against Tony’s skin.
I just wanted to leave a note to say thank you to everyone who is still reading this, and who has taken the time to leave comments - i feel terrible about how behind I am with answering them! (DH has decided that *right now* would be a good time to sell our house... Why? But WHY?) But, in the mean time, please know how much it means!
The part of him that had missed Steve so much – he hadn’t even realised how much, until he saw him again… but oh, to have just had a few more minutes with him, to have been able to talk to him for a little bit longer…
But he could so clearly see
So, Tony took the pill, and closed his eyes.
“...No, nowhere near that long, I don’t think,” he replied carefully, raising an eyebrow. “I’ll probably be finished by eight… and then I guess it’s not worth starting anything else, so… We’ll get a couple of hours off,” he grinned. “Why?”
A sudden alarm sounded in Steve’s head.
Steve’s blood flashed hot at the very sound of Tony’s name, an

Nick blinked, still shifting uncomfortably under Steve’s gaze, his eyes darting back and forth as he scanned for a way out of this…

Thinking about it, maybe this was more hurt than anger. Either way, it made Tony want to hit something.
...And that was all true, wasn’t it?
And then Jesse began to claw frenetically and fruitlessly at Tony’s hand, a visceral terror in his eyes, his chest fluttering in a desperate attempt to breathe.

this dangerous, possessive impulse…
“Mh-hm,” was as much as Steve could manage - along with a very enthusiastic nod. Tony’s smile darkened into a grin as he picked it up, like he knew how Steve’s blood would jump, seeing that collar in Tony’s hands… When their eyes met, the spark was so physical that Steve’s shoulders tensed upright under the power of it, his body pulling him forward even before Tony instructed him, calmly,
feeling.
Again, all very sensible – but a person’s subconscious never pays attention to such logical plans.
“Okay, I’m sorry that this isn’t going to make much sense, but we haven’t got time to explain it.” He explained in an urgent tone. “Have you ever heard of an alien warlord, calls himself Shawarma?”
– he might be able to get some sleep.
Hoping he wasn’t cold. Steve hated the cold.
“What? No. Why would you – that’s horrible, no,” he shook his head, his face screwed up like he’d bitten into something sour.
But he remembered well enough – it was nano tech. Just hold it up to any port and it will adapt to fit.
“Speaking of birthday surprises,” he announced, suggestively, as he unzipped one of the compartments on the side of the bag, “I have presents for you…”
Stape hissed, raising the gun at him-
He slid his phone out of his pocket, as he carried on talking to JARVIS,
Oh, but now Tony knew that voice for what it was…

That warm, slightly softer tone that Tony sometimes slipped into at the end of parties… That Steve had always liked a bit more than he should….
“Not much,” he answered, apologetically. “Most of the Project Rebirth file is experiment results and project notes… But… it did mention… Consorts…”
As subtly as he could, Steve began taking shorter, shallower breaths. He dug his nails hard into his palms, deliberately twisting his shoulders so that they were tense and uncomfortable.
Tony surrendered that last line like some terrible confession, his body stiffening as though he was bracing for Steve’s reaction-
“Why don’t you try it on,” Tony suggested, as he stood up from the couch. “I’ll be back in a minute.”
Looking at him, sprawled out on the couch, frowning up at the ceiling as he considered ideas at random, Steve could see the Tony that he’d only gotten glimpses of, during the brief time they were actually friends. It felt more like looking at Tony in his natural state, the resting position he was always being pulled away from-
All these weeks into this relationship, and Tony was still overwhelmed every time Steve kissed him. There was still that delighted amazement at the strength in Steve’s arms, and how soft his lips were, and how
Fuck, how could he not tell Tony that?
“How bad was it?”
It was like waking up in the middle of a busy New York street. The switch to consciousness was immediate – what took a few seconds was figuring out that this

Nothing he could say could be as wrong as that. He
“Come on, let’s go and see if any of the other couples are feeling chatty” He suggested.
He was so flooded with adrenaline by then, his desperation increasing as he grew closer to the end-
“It doesn’t help him to drive,” Rhodey muttered.
“Oh, yes, of course – lovely to have met you,” one of them answered, while the others just smiled amiably and waved,

He barely had time to recognise who it was before Steve was powering past him, striding urgently through to the living area and stopping in front of the couches. Then he turned to Bucky - with such an exaggerated look of exasperation that Bucky almost giggled again - and simply threw his arms out theatrically,

And then the strangest little flicker of discomfort crossed Steve’s brow. Tony saw him drop his eyes very briefly, and

lived in an internet enabled future for nearly ten years now, and he’d been in the army before that – there wasn’t much going on here that he hadn’t seen before, and certainly nothing he hadn’t heard of. And it wasn’t that he was disgusted or offended or shocked by any of it…
And, okay, at some point Steve would have to deal with the fact that all of those things were on the same list of things that made him feel better. He wasn’t sure what that would say about him, when he got around to processing it…
And then he relaxed just a little, when he realised that Bucky wasn’t aware of anything anymore, that at least he didn’t have to worry about Bucky being worried… Which, usually, was Steve’s cue to start worrying about everything else. When he’d start looking nervously between the monitors and the doctors, as though he could prevent a catastrophe if he was watching when it happened-
The swell emotion that rose up in Steve’s chest then was probably the only thing powerful enough to overwhelm the giggling. It surged through him as a sense of simple, wordless elation, an immediate recognition of everything that one line represented.

“When did I ever make you laugh before this?” Tony challenged… And Steve couldn’t believe that wasn’t an easier question…
Steve felt his stomach fall away from him, as he realised what Tony thought he meant-
Tony barked a frustrated groan at himself, all alone in his hallway, pausing mid-step so that he could screw his face up in anger.
He let go of a soft breath, his shoulders slumping under the weight of his guilt.
But it had consumed Tony’s thoughts, for a time…

“Hey, it’s okay-” Tony tried to reassure her, but an anxious look had already come into her eyes.
And then he saw Bucky curl his metal hand into a fist, pointedly, a silent reminder,

That, yeah, maybe Steve liked him well enough – and maybe that was enough for someone like Steve to take an interest, to want to help… to maybe get a bit too invested. And, if that was the case, maybe Tony could’ve made him see that he’d gotten carried away, that he’d offered too much of himself – that he couldn’t commit to helping every nice-enough stranger like this, and that was okay.
allowed to have some secrets, you know.”
Contrary to everyone’s awkward assumptions, Steve had picked up the actual workings of modern technology pretty well. The true purpose and modern ethics… not so much. But as a cognitively enhanced, at one time highly-trained strategist, he’d managed to master a smartphone…

He should know where they were, and what was going on, and what he was going to do about it…
And just that was enough to make his toes curl – in an oddly familiar, almost nostalgic way, actually. God, it’d been
“So… Why did you want to see me?” Steve asked, when it became clear that Pierce wasn’t going to start by telling him. He noted that this round-about way of talking was a SHIELD thing, and not merely a Nick Fury thing.
...Oh, and then he’d sat far too close to Tony, when they got back into the car.
Back when Pepper first started saying that, it was meant as a genuine deflection technique – something she used to suggest whenever Tony asked her to leave him in a particularly manic or depressed state. An excuse to spend a few extra minutes with him, so that she could be sure he’d calmed down and had moved past the temptation to do something reckless before she left him on his own. Of course, Tony worked out what she was doing years ago, and since then it had developed into a simple shorthand –

, another wave of it washing over him, taking his breath away all over again-

He felt Steve melt under his touch, like his body was responding directly. Tony stroked his hands down over Steve’s thighs, Steve’s legs falling further apart at the slightest suggestion, his head falling back against the sheets… baring his neck again…
“You really don’t believe that someone could love you this much?” Steve whispered, still committed to defending Tony even when his brain was mainly white noise.
Tony only asked his final question because he was curious.
, hm?”
He braced as he turned, already aware of the chance he’d missed – the outcomes he was left with.
And just left.
Steve almost giggled, he was so
Tony smile before he could open his eyes. His fingers were still curling into the fabric of Tony’s shirt, his breath still coming in ragged, noisy gulps, when his vision finally cleared. The first thing his saw was Tony’s mouth, dark red and slightly swollen and…amused.

It would’ve been frustrating, if Tony had the space to feel anything other than nervous.
He could revel in the feeling of being adored like that, by someone he
yes – I did know. And it
...He was just going to have to face it.
And, with that, Steve’s mind began to tally details with more speed, more awareness. He began to remember the moments leading up to his sudden incapacitation, the questions he should be asking himself, the connections between them…
A cool disappointment sank down through Steve’s chest and pooled in the pit of his stomach.
Rhodey had probably come here planning to gently tease Tony over how elusive he’d been for the last few weeks, hoping to needle some actual details out of him…
sweet, and a completely different texture to anything he’d ever drunk before. He bit down before he could stop himself, and a sudden burst of it filled his mouth. A low, feral moan escaped him, from deep in his chest, his fingers digging harder into the bag. He swallowed in sharp, almost painful gulps-
An impulse he mistook for ‘remembering what Captain America would do’… That was a mistake Steve had been making for years now. Crediting a brand image with all the better qualities in himself, all the choices it cost him so much to make, all the things he’d known since long before he took the serum.

And Steve felt like he’d been punched in the throat.
And then Janine was holding out a little paper cup, with a bright blue pill in the bottom of it.
And then Tony cocked an eyebrow, a playful look crossing his face for the first time all morning.
And Steve carried on kissing him as his hands came to the front of Tony’s shirt, unfastening the buttons with fast, fluid fingers. His movements were more confident as he swept his palms up over the bare skin of Tony’s back, and then over his shoulders, pushing his shirt back over his arms. Hands prickling with excitement, Tony unfastened Steve’s jeans, tugging them down over his hips as he pushed him backwards, encouraging Steve to step out of them and fall onto the bed.
Oh, God – he had no idea if Tony liked him.
Tony saw Steve mouth another Thank You at the little girl – and then at the group of children watching from behind her – before he turned to Rhodey.
‘The stuff that’s covering every other surface you mean? You’re just lucky it’s not all over the floor so I could get in here,’ Bruce chuckles as he picks his way through the clear parts of the floor to reach the teenager’s backpack. ‘So I have to ask: if you were experimenting with the webs why didn’t you think to add the anti-web fluid to one of your shooters in case this happened?’
‘Don’t make this any worse for me, Buck,’ he pleads with his friend. Bucky just raises his hands in a placating gesture and grabs a glass from a passing waiter.
‘We need to make a decision quickly,’ the vigilante pipes up. ‘We’ve got a convoy on the way here, sounds like one of the weapons transports. If we don’t hurry we’re going to have even more weapons and people to contend with.’
‘Of course, yours is slightly less caffeinated so as to not cause any adverse reactions with the serum in your body. Agent Natasha’s is a blend that is flown in from Budapest, it is one she and Agent Clint grew very fond of during a mission there.’
‘Steve?’ Tony’s not sure if Bucky’s tone is a deliberate copy of the kid’s but it does the job and Steve joins them with a good natured sigh.
Loki frowns and sighs, ‘Then I shall add another bowl of ice cream to Peter’s tally.’          ‘What? Why?’
‘And Tony is an expert in recognising that, Peter,’ Steve chuckles, ‘since he does it so much himself.’
‘We were lucky Strange was here when it happened,’ Natasha says as she finishes updating them on the training incident, ‘he was able to contain the power surge so it’s only the training room that needs refurbishing. The outer wall was blasted out, but we should be able to get someone in to do repairs by the end of the week. Wanda was unconscious when we got to them and Vision was a bit bashed up, but other than that we had a lucky escape.’
‘I don’t deserve it.’
‘Since like forever,’ the boy rolls his eyes at Loki and he tries not to laugh, taking a swig from his glass.
The doctor sighs. ‘Alright Mr Stark, you’ve got the go ahead. But don’t be out for longer than four hours
‘You remember the one time we played and Monty cleared
‘Why didn’t you just reprogram the synopsis to work collectively?’ Shuri asks.
‘I didn’t want to put this under the tree in case it got accidently damaged,’ he says in way of explanation. ‘Merry Christmas, Thor.’ He hands over the small, impeccably wrapped present.
‘From what Loki has said I do not think they will be much easier than their master,’ Strange counters.
I snap my fingers.
‘I’ll never understand how you put up with him,’ Bucky laughs, then goes to greet Thor.
‘I’ll organise transports to take us there,’ T’Challa turns to a guard. ‘Get the city under lockdown and ready the defences. Prepare carriers to transport the army. Wakanda Forever!’
Sam’s looking back at Peter though, and there’s something in his eyes that reminds him of Tony when he’s figuring something out. He beckons him forwards. ‘Go on, kid. Even if you don’t think it makes sense it’ll help.’
‘How did you get here so fast?’ she mumbles into his chest.
Tony barks out a laugh. ‘We’re on our way back now, FRI.’
‘Do you often hide in shadows and talk to yourself?’ a voice asks, clearly amused.
Wanda laughs as she lets go of him. ‘I didn’t get to say thank you for saving my life last time we met,’ she explains.
‘Bruce? Peter? Shuri? Time for food guys,’ Sam says as he walks through the lab door. ‘I know you guys can get carried away down here.’
Thank you to everyone who is still reading this story, and especially to the people who are finding it for the first time and persevering with getting through all of it! Extra big thank you to everyone who has left kudos and comments on this story, I do love hearing your thoughts on what is going on. The support from this story has been incredible.
‘Alright FRIDAY, let us know who won,’ Natasha says as they put away their weapons.
‘I’m always nice!’ he protests. He follows the blond and focusses on the point in his mind that Loki had been teaching him was the link between their minds. No matter how angry Bucky is over the whole situation, he has to admit the trickster has been trying his best to ensure he can use this now found ability and protect himself. Not that that means he’s forgiven him of course.
(See the end of the chapter for
to do that boring excuse for entertainment out of my own free will.’
‘Wait, what?’ Bucky demands. ‘You can’t be serious, Tony.’
The rest of his week goes fairly smoothly. It’s his birthday so he, May and Ned go to have Thai at his and May’s favourite restaurant then catch a film. Tony sends him a message saying happy birthday and that they’ll do something when he’s next up at the facility; Wanda sends him a message saying he’s getting less her ‘baby’ brother, to which he replies with something snarky.
‘Why were you grounded if you don’t mind me asking?’ Rhodes asks her.
,’ Cassie pouts, ‘I want to have a group of super friends just like you and go and help people and save the world and-’
‘I hope you will allow me to be a better brother to you now than I was before,’ Thor replies.
‘Oh and if someone tries to drag you into a house to meet their daughters don’t go,’ Clint continues with his advice as if no one else had spoken.
Tony sees Clint struggling to keep a straight face out of the corner of his eye and feels the corners of his mouth twitch.
‘To use the extra horse power to get some of this shit moved so I can help get them out. How do I even use this thing?’
‘What makes you say that?’
‘I don’t think I want to know about the last one,’ she says, changing lanes and heading out of the city. ‘Just answer me this, Pete: if he went rogue could you take him out?’
‘Yes, Mama, this is Wade Wilson,’ he drags the merc forwards. ‘Wade this is Mama Rhodes.’
‘I shall,’ Loki says.
Nebula pauses, then shakes her head. ‘No,’ she answers softly.
‘I understand, Mr Stark,’ then he surprises them all by throwing his arms around Tony and giving him a hug. ‘Thank you.’
‘Already on it, Peter,’ the AI replies.
‘Trouble at home Dumbledore?’ Tony asks.
Steve laughs, pressing a kiss to his forehead as they head towards their own room. ‘I know, honey, I’m just teasing you.’
Tony feels his heart ache a little and pulls her into a hug. ‘Well,’ he says after a couple of seconds, ‘sounds like we’ve got our work cut out for us.’ He pulls away and smiles at her. ‘We’ve got a lot of Christmases to make up for you, and don’t even get me started on the amount the two old men who decided napping in ice is a good idea managed to miss between them. At this rate we’ll still be celebrating by the time next Christmas comes around.’ Wanda laughs, and Sam and Rhodes snigger behind him.
A/N: I am so sorry I am so late updating, my weekend just decided to pass by without me! As these next few chapters are so short, and I'm so late, I'm going to finish uploading the story today as an apology!
‘I don’t need to go to medical,’ he protests.
. No arguments. Do I make myself clear?’
‘We’re together, Wanda,’ Bucky reassures her, ‘no matter how hard they try it won’t be easy to break us because we’re here together.’
‘Yeah?’
‘Anyone got any-’
‘Not who?’ Rhodes asks. The question is answered when a dark haired man steps through the circle of orange light, wearing what looks like blue clothes better suited to a fantasy novel and a red cape that almost has a life of its own.
‘Alright, but…Harry I am here if you want to talk. Or if you want to pretend you can beat me in Star Wars trivia quizzes again.’
‘Well we’ve got enough people that can fly,’ Peter says, ‘why don’t we have Wanda, Vision, me, Sam, Colonel Rhodes and Mr Stark all decorate the tree and Miss Natasha, Captain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes can all do the other outside decorations?’
So Steve explains the invitation to the party, and sneaking over there whilst the rest of the team were inside, and meeting Tony outside. ‘He said he was just Tony from R&D. Why?’
‘And don’t do this alone,’ Tony adds. ‘Or I’ll be calling you a hypocrite, Agent Romanov.’
your big announcement?’ Rhodes asks. ‘Jesus Tony I thought you were going to tell us you’d finally signed the paperwork to be his legal guardian or something.’
‘Thank you,’ he smiles, eyes still watery with unshed tears. He looks between the two of them. ‘Thank you so much.’
A/N: Hello everyone! The first parts of the Christmas story are now up and I hope you're enjoying them. The next two chapters will be up next week and are set on Christmas Eve. I'm aiming to post the last bits of the story on Christmas Eve itself.
‘Don’t sir me, kid, I know I’m old but I’m not in charge,’ he grins, ‘if you’re serious about wanting to join the army contact our facility first and ask to be referred to me, alright? If you want to fight come do it with a team that will watch your back, we always needs good people to help.’
Merry Christmas and God bless you all!
‘Good luck, Mr Stark,’ Peter says, ‘hi again Captain Rogers sir.’

Tony feels Steve tense next to him and knows the soldier isn’t happy. ‘Honestly Thor? It’s a lot to ask when we have to put aside the knowledge that this is the guy we first had to fight against as a team. However,’ he holds up a hand to cut off whatever the god is about to say, ‘having seen the way your people reacted to his, what I assume is his, true form? The knowledge that he was under mind control when he attacked us? I’m willing to give him a chance if Steve and Natasha are.’
‘Hey Pete, where are you now? Have you left the others?’
They go to refill their mugs in a companionable silence. ‘You know,’ the trickster says as they take their places back against a wall, ‘I did wonder if you wouldn’t have had someone by the time we came back after Yule.’
Vision pauses, realising he has to weigh his next words very carefully. ‘You may find yourself hearing it more if you decide to stay here a little longer. I have found, although they tend to hide it behind jokes, this team cares deeply about each other, and if they accept you then you will be able to experience that as well.’
‘We have the explosives, we should set them and get out. No one needs to be any the wiser,’ she argues.
Steve nods. ‘Went back to France, settled down and got married. Though there were quite a few complaints from neighbours about explosions from his farm land.’
‘And why the hell not?’ he demands. ‘The invite said the
As always here's a sneak peek at the next chapter:
‘I did?’
She looks to Peter, and he pleads silently with her to be nice. She walks forwards and extends a hand. ‘Nice of you to join us for Christmas.’ When he warily takes it she pulls him forwards and Peter hears her say quietly into his ear: ‘You hurt my baby spider and I’ll find a way to make you permanently dead.’
‘I’m fine,’ he protests, he’s not sure if he actually sounds a bit slurred or if it’s just the pounding in his head.
‘I shall do my best,’ Loki responds with a grin. ‘And Tony?’ he calls back the other’s attention as he nears the door. ‘Thank you.’
‘Exactly,’ Wade brushes a thumb over his cheek, and Peter feels goosebumps following the digit.
‘Shut it,’ Tony grumbles, and Sam feels a little bad for him at the guilty expression on his face.
,’ Clint’s fists are clenched at his side. ‘HYDRA?’
‘At this rate what?’ Tony asks gently.
‘I know,’ Peter sighs as everyone turns to look at him, ‘he’s normally worse. At least he tones it down around you lot.’
It takes a bit of time but eventually they manage to calm Thor down enough for the god to sit on one chair for more than five minutes; Valkyrie was happy to stay at the breakfast bar when she’d spied Tony’s minibar and had been given free access to, having left Loki in more capable hands than hers.
This is the first of the stories that I'll be posting that are based around fairytales, some of them (like this one) are VERY loosely based on them, and others will be much more in line with the original stories. I know, it's more Stony. I feel like I should do something different so let me know if there's any particular pairings or pairings with a fairytale that you'd like to see!
‘Don’t make me regret it.’
‘Hmm,’ Peter is sure Mama doesn’t fully believe them, then she catches sight of the man hiding behind him. ‘Is this the young man Tony was telling me about? This is your friend, Peter?’
‘You must spend a lot of time up there then,’ she says, eyeing him with interest.
‘Alright you lot, show’s over! Leave the poor kid alone, he puts up with enough from you lot as it is. And before anyone says anything, I’ve already threatened Wade if he hurts Pete, or tries anything over PG13 before he’s eighteen,’ Tony says.
‘Hey,’ her small hand stops him and turns him around, ‘one thing at a time, Tony. First things first we get rid of Ross; HYDRA will always be a thorn in our side it seems.’
mess,’ he responds, ‘Let me fix it Rhodey.’ Then he walks out before either of them can argue, patting the pocket where the old phone sits, reassuring himself it’s still there. Just like he’s done every day since it first arrived.
comfy.’
my fun?’
Peter groans as his algebra teacher catches him as he attempts to sneak out of class with everyone else. ‘Is anything wrong sir?’ he hopes feigning innocence will help.
Bucky laughs. ‘You know Stark calls it the same thing,’ Steve feels his chest clench uncomfortably at those words. ‘The
‘That’s right,’ Tony says, leaning his elbows on the table and resting his chin on his fingers. ‘Vision and Wanda are confident that with enough time the effects of Sergeant Barnes’ torture can be reversed. At least to the point where he can no longer be controlled. There’s obviously going to still be a hell of a lot of trauma he’s going to have to work through, I’m not sure you’d be able to find a shrink you could pay enough to sort that guy’s head out.’
to stand against the Fire Lady when she is angry and defending those she loves. Not even your Papa would dare to stand against her.’
‘Hey Parker! Your pimps decided to let you come back to school then?’ Flash’s obnoxious voice calls out as they enter their classroom.
‘Get hold of Clint and Scott and get them ready to go. See if you can get hold of Wade as well, he needs to come off the mission ASAP; maybe the other two can pick him up on the way,’ Steve says. ‘You heard from Fury yet?’
‘We are Venom.’
‘Thor you great oaf let go of me! I’m hurting you!’ he shouts as he hears the sound of singeing flesh. Thankfully his brother does as he is told and Loki pushes himself to the other side of the bed. ‘Give me a moment,’ he says in response to the crest-fallen expression on the blond’s face, taking a deep breath and concentrating on the well of magic he can feel restoring at his core. ‘There,’ he says, feeling his Asgardian form snap into place.
Natasha frowns. ‘You do realise you don’t have to keep up with all this Mr and Miss, right Peter?’
‘Hey stop it,’ she slaps him lightly on the shoulder. ‘No more of that talk, Clint. We’re all fine and will
‘Yeah pretty much my reaction when I found out. He’s a genuine war hero. Not that many people outside of the military would know his name. Rhodey would genuinely
‘This is really quite delicious.’
Peter shrugs. ‘That’s just what the media calls them. I’ve only ever met Daredevil, never met the others.’
‘Tony Stark you are many things,’ Pepper says firmly. ‘You are most definitely a terrible pain in my ass. You can be arrogant, you can be stubborn and you can be impossible to organise. But you are also one of the most dedicated, kind, honest, hard-working and decent human beings I know. You are also generous to a fault. How many other people do you know who would have done what you did for Sergeant Barnes? Not to mention the amount you pay me for being a secretary.’
‘What was that?’ Rhodes asks.
‘I have not been going on about it for a month, maybe for a week at most,’ Quill defends himself.
‘Strangely enough, Wong,’ the doctor retorts, ‘I’ve been too busy trying to rebuild the mess from Kaecilius; a mess, which I might need to remind you, that was already started before I joined Kamar-Taj. Oh yes and someone keeps stealing my money to buy themselves sandwiches because they never have their own. That does have a tendency to slow repairs.’
‘I wasn’t, I was doing a press conference for Stark Industries; I may not be CEO any more but I still own the company and design the majority of the stuff. The problem is every time I’m in a press conference for SI they always ask about the Avengers. Hence why Ross pulls me in to drag me over hot coals every time I have one.’
Thor’s face, so unsure since the loss of their friends, suddenly turns determined. ‘Indeed, brother, it shall. We shall not rest until they are safe.’
As soon as the suit has melted back into the emblem Peter finds himself crushed up against a solid body. ‘Wade I’m
‘Ah… hey Hawkeye. Long time no see,’ Wade looks to Tony and then back to Clint.
Peter shakes his head. ‘Nope.’
‘I’ll give you some training before,’ Natasha gives him a smirk and Peter seems mollified.
‘Nat?’
‘What the
‘Yeah I was thinking of getting some land either upstate or maybe a state or two away and, I don’t know, maybe build a few buildings and things that’s just for the team to use. Make sure FRIDAY had it locked down so only we can get there, maybe as Strange to put in a couple of magic things as well, and then only members of the team can go there when they need a break. Get some smaller cabins built, maybe a bigger place for us all to go to. Then we could use it for summer vacations, have our Christmases there…then maybe Clint and Laura could join us for the whole thing, but still have their own building. Get where I’m going with this?’
why you always redid my tie?’
‘Let him go!’ Tony lands not far from them, holding up his hands and lifting his face plate. He looks at Peter and he can see the fear in his mentor’s eyes.
He’s not letting her get away, not when there’s a chance she can take him to HYDRA and Bucky.
‘Bad form, Rhodey,’ Natasha shakes her head, ‘he’s
‘Now that sounds like a challenge if ever I heard one,’ Bucky grins. ‘I say let’s do it. Prize for who catches everyone first?’
Peter looks over his shoulder at the red clad mercenary approaching him across the rooftop. ‘Oh hey Deadpool.’
‘Someone will say something and get him going,’ Tony shrugs. ‘And he’s a great kid; he’ll do better than the both of us ever did,’ he can’t help the smile of pride that creeps onto his face.
‘From little old me?’ Is all the warning Peter gets before Wade launches himself into an attack, taking out the training sticks he uses in place of swords. He’s still able to easily dodge and twist around to aim a kick at the back of Wade’s knees; which the merc just manages to avoid before spinning to face him again.
‘You got me,’ he grins. ‘And you know I’m right.’
Seriously thank you so much to everyone who is reading this story, everyone who has left kudos, and especially everyone who is continuing, and starting, to leave comments. I cannot thank you enough!
‘He’s not very good with words,’ Natasha nods in understanding, ‘so this is his way of saying he’s sorry and how much he wants us here.’ She gives a short harsh laugh. ‘To think I once gave a report to Nick that said he wasn’t worth considering for the team because he didn’t play well with others. Now it seems he’s the one most determined to keep the team together.’
‘Yes,’ he replies, without any hesitation.
‘Can I at least finish my drink first?’
‘Is- he- I-’ Loki seems completely unsure how to take his enthusiasm.
‘Parker a word please.’
‘I’ve definitely fought some things that look worse,’ Tony quips from behind him. ‘Honestly? The fuss you were making I was expecting much worse.’
‘Uh, hi kid?’ Steve blinks over at Tony as the two run off. ‘Is he always like that?’
‘No we want you to do a rain dance,’ Tony rolls his eyes. ‘You may be affected by this in the future, so yes we want you to vote.’
‘How many people do you think we lost in New York? In Segovia? How many do you think Cap lost during the war? Hell he thought he’d failed to save his
‘Wait, you’re telling me that you only realised the blind lawyer was a vigilante because he nearly knocked you out in a bathroom?’ Loki asks as the door to Matt’s apartment closes behind them.
He hears Ned being pulled away and tries to move to help his friend, but his limbs don’t want to work. There’s a pair of hands gripping him roughly at the shoulders and starting to drag him along. His body is still sluggish but it’s getting easier to move his limbs.
Steve stands facing him, hands clenched into fists at his side and tries desperately to withhold the urge to smash his face in. He catches Sam’s eye and the other man shakes his head minutely. ‘
‘Wait she has a different blend to mine?’ Steve asks, doing as the AI asks.
‘-Thor you missed out the-’
‘I’m seventeen,’ Peter huffs.
‘That’s like Uncle Clint and Uncle Sam who work with Papa,’ Morgan whispers.
am the best candidate.’
‘And you’re learning way too much from him,’ she counters. ‘Alright everyone please follow me and Sam and we’ll show you to your rooms.’
Bucky sighs. ‘I wish you’d stay.’ Is the last thing Stephen hears before the ex-assassin walks past him and starts a conversation with Sam and Rhodes.
‘Ah ha!’ Thor spots exactly what they’re looking for just ahead. ‘This shall do nicely!’
‘I thought you could do with a Christmas present a little early,’ Tony says, fidgeting for what he thinks is the first time Peter’s ever seen.
Wade tightens his arm around his waist and pulls him with him out of the door onto the balcony. ‘You want to tell me what’s going on in your head Baby Boy?’
. Just…just promise whatever you do you won’t hurt him? He was the first member of the team when Tony introduced me to everyone who made an effort to get to know me and he’s been like a guardian angel ever since. I don’t want to see him hurt again, he doesn’t deserve that. So if you want to be with him don’t sit around, just go for it. But only do it if you aren’t going to mess him around.’
‘Aww that’s no fun,’ she pouts.
‘If you think that’s bad,’ Bruce sighs as Peter gets dragged to the back of the labs, ‘just be glad you weren’t here five minutes ago. I do apologise for Princess Shuri’s rudeness, everyone, I’ll make sure I send a message back to her brother,’ he raises his voice at the last sentence.
Loki laughs. ‘Oh no dear child. I am still working on forgiving him completely even now, something like that cannot just be forgiven in a moment’s decision, it takes time and work. But I was able to forgive him enough that, before he died, I could look on him as my father again.’ He smiles at the confused look on the girl’s face. ‘I am sure you will never be in the situation where you can fully understand my meaning, but perhaps one day you will come closer to. Now I suggest we change this topic of conversation to one more appropriate for Christmas Day. You were asking about magic: would you like to see some ice shapes?’
Hulk runs his fist over his mouth, in a move that Clint learned a long time ago he does when he doesn’t know what to say. ‘Hulk glad both safe.’
the voice sounds weak, but it sounds much sweeter than the flat tone it had been before.
‘Bucky,’ Tony finally turns to face him, and there are unshed tears in his eyes, but his voice is stronger now. ‘He asked me to take him to see my parents’ graves back when we thought he wasn’t going to be healed in time. He told Dad he was sorry for what he’d done, even though he knew I didn’t blame him for any of it.’
‘That would explain a few things,’ Wanda says.
have been able to do this himself before the serum,’ Bucky chimes in, ‘unless I was carrying him of course.’
‘So are you two…’ Harry gestures between Peter and MJ.
‘It was all of our faults,’ Rhodes agrees.
That makes him pause. But it does nothing to stop the pain in his chest. ‘There’s a reason I don’t let people get killed Deadpool,’ he says, tone still cold. ‘Because before Mr Stark found me I was by myself as well. I got someone close to me killed because of these abilities.’
He sighs, knowing this is going to end so badly, takes a longer run up than Steve (which is more like a jog compared to his normal speed), and uses his sticking ability to slow down his ‘run’ up the side of the wall so he only just reaches half-way; causing Steve to nearly lose his balance as he dives down to catch his out stretched hand.
‘Every time I call her I usually do something wrong,’ he whines, ‘it’s like speaking to the headmistress.’
Tony tries not to laugh as he sees Bucky and Steve trying to help Drax walk to the ice rink, only for the large alien to fall over as soon as his feet hit the ice and pull
‘That too,’ he nods in agreement. Then something on the TV catches his attention.
‘Right,’ Ned replies with an eye roll, ‘and this couldn’t be done over the phone because?’
‘Yes, Doctor Banner, it’s just taking me some time.’
He’d given up trying to keep the merc away during his patrols and instead agreed that he could join him twice a week if he promised to keep out of his way the rest of the time; he’d also promised only to step in when Peter was dealing with criminals, and not when helping out older and younger people. He wasn’t sure how they’d cope with Deadpool’s language. So far the older man had kept his word, and would only try and seek him out at the end of his patrol on the days when they weren’t supposed to be working together.
‘If he ssssucceedssss, half the universsssse will perisssssh. Including your new family. Let me bond with you again. Let me fight with you. Then when we have defeated him, let me go free and I will never burden you again.’
‘I don’t want it anywhere near me,’ Peter retorts, ‘now put the boxes down!’
‘You don’t exactly have the best track record when it comes to looking after your own health,’ Vision points out. After a pause he adds, ‘What? It’s true.’
‘Not like I’ve got anything more entertaining on,’ MJ shrugs, a small smirk on her face.
‘Eyes won’t open. You look,’ he mumbles, thrusting his phone at Steve.
‘No promises,’ Loki grins, ‘I seem to have an accomplice who enjoys tricks as much as I do.’
‘How can you be so sure?’ Natasha asks.
‘So I’ve been told. You ready or what? We’re losing daylight here.’
He wonders as they rejoin the others. Steve shoots him a questioning look but he just shakes his head. There’s no way he’s ready to talk about it just yet.
‘I don’t speak directly with the team, sir, I’ll have to take this through security.’
‘Speaking from experience?’ Strange smirks.
‘Yes boss?’
‘Holy shit!’ Sam shouts as he re-enters. ‘What the-’
‘My stories of past adventures are not boring, brother.’
Steve and Tony have a heart to heart, and the team enjoy the after party.
‘Still preferable to my brother.’
‘He turned down being an Avenger?’ she’s finding it a little difficult to take in all this information. ‘Why haven’t I seen him here?’
‘-and you only try to look innocent when you’re up to something,’ Bucky cuts across Steve’s response.
There’s the sound of a clock timing as FRIDAY announces the start of the new year and everyone starts a chorus of ‘Happy New Year!’ Peter turns to look at everyone and sees Wanda give Vision a quick kiss on the lips, the humanoid actually managing to look surprised; Tony and Steve are sharing a kiss to welcome in the new year. So Peter does the only thing he can think of.
shouldn’t be before you’re eighteen I’m telling Tony.’
looked bad,’ Wade laughs.
Strange, oddly, looks to Loki before nodding. ‘Alright. But tomorrow after you’ve slept.’
‘I do know someone who can help,’ she responds, ‘or rather I know a group. Come with me and meet my friends.’
‘You’ve never had a banana split?’ At the shake of her head he goes over to the bed, showing her the plate, her eyes going wide at the sight: the banana has been cut in half and three scoops of ice cream, all of different flavours, lie in between with strawberries and blueberries in between. Vision had told him the fruits were Wanda’s favourite. It’s all topped with chocolate flakes, chocolate sauce and whipped cream, and Peter had had to dodge both Bucky and Natasha’s investigating fingers to get it down here untouched.
A/N: Hi everyone, sorry if you were looking forward to Steve taking a dip in the mud! I was very tempted to do it but thought I'd have Peter be nice to him.
Tony shrugs, wishing even more that he’d allowed himself that drink. When he dares to look up, he sees a patient face and eyes asking him to explain. Sometimes it’s easy to forget that, before he became a sentient being, Vision was JARVIS. Vision knows him better than anyone, even Pepper; which meant he was the most patient with him.
‘Boss there’s an incoming video call for you, would you like me to put it through?’ FRIDAY says.
‘Oh bring it on!’ Wanda shouts and the pairs all split up to find cover in the grounds of the facility.
‘What is it, Pete?’ Tony asks him, patting the mattress next to him. Peter accepts the unspoken invitation and goes to sit next to him, looking down at his hands in his lap rather than up at the inventor.
Bucky thinks as consciousness begins to creep up on him. There’s a lot of people talking, though it sounds like they’re shouting, and he’s got a pounding headache.
Only two more chapters to upload for this story, and the Christmas story should also be going up at some point today.
‘I mean they don’t exist do they?’ Natasha asks, looking to Bruce and Tony.
‘All these years he’s been trying to steal it,’ Tony teases, ‘and now we just give it to him.’
Christmas and we don’t need a repeat of that,’ Steve finishes, Peter turning bright red as he does and mumbling something about having learned his lesson.
hot chocolate.’
‘Unless you want me to stick a load of people into Iron Man suits then no, there’s not that many. Considering there weren’t any known individuals with enhanced abilities until Captain America came out of a bottle, is it really that surprising?’
Peter shouts out in alarm as the web he’s holding gets flung by Hulk, sending him sailing through the air to land at their feet. ‘Ouch, that’s going to bruise.’
Wilson?’ Clint growls, picking another knife from the block on the side. Before he can even lift his arm to throw it, the archer’s flying side-ways to land in a heap by the windows. ‘What the hell just happened?’ he groans, then his eyes go wide as he sees his attacker.
‘How’s the other side doing?’ he raises an eyebrow.
‘Fuck off,’ comes a quiet reply, which Steve wouldn’t have heard if not for his enhanced hearing.
‘And there goes the cover story,’ he says, ‘thanks Steve.’
‘Master Loki?’ FRIDAY pipes up. ‘Master Thor is asking if you are awake and for you to join them, he says he is eager to begin the Yule celebrations.’
By the time he’s climbing in next to the soldier, Steve is already breathing deeply. Tony presses a kiss to Steve’s forehead and wraps his arms around him. ‘Goodnight, Steve.’
As always here's your sneak peek:
There’s a
‘Excuse me?’
‘I…thanks, Cap.’
‘Yeah well you can never be too sure with you,’ she replies, and Tony glares at Steve’s chuckle. His boyfriend gives him an innocent look, which is ruined by the smile on his face.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘How’s Peter doing?’ Pepper’s voice is full of concern, she doesn’t know the youngster as well as the team does, but she’s still fond of him. Tony has yet to find someone who
‘And to think you threw a diva tantrum when you heard he was coming,’ Tony laughs.
Tony laughs. ‘Fair point, kid. So I take it from your downcast expression and the topic of our conversation that Deadpool is spending Christmas alone and you wish he could be here?’
‘Cinderella is supposed to be a servant girl, and there’s supposed to be ugly stepsisters and an evil stepmother,’ she says.
‘Peter!’ he doesn’t think, he just moves in front of the teenager, the knife piercing through his armour and he feels it sink deep into his stomach.
‘We celebrated Yule last night,’ Steve explains, his chest vibrating far too noisily for Tony’s comfort, ‘and we were up drinking quite…well early by the time we finished.’
. But what I do know, Steve? We’ll figure it out together.’
He ignores her, turning to the faces staring at him out of the back of his truck, the headlights from Natasha’s illuminating the inside. ‘Any of you drive?’ he demands.
was that in here in the first place, to shoot his own webbing at his mouth.
‘Loki?’
‘Yes,’ Steve doesn’t hesitate in his breathless answer, feeling his heart speed up with anticipation.
‘Already on it, Cap.’
‘No, I’m taking us somewhere else.’
‘I like this woman,’ the human says.
‘You expect me to know ever intern that comes through our doors when I’m busy Avenging?’ Tony asks, wishing Wanda would hurry.
‘Oh no way, Tin Can. No fucking way is this thing coming off.’
Liz, but I knew I found girls attractive as well so… yeah.’
Everything was going according to plan. Too according to plan if she’s honest, but hey it’s about time they had some good luck. That’s what she’s repeating to herself like a mantra as she slips along the corridors unseen anyway.
‘They are
‘So awesome,’ MJ finishes for her. ‘Man, I wish I had regenerative powers like that, it would be so cool. Have you ever left parts of you around to make a fake murder scene to see how long you can string the cops along for?’
If anyone needed proof that Tony Stark has a heart, he could have given them both halves with those words. Knowing he’s probably going to be in big trouble with May for doing it, he knocks on the door briefly then steps into the room without waiting for an invitation. He sees the kid sitting on the bed with May’s arm around his shoulders.
And then Thanos catches Thor with his sword and sends him spiralling into the ground, knocking the god senseless. Steve tries to go to his friend’s help but Thanos’ sword turns on him, he brings up the shield to stop the attack and has a heart-stopping moment when the sword pierces the vibranium with ease, stopping just short of his face. He’s so shocked that it takes a few moments of Thanos pounding on the shield, leaving it split in half, before he’s able to scramble out of the way.
‘Did he just open his last present?’ Rhodes laughs.
‘Francis!’ Wade starts after him just as an explosion sounds and the ground beneath them shakes.
‘Pete…you sure about this?’ Steve asks. He’s not asking if they can manage it, Steve knows Peter could jump up to the bars right now if he chose to use his full abilities. He’s asking if he’s sure about potentially revealing some of his strength in catching Steve when he jumps. Peter also knows Steve would happily face the mud rather than risk his exposure if he decided that’s what he wanted.
‘What do you mean, Steve?’ Sam asks, though judging by the look of approval on his face he’s already guessed the answer.
‘Yeah but Captain Marvel’s the most powerful.’
No one is quick enough to stop Thanos putting the glowing yellow stone into the gauntlet as Vision’s lifeless body is thrown to the ground, the colour completely drained from his form. Thor, however, is quick enough to launch himself at Thanos with his axe, trying to take the Titan’s head off.
‘Yeah. My feet are sticking, Cap, I’m not going anywhere.’
Against his better judgement Tony has invited Strange and Wong to join them for making the decorations today. He says against his better judgement because after Wade encouraging Thor’s pleas for a hunt yesterday whilst everyone else was busy making food he’s not sure he wants the possibility of any more arguments starting, but Sam had made a good point that if they let the two wizards interact with the team more before the actual celebration there was going to be more time for them all to learn to interact civilly with each other.
Love always,
distracting him? You’re the one taking
‘The Guardians’ ship is coming in to land outside,’ FRIDAY’s voice interrupts them.
There’s a laugh from behind him. ‘Yeah I reacted much the same way when he first saw my face; I swear this guy has
to juice three lemons. You have super strength, just crush them in your hand!’
‘I’m certainly not going to be able to sleep again tonight,’ he admits, ‘and we’re less likely to be interrupted at,’ he glances at the clock, ‘half past two in the morning than we are during the day.’
‘As long as you promise we’re not going to get stunned,’ she laughs.
‘Any of what?’ the confusion is obvious in the man’s voice.
‘I was,’ Stark replies, ‘but obviously not careful enough.’
‘Wait!’ Deadpool grabs hold of his arm before he can shoot one. He hurriedly lets go and stands back, hands up. ‘Just hear me out before you run off.’
‘Are we going to be able to feed everyone?’ Sam asks, then looks at Rhodes. ‘Please tell me Mama Rhodes is coming again.’
don’t know that, Loki. I couldn’t tell them everything because I didn’t want to scare them. But then how can I tell them to do one thing and then not do it myself?’
‘Yes so you’ve told me like a
‘Alright, let’s try it again,’ she says when Wanda feels a little more relaxed again.
‘Please don’t do anything,’ he mumbles as Tony’s hold on him begins to relax. He’s still too embarrassed to look up at anyone in the room.
‘I meant
‘Pepper’s in with him now, I imagine he’s in a worse state than you are,’ she laughs, straightening his jacket and tucking a strand of hair behind his ear. ‘Now do you want to be out there waiting for him or be the last one out?’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Mutual friend,’ he replies, ‘and the answer to the second is private. Do you know where he is?’
He knows he’s in trouble when he gets home. It’s not just May sitting on the sofa waiting for him.
Scott sighs, downing the scotch in one, which raises an eyebrow from Steve, and sets the glass down. ‘So I was coming back from seeing Hank and these guys jump me and drag me down an alley. Now I’m thinking they just want money or something seeing as I’ve just come from the rich guy’s house, but they start demanding I call you. When I tell them I don’t have a way of getting hold of you they start asking with their fists. This carries on for I’m not sure how long, but I manage to get some of the fire ants involved and get them off me. Eventually this guy in a suit turns up and tells them to stop.’
hard not to comment at that statement, and shoves his backpack into the back seat.
Bucky says nothing, simply turns and walks out without a backwards glance.
Tony’s already turned away and is running towards the plane. ‘Steve! Stop!’
?!? What the fuck is wrong with you?’
‘That apparently you lost your eye to an alien pretending to be a cat.’
he can feel Loki’s glare through the link, and frowns at Wanda’s giggle.
‘That there’s more than one reason for me coming and watching you guys train,’ Tony responds, returning the quick kiss Steve presses to his mouth.
‘We’re friends aren’t we? That’s what you do for your friends.’ Deadpool is silent for a couple of minutes, and it starts to worry him. ‘Deadpool?’
Peter groans and the two of them rush out of the doors. Sure enough there is Tony Stark, leaning against a car that he’s parked right outside the gates. Not even a blind man could have missed him. Students are already starting to gather a little away from him, obviously unsure if they should approach or not.
‘I thought we agreed no killing?’ he says as the man goes limp in the merc’s arms.
Clint grins at her. ‘You know I’m starting to think retirement doesn’t suit me. Think if I get the team to help do the porch Laura will let me come back?’
‘Yes that’s what I’m afraid of,’ Thor sighs, glancing over at Peter who at least looks sheepish. ‘Take care, brother.’
All too soon for the group on the dancefloor, Pepper calls an end to the music.
‘Please god
‘Yes boss.’
‘You don’t think…do we think HYDRA has its own magic user?’ Peter voices the question, voice quiet.
‘I’m not sulking!’ the dark haired man responds.
‘Tony, leave him alone,’ Steve sighs. ‘I’m sure if it was anything serious he’d let us know.’
‘I know, I think if you’d left me to restart a relationship with someone else I could have handled it better, but knowing it wasn’t that just made it harder.’
Peter’s looking down at a framed picture of himself with his Uncle Ben, it was taken a couple of years ago, not long before he’d died. He can’t help the tears that are streaming down his cheeks.
‘Flash didn’t believe Peter had the internship at Stark Industries,’ MJ adds, ‘until Tony Stark picked him up from school one time.’
‘Wade get off me!’
Bucky growls, feeling his frustration rising at the god’s aggressive tone, and stands up. ‘Look all I want to know is if what HYDRA did to me is going to make me more susceptible to mind control when Thanos gets here, because if it is I need to know so I can find a way to stop that from happening. Because I’ll be
‘Tony get down!’ Clint slamming into his side and sending them both sprawling to the ground from his chair cuts off his retort, the next thing he hears is a crack from the table. He looks up over Clint’s shoulder to see a bullet hole in the table.
It was the line Tony always used on him that made his resolve crumble and had him dancing to any tune the inventor wanted to play. Every protest and argument he has against this dies on his lips as Tony pulls him forwards into another kiss, and those talented fingers find their way under the fabric of his shirt. His name falls from Steve’s lips like a prayer and a plea at the same time, and he lets Tony pull his shirt over his head.
‘When I started listening to you,’ she responds, then releases him as the rest of the team join him and they head towards the courtroom.
‘Since I know that if you come along you’re just going to be kicking up a fuss about that damned arm of Barnes’ and I am
‘Where?’ the archer raises an eyebrow at him.
Deadpool shrugs. ‘Got to pay the bills, sweet pea. Ever since I got my Freddy Kreuger look there’s not much else I can do until Halloween comes around.’
‘What?’ Bucky starts to panic. The whole point of this was to check no one would be able to take control of his mind again, not form a mental connection with someone that meant-
‘What-’ the kid squeaks.
me and by me. What exactly are you trying to say?’
‘Thanks Sam,’ Quill smiles at him, and Sam decides to ignore the sheen of tears in his eyes, ‘really, man, thanks.’
'Sharon?' Steve's surprised at the woman's visit; they haven't been in contact since the Accords. The former SHIELD agent is dressed in jeans and a shirt and, despite best intentions, Steve finds himself searching her features for any reminder of Peggy.
‘What else do you do to help your friend apart from make banana splits?’
‘Do you have to be so crude?’ he interrupts him with a frown.
Tony keeps an eye on Strange throughout the rest of the final food preparations for the feast in two days’ time, and is mildly surprised to notice most of the team going over to check on him and chat at some point during the evening. When Strange stands to leave Tony walks with him to where the portal to the Sanctum has been permanently established in the facility.
The leader shrugs. ‘Well if he really doesn’t mean anything, then he’s not of any use to me,’ he holds the gun a little straighter and turns to Peter. ‘Any last words, kid?’
‘It’s a travesty,’ Peter snorts, then his brain kicks in. ‘What are you doing here?’ He looks to Tony. ‘You really invited him here? Just because I mentioned it?’
‘Actually I’m alright for now. Maybe you should join me.’
‘Deep down they know it too they just don’t want to say it out loud in case it sounds defeatist. We’ll always fight.’
‘I’m an idiot,’ he grunts to himself. As Bucky heads towards him he raises his hand, praying that this is going to work, and lets a web fly, pulling himself up and out of reach of the dark-haired soldier.
‘You want me to help you bring this up with the Council?’ she asks, obviously taken aback.
‘But you already gave me a present, Steve,’ Tony sits up from his place on the bed, ‘I thought we agreed not to go overboard?’
They manage to get the webs to act as ropes and Thor, Steve, Bucky and Sam all grab hold of separate ends and start pulling on the trunk, Wade and Peter are at the back pushing the base of the tree. Luckily they haven’t chosen an evergreen so there aren’t any leaves to deal with.
‘Because we found something you might want to check the cameras on,’ he replies, ‘down on the lower levels. They’ve got people down here.’
‘So let me get this straight,’ Bucky says as they walk down the corridors of Peter’s school towards the auditorium. ‘Peter did a presentation for a history project and his teacher was so impressed it was chosen to be given at this big school event, and we all got invited to come along?’ His tone implies he knows someone is keeping something from him.
Hope you're enjoying it.
‘What kind of a question is that?’ Peter demands. ‘MJ’s my friend and I don’t like her like that. No offence MJ.’
‘Bucky? Yeah he’s down in room C3. Here I’ll show you,’ she says, ‘it’s time I go and take his obs anyway.’
want him to do that.’
‘Shouldn’t you be with the survivors?’ he sighs as he spies the form sitting in the corner.
‘I said the same thing, but he’s stubborn,’ she agrees, ‘I think he still wants to prove himself to be part of the team, despite what we tell him.’
‘Tony they’re coming after you,’ Scott says. ‘I don’t know why they thought coming to me would help their case, but when I said I couldn’t get hold of you they… well they didn’t like the way I said it I guess.’
‘There is aspirin back at the Embassy, right?’ he asks Steve.
Thor briefly explains the attack, but pauses before the end. ‘Brother…’
‘You two need to
‘Better hurry,’ MJ nods towards the disappearing group, ‘or you’re going to get left behind and have to sleep in the shed.’
‘Valkyrie are you
Peter can’t help the shudder that passes through him at the Mad Titan’s name. It was nothing short of a miracle that they’d managed to defeat him with their team intact, but it had been a close run thing, and Peter knows without Shuri, Loki and Tony working together they never would have been able to bring Vision back after Thanos had ripped the stone from his head.
‘It was all of our faults, Steve,’ Bucky says. ‘And it was kind of all over me so yeah I feel I own a big chunk of the responsibility.’
‘Peter!’ he hears Natasha’s voice from nearby. His momentum carries him past the monster and he hits the ground hard, rolling several times until he comes to a rest on his back. He may have cracked a rib, but then that could just be bad bruising.
‘Cassie!’
He just points above Bucky’s head then steps closer. Where he’s darted in quickly with the others he instead give Bucky time to realise what is happening. ‘I saved the best until last,’ he says quietly against the soldier’s lips before pressing against them, one hand tangling in Bucky’s dark hair and the other going to his hip to pull him closer.
‘He’s working with HYDRA Tony,’ Steve reminds him. ‘It’s them we’re tracking not him.’
‘Go,’ Natasha tells her, ‘I can hold anyone off while you get Wanda back here. You called for help?’
Peter snaps back to the present. ‘Sorry, MJ, what did you say?’
‘Groot? No using your vines to grab the flag if it’s more than twice your normal reach length away.’
‘Yeah well considering I end up getting blamed for anything that ends up on the ceiling,’ Peter frowns at Bucky, ‘we put a stop to it so I wouldn’t have to clean it up.’
‘Vision! Door!’ Tony yells at him before turning back to Peter. ‘Come on, kid. We’re waiting.’
Before he can figure out what to say, and Tony will never admit to not quite being able to work
‘Yeah I’m glad we did it too,’ he says, laughing as Thor raises his hands in celebration as the bonfire takes light. ‘It seems to have done everyone good to have something positive to focus on that doesn’t include saving the world.’
‘Oh come on, you know I can be worse than this. This is me being friendly.’ Peter has to bite his tongue
‘Since the experiment that gave her her powers,’ Vision explains from where he is sitting on one of the sofas, ‘whenever her time of the month comes around it throws her hormones into chaos and the first two days are normally very difficult for her. Her powers can also be in flux, which means objects can get thrown around. Even I know to stay away when she is feeling like this.’
‘Anything, Buck.’
‘I’m… I’m Steve,’ he replies, hesitating from automatically giving his rank and full name, ‘I’m with Captain Rumlow’s squad.’
as Peter Parker, and I don’t have to look after him, I’ve just got to support him the same way he does me.
‘So you got badass,’ Deadpool says, though his voice is quieter than his usual teasing tone. When Peter doesn’t say anything he adds: ‘Why did you do that?’
Strange’s expression melts into something more reassuring. ‘Not at all. It shall be completely painless. In fact it may prove rather interesting for you.’
‘What are you going to call it?’ Peter asks. ‘Is it a boy or a girl?’
Tony’s heart warms at the gesture. ‘We’ll see what updates there are when we get back, but I’ll take you up on it at some point I promise.’
‘Don’t worry, unlike your spider I don’t bite,’ she says with a grin.
‘They’ve put the conditioning in place.’
‘And I’m used to cleaning up the messes left by idiots,’ she adds as she joins the two of them, slinging an arm over Wade’s shoulders. ‘I promise to bring him back in one piece.’
‘Please, just leave. I swear you have become a mother hen since meeting the Avengers. Although from what Loki has told me you’ve always been this bad.’
decorations?’
‘Hey Mr Stark I didn’t realise you were up already, do you want-’
And here you go:
‘Natasha said they wanted to create soldiers to sell to the highest bidders,’ his voice is small.
‘Well boss has me make sure Miss Wanda has a cup of hot cocoa ready for about an hour after dinner because she likes to sit and relax with it; there’s also a special blend of herbal tea from Sokovia he has me fly in for her because it helps her sleep and I have it ready for her when she goes to bed. He also asked me to make one for Sargent Bucky as he’s finding it helpful too. I have to keep the temperature slightly warmer in Colonel Rhodes’ room as it’s more helpful with the odd cramps he gets from his injuries; and your room has to be a couple more degrees warmer than his. Would you like me to tell you anything else?’
‘But Mr Stark, what if they-’ A loud bang through the speakers cuts Peter off.
Tony hits him lightly on the chest, earning himself a chuckle. ‘Rude.’
‘Now remember,’ Rhodes says in his full Colonel voice, ‘no one is buying or winning any trees without permission from me and Sam. Understood?’
‘Language!’ Peter and Steve shout at the same time.
‘Hey everyone,’ he says, voice a little shaky, ‘uh, I’m not very good at talking in front of people so I’m sorry if I stumble a bit. So we were given a project in history to make a presentation on someone who has made a difference in history.’
‘We heading back to the facility?’ Clint asks him.
‘Fine by me,’ Wade nods, ‘I’ll be happy knowing Widow’s got our back in this.’
‘I’m so glad you made it to see Anthony before I called. I was hoping he’d have a bit of warning. You’ve done exactly what I needed you to do’. Scott growls, and Tony puts a comforting hand on his arm. ‘Now who else is still sticking around you? I’m surprised you haven’t managed to drive them away yet. That’s your usual trick isn’t it?’
‘You weren’t kidding were you?’
‘What are you doing?’ he asks out loud, starting to move away from the god.
‘But-’
guys, you can’t tell. If they find out who I am it puts you in danger, just like with Mysterio.
‘I got banned from helping.’
Tony at least has the decency to look sheepish. ‘Yeah, he and Rhodes may have been there when I listened to one of your reports. Sorry, kid.’
I'm so sorry I still haven't had chance to reply to everyone's comments yet, I'm afraid this week ran away from me. I promise I will get them all responded to this week.
‘Seriously?’ Wade says. ‘You just said you kept a list of anyone who is a threat to this world and you don’t fucking know who Thanos is?’
‘Right… you do realise I’ve never used one of these things before, right?’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Look Rocket I don’t think it’s fair to just gate crash on these guys’ Christmas that’s all I’m trying to say. Maybe instead of insisting we take part, you should
As always here's your sneak peek:
‘Try doing hand to hand training with her,’ Bucky genuinely shudders and Rhodes laughs as the two of them take their places either side of Natasha.
‘Wow, Tony you really have adopted that kid haven’t you? What’s with the whole “no dinner before you finish your homework” bit?’ he hears as he walks down the hallway.
‘Steve? Is this- are we-?’
. I just…I want to prove that his faith in me is justified, Baby Girl, and I want to show him how much it means but I’m just not sure how to do it.’
‘He says he’s too busy in a meeting with his council.’
Hope has some advice for Natasha, the team regroup with T'Challa in Vienna, and Bucky and Loki talk after their fight.
‘Sorry Captain, did you ask me something?’
As tears spill down his cheeks he’s pulled against the super soldier’s solid chest and he lets himself cry, gripping the front of the blond’s shirt with his one good hand.
‘Yeah, Laura and the kids aren’t coming though as Laura has family round. Clint was all but begging for an invitation to come,’ she laughs, ‘apparently he told Laura he had to come to do some team building or something.’
‘Love you, Tony,’ comes the mumbled reply.
‘Not usually,’ Loki laughs, ‘but you are doing well for your first time. Just don’t change careers to a chef any time soon.’
‘Really? Bestie group?’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘You’ll be fine, Steve. Don’t forget dances today are nothing like what we used to do. Just move side to side and don’t step on her toes.’
‘Nice try,’ Bruce pats his arm sympathetically. Talk turns back to the rest of the plans the Asgardians have, most of which are mainly preparations for the feast on the final day; Peter had arrived back from school earlier and found the three of them still discussing in the common area and had tried to help them work out which of the traditions would be possible here on Earth and which ones would be impossible. It appears most of the traditions were all around preparing food and decorations.
‘Using your magic can hurt you?’ Wanda asks from where she’s cutting out biscuit shapes from dough with Vision.
‘That,’ Stark says, looking directly into his eyes, ‘is
stupid. Peter had warned her about that tone. He’d also warned her there was no talking him out of whatever plan he had, you just had to roll with it and hope for the best.
Peter smiles. ‘That was a tradition Wanda’s family always had: each year a different person gets to put the topper on the tree and signal the end of decorating and the start of the rest of the celebrations.’
‘I can keep up with Hawkeye.’
‘Shit, fuck,
‘It’s coloured powder,’ he explains, ‘whenever I take her new tech to test out I usually put some testing powder in there. One time we were testing something out and I forgot I’d made a batch of blue powder and we got covered in the stuff; seems like she’s giving me a few more colours to work with for next time.’
Nebula walks forwards, a green skinned woman next to her who Tony supposes is the infamous Gamora.
‘Ladies and gentlemen,’ Fury says down the comms, ‘meet my good friend, Carol Danvers.’
of my former reputation I have to maintain.’
Bucky laughs. ‘Well Iron Man has this thing about looking for secret entrances ever since he found one back when the team were working against HYDRA just after the first Battle for New York. If he’s on the comms when any other team is out, he’ll get people to check.’
‘Hey,’ he replies, giving her a small wave and trying for a smile.
Which, although they can be fun, are not as enjoyable as some of the stories he hears from the rest of the team. So he has yet to fully appreciate the apparent wonders the training room can possess.
‘Long story, Brucie. We’ll fill you in over dinner. But in summary,’ he sighs and unbuttons his shirt to show the arc reactor in his chest, ‘some bastard put this back.’
‘He basically adopted him,’ MJ cuts in, ‘Tony Stark is one of Peter’s legal guardians.’
‘That’s what I thought when we did the Accords,’ Tony sighs, ‘and that took over a year to sort out.’
Please do let me know what you think of this chapter and where the story is going. Be interesting to have your input, as I've said before this whole instalment came out of one person's comment on wanting to see Bucky and Peter fight each other.
‘Brother,’ Thor places a hand on Loki’s shoulder, ‘I am sorry.’
‘I beg your pardon?’ even he’s struggling to keep up with this abrupt change in conversation.
Wanda turns to concentrate on stabilising Vision’s wound, as Tony looks back at the fight to see Steve and Wong both get pushed backwards and the alien come running towards him. ‘Oh joy,’ he says. ‘Buzz off gobo,’ he says, sending some blasts flying at the alien which makes him veer off course.
He shakes his head. ‘Can we do a little more with Venom’s memories first please? I think we’re close to something and I don’t want to get to a point where I can’t face going in.’
Steve leans back in his armchair, smiling as he listen to Rhodes, Sam and Bucky exchanging war stories. He enjoys listening rather than contributing his own; most of his are well documented and it’s nice to hear stories from a more ‘normal’ perspective rather than incredibly dangerous missions. Plus he gets to see his childhood best friend relax more around the team. During the day he’s always more aware of how he acts and what he says, especially in front of the daytime staff at the facility. He’s not even sure Bucky’s left the compound since he arrived in America.
‘Ned’s with me!’ he calls after them as Sam disappears with his friend. He crawls back up the wall and into the corridor.
‘Sure why not? We’ve enough toppers to put on that most people will have a go. Just take it up the top and try not to knock Tony on the way up,’ she answers.
‘So you thought you’d just walk back in and expect to pick up from when you ran off?’

Hi everyone. I'm updating two chapters a week for the next few weeks as this story is already posted on fanfiction.net and I'm a couple of chapters ahead on there. I'll have caught up soon though, so don't worry.
‘I love you too, soldier. Now let’s go kick some Titan ass.’
‘Kid call me Miss Romanoff and I will kick your arse from here to Queens and back again as many times as it takes for you to remember not to call me that,’ Natasha says, a half smile on her face.
Rest in Power our King.
For Steve the training room has always been a safe space. It was the one thing that hadn’t changed all that much since before the ice, it still made sense and it was the one place he could go to sort through everything in his head.
‘There is nothing in the shot that Hammer would be able to tell who Peter was apart from his voice,’ Tony’s furious. ‘So how the hell did he know that was Peter walking through the door?’ He looks up at Natasha. ‘Nat I want to speak to Hammer.’
‘Oh we won’t have to imagine,’ Wade laughs, ‘I can do a good enough impression.’
The place is big and noisy, and Peter resists the urge to put his hands over his ears to try and block out some of the noise, and it
‘Race you!’ he counters and dives out from behind the tree they’ve taken shelter behind, managing to catch Sam on the side of the head.
Tony’s watching her carefully, she can see him out of the corner of her eye, but she doesn’t turn to look at him. ‘And what did you tell him?’
Sam comes to a stop near him. ‘Man you really don’t stop with the inventions do you?’
Silence reigns after his statement. ‘I was
‘I’d love to see you try and explain it to Ross,’ Natasha laughs as she lands the jet and grabs her bites.
‘Steve? We got to move, come on,’ Bucky says from the doorway. When Steve only kneels down next to the inventor his friend adds. ‘
A/N: Hey everyone! So we're now officially on the road to Infinity War! Let me know what you think of Bruce and Thor's return in the comments, I do love to hear from you about where this is going and how you feel about it. Please do also leave comments on where you think changes need to be made, I find them really useful so please don't be worried about leaving them.
‘More stubborn than, Tony, and I didn’t think that was possible,’ Natasha mutters.
Wade smiles and kisses him again. ‘I know, but I still want to sweep you off your feet. Just a couple more months, Baby Boy, then I’ll make sure you can’t walk straight so everyone will know just by looking at you what you’ve been up to.’
Tony laughs. ‘No I think that’s all him, he definitely out talks me.’
‘You did well for yourself, though. Beautiful wife, successful company, and a great kid. Mind you, I always thought you were as much a man out of time as me and Steve are now; just you should have been here in the future and us in the past. I dread to think what you could have accomplished with the advances today. Maybe finally got that flying car to work,’ Bucky gives a small chuckle.
‘I don’t think he’s big into comedy,’ Tony answers, helping him stand and bringing him back over to the sofas. ‘So how about we sit like grown ups and work out how we’re going to deal with this?’
‘Something
‘That was successful wasn’t it?’ the doctor asks, not looking up from the folder.
‘Wanda? What’s wrong sweetheart?’ Steve asks.
everywhere
‘No word from Peter?’ Wanda’s voice comes from off screen before her worried face joins Steve’s.
‘Tony,’ Bucky pauses, then continues, ‘are you sure you want to be here for this?’
‘Tony I…’ she gives a small laugh, ‘I’ll ask Pete when he’s back from school and get back to you.’
‘Loki?’ the man’s voice is weak, but he manages to open his eyes and look at the trickster. ‘Oh good, I thought it was someone come to finish me off.’
‘You’re on,’ Peter laughs, scrambling to his feet and grabbing Sam’s abandoned web; Steve picks up his own again and Thor picks up his own and Bucky’s discarded one.
‘How does that prove your-’
‘Someone you know, Wade,’ Francis crows again as the figure looks up at me.
‘Thanks, Nakia,’ Clint smiles at her, wrapping a steadying arm around Natasha’s waist. ‘Now how about we all head over there? Pete and Wade should be joining us soon as well.’
‘T’Challa,’ Steve smiles at the newcomer. ‘General Okoye. You got here faster than we thought.’
, May,’ he counters.
‘I know,’ he replies, nodding and smiling up at the blond.
‘You can Doctor Banner,’ Peter cuts across him. ‘You just don’t want to. We don’t have time for what any of us want right now. Otherwise Venom would still be in his cell.’
‘Uh oh, I know that look,’ May says. ‘Whatever you’re thinking stop it right now.’
‘Why? What did you do? Snap another phone in half? Because to be fair sometimes I wish I could do the same. I’ll see if I can work out a way to reinforce one better for you,’ he says, heading towards the counter and keeping his back to him.
‘I could start up my support group again,’ Sam suggests. ‘Working with veterans that are trying to readjust to civilian life. Then Rhodey, Steve and Bucky could all come along occasionally as well seeing at they have experience with it.’
There’s a convoy of three vehicles just pulled in. One is a longer truck, the other two are SUVs. A motorbike pulls in behind them and the rider turns the engine off, pulling the helmet off and turning to the men climbing out of the SUVs.
‘People like me you mean?’ Wade pipes up, from where he’s been disturbingly quiet flanked by Peter and Wanda.
‘Doctors are never happy with my progress,’ he grumbles.
‘You know why he did though right?’
that matters more. You’re probably the only one on this team who can really
‘Is there anyone in the universe who
‘From information I have access to it appears she has not been making enough money to cover repairs. The ship is falling apart and can’t run efficiently enough to make enough.’
Peter grins and holds out his hands for a book, earning himself another chuckle from the sorcerer.
Despite all of that, though, the whole group were happy and chatting together as they finished up their lunch of sandwiches, which Vision had grabbed Rhodes to help him make.
‘Seriously, kid? You expect me to buy that crap? Spider-Man doesn’t need a bus to get to school. Don’t lie to me, Peter.’
‘Excuse me?’
is the infamous Wanda Maximoff,’ the woman says, tone cheerful. She has long black, wavy hair with a round face and a friendly smile; dark eyes that send a shiver down Wanda’s spine as they assess her. The woman is wearing a long dark dress with a high collar and walks in a circle around her. ‘I hear you’ve worked out my runes make it impossible for you to cast your spells. You see, Wanda dear, in a given space only a witch who cast the runes can use her magic.’ Wanda sees dark blue light dance across the woman’s fingers. ‘I was quite surprised you didn’t know the fundamentals. Though I will admit to being impressed that you worked it out, toots. I thought you were going to give yourself a migraine keeping up with that magic for a while.’
‘No apologies,’ the sorcerer cuts him off. Before he can say anything else there’s a knock on the door and Tony comes in.
It’s coming up to dinner time, but he’s not ready to leave his workshop yet. He’s definitely not ready to face Steve.
‘Why did you think Buck? Wait,’ Steve looks almost worried, ‘Tony you two didn’t…before I got back?’
A/N: Hi everyone! I hope you're enjoying the story so far, do let me know if you have any requests for the rest of the story. The first part is more the team introducing the Guardians to the different traditions, and then we'll have more of the relationship side of things from the Yule feast onwards.
‘Sure thing boss,’ the AI responds.
‘And you didn’t think anyone could be worse than Tony in the medical wing,’ Rhodey rolls his eyes.
‘-and so I just worked on it when you guys were busy.’
Peter's worst fear about the trip is realised when someone figures out his superhero identity.
‘You’ll be alright, kid,’ he reassures him, finding it more and more difficult to focus on individuals. ‘This is a good team, they’ll have your back.’
‘Oh and I suppose you’re ecstatic over this situation,’ Bucky drawls, ‘come on, Stevie, don’t even
know,’ Rhodes says gently, ‘but Peter still remembers you taking away the suit. And considering your reaction to the detention-’
‘Monica’s mother was an old friend of mine and Carol’s,’ Fury explains, ‘she unfortunately got grounded from her work in space.’
‘Yeah, yeah,’ Peter rolls his eyes, then lets the merc’s words sink in. ‘Why do you want me, Wade?’
Natasha pauses and thinks, letting his unspoken challenge force her to confront her feelings fully. Eventually she swallows past the lump in her throat and nods. ‘I think so.’
‘Clint’s scaring him with advice on how to survive Europe,’ Natasha explains.
‘Tell me, Captain Rumlow,’ Tony continues in a fairly light tone, ‘where were you on the 3
As a couple of assistants get the drinks sorted, Tony takes the seat at the head of the table and waits for the squad to get settled. Steve clenches his fist as he sees Rumlow take the chair on Tony’s left and points Andrew to take the one on Tony’s right, he and Bucky settle with the chairs near the other end of the table, Sam joining them. As the rest of the team get their drinks Steve takes the opportunity to study Tony, noticing the apparent easy-going attitude on his face, but the slight tension in his eyes and the way his fingers are tapping out a rhythm on the table are confirming Steve’s suspicions that there’s something more to this than Rumlow supposes.
‘Focus,’ Steve says, ‘tell me when you have a name.’
‘Thank you,’ Thor says, feeling true hope for the first time since arriving on this planet. ‘My name is Thor, what is yours fair maiden?’
‘Aright, first things first: let’s tell everyone else what happened,’ Steve nods.
Steve gives him a small smile and nods. ‘Yeah, thanks Bucky.’
‘Hey, uh, do you two mind coming upstairs for a bit? There’s something we, uh I need to fill you in on.’
into it,’ Sam grumbles, ‘my pack malfunctioned and I crashed into it. Hey, you alright Tony? You look beat.’
‘Deadpool and Spider-Man in the same place? Well isn’t this just my lucky day? I wonder what price you two would fetch?’ the man tosses a knife to the man Peter had webbed to the table. ‘Cut yourself free and get the others cut out.’
Peter visits Doctor Strange for another check on Venom's lingering effects.
Clint sighs but doesn’t argue. He also doesn’t fall asleep, but Tony doesn’t comment. Not like any of the rest of the team are either, even though no one is talking much.
‘Wanda may I ask you a question?’
when she gets angry. And she isn’t scared of Nat. I mean anyone who isn’t scared of Nat is terrifying in their own right.’
‘That’s putting it mildly,’ Steve laughs as the three of them walk over to where Tony’s standing.
‘I’m not complaining,’ Wade points out, arms full. ‘What did Loki have a diva tantrum over this time?’
work?’
‘Yes, and we’d better head towards the Sanctum.’
He looks behind him to see the finish line isn’t too far away and nods, bringing his other hand up to grab hold of the soldier’s sleeve to give himself a bit of extra grip. Steve swings him back and forth a few times to build up momentum before releasing his hand and he goes sailing through the air to land at the finish line, rolling a couple of times to make it look like he failed the landing. He’s never been happier to be on solid ground.
‘I’d better get moving with some of the Accords business,’ Nick says, ‘and apparently I have a law firm to visit.’
‘Just go easy on him, Pete,’ Tony says, clapping a hand on the boy’s shoulder. ‘One question at a time and give him chance to answer. Don’t worry Scott, he’s a good kid. One of the best.’
‘One such as you?’ the dark skinned man repeats back with a raised eyebrow.
‘Guys I am more than capable of handling my own fights,’ Steve sighs, and then proves his point by letting his shield fly, taking out numerous opponents as he continues to take out more in hand-to-hand.
‘Nope, but I’m pretty sure I’ve learned enough about drawing attention to yourself from him that I can keep them busy.’
‘Hey guys anyone seen Pete?’ Bucky’s voice comes over the ear piece.
He hears a sniffle at the other end of the phone, then Peter’s slightly slurry voice comes over. ‘I don’t know what to do.’
‘Careful Steve,’ Pepper grins at him, ‘the mood he’s in he’ll convince you to go on a date if you aren’t careful.’
‘Why you?’ Tony mumbles, his brain catching up with the excited ramblings of the young boy.
‘Always knew what was going on? What’s Widow done this time?’ Bucky grins as he walks into the common area, tying his hair back.
‘I understand,’ MJ sounds disappointed but doesn’t press the issue.
‘I know someone you could use,’ Peter pipes up.
bad,’ Bruce huffs, ‘but it might take me a couple of laps to find my balance again. I haven’t really been on ice since Hulk, I was always too worried I’d, you know, break it.’
Steve raises an eyebrow. ‘I seriously hope you up your stroll game when you try and charm your way into someone’s pants.’
Peter laughs wondering how he seems to end up in the same situation every year. ‘Yeah that’s me.’
‘Widow. Always a pleasure to see your beautiful face.’
‘I’m wondering why you would have this kind of technology. I doubt it’s something you would have made just for me, this kind of thing would have taken years of research to put together,’ Bucky muses aloud.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘All I know is vodka sucks,’ Peter grumbles. ‘Next time get your country to invent something that tastes half decent.’
‘FRIDAY you got anything different?’
‘It might explain why your device malfunctioned and you swapped with your counterpart,’ Tony adds. ‘But if they hadn’t realised it had worked until that confrontation, I’d say they weren’t close to the technology and your counterpart had potentially stolen it from them.’
‘Nah,’ Tony winks at him, ‘you’re stuck with me now, Cinderella.’
‘But I’m the most annoying person in the world!’
‘This leadership team,’ Clint asks, ‘just who are you suggesting for it?’
‘He hasn’t started speaking yet so all in all not too bad,’ Tony responds, arms crossed over his arms. ‘Alright, Peter, you have two minutes. I suggest you talk fast.’
He shakes his head to get rid of the memory, then turns back to Strange. ‘Can you help me or not?’
It’s sets of monkey bars over, what has been affectionately nicknamed, the ‘mud lake’ with random platforms at different heights around. The aim is to get from one platform to another without taking a dunk in the mud, but the platforms tilted whenever weight was added, so the trick was to distribute the weight of the team on the platform. Peter was yet to be dunked, even when he was allowed to use his webs, and was the only one to tackle it so far who had not been dunked. Natasha had ended up in the mud after Bucky had pulled her in when she let him fall off the platform.

need to stop doing that.’
Hammer’s trial is starting tomorrow, it shouldn’t take too long and Tony desperately wants Peter to go on this school trip to try and distract him from everything superhero related.
Oh hang on, I think I lost a foot at one point and it’s growing back.
Natasha tunes them out as Scott begins giving instructions. They’ve got even less time to get the information they need now, they need to hurry.
‘Yeah but he hasn’t been up for food and we all had dinner an hour ago,’ his friend points out. ‘And Pepper left an hour or so before that.’
‘Yeah, man I do remember the amount of controversy about that, even though I was so young when it happened. It followed her for a long time, even after he died of cancer. That’s how I learned why no one messed with Peggy Carter,’ Tony laughs, ‘they’d taken me out somewhere for the day, I think we were just walking around a park with some ice cream and someone came over and basically told her off for having a black man as a husband.’
He places a comforting hand on her shoulder. ‘Your powers are not helping are they? They’re tapping into the feelings others are having. Tony told me about what happened when the Guardians first arrived and how you latched onto Quill.’

Tony winces as awareness creeps in the next morning, muscles he is sure never existed before are aching and he can’t help the satisfied smile that creeps onto his face; there’s a firm weight wrapping around his back and holding him in place, and if he’s honest he’s not entirely sure where his body ends and the next one starts.
The team try to make the mansion more hospitable and plan their next steps
‘What dream-memories?’ he asks. ‘I’ve only been having strange…’
Vision’s right. He’s always known that his ‘requests for leave’ have been to go and meet Wanda; he’s never mentioned it so that they can all have deniability if it ever went tits up and they got caught. When Vision had been preparing to leave the last time, only seven days ago now, he’d given him a folder asking him to pass it on to his ‘girlfriend’ to pass on to their ‘mutual friend’. Even in the facility, at least during the day, he’d been worried about using names in case any of the day staff overheard.
‘And you think this could be done within the time frame specified?’ one of the councilwomen asks. Tony thinks he really should learn all their names.
Ned shrugs. ‘Not much, just going to kick back and play a few games I guess.’
‘Well not at the start. I was checking out some wankers we thought were with HYDRA, then I saw them give these cock-wipes a package and the energy signature was familiar so I followed them.’
‘I know what you mean,’ the other man says as they watch Tony join the group, wrapping his arms around Wanda’s waist from behind and spinning her round, making the young girl laugh and kick out her feet.
‘I don’t know what to say,’ he says quietly, ‘thank you so much.’ He turns to hug her properly, and her arms fall around him to return it.
‘You mean you wanted it,’ Sam mutters, and Steve shoots him a look to keep quiet.
Clint shrugs. ‘I owe a guy and I don’t know if he remembers or if he’s still alive. But you should be fine.’
Tony nods as Wanda joins them. ‘Where’s your suit?’
‘He’s been like a father to me. I don’t deserve him,’ Peter answers quietly.
‘Yeah, he’s uh, he’s doing better I guess. Just got to wait for everything they’re pumping him with to actually start working.’
‘Is something wrong with Strange?’ he asks, getting what amounts to a nod in response. ‘Lead the way.’ It flies along the corridor and Loki hurries after it, taking out his daggers and letting his armour fall into place as he follows.
‘Thor told me you were going to decide whether to stay or go when Yule and Christmas is over.’
‘Alright,’ she agrees, though she couldn’t say she was exactly happy with the situation. ‘But no unnecessary risks that could mean we get delayed going back while we wait for you to regenerate enough to crawl out of some bolt hole.’
‘I thought those two were going to have a fight right there in the bar!’ Bucky’s got tears streaming down his face now.
‘Exactly,’ Clint nods, ‘so she had to prove to them she was and…well she went a little overboard sometimes.’
‘You get away from him you son of a bitch,’ the soldier growls, moving towards Thanos, hammer spinning at his side and the broken shield in his other hand. Tony can only kneel there and watch as Steve quite literally hands Thanos’ ass to him. When he sends the Titan flying through the trees he rushes over to Tony. ‘Here. The last stone,’ he rips it from his armour and holds it out to Tony, then seems to notice what kind of state he’s in. ‘Tony…you can’t do this.’
“Well, even before I knew SHIELD were Hydra, I always knew they were jerks - but it never occurred to me that their jobs shouldn’t exist,” Tony explained, calmly. “And, to be honest, the idea of there being

And now he didn’t know if he’d misread everything Tony had ever said to him – after all, it had never occurred to Steve that Tony wanted him. Up until last week, Steve had never ever considered whether there was something different about Tony, much less that he was a vampire. Steve had picked up on some hint of loneliness, he’d caught glimpses of some hidden trauma… but he’d had no clue it was something on that scale… Did that mean he’d gotten it all wrong?
didn’t die either,” Steve explained… finding that brought him back to a more appropriate mood pretty quickly. “I don’t know how much you know about it, but he’d been captured by Hydra once before that, and they experimented on him. They gave him a version of the serum, which is what helped him to survive that fall - and then Hydra found him again. No one knew it, but they’d taken him to a lab and continued their experiments… and they found a way to control him. A literal mind control technique that basically turned him into a puppet for them…”

to develop new drugs.”
There was a tenderness in Tony’s expression that Steve hadn’t seen since ten years from now...
He waited until the servers had made their way further down the bar. Watched until each of them was fully distracted. Picked his moment, tugged Tony’s hand, and ran.
Tony wasn’t sure if he’d ever felt like this.
But, no.
“Bucky! Hey, Bucky!”
“I just know this is going to be important, is all,” he muttered, weakly. Bucky pursed his lips sceptically, and Steve’s blush deepened, because, yeah – they both knew

backed away-
And then Steve just grabbed Tony’s wrist, and pulled him into his lap like he was weightless. Tony let out a surprised yelp, still grinning when he felt Steve’s arms close around him…
These would be the first people to even know what he looked like. The first time anyone could ask him a question or listen to his opinion or take offence to him in some way... The first time he had to think about what it meant to be human. The more Tony tried to process that idea, the more terrifying it became. The more he remembered the reasons he’d hidden himself away from people in the first place.
Tony felt an immediate, disorienting lift inside him, a sudden rush of nervous excitement and self-conscious joy.
He had to decide
“...Okay,” Steve replied, looking up at Sam for any additional clues - and finding only an irritable sort of resignation.
Steve was still sleeping deeply in Tony’s arms by the time the sun set that evening, his body heavy and warm against Tony’s chest.
And then Steve started to move faster.
It was early Saturday evening, and the three of them had been sitting in the living room for the last few hours, just talking. Bucky was sitting cross legged on the floor, his back resting on the coffee table, and Tony was lying on the couch with his head in Steve’s lap. The TV was still on in the background, but they’d long since stopped paying attention to it, instead drifting easily into Tony’s questions about Steve’s childhood…
And, just as he was scrambling for a way to end this whole thing, Tony looked back at him with an entirely different sort of focus.
And Zan looked up at them again, a defeated look in her eyes now.
“That’s Andrew” Tony whispered, recognising him at the same moment Steve did “Vanessa’s husband.”
A blush ran up Bucky’s neck, as he recognised how unsubtle that exchange was - and that he had no idea what he was going to say to cover it up.

And then, like a timid shoulder angel, a thought dutifully occurred to him,

Whatever ‘it’ was, Tony only had to see it to know that it was something natural and reassuring and good…
He could feel it.
“I don’t know either,” he whispered - tiptoeing around a conversation that he knew was coming anyway.
“And it didn’t bother you?” Steve asked, tetchily. Tony got the impression that one had just slipped out.

that Rhodey had shared so ridiculous a detail in such a deadpan tone.
“No need to be impertinent, darling,” he called back, hesitating just a few seconds longer – even though he knew it made no sense. That an extra minute wouldn’t make any difference, that he was going to have to talk about it right now, as much as he didn’t want to. Or tell Rhodey he didn’t want to talk about it, which seemed almost as uncomfortable…
It occurred to Steve that maybe he wasn’t sobering up - maybe he was

Steve huffed out an irritated little sound. He thought,

getting closer to Tony, who knew, maybe even the relationship that Steve really wanted-
“Yeah,” Tony answered impatiently. Freddie nodded thoughtfully.
He felt the car settle into silence, blinking as he refocused his eyes on the scenery around them - vaguely surprised to find that they’d arrived.
And then Steve fingertips brushed over that sweet spot, deep inside him. Tony felt his whole body contract around Steve’s hand, every sensation being dragged down to that one point.

“I understand, you must all be tired and disoriented from the journey. I know, it can be unnerving - but I assure you, it’s perfectly safe, and the effects will wear off in a few moments.”
And then Nick strolled into the room, a raft of envelopes dangling casually from one hand, looking more relaxed than Steve had ever seen him-
It’d be something to do, until Steve got home.
And he glanced at Steve, and quirked an eyebrow.
…So that he could make a memory of this.
Bucky knows that tone. In a very primitive way, he understands it. Reassurance. Care.
Steve's surroundings melted around him, as he lost tension necessary to keep himself upright in them - like some grand metaphor for the whole thing.
Anyway - enjoy!
But not as much as Tony was…
But Steve didn’t know
“Mm-hm,” Steve murmured against his skin. And then he felt Tony card his hand through his hair…
“I know,” Steve sighed. He’d known that anyway, even before this little interlude… to be honest, he’d been surprised that Bucky had let him get away with it for this long. And, up until tonight, that had been yet another item on his increasingly hysterical list of things he really couldn’t deal with…
“Consorts?” Tony repeated. There was an instant tug of connection, which was both unnerving and strangely compelling.
...Tony was talking about having Bucky move in with him.
“But you got Adam?” Tony clarified, glancing at Steve –

“Okay, Steve is, at the moment, in a meeting with ‘Talleroy Communications’ – the same company that gave him this flyer, a few months ago,” Tony explained, with a clarity and authority that would’ve been beyond him a minute earlier. “They’ve been networking with the Avengers for months, pretending to be a ‘communications’ firm – but they aren’t. They’re a chemical weapons manufacturer, or they’re dealing in black market pharmaceuticals – whatever it is they’re doing, they’ve been working with some seriously dangerous chemicals, in enough quantities to leave traces on their paperwork,” and he gestured with the flyer again, and waited until Peppers patient compassion had melted into general confusion, and then sharped into a more focused concern.
Instead, he carried on through to the bedroom - appreciating the little details of his surroundings as he went.
Oh! God! This point! This infuriating,
“Hold the light over the floor, wait for the beep, press the button on the end there, and then drop it down on the floor…” She carried on narrating, even though Tony was doing it all ahead of her instructions.
,” Rhodey suggested, in a conspiratorial whisper. “That’s harder to yell at.”
As embarrassed as he was that he cared, and as anxious as he was that Tony would see that he cared, Steve simply couldn’t ignore his burning need to know. It was as close as he could bring himself to outright asking – and his desperate hope that Tony would answer him was so much greater than his fear that Tony would guess why he was saying this.
pulling?’
She smiles at him. ‘Sorry, getting distracted by my thoughts,’ she answers. ‘Come on, let’s go.’ She slings an arm around his shoulders when she reaches him, pressing a kiss to the top of his head and wishing she could bottle this one moment of peace and keep Peter this young, strong and loving forever.
‘How’s Strange?’ Steve asks.
me, Deadpool.’
Love always,
‘Bucky?’ the small voice forces him to open his eyes.
of them you said that.’
‘Our top bidder is Stark Industries CEO, Miss Pepper Potts. Come up here Miss Potts,’ Pepper glides through the crowd, with a smile wearing a beautiful yellow dress. ‘Mind if I take a guess Miss Potts and say you might be choosing your boss to dance with?’
They all exchange brief greetings as they hurry towards Happy and the waiting limo. Tony feels a small slice of tension melt away as Steve falls into step beside him, the rest of the group falling in behind them. It all felt very natural.
‘I am Groot.’
‘I had to carry it all from the car,’ Peter grumbles above her, ‘trust me, you did.’ Sam laughs where he’s in the attic with the teenager.
‘When he brings the paperwork to say he’s adopted him I’m getting the biggest ‘I told you so’ ready.’
‘Oh, please help yourself to my food,’ the soldier grumbles.
‘Hello?’ he calls out, hearing his echo carry. ‘Doctor Strange?’ There’s no reply. After a minute or so he sighs. ‘Alright well in that case I’ll just see if I can find him. I mean he does
Time to up the volume boys.
Shuri cackles before going over to join Bruce in talking about the work the team is starting in joining up their scientific and technological advances with other countries and teams around the world. Meanwhile, Peter turns his attention to what Shuri has left him with and tries to contain his excitement when he sees she’s looking at improving her long-range communications devices to work across space.
‘All ready to go Thor?’ Natasha asks him as she reaches them.
The smile on the brunette’s face makes him feel a bit giddy. ‘Pretty sure that’s impossible, Pool.’
‘Honestly Steve why are you so worried?’ the red head laughs, putting his button hole in his lapel. ‘You look amazing.’
‘Why didn’t you tell us you knew her?’ Steve asks softly.
‘Now some of you may know that I’ve been really lucky to be given an internship at Stark Industries, so I thought I’d possibly be able to cheat a bit and choose Captain America. Unfortunately someone was a little quicker than me and had already chosen him and we weren’t allowed to do the same person as someone else. So I was a bit stumped. Then I was up at the Avengers Facility one weekend to help out and I got talking to Captain Rogers about the people who had been big influences on him, especially during the war, trying to get an idea of who I could do my presentation on. He came up with a lot of names I’m sure we’re all familiar with: Dr Erskine, who made the super soldier serum; Howard Stark, who built the machine used to inject the serum, and then helped to create the iconic shield; Agent Carter, along with members of the Howling Commandos. But then Na- Agent Romanoff made the comment that without one particular person Captain America would have forever stayed a propaganda side show and may not have become the hero we know today.
‘You know that is not true!’ Thor protests. ‘You are a true warrior, Valkyrie, and I could not leave Asgard in better hands. You would make a wonderful queen in your own right.’
Hammer just laughs. ‘Whatever you say, Anthony. How about we give your friends a little call?’
‘So now we’ve got two trees to get home,’ Rhodes sighs. ‘Next year I’m coming to get the tree.’
‘I wish people would stop saying that
‘Oh no. How do you expect to explain to Happy why we want to go to a bar?’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Clint,’ Natasha sighs, bending down to check on him where he’s rubbing the spot on his head that connected with the boiler. ‘I guess he didn’t get the memo this morning.’
‘Angry? Why would he be angry with you? Currently he’s freaking out thinking you’ve run away or been kidnapped or something. I’ll be surprised if he’s got any hair left by the time we get back.’
‘What is it?’ Steve asks.
‘Everything has gone exactly as you said, sir,’ the assistant says, handing him the report.
‘What are you doing, Weasel? There’s no exit back here,’ he hears Peter sigh.
‘Is this the wrong time for me to be walking in?’ Wade looks between the occupants as he makes his way to the kitchenette; at the glare Bucky sends him he spins on his heel and goes to the sofas.
‘You were selling to both sides,’ Bucky states, not a trace of accusation in his tone.
Love always,
‘Are you ever going to confirm that your friend is the Devil vigilante or am I going to have to sit here and resist the urge to call Tony with this information?’
‘Fine,’ he huffs.
; and this fight is not just physical, he’s also having to focus on pushing past the barrier that has been erected in Bucky’s mind, blocking their link.
‘You broke my nose,’ Bucky sulks as Natasha takes the seat opposite him at the dinner table.
‘Ready as I’ll ever be,’ he sighs. ‘What about you two?’
He shrugs and doesn’t meet his gaze. ‘Kinda. I mean I did screw up, Mr Wilson. I don’t blame Mr Stark for taking the suit away; I really wish he hadn’t, but I know why he did. I just don’t want him to feel that way again.’
‘This is getting ridiculous,’ Rhodes fumes, ‘he’s wanting people to register? It’s only so he knows who he can target to add to the Avengers roster, or who he can make his own team out of for when we do something he doesn’t like.’
you and I’m not going to wait until the world ends to do something about it.’
‘Wait we are?’ Wade looks up from their argument.
of and not have such detailed knowledge of. Oh and you got to see some of the stuff on the actual magic side of things, it’s amazing its like- uh. Nat?’ He stops his flow as Natasha pulls him into a tight hug, his head held firmly against her stomach. ‘Nat? You alright?’
For a minute he thinks the genius is going to argue with him, but then Tony gives a small laugh and nods. ‘Yeah. He’s a good kid and he seems to be creating these terrible parenting habits in me.’
‘Wanda!’ he’s cut off by another message coming in and looks down at his phone.
To his event greater surprise, Clint looks a little ashamed as he shakes his head. ‘Avengers’ honour it’s safe.’
Loki clearly has enough of the alien’s words because he summons his dagger and slits its throat. ‘We need to get back and prepare,’ he turns to the others, ‘Thanos will bring his army, and he will know of our strength from Proxima Midnight.’
‘Yes,’ Strange looks carefully between them all.
‘Yeah no sorry, Cap too busy here. Loki! Syrup is going clear, what do I do now?’
Tony sniggers at the last comment. ‘So it’s just you two old men playing by yourselves?’
have known there was double dealing going on and stopped it, but I wasn’t the one doing the deals. Maybe I shouldn’t have made all of those weapons, but
‘Just thinking,’ he replies.
Tony’s already turned away and is running towards the plane. ‘Steve! Stop!’
A/N: Hi everyone. Thank you so much for all the love being shown this series! Please do keep letting me know what you think and if there is anything you'd like to see in the future.
As always do let me know what you think of this chapter.
made attached to you, and I’ll be coming to help him with that so there’s no more chance of a screw up.’
what you focus on?’ he can hear the eye roll in Natasha’s voice but doesn’t dare look up at either of them yet.
‘Ok you two that’s it for today. I’m not sure I can take much more,’ Natasha laughs as the two of them collapse into a laughing heap on the floor.
‘You know Bruce better than anyone else, Tony.’
just by being around before you even met him? You’re honestly going to stand there and tell me that when that spider first bit you and you realised you had these powers the first thing you didn’t think was “wow now I get to be like Iron Man”?’
Loki looks away from the penetrating blue eyes. ‘You seem to think you can read me, Winter Warrior, I’d advise caution. I don’t tend to stay too long in one place, necessity of defeating our enemy has kept me here longer than intended.’
‘What’s the best way to do this?’ Tony asks, as the alien steadies himself on his feet.
Steve, who has already taken off his tie and suit jacket, and undone his top two buttons just laughs at the teen. ‘Wouldn’t surprise me kid.’
‘I’m not sure
‘Has Natasha told him of her thoughts and feelings?’
And as always here's your sneak peek:
‘We got him Tony,’ Natasha says, appearing next to the god. ‘You two handle Thanos.’
‘Then you’re going to be eating my ice, doc,’ Wade cackles as he speeds past.
Clint nods. ‘Yeah I know, I got a look at you when you pulled the whole mind control thing just like you did with me. Taken me a long time to work out just what it is I learned though, and I very much doubt I even brushed the surface.’ They’re silent for a few minutes, though it’s not as tense as their interactions have been in the past. ‘Thing is, I realised I wasn’t exactly setting the best example to my kids, by not trying to move on. How can I expect them to forgive each other and us when we make mistakes if I can’t do the same for someone else?’
Natasha nods and sips at her coffee. ‘I get it. Get each of them their own reputation that is as safe as possible, so if anything does happen with Ross like last night there’ll be backlash from the public not just from the Council.’ She smirks at him over her mug. ‘You want to start a proper PR war.’
‘You, my beautiful wonder,’ Tony says as he lands next to them, ‘have never had such good timing.’
‘Because if he hadn’t he thought the
that, but I’m still going to worry. If you promise to keep him safe, I’ll give you a chance.’
‘Did they surrender?’ Bucky asks as they get back.
For the first time in a long time, Wade feels a strange emotion. Almost like he might start to belong somewhere.
‘My name’s Wade, Baby Boy.’
‘More like I know you too well. When did Tony get you measured up for a tux then?’
‘I’m guessing Bucky didn’t win considering his mood,’ Steve sighs.
