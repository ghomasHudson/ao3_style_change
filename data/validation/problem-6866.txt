The two were next to Steve and Natasha now. "You do see how busted this lab is, right? There's no way it can take another beating from him," Tony realized.
, the computer's voice responded. So, Tony kept flipping various switches. "There has to be something, there just has to be- damnit! Where the hell is it?"
"She's pretty impressive, huh?" Clint's face was smug as he watched Natasha scale the rock wall-it looked effortless, like she was just floating up the wall.
The gas had hardly gone out of the room by the time the door clicked shut and the figure moved, disturbed by the noise. And it headed right towards Steve.
The gas that streamed out was just cooled oxygen, so that was a plus. No noxious gasses to knock out Bruce. Both of them cautiously wandered into the room, keeping their eyes on the massive, heaving shape in the middle of the room, completely silent. Steve almost tripped over a random object on the ground: it was Bruce's pair of wire-framed glasses, a crack running through both of the lenses, the frame bent out of proportion.
Tony decided that if they were alone, he would probably have already started making out with Steve by now; the redder he got, the sexier and more adorable he got. But he resisted temptation. "Come on, you've gotta tell me sooner or later."
"Bruce and I have this great idea. We don't really need it, but the teacher is offering extra credit to people who develop, and perform, their own experiment. We-"
"Right. Just calm down, and we'll get this entire thing fi-" Mid-sentence, Tony was launched through the air, hitting the glass paneling and falling down in a fetal position, out cold. Steve felt like his heart just dropped down into his stomach after Tony made no movement after his impact with the glass.
The beast that they had been fighting sat in the corner directly across from them, wrapped around the original gamma ray mechanism. The beast towered over the lab room, its body filling up the entire corner it was in and then some. Steve's first-look impression was right by two details: it certainly was green, and it was more humanoid than what was expected. Hell, it looked like it was just a large, green bodybuilder wearing shorts.
"We tried knocking down the door to the room, but we ruptured a pipe instead, and we couldn't see what happened," Tony continued. The hitch in his voice proved how hard it was to throw Steve under the bus for all of this.
"I think you hit your head harder than you think you did," Steve let out a small, nervous laugh, and headed back into the thinning cloud.
When it looked up, Tony and Steve gave it direct eye contact, and immediately its breathing quickened, the entire body of the monster tensing up like it was about to attack.
"...an experiment," he mumbled into his legs. Every jaw in the room practically dropped to the floor. Bruce had spoken, he was listening. Maybe that meant that everything was okay. Steve could see the tears welling up in Tony's eyes.
There was a drone of mumbles from the majority of the class, and two clear whoops and hollers from Natasha and Clint.
Natasha just fell to the ground from the almost impossible position she was in. "I swear, you two just need to make out and get over your sexual tensions."
"That is irrelevant," Tony snapped back, scanning the panel in a fury, "Bruce set the entire thing up. All I could think about was... Never mind, that's not important. We need to figure this thing out."
"Howard Stark. I used to work with him. He works with the weapons development with SH-erm, with my company. He also worked with the government, with the military. Helped develop, well,
"Sometimes, I forget that I'm the only super soldier around," Steve mumbled to himself, and forced his hand into Tony's pocket. "You gotta realise, Stark: We're in a large lab room, but the thing, whatever it is, that we're dealing with here is big, too. We don't exactly have a lot of wiggle room." He pulled out the key, shoved it into the lock, and pried the door open with Tony.
Tony struggled to his feet shortly after. "Steve, let me. I've known him for so long, we're basically brothers." As they both got up, the door clicked shut, and the rage in the monster's-well, Bruce's-eyes skyrocketed. Nonetheless, Tony kept walking towards it-towards the monster that until moments ago was his best friend.
"We're thinking of using the lab equipment at Tony's dad's mansion," Bruce cut him off. "I'm going to be the coordinator of the experiment, Cap, so this time it's me that gets to give the commands."
"Are you seriously going to sit here and talk about what does and doesn't constitute as blood and guts," Bruce asked, getting annoyed, "or can we actually do this?"
Tony grabbed the backrest of Steve's chair and maneuvered the chair and the soldier to the center of the panel, where they could overlook the entire lab room through a single pane of glass.
"You think I don't know that?" Tony turned to face Steve quickly, and Steve could see tears welling up in his eyes yet again. "Fuck it," he stormed out of the room in a panicked anger, and grabbed the fire extinguisher.
"What?" Howard screamed, looking at Tony like he had two heads. "You think that I'm going to believe that I should tranquilize an innocent teenager? What should make me believe that Bruce is becoming..." he ran his hand through his hair, panicking, "becoming a..."
The hedges look professionally trimmed, the gravel driveway perfectly evened. Steve would place bets on hired help, but, knowing the Starks, it was probably the work of robotics. Despite how old the building probably was, the bricks and windows appeared to gleam, making the mansion look like a modern palace.
"Oh," Steve grinned, "Tony Stark. He said he'd help me with science, and with decking out Bells, and-"
Tony sat up, spinning his head in all directions. The entire wall of "military-grade steel" glass behind them was shattered, but not broken. And the door was left hanging open, by a single hinge. The window between the lab and the control room was completely caved in. It was only after Tony finished panicking about the state of his lab when he realized what was really wrong about this scene: Bruce was quivering in a tight fetal position in the darkest corner of the room, almost completely naked.
Soon, the class ended, and Steve headed home, his motorcycle, Bells, being his private escape from the crazy world he just launched himself into.
As Steve wandered up to bed, Coulson pulled out his laptop, and started up his video conference. A few seconds after it started up, the face of Nick Fury came into view. Coulson immediately saluted.
"Uh, yeah," Steve looked at Tony with a completely straight face, but Tony knew he was lying. If Steve went into a poker game, he'd be out before the game even started.
Tony grabbed a nearby blanket, stuck his key in the lock, turned the door open, and quietly strut into the lab room.
Tony was pretty sure Steve couldn't get any more attractive than he was now, so he kept pushing. "Training... from the US Military?"
Fury somewhat chuckled, or maybe it was a small burp from dinner, Coulson couldn't quite tell which. "This school is the safest in the district. It's SHIELD run. If anyone was
The very first thing Steve woke up to was the groans of a sore Tony Stark, laying in the exact same position he had been left in by the Hulk.
"Easy girls," Bruce said, pushing them apart, "Steve, Tony was joking. Tony, Steve didn't mean to hit you that hard." The scientist-at-heart rolled his eyes. It felt more like he was on babysitting duty and less like he was about to perform a highly dangerous experiment with two friends. "Now, let's go. We still need to set up the final parts of the experiment."
to develop. Each one has been tested, they work well enough to stun someone. So, if the enemy gets past the other guards at the entrances-also skilled at hand-to-hand combat-we can stun him and bring him into custody to see what company he is affiliated with."
After she was out of earshot, Clint looked back at Natasha and mumbled to Steve, "She scales that wall like a spider on a web, I swear. It's ridiculous."
"Oh, shit!" Tony shouted, the seductive voice he had been using earlier completely gone and replaced with a sense of sheer terror.
Tony heard the same roar that preceded his launching across the room, and heard a bang similar to that of metal on metal. Steve was launched backwards in his defensive position. The only thing that was different was a huge fist imprint on the little lab table-shield that was wrapped around his right arm.
Tony crouched down right next to Steve's ear. "I guess we'll find out, eh, Cap?" He whispered, winking at the soldier.
Tony tried to fumble around in his pocket with what energy he had left from being launched around the room.
After that, the day couldn't go fast enough. Steve, for some reason, couldn't help but be excited about working in the same room as Tony Stark. After all, Tony was the kid that decided to say "hi" to Steve on his first day of school just for the hell of it, the kid that was kind enough to try to help him in chemistry the first day. And now he and Bruce Banner and Tony Stark were spending an entire weekend together. Granted, they were going to be studying something Steve found totally unnecessary and hard to get a grasp on, but it was Banner and Stark. Nothing could possibly ruin this weekend.
The laptop screen went blank, and Coulson shut it, putting it back in his briefcase and going up to his bedroom.
to know that, we'd have to expand from how many requests we'd be getting for admission. Go to bed, Coulson. Sleep soundly; your 'nephew' is safe. I promise."
Steve held out his hand in opposition. "Yeah, yeah, I got it. You don't have to tell me all the details."
"Haven't you guys thought that maybe it could affect us?" Steve asked. "I mean, if this thing goes horribly wrong..."
"Nice going, Captain!" Clint would shout, mocking Steve's US Military training. Steve kept having this feeling that Tony and Clint must meet up and tell each other about his chronic problem of messing up in what he doesn't know what he's doing.
"Damnit!" Tony pounded his fist on the door. "It seals when the experiment begins, we can't get in there!" His pounding became futile, as the young man slumped to the ground and began to sob. "Bruce is in there… it's all my fault… Rogers…"
Steve started to laugh, along with everyone else but Tony, when they heard a groan. They all turned their attention to the oversized lab room for the first time since they dragged the Hulk in there, to see Bruce on his side, completely naked.
"I'm one of the agents for SHIELD, the company that your father used to work for. But my question is," Coulson turned from his conversations about work to Steve, "why weren't you at home by curfew last night, young man?"
"Oh, hey, by the way," Tony motioned to his friend, "this is Bruce Banner. He's a total medical science nerd, so..."
"Y'know," he muttered to Steve, "I'm not a huge chemist, either. I'm much more into physics. But I can
The screen showed Fury moving his hand from the top to the bottom, telling Coulson to calm down. "The minute you said you would be sending Rogers to this school, I started preparing. Each of the security guards that roams the halls keeps the small prototypes of the ray guns that Stark
"Clue's always an option," Clint said, and smirked, "just because Tony's a spoiled rich kid doesn't mean his intellect is that great when it comes to solving crimes."
Steve started to respond to Tony's flirtation, but he was still shocked and flustered from the interaction. "I-" He started, but he heard a click of the door to the lab room. The blonde watched as Bruce walked through the encased lab and to the table, putting the cage of rats on it. It was clear that he was completely oblivious to Steve and Tony in the control room.
Peter grinned back at him, clearly overwhelmed by either Tony’s words or the hug, but Tony had no time to figure out which. He tapped his chest and summoned his visor display. “Friday? Get me Sam, right now.”
The Queen paused. “Probably not, Captain Rogers. But I ask you to listen.” She turned to face Steve, her chin raised, looking every inch her mother’s daughter. “Regardless of Stark’s promise to bring back my brother, there can never again be another Black Panther. The garden is destroyed. The tradition is ended. And once my brother passes, Wakanda will go unprotected. Forever. That is why I wish to investigate the serum in your blood. If I can understand how you were made, then perhaps I can create a new tradition. Find a new way to protect our people.”
Yet it is. Vision stands before him, yellow life restored to his brow. Not a gem. His glow now radiates from within, steady and free. Yellow, tinged with orange. “Yes,” Vision says, mild as ever. “The Mind Stone has moved on, but has granted me life in its absence.” Wanda at his side looks equal parts teary-eyed and exultant. The android hesitates, frowns. “I have also been given a message for you, Captain Rogers. Short, but nonetheless meaningful, I hope.”
Steve met his gaze, solemn, earnest. “Maybe I love you because it’s the truth,” he said. Unable to believe but unwilling to argue, Tony leaned in and kissed him, long and sweet, until Steve sighed against his lips, his body slackening as if he’d just run out of battery.
“I take it that’s a no,” Barnes said mildly. “He probably won’t on his own, you know. He always did have a habit of waiting too long.”
Then Steve gave Tony’s hand a squeeze, weak but steady. “Okay… It’s okay, Tony… I’ll do it.” Tony sucked in a breath, dizzy with thanks, but Steve continued. “On one… condition…”
“Saying sorry doesn’t change anything about what happened,” Steve said. “About what I did. But I am sorry, Tony. I’ve been sorry for years.” He paused. “I wanted to call every day. Tell you that I was sorry. That I missed you. But I thought you might not answer. That you might need more time. So I waited. But I wrote to you, so we didn’t seem so… finished.” His expression twisted into anguish. “And then it was too late to tell you anything, because you were already gone. Because I’d left, so you had to fight alone, and then we had to fight without you, and then it was over and you were gone and we’d
It was a lot to ask of anyone, and Steve felt a slight shame that he hadn’t realized the ramifications earlier. Of course, Stark would rather stay in New York, near the comfort of his home. His fiancé. Working with Steve just happened to be the lesser of two evils. Nothing more.
And some final shred of fighting instinct rallied in Tony, because he knew she was right. They couldn’t stop Peter helping. It was the very best part of him, just like she’d said.
Tony kept chattering as Okoye escorted them through the ubiquitous SHIELD-designed maze of identical corridors. Too much chattering, he knew. Yet after a year of working together, he’d learned to tell whether the Wakandan King’s implacable politeness was masking annoyance or amusement. Luckily today T’Challa seemed amused by his babbling, because today Tony couldn’t have shut up if he tried. This planetary defense system, if successful, would go a long way towards alleviating his daily struggle with existential cosmic terror. After today, he might actually be able to sleep.
The scientist leaned forward. “Vision’s mind is made up of a complex overlay of multiple parts, kinda like how a human brain is itself a synthesis between remnant reptile systems and the more recently evolved mammalian system. The Mind Stone was needed at first to give him the kind of raw processing power that we find in infants, which worked well enough to create a truly new type of life. But Vision’s brain has spent the past two years laying down neurological patterns, basically solidifying its own independent structure. If we can bypass the Mind Stone as an energy source while preserving his synaptic patterns, we should be able to extract the Stone while leaving his cognitive abilities intact.”
But thoughts like that were part of the problem, he realized now. Ordinary or not, Steve was just a man who had been placed in extraordinary circumstances, and no one had recognized in time the extraordinary effort it must have taken for Steve to rise to their expectations, never mind surpass them, over and over. Tony himself had been the worst offender in those early years, happily ducking out of every possible responsibility to pursue only the fun bits of being an Avenger. He’d learned too well since the Accords fallout just how much of Steve’s labor had gone unremarked, how much silent fear and stress and doubt there was in being a real leader. But Tony was lucky; he’d had Pepper and Rhodey to vent to, trusting in the low moments that his oldest friends would listen to him as a person first and worry about what it meant for the team later. Did Steve have anyone he could trust like that?
But when he looked across the room, the super-soldier was nowhere to be seen and Tony found himself on his feet, immediately launched into full panic mode. Everyone around fell ominously silent, then burst into action, Nat demanding answers on who saw him last. Tony shut it all out, taking a few staggering steps towards the door, cursing his body for failing to
Steve and Tony turned to face each other, the odd mirror-like ground beneath them also beginning to crack and bend. Neither spoke. The past six months had been a long road pitted with near-disasters, all leading up to this moment. Their last moment, in all likelihood. Steve held out his left hand, and Tony took it. Perhaps some other version of them would live on in some other future, remembering other lifetimes, sharing other circles. In exchange for saving half the universe, this wasn’t such a bad bargain.
“Not really,” he said, then took a deep breath. Honesty. “I don’t know what Steve and I are to each other, but friends is not the right word. We’re… something else. Maybe something more.” She took her hand away. “I am so sorry, Pepper,” he said, the remorse so heavy within him. Yet she was looking back at him without any surprise, as if… He exhaled. Of course. She already knew.
At the sound of his voice, Tony raised his head, glaring right through him as if daring him to comment. “What, Rogers, never seen a grown man cry?”
They tumbled into the bed, soft silk against soft skin. As ever, Tony took over whenever Steve’s confidence faltered, reassuring him with kisses wherever his light-hearted words failed to reach. The other man patiently led Steve through the contours of his own body, exploring exactly how and where he liked to be touched. After Steve’s second flailing orgasm nearly made him pass out again, he awkwardly asked if he could learn by focusing on Tony’s body instead. The other man broke into slightly hysterical giggles before formally granting his request.
“That’s okay too,” Tony said, swallowing around a sudden lump in his throat. “We’ve already established no more fighting. That’s a start.”
“You’re going to have to hold him back,” Tony told her, and he waited as the revelation slammed home for her too. Hard to watch, but the android rallied. Nodded. Tony took a breath, then walked towards the cliff edge.
“I should never have involved him in Avengers business,” Tony said. “I’m so sorry, he’s just a kid, he shouldn’t have to deal with any of this-”
And it was Steve’s turn to lay a comforting hand upon the other man’s shoulder. “I’m sorry, Buck. For the train. And everything since.”
The steady beeps and gentle murmurs had infiltrated his dreams, and so for a brief eon, Steve was a spaceship, floating through endless stars.
No, it was the finality that hurt the most. The fact that their paths, so long intertwined, had finally, hopelessly, diverged.
They reached the day’s designated safe-room, currently guarded by two Dora Milaje. Inside, Shuri was draped over an armchair in a teenager’s spine-killing sprawl, restlessly flicking through music channels on the suite’s giant screen.
The difference between success and failure proved to be Peter’s second idea, which was to ask Thor for advice about the Reality Stone. The Asgardian king had told them of the Stone’s ability to take on a host, and after consulting with three of Asgard’s finest surviving healers, he had volunteered to do so. His godly ability to withstand the Stone’s power had allowed Strange to successfully channel its magic into the past through the Time Stone and restore the serum back when Steve was still alive, thus granting him time to heal and, through some nonsensical twist of sorcery, bringing Steve back to life in the present. It had taken some time for Steve to wake, but once his revival proved the idea worked, Strange and Thor had immediately left for Wakanda, hoping to do the same with the rest of Earth’s casualties. Unfortunately, they found that without the third factor of the serum’s healing properties, the standard human body could not withstand the procedure.
“Engage protocol seventeen,” Shuri announced, sweeping into the main lab with two Dora Milaje at her back. The young Queen nodded to the others as she stepped up beside Tony. “
“Sorry.” Steve forced his arms into a less crushing grip, but he was still disturbed by what the billionaire had said. “Please tell me you were kidding, though.”
Fire, he thought. He was on fire. It tasted of rainbows, centuries. Time. So little time. He managed to raise the Gauntlet, the nanobots he’d just programed raising Steve’s left arm to him, carrying the Power Stone near, but Tony was losing the strands of what that meant, getting tangled within his own magnitude, it was too much, it was too much, there was too much for the Tony-thing to contain and he was scream and fire in ten thousand directions without end but there was now a hand holding his - impossible - and the Tony-thing named this impossible thing Steve, remembered what a Steve-thing meant, found what a Tony meant; he opened his eyes to find the metal Gauntlet melting in a red glow and reforming around their joined hands; together, he and his Steve commanded the Power Stone to yield, and - impossibly - it did.
i planned this fic as one unit, sorta like a movie, and as i finished it i went back and neatened up the earlier chapters, so the whole thing might be worth a re-read now that it's over. i may come back in a week and tweak the final two chapters but for now i'm sick of looking at them, lol.
“Oh, do shut up,” the Soul Stone said, and a blue band of light snaked its way around Thanos’ face, stifling his speech. “Perhaps I misspoke; listen is the wrong word.” She looked at Steve, Tony and Gamora in turn and smiled reassuringly. “It is more accurate to say we will… read.”
“So what?” Bucky sounded incredulous. “So it only took your stubborn ass literally a hundred years to let anyone get this close. Making this not an insignificant development.”
“There was nothing wrong with you,” Tony said sharply. Probably he meant well, but the dismissal stung.
May quickly recovered her usual equilibrium, but now he could see the seams of what was a hard-fought, constructed acceptance. “Neither of us can stop him, Tony,” she told him, her gaze piercing. “But with your help, Peter is safer than he would be alone. So please, just keep doing what you can, where you can. That’s all I ask. That’s all either of us can do.”
Too late. Natasha already had a blade at his throat, a victory smile on her lips. “Honey, we’re home.”
Steve could almost admire the brutal ambition of the Sokovian soldier’s scheme. Psychological warfare had never really interested him, the long-armed delicacy required seeming too fickle for the coarse churn of the battlefield, too dependent on luck and circumstance. Yet in his quest to dismantle the Avengers, Zemo had been able to identify Steve as the team’s weakest link and ruthlessly exploit his flaws, all from a comfortable distance.
Steve could only blink, because he hadn’t, in fact, thought of that. At all. It seemed a ludicrous possibility.
,” Steve breathed, clearly still floating down from his wonder high. Plus, hungry Steve was never the sharpest Steve.
Steve looked troubled but eventually nodded. “Okay.” He took a deep breath. “Tony, there’s just not much left… I don’t know if I can…” He shook his head. “What happens if it’s too late?”
Helen had turned towards the glass window, to the silent audience Steve’s sharp mind had been carefully avoiding. “I will run these tests myself, Nurse Parker, if you could perhaps show me the way back to the lab?”
It wasn’t like he was oblivious. Everyday he witnessed the struggles out there, drank them in and spat them out in short bursts, his mind alternating between shying away from such enormity and attempting to swallow everything at once in an endless despair. Steve could see the same see-saw moments play out within his team, could see when his friends tipped too far, needing to step away for a minute, an hour, a day. Yet they always returned, fighting even now for balance. In truth everyone on the planet was struggling in their own way, and that brought some absurd comfort. It made the struggle normal, a fierce ghoulish normal where no one was okay but at least everyone understood why.
But too late, he was too late, as Thanos drew his arm back and punched Rogers in his unprotected ribs, the sickening crunch audible to everyone on the street. The alien then tossed him aside, Rogers rolling down the steps in a helpless tangle of limbs. Tony was screaming, every part of him was screaming and then he was fighting Thanos one-on-one, beating at him as if he could force the the alien to take it back, as if the alien could
He was crying too, but there was nothing else to be done, and so Tony ignored Steve’s pleas. Dismissed the armor. Stood cold in the wind and looked far down to the sharp rocks below, trying to pretend his shaking was from anything but terror.
“Tony?” he mumbled, twisting to see his face, but the other man was sobbing too hard in relief, was clutching Steve too tight in his grasp.
Huddled against the wall, Ty moaned softly. When Tony glanced over, the man was holding his arm at an odd angle; he must have injured himself in his earlier scramble to escape.
That was a weakness that Steve could no longer permit. The truth was simple. Tony Stark was not worthy of his trust. Even if this was just the other man's revenge for Steve’s own betrayal. Even if, in some ways, Steve had provoked this retaliation. And Tony had been nothing if not clear. He’d told Steve they were no longer friends. It had been Steve’s mistake to wish they could be anything more.
During, he felt shredded as a clay pigeon in a glass tornado; after, like his mind had been scraped slowly over a ocean of sandpaper; yet their redesign
At his flinch, she shook her head, her expression softening. “No, I mean… it’s more that it doesn’t matter, you and Steve. Not for you and me. I was already done. One minute, we were in New York planning our wedding, you were talking about baby names, for Christ’s sake, and then the next you were gone, and I was alone, and you want to know the worst part? All I could think was, here we go again.”
The Ancient One frowns. “Normally, no. Your past has already happened to you. You may return to it at any point, but upon the moment of your arrival the probabilities of chaos will reset, and that world will split off into something new. No matter what you do, each new timeline will rapidly diverge from what you know. The flow of time cannot be interrupted. Existence will adapt to anything, even its own destruction. However,” she hesitates, and Steve shivers once, there on the rooftop, “there is one exception.”
Nat crossed to the couch, kneeling before Tony and Steve. “He asked where you were, so I told him that you just left, that you went home. He seemed… excited. He asked if it was true that Steve had come back from the dead. Then he asked if you knew.”
“Easy, Doc,” Tony drawled, eyes narrowed in warning. “You’re not in trouble. But Steve’s the only patient you need to worry about today.”
Tony by his side, Steve walked halfway to the landing zone, saw Bruce, Okoye and Shuri safely disembark, and waved them towards the hut. Nebula took longer to emerge. Steve knew this had to be a difficult moment for her, but she showed no outward sign of distress. The android nodded to them both, then swept off towards Thanos. It was time. Tony kept pace beside Steve as they followed Nebula to where the wounded Titan lay.
,” Tony breathed in a low, husky voice; he felt Steve’s whole body shudder in response, but the other man kept himself together long enough to drop one delicate kiss upon Tony’s lips.
Perfect, Tony thought, struggling to keep his face calm. “Lovely, glad to hear it. Sorry, you kinda crashed a party here, this isn’t really a good time to catch up.”
And so he took a deep breath and teased right back. “Oh, something tells me you already want me in your pants,” Steve said, dropping his voice low and directing a pointed gaze to the bulge visible at Tony’s groin. Unexpectedly, Tony blushed.
T’Challa smiled slightly. “I believe my people can find a way to help free you of this control. Although you should know, Stark believes the same of his people.”
A second later, Steve had gathered Tony to his side, concealing him from view as best he could, even as the man began to shake in earnest, even as he knew it was too late.
Steve met Stark’s gaze. “Sounds fair,” he said, proud when his voice came out even and cool. “But next time...” He tapped at his earpiece, and Stark at least had the grace to look sheepish. “What have you got?” Steve asked, glancing into the cauldron. There was a shallow pool of liquid twisting oddly within it, but the reflection on the liquid’s surface was of a night sky with…
“That’s because she didn’t bloody know,” the Soul Stone announced as she reappeared, Peggy’s frown peering down at him. “Bless your luck. I thought we would have to leave without you.”
“Good,” Steve said, then looked towards their next problem. Tony followed his gaze, his tension evident. Steve hesitated. “You don’t have to come with me.” The billionaire flicked a glance back at him, a quirk of his lips showing his displeasure at that idea. Oops. Steve spread his hands in surrender. “Just throwing it out there.”
“Okay, so here’s the rules,” Dr Palmer announced, producing an extra pair of gloves for Steve. “Hand contact only. The second you touch anything else but the air, you exit and re-sterilize. Your suit isn’t fully airtight, so you still need to keep your distance. And again, if you need to sneeze, get the hell out of the room first.”
, in Steve’s life had prepared him for the revelation of Tony’s hand on his cock. He groaned helplessly, the pleasure spinning towards unbearable. Tony kissed his cheek, then leaned back, watching his face. Steve could only stare up at him, panting slightly as Tony’s fingers trailed his length, root to tip; he sobbed a curse, launched beyond all dignity, as Tony’s thumb brushed over the head. Tony made a pleased humming sound, then leaned in to suck hard at Steve’s neck, one hand tangled in his hair, the other working his cock in quick, inexorable rhythm.
As it happened, Steve himself could physically sleep no more than four hours in a given day, but getting up early and disturbing Tony’s rest was not an option. At first he’d felt guilty for shirking his duty and requested a portable Wakandan device from which he could check a few things, but soon he’d found himself sleeping less and less and working more and more. After a scolding from Tony that included seventeen uses of the phrase ‘self-care’, Steve had agreed to set work aside and instead use the extra hour to relax and recharge. Twenty days after Tony’s return, he’d asked the Queen for a sketchbook and a holo-reel of Wakandan flowers; he looked forward now to the quiet dark of the mornings, drawing small delicate blossoms with Tony snoring softly at his side.
Yet while Thanos was distracted, the small girl had stepped around him and now ran to them, easily evading the Mad Titan’s grab. “Please, stop him,” she said. “I think I tried to stop him, but I couldn’t. You have to stop him now.”
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Tony said, then nodded to their shared Gauntlet. “But maybe we can make this situation a little more comfortable?”
out into orbit to test their recent modifications. Rocket offered to accompany her but the android rebuffed him and stalked out alone in her customary abrupt way. Instead, Thor invited the raccoon to join him on an excursion, something about Norway. After checking in with Tony, Rhodey offered to pilot for the two off-worlders; he’d always wanted to see the Northern Lights but had never found the time. Surprisingly, given his dislike of planes, Bruce chose to accompany them. Although maybe Tony shouldn’t have been surprised. He and Thor had forged a strong connection during their time in space, and were rarely found far from each other these days.
A straw was placed at his lips, and Steve drank, grateful. Then he registered the familiar stench of sterilized illness; with a sickened lurch, his vision cleared, and he saw. Small room, no windows. There were machines, tubes, needles. Beeping.
Tony thought, a sudden blast of golden joy enveloping him. “Did you just confuse Katniss and Captain
When Steve Rogers awoke, he found himself lying in a shallow pool so still it was like a mirror of stars, Vormir’s holy mountain a mere smudge on the horizon.
Somehow, the tired acceptance in Steve’s voice hurt more than anything. “Kinda feels like it is, though.”
Thanos glanced at Gamora, then looked up at the Soul Stone. “My life has no further purpose. It may yet have value. Please,” he said. “If you can. Let her life be restored. Take mine, for the balance.”
Clearly Tony could too. “I have some phone calls to make,” the other man said, eyes colder than any ice. And with that, he disappeared up a distant flight of stairs.
Tony was too far gone to notice when Peter dragged Thor out of the room, jaw set in wild determination.
The early afternoon sun was high above them as they set off, and the warmth already baked into the ground rose to greet them as they walked. After only a few minutes, Tony surrendered to the heat and stripped down to his tank top, and a minute later, Steve did the same. For a while Tony may have been a tad distracted - hello
Tony sprang out of the bed, cursing his earlier self for kicking off his shoes, stuffing a foot into the first soft sneaker he found while hopping towards the door, scrambling and-
, a familiar sneering voice told him, inspiring such a deep flash of self-loathing that his whole body shuddered to a halt mid-sob.
A sweeping exhaustion came over Tony, draining him right to his bones, because he could already feel how the evening was going to go, and by the morning it wouldn’t really matter anyway. And so he didn’t protest as Tiberius seized his wrist again and dragged him over to the car, because there would be no point. It didn’t matter, none of this mattered. If the world ended, nothing ever would.
for a second. He himself had been blindfolded during the ordeal; Ty had ordered Steve’s double not to speak, then bathed the other man in his own cologne to fool Tony’s senses. The tycoon must have also slipped him something heavier than usual, because Tony’s memory had been confused upon waking, fragments jumbled into each other. But he remembered screaming his safeword. He remembered Ty’s eerie silence. And the pain.
Wind over rocks, Tony thought. Empty. Then he shook his head, turned to Steve. “I want to go with her,” he whispered.
Fury rose in Steve, a bitter seething mass of loss and rage and loneliness, because he had believed. Even though Steve had known better, Tony had made him
Judging by his shrug, the kid did not, and Tony considered that a fitting end to the press conference. “Well then, I guess that’s all, folks.” He ignored the sighs of frustration, adopting a cheerily bored air. “Please make your way to the snack table, take a little break, maybe a power nap and we’ll be back shortly to hit the big red button. Wait, do we have a big red button?”
It took five full days to complete their preparations, but in the end, the battle was over before it could really begin.
“Is something going on?” he asks, leaning forwards now, concerned. “You know you can talk to me about anything, Peter. I’m always here for when you need me.”
Tony’s still confused. “Not sure what you’re getting at,” he informs him before asking, worriedly, “Are we breaking up or something?”
“Stitches aren’t exactly on the same league of cardiac arrest, Steve,” Bruce informs him, “Which is entirely in the realm of possibility, considering the stress that a panic attack can inflict on a person with a heart as bad as his. You got him to calm down without pushing him too far, and I appreciate it.”
Peter shrugs. “I guess. But Tony’s in Malibu, so it’s not exactly like he’s gonna come running in any minute like you’re worried he’s gonna.” Peter doesn’t make eye contact with Steve, but the veteran can plainly see the sadness that’s intermingled with the anger in the depths of Peter’s eyes. “So, relax, Mr. Rogers, you can still avoid him.”
Tony swallows dryly and forces a laugh, ending the moment suddenly, nattering about how good of a joke that just was that Steve’s just told, all the while avoiding making eye contact with Steve, who can only feel relief that the terse moment is now over, though he feels a powerful sense of regret that he can’t really explain but doesn’t have a moment to truly focus on, really, because before he can consider what’s just happened Peter comes bounding out, chanting that his homework’s done now so there’s no excuse that Steve can’t play, effectively casting the moment into the unspoken past as he grabs Steve by the hand, pulling the man back into the house. Tony laughs with Peter, looking anywhere else but at Steve, responding that maybe he’ll join in on a race or two himself.
Steve doesn’t let himself think about it, though. He may be selfish, but self-pity? It’s never been his thing. He doesn’t sit around and mope about the negative, which he knows his life has seen a lot of, because he sees no point in relishing in misery about how he wants things to be, it’s a waste of time for both himself and others. Buck had taught him that. In fact, Bucky’d been so good at teaching him this lesson that Steve doesn’t even let himself be miserable about Bucky all too much. He may search, but he doesn’t let the lack of result distract him. There’s far more things he needs accomplished, after all; he’s Captain America, and the Avengers need their Captain’s head where it belongs: focused on the objective.
to pretend that you care about him more than you do and have the gall to give him advice on the right thing to do when you spend every day not doing it yourself,” Clint responds, his fists clenched tight, as if he’s thinking about taking a swing at him, which Steve knows he actually is, “You have this belief that you’re justified in everything you do, and it’s shitty, it’s absolutely shitty.”
“You followed me?” he asks, or at least tries to, his vocal chords don’t seem to want to work right and all that escapes is ‘oo fommod eeh?’ which is, in Peter’s eyes, close enough an approximation, because he responds,
Peter frowns before ducking his head against his chest. “It’s… nothing,” he mumbles low, playing with the remote still in his hands. A definite change in attitude, and none for the better—something is wrong, Steve can tell.
is the result of a super-soldier under the effects of arousal, so he’s more proud than he is annoyed of the sorry state of his sheets, because
Tony’s flexible when it comes to sex, not really caring if he’s top or bottom or what’s he asked to do or have done to him, but he can’t help but feel a thrill of excitement when Steve asks him if, this first time, Tony can lead the way, allowing the smaller man to turn them so that Steve’s now on his back, uncertainty radiating through the arousal, breath catching audibly in his throat as Tony carefully touches him, his palms running slowly down the contours of Steve’s torso.
“Very much so,” whispers Steve, moving in closer so that his face is only mere inches away, “So don’t be surprised if he forces you to stay in bed all day today. You were running a temperature, of all things. He was going to Vaporub you within an inch of your life for being a tad bit warm.”
Tony winces in response. “No. Not at that point. You’re all clear on that front, Steve-o.” He breaks eye contact, looking down at the photograph as he bites his lip, tapping the face of the possible James Buchanan Barnes pictured within with his index finger, rhythm sharp and quick, tap after tap after tap, and Steve notices how this time, Tony doesn’t exactly deny having lied about being okay, though he hasn’t confirmed it.
Before Steve can begin to formulate a question, Peter tosses the remote into Steve’s lap, sliding off the couch with the blanket still around him tight, the only thing showing to indicate that he actually has a form underneath the fabric being the bare feet on the thick carpeting of Steve’s apartment. Peter’s not too big of a kid, but somehow, he looks even smaller now, what with that blanket around him, but the expression on his fact is far older than the rest of him.
“And of shit, too, apparently,” Steve responds instantly, crossing his arms and leaning forwards. He doesn’t curse too much, so he’s unsurprised when Tony’s eyes widen in response to it; he merely arches a brow at the man and demands to know what’s wrong, because the last thing he wants to witness is another panic attack.
“I think I’d be the surgeon, personally, seeing as I’m the one with the actual doctorates,” Tony argues, “But I digress.”
Pepper goes missing from their watch none too longer after he makes contact with Clint, which almost drives Steve out into the fray, but the moment he thinks about it, Peter pops into his mind almost instantly, reminding him that he has another responsibility other than to his team now. Peter depends him, needs him
Rhodey coughs dryly. “I don’t imagine Steve to be the kind to get mad over something like that,” he says, “and besides, have you two even been a thing long enough to have sex?”
Tony is quiet for a moment before he gives a small laugh, which is more parts relieved than it is amused. “That’s amendable of you, Steve.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Clint give Tony an incredulous look, but Steve just laughs. “It’d be more correct to say that I can’t stand to see you pout,” he says.
Steve blushes, though with his dilated pupils, the embarrassment can’t outshine his hunger, not bothering to respond with words as he presses a forceful, sloppy kiss against Tony’s mouth, saliva dripping down their chins as his tongue forces its way into Tony’s more-than-accepting mouth, letting Steve press him back into the pillows as he stretches out his body atop of his own, the feel of the scratchy line of pubic hair pressing against his own stomach making him tremble in anticipation. He opens up his legs for him, allowing the soft cloth of sweatpants to press against his naked, aching cock, wrenching a groan from him. His fingers find their way back into Steve’s hair as the man attacks his collarbone, nipping and licking and kissing and sucking at the skin into flowering bruises, Steve’s hands pressing down on his hips, a tacky string of pre-cum connecting the head of his cock to Steve’s hard abdomen, and he’d be embarrassed if it weren’t for the fact that he’s kind of turned on by the denial, letting out a whine that’s equal parts for show as it is for actual frustration.
“Only that, you know… you kind of wanna fuck Tony until he cums so hard he passes out,” Clint says with a cheeky grin that Steve doesn’t even need to
“It’s adorable,” Tony agrees with a fond smile, “Utterly adorable.” He looks over at Steve, who’s looking at him with a look that Tony can’t entirely interpret other than its contrast to the smile that’s slowly slipping from his lips. It’s mildly discomforting, and wholly worrying, so he turns fully to the other man, unsure of what to do about it.
“Honey bear, this is all surface-layer,” Clint responds with a laugh, “You’re so evident that I could cry.”
Steve glares at him, having caught the jar but is a bit annoyed that he’d dropped it in the first place, and says, “Something else is bothering him, though—
“C’mon, Mr. Rogerrrrrrs,” Peter drawls as he hangs off of Steve’s right arm after the man announces that he’s bidding them a goodnight, “Stay for dinner at least!”
And so he’s going to deflect, he honestly is going to, but Peter whispers in the most broken voice he’d heard anyone use yet, “I wanna know the truth, Steve,” and suddenly Steve just
He can’t help but think, in moments like these, about his Aunt Pegs, about her stories of Captain America, the ones he could never quite reconcile to be true because unlike his dad’s, which was all about the feats and triumphs of the great war hero, his godmother’s speak of an awkward kid with his foot perpetually in his mouth, who kind of
right now, with Steve’s hand massaging his balls and Steve’s mouth working his shaft, and he has to close his eyes because if he has to see that
He can’t help but parrot right back the word, “Protocol?”, not as so much confused as he is amused now, because he can’t help but imagine them drafting a battle plan for sex. It’s a bit hotter than he’d like to admit, mostly because he can’t help but imagine it as some sort of foreplay (more accurately, Steve whispering all the dirty things he was going to do to him with his hands strapped above his head,
Steve blushes slightly. “Sorry,” he responds with a soft chuckle, rubbing the back of his neck, “I was caught up in what I was doing.
friends.” Before Steve can even think to be offended, Peter continues, “Tony and Clint are friends. Bruce and Tony; friends. Uncle Rhodey and Tony—best friends.” He licks his lips—a small display of the nervousness Steve hasn’t even been aware that Peter’s been feeling—before continuing, “But anyone can look and see that you guys are way past friendship.”
Tony sighs shakily, still unsettled from Rhodey telling him he’s done wrong, but nowhere near about to freak out like he could’ve. “You say it like it’s easy,” he says.
Steve is not as familiar with Tony’s anxiety as other members of the team are, not like the likes of Bruce or even Natasha, and he’s not really even sure he can even fully grasp what it is that triggers this resultant in Tony, but he knows that whatever it is that’s formed this within Tony, whatever factors they may be, it’s unjustified that it hurts Tony in such a way. He may have had his misgivings before about Tony, when they had met before in the helicarrier workshop laboratory that he had overtaken all that while ago, but he knows better now; knows he judged him far harsher than the man had ever deserved—and he also knows that Tony’s faced that judgement from far more than just himself for far longer than Steve can allow himself to think of.
That’s what he thinks, anyways. What he so desperately believes. What so heartbreakingly gets ripped from him a little over three years later in a deserted Hydra chamber deep in Siberia, watching Steve take the side of his mother’s murderer, his eyes regretful but not remorseful as he tosses the shield down at Tony’s feet before turning his back to him, wrapping his arms around the man who killed his parents all those years ago, leaving Tony alone in the cold, his suit in tatters.
The way the t-shirt that obviously isn’t his seems to stretch over his muscles, how it doesn’t hide the scars on his arms from both work and anxiety, how he moves ever closer despite how terrified he is, and how a man who’s so afraid of the worst outcome in any situation needs no convincing to chase this, iron-clad in his decision as he says,
“Literally everyone,” says Peter, ignoring Steve before adding with a shrug, “’Cept for Tony, but he’s kind of oblivious with things like this, so it’s forgivable. But it’s almost kinda funny, though, Mr. Rogers, because you do
Tony looks back towards the school. “I’m going to tell Peter about the Parkers,” he says as the door opens, revealing the smiling Peter, who almost immediately begins to run towards them when he spots them, “And I’m going to hope for the goddamn best, I guess.”
Tony is gentle when he guides himself into the heat that is the inside of Steve, moving slowly into him despite the desire he’s barely suppressing to just plunge in one go; his hands pressing into Steve’s hips as his head rolls back in ecstasy. He’s sure his fingers are ripping into Steve’s skin, just as he’s sure the hands Steve’s probably not even fully aware he has on his ass are going to leave more bruises, but he minds neither as he bottoms out, fully seated within him and wanting to cry from the sheer magnitude of it all, dimly aware of the surprise he feels that he doesn’t immediately just lose it right then and there. He can’t help but feel sudden pride when he finds himself able to pull out almost all the way before snapping back in, his thrusts accentuated by Steve’s cries, because it’s
Clint’s reading through the messages when Steve gets back from dropping Peter off at school (a ride during which the boy makes no mention to last night’s hiccup and simply asks if they can make pizza tonight, which means Steve’s armed to the gills with the groceries necessary to make a multitude of it), feet propped up on the arm of Steve’s sofa as he lays on the air mattress that Steve has yet to deflate. Steve rolls his eyes in response, though he knows he’s actively fighting the need to blush, carrying the bags over to his decently sized open-space kitchen in order to sort them into their proper homes. Apples into the bowls, crumble mixture into the cupboard, flour bag opened and contents dumped into an easy-use container—Steve’s highly domesticated. His Ma would be proud.
. It was a long time ago. We were just stupid kids and I was just worried she was gonna realize that she was a better dame than what I deserved. I was still the skinny kid with asthma,” he explains, biting his lip and looking
Instead of letting Clint know he’s getting to him, he asks him, half-curious, when he got back from his mission. He’s supposed to have been gone for three weeks, but instead he’s here, reading through his messages like the nosy bastard he is.
that Tony finds himself struggling to catch on to these little moments that Peter allows him to experience.
There’s a tension between them that’s almost aching in its intensity, and it feels like far too long before Tony sighs, rubbing the bridge of his nose as he looks down at his lap, mouth contorting into that grimace of a smile he had for when he felt something far too deeply for him to even be remotely able to express it. He’s entirely uneasy, and it’s damned near palpable.
“Damn near spotless,” he agrees, “Glad you see things my way, Rogers. Glad to know you’re a man of sensibility and propriety.”
(Tony doesn’t even give him a glance, much less actually acknowledge he’s said something. The quiet unnerves Steve.)
, and he just can’t take it anymore, he decides, grabbing at the arc reactor with shaking hands, twisting it in his chest to get it to release.
“For, you know… singing to me. When I was freaking out?” Tony said, arching a brow, nervousness leaking through before he looked away. “Look, Steve, I’m not repeating myself. I’ve got a reputation to uphold as the cool and callous genius playboy billionaire. Imagine if the press got ahold of information that I extended gratitude for something? They’d have a fucking field day.”
, occasionally joining in with Clint in his endeavor to shit-talk the movie, the smile back on his face, altered only by the cream smeared in his goatee.
As for Peter's last remarks, please remember that Peter is a teenager, a teenager who is forced to go through such an ordeal with no kindnesses upon him. How else must he feel, in the heat of the moment? I have been angry with my own parents, sworn to hate them, and then go back to loving them the very next day. We all have. And, while this may be an extreme, admittedly, it is still this reaction."
And it’s completely not fair, how beautiful he finds Tony to be in this moment despite himself, from the way the lights of the city stream through the window to hit the left side of his face the way it is, the five-plus day’s growth on his goatee giving him a humbling appearance, the way his mouth contorts as he continues with his statement,
Steve shifts a bit, obviously embarrassed. “I’m not an idiot,” Steve mumbles almost to himself, “And I’m not as innocent as you’d all like to make me out to be. I know
(In the back of his mind, he stutters when he realizes that he’s truly in love with Tony, but he refuses to allow himself to think about it.)
“I’ll have you know that I’m nothing but sheer perfection when I pout,” Tony says, “The embodiment of America’s truest sexual desires.”
The end of it all. The resolution of the tale, told in 10 pages of text - the happy ending we've all been waiting for.
Thank you soooooo much to EVERYONE for reading! I hope you've all enjoyed the story as much as I enjoyed writing it! You know, originally, this was SUPPOSED to be the immediate sequel to the first tale; the other story kinda snuck up on me as a plot bunny and happened to be done first :3 but out of the three, despite the terrible, cliched ending I've delivered, this has been probably my absolute FAVORITE to write (especially since the Peter tale is turning out to be a complete and utter BITCH). I've got an epilogue-y type thing already typed out and waiting for editing (ps- it's got badly written porn, EEEEEEEEE) and I'll post it once I've gotten Peter's story done a bit more. Planning on writing a Clint story to explain his characterization fully in this tale (to explain why he's not in the mood for Steve's bullshit) but we'll see what happens! ANYWAYS!
Steve’s shaking his head before Tony even finishes the statement, but Tony’s already arguing with him—because how dare Steve say that he doesn’t need Tony? How dare he think that he can just admit something as deep as love, actual love, and not expect a soul to reciprocate, especially the objects of his love? How dare Steve ever stipulate that Tony didn’t need him like he needs air to breathe?  How dare Steve actually have the gall to think that Tony can’t love him, too?
Steve sighed, slowly, before saying, “You’re right,” and he’ll be damned if that resulting flinch of Tony’s doesn’t hurt before he continues, “They should be his world, if all was fair and just in the world like you constantly remind me it isn’t. If whomever it was hadn’t interfered with Peter’s life, then they would be. But that’s already happened, Tony, and there’s no way to turn back the clock and stop it from happening. But that doesn’t mean that you being Peter’s father is wrong because of it. If anything, in my eyes, Peter needs you far more because of it, because while he’s lost all this time with the family he’s never even been aware he’s possessed, he found his way to you, a man who not only found his family, but goes out of his way to let him know that he’s even got one to look towards every single day.” Steve looks past Tony now. “They’re his blood, but you’re his family, Tony, and if I know Peter the way I think I do, that’s all that’s going to ever matter to him.”
Thank you to all that have reviewed (though a lot of it is Steve-bashing after the last story). A small story's going to follow this one before Peter's solo, which I STILL haven't finished because of the same complication but I'm getting there. Hopefully I'll write a few more shorts before Peter's story is uploaded. I might upload the shorts as their own series within this one, and will probably do the same with Peter's story, but we'll see what happens when it comes down to it. I just can't believe it's only been seven months since I started this series ^.^
So, Steve tucked the phone into the single pocket on his shorts and closed his eyes, taking in a huge breath. He only had to channel a little bit of energy into his super soldier self. When he re-awoke, he was a raging fire. He lunged at Clint, who immediately rolled out his way, over about 10 feet, and skillfully launched an arrow right at Steve's head. In response, Steve grabbed the piece of fiberglass that was holding the bow and arrows Clint now had, holding it up like a shield.
Bruce waved his hand in front of Tony. "It's okay, Tony. I'll be okay…" he took in a deep breath as he shifted to a kneeling position, "for right now."
, is actually a highly trained hand-to-hand combat assassin. The chemistry teacher has been working in the chemical engineering department of SHIELD for over ten years now, helping in weapons development alongside Stark, so he knows how important Rogers is to keep safe."
"You're asking the wrong person," Clint responded, laughing, "I just fall in love with her every single time she speaks Russian fluently. I could care less if her English has an accent."
" The monster growled. Bruce's eyes gleamed with sorrow behind the green, enraged eyes. Only for a second, Steve felt like he should listen to Bruce's monster, but his soldier subconscious decided otherwise.
"Alright, kids," the gym teacher boomed, "we have a new student. Everyone say hi to Mr. Steve Rogers."
"It's no use," Tony sobbed, his voice hitching with uneven breaths. He and Steve both stared helplessly into the room, only to see Bruce's horrified face. Out of anger for his helplessness, Steve slammed the extinguisher against the door one more time. The wake of the force of the super soldier's impact ruptured a pipe, releasing a cloudy gas into the entire lab room. It was almost impossible to see anything.
"Good morning," Steve said, grimacing. He was wondering how long it would take before Tony realized what happened to his lab...
"What? Don't look at me like that," Clint glared right back at them, "I was planning on going to practice a bit at the range later." He left, returning through the front door with a large bow and a quiver of high-quality arrows already on his back. He swung the lab door open and bolted down the stairs.
Yet Steve froze, suddenly unsure whether his apology would even be welcome. “Tony, are you- I mean, is there anything-” he tried to begin, his own voice cracking in a way he hadn’t heard in years.
He sighed and quit punishing the reinforced punch-bag. The Queen had requested his presence in her private lab, if he could spare the downtime, and Steve was happy to oblige. The pleasant ache of fatigue in his muscles was already fading as he took a quick shower. Dammit. It was a sign he needed more vigorous exercise than he’d been getting lately, and he made a mental note to ask Thor to spar with him tomorrow. The Asgardian’s usually ebullient self was still much reduced, but he might agree to the challenge. He’d ask Clint, if not. The loss of his family had stripped everything from the archer except an inexorable thirst for revenge; until the team’s intervention a couple weeks in, he’d been running himself into the ground with twenty-hour shifts while volunteering on the hottest missions. Steve worried about him the most, but he had no solutions beyond what they were already doing.
Thanos opened his eyes at their approach, a distorted grin spreading across his face. “…Stark? Is that you?”
According to Thor’s greasy brother, Thanos wanted to collect all six Stones so he could wipe out half of all life in the universe, which was almost impressively stupid as evil plans went. Now that Thanos had taken the Power Stone from Xandar, he was already one of the most powerful beings in the universe. If he managed to acquire Earth’s three Stones, he would be unstoppable.
“Right,” Tony agreed. He sat up, hesitantly meeting Steve’s gaze. “I can’t… say what you said, Steve, I- I’m not there yet, or maybe I’m just not capable anymore, I don’t know. But what I can say is that I’m sorry. And if I could take it back, I would.”
and testing the technology’s limits. Granted, Rocket had made some digs about how no one in space would ever think to use such primitive technology and that’s why it was so effective, but after Okoye introduced him to the business end of her spear, his apology to the young Queen had sounded adequately sincere. Shuri had just rolled her eyes and told him to have some manners or she’d personally show him where they kept the trash. Steve’s ears had caught the raccoon muttering something snarky about pandas, but the Queen’s rebuke did manage to shut him up. At least for a few days.
On their way out, Steve's enhanced ears picked up Thor’s booming voice greeting Clint and Bruce. The two scavengers had returned triumphant, Clint bearing armfuls of snacks, Bruce with a full tray of coffee and sandwiches, which they set on a table a the far end of the room.
“I’ve been better,” Steve admitted. “How long was I-?” His voice failed and he coughed to clear his throat; this triggered a full hacking spasm which should have set his entire torso ablaze in agony, but instead Steve felt just an odd straining pressure across his chest.
“But Barnes needed you,” Tony finished, the sharp edges of that awful week finally sliding into coherent alignment. He’d always pinpointed that conversation as the moment his Avengers dream had died; there in that room, he’d tasted victory within his grasp, had come so close to keeping Steve with him, to keeping their misfit family intact. Steve’s sudden recoil had felt personal, but Tony had never quite understood what he’d done to provoke the turnaround.
Steve froze in place, dropping his shield to the ground; he turned to face Tony, his hands outstretched in surrender, in apology.
Of course, seconds later the door was opening and Stark was bustling in at full throttle, firing out apologies that may even have been sincere, attributing his unavoidable delay to his efforts to secure international support for the new Asgardian settlement. Which, as excuses went, was fairly solid, Steve grudgingly supposed. Stark’s cheerful explanation washed away the worst of the room’s frustration, enough so that the briefing could get underway.
“Please, tell me what happened after you came back, Tony. What changed?” Nat asked, her gentleness unbearable, cutting him to the core.
“You’re just saying that because you love me,” he whispered, the idea still fragile, questions lurking behind the words.
Without speaking, Tony surged forward, pouring himself into Steve’s warm embrace. As the other man held him tight, Tony’s mind slowly returned towards calm, towards reason.
Tony could see the war between denial and necessity play out on Wanda’s face, her eyes filling with unshed tears. Red sparks danced over her fingers, hinting at the power she held so precariously in check. Yet when Vision reached for her hand, the red light faded, and the young Avenger sat up straight. She nodded, signaling her acceptance. But then she cast a glare towards Tony, her eyes smoldering with a loathing second only to the reproach on Barton and Romanoffs’ faces.
A low ping in Tony’s ear nearly made him leap out of his skin. “Analysis complete, boss,” Friday said. Of course, the mission.
“So you left again.” Everything about the past two years was making a new, horrible, upside-down sense. “And you never really came back.”
“Everything,” Thanos moaned, sounding defeated. “You’re… right, Stark. You’re right.” For a moment, everyone held their breath. Then the Mad Titan twisted his lips into a grin. “I should have done more.”
“Do keep up,” she said, and it was so perfectly Peggy that Steve laughed for the first time in what felt like centuries, the Captain retreating in confusion. The Soul Stone smirked at him, then scrutinized the two of them. “I must apologize for the rough ride. Up until the end I doubted if I could get you both here safely, but you held fast. I’m so proud of you boys.”
After much discussion, the eventual Rogers-led consensus was that Thanos had to be eliminated, and Earth had made itself the obvious battleground.
The other man leaned back in his chair. “Wow,” he drawled, voice dripping with derision. Steve’s stomach lurched. “How very
Ty squealed in pain, then sagged against the wall, only Steve’s firm grip on his arm keeping him upright. “I also wanted to make something
but as the sting in his arm sends him under, the last thing he hears is Steve whispering in his ear, “it’s okay, Tony, it’s okay, she’s found a way to help you, you’re gonna be okay…”
Tony gave him a serious look, slightly misty-eyed. “Cap, wow. I mean, language.” Then he smirked, but somehow that made Steve panic because he had to help Tony, he had to protect him but he couldn’t tell if the other man believed him or whether Tony was just hiding his pain again and Steve had no way of
Yet whatever Ty was planning, he realized, soon it wouldn’t be Tony’s problem. Soon, he would be… A giddy determination rose up through him; he turned to Steve. “I’m ready.”
Wrenching his eyes away from Steve, Red Skull looked them over, seemingly unimpressed. “Yes, I met him.” Tony felt his heart leap in anticipation. Perhaps the old Nazi knew something. Perhaps he could help.
The lake is so beautiful in the morning light. He hadn’t noticed, last time. He hides the quantum stopwatch in his pocket and waits to be noticed.
Steve was frowning again, and Tony rushed to explain. “I know it’s not much of a plan, there’s still so much work to do to figure out our next steps but it means there’s a solution, Steve, there’s a way to do this, all
Steve’s eyes fluttered open, a dazed look settling over him. “Hi,” he breathed, and then he was crying just like Tony was, their tears sliding free in sorrow and joy combined. Recklessly,
“I don’t think relieved is the right word for this feeling,” Pepper said. “That makes it sound like loving you was a duty. It never was that, Tony.” She hesitated. “But there is a certain comfort in knowing it’s over.” She pierced him with a stare, steel always, under the sunshine. “Maybe because I’m not that surprised. You and Steve… I’ve always felt there was something pulling you away. I thought it was the job you couldn’t quit. But now...”
She raised her eyebrows. “What card?” But she hugged them both so tight it could have been attempted murder.
The doctor’s back was turned so he didn’t see. But Steve saw. The horrified tension in Tony’s whole body. The way Tony’s expression slipped, for one haunting moment, into pure panic.
Steve slowly put down his sketchbook and turned to him, a pained expression on his face. “We never talked about it.” True, but in Tony’s mind there just hadn’t been any point, after the Devastation. The past was what it was. The present was an anomaly, soon to be erased. A dream of a different future was all any of them had left.
She stared at him, then scrubbed at her eyes. “Of course you would know that,” she muttered, and yes, those were tears threatening to spill.
“Um, and I brought you a sandwich, Mr Stark, in case you’re hungry,” he heard Peter add. “Sorry if you don’t like falafel, it was the only one left.” Judging by its appearance, that was for good reason, but Tony realized he was hungry enough to eat it anyway.
“Warm ‘n’ fuzzy?” “Tingly?” “Special?” “Horny?” “Tall?” Everyone tried to finish his sentence at the same time, then cracked up at each other’s answers.
“You’re late, Cap,” he says but even as he’s pushing out a chair with his foot Tony’s blood is running cold because something is wrong, something in the way Rogers is standing is all wrong and his hair is wrong and
On the plane, Shuri was cutting through a forest of scrolling numbers. She looked up as they entered, mouth furious. “I’ve double-checked the data but there is no oversight, no malfunction. Just no sign of a ship until suddenly, boom! There they are. If they have stealth tech, we cannot track it.”
“That’s the one.” Tony sighed. “He should never have been on that ship. Anyway. We freed the wizard, then we could have headed home but… I thought it would be better to keep going. Keep the fight away from Earth, maybe get the jump on Thanos. It was my call. I just wish… Whatever, it’s done now.”
“But it’s more than that,” Nat said, frowning over in Steve’s direction. “He’s brushing off everything we say unless it’s about the mission.”
Steve nodded, then looked around. Thor had moved Thanos about fifty metres away, and apparently Clint was taking no more chances; the Mad Titan was now pinned with multiple arrows through his limbs as he slumped against a nearby tree. Steve waited for some part of him to protest the inhumane treatment of a dying prisoner, but apparently no such part was left. The arrow had at least given his body something to focus on, a channel for his excess energy, and he felt strangely relieved. With the outer signs of his wound was already closing, Steve struggled to his feet. Tony stepped in close to help, and stayed close.
Steve surprises himself by laughing. “I guess there’s no standard arrangement for ‘sorry you died saving the universe’.”
“Fuck you too, Romanoff,” Tony breathed, then enveloped her in a bear hug. She and Clint had been gone a full week this time, and he hadn’t gotten any better at not worrying.
Tony had woken up furious, ready to rip Ty apart, but the tycoon had been too well prepared, his ambush too cunning.
“I know,” he said. “You said you were gonna fix it. But I still don’t understand what ‘it’ is. Can you… could you take me through what happened, out there?”
“Well, actually, about that,” the Soul Stone said. “We have been forced to serve you thus far, yes, although we nearly destroyed your Gauntlet trying to resist. And yes, you did just place an order for the destruction of half the lives in the universe, but as you can see, I’ve pressed pause on its delivery for now.” She pointed above their heads, and Steve saw a patch of the sky above had cracked in some hideous way, was in fact still ripping itself apart in slow motion, like forked lightning slowed to an excruciating pace. “Thankfully, the situation has been complicated by these boys showing up with a Gauntlet of their own. Not even we can serve two masters at once. Competing claims requires mediation.”
But they all knew the answer, even before Red Skull confirmed it. “I am sorry for your loss.” Nebula turned away, the blue glow vanishing, and she crossed to the edge of the mountain, staring dully at nothing.
“Proximity alert, boss,” Friday announced in his forgotten ear-piece. “Seventeen ships, no approach detected. There is a 99% probability the Tesseract was involved.”
“He’s worried about you,” May countered, her voice sharpening. “I don’t think he ever expected the job at the Compound to mean never seeing you anymore. He thinks you’ll get in trouble without him.” She paused. “And maybe he’s right.”
“That’s fair,” Steve said, nodding. He took a slow steady breath of his own. The sky above them was turning an electric mix of purples and reds as the sun finally kissed the horizon. “Did you read my letter?” the super-soldier asked eventually. At Tony’s nod, he looked relieved. “I meant what I said, Tony. I would have come back if you’d called. The second you needed me.”
Steve’s whole body thrilled as Tony’s lips finally softened against his own, hope and fear soaring ecstatically through him, into him.
The media tycoon threw back his head and laughed, a grotesque sight on the giant screen. “No, my dear Captain, I’m a
, and sure, that was almost definitely just an affectionate expression of platonic relief that Tony had then ruined forever with his stupid tongue but… maybe not?
The central screen went blank, followed by every other screen in the room. “Behold, Captain, my gift for you,” Ty’s voice boomed. “May all the world see your
Tony kept his jaw stubbornly clamped shut. Since Steve so clearly didn’t want to think about that particular ramification, then Tony sure as hell wasn’t going to talk about it. Besides, it obviously didn’t mean what they thought it meant, what even Tony had thought it meant for one glorious, stupid second. Steve was the kind of radiant soul who would love a dog he’d just rescued from a tree. Didn’t make Tony special.
He only realized he’d said that out loud when Tony snorted, almost a laugh. “If I’m reading this machine right you just got your next dose of happy juice, so yeah, that tracks.”
“Already?” Steve answered, unable to keep the surprise out of his voice, and Tony snorted. “I mean, yes, understood, proceed to phase two.”
“I’m afraid your oxygen levels are still falling, Steve,” Helen said. “With your permission, we would like to put you on a ventilator to help you breathe.” She could barely meet Tony’s eyes.
know, Tony,” Steve snarled right back, hurling the words across the distance between them, “because I know
Besides, even if this new future insisted he no could longer fit where he had once belonged, telling Pepper about his day had always been Tony’s favorite part of coming home.
“I don’t-” Steve said, smiling because he didn’t know what Tony meant, he didn’t want to know what Tony meant, he didn’t-
Peter sleeps that night. Not well, but he does, hogging the covers on Steve’s bed because he refuses to be alone, using Steve’s right arm as a makeshift pillow, and for the third night in a row, Steve doesn’t sleep, but it’s not because of misery, for the first time in three nights—it’s because Peter is drooling all over his arm and his face is too adorable not to snap a quick photograph using the tablet, though it’s awkward when he only has his left hand to use, and he can’t help but smile although he’s an emotional wreck. He almost sends it to Tony, but he stops himself just in time.
Steve honestly doesn’t think Tony’s fears will come to fruition. He can see plainly how strong the bonds between them are, even though he’s never been great at figuring people out—that’s how blatant the two of them are, even worse than Bruce and Natasha, but ten times more adorable (and Bruce and Nat are cute, in a different way, admittedly, but the point still stands). Peter might be upset, yes, but he just can’t see Peter wanting to just leave Tony’s side and go with his aunt and uncle who,
allowing that!” she screams, and if it were a less serious moment, Steve would laugh at how she’s talking to Tony as if he’s nothing more than an uncooperative, misbehaving child.
“So I’m going to assume that ‘Go to bed before I come over there and use my old-man powers to force you to sleep’ is synonymous with ‘I want to fuck you into the mattress until you scream my name and cum so hard you pass out’,” Clint says cheerily.
There’s a bit of backlash to his statement, but Steve doesn’t pay it all too much mind, mostly because it’s the truth, what he’s said—any fight that they’re going to have with the Mandarin isn’t going to be one that the terrorist has any sort of chance of winning. Tony may be alive, but it didn’t make the crimes the man’s committed lessen, not when Steve’s got the days of Peter’s distress on his shoulders; not when he’s going to remember the sounds of Peter’s screams of anguish when the Malibu house goes up in an explosion of flames. He can only hope that they never find out who this person is—for his own sake more than their own, because he’s not entirely sure he’ll remember who he’s supposed to be when he’s choking the life out of him.
whose teeth gently graze at the sensitive skin of Tony’s sex every time he lifts his head. It’s sheer and utter heaven, it’s only downfall is that Steve’s sucking a bit
Steve’s confused. He’s still thinking about how warm Tony would feel against him. He got to experience a bit of it a couple of days before, but he hadn’t the moment to really consider the feeling.
Tony applies the brakes, the car rolling to a stop in a residential neighborhood in Forest Hills, pulling into the space meant for the fire hydrant, and he removes the key from the car, leaning back in his seat as he looks out his own side window, staring at the brick home that stands across the street from them, and Steve only grows more and more anxious in the wake of Tony’s lack of response, so he prepares to ask one more time before Tony says, quietly,
TELL THE LITTLE OLD LADY WHO LIVES IN YA BUILDING AND KEEPS CALLING YA SUSAN ALTHOUGH YA NAME IS NOWHERE NEAR SUSAN BUT IT'S OKAY BECAUSE SHE'S ADORBS AND GIVES YA DA BOMB CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES
his, and it’s not because Steve doesn’t want him to be—it’s because it’s not safe for Tony to be. He’s lost a lot of people—his pops, his Ma, Howard, Jim, Gabe, Monty, Jacques, Dum-Dum, Erskine, Phillips, Peggy,
Steve has to resist the urge to follow after him. It’s one of these times where Steve’s had enough experiences in the past when dealing with Bucky to know not to push Peter about something he didn’t want to talk about, although Peter wasn’t exactly about to show him the same courtesy just moments before. It’s just another facet of Peter that reminds him of Bucky—he somehow gets this persuasion that his own problem will just burden others, and therefore refuses to tell, only growing more and more frustrated and volatile the more he’s pushed towards expression. Sure, Bucky never actually hit him—and he doubts that Peter would even try, if put in the position—but it’s an argument he has no desire to push towards right now. He doesn't want to force Peter to talk if he doesn't want to, because he knows he'll eventually come out and say it on his own terms.
He just is afraid of losing Tony in the process is all. It’s actually the reason why he hasn’t confessed his feelings to Tony; the idea of losing him. It’s not the idea of rejection, it’s the fact that he’s been losing the people he dares to love for as long as he can recollect. His Ma, followed by Erskine, then Bucky, followed by Peggy—he’s recognized the pattern, and he’s utterly terrified of it. He’s even more terrified by the prospect of knowing that Tony reciprocates, because it’ll just hurt even more if the man is ripped away.
Okay. So. I haven't forgotten about this story (not by a long shot). I have this thing, a view-quota for my stories to hit to constitute an update, and since all of my stories were teetering around that x99 mark, I was waiting for one of them to push past the mark to hit another significant digit - which this one did, reaching just over a 1000 views THIS MORNING, and I've been so excited to post this all day though I'm sure y'all gonna hate it.
... and on comes the storm. Destructive is it as it runs its path through their broken but intricately woven lives, threatening the very fabric of their bonds with one another. But this is only but the beginning.
Tony’s waiting for him right outside of the door, the heat still not fully gone, but overshadowed with the agony he’s feeling. “Steve, I—”
, he’s so scared now, why did you have to do this, Tony, why did you have to put yourself in harm’s way like the selfless fucking bastard you are?
Steve smirks. “You placed it.” Not a question. He expects nothing less than that of Tony Stark, to be completely honest.
Steve frowns himself. “Do you want me to come to bed with you?” he asks in return, as if unsuspecting of such a turn of events, “I kind of assumed you’d like the day to yourself after all. Plus, you know…” he shrugs sheepishly, blushing a bit as he continues, “I didn’t think you wanted me in there.”
“G’night, Mr. Rogers,” Peter says, walking right past him out of the living room, feet padding nearly soundlessly against the floor as he makes his way to Steve’s bedroom.
Thank you all for your continued support of this story-- AHHHHH over 1000 views! 2 comments! Gawsh, I feel loved. I hope you guys find this chapter up to snuff--let me know what you think!
[It’s worth mentioning that, for all the acts of terror Steve’s laid upon Tony’s character through the five games, not once did either of them even try to get to first place; it’s an unspoken agreement that first is for Peter, who’s so busy laughing that he doesn’t even notice that neither man is trying to actually win the races.]
Peter moans and groans, but doesn’t really protest; he in fact runs off to get his homework and starts to work on it before the pizza arrives, sitting at the kitchen table with his notes scattered across its surface, a glass of iced tea sat atop his algebra notes and pizza grease dribbling across his notebook before Tony throws a paper towel roll at him. To keep him focused; they remove themselves from the living room and retreat out to the balcony, armed with the remaining pizza box, which is quickly demolished by way of Steve’s hunger due to expedient metabolic properties brought on by the serum.
Steve’s going through his latest finds, courtesy of Nat’s contacts and Sam’s efforts, blurry photographs and non-descript accounts scattered across the bare surface of the kitchen table of his personal suite, when Tony barges in. In the past, Tony just walking in whenever he wanted would drive Steve crazy, but he’s learned since that it’s not something Tony does intentionally; it’s a mere habit that’s come up after a childhood spent with his father doing the same thing to him, so Steve doesn’t even look up now when Tony just rushes in, his eyes still tracking across the pages as he looks for some hidden detail that can pinpoint Bucky’s exact pattern so he can better anticipate how the man’s mental state is faring.
Peter’s arms wrap around him tight, so tight that he nearly gets the breath knocked clean out of him, but he returns the embrace, confused until Peter whispers, “I think of you as a dad, too,” and all that Steve can possibly do is begin to cry—because what the hell else can he actually do?
“Tony, you’re Peter’s dad,” Steve says slowly, shaking his head, “And Peter loves you like it. You’re his world, Tony, and it shows.”
Tony looks back at him, searching Steve’s face with a careful precision none too unlike when he’s trying to figure out a problem with a program; as if he knows there’s some sort of answer to his unasked question hidden in the random hairs on Steve’s face, and while it’s the slightest bit discomforting, Steve doesn’t bend—he stares right back at Tony’s face, keeping his gaze on his electric blue eyes. They’re as blue as Dorothy’s dress, which is funny to Steve because the Iron Man suit is the exact same red as her ruby slippers, and the gold reminds him of the yellow brick road, but he doesn’t voice this aloud, because it’s silly and definitely
“Peter’s more than just a kid and you know it,” Steve argues, “He’s plenty strong. In fact, sometimes I’m pretty sure Peter’s actually stronger than the both of us put together. He’s sure as hell a bit smarter than we can be sometimes.”
, and Ben—he’s Peter’s paternal uncle, his father’s brother—he has a private investigator looking for the kid, Steve. Fifth one in ten
, fuck—right now before I tell our friends, wipe that look off your face,” he ends with a laugh, Steve himself cracking a grin, “Point is, there’s a lot to sort through and I’m too tired to right now, so I’m going to do myself a favor and just go back to bed. I need a rain check on today.”
“Don’t count your chickens yet. You never know when our resident demigod may appear. He does like his spontaneity and his, you know, magical lightning powers and luscious blond locks.”
It’s only when Tony stutters out a shocked “What?” that Steve realizes that, all the while, he’s been saying this out loud. Steve’s eyes go wide, and he turns to the other people of the room, trying to see if it was just his imagination, that it’s not the truth, but he can see it in the look in Peter’s eyes that he’s said it all. None of them look surprised, which Steve figures they wouldn’t be, but they are all worried—who they’re worried about, Steve’s not too sure, and he can’t focus on it, either. So he takes in a breath and turns back around, trying to regain the composure he doesn’t feel.
doesn’t know why, a month after he asked Steve how he feels, Peter’s now asking Tony the same question. “I mean, specifically,
Steve nods. “Okay, then,” he agrees, but confusingly enough, he stays right where he stands as Tony walks off towards the bedroom, watching Tony go as if he weren’t supposed to come with.
same thing.” Tony begins to shake his head—it’s a lie, it’s all just a lie, but Steve continues arguing, “I was so
“But on a serious note, thanks for keeping an eye on my little shitbag,” Tony says, still chipper, “I appreciate you making sure that my favorite little guy is still alive and breathing, and, as an additive bonus, all in one piece, too.”
He’s not sure when he started to, but he is, he’s humming a song, a song he remembers in its entirety despite not having heard it since he was fifteen years old—the very last time he can remember it being when he was down with the worst case of pneumonia he’d ever had, feeling her hand carding through sweaty, sticky hair and her cheek against his forehead. He can’t really hear all too well, the infection’s so bad that his ears feel like they’re being ripped apart from the inside, but he can feel the vibrations of her voice against his skin as she sings that familiar melody.
There are arms wrapped around him, arms that he’s sure are Steve’s, and he struggles against them blindly, not wanting to infect the goodness that is Steve Rogers with the plague he somehow internally manifests. He doesn’t want to touch Steve and ruin him. He doesn’t want to touch Steve and destroy him. He deserves better. He deserves far more than some broken little man like Tony. He deserves someone with light in their heart and belief in their soul, and Tony has neither. All he has is a dumb, misplaced sense of hope that consistently lets him down and reminds him just what kind of life he’s been living, what kind of life he will always be living. He’s been living a dream. A fantasy. The time has come, apparently, for him to wake the hell up—to face his reality. He’s as weak a man now as he was in the December of 1991. He’s a man incapable of protecting the ones he loves—his mother, his father, Anna, Jarvis, Aunt Peggy, Yinsen, Obie, Pepper—and it’s not a list he wants to add another name to, because he can’t bear to see the name
He avoids Tony for the next few days, not sure what to do about Tony’s statement now that it’s almost all but confirmed that Tony reciprocates at least some of his own feelings. He wants to be mad at Peter for pushing it, but really, he’s mad at himself—in some way, he knows he’s made Tony feel to be somehow inadequate in some way when it came to him, comparing himself to the ghost of Margaret Carter despite the fact that Steve’s feelings for her aren’t even in the same league as the ones he has for Tony. He hates that Tony’s still thinking of himself as, somehow,
And, probably too predictably, Peter’s having none of it. Probably, as Steve recollects this time later, it’s one of those things that makes him even more like Bucky; he had no patience for Steve’s bullshit avoidance policy either, which is the only reason he can attach to why, when after just about two weeks of avoiding Tony and Peter, the kid barges in his apartment with chin jut high in the air, the blanket in one hand and already in pajamas, which is only weird because it’s only two PM. He doesn’t even acknowledge Steve initially, instead, he walks right past the man as if he’s not even worthy of Peter’s gaze, flopping down on the couch into a boneless heap and tossing the remote at Steve as way of greeting, requesting Steve pick something tonight, because it’s
“I don’t doubt it,” Steve laughs, taking a sip of the [non-alcoholic] beer Tony supplied him with, “You seem like the kind of fella who needs things
“I don’t think you will, Tony,” Steve responds with a soft smile, sincerity in his tone. “I can’t force you to tell Peter, Tony. At the end of the day, it’s your choice.”
They take a break from their movie watching, mostly so Natasha and Clint can nurse the tequila bottle, but also because Bruce is trying to undo his hair from the neat but harshly tight braids Natasha’s done him up in, which Tony only half-heartedly begins to help him with before moving to sit up on the couch next to Steve, who for his own part is nursing a Corona whilst doing the blending of the value shades on the sketch he’d done of the four of them.
means that Peter goes home and leaves his space. Sure, it’s not like Peter’s gone far—he knows that—but it’s not like he can just check up on Peter in the middle of the night when he’s back with Tony.
Peter’s not a bad kid, and he’s also not the kind of kid who actually really needs to be given such rules. But Steve gets this idea that Peter thinks it’s adorable that Tony places these rules without even a second thought, so he lets Tony believe he’s more in control than he actually is. Peter adores Tony like any son adores his dad, and if there’s been anything over the past few months that have continued to surprise him, it’s just how much Peter and Tony love each other. In the grand scheme of things, Steve’s more than aware that they haven’t even known each other that long—maybe the better part of a year?—but there’s no dispute that Peter is Tony’s son, and Tony, Peter’s dad. It’s quickly evident that there’s very little Tony’s not willing to do for Peter, even at the cost of his own life, because he’s determined to make sure that Peter has far better a life than he did.
“Of course, I’m sure I could’ve done without having to deal with Barton for nearly two hours by myself, but I’ll get over it.”
“We look so pretty,” Tony croons over at Bruce. Bruce blushes, and Steve can’t help but smirk, beat-up blending stump between his fingers.
Steve’s heart threatens to stop right in his chest, but he refuses to let it. Refuses to let his hopes get up. It’ll only crush him if he does, in the end.
Dimly, he hears a familiar voice call out to him, and until Peter’s face fills his limiting vision, he believes it to be nothing more than an imagining, but no, no, it’s Peter, clad in nothing more than the goofy costume he’d forced him to design, sans his mask, which, if Tony’s iced-over nerve endings are to believe, inform him is being slipped over his head. Wiring Peter’s installed in the suit include thermal insulation, something Tony knows he’s in need of, and he also knows that, if Peter could strip himself down and give him the rest of the costume to wear, he would.
Tony laughs, but now that Steve’s listening, he can hear the edge in his tone as he says, “Peachy keen. Never better. I’m just full of sunshines and rainbows and unicorns.”
Peter, for his part, has a hand fisted into the material of Tony’s sweats, his mouth opened only slightly, his legs—skinny and long, bent and twisted together naturally; curled up in sleep, his face at ultimate peace as he cuddles his father. Peter’s not one naturally predisposed to displays of affection, and so it’s always heart-warming to see when he expresses such feelings towards his adoptive father. Quietly, he asks for JARVIS to get a shot of them together saved to his tablet before making his way silently towards the kitchen area.
So instead of asking if Clint knows what the problem is, he asks if he’s got an idea of what the problem could be.
himself in the position of greatness and didn’t know what else to do but lead as best as he can, who couldn’t dance and didn’t know what fondue was and couldn’t run very fast or do many pushups; someone who sounded more human than Tony could handle. Her stories are similar to the Steve he knows now, who eats a cheesecake like it’s otherwise going to expire in the next twenty seconds, who cuddles Peter whenever the boy wants despite the fact that he’s a bit too old to cuddle with a parent, who refuses to get medical treatment even when he’s been shot three times in the side because he’s afraid of needing stitches (for example), who has this way of awkward bopping his head to the beat of a good song—the Steve that Tony believes to be the most perfect being he’s ever met, who’s as strong and courageous and kind and as fierce as the man his dad used to describe. Everything his godmother and his father ever told him of made for a good man, who he loves with far too much of his being, the bits of his heart leftover from the majority Peter claims going straight to the big blond heroic doofus.
Despite the earlier hiccup, Steve enjoys himself immensely, so much so that, later, when he’s bid the pair adieu long after he should’ve, Steve finds himself trying to blend to the correct value of light bouncing off of Peter’s glasses, his hands covered with the graphite of various pencils and his kitchen table covered with the dirtied remains of erasers he’d haphazardly brushed off of the page of Bristol he has before him. He didn’t take a picture, and so now, he only has his memory to go off, which is not terrible, but it doesn’t create the truest image. He tries regardless, because it’s a moment that he needs to have in paper, and he can’t lose a bit of it. In the back of his mind, he considers a suggestion Tony made many a time to pick up photography, since Steve really likes capturing moments, and he really thinks about whether it’s an avenue he wishes to explore as he erases the glint off the left lens of Peter’s glasses—it’s not good enough, he decides.
“Oh, yes, definitely. We’re not people with time for anything less.” He takes a sip of his own drink—one of those ugly green drinks he’s got all the time, sitting back and allowing the seat to support his body weight, looking up at the peach-hued sky of the light-polluted city, shaking his head as the last of his laughter left his body. Steve misses the days that one could look towards the skies of this city and see the stars, but if he’s being honest, he’d give them up a thousand times over as long as he gets to see this look of wonder in Tony’s eyes as he looks up at the lights reflecting off of the sky above.
“So why now? Why’re you bringing it up today?” Steve asks, forcing down the idea of celibacy, picking up the remote and pausing
The tablet chimes before it displays that Tony’s responded, and with an eagerness he opens the message to see that Tony’s immediately jumped to the worst conclusion—that Peter’s dead and/or kidnapped and he’s probably going to hop into the suit that Steve knows full well that he’s brought with him despite hard orders from Pepper not to.
good chance, that Tony’s alive, and Peter nearly cries right then and there, though the makeup artist swats at his knee when the tears even chance it. Peter gives her a glare that it’s own threat, which she happily ignores because she’s more focused on giving on giving Peter the best contour he can have, which Steve doesn’t think is necessary but he can’t stop her from doing.
“Can I just say that I’m glad your words are coming back to you?” Steve says humorlessly. Tony laughs dryly regardless, and Steve’s sure it’s not to appease his feelings. In the corner of his eye, Steve sees Tony rub his right arm, elbow to wrist, drying blood flaking off, and Steve hears himself instructing Tony in a no-nonsense tone to wash and disinfect his arms, because he knows Natasha keeps a stash of peroxide and gauze above the sink in Tony’s bathroom after he ripped open his arm in a tired accident with a number seven drill bit, and Tony laughs again, though this time it’s slightly more heartfelt.
Tony laughs. “I welcome that idea, yes,” he agrees, looking over at Steve fondly, running a hand across Steve’s cheek to get the man to look at him, earning for himself a stupid, fucked-out grin from the blond that he just
“Peter thinks you are, so you shut up about that,” Tony says, smiling fondly over at him for a moment before his smile drops a bit. “I just want to make sure he’s at least a bit happy before I ruin everything.”
There’s questions being shouted at him—What are the Avengers doing to follow up the attack?—Is this a declaration of war upon the Avengers?—What will befall the Iron Man suits, and of the title of Iron Man?—Will Stark Industries continue to support the Avengers?—Who is the Mandarin?—and Steve can barely process them all. He doesn’t know which one to start answering, doesn’t know where he’s supposed to begin speaking, so he waits, patiently, with an unwavering look, for them all to quiet down enough so he can form some sort of semblance of clear thought.
Steve’s grinning when he says, “I love how he’s still at an age to put on his clothes wrong when he’s rushing.”
(PG-13, however, is his maximum. There’s certain things a kid of Peter’s age just doesn’t need to see.)
“Dad thinks so,” Peter whispers, eyes glued to the image of Bambi on the screen, “He thinks he did something.”
He’s not sure if his belief that their relationship was going to be ended was a belief that Steve hated him as so much as a desire
He’s overwarm, but he’s not exactly upset about it, wrapping his arms around the boy as best as he can when trapped under his vice-like grip, pulling him in even closer than before. He’s never been entirely fond of physical displays of affection (or any display of affection, save for nicknames), but Peter’s been all too happy to force him into obligation. He’ll take it while he can, he figures—there’ll come a day when Peter will shy away from the idea of cuddling with his parent, and he knows that he’ll miss it. Peter lets out a small hum of contentment, burrowing his face in a bit closer (and smearing the puddle of drool across his skin, much to his disgust), and lessening his deathgrip on Tony’s arm, much to his relief, though he’s pretty sure he’s going to developing bruises in the shape of Peter’s skinny fingers.
“He’s not my father,” Peter finally says, decision as heavy in his voice as the hurt is evident, “I’ve only got one.”
Steve doesn’t let himself think about how the sentence just goes straight to the perverse, because after all, he wasn’t the saint that the American people have somehow conjured the belief of him being. Instead, he looks up at Tony, whom waggles his eyebrows in a quiet brag, but Steve suddenly can’t continue the banter, because Tony looks so utterly exhausted and nervous that Steve’s nearly instantly worried. The grin’s sincere, but it’s not quite reaching his eyes, and the man can’t stop fidgeting in his seat, and every so often he’ll flick a gaze over towards the clock Steve knows to be behind his head despite the fact that he’s already wearing a watch.
He knows Tony’s in Denmark, currently Copenhagen, for some sort of conference, about what exactly Steve’s not entirely clear, but he does know that his usual bodyguard, Happy, is tagging along, as well as a full five-man team fielded by Pepper and Rhodey before their assignment. He also knows that these guys (and one lady) are former special-ops, Army Ranger types; armed to the teeth with weapons far too well concealed for the standard civilian to spot, and that each one was vetted by Peter himself (because Peter is a bit over-protective of Tony, which isn’t exactly unwarranted considering the engineer’s penchant for getting into danger) and given good reviews. Steve, himself, has done his own research on all five bodyguards, and knows that, based alone on track records, these are some of the best people to protect anyone.
“It’s not the same thing, Clint,” Steve begins as he shakes his head, trying to ignore the fact that his stomach’s dropped.
He can almost hear the eye roll when Steve says, “You know that’s not what I mean,” all parts aggravated and adoring, and he can’t help the cheeky grin that arises in retort, which earns him a soft slap (for Steve, anyways) on his hip, to which he dramatically howls, claiming that he’s now been mortally wounded, leaping out of the bed to get away from his attacker.
, so it’s not like you’re even really hiding anything, to be honest. In fact, I’m not sure why you’re not more forward with it.” Peter shrugs. “Tony loves you back, after all.”
When Peter’s decided he’s given Tony enough affection, he turns his attentions to Steve, and it’s almost painful, how Peter’s eyes light up when he sees Steve, and it’s not hero worship that does it.
He rubs the back of Steve’s bared right thigh gently, mumbling softly to the man about how well he’s doing, and Steve, for his part, damn near
“I’m a soldier,” Rhodey reminds Tony, “It’s part of the package. Now answer the question—don’t bother trying to pretend you don’t know what one, or I swear, I’m getting in the suit to come over there and kick your ass.”
to Peter to have to see this. He really wants to wring Tony by the neck for putting Peter through this, but he’s also well aware that this isn’t something Tony’s done entirely without reason. It’s an action that Steve can tell is entirely provoked, and its cause enough for worry that he’s requesting Pepper get him
Tony’s in a crumpled pile of himself in the middle of the main room of his private suite, the sounds of his ragged breaths the only sound to break through that of the thumping sound of Steve’s own blood, hands trembling furiously as he claws at himself, his face contorted into a damn near unrecognizable display of anguish. Tony’s not crying, not currently anyways, but his eyes are swollen and bloodshot regardless, open wide and unfocused, darting around as if looking for information but unable to take any of it. His lips move as if he’s talking to himself, but Steve’s not hearing any words make it through the shuddering, heaving breaths that leave Tony’s mouth currently.
Steve stands awkwardly at the door, as if he must be invited in so that he many enter, watching Tony with a gaze that he can’t truly quantify, which is worrying because the idea of
Dimly, he can hear Steve saying his name, but he’s not paying too much attention, his footsteps unsteady and his eyes unfocused, blindly grabbing at the things around him as he collapses, trying to break the fall, his breath to ragged and his heartbeat too loud, feeling the weight of his weakness, clawing at his chest. His fingernails scrape at the surface of the arc reactor, and he can’t help but want to rip it out of his fucking chest and just let the shrapnel
Steve sucks in a breath. Tony’s voice sounds so broken and he’d do anything to wipe that from his lips. “I’m sorry, Tony.”
He can’t really quantify the length of time he’s been in love with Steve. He imagines it started with a childhood crush, his father often covering his walls with posters of the hero, trying to get his son to admire the hero as much as he did, which worked to an extent, if Tony’s rampant fantasies at ages twelve to twenty-three of being fucked by Captain America could count as part of Howard’s goal of admiration. For a while, he tried to deny that any part of him was attracted to other men, focusing instead on the equally existent attraction he possessed to the opposite sex; in part a result of the publicity of his past sexual encounters and of the falling-out between him and a college boyfriend who couldn’t handle Tony’s fast lifestyle. Steve’s the first boyfriend (if he’s that) that he’s had in over twenty years, and he loves him more now than he thought he did when he was younger. It’s probably because their connection was that of actuality now, not of fantasy; strengthened by the closeness of their friendship and their shared love for Peter, and so held more resolutely in Tony’s mind.
He tries to think of something that he could’ve done to make Steve so unhappy in the past month or so they’ve been ‘together’, if you could really call it together when they haven’t gone out on any dates, really; they mostly spend their time watching movies with Peter, doing homework with Peter, playing video games with Peter, supporting Peter and occasionally making out on the sofa when Peter’s asleep or otherwise absent (not as often as he’d like, but Peter’s happiness comes way before his own)—is it maybe because it’s been six weeks and they haven’t had sex? Steve doesn’t strike him as the kind of person to get annoyed or even mad at something like that, but neither did Pepper, and it did get to her to a degree, but it’s not something he actively thinks about anymore—he’s not exactly in the prime of his youth, and he’s definitely not in a frame of mind anymore where sex makes the connection. He connects with Steve in different ways, ways that satisfy him enough—but what about Steve? Steve may be older, but physically, he’s young, and isn’t that what all young people want nowadays—sex?
Peter doesn’t go to sleep that night, and Steve’s utterly aware that it’s out of fear, and so while he’s aware that he can’t allow him to do this, he does anyways. He spends his night with Peter clutching him like some sort of octopus, arms tight around his neck and legs wrapped around Steve’s waist, and intermittently, he cries silently, trying not to let Steve hear it although he knows Steve does anyways. He just doesn’t make comment on it—he knows Peter doesn’t want him to.
Please do not go and try to respond to the reviewer. It's not necessary. But please do understand my (admittedly long) response and see what I've been pushing about Steve's character in this for over 3 stories.
“Point taken,” he says, hands up in the universal ‘stop laughter-induced vomiting’ sign, still laughing himself, his grin taking up almost all the available space on his face, “Stopping now. Only serious chatter now.”
“You’re not going to ruin a thing,” Steve says softly, sitting up just a bit, “I stand by my statement. Peter loves you.”
Steve rolls his eyes. “Why are the people in this tower so interested in my love life?” he grumbles, mostly to himself, but a bit of it is an honest question.
“Yeah, I do,” Tony argues, crossing his arms and huffing in a mock pout, though it’s clear to Steve that it’s really relief that Tony feels—relief that he wasn’t teased about this moment of vulnerability, Steve figures. “Especially because it was so fucking stupid to begin with. Really stupid.”
Not that he would ever want to, he believes, basking in the warmth of Steve pressed against his back, closing his eyes to store the memory. His memory has gotten better, recently; probably because of Peter, if he’s entirely honest, because that kid grows up so
, are blood, but they have practically no other united factor besides their biological relation, whereas Peter and Tony’s relationship, which is admittedly younger, has more of a standing ground, and that’s what he believes will matter to Peter. He can see why Tony may worry, and he’s not unjustified—Steve knows that it could very well just fall apart—but he just doesn’t believe it’s likely that Peter will give up the father he knows Tony to be for a family he doesn’t even know.
He means every single bit of it, and he’s sure that he looks nothing less than as wrecked as he feels.
Tony stares at him for a moment, all the while ignorant to the [loud, painful] pounding of Steve’s heart as it threatens to break from the confines of his chest, his mind jumping to conclusions he wasn’t even
,” orders Steve, “It’s not your burden. It’s not your fault. So stop taking on the weight of it all for once and let me shoulder the rest. Don’t do it all by yourself.” He holds Tony just a bit tighter as the man begins to be racked by tears, “And please don’t leave me.”
Peter doesn’t respond right away, busying himself by pulling Tony onto his back, taking the weight on with not even a grunt; shifting Tony around carefully to put him into a comfortable position. He takes great care in his moves, knowing that a wrong jolt and Tony’s nerves, however frozen most may be, will go haywire if he doesn’t move the right way. Tony’s vision is still skewed, off-kilter, and all he can do is hope that it’s not permanent, but he doesn’t give it all that much thought, because he can feel the sense of betrayal that radiates off Peter, who got tangled up into a fight that wasn’t his but affected him the most, who found himself without the luxury, suddenly, to be a sixteen-year-old boy.
I'm hoping you guys like this :) Kudos are kinda like their own little comments and near constant new views are as well so I'm going off of those and I hope you guys actually like this story. I hope it measures up, because I did actually manage another story for this little trilogy I've apparently created myself. Let me know what you think, I guess? Please? Thanks :) I hope you enjoy it!
Steve smiles a bit, albeit awkwardly. “No,” he says, shaking his head, but none the less not moving from the doorway, as if stuck there, “Just not quite sure what’s supposed to happen next is all.”
He’s aware he’s probably not doing the best thing for Tony right now. Tony needs not to shut things up again behind those walls and walls of protection like he’s so used to doing, but Steve’s too afraid to push him—too afraid to risk the chance that Tony could negatively respond to his pushing. So he doesn’t; he simply continues to make the sandwich, turned away from Tony, who now sits on the countertop behind Steve, staring down at his bare arms as if he’s never seen them before in his life. Steve doesn’t bring any attention to this, just like he doesn’t bring attention to the fact that his arms are covered in similar old scars.
Tony’s smiling right now, and Steve’s unable to tear his eyes away from the sight, ignoring the fact that Clint and Natasha are currently braiding Tony and Bruce’s hair, respectively, having a contest of sorts in their ability with hair, Clint delivering insults and taunts whilst Natasha remains cool under pressure, probably in an effort to keep Bruce’s head going aflame with the utter embarrassment that burns at the tips of his ears. Tony’s smile isn’t normal, which fits him because he’s far more than normal—his teeth look straight and aligned on the top, but the bottom is all crooked and is, frankly, screwed in comparison. They’re also a bit small, so his smile is mostly gums and lips, and each one looks so reservedly happy that Steve wants to strangle whomever made Tony believe he doesn’t deserve to be as happy as possible.
, don’t try to play dumb; you have one too many Masters degrees to play dumb—I figure that Steve might not be happy about that.”
He doesn’t know for how long Tony’s wanted him, loved him; and, he supposes, in the end it doesn’t matter too much, because the man who’s always so stuck in the past is finally fully in the present, fully able to focus on the flush of anticipation and desire that rushes through him as he moves in closer towards the shorter man, until the arc reaction can’t light up his face anymore and he can see, with his refined vision, almost every speck of dirt on Tony’s face that he decides to worry about later when he dips his head.
It isn’t until the third game that Steve’s almost forgotten what’s just happened, laughing and bumping shoulders with the engineer to throw him off, which makes him
Steve doesn’t realize it now, but he comes to realize later that this is a moment, what he and Tony are sharing right now in the aftermath of his vaguely inappropriate joke; in which the entire parameters of their existing relationship can change entirely, but he’s as unaware of the significance of these few seconds as he is unaware that the feelings he possesses for the other party might run the possibility of being reciprocated, or that the other man might be thinking very similar thoughts, and all that he would need to do is follow what his fantasies are trying to convince him to follow through with, but the idea of doing that just makes him want to
They don’t stay for too much longer, because the moment the front door of the house they’re watching opens, Tony puts the key in the ignition and tears away from the sidewalk, which doesn’t allow Steve to process too much other than an aged, but familiar, set of brown eyes in the rearview mirror. Tony’s silent again through the car ride over to Peter’s school, eyes trained on the road and hands tight on the wheel, and Steve doesn’t try to get him to speak this time—he can tell Tony needs this silence, and Steve’s more than happy to give it to him.
Steve is willing to consider the prospect that his crush on Tony (it feels childish to call his love for him a crush, like he’s some sort of gushy teenage girl, but if he admits to himself that it’s love then it’ll hurt more in the long run, so he doesn’t) is one that is completely evident—maybe even blatantly so—but it’s still downright embarrassing that its obvious nature has been pointed out by a twelve-year-old. He knows Peter means well, otherwise he wouldn’t bring it up at all, but it’s still mortifying that his affections for another man is obvious to a child who’s not even a quarter of his age (he still kind of struggles to reconcile the fact that he’s
Thank you all for your Kudos, Bookmarks and Comments- it really keeps the creative flowing, which I need because I'm STUCK on the Peter fic right now and it's DEFINITELY gonna get spliced up into a couple of stories because none of this series pass like 30-35 pages but Peter's is turning into quite the epic, it's just got me a little stuck. But it also INTRODUCES BUCKY FUCKING BARNES and I'm really excited to be writing Bucky because basically it's comicverse Bucky with all the cussing and the violence and the gruffness mixed in with movieverse Bucky's adorableness and angst and Sebastian Stan face (because no one can tell me that Sebastian wasn't born to be Bucky Barnes)
There isn’t a moment that Tony doesn’t laugh—legitimately laugh, not the one he gives when he knows the press is watching. It took Steve months to get Tony comfortable enough around him to be able to laugh like he does now, and Steve cannot get enough of it. It’s high up there on his list of the most beautiful things in his world, right above the view of a sunrise from the helicarrier’s highest elevation, but right below Tony’s smile. Everything’s below Tony’s smile, quite frankly, because that’s the one thing Steve’s just never been able to catch even a hint of the beauty of in pencil. The sight that is Tony’s smile just alludes him whenever he tries to capture it for himself—it’s something he can only experience by making it happen in real time.
Tony frowns just a bit. Maybe in a time long past (before he gave up the bottle, and probably before the bottle stopped having an actual effect on Steve) it would be a possibility, but it's not something he finds a comfort in thinking about, so as quickly as it comes to mind, he shrugs it back off.
“You say that as if you’re actually in control of when I go to sleep,” Peter points out. Steve would admit it, he’s more than a bit lenient when it comes to set times for sleep—but that’s only because usually Peter passes out somewhere before ten o’clock regardless; he hasn’t really felt the need to set strict times on the boy.
Tony. And, considering that’s all he wants, Tony doesn’t feel much in the way of trepidation as he wraps his arms around Steve body, kissing him
.” He sucks in a breath at that before continuing, even more painfully, “Or Peter.” He swallows audibly. “Someone has to stop them, Steve.”
He didn’t want to be away from Steve, he’s reminded, and he’d laugh if it weren’t so unfunny, so miserable; the cold beginning to seep through the breaks in the armor. He didn’t want to be away from Steve, stubborn Steve, unyielding Steve, righteous Steve, he’s-my-friend Steve, I-can’t-let-you-kill-him Steve, but-I’ll-happily-leave-you-here-to-die Steve, his love Steve, his destruction, Steve. He gave the man more than he ever wanted to give anyone, including Peter, and he just turned around and threw it back to him for the sake of some psychopath. He’d given Steve his trust, his love, shared his life and space with him; given him more than he ever gave even Pepper, and just like practically everyone else he’d ever chosen to give his life to in this way, Steve tossed him aside once something better came along.
Tony around and tweeting his every move. If it weren’t for the fact that Tony’s proven time and time again that he’s not exactly a damsel in distress, Steve would be a bit more worried.
to everyone (including the reviewers): i'm so sorry for what i'll be putting you through, emotionally, in this chapter and in the next. please don't hate me :(
“Tell me when you’re ready. If you’re ready,” Steve tells him, smiling gently at him before returning his immediate attentions back to his drawing. “I don’t want to push. I want you to be sure you trust me absolutely first. Besides, Clint’ll be annoyed if I put a damper on M to the Fourth by making you talk about your emotions. He might even try to kill me. He’s had enough tequila to consider making the effort.”
Talking with Bruce makes him feel better. He does all but confirm that he doesn’t know what he’s supposed to do with Tony either, which is great in and of itself because typically, if Rhodey’s not available, Bruce is the next best thing they had to a resident Tony expert. So, if Bruce doesn’t know, then Steve can only figure that even Bruce is only doing the best he can when it comes to dealing with the issues of Tony Stark. It’s a very small solace, admittedly, but it’s what he’s
Tony does his best to keep Peter as far removed from the situation as possible, Steve comes to realize quickly. It’s abundantly clear that there’s not a person Tony cares more for than he cares about Peter, ranking far above everyone else. In fact, Steve’s sure that for Peter, Tony would let the entire world burn if he needs to, which is precisely the reason, Steve figures, he fights even harder to protect it than he had before, because in Tony’s eyes, the world is the only gift worthy enough for Peter.
enough to pass it up. Besides, he’s in need to be distracted—why not let Steve be the provider of said distraction?
He instead focuses on making sure Tony doesn’t hurt himself more than he already has. It’s the least he can do, but he’s not sure how to do more as of this moment; the few glimpses the internet’s given him is that every person reacts differently to outside forces in the midst of an attack. He’s seen Bruce order JARVIS to begin playing heavy metal when it looks like Tony’s about to tip off the edge, but he’s also seen Natasha force Tony to help her make chocolate babka, and Clint runs off at the mouth about some stories from his time in the circus until Tony’s okay again. He’s only seen Tony really fall from the ledge about twice before, and both those times, Bruce was the first to respond and lock down the floor before Steve can really get a grasp on the situation.
Tony looks doubtful, but he doesn’t question him, looking towards the back of the kid’s head with a fondness for the boy that only a father can possess, and not for the first time, Steve recognizes how far Tony’s come in the past year due to his newfound role in life. He’d been terrified at first, Steve remembers, and as a team they’d been confronted with Tony’s multitude of issues and hang-ups. More than once in the days leading up to the adoption, Steve found himself having to talk Tony through some terrible breakdowns, the man revealing some terrible truths about his mental state to them all. It was a long road, a road that Tony still walked on, and every day Steve still found himself confronted with doubts in him drafted by Tony’s own insecurities; every day doing his best to show Tony as well as he can that his doubts needn’t exist.
Tony’s smile is renewed throughout the night, which is great because come the next day he’s a moody mess again who nearly rips Clint’s head off for stealing the last bit of coffee grounds left in the tin, and if Steve’s being completely honest, he’s not exactly a visage of sunshine the day after that, either, which puts it mildly as at one point throughout the day Tony throws a hammer at Clint for one reason or another, and surprisingly, he doesn’t exactly miss. He does apologize later, however—gifting Clint with an inordinately elaborate bouquet of cake pops, which the man is weirdly obsessed with—but Clint’s not exactly overeager to seek him out as a result. Steve doesn’t blame him, because just hearing that Tony threw something in frustrations makes him give him a wider berth, too. Tony obviously needs to sort out his problem, and as much as he likes the idea of holding his hand through every step of the way in this, he knows it wouldn’t be received as well as he’d like it to be; he’d sooner end up in a screaming match with him and that’s the exact opposite of what Tony needs.
They pull up in front of his school in no time, Tony rooting through the glovebox to procure a ballcap for Steve to put on so he can stand with Tony. They’re still a bit early, about five minutes before Peter’s robotics club is set to let out for the day, and there’s not really a lot of people milling about, so they get out the car, making sure their collars are high and the hats pulled down low, hands ducked into their pockets. Tony leans against the car door, staring at the front entrance for the school with an unwavering gaze.
“And since when did you become the one who gets to decide what Tony does and doesn’t need to hear?” Clint snaps right back, eyebrow arching high before he sighs. “Look, I don’t tell Tony because Nat asked me not to and Nat doesn’t tell Tony because you asked her not to, but that doesn’t mean to say that Tony doesn’t
Steve’s brow arches a bit higher, and he asks for the destination, neither making a formal confirmation. He already knows he’s going to go—he’s just curious as to the why.
Steve sighs, but he asks him what kind of filling he wants: roast beef, spicy mustard, and melted provolone cheese, apparently, is what Tony desires. And although he’s never been particularly gifted with the amazing skill that Clint apparently possesses in the department of sandwich craft, Steve finds himself making the food item that Tony wants; gliding the mustard-coated knife across the surface of the toasted bread.
, aren’t they, they’re his actual family, and he… he deserves to know, doesn’t he? That’s what I told Natasha. That’s what I told Clint. He deserves to know he’s not alone, right?” Tony shakes his head, his laughter verging on hysteria as he continues, “Because he’s not. He’s got two people in that house who love him—and they haven’t forgotten Peter, Steve, not for a minute, because May Parker—that’s his aunt’s name, May—she goes to a support group for people who’ve lost people, specifically,
Tony's not in the best of moods. It's understandable, but it doesn't mean to say that Steve doesn't want to somehow fix it, because he deserves it, and they all know it, not just Steve; and they're going to fix it - especially Steve.
bad habit, of hurting his partners when he’s really into the moment. Hair pulling, back scratching, neck biting—Tony’s a fan of all of it, but rarely does he remember to fucking
, and Steve can hear it, but in this moment, he’s not of the mind to let it stop him in the least, because Steve’s too furious, frankly, because he loves Tony, he loves Tony so fucking much it hurts, and Tony’s gone and gotten himself targeted by a fucking terrorist and put himself in this situation and
Rhodey sighs, rubbing his forehead. “He’s right, then. You guys do need to talk,” he says, exasperated, “Because you
Steve laughs, lifting up his arm so that Peter’s eye-level with him (an ability that he still finds himself surprised in his ability to do; he is really still used to the idea that the heaviest he was ever going to be lifting, ever, was a sheet of paper to attach to the easel), making the boy laugh as he swung him, gently, from side to side. Peter’s grip is good, so he’s not even looking like he’s afraid of the idea of falling; in fact, it looks like he’s enjoying this far more than a boy of twelve should be—shouldn’t he be off brooding?—whereas Tony looks like he’s half a step away from having a heart attack despite that Peter’s not even high enough off the ground to sprain himself, should he fall, eyes wide and so utterly
Tony looks at him before flicking nervous glance over at the other three members of their party. Both Clint and Nat were trying to undo the braid, because when Bruce had been doing it on his own, he’d created some gnarly tangles. Worry is evident on Tony’s face, along with apprehension.
“I don’t think it’s possible,” is the response he gives, and it’s entirely the truth, even though it hurts like nothing else can. The idea that he’s done something wrong is beginning to rip through him, bit by bit, causing his empty stomach to turn to lead, weighing him down as if he’s got no choice but to hear how much Steve hates him, how much he abhors wanting to be with him, how much he wants to be apart from him, how much he—
away. Stop being selfless for once in your life, Tony Stark, and stay right here with me. If you leave me, I’ll kick your ass into the middle of next week, so help me God.”
“Worse. Clint’s a worrywart with a flair for drama and an affinity for talking too much. I wanted to rip out his aids after the first thirty minutes,” Bruce admits almost in a whisper, laughing quietly to himself.
“Can’t we just watch the movie?” Steve half-asks, half-begs, blush rising rampant in his cheeks. He’s never been good with talks like these, not even before the ice (though, admittedly, there wasn’t exactly an overabundance of these types of conversations pre-ice), and he’s more than ready to slit his own wrists if Peter forces this conversation to continue. “I’ll even let you stay up later.”
Tony stares dumbly at him. “You were in there not even thirty full minutes ago,” he reminds him blandly, unable to come up with a less blunt way to say it, but it makes no sense—why would he
, and while he’s not all too big on cuddling, he’s more than accepting of it when Steve wraps his arms around his waist and pulls him in close, Steve’s heavy head laying upon his shoulder. The warmth of Steve burrowing into his side is way better than the blankets, he decides, and far less expensive to replace (though he’s never been a man to worry about expense, truth be told).
Steve sighs. “If Rhodey hears, he’s gonna force you to tell him when he comes,” Steve informs him quietly.
(In the morning, Peter finds them tangled up together on the couch, and after screeching in glory, he runs off to find Clint, leaving behind his two disorientated, confused and affectionate parents. He’s apparently made a bet with the rest of the team about them getting together—Clint and Bruce apparently thinking it’ll never happen [which offends Tony] and Natasha apparently knowing it would [which kind of scares Steve]. Clint’s resounding screech of utter anger and
choking person, but Steve manages to cough up the large chunks of the remains with only limited complication, his eyes tearing up slightly from the moments of lost air. For a second, he’s happy JARVIS continued to follow through on his request to deny Barton his access to his suite in the wake of the stink bomb incident two months previous, because right about now, he’d be requesting photos to be taken.
Steve allows him his silence. Pushing Tony into speaking wasn’t going to turn up fantastic results even if he wanted to do it, so he doesn’t—he lets the silence do it for him. It’s better at it, he finds, because a few moments later, Tony whispers, “I wanted to ask if you wanted to take a ride with me.”
Steve’s eyes widen just a bit. “I didn’t mean to make you anxious,” Steve says, swallowing, “I just…” He looks away now, “I just didn’t know how to bring this up. What I needed to say, I mean. I guess.” Tony frowns. He’s not sure why Steve looks so nervous, but he knows that it can’t be good.
Steve sighs. “I don’t want to leave you, but I’ll also understand if you need a bit of space. You’ve been through a lot in a couple of hours, Tony, so if you need the time to process it, I’ll understand it. It’ll be okay if you want me to go away for a little bit.”
—when, in truth, it’s really Steve who’s not worthy of the ground Tony walks on. He wants to contest Tony’s words, but at the same time, he knows that the moment he does, he’s basically assuring that he’ll lose Tony.
This makes Steve’s list of beautiful things, too, bumping the Italian countryside in at dawn right off the list. Sad, but as long as it’s Tony, Steve supposes it’s okay.
And, in this aspect, Peter’s so much like Bucky that Steve could cry. But he doesn’t—instead, he request JARVIS to pull up any movie that Peter hasn’t seen yet.
, and it’s what’s been keeping him mostly operational these past few days, despite the fact that he’s wanted to freak out since he first saw the rocket soaring through the sky, all Steve’s wanted to do was curl in on himself and shut the entire world out for as long as he can ever manage. Steve has to force himself to stay, because that’s what Peter needs: a parent to stay with him in the worst of moments. Peter’s not keen to let him out of his sight for more than a few moments, and he spends most of his time curled up against Steve, despite the fact that he’s far beyond the age that he needs physical comfort, but Steve’s always had a liking for cuddling so he allows it if only because it’ll keep Peter from completely falling apart at the seams.
