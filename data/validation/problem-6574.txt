“Steve,” she repeated. “Well, Steve, it’s nice to meet you. Like I said, I’m Pepper. You’ve met Tony already, right? Um, not that— I know anything about that. I definitely don’t know anything about that meeting. Where you met…”
The not-angel-and-not-Bucky man visibly winced, and something ugly turned over in Steve’s stomach when he realized that look:
is just about right. Though, if you’ve got the frisbee with you, that’d be an interesting experiment. Heard it’s made out of the good stuff. Tell you what. I’ll trade you a tour of the house — a good one — for an hour of your time down in my lab to test it out, hm?”
Huffing, the Captain pointedly directed his gaze away from Fury, batting away the rest of the response in blatant dismissal. Alerting Peggy that he was alive was one of the first things he’d requested SHIELD do. But since then? He hadn’t been able to bring himself to see the Agent. It wasn’t that he didn’t want to. Peggy had been one of his closest friends throughout the war. He’d loved her, he really had. She understood him in nearly excruciating detail, and he’d understood her.
“How long am I being sent out there for? Sir.” The words were sharp, hard. Steve wouldn’t look at the other man as he asked his question, unable to even if it’d been something he’d wanted to do. Something about the response caused the Director to back off, shoulders dropping as a hesitant sigh was drawn out of him. Slow and worn out, like the steam of one of the machines behind the barista counter. Like the aging of the parish across the street.
It was eerie, the way the silence settled over the room. Nobody wanted to say a word. Steve wasn’t sure he wanted them to, either, now, his heartbeat quickening of its own accord. Beating along to the rhythm of
His church attendance died alongside his ma. The belief there was anything out there at all died in the cold light of winter, in the eyes of the first soldier he watched die. It’d flickered to life for just a second at the sight of something he couldn’t comprehend, blazing stars and galaxies at his fingertips and Schmidt being eaten alive by space itself.
Who then frowned, seemingly reminding himself of his position in all this. “Pepper, there’s no way this is a good idea. I mean, come on. Seriously?” Gesturing between the two of them, he shot the CEO an indiscernible look. It must’ve been a normal one for her, though, considering she didn’t blink twice.
The question might as well have hit him over the head with a baseball bat. Tony felt his jaw drop, lips parted and waiting for the words rattling around in his head to form a damn sentence. And when they did, he frowned, spluttering out an unintelligible mutter. What the hell was he even supposed to say to that?
It’d taken most of his willpower not to laugh in her face, or break the arms of the overstuffed chair he’d been planted in. He’d snorted, looked out the too-bright window, forcing himself to stare at the sun in the hopes it’d warm him up more. He didn’t tell her about how it’d been slow, because of the air bubble in the Valkyrie. Didn’t tell her how the frigid water had him nearly frozen in place, sucking the oxygen out of his lungs quicker than it could replace it with liquid. Didn’t tell her his last words were to Bucky, someone who’d been dead and gone for more than a year. He’d just— waited, until his hour was up, and she dismissed him.
He thought he might hate the man, a little bit. Stormy eyes, more red-rimmed than he’d like them to be, followed the director out the door, before screwing shut as he fought for air. Urging himself to breath in through his nose, out through his mouth, the same instructions he’d given long ago, when breathing was difficult for more than near terror. The pacing of Fury’s heartbeat hadn’t changed, his posture had stayed the same; for once, the wave of relief was heavier than that of the anxiety. He’d bought it. Steve was
Like he didn’t see the ocean, in perfect, unholy, hellish detail every night as he slept, freezing and unforgiving. Like he hadn’t felt it fill up his lungs without a drop of mercy, as the Valkyrie sank to the bottom of the sea. Like it wasn’t there, waiting behind his eyelids every time he blinked. Drowning in the Arctic was something he’d do anything to forget. But between an achingly perfect memory, and SHIELD agents asking him about how things used to be “back in the day,” and his therapist’s prodding notes about his need to stay warm and his distant behavior on the topic, he couldn’t get away.
Static filling his ears, heart slamming against the underside of his ribcage, Steve shook his head, just once.
While Happy held an ID against a black keypad next to the front doors, Steve took in the sights: through the windows, he could see an indoor fountain, smooth, white-marbeled textures, a grand piano. Beyond that, cream-colored, chic furniture was littered around massive windows offering up a view of the ocean. He could practically smell the wealth as they stepped inside, clean and crisp like linen, and the only thing that kept him from outright wrinkling his nose on impact was the redhead in front of them, standing with her back to Happy.
Maybe he should be added to the list, too. He was just as off in the twenty-first century as anything else was. Foreign. Alien.
The usual start of an argument, a particularly quick snap from Tony, and then Steve abruptly forcing himself to shut down.
Steve had to bite back a laugh — the first time he’d had to do that since he woke up — at the reminder of his not-angel damn near cursing him out in surprise. “The feeling was mutual,” he murmured instead, eliciting an interested hum from Tony.
For the way Bucky’s hair curled during the Sunday masses Steve’s ma would drag the both of them to, if only because Buck’s parents weren’t all that religious. For the way they’d brush pinkies when passing communion. And grin.
Though as he stood, the spy faltered, his dark eye searching for something he wasn’t sure he’d find.
Sprawling, in a way that was nearly opposite to New York. Skyscrapers and bridges were swapped with long stretches of highway and palm trees, mansions and gleaming white buildings scattering the tan backdrop. And despite the rolling thunder and steady drizzle of rain splattering against the asphalt, it was somehow still brighter than the familiar neighborhoods of brownstones and brick.
“Fine. Fine, okay? Fine. I guess we’re doing this, then. But seriously, house tour, gawk at all the shinies, AI 101, sure, but afterward, I really do have work. That I specifically, um, didn’t put on the schedule. Okay? Some very important, very non-scheduled work, that has a literal, ticking time limit on it, and I don’t want it to blow up by accident, so.”
“We’re not going there,” Tony warned, slicing a hand through the air. “I just— you push all my buttons, too, alright? Don’t act like this is all one-sided. You’re all high and mighty and perfect, even though I bet you couldn’t tell a TV remote from a vibrator. Like, I
The drive over to Stark’s home was mostly quiet, save for the occasional comment by the driver — Happy, he said his name was, Stark’s head of security — pointing out good surfing spots, pizza places, movie theaters. Just once, he’d asked Steve for an I.D., and nearly blanched when he’d reached to the front of the car with his SHIELD-issued clearance card. After that, he stopped speaking, and Steve turned his gaze out the window to watch the palm trees pass by for the rest of the hour-long drive.
a natural distress over something, like waking up seven decades in the future, was enough to send someone to therapy.
used to hang outside, boasting as much fresh fruit, milk, and coffee that rations would let a fella buy. It’d been replaced by deep browns and greens, offering up coffee from Seattle. He wasn’t sure what was so special about Seattle coffee, but it tasted like it’d work.
“A month, for the time being. We’ll adjust as needed. Get you out with a mission as soon as you’re back to normal. Don’t worry, you’ve still got some homework. I want everything in that file memorized, back to front. And you can take the shield.”
him until he got better? Straightening in his chair, the Captain shook his head. “With all due respect, Sir, what’s in Malibu?”
That seemed to catch Steve off guard, wariness flashing across his face. And as he sat there, lips pursed and deep in thought, the man came to a decision.
“Yeah, and how many secretly-evil corporations have you all taken down on an hour time limit? Stick with playing Russian double agent, and let me figure this out. I know what I’m doing.”
It didn’t matter that the rain smattering against the window was beginning to sound more like the distant clatter of guns and armor; or that the more antsy he got, the more he could hear Fury’s heartbeat and the heartbeat of every other person in the café; or that he was sure the anxious tick in his jaw was prominent, exactly like it was when his fight or flight response was about to kick in. Fists clenching under the table, he glared up at the other man. Tried to convince himself not to let out the warning noise building up in his chest, and barely succeeded.
At that, Steve perked up, curiosity spiking past his self-doubt. “Is it the Iron Man suit? I read about it on the flight over. You’ve got a, uh, file, with SHIELD. It looks incredible.”
studying the grease mark on his sneaker, pursing his lips like he’d been caught doing something he shouldn’t have. “Really?”
He wanted to ask the question. Wanted that to be the case. Was desperate for it. What a horrible person he was, hoping the love of his life was in hell by his side. What a terrible thing it was, to feel a pang of disappointment when his vision focused, and the angel’s outline became clearer.
Well, now he’d really done it. A nervous laugh slipped out at the words, though it might be ‘cause it the only other option was to scramble out the door alongside the rest of the team. Tony watched them file out, one by one: Bruce, quickly. Then Thor, radiating mild confusion at the entire event. Natasha, who snuck an imperceptible look at Rogers. Last was Clint, with an expression that screamed,
“Sleep with him?” Steve insisted, brow pinching in distress. His hands pressed together underneath the table, white-knuckled and bruising as a flare of panic lacerated his gut. “I’m n-not— that’s not—”
“Cap— it’s been a while since you crashed the Valkyrie. A long while. Tony, he can explain his theories on how the serum’s kept you alive this whole time if that’s something you want to know. Yesterday, I got a call from some researchers up north. Said they’d found a craft that was up SHIELD’s alley. We weren’t expecting to find you. When we excavated the plane, our guys found you spread out on the war table, mummy-style, shield in hand. In a block of ice about the size of a sarcophagus.”
“That seems to be the problem, Captain,” Fury directly retorted, leaning forward to plant his elbows on the coffee table. If Steve didn’t know any better, he would’ve taken it as aggression.
“You did agree to this,” Pepper interrupted smoothly, glancing down to tap at the signature Steve had scrawled on the tablet. “Technically. You took one look at the stack of paper on your desk, told me to use my best judgement on behalf of you, and I thought this was the right move to make. Yes, you might be busy, but you can be busy next to Captain Rogers.”
No, if anything, shit was hitting the fan at a more rapid pace than during the days after the Chitauri invasion.
It was just about the biggest understatement he could skate by with. The suit, gleaming red and gold, had been like nothing he’d ever seen before, reminiscent of the science fiction movies they played in theaters and the angels in the Old Testament that his ma would talk about, terrifying and awesome in the way that inspired awe, not the way he used the word, with a toothy grin and excitement in his voice.
He read about the deepest parts of hell being cold, once. Reserved only for the worst traitors, those who’d turned their backs on their friends, their family, their country. Brutus, Cain, Judas.
Clint’s words were low and chalk-full of warning, worry plastering across the rest of the team’s faces. He didn’t get any farther than that, though, not once Steve interjected. Rumbling and brooking no room for complaint, a single, thick finger pointed toward the door.
Shooting the redhead a glare that carried the emotion of a foot stomp, Tony huffed out a breath before swiveling on his heel to face Steve, a grease-covered finger loosely pointed his way. “I don’t exactly have time to hold your hand through learning how to use the microwave, or whatever else you’re gonna freak out about.
“Yes, we met briefly. He, uh. Woke me up from the ice.” Before Steve had been wheelchaired over to look out the window, into a busy, bright Times Square, and promptly locked himself in one of the restrooms to cope for the better part of an hour.
gonna need you to not sling the frisbee around. For all our sakes. Name’s Fury. I’m the Director here.”
Hi. I’m so sorry, you must be Captain Rogers,” the redhead offered, pulling a glass tablet out from under her arm. “I’m CEO of Stark Industries. My name’s—”
Again, Steve was struck by the level of trust Stark clearly had for the woman. Maybe they were together? Though, he didn’t see any wedding bands on either of them, and Fury’s brief description of Tony suggested he was about as ready to settle down as Howard had been when they’d been friends. Pepper didn’t seem to take the question lightly, either, her expression gentle as she hesitated, ran through all the options one last time.
It shouldn’t surprise Steve, the way Fury seemed to appear and disappear into thin air. Still, it managed to, caution flashing across his features for a half-second before schooling himself into neutrality: An expression, he’d learned, that was very important, when it came to Fury. Because,
Steve thought. He could tell it wasn’t a common emotion for the man. “You just woke up. Let’s give you some time to ease in.”
Fury’s mouth twitched at the goading before finally taking his seat. After a beat of hesitation, he pulled a thick file of papers from his trench coat, slid them onto the table in between them, and nodded. “Of sorts. More of an assignment, really. Just to get you back on your feet until we call you in for the real thing.”
After a beat of silence, he lobbed a shoulder upward in a shrug. “We weren’t expecting it to happen. He was supposed to be comatose, mostly, and I’d come to analyze some blood samples, bring in some files I had on him. That’s what the Leatherman of Penzance asked me to do. So I said I wanted to see him. Y’know, scientific curiosity. Bent over to get a good look, and he just— opened his eyes. Scared the shit outta me.”
“It’s from my time in the circus,” Clint protests. “Didn’t have time to practise my penmanship and shit, you know? Why don’t you make a movie about
Steve whirled around and neatly caught his flying shield on his arm. There it was, Ol’ Silver Platter (James Barnes, 1945).
conflict in the Northern Hemisphere. Just the really notorious ones. It’s not always about me, you know. Well, maybe it’s always about me. Ninety-nine point nine-nine percent of the time it’s about me —”
,” says Thor, sheepish. “That is when I knew. Usually that is a precursor to complete disaster. This was mere petty revenge against Stark for the events of four of your Midgard years ago, I daresay. Mother and Father are of the opinion that Loki was,” Thor clears his throat, “talking complete shite, and that the universe bears no grudges against anyone.”
“So’s he,” snaps Tony. “And I’m not jealous. I don’t get jealous over him. Not that I pine for him when he’s not here. And I only wanted Bruce’s plans, I want payback for that meme. Steve? I don’t care about Steve. Steve can go —”
mother, dear brother, you utter twit. She has deigned to oust me from our ancestral home and — and make me
“Very drama, much scary, wow,” Tony mutters. Barnes across the table snorts very loudly, as if to convince Tony that Loki’s words are arrant falsehoods.
“He rather looks to be enjoying it, actually.” Barnes is indeed tossing Clint more arrows to poke Tony with.
“Yes, Tony totally deserved it,” Virginia ‘Pepper’ Potts says, crossing her legs behind her sleek CEO desk at Stark Industries. She coos at DUM-E, who trills his modem-song at her.
“I sympathise. Best wishes to you on your fruitless endeavour.” The oven light goes off with another beep, and Thor does a little wiggle of joy. DUM-E, the ‘goodest’ boy (Natasha Romanoff, 2015), gets the whole thing.
The upshot of it all was that the rest of the Avengers traipsed in later to find Bruce and Loki both picking pineapple off their pizzas with care, evidently pained at the thought of being in agreement about anything. Steve took a bite of his own slice and sighed, shamelessly pining for Tony again.
“TRUE LOVE!” bellows Thor, surging into the room, hammer in hand. “MOTHER SAYS TRUE LOVE’S KISS SHALL —”
“Very well, Steven, I see your need. LOKI!” Thor roared, and slammed a fist on the counter. Everyone jumped. Bruce’s spatula clattered to the floor.
“To say nothing of the megalomaniac robot,” mutters Tony, dialling your mother Bruce Banner and leaving foulmouthed insults on his voicemail — for of course, the culprit behind the meme was he.
Stephen Strange couldn’t look more disdainful if he tried. “Going back to this extremely urgent and important problem that will —”
one,” Vision told Bruce, who snorted. “FRIDAY, you’d better not let him delete this from the records.”
But then he joins in and smugly wins five matches in a row with Tony catcalling him as background music.
Steve came home past midnight to find Tony waiting up for him. FRIDAY must have alerted him; he’d been extremely careful to land the quinjet noiselessly outside in the Nick Fury Memorial Gardens (named by Take a Wild Guess after a man who was neither dead nor appreciative of the commemoration).
Loki holds his hands out and shouts something unintelligible. His fingers start to glow, electricity crackling around them. The sound of waves crashing against a shore erupts around them, and when the ground starts shaking you have to hold a frantically-beeping DUM-E steady as you float into the air, ready to intervene should something go wrong.
“— just kidding, darling, but in case something happens tell Rhodey I’m mad he couldn’t get here in time from his super-secret military Antarctic mission, and Pepper that she can have the Guernica I stole from her house when I was drunk that one time.”
Thor gets Loki to simmer down and allow himself to be muzzled by the Stark-patented Celestial-Teletubby Shutter-Upper™, threatening him with the Hulk Timeout Corner two floors away. They might have decamped to a conference room, but the set-up resembles a classroom with Loki at the head of the table and the Avengers all in front of him, assembled as a group.
“Fuck off,” Tony mutters very, very quietly, but Strange hears it anyway, and drops him and his chair through a portal.
The crow caws at you. Colonel Rhodes pushes him off his shoulder in relief, and he takes flight indignantly to come to rest on your head.
“Really. Any of us, all of us could be in mortal danger right now because of the unpredictability and instability of this branch and instead of actually doing something about it you’re electing to be a piece of shit?”
Steve bursts into helpless laughter, so different from the dramatic scene you witnessed before. Thor grabs you, Natasha, and DUM-E, and flies out like his cape is on fire.
see some rainfall, and I was the only person in New York who missed it. Thanks for pointing it out, you’re my best friend forever. However, as all New Yorkers and even the entire world may be aware, it wasn’t due to any natural phenomenon — so it’s still bound to be a perfectly fine day for us mortals, unless Scandinavia’s answer to He-Man wants to confute my meteorologist credentials again, in which case: you’re not the god of
Tony looks like he wishes he had an ear trumpet aimed at Natasha right about now. “So where the heck are they, anyway?”
,” Tony hisses, deliberately forgetting he’s the biggest one of them all and scrolling through the memes on his holographic Twitter feed. “Bad touch, Butterfingers! Hands off, have I ever needed comforting, ever? It’s like you don’t even know me. Barnes was put on this here land specifically to piss me off; you’d think he’d be as big a Luddite as Rogers, who’s allergic to technology at the best of times —”
Loki pretended to look right through Bruce, who was suddenly very focused on not burning his next batch, and Vision, who had just as suddenly turned translucent (except for the hand holding the camera). “Well?” he said after some time passed. “What is it that I was brought here for? Bear in mind before you utter a single word that Mother has forbade me to touch even a hair on the head of that tiresome, vexatious arsehole.”
like Fury said. Which— Oh, Christ. He’d just swatted away his boss. Eyes widening, Steve’s shoulders bunched in a flash of concern.
He could see why someone would think it’d be good for him to get away here. For anyone else, it might’ve done them some real good. But the ocean spray, the bristling wind, it was enough to set his jaw, the weak curl of nausea in his gut one he doubted would be a rare experience moving forward. At the end of the day, though, he didn’t have a choice. Orders were orders. Fury was the boss. Which meant, he guessed, Malibu would have to be therapeutic, whether he liked it or not, on threat of his work — really, one of the few things he had left.
The immediate scowl brought on by Fury’s probing question was all the answer he needed. For all Steve’s readiness to get back into the field, to return to some sense of normalcy, he was still recovering from the aftermath of an icy seven decades. It’d taken him almost an entire week to be able to swallow food that hadn’t been turned into a smoothie, almost two to pass a ten minute mile, and even now, he’d break into a sweat if he did much more than half an hour at the punching bag. Frankly, his body was closer to its pre-serum ability than it was when he’d gone into the ice. And that was
“No, I don’t,” the genius snapped back, leaning forward in his chair with a wave of his hand. “You’re not listening to what I’m saying. I’m trying to tell you, this next mission? It’s not gonna work if you try and play it sneaky. This is AIM. They’re good at what they do, and you’ve got to catch them off guard. Bursting down their front door is gonna do exactly that.”
New Jersey had been the first place outside of the city he’d been, a little darker, a little more dismal, a mild punch to his Brooklyn-loving heart. He didn’t think much of it.
You’re really just cool with this? If he kicks your ass like the last one did, don’t come crying to me about it, alright?”
But then, of course, duty had called. It’d taken the form of tights and war bonds and call-girls for coworkers — something he’d never really been able to parse through his substantially mixed feelings for. Patriotism via the idea of a monkey dancing to the tune of propaganda. So he’d shoved that into the box of things he didn’t think about, too, right next to Bucky’s death and the
At first, it was just— small things. Tony being twenty minutes late for debriefings and training. Steve accidentally crushing the television remote. Dishes. The best way to knock out a Chitauri in one hit. But now? It was anything. Missions, training, press conferences. Enough to where, a few days ago, Fury had taken Rogers by the ear for a
Golden warmth radiated from the hazy lights surrounding the man, and a celestial blue from the center of his chest. Wide, amber eyes were gazing down at him with interest, as the chestnut curls dangling over his forehead moved with each exhale from cherry red lips, which parted so carefully to say—
It was rude. He shouldn’t have said it. But as soon as the words left Tony’s mouth, what other choice did he have than to double down?
“Close to seventy years. It’s April, 2009. Tony Stark, he’s Howard’s son. Howard passed several years ago. Your sacrifice, it changed the war. HYDRA was Germany’s biggest chance for success, and that went down with the Valkyrie.”
“Alright. I’ll make more of an effort to listen to you, if you’ll spend time in the city with me, help me relearn it.”
“Then call him back,” Steve grit out, biting back the urge to scowl at the angsty bastard. “We’ve got HYDRA’s leader in the wind with some goddamn
“Captain?” Happy’s voice pulled him out of his head, the man’s eyes watching him curiously in the rear-view mirror. “We’re here.”
“SHIELD. Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division. We’ve revamped the science reserve since you went into the ice. Upgraded things a bit. This is Agent Coulson. He does a bit of everything, ‘round here. And this is Tony Stark. SHIELD’s genius consultant. When we found you, we weren’t sure what we were gonna get. We called him in, hoping he could figure out how the hell you survived that crash.”
Whoever the brunet was — the not-Bucky man — he was still holding his hands out, palms open, like he was still debating shoving Steve back into the, uh. Mattress pad. Hospital bed. Whatever it was. Instead, he went for a classy, ghost-like blank stare and an expression that warned him something was very, very off.
Pep. Happy? Happy. Hey, focus up. Security’s still your job, right? Another body in the house, potential unknown, another one from
Overhead, a polite, accented voice chimed, surprising absolutely nobody but Steve, blue eyes blowing wide with alarm when he couldn’t match the voice to a body.
At that, Pepper smiled, warm and inviting. He liked her, he decided. It was an easy one to make, despite his normally cautious nature. Maybe it was the way Tony treated her with such obvious trust, posture nearly completely different than he’d been the first time they’d met, open and easygoing rather than telegraphed and wary. Maybe it was the way she seemed similar to Peggy, oozing easy confidence and control. She was a woman who worked to get where she was, and she had, without a doubt, earned it.
At that, Tony’s brow twitched. He slumped into the back of his chair, dark eyes pinned to the man in front of him. That was how this was going to go down? Rogers was going to sit here and bully him into a damn date? Out of all the ways the asshole could’ve asked, of course it’d be like this. Because when it came to the two of them, why the hell should anything be normal?
“Happy! God, it’s so good to see you. There’s a, um, thing, you’ll want to hear about in a bit, okay?” The woman looked like she wanted to say more before Happy cleared his throat, not-so-subtly jerking his head toward Steve.
“The cube is also safe, Captain.” Weird-suit man smiled thinly, the words no more revealing than his first statement had been.
Across from him, Steve looked like he’d just been slapped. That angry tick in his jaw, the way his cheeks flushed red, even the way he visibly had to check himself before speaking up: It was all a surprising amount of self-control from the man who’d just called Tony a, uh.
was an understatement, a dangerous one to make. Who knew what’d happen here? Who knew if he’d freak out? Certainly not him. Steve hardly knew anything anymore, his face constantly slightly pinched with nerves, afraid to play the game when there were new, unfamiliar rules. But here, there was no point in putting his foot down. No reason to say ‘no.’ It wasn’t like he had anything better to do, and it certainly wasn’t like he had anywhere else to go. Lips pressing into a thin line, the Captain nodded.
“Let me finish,” Tony pressed, eyes narrowing in a visible attempt to stay calm. “With as much as Howard and Peggy liked talking about you growing up, you being good at your damn job is
Happy looked unimpressed at the protest. “Boss,” he offered, pointedly glancing at the circular bag Steve was shouldering. “He’s Captain America. He’s, like, the opposite of a security threat.”
Snorting, Fury leaned back against his chair and crossed his arms. “Trust me. We’ll get you in as soon as all the boxes are checked and you’re cleared for action. We need you back, Cap. There’s a brave, dangerous new world out there waiting for you. But, the last thing we need is for you to take a hit you can’t shake because we put you back out too early. You ran your first eight minute mile this morning. Still got a ways to go, right?”
“I didn’t agree to this,” Tony insisted incredulously. “No way in hell did I agree to this, Pep. I’d remember something like that. And besides, we’re— we’re
“Tony’s very pleased to have you, Steve. He’s admired you for a long time,” Pepper translated, turning to face Steve fully. “If you want, he’d be happy to show you to your room? You can unpack your things, and then he can give you a tour of the house.”
Steve thought, and used as much effort as he could to force himself upward. One forearm at a time. One burning movement after the other. One painful second in front of the next, shooting the — one (eyepatch man), two (not-angel man), three (almost balding, weird suit man) — the three men in the room around him a dirty look for making any movement to push him back, all stepping forward and ready to spot him.
“You fuckin’ act like it, sometimes,” Steve snapped, before wincing and visibly reeling himself in. A large hand scrubbed over the blond’s face, eyes raising heavenward as if to ask for a bit of reprieve. “I don’t get it. It’s like you’re trying to push all my buttons. You don’t do it to anyone else, not the way you do with me. What is it, huh? You brought up your dad. Is it ‘cause you think I only see H—”
for the rest of our stay, promise.” He waits until Steve stops glaring, then talks. “Anyway. You know the thing you do when you’re yourself,” Tony begins, and Steve frowns again. Tony is really glad he is a super soldier, otherwise he would already be sporting some impressive wrinkles on his forehead. “
The man brings his left hand to the back of his neck and smiles, sheepish. “That you’ve been trying to avoid large groups of people, or tried to stay by the walls the whole time… But even your mask alone is telling enough, tied to your head so people aren’t encouraged to start conversations very easily.” He concludes with a shrug. “You struck me as someone who prefers to be left alone.”
He takes a final look at it, turns it around and makes some final, manual modification at the measurements and details.
Tony smiles and resolutely ignores the little flip his stomach does at the sound. He’s quite proud of introducing Steve to memes and other wonders of the twenty-first century.
“I was going to come find you,” Steve says, then takes a seat at the isle, right in front of Tony. “After I showered. I’d have brought you breakfast. It wasn’t going to be as delicious as these, though, so… This is for the best,” he finishes, gesturing at Tony as if to say ‘
The thing is, it has been ages since he’s participated in one of these events, and he didn’t attend many even before Afghanistan – he was more interested in science fairs and tech events, rather than shady army conventions and black-market social circles. He didn’t have a lot of experience with this to begin with. And it’s been so long, he’s kind of forgotten what the social customs are.
Before he knows, he finds himself in position, and he has little room left to think about it before the violins begin playing and they start moving like one, Steve leading, Tony following.
Steve figures he must have arrived pretty early in the life of this version of Tony and himself. If other Steve is still surprised that Tony would figure out how to time and universe travel because he was
Steve breathes in and caresses his back lightly, holding him tight. He’s still swaying with Tony, the song playing in the background. Then he says, “I love you too, Tony.”
The other Steve watches them intently. Steve tries not to mind that, his prime focus fixed on Tony, but he knows that if things were reversed, he’d like to be included. Especially if Tony was talking with
Steve snorts a laugh. “God, you’ve been awake all night, haven’t you? You need to get some sleep,” he says.
Moments after getting inside, Steve examined the room, taking in how many security guards and cameras there were, and informed the others via his Stark camera – undetected, of course.
“No, leave it.” Tony takes another look at the 3D hologram, turning it around again. “I wonder if… Try rendering it as stealth, J.”
They get as far as removing their own shirts when the only thing Tony couldn’t possibly plan against happens.
Hardly anyone has ever been this kind to him. With Steve, Tony feels like he matters. Steve actually
make me want to know all those things. You make me want to keep up. You, Tony. And I love you,” he says.
“I’m glad. You had me worried there for a moment.” Steve’s tone is light, but even without looking at his face, Tony can tell he’s still pretty worried.
Tony tries not to think about how that same voice was calling his name just the previous night. He tries, but it’s really, really difficult not to.
Tony nods. Steve’s face is so close. Tony traces his moles with his fingers, a familiar gesture, and it’s all he can do before leaning in and kissing him.
“I don’t do that, I don’t ‘make people like me’,” Steve protests. His brow is furrowed adorably and Tony has to physically hold back from leaning in and kissing the center of his forehead.
“Your night going well, I take it?” Tony asks near Steve’s ear, taking in Steve’s relaxed stance. He’s probably closer than normal, but he doesn’t give a damn. Steve is irresistible.
“Sure,” Tony grumbles, voice rough from disuse. He tries not to look at Steve as he takes the same ingredients and puts them in the blender. Before giving it to Steve, Tony takes the cinnamon powder and sprays some on top of his smoothie. He may not be fond of cinnamon, but Steve loves it.
They didn’t part on the best of terms – Tony acted pretty childish; he is man enough to admit that. It’s just that… Last night was a lot.
Tony puts his mouth on him and kisses his covered length. Steve moans like he’s being strangled – and the sound goes straight to Tony’s dick.
Ever since the mess with Ultron, the Avengers seems to have made it their personal mission to stick together, on missions, at home, everywhere they could.
That should be any minute now, Tony said they would be ready before six, and the man is nothing but precise, about technology.
And now they’re on Tony’s bed, they’re under the covers and they’re kissing, and Tony is sure his plan is bulletproof.
, Tony’s new addiction is sweeter than alcohol ever was for him. Tony chases Steve’s lips with his own for a little while, then whispers, “God, Steve. Want to get out of here?”
Clint’s been following the whole conversation with only part of his brain. He’s thinking about seeing Laura, hugging his little ones… That is until one of them mentions his name.
Tony’s workshop has quickly become one of Steve’s favorite places to spend his free time. When Tony is in there, and Steve is not working out in the gym, or isn’t volunteering at the animal shelter right down the road, or isn’t cooking something for the whole team, Steve is in the workshop with him. He likes to relax there, keeping Tony company, sketching stuff and making sure Tony doesn’t accidentally set the lab on fire, or injures himself.
The man in front of him is smaller than him, has blonde hair, and is holding a deep blue mask in front of his azure eyes— Tony doesn’t recognize him.
Tony arches up into him, moaning shamelessly. “Please, Steve,” he says, rough. He doesn’t even care he’s already begging. “You know you can do anything you want to me.”
would make a clever, teasing comeback, and that’s where his Tony would up the game and start filling their bantering with innuendos. This Steve, though, doesn’t reply – he just stands there, posture stiff and shielding Tony with his whole body, and—
The motion makes Steve utter a noise that sounds suspiciously like a strangled moan. It goes straight to Tony’s brain, like a wave of shock coursing through his body. Steve’s mouth opens under Tony’s tongue, and just like that, the dam breaks.
When the watch beeps the three-minute alarm, Steve has observed enough to know that Tony and other Steve are full on pining for each other – Steve recognizes himself in the looks and gestures of other Steve, and sees the looks and body language of Tony whenever he talks to his Steve— so very similar to his own Tony’s.
Sometimes, when Steve is immersed in his training, he gets lost in his own head and doesn’t hear Tony’s approach. Steve’s knee-jerk reaction to someone startling him is punching the other person square in the face.
Tony wants to know. He regrets not knowing everything about Steve. Granted, he’s done his fair share of research about the guy, not only in his most recent years, but throughout his whole life. Howard had always been proud of knowing Captain America. Tony used to research things about him, way before the Internet became a commodity. He’s always wanted to know as much as possible about Captain America – and he’s managed to dig up a lot of things about him, throughout the years.
Tony barely has time to register the burst of happiness on Steve’s face, before he’s on him, kissing him within an inch of his life.
so bad, he’s been wanting this for over a month – he’s been wanting this for years, way before he and Steve got together, and Tony can’t quite believe he is about to have it.
His first instinct is to find a bottle of liquor and drink himself into sleep. Luckily for him, he doesn’t have alcohol in the workshop, so he settles on focusing all his attention on research. He digs up everything about Immortus and his gatherings, collecting little information but new names, and then he digs up everything on those names too, and before he knows it, Jarvis is reminding him that he’s been awake for almost twenty-four hours.
Tony: Happy was actually my driver before becoming head of security and is probably now Pepper’s driver again due to the demotion. I don’t have anything against people driving me but it’s obvious you learned how to drive in a war zone. If you were my driver during Afghanistan, it wouldn’t have happened, but you’re not exactly suited for a drive from the compound to Manhattan.
It took Steve a moment to realize exactly who Tony was talking about. He meant Daisy. The one May watched disappear right in front of her. The child that she called out for in the middle of the night.
“But you don’t have to,” Afia said, putting an arm around Simmons. “Fitz is my friend and I want to save him. I can be rebuilt. You can’t. I want to help.”
Agent L. Barton: That tells me she’s a good fit if we do get the Avengers back together again. What else do you know about her?
The Big Boss: Because Phil was taken off the investigation and replaced with somebody who was probably Hydra.
Me: Oh, there was no waiting patiently about it. We’ve been in here for the last 20 minutes. God, I hate Manhattan traffic. Wow, you really did stay up late to play with me.
“You were also drunk for most of the 1990s, the 1890s as well, in addition to the 1790s. It’s entirely possible, you were too busy with your cup to notice. Have you considered counseling?” Loki remarked.
Iron Dad: Even then, I tell you more than most people outside your father and the inner circle. For example, I’m not preventing Ana from giving you Stark pads full of the alternate history of the darkest timeline.
Me: You don’t need to be. I just survived Director Snookums giving me a polygraph on a machine designed to tell if Nat is lying through her teeth. But I’m not in Vault D so I passed, I think.
Me: Try the emoticons. You’ll be amazed what a guy’s willing to do for an all-expenses-paid weekend road trip with his girlfriend to the Maryland shore in the car of his choice.
Me: Okay, stop glaring. You’re adorable when you glare. I’ll be back in a few minutes. I need to go to the men’s room and I know there are snacks somewhere.
Tony: Just because something happened in one time doesn't mean that it will happen here. Too many bridges have been burned to ash.
Agent M: I figured you would rather deal with me then your old handler, who is not my boyfriend. But I can turn this phone over to him, if you prefer.
Nomad: You’re probably right. You’re probably more understanding of why Coulson did what he did because you’re a therapist. Tony’s therapist actually. Is he okay. Did something happen with his presidential meeting? Is that why you’re contacting me right after Friday did?
Captain Tight Pants: It's weird finding out that the grandkids of my friends from before are already dead.
Purple arrow 2023: Friday also sent them to Stark too because Ana told her to. I can hear the cursing from the air vents. He's not happy.
“However, time travel has consequences even if it seems like all sunshine and roses in Laura’s timeline. Except Flash and Peter might be dating." Tony shivered a little at the thought.
Morgan’s dad: You tell me. We will have time travel perfected. Your time heist can continue as planned. Although, please no more time kidnappings. Laura’s lovely, but still no.
Me: So far, badly. I will follow up tomorrow. The principal knows you. You served with his grandad, and because people don’t know that we kissed and made up, very literally, there is some bitterness.
Tony: That makes sense. Of course, I would choose the day of the invasion. My original wedding to Pepper was supposed to be the week after the invasion.
“But I think she is. Monkey lover really doesn’t like her and keeps mumbling things about backstabbing and killer robots. This is probably why he is in mental health rehab right at the moment?”
Chief mechanic: I didn’t have a sex life when we were at MIT. I was too young. Also, Sharon’s mom scared everyone away because she was a very protective pseudo-cousin.
Morgan’s dad: Robin is fine, by the way. She's mad that you left her with us. She also keeps drawing a picture of Scott coming out of the van as a baby. Is there something you need to tell me?
HSBF: You have to want to change and I’m proud of you for wanting to make that change. You’re a better person than Howard ever was.
Steve: I’m glad that version of you got a happy ending. I just wish you got the happy ending you deserve.
“Of course, Mr. Thompson.” Ana was only slightly annoyed with him. She switches to Eugene when she’s really upset. If they survive this, he is definitely changing his first name. And possibly his last name as well.
BITC: I can’t believe Benji is friends with him to the point that he will actually tell Flash that. Which is obviously a mistake if he told you. He’s probably sabotaging you on purpose.
However, I’m planning for there to be changes brought on by Tony and Steve talking to each other that may mitigate some of the awfulness. I’m taking the position that Accords or similar legislation is necessary, but the execution of such legislation could be problematic, depending on who’s actually in charge of enforcement. How do we create legislation that works for everyone? Is that possible with the current Accords or do they need amending? Are amendments even possible? Who is such legislation really protecting? We will explore these questions as the story unfolds.
“I don’t think it can be considered classified information if neither the director or Agent Coulson know about it,” Simmons nearly yelled.
“I am resigned. It’s not a shock because we always knew the arrangement would end if one of us fell in love with someone else. But she’s convinced I’ll never make a move on that person if I’m still married to her.”
“I assume you are the one called Skye. I see that Lady Sif was right about you.” Loki smirked at Daisy menacingly.
Virginia: I’m sure she would. I am 99% sure they are going to wake up and pretend it didn’t happen. It’s why I snuck in there and took a picture. Friday said they were being adorable.
“Don’t give me that look. Do you really think we’re going to be able to find all the infinity stones and then magically snap our fingers and bring everybody back?” Simmons asked bitterly.
StarkAE: A chaperone! Seriously, a fucking chaperone! I’m an adult. I’m pretty sure I can follow doctor’s orders without my assistant cock blocking me.
Purple Princess: You think they would have stopped after I kick their ass, but no. There are idiots. Oh shit.
We are still in the “Tony and Steve have their shit together” timeline. The next chapter will take place in the “bad choices were made” timeline. The new consultant is MJ, and Venom is Flash. Wonder how he got that nickname. For those of you that skipped over text messages from the Edge, MJ and Flash are friends who just happened to be crushing on the same guy. A guy who is oblivious to everything. They bonded over asshole dads. Flash’s father is abusive, and MJ’s dad abandoned her again the year before.
“I’ll manage. It’s—” Steve’s words faltered, confidence crumbling by the second, still monumentally confused by whoever JARVIS was.
“Right now? The closest connection to your past that you haven’t outright refused to see. Tony Stark, he’s got a home there. We’ve made the arrangements with his company’s CEO, a woman named Pepper Potts. She, uh. Wrangles him. You’ll like her plenty. I think the more you spend time—”
“You leave tomorrow at 0800. We’ll send a car for you,” Fury determined, pointedly moving on from the game they’d repeatedly played over the past three weeks: The one where he agreed not to pry too deeply, Steve agreed to not take off on the run, and things would be
Breathing was the hardest. He couldn’t move his chest, and he was sure there was still water from the Arctic in his lungs. It was worse than all the asthma attacks he used to have, worse than all the chest colds in the world bundled together. He thought he could hear himself wheeze, once. He wanted to raise his hand to his chest, to put pressure over the star of his uniform, over his heart.
Some new-age, artist-architect team had undoubtedly decided to take on the challenge of creating something so California it hurt, with its sloping, rounded white walls and floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the ocean. Steve wanted to hate it, wanted to keep his door shut and have Happy drive him back to the airport. But it was beautiful, and artistic, and intriguing enough that he found the courage to open the door, shouldering two of his duffle bags on one side, and his shield on the other.
Swallowing hard, Steve dragged his eyes from where Pepper had begun to show him a digital form to the source of the sharp tone: the billionaire was standing at the entrance to a staircase. Rather than dressing in a smart suit like he’d been the last time they’d seen one another, Tony was clothed in ragged jeans and a work shirt, both fabric and tanned skin littered with grease stains. The only thing messier than his clothes were his curls, mussed like he’d gone and stuck his finger in a light socket. His expression reflected the idea, obviously stunned the sight in front of him, a pretty crimson dusting high on his cheeks.
Phil. That was a name Steve actually recognized, and one that he was surprised to hear. Phil Coulson, one of Fury’s most trusted agents, had helped him settle into the tiny room he called home in SHIELD’s building. Showed him how to use his phone, introduced him to Natasha and Clint, two other agents who lived on sight. The knowledge that Phil approved this released a thread of tension in his shoulders, the same way it seemed to do to Tony, who frowned in thought.
turn to be stunned by the response. Lips parted, his eyes darted from Happy, to Pepper, to Steve. Even for him, it was hard to parse through the man’s expressions. But his heartbeat? He could hear that, loud and clear and pounding like hell.
Enough to wonder if the person who came out of the ice was someone entirely different than who he used to be. It was strange, to think he hadn’t smiled genuinely since 1945. It was even stranger to think that his normally cloudy disposition had been traded for downright stormy. The shrink —
Steve blinked for a moment, eyes darting to not-angel man. He could see the resemblance pretty easily, now that someone had pointed it out. The dark eyes. The angled jaw, but soft features. The way the grin was just a little lopsided, like Howard did when he said something he was proud of.
“With all due respect, let’s just get it over with then, Director. Ain’t got much else I can do here, if I’m just gonna be resting.”
“Look, Rogers. Believe it or not, it’s not every day we defrost supersoldiers after seven decades of being shut in the freezer. We’ve never had this happen before. It’s uncharted territory. But I think we both know there’s a level of normal we want you to be at. And I think we both know you’re not there.”
At that, Steve couldn’t help the instinctive bristle. He’d heard that line too many times before, standing in hospital hallways and Army tents and his ma’s living room.
Tony scoffed, as if a voice hadn’t just responded from the goddamn ceiling. “Everybody likes superheroes, J. None of that’s conclusive. I programmed you smarter than that, didn’t I? God, I swear— I’ll donate you to MIT. No,
“The world might have changed a lot while you were busy being a Capsicle, big guy, but I can guarantee it’s not changed enough to where you know more than a Stark. Master tactician or not, you’re in new territory. I’m not.”
Steve wasn’t ever one for believing in the whole, what-goes-around-comes-around rule. Sure, he’d believed in God when he was a kid, though the Bible stories never made much sense. They’d made him angry. God, the Old Testament, those prophets, it seemed like one long line of bullies after the next. Throwing around their own weight because they could, scaring everyone who was a little smaller, a little different, a little stubborn.
“You wanna try that again?” Steve hissed, his Brooklyn rough even thicker than normal. Anger tended to do that, Tony’d noticed.
He was alive, and he was in a makeshift hospital room with state of the art tech, probably set up in some swanky office building somewhere, if the sleek tile walls and streamlined machinery were to hint at anything.
No way in hell was Howard in— well, hell. Not when Howard was supposed to be safe. He had to be safe. They’d seen one another just that morning, the genius smirking above Steve in victory after successfully sneaking up on him and knocking him over with his own shield. Chattering about taking this one lady behind the bookshelf, and
Yeah, maybe not something to tell a fella who’d just crashed a damn bomb-filled plane into the middle of the ocean, hoping it’d make for a lack of news.
There were muffled noises around him, far away words and distant echoes that reminded him of those constantly-arguing neighbors on the other side of their bedroom wall in Brooklyn.
But man, the rest of the country had been something else. Rolling hills in the midwest, miles of corn and windmills. Cities, smaller ones than New York, but still huge. Chicago, Atlanta, Houston, Washington, D.C., Philly, Detroit. Tiny towns and suburbia and farms and the giant dustbowl of the west. He’d been through it all, whether it be the destination or part of the tour. Met all kinds of people. Put on a smile. Kissed babies and hugged wives. Tried to ignore the tears in their eyes as they spoke about their husbands who were off in Europe or the Pacific, promised through grit teeth and a lead tongue that their donations would help, even if all it really did was empty their pocketbook.
he interrupted, wagging the finger at the Captain’s scrunching face, “No, you are. Don’t lie. Captain America doesn’t lie. It’s fine. JARVIS freaks everybody out. But, still. The future’s different. And this house? My lab? Might as well be the goddamn church of the future. You’re
Yeah, Steve liked her. He offered a light smile, hands slipping into the pockets of his khakis while sneaking another glance at Tony, who had, coincidentally, decided to study a grease mark on his sneaker in that exact moment.
Then again. Who was he to back down from a challenge? Smirking, he tilted his chin upward. If Rogers was going to ask him out in such— such a
At least that seemed to get their attention. Sighing, eyepatch man stood up straight, casting a glance to his colleagues before speaking.
Besides, at this point? The only other person who knew his secret was a few hours upstate. And as much trouble as Peggy Carter caused, she was the one person he could count on to keep his secrets. Breathing out a slow sigh, he glanced down at the wad of bills Fury left him.
“Never said I was. Fury— he talked to me the other day. Said we needed to, uh. Either ‘punch it out or bang it out.’ This is a compromise.”
“Can’t argue with that,” Fury noted, before falling into a pointed silence — one that prompted more of an order to speak up than a suggestion. His eye was heavy on Steve before the man finally gave in. In the new century, it seemed, rather than Generals and Colonels demanding reports, super spies would sit in passive aggressive silence until the tension became unbearable. So, fine. He’d budge.
Steve opened his mouth to argue, almost offended at the notion that someone would be paying for him. But when Tony leaned forward across the table to plant a kiss on the man’s lips, filling the space where words were supposed to go with his own mouth, it replaced any argument the blond had with stunned silence.
A low fucking blow, coming from the one guy Tony had managed to somehow repulse, instead of attract. One might think that after three months of sleeping one floor apart, of sharing sweaty gym mats and coffee filters, he and Rogers might get along a little better.
“With you? Yeah, probably.” Pursing his lips, Fury seemed to shift in his chair, almost as if he were considering whether or not to say anything further. Ultimately, he did, one hand tiredly rubbing the back of his head. Steve wanted to ask him to stop while he was ahead, the nerves in his gut already shot. Whatever else the other man said, it wasn’t going to help. Nothing else had, so far.
“Hey, Miss Potts,” the security guard called out, sliding up behind her. It must have startled her, a weak laugh spluttering off her lips as she whipped around to face them.
“Course it is,” he grinned, teeth flashing mischievously. “Pep, if this blows up, it was your idea. JARVIS, put that on the record. And, if it, like, literally blows up, I’m blaming you when I have to recalibrate DUM-E,
“I’ll give you a, uh. Word of advice, for Stark. Bring a pair of headphones. He likes to play music at all hours. And, look. For God’s sake, don’t sleep with him.”
The truth was, he was scared. She’d married Gabe a handful of years after he’d gone into the ice. Had Gabe known her secret? After spending several years under the same roofs and in the same tents as Gabe, who slept and flirted with solely women, it was pretty obvious he didn’t have the same arrangement Steve and Peggy had: Despite the circumstances, play a couple, and dissuade others from looking too closely behind the curtains of either of their personal lives. And now, Gabe was gone, and Peggy was old, often unaware of her surroundings or who was taking care of her.
I know about you. But you don’t know the future. You need to trust me. It’s my territory, and at least let me inform your decisions. In the meantime, I can help you figure out living in the future.”
After two days with Loki, I really want to strangle him, but understand I may be food for the locals if I do so. We barely escaped that fate by working together. I used my powers to protect us, but he manipulated things, so we didn’t end up in the gladiator ring. Being the excellent liar that he is, somehow Loki managed to get us in the house of the ruler of the planet. This whole planet seems like a mix between Vegas and the Hunger Games.
StarkAE: I don’t even want to know how that was tested. Stefan is glaring at the phone right now. Actually, he wants to know if Melinda did the tests. Also, why wasn’t this all over the Internet after the data dump? That would definitely get rid of the hundred-year-old virgin rumors.
Agent 13, I doubt your presence would have changed their plan of attack except they probably would've attacked you as well. Actually, they would've attacked you first.
Me: Before that, his team recovered Agent Blake, right before the shield implosion, after he was paralyzed by a super powered person being mind fucked by Hydra. He blamed the superpower part, not the Hydra mind fucked part. Blake went on to create the Watchdogs and keep reaching out to old contacts. Patches was aware and decided to use it to his advantage because well Patches.
Red phone: I have no idea how she knew. It was never wise to question Aunt Peggy. She just knew stuff.
The new consultant: That’s also not reassuring, especially because I’m going to the Lighthouse and not the Avenger compound.
Tony: This is what you get for kissing someone that I changed the diaper of. I still want to hear the real version of your bio from you. Wikipedia is always horribly wrong and as we discussed earlier Howard liked to lie, a lot.
OK for the record, I would say in regards to the next question, that I’ve been crying in front of other people a lot more now; probably because of the medication. I cried while typing some of the stuff up mostly when thinking about Maria and Anna. A lot of that is still hard to deal with. As for crying in front of other people, there may have been more recent incidents, but I’m going with when I found out about what really happened to Benji and you were there, which was good, because I don’t like crying alone.
Thank you to everybody who read or review the last conversation. Before the pants can hit the floor, we have to have some adult conversations. So here we are. Because I was deprived of this in canon, we are so having this.
“I mean, I can understand…" Tony started to stammer, and Steve realizes that the man didn't understand the truth of his last statement. He doesn't want any more miscommunications between them.
“I was told to inform you that Ms. Romanoff is waiting for you on the helicopter pad.” He knew they were waiting. He had heard the Quinjet land. He just didn’t want to leave.
“Because Pepper is a goddess. I am trying to convince her to have your future baby. What do you think about Morgan? I want a Morgan.”
In hindsight, you made the right decision because being around me is always going to be dangerous. Maybe you needed some distance to protect yourself. I would never forgive myself if something else happened to you. You deserve more than to be collateral damage. Last time was already too much.
Me: Then I would say something that would just piss off Robert and I don't necessarily hate him anymore. He grows on you like a non-dangerous bacteria. He did send a very nice edible arrangement. It makes an excellent smoothie.
Me: We are just pulling up to the White House now and I have to get Lila out of her car seat. I have to go.
Also, note that these messages aren’t always being sent back to back. Sometimes there could be several minutes between replies. I don’t have the energy to do timestamps, so it is what it is. I know some people are using graphics for their text message stories but I think this format works better for screen reading software. As somebody who uses screen reading software, I want to make my writing as accessible as possible.
Tony: I’ll try, but my medical babysitter probably won’t allow it. But I promise to hold off on the fainting.
“No. I feel like whatever you’re going to tell me requires me to not be around any alcohol, including something as odious as Zima.”
He kept repeating those words in his head as they walked over to Tony until he ran into Happy and the agents bringing the luggage up to the rooms, quite literally. Mister Hogan was not happy to see him at all. He may have been called a few expletives and accused of being a homewrecker of all things.
CoulsonPJ: You could take his boyfriend down to the gym instead. Weren’t you going to have lunch with him? How did that go?
Anthony: Because the other option was already taken. I was going to send it from my Anthony Carbonell account. I use that account to follow all of my favorite food trucks and make snarky comments anonymously.
Red spider: That I don’t think Daisy and I were even together. She was the one who fought the Confederacy, and she ended up getting dusted when Thanos snapped his fingers.
Anthony: That could be enjoyable. I don’t know why, but I feel like you would enjoy choking. Probably because it happens way too often to you on missions. Do you have any kinks?
“If you’re a killer, then so am I. We’ve done a lot of questionable things to save the world. But we still save the world and we will do it again.” Even though he was mere millimeters from Leo’s lips at that point he wasn’t expecting the other man to close the gap. Yet, within seconds, Leo’s mouth was on his and everything else around him fell away.
Anthony: I know, but do you have any idea how much I would give to have one more conversation with Maria or even Howard for that matter?
TMNS: I was planning to do something this summer when we’re in Europe, although that may not happen now. There may not even be a trip anymore because of things I am probably not allowed to even put in a rapid Avenger message. I wish Tylenol still worked on me. I have such a bad headache right now.
Anthony: He also kind of hates Pepper’s new boyfriend and thinks you're some random charity worker I hooked up with after a mission, who is a total rebound. He’s just waiting for us to wake up and see it.
Tony: Although, how many years must pass for it to be appropriate for us to ask you to be our surrogate? You and Steve would make a cute baby together. I think Afia needs a little sister, we can call her Morgan. I would also be OK if you wanted to go with the Babylonian surrogacy method. As long as I could watch.
“Hey, do you want to take over driving? We should be approaching my favorite gas station in the next 20 minutes. I want to text Laura to see how operation get a therapist is going.” Because he probably shouldn’t let Friday keep driving for too long. Technically, AI drivers are a little illegal. They definitely have to get rid of those stupid accords.
Steve peers at you and then sighs. “The last time I was envious, it was the forties and Peggy was shooting at me. I gotta say I didn’t miss the feeling.”
“He doesn’t even…” Tony trails off. “He doesn’t even say any of those things to me. ‘I sure got the hots for ya’? Seriously?”
He’d get them back for it later, though. Right now was the time to have a rare lie-in and cuddle up to Tony —
“Pepper and I run a company that works almost exclusively now in the field of renewable, semi-infinite energy and Steve Rogers thinks my jokes are limited-supply
The shield was gone when he woke up. Steve had done his best not to hold onto it sentimentally as some last vestige of a bygone era and succeeded for the most part; but it was hard not to think of it as an extra limb or an extension of his arm, and thus he often found himself missing it sorely when scofflaws like Buck and Barton stole it for their frisbee games.
Scott Lang/ Ant-Man raises his hand. “If we were a deviation from some Prime Timeline I’m pretty sure I’d have felt it split. I’m all about that quantum stuff lately, thanks to Hank and Cross. Trust me, we
Strange inhales once. Twice. “The fact that Loki returned to Earth in 2016 instead of earlier or later means that the result of the butterfly flap, the
,” Stephen Strange says irritably through the swirling orange-rimmed portal. “Loki was both the butterfly and the hurricane.”
“Have you wanted him to?” you ask, hoping to get a question about Tony’s not-so-latent squishy feelings for the Captain (and vice-versa, apparently) in edgeways whilst Tony’s too distracted to lie.
FRIDAY helpfully brought up a video feed of the living room nearest the Hulk Timeout Corner. About twenty Lokis were flitting around stacking used boxes to form pillars around a mid-meditation Bruce. Tony started at someone roaring and knocking down a building in the corner.
“You called, dear brother?” asked Loki, materialising out of thin air, dressed in all black like one of the ‘goths’ Tony loved to relentlessly mock. “It is not as though I could defy your summons, of course; I do live to entertain you and obey your every whim, be it to bottle fame, brew glory, or even put a stopper in death…”
“How long have you been in love with him?” The question just slips out. A tactful interviewer you are not.
Tony gags in the background but plays straight man without further complaint. “I’m not your father,” he says, pointing a screwdriver at you. “I’m not,” he repeats to the camera.
A holographic projection of a TV screen erupts into being in front of Tony. CNN is the channel of choice today. The comely anchor (“A peach, but Everhart put me off journalists forever,” remarks Tony) wraps up yesterday’s headlines.
“Mother,” Loki forces out, bound and immobile in the kitchen surrounded by every Avenger on hand. “What is this device the nose-breaking creature has trained on me? Does it pretend to be a god-killer, vermin?” He sneers at you, obviously not your friend.
“Well, it’s good to know you’re keeping busy, you and DUM-E,” Captain Rogers mutters vaguely, duffel bag in hand, trying not to walk too fast out of consideration for your extremely slow flying abilities and DUM-E’s squeaky wheels, apparently. “Docu-what?”
The crow nips the Colonel’s ear in response. The Colonel feeds him a sunflower seed from his pocket.
Thor was poking at the microwave in the kitchen when Steve went in close to noon (he’d gone to bed again and had his desired lie-in but pined for Tony and resolved not to call him). “Hail, shield-mate,” he proclaimed. “Today is Laugardagr — ‘Saturday’ in your heathen tongue, though of course I should not like you to take any offence, as it is not
“Nah, I’ve just got an Ultimate Frisbee session with Wilson, Lang, and Romanoff in about twenty minutes in the NF gardens. Feel free to join.”
“Never you mind, Snivellus,” Tony says, gesturing at a ceiling camera, in all probability making FRIDAY upload the video to the Internet.
“She also says you don’t visit her any more, and asked me to fix you with my Disapproving Gaze as punishment. I dunno what that looks like, so I’m gonna —” Steve frowned in a
“Indeed. Tony — ah, Crow-ny — tries to cheer him up but there’s only so much Colonel Rhodes can do with bits of wire from Tony’s spare workshop projects.”
Dewey Blizzard’s smile is entirely fake now as he wipes away the soaked hair sticking to his forehead. “You’re absolutely right, Rich, freak lightning
Steve and Tony came apart, dazed, to find Natasha grimacing at them. “I wouldn’t cock-block you if I had any other choice, I promise.”
“It’s only my first time, Hawkeye,” you say. “Be gentle and help me ease into it; I mean my storytelling, of course.”
They continue to move together in a trance, the music a mere ornament for their movements. Everything else lies forgotten as the music builds up once again.
Steve tries to speak again, but Tony doesn’t move – so Steve takes his head in his hands and pushes him away a little. The super-strong bastard.
“I am going to try, though,” Steve continues. His eyes are determined as he speaks. “I am going to keep trying, again and again, until I manage to capture at least a spark of the very essence of you, and put it on paper. I’m going to do you justice.”
He’s not even sure he managed to say the name correctly, but the silence he gets in response is telling enough. He blinks two times more, then tries to sit up.
Then he’s being tossed on one side, hard, and it’s just the adrenaline pumping through Tony’s veins that keeps him from landing wrong on his hip.
Tony can’t focus for a moment, his heart skipping a beat, then another. He doesn’t have the strongest heart, alas, but he’s never been affected like this by loving words before. Again, he doesn’t know what to do.
He grumpily looks out of the windows as he waits for the traffic light to turn green. The streets are full of people trying to squeeze in some last-minute gift shopping. New York City has never been more alive.
“Hey, Tony.” Steve’s voice is gentle, and it’s closer to him now. Tony notices he’s been tapping his pencil on his notebook when Steve places his hand on Tony’s and the tapping stops.
Someone groans, probably Clint, and Tony loves them all very much, but right now the only person he can focus on is getting up and offering him a hand. Tony takes it and follows him.
Tosha: Because widows understand each other. Not that she was married to Fitz, they just created a marriage license to keep Alister the asshole from cashing in on all the James Leopold patents. They were engaged before he died anyway.
Anthony love: You’re the best Princess. Seriously, try to find out how he ended up the head of SI research and development. If it really happened.
Nomad: I’m glad that you trust me like that, but you’re going to have to change that until I’m back.
But we as a community had a very rough week. The loss of Chadwick Boseman hit the fandom hard as if it was a direct shot to our collective heart. He brought a character that we needed to life, but from all accounts, he was an amazing human being. It always hurts when we lose one more amazing human being, especially when cancer is involved.
HSBF: But like I said on one of the questions, you do learn from your mistakes. Do you want to go over a question or two tonight or let it go?
Tony: Yes, it actually happened. I have pictures. It’s been the only calming thing that I have found out in the last 24 hours.
Counselor Laura: A lot. I figured it out when you referred to Steve as an asshole. You still call him an asshole on a regular basis, but usually as “my asshole.” Honestly, I think it's one of your litany of pet names.
“So you decided not to tell him that I’m coming with you to Mumbai to tell him whatever the Princess told you that you don’t want him to deal with alone?” Natasha asked as soon as Tony put his phone down.
Steve: I think you may be right. Maybe you should try to get into her phone. You are the Director of Shield.
Nomad: You said that it wasn’t an issue, but this is not the first time you have mentioned being uncomfortable with someone significantly younger than you as your significant other. Is it going to be a problem?
“Actually, it was supposed to be Daisy, but she ended up staying in New York because Loki was going to show up earlier today. How did that go?” Steve asked.
The Mechanic: Yes. Super speed. It’s actually quite useful in the corporate world. Technically, she is an agent on detail to the Avenger Initiative or whatever bureaucratic jargon they’re using this week. I don’t pay attention.
A few things from Spider-Man: Homecoming, but the real fun in this chapter is seeing why things are different in this timeline.
Counselor Laura: It wasn’t the Winter Soldier. It was too much of a risk of triggering his memories and losing the asset. He was the last resort.
“I’m sure they mean something other than my ass.” Steve joked. He doesn’t want to think about his impending divorce.
“It is a good thing I’m not a stranger. We even cuddled in bed together last night. You are the best blanket ever. All warm and soft. I like that about you. I bet you have always been a cuddler.” Jokes were his best weapon of defense right now.
Anthony: I just have to say I would do so much better. You wouldn’t even be able to remember your name when I’m done with you.
There are no spoilers for Endgame in this chapter or the next one. The one after that does has a tiny allusion to something from the movie that won’t make sense until you watched it. The final chapter will have very small references to both Captain Marvel and Endgame. But again you won’t see it unless you have watche the movie.
For those of us who remember the Agents of Shield/ Winter Soldier convergence I'm going to try to avoid that by giving everybody a little more time than three days to watch the movie. Also, I'm going to try to write things so major plot points will not be given away, at least not until August. That part of the story will be written from Tony’s perspective so it shouldn’t be too hard. I promise to label the chapters when we get there and I'll also be adding Spider-man to the tags.
"I wish it could wait, but unfortunately some things in life actually have deadlines even for people with my resources and the wedding venue is one of those things. BTW, I'm still mad I can't be there because the president decided that Coulson should be the ATCU representative, not me." That was because everybody knew that he was dating Steve and have for a while. Fuck you, Christine Everhart. So he had to stay hands-off with the negotiations to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest, but thankfully he had a good team.
“Okay, mid-30s, before the Afghanistan enlightenment. But that was still a decade ago. Although, even at that point, I was starting to slow down. Despite the rumor I started myself, I didn’t sleep with most of the 2007 Maxim cover girls. Also most of the all nighters I have pulled during the last decade have involved the workshop or super villain chasing. I hate super villain chasing,” Tony quipped.
Red phone: I left Agent Scary in charge of the interrogation. I'm out here texting my text message boyfriend to calm myself down. And I just discovered his favorite color is lavender. Which explains so much despite the fact that I don't think I've seen him wear it once.
Hunter: I speak as your nanny, personal assistant, and bodyguard; you are very bad at retirement. I even know about your side businesses.
Director Stark: Which explains why Agent Piper hasn’t checked in. Ana still should’ve said anything, and she’s not responding at all, my Ana anyway. The secret Avengers version has made contact. Why is my AI not responding?
“No, I understand why you want that. I will say fix things with us. The reason why I waited so long was I thought it would be harder than what it actually is,” Tony confessed.
"Because of the Clint announcement, she was in DC when Ned finally got a hold of her and told her that Peter was going rogue. From what I gathered from Agent Agent, they arrived after the fight was done, but before the cop showed up." Tony told his boyfriend as he snuggled in a little closer.
Me: Don’t worry about it. I don’t think she’s going to stop by anytime soon considering she blames me for what happened.
Melinda: That explains why she lost consciousness. Finding out your children are essentially dead would make anybody lose consciousness.
Me: Better than your billion dollars suits. You written Laura? I’m sure she’s not going to completely abandon you because her husband’s back. You are friends.
Tony: Oh good she can help with the ethical dilemma which is: let Radcliffe keep developing his android for the alleged greater good or tell the Director what’s going on with Aida and put a stop to it.
Purple Arrow: I didn’t know about the adoption. I’m not here a lot, and maybe they didn’t want to mention their kid around me.
“In an effort to be honest with each other, I should tell you that other Tony had Aunt Peggy exhumed and found out that it wasn’t really Alzheimer’s but a Hydra drug-induced version of it." That was the only Hydra-related intel that Friday put in his primer, probably because it was family-related.
“Well, you can always tell him that it wasn’t as badly damaged as you initially thought. Also not as much of a friendship as you initially thought.”
The New Consultant: Not exactly. It’s complicated. I’m checking with Ana to see how much I can tell you.
Anthony: May Parker is the guardian of one of our recent September Foundation recipients that has been assigned to be my personal intern for the 2016- 2017 school year. She invited me to dinner to show her gratitude and I’m not that much of an ingrate that I would say no. That’s it. No scandal here. Please respect the privacy of her and her nephew.
Nomad: I’m telling you to be safe. Remember, I have different standards when it comes to the people I care about.
“The kids are worth it. I got to make pizza with the kids before we drove out to the private jet. There was a lot of crying.”
Person that cares about my boss: So Tony being behind closed doors with the president and small children is the reason why he can’t reply to any of my messages or explain to me what he meant by me knowing agent Melinda May in the biblical sense?
Thank you to everyone who read or reviewed the last chapter. It’s time for another break from Tony/Steve banter, but not drama for Steve and Clint time.
