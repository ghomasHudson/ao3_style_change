She took a step back, going deathly quiet as she looked over him. "Peter." she said quietly. "What...are you wearing?"
The silence in the room was deafening. Tony looked like he was about to explode, torn between being angry and concerned when Natasha spoke up.
"What's -?" Peter started and one of the security people shot him a look. He silenced himself immediately and swallowed hard.
He jumped to his feet, scrambling as he whirled to Peter. "Wh-what?" he stuttered, eyes wide. His chicken wrap was on the ground but he could care less.
"Peter got an internship offer at MIT about six months ago," May whispered suddenly and Peter choked a little. "I just couldn't afford it."
Peter's wings were as fluttery as his personality. They were a flurry of different colors and seemed to change whenever he moved. They seemed to make him more hyper-active and Steve found that it was fun whenever Peter hung around with the Avengers. And that was only on the weekends because he still lived with his aunt but their weekends were always more exciting with Peter.
Natasha smiled, chuckling a little. "Well English is a very pretty language too, especially when it comes out of your mouth," Natasha leaned over to press a small open-mouthed kiss to Pepper's lips who hummed in response.
Before Tony could respond, Pietro interrupted, "Wanda, he's a billionaire. Of course he can pay for all of this."
The first two members were obviously Natalia and Bucky. He found other members of the one-oh-seventh that promised to help him. Dum Dum Dugan, Jim Morita, Junior Juniper, James Montgomery Falsworth, Gabe Jones, Jacques Dernier, Happy Sam Sawyer, and Pinky Pinkerton. They named themselves the Howling Commandos.
She spits something in Russian, which he's pretty sure isn't an endearment, and puts the soup bowl down with a clang.
They all hang out for a while, making small talk and keeping conversation light, and Tony is content to listen and chip in a smart ass comment every now and again, taking it all in and letting his body relax. The team eventually leaves to eat and rest, and Tony is left with Pepper and Rhodey. Rhodey has taken Thor's spot near Tony's shoulder and Pepper's in the chair Clint vacated, and the moment Tony turns to her her eyes fill up and she's hiccuping back little sobs.
Someone choked on air behind him. He could practically hear the delighted grin in Tony's voice when he said, “Wow, way to give us away, Cap. I could've –“
Tony nodded, his stomach tensing a little in anticipation. Steve had said electrical stimulus, and Tony wasn't sure what it was going to feel like –
“And if I ask for nothing more than this?” Steve didn't know what kind of answer he expected, but it wasn't for Tony to look even more delighted, his eyes fixed so firmly on Steve that it felt as if he were looking right through him. It was heady to be the center of someone's attention like that.
Steve's eyes went dark and Tony felt a sliver of excitement run down his spine when Steve's lips tilted up in a grin that was still ripe with satisfaction from their previous round. "I wouldn't expect anything less."
“Yes,” he said immediately, and she smiled, running her hand up his cock with a feather-light touch that still made him thrust up into her grip with a gasp.
It took a long time for Steve's breaths to even out, but Tony didn't push him to talk. His curiosity was killing him, and the tension in their silence made him want to tear his hair out, but if Tony had learned anything about Steve in the time that they'd been together it was that Steve sometimes needed a little peace and quiet to parse through his thoughts before he told Tony what was –
Tony rolled his eyes, but obediently shrugged into the robe he'd left on the side of the room right before the stream started. “We made ten grand in three hours. A thank you would be nice.”
“Hey.” Tony's hand came up to stroke his cheek, and Steve wanted to cry because Tony looked so kind and understanding for all the wrong reasons because Steve was too much of a coward to tell him the truth – “It's okay. We don't have to.”
Tony looked up to see none other than prince T'Challa sitting down next to him, clad in some sort of traditional suit. To his left were two African women who looked as beautiful as they looked deadly, their hands clasped around what Tony could only assume was some kind of disguised weapon. Tony had to fight not to react when another two sat down on his right, next to Happy and Pepper. Well, that wasn't threatening at all.
“Did you have a good flight?” Tony asked through a mouthful of rigatoni and Steve smiled in relief at the question. Tony could relate.
“No,” Tony said, plucking that thread of doubt by the root. “You were perfect. I'll tell you if you say something I don't like.”
to.” Steve surged up to kiss Tony, pouring all of his need and affection into it, and after a moment Tony's hands came up to grab his neck, urging him even closer as Tony gave back as good as he got. They only pulled apart when they were both panting, but Tony's eyes were still filled with a heartfelt concern that Steve tried to wipe away by swiping both thumbs over Tony's cheeks and pressing another kiss to his mouth. “I want you, Tony. I promise.”
He wasn't surprised when he was pulled aside by security who did a preliminary check for weapons before they waved him through to the front desk where Steve tried to force a smile at the pretty, blonde secretary looking at him with expectant eyes.
“Good boy.” Tony scrolled through the selection, his eyes catching on a bright pink bottle that said 'Preggo Juice'. “So how does this work? Do I put it on before sex or –“
Tony rolled his eyes. “Yes, mother.” He grinned when Steve leaned down to nuzzle his bonding gland, kissing the mark he’d left there on their one-year anniversary. “This is going to be amazing. You’ll see.”
“Still okay?” Tony asked quietly, and Steve nodded, looking more than a little tense. Well, Tony was going to do his best to change that.
“That's been established, yes,” Tony said with no small amount of amusement. “Steve, what's this about?”
Tony gasped, hand slapping against the shower wall to hold him upright as his orgasm caught him completely off guard, rushing up on him so fast that his legs buckled. He winced when his knees hit the floor, his cock still jerking in his fist as he rode through the aftershocks, muscles feeling like jelly as he came down from the most intense high he'd had in a while.
Steve's eyes were dark when she pushed her hands underneath the lapels of his jacket, sliding it down his arms until he was just in his shirt and tie which she got her hands on next, loosening it with a well-practiced tug before she slid it up over his head.
“Yeah, um. Nat,” she said quietly, and Natasha waved a hand towards Vision, not batting an eyelid. Vision pointed at Bruce who gave Steve a sheepish smile, and Steve put his hands on his hips as he nodded.
He screamed again, and for a second Steve thought he would choke on the lump in his throat, his stomach churning with something he couldn't even put a name to.
Toni snorted, kicking him with the toe of her nine-inch Pleaser boot. “Nice try, jailbait. You're way too young for me.”
“Hey, it's okay,” Tony said, still in that soft voice, and Steve shook his head, taking a shaky breath.
Steve sighed, pulling his finger out and wiping it on the towel. It was pointless. The doll was a nice substitute for some things, but it couldn't replace actual human connection, least of all being intimate with someone. For a second Steve felt almost desperately lonely.
“Wait,” he choked out, and Tony pulled back immediately, looking at him with concerned eyes. “What's wrong?”
“Your sketchbook?” Tony scoffed. “What, did you write Steven Stark in a bunch of hearts? Fuck, that sounds terrible, now there's another reason –“
“It's called a hysterical paroxysm.” Steve's hand moved underneath the table. “Hold on, I'll just turn this off, then I can –“
“There you are. Okay, look, I'm sorry it took me a moment to... you know, process, but this isn't the worst thing in the world.”

“Yeah?” Tony croaked, pressing his head back into the cushions when Steve did it again, flexing his thighs to push his cock all the way in. “Fuck. Just like that.”
Steve screamed, his legs jerking on either side of Tony's head before they started shaking uncontrollably as his back arched and his head snapped back –
Huh. “Alright then,” Tony said, reading the paper one more time for good measure, flipping it over to check for any sign of tempering or an unfortunate footnote, before he signed his name with a flourish. “There. You want me to make it out to you? Or any of your buddies here?”
He didn't wait for an answer before he grabbed Steve's arm and dragged him into the elevator, mashing the button for their floor. Steve chuckled.
“Oh,” she said again before she cleared her throat and smiled. “Congratulations are in order then? When did you come home?”
“Shh,” Steve said, and Tony felt his chest hitch in response, wetting the corners of his eyes. “It’s okay. I’m here.”
“Aye aye, Sir,” Tony said cheekily, and Steve pinched his thigh in reprimand as he turned towards the TV. A few minutes later Tony couldn't have told you what was happening on screen to save his life, way too focussed on Steve's hardening cock against his back, the way his breathing was slowly but surely picking up speed.
Steve gave a tight, jerky nod as he shifted his weight, praying to god that nobody noticed how hard he was in his jeans. There weren't all that many people at the station, but if someone happened to look they'd definitely –
“Nice fella,” Obie said blandly, and Tony hummed, focussed on setting one foot in front of the other. “You do seem more relaxed. It's a nice look on you.”
This time he managed not to flinch when Tony made a noise, but his neck still prickled uncomfortably. God, logically he knew it was okay now, that no one would arrest them for what they were doing – in the comfort of their own home no less – but still...
Steve's mouth dropped open, but before he could move past his astonishment, Tony stepped up on the bed and started jumping on it in full view of the window, still completely naked.
“Urgh,” he said intelligently, shuddering when Steve suddenly bit his gland, the gentle pressure releasing even more of that soothing smell – holy shit, was that him?
“Hey,” Steve said and Tony suddenly noticed that his hands were trembling where he was holding on to Steve, his body gone stiff. “Hey, it's okay.”
No, being in love with Tony was far from the worst thing in the world. Steve would know. He'd been doing it for more than five years now.
New chat! There will be a bunch of those littered around the story, so I hope you'll enjoy this one! Also, did YOU know Peggy's funeral took place in London? Because I didn't remember that until I rewatched the movie. Thanks for reading!
“A long list of ill-advised choices,” Tony said with a grin, leaning back to pull his dick out of the mess between them. “Come on. We can finish this in –“
Steve's eyes twinkled as he mirrored Tony's pose, a playful smile on his lips. “You want to skip the movie and take me to bed instead?”
“Gotta protect these fuckers, right? I put that in all of my helmets. It's perfectly safe.” He grinned. “Just thought you might appreciate the view, is all.”
this had been. He'd bonded Steve without knowing any of the consequences, without even asking for his permission. Tony had taken advantage of him, claimed him in a way that may be irreversible, and now they were stuck like this,
The sound was getting louder now, and Tony squirmed at the sudden feeling of a tongue on his neck, tracing circles into his bonding gland that felt white hot somehow, shocking enough that the sensation pulled Tony's brain into consciousness.
, rubbing against Tony's stomach, and even that bit of friction felt like almost too much as waves of pleasure surged through him every time Tony's cock hit his prostate. He had no idea how he hadn't come yet, but for some reason that feeling of tension building in his gut just kept going and going until Steve thought he would go mad with it, his heart pounding so hard that he seriously thought it might give out on him.
“Not when we're working, I know.” Tony kissed his neck and Steve felt the contact like an electric current zinging through his body. “But we're not, are we? You're on your way home and I'm not even here. Perfect time to have some fun.”
Steve put down his spoon with a sigh, rubbing a hand over his eyes. “I don't know. He said I should keep my head down, but he didn't tell me what the problem was.”
For a second it almost felt like he was standing on the edge of a cliff, watching his foot hover over the abyss.
“We're not married,” Steve said, a crooked smile stretching his lips. “I guess that means I'll have more time to spend with you, huh?”
“That's true,” Tony said, folding his hands on the table. “But not trusting Ross and not supporting the Accords are two very different things.”
, his cock spearing him open and rubbing directly against his prostate. He didn't know what kind of sound he made at that, only that it made Steve's cock throb inside him as he set a rough but still steady pace, fucking Tony effortlessly.
He keened when she started stroking him for real, stripping his cock mercilessly as she dug her teeth into the side of his neck, tugging his hair
“Okay,” Steve rasped out, steeling himself as he gripped the toy tighter. The first stroke already bordered on too much, the way the silicone squeezed his cock so reminiscent of how Tony’s ass felt around him that it stole his breath away.
The food looked amazing. It tasted even better and Tony was grateful to have something to do with his hands while his thoughts chased themselves around in circles.
Steve did, his hands trembling as he touched the edges of Tony's jaw to guide him forward, his fingers tracing the soft hair there. He could hear his own heartbeat in his ears, pounding desperately as his whole body lit up with joy, almost overshadowed by the overwhelming relief that Tony felt the same, oh my god, Tony
“Later then.” Tony snuggled closer, feeling something deep in his gut settle as he breathed in Steve's familiar smell. “No sleeping yet. We should make the most of this.”
“Look, you and Tony, you're always better together. If you can face this as a united front I'm sure it'll be alright.”
Steve let out a heavy breath, his face twisting before he shook his head and gave Tony a small smile. “Alright. But you’ll take the armor along. And I want JARVIS there to monitor everything.”
“Worse than being hexed into loving me?” Tony asked dubiously, something unreadable in his eyes, and Steve tried to keep his cheeks from heating up. He had a feeling he failed.
Steve made a low noise, leaning down to press a kiss to the back of Tony's head. “It's not true, Tony. Whatever he said you were, that's not who you are. I want to hear you say it.”
Steve let out a heavy breath, dropping his bag although the nervous tension in his body refused to let him sit back down. “It's okay if you don't feel the same way. I never expected you to.”
“It's, um –“ Steve cleared his throat, waving his hand lamely. “You're uh. A bit louder than I'm used to. That's all.”
And Steve shouted, fucking up into him with a jerky thrust as he writhed against the pillows, his thighs trembling so hard Tony could feel it against his ass. He dropped hard onto the mattress when he was done, his chest heaving as Tony stared at him unblinkingly, his mouth suddenly dry.
“Look, just –“ Tony jerked, trailing off into a grunt when the plant tugged at his boxers, sliding them down his legs. “Oh wow. Okay, here we go...”
His mouth would probably be bruised by the end of this, but god, did Tony not care when what he got was Steve kissing him so hard he could feel it in his toes, their tongues tangling as they tried to make the other submit. It was messy and sloppy and so good that Tony was almost buzzing with excitement, his cock stirring where it was pressed against his thigh.
Steve almost swallowed his tongue when Tony did it again, rubbing him furiously for a couple of seconds before stopping abruptly. The rattling of the car around them completely covered the noise that Tony's hand made on the fabric, but if he kept this up Steve sure as hell wasn't going to be able to keep quiet.
,” Tony hissed, giving up any pretense of a civil conversation. “But unlike those soldiers you claim to care for so much I wasn't sent there by a bunch of warmongering bigwigs who wipe their ass with the very same people they bring up every time they want money or tools for their cause.”
“More like six or nine,” Natasha said under her breath, but Tony ignored her as he darted back into the common room and dragged all of their spare pillows out of the cupboard. “Hey, those are for movie night!”
Well, that just made Steve angry. “You're not too much. Or too loud,” he said firmly, and Tony raised an eyebrow at him.
“Tony,” Steve said and Tony gasped out a curse, pulling back just enough to see Steve's face. His cheeks were bright red, hair matted with sweat, and Tony felt a wave of pure
Yeah, yeah, Tony. So much for not being a mentor. If you know the reference in the chapter title, I love you. I hope you enjoy this one!
Tony sucked in a breath before his back bowed as he came like a shot, completely blindsided by the rush of pleasure that swept through him. He yelped, clutching at Steve's arm with both hands as he rode it out with a few desperate jerks of his hips, breathing out heavily when he finally came down.
“Gonna come?” Tony mumbled, and Steve squeezed his eyes shut because yes, he was, and he could already tell he wouldn't be able to stop it –
Steve never lasted long in rut, but Tony was still surprised when Steve's muscles locked up not even a full minute later, his cock jerking back and forth inside him as his knot swelled and tied them together, his breath hot enough to burn against Tony's neck.
“Tony, this is –“ He gasped when Tony's nails scratched over his skin as he dragged his hand up to push it underneath the back of Steve's shirt. “We shouldn't –“
Steve turned his head just enough to look at him. “But that's not it, is it? We both know I'm bigger than you.” He smiled. “You wanted me to say that you're
“Yes,” Tony ground out as he picked up the pace, trying desperately to rub up Steve's entire length. He could feel the curve of Steve's smile against his neck.
,” Steve sobbed, his entire body trembling as he wrapped himself around Tony, squeezing his cock between their bodies as if that would help – “Oh god, I
And the thing was, Steve knew it was true. Tony would give up this part of their relationship, this part that Steve and everyone who read the tabloids knew was something he enjoyed very much, just so he could make Steve happy. He would sacrifice that much.
to do it,” Steve said, giving him an apologetic look. “But – now that some of us have signed it's –“
“I fucking love your mouth,” Tony sighed, and the words, spoken so brazenly, made heat rush straight to Steve's cock. “Wanna pick up where we left off?”
It took a second for Tony to process the command, but as soon as he did he fumbled for the buttons of his shirt, ripping it up over his head and squirming out of his pants. Being naked when Steve was fully clothed never failed to send a thrill down his spine, and it didn't this time either. Tony sat back on his haunches, keeping his head lowered until Steve pulled him to his feet, patting his spread thighs.
Toni wished she could deny the way her heart was trying to pound out of her chest as she looked at him. “It's a phase. Trust me. You can find plenty of experienced women your own age.”
“Another blanket?” Natasha asked him at one point, raising an eyebrow as she watched Tony carry his loot through the common area. Tony wasn't really listening, already thinking up all the ways he could ambush Steve into cuddling on the couch with him, maybe get a little frisky under this blanket – “Are you nesting in his room too, or what?”
Steve swallowed around the lump in his throat, tearing his eyes away from Tony's exposed skin. “JARVIS, what do you have on the plant? Is it flammable? Can we cut it? Anything?”
“No, I – I have. It's just –“ He took a shaky breath, covering the hand she still had on his thigh with his own. “I know what comes after. And I haven't –“
I regret to inform you that due to time constraints and a lack of approval from the UN the panel has chosen to reject your proposed changes to the draft. As of today the Accords are finalized and their collocation has become binding. I'm afraid the time to revise these guidelines has passed.
Tony froze, his head snapping up at the familiar tone, and Steve eyed him for a long moment before he sat on the couch and pointed at his feet.
“Okay,” he said hoarsely, looking down at the two translucent sheets to avoid Tony's knowing grin. “Are you sure that glass is the best idea for this?“
“Yeah,” Steve said hoarsely, stroking his hand through Tony’s hair when Tony melted into his embrace, already halfway off to sleep. “Next time.”
Tony laughed, and Steve smiled proudly before he turned to the stove to heat up some water. He took a deep breath, trying to calm himself because he could already feel arousal thrumming deep in his stomach just from the implication of having Tony here, alone, at night, after they'd both just enjoyed a nice evening together.
For a second Steve didn't get it, but then his cheeks heated as he pulled off Tony's cock and coated his fingers with lube.
, and Tony chuckled at the noise Steve made when he pulled back, fingers teasing at the waistband of Steve's pants.
“Oh, I'm sorry, who was it that told me to –“ Steve abruptly broke off when Tony tugged on his hair, leaning down until their mouths were barely an inch apart.
Steve could feel his throat close up with a mixture of dread and desperate hope when Tony opened the faceplate, his expression unreadable.
Steve nodded, but the nervous edge was back in his eyes. “Is she – I mean, will she be there, when...”
Because he couldn't stop kissing Tony. Most days they ended the night making out on his couch until they were both red-faced and hard in their pants. And Steve wanted – god, he wanted so desperately to just sink to his knees and take Tony's cock in his mouth, but he couldn't bear the thought of seeing Tony's face when he realized that he couldn't reciprocate. That Steve was so broken that normal sex was impossible with him. He didn't want Tony to be disappointed.
Tony kept his face carefully blank even though he could feel his heart pounding in his throat. “I don't know what you're implying.”
“Not one for sweeping gestures? That's alright, not everyone's into chivalry,” Tony said, trying to lighten the mood, and luckily Steve took a deep breath and gave him a smile that looked a little less tense this time.
Or – and this was a scary thought – Tony really was sick. What if his thoughts actually were... unnatural? Would this so-called treatment change who he was? The way he acted?
“That's me,” Tony heard himself say, and his heart stuttered when the alpha smiled at him. Good god, he was gorgeous. Dr. Yinsen hadn't mentioned that.
“Wouldn't dream of it,” Tony said innocently and grinned when Steve swatted at him. “Hey. Spousal abuse.”
“Sometimes. It's –“ Steve swallowed hard. “They're less sensitive than my cock after – since the serum. So I have to really – yeah.”
Tony looked at him for a long moment before he pressed a kiss to Steve's cheek and let go of his cock, guiding him forward with a hand on the small of his back. “You're adorable. Go on, put it in.”
“Tony,” Steve rumbled, and Tony felt his voice deep down in his core, making his heart pound even as his chest swelled with warmth. “What – why are you –“
The trial of James Barnes, formerly known as the Winter Soldier, has drawn a lot of attention, not just in New York but all over
He was headed straight home after a grocery run when the trodden down path next to the main road caught his eye. He tilted his head up into the rays of the midday sun and decided that today seemed like a nice day for a bath. Sure, he still had rainwater collected at home, but why waste valuable water when he knew there was a pond not even two miles from here.
The general laughed. “Indeed we did. Though I have to say, you made much more of an impressive exit. I saw the footage. You really built that thing in a cave?”
Steve wasn't stupid. He knew that Tony would expect something to happen. But so far Tony had always let Steve set the pace and never pressured him into anything. Honestly Tony was the most patient man he had ever known.
“Don't act like you didn't see this coming,” Steve said with more confidence than he felt, and Tony chuckled darkly.
“Did you come on my face?” Tony chuckled when Steve pinched him in the side, feeling Steve's skin heat up as he kissed him on the cheek. “I bet you did. Did I open my mouth for you? Catch it on my tongue?”
The strange thing was, despite Tony walking up to him when they were both naked – Steve believed that. “Then why did you come talk to me?”
“Whatever you say,” Steve said nonchalantly, and Tony couldn't resist whirling around and dragging Steve close with both arms around his neck to lay one on him, quick and dirty. By the time he pulled back Steve looked more than a little dazed, and Tony grinned smugly as he pulled out of his arms, twinkling his fingers over his shoulders as he walked off.
“Then why has Mr Barnes' presence been kept under wraps for so long? Didn't the public deserve to know he was alive?”
This is officially what that showdown looked like now xD Thank you so much for this, Hemmi. I love you so much <3
Tony slumped in defeat, pulling away to wipe a hand across his face. “It’s nothing. I… There was a general and he said some shit. That’s all.”
Clint's eyes narrowed at the challenge before his lips twisted into a smirk as he leaned back in his seat.
Still, he brought his smile back in full force as he sauntered over to Steve and went to his knees in between Steve's spread legs. He swore he could hear the way Steve swallowed heavily, his thighs stiff as a board where Tony was holding on to them.
“Yeah,” Bucky said, never one to sugarcoat things. “I'm sorry, Stevie. I know this is hard for you.”
“You just wait right here,” Tony said when they were finally both naked before he jogged over to one of the desks, digging around in its drawers until he emerged with a triumphant sound and a bottle of lube in his hand. Steve wasn't even surprised.
“Yeah?” Steve fumbled his pants open, pulling his cock out through the flap and just holding it for now. “How does it feel?”
He could already feel that tension low in his stomach again, coming on a lot more quickly this time. Tony clenched his hands into fists, pushing himself up off the table just enough to get some room to move, thrusting against the warm metal on his cock. It felt obscene, but despite Tony's lewd actions the doctor just kept sitting there staring at his desk, so Tony took it as incentive to keep going. It felt way too good to stop anyway.
“Steve,” he gasped and felt Steve stiffen behind him, his thrusts becoming short and jerky before he stilled just enough to push his knot back inside him. The sudden stretch where Tony was still loose and open from before felt like a punch in the gut, and from one breath to the next Tony was coming, thrusting hard into Steve's fist to ride through the shocks of pure feeling that rushed up and down his spine, taking his breath with them.
Tony regarded the doctor curiously, honestly taken aback. He'd expected questions about his medical history, maybe even about the misbehavior that Obie had mentioned. Not this. “Um. Well, I got up. I showered. Met some alphas.” He shrugged. “That's basically it. And afterwards Obie dragged me here, so I haven't done anything else.”
“Okay, let's calm down, everyone,” Natasha said, putting a hand on Tony's shoulder. “Why are we here, Steve?”
Him and Steve had spent most of the time lazing around, watching TV and occasionally fucking on every available surface of the cabin. It was a very nice change to their daily lives where they were lucky if they had the time to sleep in the same bed for a whole night.
You will find your mission briefing in the document attached. Sudan will be signing the Accords in the following week, after which we will be able to provide you with a wider field of resources. The director of SHIELD has already been made aware of the need for large-scale surveillance in order to catch this criminal.
“Make them red this time,” Natasha called after him as the doors closed and JARVIS brought him up to Steve's floor while Tony bounced on his feet in excitement.
“Okay,” Steve said quietly, and Tony pulled him into a real kiss, already tasting hints of rut pheromones on his tongue. His toes curled in anticipation, but Steve pulled away before things could get too heated.
He could see the way Tony's shoulders slumped with relief before he straightened up and nodded at the rest of the team. “Well? Chop chop, hawkass.”
“Toni,” he said, like a prayer, and she bent down to kiss him, pulling back when he jolted in her arms, his breath catching on a moan. “
He looked down at the thing Natasha dropped into his palm, raising an eyebrow as soon as he saw what it was. “Chapstick? Really?”
“Did Dr. Yinsen not tell you?” Tony shook his head, and Steve sighed, giving him a rueful smile. “I'm sorry, I assumed that he would have told you about the procedure. Allow me to explain.”
But as Tony writhed in the plant's bonds, obviously enjoying its touch, the green contrasting beautifully with his tan skin – fuck.
Tony was close already, his cock raw and throbbing where he was pumping it through Steve's fist, still woefully short of where he wanted to reach. He could do it, he knew he could. He'd done it before, fucked his cock all the way up the length of Steve's, made him feel it.
They got the remaining two hundred bucks in under two minutes, and Tony swooned, clutching the paddle to his chest. “Aww, you guys are too good to me. Okay, let's all count together.” Tony sat up on his haunches as he turned his back to the camera and rubbed the paddle over his asscheeks. “Left first or right first? Dealer's choice.”
“Will do,” Tony said, and Steve nodded at Obie one last time before he disappeared back down the hall. Tony found himself staring after him until Obie turned him away, leading him out of the clinic.
“And that's why they fall for her like flies.” Clint shook his head. “Cougars, man. You know the first time I had sex was with a woman twice my age?”
“I know, it's okay,” Tony rasped out, moaning as he reached down to squeeze the base of his cock until he could come on Steve's knot. When he opened his eyes Steve was staring right at Tony's hand, a groan tearing from his throat as his hips twisted, trying to get his cock even deeper.
“Fuck, of course, come on –“ Tony pushed himself up onto his knees, wrapping an arm around Steve's neck for balance as he reached behind himself to finger himself open – only to gasp when Steve suddenly shoved two fingers inside, barely meeting any resistance. “Holy shit –“
“Holy shit,” Tony breathed, feeling that familiar tingle zing up his spine, a restless itch just under his skin that would quickly turn into an all-consuming burn... “I'm in heat.”
“Better now?” he asked gently, and Steve nodded with a relieved sigh, finally relaxing as he made it through the endorphin rush.
“Steve, hey,” he said gently, and this time Steve let him turn around just enough to see the side of his face where he had buried it in Tony's neck. “You okay? What happened?”
expand, stretching around nothing, and when he lowered his head he could see his walls clenching down on the clear silicone –
Steve's eyes were impossibly soft when he pressed another kiss to Tony's lips, never breaking eye contact or halting his pace. “I love you.”
“What'd everyone bet?” she asked as she plopped down on the couch next to Natasha, kicking off her shoes to put them in her lap. She pouted when Natasha shoved them off without even looking.
“Okay,” Tony said, pushing down the frisson of panic in his gut as he frantically searched for the vibranium cuffs, grabbing them from the bedside table and kneeling next to where Steve was curled up on the bed. “You need to lie on your back, Steve. Spread your arms out, come on.”
“Jesus fucking Christ,” Tony hissed, walking around to Steve's backside, and Steve sucked in a breath when he felt Tony's fingers on his ass, spreading him open. “
So really, no one could fault him for taking the steps four at a time when FRIDAY announced Steve's safe return after seventy-two days of radio silence, during which Tony had seriously considered grabbing his suit and searching the entirety of Guatemala to bring Steve back in one piece. Fury was lucky that Tony had a bare minimum of self-control.
“Oh,” he said stupidly before need took over and he rutted against Steve, high on the relief that he'd finally done it, he could make Steve come –
“Oh god, oh god, oh god,” he kept babbling, his voice raising in pitch when Tony grabbed his balls with his other hand, squeezing them gently as he twisted his palm around the head of Steve's cock. “
“That's gross,” Steve said, wrinkling his nose as he pulled the fabric away from his skin. “You're such a dick.”
It's time for everyone's favorite person in this series ;) Things will get a lot more interesting now. I hope you're ready ;) Thanks for reading <3
Steve never asked him about his lack of heats. Tony was quietly anxious about it until he broke and told Steve the truth, about the arc reactor and everything it had taken from him. Deep down he knew that Steve would take it in stride, the way he did everything that Tony told him in confidence, but there was still a tiny part of him that was afraid that this would be the straw that broke the camel’s back, that would drive Steve away from him. Instead Steve hugged him, stroking Tony’s back until he felt like he could breathe again, listening to Steve’s quiet words of reassurance.
Steve took a deep breath that didn’t calm him nearly as much as he’d hoped. “Just because I’m not ready for another relationship doesn’t mean I need a life-sized doll! That’s disgusting!”
Steve stared at him for a long moment before he seemed to give up, letting out a deep breath as he smiled at Tony. “Alright. Can't say I get it, but okay. Whatever you need.”
his lower lip, dragging it between his teeth and rubbing back and forth. That bright spot of sensation where everything else had been foggy and dull made his blood sing with pleasure, a squirming heat building low in his gut.
Hey guys! Sorry for being gone for a while there, but this week has been kicking my ass. Thankfully the weekend's coming up, so I'll have some time to relax and hopefully write. I hope this chapter makes up for the wait ;) Also:
Steve rolled his forehead against Tony’s shoulder as his grip tightened, his hips shifting just enough that Tony could feel the drag of his cock inside him. It barely moved at all, but after staying still for as long as they had the feeling made Tony’s breathing hitch anyway.
Right next to the waterfall was a tiny alcove, hidden by the large rocks surrounding it, and Steve made a beeline towards it, already digging the soap he'd just bought from the vendor earlier today out of his basket.
“You smell –“ Steve trailed off into a moan when Tony tightened around him, pushing back onto Steve's cock with as much strength as his sleep-softened limbs allowed.
Steve shrugged, his skin itching uncomfortably with the feeling that Tony was looking right through him. Down to the parts he'd never let anyone see. “I tried not to. I never got caught, so it must've worked.”
It was so fucking good that Steve wanted it to go on forever, but he couldn't stop himself from coming, his mouth dropping open as the tension inside him became unbearable –
“I'm not! I'm – okay, look, Steve, this is kind of a lot and I'm just trying to wrap my head around it, okay? Don't leave.”
“Like... the animal?” he asked in a tone that said he knew that wasn't it, and Clint's smirk widened.
“So that –“ Tony felt more than heard Steve swallow where his forehead was pressed against his neck. “I mean, is that. Something you like? Or...“
“I've heard stories. But don't worry, I'm Tony Stark and an Avenger to boot, they can't spirit me away in a dark alley without raising hell. It's fine.”
Steve really tried not to show any emotion on his face. He wasn’t sure he succeeded. “I haven’t had sex with the doll. If that’s what you mean.”
“You didn’t pay anything for the doll!” Steve shouted, his hand clenching the phone so hard it was shaking. “You signed me up as a fucking test subject, and now they invited me to an interview, and it's all your –“
Tony laughed, his chest swelling with a giddy sort of excitement as he wrapped his arms around Steve, smiling at the way Steve burrowed into his chest. “So you liked it? I know some people don't, but –“
“Or we could get some grub first,” Tony said nonchalantly, nodding his head at the front door. “There's pizza across the street or a diner a couple blocks down.”
“What I need is you with decidedly less clothes on,” Tony said, and Steve's nostrils flared, his eyes getting a little darker as Tony took off his own shirt. Steve was already reaching for him with clear intent when Tony said, “I want to cuddle naked.”
The obstruction of his military rank obviously didn't go unnoticed because the general's eyes flashed. “Having the technology to save thousands of lives at one's fingertips and not sharing it with the people you claim to fight for? Some would call that selfish.”
“What? That was amazing.” He could hear the grin in Steve’s voice as Steve stroked a hand down his back and pulled him closer. “Never been better.”
“Steve.” The way Tony's lips formed the word made it sound like praise rather than a name, and Steve felt that sinking sensation again, like he was missing something here – “It suits you.”
Steve took a deep breath. “If you say it's going to work... then I'll just have to trust that you'll find a way. You always do.”
"Yeah." Steve was panting against his chest now, lapping at the liquid that was still trickling from Tony's nipples in a way that made Tony's cock twitch. Steve's tongue caught on the swollen skin every once in a while, and Tony could hardly describe the sensation, so intense that it bordered on pain, raising the hair on the back of his neck at the same time as it made his balls draw up tight against his body.
“Are you sure, Tony?” Steve asked quietly. “We won't make it to Siberia and back in eighteen hours. Ross will think you're throwing your lot in with criminals.”
“The spell breaks when you say hurtful shit! Break their heart or whatever.” Tony frantically flapped his hand at Wanda. “Come on, try it!”
“It's been years since I've been on one of these,” Tony breathed so quietly even Steve had to strain to hear it. Steve wanted to ask why Tony had
Steve swallowed hard, his throat suddenly dry. “It's... you know how the serum made me... resistant to pain?” Tony nodded and Steve folded his hands in his lap, gritting his teeth. “It didn't. It just made me resistant to any sensation. I barely have a sense of touch anymore.”
“Almost there,” Bucky said tersely and Steve looked across the open space to see the hangar where – thank god – their jet was already waiting for them. He breathed a sigh of relief, speeding up so they could finally get –
"I didn't mean stop," Tony said, grabbing Steve's face in both hands to pull him closer, but Steve huffed out a laugh and reached up to grab both of Tony's hands in his.
,” he gasped, his eyes squeezing shut when Steve kissed him, fitting his lips around Tony's nipple and sucking until Tony felt the satisfying ache of milk leaking out of him, making his chest tingle all over.
They ate in yet more not quite uncomfortable silence, and Tony was starting to think that the reason his nerves were shot was because it was so goddamn
. That familiar rush of release, the combination of twinging pain and overwhelming pleasure as milk leaked onto Tony's chest dragged a loud moan from him as he pushed up into Steve's touch.
Steve shook his head. “Of course not. That's what I'm afraid of.” Bucky gave him a questioning look and Steve sighed. “Tony wouldn't let Ross get away with anything that hurts his family. Ross knows that. And if Ross ever gave Tony an ultimatum that involved making me dance to his tune, what do you think Tony would sacrifice to keep it from happening?”
“Oh wow. That's so kind of you, Destroyer,” Tony purred, because he sure wasn't going to be able to say CuntNCockDestroyer with a straight face. “You want to see it up close?”
“Huh.” Steve dropped down next to Tony, wrapping an arm around his shoulders to pull him close. “Okay then.”
“Saved?” The general scoffed. “That's not where you save lives, Stark. We're losing soldiers in the dumps, down in the sand. Not in hippie greenhouses.”
- The first half of the fic spans the events of Age of Ultron. Stony have a falling out because trust issues and Tony's mind warp really mess them up. Steve leads the new team (Rhodey, Sam, Vision and Wanda) while Tony goes back to the tower, retired. Living apart is awful for both of them.
“You gonna help me out?” he mumbled, and Steve's hand found his cock immediately, rubbing the glans with his thumb.
“So,” Tony said after a long moment of both of them trying to catch their breath. “I'd say that was a roaring success.”
“I think it worked,” he said breathlessly, and Steve chuffed out a laugh that quickly trailed off into a groan as he pressed his face against Tony's neck.
Tony poked him in the side, his chest thrumming with warmth when Steve immediately snuggled up to him. “
Steve smiled, grabbing one of the popcorn bowls as he settled in for a night of mindless fun. Bucky poked him in the side just as the movie started, leaning closer so Clint wouldn’t hear. “Hey, if you want to talk about it, I’m here, okay? Just saying.”
Steve shrugged. “I told you why. And I –“ He bit his lip for a second as he looked away. “I missed you. So.”
“You like?” Tony asked, doing a sassy little twirl the way he would've done for Pepper, and Steve swallowed hard, his eyes sliding down over the planes of Tony's bare chest framed by the suspenders that were holding up his stockings and garters. He'd chosen a lacy little g-string and a bow tie to complete the look, and judging by the way Steve couldn't tear his eyes away, it was having the intended effect. Tony cocked his hip and smiled.
Those words made something hot flicker to life in Steve's stomach, his cheeks heating as his hand clenched on Tony's hip.
“Just relax,” Tony murmured behind him, so close that Steve could feel the warmth radiating from his body all along his back. “I'll do all the work, sweetheart. You just enjoy yourself.”
“I know,” Tony said, standing on his tip toes to press a kiss to Steve’s cheek. “I’m counting on it.”
“Always brought me little treats when she travelled. I think she was the first person to ever tell me I was an asshole.” Steve snorted a surprised laugh and Tony smiled. “Yeah. Remembered a moment later that I was only ten, I could see it in her face, but she didn't take it back. Made me feel kinda proud. Like she respected me as an adult.”
“Huh?” Steve's head snapped up, his cheeks heating when he realized all at once what was happening. “The doll – so
“I'm good, I'm ready, come on,” Tony babbled, and Steve pulled his fingers out, fumbling some more lube into his palm to slick up his cock before he lined up and – “Oh fuck, Steve –“
“Okay.” He walked over to Tony's desk to pull up his office chair, sitting down at the edge of the room with his shield propped up against his thigh, ready to step in if need be. “I'll cut it down if it hurts you. Until then I'll be watching from over here.”
There was a flurry of donations, and Tony sat down in front of his screen for a minute to read some of the messages. Most of it was pure filth, but some of them stood out for the sole reason that they didn't have a thousand eggplant and sweat emojis in them.
Ignacio frowned, but Tony's eyes were drawn to Steve when he suddenly jerked, his right arm firmly held in another vampire's grip.
Tony jolted, completely taken off guard by the sudden reminder that he wasn't alone in the room, and he turned his head –
“You don't think I've tried that?” Steve asked heatedly, anger simmering in his eyes. “Damn it, Toni, I
Steve's mind blanked for a second. Then, from one moment to the next, he was standing right in front of Tony, his chest thrumming with the same warmth that Tony's eyes held as they stared at each other. He could feel his blood rushing in his veins when Tony grabbed his hand and stepped even closer until they were almost sharing the same air, their noses only inches apart. Steve could barely draw a breath when he reached up to touch Tony's face, curling his fingers around the curve of his ear.
It took him two tries to properly close his hand around Tony's cock, but Tony didn't waste any time riding his fist, his hands clinging to Steve's shoulders as Steve jerked him off as hard as he dared.
“No, shut up. I don't care.” Tony's gleeful tone didn't match what he was saying at all, and Steve stepped forward, reaching out in concern.
Tony had the feeling that Steve had been going to say something else, but he let it slide. “Well, the pizza
Steve chuckled, lubing up his fingers before he leaned over to kiss Tony, propping himself up on one elbow. Tony let him in with a swipe of his tongue and Steve waited for the moment that Tony’s shoulders sagged as he melted into it before he started tracing his wet fingers down Tony’s ass, circling his hole. Tony hummed, arching a little when Steve pushed the first one inside, mirroring the action with his tongue.
The hike was blessedly short and before long Steve found the clearing that surrounded the pond. The way the sunlight hit the waves near the tiny waterfall at its edge made his fingers itch for a pencil, and Steve tried to burn the sight into his retinas for later as he put down his basket and started to take off his clothes. This far out from the village it was unlikely that anyone would stumble across him bathing, and even if they did, Steve knew the perfect spot to remain unseen once he was in the water.
Once again chapter 69 is not a sexy chapter... I really need to start planning these out better xD Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy it <3
“Tony,” he said again, and Tony jumped into action, almost fumbling the bottle of lube as he frantically wetted his fingers.
Tony’s nest. That much was clear when it was basically a three person job to try and get Steve out of it once he’d fallen asleep there. Not that Tony was actively trying. But the conclusion that Steve seemed to enjoy soft fabrics did lead to Tony conducting a series of experiments to prove his hypothesis, if only to himself.
“So who's going to fly the jet?” Scott asked with a distinct bounce in his step. He kept glancing at Steve from the corner of his eyes but Steve chalked that up to nerves. “I mean, I could. I've taken a lesson or two in my day –“
“Please,” Steve gasped, his eyes squeezing shut when Tony settled down on top of him. “Oh god, Tony,
He wasn't really thinking of anything in particular, just enjoying the warm pressure of his hand while the water beat down on his back, hot enough to make his skin prickle pleasantly. It was something he did so regularly that it had become routine, not really affording him the time for indulgence or any particularly elaborate fantasy.
“You look like a cat,” Steve said amusedly, watching as Tony added some finishing touches to the nest, fluffing the pillows to his satisfaction before he perched on the biggest one, giving Steve an unimpressed look.
He glanced around the car, but aside from them there were only three other people in it. Two of them sat with their backs to him, and the third, a teenage boy wearing a leather jacket, had his face buried in his phone. Steve sighed in relief. If he kept quiet it was very unlikely that anyone would –
“Tony,” Steve gasped, his hands trembling with the strain of keeping himself upright, and Tony's eyes flashed as a smirk tugged at his lips.
“Sorry, sorry,” he said when Steve's face very subtly fell. “Just – that's the most cliché pick-up line I've heard in a while.”
Tony's hand slid down over his slim bicep before it moved on to Steve's back to reel him in. Steve stumbled forward, his heart pounding where he was pressed against Tony's chest now, shivering as Tony's hands trailed down to his lower back, drawing circles right over his tailbone. He almost swallowed his tongue when he realized that he could feel Tony's erection pressed against his stomach, huge and hard and ever so slightly wet. It felt even bigger than it looked.
“Yes, obviously.” Tony heard the condescending undertone only after he'd said it, and he gritted his teeth around a smile. “I mean, that's the standard procedure. For this kind of thing.”
That one didn't sound so good. Steve was about to ask what was wrong when he all but choked on his tongue as the plant spread Tony's thighs and he got a clear view of one of the vines pushing its way inside Tony's ass, writhing so much it almost looked painful. “Fuck, Tony, does it – Is it hurting you?”
“He said I smelled wrong,” Tony said, not quite able to conceal the hurt in his voice. Clint gave him a sympathetic look.
“Just a little longer,” Tony rasped, and Steve shook his head frantically, his chest hitching as tears ran down his face.
– Steve bit down on a grunt when his cock jerked once, twice more, before he was done,  his muscles going lax as he pulled his cock out of th-
The groan Steve made when he came was so familiar that Tony couldn't help but melt at the sound, feeling warm and sated as Steve kept fucking him spastically, any rhythm lost to the force of his orgasm.
And it was weird because according to popular belief Tony had the attention span of a toddler and the temper to match. But Tony had never once pushed Steve on his decision to take this slow, always following Steve's pace and stopping whatever they were doing at a moment's notice.
“Stop antagonizing him,” Steve sighed, his lips twitching into a smile when Tony's hand slipped down to intertwine their fingers. “He has high blood pressure.”
"Holy shit," Tony breathed and Steve couldn't help but laugh, feeling a little high on adrenaline. "You're really gonna make an honest man out of me, huh."
Steve looked up at him, but before Tony could decipher the look in his eyes he heard the waiter come over with their pizza boxes.
Which was how Tony learned all about the misadventures of Bucky and his friends. There was a woman called Natasha who sounded, quite frankly, terrifying, a guy with some sort of Robin Hood shtick named Clint, a guy who was actually called Thor for some reason –
have.” There was no arrogance in his voice, and judging by what Steve had heard about satyrs he was probably right. “If that is something you want, I will give it to you. All I need is to hear you say yes.”
"Hello Midtown!" A booming voice came from the front and Mr. Harrington stopped everyone to have them look towards the person who was...
"I should be the one that's sorry," Steve said bitterly. "He was your boyfriend and I couldn't save him-"
"He doesn't have any wings." Steve insisted that that was the reason that he kept staring at Tony. Bucky nodded while Natalia rolled her eyes.
Natasha could hear her stuttering in surprise over the phone and then she could practically hear the poor woman gaping as the Avengers arrived at her door for pickup. Then May was thanking her profusely and Natasha waved her off and hung up.
Peter knocked politely on the office door and the teacher at the desk smiled at him. "Peter Parker?"
"Oh that's what he was complaining about," Steve heard Natasha say as Tony recovered and leapt at him, yowling. He tried to crawl up Steve like he was a tree, yowling insistently the whole time.
"Well, I assume you know that we're the Avengers," Steve introduced everyone one by one and they all waved back. Clint seemed a little tense as well but mostly everyone else was polite and loving to her.
Not only had Peter acted strangely cold but Bucky was acting strange as well and avoiding them. On top of that...what Bucky said at the dinner table...
Natasha glanced at her phone. "Supposedly Tony and Peter figured out Peter's bedroom situation..." she scrolled through the pictures of what the duo designed. "Oh wow."
Peter had been called down to the office last Wednesday to discover his real parents and then took the rest of the week off from school. May came and left on Saturday and he had Sunday to convince Natasha and Tony to be able to go back to school.
Harley raised his eyebrows, gesturing to the dirty and bloody hoodie that Peter was wearing. Peter looked down self-consciously but rapidly looked back up.
"I'll pay for it," Tony assured him, turning levers and clogs to make sure that he could at least slow down the process before flipping a different switch that would force the ground to go the other way.
Pietro and Sam were caked in blood and dirt, Wanda was crying because Vision was dead and Thor, Natalia, Bucky, and Pietro looked furious. Tony was struggling trying to reach Harley and Peter whose were in cages a few feet away. He didn't want to loose them after Rhodey, Happy, and Pepper were killed protecting the other Avengers back on Earth.
Bucky was close behind him and Peter stopped at the edge, peeking his head over the corner. Peter twisted his lips and turned back to Bucky. "Gang fight."
"Just come take a shower with me," Steve shook his head and pulled a flubbergoosed Tony along with him.
Steve got whiplash about a day later when he found out that Agent Carter had told Natalia she could be an Agent like herself. Agent Peggy Carter put in a recommendation and after a display by Natalia that both Peggy and Steve watched, the Agency agreed to let her work with Ms. Carter, saying that Ms. Romonova was a good addition.
Peter thought about walking over, but figured it would be rude considering Harley had taken him out and from the scowl on Harley's face, Harley still hated Harry.
Phil nodded. "Neither do we. It seems as though she suspected that Ben had an idea but she herself didn't." They stood their for a moment and Natasha regarded the way that the woman - May - hold her face in her hands. She shook a little and Natasha frowned. It seemed as though May was crying.
They destroyed almost half of New York but Stark Industries made a gracious donation to help the city rebuild. Later, they found that Loki had been mind-controlled by some alien named Thanos and the Chitauri army was his.
As soon as they stepped out of the door, flashes and noises flooded his senses. Peter seized, eyes going wide and his breathing started to raise rapidly.
She looked familiar but she wore glasses and didn't seem to be looking at anything. Her wings were almost nine feet like Steve's and were a dark blood-red. She had red hair that was lighter than her wings and framed her face with curls. She had on a leather jumpsuit which Steve guessed was her suit.
"What?" Pietro yelped as Bucky took off after her. Wanda and Vision looked up when Steve started for the door.
His parents had been killed when he was six and his aunt and uncle had taken him in (recently, his uncle Ben had died and he got a bit choked up about that but Tony gave him a one-armed hug).
"That's not a bad idea," Carol spoke up from the couch and Scott, Hope, Rhodey, and Clint were all in the living room, next to her.
Kind, caring, loving, determined, protective. Everything Steve thought he wasn't. Steve cared for Tony-before as a brother because that's what Tony was to him. But it wasn't until his wing brushed Tony's that he realized he might feel a little bit more.
Tony had gotten Steve to do karaoke with him and while Tony was obviously drunk, Steve had super metabolism so he didn't look all that drunk. Clint was losing his mind laughing and Sam and Bucky were just giggling at Clint's laughter. Thor was chatting with Rhodey at the bar and Wanda and Pietro were somewhere in the shadows, just observing.
!" Steve's annoyed voice came through Tony's comm and Tony waved off the conversation that was happening.
Thor launched himself at the wizard when the guy suddenly disappeared and Thor just tumbled through air. Thor steadied himself and frowned.
"The least we could do," Natasha interrupted, assuring her. "I talked with Peter and he suggested it. I asked the team and we all agreed that it would be a good idea."
Natalia stared at the elevator, refusing to eat. Bucky watched her carefully and Steve was looking at her too. Steve and Bucky locked eyes. bucky gestured to Nat and Steve shrugged helplessly. Bucky opened his mouth.
"I love you too," Natasha kissed her cheek back as her mind whirled for a moment. "So how do we get Bucky to spill?"
Harley looked at him and then sighed. "Yeah well...Harry's turned into a bit of a dick. His dad successfully corrupted him unfortunately." Peter frowned.
"Just because I actually have money Harley, does not mean you can just lash out at me," Harry shot back hotly. Peter blinked. What the hell did he just step into?
"That's...that's not helpful..." Peter muttered, still feeling dizzy and wanting to drift off in Bucky's arms. "Buck - Bucky - I - I have to - have to change. I can't - I can't go to my - to my parents like this -"
Groaning, Peter picked up his phone and scanned through his texts. Ned was giving him updates about homework and MJ was giving him a weird cold shoulder. But that was normal MJ. All she did was send 'stay in bed and get better dork' which was pretty MJ.
"I'm making eggs and bacon, want anything else Peter?" His name sounded weird coming out of the Falcon's (or Sam's) mouth.
Peter felt better later in the day and started to notice some weird things. Like he could hear the Davinsons fights next door crystal clear. And he had weird sensations flowing through his body whenever he touched something.
There was a loud sound and then a door opened. Killian turned around, grinning as another guard came out with Tony. Tony was bound and gagged, stumbling towards the man and glaring at him. Killian turned back to the Avengers, as if showing off a prize.
"That could take hours," Natasha crossed her arms. "And we need to head up to Upstate anyways so let's just get into the car and head down the street -"
"Don't bother," MJ said flippantly but Peter knew what she meant. He had become fluid in MJ-anguage.
Steve took a deep breath as his wings spread behind him. He closed his eyes as he did this and stood on the edge.
"I - yes," May nodded. "He kept it all in his room. Anything his...yeah." she finished lamely and went a little red but Natasha ignored that and nodded.
Peter nodded. "And my aunt was killed in front of me. And I don't know if the Avengers are coming after me or not-"
Tony hid his wings, despite Pepper and Rhodey telling him he looked beautiful with them (Pepper tried to touch the feather-ed one, but it exploded into a flurry of movement, practically knocking her off her feet.
Tony Stark helped Nick Fury find Captain America and Bucky Barnes in the water. Nick Fury took Cap away and Tony whisked Bucky off to the SHIELD hospital where he patched him up with a new arm.
The weird thing was though was that he only acted like an asshole around Steve. It was almost like Tony felt like he had to act different around Steve. He was nice enough to Bucky and Bruce-not so much anyone else but then again, he only did the absolutely necessary things with them.
But it was just so frustrating to hear her just shut down and not bother to see how he felt. Peter was so sure that he had finally gotten through to her but clearly he hadn't.
Harley snorted in some of his shake; a failed attempt at laughing. He pulled away, hacking and coughing as Peter yelped and tried to help before falling into a fit of giggles himself.
"Fair enough." Natasha smiled. "How about you three go to the living room and set up a movie and Steve can get some popcorn going." Steve brightened, nodding and looking pleased that he could be helpful as he left the room.
Peter let out a garbled yell and sat up. He felt fine ish now. He definitely wasn't sick anymore but his other sense were beginning to give him a headache.
But I wanted to ask - I have 26ish works where they are incomplete or in progress or abandoned or whatever and I'm wondering if it is a bad idea to combine all of them into one book? I did that for my profile on Wattpad but I'm thinking of doing it for this profile.
Harley let Peter stay the night. He cleared off space next to the cooler and laid down an inflatable bed. He pumped air into it as Peter sneakily ran inside and came back with some bedsheets announcing that someone probably saw him.
"Soul wings." Thor repeated. "They represent one's soul. Their personality." He frowned. "I thought everyone knew that."
Three hours ago, Bruce released Peter from the hospital wing with a note that clearly stated-NO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. Tony, meanwhile was getting interrogated from Natalia ("His stupid 'three questions a day' doesn't apply to me." she snorted).
"NATASHA'SMARRYINGBUCKY! NATASHA'SMARRYINGBUCKY!" Pietro zoomed back, repeating the mantra over and over as Bucky stumbled to the side from the force of him running.
Natalia snapped her fingers and Steve jumped. "Alright. Let's get to your mom's house." And she grabbed his hand.
Steve sighed and shook his head in confusion before getting out of bed and dressing himself for a run. How was it possible that Tony was more confusing to figure out as a cat?
"Eh, okay." Harley smiled back and then shot a glare at Harry who had his hair slicked back and was in a grey suit. "Trying to reason with this asshole." Harry went a beat red with what looked like frustration and anger.
A crash, followed by more cursing, was the only response. He rolled his eyes and opened the door, half expecting to find the man somehow plastered already –
It sounded like he was giving Steve an out. A reason to leave, to forget this conversation had happened.
tired, after battles like that one, but this was exhaustion that ran bone-deep. Something that made Stark’s hands shake and his mouth shake too.
Tony waved his hand dismissively. “Oh, of course you did. I gave you every reason to.” His mouth twisted to the side. It was obvious he was leaving things unsaid, but he added, “Still giving you plenty of reasons to.”
“But, man. He sure got the ‘real men don’t talk about their feelings’ shtick wrong. He’s probably rolling in his grave right now, knowing he missed you coming back. Knowing that,
Steve shook his head slowly. “Would you judge Banner for panicking at the sight of a needle in his skin? Or Barton, for flashbacks of Loki?” He sighed. “Would you judge me for breaking down over falling in the snow?”
Steve looked at him skeptically. His eyes trailed to the man’s left arm, still hanging by his side. “Is your shoulder dislocated?” He kept his question carefully neutral.
He tried to say it gently, but it came out gruff. Stark swallowed and looked away, and from this close Steve could see the way his pulse strained in his neck, the way sweat was breaking out on his forehead.
Clint had cracked more than one joke about how Tony had to engineer a friend for himself in order to have any, and the memory made his stomach twist guiltily. If Stark felt like he couldn’t trust them, that was their fault. Not his.
Tony blinked at the expletive. He opened his mouth, closed it. “I annoy the everloving shit out of you,” he said blankly.
“Yeah, well. You’re not gonna do that,” Steve said, shrugging. He tried to sound nonchalant, well aware that Stark felt backed into a corner right now. His anger at the man had faded to nothing, for better or worse. Right now he just wanted to fix what was hurting his teammate.
He’d never given much thought to what kind of father Howard might have been, preferring instead to remember him as he’d been in Steve's time. Eager, intelligent, patriotic to a fault. Perhaps a little single-minded, sometimes. Perhaps a little… cold.
“This… is not how I expected this to go,” he finally said, laughing a little. He sounded almost relieved, if a little bewildered. “For what it’s worth, I’m sorry for being such an ass.”
, his ain’t-shit son just spent the last hour having a fucking panic attack right in front of you.” He shook his head. “He always said that if he found you, he wouldn’t have let you near me. He’d be too embarrassed of his pansy ass son for that – he probably wanted a kid who… I don’t know. Ate roofing nails or caught bullets with their teeth or whatever the fuck it was real men did back in the day.”
Steve stared at him, and Stark laughed at his silence, the sound a little strangled. “You know, when I first met you, I was so down to hate you it wasn’t even funny. ‘Cause if you were anything like my dad had said, you’d have been a real asshole.”
“Yes,” Steve agreed evenly. “But you also always have my back. You always look out for the team, you work your
He tried to keep the question light, but Stark scowled at him anyway, pushing himself off the toilet and into a credible standing position. He swayed but caught himself, hissing as he put pressure on his left arm.
Steve crossed his arms, quiet for a moment. “What happened?” He wasn’t talking about his injuries, and they both knew it.
He didn’t really understand what the man meant, but the rawness of his voice and the way his hands had clenched into fists were enough to tell him that he shouldn’t push. “Okay. Can you walk?”
Stark scoffed. “Relocate it myself. I just -” he faltered for a second. “I was working up to it, okay?” he said defensively. “Wasn’t my top priority,” he added, quieter. He sounded tired.
Stark laughed at that, then winced and held his hand over his chest, palm down. He touched the reactor gingerly. “No. Don’t think so. Don’t think I can.”
He set Stark’s cup down on the table, and the man eyed him. He hoped Stark wasn’t offended - he wasn’t going to mess up by trying to hand him the cup again, but he also didn’t want to look like he was wearing kiddie gloves.
“And I think you’re afraid that I’m going to judge you for all of that. That I’m going to think you’re weak, or not capable of doing Avengers business.”
He searched for something to say. He’d come up with the intention of chewing Stark out for missing another debriefing, for running off as soon as the battle was through. For the gruff way he’d pushed past Steve a few hours ago when the captain had tried to stand in his way, his eyes narrowed in anger as he hurled verbal abuse like Molotov cocktails. He’d pushed Steve into a shouting match in about 30 seconds flat and he’d been too pissed to think rationally afterward - no doubt Stark’s intention, since it let him slip away to his floor without being followed.
Stark shook his head. “Oh, he got some things right. Annoying boy scout attitude, check. Hero complex? Check.” His voice was flat, and for whatever reason Steve didn’t take offense like he normally would have. Maybe it was because it was clear that Tony was trying to get control of the situation again, get control of himself.
The flicker of vulnerable surprise on Stark’s face was almost painful to look at. He stared at Steve for a moment, as if waiting for him to take it back.
At the first dab of antiseptic, he jumped. “Jesus. Warn a guy,” he said, but it was a little strangled, not his normal brand of sarcasm and self-protective banter. Steve pressed his lips together and cleaned the length of the cut. Stark was right - it wasn’t deep. But it had to be painful. The longer he worked – and the closer he got to the reactor – the stiffer Stark got, till he was breathing fast and shallow, his hands gripping the seat of the toilet beneath him until they were as white as bone.
He covered his face with his hand, a short, painful laugh bubbling out of him. “That’s not… really what I expected you to say.”
Now Steve was wondering how many other times Tony had played him like that. He felt a little stupid.
“Get the fuck off my floor! Jesus!” He could hear the man struggle to get off the ground, his breath high and tight and pained. “Fucking
he added cryptically, his tone giving away nothing. Steve just nodded. If there was anyone on earth who knew what Stark needed, it would be Jarvis. Even when Tony isolated himself from everyone, he confided in the AI – they all knew that.
He closed the worst bits with some butterfly bandages that were scattered all over the counter, noting the way that Stark’s skin jumped under his touch, and moved back to give him some space. The man was overtired. They were
When he finally made himself look over at Tony, he could see that the man was processing what he’d said - tellingly slowly, for someone as smart as Tony was. His face was a little blank, like he couldn’t wrap his mind around someone apologizing to him. Couldn’t wrap his mind around the fact that they weren’t fighting right now, that Steve wasn’t chewing him out over some breach in decorum or throwaway sarcastic comment.
Stark’s jaw was working. “... Right at the tail end of it all,” he finally admitted. “Fucking bot blew up and caught me, knocked one of my thrusters into overdrive, and bashed in my chest plate with the shrapnel on top of that. I grabbed something to stabilize and… yeah.”
He was halfway down the hall before he heard the man. He was swearing colorfully from inside a room Steve assumed was the bathroom. He crossed his arms, tapped his foot just outside the door. “Stark.”
touch me,” the man snapped, and Steve put his hands up and backed up a step, eyebrows raised. Stark’s chest was heaving, arm shaking as it held his weight. “Just – fuck, would you
They sat there in silence until Stark couldn’t take it anymore - not a long time, predictably. “Still want to give me a speech?” He sounded almost hopeful. Clearly, he was ready to get back to their usual dynamic. Ready to stop being
He swallowed. Sat down on the edge of the tub, careful not to let their legs touch. Still, they were so close that he could feel the warmth of his teammate through the material of his clothes. The man was still in his undersuit from the waist down, still dirt-smeared from battle. “Do you want to shower?”
Steve tried not to wince at the thought of doing something like that on your own. He’d done it once or twice, and it was incredibly painful. Difficult, because everything in your head was screaming at you to stop hurting yourself. He wondered how many times Stark had done that, if he was familiar with the process.
“Yeah it is, Tony,” he insisted gently. “We’re all a little screwed up, okay? We’ve all had a rough go of it. You’ve dealt with things that I can’t even imagine,” he said softly, eyeing the glowing reactor pulsing in the man’s chest under his shirt, “and it’s okay to lose it, every once in a while.”
“Yeah, but none of you freak out over a papercut.” The words were bitter, and even though they were hardly apt to describe Stark’s injury the man obviously believed them. “What was I supposed to say?” He grimaced, mocking his own voice in a dismissive way – “Hey guys, not to freak you out or anything, but I’m about to have one hell of a gasping-crying-breakdown! So if you wouldn’t
He trailed off, the venom fading from his voice as Steve didn’t rise to the bait. “What do you want, Steve?” he sounded tired. Like he was expecting to be kicked while he was down.
He massaged the offending limb with his other hand, mouth pressed tight, water collecting in the corners of his eyes at the pain. He swallowed hard. “Thanks.”
Tony pressed his hands to his eyes, hiding them. He huffed out a self-deprecating laugh. “No. Of course I wouldn’t. But it’s not the same-”
The ease that had settled over the man vanished like a tablecloth ripped from underneath dishes and he leaned away. He looked angry, but under that was something more raw. “I think your chest got injured in the blast and that brought up some bad memories. I think you picked a fight on purpose so you could deal with it on your own, up here.”
“...Thanks,” he said suspiciously, hand snaking out to grab the mug and bring it close to his chest. The mask relaxed a fraction as he took a long gulp.
Stark visibly struggled to come up with a lie, his face twitching. He couldn’t, which spoke to how tired he must have been. So he just looked up at the ceiling instead, his mouth pressed into a firm line. Steve could see the beginning of a nasty bruise on his cheek.
Steve swallowed. Stark looked terrible. His chest was black and blue around the reactor, and the cut he’d seen earlier extended from his shoulder down to just under his opposite pectoral, the long line of it crossing the metal in his chest. One arm was hanging limply, the other shaking as it held his weight. The acrid smell of bile lingered in the room, though he’d obviously flushed the evidence.
He admitted it like it was something shameful, like he was sure he’d be mocked for it, but something warm sparked to life in Steve’s chest. “Then would you tell me what happened?”
The question was a dare. Steve took it. “You trust him. You obviously don’t trust me. You need someone to help you through… whatever this is,” he finished lamely.
“I said I’m sorry,” he repeated slowly. “I haven’t been a very good teammate to you. Haven’t been a very good friend.”
Tony’s face twisted with some emotion he was trying to hold down. “I got trust issues that could sink a helicarrier, Cap,” he said, something a little rough in his voice. “Believe me, that wasn’t all you.”
He stood up and brushed off his pants, extending a hand. “Now, let’s go to medical, okay? You need a sling for that arm.”
“It’s not that bad. I could have stayed if I wanted to, but I didn’t,” he jabbed, and it was so obvious now what he was trying to do. If he could get Steve yelling, there would be no chance of anything personal being discovered, no chance that he could make the man feel vulnerable.
He used his time in the kitchen to think about what he’d seen. Stark looked like he hadn’t slept in days, and the troubling thing was that Steve couldn’t remember if he’d looked like that before the battle as well. He had no way of knowing whether this was Tony’s general weariness after a battle, or if there had been something specific that had pushed him over the edge. Hesitantly, he settled on the latter - The man was jumpy. More averse to human contact than he already tended to be.
Steve is still talking to him but it’s all muffled in Tony’s ears. He tunes back in to hear Steve saying, over and over, “It’s not your fault. It’s not your fault, Tony.”
Tony’s all but dragging Bruce across the room behind him, praying Bruce can keep control of the Hulk long enough for them to get out of here safely. He gets to the elevator and pushes the button frantically, but the elevator doesn’t open. “JARVIS!”
“Tony,” Steve pants. Blood is flowing out of his wounds, life seeping away too much too fast. His eyes close, then open sluggishly to look at the man who shot him. His voice comes out hoarse, full of pain. “Please,” he gasps. The man looks at Jamie, then back at Steve, and then he raises his gun and shoots Steve in the head.
Tony grins. “A Yank! And I thought this was a local hangout. The Google lies,” he says with a smirk. “Where are you from, my delightful new friend?”
He remembers trying to be quiet and failing, stumbling backward, out of the room, and Steve looking up at him, eyes wide with desire or surprise or both, Barnes’s head snapping around to find him and pin him with his penetrating stare. He vaguely remembers the elevator doors opening, thank god for JARVIS, and falling back into the waiting compartment, before the doors shut quietly on both men still staring at him from the kitchen.
Steve’s eyes narrow. “What, I can’t come see you whenever I like?” he asks, a sharp edge to his voice.
He asks Friday where Tony is and she tells him he’s in the lab, which is no surprise. He heads to the kitchen for a drink of water. He’s alone, the rest of the team already in their rooms, hopefully sleeping before training tomorrow morning. He leans back against the counter, glass of water in hand, and just breathes.
He hasn’t left the hotel room since the whole mess started, he could be seriously compromising his mission but he can't focus right now. He’s sitting in front of the TV again, watching as the news reporters bring news from Miami. There are Feds in the background, doing cleanup, a disturbing amount of body bags piled near rusted shipping containers. There are metal parts lying all over the ground, and Steve can just make out bits of the Iron Man armor. According to the news, there had been an all-out battle, dozens of Iron Man suits taking on what they’re calling Extremis-enhanced soldiers.
Tony quickly finishes what he’s doing in the lab and closes it down before turning back to give Steve his full attention. “Okay,” he says, clapping his hands together once, sauntering over toward Steve. “First things first: Do you have clothes?”
“Don’t you though?” Tony asks, voice rising, slightly hysterical now. “You get twitchy when I mention new technology, like you don’t trust me with it. You don’t like when I work on upgrading FRIDAY. I can see you holding back, like you don’t want to offend me, but I wish you’d just say it already so I can tell you I’m not doing anything stupid and I won’t break the world again, Jesus Christ I can’t handle the looks, and that’s
He strides over to the private elevator and the doors slide open soundlessly. As JARVIS whisks him up from the basement depths of Stark Tower, he brainstorms furiously. He had a plan for the day the Captain showed up on his doorstep, but it seems silly and inadequate now and like he’s trying too hard (he’s not, he’s got nothing to prove), so he’s got to come up with something entirely different from the original red, white, and blue confetti and ‘Here, I built you an apartment in my Tower!’ idea.
“Ah,” Tony says, and falls silent. It’s unusual enough for it to feel awkward, and Steve clears his throat after a moment.
Pepper chimes in softly. "But why is it always you, Tony? Why are you always the sacrifice?" Tony sees flashes of Manhattan, the nuke flying over the harbor, the portal opening wide in the sky, the explosion in space when he thought he'd never return. Then, abruptly, he thinks about Steve flying a plane into the ocean. He shakes his head, eyes shut.
Bucky's mouth quirks up a bit. "You could do worse than a guy like Stark," he says lightly. He crosses the small distance separating them and looks indecisive about something, before he places a deliberate hand on Steve's shoulder. "It's still hard to remember how to be Bucky Barnes." He goes silent for a moment, squeezing Steve's shoulder almost too tightly. He struggles for a second, then says quietly, "But I know you, and you're my friend. I've got your back no matter what, punk."
Tony’s a little bit surprised; he hasn’t seen Steve since he moved into the Tower a week ago, and now he’s here, walking casually into the lab, looking around curiously.
Tony's eyes are dancing as he watches Thor snuffle in his sleep, and he turns to Steve across the aisle.
He squats down as Jamie barrels into him, wrapping his little arms around Tony’s neck and hugging tightly. Tony squeezes back, hesitant at first and then maybe a little too hard, but Jamie doesn’t complain.
Then he remembers. He is in the lab, and they took Bruce. They came into his home and shot him and took Bruce. He sits up quickly and almost vomits from the vertigo, but someone is holding him up and when he opens his eyes he sees Steve.
Steve is silent for a few moments and Tony risks glancing up at him. He’s looking away now, gaze directed somewhere towards the bathroom, and Tony watches him swallow. It looks painful.
“Almost all clear, Cap, Widow and Hawkeye are on their way down to take out the rest, and we’ll be home before you know it.”
He stares at his reflection, the dark bags under bloodshot eyes, the almost unrecognizable beard, the crows feet by his eyes and the smile lines by his mouth, the grey coming in at his temples. It’s an aging face, one that’s seen a lot and been through a lot, and one that used to be happy. Used to think he’d finally earned some sort of peace.
He hears Steve take a sharp breath, ignores him. Barnes stays silent, face unmoving, before his lips quirk up at the edges. It makes him look dangerous.
If he were any other man he’d be drunk, but he’s a supersoldier, so of course he’s stone-cold sober when he gets back to the compound at one in the morning. He drops his gear off in their bedroom, leaving it at the foot of the bed where Tony’s sure to stub his toe on it and curse at Steve to stop leaving his shit around all the time.
Steve smiles ruefully as he takes his seat. “Yeah, I was supposed to be. Buck met a girl last month and he cancelled with me to take her out today. Guess she works during the week and only has the weekends off…” He trails off, shrugging as if to say, “What can you do?”
It's a short ride later and they're all boarding the plane, bags thrown over their shoulders despite Happy's insistence they let him do it. Tony obligingly lets the chauffeur carry his bag and suitcase armor onto the plane after him, and then Happy wishes them all a good flight and safe mission, and the engines fire up and they're on their way.
Cap actually quirks a smile at that. He shakes his head, then says, amused, “Thank you, Tony, light of my life, I’d love to live here with the rest of my awesome team of superheroes.”
Yinsen smiles. “Yes, I have a wife. A beautiful wife, who I love more than anything. And two children, one boy and one little girl. My son wants to be a doctor, yes. He is the age where his father is still his hero.” He smiles wistfully. “My daughter, on the other hand, wants to be a ballerina.” His smile widens, and Tony grins back.
Steve only looks confused now, so Tony rolls his eyes and elaborates. “Usually it’s just reporters trying to drag things out of me, or business associates which is just, suck, it’s just giant suck all the time. Or it’s fans, or someone trying to get their hands on my tech, or military brass trying to strong-arm me into giving up Iron Man. Or start building weapons again, even better. No offense,” he says belatedly as he sees Steve looking at him with pinched eyebrows, lips pressed tightly together.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says, and maybe it sounds like he’s apologizing for overreacting but Steve doesn’t think he quite pulls it off. His voice is hardly recognizable, shaking and miserable, and Tony just gives him this sad, sad smile, shakes his head and pecks him tenderly on the lips.
"Hey, Cap, just the man I wanted to see," he says brightly. "I'm working on improvements to your uniform. Those lasers got through the suit pretty easily, so I've been messing around with the alloys weaved into the material and I think I've got something that can absorb that type of energy instead of just repel it, and if I create a kind of storage device then you can use it.. to..." He trails off when he catches the look on Steve's face. He sighs, only wincing slightly.
On the other hand, he genuinely likes this guy. It wouldn’t be right to bring him up, have his wicked way with him, and then show him the door in the morning like every other one-night-stand he’s ever had. Because the other option is out of the question; he can’t be in a relationship on a good day. To start one right now, when he doesn’t even know how long he’s going to live, is needlessly cruel. To both of them.
“I hurt someone.” There’s silence from where Tony’s sitting, and Steve clears his throat and continues. “My— my friend. I said some things I shouldn't have, and didn’t say some things I should have, and I hurt him.” Steve’s throat closes up suddenly and it fucking
His chest tight with feelings, Steve kneels down in the aisle, lowering himself to Tony’s level, sliding his hand down to cup the other man’s cheek. He reaches his left hand up to Tony’s face, feeling weak and pathetic and wanting so badly that he doesn’t care a bit. He cups Tony’s other cheek in his left hand, runs both thumbs over sharp cheekbones. Tony’s eyelids flutter again, and Steve doesn’t pull away. When Tony’s eyes blink open, Steve wonders what he sees, if his face shows how desperate he feels, the need painted onto every inch of his skin.
Tony turns immediately, sees Steve standing next to the bed, face pale, arms hanging at his sides, phone still clutched tightly in his hand. Tony freezes.
“We’ve managed to stabilize her, she’s out of the woods for now. There was some significant damage to her lungs, so we have her attached to a breathing tube at the moment. Some broken bones, which were the least serious of her injuries.” The doctor pauses, takes a breath, then goes on. “There was also severe damage to her skull, with swelling and bleeding in her brain. It’s stopped, now, but we won’t know the effects, if there are any, until she wakes up. Which could take hours or days, I don’t have an answer for that, I’m sorry,” he says before Tony can even ask.
Steve opens his mouth but doesn’t have an answer. Tony continues, looking down at his hands now, fingers dancing over the rim of his glass. “You seem like a decent guy. You talk about your friends, you’ve traveled, you’re nice enough. You're handsome. Why are you hiding out here?”
Steve’s got a possessive side. It’s not a surprise, Tony’s seen it in battle when he was still an Avenger. He’s like a papa bear, prowling and making sure all his cubs are safe and right where they’re supposed to be. Any unannounced change in plans and he’s twitchy and tense, voice short over comms demanding why Tony’s not in position, and Tony knows it comes from a good place, a place where he’s worried and scared and he just doesn’t know how to deal with losing someone again.
He pushes himself up off the couch unsteadily, Steve stepping back to give him room. He shakes his head a bit to clear it, then sets off across the room toward the bar. Knocking back the last of his drink, he pours himself another.
Steve comes striding in, jaw clenched, hands fisted at his sides, and he glances around the room before he catches sight of Tony sitting on the edge of the bed, palms resting on the sheets to either side of his body, staring at the floor between his shoes. Tony’s shoulders tense as he hears Steve make his way over, boots clunking loudly on the hardwood.
Tony licks his lips lightly, readying to speak, and Steve's eyes are immediately drawn down to his mouth, and he feels his heart rate skyrocket instantly.
"So what you're saying is, we're alone..." Tony grins lewdly, and Steve blushes. It's adorable. He pushes himself up, ignoring the twinge in his side, because this is worth it. "There's nobody here..." He leans forward, lips stopping inches from Steve's, breath ghosting over his lips, "to interrupt us..." He trails off, eyelids heavy, eyes flicking between Steve's.
"Not at all costs, Tony!" Steve interrupts sharply. His voice is raised but he's not yelling, probably still respecting hospital rules, and isn't he just perfect. "I never wanted this! I'd never ask for him back at the expense of you."
“Okay, Tony Stark,” Steve says, voice light. “Tell me something I couldn’t find out by searching your name on the internet.”
“Hey babe, whatcha got for me today?” Steve grins and lifts two white bags with red Chinese writing on them. “See, this is why you’re my favorite,” Tony says happily, saving his progress and making his way over to the couch. “You always bring me goodies. And you look good while doing it, too,” Tony remarks, leering suggestively. Steve snorts and swats his hand away when Tony reaches to grab his ass.
Steve is shaking his head in disbelief and growing agitation. “Tony, I needed time to clear my head after what I did.”
It’s bittersweet, being with Tony, and part of Steve wishes he didn’t do it, wishes he’d walked away before when Tony had given him an out. But another part of him, the bigger part, wouldn’t trade this for anything. Tony’s hands, more tender and gentle than Steve had ever imagined, lighting him up in ways he’d never thought possible, dancing across his skin and leaving fiery trails in their wake. Tony’s lips, so soft next to his scratchy beard, kissing that is more of a give and take, a question and a promise, and Steve has never been so close to coming from just a kiss. It’s so intimate, every second of it, that Steve would call it making love if he was telling the truth, but how can you make love to someone when you’re lying to them, when they don’t even know who you really are?
He’s crying before he realizes, sobbing messily with tears running down his face. He feels Steve’s arms go around him, enveloping him, offering comfort that he knows he doesn’t deserve.
The awareness keeps coming, in gradual waves, slow and steady that he eventually identifies as his heartbeat. He has a heart, he has a body. He has eyes and a nose and a mouth, he’s breathing, he’s alive. He’s awake, or so close to being awake, for maybe the first time, he doesn’t know if he’s ever been awake before.
He backs Tony into the bedroom, never stopping the kiss, hardly stopping to breathe. The room is still dark and they stumble until they reach the bed, losing clothes along the way. Steve shucks his shoes, hopping awkwardly for a moment to peel his socks and pants off before returning to the heat of Tony’s mouth. Tony peels both the sweater and button-down over his head in one move, lets his hands roam unchecked over Steve’s chest and stomach. Steve gets to work on Tony’s belt, helping him step out of his pants before he reaches for the edge of Tony’s t-shirt.
It’s different from last night, because Tony’s not drunk and Steve’s a least a little more prepared this time. His arms snake around Tony’s waist, hands crawling up Tony’s back to pull him more closely into his body, and his mouth opens under Tony’s, a heated groan spilling out.
The man steps over Steve’s body and over to Jamie’s crib. Tony watches in horror and he pushes his suit faster, warnings flashing across the HUD. The man never lowers his gun, points it straight at their son. Tony’s streaking past the landing pad, through the penthouse living room, down the hallway. He can see the men outside the door, fires repulsors at them without slowing down, aims to kill. He's there, he’s almost there, he’s turning the corner just in time to see the gun go off.
His team finds him hours later, nearly frozen but feeling nothing at all, and as they lead him away, he knows part of him will never leave here.
Tony snorts. “Yeah, I’m pretty familiar with Afghanistan myself,” he says darkly. Tony can see Steve glance at him cautiously out of the corner of his eye.
“You just don’t want to do the boring stuff, Tony, I know you.” Tony grins as he turns his suit back toward the Tower. “You’re always trying to get out of cleanup, it’s —“ Steve’s voice cuts off and Tony’s eyes dart up to the little screen on his display.
The handle nearly cracks off of the coffee mug when Tony throws it carelessly into the kitchen sink.
Steve wants to cry, break down and ask why Bucky ran away from him, why he wouldn't let Steve help him all these months. He supposes it was personal, Bucky's vendetta against Hydra, but he would have liked to help take them out, feel some sort of satisfaction after everything they've done to him and the people he loves.
“Tony,” he says softly. Tony looks up and Rhodey’s eyes are red and puffy, and Tony reaches out to him pathetically. Rhodey takes his hand, holding onto it tightly. “You know what they brought you in here to tell you, right?” Tony shakes his head and turns it into Steve’s chest. He knows. Oh, he knows, but he’s not going to acknowledge it. He doesn’t know how he can be expected to.
He flops back to the bed, arms flying out to the sides, and something crumples as his hand lands on the pillow next to him. He grabs it, sitting up slowly and pulling the hotel paper into his lap, rubbing the residual sleep from his eyes.
Tony cuts him off. “Yay, you’re here,” he says, voice brittle and eyes flashing, as Steve comes storming into the lab.
Steve rolls his eyes heavenward as if asking for patience. “Tony,” he says, all Captain America. Seems to be the way of things lately. “You do realize that everything you say or do as Tony Stark reflects on this team.” It’s not a question.
Steve attempts a smile but it falters and disappears when he meets Tony’s eyes. His eyes shine and his mouth trembles before he swallows and his lips thin.
“Sorry to drop it on you like that, it just slipped out,” Steve murmurs into Tony’s hair, voice low. “But I’m not sorry I said it. I do love you. You don’t have to say it back,” he finishes softly, comfortingly.
"I can't let them die when I can do something about it," he says with finality. He hears Pepper sigh, and he thinks that it's a good thing they broke up, he'd hate himself even more than he already does if he'd done this to her again while they were still together. He squeezes her hand, and Rhodey's hand stays on his shoulder, a comforting weight.
Tony sighs again and slumps back down in his chair, setting his battery back down beside him. “How do you stand it? Being locked down here like an animal.”
Tony gives Steve an abridged version of his own background, though he skips over the shitty stuff (which, depressingly, is most of his childhood and a good chunk of his adult life). He tells Steve about Jarvis, the butler, and growing up with him, and he tells him about JARVIS, the AI, which Steve finds fascinating and has him asking all kinds of questions about computers and technology and artificial intelligence.
Tony hmphs and Steve looks over at him, questioning. He explains himself. “Their show isn’t terrible, but don’t you want to see the ball drop or something?”
Tony grits up just enough dignity to turn his back to them, to Steve, before he covers his face with his hands.
“Thanks,” Tony says, smiling his most charming smile. He knows it’s his most charming smile because GQ told him it was. Cargo Guy smiles back, nodding, and he’s got a really great smile, too, all those pearly whites on display, and Tony should probably walk away now before this gets  awkward.
Steve comes back to the Tower the following weekend, this time with Nat’s uniform in his duffel. He tells Tony that the upgrades he made to the Captain America uniform were amazing and asks if maybe Tony could incorporate some of that into Black Widow’s catsuit as well? Tony spends a couple hours fixing it up, then the rest of the weekend in bed with Steve.
She scoots closer and proceeds to scoop a spoonful of the broth (he hates post-surgery food, the broths and yogurts and jellos, everything bland and tasteless) and gives him a look that says "try to argue and I'll remove an intimate part of your body with this plastic spoon". He shudders and goes with it, opening his mouth.
. He pats him on the back a couple of times before pulling away reluctantly. He'd forgotten how good it felt to be embraced, to be missed.
Tony clenches his jaw and squeezes his eyes shut, forcing back the tears. He needs to be strong for this. He needs to do this for Pepper, do what she would have wanted, do the right thing.
His phone is still working perfectly, despite being in a run-down city with no cell towers. Natasha had given it to him, after the SHIELD fiasco, and even if it hadn't had the name STARK embossed across the top, he would have known who she’d gotten it from. He gets crystal clear reception everywhere, and access to everything he could need, no issues with GPS or wifi. There’s always a hotel room waiting for him in each new city, and though he knows Natasha has her own resources, he suspects Tony’s behind it. Like he’s behind the extra funds in his bank account.
He puts a pillow and blanket down on the seat next to his, then takes the others to where Tony sits across the aisle. He drapes the blanket over the other man’s still form, then gently lifts Tony’s head to slide the small pillow into place. He takes a second to reposition Tony’s head so that it won’t leave him with a crick in his neck, and because he wants to and he doesn’t know if he’ll ever get the chance to when Tony is awake and he has no self-control, he runs a hand through Tony’s hair like he did that one night months ago. It’s soft, and is curling slightly at the ends. It’s longer than Steve’s ever seen it, and he wonders if Tony’s just been too busy to be bothered to get it cut. Steve strokes his hand through the silky strands, petting him lightly, and thank god Tony’s not awake for this, Steve doesn’t know if he’d ever stop blushing.
Tony barks out a laugh. "'Atta boy," he says, slapping him amicably on the arm as he heads toward the elevator. He wants to go back down to the lab and work out those armor kinks now that he's got Captain America settled in.
Tony nods, clears his throat slightly and tries to dredge up some pep. “Yep, all better, bud. Peachy keen.” His voice only trembles a little. He calls it a success.
This time it's Natasha sitting in the lonely plastic chair by his bed when he opens his eyes. She's reading a book in Romanian, and Tony rolls his eyes. Of course she is.
Tony ignores him. There’s a heavy sigh and Rhodey sits on the bed next to Tony’s head. Tony doesn’t move, just blinks as the side of Rhodey’s leg comes into focus. There’s a short silence and then Rhodey’s reaching down and petting Tony’s hair hesitantly, and it feels good. Tony wants to shove his hand away, but can’t seem to find the strength.
“Oh, Tony…” Her eyes shimmer for a moment, before she looks down at the stack of papers in her arms. When she looks back up her eyes are clear. Her heels click on the tile as she strides over to Tony’s workbench—the workbench that is littered with red and gold Iron Man parts. Carefully moving some out of the way she sets down the stack of forms and turns to Tony.
Tony sits up, blanket sliding off his shoulders, forcing Steve to lean back slightly on his heels. Steve starts to pull his hands away but Tony makes a sound, a wait sound, and Steve stills. Tony reaches his hands up to cover Steve’s, looking at him, looking through him, and he must find what he’s looking for because his hands squeeze lightly and then he leans forward, lips capturing Steve’s in a kiss so tender his heart breaks a little.
Bucky looks back at him, eyes steady. "We have to restart his heart before his injuries don't matter at all," he says levelly.
Bucky immediately crosses the short distance between them and crouches in front of him, elbows resting on his knees and hands knotted together tightly, watching in silence as Tony breaks down in front of him.
He happens to catch a glimpse of Cap’s face as he leaves, but he doesn’t look mad. He looks regretful, and he watches Tony wordlessly as the doors slide closed between them.
“Oh my god, you’re pathetic,” he says, rolling his eyes at Steve's guilt-stricken look. “It’s fine, it’s just a bruise, shut up Steve. God, I take it back, go back to burning with righteous anger, this is pitiful.”
“The only one that remembers Ultron is you, Tony.” Tony snorts. “Fine,” Steve relents, running a hand through his messy hair, “they remember Ultron. But you’re the only one dwelling on it. You helped save everyone, Tony, and they know it. We couldn’t have done it without you.” Steve’s eyes are so earnest it makes Tony want to vomit.
Steve takes a deep breath, squeezes the hand still gripping Tony’s shoulder. “You know Ross held a grudge against him. His science division came up with something yesterday. Something strong enough to—“ he breaks off, swallows. Continues, voice strained. “Strong enough to kill the Hulk.”
“What brings you to beautiful Switzerland?” Tony asks, that piercing attention back on the drink in his hands. He’s swirling it in circles now, liquid climbing up the sides of the glass but never spilling, fingers never stopping their constant movement.
“I’ll be back in a little bit, okay?” He says, eyes boring into Steve’s. There’s always so much he wants to say in these moments but his mouth doesn’t never seems to want to cooperate. Steve understands him anyway, wonderful Steve, and he nods, eyes suspiciously shiny. Tony continues, “It’ll be a piece of cake. In and out, and then we can order in and watch Dora the Explorer: Puppies Galore for the thousandth time, alright?” Steve snorts out a little laugh and Tony manages a smile.
Steve goes back to petting Tony's hair, talking nonsense and waiting for help to arrive. It's the longest ten minutes of his life, feeling Tony's blood leak out between his fingers, watching his team try to staunch the flow from half a dozen different places. Natasha and Clint run over to relay information to the EMS team when the chopper finally lands, and then there's a flurry of motion and Steve is pushed aside and the professionals take over. He stands back as Tony is lifted onto a gurney and rushed away. He feels a presence behind him and looks around to find Bucky standing there, flesh and metal arms both covered in Tony's blood. He's sure he looks just as bad.
Tony’s eyes fly to Bruce, who looks just as shocked as he does. All of the color drains out of his face, and his eyes are wide and fearful, and just the tiniest bit green around the edges.
So instead of laughing at Yinsen’s words of devotion, he makes a hmph noise and leans forward to study the board.
He knows Tony’s history, knows about the “playboy” part of the genius-billionaire-playboy-philanthropist. Tony’s been with Pepper most of the time Steve’s known him, but he’s seen news stories and magazine articles detailing Tony’s sordid past as one of the country’s most eligible bachelors. He’s aware Tony doesn't discriminate based on gender, so he shouldn’t be as surprised as he is to realize Tony’s flirting with him.
“Tony…” Steve is reaching out to him with one hand, but when Tony looks up Steve stops, hand dropping back to his side.
Just then the stairwell doors slam open, and General Ross stomps in in all his sadistic glory, gray hair cut sharp as ever and an ugly light in his eye. Men pour out behind him, lining the far wall and spreading out in formation. Tony steps in front of Bruce.
He stares forlornly at her, knowing what she’s asking, knowing his answer here will determine a lot more than paper-signing and possibly sleeping on the couch for a few days. His answer will determine the rest of his life, their life.
One second he’s staring at the wall and the next there’s a body blocking his view. Tony blinks, takes in black workout pants and a billowy white shirt, a whiff of sweet perfume. Natasha then.
Bruce immediately turns Tony's head to the side and blood leaks out the corner of his mouth onto the dusty ground. He coughs and groans in pain and Steve feels so helpless, looks up to Bruce for help, and Bruce just stares grimly back, visibly struggling to keep calm.
He used to love going to baseball games with Thor; it was always entertaining trying to explain the rules of the sport to an alien prince who tends to expect more violence and bloodshed in his friendly competitions. Steve enjoys team dinners, though he could do without seeing the half-chewed food in Clint’s mouth during dinner-time debates, and the inevitable food fights that break out. He likes hanging out with Sam and Natasha after training sessions, walking down by the lake and shooting the shit. He even goes out sometimes with Clint to the dive bar a few miles south, in the nearest small town, and Steve watches him kick all the locals’ ass at darts until they get frustrated and refuse to play against him again (at least until the next time, because surely he’s not
Tony nods and accepts his apology and smiles when Steve tells him he loves him and kisses him back. It hurt, but Steve didn’t mean it, he knows that. Steve’s always been his biggest supporter, doing nothing but talking him up when Tony puts himself down.
"I think he's waking up," Steve says, voice tight. He's not sure how much English they know, but he knows at least the one man can understand what he's saying. He seeks him out, talks directly to him.
He’s still drinking but he can’t find it in himself to care. He knows it’s bad, that he’s probably at the point of being considered a functioning alcoholic, but he functions just fine. He makes stuff for SI, he goes to all the parties and galas that require his presence, attends all his board meetings, and even makes an effort to step outside the Tower when it’s not required by his work every once in a while.
Steve thinks Tony’s lips must be the softest thing he’s ever felt in his entire life. He pulls Tony closer, presses the smaller body up against his own, and he feels more than hears Tony groan before Tony’s opening his mouth to Steve, allowing his tongue entry.
He salutes to whoever is watching and speeds away, JARVIS guiding him toward the river. There are less Doombots here, and Tony can see Steve and Barnes fighting them off, back to back. His heart speeds up a little bit, watching them move together seamlessly, like they’ve been doing it forever, like it’s second nature. He swallows down the irrational surge of jealousy and pushes his thrusters faster, ignoring JARVIS’s warnings. He takes out two of the Doombots with repulsors on his approach, then lands and spins around, shooting a third in what he's going to label it’s head. It’s vaguely human-shaped, so he think’s he’s not wrong here.
There’s parties and booze and girls and guys and he’s got his new PA escorting them out the morning after, and it’s like he’s twenty years younger and high on life again. And if he feels empty afterwards, if he feels incomplete and dirty and like a waste of fucking space, no one really needs to know.
The next time he wakes up, he is able to blink his eyes open. They stick a little, like when he's been sick, and his vision is foggy. The breathing tube is gone, at least he's assuming that's what it was last time he woke up, thank god for that. He blinks a few more times to clear his vision, and then he takes in his surroundings.
He’s bending down to pick up Jamie’s nappy when the Avengers alarm begins to blare loudly. Jamie cries out and Steve bolts upright, the small blanket clutched tightly in his hand, mouth a thin line.
“But see, if I do that there’s too much power rerouted to the jet boots and then I fly straight into the ceiling — again — and your father wouldn’t like that very much. You don’t even want to know how long I was banned from the workshop after he saw the tapes of the initial Iron Man testing, it was terrible, I was a prisoner in my own house, my own
Tony’s eyes flicker and his face softens. He takes a step toward Steve, and another, reaching out until he can grip Steve’s arm in his callused hand.
“I— I can’t—“ Steve cuts himself off. Opens the hand in both of Tony’s and grasps at Tony’s fingers, grip tight enough that it almost hurts. Tony doesn’t say anything, doesn’t think, because he doesn’t know what this means, and it’s too much to try and guess right now.
Tony snorts. “Thanks for the pep talk, Cap, but I really don’t need it. I’m right where I’m supposed to be. And I know you guys are doing just fine without Iron Man, so let’s drop this before it turns into one of our famous screaming matches, huh?”
“Sure, no problem. I mean, yeah, JARVIS already has an alert set for any time something Winter-Soldier-esque pops up, so I can just have him let you know too. It’s really not a favor at all, it’s adding another, like, three lines of code. Seriously.” Tony shakes his head. Drinks some more. “Did you need anything else? Like, an actual favor? Something I can actually help you with? I mean, even outside of the whole Barnes thing. What are you doing? You don’t even have a job anymore, do you. Do you even have a place to live?”
Steve feels a smile pulling at the corners of his mouth and wrestles it back down. He puts on his sternest look. “I do have clothes that aren’t khakis, Tony,” he says, voice mild.
After a couple of minutes which he spends breathing shallowly while the nurse putters around checking his vitals and charts and drips, he's finally got his breath back.
Except it happens again. It’s less an insult and more just an explosion of temper this time, and Steve literally storms out of the penthouse and leaves the Tower at 2 in the morning and Tony is a mess because he has no idea when he did to set him off this time. Some smart ass comment, but that’s Tony, that’s what he does, and Steve knows that, but now it’s like they’re back at square one, like that first day on the helicarrier when everything Tony said was like nails on a chalkboard to Steve and hackles were raised and everything was taken the wrong way on both sides. Except now it’s just one way and Tony doesn’t know how they got here.
“Oh yeah?” Steve says, keeping his voice light. Tony nods once, head flopping heavily down then back into the pillow.
Tony wiggles his eyebrows lasciviously. “Well you certainly don’t help me there, do you, soldier?” Steve rolls his eyes but he’s smiling, so Tony takes it as a win.
The readouts match what he says, showing the location of the lab. Tony turns back to Steve, who’s still got the blanket clenched in his hand. He looks concerned, but then his Captain face takes over and he nods tightly.
He pulls Steve closer and starts moving to the beat, body swaying. Steve doesn’t know where to put his hands, and Tony must notice, because he grabs them and puts them on his hips, then puts his own in the air over his head, still moving to the music.
“Tony, I absolutely can blame myself!” Steve sounds dismayed. “There’s no excuse for me doing something like that, no matter how angry I am with someone. Especially to you. You deserve better than that.”
“Have it your way,” he says, slurring slightly. “What’s up Stevie-poo? It’s Wednesday, you’re not due here for another two days.”
The friend and Tony settle on the other couch, while the woman in red sits down next to Steve and reaches out to touch his shoulder, leaning in to speak into his ear. She smells like vodka and floral perfume, and her voice is sultry and deep, with the tiniest hint of an eastern European accent.
Tony interrupts him back. "Yes, tomorrow. He's not going anywhere tonight, I promise, and you need to get some rest because I'm pretty sure we're going to jump right into this the minute we land, right, and we need to make a plan because he's not just a guy we're going to rescue, he's a legendary trained assassin we might have to abduct against his will and he's kind of in hostile territory and I'm going to have to pull out all the stops on this one, so I need at least a few hours to prepare for it."
“I’m sorry, Tony, I’m so sorry—“ Steve gets out before his voice chokes off. He turns and all but runs to the waiting elevator, and Tony doesn’t actually see him leave through his own tears.
“Cap,” he greets. “How are you?” He does his best to keep his voice casual; He’s not sure if he succeeds. He wipes his shaking hands on a rag, leaving grease marks behind on the white cloth.
A laugh startles out of Steve. He shakes his head, smiling, arm still extended. “I’ve fought in a war. I’m 29 years old. I don’t understand why everyone thinks I’m some delicate flower.”
“I love you,” he mumbles happily, sweetly, and Tony freezes. Steve must feel Tony’s body go rigid, must rewind and realize what he said, because then he freezes, too. The hand clamped on Tony’s waist tightens, then he puts the spoon down on the counter next to the stove, turns the burners down to low, and grasps the back of Tony’s neck firmly with his now free hand, holding Tony to him. He’s stroking the short hairs at the back of his neck soothingly, and Tony relaxes a little at a time, unable to stay tense under the soft caress.
