“You’re pure trouble, aren’t you?” Tony asks, breathless when they seperate. “I should know. Connoisseur speaking here.”
And all of the stories are full of lies because it’s freezing out and Tony feels every bit of it; the rabbit-race of his heart does nothing to make up for his forgotten jacket. His shout of ‘Dr. Rogers’ is drowned out by an ill-timed kick of wind so with a rush of nerves, he jogs down the sidewalk and tries again, “Steve!”
Peter plucks at the hem of his shirt, smiling faintly. “Okay. Um, thanks, Mr. Stark. Tony. I really—thanks. I’ll see you guys later.”
“And people have got the nerve to say romance is dead,” Peter quips but he’s looking on avidly. His stare ping-pongs between Steve and Tony.
Steve buries his face into his pillow, indents a loud and reverent
His wondrous words evidently inspire a strong initiative in Steve, spur him to prove Tony wrong because Tony’s practically swallowed whole, most of his cock sucked into the hot and merciless vacuum that is Steve’s mouth. It’s a shock to his system and Tony’s fingers spasm at his side, have to dig into the mattress hard to keep steady and not lose how Steve’s hair falls into his eyes, the giving, giving stretch of those lips that turn nearly white in their ambition. Tony’s so close and coiled, he can taste it behind his teeth and on the roof of his mouth, coated on his tongue. He tags the back of Steve’s throat, feels it flutter around him and Tony can’t even get out a warning before he’s coming.
The Big Dipper again, a Christmas tree that might actually be holly and ivy, a star. It then slowly shivers into a vertical line, a space between that and an ‘L’ followed by an ‘O’, and Tony’s lungs feel like they’re vanishing but his brain is still online and there’s no mistaking what Steve’s writing:
“The whole world will want a piece of him. The media could discover that he’s Spider-Man, put demands on him that he’s not ready for. When he became your intern, articles ran for nearly a week.”
"Cap?"
“Shh, it’s alright, baby. Daddy’s here. It’s okay,” Tony shushes, lightly kissing the top of his head and his temple, trying to coax him back to sleep. “Daddy’s right here. Let’s go to sleep, buddy.”
“There. Right there. Keep doing that. Do that forever. Don’t stop,” Tony gasps out, each word punctuated by a sucking in of air. Roughly, he bounces on Steve’s cock with an urgency that causes his heavy, generous cock to flop, swing up and slap his stomach on the downbeat. Precome and sweat leave a sheen of liquid silver on his vibrant and flushed skin, limned by the reactor’s light.
It’s amazing and terrible.
“Will you fuck me?” Steve asks in a hush. His fingers are just as quiet where they’re scuffing Tony’s back, trailing just above his ass and then skating up his sides.
“You’re the worst disciplinarian. I love it,” Tony murmurs softly from a nose away when he comes up for air. He presses a heady kiss that ebbs to chaste against Steve’s lips, soft and softer like he’s remembering something new each time. He sits back on his heels, running his hands up seemingly whatever part of Steve he can reach, upsetting the grain dusting outer thighs and skating inner thighs and hips. He grazes Steve’s stomach that momentarily caves in under the gentle attention, and then retraces back down. “Is it alright if I touch you?” Tony asks, now not budging an inch.
If they were anywhere else—anyone else—it might be considered more than a sarcastic exchange between teacher and student, more like teasing banter meant to lead somewhere direct, flirting.
“Oh God.” Steve arches into the too-hot and taunting grip and wanting to prolong the ache.
“Start at the back and circle around to the cafe?” Steve suggests to Tony, once everyone’s gotten bored of them.
“Just.” Fingers squeezing Steve’s, Tony exhales shakily, nosing under Steve’s ear. “Open it, please.”
There’s not much of a crowd, a scattering of small clusters and pairs making up the gallery’s patrons. Their animated conversations turn into an excited murmur when Steve takes off his sunglasses, and the next few minutes proceed as they tend to. One person nervously asks for a photo, which emboldens their friend to follow suit and in a blink, there’s a line.
“Seeing as how monetary compensation would be ill-spent on me, Sir, I’m quite satisfied with our current arrangement of unsettled IOUs,” JARVIS responds, level and full of sass.
Resorting to what worked when Peter was just weeks old with colic, Tony ends up fitting him into a light jacket and piling them into the Subaru he still can’t believe he actually owns but has proven to be reliable for discretion as well as safety.
“I’ll take care of you,” Tony promises in the humidity of Steve’s pelvis and his crotch that’s dampened with sweat. He dips his head and the tongues the heavy cock that curves away from Steve’s body toward the left, maps it from the base and follows the vein that leads to the head. He ignores the throb in his own in favor of tasting the precome that’s been dripping waxlike, dragging his tongue across the slit. “Fuck, love how wet for me you are, Steve.”
“Thought you said—” He’s cut off by Tony’s hand tightening at the base of him and then jacking up to the leaking head with a truly spectacular corkscrew. Tony’s just too good at this, and Steve's next words come out on a gasp. “What happened to cooling me off?”
And through the remainder of the morning and afternoon, he gives Tony no reason to believe that he is.
The new angle allows for Steve to slide down the seat a little, plant his feet with scrunched toes and fuck at the spot that gets Tony to cry out once he’s found it, loud in the quiet of the garage. Having always been a quick study, Steve hits home over and over again.
“God yes. There you go, uh god, that’s it, feels amazing. Love how you feel inside me,” Tony murmurs, fucking himself on Steve’s fingers and seeking more, greedy for it. In the hitch of his leg over Steve’s midsection, the lock of his ankles, and the bow of his back bringing them chest to chest, he says it wordlessly.
“Jesus, Steve,” he moans. It turns into more of a high whine when Steve lets Tony feed him his cock, lift his hips and make a few passes over Steve’s tongue. Tony watches precome drip waxlike, the color of pearl on a pretty pink. What’s collected on the tip of Steve’s tongue is curled back and swallowed. “Oh fuck, Steve. Sweetheart, how are you real? You’re not real. So gorgeous.”
“Let’s see how you do, smooth-talker,” Steve says, humming and suggestive. His smile pulls like taffy, and then he’s nipping at a tendon in Tony’s neck. And all of that combined is evidently a shot to Tony’s cock, making it jump.
“Where’s Steve?”
Tony is more mound than man when Steve returns.
“Tony, I—”
“Yes, I got that connection. I take it back. You’re very imaginative when you want to be,” Steve says with a slight laugh that sounds as clogged as Tony feels but his eyes are crinkled at the corners and his smile is happy if a bit confused. “Why didn’t you give this to me last night?”
Tony stuffs his hands in the pockets of his pants and smiles regretfully. “Anything I can do to help? I think that this is the whole purpose of having a private jet. I can make a quick call for you. Get you to wherever you want to go.”
“Hot damn. I like you honest,” Tony says, grinning. He catches Steve’s elbow and with a move that has him huffing, he wrenches Steve down until they’re bent toward each other, side by side. His fingers walk up Steve’s front and hook into the collar of his shirt. And, as if he’s done it a bunch, Steve’s hands bracket Tony’s hipbones, brush against the warm skin from where his sweater has rucked-up. Tony shivers, and Steve draws him in closer.
“Hmm. That’s new. It doesn’t even jiggle like a bowl of jelly. More like a dense fruitcake.” Tony comments, amused.
Steve does as instructed and when the shield returns to him, fast and polished, he looks lit up from the inside. Awed. Tony’s name leaves him in an exhalation of wonder.
“How are you not used to this after fifteen years?” Cap wonders, still unhelpful and avoiding his paperwork by any means.
Steve loses time and absently recognizes its passage by the sweat and tears he blinks out of his half-lidded eyes; his hair curtains his vision, his gooseflesh covered forearms wobble, and his cock throbs. Indecent noises fill the bedroom, the point of Tony’s tongue fucking into him wetly and then the lewd, sharp sound of sucking intervening, and it buzzes Steve’s blood. Pockets of air punch out of him alongside Tony’s name, needy, strangled in his attempts to stay quiet.
“If he can be reached and if he can be brought back, what good is it with you dead, huh?” Tony challenges. Steve is a brilliant tactician but when the situation is close, personal, he’s ridiculously short-sighted. He’s not looking far enough ahead. “Because that damage is irreversible, Steve. It’d break him completely, so, if not for your own sake, for his, you need to figure out a way to do this without a damn death wish.”
Tony hums appreciatively, tugging on the ends, playing them between the spaces of his fingers. “Kinda feel like I win either way,” he murmurs.
Peter nods and they sit in a comfortable silence that stretches long enough for Steve to finish his sketch and for Peter to start the Steinbeck novel, dislike it and replace it with a printing of
“An unnamed one.”
“Hey,” Tony starts, and he really had no chance of pulling this off straight-faced. “You put us here.”
“Since when?” Tony asks, the tone pale. “Fuck, since when?"
“Farms aren’t really my style,” Tony says after a bit, shaking that particular fantasy loose. And to not be a total prick, he continues with, “But I’m adaptable.”
Resting his knuckles on Tony’s forehead, Steve frowns. “I think it’s the flu. You’re roasting hot, Tony.”
Sighing, “Tony, don’t—”
“JARVIS, you do your namesake proud,” Tony says, with some vigor. “Okay scratch the last search and switch to keywords: Carter, director, Howard, Stark, accident. Eliminate whatever comes up prior to 1991.”
“Technically, you didn’t ask,” Steve replies, flat, but the playful twitch at the corner of his mouth is easy to spot now that Tony is an expert on its evolution. He mozies over to a table buckling under crates of tomatoes and cucumbers in a strut.
Tony’s staring at dusty military-grade boots until Rhodey gets with the program, flips his phone camera, and his bright grin that Tony can’t help but return takes up half of Tony’s monitor, a backdrop of cloudless sky behind him.
“Don’t need it,” Steve says, perfectly content. “Living this life with you and Peter, right here, it’s good enough for me.”
“Stop talking.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve says with every ounce of truth he has left.
“What? But you could fix it faster than that. Did you ask if you could get a look at it?” Steve asks with slight desperation because Chicago’s heatwave is absolutely miserable and according to the local news, there’s not a break in sight. The thought of spending another hour boxed in their room with no relief makes his overheated skin itch. That or it’s the chemically treated sheets which are currently losing their staunch wrinkle-free press under the persistence of Steve’s sweat. The duvet is already puddled on the floor, shoved off the bed after Steve had flung away the pillows in annoyance.
Steve is terrified that's it too much and more than fate meant to deal out to him but he wants this, with Tony and with Peter. He’d fight the world for them. He’s a soldier who’s prepared to fight the world for them.
.” It’s rapt, as though Steve has done something profound. Tony skims the ice down and blows the trail left in its wake, gets Steve squirming. “Love how sensitive you are, sweetheart. It’s so fucking beautiful. Fuck, I can’t believe that you’re letting me do this. You’re so good to me. Want to rub off just looking at you.”
He swallows but the everything still comes out unchewed and dense. He’s never allowed himself to practice, to hope that he’d get to say this, especially not in the past twenty-three days. “When I prayed to see you again, if by some miracle I ever did, I said I’d take you however I could get you. I’d take your anger and your hate. If you never spoke to me again, I’d take your silence. I’d take every fight with you and never grow tired of them. But you’re right. I’m a liar. Because I’m tired already. I’m exhausted. I’m sitting here and a fight with you is so far from what I want, Tony. It doesn’t make sense to be fighting you here and going to a fight up there.”
“Shit. JARVIS,” Tony starts urgently, tapping his wrist and waking up his newest suit, “contact the nearest hospital and tell them that they have Captain America incoming with two GSWs. Send over all of his cleared medical records.”
”Dude, that sounded like a date to me.”
“Of course.” Joking, to relax the tension in Tony a fraction at least, Steve adds lightly, “It is your tower.”
“Not putting the brakes on it anytime soon either.”
“Nope!” Tony hip-checks him away from the countertop when Steve reaches for a gingerbread but Steve’s got quick hands that seriously put Tony to shame. One curls into the hem of Tony’s shirt, tugging him back as the other sneak-thieves a cookie whose head is bigger than its body.
“Not awful. Baby steps, you know? But it feels good not to have conversations with my son be wholly awkward anymore. And I think he might actually have real plans to be a normal teenager today,” Tony explains. Steve’s comforting kiss and fan of fingers at his jawline tells Tony he doesn’t really come through with the levity he was aiming for.
Steve stares after him dumbly.
But Tony’s alive, too.
Tony rolls his eyes but two can play at that. He kneads the thick of Steve’s thighs and delights in the squawking gooselaugh before he stretches out with his head in Steve’s lap.
Steve rubs at his forehead with his free hand and looks around, entirely too conscious of tipsy passersby who couldn’t care less about what’s going on between them. Pained, he says, “
“My mother died when I was about your age,” Steve tells him, leaning forward. “At first, it felt impossible, trying to move on. Whatever part of me that the grief didn’t eat up, the guilt did. Everyone told me that it would get easier and I didn’t believe them. But then it did.”
“Love me some bacon,” Tony replies, unapologetically. “You know if he’ll be there tomorrow?’
“Uh yeah,” Tony replies, syrup-slow and clasped around Steve. “I’m aware. Do you need an instruction manual or can we get this show on the road?”
“Eh, we can put that on the shelf for now. Think you do that well enough on your own. Too well. I’m saying he deserves some happiness and, from what it sounds like, so do you.” He lurches up. “Now, it’s gonna be a while before he’s back here which I’m sure you’re aware of. You feeling Mario Kart?”
Letting out a soft and pleased laugh, Steve teases, “I hear you loud and clear.”
“You know what? This was stupid. I’m a genius but the heat knocks off at least twenty IQ points. I should have known better. I’ll put this back, and we’ll just forget about it, okay? Won’t mention it again,” Tony says, breaking the deafening quiet that’s plummeted into dead air. He shakes his head, and the doubt writ on his face yields to decision. He’s opting for retreat, and that is what untangles the nerves for Steve, has him sort out that he does want this—to shake off this debilitating and manacled hold the ice has on him.
“Gravity is running rampant in these parts. Think I might have tripped over one of Peter’s,” Tony flails a hand out, gestures vaguely, “doohickies.”
Tony hooks his arms around Steve’s neck without question and Steve’s palms open on his back. He flips them over and suddenly Tony is on top with a sound that’s high and intelligible. However, he doesn’t have time to complain because Steve is kissing him while sneaking a clever and lube-slicked hand between them, finger and then fingers pushing huge into Tony, twisting out and back in. Mouth slack around a moan, he fucks himself on fingers that burn thick and seemingly touch everything inside of him. They then angle and press his prostate, stunningly electric and getting Tony to buck and abandon any semblance of restraint. Restless and with only half a mind, he grabs up the condom and tears it open.
Steve hums in agreement, watching them with a fond and tired smile, like there’s no place he’d rather be. Tony gets the feeling. With his hand stroking Peter’s dark, unruly hair, Steve murmurs, “He needs to go down soon, though. He hasn’t been up this late in months, and I don’t want his schedule thrown off. Remember how long it took to get him sleeping through the night?”
“No, man. It’s the same guy. Kill after kill, it’s been the same guy.”
Steve rolls his eyes.
“I was holding three, two-hundred pound men with the other hand, Tony,” Steve argues and the pout somehow deepens.
minute. However, after Tony ordered the elevator back up, Steve had just given him a thumbs up, his
“Wiseass.”
“Show me,” Tony begs, closing his hands at Steve’s jaw, beckoning him closer. He closes the space between them with an insistent kiss, aching for it. It kills him to think of how long he could have had this. “Please. Fuck me, babe. Show me, c’mon.”
Tony rolls his eyes. “I’d forgotten how annoying you can be.”
Steve gives himself over to Tony who gets him onto his hands and knees. Calling him
“What’s behind door number one?”
Tony takes flight for the first time in nearly five months and makes the trip in forty minutes.
be here tomorrow?”
Steve’s face flames in a fashion that has little to do with the heat, and the high whine that leaves his throat without permission is equally embarrassing. The finer nuances of language escape him again. “Ngh,” he moans, feeling his spent cock give a hearty twitch.
“Wow, this office really pulls your whole academia-slash-old man aesthetic together,” Tony comments after he’s taken a seat at Steve’s desk and a swivel around, taken inventory of all the knicks and all the knacks and most of the titles that stuff the bookcase, some worn and some newer. “You’ve got post-its peeking out from the top of your books and an open box of greeting card sized envelopes tucked in the middle shelf. How much did it kill you to send that email? It’s like typewriter rebellion up in here. It should be obnoxious and offensive to everything I stand for but it’s not because it’s you and you make everything endearing. Which is consequently annoying.”
, deliberate in its multiplicity—that Tony has in hand. They start at the ridge of Steve’s collarbone, running over his throat with stings of teeth and ice, and taking detours along his sides that are bittersweet and short-lived in the tinderbox space between their bodies. It turns Steve into a mess; saliva and ice-melt trickle down the crease of his thigh and his ass. Tony comes back up his body with slippery ease, a squelching noise that they don’t print in Harlequins. They both laugh, and that too is with ease; it’s nice.
“Agent Margaret Carter was the Director of SHIELD at that time, Sir. You have neglected to include her in the parameters of your search. It is a substantial piece of information to neglect.”
“—it's all yours,’” Peter finishes in a long groan, raking his fingers down his face in abject misery.
“Are you going to send it back here?” Steve asks.
Tony reluctantly lets him go but stays close, watching him pull out the card, a clear embossed snowflake on its front and only Tony’s script on the inside.
It’s not his most sterling moment and the silence sits long enough for Steve to get the wrong idea, his nervous and beautiful smile thinning to a frown that just won’t do. Because Tony recognizes that it’s been exactly six months with Steve, label or no label. It’s been six months with beautiful, incredible Steve who memorizes Tony’s schedule, notes his sleeping habits, and can’t bake for shit. And Tony can't stand the thought of losing him, needs him to know that this has been the best six months of his life. That he wants countless more because since the day he met Steve there's been this feeling--nagging, insistent, nudging--that Tony couldn't find proper words for but he thinks it has something to do with the rest of his life.
“Steve,” Tony murmurs, entirely real. His eyes look past the shoulder of the armor and straight at Steve, electric and punching the wind out of him. “So fucking good, Steve. It feels so good. Ah, shit. I can’t. I have to--god.”
But there aren’t any kisses, and Steve can’t deny the possessive thrill that curls in him, how the thought gets his hand to close around his throbbing cock and pull urgently, imagining himself in the armor’s place. Steve imagines tonguing Tony’s mouth open and not stopping until he learned his rhythm and his taste beyond spit and the salt of effort. He imagines learning how Tony likes to be teased and his preferred angles, how to make him writhe and gasp and beg, how to bring back that wicked smirk, and exactly how many exclamations of ‘god’ would get Steve to consider answering to it.
Steve also knows a labor of love when he sees it. This isn’t the typical Tony-present. Attention and consideration have gone into this. Not that the tailored suits, watches, canvases, gadgets, or any other unapologetically extravagant gift that Tony has ever given him were thoughtless. No, of course not. But this car, this particular project, took precious time. That much is evident. The kind of time that Tony only spends on what truly matters to him. Like a jigsaw puzzle, the last several months--all of the rushed explanations for late nights, early mornings, sporadic Stark Industries commitments, and the grease that cuffed his wrists more often than usual--click together and finally make sense.
“I want Princess Peach,” Tony insists, accepting a controller and dropping into Sam’s sectional.
“You know there's only one way that's gonna happen.”
“He didn’t remember me,” Steve admits, fragile and bitter. He sounds angry, and from Tony's own experience with self-deprecation—the tone is as familiar as breathing—he knows exactly where that anger is directed. “Everything I tried, everything I said, none of it worked. There’d be glimpses, flashes that left quicker than the came, but nothing stuck.”
“I guess I head out to a twenty-four hour store, buy some ready-made ones. You can’t have Christmas Eve without cookies.”
“Nope, turns out that you’re just not as stubborn as I pegged you for,” Sam clarifies with a laugh. “That or you’re deeper in love with Steve Rogers than I thought.”
“You wanna bump up
Jerking involuntarily, shocked, shy and uncertain, Steve let out shakily, “Oh. Tony, you shouldn’t. I’m not--I didn’t.” The thought of Tony’s mouth there--Steve couldn’t have prepared for this, clean or not. But not is decidedly embarrassing.
A wet kiss is fiercely pressed to Steve’s cheek and persistent on his chin and lips.
“And what’s changed?”
“Steve, all I can think about right now is checking the internet to see if Peter is too young to be ordained because I want to say I do as soon as possible,” Tony tells him, half-serious. He is wholly serious when he adds on, “I want to marry you. I cannot anticipate a happier moment in my life than marrying you.”
“And if—miracle of miracles—you do find him? What then? He nearly killed you.”
“Sam’s important to you and he’s good people. What’s not to appreciate?” Tony replies with a shrug. He reaches for another bag and finds something labeled chili-lime sweet potato chips. “Kind of don’t want to let him have these though. Um, what are these and why don’t they have them at our—the one back in New York?”
“No, I’m not. Wow. You could use some lessons on how to take a compliment.”
“Jesus. That’s what—”
Steve knows his way around an engine, can work on his own bike with his eyes closed, and he’s learned a great deal since moving into the tower, but cars are unquestionably Tony’s forte. Together they circle the bespoke body of the roadster. Steve listens to Tony passionately describe how he integrated the classic and new to create the restomod, the timeline of its complicated build, and why he chose to outfit the car the way he did.
Because Tony can come off nonchalant about a good number of things but when he cares and  lets go of the veneer Steve had misunderstood at the start, he’s so thoughtful and giving. He’s generous here, putting Steve’s pleasure, and most importantly, Steve’s comfort first, and that fact mobs Steve’s heart and cock with an urgent race of blood.
Two nights in a row, Steve dreams of being thirteen again and plunged deep into a bout of pneumonia. His heart jack-knifes in his chest because at his bedside, he hears the fervent prayers of Father Doyle and Ma’s terrible hitching sobs, variations of a goodbye.
Christmas Eve is exchanging gifts early and Steve crying as he unwraps a restored black and white photograph of Joe and Sarah Rogers coming through Ellis Island more than a hundred years ago. It's the first picture of them he’s ever owned. He tells Tony the story his mother had passed down to him: the camera she’d seen, how startled she’d been by its flash. Eyes like Steve’s are wide and her thin hand clutches her husband's. There’s strength in the angle of her jaw, also so much like Steve.
“How could I not have when I was looking at you the entire time?”
“No one’s going to.” Snorting a laugh, Tony takes the baking sheet off of the counter and dumps everything on it into the trash. “They’re better suited for the incinerator, honestly, but it’s too far away.”
Steve rolls his eyes. “Oh, you're a real riot. Start writing, Tony.”
Decorum comes back on a brisk breeze and they pull away gasping, shivering into each other and holding on tightly. On Steve’s mouth, there’s amazement and Tony feels the same shaping his own, can taste it from his lips and all the way down to his weakened knees.
“Thyme, and making soup for someone doesn’t say ‘I want to be your boyfriend,’” Steve says, slicing more carrots and celery. He pauses, thinks about it objectively, and drops the knife in horror. He turns to Sam. “What am I doing?”
“Don’t sweat it. Don’t do that. We’re good.” Tony steps close to him, is careful not to hover. With his best efforts, he keeps his restless and empty hands to his sides. Quietly, “Hey, Steve. Hey, are you okay?”
“How exactly did you go from not having a clue on how to dance to wanting to do it every fucking two minutes?” Tony looks down and laughs. The delight on his face is better than anything and Steve steals a couple of buttercream-tinted kisses from his mouth. Drawing back, Tony tsks, “Uh, uh, uh. What the hell happened to your Ferragamos? Are you drunk, husband?”
“Last night was for you. Not for me. And I was too chickenshit. The first Christmas in recent memory where I didn't feel the need to stave off seasonal depression with a descent into gin felt like enough of a miracle,” Tony admits, cuffing Steve’s wrist and then slipping their hands together again. “And you are not allowed to judge me here, Mr. If-There’s-Ever-Anyone-Else-I’ll-Tell-You.”
"That doesn't sound too bad," Steve says and Tony bids an abrupt leave.
“That is the distinct cadence of teenage disownment. What’s this, your second infraction in two weeks?” Cap observes from his position on the couch, hunched over and sorting through mission reports that are more than likely past due. Peter spies leaflets of sudoku.
Tony winces, pulling a face. “Ouch. Are they that bad?”
“Turkey bacon is real bacon,” Steve tries. He passes his mug to Tony before grabbing cinnamon out of a cabinet.
“Until you were again.”
“Wish that you were coming.” A small smile creases Steve’s mouth. “Figured it’d be good practice before adoption services gets back in touch with us.”
“Keep on, Stark, and I’m leaving my office door open,” Sam threatens, giving him the stink eye until Tony puts his hands up in surrender.
“What late notice? ‘S not like I was planning on a rager from the garage to the penthouse. Mi casa es su casa,” Tony sing-songs, wiping off his greased fingers in a rag. He doesn’t think it’d go over well, mentioning that he and Sam have been texting since they left Washington. That it was his idea for Sam to come to New York. Instead, Tony makes grabby hands at Steve’s candy.
—enrapt with a painting’s dramatic blend of color and complimenting the bravery of one artist’s multimedia display. The exhibit is a tribute to African heritage and culture, and Steve doesn’t pretend to know everything that each label and panel refers to, picking the curator’s brain like a teacher’s pet whenever he has a question and increasingly curious at the tangents the answers introduce. Tony is way too old to find anything adorable but he’s charmed by Steve’s passion, finds him endlessly attractive when he sinks into a crouch to better admire the sculptures, hands close but not touching, fingertips hovering over the contours and swells of the man depicted.
The want formerly known as uncomplicated snarls.
“We found Thanos.”
“Aw, look at you,” Tony coos fondly, and he indulges in the urge to fan his fingers on Steve’s jaw, thumb a bit of stubble that his razor missed under his ear. He kisses him properly and then gives his chest a sympathetic pat. “Watch and weep, Cap.”
Tony makes a last ditch effort. “No way I can convince you that I’m an incredibly considerate human being and wanted to catch you at an hour that’s not godforsaken to chat and reconnect?” Rhodey doesn’t bite so Tony sighs. “I might be into Steve Rogers, and I need someone to reinforce what an awful idea that is while he’s not here because for some reason Steve has a habit of living in the workshop, which is fine but also makes me sort of cagey since I then have to actively school my face not to make heart eyes at him.”
And finally Steve kisses him. It starts with the teasing brush of lips and happy exhales against mouth and eyelids and cheeks before he’s urgently tugging Tony against him and licking into Tony’s mouth in a way that can only be defined as plundering. And god, Steve giving up the ghost is glorious. He sucks on Tony’s lip after an eager bid behind his teeth, pulls it slick and salacious between his own. The sight of him is something else when he draws back, panting and flushed and Tony
Steve waits for the click of his bedroom door but minutes pass and nothing. He lifts open his eyes once more to see Tony tapping at a wristwatch impatiently. Stolen from the pages of
because, in the next heartbeat, a hit to the back drops Rogers onto the grate of the catwalk, clutching his front and seemingly motionless.
, follows it up with
“You’re a punk. There’s one more thing because I meant it when I said what’s important to you means something to me. That’s what makes these things work, right? So I’m not saying it’s going to be easy for me to look at Barnes when we do eventually get him back. I’ll see what he did to my parents, that he put you down for two rosaries worth, and I can’t promise to not be a lowkey jerk about that at the start but I won’t blame him.” And the distinction matters so he adds, “I don’t blame him. Now, I’m officially done declaring my love for you over your gross granny smith apples.”
Tony starts to take off the jacket, chuckling humorlessly.
“I think we can now agree that you're definitely coming down with something?”
“So, are we back on where we left off last night?” Steve asks eagerly.
Sam stares at Bucky. Then at the pair lying on the sofa.
“Atta boy!” Bucky yells as Steve rushes through the hallway.
“Hell yeah, it looked so good on you,” Steve confirms, taking off his jacket to put it over Tony's wet clothes. "Yup, much better on you."
Steve has the decency of looking regretful. “Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.”
“Don't think about that, and I won't think about it either. Deal?”
Steve groans in the pillow that he's using to suffocate himself.
Tony nods, taking himself a seat on the opposite side.
Of all the things he had expected Steve to say, this was something he would only have in his dreams. “What...”
Steve exhales. “You know what? I'm done with the teasing. I'm going back inside.” He grumbles, standing up and going towards the trashcan, where he promptly throws away the garbage before leaving the tray on top of it.
Bucky puts both of his palms up. “Understood.”
“You're not dreaming.”
Steve takes the jacket slowly, dumbfounded. “Can we please talk about this?”
“Hey, I'm okay.” Tony reassures softly.
Steve sighs. “I guess you have a point.”
“What are you talking about?” Steve stupidly asks, as if he didn’t know that Tony has figured out everything.
Steve splutters. Tony pretends to cough to hide the chuckle.
“Did you know they think you're older than me?”
He breaks the kiss, suddenly feeling like he can't breathe.
special, we would have already met him, right?”
“You don't need my help. Go and tell him, even if you already might have said last night.”
Steve glares at him. “Are you a parrot?”
Oh lord, what did he do, and how does he find out without asking Tony.
Steve blinks, looking up from his cellphone. “Um, what?”
It's not like he wants to keep Tony a secret.
Tony's hands stay on his face. “Uh, we were doing an experiment for professor Banner's class, and we needed the wind for it. We had been waiting for a windy day, because a little wind wouldn't do much. Today turns out was going to be very windy and we took our change, went up to the roof, got everything together and were ready to go—“
“Oh my god, you might be onto something here.” Natasha continues unhelpfully. She turns fully to face Steve, who at this point is just looking at them like they lost their minds. “Steve, this is a safe place. You can tell us anything, he might be older but he doesn't get to make you do what you don't want.”
“You gotta stop doing that too, because I lose my train of thought.” Tony gasps when they come apart, but there's a smile on his face when he says it, so Steve doesn't take it seriously.
That went better than he expected.
“Nothing has changed in that front.”
Which was the wrong thing to say, because Tony stops moving and slowly raises his head to look at Steve, confused. He just stares for what feels the longest time, and then he gives a deep sigh. “I knew this would happen.”
Steve finally reaches the bed, and lies gently next to Tony. “Hmmm, can't really argue with that.” He says, moving in for a kiss. Steve will really never get tired of kissing Tony, of the way Tony simply molds into him, the little sigh that escapes his lips every time. And to think he almost lost this, just because things went wrong for a second ; it just wrecks him.
“If you call her that to her face, you'll be the one dead.” Both Rhodey and Tony say.
Steve chuckles shortly. “Tell me about it.”
“Are you okay now?”
Steve snorts. “Yes, he has. I think he's a bit too fascinated with the whole genius boyfriend thing.”
“I know you feel the same. Don't try to deny it. Natasha told me everything.”
“Is it in the laundry basket?” Bucky responds, flipping the next page of the comic he's reading.
“Thanks for the confidence.” Steve deadpans. “You're supposed to be on my side, you know?”
~^FIN^~
Steve deflates. “It's so crazy how invested they are on this.”
Steve chuckles.
“Did you prepare a picnic?” Tony adds, looking down at the basket on the center of the blanket.
Lying there in the dark, Steve promises himself to not let the accident shape their future together.
“What's the problem?” Steve asks.
“Then, fucking, tell him.”
“Do you feel different about him?” Bucky asks staring at the ceiling.
“It's not about the undercover.” Steve quickly assures.
“Shit, are you bleeding?!”
“I am. And it's okay if you don't feel the same by the way. I just— I needed to tell you.”
And Tony, well, he will also never complain about that.
Since Fisk almost killed Steve.
Tony blinks back tears. “Are you sure?”
Steve shudders. “Oh hell no.”
“It's very simple, Bucks. Tony is what they call a genius. He's way ahead of his age. You should see the things he can create with his own hands. It's like having a glance to the future, if you asked me. It's truly amazing.”
Tony decides to wake up right on that moment, blinks and looks at everybody around staring at each other. “Are we on a Mexican stand off?” He asks sleepy.
“Really?”
Steve blushes slightly. “Don't call him that.”
He knows it's a catch 20-20. If he confesses Tony might feel the same way and they will keep going being truthful to themselves. If Tony doesn't feel the same way, it will get awkward, and that might cause more problems. But Steve wouldn't let that happen. He just needs to live with the truth out front or he can't be a good leader.
Steve’s eyes go warm. “I won't. I promise.”
“I—“ Steve blushes bright red. “I really don't have an excuse. I'm very sorry to at least not have told you about him. I just.... I don't know Bucky. When I'm with Tony, time just ceases to exist. It's just him and me. I know, it sounds corny as hell, but it's the truth. And I guess when I realized how much time had actually passed without me saying anything, I just couldn't figure how to tell you anymore. And mom? Mom literally met him last week. That's how bad at this I'm being. She almost whacked me with the broom for keeping it from her too. I didn't mean to make you feel like I don't trust you, Buck. I do, very much. We have known each other since we were in the crib, and been in the same family since we were five. If there's anyone I trust the most, it is you.”
Steve's resolve banishes. “You don't think I'm ashamed of you, right?”
“Nope.” Steve sighs. “I looked everywhere already, three times at that, and can't find it.”
The three watch as Steve disappears inside.
“And you didn't tell me?!” Clint whines next to her.
Tony laughs, freely, head turned back. It's the most beautiful sight Steve has ever seen and will never stop loving seeing.
Steve jumped, almost dropping his tablet. He looked up to were the unholy sound just came from. “Uh, Tony?”
They find the room pretty quickly with the simple directions of the nurse. Steve's lungs lose all the air as soon he sees Tony. He takes it all in: the cast on his left leg, and the bruises on his face. But he's sitting up with the help of the bed, talking to Rhodey as if he wasn't currently laying in the hospital. That makes Steve able to breathe back again.
Bucky stares at Sam who just burst through the front door.
Steve thought it was because Tony didn't work well as a team member and didn't listen to his orders when it mattered the most. But Tony is a good team member, and his anger was misplaced with the worry of something happening to Tony because of not following the plans. It blinding him so much sometimes, that he would lose his temper and they would just have it right in front of the rest of the team.
Steve clears his throat. “That's because he is.”
Steve smiles softly at him, feeling his chest expand with more warmth. He should have known Tony would understand. “I just don't want you to think I'm ashamed of our relationship.”
“But it doesn't change that Rhodey and Pepper know.”
“You'll get over I once you rest and get some medications in you.”
“Probably because they respect you. But you can't keep pushing it.”
“Sorry, mom.” He says blushing, ashamed to have been caught swearing.
Bucky looks down at Tony. “You really love him, huh?”
“No, I meant, sorry. He's sixteen, and he's a junior at MIT.”
“Really?”
Tony makes an affirmative sound.
“Wouldn't dream of it!” Tony answers once he's out of another daze, and as the door for the lab closes.
“If I wake up and this is all in my head, I'll be so mad.” Tony jokes to calm the electricity running through his veins.
“It's not funny, Steve!”
“You're right. I'm surprised they've let me get away with it this long.”
“Not in that body you won't.”
Tony spits some water out of his mouth muttering under his breath "We gotta stop doing this", then looks up at Steve. “What are you doing here?”
Bucky blinks, once, twice, by the third his mouth opens and then closes again. “How the fuck is that possible?”
Steve's response is to flip him off.
“Wait a minute. Are you jealous?”
“Damn, he's so gone for this Tony.” Sam states. “He must be something special.”
“Uh, Steve shouldn't you ask, you know...
“Hi, Mr. Stark!” Peter answers entering the shop hurriedly. “I got something for you.” He continues as he reaches inside his pocket. From it, he takes a folded paper, "Here.”
“I'm happy for you. And if you screw it up, I will be the one who whacks you on the head.”
Bucky huffs. “I said, that you think the Yankees are better, right?”
“Beside my face looking like it went a round with the ground and lost? Nope. That will be it, sir.”
Steve feels the punch on his shoulder, and gasp loudly. He blinks owlishly eyes at Bucky.
Steve shrugs. “I don't know.”
“Hi,” Steve salutes shyly. “Thank you for coming.” He approached Tony, getting closer, “I'm glad you did.”
Bucky sighs, then nods. “Okay, I get it, I think. Just don't do that again? It kinda hurt a bit that you wouldn't confide something that's obviously so important to you with me, when we tell each other everything.”
“Well most of it.” Rhodey corrects.
“I get that now. Man, I feel so light out of the sudden.”
“And that's when the wind picked up too much, and sent one of the arms of the machine straight into Tony, who then toppled over the edge, three stories down.” Rhodey finishes.
“I take you out on a date.”
“James, watch your damn language!” Sarah Rogers, hollers from the kitchen not too far away from them.
They used to fight. A lot.
“Are you really okay?” Steve murmurs against Tony's ear, after a while, when he feels like he can finally talk.
“Nothing to talk about, bud. Don't worry about it.” Tony pats him on the chest and then turns around to leave.
Everybody turns to look at Steve, suddenly very interested in his answer.
“Yep, sir. Tomorrow, at 6, be ready.” Steve can't help himself and gives Tony a soft peck on the lips. “Don't be late.” Are his parting words.
Bucky flips him off.
“Maybe you left it in one of the classrooms,” Natasha adds.
“A lot to take, I know.”
Yes, he's well aware he sounds like the most selfish person ever. But honestly, it doesn't bother him that much, because this is about Tony. Steve is pretty sure he fell for him the moment they said hello at the coffee-shop right on his way home and near Tony's school.
Tony looks at him, mouth slightly agape. “You're serious.”
“You owe me. I don't know what, but you so owe me for this.”
“Could have been worse.” Bucky shrugs.
“Aw c'mon, Stevie! We're just messing with you!” Bucky calls out to his friend’s retrieving back.
Steve ignores the banter, and strides to the bed, his fists clenched at his sides, because he's dying to touch Tony and make sure he's not an illusion, but he doesn't know if he can. Tony looks at him apologetically, and breaks the barrier by grabbing one of Steve's fists.
Tony chuckles. “Your friends nagging you about us again?”
“Steven, I don't think it's appropriate for you to ask such a things in front of Bucky.” Tony jokes.
“Hey, Steve?”
look, that makes Tony's mouth snap shut.
“Apparently not. Did I hit my head? I hit my heat didn't I?”
“You don't have to stay,” Tony whispered sadly.
Now it's Steve’s turn to chuckle. “They just worry about you.”
Tony stops fiddling with his shirt and goes back to staring at Steve. “What?”
Steve exhales heavily, blinking the tears away, and nods.
Bucky gets up and claps Steve's shoulder. “Don't worry buddy, we'll find it.”
“I love you too.”
Steve, Rhodey, and Bucky look at him.
“Tony, I've loved you all this time. Even if you hadn't changed, I would still be here today.”
Tony shrugged. “What's supposed to happen now?”
“And you're yet to present him to us.” Natasha says, her judgy tone barely contained.
“Because I might go back to being that man you didn't like. I've been clean for months, yes, but it's a struggle, and I know there will be a day where I falter on my steps and everything will go to ruins. What then? You'll hate me for it and it would be worse than your indifference.”
“Look at me—just breathe, okay?” Steve begged, pressing his hand harder against Tony's torso. Blood spilled between his fingers, and he cursed. “It's not that bad, we'll patch you up and you'll be good as new.” He kept talking, trying to not think about Tony barely responding to his touch. “Hey, stay with me,” he said panicked when Tony started to close his eyes. “Keep your eyes open, don't you dare give up on me.” His voice shook with the fear of losing Tony. He couldn't live without him, and Steve would be damn if he let that happen.
“I feel the same.” Tony blurts out.
“Pepper is out of town for another week, and I won't be around for two because of basic training.”
And the truth is he loves Tony. So he's telling him.
Bucky's mouth falls comically open.
Since Tony built the Iron Man.
Natasha looks at them both, and they can tell by it that she will find out who's Pepper and join forces with her to screw them.
“Really?”
He doesn't mean to scare Tony, but he can't stop his brain from screaming at him with all the possibilities where the accident didn't end up with the best outcome. He shakes his head, can hear his breath wheezing, and he's shaking, he knows he is. He hears Tony curse loudly, and then he feels himself being moved before he can catch up with what's happening. His face lands between Tony's shoulder and neck, and Tony's arms are surrounding him tightly, as if he doesn't want to let go ever again.
Steve finds Tony in the lab messing with the armor, as always.
“When I got shot,” Steve starts, placing a hand on Tony's elbow when he physically winces at the reminder of that. “I'm here, remember that.”
“Kinda like that.”
Steve pecks him on the forehead, and laughs when Tony's nose scrunches up for a minute, but then he's out like a light.
“Alright, so Bucky knows, now Sam has finally had the pleasure to meet me.” Tony says from the bed, as Steve moves around his room gathering stuff from the floor.
“Yeah, I thought I would never see you again.”
Steve answers readily, a soft chaste kiss to his lips that barely lasts seconds but always manages to warm his whole body. “Hey, yourself. You ready?” Steve asks, taking Tony's hand in his.
Both Rhodey and Tony look at him. Tony’s cheeks turn pink, as much as they can under the bruises.
Tony sighs, nods, and then falls into Steve chest, as he can't hold himself up anymore. “Feelings are exhausting.” He mutters.
Steve really doesn't.
“Your life flashed before your eyes sort of thing?”
With another big smile, Steve makes work of leaving Tony breathless.
“I might not remember, but I'm pretty sure  I told you that I love you.”
Bucky makes a pensive face. “I don't know, Sam. If he was
“We're both deaf today, apparently. I said I'm in love with you too.”
“Of course she does, Buck, why wouldn't she?”
Tony shuffled angrily out of the property, and Steve had to cover his mouth to contain himself. Otter!Tony turned around and glared at him. Steve lost the battle, cackling until tears were running down his face.
“I will try my very best, it's a promise.”
“So?”
allows Steve to get other points of view, and Steve's straight forwardness helps Tony to get to the point and make decisions easier. That Steve loves him even when Tony is rambling so many things at the same time and Steve can barely keep up, but he loves him even more when Tony realizes he's doing that and then takes his time to explain things to Steve without making him feel like an idiot. They don’t see that he's never felt like he's the only one giving his all in this relationship, because Tony makes sure to make him feel important. He isn't afraid to tell anything to Steve. And Steve reciprocates.
“Tony, no, wait.”
Bucky snorts, and then moves to extend his hand. “Nice to finally meet you, even in this circumstances.”
Before Tony could ask what he meant by that, he found himself in the air, his head dancing around the room before settling on Steve's back.
“And you must be the famous Tony.” Natasha answers, shaking his hand. “You look so much better up close. Steve, you got yourself a handsome one there.”
“Wat?” Tony sniffle, his voice coming out completely nasal.
“Very. Now I get to call Pepper. Excuse me.” He says, standing from the chair next to Tony's bed, and leaving the room, not before shaking Bucky's hand and exchanging a few words.
“Oh?”
Of course, Steve doesn't get to plan how to introduce Tony to his friends. Because life is just
“Shouldn't you be, like in bed or something?” Sam asks, note of concern in his voice.
Steve moves closer to embrace Tony completely. He sighs into Tony's shoulder. “You're right.”
“We don’t have a second house. We don’t even have a first house.” Steve uses his chopsticks to move the rest of his dim sum to Tony’s plate because resistance is futile. Plus Tony’s always liked it more anyway and Steve is passed stuffed on sashimi and noodles. “The thing is, I didn’t know that was in the cards. That you’d considered it. Getting married.”
“So, Peter,” Steve begins later when they’re all eating. “Your dad and I are going to a concert in the park later tonight, grabbing some ice-cream if you want to come with.”
It’s harder to say the second time around. No one’s ever let him in on that part of the jump, how much softer the vulnerability gets, how bare he feels but Steve screws up the courage. Again, louder, his voice terrible, “I love you. So much, Tony.”
this entire time then? You know your father has Feelings™ about online piracy. It unsettles his scruples.”
Tony grabs Steve by the hips and presses a hard kiss to his lips, once and again. And then it slows, shifting into something more intimate and involved, like they can’t kiss each other enough. It leaves them both breathless by the end, tucked into each other. Tony clutches Steve’s sides and sighs deep again, like he’s trying to shake something loose.
“Caught that? Yeah, just hold on a sec.”
A gaggle across the street rips through the new silence and awkwardly Steve asks, “So do you come here often?”
“Okay. I’m listening. What are you thinking?”
she says, and her brows rise in small shock when Steve follows through.
Feigning indignation, Tony palms his sternum. “Ouch.”
Theatrically because this wasn't going to happen without a little bit of a show, Tony drumrolls on the dashboard before Steve gets to strip off the covering and reveal the steering wheel. Laid in its center, like the car has its own arc reactor, is his shield, miniaturized and monochromatic. And there it is again, his love for Tony expanding to new edges, and it’s joined by a sharp shot of want, the potency so strong as it sparks under his skin that his grip on the wheel white-knuckles.
Steve makes a noise of disagreement, and Tony doesn’t believe it has anything to do with the physical journey he’s been through.
After Steve leaves them with another round of kisses and ‘good nights’, Tony looks down into Peter’s bright and thoughtful gaze. “You wanna hear about Daddy’s latest game-changer in renewable energy?”
“All of them and you know that. That list is enough of a turn-on that I’m considering a third round.” Tony nods because chances of him saying no were non-existent. “Okay, yeah let’s do it, I’m cultured. Not to mention sugar deprived.”
“I’m somehow doubting that was his exact phrasing.”
In the forever-stretch of a second that it takes for Tony to respond, Steve sees alternate universes of how his confession is received, each one progressively pear-shaped and awful. He can’t imagine the wonder that comes over Tony’s face but it’s there. Steve tracks every detail of it. The wordless, soft open of Tony’s mouth and the twisting ticks around it, the wince of his eyes and how it spikes his lashes with tears.
“Aw, you do like me! Counting down with five, four, three, two…”
Planting both hands on Steve’s shoulders, he lifts up and thrusts downward, begins to ride with a rhythm that starts at hastened and rough. And Steve meets his rhythm, fucking up into Tony and repeatedly burying himself in with hard, filthy slaps of sweat-covered skin, grunting with each one.
” Steve prompts, and it sounds like a thank you.
“You think?” Steve pulls Tony’s hands tighter around himself and kisses his fingertips. “Go to sleep.”
“We’ll be his to lose.”
“Are you checking my temperature? You know that’s not actual science, right?” Tony murmurs several beats in, sounding sleepy again.
“I’m sorry, Tony. I— we can’t do this,” Steve says roughly before he’s in his car and gone.
Tony doesn’t hesitate in comforting him. He reaches out and takes Steve’s hand, holds it between his own, slips his fingers underneath the cuff of Steve’s coat and smoothes over the topographic map of his veins.
In hindsight, Tony is grateful because the sleep on Sam’s illustrative pullout affords Tony the energy to make out with Steve in the elevator and all the way up to the penthouse when they’re back in the city.
Fast-forward three years and Tony is still woefully pathetic in the presence of Steve Rogers. However, to his credit, he’s gotten better at hiding it. His gargantuan crush stays wrapped up in the guise of tip-toeingly careful teasing and the same lazy flirtations he uses with everyone because it didn’t take long after meeting Steve to realize that he’s the sort of person you keep in your life. Tony’s stupid feelings aren’t worth the risk of losing the best friend he’s ever made. While Steve’s gorgeous, funny and smart, he’s also impossibly kind and good, so much better than Tony, who’s already bitching about underclassmen almost two months into their senior year.
“Oh no, of course, son,” he says. He also does little to disguise his cackling.
Greedily, he shunts his hips up when Tony pushes inside of him and rolls into the pace that makes Steve’s toes curl and cross. Steve pleads for more, to get it harder, and Tony fucks him just like he asks.
Steve’s hands move from his wrists and Tony mourns the loss until they loop around his middle, drawing him near. Tony abandons boundaries that three years of pining have instilled in him and rolls his fists into Steve’s hoodie, warmth spreading through the knuckles when they bunch and bury in the cushiony cotton.
“Ooh, am I trending?” Dad asks, priorities evidentially in chaos.
“Am I the only one who heard the declaration that you just made? This is not just going to go away. Tony, I have never seen you like this.”
“Yeah,
That shouldn’t be what drives Steve to kiss him, this near careless attitude, but Steve’s made it this far on less than exemplary behavior so he leans in, loiters his fingers in mussed hair, and presses his mouth to Tony’s. He swallows the gasp that Tony gives like another secret and uses it to turn the kiss warm and deep, fully exploring Tony’s velvet tongue and savoring how his mouth feels. When he has to come up for air, hazy-headed and the bite of lust bringing him so close, it’s just barely to the surface. Touching their foreheads and rocking his hips forward, he breathes against Tony’s lips.
“You’re one to talk,” Steve lobs back, low-voiced. He travels the smooth plane of Tony’s inner thigh. “When you come out of the workshop, Tony, you look like—”
“Tony, oh--yes,” Steve manages, jaggedly and in awe. Steve will never be given anything as good as this right here. Heart choked with emotion and body choked with lust, Steve instinctively knows that he won’t last so he painstakingly keeps his hips still and waits for Tony’s lead. And it’s not long until Tony’s squeezing his cock, vice like and with a taffy-pulled hiss, rolling and circling in Steve’s grip as though he’s savoring the sensation.
Tony reads it on repeat until it’s real, until he trusts his fingers enough to unwrap them from his wrist. He types out
“Really?”
“Getting
Later when Steve yanks his hat on, the end flops to the side comically. He laughs and it’s lovely, snowy facial hair and all.
“What’s going on in your head?” Steve asks quietly, fingers in the tiny hairs at Tony’s nape.
“I didn’t know that.”
“Hell no.” Tony croaks a laugh. “That’d be a desecration, and we both know that. Sam refused to let me near the pot anyway. He said he’d spray me down with the bulk of disinfectant you bought. He finished it. I’m a fan of the dumplings.”
That is until the professor walks through the door—broad shoulders stressing out the navy knit of a cardigan and cambridge blue eyes sweeping the room behind thick black frames—and suddenly Tony is here for all of the fucks. He scrambles out of the back row and slinks down closer, already planning to arrive early on Thursday morning and grab a seat front and center because god, Dr. Rogers is gorgeous. And he’s so smart, so versed in verse, that Tony doesn’t stand a chance. Fully engaged, he fixates on a generous mouth that navigates Proust’s ekphrastic lines and Brooks' complex narrative with impressive ease. He can’t lose sight of pale, deft hands that gesture on transitive verbs, an ink-stained thumb edging underneath Tony’s ribcage with an affection that can only be called dangerous.
Stranger than fiction, the light’s fragments shape into a man’s silhouette. He greets Tony with bright relief. “Stark!”
“I love them, Tony. Really,” Steve says, smile warm and earnest. “Thank you.”
Tony requests a private room and manages to negotiate that Rogers be allowed two visitors rather than only one because he and Sam aren’t going anywhere except to grab sandwiches from the cafeteria. At Rogers’ bedside, they stretch their legs out and lean back into their chairs, settling in for the rest of the night.
Steve lays a loitering type of kiss to Tony’s forehead. There’s a fond rolling of his eyes when he draws back because this a conversation he and Tony have had pretty much every day for the past few weeks. He gets out of bed and stretches, the lewd come stained on his stomach and the play of his muscles under flushed skin leaving Tony slack-jawed. With a smirk bent on his mouth, Steve asks, “Shower?”
“Thanks,” Tony murmurs, stunned. “That’s. Yeah, thanks.”
“I don’t want to hurt you,” Steve says like it’s killing him and more important to him, and because of that, Tony answers:
“Steve,” Tony exhales. He travels his hand up Steve’s arm, skims his neck, and touches his face. “That’s sweet of you. I love you for it. You're a good man. However, it’ll be fine. I promise you. He once referred to our relationship as goals.” Steve’s confusion must knit on his face because while moving his foot up the back of Steve’s calf, Tony helpfully tacks on, “It’s basically the biggest seal of approval that you can get from today’s youth.”
Whisper-low, Peter says, “I just don’t want to end up alone.”
Tony can only nod.
At that, Steve sets his stuff aside like he’s excited, absolutely game. It’s open and honest and causes such a wild pick-up in Tony’s heart that it’s a wonder Steve doesn’t hear it when he comes to stand next to Tony.
“So do I. Show me, Tony.”
“Well, yeah, no. Definitely not. Have you seen him try to come up with the titles to movies that came out before 2007? Bands from before he was born? It's really, really sad.”
His beard scratching its hinge, Tony proceeds to press a kiss to the underside of Steve’s jaw, and it’s
Tony holds his eyes straight-on and his words bear the weight of experience. “My interest is that half of the world is on fire and time isn’t something I have much of anymore. My interest is that I’ve wanted you since the moment I first saw you, second chances don’t come around often, and I won’t forgive myself if I don’t do something about it.” He finishes carefully, like it’s vital that Steve understand. “I mean, we don’t have to do anything you don’t want to. That should be clear. I only want what you’re willing to give. Christ, I’d be thrilled just sitting here with you. Honest.”
“I saw a flyer at the farmer’s market the other day,” Steve starts no louder than strictly necessary. “There’s gonna be a jazz concert in Central Park later tonight, thought it might be nice if you’re interested. Been a little while since we’ve had a proper date night. I looked up the band and they’re supposed to be amazing.”
Tony groans, throwing an arm over his face. He uses his other hand to reach down and wrap punishingly tight around his erection, to stave off what will inevitably be combustion. “Dying here, babe.”
“You’ll never fail to mention that, will you?”
“Apparently not because, uh, yeah, ya did ask, junior,” Dad starts, because while Peter is courtroom drama, Dad fluctuates between flicks from the nineties and Michael Schur sitcoms. “Last week, after you got back from that party with Ned, you said ‘Dad, can I get Netflix?’ and I said ‘Sure, kid, give me a few days and—“
Sam Wilson introduces himself to Tony with a cup of coffee held out in offering, and Tony immediately likes him.
Stunned to the spot and cloaked in the darkness, Steve looks on as red and gold radiates under the halo of select ceiling lamps, sleek metal trapped in the cage of Tony’s legs and pressed up against his front. As if it can be greedy--and maybe it can, Steve wouldn’t be entirely surprised--one of the armor’s gauntlets is spread open and grips the parenthesis of Tony’s right hipbone, dimpling the skin there to a desperate red. While Steve can’t see the other, he knows exactly what it’s doing, can hear the slippery noises of sex as the joint of the armor’s elbow jackknifes between strong, taut thighs.
Tony doesn’t deserve Steve but he’ll try. From now on, he’ll try.
And Tony won’t do him the disservice of questioning whether or not he’s sure. With his insides surely upended, Tony turns and nips Steve’s chin, collecting his mouth next. He likes how sweet and chaste this kiss is, soft with the warmth of home. He likes how the tender skip of Tony’s lips coaxes a pleased sound from Steve’s.
“So is this, Tony. All of those new suits you’ve been building in the workshop?”
Steve swooping in and plundering his mouth once more cuts Tony off.
It’s comical, how wide Steve’s eyes get at that slip. He actually says
“Mhmm. Just like.”
it. “How hopeless, am I? I just—I don’t know. He sounded so awful this morning and he’s sick and he’s
Steve entertains the thought that he may be right. There’s a 1A classification sitting on Steve’s bureau in his bedroom, and soon enough, Tony will be in there too. And he’s been so sick in his life, sick of many things, he’d like to no longer be sick of not having sex.
“I hear ya. I do,” Steve voices, tripping his fingers over Tony’s shoulder, seemingly fascinated. “But we could have dinner at that Mediterranean grill that you love, take in some actual live music. Oh and that gelato stand should be up by now. Stracciatella, pistachio, marsala. Which one was your favorite again?”
“It’s good, so good, I swear,” Steve nicks from the bottom-shelf of astounding, marvelous, mind-blowing, limited to single syllables, and panting in patches as Tony tongues the underside of his cock and into the slit at the head.
.” Steve sighs, feeling his face go dopey and lopsided. His pulse thunks hard in his veins. “It felt really good.”
“You’re welcome, Rogers,” Tony finds himself saying, and he thinks the sincerity surprises them both.
“Never thought we’d have that in common.”
“She’d work so hard taking care of everyone else, same as you. At her job and at home. She was non-stop. I always wanted to pay it back in kind, and I wish I could have done more. I don’t know.” He continues with what’s he’s never told anyone. “I guess I hoped that cooking her soup would make her feel as special as she made me feel, show that I loved her just as much. That I cared.”
It’s a ludicrous question because Tony hasn’t been breathing evenly for some time now and there's no way that Steve's ears haven't picked up on that. He turns around, means to try for anything but sounding like an idiot but Steve steals every word from him. He’s looking at Tony like there’s nothing in the world for him but Tony. Eternal seconds click away as Tony soaks the expression in, involuntarily fishmouthing.
, Steve—were assassinated? You don’t think that I deserved to be let in on this information at any point?”
“We could go out,” Tony suggests in a hurry and a little too loud, speaking over whatever the hell is vibrating in his insides and up his spine. “Maybe taking a break wouldn’t be so bad? For a couple of days. And being Tony Stark comes with a spotlight but for every spotlight there’s a VIP room. We could do a restaurant or a bar.”
“Right,” Rhodey says slowly.
“And leaking every classified secret of a super organization is what exactly?” Tony shakes his head. “God, I always knew that Stern was an asshat though. I think I might save the image of his arrest as the background for my phone.” Tony looks her over. “So how are you? Don’t get much opportunity to catch up when you and Rogers are running around getting shot at by ninety-six-year-old assassins with bad eyeliner.”
Laughing, the guy says, “That’d really be something for sure. I don’t think I was in that much danger, though.” He nods to the space next to Tony. “Is that seat saved?”
Well no. It actually starts in a lecture hall holding freshmen orientation when a stranger, long and full of gorgeous angles, almost trips over Tony’s satchel that’s chilling out in the aisle. The knee-jerk
“I want to poke something?”
“If it comes to that, we’ll handle it. I didn't come up with this myself but I admire the man who uttered the words: the safest hands are our own.”
“No way to know for sure, right? He said it. I am in a painful limbo with zero exit signs.” Sighing, Tony rubs at the headache forming at the base of his skull. “But he wouldn’t have said anything if he didn’t trust it was the truth, and god help me but I still trust him. I just—I don’t know where else to to go. I’ve overturned every stone I can think of.”
Tony’s gaze falls over Steve and it’s the marrow in his bones, this knowledge that they’ll be alright in the end because he’s got the best partner in the business. Tony and Steve have had their fights, contentious middles where they diverged and took circuitous routes to only arrive back at the foundation of who they are and be reminded that they’re one and the same. They always will be. Very few things make more sense than Steve at his side.
A small, dripping cube presses where he’s slick and open, and Tony’s forethought, his forearm banded across Steve’s pelvic bones, keeps him from shooting off the bed but not from the roar that breaks out of him.
Steve’s laugh warms damp skin. "In the morning. I meant in the morning. I've told you that you're kind of an asshole, right?"
Regardless, in time, Tony pulls off of his own volition. He rests his forehead against Steve’s temple, breathing heavily in a pattern that echoes the
They’ve only been dating for six months—and before that they’d been on entirely different continents, worlds apart in every way—but the way Tony’s talking, it sounds like he’d do it in a heartbeat. Steve is stunned into monosyllables. “
“Have you never been to a farm before?” Steve asks, crossing his arms over a table tennis club hoodie he got at the activities fair years ago. Tony’s pretty sure Steve’s hasn’t made a single meeting, but the hoodie is oddly cherished. Steve doesn’t go an autumn or a winter without it, not even with the cuffs fraying and its color washed at least two shades softer. Tony’s had many thoughts about this hoodie: imagining how it’d feel against his hands, the sweater paws it’d turn them into if he ever stole it and tugged it over his head, brought the frayed edges to his lips. He thinks on what it’d smell like if he ever got to breathe it in.
It’s an hour flight from New York to DC. Tony can cut that time. He’s done it once or twice before by a few minutes, and that was in older versions of the suit. Rogers just has to keep himself breathing until Tony can reach him, and that thought is a
” Tony’s words skid to an unceremonious stop and take a few tries to get back up. “Excuse me?”
“Are you?” Tony asks. “And that’s not my being a smartass and or trying to be difficult. It’s a question that I honestly can’t figure out the answer to. I’d be both surprised and impressed if you knew.”
Needing something to do with his hands that isn’t loaned from his daytime-slash-late night fantasies, he gets the false shield, asks Steve to throw it out. “JARVIS will stop it and send it back to you, mimicking the response. It’ll only be a fraction of the speed but it should tell you the difference.”
“What’s the matter now?” Dad asks.
“I'll make sure to add that to my CV. Go to sleep, Tony.”
Equally straight-laced, “That’s a pickle. The lack of an invitation could possibly draw even more ire. I wouldn't want to be in your shoes, Mr. Stark.”
After Tony nods, Steves adds another carton to his eco-bag on top of the one for a red, white, and blue fruit tart he’s been wanting to try for dessert and actually made Tony print out the recipe for. Steve grabs a thing of strawberries and Tony isn’t near to hives at the sight of them.
“Um, no, no,” Tony says, shaking his head so much that he’s a little shocked it doesn’t pop right off and roll over to the reference section. “You can. That’d be cool.”
Due to Tony’s lack of faith in governing bodies, Steve’s door is flanked by a pair of Stark Industries’ guards, but they’ve got an approved shortlist and Natasha Romanoff is on it. Tony sidles up to her after stepping out of the elevator the next morning and finding her, still dressed in the outfit she’d worn on Capitol Hill. He joins her in watching Steve’s unconscious form through the window. “He doesn’t bite.”
Taut like a vice, Tony’s cheeks hollow around Steve’s cock and, God, just the sound of
“--and now I’m not. No. I’m not buying it.” Tony shakes his head as if trying to clear it. “Just--no. There’s no way. Steve, I’m telling you. I would have noticed.”
Steve Rogers’ idea of a first date. It’s quaint, with the sweet-smelling air, cobwebbed haystacks, and the riot of harvest colors. It’s so wholesome and charmingly original, so incredibly Steve, that Tony’s insides twist with affection even as rotted pulp squelches under his sneakers.
Steve’s hips pick up pace again, hurried and dogged before they stutter and then still. Steve spills into him with a groan and words too soft for Tony to get completely.
--it’s instantly too much. Steve bites his cry into the flesh of his lower lip and comes before he even knows to warn Tony, greedily chasing with a thrust up and tangling his hand in Tony’s hair because he can’t stand not to.
“I don’t much care.”
Steve shoots him death glares but they’re belied by a blush in his cheeks and he doesn’t argue. Peter throws in Kylo Ren’s TIE fighter as a suggestion but really whatever Steve wants
“You’re incorrigible,” Steve says fondly and not discouraging in the slightest, in fact very much the opposite because honestly, he has to admit, it’s just endearing at this point. He nods to the steering wheel before him. “Am I allowed to know what’s under here?”
“Is there such a thing as a backhanded birthday present? Because this is it, let me tell ya. You truly are an innovator, Tony,” Steve says, unfolds from over the box, and finally opens it, composure evidently regained. He pulls out the two mugs and turns them around for Tony to read: paint water :),
“Oh, you don’t have to,” Steve says softly, still stunned, and Tony hates that because when they’re normal, Steve doesn’t hesitate to heap groceries on him. Tony irrationally resents that these bags aren’t the environment-friendly ones that Steve typically uses, that those are stored idle under the kitchen counter at the tower.
“Sour patch kid much?” Tony sighs. He trashes the projection, eliciting an arcade-chime, before leaning further into Steve. “Ugh, you’re not wrong. I threw this together in like three minutes if that.”
It doesn’t take long for the cube to lose its shape between Tony’s workman fingers, and another takes its place, this time rounding the opposite nipple and slipping down with leisure over the shallow and quick up-down-up-down of Steve’s chest. It bisects Steve’s middle to eventually die in the humid heat of his groin.
“Love you, Cap.” With a soft kiss and warm eyes, Tony says, “Happy anniversary, huh?”
there in response to the hot and wet pressure that circles his hole, teasing with lazy flutters. It escalates to strong and flat laps, Tony laving thoroughly as Steve bucks back in tiny thrusts. Steve’s exposed hole clenches closed and open under the relentless flicks of tongue. And it feels amazing, the hot and wet feel of Tony inside of him, licking and fucking like he wants to carve out territory and mark Steve as his. The hell of it is that Steve so badly wants to be.
“Nana!” Peter shrieks and as if he wasn’t clear, “Nana, nana, nana.”
“Need you, Tony,” Steve begs, and Tony’s whole life feels pieced together at the words. No, he’d keep this instead.
The email arrives three days into fall break and the new alert Tony setup, a fitting chorus by Van Halen, comes through the speakers of his workshop.
Steve’s cock jumps in Tony’s hand at the endearment and despite his reservations about the thin walls, Steve sobs on a high note, letting it out feels as inevitable as letting oxygen in.
With their fingers locked together, Steve leans forward and does just that. The kiss runs mercurial. Tony’s mouth has been cooled by the ice and Steve finds it beneath his tongue, frigid and melting rapidly but the sensation is paired with the familiarity of Tony’s coaxing and insisting rhythm. It’s good and nothing like going under. For one thing, it’s difficult for fear and Tony to occupy the same space. It’s hard for most things and Tony, actually. He’s just so overwhelming and active, and that’s no less true here. Moreover, the ice doesn’t bring pain; it doesn’t burn with bitterness. It doesn’t cling to his lungs and spindle to steal away with his breath. It acts as a comfort from the constant onslaught of heat; it’s resuscitative.
Standing and watching Tony do his work, Steve asks, “You’ve done this before?” It’s not with judgement, but he wonders if it’s just his pedantry imagination for bedroom activity that wouldn’t conclude to this at the first sign of a heatwave.
Tony stops immediately, and Steve then takes even more immediate offense to that.
“What are you going to do, Tony?” Rhodey asks, cautiously cutting into the weighted and serious air.
“Sweetheart,
Tony’s head-tilted laugh is a bright bark, his shoulders shaking. Once he recovers, he takes Steve by the jaw and quickly gives him a smacking kiss, replying, “Damn. You know me too well. I mean, it’s not like anyone would have
“Let me hear it, Steve,” Tony urges after a long stripe. He uses his teeth to bite at the meet of Steve’s ass and thigh. “Tell me it feels good.”
“Oh, that you’re still an idiot,” Tony says with little heat, “but to a lesser degree because I get it. He’s your best friend. I get that. But know this, Steve. I’m not letting you lay on the wire here.”
“I want the real reason,” Tony interrupts, already sick with what’s Steve got lined up. “None of these lies about not wanting to hurt me. I want the truth.”
Timing at a critical point and spidey-sense blaring, Peter heads for the stairs to the sounds of
“Take it from me because I’ve certainly been around long enough to learn. There’s no such thing.”
“Yes, yes,” Steve moans in happy exertion, grinding up and desperate to press himself against every part of Tony, desperate to come. “Please don’t stop. I--I can take it, I swear. I won’t break.”
“You should know that I’ve never done this before, is all,” Steve says, not particularly proud but not embarrassed either. He keeps his chin up, doesn’t flinch away from it. “Any of this. I’ve never had anyone up here, never had anyone touch me the way that you’re touching me. Tony, I don’t know--look, whatever you’re expecting, I can’t see myself being anything but short of it.”
And when she finds it, when peace flashes in her eyes and she clenches tight around him with a broken hitch in her cry, Steve can’t fault her for that either but envy soaks the spine that he sinks into damp bed sheets.
He extends a hand to Tony. “Steve Rogers.”
“Well, he wouldn’t be as good at what he does if there were, right?”
“Understatement. Did someone pull a salt-sugar switcheroo on you?”
“I wanna come for you, baby. Love getting off on you. Gonna come—oh, fuck.”
Tony’s minimally aware of the projections collapsing around them when he hauls Steve in by the neck of his shirt and draw his mouth over Steve’s. He takes full advantage of the hitch of Steve’s breath, tongues the plush bottom lip that has been haunting him; it fits between Tony’s teeth even better than he imagined. Steve kisses him back and that’s something Tony hadn’t even dared to hope for.
Steve groans. “Of course she did. She really does not quit.”
“Yeah,” Steve says, and Tony heaves off him to fish around in the drawer. It leaves Steve cold in a myriad of ways that he doesn’t want to look too hard at. Hearing the lid pop off his small pot of vaseline, he turns this head, cheek resting on the fold of his arms to admire Tony. Steve wants to memorize how the lines of him move as he greases his purpled cock that curves slightly to the left. “That gonna work okay? I use it to oil my baseball mitt.”
An aching and long moment passes between them, and in lieu of scaring Tony shitless, it makes him feel courageous.
” Steve moans, his skin a uniform for his trembling and seemingly meant to burn under Tony’s attention. A finger drags along the crease of his ass, dipping in to stroke over soft skin hidden there before he’s spread open and bared with thumbs.
“Oh, man,” Steve says into the flesh of his palm that he’s raked down his face.
"Are we alright?" Steve asks.
The tang of sex hangs heavy in the room and in between Steve’s thighs is a mess of sweat, lube, and Tony’s spunk, his own stiff cock.
Steve can’t deny Tony this, not after everything. Thanos isn’t the only one who took things away from Tony.
“Chocolate chips are so exciting though.” Tony moves to the fridge, gets out overnight oats, egg whites, and fake breakfast meat. He toes the door shut and starts setting things up on the counter at Steve’s side, preheats the toaster oven. “Not to mention you actually have real bacon.”
“So you have no idea what you're say—”
Christmas is like a flashback and Tony wakes up to a finger whispering across his back.
However, the difficulties don’t dilute the heat dwelling low in Steve’s belly or the upward plea of his hips as Tony’s nimble thighs unfold over him, his welcomed and solid weight coming down in a close curl that faintly smells of spice and metal. He busies himself with the bend of Tony’s shoulder, then the cut of his jaw, kissing and teething the scratchy outline of his goatee and the jumping pulse in his neck while his hands skate up ribs and palm open on Tony’s chest. Sneakily, Steve tweaks a nipple and rolls over it with his thumb, like a plaything, getting it hard. He revels in the shiver the action causes. Steve messes around with the other nipple and scrapes it with a blunt nail just the way that Tony loves. He gives attention to the sensitive ridge that surrounds the reactor, tracing it with light fingers which causes Tony to buck forward.
He can’t imagine putting someone through that for a third time.
The stranger—
“I’m sorry,” Steve tells him. He’d switch places with Tony in a heartbeat if he could. “Um, I got you some medicine that should make you feel better and take care of that, though.” Steve pulls out the package of caplets the pharmacist had recommended, a thermometer, and a bag of herbal throat drops. He shoves aside the scrunched-up wads of what he thinks is toilet paper on the nightstand with a new tissue box.
“You’re going to come for me.” A bite grazes his shoulder and sends a spike through him, vibrates every nerve ending that he has. Humid and fevered, Tony says, “You’re almost there, baby. You can do it. Let yourself go. Come for me. Now, baby, just come.”
“I am working,” Tony says even as he feels himself fighting the weight of his eyelids. Absently, he thinks to ask. “So whatever happened with the archivist?”
Tony swallows and then straightens. “I didn’t say that...exactly.” He shrugs a shoulder. “I just don’t think any creator can afford to be old-fashioned and rest their laurels on tried and true. Especially when their contemporaries are continually changing the game. It’s a guaranteed way to get left behind.”
“Sorry, sorry,” Tony murmurs absently, laughing with an amused Steve before cajoling hot kisses from him. He recedes down under Steve’s jaw and sweeps his throat with a procession of near-kisses, brushing and licking over his nipples. Tugging at them with his teeth, Tony is rewarded with Steve’s bright and hooked cry.
“Good morning indeed,” Steve says, sounding as content as Tony feels.
“Yeah, I am,” Steve tells him.
“Okay. Here’s another tip and then I’m gonna start charging. The first rule, and most important by the way, is to try not making a noose out of the tie. Jesus, you could put a tomato of out business right now,” Tony says, loosening the knot and re-doing it like a dance that he’ll never forget the steps for. Letting go is harder than it should be. “There. That’s better. You’re perfect. You're also the most earnest person I know. Stick with that and you can't lose.”
Dryly, "I am very concerned about being in good standing with dead poets. Guess I can’t have him at my next seance then.”
It feels like making up for wasted time and fate course-correcting them to a path they should have been on from the very beginning.
“When I first met Sam and he caught me up on everything that happened to you here, I didn’t envy you at all. Having to choose between your best friend and saving millions of lives. I mean, I knew what you’d do. It’d be hard for you but the choice was obvious. Because you’re you and if you actually had a cape, the cape would never come off. You’d wear the cape in the fucking shower. Which is one of the many things that I love about you.”
He and Tony go until the ice is completely gone, and, at the end, Steve catches himself greedily chasing after it.
“Is this seat taken?”
“Right. So JARVIS has been keeping an eye on everything SHIELD since it went belly-up. There wasn’t much to write home about at first, fringe players, mostly, that local law enforcement had a handle on, but now, dangerous weapons are starting to pop-up in regions that definitely shouldn’t have access to the grade of technology that they do, which means that trinkets the Chitauri left behind are being sold to major hitters.”
He concedes to a nod though and is gathered in a kiss that falls into place effortlessly, makes Tony think of comforting chaos.
To his left, Tony confers with Rhodey on the ethics of using the armor. Tony thinks it should be permissible. Rhodey is willing to concur on one condition: that he also gets to use War Machine.
“Such a fucking minx,” Tony laughs, husky-curled when Steve hooks a heel to his calf, grinding up lazy and smearing what’s left on his stomach with Tony’s precome. He tag-teams it with a lick just beneath Tony’s ear, his lips closing around the lobe and holding it hostage for a lengthy moment between his incisors. For it, Tony grips Steve’s thigh with fingers like brands and rocks against Steve in a way that is remarkably blatant, making a point to wring a noise with little dignity out of him, tally up several of them. Testing the elasticity of Steve’s edges, Tony teases Steve’s nipple, pulling and pinching just so. He cranes his neck to work it over with a broad and hot sweep of tongue before he sets out on a purpling hickey that Steve’s going to have to cover up with concealer before leaving this room again.
And Tony wouldn’t have said anything had he known it’d make Steve look like
“Thin line between love and hate? I don’t know,” Tony says, groaning. He tries to marshal his thoughts and string together something coherent. “There’s the whole thing about not meeting your heroes, how they never measure up, but Steve pretty much broke the ruler and I didn’t take that well—that all of the stories Howard told me were actually true. That Steve was worth being canonized. That I looked at him there, in real life, and couldn’t fault my dad for going on about him for hours on end. I think that’s what I resented,” Tony recognizes just as it’s uttered. “It was never him.”
Steve presses his body flush to Tony’s, and, after a short introduction of hip to hip and chest to chest, he actually sweeps Tony off of his feet, walks them over to the workbench. He notches his thigh in the vee of Tony’s legs, and Tony grinds into it with enthusiasm, chases after it like it’s his first touch of someone else. With an appreciative moan, he pushes himself into Steve’s hands that grip at his middle and then rove up his sides. “Fuck yes,” Tony breathes.
“Nope. And speaking of...mail call.” Tony gets up and retrieves an old, browned folder from a nearby bench. He hands it to Steve, hates that he has to. Hates the sour shadow that falls over Steve’s face; like clockwork it sets with any news or—as has been trending—lack thereof. “Came in today. Origins, Kiev.”
In the space of the room, Tony’s shudders and grunts climb, his eyes screwed shut and mouth open. He flexes under the armor, and his limbs coil around it, a strange alchemy of skin and titanium alloy, malleable and mechanical in turns. It doesn’t fit quite right and agonizes Steve with envy as much as lust. The polished back of the armor doesn’t give under the angry drag of Tony’s fingers or the insistent press of his foot’s heel. Steve imagines the how he’d howl under the attention coupled with the unimaginable hot and slick clench of Tony’s body before attacking with sharp teeth. The armor can’t bruise the sweat-smooth slope of his neck and shoulder with a mobile mouth, can’t take and give like Steve would.
“Wait. Hold on. Since the sixties? Is the name a designation then?”
Tony nods, covers his hand in the gauntlet once more. He keeps the faceplate flipped up so Rogers can hear his voice, and, for his own peace of mind, he orders JARVIS to de-weaponize the suit, although he’s sure it’s already been done. “Is it safe to move him?”
“What makes you say that?”
The words hurl Steve into the business end of a fever, and his hands flex around Tony’s hips with regency era longing, his lungs clenching too as his chest heaves in anticipation. And from all appearances, Tony is barely doing any better. He works himself open in quick and deteriorating form, impatient when he closes a lubed hand around the steady throb of Steve’s cock. He strokes it a few times before lifting himself straight up and sinking down, hot and slick, with his head tossed back. He doesn’t stop until he’s fully seated and Steve’s cock is buried in him, his ass sweetly nudged against Steve’s balls.
“Yes,” Rogers says, smile fuller in his win. “So will you shut up and just let me say thank you?”
So Tony doesn’t. After adding another finger, Tony stretches him with twisted angles and tiny little punches. He’s caught between watching his knuckles disappear into the clenching tight of Steve and watching the pleasure pretty up Steve’s face, who’s wanton and shameless. If time could actually stand still, Tony thinks he’d keep this part forever, tuck it away where it can’t wither.
“And potentially get yourself fired for what exactly? This isn’t illegal and I’m not even going to be your student come January!” He throws up his hands, stops short of pulling on his hair. “Does your affinity for self-sacrifice switch off?”
“Sure about that? You gonna look down and check? Feeling lucky, Stark?”
“It’ll go away.”
“We signed up for this gala together, Tony.”
“Oh, fuck me. Fu--” Tony says this and other half-formed things that are the barest of sounds, jerking into Steve’s fist as violently as he thrusts downward. He slams down twice more and spurts messily, a glob even catching Steve’s collarbone. He shudders over Steve in a quake before collapsing and slicking his come between them. His mouth seemingly dapples whatever skin he can reach.
Placing kisses that swirl all over Steve’s cock and nuzzling Steve’s sac, Tony asks, “Is it alright if I touch you here?”
Tony snorts. “Yes, you would. I am not buying what you’re selling, old man.”
Even from watching Tony’s back, Steve can spot how his typically sharp and busy motions are sluggish. Steve has seen Tony make coffee plenty, more times than is sane most days—the coffee-making, not Steve watching—and not once has Tony ever almost dropped a mug when getting it out of the cupboard or needed to take several pokes at the coffee maker to get it brewing.
The newspaper stand had been right outside of the café but the building where the bomb had detonated two blocks away. And with a headstart--it’d taken Tony too long to realize what had happened--Steve was already inside, saving lives with no thought for his own.
Steve sends him a look that says that he thinks Tony is sort of ridiculous but he zips at his mouth that’s biting back a grin.
“I want to,” Tony says and cleaves a few to himself.
his kid and you always will be. This hasn’t been easy for anyone but this isn’t something that he ever wanted for you or would have wished for you. And that’s because he loves you.” Tony recognizes the scrape of an island stool on the hard floor. “Hey, hey. Peter, we are incredibly proud of you for wanting to help others and that your instinct when you got these powers was to protect people. We love how good you are. We’re so proud of the person you’re becoming. That’s something we never want you to doubt. We respect you and what this means to you. It’s just not gonna happen overnight. We could use some understanding, too.”
“Let’s table
“As of fourteen minutes ago, SHIELD helicarriers were activated to launch.”
“Create tech to keep the shield within a mathematically determined radius of your person.”
A reckless impulse runs through him and Steve pulls away again, but this time he’s the one to steal a kiss, the one to take initiative. He goes in with his eyes open, only closing them when Tony’s lips give underneath his and and part with a soft exhale that Steve swallows gladly. He delights in how hot the kiss becomes, Tony’s so warm, and Steve is in a hurry for all of him. Feeling himself grow hard in his thin, tweed trousers, he moves his hands down Tony’s shoulders and bunches the lapels of his jacket, tows him across the living room and into the bedroom.
,” Dad says, rolling his eyes and tilting his hand this way and that because
it though. Not if I installed a transitional windshield or if I was your only passenger.”
In a smooth sweep, Aretha Franklin and her background trio start the layered intro of
Swallowing around anticipation that threatens to choke him, Steve does as asked. Blood-hot, slick with vaseline and precome, Tony rocks into the cleft of Steve’s thighs, just under his balls and passing against his cock. Hips rolling in a deep grind, he fucks in and draws out slowly.
“Whoa. Invasion of the body snatchers. Are you serious?”
“Chances are probably good but I’m willing to take that bullet if need be,” Steve says with a soft laugh. He takes steps in Tony’s direction, curling an arm around him and pulling the projection of Peter’s suit closer. He narrows his eyes at it and zooms-in on the lower half. “Huh. Horrifying may have been an understatement, Shellhead.”
“Yeah, okay, I guess that makes sense,” Peter says with grudging acceptance. “I just want to be like you guys and it sucks seeing you both out there doing amazing things while I’m still using training wheels. I kind of feel like I’m going crazy. I want to do more and waiting is literally the worst.”
“I can get it. Just don’t start rubbing off, peaches,” Tony warns, dallying a touch along the slash of Steve’s hipbone, hinting lower. “Is it in the nightstand?”
“Super soldier serum,” Sam says simply again, and Tony is beginning to get that’s just the way he is, straight to the point and direct. “Stark, Bucky Barnes is the Winter Soldier.”
“Don’t forget bendy. She was very bendy.” Tony slants forward in his chair and rests his chin on his fist. “Seriously, gumdrop, how are you? How’s Kuwait?”
“Get to bed on time and maybe before I leave tomorrow, I’ll really show you what’s not kid-friendly.”
“Fuck,” Steve says, shuddering in response, and coming warm and wet over Tony’s fingers. Distantly, he feels it spatter on his chest and paint the tops of his thighs.
. “Meaning I’m actually surprised they let me book a room here and don’t have me blacklisted considering last I was here—and let’s take into account that I was like seventeen, if that—I drove an Audi straight into the swimming pool. Stuff of legend.”
, it says.
“Yeah?”
“I’m almost positive you’re lying about the x-ray vision. C’mon, Spangles. No cake, no strippers, no fireworks?” Tony bellyaches, closing the map on his phone with directions to the nearest chain store. At least, he’d been willing to search for legal TNT. “No fun. What kind of birthday is this? It’s downright un-American.”
Honestly by the time midterms roll around there’s only one option left.
So Tony puts the condoms back and just makes with the lube. On his haunches between Steve’s legs, Tony dribbles it over his fingers until they’re slick. Once satisfied, he carefully presses one digit inside Steve who groans in return, his hand clamping down on Tony’s forearm when the finger goes crooked.
, in and out of his bedroom in a suit of red and blue. Tony remembers getting sick into a wastebasket at the image of Peter weaving homemade stitches into his thigh.
“My job is to lead and look out for the best interests of our team. Sending you out in your condition, would be in direct violation of that objective. More importantly, you’re my friend and I want you to get better,” Steve says. He gives Tony a once-over. “Also, I’m trying to spare you the embarrassment of walking out the door because you missed three buttons and only two of those are on your shirt.”
“Then tell me,” Tony encourages because the more he listens, the more he wants Steve to be free, whatever it takes. “Tell me, please.”
“I saw you on the news earlier. Not too shabby, you facing off against Congress,” Tony says after a moment, nudges her with his shoulder.
“I was terrified that one day you’d be blindsided with it and find out from someone who doesn’t love you. Who wouldn’t be kind or take care with how they told you. I didn’t think you deserved that,” Steve tells him. “Or you could have discovered it on your own and the thought of you being alone and reading that in black and white. That scared me. You deserve better than that. I was afraid of you finding out and hurting and me not being there to fix it. Not being there to take care of you. I’m still terrified of that. The thought of you in pain—”
Steve is better about it, able to slip on the brave face after a nightmare he and Tony may as well be dream-sharing. He lets logic win out over his fear. Tony has a harder time disguising his worry and is taking the slow road to acceptance but his stomach no longer plunges when Peter falls dozens of feet before shooting off a web and pride blooms in him when Peter outsmarts a simulation—Tony's medical readouts are improving. And yes, Peter’s still anxious and stubborn but maybe the Steve-sounding voice in his head is right and some of that can be chalked up to hormones. That maybe Tony shouldn’t take it so personally because Peter is joking and smiling again and has more good days than bad.
Sex-scratched and lovely, Steve rasps, “Tony, I’m. Oh, for
Steve runs his hands over the exterior’s glossy finish, brushed with an uninterrupted gleam and the trim immaculate because when Tony Stark puts his brilliant mind toward something, it doesn’t turn out anything less than absolutely perfect. And there’s no doubt about it, this car is perfect. The Camaro’s an Americana beauty that’s been retrofitted with care and skill by someone with impeccable style and timeless taste. Tales of meticulous work are expressed in every customized detail and the artist in Steve appreciates the craftsmanship of sleek dimensions and accented lines, how the frame flares at the ends. He knows a masterpiece when he sees it.
. Grabbing the hem of Steve’s sweater, he has it in mind to reward himself, has it halfway up when Steve stops him with a gentle hand.
“What the hell is going on? JARVIS, give me the A/V feed,” Tony says, because he isn’t the trusting sort and his tech hasn’t gone unchecked in six years.
“That’s spy tip number two. No more freebies,” she says. She presses a kiss to his cheek, squeezing his shoulder, and juts her chin toward Rogers. “Hey, take care of him for me, will you? He won’t do it himself, and I trust you to keep him safe.”
“...gotta remember that as much as it’s about you being prepared, it’s also about your dad getting used to this,” Steve is in the middle of saying. “It’s asking a lot of him. Give him time, Peter, and he’ll come around.”
For a soft beat, they simply look at each other, gazes fixed.
“That’s not what this is. Not only anyway,” Steve says, leaning in while his hands drop to Tony’s hips in a solid grip. His voice drops with wonder. “I didn’t count on you happening.”
“Oh.” Left dizzy by the words, Steve allows himself the romantic gesture of placing his hand on the raised scar tissue covering Tony’s sternum. Gently, he passes the pad of his thumb over it. As an afterthought, he bites Tony’s chin lightly to level out the sweetness. “Is that bad then?”
“What’s wrong?” Tony asks.
“It was the only outcome. Tried to work around it but—” His clears his throat because it suddenly feels like a funnel filled with kerosene, her words burning all the way up to the back of his eyes. “It wasn’t fair to keep putting her through all of that grief and worry, hoist all of my shit on her.”
He unwinds the copper around his other hand and types—fine, he stabs—out a reply in the
Strangely though, Tony is hesitant. His mouth forms words that need a few tries to take, and Steve doesn’t even need both of his hands to count how often that happens. Finally, Tony says, “Um, okay. Yeah. And it’s fine—you can say no if you change your mind. Feel free to push it right off the table. Like I said, it’s just a thought.”
Unrelenting, Tony sucks hard around the hot, thick length, gag reflex long forgotten as he inches down further. He makes encouraging noises around Steve’s cock, and when Steve comes, Tony greedily devours everything.
“Well, I am not looking forward to wiping that down,” Tony says, with a cringe but too easy for having just come in front of Steve. “Might be time to consider a self-cleaning capacity.”
“Then why? I don’t get it,” Peter says. He sounds so young.
Christmas Eve is the communal floor festooned with everything from garland and tinsel to baubles. To Tony's abject horror, there are elves on shelves. Carols play in the elevator and somehow every room smells like spice or pine cones without a single candle in sight. There are actual stockings on the mantle and someone has been stringing pipe cleaners with tiny bells and wrapping them around doorknobs. Every time Tony clips one off, another appears. It’s worse than the glitter that’s going to to have to be professionally vacuumed out of the carpets.
Steve blinks at him. “...Are you serious?”
shootings—from YouTube. The next day had been awful. He and Steve had intended to be calm and collected but running on fumes and fear the situation rapidly devolved into anything but.
It’s akin to keeping a house of cards steady, guarding his secrets with his pulse quickening wildly and ready to leap out of his skin, but Steve tries. “Tony, it’s fine. I want you to get better, and I’m able to do these things for you. I’m happy to do it. You said it yourself that you’re miserable. I remember being sick; it's impossible to forget. I remember how much better I felt having someone who—having someone there for me.”
Rhodey stares at him, distinctly unhappy with his answer. “Are you kidding? You live with him. You can’t do that to yourself.”
“I’ll do my best to remember that.”
Steve tries to mimic Tony’s jabs across his prostate, and he couldn’t be anymore empty. Feet planted on the mattress and mean with misery, he tugs on his sac and shoves into the scrape of his dry palm. He tries flicking his thumbnail at the crown like Tony would do, and it only stings bright for a depressingly short moment. His lower back is sore after a half-hour in a raised bridge that’s going nowhere fast. His lungs burn with futile exertion and are heave-choked as tears creep into his metallic-stained mouth.
“Only all too well. I perfected the skill of navigating to the nursery as a freaking zombie. Had to save your life when you fell asleep in the shower.” Tony sways with their little fifteen-month old night owl.
“Tony, the point is that you’re my student and it should have never happened. It was a breach of trust and a failure of my being your educator.”
“Oh my god,” Peter says and spazzes the screwdriver right back out.
“I’ve got you,” Tony promises, loitering at the inside of his thigh with sucking kisses. He steadies Steve’s cock, a touch Steve’s missed so sorely after only knowing a short while, and licks a wet strip from base to head before taking Steve deep in his throat with one smooth move.
“Okay.”
and Tony gently rocks with Peter once more, softly singing to him and stroking his back. It gets Peter to quiet down to a hush of small and percussive noises, his hand a patting starfish on the material of Tony’s shirt. The kid’s got good taste, a big fan of seventies soul. By the fourth song in, the patting stops and Tony peers down to find fluttering eyelashes and Peter breathing softly through his small mouth. With a nonverbal signal to JARVIS, the music fades out, and Tony quietly hikes the stairs outside the workshop. He’s just reached the landing and is heading for the elevator when Peter stirs again.
“No fireworks,” Steve says, turning a ripe peach this way and that because his idea of a birthday morning well spent is a visit to the farmer’s market.
Tony nods, releasing a gust of air. “Okay. Peachy keen. That’s great. I’m trying to be patient but I’m also trying not to wait you out. If you want to say no, I don’t want to wait for it to become a yes because that doesn’t help anybody. It’s been a hard balancing act, let me tell you. It’s just—Steve, you can say no. You don’t have to keep dropping hints for a way out. You can just say it. We don’t have to get married, Peter doesn’t technically need two legal guardians. You don’t have to be his—his anything.”
The cajoling efforts and Tony’s voice at Steve’s ear, soft and soothing with affection too warm and real to be mere sweet nothings, lend to a pleasant daze for Steve to float through. Tony noses along Steve’s hairline with a feline laziness, and it’s almost enough to distract from Tony’s hand that’s ventured to the join between Steve’s thighs, slipped through the patch of hair there.
“I didn’t draw you from the water, but I found you. JARVIS did the actual calculations, so he should get the majority of the credit,” Tony adds as an afterthought.
Worn and hard, and with no plans to return, he tells her that he’ll think about it.
Handsome laugh lines crease the edges of Tony’s amused gaze. He balances on his elbow, and Steve is being pondered in the dim light—the curtains long since drawn over the windows to block out the sun. With a cluck of his tongue, Tony asks, “Did you intend to both frame that in the form of a question and drench it in pessimistic doubt?”
And that’s a tell-tale of time. It was near the end June that they first fell into this thing that has no name. The last two left upright after a loose camaraderie among teammates at the facility, the moment had been brewed with Tony’s whiskey and mead that had accompanied Thor on his visit from Asgard and promptly found itself in Steve’s possession. It’d been fashioned with hands and eager mouths that only left each other long enough to offer propositions that were thick with intent and came in boozy-stereo.
“It’s safe,” Tony starts, hoping Steve’s face won’t dim when he follows with, “in New York. At the tower.”
Tony looks around their kitchen and is grateful for the house he and Steve had bought together last year. Once Peter was out of school, it’d been Steve’s idea for the three of them to get away to their home outside of the city and mend what was their family fracturing. The silent treatment from Peter’s end awkwardly shifted into stilted conversation and then rules were set out. Tony’d upgraded Peter’s suit—repeatedly checked over every inch of it until it was burned in his memory—and after another sleepless night, he and Steve decided to let Peter train at the compound a few days out of the week.
Licensing his hands to the length of Tony’s thighs, they run up and back and up again. Steve rhapsodizes, “You’re so--oh God, Tony. So damn beautiful. Best thing I’ve ever seen.”
?” His glance up, under the length of his fair-colored lashes, is a see-through search that Tony can’t help fidgeting under.
“We’re gonna make this right.”
“If? That’s awfully optimistic. This is a really,
“I thought you’d gone back to the mansion.”
"Of course. Sure." Steve studies him. Peter looks tired, dressed in sweats and hair dampened with what Steve guesses in sweat. Alongside Tony's workshop, the gym has also been a favorite of Peter's since moving in. “Are you alright?”
“One question, Stark,” Steve starts, once he’s gathered his wits. He swipes his tongue across his bottom lip because Tony’s focus has always started at Steve’s mouth. The hard swallow he gets in return is incredibly rewarding. “How’s the suspension?”
“You,” Peter accuses with venom.
out. “You’ve barely spoken me since that gala and I don’t know what I’ve done to offend you.”
It starts on an unremarkable Friday afternoon at a small table in the back of the campus library.
“What’d you get?” Tony asks, rocking on his feet and nodding at the bag in Steve’s grasp. He pushes his glasses up a bit.
It’s quantifiable and not, because half the time Tony can’t even articulate it to himself, especially when he’s only half of it and more than likely Steve doesn’t feel the same way, but even given that, it still feels irrevocably right.
Tony’s ears perk up outside of the kitchen when he comes down, the conversation between Steve and Peter stopping him short.
“That is a horrible excuse and Dad is a terrible influence on you,” Peter says. He picks his fork up and spins its handle between his fingers. Lifting a brow and at a length, he asks, “So is this happening then?”
Central air is a miracle, and Steve can’t wait to get back home, where everything reliably runs on reactor technology, and to walk barefooted on the cool floors of the tower. He and Tony did have plans to tour the city, check out Navy Pier and the Chicago Art Institute--because Steve’s never been and he’s finally got cleared time in his schedule--but those plans have been patently thwarted. He has to get through this hour, Tony’s trade expo tomorrow, and then they’ll be on a flight to New York where global warming is definitely still a thing but not so bad that he could fry an egg over-medium on asphalt. Well, he doesn’t think so, at least. He hasn’t ever
“How else am I supposed to keep track of your age? Ninety-six candles is a fire hazard and you won’t let me spank you.” Tony winks and sips iced coffee from a travel mug that Steve either bought since moving in or Tony stuffed into a cupboard and forgot. It’s splashed with the molecular formula for caffeine and Tony
Steve isn’t too proud to utilize the assistance of the staff, but he does feel a little ridiculous when he walks up to the counter and the startled gaze of the pharmacist, and proceeds to shake about two dozen different brands out of his basket. It causes a gatorade to roll right off the edge of the counter and land square on his foot.
“But I don’t know what the appropriate wait time is before asking him out, you know?”
Peter nods, visibly good with that answer. Happy. “I mean, it’s seriously about time.”
“So sweet, Steve,” he moans, arching.
and an impatient tug that brings him down flat.
him and Steve so affirming, huge, and unrelenting
The first assignment Tony gets back post-kiss has an A inked in scarlet at the top corner—not unusual but Tony can’t help noting the irony. Steve’s additions don’t get any more interesting past that, however. The notes that he bothered to make on the next eight pages are so customary and flat, Tony is half-surprised there isn’t a smiling kindergarten sticker emblazoned with ‘great job’ at the end.
, before the freshman, who’s only taking an engineering class to impress the girl he has a crush on by the way, is propping his hip against their table. Which yeah fine, Tony can kind of relate to wanting to impress the person you lo—like but still, the more Lang barrages him with questions, the longer Tony goes without knowing what Steve was about to ask and god, Tony really needs to know what Steve was about to ask.
“Oh, I—,” Steve says uselessly and with no clue how to finish. He clears his throat and sits up against the headboard, his stomach and nerves jumping. Steve can’t distinguish the origins of the tension, whether it’s from anticipation or anxiety, the two so near and almost inextricably similar.
“Don’t stop,” Steve growls and grinds. “We’re good. It just feels so, with
Face half-mashed in a pillow, Tony wakes up to a finger tracing patterns down his back. His brain still sluggish with sleep, he lazily follows the invisible line Steve draws on him, how it goes lateral, slants upward, and then straightens to the left. Curiously, the shape grows a tail.
“I’m excellent. Kuwait is sweltering. Sand is dry and water is wet, Tony. What are you doing calling me at, let’s see, it’s fourteen-hundred hours here and that’s seven in the morning your time. And you’re too well-dressed to be going to bed,” Rhodey notes after a brief appraisal. “What’s wrong?”
“Saving my life doesn’t constitute a
“Thank you,” Rogers says. With a slight chuckle that rumbles into an amused laugh—and maybe some of the painkillers are still lingering, it’s so unrestrained—he says again, “Thank you.”
“If so, I have definitely have the world record on the longest concussion, by far. Probably pretty dangerous. What do I have to say to convince you, huh?” Steve’s forehead falls to Tony’s softly with a sigh. He nuzzles with his nose, impossibly close and devastating; his eyes are thoughtful and yank Tony to a tenuous edge of something more. “Or is it something that I can’t
“Oh, you’re so cute,” Cap says, like Peter’s two again, diaper thrown to the wind and getting handpaint prints all over himself and DUM-E’s charging station. Yes, the picture exists and still makes rounds at family holidays.
“God, yes, so much,” Steve admits, trembling and nodding. He can’t bother to care what sort of man that makes him. Just, “Please say it again.”
“Hey, J, you mind dropping the needle on Peter’s playlist?”
Cutting a glance to him, Tony expands with, “I’m obviously referring to post-you. I did say anticipate.”
“I can’t just call you?”
“What you did up there, I have half a mind to call you an absolute idiot,” Tony tells him after tallying a number of beats that add up to an appropriate passage of time.
Tony looks at him intently, and he apparently finds something that has him nodding. He jerks a thumb over his shoulder toward the bathroom. “Towels first? Otherwise we’ve got a whole sheets-to-rags situation, and, don’t get me wrong, that can be hot, but it’s mostly just uncomfortable by the end of everything.”
And all at once, he’s in Steve’s arms. Their heads press together, and Tony thinks that Steve is always going to devastate him in some way. The affection that’s startling in his eyes and happiness that’s sweet on his generous mouth, how his lashes flicker against the bridge of Tony’s nose. Steve’s broad hands cup and hold Tony’s jaw, keep him still like he’s sketched up plans for how this is supposed to go.
“Bucky Barnes,” Sam discloses quietly, putting care into the name like it’s a secret. “You ever heard of the Winter Soldier?”
“Just like that,” Tony gasps out. All at once, his navel pulls in, tremors run along his thighs, and his back bows, his upper half heaving forward. He clutches at Steve with biting nails, cutting soon-to-be welt paths down his arms. Steve hisses and distractedly Tony slurs, “I’m sorry. Sorry. My bad. Just don’t stop.”
Close-up, Tony glows with sweat. And Steve is constantly taken with how beautiful he is, how he fills space with his charm and smile. It almost feels claustrophobic, the knowledge of how completely out of Steve’s league Tony is. As though, he knows that Steve is going nowhere good, Tony nudges Steve’s forehead with his own, eyes soft. Their heads ducked together, Tony’s voice drops in, “You’re horrible for my ego. How offensive would it be for me to tell you I want to carry you around in my pocket?”
“Tony,” Steve lets out like he’s equal parts awed and wrecked.
Tony goes from a no to a maybe.
Steve laughs again. “Just did.”
“That was almost twenty years ago.”
Briefly, Tony contemplates running away, but that’d be ridiculous because they drove over together in Tony’s car—ditching Captain America at the farmer’s market would probably get him skewered—and Steve isn’t, well, Steve can’t be serious.
Steve doesn’t entirely buy Tony’s fish story: that he’s got a Cousin Vinny on the frontlines who used to work with Bucky at the Navy Yard a few years back and that all three of them had a night out drinking hot buttered rum the winter Steve was conveniently laid up with bronchitis. Steve doesn’t buy that Tony had his wallet picked because Steve caught the glint of a nice, heavy watch in Tony’s jacket pocket when he slid into the booth across from him. Tony had even almost palmed it before seemingly remembering himself and checking the clock above the bar instead.
“My intention is not to dismiss the integrity of Agent Carter’s character but from what I’ve gathered, should we not entertain the possibility that she may have had suspicions regarding the circumstances of the accident?”
However, extraordinary doesn’t mean perfect, and Tony appreciates that. Relatable isn’t the word that Tony wants to use, it’s so banal, but that’s what it is. Tony couldn’t possibly rival Steve’s goodness but the rest of it? They’re pretty evenly matched. Stubborn, contentious, and unabashed. For all that Tony’s kind of an asshole, Steve is kind of a punk. Tony would bet a tidy sum that very few are privy to this information. History didn’t pass down Steve’s dry humor that will toe the edge of what is typically regarded as off-limits and then stomp all over it in deadpan. Albeit, mostly at his own expense but with every intent to throw the other person off. Cool as you like, Steve had lamented over the popular impression that he can’t take a good ribbing, he’s got Trojan receipts, a dick joke that Tony nearly choked on.
“Um, yes, sleep. Sleep is awesome and we love it and Daddy is so tired. We’re putting you to sleep. How about some warm milk? You like that. Let’s try that. Or a banana? Natural source of melatonin, good sleepy carbs. Bananas?”
“Tony, you can’t,” Steve impresses, sounding strangled and tight. Tony peers up to see Steve’s nails are biting into Tony’s sheets, churning them with white-knuckled clutches.
“That might be true,” she says agreeably. “But no less fair that it would have been for you to give up a part of yourself.” Kindly, she nudges him back. “How did you put it at your congressional hearing? The suit and you are one, to turn over the suit would be to turn over part of yourself?” Whatever she sees in his expression makes her respond with a shrug, sets a friendly gleam in her eyes. “I may have rewatched it on YouTube.”
“—your own self-preservation. Jesus,
The sun is sinking in a gorgeous purple-pink persuasion and the lights that garland through the big backyard are just flickering on when the strings start up again.
Steve is cut off by a particularly nasty hacking fit that’s pitched in Tony’s suit-jacketed elbow, the sound transportive, worryingly familiar, and squeezing a painful fist in Steve’s chest.
Steve looks at him cautiously. “Are you done? Because I don’t want to ruin your juju that you’re so protective of.”
Lang mugs a face of apology at Tony. “Sorry, man, I didn’t know that you were getting asked out.”
Steve’s eyes follow him, a frown bent on his mouth. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Yes—however, not that. Or whatever your imagination conjured up outside of that. With the last few leads on Barnes turning up cold and having not come up with anything in weeks, I was thinking. Steve, we won’t stop looking. We
“Wait a second.” Steve comes in, pouting but keeping his arm looped around Tony’s back. He’s got that slur that yields to his accent, rough and percussive. Combined with the navy shirt and spice of his cologne, it’s criminal. “Are you rooting against me?”
“Just working on a way to make sure you don’t lose it again,” Tony says when Steve asks. “I should probably have you whip the real one around soon, get the practical distance of your average throw, outside ranges, etcetera.”
“Well it never really died, Steve. That’s the point. It’s always been underground and waiting to weed up. It needs to be yanked out by the roots this time around. What I’m saying is that we take care of it, once and for all. Get the band back together and get this done. Find their outposts, find their bases. I know how important Bucky is to you—”
Steve’s eyes are heavy-lidded when Tony speaks again, forcing him to fully lever them back open. “There was a thought I had on the way up back here, a way to cool off, if you’re interested, but—”
For that, Steve smiles up at him before softly curling his tongue under the leaking head of Tony’s cock. His mouth is wide and wonderful when he swallows Tony into unbelievable heat, sucking with the sort of eagerness and drive that’s ridiculous and so, so good.
“Are you alright?” Steve asks from where’s he propped against the counter with a mug in hand.
“You’re in every frame of my future. Love, Tony,” Steve reads and it’s strange to hear the words Tony had pored over for hours said so quickly.
movies, please, and make an order to Carmine’s because my teeth are gonna rot at this rate.”
“Never been better,” he says hoarsely, raps his heel at Steve’s calf and lifts into the hardness against him. “C’mon, c’mon, come on. Need you in me yesterday.”
And because everyone else is in various states of inebriation, they go with it.
He pulls away on a sigh and searches Tony’s face, still waiting for it to blur into the shapeless mirage of a dream. Steve doesn’t know if he fears that more or the possibility of Tony socking him in the jaw, finally letting him in on a cruel joke. “This isn’t just because I’m letting you stay at my place, is it? Some sort of thank you?”
Rogers—
For a stretch, their mouths weave a keep-away and hide and seek sequence, aiming to exhaust a multitude of kisses with messy handfuls of hair and tender touches, with elegance and without. They exchange ice—shrunken, bitten, almost liquid, compact, and malleable—between used lips that quicksilver from cold to hot and back again.
—precious, treasured is that we can lose them. Makes perfect sense to me.”
Christmas Eve is Tony willingly risking food poisoning because Steve landed on dessert when he spun the holiday assignment wheel and no one had the good sense to demand a re-spin.
“Exactly. So what is going on?”
Steve is gorgeous panting hot clouds on the mirror of Tony’s bathroom with his hands splayed on the backsplash and his cock fat and heavy between his legs. He’s a dream when face-fucking Tony into the workshop’s couch, once doing it so well he’d broken the armrest. They can’t stop laughing about it because on top of everything, they’re friends.
Steve tosses over a few with a slight frown that’s more grossed out than disparaging. “Still think you should actually wash your hands with water and soap before eating.”
“You stubborn son of a bitch. He will kill you,” Tony grits out. “Do you understand that?”
. “But yes, I got you Netflix. You’re welcome. Sadly, however, this does forgo your birthday present because Netflix wasn’t exactly cheap.”
“Menace,” Tony hisses and it feels like all at once he’s hard, like he’s sixteen rather than forty-mumble. Although when he was sixteen he’s pretty sure his chest never constricted this tight at the picture of relatively chaste kisses being pressed to the inside of his thigh. Tony doesn’t know how Steve manages to encapture such tenderness and affection while also cupping, rolling, and squeezing Tony’s balls in his large palm, how he manages the adoration in his gaze as he’s flattening his tongue and lapping up the underside of Tony’s cock but he does and he does it very well. And it’s no contest; it’ll always be those soft touches that truly undo Tony.
On a Steve-patented mix of a groan and exasperated sigh, he says, “Tony.”
Uneasily, but meeting Tony’s eyes, Steve tells him, “There’s only been a few and that—no one was ever interested. Which is fine, I don’t think they really understood, and it wasn’t ever intended to go anywhere. Would never blame them for wanting to be safe about that. But—,” stronger and plainly, he says, “I always feel safe with you.”
Tony considers him, quirks his brow. “Yeah? Your turn then. How the hell did he end up here?”
“Perfect,” Steve says before he’s latching his way from collarbone to navel with the sharpness of canines. He pushes everything between them aside on his venture down, makes an impatient grump when one of the sheets get caught behind Tony’s knee.
This round, Peter lasts up the stairs and all the way to the nursery, breathing deeply against Tony’s neck the entire time. And even with the night they’ve had—the exhaustion, near-frustration, and the fact that tomorrow is going to be effing brutal—Tony is hesitant to let his sweet little boy go.
Dubious, Tony wonders, “Why am I getting Natasha Romanoff-vibes from you right now?”
Tony looks up from his tablet and sees a basement’s side wall getting demolished by a sledgehammer, the destruction muted. He doesn’t even remembering turning the tv on. He blinks at it in an attempt to divine some meaning from it. “Home Improvement,” Tony hazards.
“Right. Okay then. Two shakes and I’m yours,” Tony says and then he’s swiftly gone and back with an armful of towels. He instructs Steve to get off the bed before laying them out.
“Anything. I’ll take anything,” Steve says because so far
“Oh, you little monster. That’s dirty. Your father is going to kill me, you know this. Is that what you want? Cause that’s what will happen. And you, you’ll grow up thinking I was just a gabby figment of your imagination because Cappa will put away all of my pictures in his time of grief...that he caused by killing me because I didn’t get you in bed at a reasonable hour.”
, two missions ago, a tank slipped out of your hand and took out a small grove,” Tony reminds him. “Plus it’s not so much that I’m rooting against you but that I am unequivocally cheering for me.”
Funny enough, Lang’s words had rang true for the Avengers despite the ex-con not being a part of the team at all. Hank Pym had instilled his distrust of
He knew that Tony’s work was very important but for goodness’ sake—the man himself was important too. Not just to his company, to his suits and bots, to his friends, to the team, to the world but to Steve. It truly made Steve angry when remnants of Howard’s twisted sense of parenting showed itself on even the minute details of his partner’s life.
words.
Including Steve.
The ceremony was beautiful, the sunset adding a more ethereal touch to the whole event. Steve nearly dropped the rings as he pulled them out of his pocket when the time for the vows came and managed to save them with his fast reflexes.
He had filled up a couple of sketchpads trying to capture those qualities in paper, but he had resigned himself to the fact that even his eidetic memory wouldn’t do those eyes justice, even if he had their captivating mix of brown, gold and hazel down pat perfectly—which he didn’t. Tony only snorted when Steve told him that his eyes were what’s going to destroy his credibility as an artist because they always changed colors every time Steve managed to make him sit down for a portrait, rendering his work inaccurate. Even with that reaction, he knew the brunet took that as a compliment because he rewarded Steve with a searing kiss.
“I’m home.” He gingerly placed his hands on Tony’s waist as he took in the man’s get-up, as to not dirty the perfectly pressed white dress shirt, “What’s with the outfit, sweetheart? I thought Miss Potts gave you a break until Thursday?” It couldn’t possibly be a meeting, seeing as it was already seven-thirty in the evening—which meant it was going to be a party.
The Avengers was
Tony prayed he would one day wake up back in Steve’s arms and the whole Compound would be filled with sounds and not the grating silence he was still trying to accustom himself with. He imagined the sounds from the loud arguments between Rhodey and Sam. From Vision who would terrorize the rest of them with his penchant for old man music like Steve, the flitting of TV channels because of Natasha’s quest to avoid trashy reality TV, the gentle melodies from Wanda’s guitar and the loud cheers from Clint for thrashing everyone’s record again in Mario Kart.
they were an endless cycle of bliss and fights. Like an ouroboros eating its own tail, they were fighting only to make up and fight again.
Steve used his other hand to move Tony’s leg higher over him, his lips quirking suggestively at the audible hitch in the other man’s breath as he felt the hardness between Steve’s legs.
Morning found him staring up into ever-changing pools of warm brown.
“Hey, Cap. You ready?”
“Tony?”
over the years. The doodles the blond would create on Tony’s post-its, the tacky frame housing a photo of the original team, the sketch of the ‘big, ugly building’ Tony knew he loved and lastly, the framed sketch of a dancing monkey balancing on a tightrope carrying Captain America’s first shield.
“I know that too. Part of the fun when she visited.” Tony chirped before raising an eyebrow at Steve, “As much as I love talking about her, can we go to the part where we talk about why Captain America was baby-talking a grown ass man out of his own lab?”
Like Steve had any care about being
“Changed my mind, a shower sounds perfect.” He impishly grinned as he walked them to the bathroom. Tony wrapped both his arms around the soldier’s neck and his legs around the man’s hips.
Steve immediately hopped on his bike, not giving a fuck if the rain was beating down his back and earned himself two speeding tickets in his haste to get to Tony. When he arrived at the Tower, he was relieved FRIDAY let him in—after ten minutes of pleading with her—and that Pepper was out of the country. He made his way to the penthouse and felt his heart free fall into the lobby of the Tower. The brunet was curled up on the bed asleep, definitely cried himself to sleep, while clutching Steve’s pillow.
He had quickly regretted his words as the amusement on Tony’s face bled into something borderline devious as he slyly looked at Steve. His eyes twinkling with mischief that Loki himself would be jealous.
Steve’s own eyes narrowed when he noticed that Tony was doing that wounded doe look the genius knew made it hard for others to deny him. And dammit, he knew Steve fell for it most of the time, however, too bad for him, Steve was on a mission at the moment.
It was the same exact look in the eyes of the man he loves—
“If you hate it so much, then why did you leave?” Tony couldn’t help but ask for the hundredth time despite knowing that he would be receiving the same answer every time.
He lingered a little on those long, thick and elegantly curled strands that mesmerized him whenever Tony blinks. The first time he had observed them closely was during a debrief in Fury’s office. He was sitting beside Tony and light of the late afternoon was shining down from behind them courtesy of the floor to ceiling windows.
