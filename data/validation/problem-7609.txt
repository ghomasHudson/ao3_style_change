"Hey!" he said as Tony approached. "Are you all right?"
The bell rang then, causing Peter to jump as it was right above their heads. He managed to sneak into the classroom and slide into his seat just before the teacher turned around, and if he had to guess, also managed to completely ace his final exam, meaning he would finish another school year with straight-A's.
"Me too," Steve grunted. He cupped Tony's cheek in his free hand, turning his head to find his lips as the pleasure swirling inside his body suddenly spiked. "Touch yourself, sweetheart. I want you to come with me."
But first, they had a battle to win. 'The most intense and difficult battle of their lives,' based on what Peter had heard from Dr Strange.
he thinks.
"As long as you promise not to punch anything for a while, yeah?" Tony said sternly. "And for Christ's sake, Steve, I mean it."
Steve's third trip, while definitely not as pleasant as the second, was probably the most important of them all, giving Steve a much-needed boost of both morale and confidence that this ridiculous, cockamamie plan of theirs was actually going to work.
Then again, Bucky had been joking about he and Tony having sex after their first date so maybe just a kiss would be okay. But then again Steve had only ever kissed one other person and that had been over ten years ago and definitely not all that memorable, and Tony had a son so he was obviously more experienced in sexual matters than Steve was anyway, so—
"That was some pretty fancy flying there,
of his armoured feet is oddly comforting, and Steve figures that as long as he can still hear them, it should mean that Tony’s okay.
"Well, yeah. You asked me to wear it, right?"
"I'm much better now," Steve said, his warm breath on Tony's neck causing him to shiver. They had finally celebrated their anniversary the night before, including the recreation of their wedding night that Steve—and Tony—had so badly wanted, and it had been glorious. Even three years after the fact, Tony still couldn't believe that he'd been so lucky as to marry someone as incredible as Steve, and the amount of love and attention that Steve had showered him with the night before, well… it was pretty much indescribable.
"The wormhole's collapsed!" Tony shrieked as he swerved back around. "Quill, you and Carol take out the rest of his guards. Rhodey, Sam, let's get behind that fucker and force him over to Steve!"
It wasn't his fault that his family attracted supervillains like magnets, or that the only one of them not allergic to winter had been Obadiah.
Apparently love really is blind.
“Oh, yeah, that sounds awesome!” said Peter.  “I’m starving!”
The ultimate in de-aging treatments, as Tony had put it.
It was how all of Grandpa's visits went. He would show up sometime around mid-morning, huffing and puffing from walking all the way from their house to the hospital, sit down and debate with Peter about some aspect of the new project, and then the moment that Peter contradicted him about something or pointed out something that they'd already discussed, he would clam up and fall asleep.
Tony pressed his palm to his chest, pushing Steve's dog tags into the scarred skin covering his pounding heart. "Yeah, bud, it did," he whispered. "But you know that doesn't necessarily mean what you think it might mean."
"Shall I inform Miss Stacy that you will speak to her later?" asked JARVIS. "Again?"
And ever since then, Steve had kept his word.  In the ten or so months since their first date, Tony had lost count of the ways Steve had demonstrated his love and commitment not only to Tony, but to Peter as well.  From offering Tony his arm and opening doors for him while out and about to picking up Peter at school and cooking him dinner when Tony had to work late, Steve had shown time and time again that this was no passing fancy for him.  It was real.
"Tony! You're—you're
Peter shook his head. "Who?"
"It is indeed, sir," answered JARVIS. "How may I be of assistance?"
"Tony—" Steve started, tilting his head.
😭 = I got you right in the feels
“Yeah, that’s the one,” said Tony.  “Listen, I know this might sound a bit weird, but I’m calling because—”
"No, no, she's fine," replied Rhodes. "Soon as she came through I told her what happened, so she decided to stay up there with the backup patrollers. She's attempting to locate the source of the beam that hit Captain Barnes, but—"
Obie frowned as he downed the last of the Scotch in his glass.  “Yes, as a matter of fact, I do know.  I ordered all the trials suspended around six months ago.”
"But we don't know its exact location?" Sam asked.
"Well…" Peter started, gulping. His request was a long shot at best, but he supposed it didn't hurt to ask anyway. "You know that Irish Festival in Brooklyn that you and Dad are planning on going to on St Patrick's Day?"
Even if in this case, the actual truth and the rumours just happened to be one in the same.
General Arnold gave a grim nod. "Yes, Captain, that's very true. I guess you would understand that better than anyone."
"We don't—we don't have to do anything," Steve said, obviously mistaking Tony's silence for hesitation. "I just… I'd love to be able to hold you while I sleep."
"What did you do to me?" Steve whispered, barely catching himself on the wall before he tipped over. Panic welled inside him as he clawed at his sleeve with his fingers, trying to scratch away the vile symbol. "I will never become one of you!"
"Which I won't ever do," Peter said quickly. It'd been ridiculous how many times he'd had to promise his dads that he would be careful driving with Gwen. "Well, at least not too obnoxiously."
They rode to the hospital in a blur of blaring sirens, with Rhodey, Sam, and Carol following behind in Rhodey's car. As soon as Steve was wheeled through the doors the doctors sprang into action, hooking him up to IVs and checking him over for other signs of injury.
"There's no one else here, Peter," an unfamiliar voice said, causing Peter to whip around. "It's just you."
"Yeah, I'm glad you think so," muttered Tony. He frowned as Strange picked himself up and set off down the corridor without so much as a glance back, the maroon cloak wrapping itself around his neck as he stomped away.
Searching the debris-laden battlefield, Steve located King T'Challa standing within a group of his warriors, all holding their body-length shields over their heads.
Ned winced, then immediately busted out laughing. "Okay, ouch, that sucks, but now I'm trying to imagine you on waterskis, and I just
"Well… no, not exactly," Peter replied. "It's not really that simple. Have you told Betty that you like her?"
CW: Steve experiences a short flashback in his chapter, and there is also a very brief mention of another character’s suicidal thoughts.  Please be safe 💗
"No, no, little guy, it's okay," Steve said. He pressed his palm to his chest, over his thudding heart. "I think I just lost track of time is all."
Unsure of what to do, Peter hesitated just long enough for the monster's next punch to land squarely on his jaw, sending him flying at least ten metres to crash against the outside wall of the prison, right next to a sign that read Seagate Penitentiary.
Tony paused to take a breath, his beautiful brown eyes glassy as he held out his hand towards Peter, who carefully dropped Steve's ring into his palm.
"Oh my God," Peter whispered, rubbing his palms up and down his arms as his Spider Sense continued to go haywire. He had been
"Mmm," Tony grumbled as he slumped into the chair. His heart was racing, and his left hand was so tightly clenched that his fingernails were digging into his skin.
"That's right," answered Tony. "The Iron Legion has managed to thwart 'em every single time."
"No, I know you didn't," Steve said, attempting a smile. "And I didn't mean to imply that. I'm just… I just feel like I'm being pulled in all these different directions, when all I really want to do is curl up in bed with you and Peter and just sleep for the next week or so."
"Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying," stated Phillips, far too calmly for Tony's taste. "Our leaders and Meridia's leaders are one in the same, because the so-called Meridian government is nothing but a bunch of puppets doing O'Brien's bidding. It's all just been one big show to keep both the Langaran and Meridian citizens under constant war."
Gwen giggled. "Well, in your line of work, I'd say just give it time. Who knows what you guys will run into next."
"Eh, maybe," Tony admitted. "But it's not like anyone else can keep up with us tech-wise, so I wouldn't worry too much about it."
"Gotcha," Tony said as he dropped four pellets into the tank, chuckling when the fish shot up so quickly up from the bottom that he ended up zooming right past them. The fish quickly turned, attacking the first pellet so voraciously that Tony heard an audible
It just wasn't a true Stark-Rogers home without JARVIS.
Which, Tony had to admit, was likely the main reason why he was still alive in the first place.
“But—but…” Steve choked out.  “I st-still d-did it!”
It’s still a far cry from his cheesy
—well, they just didn't deserve to know him.
😣 = the angst is killing me!
"Thank you. Sam, Bucky, I need the two of you to fan out. Sam can take the high ground, and Bucky—"
“Right behind ya, Cap!” Tony says as Clint swings down from one of the nearby trees, landing on the backseat of Natasha’s jeep.  She immediately guns the engine, aiming for the road that runs alongside the northernmost guard towers.
"Steve, I told you not to worry about that," Tony said with a sigh. "Rhodey's up there with him now, okay? He wanted to make sure that Pete heard what happened from one of us instead of someone who didn't know him."
Instead of answering, Steve rolled on top of Tony, carefully straddling him before grinding his hips down.
“Wow, that's gorgeous,” he said under his breath.  He gave the bike one final look of longing before climbing into the passenger seat of the same orange Audi Tony had been driving when he’d picked him up.  “Um… do you ever take that bike out?”
Steve tilted his head, his blue eyes glassy as they bored into Tony's. "I've made you afraid of me."
"Nothing wrong with girls," Tony mumbled into Steve's uniform, which definitely needed a good wash. "Especially one whose idea of a good first date involves introducing the boy to her parents."
face.
Steve couldn't help but chuckle again, encouraged by the sight of his husband's beautiful smile. "I may have made some preliminary plans," he sheepishly admitted. "But that was even before we left, so… let's just say that at the moment they're still in the—"
"Okay, but put a boost on it, will ya, J, Steve is trapped!" Tony snapped, pounding on the ice once with his own fist to no avail. "And send out the reconnaissance suits too, yeah? I wanna see who or what the hell managed to cause this! No one's allowed in or out of the Compound until we find 'em!"
"All right," Steve said, nodding in Ma's direction. "He's ready."
"Yeah, okay, but can we talk more about this once we get out of here?" Peter said. "'Cause I don't really think that—"
, once we get home, you are going to be grounded until you're at least eighteen! And maybe even longer!"
"We all did," Natasha said quickly, giving Clint's wrist a squeeze. "But none of us as much as Clint and Dr Selvig. Their effects were… more direct."
him with every single caress of his hands and touch of his lips.
Arriving behind his lane, Steve briefly closes his eyes, trying to focus himself.  It’s not helping that he’s swimming in lane six this time, one he’s never swam in before in a big competition like this, which means he’ll be at least one lane away from most of the main contenders.  Shostakov is in lane four, having qualified for the finals with the best overall time, with Bucky in lane three and Bernier next to Steve in lane five.  The times this year haven’t been as fast as those that were turned in four years ago, likely partially due to the fact that the full-bodied swimsuits that were so popular back then are no longer allowed.  Once it was determined that they were causing such dramatic drops in swimmers’ times, FINA, the International Swimming Federation, decided to ban them.
Not that it was anything new. All the doctor had done was reinforce what Peter already knew anyway.
"Yes, Captain. As I stated previously, Master Peter is currently sleeping comfortably."
Mr Toomes stepped closer then, his beady eyes narrowing as they swept over Peter, sending another freezing bolt down his back.
"It does not have to be right this very moment, Captain," T'Challa assured him. "Once the conflict is over will do just fine."
For some bizarre, unfathomable reason, Steve absolutely loved the mess of scars on Tony's chest. Loved to trace them with his fingertips while they laid in bed together, loved to kiss and caress them while they were intimate. He said they were a visible reminder of Tony's strength and tenacity, whatever that meant, but when it all came down to it, there was just no way that Tony could deny Steve something he loved.
"Of course I do. It was when you taught me how," Papa answered, his blue eyes twinkling as he studied the board, finally moving a pawn. He reached across to ruffle Peter's hair. "You've grown a bit since then, don't you think?"
"Yes, I would agree," answered Dr Strange. He stepped to the side, indicating the spinning golden circle. "After you, Captain."
"Well, then you may as well use it, right?"
"Yeah, yeah, okay. I was thinking, those glasses that Beck demonstrated, I think it might be possible to use those to sort of reverse the Winter Soldier programming in both Pete and Bucky." He held up his hand as Steve let out an excited gasp. "Now, before you go getting too excited, right now I can't think of a way to do that without actually saying all of the trigger words in sequence, and believe me, I've tried. But if I can get this thing to work the way that I think I can, once the words are spoken the device would just kind of neutralise them inside their subconscious, essentially removing HYDRA's influence."
"I am afraid I am unaware of any problems with Master Peter, sir," JARVIS said, just as softly. "Is there a problem with him?"
A noise somewhere between a choke and a gasp worked its way up from Peter's lungs, only to get lodged in his throat.
Tony's smile faded a bit as he tilted his head, fiddling with the stem of an apple. "Not exactly. I… that kinda came about a bit later, but… yeah, I guess you could say that they were hoping I'd create something like that. General O'Brien and the other government leaders have been trying to come up with a way to build an orbital defence system for a long time, and when none of their guys could seem to do it to their specifications, they turned to me."
Steve’s fingers relaxed on Tony’s wrists, his cheeks flushing.  “I guess it does.”  His eyes wer bright, but despite the way that Tony shifted in his lap, he didn’t make a move.
“I’m fine,” Tony said, holding up a hand.  “Jarvis.  It’s fine, let him be.”  Jarvis gave him a look, but he stepped aside.
“I had a plan,” Steve said, staring at the ceiling.
Keeping her talking was the best way to keep her distracted.  “Something else?  School?  Friends?”  In his ear, Nat was whispering a particularly vicious Russian threat, and he heaved a slight sigh.  “Friends are just...”  Clint shook his head.  “Never save anyone's life, they just never let you forget it.”
Steve took a deep breath.  “He's sick,” he said, because DJ needed the facts most of all.  He needed calm. As long as Steve stayed calm, hopefully DJ would stay calm. “He's at my place, because he's sick.  I'm going to take care of him until he feels better, so he's not alone.  He's going to be fine.  But right now?”  He gave DJ a smile.  “He's sick, and he fell asleep.”
“This is going to blow your mind,” Sue interrupted, “but I know where you can find a couple of kids.  Ones just about his size.”  Tony looked at her, his face creasing in confusion, and Sue let out a sigh.  “You do remember I have children, don't you, Tony?”
“I seem to remember that you did,” Steve said, and Tony grinned, his head falling forward.
“Right, and what will happen when she asks Phil about your registry?” Tony asked, bracing a hand on the back of the couch.  He leaned in.  “The Phil who definitely is not in Las Vegas.”
She slapped the magazine closed, setting it down in front of her and folding her hands on top of it.  “We do,” she said, with a practiced smile.  “Includes full ceremony, photo package, and matching certificates, suitable for framing.”
“There will likely be weeping.  Loud.  Embarrassing.  You’re better off not knowing any more of the details,” Tony said.  “You’d lose all respect.”
"I knew how to use a microwave and Swiss Miss was good to me," Tony said, and Steve's chest clenched.  Tony glanced up at him, a wry smile on his lips.  "Wipe that look off your face, Rogers, I'm fine."  He reached for his phone.  "I don't get sick."
"Captain Rogers, I would never," Tony said, doing his best mock innocent voice.  Steve, who knew him a little too well by this point, just grinned.  Tony crooked a finger at him.  "Come here, your collar's all bunched up."
Tony grinned at him, affection sweeping over him.  He had an unfortunate weakness for a cranky Cap.  “You shouldn't fight them so hard,” he said, as they headed across the broad lobby towards the elevators.  “You make it easy to get shots of you, and they're worthless, Steve.  You struggle to keep yourself out of the limelight, and the one or two that manage to get a good picture, the price goes through the roof.”  He flicked his sunglasses off of his nose, folding them and slipping them into his pocket.  “You really need to learn to play the game.”
Steve glanced up. Victor Aimsbridge was walking across the green room, a tablet tucked easily under his arm. He gave Steve a slight smile, his eyes bright behind the lenses of his glasses. “May I?” he asked, his pale eyebrows arching.
Steve felt his face heat.  “He's very fast, and very quiet when he wants to be,” he said.  He held out a hand to DJ.  “Come on, back inside.  You're going to be in the way.”
Tony stroked a hand over his hair.  “We okay?” he whispered, and Steve nodded against his shoulder.  “Okay.” Tony moved in his arms, and Steve’s grip tightened, an instinct he couldn’t quite resist.  Tony kissed the side of his neck.  “I’m not going anywhere.”
“This is-”  Tony's head dipped forward.  “This is nice.”  He looked up at the room.  “Hell, it's a much nicer wedding reception than I ever thought I'd have.”
Darcy patted him on the back.  “I’m not sure if smothering yourself with a high end hotel pillow is really the best solution to this problem, babe.”
“Don't go all shrink on me,” he said.  Sam didn't say anything.  He just waited, his face calm, his gaze steady.  Tony huffed out a breath.  “You said it yourself.  I'm bad at this.”
Steve leaned over his shoulder.  “I've had enough bad propaganda pictures of me punching world leaders in circulation,” he said.  “I'm not faking it with a cardboard cutout.”
His head swung towards Tony.  “When is the last time you’re sure he was with you?”
"No," Tony said.
“No,” Steve told him, lowering him down onto the bed.
“You have no idea,” Steve said.  He started up the stairs again, his shoulders squared, his jaw at a dangerous angle.
Clint grinned.  “Asshole.”  He picked up an empty bowl.  “Which ones did he want, and where’s the food coloring?”
“What would you do about it?” Carol asked.  “Try to institute conversational standards for trash talking?”  She shook her head.  “That would've just made it worse.”
Tony nodded, his face sad.  “I didn't.”
DJ nodded, his eyes bright.  “I can teach you.”
Tony bit back a curse.  It was a stupid thing to say.  Childish.  Needy.  And he was too old, and too smart, to let it go any further, to get into a stupid discussion about the stupid things his head came up with.  If he had any sense, he’d end this now.  He could end this now, it wouldn’t even be hard.  A kiss.  The stroke of a hand.  A few whispered words.  He knew Steve, and Steve looked as wary as he felt, his expression guarded, his posture tense.
Jarvis nodded.  “Good.  Everyone is fine.  You were the only one who was injured, and you will recover, in short order.” He set the tray down on the table, the movements smooth and efficient.  He looked up, and smiled, just a little, a slight flex to his lips.  “Everyone is fine.”
“Somewhere, Cap just shuddered and he has no idea why,” Tony mused.  He leaned up against the edge of Bruce’s desk, his arms crossed over his chest.  “Question.  Why is DJ washing your dishes?”
“Yes, and no.”  Tony didn’t look at him.  He couldn’t.  Steve had a way of muddling his brain.  “A group that’s…  Deeply embedded in both the military and the Federal government, but not exactly part of either.  It might never be.”
“Okay, so, I don't think I'm needed here,” Tony said, holding up his hands.  “I'm going to go-” He gestured at the door.  “I'm going to go, I don't know, invent something or blow something up, I haven't decided yet.”
“He talked bad about Tony,” Natasha said, and as one, the entire team turned to look at Tony.
"You are," Tony said, with a grin.  "So..."  He spun Pepper out, her hand still cradled in his.  “Talk fast or take a seat, Officer.”
“Good try,” Sam said, as they headed across the street towards the nearby park.  At this hour, the jogging path was almost deserted, only a few stalwarts making the rounds.
“Right, now I’m worried,” he mumbled, looking back at his computer.  God, he hated menus and online ordering and he hated this website.  He really hated this website. “Do we really need mini fruit covered cheesecakes?”
“Of course he did,” Steve said, but he was smiling now.
“Whatever that man’s paid, it’s not enough,” Steve said.
“I was unaware that you wished me to spy on your teammates,”  Jarvis said, his voice tart.  “And provide you with information they considered private and confidential.”
Jan's mouth opened.  Closed.  She sighed.  “You can't-”
"Ah, speak of the angel, and he shall appear," Tony said, without even looking back.  He crooked a finger in Steve's direction.  “Come here.”
Jarvis was very definitely not smirking at him.  “Sir,” he said, his tone holding just the tiniest hint of censure, “I am hurt by that implication.  When have I ever done anything other than my utmost for you?”
Steve took a breath, and it looked like it hurt, it sounded like it hurt.  “Sit here,” he said, his voice reedy and thin.    “On, on the bed, and-”  His voice trailed away, leaving Tony to fill in the blanks.
“Then can we narrow it down a bit?” Tony asked.  “I’ve got a very full day planned, I don’t really have time for a rousing round of 20 questions.”
Bobbi watched them go.  “So.  He's the responsible one?” she asked, her lips twitching.
Steve gestured at the window frame.  “The lock on the window’s broken, the trellis outside’s got a few broken rungs.  Easy enough to assume our kidnapper came up that way, and forced his way in.”
“Right, let’s get on that,” Darcy said, and Sitwell was there, and Sitwell had a gun, and that was strange, that was very strange.
“Gone,” he said, and Tony snorted.
“That does happen, sir,” Jarvis agreed.
Something wasn’t right.
"Approximately zero," she said.
The older man turned from counter, a massive mixing bowl cradled in the crook of his elbow.  “This your boy?” he asked Steve, giving Tony a steely look.
Peter blinked hard, and Tony could tell he was trying not to cry.  “I won’t remember tomorrow.”
“Right.” Steve gave him a nod, and headed inside.
She went on her tiptoes, her nose an inch or so from his.  "Get un-busy," she said, her teeth flashing in the sort of smile that promised violence.  She rocked back on her heels.  "I'm taking your plates."
Ellen stared at her.  “No.  What code?”
“Are you playing hard to get?” Tony asked, and as he walked by, Steve scooped a pillow off of the bed ant threw it in Tony’s general direction.  Laughing, Tony knocked it away.  “Fine.  Preserve your modesty.  We’ll be waiting for you.”
“I don't, and I'm still comfortable with my 'no,'” Steve said.  He took the cup out of Tony's hand, stealing a sip of it before Tony could get it back.  His eyebrows arched.  “How drunk are you right now?”
“Can I come sit with you?” Tony asked.  A bare movement on his chin, but it was a nod.  “Thank you.”
“No,” Fury repeated.  “That, we’re not doing.  He wants to go to your place, we can make that work, but we’re not doing public transportation.”
Steve folded his arms on the railing, leaning forward to brace his chin on them.  "Looking for a rainbow," he said.
“Hammer might be dead,” Steve said, fishing in his pocket.  He came up with a handful of bills, holding them out to Billy.  “Stay here.  Keep trying to get through to Stark Manor.  If you do get through, tell them that Stane might be our kidnapper.”  He pressed the cash into the boy’s hand.  “Repeat that back.”
“Oh, that’s patently untrue,” Tony said.
In a rush, it expanded, folding out into a swirling portal, and Clea stepped through, her head bent over a scroll of paper.  “Is this important, darling?” she asked, walking the paper upwards with careful fingers.  She frowned down at something on the page, her mouth pursing up tight.  “I think I may have found something of use, it’s just-”
“Want Rhodey to stay with you?” Tony asked.  “You can teach him to fix the armor so he can do it himself instead of depending on child labor to handle it.”
“You fired everyone else,” Happy called after him, which was rank insubordination, and Tony absolutely wasn’t going to stand for it.
Her face softened, just a bit, her wide mouth relaxing into a smile.  "Of course, Captain Rogers."  But she tucked her thumbs into her belt.  To the boy, she said, "Shouldn't you be getting ready for school?"
It was empty.
Steve frowned.  “What aren’t you telling me?”
“It appears to be an explosive device with an unknown payload,” Jarvis said. The HUD blinked, and then a series of schematics started scrolling across his vision.  “I believe it would be inadvisable to allow it to detonate at this point.”
Jan pressed her fingertips to her chest.  "Oh, darling, it was nooooooothing," she said, before turning huge eyes on Steve.  "Steve?  Do you like it?"  She wrapped her arms around his bicep, hugging his arm.  "Tell me you like it."
He knew he did, that he had.  He felt the shift in his weight, saw the edges of his vision white out the way it did when he lost everything but his target.  He remembered the brief glimpse of red hair and black fabric, the flash of sun on metal, on glass, the sound of everything breaking, metal, glass, stone, the sound like his own heart stopping.  He remembered hitting his target, with all the force he could muster, body colliding with body, and the ground opening up to swallow him, falling away beneath him, and he held on, held on, held on, even as he fell.
“If you believe that he has always been fully clothed while in the workshop, I fear that I must provide you with some information which you may find shocking,” Jarvis said.  He sounded tired.  Sam choked on a laugh, and Steve gave him a look.
“Furbro,” DJ repeated.
“Because it’s more fun to drink alone?” he asked, rubbing his knuckles.  He’d split the skin there at some point, and every sweep of his thumb pushed the blood across his skin.
“I wouldn’t have gotten caught if you’d warned me about the ‘using me as a distraction’ plan.” Clint tossed a pen at her, and she caught it out of the air with a smirk.
Luke glared at him.  “You're an ass, you know that?” he asked.
Once they were gone, the door shut securely behind them, Tony returned to the main room of the suite.  Even for Vegas, it was large, with a dozen or more rooms; he hadn’t spent much time exploring last night.  He’d found DJ a bedroom, found himself a bedroom, and had assumed everyone else could take care of themselves.
"We won."
“Let her go,” Tony said.  “She likes to feel like she's doing something useful.”  He pushed himself away from the wall.  “What's wrong with the room?”
“Well, I mean, sure, why not at that point,” Harris mused.  He reached up, adjusting his glasses on his nose.  “Right.  I mean.  Right.”  He cleared his throat.  “I don’t want to, uh, it’s never a good idea to talk about money, but where did you get twenty thousand dollars?”
Agatha nodded, her head swinging towards DJ.  “You set a trap for a monster and snared a wandering child instead.”
He glared at her.  “Don't you even-”
Pepper picked up the silver pitcher from the table beside the bed.  “He’s fine,” she said, filling a cup with water.  “He’s-”
It was going to be a very long six months.
“It must be so nice for the two of you to have other children around to play with,” Natasha said, moving a pitcher of iced tea out of the way before the two of them could topple it.
“You're late.”
“Thank you.” Stark leaned over, his hands braced on his hips.  “Where's my crowbar?”
Harris handed him the con guide as he came up next to him.  “I was gone for less than five minutes, I barely left your line of sight, and you manage to complicate things,” he said, keeping a wary eye on the various Stevens and Stephens.  “How do you do this?”
“You might not be the best at keeping track of time, Mr. Stark,” Peter said. “Or schedules.”
“Capitalism!” Harris said, throwing both hands in the air.
“Because I do, I have many, many things that I'd rather be doing,” he said, striding up the hallway.  He was pretty sure he was trailing ribbon in his wake and he was pretty sure he didn't care.  “There's, there's so many things that I'd rather be doing, and-”
She reached up, cupping his face in her hands.  “Yes,” she said, with a wealth of feeling in her words.  “Yes, you absolutely are.”  She went up on her toes, brushing a kiss on his cheek.  “Absolutely useless.”
DJ flipped the book open and turned the pages, trying to find where he’d left off.  Not that it mattered all that much, there was nothing in here that he couldn’t bear to repeat a few times.  Or a few dozen times.  He huffed out a sigh, one finger rubbing Furbro’s head.  He flipped through the pages, his eyes eyes skimming over the text, even as his fingertips struck sparks against the paper.
“Pay attention to your partner,” she said, her eyes narrowed.
DJ grinned at him.  “Hi.”
“Yes.  Keep the front door locked.  If anyone comes in that isn’t Hammer, if someone tries to force the door, or if you smell smoke, take the other boys and go out the back.  Straight down the alley north to St. Mary’s.  Father Kimball’ll do a lot of yelling, but he’ll let you in.  Stay there until I send someone for you.”
“You can come with me next time,” Jan told her.  “You and Pepper and Natasha.  I’ll bring you a gown and we can be a mysterious band of glamorous and-”
Tony held his hands out to his sides.  "Do I pass muster?"
Tony kicked a chair away from the table.  “Sit down.  Before you fall down.”  He turned in his chair, bracing an arm on the back. “ Lewis!  Breakfast’s getting cold!”
DJ set his backpack down next to a chair, lowering himself down into it.  “Not good at parties,” he said, his fingers gripping the seat on either side of his legs.
Bobbi shook her head.  “I could use one myself.”  She looked at Steve.  “Let’s go, Officer.  Looks like you’re being offered the good stuff.”  She headed across the foyer, long-legged and easy, her hands tucked in her pants pockets, leaving Steve scrambling to catch up.
“No, thank you.” He turned, giving her a quick wave over his shoulder.  “I’ll leave you to figure out exactly why I need all of that.  Have a good night.”
The crack-snap of shattering glass made no sense for a moment, it was like an explosion in miniature, like lightning, even as it was echoed by the shards of glass cascading to the floor.  Tony heard it happen, more than saw it happen, the glass catching the light out of the corner of his eye as it came apart.
“The instructions?” Tony asked.  DJ rolled over to his charging station, picked up a stack of paper, and rolled back.  Tony took it from him.  “Is this three pages?  Single spaced?”  He flipped the top page.  “Double sided?  What the hell is wrong with this cat?  Does it have medical problems?  Is it dying?”
"It already HAS multiple meanings," Tony shot back.  One eyebrow arched.  "Most of them only borderline legal or moral."
He had half a second to consider his impending doom, and then Steve was grabbing him, lifting him off his feet.  Tony let out a sound that was embarrassingly close to a shriek, but Steve was probably laughing too hard to hear it as he dragged them both out onto the balcony.
“No, we’re cool, like I said, she paid bail,” Clint said.
Aunt May held up a hand. “Peter.”
It was harder than it should’ve been to get the front door open.
Jess leaned her chair back on two legs, her toes ghosting against the floor.  “Aren't you the press?  Technically?”
Magic and tech responded almost simultaneously, the armor snapping out, reaching out to envelop him at the same moment that reality collapsed in on him.  He twisted as he fell, a few inches at first, the carpet rushing up to meet him, and then, the carpet was gone.  The floor was gone.  The library was gone.
“Probably,” Steve said, the word caught in the hollow of Tony’s palm.  “Delicious, though.” His tongue darted out, tasting Tony’s fingers, and then he sucked one into his mouth, meeting Tony’s eyes as he did.
“Yes, but your bullet ridden corpse might cause a loss of consumer confidence,” Pepper said, studying her ledger.
“I suspect, sir, that she's already aware.”
“He is not asking for anyone,” Jarvis admitted.  “He is not responding to me.  However, he has gone to the lounge, and remains there now.”
“It is Clea, sir.”
“How?” Tony asked.
"This might surprise you, but our cuisine was kind of substandard," Steve said.  He paused.  "There's no prices on this menu."
“Oh, I am committed,” Okoye said.  To T’Challa, she said, “Will you please make her eat something, your Majesty?” She waved a hand at Shuri, who gave her brother a cheeky smile and a wave.  Okoye looked at her, disapproval on her face.  “Everything we give her, goes straight into her horse’s mouth.”
“Yes.”
Ellen's heart skipped a beat, but Duck didn't even look up.  “You're under contract.”
Steve's stomach iced over, a sickening twist of humiliation slicing through him.  For an instant he was frozen in place, trapped in his guise of a child playing dress-up, the kite still clutched in one hand, pinned by the realization that Stark must've seen the entire ridiculous thing.  Stark had seen him swinging a stick at a cat, like the idiot that he was, hiding behind a damaged kite.  And now he was standing there, one eyebrow arched in mocking consideration, his face amused.
He took one step forward, then two, his feet flying over the sand.  Tony watched, his jaw tight, as the backpack unfolded, a series of plates swallowing his slim form.  In the space of half a dozen steps, he was airborne, the armor carrying him aloft almost before it had finished forming.  The roar of the repulsors was a physical force, hitting Tony in the chest, and he realized he was covering the arc reactor with one flat hand.
Tony laughed, his fingers slid under Steve’s suspenders, tugging him forward.  “Relax, officer.  I’ve got you.”
“What?”  It took a moment for that to sink in, then Steve felt his face heat.  “No.  No, I think-”  He shook his head.  “No.”
And if love was a tide, then loving Tony Stark was a rip tide.  Hidden currents and invisible shoals.  He had no control over it, and he still wasn’t sure it wouldn’t kill him.
Next to him, Harris shifted in his seat, his knee bumping against DJ’s.  DJ looked at him, and Harris smiled.  “Are you sure about this?” he asked.  Darcy, who was seated on his other side, leaned forward, her hair sweeping forward in a wave.  It bounced with the movement of the car, and DJ wanted to make it match up to the lights flashing out on the street.
Steve studied Jan for a long moment, then held his hands out to his sides.  “Hi,” he said.
"That was our theory as well, Tony," Natasha said gently. "You mentioned that you saw something off to the side of the lake right before the ice formed, so if this guy Gill caused the ice and then disintegrated afterwards like the other guy did a few days ago, it would explain why we couldn't find him."
"Is that your house that got blown up?" asked the smallest of the boys, who was sitting to Peter's left. "We saw it on the news!"
"Fuck, I swear that accent of yours is gonna do me in one of these days," Tony said on a gasp as Steve's fingers curled around him again. "It's so fucking hot, baby, I can hardly take it!"
“That sounds awesome!” Peter exclaims.  “Thank you, Mr Rogers!”
"Everything's okay now," he said. "It's all over."
"All right." Gwen gave her ponytail another tug, her pretty green eyes sad and worried. "Just remember that you're not alone, okay? There's a lot of people who care about you."
T'Challa nodded, shooting Steve a furtive glance. "On my signal."
"With pleasure, sir," answered JARVIS. And before Peter realised what was happening, a parachute suddenly deployed from his back, yanking him clear from the ship.
“Goodbye, Steve.”
"Should be," Tony said with a short nod.
sucked though.
"Oh my God!" Peter exclaimed, slamming his palm against his forehead so hard that he almost knocked himself over. It was one of those details that hadn't seemed so important at the time, but he still couldn't believe that he'd forgotten about it until now.
The general took a sip of his drink, smacking his lips once he swallowed. "As much as I hate to seem like I'm badgering you, you really have not answered my initial question to my satisfaction."
"Ah, a couple days ago?" replied Bucky. "At the bar? You weren't there, you were out 'clearing your head' or whatever again, which is why we were all sitting around talking about you."
"Okay, so, obviously most of this is going to fall on Tony and Bruce to figure out," Steve added in his Captain's voice. "So I'm thinking that the rest of us should start training, prepping to face Thanos again. 'Cause as soon as we're able to find the information that we need to beat him, we'll need to move. Scott?"
-o'meter. "Well… since you guys have already fought against Thanos once today, how 'bout you give us a quick rundown on what we can expect, yeah?"
"Oh shit, baby," Tony said as he clenched down hard around Steve. "I can't—I'm gonna—
"Thanos," answered Bruce. He stepped back, clutching his arm. "Steve, he's coming, and we're—we're just not ready! We're nowhere near ready!"
he thought as he followed his small beam of light back to Steve's room.
“I think I’ve got a pretty good guess,” he whispered a few heartbeats later.  “And if I’m right, then it should be a no-brainer.”
"You do?" Peter exclaimed, stifling another cough. "Dad, that's so awesome! Who with?"
With a heavy sigh, Tony headed over to Steve, catching him midway through his pacing route.
"You know that's not what I meant," Steve replied. He dropped his chin to his chest, breathing in a slow, deep breath, the frigid air searing through his throat and down into his lungs. He and Tony had already bickered at least three times over what Tony had called his excessive hovering, and he was in no mood to go through it again. "I just want—"
Peter's eyebrows shot up under his hair. "Oh, you're using your made-up name? Then I am Spider-Man."
"We need to let Peter use the glasses, Tony," Steve said after a short pause. "We need to make sure that—"
Steve smiled, revealing the dimple that drove Tony mad as he leaned down to whisper in Tony's ear.
"Um, if you don't mind, we're kinda in a hurry here," said Sam.
"You do?" asked Peter. Papa had never mentioned anything about his name being blacklisted or anything. "How?"
"Missing the go/no-go point would mean the aircraft would be in danger of skipping off the atmosphere," said Steve. "Which means—"
"Tony, do you feel that?" Steve rasped against his neck. He rocked forward, pulling gasps from both of their throats. "Do you feel me inside you? Do you feel how well we fit together?"
Instead, after managing to stamp down his pain level just enough to drag his eyes downwards, he saw that instead of sprawled out on a freezing-cold floor, he was actually strapped to a concrete slab that was outfitted with several of what appeared to be some kind of fancy electrodes, not unlike the kind the SSR had used to measure his heart and lung capacity after his serum procedure.
"Oh, that's so much better, thank you!" exclaimed Hammer with a flourish, almost as though he was speaking to an audience. "Now then, as I stated, we're ready for Steven here to begin the test with the latest prototype, oh, and you're just going to
"No, no, let's not do that," Tony said with an emphatic shake of his head. "No need to be emphasising the Stark part."
He was a survivor.
"Well… would you wanna… maybe… I don't know… go and see—?"
"I know," Steve finally said. "I'll talk to him."
"Don't see that we've got much of a choice," Tony replied. "If we don't get those suits into some open air it'll be just like you said. They'll squash us all like bugs. Plus it'd be nice if we could break through their cloak and give Bruce a chance to hack into their files before they manage to delete everything."
If anything, it was Tony's.
"Yeah, Papa, I promise I got everything," Peter answered, suppressing an eyeroll. Papa always hovered a lot more than Peter thought was necessary whenever Dad wasn't with them, as if he assumed he needed to make up for Dad's absence. Dad had received an emergency phone call from the Department of Damage Control about five minutes before they were supposed to leave, something about a possible security breach with one of the trucks in D.C. transporting artefacts left over from the Triskelion, if Peter had overheard correctly. Lately anything involving D.C. was enough to make both Papa and Dad extra twitchy, especially since the presidential election was only a couple months away.
Hanging up the phone, Tony gave Steve a tentative smile.  Truth be told, he was just about as scared as Steve was, both about Steve’s health and his impending confrontation with Obie.  But somehow Tony also knew that just by getting the ball rolling in the right direction, instead of constantly feeling like he was trying to push a boulder uphill, he was already winning.
Papa gulped, fiddling with his spoon. "Yes," he finally said. "From what they can tell, whatever it was that attacked Wakanda came from somewhere in space."
"Steve, honey, please stop telling me thank you, yeah?" Tony said as he kissed Steve's knuckles. "I love you, all right? I love you so much, and you will never have to thank me for it. Not
Image Papa pleaded as he started rocking back and forth, nearly tearing Peter’s heart right in two.
"You're just deflecting again, like you always do," Peter cut in, frowning. "You know, I'm not a little kid anymore. You don't need to tiptoe around me as much as you do."
"All right," Tony said, picking up what he hoped was a blowtorch. "So the first thing we should probably do is figure out how much fuel we've lost, and then figure out how to repair the damage to the engine. After that—"
"Put him through, J!" Tony snapped. He whipped around, trying to force his face into a scowl, which failed miserably as soon as Steve's haggard face appeared on the screen.
"A bit," Peter muttered. "I think I could take it if it was only a bit, but they're like on completely different levels of paranoia. It's like they still think I'm just a little kid, but it's even worse than that because they've both seen me in training, so they know what I can do! I even managed to web Papa to the ceiling up at the Compound last summer!"
Of which, it turned out, there were many.  So many, in fact, that Steve’s pace soon slowed to almost a crawl as he was forced to take out one of the fire-trees nearly every ten or so paces, reminding him way too much of that dystopian arena movie series he had watched with Peter not too long ago.
Thor paused in mid-swing, ducking to allow yet another chunk of debris to sail over his head. "If you are referring to the time when I bested you and the Captain in combat, then—"
“Uh huh!”
"Yeah, I'm okay," Tony answered. "The ground forces have O'Brien's headquarters surrounded and are bringing him and his goons out now, and Phillips has us barricaded in here pretty good, so you don't need to worry about me. You just do what you're up there to do and get back home."
And somehow, Tony had managed to get him to fall in love with him.
"Great!" Peter exclaimed. It had been two days since Peter had last seen Steve and he had
"Um… how'd you figure out that Steve was coming here if he didn't tell you?"
Sliding back into his chair, Peter burrowed down into his hoodie, attempting to ignore Ned whose eyes were boring straight into Peter's skull.
No wonder Bucky was nervous about proposing to Sam. Piloting an experimental aircraft was nothing compared to trying to ask someone you liked out.
"You're welcome." She tucked Peter's blankets up to his chest. "I'm very sorry that I upset you, my dear."
"Yep, I'm ready," Peter said as he pulled on his jacket and slung his backpack over his shoulder. He stepped back to allow Gwen to get in front of him, smiling when he saw Papa nod in appreciation.
As soon as the door closed behind him Tony flopped onto his side, grabbing Steve's pillow and tucking it to his chest so he could breathe in more of his intoxicating scent. It was still a bit difficult for Tony to wrap his mind around the fact that he'd woken up in another man's bedroom—and a
But it was also because he was a coward.  Pure and simple.
"Would you like to serve your friend first, Gwen?" she asked.
The very same doctor who had then called Tony in the wee hours of the morning to tell him that he had a son, and that if he wanted to meet him before he died, he'd had better get his ass down to the hospital ASAP.
"Holy cow," Peter laughed as he inspected the cartons. "This is absolutely hilarious! You know we have to get these now, right?"
"Ready?" Steve asked as he stepped into the kitchen with his shield in hand, where Peter was still stuffing his face with one of the doughnuts Sam and Bucky had bought for him. Bucky's new cat, a pure white thing he'd named Alpine, was apparently a very picky eater, requiring a third trip out to the grocery store in as many days in an attempt to find a cat food that she didn't stick her nose up at. Tony had just about flipped his lid when he first saw Peter attempting to play with the grumpy feline, as he had always detested cats. But after being assured by Sam, Bucky, Peter, and Steve that the cat wouldn't be a problem, he had calmed down a little.
"I know," Steve murmured, so low and thick that a knot rose in Tony's throat. "And I was trying—Tony, I was trying so
Steve grinned against Tony's shoulder. "That's better."
Steve visibly flinched, and Tony immediately reached for his hand, bringing it to his lips. "Sorry, honey. I shouldn't've said that."
Tony's breath hitched, his throat bobbing as he swallowed.
Because as much as Steve would like to think that he’s not ready for another relationship, deep down, in places so dark he would never dream of divulging them to anyone else, he’s actually so lonely that he can hardly bear it.  Day after day, night after night, he’s alone, with no one he can really talk to.  Natasha and Clint try, but even they have their own lives outside of work, and Steve suspects that a lot of aspects of those lives overlap, although he would never say anything to them about it.  But aside from the occasional brief conversation with his elderly landlord and with Sharon as she’s torturing him during his PT sessions, Steve doesn’t have anyone to confide in.
Steve thinks.  He quickly scans the surrounding forest, taking out three more guards as he races by.
He needed to get Papa out of there, and as soon as possible.
“I know,” Papa forced out as he wiped the tears from his face.  “I’m—I’m—oh
A few minutes later Peter arrived at an overpass overlooking an alley where an old, beat-up van was parked with its back doors hanging open, a series of what looked like very hi-tech rifles and guns on display. Three men stood by the van, all talking too quietly for Peter to hear, but who appeared to be waiting for a potential buyer to show up. Peter quickly snapped a few pictures of the men to analyse later, then securely tucked his phone and continued to wait, tapping his fingers impatiently against his leg. Waiting had never been one of his strong suits.
"Why? Did you hear something?"
“Oh yeah,” Peter says with an exaggerated wince.  “That’s gonna take some getting used to.  I’ve never called any of my coaches by their first name before.”
To that end, Thanos was nowhere to be seen, at least from Tony's current vantage point. Based on what Tony understood about the infinity stones, which was admittedly not nearly enough as he would've preferred, Thanos would have to keep the Space and Reality Stones active in order to maintain the wormhole. Steve had explained to Tony that during the original battle, Thanos had used the Reality Stone to alter the Wakandan plain in order to locate the Soul Stone deep within its soil. But this time, as long as the wormhole was open, the Reality Stone would remain occupied.
"Holy shit, he wrote this during school?" he said with wide eyes. "Christ, no wonder…"
"I think myself, Sam, Bucky, and Nat should be enough," Steve replied, earning an affirmative nod from both Bucky and Sam. "If for some reason something else goes down, then Tony, Bruce, and Clint can always join us later."
"That's good." Peter paused for a moment, and Tony could just picture his adorable pursed lips and scrunched-up nose as he debated on whether or not to tell him something.
Dad huffed, scratching at the back of his head. "Ah, we kinda killed the alien dude who was sent to get the Time Stone."
"Oh, like you never gloat?" said Bucky. "If that's the case, then who was it that was telling us the whole way over here about how he finally beat Петр at chess yesterday, hmm? Стиви, was that you?"
Not even Steve.
“The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield,” JARVIS answers.  “This technology is well beyond any other HYDRA base that we’ve taken.”
"What's this about, ma'am?" asked Steve as he opened his paper, his eyes narrowing as he skimmed it. "The Armed Services Committee?"
of his external oxygen sending a shiver racing down Tony's spine. Aside from his irrational fear of the dark, that godawful, evil-sounding noise was the one thing that he hated most in the world.
Tony dropped his chin to his chest, slowly shaking his head.  Nine-thirty was Peter’s bedtime on school nights, and Obie knew it.  But that still didn't mean that the weekend was over.
“Hmph,” Tony muttered.  “Nothing like a big-ass bully with an even bigger-ass, seventy-year-old grudge, hmm?”
Steve gave a quick nod, the corners of his full lips curling into the soft smile that only he ever saw.
He covered Tony's hand with his own as he came to a stop near the nose of his X-302, where Carol, James, and the rest of the A-shift pilots—minus Sam—were already assembled. Normally Tony would've already headed up to the observation deck—aka the Control Room—to watch as the patrol group took off, but Steve had asked him to stay until he boarded his aircraft, both to show the rest of the team that Tony's role was just as important as theirs, and so he could keep holding his hand for as long as possible.
"No, no, let's not do that," Tony said quickly. "How long do you think it'll take?"
face.
"We fight," Papa said firmly. "Like our universe depends on it."
Peter sighed in relief as Ned finally turned to face the front of the bus, sticking in his AirPods. He did feel bad that Ned didn't have a special someone like he did, but at the same time, his third-wheeling was getting really annoying.
"First, allow me to introduce Wong," Dr Strange said, indicating an Asian man standing over by the destroyed staircase's railing. "He and I work together here at the Sanctum."
"But that's not gonna be enough!" Peter yelled as Quill began bouncing his way back towards Thanos on magic floating circles thrown by Dr Strange, landing one of his magnetic explosive devices onto Thanos' back.
"It is to me." Steve slid his fingers underneath Tony's chin, tilting his head up to meet his eyes. "I want you to feel comfortable here, Tony, so if there's something you need in order to feel more at home then I hope you'll let me know."
Tony pursed his lips, glancing at Steve over Peter's head. "All right, big guy, go ahead and activate the interface."
"Steve, that's not it," Natasha sighed as she plunked back down onto the chair. "I guess I just never expected you to take this one lying down. After everything you've been through, and everything you've overcome, I guess I just never thought you would meet something that would actually beat you."
"Oh, now that smells amazing," Steve said as Natasha set the pie down on a cooling rack, right next to another identical pie.
"Nope."
The slightest hint of a smile stretched across Thanos' wrinkled lips. "You're not the only one cursed with knowledge."
The headrush that Steve gets as the crowd erupts into cheers is like none that he's ever felt before.  A huge smile splits his face as he raises his hands to wave at the adoring fans, many waving American flags as they chant his name.
"Um… is that normal?" Peter asked after a short pause when no parent came running to make sure that no one was dead or bleeding or something. There was no way either Dad or Papa would ever not investigate if Peter had happened to shriek like that at home. No possible way.
"You can't have me!" Image Peter cried. "I'm not gonna let you!"
"Steve, I wish I knew," said Sam. "But I'm afraid that's a better question for people like Tony and Bruce. Or maybe even Thor."
"Yeah, well, that's not shocking." He pulled on his mask, glancing in both directions as he tried to get his bearings. "I need to find my papa. Will you help me?"
Tony’s fingers curled into such tight fists that his fingernails broke through his skin, causing him to flinch.  He drew in a deep breath, deliberately loosening his grip as he looked Fury straight in the eye.
“Ya think?” retorts Tony.  “Is that why I just bounced the hell off of it like a goddamn trampoline?”
He was silenced by Steve's mouth, claiming his in a kiss that had none of the chasteness or gentleness of his earlier kisses. Steve's teeth nipped at Tony's lips as his tongue swept inside his mouth, tasting him as his fingers trailed back down Tony's chest and abdomen to finally, blessedly, curl around Tony's aching cock.
"No, Dad, nothing like that," said Peter. "He just—"
"Nah, Pepper's just concerned because she's one of the most well-organised, Type-A people I've ever met," Tony assured him. "It's the main reason why she was such a good assistant. She can crack a whip almost as well as you can, which, if you haven't noticed yet, someone like me happens to need every now and then."
"Thank you," Peter said as he climbed into the truck's passenger seat. As soon as he'd fastened his seatbelt, he tipped his head back, rubbing at his temples.
It was just like the Battle of New York all over again, when he'd watched Tony fly a nuclear missile through Loki's portal while he just stood there on the ground.
Again, Steve’s absolute inability to maintain a poker face betrays him, forcing him to watch as Natasha does a weird little three-second victory dance.  “Oh, I
“Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, JARVIS!  How many times has he called?”
"Yep, all three of 'em," Peter said. He closed his eyes as Steve brushed the hair from his forehead, leaning over to kiss him again.
I’m always eager to hear what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  😊
Steve's belly gave a hard swoop. "Thanks. And good luck."
The thought of someone like Obie or that asshole Army general getting their grubby hands on something like the BARF glasses almost made Peter want to puke.
Apparently Mags wasn’t kidding when she said that swimmers are lean, if lean actually means cut from the finest fucking marble that’s ever existed.
"No, no, you did the right thing," Tony said as his left hand curled into a fist. He should've known that Howard wouldn't take him seriously about staying away from Peter. Howard Stark never listened to anyone if he didn't feel like it, and that usually went double for Tony.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony's gorgeous brown eyes twinkled as he pretended to ponder. "Well, now I gotta think a minute here, 'cause that's a tough one, you talking about whisking my son and me off to some sunny Mediterranean paradise. But since you're so damn cute and all, I s'pose I'll just have to get over myself and allow you to do it."
"I did already," Tony croaked. "I didn't—"
"Yes, baby, I can feel you," Tony whispered. His smooth skin glistened in the candlelight, and Steve was certain that he had never been more beautiful. "It's like you're inside my very being."
Tony woke with a start, bolting upright on the bed as he struggled to draw in air. Droplets of sweat beaded across his forehead and nose as he wrapped his arms around his front, his eyes darting from the walls to the ceiling of his bedroom, searching for cracks. A few heartbeats later he heard a soft moan, causing him to jump as he looked down at his sleeping husband. Steve shifted slightly, his arm instinctively sliding across the bed as he searched for him. Tony and Steve usually slept so pressed up against each other it was difficult to tell who was who, with their arms and legs tangled together and Tony curled right into Steve's chest, where he could hear his heartbeat and feel his warm breath on his skin. Tony had grown so used to having Steve there in the bed with him in the last five years, reveling in his husband's warm body pressed up against him and the security that Steve's presence offered him, that he now couldn't sleep without him.
"Oh, no!" exclaimed Steve.
voice that he'd had perfected for almost as long as he could talk. Even his puppy dog eyes were blazing in full force, testing Tony's already thin patience.
"Damn right, you won't," Tony said under his breath. Despite his hesitancy in leaving Peter behind, Tony did not like Steve going off without him either. He had already upgraded the locator chips that he sewed into each of Steve's uniforms to maintain a constant lock on him as soon as he exited any of the Avengers' facilities, using a brand-new rotating transmission frequency program that Peter had helped him write over the summer. HYDRA had managed to override the locator in Steve's phone only seconds after they arrested him back in May, and there was no way Tony was going to allow himself to lose sight of him ever again.
"Yeah, I'm fine. You just—you just startled me is all."
Fury dropped his shoulders.  “Tony, I really don't think this is help—”
"And you know it's never a true Thanksgiving dinner without the pies!" shouted Clint. He winced as Natasha elbowed him in the arm, eyeing his left ear.
he thought.
At least Dad had finally called him, right before his supposed bedtime. He hadn't told Peter anything that he didn't already know, and the intense worry in Dad's voice had nearly shattered Peter's already busted-up heart, but it was still good to at least hear his voice, to know that he was doing whatever he could to help Papa get home.
But apparently, the same HYDRA asshole who had caused Peter's Spider Sense to flare up even before he understood what it was had just been biding his time, waiting for the right opportunity to strike back at them. And Tony had not held anything back when he'd informed Fury how unhappy he was about it.
"And… how's the kid doing in all of this?"
"Yeah, right," Peter said warily. "Nice try, Dad, but you're not fooling me."
Stifling a groan, Steve lays back down, trying to ignore the fact that the floor now feels as cold as the Arctic ice where SHIELD found him.  He suppresses another shiver as he rolls onto his side, curling into a tight ball.
But Phillips just pursed his lips, more angry than Tony had ever seen him.
"Oh, I really didn't," replied Sam, chuckling. "But that doesn't mean I'm not looking forward to that trip to Italy. Never been there, but heard it's pretty nice."
And while it wasn't exactly the future that Tony had envisioned for Peter, he and Steve had long-since decided that as long as their son was happy, that was really all that mattered.
—too long ago for him to even remember how long ago it'd been.
, but that last file had thrown him for such a loop that he felt just as pathetic and small as he sounded. It had just been he and Dad for so long before Papa suddenly showed up in the middle of that Afghanistan desert, but Peter loved him now as though he had been there for his entire life, and the thought of never seeing him again was just too much to even contemplate.
"Yeah, I actually saw Стиви a few times when he was sick in the hospital back then," said Uncle Bucky. "When he'd let me see him, at least. Стиви never liked too many people seeing him when he was sick, so most of the time he would refuse visitors."
“Save it, Steve,” Tony shoots back as he gets to his feet.  “You’re right.  I should go and look for supplies.”
Because, as Tony had pointed out, getting up there was fairly easy. It was the coming back down that was the tricky part.
Well, except Steve.
Then again, if Steve just happened to feel the same way, then maybe…
"Yeah, I know, but—"
"Very good, sir."
"Sorry dude, but those don't work on me anymore!" Peter said, finally managing to work his fingers underneath the sandman's foot, grunting as he tried to lift it off of him. Another sentry would be coming any second now, and—
"Oh, he will," Steve stated, his fingers tightening around Tony's hand. "It'll just take some time."
"Danvers!" James exclaimed, snapping his fingers. "I knew there was a reason why your name sounded so familiar." He turned to Steve. "She was reported missing in the late eighties, some kind of crash that was classified way above my pay grade at the time. Real hush-hush stuff."
“Yeah?”
Just like he'd been in Miami.
"Then whose fault is it?" Peter shrieked, jumping when his heart monitor started to beep. "We can't let my papa die up there, Uncle Bucky! We just can't! My dad—!"
going to tell you that this is not the time to try anything that I might consider out of the ordinary for a normal patrol, because all of you should be damn well smart enough to already know that. In addition, I should
Tony's belly gave a hard lurch. "Isn't that the same night as that party Pete went to?"
"Dad—"
"Steve—" Tony started, his eyebrows knitting together, but Steve cut him off.
"We'll also have the C-shift patrol pilots on backup support," Steve continued. "And as soon as Carol and I make it through the atmospheric barrier and into space, that's when Colonel Phillips will initiate the ground forces to surround General O'Brien's headquarters. He'll be supported from the air by the B-shift pilots, who'll be waiting inside their respective aircraft, ready to launch on his signal."
"Don't worry about me, Pete," Dad said with a dismissive wave. "I'll be fine."
"Just make sure you redesign that containment vessel and you should be fine, all right?" Grandpa cut in. "I'll look it over next time."
And judging from what he fears lays ahead, he's going to need every ounce of mental clarity he can get.
Tony had been forced to learn how to do it, he just got angry again.
"You don't have to explain yourself to me, Captain," interrupted Stacy. "While I'm not a superhero, I do at least understand the pressures that come with having a dangerous occupation. I just felt that you both would appreciate some candour in this matter."
he and Tony had said to each other as part of their wedding vows.
It wasn't helping that Tony had become aware of Steve's rather obvious distress almost immediately, and had since done his absolute best to tease him about it.
As soon as the final word was uttered Peter's eyes rolled back into his head and he went completely rigid on the bed, almost as though he was having a fit of some kind. Tony let out a frightened noise, taking one step towards him before Steve grabbed him around the waist, halting him.
"No, that's true, but—"
Steve smiled against Tony's neck, sending a bolt of pleasure down Tony's spine. "You're the genius, sweetheart. I'm sure you can figure it out."
He had almost been out of time, something that Steve had repeated to himself about a million times in the last few hours.
Nothing but the best for their little rich sweethearts, right?
that goes on here that I’m not entitled to stick my nose into.”
too sexy. "Everything okay?"
"Three shots targeting the same spot should do it."
"Master Peter is sleeping peacefully, Captain," answered JARVIS. "His vital signs are all within his normal parameters."
"Oops, I gotta go!" Liz said. "I'll see you guys tomorrow!"
Peter scoffed, rolling his eyes. "No, they said the car has to stay up at the Compound until I turn eighteen," he grumbled. "So I'll only get to drive it on the weekends."
"They got Loki's sceptre, Tony," Steve said firmly. He grabbed onto Tony's elbows, preventing him from escaping off the bed. "Whoever this was, if it was the Chitauri or someone else, they knew exactly where it was being held. Clint and Natasha said that the attack stopped after the two blasts, so the enemy knew exactly where to hit us. And then, probably while everyone else was busy scrambling around, they came down and took it."
But after what happened in the Games, is Steve really the best person to be trying to coach someone?  How does he know he wouldn't just screw the poor kid up?  Steve always thought he was pretty good at the technical dynamics part of swimming, always finding himself critiquing the other swimmers’ stroke techniques and explosiveness off the starting blocks when he was in high school and college.  But when it came down to it, even after identifying the minor issue in his own stroke that was causing his shoulder pain, neither Steve nor Phillips could seem to correct it enough to prevent the injury from getting worse.
"Thank you, Mr Stark," he said, offering the older man his hand. "Thank you for saving our son."
"Probably be easier for me to find you a beer," he grumbled. "Let me go see if there's any left in the Officer's conference room, yeah?"
"JARVIS, copy everything that you see in my HUD right now and send it to Pepper," Tony ordered, zooming in first on Peter's bruised and bleeding cheeks, then scanning across Steve's battered body as best as he could through the crowd of Avengers, police, and FBI agents. "Please also ask her if she wouldn't mind getting some preliminary media statements ready, but only with people she trusts. I wanna make sure the entire world knows what those assholes were doing here."
"Yeah, and given that all you super-types were just as affected as the rest of them, I'd say that means this thing must be pretty powerful," said Sam.
And then, after they were done eating, Tony led Steve over to the living room couch and took out his phone.
Gwen shot Peter a side eye, placing her hand on his knee under the table. "Well, I guess if whatever this thing is gives your mom some peace of mind, then it's probably fine. My mom has a police scanner in the house. It's what she listens to during the day, off and on. And my dad knows that he's supposed to check in with her at least three times during his shifts or else she starts to worry."
He did have a feeling, though, that even aside from the lost fuel, the damage was probably far worse than what Nebula suspected. Which meant that the only way they'd be able to make it out of Titan's atmosphere was if their luck happened to change.
Tony's breath hitched at JARVIS's reply, nostalgia hitting him like a missile right to the heart. "
"Okay, hon, but—"
The remainder of the presentation passed rather quickly, the pilots maintaining their rapturous attention as Tony ran through the rest of the X-302's systems, the anticipation inside the classroom so ripe that Tony could practically smell it.
"Thank you, sir. I just wanted an opportunity to serve my country, as my father did."
"Steve's temp is fine now, Tony," Bruce interrupted, quirking a sheepish eyebrow when Tony shot him a glare. "And Peter's almost there, shouldn't be too much longer, so… if Steve's feeling up to it, it's okay with me."
"Good morning there, Cap," Carol said, her helmet tucked under one arm. Her eyes flicked between Steve and Tony, a rather smug smile playing on her lips when she noticed the love bite on Tony's neck. "You two get any sleep last night?"
"Uh huh," Peter replied. "Thanks!"
"And you know there's no way any of us would survive it!" Steve exclaimed. "Tony, you didn't see Thanos when he snapped his fingers the first time, but I did! And it nearly killed him!"
But death doesn't discriminate between the sinners and the saints. It only takes, and takes, and takes…
Steve let out a frustrated growl, yanking his hand from Tony's grasp and jumping to his feet. He raked his hands through his hair, cringing at the scratch of his fingernails on his sensitive scalp.
"Mr Stark?" Stacy suddenly said over the comm. "I have Captain Rogers here, sir, he's been released from his cell."
"Thanos will have no shortage of people gunning for him," Gamora added. "We will not allow him to leave that battlefield alive."
"Stand down!" Dad ordered. "Final warning!"
"And they're right to say that," Steve said, his voice quivering. "I'm sure no one wants to see you get hurt."
"Yeah, well at least my dad doesn't hide me away every time he goes out of town," retorted Flash. "I mean, exactly how much school did you miss last year, little prince? Wasn't it like four months? That's almost half of the school year, and yet you still somehow managed to advance with the rest of the class. So… what. Did your dad have to bribe Principal Morita to let you continue on so you wouldn't be embarrassed or something?"
“Okay.”
"JARVIS, do me a favour and run another quick diagnostic on the interface for me, yeah?" Tony asked as he tapped some final commands into his monitor. Through the Hulk-proofed windows of Bruce's panic room he could see Steve sitting next to Bucky on the bed, talking to him while Bruce finished attaching a series of sensors to his chest and temples and Sam took his position over in the back corner. Clint, Natasha, and Thor were with him in the anteroom, standing off to the side of the monitors and ready with the emergency supply of Helen's super-sedative if things ended up going south.
Tony’s jaw was hard as iron as he nodded.  He needed to get the hell out of there before his resolve started to weaken.
“And it was ‘cause of an explosion, right?” Peter asked.  “The building his team was in was destroyed in an explosion?”
"My Uncle Bucky loves trivia, like me, so he helps me practise for Decathlon a lot," Peter explained. "That's one of the funnier gems that we came across earlier this week."
True to his word, Thanos didn't care who he killed in order to accomplish his goal. Just so long as he came out victorious.
"A fact I happened to notice, even though I'm the subject of those files," Steve said sharply. "That doesn't seem fair to me."
"No, I know it's not," he whispered. He leaned forward, pressing a firm kiss to her lips. "Gwen, I—I love you. I always have, I was just too afraid to say it out loud. But right now I need to go and help my dads, okay?"
"Yeah, we're not usually too big on plans," added Quill. He jerked his head towards Mr Clean—Drax, apparently—and Antennae Lady. "Not winging it isn't really what they do."
“Oh, you know I love to do it, my dear Anthony,” she says.  “But only until you find a wife, hmm?  Or a husband, you know that’s okay too.  Because a sweet, gorgeous man like yourself deserves to find someone to love him.  Don't you agree, my sweet Peter?”
A knot rose in Steve's throat. He had certainly seen his share of seemingly insurmountable odds over the course of his ninety-five—or was it thirty-one?—years. Born to a recently widowed mother, sickly from birth to the point where doctors warned his ma that he'd be dead before he was thirty, and then orphaned at eighteen, Steve had gotten used to overcoming odds by the time he was finally accepted into the Army.
Something about Tony's tone, a slight wobble in his voice, caught Steve's attention and he sat up, eyeing his husband warily.
😭 = I got you right in the feels
"All right, babe, all right," Tony said, softly sighing as he snuggled in even closer. "It's okay. We're okay. I love you."
Tony was quiet for several seconds, until Steve glanced towards him. "I know you love me, honey," he said quietly. He reached for Steve's hand, cradling it between his own. "But I also know what it's like to try and forget about some really shitty things in some not-so-healthy ways, and… I don't think the two necessarily have to be mutually exclusive. It's just… more convenient like this, and I've enabled you long enough. It's got to stop."
, and he was very,
"He has, Captain," JARVIS answered after a short pause. "And Mr Wilson did also inform Master Peter that he would be unable to maintain his confidence if they did not improve within a reasonable amount of time."
Steve's belly gave a hard swoop as Tony flew over an overpass and the lake came into view. Even in the dim light of the quarter moon Steve could see the huge chunks of ice bobbing in the water like miniature icebergs, and the ripples emanating out from a point in the near-centre, likely where Peter had been pulled underneath the surface.
"Well, then that right there makes a huge difference," Peter said. "If you're in the military all your medicines and stuff are paid for, but if you're not, then they're not. And that stuff's really expensive. My dad… he'll have to work pretty much forever to pay for all of mine."
Steve's eyes grew impossibly darker, and he ground his hips down against Tony's one final time before shifting them so he was sitting up on the bed, with Tony straddling his lap. Then he shuffled forward just enough so he could reach his bedside table, digging through the top drawer's contents until he found a bottle of lube. Tony's heart began to thud in anticipation as Steve popped open the cap, slicking up two of his fingers before pressing them gently inside him, swallowing Tony's groans of pleasure as he carefully worked him open. Normally Steve took his sweet time prepping Tony, often teasing him to the brink of madness before finally acquiescing to Tony's pleas that he was ready. But not on this night.
Thankfully, the kitchen was in the far back of the house, and the dulled-down noise combined with the sight of Gwen looking absolutely amazing was enough to instantly perk up Peter's spirits. The fact that her pretty face lit up as soon as he stepped into the room didn't hurt at all either.
"Should be," answered Dad, his fingers carding through Peter's hair. "Pete said he threw up pretty quick afterwards, so I'm hoping that some of it is gone already. The rest is just supportive care until he can metabolise it all."
"But Tony, I don't think destroying any one of the stones is gonna do any good," said Bruce. "Thanos doesn't even have them all yet, and he's still the most powerful being in the universe. The stones will just make it easier for him to do what he wants to do."
"Peter! Dinner's ready!"
Tony thought fondly.
"There, there," said the woman as his coughs finally subsided. She nudged Peter's bottom lip with the water glass. "Ready for a drink now?"
“It sure is, little guy, Steve said as he hugged Peter close.  Because it was.  Against all odds, Steve had not only managed to survive being frozen,
Sucking in another deep breath, Steve attempted to force his mind to concentrate on anything besides the terrifying groaning sound that was still increasing in volume.  It was now to the point where it was effectively blocking the rest of the natural noise of the woods, and that combined with the below-zero air and steadily increasing wind was enough to make Steve feel like he was literally frozen in place.
"Eh, it was okay," Peter said. He dropped his backpack onto the opposite couch, raking his fingers through his hair as the smell of garlic, tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese wafted down the hall from the kitchen. Papa must've made his famous homemade pizza for dinner.
"I need you, sweetheart," he whispered, desperate and needy as his shaking hands slid Tony's suit jacket from his shoulders, tossing it towards the chair in the corner. "Need you so badly."
"But it doesn't matter anymore," Peter cut in. "Now Dad's got you, and I get to have a papa."
Steve smiled, showing off the dimple that Tony was convinced could launch ships and start wars. "Thank you, sweetheart. I really appreciate it, and I know Bucky does too."
"It was for me," Uncle Bucky said. "Stevie, though, he just seemed to accept it. For him, it was normal."
he cried as he leapt towards Peter, tackling him to the floor and curling his body over him.  He could only vaguely make out Tony’s shouts of confusion as he tucked Peter’s head under his chest, holding his breath as he waited for the building to come crashing down on top of them.
Tossing his stuff onto a chair by the cool-down pool, Steve puts on his goggles and dives in, ignoring the now-annoying dull pain in his left shoulder as he takes a few long, easy strokes to cajole the lactic acid from his overworked muscles, his grin so wide it’s threatening to split his face.
The loud
"Yeah, a bit," Peter said with a wink. He had actually grown a lot since that first chess game they had played in the base hospital in Afghanistan where he and Dad were recovering, but aside from the cast on his foot and the ring on his finger, Papa hadn't hardly changed at all.
"Yeah, when he got really sick as a toddler. My grandpa gave it to him," Peter said in amazement. "Wow. You never forget anything, do you?"
said it was for the greater good, when in fact—
Peter pursed his lips, shaking his head. "I can't stop. Not until I know that Papa is coming home."
"Great!" said Steve. He stepped back three paces, nodding at Tony as he readied his shield. "Whenever you're ready, sweetheart."
The corners of Tony's lips curled into a smile. "Mmm, long as you don't expect me to just go to sleep."
T'Challa smiled, shaking his head. "My father may have been an isolationist, but he also taught me a very important lesson, which is to not listen to what people say, but to watch what they do. And what I have seen from you and your team, Captain, has proven to me that you are trustworthy."
"Ahh, yeah. Or at least I hope I can," Scott said. He clasped his hands together, shifting nervously.
He found his two boys and Thor already seated around the kitchen table, with an already filled plate and a fresh cup of coffee at his place next to Steve. Tony planted a quick kiss on his husband's cheek before sliding into his chair, ignoring Peter's wrinkled nose as he took a big gulp of the coffee.
"I hope it's okay that I told her she could get some rest," he said as he gestured towards Gwen, who was curled up on Steve's chair, sound asleep with her hand still clutching Peter's. "She's pretty wiped out from everything."
"Not sure how you expect me to say no to that, you big tease," Tony whispered as Steve took his hand, intertwining their fingers.
I know we didn't hear too much from Peter in this chapter, and I do apologise for that. The next chapter will open with his POV and I do believe the wait will be worth it. :)
“Yeah, it sure looks that way,” Tony said, his shoulders sagging in relief.  “Yay me.”
"Orders? What in the goddamn hell are you talking about? Who's orders?"
"I told you,
Part of the whole ‘Stark men are made of iron’ thing, according to Peter.
"Nah, they're just being paranoid, as usual," Peter said. He frowned as he studied the board, finally moving his left-side bishop. "They tend to get worse when they're away."
"Such as two other civilian scientists who supposedly died in lab accidents," Tony said. "Bruce Banner and Reed Richards."
“I’m on my way, Mr Stark.  I’ll call when I get to New York.”

With a single nod, Steve pressed a kiss to Peter's temple. "Peter, Dad and I are just gonna go and stand in the back of the room so Uncle Bucky can sit with you, okay? He's—it'll be better for you with him here. All right?"
Steve frowned slightly as he ran through the calculations Tony had taught them for predicting the go/no-go point. "But the power source wouldn't really matter while we're in orbit anyway, isn't that right, Mr Stark?" he said. "Since the orbits are being maintained by the planet's gravity and not the aircraft's power source, then—"
“Oh, nothing too exciting,” Steve says.  “Just an appointment that I have later today.”
"I know," Steve rasped, the hot stream of water only exacerbating the burn in his cheeks that he very much hoped Bucky couldn't see.
"All right, we have a go!" Howard called out to the technicians. Steve gulped as people started criss-crossing the room, completing their last-minute preparations. After a final double-check of his ventilator settings, Sharon stepped back from Peter's side, giving Steve an affirmative nod.
"Yeah, I guess," said Ned. "It doesn't help that the thing's going for over five thousand dollars though. Something tells me that's a bit more expensive than a police scanner."
"Oh God," Steve gasped as his belly gave a violent swoop. "Nat, did Fury send anyone down to search the vault yet?"
"Ah, yep," said Peter. "Can't wait."
“Oh, I highly doubt that,” Tony said firmly.  “Especially if it’s going to ‘change modern warfare as we know it’, like you always say.”
But pilots didn't get flustered, did they? Weren't they always bragging about how nothing ever fazed them? That they could scale the edge of a mountain close enough to distinguish the different colours of the rocks or stare down the tip of an approaching Meridian Class-III anti-aircraft missile and not even break a sweat?
"Right away, sir."
"Well, yeah, you may have a point there, but—"
"Phoenix One and Two, you guys still doing okay?" he asked. "Not running into anything weird?"
Steve nodded as he took another step, biting down hard on his bottom lip to keep from crying out as the three of them slowly made their way towards Colonel Rhodes' car. He felt absolutely useless as Tony helped him inside, fastening his safety belt and cradling his damaged hands as Rhodes drove towards the hospital.
"Try not to worry too much," Ma said as she walked Steve and Tony to the door. "The boy will be just fine."
, no matter how much you wish it was."
"Mmm. 'Cause he just had to wait for them outside again, didn't he?" Tony had been afraid that would happen since Steve had left a few minutes late to pick him up, trying to wait for Tony to finish his conference call. When it became clear that it wasn't going to happen, Steve had asked Thor to accompany him instead, something that Thor was only too happy to oblige, as he'd put it. Thor and Peter had been spending quite a bit of time together since Peter's recovery from the water monster attack, with Peter teaching him how to play chess and introducing him to hockey, a game Thor had already grown particularly fond of due to all of the in-game fights.
“I believe that to be a safe assumption, sir.”
"Well, sometimes things don't quite go as you planned during a battle,
"Which is why I said you should make it one millimetre thicker," added Grandpa. "This'll only work if the vessel is thicker, otherwise it's too high a risk."
The planet was going to be saved and Dad was going to be okay. The two goals that Peter had set out to accomplish before he ran out of time were, at least for the moment, both going to happen.
Tony had fallen for it. Hook, line, and sinker.
"I know," Steve answered. "But at this point it's almost like a train wreck. I can't seem to look away."
"Yeah, that and the sceptre," answered Steve. "We've had the sceptre in our possession since the Miami battle, but they could've used it on Smythe before then or just used the drug. Are we sure that all of the drug has been destroyed now?"
"Mmm. Probably about time to pull out your heated undershirts, don't ya think?" said Dad. "Don't need you to be shivering out of your skin while you're at school."
"Looks like we're gonna be up to Hufflepuff5 soon," he murmured into his polar bear's neck. "And probably even more than that."
"Peter!" Dad cried, his right foot planted firmly on the chest of a huge bald guy who was covered in weird tattoos. Dad's bottom lip was trembling, his face the same horrible ashen color that it'd been when he finally found Papa in the HYDRA bunker in Georgia, while Peter's knees were shaking so badly he was surprised he was still upright. With his arms firmly pinned to his sides, even if he could've tried to flip out of the guy's hold he likely wouldn't be able to get the blaster out of the way first, and while Peter knew that Dad's nanotechnology was as top-notch as it could get, he still wasn't sure if his mask would be able to withstand a point-blank shot from the guy's blaster.
"Mitchell here," replied Cam.
"I didn't come in a ship," Carol said, shrugging. "I just flew."
Including his bank account.  Thanks to Steve’s naïvete, Brock was able to drain it almost dry before he finally left, leaving Steve with a dying mother, a massive pile of bills that was growing bigger by the day, and no way to pay for anything.
Tears pricked Steve's eyes at the memory, of how sweet they had looked, and how envious he had been. He had already been trying to deny it by then, trying to bury deep down just how deeply attached he was to them both, and, based on what Tony told him later on, doing a very poor job of it.
And if by some godawful chance they actually were to succeed… especially if they were to use some of the stolen Chitauri tech that still had yet to be recovered, then…
Steve's heart gave a painful lurch. Now was not the time to be thinking about Riley, and his baby son who would be growing up without a father.
“Yeah, I’ve been wanting to come in here ever since I saw the flyer on the lamppost by my school,” said Peter.  “I love bookstores!”
"Why's it always gotta be him?" Tony lamented as Steve removed the comm piece from his ear. "It's almost like he does it on purpose!"
But Thanos didn't answer. He simply raised the gauntlet, which was smoking, like it'd been burned onto his arm, and disappeared through one of his portals. Steve groaned, panting for breath as he pushed himself up to his feet, his legs screaming for mercy as he forced them to bear his weight.
and I'm pretty sure it doesn't work on spaceships!"
"Yeah, me too," Tony said softly. He smiled then, his beautiful brown eyes flicking to the white star on the middle of Steve's chest. "So? You can't leave me hanging like this, honey! What'd you think?"
"Which brings us back to Wakanda," said Steve. "If we all assemble down there, then we'll have the full fighting force of King T'Challa's warriors to back us up, and we'll be able to better defend both stones if they're in the same place."
And now that it was gone, Steve made sure to lavish just as much attention to the scars that had taken its place, the raised constellation of skin that covered Tony's healthy, beating heart, the very same heart that he had given to Steve so freely and completely, and that Steve cherished more than his own life.
Steve smiled, clapping Bucky on the shoulder. "I promise."
Too bad his high only tended to last about three or so minutes before he was onto the next thing.
"Yeah, I think we're all looking forward to it," said Steve. "It'll be good for the team to decompress a bit."
Davis gave a rather doubtful nod. "I see. So you have no information as to the current whereabouts of the Winter Soldier?"
"Yeah," Steve whispered, no longer able to stop the tears snaking their way down his cheeks. At James's encouraging nudge, Steve swiped at his nose and looked down at his feet, willing them to take the steps necessary to get himself back onto the jet.
"Hopefully not that deep or he'll still be sitting here in the morning," said Bucky. He punched Steve on the arm, playfully, but still hard enough for Steve to grunt. "See ya."
"'Night."
Tapping the case twice with his fingertips, Tony stood perfectly still as the nanites emerged, easing across his chest and down his arms like hot syrup spreading over a stack of Steve's homemade pancakes. They were warm, with just the slightest of tingling sensations as they formed Tony's helmet and facemask, finally closing over his fingers and toes. Once he was fully encased, he looked down, giving his feet an experimental wiggle. From what he could tell, everything looked good.
"How can you say that it's no big deal when you can barely breathe and you've completely sweated through your clothes?" Steve asked. "Sweetheart, please, just let me get you checked out! There's no telling what the arc reactor might've done to your lungs, and—"
Because he wasn't, damnit. In his mind, he had already proven multiple times that he could be just as much of a real Avengers teammate as the twins were, if only his dads would give him the chance. Aside from the programming and coding expertise that allowed him to do things like discover the location of HYDRA's invisible bunker, he was doing awesome during the team's weekend training sessions, and even managed to web Papa to the ceiling of the Compound's three-story training dome a couple weeks ago, forcing Dad to have to retrieve him. And yet, every single time Peter even attempted to suggest that he was ready for more, he was immediately shot down.
"Well, we've already seen that HYDRA can mess with people's memories, right?" said Clint. "With that drug?"
Steve huffed, biting back his sharp retort just before it could leave his lips. It wasn't helping that up until about a week ago he had thought the very same thing, and the shame of it was almost overwhelming.
"His lungs are almost completely clear now, Captain, just as I hoped they would be," she said. "We just needed to give his body a bit of time to heal itself."
"Please," Steve rasped as he broke away from Tony's lips, trailing kisses down his jaw to his neck. "Sweetheart,
"C-copy that," Steve managed. Clint was still alive.
"We're okay, Peter," said Steve. "You don't need to worry about us."
"Oh, definitely," agreed Peter. "Papa could probably command a bunch of rocks to come to life and they'd do it."
And then Tony, who Steve had been forced to wake in order to quickly go over all of Thor's new information. Like Peter, he had tried hard to hide how frightened he was, and it had nearly cracked Steve's heart right down the middle to have had to leave him right after delivering that kind of news, knowing full well that Tony would make a beeline right to his lab as soon as the Quinjet took off.
"I love you too, honey. Now,
"I don't know, Peter," Gwen said with a sigh. She tightened the strap of her backpack, her green eyes troubled. "I'm just… trying to keep my options open at the moment. It's nothing personal—"
"Well, that was pretty nerve-wracking," Steve said once he'd climbed out. "You were right about the go/no-go point being the most difficult part of the mission."
"Me too, bud," Tony said as he kissed his son's forehead. "But try and have some fun anyway, yeah? You know Papa would want that."
cups of coffee.
Or simply stare at each other and sheepishly grin, which was what they had been doing before Ned's latest silly question."
"Whew! Crisis averted." Tony pecked him one final time, then stepped into his armour and grabbed Steve's waist. "Shall we, babe?"
"But Uncle Thor told us that some of his people left the Reality Stone on Knowhere," said Peter. "So if he went there, then maybe—"
Over the last four years, Steve had managed to work his way into Tony's very soul, taking his place right next to Peter. And to lose either of them would completely destroy him.
"No, but Pete's pretty much on a whole other level," said Tony. "He's… something else." He paused, contemplating his next question. "You said the serum procedure hurt?"
An indeterminable amount of time passed. With no windows in his cell Steve had no idea if it was day or night, only adding to his overall disconcertedness. He made an attempt to use his heart rate and respiratory rate as a way of keeping time, but quickly realised that his mind was so muddled from pain, hunger, and dehydration that he couldn't seem to count to anything higher than twenty without dozing off into a sort of semi-sleep, snapping awake again every time the pain crescendoed.
“Yeah, that sounds about right,” Tony cut in.  February was when Tony had discovered that Regina had been sending proprietary information from Stark Industries to Justin Hammer, unleashing such a massive deluge of shit that it ended up nearly burying him alive.
“It’s okay, honey, you're okay,” he whispered.  “I’m right here, and I've got you.  You're safe.”
“Very good, sir,” JARVIS replied.  A second later, the glowing blue Jericho hologram appeared.  Tony picked up his coffee cup as the simulation began, watching Obie’s face as it ran.
The room went silent for a moment, with Steve’s jaw sharp enough to cut glass and his hand trembling in Tony’s.
"Okay, so maybe destruction's not the direction we try and take," said Bruce. "Like Tony implied with his testimonial about the arc reactor, maybe the way to go is to try and somehow repel the effects of the stones."
"Okay. Now, see the problem?"
“Okay, okay, okay, it’s okay,” Dad soothed.  “It’s okay, honey, we can just stop for now, yeah?  We can always try again later—”
"Mine couldn't stand him," Ma finished. She curled her bent fingers around Steve's arm. "And they were wrong. Just like I was."
"Thanks, Dad!" Peter said with a grin. "I'll see you guys later!"
"Mmm. Maybe," Tony replied, moaning again when Steve's fingers trailed down to the back of his neck and pressed harder. He slipped his hands underneath Steve's t-shirt again, tipping his head to press an open-mouthed kiss to the underside of Steve's jaw, smirking when Steve's breath hitched.
"Whatever signal it was sending finally crapped out," added Bruce.
“Yes, Pete, I promise,” Tony said.  “Just… try to be patient, yeah?  Steve and I have quite a bit to talk about, so it might be awhile.”
Dad reached for Papa's hand then, and Peter instinctively wrinkled his nose at the look Papa gave him, that sickly sweet, "I adore you beyond reason" look that he gave Dad at least a million times a day.
"Hope is always stronger than fear," Tony said out loud, his eyes trained on Steve's drawing. And he owed it to both Steve and to Peter to keep on hoping until all of the hope was gone.
Ned shrugged. "Some kind of signal scrambler thing-a-ma-jig. Apparently it's supposed to disrupt targeting signals if something's aiming at you. I tried to tell her that that's not really how that stuff works, and even if it was, if this is coming from those same aliens who attacked us before it probably wouldn't help anyway. But ever since she saw it she's been bugging my dad about it, which means we'll probably end up getting one."
“At your service, sir.”
know that," said Bucky. He shot Steve a rather sinister look. "Do ya, Стиви?"
"Six months…" Tony murmured. "And when was the last time that server was accessed?"
"More than worth it," Peter said firmly.
Tony gave a nod before taking another sip of his tea. "Great idea, babe."
"Well…" Tony trailed off as he glanced at Bruce, who simply shrugged. "Based on the many-worlds interpretation, we can't just jump into another universe and start messing around, but we could potentially take a peek into those other universes in order to find the exact way of how we can win."
"Oh God, Tony, I can't—"
“Wait!” Tony says, startling both Steve and Thor.  Then he cups Steve’s face in his hand, his eyes flicking from Steve’s lips to his eyes, and back to his lips.  “Honey, can I—?”
"I'm pretty sure I wasn't insinuating anything, sweetheart." Steve pressed another kiss to Tony's forehead, his fingers trailing lightly up and down Tony's bare side. "Sleep now. I know you're tired."
“Well, I'm sure he’s keeping them well-entertained,” Tony said.  He gave the papers a quick flip-through as they walked towards his office, nodding in appreciation once they reached the door.  “Let’s hope we won’t need Happy, but it’s good to have him there just in case.”
Obie and Killian had tried to convert Peter into a Winter Soldier using the Aminacin, but it didn't completely work. And when they finally realised that it wasn't working, that's when they pulled out—
“No, it’s not that so much either,” Steve cuts in.  “It’s not about who’s the smartest, it’s…”  He pauses, tugging on his scruffy chin whiskers as he remembers old Coach Phillips, and how most of his instruction seemed to make absolutely no sense at all, until it did.
“Ehh, I don't—I don't know—” Steve stammered, glancing over at Tony.  “I… um…”
"Shh, sweetheart," Steve murmured as he drew Tony into his arms, tucking his head under his chin. "That's the same exact thought I'm having right now. What if? What if we do all of this, if we dare to hope that—and then it just
“I’ll have it ready by next Monday, Mr Stark,” Pepper stated.  “You don't need to worry about it.”
Of course, Tony now realised that he had been an absolute fool to believe that it would just end like that.  That he’d been a complete idiot to not have guessed that when he didn't see neither hide nor hair of Obie for the entire rest of the day, it meant that Obie was up to something.
"Well, I can't say I'm too sorry for that," he said softly. "But, honey, there's still a lot more stuff that I've got to tell you, and—"
Steve's eyebrows shot up. "You mean the tesseract?"
"Tony," Steve murmured as they reached the building. He pulled open the door, stepping back to allow Tony to enter first. "Sweetheart, your mind's been whirring nonstop since we got back here yesterday. Are you sure this is still such a good idea?"
Two things that Steve had never dared to hope he would have, and now the two things that he wanted more than anything else.
“Hey there, big guy,” Tony murmured as he tucked Steve close, smoothing his sweat-dampened hair from his forehead.  “It’s okay, yeah?  I’ve got you.”
"I also know that when Thanos snapped his fingers, the effects rippled across the entire universe," added Carol.
Tony huffed, groaning at the pleasure already building deep inside his gut. He slid his hands down his husband's shoulders and upper chest to his gorgeous pectorals, grinning at Steve's hard shudder as he scraped his thumbnails across his nipples.
Changing into his favourite Hulk pyjamas, Peter brushed his teeth and climbed under his covers, making a very poor attempt at a smile when Papa knocked on his slightly cracked door.
"They're both charming," said Steve. "There was no way I could've resisted either of them. I was a goner pretty much from day one."
"There's no one that I trust more," Papa said as he touched Peter's cheek with his bandaged hand. "And what about you, little guy, are you doing okay?"
Now, though, they were gone, somewhere out in the vastness of space. And all he had left was their picture.
"Pardon me, Captain," JARVIS said softly a few minutes later. "But Sergeant Barnes and Mr Wilson are requesting access to the penthouse."
"JARVIS, the drone system is online, right?" Tony asked.
The last thing Tony needed now was an even heavier workload.
Tony shrugged. "Yeah, maybe. But I betcha my kid's seen more movies." Arming one of his shoulder missiles, Tony launched it through the ship's hull, the resulting vacuum blowing both the alien and the hunks of metal out into space. Less than a second later, Strange was yanked from his suspension as Peter leaped forward, launching his web at Strange's back just in time to keep him from disappearing into the nothingness. Tony immediately flew towards them, preparing to seal the hole as the new iron spider legs he'd built into Peter's suit activated, bracing him against the ship's hull so he could pull Strange back inside.
"Updates incorporated and diagnostic completed, sir," JARVIS said a few minutes later. "No problems noted."
"So he forces you to keep him company, is that what you're telling me?"
"And what if it is?" Sam asked. "Could that help explain the weird space thing that happened a few days ago?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"That's my boy." Tony glanced up at the clock on the wall, grimacing when he saw that it was already almost 1400. "I'm gonna try and get out of here in time to come by and see you, okay? But if I can't tonight then I'll for sure come tomorrow."
Clipping Steve's ID to the front of his shirt, Tony made his way swiftly towards the mess hall, handlamp in hand just in case the lights went out before he was able to get back. Being so close to curfew the mess hall was already closed for the evening, with only the cleaning crew still inside as Tony filled a bag with enough food for his own personal army, knowing that as he healed Steve's appetite would be even bigger than usual.
Well, except to find him a date.
"No, buddy,
Scott paused his frantic pacing, tilting his head up towards the ceiling. "Ahh… I'm actually not—I mean, I don't—I don't exactly know, so—"
"You're damn right he will," said Dad. "Papa never backs down from a fight, you know that. And from what Bucky's told me, he's been that way since he was younger than you."
"Huh?" Peter asked, confused. "No, he named me Peter. I named me Spider-Man. It's my superhero name, just like yours is Star-Lord."
"There's just too many of them!" Bruce yelped as he was brought down by another herd of war dogs, his metal arms and legs writhing in the dirt.
It felt as though an hour had passed by the time he had regained some semblance of feeling in his limbs, peeling his eyelids open to find Tony resting his chin in the curve of his hip, a very self-satisfied grin on his face.
"Oh yeah? Says who?" Bucky protested.
“That very well may be the case, Master Peter,” JARVIS said gently.  “However, I am afraid that I am finding nothing in that document that explicitly connects Mr Stane with the pseudonym Iron Monger.”
“The medal ceremony for the 100-metre freestyle will commence in thirty minutes,” the announcer concludes.
"Sleep well, Tony," Steve whispered. "I love you."
All of which were completely theoretical, since not even General O'Brien was brave enough to actually attempt to use the thing. Not even for testing purposes.
that was a whole new level of horror, and Steve just wanted it
"They are?" Tony said with a worried glance towards the clock. It was only around ten; the dance wasn't supposed to be over for another couple hours. "Is Pete with them?"
I'm pretty sure that won't go over very well with Falcon," Tony rushed out. He let out a loud moan as Steve wrapped his lips around the tip of his cock, grabbing onto Steve's soaking wet hair. "Steve, baby,
🐰 = it’s so fluffy!
"Tony!" Steve tried to shout as the sparkling bolts of coloured energy began flowing up and down Tony's arm, extending across the right half of his chest and up to his neck. But his cry jammed in his throat, firmly held in place by his heart, which felt like it had been transformed into a solid block of ice.
Tony gave a quick nod. "Yeah, bud, I'm fine."
He may as well take some of the wealth that Dad so voraciously protected and try and do something good with it.
And the dry, dust-filled air on Titan was only making it worse.
"This is more of a diplomatic meet-up than a real mission, Pete," Tony added. "Papa probably won't even have to get his new uniform dirty. And with the new locator chips, you and I will be able to listen in and keep tabs on him anytime we want."
"Yeah. The Quantum Realm," Scott said as he fiddled with the cap to his water bottle. "Okay, so… however many months ago when… well, you know—"
"And once, and once, and once," Tony cut in. "Honey, can you even hear yourself? And I thought I held the title for the best excuse-maker on the team, and you know I don't usually like to admit stuff like that."
Tony's heart fluttered. The restaurant in question was not cheap by any standards, and to add a fifty percent tip on top of the cost was…
“Okay, so… try and pretend that this is the same thing,” said Peter.  “Pretend that the first time you left D.C., you closed the door tight.  But now, this time you're gonna leave it open just enough to let Uncle Sam and Uncle Bucky know they can still check on you.  Does that make any sense?”
"All right, that's a good start," said Sam. "Now, what exactly are you scared of?"
"Exactly. And Peter will come around eventually. Deep down he knows that we love him and want what's best for him. He's just got such a big heart, all he wants is to help people."
"Okay, and…?" Steve reached for Tony's hand, cradling it gently. "Sweetheart?"
“That is correct, sir.  The exact count is eighteen thousand, four hundred, and ten.”
he muttered, cursing when he realised he’d left his coffee cup sitting on Obie’s desk.  “JARVIS?”
“Comes with the territory, bud, you know that already,” Tony said with a smirk.  “Have a good day.  I love you.”
And even if
the way you were looking at Mr Rogers today.”
If JARVIS actually had a head.
"Hey," Papa whispered, his worry wrinkle deepening. "What's on your mind?"
sketchbook—and show Tony an absolutely drop-dead-beautiful drawing of that very same cabin, complete with a fully-stocked fishing boat out on the lake that held himself and Peter, with Tony standing by the house waving at them as they motored away.
And Tony was so, so grateful for Sam. Like Rhodey had been for Tony all those years ago, and still was on occasion, Sam was a beacon for Steve, helping him navigate through the troubled waters of years and years of suppressed trauma.
He was a lot like Tony that way. And Peter, for that matter.
"Tony, I think we should table this for tomorrow," Papa said, shooting Dad a rather pointed look. "Right now I think we should get Peter into his room with some heating pads and some hot chocolate and just let him rest, okay?"
“Damn!” he said, running his tongue across his plush bottom lip.  “Pardon me for saying so, but you make that uniform look good!”
Steve gave his head a quick shake. "I wasn't informed of the exact process by which Dr Erskine arrived at his decision, sir, only that he did."
“You just tried to hide it from me.  Again,” Peter finished.  He swiped at his nose as he sat up, his brown eyes still glassy.  “I just worry about you, Dad.  It’s not healthy for you to stay up like that all the time, and drink so much coffee, and—”
“Hey, hot stuff, there’s no need to be thinking like that,” Tony said soothingly.  “Aren’t you the one who’s always saying it’s never good to dwell on the ‘what ifs’?”
"Oh. Well, that kinda sucks," said Ned. He blinked as the blonde girl entered the classroom, sitting down in the center seat in the front row as the rest of the class filtered in.
"Shh, babe, it's okay. I've got you," Tony whispered, brushing his fingertips across Steve's lips. He tugged Steve's t-shirt free, then settled himself over him again, grinding his hips down so deliciously that Steve moaned. "Tell me what you want, hot stuff."
"No thank you, JARVIS, I'm okay," answered Steve. He scrubbed at his eyes with his palms, sucking in a deep, shaky breath. "I'm just… where's Tony?"
"And that someone was you, Mr Stark?"
"Uhh, from Gwen," Peter stammered, gulping. "She told me not too long after Liz's dad got arrested that her dad had a friend that worked for the FBI, and whoever it was told Mr Stacy that they were moving Mr Toomes to some facility that you could only get to with a helicopter."
But now…
As it turned out, he had only managed to get through one more when the elevator doors slid open to reveal Tony, his face impassive but his eyes broiling with such concern it was as though they were broadcasting it through a megaphone. Tony had never been able to hide his emotional state from Steve. No matter how stoic he was able to keep his expression, his eyes always gave him away. Even looking at Tony's photograph in his SHIELD file before Steve had met him for the first time, he'd been able to read Tony's eyes.
Steve gave a nod, swiping his wet cheeks across the sleeve of his t-shirt. "Yeah, I know. But knowing that doesn't seem to help much, 'cause it just
"Oof," Peter said. "And she was the goddess of death?"
you?” Tony sputtered.  “I mean, he just came out and said that he’s—?”
Or at least, he thought so. But in the three or so seconds that it took for him to step back from the window, somehow an entire army of the same kind of sentry suits that had been circling the perimeter of the prison had assembled in the corridor outside of Peter's cell, with Justin Hammer standing at the forefront, looking on like a proud father.
"Yeah, I figured as much," replied Sam as he began another of his strafing runs. "I'm gonna hold you to that."
“It’s just some father who wants to meet with me about coaching his kid in swimming,” Steve says quickly.  “Nothing more than that.”
“So, I take it you found something extraordinary?” Dad asked once Peter had fastened his seatbelt.
"Sooo… then you did have a fight?" asked Peter.
"But you are right, Stark is damn hot. And he seems to know what he's talking about too, which is good since he's a civvy and all," continued Bucky. He tugged on Steve's arm as they stepped into the hangar, pulling him off to the side. "But Steve, he is a Stark, right? I mean, you haven't forgotten what that means, have you?"
Peter could tell that Dad was just as rattled by all of this as Papa, but was trying very hard to not give into it, as he'd been doing pretty much ever since the attack at the lake up at the Compound. Papa had been struggling so hard for so long, and while he had been getting a bit better lately, mostly due to Uncle Sam's help, it seemed to be at a snail's pace, and Peter knew that Dad was trying everything humanly possible to avoid adding to Papa's stress.
Following Carol's lead, Steve launched into a series of barrel rolls and short dives, acclimatising to the stick's sensitivity as the aircraft manoeuvred through the air as though it weighed practically nothing. As soon as he felt comfortable with the stick he gritted his teeth and aimed the aircraft forward, directly towards the DMZ line that marked the border of Langaran airspace.
For a moment, Steve was too stunned to even speak, his eyes wide in disbelief. Out of all of the odd things he'd seen in his lifetime—
"I'll make sure that she's careful, Captain," Stacy said as Gwen carefully took Peter's hand. "She just wanted to check on him for a bit."
They would crush him.
"Yeah." Steve had heard that story before as well, although not exactly the reason why. "I'd still appreciate yours though," he said softly. "And I know Tony would too."
“Oh?  What’d you find?” Steve asks, because he actually googled Tony last night too.  And what he found only made his curiosity spike.
Gwen smiled, sending a bolt of warmth down Peter's spine. So far, aside from a few rather stern side-eyes from Chief Stacy on the way to Gwen's house, there hadn't been all that much awkwardness between them. Peter didn't even feel the need to be constantly talking, which he often tended to do when he was especially nervous.
Hurrying into the officers' locker room, Steve dumped his bat into the trash bin and headed straight for the showers, turning up the water as hot as he could tolerate in the hopes it could somehow burn away the uneasiness that had been slowly trying to consume him from the inside out.
"I will, sir. Thank you." Steve couldn't imagine why Ma would give a damn about General O'Brien's well wishes, but he supposed that was a conversation better suited for another time.
She rocked back in her chair.  “Duck.”
“What the fuck is this day?” Trip said, leaning an elbow on her lectern.  “Follow me.”
“Sir, so sorry to interrupt,” Jarvis said.  “But Agent Coulson has a question about the bomb.”
“You’re going to end up eating her grapes,” Shawn said.  Harris made a face, and Shawn patted him gently on the back.  “They look okay.  I’m going to hit the salad bar.”
"I think it's less 'he's a threat' and more 'his secret super power is making you feel bad about doing bad things,'" Jesse said.
Laughing, Steve made a break for the door.  “Comeuppance!”
Steve didn’t look up.  “It’s a free country,” he said, and because that was rude, and Jarvis didn’t deserve it, he tried again.  “And it’s more your house than mine, Jarvis.”  He opened another drawer in the dresser, collecting the few pieces of clothing he’d stowed there.
DJ’s fingers picked at a loose thread of the blanket.  His head was down, his eyes focused on his fingers.  “All right?” he asked, his voice small.
"Are congratulations in order?  Or am I murdering you?"
"You might be a bit too honest to be a New York City Police Officer," she said, her head tipped in his direction.
Sue let out a soft chuckle.  “I don't believe that at all, Captain America, but thank you anyway.”
“Me, too, what?” Stark asked him, flipping the suitcase suit around and snagging the handle.  DJ took hold of it with both hands and tugged it away from him.  Amused, Stark let him take it.  “You want to be my valet?  Sure, we can work with that.”
Hank made a face.  “Ben’s been here since dawn,” he said, his voice dire.
“Cat hats,” Tony said, sipping his cocoa.  “Are we…  Talking about hats with, you know, cat ears?”
Stark tapped a finger against his lips.  “Might be more than one,” he admitted.  “But if it's more than one, I'll let you destroy something.”
Phil felt all amusement die.  “Why is it obvious?”
“How are you so bad at this?”
It took him a moment to realize what he was seeing.
“DJ’s Strange,” Phil said.  “Looking for DJ.  And he wasn’t alone.”
She straightened up.  “Good.”
He could hear them now, questions being called from all directions, and he was a pro at ignoring the stupid ones, the ones that were just trying to get a rise out of him.  But a few, cherrypicked from the horde, were just what he wanted.  He focused on those, not caring who was asking.  The question was all that mattered.
Steve started to type, then stopped.  ‘I’m a terrible friend, so you can choose.’
Tony nodded.  “You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.”
Darcy leaned forward.  “Can you hack them?”
Steve gave up and shut the door.  “Still have the one that Erskine gave me, actually.”  He considered the bakery bag.  “That for me?”
“Yes,” Tony said, and it sounded so petulant that Steve nearly burst out laughing.  Instead, he found himself moving towards the bed.  Tony looked up at him.  “That is absolutely-”
DJ was grinning now, his eyes bright.  "Okay."
DJ blinked at him. “Stock market,” he said.
DJ didn’t even have time to fire the repulsors.  Before he even realized he was back in something resembling reality, he was already crashing into it.  The next few seconds was chaos, as he hit, and bounced, and hit again, his arms flailing as he tried to slow himself down.
“Luckily, today my usual fee has been severely reduced,” Natasha said, looking over the plates and trays that littered the tabletop and cabinet, a covetous look flicking over her face.  “Chocolate croissant, please.”
Drew took a long drink from his soda, his eyes narrowed in consideration.  “No,” he said at last.
“Tell me they're not going to do that again,” Clint said.  “C'mon.  Doesn't New York have enough problems?”
“Bitchin’,” Jess said.  She paused.  “What am I handling?”
Rhodey took one with a pleased grin. “How did you learn?”
“Don’t worry.  He really doesn’t like me, either.” Rogers glanced over the top of the car towards DJ, who was humming away, his hands planted firmly on his ears.  Clint gave them a thumbs up, and Rogers turned back to Iron Man.  “Can I see your face?” he asked, his voice quiet.
Tony took the photo out of Steve’s hand.  “Let’s go. My bed or yours?”
“Yeah.  I’m fine.  Why do you ask?”
“How do I make you stop?” Tony said, reaching into his pocket and pulling out his credit card.  “How do I make all of this stop?”
The photographer who'd shouted the question now found himself somehow alone in the middle of the press corral.  Despite the fact that there was no where to go, and no extra space, somehow, everyone had found a way to edge away from him, leaving him very exposed and very obvious.  He blustered on anyway.  "Well, some people do worry that, what with his history-"
Shuri slid down, catching her horse’s bridle and following Okoye’s lead.  She hopped up onto the stone wall, and her horse nudged against her hands.  Laughing, Shuri stroked a hand over the horse’s nose, smoothing the dappled gray fur under her fingers.  “Fine.” She leaned forward, pressing a kiss to the horse’s forehead.  “You need to eat, don’t you, my darling?”
Stung despite himself, Steve slipped his watch back into his pocket.  “Of course, I’m sorry to have-”
Steve grinned as Clint did something approaching a soft shoe with one foot and a hop with the other.  Whatever it was.  He made it look good.
Steve winced.  “I don't think he's feeling 100% this morning,” he said.  “I'm going to make him some oatmeal and toast, see if that helps.”
Steve set his paper aside without being told.  “Just old stories.  And the old rules.”
Steve kissed him, and that was about the best reaction he could’ve hoped for.  Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s shoulders, kissing him back with all the force he could manage.  Steve mumbled something against his mouth, and Tony pulled away.  “What?”
Tony smiled.  “I guess I did.”  He set a piece down, the base clicking against the board.  “Discover check.”
“It’d certainly get his attention. Talk to you soon.”
“Yeah.”  Tony nodded.  “Burning your couch, though.”
He managed a smile for her. “Well, I kind of forced him into that, so, I think it's only right that I let him walk away from it without any other pressure, Jan.”
Jesse did not seem impressed.  “Are we-”
“Well, yes, you set this up, you-” Tony waved a hand back at the soundstage. “This certainly wasn't my idea, buster, and now we're going to be dealing with press requests for the next year or so, really, what was that, that was just-”
Everyone looked at DJ.  “I’m cursed,” he said.  He shrugged.  “It’s okay.  I like it.”
“Right.  I’m behaving.  I’m totally behaving.  I don’t want a dog,” Peter said, and Tony gave him a disbelieving look.  His mouth worked.  “All right, I do, I do want a dog, but that’s not what this is about.”
“The hot tub,” Carol said, and Steve gave a full body wince.  “Yeah.  Anyway, they found a place that usually does restaurant wholesale for like, cruise ships, a place that sold Jell-O powder in fifty pound boxes, and-”
DJ finished applying a thin layer of frosting to the gingerbread man before he looked up.  “Yes,” he said, and Phil nodded.
Steve ignored him. “I will be pissed,” he said. He leaned in, bracing his hands on the conference table between them. “So we will get through this, and I'm going to have a good hard look at any press release Marcy comes up with before it goes out, and when it's all over, I am still going to need you to be my friend.”
Steve didn't understand a word of it, but at least it was actually French.
He reached out, his fingertip ghosting over the tip of DJ’s nose.  “They’ll believe you are doing everything you can, and sometimes, it’s just…”  His voice trailed away.
“I introduced him to the lava lamp booth,” Darcy said, pointing.  “Did you find anything?”
Before he could lose his mind, or whatever was left of his morals, enough to do it, Steve moved.  He pushed himself up, and extended a hand to Tony.  Tony took a breath, and let it out.  “You're a thief, Rogers,” he said, taking Steve's hand and letting Steve pull him up.  “A dirty thief.”
“Sorry,” Sue called, her feet moving quickly over the polished marble.  “Johnny's got a thing, and Reed thought it was best if we didn't come alone, so...”
“Depends,” he said, even as he steered Callie towards the nearest wall, where he could give them both a measure of protection.  “How much trouble am I in?”
Natasha sprinted by, a man right behind her. She swung to the side, one leg lashing out and catching him in the knees.  Her hand snapped out, and he was unconscious before he hit the ground.  “Need help?” she asked.  She didn't even sound out of breath.
“Don’t try me, I’ll do it,” Tony said, over the general cries of distress  There was a shuffling sound of the phone being handed over.  “Shut up, all of you!  It’s my car, I’ll talk about my dick if I want to!”
“I already regret it!” Tony called after her, because he wanted the last word, even if the last word made no sense.  Jan gave him a little wave over her shoulder, and disappeared back through the door.  Tony crossed his arms over his chest.  “That could've gone better,” he said to Steve.
“Never known you to do things by half measure, so I’m gonna believe that,” Bucky said, reaching for his mug.  “So you’ve got a hut…”
“Yes,” DJ said, very firm about that.
“He's definitely got a cold, probably got the flu,” Steve said.  He glanced towards Tony, who stuck his tongue out in Steve's general direction.  Steve smiled, feeling better already.  “News travels fast.”
“That would be me,” Jan said, holding up one hand at shoulder level.  Her eyes fluttered at a dangerous rate.  “Do you have a problem with my choices, Mr. Wilson?”
Tony wasn't sure he'd know.  But he also wasn't sure cared anymore.  “You want to help me?” he asked, and she nodded.  “Good.  Roll down the window so I can toss these.”
There was the sound of a scuffle, and then the woman’s voice again.  “Hey, it’s Carol,” she said.  “We’re in the SUV.  Tony’s driving, Rhodey’s riding shotgun, Peter’s on time out in between me and Jess, and Clint’s in the trunk.”
Steve studied the envelope.  “Or really doesn't,” he said.
"He thinks he is," Steve said, catching the boy by the collar of his shirt. "Okay. That's enough, Romeo."
Steve stumbled over the threshold, and just like that, he was in Tony's bedroom.  He blinked, his eyes darting around the room.  It was shiny and chic, all smooth metal and polished dark surfaces.  There were floor to ceiling windows circling around the majority of the space, revealing a stunning view of the city skyline.  There were only a few pieces of furniture, other than the large bed, bedside tables and a chair placed facing the windows.  The bed itself was piled with pillows and tumbled blankets.  The lighting was recessed, throwing a warm glow over the gleaming glass topped desk and table.
As impromptu photo ops went, it was pretty harmless.   A half a dozen photographers, all from highly reputable publications, were doing their best to get a few usable candid shots without getting in anyone's way.   Steve wasn't playing along, his head down, his body language tense, and they were giving him a wide berth.  Even Bruce was giving them more to work with, and they knew it.
Tony took a deep breath.  “Why do I have a bandage on my shoulder?”
“I’m going to get you flowers,” Greer called towards the pantry.  “What’s your favorite?”
Greer flipped through her pages, her long nails tapping against the tabletop.  “When will we be setting up?”
Steve held up the pocket watch..  “My watch.  It’s not working.”
“Perhaps,” Jarvis allowed.  “Miss Potts did insist we contact him.”  He poured another cup of water.  “I am of the opinion that the wellbeing of the company could wait until tomorrow.”
Peter blinked again.  “Where he lives?”
“See?” Tony asked.
A gentle hand touched his head, and he went still.  “Whatever small part I had in the man you have become,” Jarvis said, soft, so soft, “I am prouder of that, then anything else I have ever done in my life.”
“Yes,” Steve said, rubbing a hand up and down Tony's back. He was learning the lines of Tony's body, the hard ridges of his spine and the arch of his ribs. He hated the scars, every one he found, every white line and pucker of the skin. But it was Tony, and Tony was everything he'd ever wanted. “Just a little bit.”
“Possibly.”  She waited for a moment.  “Are you drunk now?”
"Oh, aren't we just full of opinions today?” Stark said.  He clapped, sharp and quick.  “Parker!  Paper!”
Before he could reach the top stair, the doors opened.  Jarvis was back lit against the vestibule, his expression hidden in the shadows.  “Officer Rogers.  I’m pleased you’ve returned.”
“You do,” DJ said.  “All the time.”
“Know.”
Steve caught his shoulder, supporting him easily as he slid behind Tony's back.  He took a seat against the arm of the couch, and tugged Tony back into the shelter of his chest.  Tony leaned back, his breath leaving him in a cough.  Steve rubbed a comforting hand over his breastbone.  “You okay?”
“You sure you don't need anything?”
“Yeah, well, something has.  Don't tell him what, exactly, I'd like a chance for Steve to discuss it with him in person,” Tony said.
Jan took a mock swing at him with her basket.  “How rude,” she sniffed.  “And here I brought you a variety of delicious treats to speed up your recovery.”  She shoved the basket into Tony’s hands and flounced her way across the workshop to the couch.  “And this is the thanks I get?”
Tony stared down at it, not sure what the churning sensation in his stomach meant.  But when he flexed his fingers, the ring felt like it had always been there, as familiar as the armor against his skin.
“The ones that can be brewed into alcohol?”  She gave him an okay gesture, her thumb and index finger making a circle.  “Absolutely.  All the others?  Not so much.”
He woke up to someone knocking at his door.
“Do I now,” Tony said, but he turned his head into Steve's palm, some of the tension seeping out of his body.
She smiled at him.  “Okay!  But Registration closes in 30 minutes.  Just so you know!”
Tony lowered his hand to his chest.  He traced the scar tissue there.  “I miss a lot of things.”
“God, I lo-” The words were almost out before he realized it, and he choked on him, his throat closing up before he could completely humiliate himself.  Steve looked up at him, his eyes bright, and Tony reached for his wineglass, trying to ignore the way his fingers were shaking.
Tony picked up the book on top.  “Didn't I give you an e-reader?” he asked, holding up the massive hardcover.  “They're...  More portable.”
“I-” Bruce stopped.  Set the coffee cup down on the table.  “This game we’re playing is hard enough when we know where all the pieces are,” he said, and everyone went silent.  He looked around, blinking nervously behind the crooked frames of his spectacles.  “Let alone who’s moving them.”
The doors to the chapel opened with a bang, and everyone, as one, swivelled to look.  Phil Coulson, his hands braced on the door panels, came to a halt, his eyes narrowing on Steve and Tony.
“Are you all right?” Steve leaned back, his hands cupping DJ’s head, tipping it up.  His face was tense, his eyes darting back and forth as he tried to take everything in at once.  “Deej?  Talk to me.  Are you-”\\
“Wait,” he said, his eyes narrowing.  “At the theater.  Seamus said you said that Hammer’d been talking to someone.  Someone who’d made him an offer.”  He paused.  “I thought he was talking about Hogan here.  He wasn’t, was he.”
Steve turned around, and yes, that’s exactly what Bucky was doing.  “No,” Bucky said, his face set in a frown, but he never took his eyes off of the cat.  “Why is it following me.”
“Yeah, well, so're you,” she said, right before the playroom door opened.
“Mr. Stark?”
Tony blinked at him.  “What.”
“It was the right choice for me.  I wasn't happy, I wasn't-”  His head dipped in a slight nod.  “I could've stayed there, Tony, in a five star restaurant, being a head chef.  As a rising star of a cuisine I barely liked.  Maybe even operating my own place someday.  I could've had, I don't know, a cooking show or a cookbook or a line of fancy pans that are absolutely over priced and sold to people who don't know any better.”
DJ tucked his knees up against his chest.  His shoulders were jerking with the force of his breathing, and he nodded, a sharp twitch of his head.
Even as the words were leaving her mouth, Jarvis emerged from the kitchen stairs, Peter right behind him.  Clint leaned forward.  “Oh, this is going to be rich.”
“Everyone likes flowers,” Jess said, with a shrug.
"Oh my God, he is in a mood," Ellen grumbled. She dropped her bag and straightened her jacket. “How do I look?”
“You said that before.”  Darcy shifted on the couch, mumbling in her sleep, and Harris rubbed her shoulder, slow and soothing.  She let out a sigh, and went still again.  Harris looked up at DJ.  “Why do you think it’s your fault?”
The blonde opened his mouth, but the kid in the sweatshirt beat him to the punch.  “My dads,” he said, his attention focused on the chapel.
Steve sucked in a breath, his head hanging down.  "Don't know what you're talking about," he said, and Sam laughed.
“I think I can afford that,” Tony said.  “I’ll check the budget.”
"It will pass.  Until I can put something better together for you," Miss Van Dyne said, and she had DJ's feet in her lap now, tickling his toes.  He jerked them away, giggling, and then, after a moment, cautiously put them back.  Grinning, Miss Van Dyne caught his feet in her hands.  "Now, Jarvis must have some pins, and you can-"
“I'm fine,” Steve said.  He met Tony's eyes, and there was a scuff just under his left eye, a mark of ash or dirt.  “I am fine, Tony.  You can stop asking.”
"'Set the table,'" Tony echoed.  Steve arched an eyebrow at him.  "Why are we-"  Tony shook his head.  "By 'set the table' do you mean, 'bring a plate over here so that we can put food on it and then eat it?'"
“All the best places do have a dress code,” Obie agreed.  He paused.  “Tony.  Have you considered what will happen if you do keep this child, and you can’t handle him?”
Steve looked up, and Tony was grinning at him, his eyes brilliant in the hollows of his masks.  “What do you think?” he asked, giving Tony a lopsided smile.  “Can I pull it off?”
“Because maybe you're right, and it's time to start asking questions,” Tony said, shifting the tray in his hands.  “But I'll be damned if I do it blind.”
“Diagnosed by an expert,” Steve said.
“Yes, well, story of my life this week,” Tony said.  He stood up.  “Anyone else got something to say?”  The team looked at him with varying degrees of amusement and pity.  He chose to ignore the latter for now.  He could have them all murdered later. “Good.  Get out.”
“I always have, sir.”
But if he closed his eyes, and ignored that nagging voice in the back of his head, he could pretend it was.  For just a minute.  Two, at most.
Pepper glanced around.  "The-  Oh, DJ?"  Everything fell into place.  "Ah, so that's what pried you out of the workshop while the sun was still out.  You brought-"
“We were in the kitchen,” Rhodey said, scribbling some notes in the margins of one of the textbooks.  “I don’t think they did this formula right, let me just-”
“I can't, I have a thing, Pepper-”  Steve arched an eyebrow at him, his head tipping forward, and the other shoe dropped with a resounding thud in Tony's head.  “She set me up.”
The box slipped out of his fingers, crashing to the workshop floor, and Tony stumbled backwards, his shoulders hitting the wall.  He slid down to the floor, fighting the descent the whole way.  One hand bounced against the remains of the workbench, the raw, charred edge scraping against his palm.
Harris gave her a look.  “That didn’t sound sincere.”
The boy snatched his hat back off of his head, holding it in front of him in both hands "Fifteen next year, Mr. Stark, and an old fifteen it'll be."
"No," Tony said, trying to sound bored.
By the time he pulled into his usual parking spot behind his building, Tony was snoring, soft and gentle.  Steve put the truck in park, bracing his hands on the steering wheel.  He could probably get Tony inside without waking him.  It might be easier, but knowing Tony, he'd wake up at exactly the wrong time.
"Yes, but not in the way you're thinking."  She started walking again, back towards the guard station.  "That envelope I gave him?  There's a stash of them at the desk.  They've got the information of one of the shelters here in the city for runaways, and, well-"  Her mouth went tight.  "Throwaways.  Kids who have no where else to go.
“I know.  It's a nightmare.”
“Probably for the best,” Steve agreed as the landing pad came into view.  He raised his free hand to wave at DJ just as Hulk came bounding up the side of the building.
DJ shook his head. “Won't,” he said, his voice hopeful.
Sam stood next to him, also facing the elevator doors.  He leaned towards Steve.  “You’re thinking of how to ditch me right now, aren’t you?” he asked, sounding amused.
It seemed wrong to ask, so wrong that he couldn’t even finish the thought, but Tony answered him anyway.  “A lot of nonsense,” he said, tapping the folded pages against his palm.  “That they’ve rooted out the vile nest of anarchists, that I’m safe at last, and all is well thanks to the heroic efforts of the New York Metropolitan Police.”
“Deal.”
Natasha didn’t look up from her phone.  “I choose my alliances based on who’s offering me the better samosas,” she said, her voice bored.
“Right.”  He stacked up half a dozen of them in the butcher paper, and folded it up around them.  He handed the packet over.  “One for each of you, and an extra one for you.”
“Also that,” Tony agreed.
Furbro wound his way around Steve’s ankles, then headed across the room.  He stopped in front of the closet, rearing up to paw at the door.  He looked back at Steve.  “Deej?”  Steve tapped on the door.  “Can I open this?”
“Fixing it,” she said, taking his credit card from Harris and sliding it across the registration desk.  “Give me six of your most expensive passes, five adults and one child, and if he keeps this up, I’m going to make Tony make the child pass.”
Steve stared at him.  “Your Majesty?”
“So I can wear the burnt umber silk-”
Clint grinned.  “Kiss the cook,” he said.  “In fancy script.”
Steve rolled his shoulders.  "It's fine."
“Oh, and you're not?” Franklin said, shoving his books back into his backpack.  “Really?”
“By 'properly displayed,' you mean, 'when you prop it up against a wall,' right?” Carol said.  She pushed a box towards Steve, who started filling it with sketchbooks.  “How many of those do you have?”
Obie’s smile was slight and gentle.  “Sit down,” he said, waving at the empty chair at the foot of the table.  “Before you fall down.”
"Good enough."  She bounced away, grabbing a massive binder from a nearby table.  "Now, about the appetizers-"
The customs officer closed the dictionary and handed it back.  The student retreated back to his place in line, and the officer reached for his stamp.  "Case will be reviewed in the morning, if you are still here.  Until then-"  The stamp came down with a very final sounding thump on first Tony's paperwork, then Steve's.  The officer pushed them back across the counter with a wide grin.  "Welcome to Symkaria.  Enjoy your stay."  He leaned to the side.  "NEXT."
“Sorry, I’m late, sorry, was-  I was cutting fruit,” Bruce said, hustling in, his arms wrapped around a large plastic bowl.  “The speaking committee gave me a fruit basket.  For, well, for speaking.”
Steve nodded.  “All younger,” he guessed.  “You must be working to help support your family, then.”
“Jury’s out,” Steve said.  He paused.  “Actually, most of the jury is in a sugar coma.  Except Jess.  I think she’s built up an immunity.”  He leaned his chin on one hand.  “Feel free to help yourself.”
Tony looked at DJ, who was considering the backs of a couple of brochures.  “Do I-”
Warnings for canon appropriate violence and some discussion (with a little foul language) of the sort of street level sexual harassment that tends to be aimed at women and LGBTQ people, while skipping the actual harassment.
She stopped, her voice trailing off, and Steve glanced at her.  "Heroic?"
“I mean, if you think you can't handle it by yourself,” Carol said with a smirk.
“But you’re still open to the possibility, wonderful.”  Jan bounced back to her feet.  “My mother said that the first marriage never sticks, in any case, I’d consider it a warm up for my marriage to Hank, we can figure out who’s worth inviting, just based on the wedding gifts and what flower arrangements just don’t work down in St. Marks, isn’t that totally worth the effort?”
Harris was good that way.  “Yes,” DJ said.  “Good night.”
“Sure,” Steve called back.  “Bring some for everyone.”
DJ nodded.  “Steve?”
“A trap,” Natasha agreed.  “What’s the bait?”
He hated everything about this.
“Acceptable,” Tony said, with a slight smile.  He snuggled back into the pillows behind him.  God, he ached.  His book slid off his knee, and he made a grab for it before he could lose his place.  Not that it'd be hard to find it again.  He'd managed about four pages in the last hour.  “Until I walked into your apartment, Steve, I had no idea that there were this many books on Brooklyn history in the world.”
Jesse sniffed at the tea, her eyes falling closed.  “Everyone saw the ring.”  She took a cautious sip.  “I mean, everyone who's following Janet VanDyne's Instagram.”
“I spent the next few years making a place for myself in one of the crime families,” she said.  “Fisk’s, to be precise.”  Steve’s head snapped up, and she met his eyes with a faint smile.  “Yeah.  Fisk.”
Shuri made a rude noise and dug her spoon into her stew.  “Horrible,” she muttered.  “These people are mad.  Everything is cooked to death, or sealed in aspic.” Her nose wrinkled up.  “Who does these things?  Why would they do all this, all this work, to make something that tastes so bad?”
“Anthony.”
Tony nodded.  “Let me know if-”
He didn't remember moving.
DJ thought about that.  Nodded.
“And if you end this now, say it was a mistake, even an innocent mistake, then there's no amount of donations that you can make to LGBTQ causes that can erase that,” Marcy said.  She spread her hands.  “You are absolutely going to piss off someone.”
Tony reached up, flicking the tip of Steve’s nose. “I love you,” he said, and DJ bounced again.  Tony gave him a look.  “What?”
Ellen stared at him. "Can I-"
He regretted the words, almost before they were out of his mouth, but Tony nodded.  “I do, actually,” he said.  “And was trying to find a socially acceptable way to demand it.”
DJ blinked.  “Tacos.”
He woke in the small hours of the morning, squinting against the sunlight that filtered in through the mostly closed curtains.  Grumbling to himself, Tony tried to roll over.  The sheets tangled around his chest, and he flailed at them with one arm, finally getting himself free.  There was an odd, sharp pull at his shoulder, and then he was free.
“Okay, we're done,” Tony said, kicking the armor into overdrive.  “Thor, draw it left, we need to-”
Okoye turned her staff to the side and used it to bop both of them with one flick of her wrist.  “Idiots,” she said.  She turned back to the door.  “Take it.”  She paused, and looked back over her shoulder at Steve.  “You will need it.”  She opened the door.  “Come, your Highness.”
“Good at sorting,” DJ pointed out.
His finger was hovering over the little red phone icon when the call went through.  “Hello,” Rhodey said, and Steve swung the phone back to his cheek.
He grinned at her.  “If they’re not real-”
The kitchen was warm and bright, the shutters on the windows thrown open wide, and every burner on the stove going.  Clint was crouched in front of the oven, one muscular forearm balanced on his knee as he checked the contents.  Tony inhaled, savoring the scent of toasted sugar and yeast, mingling with the smell of freshly-brewed coffee and the savory tang of frying bacon.  He straightened up, shutting the oven door with a flick of one foot.  “Another five minutes,” he called, reaching for the frying pan.  “Then it’s all yours, Mrs. Parker.”
“Right.  It’s yours,” Bucky said, turning towards the kitchen.  “I’ll go see if the well out back is still drawing.”  He stomped off, his shoulders hunched, his footsteps heavy on the stone floor.
Phil half stood from his chair, taking the folder away from him.  “No,” he said, and it came out a bit harsher than he’d intended.  He dropped back into his seat, slapping the folder down in the middle of his blotter.
Tony snatched it out of his hands.  “Look, I-”
“So we get to the kitchen, and Jarvis beat us there somehow, and none of this appeared to bother him, like intruders were force marched through the house at gunpoint all the time.”  Clint paused in the act of pouring Steve another cup of coffee.  “In retrospect, that might be the case.”
He tossed some butter in the hot skillet, swirling it back and forth as it melted with a hiss.  “We’d been working together for a while.  She found the jobs.  Did the planning.  I was the muscle, not the brains, but I trusted her, so…”  One shoulder rose and fell in a half shrug, and he reached for the cutting board, scraping the chopped onions and garlic into the hot butter.  “When she found a client who wanted a trinket from the Stark Mansion, and was willing to pay handsomely for it?  I was on board.”
“Ring the mistletoe,” Steve said.
"Breakfast," everyone chorused as one, and Tony nodded.
Tony thought about that.  “So...  You and Jarvis colluded to set me up.”
“Steve's in my bed,” Tony repeated, the words forced out from between set teeth.  “How the fuck do you think I am?”
Clint slammed the door shut.  “But you want a burger, too.”
“It is party planning time,” she sing-songed, and everyone else groaned.  A ball of paper came flying over the table, and she batted it away.  “I’m going to ignore that, Barton.”
She straightened up.  “We have a problem here?” she asked, her eyes catching on each of them in turn.  Then, with a nod, she headed for the door.  “Tomorrow, gentlemen.”  She paused, her foot on the stoop, her hand on the doorframe.  She looked back, a bright smile on her face.  “Welcome home.”
Steve shook his head.  “Well, that was underhanded,” he said, and god, he didn’t even care.
“I appreciate the business.”  Shiro shook his head, ladling steaming hot broth into bowls with a quick, practiced hand.  His black hair was swept back under a red and yellow bandana, an apron tied around his narrow waist.  “But even for you, busy night,” he said, reaching past Tony for a steamer basket.  He eyed the dough with a faint frown of disapproval.  “Maybe-”
He rubbed a hand over his mouth.  "You know the kid he's pushing is going to be difficult, don't you?"
"He's not going to get adopted," he said at last, the words hard.  "No one's going to take him, Miss Potts.  He's-"  He shook his head.  "He's smart, he likes to work, he doesn't need much.  But he's-"  He stopped.  "He's odd, I suppose.  He's too quiet, and too still, and when he moves, it's not the way people expect him to move.  He can fixate on things, and sometimes he has trouble following orders and he's stubborn sometimes.”
“One ought not to question some things,” Agatha said, slapping a hat onto her head.  DJ wasn’t sure where it had come from.  She collected her cane.  “Let us see what we can find out, shall we?” she asked Wanda, who nodded.
At the front of the room, they stopped, and Trip turned off the music with the punch of a button.  She waited until Darcy and DJ had settled down beside Harris before she turned to Steve and Tony.  She smiled, and Steve smiled back, his hand still clasped firmly in Tony’s.
Tony reached out, adjusting Steve's bow tie.  “How are you still wearing this?”
He stopped.  “Some people.   The law doesn’t care about.”
Tony smiled down at him, folding his arms on the railing of the stairs.  "Tolerable," he said.  He looked tired, dark circles under his eyes and lines bracketing his mouth.  But when he smiled, it seemed to fade, his brown eyes warm.  "How was the curb traffic?"
“Why is the child still here?”
“What do you ever do with flowers?” Steve shot back, his voice full of laughter.
“Forever,” Tony said.
“You’re freezing,” Steve said, his hands wrapping around Tony’s.  “Where’s your jacket?”
Steve nodded.  “For tonight, it is,” he said, and then he was out the door and gone.
He pointed a finger at Tony.  “No,” he said, his voice as firm as he could make it.
"Fuck you," Tony grumbled, but held no heat.  He slumped against the door, his head braced against the window.  He sniffed, scrubbing at his nose with the back of one hand.  "Fucking leaf juice."
“God, no, we’re talking them off the ledge, not riling them up,” Darcy said, taking a cup of soup out of his hand and putting it back on the tray.  “I tend to either bring up the Kardashians or give them an opening to tell me just how horrible The Big Bang Theory is.  Then, alcohol.”
“Who cares about you?” Tony asked him with a smile.  “It's dangerous for me, and that's the only thing that really matters.”  He tossed Rhodey's note aside.  “Well.  Rhodes is replaceable.  You are small, but I suspect you can be taught.”
“Where’s-”  Tony fought with the word, forcing it out past a numb tongue and dry lips.  “DJ.  Where’s-”
Tony inclined his head in a half-bow.  “Deal,” he said, extending his hand.  She took it with a pleased chuckle of laughter, giving it a firm shake.
“We’re closed!” Tony called back.  “Make a reservation!”
"Is that a no?" Steve asked, almost sing-song, his eyes bright beneath the heavy weight of his wet hair.
Bobbi met his eyes with a faint smile.  “Kind of surprised it wasn’t just left standing open,” she said, pulling the door open and waving him past her.
“Thank you.”  With a smile, Strange exploded in a swirl of gleaming sparks.
“Oh, I think you are.”  She pulled her hand back, and a trail of holographic sparks chased her fingers.  She gave Tony a smile.  “Your view is so much wider, and so much deeper, than just about being I’ve ever met.  You are intimately acquainted with fear.  And you have the means and the ability to build a way to counter against all the things that go bump in the night.”
“Yes, we save the manhandling for the grounds,” Jarvis said, utterly deadpan.  He collected DJ's shoes, dusting them off with a flick of his fingers.  “Or preferably off property.”
“Agatha Harkness,” he said, only stumbling a little on the name.  “Wanda’s…  Teacher.”
“Yes, but we’ll be judging your conversation, so, feel free to have phone sex,”  Carol said cheerfully.
“Are you all right?” he asked, his hands on Tony’s face, smoothing through his hair, cradling Tony’s head in his hands.  “Tell me you’re all right, are you-”
"Trust me, no one is more traumatized and horrified by this than I am," Tony said.  He drained the smoothie.  He gave Sue a thin lipped smile.  "I would've thought that Reed would've told you about this.  Because Reed absolutely knows about him."
Phil took a visible breath.  “No,” he said.  “Carry on.”  And he stepped back into the lobby, pulling the doors shut with a click.
Coulson gave the cat a level stare.  “I am not in the mood for shenanigans,” he said, and the cat’s ears flicked in his direction.  “So unless you are here to tell me that all of them are ready to go home, then I would ask you to remove yourself.”
Tony inclined his head in a half-bow.  “Hai,” he said.  He glanced at the stove.  “Thanks for the recipe, I’ll get this one down before I ask for another one.”
“Maybe better.”  Tony reached up with his free hand, hooking a finger in the neck of Steve’s t-shirt.  Steve came willingly, until his lips were hovering just a breath from Tony’s.  “You didn’t hear it from me, though.”
“Yes, Chef!” everyone chorused, and Steve hustled Tony back to the coat room.
Whatever that thing was, it wasn't suited for New York.  No matter who had made it, it was alien here, it was a lumbering, brightly colored menace.
Tony's head came up, and his eyes met Steve's across the length of the studio. He was smiling, that familiar, perfect half smile. Steve's phone buzzed again, and he glanced down at it.
“Right,” Tony said, pinching the bridge of his nose.
Tony peeked out from under his arm.  “Checking on your team?”
“Yeah, no, you're useless like this,” Tony said, picking up a screwdriver.  He tapped DJ on the tip of his nose with it.  “Tiny and squishy and useless.”
Tony gestured at the sideboard.  “I’ve got a fresh bottle of your favorite, help yourself.”
“But he's not going to pick up,” Tony finished for her. “Right.” The doors opened, and he slid out. “I'm on my way.”
There was a scrambling sound next to him, feet kicking hard against the carpet, and Tony's hand snapped out, making a desperate grab for Peter as he lunged towards the balcony.  “Parker, don't, what the hell are you-”
“I've never been funnier,” Tony agreed. He slipped a hand into his pocket, pulling out a pocket watch. “Ah. How unfortunate, it's almost time for the show to start.” He snapped the watch shut with a flick of his fingers. “If you'll excuse us?”
"Well, we left kind of a mess in the living room," Steve admitted.  "Figured that dinner might help you ignore that for a few days."
Tony took a sip of his coffee.   He didn’t miss any of it.  He just hated change.  And he needed to get a decent night’s sleep.
“This is why you can’t get a girl to step out with you a second time, you know that, right?”
“No.  You don’t.” Steve took a deep breath, and this one burned in an entirely new way.  “But no.  I don’t know of any reason why you shouldn’t…”  He smiled, and she smiled back. “Ask Sam out.”
“I was in the back seat, with the-  With DJ, and he kicks like a mule, I could barely hold onto him, he always made things difficult, the always-”
"A woman he's never met just came crashing into his bedroom, demanded that he take off his clothes, and is now manhandling him.  You're lucky he's not running screaming into the night," Stark said.  "Jan.  Give the man some space, he didn't hire you as his tailor."
“For getting you into this? Or making you share a stage with Morrison?”
“Here you are.”
“Would your father let you eat that?”
It was a very well composed shot.  If she hadn't been in the middle of the same mess as Jesse had been last night, she would've thought it was staged.  But there was no chance that was the case, and that meant, Jesse had gotten very, very lucky.
“I can-”
Steve smiled back at him.  "Yes.  You did."  He reached for the coal shuttle.  "Have you eaten?"
“Yes, can't imagine why that is,” Tony said.  DJ had settled down on the carpet next to the desk again, his attention focused on a massive book of mechanical diagrams that Jarvis had found for him.  Sprawled out on his stomach, he seemed perfectly content to pour over every page.  Tony kind of wished he could join him.  Instead, he reached for another stack of paperwork.  “How much more of this do we have?” he asked Pepper.
“Yes, yes, I'll rip the label off next time,” Tony said, throwing himself down on the couch with a sigh.  The pizza boxes were almost within reach, and he considered them with a narrow look.  “Just drink it.”
Tony stared at him, and Steve stared back, utterly unconcerned.  “DJ, would you like to see a movie with me?” Tony asked at last.
"I think you can handle that yourself, Elisabeth Tuber-Ross," Tony said to Sam, his voice cutting.
“Or someone rewarded him handsomely for putting his signature on a few orders,” Steve said.  He took a deep breath.  “And anyone I could trust doesn’t have the power to work outside the system.”  A bitter pill to swallow, but one that he was willing to choke down, because lives depended on it.
DJ smiled at her.  “Don't have anything here,” he managed, the words heavy on his tongue.  “I can-”
“I’d lay money that he’s been making the trip regularly, if not every night,” Steve said.  He turned to the room.  “Because he wasn’t here when our intruder arrived.”
"Where's mine?" he asked, waving at the cruller she was holding between her teeth.
He picked up the other glass and held it out to Steve. “Drink?”
“No promises, boss,” Bobbi said, the basket thrown over her shoulder.  “Let's go, boys.”
Warnings for some discussions of past child abuse, in a controlled, non-graphic manner.
"Thank you," DJ said.  He gave up and flopped on the counter, his arms thrown out in front of him.  "You are a good person."
“You are a real piece of work, you know that, Rogers?” he managed, and his voice sounded tight and shaky to his ears.
Steve chuckled.  “I mean, what if it looks better on me than it does on you?”
“I'm handing out referrals at the end of this.”
The photographer grinned from behind his camera.  “Yeah, I figured that out.”  He took a couple of quick shots, and Steve did his best not to flinch.  “Who's it for?”
“If we’re not escorted out of the building by security, I’m sure we will,” Isaiah said.
“We all know who the good child is,” Tony agreed. He flicked his pen against the table, and tossed it aside. “Are we done?”
“So you went down there.”
Tony smoothed a hand over his chest, his fingers light on the fabric.  "What do you think?"  He dropped into the chair opposite Steve, the movement graceful and controlled.  He tossed the napkin down between them.  "I think it suits me."
Obie patted his pants pockets, his eyebrows drawn up tight as he searched for something.  “I shouldn’t, this early,” he said, pulling an aspirin tin from his vest pocket with a sigh of relief.  “But desperate times call for desperate measures.”
Inevitable.
"No, no, this is great, I can be the fuckup uncle, I am fine with this," Clint said.  "It's a relief.  No one expects the fuckup uncle to be useful, just reassuring.  No pressure from the guy who's pleased he found matching shoes at some point in his life.  Great.  This is great.”  He held up his hands.  “Fuckup uncle.  I can do this, Jay, no problem.”
Rogers stared down at him.  He did not look impressed. "He's asleep, Mr. Stark.  He's-" Rogers waved a hand down at DJ, and Tony followed the motion.  DJ was flopped forward, his cheek pressed against the bench, his eyes closed, his moth gaping open.  Tony was pretty sure he was drooling.  "He's of no use to you," Rogers continued.  "Because he's asleep."
“I don’t know,” Steve said.  “And that’s…  That’s the problem.  I thought I knew who you were.  I thought I understood what I was getting into, but I don’t.  And I didn’t.  And-”  He took a deep breath.  “And I-”
“Yes,” he gritted  out.  “On the floor.  Where you found it.  Before you chose to start meddling in things that aren’t yours, that aren’t any of your business, and it’s not none of this is, but you think you have the right to play aroudn with it, with our things, with our lives, you just want to revel in it, to fix it, to fuck it up, because you have this power, this power no one else has, and fuck that, fuck it all.
Her head swiveled in his direction. “Because you’re the only one who’s going to suffer at the world’s largest ball of twine,” she said.  “I’ll do anything for a stupid instagram photo, Harris been to three garlic festivals this year-”
Tony's lips twitched.  "Thank you for clarifying."  He blew on his pizza, wondering if he was willing to risk mouth burns yet.  The answer was probably yes.  "So, he's got the catalog in order, and..."
Steve opened the passenger door.  “So they know it’s time to run.”   He met Tony’s eyes over the top of the car.  “If you don’t want me to be a target, get in the car.  As long as you’re standing here, so am I.”
"I hope you enjoyed that," Tony told him.
“I'll call if we need cocoa, okay?” Clint said to him, and Phil nodded.  “You sure, Jarvis?  He usually wants Steve, times like these.”  He found a pair of sweatpants, neatly folded on top of the clean laundry.  They might've been Phil's.  He decided he was too tired to care, and fumbled his way into them.
He ducked around them, climbing the ramp into the back of the quinjet.  The heat hit as soon as he cleared the door, and he pulled his cowl back.  “Tony?”
“Fuck you, I’m a romantic!”
The boy shifted his weight, his feet shuffling awkwardly on the polished stone floor.  “‘Bout that,” he said, his voice shaking at the edges.  “Wonderin’ if I could just take a turnover, or maybe two?  And eat ‘em later?”
“It’s all right, he’s-” The girl paused, her head tipped to the side.  “I’m not quite sure what he is, but I don’t think that’s-”
"Doesn't matter," she said.  Her head bounced to the side, her hair swinging in a perfect wave against her cheek.  "The lenses aren't prescription, they just have a little anti-glare tinting on them."
“It’s really tasteful,” Peter said.
"A fella came by here, an' we all knew he weren't right, we could tell.  If you saw him on the street, you'd cross t' get away from him, quick as you could, but ol' Hammer, he didn't listen t' us.  An' this fella, he was going to take little Mick, an' he's only six.  He's just a baby, Miss, an' none of us liked it.
“I liked it,” DJ said.  “It was-”  His head tipped to the side.  “Kind.  Fun, and nice, and clever, but it was kind, it was kind to the characters, and the player, and a lot of people liked it.”  He stopped, the sudden flow of words exhausting him.  Harris was just smiling at him, his glasses still crooked, his hand still moving against the cat’s fur.  DJ scrubbed at his face with a hand.  “A lot of people liked it,” he repeated.  “And it was nice.  Reading what they said.  What everyone said.”
Steve let his head fall onto the back of the couch, his eyes falling shut.  “Merry Christmas to me,” he said.
“I prepped for three times the normal volume, and sold out by one am,” Steve said, his arms curled around Tony’s waist.
Steve smiled up at him, full of warmth and affection.  “Am…  Am I supposed to be apologizing here?” he asked, and Tony leaned over, kissing him hard.
“Hey, I think-”
Steve froze, his chest contracting with the force of it.  Something, something eerily like fear swept over him, and he struggled to find something to say to that.
Steve’s mouth opened.  Strange waited, his eyebrows arched.  Steve sighed.  “I’ll try.”
“Bucky.”
Steve waited, but she didn’t say another word as they wandered down the slope of the path.  He nodded.  “Let me guess,” he said, his voice quiet.  “The bill came due.”
That was a horrifying thought.  Tony pinched the bridge of his nose.  “How much charcoaled marshmallow is on my counters?”
Tony nodded.  “What time is-” He caught sight of the clock and bit out a curse.  “You shouldn’t have let me sleep.”
“His favorite to scream at,” Ellen said.
“Sports,” Steve said.  “He…  Likes sports.”  He tried the words on for size and they didn’t fit at all.
“Burn that,” Pepper said out of the corner of her mouth.
DJ gave him a pitying look.  “Internet exists in my world, too,” he said, utterly deadpan.
“Just one?  Well, then, Christmas is over, and-”
Happy dropped the hood of the car.  “Know how we were sure someone manipulated things to get Rogers to show up on our stoop?” he asked, wiping his hands clean on a rag.
“I see that.” Gently, Natasha put the bottle down.  “Jarvis-”
“Steve n' Tony's Fix-It Service,” Steve said, and he was breathing better now.  Less ragged.  Less strained.  “Most startups fail in their first year, you know.”
“Got it,” Rogers said.  Tony was almost certain he was smiling, that slight, uncertain smile that Tony knew so well.

That won him a nod.  “Yells when he’s worried,” DJ said.
DJ sighed.  “Yes,” he said, and Clint could tell he was trying for patience.
Rogers crossed his arms over his chest.  "I think you're forgetting something, Mr. Stark."
Everyone looked up as Darcy stepped out of the bedroom door.  “Uh,” Harris said.
“Was hoping you wouldn't catch that,” Tony said.
“I vote we burn the place to the ground,” Jan said.  Everyone looked at her, and she shrugged.  “What?”
“You’re very good with a broom when you’re a bot,” Steve agreed.  “Finish your oatmeal, go charge a bit, then you can do that for me, okay?”
“Rogers!”  Happy stepped off the curb, his hands on his hips, and Steve accelerated, heading straight for him.
“It's all right, there's an officer of the law here,” Stark said, hooking a thumb in Steve's direction.  “Officer Rogers, Miss Van Dyne, one of our dinner companions for the evening.”
Tony smiled.  “I don’t know how.”
Tony set the net next to the bed.  “I mean, he might’ve pocketed something,” he allowed.  “Or I might’ve given him his own set.  To keep the pocketing from happening.”
"I believe I mentioned the murder plan," Tony said.
“And the prototypes.  I'll meet you in the lobby”
“So a few men gathered up a herd of goats, and went out into the grasslands and built-”  She stopped, her eyes narrowing.  “Would you call it a hut?” she asked Steve.
Tony let his eyes slide closed, trying not to cling to things he couldn't have, shouldn't have.  But Steve was there, beside him, full of laughter and warmth and life.  He was getting used to that.  To hearing Steve's footsteps in the hallway before the sun was even up.  To find Steve in his kitchen, with bowls of oatmeal or oversized sandwiches, braced over a copy of the newspaper or a tablet.  Steve's running shoes in the hallway next to the elevator, Steve's sweatshirt thrown over the back of the couch.  Steve stealing his remote and yelling at him about the dirty coffee cups scattered around the living room.
“It absolutely is.” Tony gave a firm nod.  "Wonderful.  I'll have that."
Not what she had been expecting.  Trip gave him a quick once over.  Nice suit, but wrinkled, his tie askew and the collar of his shirt bunched up under the lapel of his jacket.  He looked tired, but sober.  Maybe not voluntarily sober, but he wasn’t drunk.  At this point, Trip would take it.
“He suggested it,” Jan said.  She flapped a hand in his direction.  “Shoo, shoo, go move things, I'll just be in your room helping Carol and Jess.”
“In more ways than one, I’m starting to think,” she said.  She grinned up at Steve, and there was glitter around her eyes, pale blue and silver.  She handed up a five dollar bill.  “Put the rest in your sandwich fund, or, you know, your campaign chest.”
Duck nodded.  “They could make a mint with a reality tv show,” he agreed.  He straightened up, his narrow shoulders going straight beneath the rumpled fabric of his shirt, and set his pen down, the movement strangely final.  “But the answer's no.  You've got circumstantial evidence and a lot of supposition, and it might be true, but we're not going to be the ones to put our neck out there and publish it first.”
“Macaroni necklace,” Steve said.  “Just…  Consider it.”
“So am I,” he said.  His arms slid around Tony’s waist.  “Get Jane and SHIELD.”
“Less honest, though.”
“We are told, he is offering to help watch the goats.  He is helping build fences.  He is insisting on taking a shift to guard the camp.”  She paused.  “And the guards do not know what to do with this.  This…  Was not the plan.
Natasha glanced over her shoulder.  “Are you eating jam straight from the jar?” she asked, mildly amused.
DJ blinked, confusion sweeping over him.  His hands were warm, and he looked down to find that he was cradling a tea cup between his palms.  He didn’t recognize it.  It wasn’t one of his father’s coffee cups, with their clean, simple lines, or one of Steve’s, heavy and tough, the white porcelain marred with flecks of paint..
“Try it, I dare you,” Nebula said.  She grasped the handle of the knife holding her page in place.  “I’ll find you.”  She wrenched the knife free with a smooth, vicious movement and handed the paper over to Tony.  “There.”
“Dinner,” Sam said, with a great deal of enthusiasm, and Greer nipped in for one more quick, light kiss, her lips brushing against Sam’s.
“Uh, I’m okay,” Bruce said, retrieving a bowl of leftover pasta from the fridge.  “A little too rich for me.”
“You are welcome.  Hurry, now.”
Mickey looked at the note, then back at him, then back at the paper.  His fingers closed over it, his fingers going tight.  “What d’ you want in exchange?”
“If you wait until you can save everyone, you won’t save anyone,” he said, his voice flat.  “So you save who you can, and then you do it again.  The next day, the next night, the next month, the next year, you just keep going, you save what you can, when you can.”
“And what are you DOING about this?” Strange asked him.
“Is it any good?” Clint asked, and the girl fixing his armor snorted.
“One of those is a much smarter choice than the other,” Tony said.
“Quite,” Jarvis said.  He sounded amused.  “Remember, sir, Mr. Stane will be-”
Halfway to the elevators, he paused, his head swiveling in the direction of the coffee shop.  He couldn't see the boy through the lobby windows, and wondered if he was still there.  Maybe he'd taken a breakfast sandwich and left.  Maybe he was sitting at one of the corner tables, taking advantage of the warmth until the morning chill had burned off.  Steve wondered if he should've asked the boy what his name was.
