“But that’s the armor’s job,” Steve said.  The pride thing, he wasn’t touching.  “To take a beating, so he doesn’t have to.”  A pack of SHIELD agents were sweeping the shore just below them, and Steve shifted his weight, wanting to be moving already.  “We okay here?”
Steve laughed, bright and easy, and Tony rested his forehead against his.  “Ass.  Hands.  Now,” he said,.  Steve’s chin tipped up, and Tony met him halfway.  The kiss was gentle, soft, warm.  Tony relaxed into it, savoring the familiar pressure of Steve’s mouth, of his body.  Even when it ended, their lips lingered, neither of them eager to break the contact.
“Yes?”
“WOW,” Carol repeated, as Jess started slow clapping.
“Betcha that old uncle of his finally died,” Happy said.
"Also tea is horrible," Tony said.  He shifted in the seat, curling into the heavy weight of his jacket.  His eyes blinked, his gaze unfocused.  "Leaf juice."
"Are you planning on flying that thing at any point?" Stark asked, not looking up from his work.  The tip of his pencil darted across the page, and Steve wondered what he was doing.
"Sorry, ma'am," he said, but he soldiered on anyway.  "With all due respect, what are you doing down here?"
And when he glanced at them, his dark, gleaming eyes locking with Steve's, Steve's mouth went dry.  One of Stark's dark eyebrows arched, his lips curving up.  “And who's this?”
“Good,” he said, because what else could he say that?  Steve would know.  Steve always knew what to say.  Clint just shook his head.  “Let's focus on that.  On the not dying thing.  Cause I'm all for that, I'm good with being anti-death.”  There was a roar, somewhere above them, an explosion of sound that shook the earth.  “C'mon.  You and me, we can bond over our newly found sense of self-preservation.”
When he was done, DJ flopped onto his back with a groan.   There was a moment of silence, and then Natasha was lowering herself down next to him.  She picked up the cup.  “Thank you.”
“We’re not going to see the fountains go off,” Tony said.
“And if I were to do so, I would be failing in my duty to you,” Jarvis said.  He turned on his heel, the movement brisk and efficient, to collect Tony's jacket from the hanger. “Which is, of course, utterly unthinkable.”
"It's a horrible movie about a deer being shot," Tony said. "And what you're describing could lead to us watching it."
He drank, two long gulps, then pushed it away, his hand shaking.  “Rhodey?  Happy?” he croaked.
“I sure as fucking did,” Clint said.  He shook the wrinkles out of his map.  “And we’re going to like, at least one Cirque du Soleil show.”
Tony grinned as he reached for the pot of coffee on the tray.  “How ungentlemanly,” he said, pouring a cup.  He held it out to Steve.  “And unnecessary.”
“Natasha is in the solarium, tending to her plants.  Bruce is in the midst of his yoga routine.  Phil is reviewing some case files.  The others are still asleep,” Jarvis said.
“By the fridge,” Steve said, gesturing at the box.
Tony didn't even know he was reaching for the helmet until he felt the weight of it between his palms.  “Get me a red one,” he said, turning it over in his hands.  “I've got a theme going on here, and you're ruining it.”
Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the heights of Brooklyn to the south and east,
Steve blinked at him. “What?” Jarvis’s chin dipped, and Steve realized he’d moved without intending to, his body now presenting a physical barrier between Tony and the door.  He exhaled, breath hissing between his teeth. “Sorry.  I-”  He made an effort to relax, ignoring the desperate voice in the back of his head telling him to get out.  To extract himself from this very compromising position, and get out.
DJ nodded again, slow and careful.  “Yes,” he said, rolling it back and forth on his palm.  His eyes flicked up.  “Keep it?”
Tony blinked at him.  “It's not that I don't want to get into bed with you,” he said.  “It's more that I do not want him to win, and by letting him have the couch, he wins.”
Bucky was grinning at Steve.  Steve just focused on eating his stew.  “Really?” Bucky said.  “That’s shocking.”
“You are a very optimistic man,” Natasha said.
“And you might as well be my sister,” Tony pointed out.
“So the council has him loaded onto a stretcher, and they carry him out there, and toss him into the hut, and all go back to the city to congratulate themselves and be smug, which is what they do on almost a daily basis, so, not much of a change there.”  She took a couple of quick bites of the stew.  “And then everyone settles in to wait.
Peter took it.  Bruce shook his head.  “You’re going to regret this,” he said.
“You sound like an idiot, you know that, right?”
“Yes, well, don't get used to it.” Tony waved a hand in his direction. “And the 'Mr. Stark' thing is beginning to annoy me.  Call me Tony, everyone does.”
“I am going out with Rhodey tonight,” Tony said.  He glanced at the clock.  “If he ever decides to show up, that is.”  He reached for the bottle of cleaner and found Pepper staring at him, her coffee cup hanging in mid-air as if she’d forgotten it.  Tony arched an eyebrow at her.  “What?”
Clint's head snapped up, eyes wide, his breath coming out in a strangled yelp.  He jerked upright, his head twitching from side to side, confusion obvious on his face.  “Deej?”
He glanced at DJ.  “But it's not just me.  I'm not the only one who-” He reached out, his fingers ghosting over DJ's hair.  “It's not just you and me anymore.  There's all these other people in our life now, and I'm not sure how that happened, when that happened, but you've got more than me.” and thank God for that.”
“I'll wear my best looking one,” he said, just before Natasha leaned around the tree.
Steve shoved the vase at Tony.  “Here,” he said, because that was what came to his lips, drowning out the the words he wanted to say, the words he was desperate to say, all those words flooding his mind, filling his throat, the words of affection, of need, of love, and he tried again.  “Here.”
DJ held up his bag.  “I have armor,” he said.  “It flies.”  Tony turned around to stare at him, and DJ smiled.  “I fly.”
“I like how you say 'we,'” Luke said.  He hefted a massive box up, balancing it easily on one shoulder.  “As if you're, you know, participating.”
“But far more protected than the average mutant,” Sue said.  She shook her head.  “You're telling me that in the same situation, you'd choose DJ over a city full of more vulnerable children?”
Billy jumped out of the way as Happy ran past, the boy’s head swinging around to follow him as he disappeared up the hall.  “What’s-” He looked at Steve, his face pale. “What’s going on?”
“Yeah.  And in the middle of that something, you stopped to get your costume fixed, and I figured that I had time to stand in the longest line known to man to get the worst churro in the world, and look.” She waved the churro at him like a wand, her eyebrows arching.  “I was right.  Cause you’re still standing here.  Navel gazing.”
"DJ and I discussed the etiquette of the situation with him," Thor said.  Tony gave him a look, and Thor grinned at him.  "He has promised to be an ideal guest."
“Find him.  Strange was just here-”
“We’re both getting a large so that when Drew steals half of them, we’ll still get some,” Harris said.  He waited until her back was turned, then grabbed a brownie from the dessert case.  If he was going unhealthy, he was going all the way.  “And can we go back?”
“That’s good.”
“Someone give me coffee or I’m going back to bed, I’ve slept in way worse than this,” Clint said, stumbling out of his bedroom.  Tony looked over, checking to see if his eyes were open.  The mostly weren’t, but that wasn’t slowing him down.
There was a long moment of silence.  "How badly did they fuck up the pool?" Carol asked, and the room erupted in jeers.  "Serious question!" she said, fending off a wad of paper that someone threw at her head.  "Are we accepting this?  Are we accepting this for the 'Who's going to get married in Vegas' pool?"
“You're FIRED,” Jan said.
“I have a headache the size of Mount Everest,” Tony said, through gritted teeth.  “And it’s the coldest thing in the freezer.”  He opened one eye, glaring in Steve’s direction.  “At this point, it’s more effective if I don’t drink it.”
Her teeth flashed in a bright smile, showing off the tips of her incisors.  “Everything’s great,” she said, brushing her hair away from her face with the back of one hand.  “Can I talk to you for a second?”  Her eyes darted in Tony’s direction.  “Alone?” she added, her tone apologetic.
Bill leaned in, his eyes narrowing as he studied Steve.  “Sure, Mr. Hogan,” he said at last.  He gave Steve a broad smile.  “Evening, Mr. Rogers.  You new on staff?”
“I told you that showing it to anyone else would probably be a bad idea?  Yeah,” Sam said, grinning.
Greer’s nose wrinkled as she filled a cup with juice.  “You shot me last time.”
“Nope,” Harris said into his pillow.
“Or because it’s, you know, super illegal?” Haris said to her.  “Because it is.  It would be super illegal.  And it’s a casino, Darce.  I’m pretty sure they don’t draw a line between ‘got into our systems to make the fountains go’ and ‘got into our systems to siphon all our money.’”
“I suspect you would,” he said.  He rested a hand on the tabletop, his fingers rattling against the wood.  “Do you know why I’m currently sitting on the throne, Captain?”  Steve shook his head, and Nicholas smiled.  “Because no one wanted me there.”
Trip stifled a laugh.  “Thirty-two,” she said.  “And I am never doing that again, honey, it was, to forgive a term, a certified clusterfuck.”
“This may come as a shock to you, Clint, but SHIELD has a vested interest in keeping tabs of StarkIndustries assets,” Phil said.  “Because when Stark inevitably goes off the grid, it’s easier to track one of his planes than it is to track him.”
Tony made a face. “Bad?”
The boy's shoulders twitched forward.  "How'd that go?" he asked, with the sarcastic scoff of a person who knew just how that had gone.  Probably through experience.
“It’s Vegas, sir.  They’re all long.”
Steve's mouth tipped up in a slight smile.  “I am,” he said, and Tony rolled his eyes, despite the rush of warmth that went through him at the words.  Steve nudged him with an elbow.  “You okay?”
“She ate that one first,” Carol said, an amused smile on her face.  She ripped her pastry in half and tossed part of it to Peter.  “Eat that, and keep your head down, kid.”  Looking grateful, Peter huddled down into himself, clutching the danish in both hands like a lifeline.
“It wasn’t-”
Sam shrugged.  “Pot calling the kettle black here, buddy.  You've got some quirks of your own.”
Strange gave him a bright smile.  “Oh, quite definitely, nothing to worry about.”  He took DJ by the elbow, steering him towards the stairs.   “Let’s just head to the library, we’ll be able to-”  One of the bannisters snapped up, the wood creaking like a branch in the wind.  Heaving a put upon sigh, he gave it a sharp rap with his knuckles.  “Worse than termites, I swear.”
“I know.”  Tony leaned into him, just for a second, because he was weak sometimes.  And when it came to Steve, he was always weak.  This was enough.  This was absolutely enough.
His mother waited, patient and quiet.  Steve looked at her.  “Something just as scary,” he admitted.
“Nope.”  Steve pushed the door open and slid out of the car, not surprised when Tony immediately opened his door and followed him out.  Steve paused, his hand braced on the door.  “I’m going into the front seat.  Stay here.”
Despite himself, Tony smiled.  “So.  You’re a father.”
Steve gave him a look.  “Saying ‘please’ works in most cases, you do realize that, don’t you?” he asked, pulling the book from Tony’s hand and tossing it towards the bedside table.  “And if you’re done rifling through my positions for the time being…”
He looked up, his face flushed.  “It’s perfect,” he managed, and DJ grinned at him.  “Thank you.”
“Why?  Are you serious right now?”  Phil stared at him, and Clint stared back.  “Okay, you’re serious.  You honestly thought-”  He stopped.  “Okay.  I’m just gonna-” Clint leaned forward, fishing in his pocket, finally coming up with his phone.  He held it up.  “Going to get a second opinion.”
“Oh, may I?” Steve asked, and it wasn't as frustrating as it should've been. Probably because Tony was smiling at him, that slight, lopsided smile that he always wore when he was at his most insufferable. Steve told himself, very firmly, that it wasn't attractive.
“Well, even with sir, he didn't function properly,” Tony pointed out, and DJ giggled against his knees.  Tony grinned at him.  “Oh, you think that's funny, do you?”  DJ nodded, and Tony nodded back.  “Right.  You would.”  He shifted, moving closer, his arm thrown across the back of the couch.  “But I left you behind a lot.  And this was...  This was the first time I left you behind, wasn't it?”
“You got CLINT?” Sam asked, and Steve made a 'sorry' face at him.  Sam waved him off.  “Oh, no, don't you get involved, I know who is responsible for this.”
Val's head went down over the plating in front of her.  Her shoulders were hunched, her body tucked in tight.  “He's not hurting me,” she said, her voice quiet.
“That's not the question.”
Steve’s arms tightened, and Tony chuckled under his breath.  “I’ll buy ropes of pearls, dozens upon dozens of them, perfectly matched, gold and silver chain as thin as a hair, jewels, and just drape you with them.”
The soft crackle of a fire was interrupted by a thump, and Steve rolled over, squinting into the soft glow of the firelight.  Tony was seated in front of the fire, the poker held easily in one hand, and for a moment, Steve just stared at him, captivated by the scene.
“I can sleep for another twenty minutes and still manage sweatpants,” Tony said.
“And yet, you may not quite understand the scope of the hell you’ve unleashed,” Strange said.  “Let’s go.”
She tried to swallow and it was like trying to swallow a baseball whole, her throat closed up, her breathing hitched. "I outed you," she repeated, her teeth clipping the words. "You..." Her lips went tight. "I printed that you were in a relationship, and you had never confirmed that, let alone defined your sexual orientation. I outed you."
He nodded.  “That's fair.”  He looked up at her.  “StarkIndustries doesn't make weapons any longer, does it?”
Steve laughed. “I promise.  I won't tell your dad.”
Or maybe it was just that Tony woke up feeling distinctly melancholy.
“In my defense, I tried to reschedule, and I'm not catching cold because you can't read a note.”  Stark strode across the tile.  “All right, my little pigeons, I'm off to handle some things.  Don't have too good of a time in my absence.”
“To the ‘ordinary’ thing?” Darcy asked, sidestepping a pack of agents in SHIELD branded sweatsuits.  “No.  No, Harris, we cannot, because-”  She reached out, flicking the tip of Harris’ nose with the tip of one finger.  “Many things you are, but ordinary? You are not.”
Luckily, Val was used to him by now.  "Yes," she said, her chin tipped up.  "We did.  You and me.  WE did work."  She kicked one leg out, her foot swinging in a slow, easy arc.  "He didn't.  Because he is useless."
"Thanks for acknowledging that," Tony said. “I appreciate it.  Because I am going to.”
"Now, he spends little time there.  If he is awake, he is likely elsewhere, and if he is asleep, then the space matters very little.  It remains largely unchanged since the decorators completed it."  He was silent for a moment.  “There is much more of sir in the workshop, than in his bedroom.  That is the space where he is most himself, most comfortable and most content.  It is the place he guards most carefully, and you are welcome there, and always have been.”
“No, I'm serious, they owe me a few lies, they owe me more than a few lies,” Tony said, giving them all a threatening look.  He was pretty sure it didn't work, but he felt better having made the effort.  “I expect everyone in this room to lie enthusiastically each and every time-”
“Except Christmas,” she said.
DJ’s face lit up, and he reached for a plate.  “Everyone else?”
“Well, yeah, that's...  That's normal, don't want to break the big bad news to you, but everyone kind of wants to, and it sounds like you've got more reason than most.  But if you haven't gone around, terrorizing the neighborhood with your-” He waved a hand at her.  “Your ninety-two pounds of brute force, or whatever it is that you can do, then it's not because of you.  It's because they're bigots.  They're asshole bigots,” Clint said.  “That's why your parents are getting threatening phone calls, not because their daughter's a mutant, because their neighbors are asshole bigots.”  Her mouth was gaping open, and Clint leaned in.  “Right?”
Rhodes braced a hand on the edge of the hood.  “Right,” he said, but he was smiling, too.  He reached for a wrench.  “You gonna help me with this, or just stand around looking fancy?”
“You were yelling at the President that weekend,” Greer said.  Steve paused, and she smiled.  “You do not remember, do you?”
“What do you want for dinner?”
"Far less common," Tony said, striding towards the door.
“No.  Who're your friends?” Tony twisted around, trying to figure out what was happening.  The smell of baked pastry was stronger now, and he took a deep breath.  “What're you baking?”
“Well,” Stephen Strange said, his fingers still wrapped around Steve’s arm in a deathgrip.  He was strangely pale, his dark eyes bright as he took a deep breath.  “That was monumentally stupid.”
Happy grinned. “Never going to turn down a drink,” he said cheerfully. “Especially if you're paying, boss.”
On the second floor, Pepper stopped in front of the guest room, opening the door.  “Here.”  She stepped through, crossing to the middle of the room before she stopped.  “I put him to bed myself last night,” she said.  “At around nine pm.  Jarvis got up at five this morning, and noticed the door was open.  He came in to check on DJ and found the room empty.”  She took a deep breath.  “We've been looking since then, and haven't managed to locate him.”
Attempt fourteen.
There was a moment of stillness.  Rhodey never lifted his head from Pepper's lap.  She grinned up at the sky, her expression amused.  Stark stared at him for a long, silent moment.  Then he closed his notebook and set it down next to him, placing the pencil deliberately on top of it.
There was a moment of stillness, and then, as one, everyone lunged for their phones.
He smiled.  “Small things mean a lot, sometimes.  I guess.”  He took a deep breath.  “You're always going to be a hero, Steve.  We need your brains, after all.  You're the strategist around here.  You're the one with the plan.  You're the one we all trust.”  His thumb stroked over Steve's jaw.  “You're going to heal.  But even if you didn't...”  He smiled.  “We'll still need you.”
“All the normal girls had you,” Jess said without missing a beat.  Carol kicked her chair.  “But you're one thing.  Tony's altogether another.”
“No, they don’t,” Carol said.
He took a deep breath.  “She called you as soon as she hung up with Clint, didn’t she?”
“You need to talk Tony with someone who won’t judge you,” Rhodey said, and Steve stopped dead.
DJ nodded.  “No.  I like it.  It’s…”  He tried to line the nametag up on his chest.  “It’s me.”  He looked up.  “I’m an AI.  Or, I was.  Tony-” He took a breath.  “Tony Stark made me.  In Cambridge.  And then I was cursed by a witch, and that made me a person.”
“You’re late.”
"The woman who wrote the story," Marcy agreed. Tony made a noise, air forced out through clenched teeth, and she paused. "Are you all right?"
“Happy’s driving,” DJ said, picking up his hoodie, and shrugging into it.  “He has to pick up dad.”
Steve walked forward, trying without success to hear the sound of his own footsteps.  “I’m armed,” he said, his head tipping back.  The vaulted ceiling above them gleamed, light spilling over the white and gold surface.
“It's the cross I have to bear,” Luke agreed.  “You put me in black, and I'm going to be deeply disappointed in you, Jan.”
“Right, so we’d better be on time, or we’ll both be in trouble,” Steve said.  “Take your backpack, okay?  In case something happens, and I’m not home to get you-”
Harris had the very bad feeling that it was working.  “Uh, can I just-”
“Look, I had to try, you can't blame a guy for-”
Steve nodded.  “You find who pulled the trigger?”
“I know, because it actually fits,” Darcy said, holding out one fist towards Tony.  He tapped his knuckles against hers with a smirk.
“Yeah?”  Greer studied him, and she was smart and warm and fun and beautiful, sharp as a knife and so warm.  She loved sushi and dancing and loud music and people, just like Tony.
“Fine, fine, I’ve given up trying to guess it,” Clint said.  “This is for me and Phil, huh?”:  DJ nodded.  “Okay.  Want to help, Phil?”
“He looks like someone hit him in the face with a cast iron skillet and he needs a shave,” Carol said.  “Rhodey’s doing better.”
“Fine, but if I start hissing, you might want to move out of range,” Greer said, plopping back in her seat.  Jess leaned over her, brandishing a comb and a hopeful smile.  Greer gave her a look.  “Really?” Jess nodded, and Greer smiled at her.  “Fine.  Go ahead.”
Steve fell into step behind him, still a bit unnerved by the sound of his footsteps echoing in the cavernous great hall.  "I can just leave it with you," he offered, because it was worth a try.  "I'm sure Mr. Stark is busy."
Tony gave his head a toss.  “Yes, but on me, it looks wildly romantic.  The papers all say so,” he said, and Steve laughed, the sound muffled behind his fingers.  Tony grinned at him.  “However, your point is taken.  I’ll draw us a bath.  I’m going to regret telling Jarvis I can do it, now he’s going to make me handle it for myself from now on.  And it’s not that I can’t, it’s just he does it better.”
"I want an egg," Stark said, still caught somewhere between petulance and confusion.
Clint shrugged, and took another bite of lo mein.  “Probably,” he said.  “She'll find it amusing to mess with Jan's plans.”
Steve’s eyes were bright and warm in the firelight.  “Can I have anything?” he asked, with a soft smile.
"All right, all right," Steve said, and Stark was laughing now, a hand over his head, trying to fend off the petals.  Without thinking, Steve brought up the kite, holding it above their heads like an umbrella, like the shield he'd pretended it to be.  "I think we've killed enough flowers for the day, don't you?"
Steve extended a hand to him.  “Well, if you don't want me reading into things, maybe you need to stop with the double talk.”
"Because I think that the last option will encourage vagrants, and as much as I've always wanted my own personal Hooverville, I'm going to have to decline."
Grinning, Tony stuck out a foot, nudging a chess piece under the table. “The mess I made?” he asked.
“Yes.  My god, man, why would you even ask that question?”
“And a lot of people fighting what they consider to be a religious war,” Logan said.  “He's the pleasant face of it.  Behind him?”  He shook his head.  “Lift a rock or two, and you'll start finding the hardcore hate groups.  The kind of people who were more than happy to see their money going towards sending a very big robot after a very little girl.”
“Better than most.”  She leaned her elbows on the table, her chin braced on her folded hands.  “But they decide at last that we’d bring him out to the grasslands outside of the city, assign a few guards to keep an eye on him, and make him as uncomfortable as possible.”
“We went to Mjolnir,” Rhodey said, rubbing his temples.  “That’s where we met Clint and Natahsa.  Fury and Phil were there, too, and, uh, Maria?”
“Forgive me.” Jarvis took the seat, his hands folded neatly in his lap.  “I find it difficult to dispense with the niceties, no matter how much sense that would make.”
“I’m not expecting much, to be honest.”  Clint paused in front of an oversized booth packed from floor halfway to the ceiling with t-shirts.  “Where’s Darcy?”
“He seems to disagree.”  Natasha took a corner a little too fast, the tires squealing against the pavement.  On the other side of the windows, Steve could see the city flying past, faint ghosts of people still clinging to the edges of ruined buildings.
"I don't think there's any 'we' involved here," Rhodey said, sitting down.  "I think that's her way of telling you that you talk too much."
Tony stopped in the middle of dropping the empty bottle in Steve’s recycling bin.  “It’s fine, what are you-”  He stopped.  “Oh.  That twitter feed.”
“I will throw you off this balcony, Sam,” Steve said, through clenched teeth. “I will- Straight off.”
“And here I thought we were getting an Elvis impersonator,” the blonde said.
“Probably,” Steve said.
Steve stared down at the columns of numbers.  “He’s been investing in the stock market?”
“To open presents, and per your agreement, he has not touched a single one,” Jarvis said.  “You neglected to instruct him to remain in his bed until such time.”
He turned back to Tony, his pulse pounding in his ears.  “Are you out.  Of.  Your.  Head?” he asked, biting his words off.  Tony opened his mouth, and Steve didn’t even let him get out a single word.  “What are you doing here?”
“Jarvis won’t do that,” Tony pointed out.
“There is no way we can still get a spot, it's Christmas Eve, are you-”
"This has taken a turn," Wanda said.
DJ looked longingly at the armor.  “Want two donuts,” he said.
He moved away from the workbench, talking the entire time.  “On the shelves?  Perhaps, there’s a lot of space behind the books.  But maybe under the chairs, or-”
“You look about as tired as I feel,” Tony said, reaching for his coffee cup.  It was mostly empty, and he twisted in his chair, stretching for the coffee pot that Jarvis had left within reach.  “Coffee? I can ring Jarvis, have him bring up another cup.”
“It was check,” Tony said.  “Not mate.”  Steve heard him take a deep breath.  “Game’s not over, Steve.”
He paused by a few doors, his footsteps slowing but never stopping.  Checking on the new wife who flinched when her husband's voice raised, when he came home swaying on his feet and smelling of cheap whiskey.  On the old man who worked all hours, his back bent as he strained to finish one last button hole in the depths of the night.  On the teenage girl who had four younger siblings, and everyone was politely ignoring the fact that no one had seen their parents in a week or more.
"Don't call attention to yourself.  You've got a very tempting silhouette," Jan said, yanking a pencil out of her hair.  She scribbled a string of incomprehensible numbers on her notepad.  "Steve.  Arms UP."
“I didn't do it!” Peter said.  “I mean, I know I'm the obvious suspect, but really, he got himself into this mess.”
A tension that he didn’t even know was there bled out of him.  Steve nodded.  “Thank you,” he said, as the doors opened, and Tony twisted in his arms.  Reluctantly, Steve lowered him to the floor.
"And I'm not holding it against you, you'll notice I'm involving you in phase two, go get the paper," Stark said.  Peter stared at him, and Stark made a shooing motion.  "Paper.  String.  Glue.  We're burning daylight here, Parker."
“Again, you need to be specific about-”
“I respect you,” DJ said.
Rogers shook his head.  “You didn't pick this room,” he said, and it was disparaging.  “You didn't-”
Mrs. Arbogast caught his shoulder, her hand falling in exactly the same spot that Obie’s had.  Tony wondered why it felt completely different.  “Tomorrow,” she said, smiling just a little.
“I'd appreciate it if you could just-” Tony spread his hands.  “Clear my schedule.  Of everything.”
Isaiah’s head tipped to the side, leaning forward so he could meet Steve’s eyes.  “I know.”
“He is a very good berry picker,” Bruce said, setting his baskets down.  “Very patient, very gentle with the plants.”  He smiled at DJ, who smiled back.  “You were a big help.  Thank you.”
Her fingers slipped away, letting the weight of it settle in his hands, and his stomach dropped.  His head snapped up.  “What is this-”
“Will there be screaming?  Because, just to be clear, I’m okay with screaming,” Tony said.
Steve glanced back at her.  “She said she recognized my shield,” he said.  Tony craned his head, and Steve resisted the urge to turn the other way, keeping it out of sight.
Peter leaned out of the service window.  "He okay?" he asked, his brow furrowed.
Greer’s big, golden eyes blinked. “And I’d like to kiss you, but I’d understand if that’s not-” Her nose wrinkled.  “If that puts pressure on you.  So a kiss on the cheek if you’d like to let me down easy, and a kiss on the lips if you’d like to join me for dinner?”
“Is he still in denial?” Okoye asked Shuri.  Shuri nodded.  “How are we still having this discussion?”  She looked at Steve, her eyebrows arched.  “If not for you, I would be with the rest of the royal delegation coming directly from the port, instead of criss-crossing the entirety of this country on a horse.”  The disdain in her voice was palpable, and Steve reached out, petting Nomad’s neck in apology.  Okoye gave first him, then his horse, a speaking look.  “For that reason alone, I shall enjoy watching them clamp a crown upon your head.”
“Wait, what-” Steve started, but Carol was laughing.
“Yes,” she said, setting down a plate of pasta covered in an array of sauteed vegetables and a single,  massive meatball, then a plate piled high with garlic bread.  “Clint has everyone convinced that Tony is a very excellent Tony Stark impersonator.”
“Never thought I'd regret being anyone's favorite, but here we are,” Ellen said.  She rubbed her forehead.  “No.  We haven't gotten sued.  Or if we have, no one's told me.”  She let her hand fall to her side, and stared up at the ceiling.  “They'd tell me, right?”
Jarvis paused, his head tipped to the side.  “Are you inquiring as to what the current discussion pertains to, or what the actual argument is about?”
Her head tipped to the side.  "Tony is a futurist," she said.  "Do you know what that means?"  Steve shook his head, and she smiled.  "I think Tony made it up, actually."  She stood, collecting her cup from the table.  "A futurist is someone who attempts to determine what's coming.  A person who studies the flow of information, of money, of power, and tries to accurately predict what lies ahead.  In business, it means producing for what will be, not what is.  It means positioning ourselves so that when things change, as things always do, we're the only one who can fill a need that no one else knows exists."
“Good choice.”  She straightened up, flipping the tail of her hat over her shoulder, and continued around the page.  “Remember, we are still having a non-denominational holiday party, but Ben Grimm reminds us that his Hanukkah party at the Baxter Building is on for this weekend despite the recent…”  Her mouth pursed.  “Unpleasantness with the squid.”
“The fate of entire countries hang on the two of you,” Bucky said, leaning his shoulder against the kitchen doorway.  “May the Goddess have mercy on all of us.”  He straightened up.  “Let’s go, Princess.  I’ll walk you back to the palace.”
“The only opinion that matters is DJ’s.”
“Ah, ‘some’ is now a concrete term of measurement, I see,” Tony said, offering his hands to DJ.  DJ grabbed them, his grip firm. “Well, then. Is it time for ‘some’ swimming?”
DJ's fingers plucked at the cuffs of his shirt, something like fear floating across his features, and Tony settled back.  "Hey, it's okay," he said, and DJ's eyes snapped up to his, then back down.  Tony's fingers rattled on the bench, his mind turning over the possibilities.  He reached out, snagging a nut.  "DJ."  DJ glanced up, his eyes wary, and Tony held up the nut.  "I need the tool for this," he said, and DJ's face relaxed in an instant.
“As oblivious as Hank can be at times, I think someone will take great delight in letting him know,” Tony said.  He leaned forward, bumping his forehead against hers, something they’d done since childhood.  “You’re a menace, Van Dyne, but I know your tricks far too well.”
“God, no, I'm fucking exhausted, I haven't slept in like-” He rotated a hand in mid-air.  “Two days now?  I don't even know, it's exhausting, I'm exhausted, and it's your fault.”
“Very mature,” Jarvis said, as Steve caught Tony’s arm, tugging him into a sitting position.
“Hi,” he said, and he was trying to smile, Tony could tell that he was trying.
They were silent, both of them staring at him, their faces unreadable.  He was used to that.  He had trouble with faces, because people made their faces do things that were lies.  People smiled when they weren't really happy and they pretended they weren't angry when they were.  DJ didn't trust faces, because there was something about them, about understanding the way that the pieces fit together, that he'd never quite grasped.
Startled out of his voyeurism, Steve looked up in time to see a tall, slim man in a plain black suit come striding across the room, his well-polished black shoes beating a steady tattoo on the damp tile.  He had a briefcase  in one hand, and a faint, enigmatic smile on his face.  His dark eyes found Steve's, going narrow for an instant, and then he turned back to Stark.
Tony didn’t hear anything else.
Hammer looked at Steve.  “I would never have done it, if I’d known,” he said, his voice pleading.  “I thought we’d just…  Make some easy money and then he’d go right back where he’d been, none the worse for wear.  He was right there, it was so easy...”
He turned in Steve’s arms and gave him a lopsided smile.  “After all, you’ve had my back since we’ve met.”
Steve paused, confused by the sudden serious tone to the words.  “Jarvis?”
He grabbed the back of DJ’s shirt, dragging him to a stop.  “Caught you,” he managed, pressing a hand to his aching ribs.  A twinge of pain shot through his side, and he ignored it.  “What is this?  Are you here to steal all of my secrets?”
Something wasn’t right.
“Can’t?” Strange repeated.
The kiss tapered away, their mouths parting, separating by an inch, maybe two, still so close that Steve could feel the warmth of Tony's breath on his lips.  From a distance, he heard people applauding, heard the cheers of the people who had become his friends, become his family.
A Roomba floated past him, wobbling through the air and stopped, halfway under a table, executing a slow, easy loop.  It hovered there, swinging slowly back and forth, and then turned and moved a few feet away.  Stopped.  Rotated.  Went back.
“Did you make a quilt?” Clint said, helping Phil pull it out.  “Did you make a quilt out of the t-shirts that Phil told you to steal?”
“I, uh, I'm not sure, it's like...”  His voice trailed away.
Bobbi licked her lips, flicking away the last of the cream with the pad of her thumb.  “So sorry, Mr. Stark, but I don't babysit.”  Her eyelashes fluttered.  “Not in my job description.”
Miss Potts studied him, her face serious.  “And the others?”
Rhodey considered him, his eyebrows arched.  "Help you?"
Tony had the distinct impression that time was not passing like it should.  “Can you put that away?”
Everyone was staring at him, everyone except DJ, who was kicking his legs and grinning at the resulting flour storms.  Out of his line of sight, Pepper, pointed at DJ, her face set in a fierce frown.  Tony shrugged.  “What are you-”
“Only fair,” he whispered back. “You've been making me nuts for weeks.”
He blinked at Steve, his eyes glassy.  “Just grab the kid, that’s what I thought, just-  Just hold him for a few days, til Stark paid up, it wasn’t fair, you know, it wasn’t FAIR that he got out, and here I am, stuck here, in this-” His hand jerked up, liquor splashing out of the glass as he gestured at the room, at the building beyond it.  “Just grab the kid.  And I’d have all the money I’d ever need.”
Steve paused, the baghanging almost forgotten from one hand.  “What kind of crisis?” he asked.  He tossed the milk and cheese into the fridge and hip-checked it closed.  The rest could wait.
Tony lifted his head, just far enough to glare at Steve with one eye.  Steve bit back a smile.  "Right.  Bed."
“Jay, can you please make it stop?” Tony asked, just as the phone started its incessant, insistant litany again.  Tony glared at it.
“Thank you,” Steve popped the back door, switching places with Peter.  “Shouldn't be much, you're in the middle of a seating, but-”
Attempt six.
"What...  Is it?"
“That’s where you’re wrong,” Tony told him.  “My ego can always use a good stroking, sir, and I’ve no objection to you doing just that.” His hands went still, and his expression softened into a slight, easy smile.  “I like this one.”
He couldn’t breathe.  And it didn’t seem to matter.
“And you told him that?”
“It's oh-god-o'clock,” Tony pointed out, glancing out the front windows towards the street.  “How is-” He stopped, his attention caught by something far more interesting than the sleek black sedan idling at the curb.
“Ooo, I like this one,” Jess said, peeking over his shoulder.  She reached past him, making grabby fingers at the painting, a simple landscape he'd done from turn of the century photos of Central Park.  “Can I have it?”
Even so, Steve caught himself watching the skies through the great glass windows of the Tower lobby, and wishing he'd brought the shield.
DJ stood in a rush, the unopened bottle toppling to the carpet.  It bounced, and Darcy grabbed it, setting it on the coffee table.  DJ didn’t seem to notice.  “Yes.”
“No one calls him that,” Bobbi said, her lips twitching.  “But he is a pretty decent marksman.”
Tony waved him off.  “We’ve been through this.”
She flipped through the pages.  “But here were a few cases that I could trace back, beyond the rumors and speculation.  Police reports, a few stories in the less reputable papers, even a ballad.”  She held up a piece of sheet music.  “It’s not good.  But it’s catchy.”
“Yelling was disappointingly short lived, actually,” Moondragon said.  “Tony, when do you want to schedule your next appointment?”
“And the man who fingered him?” Steve asked.
"But people will see you-"
“If you say so, sir,” Jarvis said, and Stark looked up at the ceiling, his expression that of a man praying for patience.  Rhodes was bent forward, his head buried in his folded arms.  DJ, taking advantage of the distraction, was digging through the toolbox with a great deal of enthusiasm.  Jarvis caught his hand, pulling it away with a warm smile.  “Be careful, please.”
With a sigh, he sat up, shoving a hand through his hair and squinting at the clock next to his bed.  Too early to get up.  Which had never stopped him before, and it wasn’t going to stop him now.  He rolled out of bed, kicking the pillow into the wall with a great deal of gusto.
"You did not think this through at all, did you?" he asked, and the laughter was there, just beneath the surface, bubbling through every word.  Rogers gave him a suspicious look, and Tony grinned at him.  "You saw a way to call my bluff and you took it, and you did not really think that you'd have to do this, did you?"
Her face was pale and taut. “He can pass.  He can slip through the cracks, Steve.  He can hide, for his entire life.  He can pretend he's like everyone else, even if, if it comes out, if he does something someday, some manifestation of power-”
“Armor's supposed to stay in the workshop,” Tony said, and DJ made a face.  “Yes, yes, your life is horrible and painful and so very unfair.”
“If you are going to be Dummy, can I oil you joints?” Val asked.  She gave DJ a pleading look.  “Or if you don't want me to, I can just watch the movie.”
Seeing the door close behind them would've been depressing in a way that he didn't really want to think about.  Tony shook off the thought, bending over the piece of machinery he was working on.  He could almost remember what he was doing, and he paused, rubbing a hand over his face.  “Focus, Stark,” he muttered.  “So you're alone.  That's fine.  You've been alone before.  You've done this alone before.”  He reached for a set of wire cutters.  “And you're going to be doing this alone for a long time to come.  Best you get used to that now, no matter how depressing it is.”
“I like not having your father murder me when he inevitably shows up to find you in a plastic miniskirt,” Tony said, his voice dire.  “So let’s just put that back, and Jarvis has found us a place to sleep, so anyone making bad decisions with Clint’s credit card, head to the register.  I’ll meet you at the car.”
Steve took a cautious sip.  “Why not?  It’s great.”
There were definitely downsides to being a futurist.
"Excuse me?" he asked, his voice polite.
Tony smiled.  “Yes, I scared myself a little bit, too.”  He pulled his hand back, letting it fall to the blankets next to him.  “I’m sorry.  That was cruel of me.”
Tony nodded.  “Would Steve?”
"And that means everyone is in one place."  She studied her notes.  "Peter, get off the ceiling."
“So did we.  Enough to form  a theory,” she said.  “A good, working theory.  Not to hard to test it, either.”
"Oh, my GOD," Tony said.  "Jarvis, why-"  He waved a hand at the screen.  "Why.  Just..."  His mouth worked soundlessly for a moment.  "WHY?"
Steve bit his lip to keep from laughing.  “Right,” he said, trying his best to sound like he was taking this seriously.  He pulled a sweatshirt from the storage bin, giving it a quick shake before holding it out to Tony.  “Here.”
A little hand crept out from under the workbench, fingers tugging on the paper, dragging in the pencil towards the edge.  Struggling not to laugh, Tony ducked down.  “Got you,” he said, meeting DJ’s eyes from the other side of the workbench.  “Where are my tools, you little urchin?”
She sat up, little by little, Clint supporting her the whole way until she was upright.  “No,” she said.  She reached up, her fingers brushing against the tacky blood on her hairline. “Not...  Not really.”  She looked up.  “I don't think I am.”
DJ picked up his juice box.  “Who does have control?” he asked
“Yes.  Yes, it is,” Tony said.  He pressed a hand to his eyes. “A very large balance.  And a very specific balance.  He was aiming for that number.”
Ellen managed to balance everything as she got into the elevator, and stabbed the button for her floor with her elbow. There were crumbs on her chest, and she brushed at them with the back of her wrist. Which might have helped, or might've just ground the grease into her shirt. She wasn't really sure.
She came to a stop in front of him, her arms crossed over her chest, her chin up, her cheeks flushed.  “I asked one thing of you recently,” she corrected herself.  She leaned in, and Tony leaned back, all the way back.  “I asked you, very politely, not to seduce our guest.”
“And?” Sam asked.
DJ nodded.  “Still want to go?”
Tony smiled back.  “Yes, sir.”
It was always going to end this way.  Steve had known, from the beginning, that it was always going to end this way.
Tony groaned, his whole body aching.  “It absolutely is not,” he said, and was that really his voice?  He coughed, rubbing a hand over his face.  “When did the party end?  Or start?”
“Grandpa, don't mess with another man's oven,” the teenager said.  “Really.  What are you doing?”
“Do you want a dog, Parker?  Is that what this is all about?”  Tony slapped the file folder against his leg.  “Because I can get you a dog.”
“We got our wedding picture taken!” Darcy said, leaning around Clint to thrust it through the open car window.
“Not working,” Harris said, because it was absolutely working.
“And many a lie has been made more palatable by a gathering of friends and kin,” Thor agreed.
“And the fact that catering for us is something they can put on their website isn’t a bad deal, either,” Greer said, her voice silken, and Jan’s nose wrinkled.
“No, sir,” Jarvis said.  To Mrs. Parker, he said, “Of course.  I take it you’re not alone?”
The word was sharp, hard, and Tony’s head swung around.  Obie was sitting in one of his leather arm chairs, his hands folded in his lap, his head tipped forward over the tip of his cigar.  The glowing tip cut through the soft cloud of white smoke that wreathed his face.  Tony gave him a smile.  It wasn’t returned.  “Yes?”
“Look, we don't have to get into the reasons WHY I'm banned, it's completely unimportant, the only thing that mattes is that I am going to go stir crazy if I have to sit here and watch SHIELD grunts make a ruin of my plane, and we've got a day pass in our passports.  Wanna hit the town?"  He tucked his hands in his pockets.  "We're dressed for it."
“Thought you’d be fighting,” DJ said.
It took a moment, but Bruce nodded.  “Good work,” he said, scraping a hand over his face.  “What time is it?”
But when his eyes slid over them, there was something flat and disdainful in their depths. He gave Steve a smile, his capped white teeth flashing. “Captain. Thanks so much for including me in your invitation. I'm...” His smile stretched. “Honored.”
“But the guy I talked to last night said they'd managed to pay for the marriage licenses for eighty-nine couples yesterday, and yeah.”  She flopped over to the side to point at the picture.  “If you look in the background, you can see the priest?  So these two got married.  I mean.  Pretty sure they did.  The licenses that the couples signed will be official record today, so we'd have to check with the town hall to check and see.”
It would be so easy to make this about sex.  Tony had done it before.  So many times.  Too many.  He could do it in his sleep by now, and it worked, that was why he hated it.  It worked.
"Ready?" she said, her hair arranged in a complicated swirl of curls, an arrangement of real lilies tucked along her hairline.
“Oh.”
“Yeah,” Tony agreed.  “And in the off season, it's nothing but 'rest of it.'”  Steve heard him shift, the chair in his office squeaking as he leaned forward.  Steve let his eyes close, wishing he was there, sprawled out on Tony's couch, bathed in the warm scent of bread baking and Bruce's herbal experiments.  He loved the battered leather couch, loved the way that Tony muttered to himself as he scowled at his invoices, loved the soft sound of the eighties radio station that the prep team played before the rest of the staff came in.
“I do not,” Clint started, and Nebula cut him off.
Sam nodded.  “You know that Shuri would’ve fixed it for you, don’t you?” he asked.  “Hell, something like that, anyone could’ve-”
"Yes," Steve said, almost at the same time.
Steve heaved a sigh.  “Why are you trying to comfort me?” He slanted a look in Sam's direction.  “You have to deal with a lot more of this than I do.”
“I'm not going to be-”
“Nothing is,” Okoye said.  “Like a boat with no rudder.  You end up where ever the tides take you.”  She shook her head, the tiniest flick of her chin.  “A king cannot follow an uncharted path.”
He nudged Steve to the side with a flicker of his elbow.  “Give me just-”  He pulled a handkerchief from his pocket, the white fabric already stained here and there with streaks of oil and dust.  “I can-” He looked at Steve.  “If you don’t mind?”
“There is a…  A lady here, Mr. Stark, and she says she’s here to see you and is asking to be announced.”
Others will see the islands large and small;
And he was absolutely not doing that again.  No matter how much he wanted to, and oh, God, did he want to.
“Please, don’t bother.”  Obie braced his hands on the back of the chair, his fingers flexing for a moment before he straightened up.  “I know it’s too early for this kind of thing, but I need something a bit stronger.”
A slight tap on the door behind them, and he and Rhodey turned, just in time to see Natasha slip through the door.  “How’s Peter?” she asked, her voice pitched low as she glanced across the room.  May met her eyes, her face strained, and Natasha shook her head.  Tony watched May’s shoulders slump and wanted to punch something, anything.
The man’s head dipped in a nod.  “And what’s the magic word?”
"We washed it!" Peter said.  Tony looked at him.  "We gave it a really..." He gave Tony a very confident smile.  "Thorough bath."
“I'm just going to let you deal with that,” Carol said.  Jan made a whining noise.  “C'mon, Jess, let's put what's left of his shirts into some boxes before Jan finds some lighter fluid.”
“I'm aware, can we not-”
“That’s a little closer to the truth,” Rhodey said.
Luke took his hand with a grin.  “Thought you'd never ask, Cap.”
“Because Coulson is surprisingly susceptible to your bullshit, and Director Fury hasn't stopped laughing since he heard the news,” Maria said with a pleasant smile.  “And despite my best efforts, the American public still associates you with SHIELD.”  Her smile got very thin.  “So that makes you, and this, my problem.”
“I have expectations,” Tony said.  “Plans are a little harder.”  He smiled.  “I think we can just wing it, can't we?”
The photographer swung her camera over her shoulder. “You going to the green room?” she asked.
Giving up, Steve put his phone on speaker and reached for a washcloth.  “Nope.”
Greer shoved the catering menus aside.  “Can we just get takeout?” she asked.  One bare foot was braced on the seat of her chair, her arm braced on her upthrust knee.  Today she had paired her shorts with an oversized, fuzzy green sweater, and occasionally, she would scrunch up into the rolled fabric of the high neck, until only her eyes were visible over the edge.
Tony’s fingers flexed in a ‘come here’ sort of gesture.  “Let’s find out, shall we?”
Logan sank down into a seat between Clint and Thor.  “Foreign exchange student,” he drawled.  "Bonjour."
Across the desk from him, Clint sat silently for a moment, then he shifted in his chair, scooting it against the carpet with a noise that made Phil grit his teeth.  His fingers flexed on his pen, the tip digging into the paper.  Clint jerked the chair forward again, and Phil paused.  “Are you actively trying to be annoying right now?”
Tony nodded.  “Right.”  The tablet clattered to the workbench, and he rubbed both hands over his face.  “Right.”
Clint smiled.  “He's hitting his teenage years, Steve.  It's...”  He rubbed the back of his neck, his head lolling forward.  “It's gonna be fun.”
“That's a mistake, 'Buck naked baking' is a wild trip,” Ellen said.
Tony's nose wrinkled, the smell of roasted peppers and spicy meat hitting him with enough force to bring his head up.  "What do you-"
“Because it’s a choice, not a prison,” Iron Man snapped.  “He controls it.  That’s how this works.  He has control over the damn armor, so yes.  He’s got a way to get out of it, if he needs to.”  The helmeted face tipped forward, blank and emotionless.  “And.  Again.  He’s not supposed to do that.”
Harris’ head fell back, and he stared at the ceiling.  “DJ.”
Steve stared across the studio. Tony was leaning against a console, his arms crossed over his chest, his expression amused. Steve loved him so much it hurt.
"Yes, ma'am," Steve said, as Natasha set a pot of water next to him.
“And you should’ve sent Happy,” Steve said.   “They might be after money, or they might just be after you.”  He hated this force inactivity, hated sitting here, next to Tony but separated from him, somehow.  “Taking him would be the fastest way to get to you.”
Tony groaned.  “No,” he told her.
Steve struggled against a smile.  “Oh, do you?”
“Dummy, I’m going to need you to change the sign,” Tony said, not looking up from his work.  “It’s now been zero days since Agent Coulson told us that we have a problem.”  He squinted down at the incredibly delicate electrical circuit he was working on.  “We didn’t quite make the record of eleven days set when Clint dragged him on vacation last year.”
“Has he been on the internet?” Tony asked, and he knew the answer before he even asked the question.
Her head came up and she looked at the sky, her hands tucked in her pockets, her body pushing forward into the slight wind.  “But it doesn’t matter, does it?  Even if I find the man who held the gun that day, there’s a dozen, a hundred more willing to pick it up before his body even hits the floor.
Steve grinned back.  “Did you think I wouldn’t?”
“And yet, here I am!” Bucky said, with a broad shrug.  “And I can outride you, so here I’ll stay.”
Tony made a sound that still made Steve blush even now, low and raw and full of pleasure.  His eyes opened, just a little, and he was laughing, his cheeks flushed.  "I live here now," he said.
There was no response, and for a long moment, he just sat there, rocking DJ back and forth, swaying a bit in his seat, until DJ's grip on his shoulders started to relax.  “Okay, buddy?  We okay?”
“An excellent use of your time, sir.”
The door to the hotel lobby opened behind him.  “What’re you two doing out here?” Steve asked, stepping out onto the sidewalk with them.
He realized he was walking in that direction.  “Yes?”
T’Challa took a step back, gesturing at Shuri.  “May I present her royal highness, the crown princess Shuri?”
Steve realized he was smiling down at his shoes.  "It was ONE TIME," he managed, and Sam punched him in the shoulder.
“Don’t tempt me,” Tony said.  He reached out, snagging Harris by the back of his jacket.  “And you.  Stop trying to put yourself in front of me.”
Tony’s lips stilled on Steve’s, and he turned his head to the side.  DJ was standing over them, an oversized red hat pulled low over his forehead, his jacket trailing behind him from one hand.  Tony cleared his throat.  “Hi,” he said.
Tony smiled back at him.  “Your truck my curb, your recipes sneaking into my rotation.  I look up and you're doing prep work with my staff, I go out for a drink at night and you're holding a stool for me over at Mjolnir.”
“My ma used to give me Jell-O when I was sick,” Steve said.  “But she wouldn't, it wouldn't be solidified.”  Hitomi's eyebrows arched, and Steve grinned.  “When I've got a cold, drinking liquid lime Jell-O is still my comfort food.”
"Better than nothing.  Go."
“So.  You had a busy night.”
"He can't, Ed made him latte art," Mackenzie said.  She shook her head, her arms crossed over her chest.  "You're an asshole, Ed."
Steve's throat worked, but before he could manage to form a word, Rhodes filled the silence.  “He was assigned to escort us this morning.  As soon as Happy's back, I'm going to drive him back to the city.”
Each hotel, each property, each sign, each spot had its own pattern, its own purpose, its own design.  But when combined as a whole, it was chaos, and DJ could’ve stared at it forever, and been happy.
Rogers choked on his wine, and Tony grinned at him.  The man was bright red, from the tips of his ears, all the way down his neck.  For a bit of innuendo, it was overkill, but Tony almost wanted to see what would happen with some real dirty talk.
*December 25th*
Steve glanced at the coffee pot on the kitchen counter.  It was steaming, the pot full and ready to be poured.  “And he fell asleep waiting for the coffee to brew, huh?” he asked, affection blooming in his chest, warmth flooding over him.
Obie fished his pocket watch out of his vest, squinting down at the face.  “Actually, I have a meeting,” he said, his voice jovial.  “So I'll leave you to it.”  He gave the boy a considering look.  “Talk to May,” he said to Pepper.  “I've got the press coming by to get some pictures, but I'd like him to be a bit more...”  He wobbled a hand through the air.  “Let's aim for presentable.  Nothing too fancy, all right?”
There was a long moment of silence.  Then, Jess said “Ouch” in a very small voice, and Tony had to bite the inside of his lip to keep from laughing.
Steve twisted around on the seat, his helmet braced on his hip.  He grinned up at Tony, holding out a second helmet.  “Hop on.”
“Poster sized.  I’m…  I’m re-wallpapering my house,” Tony said.
DJ's eyes went wide, and Steve grinned at him.  “I can do that,” he said.  “Want me to help you find a-”  Before he could even finish the sentence, DJ was up and running towards the house.  Steve leaned back, laughing under his breath. “I guess that's a no.”
“Welcome,” DJ said.  He nodded.  “Good night.”
“I wouldn’t have gone to all that trouble to dress him if I hadn’t seen the way he looked at you,” Jan said.  She held her hands out to Tony, and he wrapped his hands around her narrow waist, giving her a boost off of the workbench and down to the floor.  She braced her hands on his shoulders, steadying herself until she was back on her feet.  As soon as she was, her hands slid down to straighten his vest.  “I like him.”  Her eyes canted up towards Tony’s.  “Does he know?”
“As I don’t see that as the basis of a lifelong commitment or even a particularly good short term investment, I have gently declined the offer,” Tony said.
“I love you.”
“You’re coming back to the house,” Natasha said, and Steve felt goosebumps pop up along his arms.
Tony’s mouth opened.  Closed.  He stepped back, into the shelter provided by the side of the curving stairs.  There, in the shadows, he was almost invisible, two sides blocked entirely and only one good angle for an attacker to manipulate.  He spread his hands.  “Better?”
"Because we're teaching Steve to dance," Natasha said, boosting herself onto the top of the pommel horse.
“Thank you for the movie, Mr. Stark,” they chorused.  It almost sounded sincere.
“Most things are,” Tony said, working at a stubborn screw.  “At least as far as you’re concerned.”  He glanced over at DJ, who was organizing his extensive array of screwdrivers by size.  “Which one’s your favorite?”
Steve considered it.  “Seems rude,” he admitted, and she laughed.
"I can do that, sir," Jarvis called from DJ's room, and Steve shook his head.
Sam grinned as he set the teapot aside and took a sip of tea, exhaling over the surface.  “God, you sound remarkably like my Grandmother.”
Tony looked out the window.  The trellis stretched to the ground, a seemingly impossible distance below them.  “I know he’s a climber, but he wouldn’t…”  His voice trailed away.  He looked at Steve.  “Would he?”
Tony winced.  “Sent you plenty of texts, though.”
“I’ve scrubbed,” Steve said.  He shifted, bracing his arms on the sides of the tub.  “There’s only so much scrubbing a man can do.”
Tony’s head rolled to the side, and DJ was there, his face pale.  Happy was holding him, singing a soft, rough Irish lullaby, his hand cupping the side of DJ's head.  Tony tried to focus, tried to think.
“I love you, I miss you, and I’m going to need you to check in with me in the morning,” Steve said.
Tony looked at the kid, who was looking around the interior of the plane with an expression of faint curiosity.  “Never have,” he said.
“You're a disaster,” Tony told him.  “And this is me talking.  This is Anthony Stark saying, you are a walking human tire fire.”
“You enjoyed that, didn’t you?” Darcy asked with a grin.
And then he started running, pushing DJ in front of him like a wheelbarrow.
Steve sighed as Bucky dropped his tankard to the table and crossed in front of Steve to retrieve his pot from the fire.  “I don’t see anyone letting you starve,” Steve said, trying to keep his voice flat. “You’re-”  He pinched the bridge of his nose.  “Shuri.  You can’t stay here.”
“Right, am I paying for this?” he asked, grinning.
Clint looked at it.  “Yep.  And I bet it’s still accurate.”  He took it from DJ, and tucked it into his pocket.  “We can go and find out.”
There was a flash of light, and a crash of noise, people and voices, and DJ’s heartbeat spiked, stress making him dizzy for a second. He rocked forward, his hands over his ears, trying to fight back against the wave of anxiety.
“I’d say that’s extremely conservative,” Tony said.
Jan took it away from him.  "Mostly.  We're missing a few here and there.  Mostly ones we were expecting."  She squinted at the fork, checking it for fingerprints before putting it back in place.  “Stephen Strange is always a question mark, no one even knows what plane of existence he's inhabiting on any given day, and Sue says that her pack are coming, but Reed's unreliable at best.”
"He would not shut up about how cold his damn feet were," Bucky mumbled.  He rolled over, throwing a leg over the back of the couch and almost kicking Steve in the shoulder.  "Had to shut him up somehow."
Rogers squeezed his eyes shut.  “I think there's a pillow and blanket missing from the bed,” he said.  “But his things are still here.  He wasn't trying to leave, he was trying to find someplace to hide.”  He looked at the window, his profile lit with sunshine.  “It was cold last night.  I doubt he left the house.”
Steve frowned down at the ends of his tie. “I hate these things.”
“Get yourself home, it’s late,” Steve said, because he couldn’t quite stop the words.  The boy gave him a look, but still nodded, darting down the street and around the corner.  Steve reached for the passenger side door.  “What hospital?”
The sudden shriek of an alarm echoed in the armor's helmet, drowning out whatever Gyrich was saying, and all of a sudden, Tony didn't care.  Because the robot had finally slowed, one great hand coming up.  “Target identified,” it rumbled.  “Target identified.  Surrender.”
"No, but Howard had been marching you in front of the press and the public since you were born, so..."  Steve stared at him, unsure why the answer mattered as much as it did.  "How old?"
"Hasn't killed me yet, so-"
"Okay, I would've, but I would've called you something else."  Tony blinked at him.  "Like 'Sport.'"
But Tony was quick on the uptake, his mouth softening against Steve's, and Steve was pretty sure he was smiling into the kiss, because if that was possible, Tony could do it.  His hands smoothed up Steve's chest, and Steve shivered, pushing closer, crowding him back against the table.  His hand was still cradling Tony's jaw, his cheek, and he didn't know what to do with the other one.  He hadn't felt this awkward and out of place in his own skin since the serum, and kissing Tony wasn't that different than crashing through a plate glass window, anyway.
Because when Tony went more than a month without a visible hookup, the press started asking questions that were awkward for everyone involved.
Steve let out a breath. “Thanks,” he said.  His tongue flicked out, moistening his lips.  “I...”
Stark blinked down at DJ.  DJ blinked back up at him.  “I thought Jarvis was watching you,” he said.  He leaned one hand on the side of the car, bracing the other on his hip.  He seemed more curious than anything else, as if DJ was a strange, unfamiliar species that had somehow made it into his house.  “You're a sneaky one, aren't you?”
He paused.   “Not many people living here, then, but know what?  Three or four people seem like a lot when they’re all armed.”
“Hello!” he said, to the woman behind the table.  He pointed at the box of masks.  “How much?”
And he was doing his best not to let the last, unravelling strands slip through his fingers.
May didn’t even look in that direction.  “No,” she said, with such firm certainty that Steve choked on a laugh.  May smiled at him.  “In this case, the devil I don’t know is better than the devil I do.”
She grinned at DJ around him.  “Heist,” she mouthed, and DJ grinned back at her.
Obie leaned forward, his elbows braced on his knees.  Tony decided to ignore the way his cigar dripped ashes across the carpet.  “Anthony.  Have you considered what you’re going to do when his parents show up to collect him?”
“I mean, yes,” Steve said, meaning it.  “That’s… Pretty much always.”
Eli eyed Tony, a faint smile on his face.  “Yeah, think you're going to have your hands full with that one.”  He grabbed the kettle and crossed to the sink, filling it with the ease of someone who knew the layout.
“Oh, trust me, Officer Rogers, you will be the first one I come to, from now on,” Pepper said.
Steve reared up, cupping a hand on the back of Tony’s neck.  “Stay here,” he said, his voice tight.  “Let me find out who’s after you.”
“Dummy, did you finish-”
Rogers paused halfway across the workshop.  “Yes,” he said, exasperated.  “This is where I left you.  Two hours ago.”
“His heart is going to explode and I’d like to stave that off for a few years,” Steve pointed out.  “And he was huddled behind Sam’s counter, his feet braced against the far cabinets.  Eating cheese fries with his bare hands.”
"Wonderful."  Steve reached out to ruffle his hair and felt the fabric of the jacket pull taut.  He straightened up before he could split a seam. “Ready for dinner?”
Tony's fingers touched his, and Steve turned his palm up so that Tony could grasp his hand.  “Tell me-”  He stopped.  “Nothing.  I don't need anything.  This is fine.”
She held the phone out to him. “Unlock it or deal with this problem yourself.”
“I make no promises,” Tony said, snuggling down into the couch with a cough.  “I'd move fast, if I were you.”
Steve looked up.  “What?”
“I wonder that every single day.”  Pepper's fingernail clicked against the tablet's surface.  “So, may I have your boyfriend's address so that I'm not forced to spend the entire night distracting you from clubbing Bobby Flay over the head with an ice sculpture again?”
“That’s a rock solid certainly,” Jessica said, picking up a baby carrot from her plate.  “I’m fine with it.”  She looked at Steve. “God knows I’m not capable of doing the emotional heavy lifting in this relationship.”
“Which most of us have read,” Okoye amended.  “And which others are willing to judge, based in its cover.”
Steve burst out laughing, his head falling to Tony’s shoulder.  Tony grinned at nothing in particular, stroking Steve’s hair with one hand.  “Less laughing, more groping,” he said, his voice light.
“No, seriously, it's 2017, it's not my fault if they're still repressed,” Clint said.  “Your attraction to men aside, if you haven't at least tried shoving something up your butt, that's your own problem, and it's a problem I don't have.  Like, sorry you're so freaked out by the idea of being thought of as gay that your prostate doesn't get to have a good time, but that's really your problem, and you need to get over it.”
Tony took a deep breath.  “I know we will,” he said.  “I have to-  I have to believe that, because otherwise, I’m-” He laughed, and there was very little humor to it.  “I’m going to lose it.”
Steve’s foot hit the ground with a thud. “Why was Tony texting you?” he asked.
Steve Rogers was sitting in the visitor's chair next to Duck's desk, a tea cup and saucer held in one bit hand.
“The rumors are spreading.  It’s all tangled up,” Nicholas said, bracing his hands on the table.  “There’s an old legend, you know.  That when the times are dark, when hope is faltering, a lost king will come down from the mountains to reclaim his throne.”
Jarvis's head tipped back, his eyes narrowed in consideration.  He reached out and straightened the silk square in Tony's pocket, his fingers flicking the fabric into place. "Always, sir," he said, a faint smile hovering at the corners of his mouth.  He took a step back, slipping his watch from his pocket.  "And right on time."
"I was in college, and it was the least of my scandals at the time," Tony said.  He pushed himself upright.  "I was used to it.  Like you said.  Lots of experience."
“Ain’t talking to you!” Bucky yelled, and Steve grinned at nothing in particular.  Bucky glanced at him.  “Please let me kill him.”
“No,” Steve said.  He reached out, pushing the shirt back so he could check Tony’s bandages.
"Slander and lies," Tony said.  "And I'm grieving, there's grief involved, Tater Tots, because I'll never get to see Steve's door in its current state.”
“I had thought so as well, as it turns out, I was incorrect,” Stephen said with a tight smile.  “As you might find you are.”
"Not before dinner," Thor said, grinning.
Stark's eyebrows arched.  "You...  Went to art school?" he asked at last.
“No!” he managed, struggling to pull away, but Steve’s arms tightened, holding him in place.  He kicked feebly at the air, choking on a laugh.  “No, I am not-  No!”
“Absolutely not,” Rhodey said.  “Because the favor’s going to be figure out which of Rogers’ feet should be the right one.”
“Why do I try?” Pepper asked the ceiling.
Steve slipped through the gate, pulling it shut behind him.  It creaked, the hinges resisting him as he wrestled it back into place.  Steve made a mental note of that as he headed up the path to the door.  “Hey, Buck,” he said, stepping into the cottage.  “Do we have any-”
“Hello,” DJ said, adjusting the strap of his backpack higher up on his shoulder.
Steve lunged forward, leaping up to catch the bottom of the railing.  In one fast, smooth movement he threw himself up and over the railing and onto the balcony, his free hand making a desperate grab for Tony.  His fingers closed on the fabric of Tony’s shirt an instant before Tony crashed into him, the full weight of his body falling against Steve’s.
“Itadakimasu.” Peter reached for the chopsticks.  “Can I have an extra egg?”
“And should that come to pass, I shall of course be happy to handle the task, sir.”  Jarvis tucked the tray under his arm, leaning over to peer into the face of the clock.  “Hmm.  I take it that it is keeping good time?”
“Dressing for dinner, sir, as should we all,” Jarvis told him.  “If you would head down to the sitting room, then we can-”
“Like Steve,” DJ said, grinning at him.
Tony leaned up against the truck, his arms crossed over his chest.  “I’m hurt, I’m just trying to show my unending support for-”
Steve shrugged again.  “I know you have questions,” he said, “And I know I have no answers for you.”
Tony considered his shoes.  “Yes,” he said, resigned.
“Then we’ll figure it out together.”  His father shifted forward, and DJ caught a glimpse of the arc reactor's glow beneath his shirt, clear and comforting.
It seemed perfectly natural for Tony to slide his arms around Steve's waist from behind.  Leaning into Steve's back, he was hyperaware of the weight of the arc reactor in the center of his chest.  He shifted, trying to put some space between them, and Steve's hand gripped his wrist, tugging him closer.  “Hold on tight,” he said, and some of the tension went out of Tony's shoulders.
"Oh my God, am I that early?" Maya came dashing past him, around the end of the counter and towards the stockroom, the tails of her coat flapping in her wake.  "I cannot be that early."
“No, they have a strawberry cream puff covered with a a mocha chocolate glaze,” Agatha said, cheese coiled neatly in her spoon, “and nine wastes of calories.”
"She might not be able to, but I can, so..."  Steve gave Tony a look.
DJ scrubbed a hand across his nose.  “Might help?”
“Better you than me,” Tony said.  He looked like he had a headache.  “Deej, do you really trust this clown car’s worth of wizards to handle this?”’
Tony paused, looking back down at the hall, where the two of them were sitting, silhouetted against the flames.  DJ was leaning against Steve’s side, and as Tony watched, Steve smoothed a hand over DJ’s hair, soft and gentle.  “And she always told me, never go down beneath the hill.  Never walk paths not meant for your feet.  Never let your name be whispered, by voices who tempt you to follow them down.  Down.  Down."
“That’s nice of you,” Tony said.
“I-”  Her lips worked, and Clint shook his head.
“Guess you are,” Sam agreed.  “I’ll make sure they don’t leave without you.”
“You’ll find I’m full of them.”
Clint folded his arms on the edge of Phil’s desk.  “I ask, ‘cause you seem annoyed.”
“Mostly because I was always in trouble,” Tony said.  “No matter what I did, my father found a way to disapprove of it.”
Her lips curled up.  “I saw that.”  She waited until he swallowed, then broke the scone in half and handed him the larger piece.  “I know we planned to run through your routine today,” she said, before taking another sip of her latte.  “And maintaining your schedule is important.”
Nakia folded her hands in her lap. “Shuri,” she said, her tone holding just the faintest hint of disapproval.  Steve glanced at Sam, who met his glance with the tiniest shake of his head.
“How about a movie?” Peter said.  “Movies are great.”  He picked up another cookie.  “DJ, have you ever been to a movie?”
“Hey, who's leading here?” he asked, and she smiled up at him.
"But otherwise, spot on," Steve said.
“Don't you apologize for me,” the old man grumbled, and there was another clatter, of racks and pans and god only knew what else.  “Eli, get over here and stir this glaze for me.”
"No," Tony said, and Steve started to laugh.  Tony pinned him with a withering glare.  "No.  Absolutely not.  That database is packed to the gills with Jess's recordings of 'Project Runway'-"
“That’s the conclusion I’ve reached as well,” Steve said, smiling back.  Sam walked past again, arms piled high with pots.  “He’s stealing my furniture now, though, so, that’s going to be a problem.”
“What?” Hank glanced up.  All at once, he seemed to be aware that everyone was looking at him.  “Oh.  No?”
“Yes, yes, he can,” Steve said.  He leaned back, glancing in Tony’s direction as he loaded bins into the refrigeration unit.  “Stop trying to take him to fancy places, Tony.”
“Sir.” Jarvis took a sip of his drink.
“Doesn’t matter.”
“You’re welcome.  Yes,” Bucky said, straightening up.  He nodded towards the door.  “Let’s go.”
“Good.  Me, too.”  Tony lead the way out of the lounge, matching his steps to DJ’s.  Letting him set the pace.  Outside the door, the usher was still waiting, his face tense, his shoulders tight.  As soon as Tony pushed the door open, he sprang to attention.
Steve gave a wry laugh.  “Think I ate more in this meal than I have in the last month, ma'am.”
Tony’s bed was the biggest piece of furniture that Steve had ever seen.  It seemed, at first glance, to be bigger than any rooms he’d ever rented, and for the first time in years, he could stretch out to his full height, his full reach.  When his fingers clawed at the linens, desperate for something to hold onto when his head was swimming with pleasure, he hadn’t even come close to finding the edge.  His heels digging into the mattress, his back arching, his face buried in pillows, trying to hide the flush he was sure was visible in his cheeks, he never found anything but more space.  More room.
“I can talk to him and drive,” Tony said, his voice coming from a distance, and the sound of blaring horns in the background put lie to that.  Tony yelled something, and Steve was pretty sure that was an obscenity.  “Give me the phone, Parker.”
“Where is she?” Tony interrupted.
Light pressed against his eyelids, and he shifted, burying his face in the pillow.  It smelled good.  Everything smelled good, even through his stuffed up nose.  Coffee.  Bread.  Bacon.  Something sweet, and sharp, the citrus tang catching on his tongue every time he inhaled.
“Also because it would be very funny,” Jan said, her legs swinging in mid-air.  “But yes.  Mostly to annoy the old prig.”
Jarvis nodded, an inquisitive look on his face.  "Of course, sir."
“Well, I think that would result in you eating every meal from that bowl for the rest of your life,” Jarvis said.  “As we both know after thirty seconds of looking at china patterns for a replacement, your eyes will glaze over and you’ll decide that your meals are best served out of the nearest bucket.”
"So, I'm guessing gay rights protest?" Tony asked, grinning.  A teenager wearing a mask along with his patched, ragged jeans and well-worn t-shirt darted out of the crowd, grabbing Tony's arm.  He said something, his smile brilliant, and then pressed a kiss to Tony's cheek.  Laughing, he dashed away again, the glitter in his hair gleaming as he disappeared into the crowd.  Tony grinned after him.  "Very amiable protest, but yes."  He was laughing when he looked in Steve's direction.  “Maybe a little bit gay.”
“Literally,” Steve said.  He rubbed his eyes.  “Moving in tomorrow.”
“I don’t care,” Jan sing-songed.  “Try a macaron.”
“Yeah, but I'm not sure I'm sharing those,” Steve said, his voice full of laughter.  The wind kicked up, and his pale hair flopped over his forehead. “That's my offer, Stark.”
“I, uh-  I-”  Tony turned and looked at him.  Peter pointed at Jessica.  “She ate it,” Peter said, and Tony looked at Jessica.  She met his eyes over the top of Peter’s massive burrito, her cheeks puffed out like a hamster’s.
“I am hungry, did we eat?” Tony asked Rhodey.
“No.  You crash planes into the ocean.  You're famous for it,” Tony told him.
He closed his eyes.  It wouldn't hurt to rest.  Just for a few minutes.
"And that's why I'm here," Sam said.
“TONY!”
“Yeah, Pepper made her cry last month, and she wasn't even trying, I... Do not care about her,” Tony said.
“We shouldn't have left it so long as is.”  The door was pushed open, and a shot, thin woman in a black dress and white apron came bustling in, her arms overloaded with packages.  Without even thinking, Steve moved, crossing over to take the boxes from her.  She smiled at him, her dark eyes bright behind a tiny pair of wire rimmed glasses.  “Oh, aren't you a sweet boy?” she said, as Steve relieved her of her burden.
It wasn’t much, and yet, it was everything.  Steve took it with a smile.
“The premiums, my brother pays,” Thor said, grinning ear to ear.  “Since the last two increases were most certainly his fault, we decided it was best if he were responsible for them.”  He crossed his arms over his chest.  “I’m sure he’ll have something to say about the bills, but I have little interest in listening.:
“With all due respect, my lord, I don't know if you could handle her,” Rogers said.
A moment later, he set a second cup next to the first one.  He could try a little cautious optimism.
“There's that learning from experience thing again,” Tony mused, and stepped off the elevator to his doom.
Bracing his back against the wall, he dug his phone out of his pocket.  There were half a dozen text notifications, and he ignored every one of them without so much as a second thought.  He’s pay for that later, he just knew it, but at the moment, he really didn’t care.
"Okay."  Steve braced his hands on his thighs.  Tony slumped back against the cabinets, his chest heaving with the force of his breathing.  Other than that, there was no indication of movement.  Steve sighed.  "We have a timeline for when you're going to do it?"
Bruce tipped Peter’s head up, and Tony’s teeth locked together.  The kid’s face was already swelling up, bruising spreading across his cheek and temple.  He looked miserable, and having dealt with a head injury or two himself, Tony had an idea of just how much Peter’s head hurt right now.
DJ nodded.  “There are schemes.  And betting pools.  I’m not supposed to know about either of those, but everyone talks so loud all the time.”
Jan tossed her hair back with a flick of one hand.  “That’s true,” she said, sounding proud of herself.  “I have, I enjoyed it, and I’m likely to do it again.”  She braced her hands on the edge of the workbench and gave a quick hop, boosting herself up to perch on the edge of the workspace.  “You’re the one determined to ruin my good time.”  She gave Steve a gamine grin.  “A few years ago, Officer, Tony would’ve eagerly gone along with my prank.”
He just hated that it worked on him, too.
DJ's fingers flexed on his blanket.  “Okay,” he said.  He looked up at Clint.  “Okay.”
“They’re not going to take it back,” Tony said, taking a piece of bacon for himself.  As soon as he selected it, Harris snatched it out of his hand.  Unconcerned, Tony picked up another one.  “It’s been altered, Harris.  They’ll still charge me, and then they’ll, I don’t know.” He waved the bacon through the air like a baton.  “Probably throw it away.”  He saw Harris flinch, and struggled to keep a straight face.  “But that’s fine.  Maybe it’ll go to GoodWill or something, and someone who happens to be your exact height and weight will-”
Steve realized he was turning an apple in his hands.  He stilled his fingers with a force of will.  “I’m sorry.”
“You don’t know, do you?” Steve asked.
Pepper gave him a sympathetic look.  "Steve.  You're not..."  Her mouth went thin.  "You tend to tell the truth in interviews.  Which is an admirable quality, really, it is-"
“Okay, so she went to boarding school with me, but that doesn’t change the fact that she’s good at her job,” Jan said, her voice arch.
Tony tipped his head forward, looking over the top of his sunglasses down at him.  “Security breach,” he said, just to hear Steve laugh.  “How the hell did you get in here?  I have security, clearly it's not very good security, but still, there's-”
Tony scanned the data streaming across the HUD.  “Actually, it's doing quite a bit.” He banked hard to the side, sweeping a wide arc in front of the robot.  “Hey there, Stampy.  Come here often?”
"He holds a grudge, it's true," Tony said. Jarvis, anticipating what he was going to do, had the elevator doors open, and he jogged through. "I look like I was dragged through a grease trap backwards; I have to shower, when is this shitshow happening?"
“No, I had a friend with a wedding planning business call and imply she needed an emergency venue change for a society wedding,” Jan said, and Tony went still.  Jan's eyelashes fluttered.  “She signed the contract this morning.”
Some slight warnings for non-graphic discussions of child abuse (non-sexual).  this conversation is by adults, who are safe and healthy.  But just in case.
“No, you don’t,” DJ said, and laughed as Clint flipped powdered sugar at him with a flick of his fingers.
Ellen sat.
“No, he’s not,” Pepper said.  Rhodey gave her a mock hurt look, and she just shook her head.  “Good try, but not a chance.”
“No, it’s a-” Tony leveled a glare at Clint.  “You’re not coming.”
“Yeah, well, I have faith in your skills, and also the fact that you buy yout t-shirts at least a size too small.” Tony moved towards the walk-in.  “A habit I appreciate more than you could possibly know.”
The back door opened, and a man leaned in.  “We find him, then?”
Tony watched them go, and when the door shut behind them, he pushed himself up and collected his jacket from the back of his chair.  “If we're about to eat, why bring him something that'll spoil his meal?” he asked Jarvis, shaking the wrinkles out of the fabric.
Laughing, Steve kissed him, his mouth swallowing whatever else Tony was trying to say, and the words tasted like coffee and sugar and chocolate.  Steve exhaled against Tony’s cheek.  “Someone got into the dessert course,” he whispered, and Tony laughed.
“Fine,” Tony said.  He pushed himself upright.  “Jarvis, please inform the parasites that live in my tower that their presence is expected, otherwise, they will disappoint the child, and I will have no choice but to murder them.”
He paused to lift a damaged tree away from a row of small storefronts, making sure he left the road clear for a phalanx of fire trucks and SHIELD vehicles that went rolling past.  A few quick repulsor blasts, and he was left with a neat pile of branches and trunk lengths.  He stacked them up by the curb, dusting his hands clean as he stepped back.  He was about to take off when something in a nearby jewelry shop window caught his eye.
“He did,” Fury agreed.  “He's been quietly working his way into a position of power.  Every time there's a mutant scare, he leveraged it for another few million.  Another small department.  He's tied into a lot of security councils.  A lot of people with deep pockets.”
DJ shook his head.  “No,” he said.  “But Clea told me.”
“DJ,” Steve said, holding the sunglasses out, and DJ snagged them from his hand.  In an instant, they had disappeared into the pocket of his sweatshirt.  “Thank you.”
Clint smiled up at the camera.  “You know?  I do think you love him more than the rest of us combined.”
Tony waved him off.  “Fine,” he managed, but his head fell back against Steve's shoulder.  “I might not be  well, but I'm well medicated.”  He took a deep breath.  “Seriously.  Hipster porn.  This whole thing is like catnip to your people.  I'm going to take pictures of the kitchen and make an absolute killing.”
“No,” Steve told him.
He looked down.  “Are those-”
“Don't even joke about that,” Rhodey said.  He stabbed a finger in Tony's direction.  “You try it, and I'm going to prop you up in a congressional hearing and let them have at you.”
DJ fished around in the sink, coming up with a beaker.  “Washing,” he said, as water dripped down his arm and onto the floor.
“Yeah, I can tell.”  He uncovered a patch of mostly clean skin on DJ’s forehead and leaned in to press a kiss there.  “You can tell us when you need a break, you know that, right?  All of us.  Nat would understand.”
“My wire,” DJ said.  He grinned.  “From when I got fixed.”
"I really think I should be out there with you."
“Perhaps not, but you certainly are enjoying flirting with the poor man,” Pepper said.
“How long?” Steve parroted back, but Tony’s fingers cupped his jaw tipping his head up, and his mind went blank.
Tony nodded.  “Why would you-”
Stane laughed, his lips pulling back from his teeth.  “You’ve always been weak, Tony.  You’ve never had the balls to do what needed to be done, that’s why you let me take over.  Because you were, and have always been, weak.”  There was blood on his lips, on his teeth.  “Always.”
"Yes, Chef."  And just like that, she was working, her hands flying over the station, so fast that they were almost a blur.
“Every time you walk up to my window and make that face, the one you make when you're trying to figure out the whole menu just by the scent-”
“Let’s go,” he said, heading up the road with his usual broad stride, the flasks rattling with each step.
“Because Pepper made it clear that we couldn’t have knife fights behind the dumpster anymore,” Tony said.  He caught Peter by the shoulder and walked the kid in a circle, pointing him towards the back door before he confiscated his broom.  “Box.  Coat.  Go home.  Anyone who is still in this kitchen in five minutes is going to be fired and not the fun kind of fired where I rehire you before the next course because I hadn’t planned ahead about what I was going to do with the asparagus in your absence.”
“He’s Dummy,” Steve said, as Clint gave him a nametag that said ‘Military Invasion.’  Steve barely seemed to notice.  “Tony’s helper bot.”
Steve barely had time to register the new arrivals before DJ came scrambling up to the stool next to his, hopping up to rest his arms on the countertop.  Steve moved his hat out of the way, and DJ plopped down on the stool, rocking it forward so he could lean his elbows on the well worn stone.  “Good morning,” Steve said, dropping his hat onto DJ's still-damp hair with a smile.
DJ smiled.  “Nope.”
“Don’t apologize to him, it only reinforces this sort of behavior,” the young man said.  He glanced around Steve, and sighed.  “Let me-  No one should be touching this door without a pair of gloves.”  He leaned in, running a fingertip across the wood.  “Or perhaps a flame of some sort.”
“You're going to bartend,” Jessica told Luke.  “Because someone will start making a drink that hurts your soul, and you will physically toss them out from behind the bar and take over.”
Tony twisted his head around, meeting Steve’s eye for a second before returning to his work.  “Fixing it,” he said.  He wrapped the rope around his hand and heaved himself upwards, the sole of his boot scraping against the stone as it slid downwards. “Or trying to.”  He gave the rope a sharp tug.  It didn’t move, and his breath left him in a sigh.  “What did you do to this?”
“Hard pass,” Bobbi said, trying to hide a smile.
Her teeth flashed in a grin.  “Being a man,” she corrected.  “Sometimes.  Some days, I’m happier like this, in a suit, or overalls, or a uniform.  Other days…”  She shrugged.  “I fit a sheath dress and pin curls just as well.”  She reached up, adjusting the brim of her hat.  “So things I should’ve questioned, things I should’ve known were wrong, were dangerous…”
Steve set him down.  “Well, since you asked so nicely.  I’ll see what I can do.”
“Even so,” Jarvis said.  “Even when you were new, without sir, you never quite functioned properly.”
Tony was shaking.
“Okay, bedtime,” he said, ripping his eyes away from Tony.  “Because you don't know what you're saying and I do, and that's a bad combination, so-” He leaned over, grabbing for one of the pillows, his fingers shaking.  “Let's just-”
“Yes, we do,” Pepper said, cutting him off with ruthless efficiency.
“Tony?”
Bruce’s eyes went wide.  “Oh. Right.  We don’t tell you about that.”
The only reply was the sound of the front door slamming shut, and Steve collapsed on the bed next to Tony, laughing out loud.  Tony's head tipped in his direction, grinning at him.  “That's your best friend,” he said, his eyes dancing.
“Does that ever work?” Pepper asked him.
Steve laughed.  “Yes, chef,” he said, and the moment he moved, Tony missed the heat of his body.
Steve pretended to think about that. “Nope.”
DJ's chin tipped up, his face curious, his legs drawn up against his chest.  He leaned his chin on his knees.  “Hello,” he said, the single word cautious and halting.  But he met Thor's eyes without flinching, his toes digging into the quilt.
“Kinda sexy purposes,” Greer said at the same time.
But he didn’t have time to think, didn’t even have time to draw breath, before something large and solid slammed into him, lifting him off his feet, and slamming him into the table behind him.  Harris made a desperate grab for the edge of the table and missed, his shoulder skimming into someone’s lunch, french fries and soda going in all directions.
“I don't-” Steve started, right before a familiar pair of dark eyes popped up on the far side of the car, little hands locking down on the metal.  Steve rocked forward, one hand coming up.  “Hey, don't touch that.”
Tony’s lips parted, and Steve shuddered.  “You’re fired,” Tony said.
Steve choked on a laugh.  “My god,” he manged.
Bucky stared down at him, his brow furrowed.  "But it's my couch," he repeated, bracing an elbow on the back of the couch.  He seemed confused by the situation.  "This.”  He tapped the back of the couch.  “This is where I sleep."
“I refuse to add to the hipster aesthetic of this scene,” Tony asked, waving a hand at the room at large.  “Your converted warehouse Brooklyn apartment.  Your secondhand couch.  Your sourdough bread and handmade preserves and your books of 19th century poetry and your-” He plucked at the blanket that was draped over his hips.  “Your vintage afghan.”
"Really."  Steve reached down, picking a shred of cheese out of Tony's hair.  A crumpled up bag with a familiar logo was on the coffee table, along with a couple of dirty plates and a tipped over soda can.  Steve eyed the mess, amused despite himself.  "'Cause it looks like you scammed a burrito off of Bucky and the two of you passed out in my couch."
Steve tried not to smile. It was harder than it should've been. “The point, Mr. Stark,” he said, biting off the words with crisp precision, “is that you've rented out a six thousand seat house to plop a single child in the middle of a very grand, very empty room.”
Steve watched him roll over, the muscles of his back and shoulders flexing as he found a comfortable position.  It was hypnotizing, watching him curl up against the pillows.  He realized he was still holding Tony's pants, the fabric twisted between his fingers.  He set them on the end of the bed, and reached for the edge of the sheet.
Isaiah looked up.  “Ah, yes,” he said, folding his hands on the head of his cane.  “He causing you trouble, ma’am?”
DJ was sitting at the end of the bed, his knees drawn up against his chest, his arms wrapped around them, fingers tight in the fabric of his pajama pants.  He blinked at Steve, slow and careful.  “Do you love us?”
“Damn right I did,” Darcy said.  She was wearing a tiny gold crown on a headband.  She held out an ornate, glittery headpiece of silver and paste jewels to DJ.  “Here you go, magpie, I got you the best one.”
Steve shrugged.  “I was awake.  Didn’t much feel like getting out of bed, to be honest.”  He gave Tony’s ass a squeeze.  “But we should probably get dressed before eight.”
“And I appreciate your sacrifice, I just had no idea you owned flats, let alone that you owned Crocs,” Tony said.
There was no reply, and Steve looked towards the bathroom.  'Tony?  Do you-”
Steve tucked his hands in his pockets, his shoulders tipped forwards.  “I don't know.  You seem pretty decent from here,” he said.
“It is absolutely me,” Tony said.
“You need practice with that,” Sam said, sweeping Natasha in a wide circle.
“I rode out to see it,” Shuri said.  “And I looked at this…  This mess that they had made, and it was like, every one of my ancestors rose up as one to HOWL at me in the back of my head.”  She hunched forward, grinning. “Like, my Grandmother was right behind me, hissing in my ear, ‘city living has made you SOFT,’ because it was-”  She shook her head.  “This one structure, this one lump of soft mud, and clay, and straw, like a lean-to with a hole under it?  This one thing undid centuries of our history, centuries of engineering and architecture and-”
DJ gave Steve one last glance, even as they were walking up the stairs, and Steve smiled up at him.
“You attract people who need bail money,” Pepper said.  “Maybe Bruce-”
“Crab rangoon, egg foo young, shrimp chow mein, pork fried rice and General Tao's chicken,” Steve said, and Tony tried not to moan..
She stepped back, and Jesse stepped up next to her.  “Okay,” she said, her voice quiet.  “What am I missing?”
His eyes dropped to Val's fingers, which were tangled in her hair, twisting the strands in a tiny, intricate braid.  Her hands were steady, and DJ felt some of the tension go out of his shoulders.  Faces lied, but other things, other things were harder to hide.  He was pretty sure it was because people didn't think about them.  That made them more...
“Well, a working watch is better than a broken memento,” Tony said.  His head still down, he reached for one of the jars of instruments, and Pym nudged it closer to his hand.  He chose a long pair of needlepoint tweezers, mumbling a thank you under his breath.
"Don't do that, either," Steve said, shaking his head.  "Tony, I think maybe you should just get some rest, we'll be home soon, and-"
“That’s an opinion not many people share,” Steve said.  Tony was rifling through the shelves next to the bath, and Steve gave him a suspicious look.  “What are you doing?”
Steve kissed him.  “I’m fine,” he whispered against Tony’s lips.  It sounded like the truth.  It might even have been the truth.  He wasn’t sure anymore, but he was willing to take the risk.  “You thought I was here to kill you?”
“She’s asking which floor she gets off of the elevator on, because-”
Tony smiled.  "Hand me the socket wrench," he said, holding out a hand.  There was a moment of silence, and he glanced over.  DJ was looking at him, his face twisted in confusion.  "The socket wrench?" Tony repeated.  "You know which one that is?  It's-" he gestured at the tool box.  "It's that one, next to the drill, it's-"
Steve blinked at her. “The... Shovel talk?”
He wondered if being in love was always this complicated, or if it was just him.  Making things complicated.  Making things harder than they had to be.  Stuck in his own head, when he didn't need to be.  Loving Tony was muscle memory by this point, he didn't have to think of it, he didn't have to work at it.  It was just there, with him, part of him.
Bobbi stepped up, a crown of white daisies and red flowers that Steve couldn't identify in her hands.  “Daisies for loyal love and purity,” she said with a grin.  “Gladiolus for faithfulness and honor.”  She went on her toes, slipping it onto Steve's head.  “Just right for a knight.”
“Anthony Edward Stark, you do this to hurt me,” Miss Van Dyne said, stalking across the room.
“Agreed,” Iron Man said.  “And since he’d just gone through this with, well-” He waved a hand at Rogers.  “He seemed less than sympathetic to my situation.  But Clea found Zebrahead, and he guided us to this part of the world, and then I ditched them both, because I found out.  That my child.  Was in Las Vegas.”
“But you didn’t stop him,” Harris said.
DJ tried to smile.  “ Oh.” His head fell forward again.  “I just- Wanted to be sure.  That you-”  He stopped, his mouth going into a tight line.  “Not you.  Him.  He’s not…  He’s not you.  I know that.  I knew that.  But-”  He took a breath.  “Wanted to know.”
"No," O'Brien said, his eyes staring blankly at the far wall.
Tony managed a smile.  It felt wrong on his face, foreign.  But he smiled anyway.  “You are stronger than anyone knows.  Don’t ever forget that.”
DJ leaned forward.  “You said ‘two’s better than one,’” DJ said.  “What did you mean by that?”
“I don’t remember this,” Steve said, trying to head off the inevitable.
"Oh," he said.  And then, again.  "Ooooooh."  He leaned back in his chair.  "And your dad-"
“How are you like this?” Bucky said.  “I’ve known you my entire life, but I gotta ask, how are you like this?”
DJ nodded.  “He likes anything he can disassemble,” Steve said.  “And...  Reassemble.  He's pretty good at it.”
Sam smiled.  “So, you're not the 'friendzoned' asshole,” he said, his voice gentle.  “You value Tony's friendship.  It's not something you're using to get him in bed.  You're not manipulating him, not trying to pressure him.  You're just...  Showing him that he can't do any better, honestly.”
Sam groaned.  "No.  Absolutely not.  I'm not-"  He shook his head.  "I'm not painting."
“So you should be used to my outsized style by now.  Well?" he asked, when she stepped back.  "Do I pass muster?"
“Ms. Potts said, and I quote-” He heard fingers tapping on a keyboard.  “‘I paid someone a hundred dollars specifically so I did not have to comment on anything that happened this weekend.’”  A pause.  “‘And thank you for calling.  Lovely to talk to you.’  Then she hung up.”
Steve tried to swallow, but his throat was dry.  “About that.  I don’t-”  He shook his head, glancing towards the front of the shop.  The people passing by were shadowy shapes, the edges and details muted by the heavy grime on the glass.  They looked like ghosts, and he put his back to the window.  “It was a gift.  From…  Someone who’s gone.”
“Dance time!” Tony declared, waving him off.  “And we've got half a record left so-”
“Not your best choice, that's...  That's unlikely to work, so maybe-”
Tony looked at Darcy.  “Sorry,” he said, as quiet as he could, and she grinned at him.
“Sorry, it's pretty ingrained by now,” Tony said, grabbing hold of Steve's hand and letting Steve pull him to his feet.  For a second, he wobbled on his feet, swaying into Steve's body.  But Steve's grip was strong and steady, and he held on, long after Tony needed his help to stay upright.  He just started moving towards the door, towing Tony along in his wake.  Tony, laughing, stumbled after him.
This time, his smile was hard and sharp, lacking any sense of warmth.  “And I get the feeling that day is coming, sooner than I would like.”
“You're a bad influence,” Steve said, even as he stripped his shirt over his head.  With a flick of his hand, he sent it tumbling down to the main floor of his apartment.
"I admire your honesty.  I admire it enough to give you some of my fruit," Tony told him.  He pushed himself upright, groaning as he slumped back against the headboard, trying to find a comfortable spot that didn't involve any contact with the cat, who was now chewing on one of its back feet with single minded determination.  "Actually, you can have everything you want.  Just give me the coffee."
Steve looked up at him.  “I would.  This time.  I think I would.”
So he pushed himself up, inch by agonizing inch, into a sitting position.  “Knock it off,” he called, his head falling into his hands.  “I'm coming.”
“That, too.”  Mrs. Parker nodded at the basket of unpeeled apples.  “And if you need a job, those need to be checked for bad spots and worm holes.”
The image flickered in and out, systems disturbed and bursts of energy whiting out the screen.  There was sound only sporadically, mostly the sound of stone and metal groaning and crashing to the ground.  The huge, open lobby of what had once been Stark Tower was in ruins, shards of glass and stone lying broken on every surface.  The huge fountain had been blown apart, water splattering out across the cracked marble floor.
“You know, but you do it anyway, and one of these days, I’m not going to be fast enough, or good enough, or-”  Tony stopped.  “I’m not mad at you, Deej.  I’m…  Not mad.  Is that why you’re still up?  Because you thought I was mad at you?”
Steve nodded.  “You realize that's insane, right?”
Tony Stark gave the tie a look, regretting every moment of this already. “And I am a man well known for doing almost everything to keep from actually having to live up to those responsibilities,” he said, buttoning his shirt up and tucking it into his pants.  “Also, a man who's had next to no sleep, so-”
“Tony.”
Steve braced himself as Natasha started up the car.  “So if you’re the fixer, and she’s the spy, does that make Hogan the muscle?” he asked.
Pepper looked back at Tony with a shrug, and he waved her off.  “Kitchen is my problem,” he said with a smile.  “Good night, Potts.  Good work.”
“I cannot imagine anyone would inquire as to what you chose to watch tonight,” Jarvis said.  “And I see no reason to offer the information.”
“I grew up in literally the same building as you, and your Ma was as normal a lady as I ever met, so I’m guessing you’re just naturally a little punk.  You might finally be bigger than me, but you’re still a little punk, Rogers.”
"Wonderful, you've been here for, what, two days, and we've managed to completely destroy any moral compass that you might've had," Tony said, plucking the candlestick from DJ's grasp.  DJ made a hopping attempt to grab it again, and Tony struggled between screaming and laughing.
“Almost done,” Steve said, not that he knew if that was true or not.  But Pym was watching Bucky with a wary eye, his face tense.  “I just needed someone to fix my watch, and I had a spare moment, so I thought-”
Tony paused in the doorway.  “Why,” he said at last, and it sounded plaintive.
Tony leaned back on his stool.  “The paper was sound,” he said, almost bored by this.  “Did you even bother to read it before you passed it in?”
“Okay, so the Empire is based on-”
There was a moment of silence, and then, the flagstones under his feet shuddered.
“But most important,” Stark said, one hand holding his cape in place.  “I want it known that I am, in fact, the king of kites.”
He was so lost in his thoughts that he almost missed the slim form that was hovering, some distance from the lobby doors.  Steve slowed down, caught somewhere between wariness and curiosity.
There was a beat of silence, of stillness, and Harris knew, on some level, that every gun in the room was now pointed in his general direction.  He took a breath, and another, and tried to ignore the pale, frightened face that he saw reflected in the smooth, featureless front of the helmet.
DJ looked up at him from behind his plate, which was now a towering pile of whipped cream, chopped nuts, shaved chocolate, and swirls of caramel sauce.  “Waffle,” he said, shaking powdered sugar onto the top.
Rogers took a sip of his. “It's really good,” he said, and Al's smile was beatific.
Tony turned his attention to straightening the chessboard.  “Well, the Stark family has a tradition for what to do when that happens,” he mused.  “I think it’s called boarding school.”
“Helping me get a date,” she said, in tones of extreme patience.
Sam nodded, a slight dip of his chin.  "Yes," he said.  "Because Steve was out of commission, and you were with him, and that means that per protocol, I-"
For a long moment, Tony just breathed, and Steve raised their linked hands, his knuckles just brushing against the hard rim of the arc reactor.  “What do you need?” Tony asked at last.
Steve smiled against Tony’s shoulder.  “Was that me?”
Tony shifted closer, rolling over to rest his head in Steve's lap.  “I should be, but I'm not,” he admitted with a yawn.  Steve smoothed his hair back, and Tony batted at his hand with a languid hand.  “Why are you even awake?”
His fingers tapped on the bannister.  “Head of Security is a more nebulous concept.  It’ll be what you want to make of it.  You can take over the house security, of course, and you’ll have the run of my properties, if you want to make changes to how things are handled at the factories, you’re probably better equipped to do it than Happy would’ve been.”
Fury nodded.  “Can't say I blame them,” he said.  He braced his jaw on one hand.  “And to answer your question, Stark, we were aware of the project.  We did not think that it was going to be unveiled in quite this manner.” His mouth went tight.  “Or quite this quickly.”
“I have, and we’ll make a go of it,” Steve said, straightening up.  He dusted his hands off on his legs.  “You’ve never been afraid of a little hard work before.”
“You’re an ass,” Steve said.  “And I know what you’re doing.”
“Don’t ever do that,” Steve muttered, punching the keys on his register with more force than was strictly necessary.
“Yes, sir.”  Peter gave Tony one last hopeful look, which Tony did his best to ignore.
“Fine with me,” Sam said.  He scooted his chair closer to the bed.  “What'd you get?”
Tony clutched his chest with both hands.  “Madam!  I’m wounded!  And here I thought  we were friends.”
Steve stared at him.  “No.”
"In a New York minute," Steve said, grinning back at him.  "And you know it, buster."
“Okay, I'll bite.  What're you doing?” Tony asked.
Tony stared after him, stunned into silence.  A spike of pain from his hand shook him out of his stupor.  He looked down and found he was clutching the dog tags in the hollow of his palm, tight enough that the metal was digging into his skin.
Duck braced his jaw on one hand, leaning into it as if he was too tired to hold his head up.  “Ellen.”
Tony glanced at him.  “And?” he repeated.
He stopped, catching himself halfway gone to a fantasy of mingled loads of laundry and half-finished Sunday Times Crossword puzzle.  He was losing his mind.  He was absolutely losing his mind.  He had a laundry service for a reason; no part of his fantasy life should involve the phrase, 'are these my socks or yours?'
She shrugged.  “Possibly.”  She gave him an innocent smile, her eyelashes fluttering,  and popped the pasta into her mouth.
Tony's head lolled forward, his bare feet sliding across the floor as he tried to keep moving towards the stairs.  Steve braced a hand against the railing and wrapped his other around Tony's waist, dragging him back.  “Tony!”
“I got it,” Carol said.  “Where are the evidence bags?”
“Tony, I need you to sit down,” Rhodey said.  He moved over to the balcony, pulling the doors shut.  “Before you fall down.” The cat rubbed up against his leg, and he jumped.  “What the hell is-”
Tony studied him, as if he doubted that.  “There’s munster.  If you want the swiss, I can have munster-”
"It has a hole in the hem," Steve pointed out.
The voice caught him off guard, and Tony's shoulders went tight.  But despite the provocation, he didn't turn around.  “Check with Bruce and Peter, I think they're down in the orchard,” he said to Bobbi, who nodded.  “He might be in one of the outbuildings.”
He shook off the thought.  It was ridiculous.  He was being ridiculous, and he knew it, but suddenly, he wished he'd spent a little more on his bed frame, or that he owned more than two kitchen chairs that matched.
He’d half expected a denial, or some feigned attempt at confusion.  Instead, Happy just nodded, his chin dipping down towards his chest.  “We all got our secrets,” he said.  “An’ some of us, more than others.”
Startled, Tony sucked in a breath.  His eyes snapped towards Rogers, who was still focusing his attention on the lizard in his hand.  “He knows what he’s doing.”  His hand tipped to the side, and the lizard darted back and forth across the back before it wiggled under his sleeve.  Rogers smiled, his cheeks creasing.  “And he’s good at it.”
“Of course, sir,” Jarvis said, in that particular tone of voice that he used when Tony was being very irrational.  Tony was used to that tone of voice.
“Has SHIELD given you any problems about this arrangement of yours?” Morrison asked.
“I need Steve's address.”
“I don’t want to date you, either,” Tony said, taking a sip of his coffee.
Ellen stared at her.  “Why...  Would we do that?” she asked at last.
“This is the VIP lounge,” Harris said, and it wasn’t a question, it was just the only logical answer.  “That’s why I’m here.  For the VIP lounge.”
“Stop.”  Tony was laughing.  “It’s fine, Steve.  If there’s stuff leftover, well, most of it will freeze, and what won’t freeze will be eaten, it’s-” He reached out, his hand cupping Steve’s shoulder.  “It’s fine.  I can afford it.”
By the time he caught up to her, Bobbi was already at the still, making minute adjustments to the gauges there.  She took a step back, sweeping her hat off and tossing it towards a trailing bit of pipe.  “There,” she said, reaching up and catching a lever in one hand.  She looked back at Steve, even as she gave it a sharp tug.  “Enjoy your drink.”
“We let DJ call, with the Facetime.  It gives him control.  We called, because I thought, maybe, the app was not working,” she said.
“Wow,” Darcy said, drawing the word out.  Tony looked at her, and she shook her head.  “Wow, no.”
That startled a laugh out of Steve.  Tony gave him a look, doing his best to look hurt.  “No, really.  Look at this.”  He held up the book.  “Clearly, we have Pepper working on the ledgers.  Rhodey working on one of the cars.”  He flipped the pages.  “Mrs. Parker threatening Clint with a a set of measuring spoons.”
“That’s a lot of cheese,” Tony said, leaving the fridge open as he went to the cabinet to retrieve a couple of plates.  “Have a cheese sandwich.  There’s ham, have a ham and cheese, Bruce bought some mustard from his last conference and it’s horrible; I love it.”
He shoved a hand through his hair.  “Nothing.  Nothing's wrong.”  He stopped, and turned to look at her, his dark eyes narrowing into bright slits.  “Why do you think something's wrong?” he asked.
“At least someone around here is capable of doing their job,” Tony said to DJ, who nodded.  Tony's lips twitched.  “You're filthy.”
"Fine," Tony said. "We'll send you a nice thank you card, but one of my bots is doing my signatures.  Probably Dummy.  He's gotten pretty good at faking my signature for the FedEx guys."
Tony pushed himself upright.  “Probably not going to happen,” he admitted.  Steve looked up at him, and he smiled.  “You going to stop asking me?”
“Shut up, I’m still not sure why you’re here,” Tony said with a smile.  “Who wants a burger?  The carnie wants the cheapest food possible, and I’m too tired to argue with him.”
Tony was leaning back in his chair, one foot braced on the edge of his desk, the other thrown out in front of him.  His eyes were closed, and he had a bottle of vodka pressed against his forehead.  Steve slipped through the door, letting it close silently behind him.  “So,” he said, his voice soft, “this is a vodka level problem.”
DJ crossed his arms over his chest.  “Tried to EAT me,” he reiterated, his voice stern, and Strange nodded.
T’Challa watched him go through the motions.  “It suits you.”
Steve’s eyes flicked up towards the sky.  “Not a-” was as far as he got before Okoye waved him off.
Steve made an inarticulate sound, pressing his face deeper into his pillow.  Whatever it was, someone else could handle it.  All he wanted to do was sleep.
“Yeah, well, as you said, if I had any sense, I wouldn’t be in food service,” Steve said, opening the box.  He reached in with both hands, and pulled out a small, covered dutch oven.  He slid it across the counter, setting it in front of Tony, and offered him a pot holder.
“Let’s go,” Carol said, wrapping an arm around Jess’ waist and picking her up.  She snagged Greer by the wrist and hustled them both towards the kitchen door.  Greer gave Steve a wave, and before he could wave back, they were gone.
“You’ll be fine.” May kissed DJ on the top of his head as well, and he grinned up at her.  She smiled back.  “Good morning, David James.”  DJ made a face. “Donald Justin?”  He shook his head.  May pretended to think.  “Daniel Jonathan?”
She held up the long, uninterrupted piece of peel, and deposited it into the bowl with the others.  “I don’t think he knew how to ask, how to say what he wanted to say.”  She sliced a chunk of apple free from the core and held it out to Steve, speared on the tip of her knife.  “But he tried.”
Natasha’s eyes cut in his direction.  “That’s not fair.”
Tony glanced up.  “Photo ops,” he said, reaching for the mask in Steve's hand.  “Lean over.”  Steve bent forward, just a bit, and Tony slipped the mask over his head, tucking the elastic in place behind Steve's ears.  Steve's eyes fluttered shut, his lips falling open as Tony's fingers smoothed his hair down.  “There.”
Trip looked at the kid, who was still studying the chapel.  His hands were now braced in the front pocket of the hoodie, dragging the fabric down.  “Not important.”
Clint didn’t look up from the map.  “No,” he said.  “Have you met me?  I’m surprised anyone respects me.  Like.  At all.”
“No insider trading,” DJ said.
“Captain Rogers, wake up.”
Steve nodded.  “I notice.”
"Ah."  Stark's mouth twitched, something almost like a smile, but gone before it was fully formed.  "The war changed things."
“Don’t worry, Jarvis knows who’s responsible for all the disasters in this house.  One day,” Tony said, his fingers smoothing along the line of Steve’s jaw, “I should give you a shave.”  He leaned in, his lips tracing the same path, his breath soft against Steve’s skin.  “Though I find myself curious what you’d look like with a beard.”
"Please stop," Steve said, and Tony stopped.  "I'm going to choose to believe that you're making this up."
“I think your plan for total isolation may hit a snag,” Pepper said.  “In that you just asked Steve to move in with you.”
“I mean, I’m sure that Steve is going to have some serious words for me about not being a complete idiot in public, but that ship has sailed and he knew what I was capable of when we started dating.”
“Tony?” She sounded worried now, and that was bad.
Shiro flipped another order of gyoza onto the griddle and covered them with a lid to steam, a faint smile on his face.  “I told you, before you wasted your time.  Try again.”
“You're both insane,” Tony said, pointing at them.  “I'm going to go-”  He didn't know how to finish that sentence.  He gave a firm nod.  “Right.  Going to go do that.  That thing.”
“You’re all insane,” Harris said.  “You.  Are all nuts.”
Bobbi’s fingertip tapped against the folder, sharp and staccato.  “No,” she said with a faint smile.  “Happy’s the distraction.  He’s the guy everyone likes, the one everyone talks to.  He’s harmless, and he takes up a lot of space and makes a lot of noise.”  She shook her head.  “Once he gets going, it’s very hard to focus on anything else.”
Tony grinned.  "You might change your mind after you hear my wallet's in my other suit."  He tapped a finger against the chestplate of the armor.  "The one with pockets."
“You can’t afford it,” Tony said, without missing a beat, and Steve made a pained noise. Tony grinned.  “It’s fine, Steve.  It’s just fine.”
She nodded. “Ah. Gotcha.”
“Which still leaves a lot of space to cover.”  Rogers looked up, all the way up, at the ceiling of the grand hall, two stories above them.  “May I see his bedroom?”
“Right,” Jan said.  “So next time that you try to block me, Stark, do a better job of covering your tracks, because that was dumb.  That was-”  Her head tipped to the side, big brown eyes considering him.  “For you, that was unforgivably stupid.”
“Right,” Tony said.  He nodded.  “Your favorite thing.  Dishes.”
Steve nodded.  “Yes.”
“It’s big enough,” Tony said, his voice dire.
“We’ll be rid of one, soon enough,” Okoye said, giving Steve a speaking look.
It took a painfully long time to pry himself loose from the covers of his bed and struggle to his feet.  Then, swaying on legs that did not want to hold his weight, he stumbled into the bathroom.  After a quick attempt to restore his basic humanity, he headed out of the bedroom.  He spared a moment’s consideration to finding a shirt or a pair of sweatpants or something, but it just honestly seemed like too much work.  He was wearing a decent enough pair of boxers, and Rhodey’d seen him in worse.
Tony looked at Jarvis.  “It was, in fact, some cherries,” Jarvis said.
“Yeah, the fact that Tony kept texting me til like two am, and my phone  seemed to think that might be an emergency,” Sam said, his head tipped back to stare up at the sky.  “I’m not sure if that was because the texts just kept coming, even though I didn’t acknowledge any of them, or if it was because he, you know, programmed my phone and so it thinks he’s special.”
“Do you need anything, Mr. Stark?”
“Steve’s had more exposure, but still.   I’m pretty much fucked no matter what,” Tony said.  He held up the jar.  “But I’ve got all the pickled eggs that I can eat, so, that’s a plus.”
Laughing, Steve stepped back, letting Tony muscle his way into the space in front of the stove.  He didn’t go far, though, just waited until Tony was stirring the sauce before he wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist, leaning into his back.  “Do I ever get to taste it?” he asked, his chin on Tony’s shoulder.
“'Blow up the missile, Iron Man,'” Tony said, wheeling his way down towards the warehouse floor.  Someone shot at him, and he let off a repulsor blast without even looking in that direction.  “'Fix the hole in the fabric of space and time, Iron Man.'  'Find out if that'll kill us, Iron Man.'”
"Pretty sure that's not his main concern," Sue said.  She looked at Tony, considering him.  "Does he go to school?"
“A disguise,” Darcy said, and Harris gave her a look.  She shrugged. “What?  We do.”
“It's not, it's just-”  Steve shifted his weight.  “Can we drop this now?”
“And very wasteful,” Nakia said, giving Bucky a look.  He shrugged.  With a smile, she turned back to Shuri.  “Have you considered a simple trap door in the floor of your laboratory?”
“Yes, well, none of us sleep on good nights,” Tony said.  His head fell back against Steve’s shoulder.  “And this isn’t going to be a good night.  Is it.”
“Do us all a favor and take some selfies,” Pepper said to Tony.  Tony stared at her.  “Something...  Affectionate.”
Tony leaned back, rubbing at his uninjured side.  “I was going to have to talk to him eventually, Jarvis.”
Pepper frowned at him.  “Are you-”
“Think I should rip the neckline?” Darcy asked, tugging on it.  “So it’s more-”
Tony looked at her over the rim of his silver smoothie cup, his eyebrows arched.  After a long sip, he raised the cup in a mock salute.  “Smoothie.”
“I don’t want to,” Tony said.  “As soon as I open this box, Christmas is over forever.  There will be no more Christmas.”
“Really.  It’s, it’s nice,” Rhodey said.  “Clean lines, good color-”
"Friends his own age," Sue said, smiling.
Tony pointed the screwdriver at Steve.  “Are we satisfied?”
“Did I ask?” Tony asked.
Tony’s eyes dropped to the board, and then came back up, sharp and clear, and Steve found it hard to breathe.  “I can work with this.”
“In your general direction, yes.”  She reached out, catching his hand in hers.  “Tony.  Let him try.”
Tony stopped dead in the bedroom door. “No,” he said.
Tony felt Steve nod, his chin brushing against Tony’s head.  “You’re sure.”  Stephen nodded, and Tony’s jaw worked.  “How are you sure?”
Tony smiled.  “So do I.  Turns out, it’s the best room in the house.”
Steve leaned forward, pressing a kiss to Tony's hair.  "Love you," he said, hopping down and pulling the door shut.  "Peter, can you lock down the cabinets and-"
“And second of all,” Tony said, slamming the car back into gear.  “I’m going to punch your father in the fucking nose.”
“Stay,” he whispered, and Steve was an idiot, Steve was a lovesick fool, because he lowered himself down, carefully, cautiously clinging to the very edge of the bed.  Keeping as much distance between them as he could manage.  Tony smiled at him, his eyes fluttering shut.  “Stay.”
She smiled.  “He wears it on a chain around his neck.”  Miriam tapped a finger against the neckline of her shirt.  “As long as it's kept under his clothes, it's much safer for him, and he's-”  She shrugged.  “He's a  bit of a romantic.”
“I have no doubt.  Thanks, Happy.”  Tucking his gloves in his coat pocket, Rhodey headed out of the garage and out to the front door of the house.
DJ chewed on the bacon, silent, and Stark pushed his plate a little closer.  “Use a fork for the eggs, okay?”
Stephen took a deep breath.  “Morgana.”
She nodded.  “I'm gonna get some fries.”
“A choice you are, of course, welcome to make,” Jarvis said, unruffled as ever.  “However, I shall leave the final journey from your blotter to the flames to you.” He set the coffee pot down by Tony’s elbow, turning it so the handle was within easy reach.  “As it is high time for you to learn to do such things for yourself.”
Steve grinned. “I don’t know, think it’ll improve my chances?” he asked.
"I may have had a hand in your breakfast, yes," Jarvis said, his voice echoing out of the bathroom.
Her voice trailed away, and Tony nodded.  “But,” he agreed.  “I’ve placed a lot of trust in someone I barely know.”  He pushed his hair back.  “Haven’t I.”
"No need."  Thor reached down and tucked a forearm against the back of her thighs, lifting her clear off the ground and up to eye level.  He smiled at her.  "There.  That is better."
Steve looked over the top of his laptop.  “Uh, Cafe Collette, I think,” he said, reaching for the invoices.  “Is it lemon?”
"I'm going to repeat: you got your tongue.  Stuck.  In the neck of an Evian bottle," Steve told him.  "And then you wrapped yourself in every towel in the room and tried to climb into the only bed soaking wet."
Tony leaned back in his chair, a model wing cradled in the curve of his fingers.  “I’m surprised,” he said, frowning up at the model.
Tony stared down at the child, who stared back, big dark eyes unblinking and unreadable.  There was a strange stillness to the boy, a solumn consideration in his face.  There was a bruise on his jaw and his hair, despite Pepper's efforts, was a tangled mop of dark curls, but his chin was up, his gaze sharp.
“Yes, darling, he’s…  We’re donating freely to his opponent in the next election,” Tony said.  “He’s a soft touch, Ms. Blair.”
“Nothing in there worth protecting,” he said, and without thinking, his free hand went behind him, reaching for reassurance or connection or something he couldn’t even define.
DJ shook his head. “Okay,” he said, and stopped, his eyes closing.  He took a deep breath, the air hissing between his teeth.  “I’m okay.”
“No, it isn’t,” Tony told her.  “Steve-”
Tony resisted the urge to roll his eyes.  “Obie…”
He smiled.  “Tony, I’m fine.”
“He is asking if he can do that tomorrow,” Jarvis said.
He downed half the glass in a single gulp, swallowing a lot of other things down with the alcohol.  But when he set down the glass, he was able to paste a smile on his face again.  “So.  Other than bringing your smut into my home, what'd you do today?”
"True!" DJ said, hopping back towards the blender.  Without even looking, Tony snagged him by the back of his shirt, dragging him to a protesting halt.  DJ's head tipped up.  "Smoothie?"
“I think,” Jarvis said, from the depths of his drink, “that you will do what you can.  And I’ve found, sir, that that is all that you need to do.”
“I'll see if I can get him on my calendar, it's pretty solid right now, it's things everywhere, you know how-”
Steve blinked at him.  It took him two tries to get a single word past the lump in his throat.  "What?"
He stopped, his mouth a thin line.  “I need your help.”
“I’m assuming you’ve got the little one under control,” Tony said.
“The end of the week, Tony,” she said.  ‘The end of the week that DJ is spending with us.”
“We got here,” Ellen said.  It had nearly killed her, but they'd made it in time to do some interviews, take some pictures, file the first Western dispatch from the celebration.  Then she'd had a little too much to drink and way too little sleep.  She pulled her pillow over her face.  “There is-  There is nothing happening, there is no news, there's nothing at all, there is nothing you could tell me that could get me out of this bed."
DJ kissed him on the cheek. “Merry Christmas.”
“Are there fairies in America?”
In the back of the mob, someone made a noise.  Not quite a word, just a warning sort of grunt, and the thug paused, his head swinging to the side.  Steve’s eyes darted in the same direction, trying to track what had gotten their attention.
And as soon as Logan walked away, he found himself face to face with Tony, who was staring at him, his eyebrows arched.  “Champagne?” he asked, his lips twitching.
“And the whole ‘making everything about me’ thing has immediately backfired,” Tony said, and Steve loved him so much it was a physical ache.  Tony glanced back at him, light playing across the planes of his face, along the curve of his lips, lighting sparks in the depths of his eyes.  “Fine.  I know when I’m outflanked.”
Steve closed his eyes, before the stone fell into place, telling himself that he couldn’t feel the darkness close in around him.  The passage closed with an almost silent scrape of stone on stone, and then there was darkness and stillness, broken only by the soft, lilting jazz music.
At all.
Steve laughed, and it came out caustic and bitter.  “That’s what you-”  He shook his head.  “You haven’t listened to a word I’ve said since I’ve stepped foot through the front door,” he said.  “Not a goddamn word.”
Halfway to the quinjet, he spotted Jan standing on the rear ramp, one of the armor’s arms slung over her shoulder. Greer was sitting nearby, a few other pieces spread out on the ground in front of her like a half-completed jigsaw puzzle.  Steve started to jog, then to run.  “Jan?” he called.
“You, uh, you slept through the whole thing,” Bruce said.
“Deal with it by getting rid of it?” Bucky said, glaring down at the cat, who had started to rub up against his ankles, its whole body vibrating with a purr.
“No, you don’t,” Jan said.
Bruce huffed out a breath.  “Nat?” he asked, a faintly pleading note in his voice.
“Enough.”
"I think we should," Steve said.  "But this isn't my decision to make.  At least, not alone."
How long since they’d come?  How long since they’d left?  How long had Phil had known what was happening?  How long did they have?  All the questions, condensed down to the essentials, because he knew Phil and Phil knew him and Clint had depended on that fact more times than he could remember.  When there were no words and no time and nothing else to depend on, Phil was always there.
He took them.  “My nerves are fine, Jan.”
What he was wearing.
"Do not," Steve said, at the same moment that Stark said, "Can you not?"  Steve's head snapped back towards Stark, who gave him a wry smile.
“A right charmer, for sure,” she said with a chuckle.  The baby let out a whimper, and she reached for him.  “Give him here.”
She cut him off.  "I would've remembered, Tony.  Trust me.  I would have-"  Her eyes slid after DJ, who was now perched on a little ladder slash stool in front of the blender, punching buttons with a great deal of enthusiasm.  "I would have remembered there being a child here.  In your."  She clutched at her forehead, something like terror sweeping over her.  “Oh, god, there's a child in your workshop.”
Silence.  Then, “I believe he is asleep, sir.”
Tony pulled away, propping himself up on his elbow to look around.  Steve grinned up at him, because he was all sleepy eyes and disastrous hair.  Tony made a displeased sound and collapsed back onto the pillows.  “You must’ve pulled me over here.”
"He is mostly concerned that something is wrong," Jarvis said, as Avengers Tower came into sight.  "Despite my efforts to reassure him."
“You’re still thinking about it?”
DJ smiled.  “Seems to be working,” he said, as the cat leaned into Harris’ hand, its chin in the air.
“Mr. Hammer’s back,” Sean said.  “And he said you’d want to know.”
“But it would be such a marvelous joke,” Jan pointed out.  She rolled over, folding her arms on the arm of the couch and leaning her chin on them.  She fluttered her eyelashes at him.  “Can you just imagine his face?”
Tony pushed himself upright.  “Under duress.”
Steve let out his breath, and it formed words, almost against his will. “You should ask him.”
Bobbi’s face was still.  “It let me be who I knew I was, and let me do everything I wanted to do.  I learned to outrun the cops and fight and drink.  It gave me connections, to people who found me amusing and people who found me useful.   I got to do whatever I wanted.  Spit in the face of authority.  Kiss some boys.  And some girls.  Mostly, it let me be who I’d always known I was, because as long as I drove well, and fought well, and fucked well, well…” She shrugged.  “I could have it all.  And didn’t have to pay for any of it.”
“My father, meanwhile, had no past, no family tree to speak of, no heritage, no history.  But he had a lot of money.”  Tony watched the water spill from the statue’s cupped palms.  “I guess he went there because he wanted to invest in a vineyard or two.  If there was one thing my father knew, it was fine wine.”  Tony paused, a wry smile twisting his lips.  “But he knew a beautiful girl when he met one, too.
She studied him.  "You don't approve."
DJ looked at Agatha.  “Want a cookie.  Very bad.  But now…  I don’t trust these.”  He made a face.  “Kinda mad about that.”
Steve took the screwdriver out of his hand, setting it gently on the workbench.  “Happy was driving him,” he said, his voice quiet.  “And even if he wasn’t, you don’t miss much, when it comes to that kid.”
Jarvis was already shaking his head.  “Please don’t,” he said, crossing over to the bed.  If he saw how Steve tensed, he didn’t show it.  “He hasn’t been sleeping well, as of late.”  He paused next to the bed, one eyebrow arching.  “Which does not excuse those shoes on the bed linens.”
“What happens if you don’t?”
“Noble of you.”  Steve gave himself a critical look in the hotel mirror.  He looked like death warmed over, dark circles under his eyes, the line of his jaw sharp and tense.  He made a face at his reflection, and turned on the sink.  “Thanks for the wakeup call, Buck, but I’ve got a meeting to get ready for.”
He made for a patchwork king, but there was something regal in his bearing, something brilliant in his smile.  Steve was no knight, and he was no king, but somehow, it didn't really matter.
“No, no, I am not-” Clint started, but she’d already disappeared again.  “God dammit, Romanov.”
*“I swear to god, if you hire a caterer that advertises ‘Friday Fiestas!’ I am going to have to call this friendship into serious question.”
She'd always been strong. Stronger than him.
“A mistake I won’t be repeating,” Tony said.  He grabbed one of the pillows and tossed it over Steve’s head.  “Go to bed, Deej.  We’ll be here tomorrow.”
"Pretty stupid to try," the kid said, his head bent forward.  His hands were jammed in is pockets, the pressure of his fists forcing the hem of the sweatshirt down around his thighs.
An instant, and he knew how this would end. He's slipped through Death's fingers before, leaving a trail of blood on the sand behind him, leaving something else along with it, some shattered and fragmented part of himself.
“Yes, well, there are rules here, Mrs. Parker,” Tony said, reaching out to take a towel from her.  He unfurled it with a snap of his wrist.  “And I’m pretty sure this is against them.”
“Peter, don’t argue with me,” she said, and just like that, he was dismissed, as she turned her attention back to Jarvis.  “Arson?”
And it wasn't like anything was actually happening today. Tony kept reminding himself of that as his pen slid across the paper, the noise somehow obscenely loud in the stillness of the conference room. He snapped the cap back on the pen. "Is that all of them?" he asked, and the pleasant, nondescript man in a pleasant, nondescript suit nodded.
“Seven if you count that time in Siberia,” Rhodey said.
Tony licked his lips.  “Don't move,” he said.  His hand was shaking as he stroked Steve's hair.  “You're going to hurt yourself, Steve.  Don't do that.”
Tony set the turnover down on the table.  “Is that what you think?” he repeated.
“I mean, I managed not to laugh,” Darcy pointed out, picking up a tray from the stack.  “I think I deserve credit for not laughing.”
There was a boy standing on the windowsill, clinging to the building three stories above the street below.
“Can’t fault you on that,” Morse said.  “But I also don’t have answers for you, officer.”
And the thoughts going through his head were the exact opposite of behaving.  Tony peeled Steve's arm away from his waist, ignoring the dirty, filthy, horny part of his brain.  It was hard.  That was a pretty big part.  "Buying the whole country."
“I mean, I considered it, but I was assured you had your shit together,” Steve said, ducking around a table.  “Why would you need-”
The silence stretched out, and Steve forced his head up, forced his eyes open.  “Sam.  I think-”  His breath seized in his throat, panic clawing at his breastbone as he forced the words out.  “I think I did this on purpose.”
“Well?”
Steve waited, but he couldn't hear the response.  “What did she say?”
“I'm going to let you have this one,” Tony agreed, squinting down at his phone.  He stopped.  “Goddamn it.”
"No," DJ said, without missing a beat.
"They sell them that way now, means nothing," Tony said, just to watch the pained look sweep over Steve's face.  He grinned.  "That caused you physical pain, didn't it?"
“Yeah, I got that, I'm sitting on that because otherwise I think I'm going to have a stroke,” Rhodey said.  He was pacing back and forth across the living room, clutching his head.  Just watching him made Tony feel tired.  “I'm focusing on other things.”
“Yes.  Yes, it is.” Clint leaned back, the quilt spread out over his legs.  “Say thank you, Phil.”
He smiled back, his pupils dilating a bit behind the lenses of his spectacles, but he shook his head.  “That boy is headed only for a stern punishment,” he said, wagging a finger at her.  “So, we can just-”
“Where do you want them, ma'am?” Steve asked.
For a second, everyone was still.  Then Bruce started shaking his head.  “Oh, no,” he said, holding up both hands like he could ward off the room at large.  “No.  Absolutely not.  I, I do not know what this is, but-”
Tony paused.  “What-  Is there anything I can do to help?  You, I mean?”  He shifted in his chair.  “What does Sam usually do?  Is there a usually in this situation?  Please don't let there be a 'usually,' Steve, this isn't-”
“That's why I'm giving you fair warning, Pep.  Next time?  Next time I'm bringing the suit,” Tony said, stalking up the hallway.
Steve blinked at him.  “It's barely noon.”
“And the cider press?”
“Shut uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup,” Tony sing-songed, still holding Jan’s gaze.  “Van Dyne.  Snap out of it.  This is not a problem.  This is the opposite of a problem.  This is something that we’ll laugh about by the end of the night, or probably not, because Steve looks like he’s going to cry and that makes me incredibly uncomfortable, so we’re going to laugh about this next year, but for now, you’re going to snap out of whatever pity party you’re throwing and focus on the pretty party we’re actually throwing.”
Steve nodded.  “Yes, do you-”
"Oh, no, sir," Jarvis said, his voice echoing down the stairs to Steve.  "I quite take offense to that."  At the top of the stairs, he stopped, his hand resting easily on the railing.  "After all, everyone here is free to leave at any time."  And with the perfect beat timing of a Vaudevillian who'd done his routine a million times before, he gestured to a door at the end of the hallway.  "Right this way."
“Kisses are the best rewards,” Tony agreed.  “Stay here with Steve, then?”  DJ nodded.  “Right.  All my best boys in one place, now, stay out of trouble.”  He leaned over, kissing Steve on top of his head.
Miss Potts's hand flicked through the air as she returned to her ledgers.  "Any number of things," she said, flipping through the pages.  She made a notation, and reached for a different book, checking the dates on the spine before flipping it open to compare it to the one she was working in.  "Engines.  Machinery.  Generators."  Her pen flowed over the page, smooth and easy.  "Medical equipment.  Car parts."  She glanced up.  "Mostly, engines.  Plane, truck, car, if it makes something move, we can build it.  And we do."
Steve scrambled backwards, making a futile grab for the shield, his heartbeat accelerating as adrenaline spiking through his veins.  Bobbi, for her part, didn’t move, her shoulder braced against the still as the stone in the middle of the floor simply dropped down and moved back and out of the way.
“Do you think that will help?  In all honesty?” Strange shot back.  “To see you, to know you’re here, then to see you leave?  Do you think that having to face that only he is trapped, is that beneficial to him?  To watch yet another person head back home and leave him?  Be forced away from him?”
Pepper blinked at him.  “I wouldn't-  I don't know.  Mrs. Parker would know, or maybe Natasha, she probably made it up.  I'll go get her.”
“But you COULD,” Harris said.
DJ looked at Steve, and Steve smiled at him.  “Will you teach me?” he asked.
“I've got a few more,” he texted back. “None about you, though.”
Steve managed a nod. "It's...  Strong," he said.
Jarvis nodded, settling the hat on top of the coat.  “Yes, sir.  Mr. Stark was quite adamant.  I would be happy to escort Officer Rogers, if you’d prefer not to-”
There was a delicate pause.  “Sir is in the kitchen of the penthouse,” Jarvis said at last. “Perhaps you would be willing to check on him?”
She gave him a look, her eyes narrowed into brilliant slits, even as she held out a pale, tasteful card to Steve.  “I bet he knows more than you’d like him to,” she said, her voice silken.  Tony rocked on the balls of his feet, but said nothing.  She turned to Steve.  “Call me.”
“Please tell me you're fucking kidding.”
“That might work,” Miss Van Dyne said.  She tossed Steve's jacket towards the dressing table with careless disdain..  “The vest will work for you and-”
"Uh-huh," Steve said, scooping DJ up and setting him on the chest.  "Well, then, want to help me polish mine?"
“MacIntyre,” Clint agreed.  “And while I love the kid, he’s not on that level.  He is nowhere near that level.”  He spread his arms wide.  “I, meanwhile, kept them under control, sorta under wraps, and absolutely in one piece.  So while my plan was a very, very bad plan, Phil, it was 100% the best option I had at the time.”
“You're thinking about it,” Tony said, and dear God, but that was the hottest thing he'd ever seen. “You're thinking about me shoving you into a bathroom stall and-”
Steve hunched forward over his cup of water.  “Shut up,” he mumbled.  Sam grinned at him, and Steve took a petulant sip of his water.  “I just wanted-” He sighed.  “I don't know what I wanted.”
He took a slow, shallow breath through his nose.  If he was lucky, he was at home, in his own bed, and Rhodey was somewhere nearby, also nursing a bitch of a hangover.  Tony took a moment to savor that thought, that Rhodey was probably in as much pain, if not more than he was.  It was a pleasant thought, mostly because he couldn’t remember much, but he was pretty sure that what he did remember was all Rhodey’s fault.
“The idea,” Tony said, his head tipping to the side, “is to keep it OUT of the water.”
“Is this formal?” Steve looked at the jacket.  He tossed it towards the bed. “I didn’t think this was formal, I don’t-”
“Stop falling in holes,” Tony said, and Clint was going to stab him in the ass as soon as they got off this street.
Jan made a face, even as she spread marmalade on her toast with a heavy hand.  “Yes, well, a childhood of etiquette lessons and dance classes will do that to a person.”  She blew a lock of hair away from her forehead with a huff of breath.  “Even if they weren't to his liking, Tony doesn't like to be bad at anything.”  She took a dainty bite, her tongue flicking out to clean the marmalade off her lips.  “So yes.  He's going to be able to do a waltz.”
“It might,” Tony said, taking a sip of his coffee.  “He’s upset with me.”
“I think Mr. Rhodes will be joining you in the workshop today,” Mrs. Parker said.
There was a beat of silence, and then Rogers said, "Right.  How?"
Steve grinned.  “A DJ crisis.  Gotcha.”  He left his hat and the half-full bag of groceries on the counter and headed for the door.  “Where is he?”
“If I get a double order, does that mean I can have some?” Steve asked.
“Who knows DJ is still here?” Steve repeated.  “There were stories in the papers, of course, when he came here.  It was a publicity stunt, after all.  But you haven’t put out anything saying you’re keeping him.”
“Right, uh, hate to tell you this, but no, you aren’t,” Tony said.  “Because you’re fifteen and not from universe, so, hopefully even if you have a credit card and an ID, they won’t work and there is no way you’re scamming SHIELD or anyone else to get you there, so-”
“Neither are we,” Harris said.
"Maybe," Steve said.  He crossed his arms.  "I think I prefer being an idiot with you than being smart on my own, though."
But everyone was waiting, and he tried to focus on the question.  “Sure?” he repeated.
Obie took it, turning back to the sideboard to set it down.  “I consider this less being a bad influence, and more of admitting even the Irish may be right on occasion.”  He poured in a hefty splash of whiskey and turned back to Tony, swirling the cup in one hand.  “Besides, you’re so tense it looks like you might shatter if I breathe on you.”
And the thing popped into existence.  Right in front of him, so close that he could touch it, so close that he could see his reflection in the smooth, dark surface of the metal.  Harris bit back something like a scream, his heart in his throat, one hand flailing out.
“So.  We’re doing this.”
Tony had never moved so fast in his entire life.  Almost before the reality of the situation could sink in, he was scrambling backwards, lunging out of bed.  In what seemed like no more than a heartbeat, he was halfway across the room, his back pressed hard against the wall.  He stood there, his breath coming in ragged pants, his heart in his throat.
“To Professor Xavier and the X-Men?”  Franklin shrugged.  He shrugged a lot now.  Like things didn't matter.  DJ was pretty sure that things still mattered, and he wasn't sure why Franklin pretended they didn't.  “Sometimes.”
“I’m in,” Carol said immediately.  “I don’t even care about the croissants.  I missed one brawl last night, I’m not missing another one.”
“I'll buy you a cocoa,” Steve said.  He tugged Tony towards the car.  “What, can't you skate?”
“And you didn't see how or where, did you, Agent Coulson?” Gyrich asked.
The song they dance to, just in case anyone wants to know what I listened to ON REPEAT for like an hour while writing the final scenes is "The Night We Met," By Lord Huron.
And his father was seated at the head of the table, a massive tome open in front of him, a tray of sushi balanced on one upthrust knee.
Pepper smiled at him.  “Yes.  Did it work?”
“No, ma’am,” he said.  Then, “You’re the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen.”
Her hand flashed out, a short, sharp movement, and a hand closed over the bowl of the spoon.  “It’s not her.”
“Man deserves a nap,”  Tony said, even as his HUD lit up like a fireworks display. “We have movement at the warehouse, looks like they're trying to collect what's left of their tech.  Captain Marvel?”
“Super funny, not my fault you can't appreciate it,” Sam said, wandering after Jan.  “Come on, Pandora's opened the box, might as well see if we can't find some hope under the bed.”
By the time Tony finished with the pump, it was so dark out that he could barely see well enough to get the key into the hole.  He managed to get the door locked mostly by touch, and slipped the key into his pocket, pushing it down low.   Every door on the estate had its own key, and each key had its own hook on the wall of Obie’s study.
“Forty percent money, twenty-five percent celebrities, fifteen percent politicians, ten percent press and critics, five percent ridiculous flash in the pan tabloid fodder of the minute to draw the paparazzi coverage from everyone else, and five percent people we can actually stand,” Pepper said.
The house was quiet.
The crash woke him up.
“Hold your positions,” Coulson said.  “We're...  Discussing this.”
“Yeah, that’s true.  Thanks. Now, go away, Al," Duck said, his cheek braced on one hand.
"Yes."
“Yeah, lucky we got it before Hammer knew it was here,” he said, scratching his head and leaving his hair a tangled mess.  “Tell him it was great?”
"You're not involved," Tony told her.  He spread his hands wide.  "You're not-  You're not involved, Jan."
Luke paused, a frown crossing his face.  “I honestly have no idea.  Jan?”
“Yes, that’s a quality one, hand it over,” Tony said, holding out a hand.
The door to the chapel lobby opened, and Harris leaned out.  “Okay.  Our officiant is ready and sworn to secrecy, as much good as that’ll do, but I definitely tried and there’s no one else here, I checked, and where’s Tony Prime?”
“So we do have a meeting that I didn’t set up,” Pepper said, her voice flat.
Tony stared at him.  “Shall we what?” he asked at last, more to gain time and the upper hand than because he needed an answer.
Greer shoved an entire turnover in her mouth. “No,” she mumbled around the pastry.
“He’s twelve,” Tony said.  Peter opened his mouth and Tony kept going without a hint of shame.  “You’re twelve, I got you to twelve, and then I stopped paying attention to any numbers that happened after that, and do you know why?”
“Yeah, well, it was a truly astronomical amount of people,” Pepper said.  “A truly astronomical amount of rich, spoiled, entitled people.”
Thanks to @girlbehindtheglasses for donating to charity (a rather intimidating amount) to have this story written, and then for the extreme patience as it took me more than a year to actually do it.  I hope it was worth it.
DJ folded his arms on the edge of Tony's desk.  "Yes," he said, with a big grin.  He reached out, his fingers trailing gently across the thing's back.  It leaned against his palm, a rumbling sound somewhere between a purr and a growl emanating from it.
He shifted the tray to his other hand.  “Now, you have a guest, so-”
"Nonsense!"  She threw a hand in the air.  "Jarvis!  Come-"  She stopped, her head swinging from one side of the room to the other.  She propped her hands on her narrow hips. "Where is Jarvis?"
“His housekeeper was retiring, he said.  Mrs. Arbogast had been housekeeper here since he was a child, and she was done with the job.  And he was offering it to me.”  Mrs. Parker paused.  “He was talking to me, but he was watching Peter, the whole time.  I think-”
“Yeah, considering.” Fury leaned forward, folding his arms on the table in front of him.  “Phil says you had a bad time at Dr. Strange’s place.”
Sam touched his shoulder.  “Now you know how he feels, when you end up in here.”
There was a long pause, and then Jarvis nodded.  “I’ll fetch Mr. Rhodes for you.”
Stark grinned, his face relaxed and amused.  "Yes, well, I am sorry, but he's got a job to do if you'd like to eat."
In front of them was a small raised dais, almost lost in the midst of larger, louder setpieces.  On it was a small table piled with stacks of paper and folders, a small metal goblet, and a couple of candles.  An elderly man, wizened and bent with age, was perched on a rough wooden stool, a bible in his lap and his thin, gnarled hands folded over the grip of his cane.  He looked up as the girls finagled Tony up the single step onto the platform, a smile creasing his cheeks.  Unlike just about everyone else around, he wasn't wearing a mask, but his thick, round glasses gave him a wise, quizzical appearance, and white hair was dusted with confetti.  He was in a robe of some sort, heavy and possibly as old as he was.
Steve held out a hand to her.  “Call me Steve.”
He stood.  “Who knows you’re keeping him?  And who would be in a place to profit from that knowledge?”
"She doesn't care about the show, she just likes watching Jan work herself into a rage about it."  He shook his head.  "There's Luke's 'Antiques Roadshow' and Clint's stupid cartoon movies and Bruce has recorded every single episode of 'Mysteries at the Museum.'"  He scraped his hand over his face.  "Natasha's Bollywood musicals and Jessica's 90's rom-coms-"
“That you could alter your code,” Tony said, and DJ nodded.  Tony cupped a hand over his mouth.  “Grounded.”
Tony nodded, the movement instinctive.  “Any problems?”
He looked up to find Stark studying him, a faint smile on his lips.  Steve smiled back.  "You want to pick the story?" he asked, his tone polite.
Right behind her, Pepper raised a hand.  "I'm going to have to object, too."
It was dominated by a massive, shining metal still, surrounded by big, heavy wooden casks.
Tony reached for the coffee pot.  “I like to think I won that one,” he said to DJ, who was scribbling on his pad.  Tony decided that if the kid was writing all this down, he didn’t want to know about it.  He poured himself another cup of coffee. Maybe this one would make a dent in the throbbing headache he’d had since he’d woken up.
The sound of a camera shutter barely registered, but Steve pulled back, just a few inches. “Would you stop, Jesse?” he asked, but his voice was warm and full of humor.
“You’re the one who harranged me into inviting half of New York,” Tony pointed out.  DJ shifted in his arms, his legs kicking as he settled against Tony’s chest.  He tucked his head under Tony’s chin, and Tony turned his head to give him more space to move.  “If he drools on me, you’ll be picking up my dry cleaning bill.”
Tony slapped his knuckles with a wooden spoon.  “Excuse me?” he asked, indignant.  “You-  I do not take up a lot of room.  I'm practically pocket sized for his convenience!”
Tony smiled, just a little, but it was apparently enough, because she smiled back.  “I’ll be back to make breakfast,” she said.  She looked over Tony’s shoulder, and he stiffened, reminded of Steve’s presence.  “If you can wait?”
"Of what?" Rhodey's eyes slid in Pepper's direction.  "Hammer, or this situation?"
“Instead he found Peter,” Tony said, his voice tight.
She sounded smug.  Which was, really, kind of unusual.  Ellen pushed the pillow away from her face, holding up the photo in front of her.  It took her eyes a very long time to focus.
It should've stung, but somehow it didn't.  Tony smiled at him.  “That's all right,” he said, and it was easy, it was so easy.  “All of my insubordinate help does, too.”
“I wanna talk about the piano,” Darcy said.  “How many people get to say to an insurance agent, ‘my car was hit by a runaway piano?’”
Tony’s eyes squeezed shut.  “Tell me I’m not naked right now.”
“I like books,” Rogers said, one hand cupping his mouth.
Next to Clint, Phil pushed himself upright, fully conscious in an instant.  "What's the situation?" he asked, reaching for his phone.  He squinted down at the face of it.  "It's late."
“And now no one knows.”  Tony rubbed his forehead.  “Fine.  All right.  Fine.”
“Look, there are wardrobe malfunctions here, give me a sec!” she called back.

“But my brother is, of course, fascinated enough that he wants to meet the man who came out of the ice, so once again, against my advice-”
“That's pretty much what they put in the yearbook about us, yes,” Rhodey agreed with a ghost of a smile.
Tony stood there for an instant.  “Again,” he finished, because he didn’t know what else to say.
"It's the closest thing we've got to the concept, especially since English doesn't yet have a word for 'stumbled into an opportunity to get married and decided to take it,'" Tony said.  "I'd suggest we call that 'pulling a Stark,' but according to Urban Dictionary, that phrase is already taken for a number of-" He made a face.  "Less savory things."
Rhodey snorted.  “That’s rich, coming from you.” He snapped his book closed, returning it to the shelf and reaching for another. “When’s the last time that you’ve gotten more than five or six hours in a row?”
There was a moment of silence, then Jarvis dropped into the chair across from him.  “Sir.  With all due respect.  You had a chance with both Miss Pott and Miss Van Dyne, and while I cannot say you will never meet a more remarkable woman than either of them, I will say they are both brilliant, beautiful, witty and winning young ladies who were more than capable of matching you, word for word, and step for step.
Steve smiled at Tony, who was smiling back, and beyond him, he could see DJ, with Tony’s eyes and his own smile.  Everything he’d ever wanted, and nothing he could’ve asked for.  All here.  As far as he’d ever been from home, and yet.
“I’m fine,” he said.  He rubbed the cat’s chin.  “Sorry.  For the trouble.”  He scowled at Furbro, who seemed unconcerned.  “I was…”  His mouth worked.  “Tired.”
Steve frowned at him.  "Mr. Stark, what do you know that you're not telling us?”
“Yeah, but if you've gotta choose someone to be your first, Tony's a pretty good one to go with.”  He pushed Steve's hand down before he could make a worse mess of his hair.  “Right?”
“I’d say ‘worrying,’” Pepper said.  She was reading over Jan’s shoulder, her eyes narrowed into slits.  “Very worrying.”
“Want me to-” Carol started.
Steve shrugged.  “Never really was comfortable with them,” he said.  He swung his shield off of his back, settling it in front of him, braced on a chair.  “Don’t really need one, though.”
She nodded.  “Why?”
“It's not-”
Tony gave his head a shake.  “Been a long day,” he muttered.
“Let’s go.”
“I’ll bring a proposal, just-” Steve tugged on his ear. “Give me the signal.”
“How’re you at oyster shucking?” Steve asked.
“I’ll tell Mrs. Parker to expect you for lunch,” Bruce said.
“Based on when May and Jarvis say he left them and when Jarvis found him, it can’t have been very long,” Tony said.  “Half an hour, max, probably less than that.”  He shifted his weight, his hands in fists in his pockets.  “No one was exactly checking their watches.”
"We're not calling the police, we're not calling anyone," Tony gritted out, his fingers locked on the back of DJ's shirt.  "We're going to-"
“So this is where you’re hiding.”
“Look, he apparently needed the bed, and I'm just being a good host and letting him have it,” Tony said.  His head fell back against the smooth tile of the shower with a thud.  “I live to be a good host.”
“Otherwise know as ‘how you live your life,’ even though you do live there,” Ben grumbled, putting Johnny in a headlock.  “C’mon, hot pants, before the bouncer has you removed.”
Morrison's chin came up. "People like me? And what, exactly, are 'people like me'?"
“Also destruction,” Stark said, and Steve's temper slipped.
“We missed Maria?” Carol asked.
In the silence that followed, Jarvis stepped forward.  “This way, sir,” he said, motioning towards the front hallway.  Maguire stared at Tony, his face florid, his mouth twisted, and Jarvis took him by the elbow.  Steve tensed, but Jarvis turned Maguire with ease, marching him to the foyer.
Steve smiled at him. "You know, you're right," he said, relaxed and easy. "I'm the last one who should be complaining about oppression. As things go, I get off light." He shook his head. "The other day, someone said something..." He paused. "Is 'horrifically homophobic' the right turn of phrase?" he asked Victor.
The words finally sank in.  "You?  YOU disabled your-"  Tony pointed a finger in DJ's direction.  "Have I been fighting your spacial programming for, for-"  He rocked back on his heels, caught between wanting to strangle his child and wanting to laugh until he cried.  "For YEARS, for YEARS I've been fighting with that code, and you're telling me that the reason you run face first into everything is because you deliberately sabotaged your own code?"
Sam threw an arm over Steve’s shoulders.  “I got bad news, man.”
“No,” Tony said.  “I don’t want them, and I don’t need them, and I won’t have them.”  He took a seat, leaning back with a sigh. “Why are we still discussing this?”
Bruce’s lips twitched.  “Try not to tear them tonight.”
Tony opened his mouth, and DJ raised his chin from his knees.  “Darcy’s coming,” he repeated, and Tony exhaled, slow and pained.
“Not what I was objecting to, but still appreciated,” Steve said.  His fingers flexed on Tony’s shoulder, and Tony leaned into it, wanting that contact more than he wanted to admit.  “Stephen-”
Tony was huddled against the door, his body tucked up as tight as he could make it.  “I'm a fucking joy,” he said, his voice flat, and Steve bit his lip to keep from smiling.
There was a grace to the movement, as close to art as he got, a twist of his wrist, practiced and assured, and he scooped up a spoon, using the bowl of it to spread the puree across the plate.  The dessert settled in the center of the design, and he chased it with pinch of glittering power, letting it float from his fingertips.  The flowers had just enough bend to them that he could shape them to the spots where they needed to go, even after the time in the fridge.
Tony nodded.  “Was he cruel to you?” he asked, cupping her face between his palms.  “Just say the word, and I’ll have him killed.”
“Where would he go?”  Jarvis' voice made Tony jolt, his heart in his throat.  Surprised, he looked over his shoulder to find Jarvis standing in the doorway, his hands folded behind his back.  Tony hadn't even heard him approach.
That could be someone else’s problem.
“They’re FISH,” Tony said.  “They’re-   No.  We’re not having this discussion.” To Dummy, he added, “Okay, fine, off with you, go keep all the pets and wild feathery things alive, but I expect you back here in half an hour.”
Phil went still.  “I didn’t tell you him to-”
It was ten to twelve feet tall, big enough to scrape against low, sagging portions of the ceiling, and heavy enough to make everything rattle across the floor in its wake.  Huge feet came up, and crashed down, slow and unstoppable.  First one pushed its way into the lobby, then another, and another.  They moved as one, their limbs swinging in a strange sort of symmetry.  When they stopped, it was as one.  When they spoke, robotic voices crackling from unseen speakers, it was as one.
“Good thing this isn’t an Iron Man costume then,” Clint said, slapping the bag with one hand.  “It’s a Metal Hero costume.”  Tony gave him a look, and Clint grinned back, immune to both censure and common sense.  “Legally distinct.”
"You're not early," Ed called, wiping down the espresso machine with quick, efficient movements.  "He's late."
The young man’s hand hung there, open and empty, between them for another moment.  Then it fell back to his side, his smile losing some of its brilliance. “Of course,” he said, his voice as smooth and polite as ever.  “You’re welcome to wait.  Though I’ve no idea how long it will be.”
DJ looked at him, his face pale in the reflected light of the screen.  "Franklin."
He gritted his teeth.  “Tell me what happened.”
“Okay.  Well, I was going to sweep the snow off of the landing pad for your father, do you want to do that?” Steve asked, his fingers tapping against the sides of his coffee cup.
“He’s not here,” Billy said, snagging Matt by the back of his shirt and swinging him around to aim a joking kick at the seat of the boy’s pants.  “Get back upstairs, no lunch until the beds are made and the floors are scrubbed; just cause Hammer’s not here to yell at us now doesn’t mean he won’t have a lot to say about it when he gets back.”
There was barely a beat of pause before his phone vibrated again. “Should've started clapping then.”
DJ grinned.  “Rap-cal-un,” he said.
“About to get far more interesting,” someone called, and Tony wasn't paying attention anymore.
Tony's breath came out as a laugh.  "Right."  He started forward, and this time, they let him.  "Luke's with her?"
“I also get the feeling that I haven’t got your full attention right now,” Obie said, blotting at the spilled coffee with a napkin.
“You're fine,” Steve said, emerging from the kitchen with a plate of toast and a steaming cup.
He tumbled head over heels and around again, crashing over the table, and from there, to the floor.
Tony relaxed back into the couch as Steve frowned down at the thermometer.  “Ah, I've seen you've met Bucky,” he said to Eli, who burst out laughing.
“It could’ve been a trap,” Steve mused.  “If you were running across the grounds-”
She was slim and compact, clad in a well tailored blue jacket with a slim, crisp blue and white plaid skirt and matching blue hat perched on her smooth copper curls.  Everything, from the perfectly matched string of pearls around her slim neck, to the spotless white shoes on her feet, was in order, not a wrinkle to the fabric, not a hair out of place.  In the filthy, crowded lobby of the precinct, she stood somehow apart, as exhausted officers and civilians alike gave her a wide berth.
Tony gave him a look.  “You don't even know what I'm going to say.”
“In the video?”
“What can I do?” Tony asked, and Steve waved a hand at the table.
DJ shook his head.  “There has to be access,” he said.  “If someone forgets.  Or doesn’t have a-”  He made an aborted gesture, his hand snapping out and jerking back.  “An invitation?  Has to have a way in.”
“Would you have preferred I told you that it made it look like you had a thing for one of our teammates?” Sam asked, his voice flat.
“Right.  Having weighed my options, I’m now on board for that heist,” Tony said.
Laughing, Steve held up his phone, taking a quick shot and sending it on its way.  “What, do you miss me or something?” he asked, tucking the phone back against his cheek.
“My point being, most people here could carry me and any box I choose to pick up, so I'm just going to avoid that humiliation and stay here,” Sam said.  “Keeping tabs.  Keeping everything running.”
Tony looked at DJ. who shrugged.  Tony nodded.  “We’ll figure that out when we get there,” he said.
Sam poured him a cup of water.  “Yeah?”  His eyes canted up to meet Steve's.  “Because I have something that'll make you feel better.”  Steve arched an eyebrow at him, and Sam nodded.  “Ready for this?”
“I'm going,” Steve said, trying not to laugh.  He smiled at Jess and Carol, who were both in workout gear, with matching gym bags.  “Did you get dragged into this?”
“If you invent something, remember you're still under contract,” Pepper said cheerfully.
When they broke apart, they were both breathing hard.  “You taste like sugar and lemon.  You’ve been raiding the kitchen again,” Tony whispered against Steve’s throat, as Steve took one of the wineglasses from him.  “That one’s mine.”
“Do not,” Rhodey said.  “You'll only regret it.”
Caught off guard by the sudden sincerity in his voice, Steve glanced down at the book.  The sketchbook was small, too small for him to have captured much detail.  But the subject of that particular drawing was obvious.
Steve felt his face heat.  “I mean, I was only playing with him because he couldn’t sleep.  I don’t care if we, you know, finish the game.”
“It's also a colossal waste,” Steve said.
Steve tossed the logs into the pile.  “Someone’s gotta cut all this , you know, for you to waste it like this.”
“Thank you, Jarvis.”  Steve crouched down in front of DJ, dropping his bag down next to his feet.  He reached up, his fingers gentle as he pushed DJ’s hair away from his face.  “I trust you,” he said, his voice soft.  “To stay here.  Where it’s safe.” DJ made a face and Steve let out a soft chuckle.  “Yeah, yeah, but I trust you.  To stay here.”
His phone buzzed in his jacket pocket, and Steve glanced up at the commercial countdown as he reached for it. Next to him, Victor was sipping from his water glass. “Well, that was a hell of a thing,” he said, and Steve gave him a lopsided smile.
“Seems like a bad idea,” Steve said.  Nomad trotted past a rattling cart, the engine hissing as it tried to keep pace.  Steve shook his head.  “Know what the benefit is of waking up in Wakanda?”  Bucky shook his head, and Steve grinned.  “After that culture shock, everything, no matter how much it’s advanced, still seems familiar.”
“Come out drinking with us!” Tony called back.  “C’mon, old man, you can-”
“Yeah, it was worth a try.”  Allison dug into her purse and came up with her phone. She pressed the record button and held it  up so Steve could see it.  “I was very impressed with how you handled your congressional testimony, Mr. Rogers.”
Obediently, DJ stood up, just as Harris came up behind his chair.  “You were supposed to stay with Clint,” he said.  “With the car.”
“And yet, warm and cheap,” Steve said.  “Lie back down, you need-”
“Reasonably sure,” DJ confirmed, already looking back out the window.
“I’ll buy you a tiara,” Clint said, taking the box from her.  “Aw, they’re red, this is awesome.”
“I think about murdering my male colleagues at least twice a day,” Jane said, looking up at Thor with a lovesick grin.  He was laughing as he kissed her lips.
“And he loves you, so, he'll show up,” Pepper said.   She set the tablet down, resting her hands on either side of it.  “Tony.  Please don't take this the wrong way-”
Steve chuckled.“What, the four shirts I own?  No, thank you, Jarvis, I think I’ve got this under control.  I’ll be out of your way, soon enough.” Steve tossed the clothes onto the bed next to his rucksack.
“Please don't encourage him,” Steve said, because DJ, sensing an ally, scrambled across the bed to sit next to Thor.  “Going barefoot should be a last resort, not a primary plan.”
Danvers ran her finger across the tabletop, her nose wrinkling as she flicked the dust away from her hand.  “The Captain’s put in an order for another bed, but you might have to take the floor until-”
DJ looked at it, shifting his weight.  “California roll?”
Tony grinned back at him, feeling happier than he had in a long time.  He was pretty sure at least part of that was the drink he'd picked up at one of the stands lining the main square.  He wasn't sure what was in it, but it was definitely alcoholic.  Like a hot toddy, but stronger, and full of spices he wasn't used to.  But it was definitely very, very alcoholic.
“Yes,” DJ agreed.  “I could.”
Steve's stomach rumbled, and he nodded.  “Any of that,” he said.  “And a cup of coffee, if I could.”
Aunt May gave him a look.  “It’s under control, and you have school in the morning.  Back to bed with you, Peter.”
“Where?”
He didn’t want to be here.
They both looked at Greer, struggled to keep a straight face.  “I have a crush on Sam and I wanted Steve’s advice,” Greer said.  The tip of her tail flicked against the bench, then curled around her ankles.
“Welcome!”  DJ leaned against Tony’s side.  “Open,” he said.
In the silence that followed, Tony exhaled, and it came out as a chuckle.  “How,” he said, his lips twitching into a reluctant smile, “do you reduce me to a frustrated child so easily?”
Chewing his way through a mouthful of slivered carrots and bok choi, Tony watched Steve scoop up a bite of egg foo young in the tips of his chopsticks.  Steve caught his eye and paused, the morsel halfway to his lips.  “What?” he said, a smile creasing his cheeks.
“Possible,” Steve repeated.
DJ settled back into his seat, balancing his backpack on his knees.  “No.”
Jarvis smiled at him, and straightened Steve’s jacket on his shoulders.  “I love you. Now go wash for dinner.”
Before he could step away, Tony cupped a hand on the back of his neck, his fingertips rubbing against the skin there.  “We’re not doing the apology thing,” he said, his voice warm.  “Because if we start down that road, I’m going to be on the losing end, and I refuse.”
“That can HAPPEN?” she said.
“So,” Tony said.  “Bathroom or office, or-”
Tony tossed the blanket on foot of the bed and crawled in next to Steve.  “Have you not been lighting the fire?” he asked, and he didn’t bother to take off Steve’s shirt before he settled back against the headboard.
Steve moved a pawn.  “Did you leave the greenhouse unlocked on purpose?” he asked.
DJ shook his head.  “Hungry.”
“He's got the flu,” Steve said.  “He's asleep, I'm sorry.  When I brought him home, he tried to warn me, he tried to say something about an alarm, and I didn't understand.”  He took a breath.  “He sets an alarm so he remembers to call DJ, doesn't he?”
Steve’s eyebrows arched, his teeth flashing in a grin, and Tony nodded.  “Right.  You’re trying to kill me.  Right.”  He pulled away, and that hurt, that was actually painful.  He headed for the sink.  “God, you are going to kill me.”
‘Not helping,’ Tony mouthed at him.  And then, out loud, “No.  Thank you.”
“In New York Now or Out magazine?”
“This is a universal feeling, I think.” Ellen glanced at him. “Didn't wardrobe tie that for you?”
Stark set the stool down.  “Been a few years since I qualified as a child, Jay.”
Tony dumped a healthy amount of wine into his glass.  “I’m not entirely certain that it’s got to be you, but that’s a discussion for a night when I’m not exhausted and on my last nerve.”  He took a long sip, his eyes narrowed at Steve over the rim.  “Not that I have many left on a good night.  I blame the company I keep.”
“Acceptable,” Agatha repeated.  ‘Everyone.  Sit.  Down.”
Smiling, Tony fell into step behind them.  “Jay?  Let Pepper know that we may have a problem.”
"No," Tony said.
“At this point, it's a tossup,” Tony said, and chuckling, the woman lead the way through the back corridors, throwing open the door to the green room.
She gave him a look that was 85% exasperation and 15% affection.  “Not on the list.”
Tony followed him in, pausing in the doorway for a moment to take in the sight of Steve, half sprawled across the plush bench seat, his jacket askew and his hair a tumbled mess. “God DAMN,” he said, dizzy with it.
“Uppity career woman sounds like a great deal of trouble,” Thor mused.  “I should like to date above my station.”
“Awwwwww.”
“All right, one small child, freshly scrubbed and pressed,” Tony said, ushering DJ back into the room.  “I even combed his hair.”
Steve shrugged.  “Why not?” he asked.  Tony groaned, and Steve leaned in.  “No.  Seriously.  Why not?  Tony.  Why can’t he?”  He reached out, tipping Tony’s chin up with one hand.  “He is never going to have to worry about where his next meal is coming from.  He is never going to go to bed cold and hungry.  He’s never going to worry about being a burden, he’s never going to have to hide being sick because he knows you can’t afford a doctor.”
