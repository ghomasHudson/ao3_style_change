"Or that the last piece isn't even here," Tony said darkly as Cap put the piece back in his pouch.  The Nazis having been here already could mean anything.  Maybe they'd found it.  Maybe they hadn't, and they'd given up.  Or maybe they were here for a completely different reason altogether.  "But we have to try."
Tony nodded tightly.  "We unburied him.  We pushed the dirt off his body, and we pulled him out of the hole we'd put him in.  Rhodey cut a line in him, and we—we put our hands in him."  His voice cracked.  "He was still warm.  Just an hour ago he'd been talking to us.  And now we were tearing him apart.  What set us apart from the biters in that instant?  The fact that we were using tools instead of teeth?  He was our friend, and we just… used him."
There was, however, one point where Steve couldn't quite figure him out, despite how much Tony had shared with him.
The next few days were comfortingly similar.  They would ride, take detours to avoid biters and debris when necessary, eat when they got hungry, and then when night fell, look for shelter.
Steve's life, or millions of Americans'.  Bucky dying alone, or with a friend. The safe choice, or the right choice.
Cap looked at him searchingly.  "I'll re-bandage," he declared, pushing Tony's shirt up.  Now that the skin was exposed, Tony could see that there was gauze over one side of his body, but he was still drawing a blank as to why it was there.  Almost as if Cap could read his mind, he said, "It's from the tomb.  I wasn't fast enough to deflect all the arrows.  I'm sorry."
His laptop was still sitting where he'd last seen it.  After Tony dumped his things onto the floor, he picked it up and brought it to his bed.  It scanned his face as usual and let him in, though he noticed that it wasn't starting up, just awakening from its idle state.  A glance at one corner told him that the battery was dangerously low, probably because it'd been left on all night without charging.  Tony grimaced and found the charger, plugging it in before - at long last - settling down to see what had changed.
Some had become lovers, he thought, and he remembered the feel of Cap's hand around his in that little hospital room in Xi'an.
Steve reached forward to take hold of one hand - a hand, Tony was realizing now, that had been clutching at his wrist, his thumb pressed against his vein.  He hadn't even realized he'd retracted that part of the gauntlet.
The woman shook her head, unlocking the car door and opening it.  "Thanks for that," she said as she stepped out with her fingers still clutching her bag, which made clinking sounds as it was moved.  "I thought I was done for."
“This is insane,” Howard says, but despite the doubt on his face, he puts the lifebelt on, and Tony is quick to follow suit.  Sunset’s not an idiot.  Emotionally lacking, maybe, but if she’s convinced something’s wrong, then she’s probably right.  He then glances at Tony, one eye twitching like he wants to continue to berate him—but then he thinks better of it, turning toward Sunset.  “Alright.  Let’s go.”
Tony was momentarily distracted by the little smiley Steve had added at the end - it was likely something he'd picked up from the people posting on Tony's school's message board, and it was adorable that he'd noticed it and used it, especially since he was writing in pen and could have easily done a regular, right-side-up smiley.
"Turns out he doesn't like 'race mixing'," Jessica said.  Luke spat on the ground.  "He didn't realize Danielle was Luke's child until I had her.  But when he did, he wanted to get rid of her."  She held Danielle to her chest protectively, and Steve tried his best not to feel ill.  The world had been turned upside-down, and yet people continued to hold on to the same misguided opinions that they'd had before.  "Our friends helped us get out of there, and the last thing we want to do is go back.  But none of us knew how few resources there were out here."  Her voice broke, but she continued, "Danielle's going to die if we don't get something for her."
Tony grinned as he bent over to point out some places on the suit where Cap could brace himself.  "Hold on tight," he said.  "Because forget walking on water—we're going to be using jet propulsion."
“Yeah.”  Tony grins and steps forward, wrapping his arms around Steve’s waist.  “But it doesn’t matter.  I might be a Stark, but that doesn’t mean I have to be called one.  Oh, I know—what about Chaplin?  Tony Chaplin.  I think that’s a nice name.  Maybe I can pretend to be related to Charlie.”
And given the fact that he didn't really remember all that much afterward, it was probably safe to assume that he'd drunk a lot more than that one shot.
—Then watched as the glow suddenly vanished, leaving nothing in his hand but a distinctly unmagical-looking stone.
discomfort.  So really, this was for himself, but if he could help out the others as well that would just be a bonus.
Tony tapped his fingers against his sheets.  "Pepper's going to go back to the Pacific after this," he said.  "And Rhodey's going back to the front lines, too.  But I don't have any front lines to go back to.  The Army doesn't accept people with hearts like mine."  He cleared his throat again, even though he didn't really need to.  "I can do theoretical work anywhere, not just stateside.  I can do it and do other things at the same time."
"You're bleeding all over the place," Tony replied, voice sharp.  "We have to do something about it."  He looked up and around.  "Wait, look.  We're literally right next to a hospital.  Let's go in and I'll take care of your leg, and then we'll get out of here."
Tony opened his eyes, blinking slowly at the darkness all around.  In front of him was a little pool of light, and it took a few minutes for his brain to process it as coming from one of the flashlights they’d been holding earlier, lying somewhere on the ground now.
They had fuel, they had food, they had the suits.  "Then let's get this girl off the ground," Tony said, and soon enough, they were in airborne, heading west.
“Shh,” Steve interrupts gently, placing a finger against his lips.  “Don’t think of Sunset.  She doesn’t matter anymore.  Just think of me.  Of us.”
Tony snorts, turning around to lean forward against the rail again.  He always seems to be fidgeting.  “I wish it were that easy.  He doesn’t like me, but he likes Sunset.  I don’t like either of them.  But he’s still my
Steve, still outside, turned to look at the two surviving biters—the last one had hit its head upon falling and was no longer moving.  He should take them down, he thought.  After all, he knew full well by now that once they'd reached this point, there was no going back.  If the three of them came back out through this window, leaving the biters alive could cause them problems.
"Though, gosh, I hope I'm not actually broadcasting to the world," continued Tony's voice.  There was the loud clacking of keys, and then the recording ended.
A shadow fell over him, and at long last, Steve was able to pull his eyes away from the woman, looking up at the shooter instead.  Rifle in one hand, trimmed facial hair that had probably seen better days, and blue, blue eyes…
Well, today didn't mean right now, so for the time being, Steve figured he had an opportunity to explore and get used to things.  The first order of business, now that he'd caught up on the latest voicelogs, was to get dressed. So he pushed the covers off, swinging his legs off the bed -
, so what was there to be impressed about?  And super soldier?  Absolutely ridiculous.  Tony had security clearance.  He could access the files on Project: Rebirth.  And he knew that everything
"Damn it," Steve whispered.  But he didn't know what else they could do.  On his own, he could dodge the biters long enough to find another way out, but as much as he hated to admit it, Tony wouldn't be able to make it.  At the very least, he could get Tony into the hallway and open the door from outside if it came to that.  "Okay.  Fine."  Carefully, he set Tony down, steadying him as he wavered on his one good foot.  Then he pressed the shovel into Tony's hand, gripping his shoulders afterward.  "I'll keep them off you until you're through," he said.  "But you—you listen to me.  Be safe, okay?  Just be—safe."
"And let me guess, the tiger circle piece we're searching for is probably sitting near Fu Hao's skeleton… all the way on the far side of the room," Rhodey said.  "Great."
For what seems like an eternity, they just stare at each other, and Tony struggles to figure out what his father is thinking.  There’s anger in his eyes, yes, but… something more.  Something Tony can’t quite make out.
Everyone stared at him, and Stark was quick to jump in.  "Sorry, he's behind on his history lessons," he said.  "I'll fill him in later.  Go on."
Tony blinks at him, then laughs, turning to peer over the rail.  “Yeah, maybe.  Hopefully not in the direct path of the ship, though.  I think that would be unfortunate.”
But it’s not like Tony never sees any of them again.  The world is threatened by galactic enemies on a frighteningly normal basis, and whenever that happens he suits up, flies over, and helps out as best as he can before heading back to L.A.
Then Cap came out through the door, breathing heavily despite not having done anything strenuous, as far as Tony could tell.  "It's done," he said.  "It's done."
," she hissed as she gripped at the wall, clutching her stomach as she struggled to stand.  "I'm going to fucking finish you—"
“Steve,” Tony says, swinging around to face him and taking both his hands in his own, “when we reach New York, I’m getting off with you.”
At last, they emerged from the trees and onto a gravel road that didn't look as though it had seen any recent use.  Still, just because the area
It wasn’t so long ago that Steve had wondered how someone could be ready to die.  How was such a thing possible?  How could someone know what was going to happen, and yet still be able to come to terms with it?
So they disembarked, Pepper and Rhodey taking point as Cap and Tony followed after them.  As far as Tony could tell, there was evidence of recent human activity, but no actual presence.  Whether that was a comforting thought or not, Tony wasn't sure.
“He’ll be okay, then?” Tony asks the lead surgeon as she comes out, and she nods, somewhat pointedly telling him that Steve will recover quickly as long as he doesn’t immediately run off to battle.  Behind him, he hears Carol snort, but the news is so good to hear that he feels his knees buckle, and he has to reach out to support himself against the wall.
He’s in the process of turning back to him when he feels something in his pocket pressing against his leg.
The face Rogers made in response was priceless, and Tony couldn’t help but snort.  “Not surprised.  Okay, seriously, I don’t know what you can eat.”  He dug through his pack, coming up with another sealed package.  “Meatballs.  Better?”
For two weeks, that was how things went.  They'd walk, they'd stop, they'd eat, they'd sleep.  At night, Steve looked at his tags and thought of the soldiers who'd once worn them.  How hard it must have been these last ten years, when Steve was sleeping the end of the world away.  If he'd been awake, if he'd never fallen into the ocean—would things have been different?  Would he have been able to help these men?
The next thing was the pounding headache, which was making him not want to move anywhere.  To make things worse, he also felt as though his mouth was stuffed with cotton; it was so dry.  He wanted water, but he couldn't move. Ugh.
There was no time for this, not when the plane would be back any second.  "Go!" he insisted.  Not wanting to wait any longer, Tony took off his pack and pulled out a gauntlet he'd pulled from one of his suits—he'd thought, maybe, that it would come in handy in case there'd been a cave-in or something, but he supposed taking down an aircraft that was actively firing at them was an alternative, if undesirable use for it.
, but he has to try.  Despite everything that’s happened, though, he and Cap still work remarkably well together in battle, and when the fight is finally won, Steve pulls him aside, eyes shining.  “You were amazing up there,” Steve says, and for a second, Tony can’t remember how to breathe with Steve looking at him like that.
He could hear it already, even if Cap hadn't said it yet.  "But…" he prompted when Cap didn't continue himself.
Tony sat down in the rickety chair next to her bed.  "I'm making something," he said. He would have preferred that she be the one to make it, but she was sick so that was clearly out of the question.
"Tony," he repeated.  Captain America, he decided, wasn't a liar—as unbelievable as the things he'd just said were.  "You say I'm an inspiration and save my life.  You get to call me by my first name."
The other man still looks hesitant for a moment, but then he smiles broadly, and Steve finds himself wishing he could run a thumb over the crinkle of his eyes.  “Great.  Tonight.  I’ll see you then.”
"Enough to see," Birch replied.  His shoulders were low, relaxed—like he was completely at ease in their surroundings.  "I had a helper.  She could use the stone and see even if I couldn't."
Rogers exhaled.  “No,” he said, and Tony sighed in relief before the other man continued, “I think it’s a sabretooth.”
to find a girl who was not only beautiful, but who could follow along when he started talking about turbines and engines and machines.  He’d thought she was perfect.
It was a lot to take in, and Steve wasn't sure he understood how everything fit together yet.  "But you learned otherwise," he prompted.  The "hard way", whatever that meant.
“‘Nick’?” Tony repeated, baffled.  “Since when are you two on a first-name basis?”  He sure wasn’t about to call Fury “Nick” anytime soon.  He suspected Fury felt similarly.
“My heart?”  Automatically, Tony lifted a hand, placing it over his chest.  He hadn’t discussed what had happened with it, not with Steve, not with Fury, not with anyone.  Fury, he suspected, would probably find out what happened sooner or later.  But Tony would make him work for it.  Steve, though… he could tell Steve.  “It’s fine.”
to figure this out?  I need help.”  When Rogers didn’t make any sort of useful response, Tony just let out his breath in an annoyed huff, tapping his fingers on the ground.   “Okay.  Well, obviously, something magical happened.  Do you remember that gem?  It affected me.  My metal plate is mostly gone now.”  He pointed at his chest, since his shirt was still open.  “And I guess…”  Oh.  Oh, shit.  Was this his fault?  Did he somehow turn Rogers into a giant prehistoric cat?
"You did," Cap agreed.  He tapped his fingers against his shield for a few seconds, then continued, "What can I do?"
He wasn’t sure how long it lasted.  Steve wasn’t kissing back, not really, but he wasn’t pulling away either, so Tony felt no need to cut it off prematurely.  Still, he did eventually need to breathe, so he pulled back, gazing at him as his brain fought to catch up, reminding him of all the reasons why that had been a supremely stupid idea.  You weren’t supposed to just go around kissing your friends on the lips, especially not your guy friends if you yourself were a guy, because that just led to all sorts of trouble, and
“You’d be able to fight it off,” Tony assured him, sitting down on the bed beside him.  Since they’d been retrieved by the airship, they hadn’t had much time to talk—Fury and other higher-ups had been hounding them for information since they boarded, and while Steve was happy to share, Tony was less so.  Besides which, he’d had to suffer through various medical staff poking and prodding at the gashes on his arm and chest, despite him telling them that honestly, it was
So Steve gets in and spoons him as Tony curls back against him, basking in his warmth.  For a while, Tony considers saying the three words he’s had on the tip of his tongue for—years now, maybe.  But then he hears a soft snore from behind him, and the moment passes.
Rogers nodded from above.  “I’m going to tie the rope around the rock and then come down.  Is that okay?”
That startled a laugh out of Steve.  Was this the first time he'd laughed since he'd come out of the ice?  It… it felt like it.  "Sorry," he said.  "It is.  We can only talk about normal sleeping."
Steve stares at him, trying to process it—they have a chance?  How is that even possible?  After a moment, though, he remembers to nod, squeezing Tony’s hand back.  “Alright,” he says.  He has no idea what Tony’s thinking or how good their chances actually are or
what happened, and… he just can’t.  If he stays, he’ll find some way to hurt Steve even worse.  “I’m sorry,” he says again, and he forces himself to keep his gaze on Steve even as the other man’s face falls.  “It’s like you said.  There’s a lot between us, and between that and half the people here still pissed at me and everything going on with the company, I can’t stay here.  I have to go.”
, Steve had wrote, even during the heat of the war.  In something of a trance, he has Extremis remove the covering he’d put over his wrist, watching the metal slide back under his skin until his words—fainter than he can remember them being—come back into view.  Once they’re visible, they confirm the one thing he’d feared since seeing his own handwriting on Steve’s wrist all those days ago: this handwriting is Steve’s.  The Thomas Paine quote is about Steve.  According to whatever cosmic forces that be, Tony was Steve’s soulmate, Steve was Tony’s own, and Tony was too much of a goddamn idiot to realize this until it was far too late.
He didn't know was causing it, but it couldn't be anything good, and so he doubled his efforts, pushing against the glass as hard as he could until his hands were finally free.  From there he was able to turn his attention to getting the chair off of him, and then—
"Good boy," Birch said.  "Even better, I already have them ready to fire, and they should be going off right around now."
Neither had Tony, if he’s being honest.  Once upon a time, he’d have been happy to take Sunset to his bed, and they both know it.  Once upon a time, he’d been in love with her.  It was just
Tony nodded, eyes sweeping over the strange markings, faded with time.  “I think so.  It’s not a language I’m familiar with, but from what I can tell, this marks the entrance.”
No one fought.  They got into place quickly, Pepper methodically unbuttoning Tony's shirt to get to his heart as Rhodey situated himself under Tony's arm.  Pepper then glanced up at Tony, the wire in her hands.  "Do I do it now?" she asked just as a loud rumble told them the plane was coming back.
There was a reason for that, Tony reminded himself, but with the certainty of what was about to happen creeping up on him, whether or not he wanted to consciously acknowledge it, Tony found himself not caring.
Steve swallows but nods, taking his hand and squeezing it gently.  “I do,” he says.  Uncertainly, he lets his hand go, stepping back a little.  “Lead the way…?”
A knot of dread settled deep into the pit of Tony's stomach.  Nonetheless, on instinct, he got onto a motorcycle to follow after it, intuiting the controls as Bucky settled in behind him.  The drone was still slow, but it was picking up speed, and they were running out of options fast. Part of his mind screamed at him that this mission wasn't as harmless as it seemed, that there was a real chance that danger would befall them, and that this could very well be it.  Soon enough, it was his whole mind screaming that, and Tony realized he had no choice but to take the coward's way out, because better for Steve to be cowardly and alive than selfless and dead.
She trailed off.  "Oh," Stark said softly from beside him, while Jessica made a choked sound in the back of her throat.
He screamed in pain, fire shooting up the length of his arm, but somehow he found it in himself to tighten his grip despite the agony, a voice in his head reminding him that what he was holding onto was far more important than himself.  He couldn't fail Cap.  He wouldn't.
But just as he took a step toward the door, it swung open, and Tony and the woman stepped back inside.  Steve let out an audible sigh of relief.  "Found what you needed?"
Tony woke up with a start, a flurry of confused thoughts all fluttering through his head simultaneously.  It took a second, but finally the more rational thoughts came to the forefront—he let out a breath, recognizing that while being woken up suddenly was unexpected, he likely wasn't in danger if whoever had woken him had done so by saying his name.  Still, a few more seconds had to pass before he could bring himself to open his eyes, blinking up at the shape looming above him in the pre-dawn light.  "…Cap?" he managed at last.  What the hell was Cap doing in his tent?  It was too early to head out yet.
Steve smiles, and he can’t help but turn and kiss Tony’s cheek.  “I do,” he says.  “Glad you like it.”
Steve gazes back at him in return, eyes intense, and Tony feels his breath catch at the attention.  Then, without saying anything, Steve turns away, leaning over their raft and paddling weakly at the water with one arm.
Rogers didn’t say anything to that, and for the next few hours, they continued to meander through the foliage, Tony occasionally checking the readings on his meter as Rogers rolled his eyes and made disapproving sounds under his breath.  The Savage Land was a strange place, but it was still
"Stark is still unconscious," the man said smoothly, unperturbed.  "The gas we used had previously been untested on humans, and he is not handling it as well as you are.  The paralytic agent he was injected with complicates things further."
Tony held his arms up, charging the repulsors.  The suit could withstand bullet fire.  He wasn't afraid—not of any physical consequences, anyway.  But Birch—Birch was here and Birch hated him and Tony couldn't help but wonder if maybe he could have done something different.  Maybe all of this was his fault.  Things so often were.  "Don't make me shoot you, Birch," he said quietly.  He wasn't sure if he even could.  Birch clearly had bad intentions and evidently didn't plan on stopping anytime soon, but if Tony hurt him, what kind of stain would that make on his soul?  Even though he knew, he
Neither said anything for a while, the silence between them dragging on.  Steve thought—hoped, maybe—that there was something Tony wanted to say, but he couldn't bring himself to.  Maybe Steve had to be the one to say it instead.  Maybe he was the one who had to take the chance.
In the end, Tony walks with his head held high and his shoulders thrown back, striding down the corridor with purpose.  He reaches a door and doesn’t even have to stop, because someone is there holding it open for him, and so he continues forward, finding himself at the bottom of the Grand Staircase, surrounded by throngs of people—the officer with the whistle, the crew members helping people board, Hank, Jan, the Osbornes.  Tiberius.  Sunset.  His father.  Others.  And there, at the top, facing the clock—
Steve wasn't sure if his heart was still beating.  They'd come so far.  They were days—maybe even just
Sunset nods, her fingers coming up and wrapping the jacket tight around her.  “Good luck,” she says, eyes darting between them.  “To both of you.”  A crew member helps her board one of the boats, and Tony wonders if this is the last time he’ll ever see her.
"Then don't," Ma replied.  She seemed to relax then, her body going limp against the bed, head sinking into the thin pillow.  "Stay and remember all these things that have shaped you," she continued, and when she spoke her voice was barely a whisper.  "And stand and fight for those who are important to you. Will you do that for me, sunshine boy?"
"Right.  Well, none of that was enough for us to leave.  Say what you would about him, but that school was damn safe.  Until Jess gave birth, anyway."
A second later, a beam of light was rolling along the ground, from their igloo-thing out onto the road.  In the next second, something massive pounced onto it, and Rogers rushed past him, heading into the street.  “Go!” he shouted.
No comment, Tony thought to himself, even as a small part of his brain thought that actually, he did have a comment, which was that whoever had been speaking was downright adorable.  He tried to ignore it, instead playing the last of the new recordings.
was so dehumanizing, but he couldn't deny that there was a clear difference between the two, even if they were still human to him.  "I'll climb the wall and get what we need.  You stay here."
Steve gets upset with Tony a lot in the next couple of weeks.  He reams him out when Tony technically kills the Crimson Dynamo (even though Tony started his heart up again just fine), complains when he seems to blow off a code red fight (which is probably completely in Steve’s head because it’s far more likely the logs are wrong than Tony somehow missing twenty-two minutes of his life), and yells at him for joking around when Steve is trying to ask him for help (ignoring the fact that the past couple of weeks have involved someone screwing with Tony’s brain and making him
"You don't suppose they'd be so nice as to let us pick our burial spots?" he continued, tongue loose from exhaustion.  "I had a - friend - once. He died off the coast of England, trying to save… people. I always thought that when I died too, it would be nice to have my ashes scattered there."
"Well, you risked your life for me, so it should be fine if I say it twice," Tony replied.  "That's not something just anyone would do.  You didn't even hesitate."
Despite himself, Steve snorts.  “You—you can’t be serious about that.  Aren’t you famous?”  Tony doesn’t seem like the type of guy to fade away into obscurity—name change or not, Steve’s pretty sure he’ll make headlines again sooner or later.
If Rogers rolled his eyes at him, well, Tony couldn’t see, so it might as well have not happened!  But then he took off, and Tony had to wonder if maybe he shouldn’t have goaded him, because—well.  It wasn’t very comfortable.  Then again, could riding a sabretooth bareback
But Fury, for all his conniving and irritating ability to know everything about everyone, had apparently decided not to share this information with Rogers, and so Tony sure as hell wasn’t going to bring it up now.  Let him be clueless.
about him so much?  “Y-you’re ridiculous,” he manages.  Nonetheless, he reaches out, taking hold of Steve’s hands as he continues, “I-I’m blaming you i-if the raft f-flips over.”
"Luck, I suppose," Maya said with a shrug.  She pushed open the next set of doors that they arrived at, and Steve blinked, finding himself facing more green than he'd seen in ages.  "This is our garden.  We have corn, potatoes, peas, carrots, tomatoes, and a few other things we're trying out this year."
that a tiger circle fragment is right here in this tomb, not including the piece we brought with us.  It would make sense if it were buried with her, one of the most prominent diviners of their time."
in the first place,” he says.  “Remember how the Avengers first formed after the breakout?  I technically didn’t agree to that, either.”
today.  And not even in some heroic way, like by protecting Tony from a pack of sabretooths—which Tony dearly hoped would never happen—but by almost falling into a hole in the ground.  Jesus.  “Alright.  No more absurdly wide, deep pits of doom, okay?  I think we’ve had enough of that.”
They fall silent then, with Tony’s hand still against his cheek as they just watch each other in the night.  Steve wants to say something, to
Steve frowned at him.  "What's going on?  She seems fine.  We can't be suspicious of everyone, not in a time like this.  We're all in this together, Tony."
Rogers to know.  He could only imagine his reaction at finding out that Tony didn’t have very much longer to live, despite the constant recharging he did.  Sooner or later, it wouldn’t be enough.  And sooner or later, he’d drop dead.  He’d already exhausted much of the known sources of magic he’d gotten his hands on, and this Savage Land was one of his last hopes.
And for a long time, Tony just stares at him, at the man’s eyes and nose and lips.  He’s not Steve, he thinks.  There was only one Steve, and now he’s gone.
When Tony stops his heart, the other suit goes down as well, and he thinks to himself as the world blacks out around him that if he somehow makes it out of this alive, he can tell Steve
"You would be correct," came a woman's voice from ahead of them, and Steve lowered his shield to see someone standing in the shadow of one of the hospital entrances, two pistols pointed right at their faces.
Soon enough, everyone was ready and assembled, everything packed up and stowed away in their backpacks.  "So let's see this magnet rock," Rhodey said.  It seemed as though Cap had already clued them in on the new development, but hadn't yet actually shown it to them.
He bumped into the pedestal, turning in time to see the golden glove wobble and fall to the floor.  Steve’s gaze followed him, and he automatically brought the shield up in response—but somehow, this time Tony wasn’t surprised when it didn’t seem to put him in his right mind again, though it at least seemed to keep him at bay.  How long did he have left?  Just minutes, surely.  Just minutes to figure this out.  Just minutes to save Steve’s life.
dystopia almost fifty years into the future, was not something he'd ever read or even heard of before.  And finally, the only French word he'd known before his class today was
He sighed, resigning himself to just staying for a bit longer as he turned onto his side, away from his window -
He looked back in time to see Cap ducking his head.  "It's the least I could do," Cap said.  His brows furrowed, like he was thinking hard about something, and then he added, "It's… important.  That you know.
Tony pulled off his outer shirt—almost certainly jostling the gauze around his bad arm in the process, since it ached sharply as he moved—and tied it around his face the way Rhodey had.  And then he ran inside.
Steve didn't reply, his ears straining.  "Upstairs," he managed after a few seconds of silence.  "Someone's upstairs.  Let's go."
at me,” Howard repeats, grabbing him by the shoulders and gripping him painfully hard, and finally Tony lifts his head, meeting his eyes.  “I
Tony’s brow furrowed, not sure what to make of this.  “Well, we didn’t look at all the drawings,” he said at last.  And after being so let down by the ones on the wall of the giant igloo, he didn’t want to look at any of them now.  “I’m sure there’s some we missed.”
“Steve!” he hears, and the voice is filled with such relief it makes Steve’s knees buckle.  In the next moment, the door opens, and Tony sloshes in, running over to him and immediately throwing his arms around his body.  His eyes are a little wild and his hair is a mess, but other than that, he… he looks as well as can be expected.  “I’m sorry!” the other man cries, running his hands through Steve’s hair, breathing hard as he nuzzles against him.  “Steve, I’m so sorry, I never should have believed them, I’m a fucking idiot—”
To his surprise, Rogers didn’t look nearly as enthused as Tony felt.  “I have a bad feeling about this,” he said.
Tony looks at him again once they pull away from each other, and the smile he gives him is much more genuine this time.  “You’re good at this,” he says, splaying one hand against Steve’s chest and gently pressing his fingers into the muscle below.  “I’m convinced.”  He pushes him hard after that, and with a gasp, Steve finds himself lying back against the leather seats again, Tony straddling him as he kisses him once more, hands touching him all over.  “Pants, get my pants,” he manages after a moment, breathing hard before resuming his attack against his lips.
"I hate waiting," Tony said.  He glanced down at his lap, where he'd finished up one of his first arch support things.  It looked… very unimpressive, but it was going to be wrapped around someone's foot, so Tony supposed he was okay with that.  "Here, stick your foot out. I'm gonna put this on."
“That’s what I do.”  Tony’s eyes flicker up toward him, and he grins, grinding his body against Steve’s, causing him to flush and gasp.  “Hard.  See?”
That was the plan, anyway.  It lasted for all of a minute before she lunged again, her momentum carrying her past him.  He kept a firm hold on her wrist, not wanting her to topple over—but then he heard a sound he'd only heard during the war, a sound he never wanted to hear again: skin ripping, joints popping, and just like that the hand he'd been holding was no longer attached to her body, and now it was dripping discolored blood onto the otherwise white snow.  "Jesus," he heard, and it took a moment to realize it was just himself saying it—because the woman hadn't uttered a sound upon losing a damned limb.  Not a whimper, not a cry, nothing.  He dropped the hand and backed away, only to find himself suddenly on his ass—the woman had stuck out a leg and he'd tripped, his reflexes still muddy.  And then she was on top of him, blank eyes staring nowhere as the stump where her missing hand used to be rubbed blood all over his shirt, and her face was so, so close.  But he couldn't do it; he couldn't hurt her.  How could he, when it was obvious she wasn't in control of her own actions right now?  And how could he use force when he knew her body could fall apart at a moment's notice?
Today, though, he hadn't done any of those things.  Losing Ma was still too fresh on his mind, so his activities mostly consisted of eating and staring out the window.  Jarvis had looked at him with concern, but what could Steve say?
Tony holds back his sigh.  How exactly had Steve persuaded him to not jump again?  “Of course,” he says wearily.  The merger.  It’s the only thing Sunset cares about, no matter how much she tries to pretend otherwise.  Money and power—and she’ll have it all once they’re married.  “Let’s go back, then.  Steve… it’s been a pleasure speaking with you.”  He takes Sunset’s arm, but finds himself lingering.  Steve is like no one he’s ever met before, and somehow… he doesn’t want him to disappear back into steerage, where he’ll never see him again.
"Stay safe," Tony called, bringing out his own weapons as the men stationed on the ship started advancing toward him, their guns out.  Tony started walking toward them, the suit brushing off the bullets they were firing at him, and shot at them in return.  It wasn't long before they were all downed—in retrospect, Tony realized that there were far fewer people than there should have been, and the people who
“Tony, calm down, you’re hurting yourself.”  Before he knew it, there were hands—human hands—wrapping around his wrists and gently pulling them away, but Tony kept his eyes shut, afraid of what he’d see.  He didn’t want to hallucinate a dead Steve.  Better to just—to just try and ignore it.
"When am I not?" Tony replied with a wink, even though Steve was pretty sure he wasn't feeling it.  He gave Steve a wave, and then he was gone, closing the door behind him.
it, it was okay.  "You know what—alright.  I'll get the others.  Be right back."  He left and, as promised, returned a few minutes later with the rest of the crew in tow.
When that was done, Steve went back to the pyre and collected the ashes.  Those he took to the nearby creek, and there he scattered them, watching as the water carried it all away and wondering if there was such a thing as the afterlife.
For several moments, he remained frozen in his seat, trying to decide if he should go over and demand an explanation, but Arnie was already occupied with the girl seated next to him, and it seemed rude to interrupt.  Before he could decide, their teacher rapped on her desk with a ruler, calling them to order, and Steve was forced to put away his questions for the time being.
"We're not here for a cure," the man cut in.  "The epidemic has been a blessing.  It has culled the weakest of humanity.  If we could refine it to be more selective, we could emerge from this as a stronger, better species.  We were hitting dead ends before, but your arrival has opened up so many new doors for us."
Steve stepped inside, and as soon as he did, all his misgivings about dreaming of a boarding school fell away.  There was - there was
Though it hurt like hell, Tony wrenched his arm free, gasping as his body shifted painfully while pulling away.  Still, it was worth it for the guilt-stricken expression he caught on Rogers’ face afterward.  That would teach the other man to get all hands-on with him.  “You’re not my boss or my superior officer or anyone I have to take orders from,” Tony snapped, glaring at Rogers.  Tony was so close now, and he wasn’t about to let some Boy Scout stop him—so with that, he spun on his heel and headed in, making his way toward the glowing light.
Steve blinks.  Has he heard right?  Nonetheless, he obliges, slipping it onto Tony’s finger.  He feels like he’s at the altar.  “You look great,” he says with a smile.  “Then again, you look just as great without it.”
“We’re very close,” Rogers replied, which wasn’t much of an answer.  “Hey.  Look at this.”  He stopped, the beam of his flashlight illuminating one of the walls of the building… well, if it could be called a building, anyway.  It sort of resembled an extraordinarily crude igloo made out of dirt more than anything.  “More markings.”
Steve regarded him for a moment in silence, tilting his head contemplatively.  “I was waiting for you to try passing it off as you hallucinating again,” he said eventually, and oh yeah, that was what Tony should have done.  Damn.  “But you didn’t.  So.”  Steve leaned forward, kissing him on the forehead, leaving Tony sitting there wide-eyed and blinking.  “I don’t want to move too fast.  And America needs our help.  Come back to New York with me?”
, and yet you refuse to treat me with any respect whatsoever.”  She tosses her napkin into his face.  “Think about it, Tony.  Maybe eventually you’ll realize what you’re doing wrong.”  With that, she turns, stalking out of the room, and Tony’s pretty sure he’s not imagining it when the door seems to slam shut louder than normal.
Quickly, Steve turned around, locating the bag after a moment and carrying it back with his teeth.  He deposited it at Tony’s feet, then went back to hovering around him, looking anxious.  “It’s
They both broke off, huffing.  Tony glared at him, then continued stubbornly, “I’m not ready to leave yet.”
, and I could pretend that maybe I was going with you on an adventure.  I could see new places, try new things.  And I knew that sure, some of the events were probably exaggerated, but I also knew a lot of it was true."  The blush was back on his face again, but still he kept talking.  "I thought… if Tony Stark could do all of these things, then maybe the thought of me doing a fraction of those things wasn't so impossible.  Maybe I could do more than what I was currently doing.  You were—are—an inspiration to me, Mr. Stark."
This was bad.  This was really, really bad.  He could vaguely recall seeing Rogers passing out seconds before he himself had hit the floor—so what had happened after that?  Had another sabretooth come down and—God forbid—eaten him?  Because Rogers wasn’t here anymore, just his clothes and his shield and oh God what was he going to do.
The bridge appeared beneath their feet.  If the circumstances had been different—if he wasn't surrounded by former people who wouldn't hesitate to tear him apart, if the bridge and the banks of the river weren't littered with empty cars and empty hopes, if the parkway was marked only by yellow and white dotted lines instead of being stained with red—Steve imagined the view from here would have been spectacular, not unlike the quiet moments during the war where Steve would stand in one spot and drink in the sights, his fingers itching for a pen and paper.  But the river was obscured by the mass of biters all around them, and there was no view to be seen.  So Steve plodded on, trying to reassure himself that this couldn't last forever.
He was probably just lonely, he thought as he sat down in the assigned row for students his grade.  Which was ridiculous, given that the very classroom he was in was practically bursting with people. Even Arnie was there - Arnie, who still gave him a nod and a smile when they saw each other even though they usually sat on opposite ends of their row.  Steve hadn't really talked to Arnie for a while, though. Once upon a time, they'd been as thick as thieves. But then Arnie had found girls, and Steve… hadn't, not really.
It’s just the two of them now, standing here at the edge of the ship as Sunset’s boat fades into the darkness.  Tony has no idea what they’re supposed to do.
And then it was over, the noise suddenly vanishing and leaving only a gaping silence in its place.  Tony straightened, still feeling tremors in his body, and looked around.  The airship was even more of a mess now, items toppled and strewn about everywhere.  But it was fine.  They were down on the ground in one piece, and considering the other possibilities, this was actually pretty good.
Steve frowned a little, tilting his head.  "Lucky?" he repeated.  "You designed and built the thing, didn't you?  That's not exactly luck."
Fury nodded, and Tony thought about Rhodey, currently stationed in France; about Jarvis, managing his affairs while he was spending so much time at the Rad Lab; about Pepper, a war correspondent in the Pacific theatre.  "How many strings can you pull?"
.  But it’s not a bad burn.  Or at least, not as bad as it could be.  And Steve knows it’ll get better.  Eventually.  Soon.  He hopes.
getting up,” he tells Steve in the most condescending voice he can come up with, because while he misses Steve in his bed dearly, there’s no getting around the fact that Steve is the whole reason Tony is missing him in the first place.  He’s so goddamn
“T-thanks,” Steve stammers, looking down at his clothes.  He looks quite dapper, if Tony may say so himself.  “So… think I can pass as one of you guys now?”
For some reason, Stark winced.  "…I do love flying," he admitted after a moment.  "And I miss it.  But I don't have my suit anymore."
Not so long afterward, one of the rescue ship’s officers makes his way toward him, clipboard in one hand, umbrella in another.  “Excuse me,” the man says, and he makes no mention of the tears or the redness of his eyes—or maybe in the dark and the rain, he just can’t see them.  “Could I get your name, sir?”
get back—he’d hit Pepper up and see what she could do.  After everything that had happened, the country could do with some good old-fashioned entertainment.  And Rhodey, well.  Rhodey would be so jealous.  But that was what he got for running off to the Army Air Forces instead of sticking around!
"Don't," Tony repeated weakly.   He wasn't even sure anymore what he was trying to forbid, but he needed to stop
The caveat?  The Savage Land was such an unknown that Fury—and by extension, S.H.I.E.L.D.—wanted a nice, long report about what he found.  And they wanted one Steve Rogers to accompany him.
That was a shame, because Tony had no idea what Cap was talking about.  "It makes sense?" he prodded anyway.
Because the thing was, if Tony was being completely honest with himself, he didn't actually have all that many friends.  Sure, he had a lot of acquaintances - guys high-fived him in the hallways; girls batted their lashes at him in the hopes he'd take them out to fondue.  And
Steve rolls his eyes, but he slips his arms around Tony in return, playing along.  “Yeah.  You could get into vaudeville.  Can you dance?”
The next time Tony and Steve face off against each other, Steve has the upper hand, and now it’s Steve who’s beating into him relentlessly, chipping away at Tony’s armor with his shield.
"Find the other plane, and we'll find Cap," Tony said as the three of them rushed on.  Jarvis paled, and Tony clapped him on the back.  "Let's go, old bird."
Tony whines around him, as if there’s nothing in the world that he wants more than having Steve come in his mouth, and the sound alone is nearly enough to make him reconsider—and that’s not even taking into account the most convincing puppy-dog eyes he’s ever seen.  But he has to stay strong, he tells himself, because
“I’m still trying to decide whether I’m imagining you or not,” Tony replied.  “I—here, give me a moment.”  And before he could think twice about it, he leaned forward, kissing Steve full on the lips.
That was what Steve was afraid of.  He sighed, placing a hand over the spot on his neck.  At least it had already stopped bleeding, but knowing the possibility of what was coming next, that wasn't much consolation.  "Bucky was here," he said, not wanting Tony to focus on his own helplessness.
After a few hours, something in his pack made a beeping sound, and he stopped in his tracks, quickly rummaging through the pack to find the offending item.
"You realize that you're supporting the idea of him knowing exactly where we are and where we'll be coming from so that he can prepare for us at his leisure, right?" Tony replied, frowning.  "I don't see how that's better."
There wasn't time for reflection or tears, not yet.  There wasn't even time to reach over and close Yinsen's eyes, because that required a level of dexterity that Tony didn't possess when wearing the gauntlets.  There was only time to move forward.
Stark glared back at him in return.  Then he got out his ice pick, gripping it tight before shoving the cafeteria doors open and storming inside.
"You caught me," Tony added belatedly, making up his mind about what to do next.  "I'd better go back and pack for my actual B-day classes. I'll see you in compsci?"
.  Their only saving grace was that it didn't seem practical or feasible to do it to anyone but people with knowledge they wanted."
Rogers sighed.  Even in the dark, Tony could tell how put-upon he was.  “Stark.  Tell me something.  Do you know where its ‘big ugly face’ is?”
happen, and Steve could only make sure to treasure the time between now and the end, whenever that was.  He'd learned that lesson after having been bound to the stone for so long.  It had been what had broken them apart, but it had also been what had brought them together in the first place.
“Putting it together helps me sleep,” Tony says.  No matter how much his father disapproves of him building anything that doesn’t have the potential to blow things up or kill people, he just can’t keep his hands still.  He likes to be able to take a design, revise it in his head so that it works on a miniature scale, and then assemble it.  It produces such little voltage that it’s practically worthless, but isn’t that what his life has amounted to, anyway?  He turns, smirking a little at her.  “And I’m sure you know that sleeping together before marriage is scandalous and improper, and we wouldn’t want that, would we?”
It wasn't enough.  There was another shudder, and Tony lost his tenuous hold on both the plane and the fabric.  "
Eventually, he reached the end of rows that started with "CA_".  The ones that followed seemed to be made out of gibberish as far as he could tell, though they still ended with ".gif".  The first of these showed a man in swim trunks by the pool. The man looked nice. Steve supposed he could understand why such a pleasant picture was in here.  And the image after that… oh.
“W-what are you doing?” Tony asks, but Steve doesn’t answer, just keeps on paddling.  When the other man stops, Tony looks around—he thinks that maybe he’s facing a different direction now, but it’s hard to tell when everything looks the same.  “What was t-that about?” he tries again.
"Weapons," Tony said.  That was obvious.  "And let me guess, you're going to attempt to set them off in order to destroy something."
Tony automatically tried to jerk his arm away when Cap reached for it, but it was futile.  He sighed.  "I can change it myself."
It’s so cliché, so overly sappy, that a part of Tony almost wants to burst out in laughter, but somehow, he doesn’t—maybe because the other part of him can’t understand why Steve is saying these things.  They’d been together once upon a time, but they’re just friends now.  Good friends, true.  Maybe best friends, even—and he’s all too aware of just how damned lucky he is to have had this chance to become so close to Steve again.  But friendship is where it ends, and he doesn’t get how Steve seems to think differently.
He shone his flashlight onto the glowing object once he got closer, seeing now that it was sitting on top of a small pedestal, decorated with more of those sabretooth drawings.  In the daylight, he suspected that this would all look quite unremarkable—it was just a rock sitting on a more shapely piece of rock.  But in the darkness, it shone a bright yellow, facets glistening the same color as the sun.  If this wasn’t the glowing circle from the paintings on the wall, he didn’t know what it was.
Steve still didn't know what the Tveria was, but it was clearly important to Tony, so he pushed her harder against the wall.  "Then you'd better find them."
Tony considered it for a moment, then ducked into the same igloo as Rogers, turning his flashlight off.  Better not to risk getting separated, since outside of the igloo it was completely dark.  “Okay,” he said.  “But we’re going to keep on exploring tomorrow.”
“My father,” Tony says, eyes fixated on him.  “I punched him.  If he sees us, it’s… it’s not going to be pretty.”
Not wanting to startle Steve, he crouched down slowly, picking the glove up and turning it in his free hand.  Up close like this, it was clear that it wasn’t just a regular glove, but a metallic gauntlet, studded with gems.
Finally, near midnight, a hand was laid against his shoulder.  Steve jolted from his seat, looking around blearily. There was a dark-haired woman in front of him - when had she arrived?  He must have fallen asleep, having curled up in a chair with some paper so that he could sketch what he remembered of the Starks' garden.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says.  He picks his duffel bag up and turns away.  “I’ll be in my apartment if you need me.  We’ll talk later.”
“Absolutely not.”  Next thing Steve knows, Tony is pulling away, doing something fancy with his feet before spinning around and winding right back up in his arms.  “Maybe you should teach me.”
of it.  And though he knew rationally that yeah, he could likely always come back later, they were already deep inside.  Besides, who knew how much time he had left?  Would there even be a
Natasha stared at him, then nodded, evidently accepting this answer.  "I owe the two of you everything and no amount of food or shelter will ever be enough to repay you," she said after a moment.
Steve spent the next few minutes listening to the other new voicelogs, getting caught up on everything that had happened in Tony's life since the last switch.  As he'd suspected, Tony had gone home for the summer, having been picked up by someone named Jarvis. His parents had been away at some conference but were due back… today.
Forgiveness never does come in any of these emails, and Tony doesn’t expect it to.  But despite this, eventually he starts to feel like—like they’re actually
Steve made a faint choking sound from behind him, and Tony quickly turned back, kneeling beside him again.  “Steve?” he repeated.  Was something happening?  Did it work?  Never mind the fact that magic was a total crapshoot—Tony was a genius.  It had to have worked.
"I'll ask again later, then," Tony said.  He unrolled his sleeping bag and crawled inside, Steve doing the same with his own.  Once Tony seemed to get comfortable, he rolled over so that he was facing Steve, eyes shining in the dark.  "Steve?"
“—Was not a mistake at all,” Tony completes for him, because it’s true.  He’s spent a lot of time grieving, and now he’s ready to move on.  He loves Rumiko.  He probably always will.  But the thing about their relationship—the thing that was completely his fault and not hers in the slightest—was that so long as he wore the armor, he could never,
Tony looks at Steve half in bewilderment and half in wonder, feeling like a weight’s been lifted off his chest.  Steve forgives him, he thinks.  Steve knows about the awful things he’s done and he’s still granted him absolution.  “Thank you,” he whispers, not knowing what else he could possibly say, and Steve gives him a quirk of the lips in response.
appeared in them again, that feral wildness that Tony had started to associate with bared teeth and extended claws.  “No,” he whispered, taking another step backward as he felt fear bubble up in him, seeing the last of the sunlight reflect in his eyes and finding it anything but beautiful.  “Steve—Steve, no.  This isn’t supposed to happen.
of Buckys and Agent 13s.  Pages and pages of them, all with varying expressions, though none of them were sad or angry, almost as though Steve only wanted to capture them at their best.  Tony had to wonder if they’d posed for Steve, or if he’d done them from memory, but looking down at the dates confirmed that some of these were only a few days old.  Huh.  He was very good, then.
And so he reached up, placing one hand against Steve's shoulder, starting to slowly slide it up toward his cheek.  Steve could have moved away if he wanted, but he didn't, instead remaining rooted in place.  Once again, there was nothing to hear but their hearts beating in the stillness of the room.
Then again, maybe it wasn’t actually bad.  If there weren’t any living creatures on the mountain, then there was probably a good reason for it.  Like maybe it slowly poisoned and killed everyone who set foot on it, which would be unfortunate.  Or maybe because it was
It’s loud and cold and busy when they make it outside, and Tony cringes, fighting the urge to go back indoors and curl up.  This isn’t what he needs right now.  From what he can hear, it’s not what a lot of other people need right now, either.  One woman is telling her maid to turn on the heater for when they get back inside, and there’s a man calling for someone to bring him a drink.  Tony’s tempted to join in on that.
"I know you know what this is," Birch said.  "And I know you have the other pieces."  He set the piece down on his palm, and they all watched as it oriented itself toward Cap, seeking to be reunited.  After half a second, he closed his hand, then rested it on his lap.  "I can only imagine what could have been accomplished had I had the complete relic.  But the beauty of it was that even the one piece was enough."
That conversation hadn't been nearly as enlightening as Tony had hoped, but he nonetheless nodded, allowing the change in topic.  "Let's go."
And it’s good, Tony thinks.  What they have is good.  He has other friends, of course—good friends, great friends.  But they all know different parts of him, and right now Steve knows best the part that’s most important to him.
If Tony had known that years from when Steve had asked that question, he'd be here in the Atlantic to find his body, what would he have done?
To his surprise, Rogers shook his head.  Tony frowned.  “What?” he asked.  “That’s a mountain.  The tallest one.  So we should go there.”  Rogers nodded at this; Tony’s frown deepened.  “So what’s your problem?”  Of course, since Rogers couldn’t say anything, he couldn’t answer, so Tony sighed, rubbing his forehead.  And then it came to him.  “Oh.
liked knowing what he put down as his homework answers for the math and science classes.  In that sense, he was quite popular. But how many of those people cared to go head-to-head with him on more challenging concepts or actually wanted to listen to him talk about microrobotics?
Tony's hands were back in his hair. "Don't start with that kind of talk, Steve.  Come on.  You're a super soldier.  You gonna let Hydra get the better of you?"
Tony goes on the run, moving from New York to Los Angeles to France to Russia to Kazakhstan as his memories trickle away from him.  Pepper finds and joins him at one point, but Tony has to leave her behind when they’re attacked, and the guilt of his actions weighs heavily down upon him.  Dimly, he remembers that there’s something
In front of them stretched a large, deep ravine, one he couldn’t see the bottom of and seemed to go on in both ways in front of him.  Could they just follow the edge and hope they’d come to a part where it’d end eventually?  How much time would that take?  And what if it ended at somewhere like a cliff?  Frowning, Tony got off of Rogers, then carefully dropped a rock into the pit.
Well, technically, he wasn't yet, because despite his apparent best efforts, no one wanted to enlist him - something Tony couldn't exactly blame the recruiters for, to be truthful.  But he was, according to the forms Tony had seen lying around, trying his best, and Tony had an uncomfortable feeling that Steve would be persistent enough to actually succeed.
Tony had read the details once.  There weren't many available to the general public, but what little he'd seen hadn't been pretty.  And yet it had been almost horrifyingly predictable - Captain America, war hero, had died doing something heroic during the course of the war.  The exact cause of death had never been revealed, but whatever it was had involved partial remains being recovered from the English Channel, which had then been buried at Arlington National Cemetery.  And so it was only the tales of Cap's deeds that had lived on past the end of the war, while Cap himself never survived to see it.
"James is a common name," Steve said as gently as he could.  Tony's shoulders slumped.  Steve sighed, running a hand through his hair, then continued, "Alright, well, that's certainly very distinctive.  Navy Yard, metal arm.  We'll take a look for you."  He would have taken a look for her
“Yeah,” Tony replies, bolting out of bed.  If the Avengers are calling him now, something bad is going on and they need his help.  “What’s happening?”
He sighed.  Fretting wasn't going to accomplish anything.  Action would.  So he limped around the room, looking through everything.  The drawers and trash can were all empty, which told him that this room wasn't normally in use.  Unfortunately, that didn't tell him anything particularly useful.
And it’s strange, Tony thinks, how he can be here floating on a glorified piece of debris in the ocean and still have his breath taken away by those three words—three words that he himself can’t yet bear to say.  But it’s stupid, really.  So damn stupid.  Because he does love Steve, more than he’s ever loved anyone in his entire life, and if—if tonight is it—then doesn’t Steve deserve to know?  Tony thinks he does.  So slowly, he reaches down with both hands, even though it makes his bad shoulder ache again, and he takes hold of Steve’s, squeezing gently.  “I love you too,” he whispers back.
Tony rubs his face with both hands, wishing he were elsewhere.  “How can I?  You humiliate me about it every chance you get.”
For a while, both of them sat there in silence, staring at the walls.  Tony had thought Steve would say something more, but it seemed like nothing was forthcoming.
“I—no, of course not!” Tony stammers, trying once more to step back.  “This is my own decision, Steve.  I don’t want to see you anymore.”
That didn't sound like a very reliable plan, but Steve supposed he wasn't exactly keen on getting himself bit to see what would have happened.  "So back to the dead part, then.  How do we know it's not reversible?"
Evidently, his father is thinking the same thing, because he idly checks his watch before looking at Tony, eyes hard.  “How much do you think that drawing would be worth by morning?” he asks conversationally.  “It’s a shame I had it destroyed.”
Tony was staring at a building further down the street, twitching a bit when Steve said his name.  "Sorry," he said.  "I just… I think I saw something.  Metal."
The screen turned on, showing a plain white background with a horizontal white line moving up and down.  Steve blinked at it confusedly, about to put the strange contraption away when suddenly a fuzzy voice - not unlike the fuzziness he'd hear on the radio, but stiffer somehow - announced, "Facial scan accepted.  Welcome, Tony Stark."
"Oh, my God," Steve managed brokenly.  It was him.  He was the reason Tony no longer had a suit.  If things had been different, if Tony hadn't wasted the suit on him…
He was finishing up the last of his explanation when the airship jolted again, and Tony stumbled forward, finding himself very suddenly in Cap's arms.
"We know who you are, Tony Stark," Yinsen translated.  "You are an American weapons inventor, and we are very interested in your work.  Create something for us, and we will have a surgeon save your life."
, Tony’s just thrown away his life for him, but his heart feels like it’s about to burst.  “You’re the most brilliant, amazing idiot I’ve ever known.  But you’re my idiot.  And I love you.”
But then for some reason, his traitorous brain thought it'd be funny to make up bizarre terms like "lateral a-skips" and "single-leg hip flexions" that everyone else in his dream understood, but not him.  He was able to pick up a little bit on what they were by watching the others, but it was too little, too late. By the end of the practice he was worn out, the coach was giving him disappointed looks, and Ty looked like he was on the verge of laughter.
Tony let out a start of surprise, then immediately hissed in pain—Cap had almost been done removing the bandages, so he'd moved right when Cap was peeling them off the wound itself.  Great.  "Ow.  God.  How—how'd you know about Virgil?"
, it made his heart ache.  Sure, Steve had said it was for Mom, but honestly, Tony saw it as a gift to himself as well.  Steve didn't owe him anything. He certainly didn't owe him
Steve closed his eyes, exhaled, and then he opened them again, his gaze seeking out Tony's.  "I love you," he said.
, that was painful.  Alright, fine, now he knew.  No matter what, he’d have to make sure this thing didn’t fall out, because it was going to hurt like hell otherwise.
That’s all the invitation he needs.  Tony finally closes the gap between their lips, kissing him—gently at first, afraid of pushing too hard—but then Steve’s tongue slips into his mouth, and God, it’s obvious that Steve has wanted this just as badly.  He can’t pull away, and he doesn’t want to.  So they kiss and they kiss and they kiss as the ship sails into the sunset, and in this one beautiful, glorious moment, Tony knows he can do anything in the world with Steve by his side, come what may.
"Yes, doctor," she said, obligingly drinking the rest from her cup.  She coughed again, which was worrisome, but Tony didn't know what else he could do about it.  He settled for getting her some water, which she accepted gratefully as Tony settled back down to sew some more.
"In solving problems about radar until you fall asleep at your desk from exhaustion because you don't want to think about anything else?" Fury supplied.  Tony frowned.  Who the hell was Fury getting his information from?  "That's very noble, Stark.  Admirable."
There was a flurry of movement, and the next thing Steve knew, he was being kicked hard in the chest, his grip on her loosening.  Then she was standing in the doorway, half-crouched and eyeing them warily as one hand rested against the holster on her hip.
Though Tony was still suspicious about anything involving Fury, he picked the folder up again anyway, flipping past the first page—a description of a stone fragment purported to have great powers (which, frankly, sounded like most things he had hunted down in his day)—to see a write-up on why this was suddenly significant to the United States.  "So you want this because the Nazis want it," he said when he was done skimming.  "So what?  They want a lot of things.  They go on wild goose chases all the time."
“Sorry,” Tony continued with a sigh.  “Look, Steve, I want to share something with you, if you want to listen.  Do you know why I had a metal plate over my heart?”
Steve shivers, tilting his head to give Tony easier access as one hand slides up his back.  It’s been a while since he’s been touched this way.  “I-I don’t know about that,” he manages.  “I’m just a guy—”
Steve groaned and tried to squirm away, eyes landing on Bucky's body.  "You killed him," he managed, struggling to keep his eyes open.  "I found him… and you killed him…"
Tony suddenly felt very uncomfortable, and he quickly pushed his chair back so that he could stand up.  "So can I go now?"
.  He doesn’t care that he’s known him for all of what, two, three days?  It doesn’t matter.  None of that matters.  The only thing that does matter is that Steve is the most important person in his life, and Tony is leaving him to die alone.  After everything that’s gone on, after all they’ve been through… is this how it ends?  Tony being lowered away to safety, while Steve remains on a doomed ship, certain to die?
Steve blinks again as he moves up to stand beside Tony.  It’s rare to hear someone of Tony’s standing openly criticizing their spouse.  Or spouse-to-be, anyway.  “Really…?” he asks.  “Wanna talk about it?”
Rogers sighed and made a shrugging motion, as though he didn’t really like what he was hearing but couldn’t do anything about it.  Well, two could play at that game.  Honestly, Tony had to wonder what would happen if they failed to make it in time, but they’d cross that bridge once they got there.  Everything was going to be fine.
day—away from Bethesda.  And now he felt like his world was ending.  "I don't understand," he said finally.  "Always been too late?"
Tony really doesn’t want to say it, but it doesn’t seem like he has much of a choice.  “Look at us, Steve,” he says, jabbing a finger at him.  “Look at us standing here and trying to pretend everything is normal by talking about the Avengers.  But everything’s not normal, and you know it.  I hurt you.  I can’t even remember it, but I hurt you and you died because of it, and meanwhile my last memory of you is us being happy together.  I look at you and all I see are the mistakes—”
"Okay, I'll be serious now," said Tony's voice.  It was quieter but louder at the same time, and Tony could imagine himself speaking softly, intimately, his lips close to the laptop's microphone.  "Hey, Tony. You don't know me, but my name is Steve Rogers, and I've been you for a day."
"Biplanes," Pepper said, holding a hand up to block the sun as they emerged into the light.  Tony scrunched his face as he put his flashlight away—they'd been in that dark tomb longer than he'd thought.  "Umm.  Reminded me of a Jean, which I've seen while with the Navy, but I don't think they'd be this far inland.  Maybe a Perry?  I've seen pictures and it could be that."
"You're sorry," Tony repeated flatly.  "You stopped me from turning into an arrow-filled pincushion and you're
Steve shook his head again.  He jabbed one paw at Tony, like an owner motioning for their dog to sit.
"Are we?" Steve asked, his gaze falling onto the pistol.  He didn't feel ready.  He didn't think he would ever feel ready.  But he'd told Tony he'd do this, and he'd rather die than go back on a promise like that.
"Don't be."  Carol turned to Jessica then, laying a hand against her arm.  "I wish I could've done more."
Rogers shrugged.  It looked like he’d started a fire and was heating… something.  “I stayed up for several hours after you passed out,” he told him.  “Then I slept for a while, and then I woke up again and you were still sleeping.  I was seriously considering just lugging you out of here myself.”
“Dammit,” Rogers breathed from somewhere above him, quickly scrambling off and laboriously shoving the cat’s body off him.  “Stark.  Tony.  Are you okay?”
Practice went as it always did, culminating in him scoring a narrow win against Ty in their final sprint.  Tony was feeling pretty good as he walked out of the locker room once he'd showered and gotten dressed again, Ty frowning as he followed after.  "You don't have to look so disappointed, Ty," Tony told him on their way to the cafeteria. "It's not like this hasn't happened before." Plenty of times, even.
Tony fell silent, trying to hear it.  Once he managed to filter out the sounds of their own breathing, yeah, it was pretty loud and clear—there was sort of a deep, throaty element to it, which might have been nice in an entirely different context but was mainly terrifying now.  “Shit,” he murmured.  “Do you think it’s heard us by now?  Scratch that, of course it’s heard us.”  It was probably listening to him right now, and wasn’t
They passed by more drawings as they headed deeper into the city, but much of them were similar to ones they’d already seen before, of harried humans and somewhat majestic big cats.  Apparently, whoever had lived here really had a thing for sabretooths—even if personally, Tony would have chosen to worship a dinosaur.  Who wouldn’t?
"Of course I do!" Tony snapped, surprising even himself with his vehemence.  "I should have—should have planned better.  Should have been more careful.  Shouldn't have gotten shot."
guest,” Howard snaps.  He looks like he wants to say more, but Sunset’s presence is stopping him.  For once, Tony is grateful that she’s around.  After a moment, though, he seems to force himself to pull away, even though he’s still seething, then turns to Steve, eyes full of contempt.  “So, boy,” he grits out.  “Do you
Steve thought.  He tried to put the pieces together.  Looking forward to Arnie - it sounded like he'd somehow made plans to see Arnie, which would certainly have been something nice.  He saw Arnie so rarely these days. But he was going to bring someone with him to see Arnie, and that person was still undecided. On top of that, he had a week to figure out who that person was going to be.  But Ma was confident that he could find anyone he wanted.
"I looked through your belongings," the woman replied casually, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.  "I take it it's important."  Tony went pale, immediately turning to his bag as the woman continued, "There's no need for that."
"Christ, Steve," Tony said, turning his hand up so he could squeeze Steve's own.  "First off, everyone is needed.  Second,
Tony offered him another small smile.  "It's nothing," he said.  "Anyway, now that we know you're okay… you should get some rest.  I promised Natasha I'd put together a coffin for Bucky.  When I'm done we can do this together.  So just relax, okay?"
"Okay," Tony replied softly.  Steve didn't know if he really meant it, but… it was a start, at least.
"We all did," Stark replied, and a sharp, bitter bark of laughter escaped his throat.  "The Axis powers surrendered.  Hydra surrendered.  We had trials for them and everything at Nuremberg.  A lot of them were hanged."  Steve winced, but Stark barreled on.  "But apparently that bullshit about more heads appearing was true, because as it turns out, Hydra still existed underground, and they were working on something.  And… they infected us with it.  Every single one of us."
Steve quickly stood up, even though putting weight back onto his bad leg made him wince.  "Wait a second," he said.  "I can come too."
of it.  "…And what about you?" he pressed.  "Maybe you need some rest, too."  She looked pretty worn out.
Damn it.  Birch still had some fight left in him, and he was using it to distract the only person who had any idea what was going on.  "Cap!" Tony called out sharply.  Cap spared a glance at him long enough to show that he'd heard, but he immediately turned away again to continue defending himself.  "You know what the passphrase is—you're gonna have to input it.  I'll take care of Birch!"
came up with this because…?" Tony asked as he hastened to pack everything up.  Now that he had an actionable lead, he didn't want to wait.
"Until they did," Steve said.  He remembered Tony mentioning at the beginning that this was all Hydra, and it didn't seem unreasonable to believe that if they could make Baron Zemo, they could make the biters.  "…But I still don't understand how you have any part in all this."
"What choice do we have?"  Tony's gaze flickered toward him again - sure enough, Yinsen was still looking his way.  "Everyone here knows I'll be dead in a week."
There was a spark of light as Rogers brought out his lighter, making a little fire inside the igloo, which apparently had a fire pit inside.  “I’m stopping for the night,” he replied.
"You heard me," Stark said, his brow furrowing a bit as he watched Steve with concern—genuine or not, Steve wasn't sure at this point.  "I know.  It took us ten years to get you out.  I…"  Stark paused, taking another deep breath.  "We thought you were dead.  I'm sorry."
But that was the other thing.  He was looking at these things now and he didn't know for sure what they were—and yet they still seemed familiar, like machines he'd come up with in a dream that had since faded from his memory.  How was this possible?  How could he not know what these things were while still feeling like he did, somewhere deep down inside of him?
Tony was scared.  Just the idea of Steve somewhere out there, all alone as the sun set—it was enough to make his throat go dry, to make his chest constrict painfully.  Because once that sun went down, and they weren’t at the top of that mountain, then based on Tony’s best guess, Steve was going to stay a sabretooth.  Worse, Tony feared that he was going to stay an
Steve was curious - how could he not be? - but he also wasn't sure he could handle learning so much more this late in the day.  "I think I'm good tonight."
“Oh, please,” Tony replies, taking Steve’s hand and pulling him in as well, motioning for him to shut the door.  “I’m first class.  You know how we love bossing people around.”
"I - " Tony began before grinding to a halt.  What was there to say? That the so-called "history garbage" he was reading was him desperately trying to learn as much as he could about Captain America's death?  That he was praying that he could learn enough to somehow stop any of it from ever happening? And that, hell, it wasn't even about saving Captain America, but of the wonderful, kind man behind the mask?
believe it.  It had happened once, Steve told him, the day he’d been found in the ice.  He’d gotten out of their sub, left to save a girl, and then she’d shot him.  He’d been okay back then, Tony remembers, and he tries to convince himself that Steve will be okay now.
down there.   But up here?  Nothing.  Honestly, he wasn’t sure if this was worrisome or not—less predators, good, but no living creatures at all, bad.
There wasn't much time for Tony to really even think through it - to go through that complicated mix of emotions that was his guilt, his regret, his sorrow, and now, maybe, his relief that maybe Steve could at least finally be put to rest.  Because nearly as soon as he was pulled inside the sub and laid down on the cot, Steve
, just to make sure that Steve was going to be okay, his body, apparently, was having none of that.  He found himself involuntarily collapsing onto the floor, the gauntlet slipping from his limp fingers as his vision went black around the edges.
Steve wasn't a Stark, though.  It therefore followed that he should be allowed to cry, if he hadn't already, and the way he kept on making half-assed attempts to find positives while skimming over all the negatives kind of implied to Tony that he indeed hadn't.  And if Tony didn't let him know this, then who would? Not Dougie, who'd seemed to react to the news with his own brand of denial. Not Arnie, who Tony had tried to get closer to with only partial avail, leaving him mostly as a childhood friend from the past.  Just himself.
“Jesus, Steve,” Tony managed weakly, looking back at him.  “What the hell are you saying?”  Vividly, he remembered shooting twin blasts into that other sabretooth’s mouth, but… “Do you want me to
Jarvis' gaze flickered to Tony and back.  "That's true," he agreed gruffly.  Why did everyone want to talk about him like he wasn't right here, Tony wondered.
"Well, we made it," Tony said.  "That was more harrowing than I would have generally preferred, but I have to admit, that sort of thing always sold well back during my
"Bullshit," Ty said, getting right into his face to hiss the word.  "But fine, I don't care anymore. Read your stupid history book. I'm leaving."
Steve, even if his eyes had gone kind of weird.  “Thank God,” he said, standing up and heading into the clearing.  “Why did you—”
“On it,” came Rogers’ voice, and then there was a loud thump and the sound of an extremely pained roar; in the wild light of the flashlight, Tony could see the glint of the shield as it rammed into the cat’s body.  “Try again!”
Tony tried to throw his arms up in exasperation, but all he accomplished was another wince as he was painfully reminded of the fact that one of his arms really should not be moved right now.  "You did this earlier, didn't you?" he tried instead.  "I remember."
Cap shrugged.  "You don't have the clearance," he said.  "And anyway, it doesn't really matter who I am."
Tony pursed his lips, sitting up long enough to check the controls again.  "It's a solid day of flying," he said.  "But I think we can do it.
"Just pass it on if anyone else needs help," Steve said.  "Things are tough out there.  We can't afford to waste time hurting each other."  Tony gave him a glance and a half-smile, nodding along.
He was pointing at the ground.  Steve followed his gaze, his eyes going wide as Jessica gasped.  There were bodies there, the concrete beneath them red with blood and bodily matter.  "Jesus," he breathed.  Beside him, Jessica turned and buried her face in her hands.
“Maybe.”  Tony bites his lip and peers over the rail again, thinking about the diagrams he’d studied earlier.  It’s a well-built ship, and it can withstand
“Hi,” Steve says back, breaking into a tired, but nonetheless dazzling smile, and Tony finds himself taking back whatever he’d been previously thinking about Steve looking awful.  “You’re up.”
It was obviously a lie.  If they could have operated on the shrapnel making its way toward his heart right now, they already would have so that they could keep on pumping work out of him while he remained in their captivity.  As things stood, it seemed pretty clear that he was going to die in the very near future, so hell if he was going to spend it working for these asshole terrorists.
"And the Japanese will still be in this capital city you've been blathering about, and for all we know the Nazis will wind up there too."
…”  Then he readjusts his arm, quite unnecessarily brushing a hand against his chest as the other man shivers.  “And your arm like that… there.”
A few keystrokes later, Tony was in his voicelogs folder, staring at three new entries that definitely hadn't been there before.  Was this it, he had to wonder? Was this going to tell him the truth of what had happened the day before?
Tony blinks, looking mildly surprised.  “No one… no one ever touches me like that during sex,” he says at Steve’s questioning gaze, and Steve’s heart aches at the admission.  “Keep—keep on doing that?”
"Turkey," Cap repeated.  "Okay.  And when you say she won't fly for long… do you think she can make it to Turkey?"
Steve nods without looking down, unable to pull his gaze away.  “It’s fine.  I’d do it for free, even.”
Then Tony laughed.  He put a hand to his mouth, and from the way his eyebrows creased, Steve wasn't actually sure if he was laughing or crying.  Steve realized with a jolt that he was doing both.  "Hi," Tony repeated, and his eyes shone with fresh tears.  Without thinking, Steve reached up—mildly surprised that his limbs were working as expected—and brushed them away with a thumb.  Tony didn't pull back.  "You're miraculously alive even after crashing a plane into the Atlantic, and that's what you come up with?"
Steve still isn’t happy about this, Tony can tell, but he eventually nods.  “Okay,” he says.  “When are you leaving?”
“Not without you,” Tony repeats, lifting Steve’s hands and studying the handcuffs.  He lowers them after a moment, looking back at him.  “Steve, you… you made my life worth living.  There’s no way I’m just going to leave you here to drown, not after everything that’s happened.  So don’t argue, because I’m not going to listen.”
To Tony’s surprise, he can see Sunset swallow, and for the briefest of moments, there’s a spark of affection for her.  Despite everything that’s happened, despite the fact that he has no idea if her hesitation stems from the fact that she actually cares about them or if she’s just thinking about what this might mean for her business prospects, he takes off his lifebelt, then shrugs off his suit jacket and wraps it around her before putting the lifebelt back on.  “Go,” he urges.
Steve wordlessly turns back toward him, reaching over and curling around his body—and somehow, Tony feels a little bit warmer now.  Or maybe he just feels less cold.  “I love you,” Steve says, very quietly.
They headed back into the cafeteria, stepping around the fallen biters, dead and undead alike.  "Is there anything else worth taking a gander at while we're here?" Stark asked.
“It does to me.  Come on.”  Taking Tony’s good hand, he leads them to the dining room, which by now is abandoned—he can already see water creeping in.  He approaches one of the tables, whisking the tablecloth right off and ignoring the clatter of the utensils as they fall to the ground.  Then he turns to Tony, wrapping it securely around his shoulder before tucking the ends in so it won’t fall off—Tony squirms and hisses in pain as Steve works, but otherwise remains still.  “There,” he says once he’s done.  Now hopefully he’ll stop losing so much blood.  “That feel better?”
Soon enough, though, Steve's actual words registered in his brain, and Tony could feel fear welling up within him.  Someone had let him join. He was going to go to war - and not just any war, but the deadliest war in human history.
Any further conversation was halted by the sound of a gunshot, and Steve winced, trying to will the ringing in his ears to go away.  Once his hearing had calmed down, he looked back just long enough to make sure the gunshot was what he'd thought it was, then quickly turned his attention to the boxes again, taking a deep breath.  It had happened.  It had really happened.
"You don't need to go anywhere," Maya said.  He realized now that she was holding a syringe which was already filled with blood.  His own?  "Steve, don't you realize?  You're the key.  There are more important things now than an irrelevant weapons designer."
Rogers nodded slowly, turning around and heading partway back into the tunnel.  Then he faced Tony again, and Tony couldn’t help but feel a little stab of guilt.  Bad enough that whatever he’d done had caused Rogers to change… but to know it may very well lead to something awful like falling into a deep ravine?
And, maybe, if he were being honest with himself, he was a little afraid of what he would find if he did go looking.  What if Steve had actually passed away a few years later? Or what if he'd passed away a few years ago in Tony's present?  What if he'd changed and wasn't the same person Tony had grown to - to care deeply for? There was one way things could go right and so many ways it could go wrong, he felt.
Before he knew it, he was yawning into the blankets, having pulled the black box into the bed with him to listen to it all.  But he wasn't ready for sleep, not yet. There was still one more thing he wanted to try - an option on the right side of the screen that said "RECORD".
Tony nodded.  "Hold on to me, Cap," he said.  He made a few more adjustments, shifting his stance as he sensed—since he couldn't see—Cap coming up behind him, arms cautiously wrapping around Tony's metal body.  The alarms went quiet with one more flick, the flashing lights following suit in the next second.  "Three… two… one—"
It couldn't last forever, though.  Eventually, a thick cloud of smoke appeared on the horizon before them, blocking out the sun as they got closer.  "Philadelphia's still on fire," Tony murmured.
It’s been ten years, he thinks.  Ten years since he sat this close to Steve, neither of them wearing a mask or having to worry about an oncoming battle.
He turned and left, and it was just Tony now in the burnt-out room.  He spent the next hour moving things around and fiddling with configurations and controls as Cap was in and out, giving him updates about the ship's status and at one point making him take some pills that Tony didn't want to take, but Cap insisted.  Finally he flopped back into the pilot's seat, wiping his brow.  His skin was itching again, and though the pills helped (not that he'd admit that to Cap), it didn't dull everything completely.
"It is now," Cap said.  So much for trying to pry any personal information out of him, Tony thought.  Cap, meanwhile, drummed his fingers idly against the table before continuing, "Can you show me the fragment we already have?"
"Don't," Stark whispered, and Steve glared at him, somehow knowing the words that would come out next.  "Don't be like this.  You don't understand."
For a few seconds, they just stared at each other, Tony feeling like his heart was pumping almost uncomfortably loud in the silence.  Captain America… the hero, the legend… had just revealed himself to him.
, Steve had written, which made the knot of tension within Tony relax a little.  It didn't sound like combat at all.
“Stubborn,” Rogers murmured, but he kept on working on him in silence, bringing out a roll of gauze after a while and beginning to tape it over the gashes.  “Almost done.  How are you feeling now?”
.  But now he can remember all the times he’s been burned before, and maybe… maybe it’s not such a surprise that he’s been burned again.
"Oh my God," he said as his eyes popped open, and he scrambled back, nearly dropping his coffee.  There was another guy standing next to his bed, probably the same age as him but bigger. His blond hair was messy in a way that seemed almost intentional, and he was looking at Steve with a gleam in his eye that Steve wasn't entirely sure he liked.  "Who are you?!"
There was again a pause.  Steve remained silent this time, watching as Tony took a few deep breaths, clearly composing himself.  When he next spoke, his voice was rough and broken.  "We saw a herd coming," he said.  ”We were in the middle of nowhere and we couldn't move because I was in the middle of repairing the suit and I couldn't risk abandoning it.  No cover.  No distractions.  Just us and hundreds of biters headed our way.  Even if we could have run I don't know how much it would have helped, because they might have boxed us in anyway.  I thought we were going to die."  Tony shivered, his fingers twitching.  "But Rhodey… he had an idea.  He said—he asked if I'd noticed how the biters never attacked each other.  We knew they were blind.  So he figured that the biter smell had something to do with it, and if we covered ourselves in it, we'd be safe.  I thought it was a good idea.  Hell, it
“Yeah.  Come here.”  While Tony is still moving in him, Steve loosely wraps his arms around the other man’s shoulders, pulling him close and kissing his nose, then his lips.  Tony groans and shifts the angle, eliciting a gasp from Steve.  “God,” he manages against his mouth.  “T-that’s perfect, don’t stop.”
In that instant, he knows the man is right.  He can’t let go, not now.  Not… not when there’s someone so—so
They weren't.  Hours passed, and Tony could feel his clothes soaking through with sweat as he moved around in the heat.  They'd already had to regroup more than once in order to remain in sight of each other, and morale was slowly sinking.  By nightfall, nothing had changed, and they set up camp near the remains of what seemed like the main palace as they attempted to put the day's woes out of mind.  Archeology was a slow process, Tony told himself as he laid on top of his sleeping bag that night, wishing it were cooler.  Just because they hadn't found what they were looking for didn't mean it wasn't there.
Eyes widening, Tony reached up, placing his hand over his chest.  “You—you had no right!” he said.  “This is private!”
In the end, tonight’s just like any other night—dinner with other people who have means and wealth, flanked on one side by a fiancée he doesn’t love and on the other by a father he doesn’t know how to ignore.  And maybe in the end, that’s exactly what’s led Tony Stark to the back of the ship this evening, stomach full of whisky, lungs full of bitterly cold air.  Tonight is the same as last night, which was the same as the night before and will be the same as the night tomorrow.  Sure, the place might change—one night they might be in Europe, another night in America.  Or maybe, like tonight, they’ll be in the middle of the Atlantic, sailing on the biggest damn ship ever made.  The ship of dreams, people had called it.
It took two more hours, at which point Tony could tell they were nearly on the outskirts of the city, but finally Cap slowed down, walking around in a circle before turning to face them.  "This is the place," he said.
Bucky didn't answer.  That was okay.  Steve approached him, ignoring the sound of pounding at the door.  He couldn't believe what he was seeing.  Bucky was here, not dead across the Atlantic.  Just to reassure himself that this was real, he closed the distance between them, embracing him tightly.  Bucky was bigger now—still not his height, but closer now than before.  God, Steve had missed him, and to find a piece of his past here again meant more to him than he could have ever known.
"Sure," Cap said.  Despite the rough landing incoming, he had a glint in his eyes that Tony recognized from their earlier conversations—the man was starstruck, apparently, and it was adorable.  "How does it work?"
Steve took that as his cue to step away, wanting to give them some space.  "We'll be close by," he said—not that he was even sure they heard him, but he nonetheless motioned for Tony to follow him.  He spotted the shelter that Luke and Jessica had been using and decided to pick another location that was far enough to give them some privacy.  Sitting down at long last was a relief—he might have been a super soldier, but Jesus, it was nice to finally get some rest.
With a soft grunt, Steve makes it on, and Tony lets out a sigh of relief, breath clouding the air in front of him.  Alright, he thinks.  Steve is out of the water, and that’s the most important thing.  He’s going to be safe.
It was empty.  He moved on to the second one, then immediately backed away when he realized there was a family in there—one that long since couldn't be helped anymore.  Trying not to feel shaken, he stepped into the third room, again looking and listening.
Steve groaned, lashes fluttering open, and from the way he breathed in he could tell for sure that the vivid dream he'd been having was over.  In the dream, he'd been strong and fast and healthy. And now… now he was just Steve.
Tony brought out his map, consulting it for a moment before shaking his head.  "This is where we are," he said, pointing out a spot to Steve.  "We're pretty close to the Housatonic River.  The only place to cross is the Merritt Parkway—which is where they're coming from—unless you want to make a four-mile detour to Route 1 further south, which may or may not have the same issue with biter herds.  And don't suggest trying to cross the river ourselves.  I'm not doing that again."
Tony rolled back into his sleeping bag then, letting his eyes shut again.  “Good night, Steve,” he murmured.  His mind drifted, and he thought about the top of the mountain, encased in clouds.  They’d make it, he told himself.  They had to make it.  And then—well, Tony had to admit, he didn’t actually know what came next.  Maybe there was another gem he could wish on.  Or maybe it would happen on its own.  He’d figure it out.
"There was a man in a wheelchair," Tony said, staring up at the ceiling from the bed that Cap had dragged into the control room.  He couldn't leave—he needed to be around in case they hit turbulence and they needed manual steering—and so Cap had insisted on doing as much as he could to make Tony comfortable.  It was thoroughly unnecessary, but also sweet in its own way.  "Leaving the airship when it was on fire.  I didn't recognize him, but… he's involved.  I know he is."
" - But you made it through," Steve said, unaware of Tony's thoughts, "because you're stronger than you know even though I'm sure you don't believe it.  But I always will."
Tony and Birch both stared at him.  How could Cap know this?  Was there some kind of plan the others had that he hadn't been aware of?  He wanted it to be true, but—how?
“Yeah,” Steve agreed, and there was that little smile again.  What was going on?  Tony was confused.  Fine, yes, he’d thought Steve was an extraordinarily handsome man for some time, and then they’d become friends and things had happened.  But he wasn’t really sure what he himself wanted, much less what Steve did.  “I do like you, Tony.”
"There," Tony said, looking nauseated as he knelt in front of it, and then he reached down, pulling the slit he'd made open, and plunged his hands inside.
Tony followed his gaze.  It was coming from something situated in the water.  "Definitely not an oil platform," he said.
So much for ignoring them.  Tony motions for Steve to sit down, and Steve does so after lowering his hand, managing to look terrified and determined at the same time.  “What do you mean, what am I doing?” he asks casually.  “Dinner gets boring with just the three of us.  I thought he’d make for interesting company.”
Steve swallowed and thought about the people in his own life—or at least, the people who had once been in his life, and who were now trying to survive at best, mindless and blind at worst.  Peggy.  Dum Dum.  The Howling Commandoes.  He never thought it would come to this, but he was thankful now for Bucky falling off the train all those years ago.  It meant that Bucky's fate, at least, was certain.  Not like the others.  The idea of his friends lying dead on the ground, their insides flayed, made his stomach churn.  "Don't think about it," he said.  "It's not going to get you anywhere."
"Thanks," he said, letting out a soft sigh of relief as he spared another glance outside.  The ground was getting closer as the airship lost altitude, and he knew that all he could do was to minimize the impact landing would have on both the airship and the people inside.  "Get ready to hit the ground.  We have about a minute."
Steve blinked.  The word was unfamiliar to him, but Tony jumped to his feet so fast that Steve had to rush to take the tray from his lap before their food spilled everywhere.  "How do you know about the Tveria?" Tony demanded.
"It's strange," he finished quietly, "because I just said all those words and yet I know that none of them can ever really convey the depth of my feelings."
Tony took a deep breath, looking as though he wanted to say something more, but then he relented and went silent.  Together, they went down the stairs and through the exit, stepping back out onto the street.  The city was quiet around them, and Steve was relieved to see that all the noise they'd been making hadn't drawn any other biters out.  "All clear," Tony said.  "Let's go."
Steve lay down on the bed and stared blankly at the ceiling, trying not to think about the woman's brains splattered all over the snow.  It was going to be a long, long night.
The people were the 95th Infantry Division.  The place was Liepzig, Germany. The time was April 23, 1945.
Tony forced himself to stop looking around everywhere.  It was hard, though, considering he was literally sitting in an operating World-War-II-era plane.  Switching with Steve had shown him a lot of things, but until Tony had realized Steve was actually going to become Captain America, he'd never expected anything like
No, he told himself.  Not now; he didn't have the time, because he had a class to get to.  While Dad wouldn't care, Mom would be so disappointed if she learned that he was being truant.  And he never wanted to disappoint her.
He looks back at the lifeboat, and then he looks at the ring, the sapphire shining in the starlight, and from there he thinks back to holding out his hand to Steve, asking him to put on the other ring.
Then he leaves, and Tony is left there alone among the scattered silverware and broken dishes, shivering in the morning sunlight.  The guilt thing isn’t going to work, he tells himself again.  Doesn’t matter if it’s his father or not.  It’s not going to work.
Steve smiles then, and they close the small distance between them, holding each other like their lives depend on it.
Was that how she saw it?  Tony felt like Steve was just throwing away every chance at a relationship that Tony was giving him, but maybe she had a point.  Still - "I think at this rate, I'll probably never find someone." That was a concerning possibility to Tony. Steve was a nice guy.  He should have a girlfriend. A boyfriend would be fine too, but Tony doubted Steve swung that way.
"We're not really here to talk about me."  Cap got out of the chair and approached Tony, frowning slightly.  "Bandage is bleeding through.  Time to change it."
He let his eyes shut all the way.  He suddenly felt very tired.  "This is my fault," he said.  "I've left you alone again."
, but Rhodey had knocked Cap to the ground, and the thing sailed harmlessly over their heads before hitting the other wall.
The first thing he did was to pour himself a glass of water, downing it in one go.  His mouth still felt dry afterward, but at least it helped a little. And then, since he figured he probably wasn't going back to bed, he decided to try and freshen up some, heading over to the bathroom and brushing his teeth before staring at his hair in the mirror.  It looked like a mess. Automatically - because he'd done this so many times by now - he reached down for the comb so he could make it less unruly, then squeezed a bit of hair gel into his hands and ran it through his hair. The concept of hair gel was still foreign to Steve - Tony had very nice hair already, why make it so stiff with this so-called gel?  But that was how he wore his hair, so Steve just had to go along with it.
“Don’t worry about it,” she purrs, slipping the ring onto his finger before he can object and looking at their reflections in the mirror.  “We’re brilliant, you and I.  Together, we can become the most powerful two people in America.  We can change the world.”
"Yeah," the shape whispered.  Now that Tony's eyes were adjusting, he could make out the familiar little wings on Cap's cowl.  "Sorry.  I didn't mean to startle you."
Tony beams, clapping him on the shoulder.  “It’s settled, then.  Father can escort Sunset, and I’ll meet you on the Grand Staircase tomorrow evening.  I’ll see you then, Steve.”  Before he can forget, he sheds Steve’s jacket, handing it back to him.  “And… thanks.  For everything.”
rambling on about.  And that… that was a new feeling.  Someone listening to him talk because they knew it made him happy.
He gazed up into the sky, searching for the sun, but it was somewhere behind the trees.  From the looks of it, though, it was nearly dusk.  If they’d interpreted those cave drawings right, then they still had two more sunsets… forty-eight hours.
Pepper leaned over to gape at it.  "So if you're right, and it's trying to connect with a nearby piece, then we should be heading in the direction the edges point in…?"
"Thank you," Natasha whispered.  "You should finish eating first.  When you leave… go through the southwest entrance.  There are no traps there."
Still musing over everything, he rolled out of bed, pulled on his clothes, and plodded over to the kitchen.  Ma was already sitting back down at her sewing machine, working. Still, she spared him a smile, albeit one that was a bit tighter than usual, when he entered.  Not wanting to disturb her, Steve wolfed down his breakfast - rice with milk and sugar - and tried not to think too wistfully about the imaginary bacon and sausage he'd had in his dream.  He washed his bowl when he was done, then picked up his bag and lunch bucket (a peek inside told him that Ma had packed him a mayo sandwich today). "I'll see you later, Ma. Love you," he told her, and for some reason she seemed to relax, giving him a smile broader than the last one as he left.
Oh, well, coffee.  That was worth getting up for.  Tony pushed himself up and made grabby hands for it, smiling blearily at his benefactor - Ty, of course, who else would it be - before drinking it all in one go.  "Thanks," he managed afterward.
Tony nodded and waved as he stood up to leave, already distracted from the conversation at hand; the stranger's handwriting was burned into his brain and he couldn't focus on anything else.  He didn't know the details yet, but it was clear that
He can hear Steve wandering around the room, no doubt looking at everything curiously.  He wonders if Steve’s quarters are anything like this.  Probably not.  “This is really nice,” Steve says.
that Tony honestly thinks he’ll follow him in when he falls.  That, he tells himself, is the only reason.  It has nothing to do with the fact that this stranger is the first person who’s ever shown any sort of concern for him since his mother died.  “You’re… ridiculously stubborn, aren’t you?”
.”  With that, Tony pulls back, but only for a moment before he’s leaning forward again, taking his cock between his lips, and dear lord his mouth is warm and wet and perfect.  Hesitantly, Steve reaches up, slipping his fingers into Tony’s hair—while he likes that sort of thing, not everyone he’s slept with has welcomed this kind of contact—but Tony makes a slurping sound Steve can only describe as
, he scribbled on each one, on the front and on the back, on the top and in the middle and on the bottom.  When he was done, he tossed all the papers onto the floor, staring down at them after.
at the bottom of the letter, just because they were ghosts didn't mean they didn't matter anymore.  They were the people who'd raised Steve, and so they were important.
The man reaches out, and the next thing Tony knows, another hand is covering his own.  It’s so warm.  “You’re not going to let go,” he says very softly.
, haven't you?"  It was the only thing that made sense—and if it was true, which Tony was pretty sure it was, it explained a lot of other things.  Like why the hell Cap had even wanted to come along on this mission in the first place.
Ty rolled his eyes, which just irritated Tony even more, though he tried to control himself.  Getting into a fight probably wouldn't be very productive, seeing as Ty was never going to change.  "Okay, you don't want to talk about it. Let's just get food."
Cap shook his head.  "You didn't see enough," he said, his voice level even as they heard more commotion from above.  His hand wasn't raised, but Tony could see it at his side, clenched.  It seemed like the ring was—well—
Rogers followed him, squinting at the rock.  After a moment, it was clear he was seeing what Tony was, because he asked, “Is this writing?”
The sabretooth stopped—along with Tony’s heart—then slowly turned, looking right at him.  His heart started beating normally again once he saw that yes, this
Steve considered telling Stark that they shouldn't have, that it was wasteful, even if he was admittedly grateful that he'd been found since he was alive after all.  But Stark wasn't done yet, so Steve held back, prodding him to continue instead.  "Then?"
After what seems like an extraordinarily long kiss, Tony pulls away, looking smug as he gazes down at him, panting.  “Enough?” he asks.  “Or do you need another moment?”
"There's no need for that," Tony replied, relaxing now that Cap had finished up with his arm.  "I mean, to be clear, what you said borders on the ridiculous.  But…"  His gaze drifted, and though his arm was still throbbing, he smiled up at the ceiling of the airship.  "It was certainly nice."
Tony woke up, and then he rolled onto his front and wept into his pillow, because he knew that if he was alive, then Steve was dead.
“Get your head out of the gutter,” Tony replies with a snicker.  “I’d love to stay naked with you, but it’s best that we get out of here before they’re done eating and gossiping.  I’ll be back in a moment.  Put this back in the safe for me, will you?”
Steve thought about Peter and Carol and the things Jessica had had to do.  He thought… maybe he could understand it now, her decision to do what she'd done.  But he prayed to God that such a choice would never be forced onto him.  "Go on," he urged.
Steve pushed himself back up, then pulled the shovel out and tossed it at Tony.  He missed.  "I want answers," he replied, picking up Bucky's body and hefting it over his shoulder in a fireman's carry.  "But I don't think I'll get them.  So at the very least we need to get your blueprints back.  Natasha will want proof."
He wanted to ask where they were right now or what had happened to Pepper and Rhodey and Jarvis or why Cap was holding his hand.  When he opened his mouth, though, the only thing that came out was a ragged: "What?"
The next thing he knows, his hands are being gently pulled away from the rail, and the only thing keeping Tony from tumbling over is Steve.  Tony’s terrified and exhilarated at the same time—here he is, one misstep away from certain death, and yet he trusts Steve so goddamn much that he’s willing to allow himself to be in such a dangerous position, and not even on his own terms.  He can feel Steve extending their arms to their sides, hands still entwined, the other man’s breath hot against his neck and the wind cool against his face.  What on earth is he doing?
Tony stared down at the folder.  "I hope so," he said. He wondered if maybe Bucky was right - if maybe this mission was as simple as it seemed.  What if Tony's very presence had changed this timeline enough such that Steve was no longer fated to die today? What if his actions had somehow resulted in him being handled this mission, instead of some more difficult one that would have led to their deaths?  Maybe - just maybe - things would be okay.
no problem," Tony insisted, but he ended up continuing anyway, "I just—you remember how I told you a long time ago, why I went on all those adventures in the thirties?"
Tony just sighs, picking up his cup of coffee and gulping it down before refilling it.  It’s way too early for an argument, and he has an awful hangover.  “Maybe I was in the bathroom.”
Rogers awkwardly brought one paw up, thumping at Tony’s back, causing him to blanch and pull away.  “I appreciate the gesture,” he told him quickly.  “But super soldier strength and sabretooth paws aren’t a good combination.”  Rogers just sighed and stood up, looking around, Tony looking with him.  He lifted one hand and pointed at a mountain peak, the highest of any of the nearby ones.  “That’s got to be it,” he said.  “What do you think, Rogers?”
So Steve stayed quiet, listening to Stark speak.  He told Steve about the beginning, when news reports about how the homeless dying from exposure seemed to recover and attack pedestrians started to come out at the turn of the decade.  He told Steve about the middle, when those people who had been attacked seemed to turn on everyone else, and riots swept across the nation.  And he told Steve about the end, when civilization as they'd remembered it collapsed, when the ones who'd managed to stay sane went into hiding from the ones who hadn't.  Apparently, the virus, bacteria, whatever the hell it was—it changed people who were hanging on to their last threads of life.  It took away their minds, leaving behind only some sort of primal urge to feed.  It wasn't the bite that drove them mad—the bite only accelerated their death.  The potential for madness was already there, and
He received another shrug in reply, so he threw his hands up, then laid back to stare at the clouds.  “You’re given a chance to answer the deepest questions about the feline psyche, and all you do is shrug.  This is a travesty.”
His ruminations were cut short when he became aware that there were other people in the room, conversing loudly enough for him to hear.  If they were aware of his presence, they made no mention of it.  It seemed unlikely that they
"Is this a trap?" Tony asked in return.  He carefully sat up, maneuvering his injured arm down to his side.  "I say yes, you say 'aha' and claim it's proof that I'm not fit to come?"
Tony smiled brightly again and went back to work.  Steve watched him for a moment, glad to see him back in his element, and then he got off the train, heading into the tunnel.  He'd have checked it out without Tony's prompting, anyway—if this train was functional, it should have gone somewhere, and now Steve was wondering if there was some reason it was still parked here after all this time.
As if on cue, Jan and Hank emerge from the quinjet and are joined shortly by Namor, who pulls Steve’s coffin into the water.  If any of them notice the redness of Tony’s eyes or the wetness on his cheeks, they don’t say anything about it.  “As long as I rule these oceans, Steve Rogers’ rest will go undisturbed,” Namor promises, and both he and the coffin vanish from the surface.
“Fine.  Full disclosure.  I was thinking about my metal plate when I reached out to touch the gem.  I also
After a moment of deliberation, he decided to head north, toward the mountain.  If he was lucky, that was the direction Steve was heading in.  If he was unlucky, then he was pretty screwed.
Tony looked around.  Himself, Jarvis, Rhodey, Pepper.  They were all here.  He had a feeling he wasn't going to like where this was going.  "No, we're not," he said in an attempt to stave off the inevitable.
Steve complied quickly, finding a large tree that people might have once picnicked at in better times and setting Tony down at the base of it.  "What is it?"
The sabretooth nodded quickly.  Breath hitching, Tony stepped forward and shone his flashlight at it—sure enough, those blue eyes were the same as Rogers’, even if they looked more panicked than normal.  As for the rest of him… well.  There wasn’t much of Rogers there, unless he counted the golden fur or the fact that even with the short legs sabretooths apparently had, there was something about his build, massive though it was, that exuded grace and power.  Okay, so maybe there was more of Rogers here than he’d thought—shame his patriotism hadn’t carried through, though, because no doubt Tony would have laughed himself into a coma if Rogers had had a star marking on his ass.  Still…  “I don’t understand,” he said again.  “How did this happen?”
Tony does, though his definition of giving Steve a moment apparently involves leaning down and kissing him deeply—though Steve hardly minds.  He kisses him back, tongue sliding into his mouth as his hands tangle themselves in the other man’s hair, loving the sounds he’s making—quiet, passionate, deep.  Was he like this with Sunset?  Maybe.  But he forces himself to push it out of mind.  Sunset doesn’t matter, after all.  Only the two of them, right here, right now, do.
for this, he can’t help but feel, well, empty.  But then the bottle of lotion is pressed into his hands, and he remembers something much better is going to replace it soon.  Without needing Tony to tell him what to do—the fact that Tony’s cock is right in front of him, hard and thick and shining with wetness is instruction enough—he squeezes some of the lotion into his hands, warming it for a moment before reaching forward, coating it well.
Steve didn't know how they'd gotten to a point where an entire city had to be burned to the ground, nor did he want to know.  Since the train was bound for Philadelphia, they jumped off before they could get there and started walking.  Any worries about having to continue on foot for some time dissipated when Steve found a pair of bicycles in a suburb they were passing through, and after Tony fixed them up, they were able to begin riding south.
He thinks back to last night, back to the woman who had come for Tony.  “Your fiancée,” he says.  “She doesn’t know what happened?”
Tony seems intent on making this as difficult for Steve as possible, though, because he stretches like a cat as he settles down, gaze still fixed on him.  He can probably tell when Steve’s eyes drift toward… other parts of his anatomy.  Oh, goodness.  “How’s this?”
Steve blinked, thinking about the woman, then looking Stark over.  Something had clearly been wrong with the woman, but Stark looked fine, if tired, which flew in the face of his claim that "everyone" was infected.  Stark must have realized what he was thinking, because he let out another laugh—this one just as bitter as the last—and nodded.  "Yes, I'm infected.  And you probably are too by now.  And I'm telling you this because I—I learned it the hard way.  Let me backtrack again."
She raised an eyebrow at him, looking as though she couldn't tell if Tony was being sarcastic or not.  Tony couldn't blame her, given the way Steve acted normally, but he was being a hundred percent honest right now.  "That so," she said. She turned away to cough, and Tony felt a strange pang in his chest, like it was hurting him to see her in pain like this.  It - it was probably just Steve's feelings carried over somehow, not his own. "Then tell me, what
"You killed her," he said to the sound of footsteps rapidly approaching him, still staring disbelievingly at the corpse lying on top of him.  "She was unarmed, and you killed her."
Though Tony can feel his eyes getting wet, he reaches out to touch Steve’s arm, trying to remember the last time he’d done this.  It feels like a lifetime ago that the two of them had been so happy and content, ready to take whatever the world was going to throw at them.  And the truth remains that no matter how agonizingly stubborn Steve was, no matter how often he’d refused to reconsider his position… Tony never wanted this.  He’d wanted anything,
"Fuck," Tony said, following his gaze, his eyes wide.  He turned away briefly to take care of the biters, then looked back at Steve's leg.  "That looks bad."
So passed the rest of the day.  If Steve was being honest with himself, what he was really doing was passing the time until Tony's parents returned, to see for himself who they were and what Tony had grown up with.  Lunch and dinner went by, and while Jarvis served both to him, he ate alone.
“Yeah, and I got what I wanted.”  His gaze flickers up and he grins again, leaning down to kiss Steve on the lips.  “Now I want more.”
have been him who ended it, but the thought of taking Peggy's or Dum Dum's or any other of his friends' lives still made his blood run cold.
.  Well, fine.  Tony could deal with it.  He nudged it toward the wall with his foot, straightening.  “We don’t need that bowl anymore, anyway.”  He received another eye roll for his efforts, but he ignored it, instead securing everything against Rogers’ back again.  “Alright.  Ready to go?”  Rogers nodded, so Tony climbed on, clutching at his fur and leaning in close as they took off.
“So here we are,” he said, looking around.  Foliage as far as the eye could see, though there were some mountains in the distance, and a river cutting its way through the terrain a few miles away.  If he looked carefully, he was pretty sure he could make out the dinosaurs Rogers had apparently read about in the briefing.  God.  He couldn’t believe it.
Speaking of which - if they continued this whole switching thing, then at some point - and probably some point soon - Steve was actually going to meet his old man, and Tony didn't know what would happen.  Summer vacation was rapidly approaching, and though Tony fully expected both his parents to be out most of the time, they'd probably have to see each other at least once. Maybe twice. Or, God forbid,
Steve shrugged, licking his lips.  Apparently, he didn’t care as long as he got some deer meat in his stomach.
This was nonsense and Tony disagreed with everything that was happening right now.  "So then what?" he challenged.  "You all are just gonna land, get off, and hope for the best?"
But he can’t let that deter him.  The water might be bad, but there’s something that would be even worse, and that’s Steve drowning to death while handcuffed to a damned pole.  Yeah, there’s no way in hell Tony’s going to let that happen.
Jessica trailed off, and Luke picked up the thread.  "What Jess is too polite to say is that Burnside is fucking crazy," he said, jabbing the air with a finger.  "He calls himself the Grand Director and he won't shut up about the 'terrors' of communism.  Communism!  Like any of us give a shit about that when government doesn't exist anymore."
Forget saving them for the person his words are for.  Ignoring them altogether—that’s the way to go.  Isn’t that, after all, what he’d decided on so long ago when he’d been burned as a teenager?
“Pathetic,” his father breathes, turning away.  “You could have been my greatest creation.”  He heads for the door, pausing there for a moment.  “You still can be.”
"I was gullible at first," Tony admitted.  "Back when I thought there was still an easy way to undo all this.  Five years later, humanity's on the ropes, and I don't fall for their doe eyes anymore."
Ma smiled indulgently at him.  "You're at an age where these things happen, Stevie," she said.  "As your mother, I want to be here for it."
They’re discussing the merger again.  Sunset has pages and pages of legal documents signed by herself and Tony’s father strewn about, though Howard has his own pile to match.  They both look absurdly pleased.  Then again, Tony supposes it’s not so strange after all.  They both stand to gain quite a bit once their companies become one… and yet, he finds it really hard to give a damn.  He can’t stop thinking about Steve.  Beautiful, hopeful Steve, who had looked so terribly stricken when Tony had rebuffed him.
Rogers seemed to raise one eyebrow at him—how he could still do that, Tony didn’t know—and Tony sighed, running a hand through his hair.  He was many things, but dishonest wasn’t one of them.
Twelve years since he and Steve had sat here in this poppy field, the flowers a brilliant orange in the fading sunlight as Tony held his hand and bit back the words on his tongue.
Nearly the whole summer had passed, and up until now, Steve had managed to have very limited contact with him.  It hadn't been on purpose - true to Tony's word, his Pa just wasn't at home much, and on the rare occasion he was, the house was big enough that they didn't really cross paths all that often.  Steve couldn't help but privately feel that it was a little sad, for Tony's own Pa to not seem to care that much about checking in on him. At least his Ma made an effort to talk to him, even though she was home as rarely as Tony's Pa.
"Luke," said the man, who lowered his arms and walked toward them, one hand extended.  Steve clasped it and gave it a firm shake.  The man—Luke—seemed to hesitate afterward, but eventually offered his hand to Stark, who raised an eyebrow but accepted it.  "And this is my family."
"Of course, sunshine boy," she said.  Her gaze fell onto the needle and cloth he was holding.  "You should really be doing that in the kitchen, though. Away from here."
Tony can’t help but think, though he doesn’t voice the thought out loud.  Not yet, anyway.  “I was never
Steve managed a weak chuckle at that, accepting the shield with a soft thanks as he and Tony both got up.  "Let's get the hell out of here," he said.
He'd just entered a park, green and quiet and so unlike the world they'd stepped out of when Tony shifted in his arms, lifting his head.  "Hey," he said.  "Can we stop?"
"No, uh, I took care of that," Cap replied.  Tony wondered what that had entailed, but Cap didn't elaborate, so Tony didn't pry.  "I have medicine for you, too.  So we can go."
He threw his shield again to knock away the biters surrounding Tony, using his legs to disable the ones that were closest to him instead.  Then the woman screamed again, and Steve turned to find that one biter had broken a window and was crawling inside, hands reaching—he pulled it out and threw it as hard as he could against a nearby building, the crack it made on contact audible even in the heat of battle.
Slowly, Tony’s gaze drifts upward, and he takes a few more shuddering breaths before meeting his eyes.  “I’ll be fine,” he whispers.  He moves toward the door, but this time Steve holds still, making no move to stop him.  “I’ll be fine.  And—and if you ever come to me again, I swear to God I’ll have you arrested.”  With that, he vanishes, and Steve is left alone again, the room silent around him.
"Polio," Steve replied dumbly.  He knew it shouldn't be, but the idea felt bizarre.  In their world, everyone was now infected with this… biter disease.  Virus.  Whatever it was.  But people could still catch polio.
“Tony,” Steve says, voice managing to be hard even in the freezing cold.  “Either you get on, or I’ll get off again.  Your choice.”  And he holds out his hands.
Jessica struggled for a moment longer and then finally went limp, taking a deep, shuddering breath before nodding.  "Fine," she said, and Steve pulled back, Stark following his example.
He turned to see where the planes were but was immediately distracted when he noticed Cap was lagging behind them, despite the fact that he should have been the fastest of them all.  "Cap?" he shouted, confused.
Twenty minutes after that, he was crouching at the edge of a clearing, watching as a sabretooth ambled across it, away from him.  Was it Steve?  It was hard to tell, and Tony realized with a sinking feeling that he wasn’t sure if Steve had any unusual markings.  So what now?  If he just called out Steve’s name and attracted the sabretooth’s attention and then it wasn’t Steve, he’d be in trouble.
seemed like ages ago, but after putting some thought into it, Tony realized it was only two or so nights back.  Strange how time worked.  In any case, sure, he'd lit his customary candle for Virgil, and he'd told him a little about what they were going to do, but… something seemed off.  Cap sounded as though he knew of Virgil's significance, which certainly wasn't something Tony would have waxed on about during his talk.
Half an hour later, he came across some footprints that looked like they were recently made by a large, Steve-as-a-sabretooth-shaped animal.  Tony leaned down to inspect them, not sure how to feel.  Either this was a good thing because it meant he was on Steve’s tail, or it was a very bad thing because there was another sabretooth wandering around.  But even if it was the latter, well, what the hell could he do?  He had to find out.  So he kept on moving forward, praying that the tracks belonged to Steve and not some other thing that would only be too happy to eat him.
"If they catch us here they're gonna shoot us down," Rhodey said, having turned toward them once they'd come up the stairs.
There was a flurry of protests around the room, but Bucky - Barnes? - just nodded and headed through the door, so Tony followed suit.  "Meet you outside in ten minutes," Bucky said before dashing off, presumably to wherever he was staying. Still a little dazed at how fast everything was moving, Tony just watched him go before remembering himself and going back to the room he'd woken up in this morning.
Tony made himself breathe in, breathe out, trying to control the terror he was suddenly feeling.  It - it didn't have to mean anything bad, he told himself. There were plenty of desk jobs and administrative positions.  Just because someone was giving him a chance, just because the people on his delivery route told him good luck… that didn't mean he was literally going to go marching into battle.
It doesn’t matter, anyway.  Nothing matters.  Just a few more minutes, and he won’t ever have to worry about anything ever again.
Sunset carefully sets her own cup of coffee down, then stands up.  “I’m disappointed,” she says.  “We are to be
Stark moved closer, letting out a low whistle.  "That's hydraulic cement," he said, glancing over at the next window as well.  "Christ.  Someone went and sealed all the exits."
, specifically, to cry.  He just… hadn't expected such an outpouring of emotion from Steve.  And he hadn't expected to be told that Steve thought of him as a friend.  It was a lot to take in.
Tony was almost tempted to say yes, but not for the right reasons.  He was still trying to figure out how he felt about the other man.  He enjoyed being in Cap's presence, but he didn't know what to make of Cap's evident connection to the relics they were currently hunting down.  Still, Cap was selfless and caring and supportive and all the things Tony wasn't.  And—he made Tony feel safe, what with the life-saving and the bandage-changing.  Which was
