“We suck at this,” he asserts, sounding both amused and incredulous at the same time.
“Eh, semantics.”
“Please sleep now, Sir.  In the meantime, I will compile a list of appropriate courtship activities.”
They eat in silence for another moment until Steve feels compelled to speak up.
Tall, blonde, and handsome is the closest thing to a walking Disney prince that he’s ever seen.  Despite his frankly atrocious wardrobe choices – seriously, who wears Dockers on purpose – there’s no hiding that jawline or those fabulous baby blues.  The last time he’d felt this sort of instant pull was in 1981, when his rampant fascination with Harrison Ford running from boulders and punching Nazis clued him into the fact that he was probably sort of attracted to men too.
From: Potts, Pepper
, he thinks to himself,
“I’m well aware of what Loki did,” Steve replies, back ramrod straight, “but that just makes the Helicarrier construction all that much more important.  What exactly would have happened if SHIELD hadn’t been there to assist?”
“You’re welcome.”
“Both Mr. Stark and Iron Man are both physically sound.”
Steve immediately raises his fist in front of him in a basic boxer’s guard, but Natasha doesn’t move to engage.  Instead, she takes a step back and tilts her head.
Excluding Clint, of course.  The moment before the ball hits the target, an arrow whizzes by and strikes it dead center.  The ensuing momentum propels the ball into the center of the bullseye, where it’s firmly pinned with a soft
.  The glass, previously transparent, darkens, and Steve can no longer see the man inside.  So that’s how Stark wants to play it.  Well, two can play that game.  Steve unlocks his knees and braces himself for a long night.  The man has to come out sometime, and Steve will be right there waiting for him when he does.
Steve winces slightly and was about to pull away when he suddenly feels the gentle hand on the back of his neck and he relaxed into the soft kiss.
"I'm sorry to interrupt the moment- but Id likes to take Tony to the medical wing.
"Fuckkk, Steve your tongues so amazing- so good, oh god,"
Tony's lips curved into a smile as he turned to his son. "Papa's coming home early! I just got a message,"
"Tony?"
Tony came back over as he heard Morgan say "I love you papa- and daddy too!" She squealed as tony scared her with a small boo and he chuckled turning to Steve. "Also Nat texted, she said she need you at the compound "
"Oh Oh, Can we go to McDonald's?" Peter asked excitedly, bouncing on his heels. "Please with a cherry on top daddy?"
Steve smiles and looks over at Tony. "I love you guys..." He whispers.
"What?" he heard Kamala come up behind him to look over his shoulder, he's starting to like this kid.
"There's my little champ!"
Steve smiles and makes himself a glass of scotch. "How're you feeling?"
He winks before heading off. He grabbed a suitcase just laying around and used the glasses he had on to scan for the item. He found it and used his armor hand to laser through and put it away in the case and started to head off but a voice stopped him as he tried turning the other way
"No no you need your rest dol-," the nickname spilled as he forces Tony back down. He was surprised when Tony put one of his hands on top of Steve's bigger ones. "I-am s-,"
In response, Steve gave him a little shrug, not seeming very bothered. “Which car?” He asked curiously- of course with their kind of money and Tony’s obsession with cars- they had plenty of options.
"We don't know," Steve stood a few feet away arms crossed. "He just opened a portal and walked through,"
"I-I-," Tony's voice spoke up as everyone looked towards him as he slowly started to back up towards the door. "I-I'm sorry I need to go excuse m-me," he turned around and ran out of there, ignoring his name being called, especially the fight that was going to break out.
Mouths clashing together, lips sliding into place when they met like it was meant to be, Steve's tongue sliding into home, exploring around the wet cavern while his hand slides up the brunette's leg up into his shirt his fingers ghosting over his sensitive nipples, he knew how he was when he messed with his buds, pushing his hips more against Tony's, love to hear his little whines and moans.
He smiled softly leaning in his touch. "I have an even better solution," he pulled him up and to the living room of course with a bottle of scotch plopping on the couch and told Friday to play videos from the peters folder.
He swiped his face with a wet towel having the faucet run as he looked up into the small mirror with a slight smile.
--------------------------------------------------------
"No can do, I have another call in- Fury wants me back in before midnight and I'd barely get a nap in," he replied honestly.
He leaned forward a little so his bruising face was in view of the camera.
"Sorry- am I interrupting?" Steve asked in a low tone hoping to not wake him up.
"I think I figured out where Monica's lab is- listen," Kamala clicked on the play.
" they said babies born before 37 weeks are premature, I'm surprised he was a crier," the videos kept playing to just cute little videos of baby peter, tony making small comments.
"Okay," Rhodes grabbed onto him. "Tones you made your point, just sit down okay?"
"Whoa, holier than though," Nat turned to him pointing an accusatory finger angrily. "Where were you when the world went to shit?!"
The interrogation continued, Tony guessed he was finally getting his pent of feelings out by asking his personal questions- Bruce probably felt used in their relationship- he felt... pity towards his science bro.
"No... this can't be right...," Kamala muttered.
Steve smiles and hugs him tightly. "You're very welcome, bud." He then hands him his gift.
"You look tired doll...  you should go to bed," He spoke in a concerned tone.
"Please know.., when I drift off and be like everything lately- I'm fine... I'm totally fine... I dream about you.. because it's always you..," before the recording shut off.
Steve got up to walk after him but didn't enter the medical room Tony was in. He couldn't get himself to go in there. He just stood outside, looking into the glass room where his lover laid asleep and pale and sick. He unconsciously hung his head, upset with himself about how he left his lover. God... why did he even think leaving Tony was a good idea?
Steve frowns as he walks over. "You don't know that until we try." He says softly. "It's worth a shot if there's a possibility of getting them back."
Peter gasped bouncing up and down in his seat. “Yes! I wanna make robots with daddy!”
He looks down at his hands. "I can't-I just can't Tony..." He sighs. "Something tells me that this isn't right..."
"Well i think she wanted an excuse to have a juice pop," he wrapped his arms around his husband’s neck. "Or wanted to see why daddy was cursing,”
He nodded. "Yeah, he was a good man wasn’t he?"
Tony jumped a little blushing setting the picture down that he was holding where it sat before. "Hey you Dorito," he joked lightly
Steve gets undressed and walks to the bathroom and turns on the hot water in the shower.
Steve chuckles and kisses his temple. "Never. You're a cutie."
"I-i don’t k-know if ill be the same-," he whimpered eyes clenched shut.
Tony smiled at him squeezing his hand, bouncing the little toddler lightly. "Baby steps are the most important thing to remember, don’t rush it, i learned that the hard way, but it leads me 5 years later in a happy marriage.. and a little girl, i may never forget what happened on the planet where i lost that someone but it made me realize that i had to find a purpose," he said softly
He sees him and pouts. "I'm only joking- i swear id never do that!"
Gender: Male
Luckily at the time, Tony was just getting ingredients out so it didn't bug him as much. "Hey, bub? I'll play with you after breakfast alright? Big boys gotta eat to grow big and strong,"
"W-what am i gonna do?" He whimpered softly.
"Where is he now? Where?" He asked almost demandingly
He hands him a pair of sunglasses. "Just don’t look at people hun," he laughed softly as he walked him to the elevator
"Forgot you liked these type of showers,"
Steve nodded  “Of course, You and Peter go first though, make sure he doesn’t order the whole menu or something,” He spoke with a light laugh.
"And I needed you," Tony interrupted him with a glare tilting his head at him. "As in past tense that Trumps, what you need is too late honey," he cleared his throat. "Sorry,"
Steve looks down slightly and gently takes Tony's hand. "I made a huge mistake leaving for Bucky..." He sighs. "And I know you probably still hate me for it... That little speech you gave out there definitely made that clear... I just thought I'd tell you I'm sorry for what I put you through."
"Oh god, I hope so..,"
"What's up with him?"
Tony sat in his wheelchair, he has in one of his hand, an IV hooked up to his other arm as he listened on to the assassin, one eye peering at the now missing heroes, Captian Marvel- now known as Carol Danvers was looking at on another screen, her gaze froze on Nick Fury's picture, eyes slowly moving to the ground.
"Okay, okay," Steve cut him off taking a deep breath. "Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything,"
He pulled back just resting his forehead on Steves, lightly stroking the hairs on the back of his neck. "Fuck it's been forever,"
He shrugged slightly humming lightly as his hair was stroked. "Why do you think I have so many Marks?"
Tony paused turning back to Bruce. "Yeah- maybe sorta- we'll see," Before hopping down the rest of the way. He took another deep breath pulling out the chain under his shirt, fiddling with the ring that hung around his neck on that chain.
"Well, he's pissed," everyone's attention turned to the rodent, Rocket, who was sitting next to Nebula. "He thinks he failed- which of course he did but there's a lot of that going around ain't there,"
Tony shook his head in response, lightly huffing. “I just at least wanted to treat it for you-,” he said as he pulled him into the kitchen, bending down to pull out the first aid kit from under the sink as he questioned. “Didn’t you promise to come home early?”
He let her cry as he weakly hugged her, lightly shushing her to calm her down a little. "I-i lost the kid Pepper... i-i lost him," Tony said as if he was out of breath, the two stayed there hugging, Steve watching as the others went over to greet him, Bruce immediately pushing- well not pushing but urging Tony inside, Pepper being his support to get medical treatment- but when Tony looked up- his eyes locked with those gorgeous sea blue eyes- fuck he was falling in love all over again.
Tony finished up in the kitchen and living room before just grabbing a glass of scotch and perched himself on a stool, sipping on it
The boy perked up at hearing this. "Really?? Is he here yet?! He asked excitedly as he sat up.
A two and a half weeks had passed, It was slowly back to normal, mostly getting the situation under control, they had memorial stones for everyone who disappeared built in the center of new york. Steve started a little support group for the people suffering especially himself who didn't know how to grieve at the loss of his love and somewhat adopted a son. The three last avengers had recruited some new workers to help them out remake what was left of the new SHIELD with Natasha in charge of everything.
"What-," before he could question more, their positions were suddenly flipped ending up on his stomach and his sweatpants along with his boxers, supersoldier behind him feeling his hips being raised, leaving kisses down his spine until his face was face to face with his ass. His hands spreading apart his cheeks, feeling his breath against his ass. His tongue ran over his rim, kissing it as well, making him whine at the teasing.
He had Peter months later, 35 weeks, prematurely but he was perfect in his eyes. He grew up in the compound with the Avengers that were left, especially Natasha before she joined Steve sometime later then it was Rhodey and when T'challa visited from Wakanda, always brought small gifts, he loved playing with both of them, he'd call anyone who wasn't his dad in the compound his aunt or uncle. He spent a lot of his time in Tony's lab and being a normal kid, growing up never asking who his other dad was.
It starts with Steve running in out of breath while Tarleton is typing away at a screen while. "George, we have to shut down the reactor- it's pulling us towards that heat signature!"
"At once," The god bellowed, spinning his hammer and pushing himself into the air.
"Hey!" Tony exclaimed
Steve smiles brightly and hugs his son tightly. "I'm glad you like it bud. I figured it was something you could keep close so when I'm not around, you'll still have apart of me."
Tony rolled his eyes, lips curved into a smile as he never to Peter, unzipping the Captain America outfit. "Go get into some pajamas and get any stuffies you want and come back, okay?" Peter got up at this and immediately headed off to his nearby room giggly.
He laughs cutely. "I'm not surprised that you have videos." He happily curls up with Tony and watches them.
Having his repulsors up and ready to fire as he stood back and watched these panels open from this pod it looked like- he felt bad for whatever poor inhuman had been trapped there for this long. But whatever this was, it was going to put a stop to Monica's plans- to Tarleton's plans- to stop AIM at once.
“Of course,” Steve replied, taking the boy in his arms. He carried him over where he sat at a table with 4 chairs, sitting Peter across from him knowing he would want to sit next to Tony.
“Well, I kind of already asked you.  A while ago, actually.”
From: Potts, Pepper
“My brain is never diminished.  It’s beautiful.” And seriously,
Stepping inside his quarters, everything hit him at once it felt like someone just dropped buckets of boulders onto him. Their- no just his room now... it hadn't changed since the last time he saw it. The first thing he did was walk over to Steve's punchbag that sat on the floor- covered in dust with a few rips on it. He remembered when they first started sharing a room, Steve had asked to have one up here when he found out the Chimera wasn't going to have a gym like their tower. There would be times when Tony woke up during the night, he'd see the super-soldier up and just going away at the bag which always reminded him how lucky he was and always made him fall in love deeper than before.
Tony laughed softly as Morgan got down from his arms and ran at her papa excitedly. "I was about to call a search party," he joked greeting his husband
He did end up distracting himself for a while, he hadn’t looked up from his phone turned into a laptop, one of his hands fiddling with a necklace he always wore that carried two metal rings, his teeth biting his lips harshly he’s surprised he didn’t taste the metallic taste of blood. The many thoughts running through his head, he felt like he failed as a dad letting his son get badly hurt like this- the only time he’d look up is when people left the operating room hoping for some kind of update of his son- he was so immersed in his work and being worried that he didn’t hear the footsteps coming up from his left.
Tony nodded in response as he carefully got out of the car, with Peter still in his arms, and headed inside with Steve following behind him.
"Okay no no no," he ignored Rhodes telling him to sit down as he pointed towards Carol. "We need you, your new blood,"
The philanthropist lightly chuckled at the remark and began digging into his food with a hum, occasionally looking at the young boy making sure he didn’t choke on anything. He watched Peter eat his ice cream happily, even though he was going way too fast. He had ended up giving himself a brain freeze from the cause. “Owwie! Brain Freeze!” He spoke, moving one of his little hands to his head but once he did though, his hand sort of instinctively shot a web across his face while having this terrible brain freeze that he’s never had to experience, it was terrifying.
Steve sighs and smiles at his son. "Okay... Okay." He walks over and gently kisses his head. "Let me at least get a slice of cake first." He teases.
Another pause.
"W-will i be seeing you again?"
"D-does Dad not like you that much," Peter tilted his head a little confusedly.
"Well, you're sure acting like Steve!" He raises his voice. "Its either I or you’re on your own,"
Morgan made little grabby hands. "Papa," she said, clearly wasn’t paying attention to what was said.
He nods and opens his arms out to the boy. "Of course, Peter."
He kisses his head. "It's okay, baby. Don't apologize." He whispers. He looks over at Morgan and smiles softly. "Morgan got you a juice pop to help you feel better." He whispers.
He swiped with a face with a wet towel having the faucet run as he looked up into the small mirror with a slight smile.
"You.. got a suit?" Bruce asked in confusion with a hint of shock.
"Nothing's changed- not even your clothes still on the floor,"
Tony walked off to the kitchen as Peter cuddled into Steve.
He shrugged a little. "It been too long, i probably was just really stressed after all that, he was born at 35 weeks,"
Tony tried to sitting up more but he felt really dizzy all of a sudden everything just seemed blurry
"I do have one question for you though," the brunette muttered, drawing circles on his bicep.
He hummed slightly as Steve finally kissed him fully again, cupping one of his cheeks ad they stayed in that intimate position as if it were their last time they'd get to spend with each other kissing, holding each other, just getting to love each other.
“Have you told him what I do?” Steve asked, his glare getting a bit harder, his son ignored both of his parents especially his pops seemingly getting angrier, continued to play with the little dinosaurs he snuck in his pockets.
"You know I'm only kidding," Steve chuckled, getting up and walked over towards Tony, hands-on his hips. "Promise me you'll head to the stage on time at least alright?"
Tony chuckled lightly as he looked up from walking towards the house noticing the black Audi, a smile making his way on his face.
"I doubt he'd do it," Nat lightly laughed. "I'm pretty sure he's  caught on, besides i doubt he'd not let you see him on his birthday,"
"I'll make sure to get justice for you, no matter what," he muttered softly before jogging away into the mansion to find pieces of old suits.
When they finally pulled back for air, Tony softly laid a hand on his cheek with a soft look on his face. "Never doubted you for a second... just had to hear it from you," he spoke softly, stroking his cheek with his thumb. "The years were just... very tough without you around Steve..., the nightmares... the guilt on all of us, but now you're here it all feels like a dream..,"
Steve nods and smiles. "We really did. We got Peter back and everyone else. Morgan is safe too. She's with Happy." He whispers. "Everything is okay now."
Peter closes the door and blocks it with a chai
Steve sighs. "I know what you're trying to do, Tony... I... I can't sign those accords..."
"Now its time for you to come home big guy,"
"Yaay!!" Peter squealed excitedly. "Now we can play more!" He said, bouncing in his arms.
"Want it really bad- please want your cock- want your cum to fill me up until I'm leaking till the next day- give it to me good please,"
“No no bub,” He spoke, shaking his head softly. “We’re trying to keep you safe until you’re older okay?” he slightly lied to his son, yes people saw them with Peter as they walked out of the orphanage but they never spoke about it to the public, they didn’t see the reason to as they were trying to keep their life as private as they could.
Steve smiles brightly and walks over to Tony and steps behind the counter. "Hey."
Tony groaned as the building collapsed on top of the two and everyone else was everywhere under the building pieces.
"I highly doubt there's lube hidden somewhere around this medical wing," He lightly joked watching the brunettes blush as he took in soft fingers, wetting them with his saliva, even looking at him in the eye, running his fragile fingers softly over steves hairy arm before steve thought they were wet enough and pulled them out.
Steve smiles as his little girl runs over to the living room with pepper, smiling as he watches Morgan.
"What the- Nat am I seeing things?" He said dropping his bag as he jogged over immediately. The assassin didn't say anything as she just played the hologram recording.
He took the plates away and set them y the sink, reminding himself mentally to do dishes later before picking up Peter. "I know you're bummed out but hey, I'm still here," he said with a smile as he took him to the kid's bedroom.
Morgan giggled as Tony handed her back over to Steve giving him a big hug
Steve wipes his tears away and smiles softly. "He will sign these papers bud."
His cheeks flushed as he looked at Steve. "R-really?" He croaked. "After everything i-i put you through?"
Peter just ate about half his omelet before just sliding the rest away from his plate. He rested his head on the table as he mumbled. "I'm full...," He said obviously bummed out.
Tony took a deep breath as he leaned back most likely after turning on his helmet message recording.
_________________
It was like another one of those days, where one of them would go on a long mission then come back days later after no contact with one another. Expect this one was 5 years, Tony thinking the love of his life was dead. Tony kept his head on the man's chest, eyes closed, ear pressed against where his heart was beating, let himself reassure the years of nightmares were false.
“fuck no no no- baby-,” he grumbled as he slowly peeled away the now dead armor around him- he couldn’t call for help now- Friday was down- no one knew where he was, he was stranded on Solkovia.
Tony clenched his fists, shaking his head slightly, not looking at him. "Why would I? After everything you’ve put me through," he said through gritted teeth trying again to push him off
He slowly nodded. "Probably.. she knew i wanted to be the one to tell you one day- when i was ready... i guess i was never ready to face you again-,"
"God... TONY!"
Peter looked towards the voice as his vision came too, whining at his head hurting, moving a hand up to his head to rub at his temple. "W-where's my dad? H-how did i get here- who are you- where am i-," he kind of just started rambling on with questions nervously.
Tony nodded as soon as he heard the timer he pressed a soft kiss to Steve's cheek as the door was slammed open. "Alright times up!" Said the birthday boy- hoping his evil plan worked
"Glad we agree on something," He remarked back at him.
Tony kinda kept his distance conversing with Bruce and all, Peter frowned he wanted his parents together that's all, so he had an idea. "As the birthday boy, i say we play 7 minutes in heaven,"
"Ambrosia... that was a SHIELDs bio-medical research project..," Tony stood up slowly from his chair setting his bottle down with a confused look on his face. "AIM must have acquired it during the takeover..,"
Peter nodded still clung to him tightly. "E-even if he s-says no- can y-you move back to new york? S-so i can see you outside of the c-compound??"
Steve gently kisses Tony's forehead and holds his hand tighter. "Remember that he's in space. I'm sure he's fine. He's with Strange." He whispers
"Maybe another day okay Petes?" He asked hoping he wouldn't throw another tantrum, god he hoped it wouldn't. But of course, Peter started to tear up at this.
Morgan joined the hug hugging her new brother as Tony lightly rubbed his back. Peter nodded hiding his face sniffling.
-"No, no, NO- Steve, what are you doing-," Tony was cut as his mouth dropped watching him yell out while George in the background trying to stop him, his shield in front of him as he rushed towards the spazzing out reactor. "No. just stop... Stop," His voice cracked as he slowly started backing up, his arms started shaking.
Tony groaned as his eyes fluttered open, his head tilting to the head. He spotted the iv with a sigh feeling the presence in the room. "I'm surprised you're even here to see me after that," he said still not looking at him.
-----------------------------
"Whoa, do i see the Captain America drinking? Dear, i must be dreaming," he laughed softly. "I'm doing alright i guess, how bout you?"
"We're trying to take senescence- and it looks like he did what he said he was going to do... Thanos wiped out 50% of the population of the world,"
"It wasn't my choice... I didn't want to sign the accords because it didn't seem right... I would be seen more like a weapon than a protector... Signing it was against my morals. And your dad... He wanted me to sign... But I couldn't... I just couldn't... So he basically told me that we were through... So I left and then the fighting broke out... That's what I regret most of all. The fighting." He looks down and tears fall down his cheeks. "If I would've known what was going to happen... I probably would've signed... Not signing is my biggest regret..."
Steve smiles at the videos and gently takes the bottle. "I think you should slow down babe."
"Really?" he turned back to look at her, she nodded in reply. "Huh, thought I changed that,"
But what he wasn't expecting was to see an old friend walking up towards his home along with this other teenage girl.
"Peter please get down from there!" he said frightened and concerned.
"Oxygen will run out by tomorrow morning and well... that'll be it," Tony eyes heavied a little. "And Steve I... I said no more surprises before you went off the grid... and I gotta say I was really hoping to pull off one last one.. but.. it looks like- well you know what it looks like,"
He frowns and shakes his head. "no... Please, Tony. Don't shut yourself off from me please..."
"You’re going to continue being you, babe. My husband. Morgan's father. And Peter still wants you to adopt him so you'll be Pete's father too. You can still be you, babe."
"What’s up princess?" He tilted his head lightly playing with her hair with a smile
"Well, uh Kamala," He rolled his eyes gesturing towards Banner, raising his voice in anger. "Your emerald-eye friend here is kind of on my shit list,"
"Papa!" the toddler said excited giggling happily as his Papa picked him up and spun him around after he hugged his leg
It wasn't long before TaskMaster, one of their recurring nemesis mostly Nat's due to her past trauma as a Russian spy, released sonic bombs onto the bridge while Tony, Thor, and Bruce were fighting off the swarms of robots and keeping the bridge stable while Nat and Clint headed off for the Taskmaster. Thor called down Thunder from the sky as he bashed any enemies blasting at him, Hulk smashing whatever was in his path including the tanks and cars parked on the gravel road, while Tony was air support using his rockets and repulsors taking out any of flight or the turners. They tried to save the day like they always did, it was going well as they were taking them down easily, bringing the stranded citizens to safety, getting the detonator from Taskmaster after Nat had pinned him down and knocked him out with a singular hard punch as Clint used the remote that stopped the bombs from going off. After regrouping, they failed to realize how silent their leader was on their comms. When they looked back at the ship, it was in the air, a blue light beam under it. The city was collapsing, the realization that they had been played sunk in.
"Because it IS awesome," the man laughed softly looking at her. "A 1.4 billion dollar vanity project- I may incinerate on takeoff but I'll look damn well good doing it,"
"You can't what? You're ditching me?" The girl spoke up, her eyebrows furrowed.
Steve looked back at Tony, trying his best to think on the spot. “Uh… well… you see…,” he started, but he had no idea where to go with it. “When the stork… brought you to us… um… you just had powers?” He tried, praying that there weren’t any questions asked. But, Peter thought about it, seeming like he wouldn’t believe it before just shrugging. “Makes sense,” his son’s response getting a chuckle out from his dad as McDonald’s was pulling up close.
"So you're both just going to walk away," Kamala asked in disbelief, Tony had enough of this and headed towards his RV. "The Avengers were set up! Cap was murdered!"
“Is this Mister Stark’s son? Anything I can do to help? Mister Stark looks very rattled,”
Steve frowns and runs after Tony. "Tony! Wait!" He yells. Tony had looked up shaking his head trying to speed up his walking muttering about wanting to be alone.
"I know i know," he pressed a kiss on his forehead. "And he doesn't care if you weren't,"
"I-I..," Bruce started motioning towards the girl. "I... I can't- I can't, Tony," Before Tony can even open up his mouth, the quiet one had cut him off.
The many curse words going through his head at the moment would have made his brain explode if he didn’t already know how to handle it from the years of anxiety attacks, but he looked at his husband for help in the matter.
"I've tried but there's no way to disengage the crystal," George replied panicking.
"For right now, yeah. My princess is tired, I can tell. And it's time to go to sleep, okay?" He says softly.
"That's only, Step One," Tony pushed himself off from leaning against the war table. "Georgie boy here is gearing up for a war,"
He smiles and tucks her into bed. "I love you, princess." He whispers.
"The Terrigen reactor was unstable," Bruce chipped in, giving Tony a knowing look as Tony scoffed. "And you knew that..., you knew that and yet still paraded it before the entire world!" He raised his voice slightly.
"Well that didn't work out did it?" Steve cut in, his face continued to keep a blank face hiding all emotions, he hated seeing him like this.
That shut Steve up before he could finish apologizing once again, gulping slightly, feeling like a lump was stuck in his throat, not even realizing a hand grabbed the back of his head bringing him down and before he knew it he felt those familiar soft lips on his.
He nods and sighs. "That's what would've made me sign the accords..." He whispers and sighs.
“All right. The glove's ready. Question is, who's gonna snap their freaking fingers?” the raccoon spoke up.
Steve holds Tony's hand tightly as he looks out the window to see the birds and nature sounds back. "Tony... It worked..." He whispers.
It wasn’t long before Tony slowly fell out of the anesthesia, groaning at the incoming headache, alerting the people in his room.
It ended up pursuing the males, stripping off each other's shirts, throwing them somewhere onto the floor, well they didn't really care so much about where their heap of clothing landed they had each other now, that's what mattered to them at the moment. It's been 3 years since they last saw each other, 3 years since they fought at the airport all over accords and their stupid controlled government who think they owned them.
Deciding to give the kid a break, he lightly chuckled as he pressed a kiss to his forehead. "Now go play, I'll make omelets for breakfast,"
Of course, Steve glanced back at Tony but he wanted to stay out of this conversation as long as possible, he wasn’t the type of person to talk about these things.
Tony's lips curled into a small. "Cause someone's got to watch this little bug," He said before raising his son and started blowing raspberries, his son's squeals of stops but his giggles are the cutest thing his dad has ever heard.
“What are you doing?” Tony asks, with just enough breathlessness to drive him insane.
over these past few weeks, and now he’s got the possibility of even more happiness spread out in front of him.
“Not to mention the sheer amount of property damage our little group can generate on any given day. I doubt your neighbors are going to appreciate the occasional hammer crashing through their walls, and I give it a week before the noise complaints get you evicted.”
Steve's voice resonates in the back of his head, a whisper that nevertheless cuts through the tempest in his mind.
“Up high.”
“And that requires obscure references to animated movies?”
If the legalese had infuriated the World Security Council, the implicit blackmail is enough to shut them up.  Fury, though, Fury seems less enraged than his name might imply.  If Steph didn’t know any better, she’d say he looks…proud?  At the very least he’d seems less angry than usual, which can only work out in the team’s favor.
bit overworked, and Pepper goes all mamma bear.  Give her an opening like that, and she’ll start blaspheming with words like “circadian rhythm” and “decaf.”  Ain’t gonna happen.)  On the other hand, if his brain is performing at slightly less than its usual brilliant capacity, the least he can do is appreciate the breakdown, because the man in front of him is unfairly gorgeous.
” Steph demands, her voice rising.
isn’t exactly the film for people with a justifiable fear of drowning.  He mentally makes a note to strike any and all films with water related deaths from the film queue.  Later, though.  Right now, Steve needs his undivided attention.
“What?”  He has a feeling he’s missing something.
It’s hard to pinpoint what exactly about Natasha Antonia Stark that sends her up the wall.  Maybe it’s the way that woman has a quip for every single interaction, no matter the severity of the situation.  It could be her blatant disregard for the very real danger they’re all in or her willingness to go toe to toe with Steph, even when the top of her head barely reaches Steph’s chin.  All Steph knows is that dozens of trifling little things come together in one eternally vexing woman whom, try as she might, Steph just can’t seem to get a handle on.  What kind of person, she wonders, designs a weaponized flight suit for private use, fights without backup, and answers to no authority but her own whim?  And what on earth is she doing on this team?
“Sorry?” Steve asks.
“I think so?” he tells her.  He hopes so, at least.  “He seemed more concerned with the fact that I’d missed out on twenty years of technology than anything else.”
His head snaps up ready to murder whoever’s dared to touch them, but, surprisingly, everyone else has maintained the proper perimeter.  He has no idea what to make of that, until an all-to-familiar voice slices through his thoughts.
Tony starts pointing at his bots, calling out their names as his finger circulates.  “U.  Butterfingers.  JARVIS is my eye in the sky.  And Dum-E…Dum-E, where are you?”  He looks around the lab and tries to find his problem child.  Dum-E knows he’s supposed to stay on his charging station when he doesn’t have a job to do, but there’s no telling what happens when he decides to go walkabout.  The last time Dum-E had gone into hiding, he’d broken the blender and hidden the shattered pieces behind the 3D printer.  It had taken him three days to locate the smell of rotting bananas.
Steve chuckles and kisses him again. "Well, I knew you could." He laughs cutely and kisses his lips again and again.
He hummed softly feeling that Steve fell asleep. He fell asleep soon after
The star- now shown to be a woman known as Captian Marvel sent it down gently on the ground. After a minute the hatch opened to reveal none other than Tony Stark looking pale and on the brink of death is supported up by the Blue robot as they slowly had to walk down, tony even tripped a few times but remained standing.
They were walking around the ward as they were trying to make sense of a lot of the confusion after regrouping every time they had new information about his son- the amount of guilt and regret Steve had- if he’d just-
"Well, Hey Bruce," He glared towards him before going back to his cooking
Another pause.
Bruce shook his head "Kamala, it's okay...," he softly spoke, crossing his arms across his chest as he gestures his head towards the quinjet. "Um... Why don't you... why don't you go head inside?"
Tony turned his head lifting him not hurt arm his voice was hoarse it sounded so scratchy. "S-steve?" He croaked- was it just him or did someone take most of the oxygen-
"We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now, few deep space scans, satellites and we got nothing," Steve paused before he looked at his lover. "Tony you fought him,"
"No, you can't make me," the toddler said crossing his arms with a glare.
He huffed at hearing this, pouting a little. "But now you got me all excited about it,"
Steve's lips curved into a soft devious smile, leaning into his hand as he ran his hands up and down Tony's waist. "I have a suggestion to fix that,"
After he turned off the helmet he grabbed the blanket he had found on the ship laying down on the cold metal floor curled up. Fuck he just wanted to go home, be with the man he loved. Their last date was before Steve had to go off the grid because of their stupid government. He dazed off wondering if Steve looked any different from the last time he saw him if he still loved him if he'd come back to him. What if he finally realized Tony wasn't enough for him and decided to go back to his best friend?
Fury ignores the back and forth and turns to address the room.  “I’m here because a certain group of superheroes didn’t bother to come to the mandatory debrief.”  He throws a particularly sharp glare at Natasha, who merely shrugs and keeps spooning ice cream out of a bowl.
“So that’s the way it is?” Steve answers, his voice still soft.
“That’s interesting,” she replies slowly, her voice cautious.
He allows himself a brief look southward into Manhattan.  Iron Man’s probably already made his way back to the tower by now and is most likely filling Tony in on everything that’s happened.  He suppresses a brief pang of jealousy, and marches onward to do his job.
Steve seems unable to grasp the nuances of his awesome sense of humor, because he still looks vague and uncomprehending.  Slightly disappointed, he lets go of Steve’s shoulders and steps back.
“I’m serious.”
“God, Tony, no!  No, I just…  I just wanted one good thing in my life,” he places the exceedingly useless glass back on the bar where it belongs, which frees up his hands to reach for Tony’s face.  He places just enough pressure on Tony’s jaw line to hold his face in place, meeting his eyes and hoping to convey just how serious he is.  “Turns out,” he continues, “that’s you.”
It’s an indication of how much Tasha’s grown on her that she finds this funny and not obnoxious.  More importantly, experience has taught her about Tasha’s coping methods.  The humor’s going a long way to dispel the digital tension, so she allows herself to play along.
“Yes,” he replies as he gathers up his keys.
This is not one of those times.
“Don’t keep me waiting too long, Shellhead.  After all, it’s for a good cause.”
“I’m afraid not, Sir.  I really must insist, or else I shall have to inform Miss Potts of your negligence.”
“Iron Man!” Steve exclaims happily and looks upward.  The figure flying above him isn’t an artificially animated bronze statuette, but a much flashier red and gold model who is, amazingly, carrying his shield.  “Boy am I glad to see you!”
“All right, Steve Rogers, what exactly can I do for you today?”
The scene has been switched onto a cable news channel, where a blonde anchor is speaking solemnly into the camera.
“However, I don’t think it would be in breach of protocol to observe that Sir has checked his phone during this business trip far more frequently than on previous occasions.  Furthermore, his increased heart rate and dilated pupil while in your presence suggest that he finds your company enjoyable.
Steve supposes it’s only natural that two people who spend so much time together might be drawn to one another. They’re both smart, driven workaholics who care deeply about the Avengers and the values the group upholds. Their relationship makes sense, which makes Steve’s visceral opposition to their being together romantically so bizarre.
Tasha’s voice cuts through her inconveniently-timed mental rambles.  “You want a ride?  Somehow I doubt that motorcycle is fully operational.”  Tasha moves an armored finger towards the place that Steph had parked her bike and…yeah, that thing’s not starting anytime soon.
“Fabulous,” he answers, and for once there’s not a trace of irony embedded in that word.
“So we can finally get rid of that monstrosity?” he asks and extends one finger accusatorily toward the flip phone resting on the corner of the desk.  It had hurt him to let the thing rest in his lab overnight, but he didn’t want Steve falling back on bad habits.  He’d agreed to hang onto the relic just in case Steve showed remarkably poor judgment and rejected his tech, but he’s thoroughly looking forward to the flip phone’s ultimate destruction.
Convenient, that.  Still annoying.
It never comes.  Instead of hitting solid pavement, she feels her body being jolted upward, the sudden shift making her stomach sink like she’s on a roller coaster.  There’s a hard presence around her waist, and a familiar humming noise buzzes through her ears.  A flash of scarlet confirms what she already knows; by some miracle, Tasha’s shown up and, once again, is sparing her the pain of impact.
“It it’s not too bold of me to ask,” he starts, “what do you think of me and Tony?”
team after all, even if Tony doesn’t know it.  He is glad that the habitual sarcasm is back in Tony’s voice, though.”  “They did fine.  At least, they were able to hold things off until..."
“Damn it!”
The next few minutes are blurs of red, white, blue, and bronze, as he desperately tries to find a way to best subdue three large, metal assailants that are equipped with unnatural strength and foot-long claws.  It takes him far too long to incapacitate all three figures, but he eventually picks his way out of the bronzed bear carcases and starts working back to the team.
“According to Pepper, we’ve been dating for about three months.”
“Isn’t that what it’s supposed to do?” Steve’s voice is surprisingly frustrated.
“Everyone’s fine for the most part.  A couple of the agents who were on the perimeter are going to have some pretty nasty bruises, but there weren’t any fatalities.”
“Did you have a question, sir?” he asks.
“So,” he starts slowly, “I’m gonna need you to tell me if I’m reading this wrong.”
Natasha Romanov terrifies him, but he’s okay with that.  Only fools are unafraid of the Black Widow.
“You’ve never said anything before.” He tries to keep the bitterness out of his voice, but he must not succeed entirely given Iron Man’s reaction.
where I thought you were going with this!”
outside his door?)  Needless to say, the lack of results and the feeling of being watched all day had him itching for a fight.  Yet once again, the minion didn't live up to his end of the bargain.  Tony had approached the doors with blackout mode still engaged, curious to see what exactly the agent would do after lying in wait for over fourteen hours; as the doors slid open, Rogers’ head perked up, and Tony braced himself for the other man to finally let it all out.  He was secretly looking forward to the all-out scream fest.
“Amazing, isn’t it?”  Her voice sound light and detached, and her eyes never leave the bronze Alice.  Steve keeps moving with caution.
has to work out the kinks, and that someone might as well be you.”
Steve frowns and stays behind Peter. "Mr. Stark, it's Peter. Peter Parker. We did it, Mr. Stark." Steve comes behind him. "He's going to okay, Queens." He whispers, calling the kid his nickname for him. He bends down and gently kisses Tony's head as he holds his other hand. "Tony? Can you talk to me, baby?"
Tony immediately stood up using the table as support, knocking over a glass or two that was in front of him. "You know what I need? A shave," continuing as he begins to rip out the IV in his arm. "And I believe I remember-," He hears his best friend Rhodes in the background calling his name as he rips it out a bit painful as he began raising his voice a little. "Otherwise that what we needed was a suit of armor around the world remember that? Whether it impacted other precious freedoms or not that's what we needed,"
Steve frowns when Tony starts to get upset about Peter. He kisses his forehead before suddenly smiling at Morgan. He looks over at his friends and nods. "Please stay for lunch guys," Steve says happily as the two nodded they were starving.
His eyes opened and slowly closed, just seemed pretty tired now, when was the last time he slept- he asked himself laying back. Was this the end for him?
"Well that didn't work out did it?" Steve cut in, his face continued to keep a blank face hiding all emotions, he hated seeing him like this.
Steve nods and smiles softly. "I think that's best." He whispers and sighs softly. "I want to be with you... I want to forget everything that happened and I want to start over..."
Steve smiles and blushes slightly as he sees Peter and all of his friends.
"I said we'd lose, you said we'll do that together too," he pointed a finger at him. "And guess what Cap? We lost and you weren't there- but that's what we do right? Our best work after the fact what we're the Ah-vengers? We're the Ah-vengers? Not the Pre-Vengers? Right?"
"Shut up and don't worry I dusted off your Encylopedia collection when we got the door to our room open,"
"Okay let's see what we got...," he muttered under his breath pulling up the folder, searching for something useful. Hold up... he paused as he stared at the screen. This didn't make sense... This formula was being formed by some kind of inhuman- possibly, also explains Tarleton's big growing head. A scan of the person's brain, a full body of their captivity, and their vitals displayed on the screen- he may have come for a lab but he wasn't going to keep them suffering. All he had to do was now find this door, maybe this was the answer.
"Would you have done differently if he told you?" Natasha tilted her head.
Steve kisses his forehead. "it's going to be okay, baby." He whispers.
He doesn't know how long he locked himself in his workshop, he broke his many years of sobriety by pulling out his expensive scotch for celebrations- but he just wanted to feel some kind of numb. He was so ready to fight for justice, to take Tarleton to prison for the murder of Captain America- the whole reason he joined up with his ex-teammate and the stretchy teenage girl.
He instantly shakes his head. "No... You're fine, kiddo. You don't have to apologize..." He was so happy to see his son, but he was heartbroken to know that Tony had never once mentioned him to his own son. He was actually kind of pissed but he didn't show it. "It's okay, Peter. Is there anything you need? I'm here to help so if you need anything, just ask."
Tony raised an eyebrow looking at Natasha and Lang confused. "I’m scared to ask but what’s going on?"
Tony saw Peter and Morgan then looked at Steve before bringing him down into a hug sniffling into his shirt.
"We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now, few deep space scans, satellites and we got nothing," Steve paused before he looked at his lover. "Tony you fought him,"
Tony finished his omelet and looked over at his son and frowned. "You sure bug?"
Tony sat in his wheelchair, he has in one of his hand, an IV hooked up to his other arm as he listened on to the assassin, one eye peering at the now missing heroes, Captian Marvel- now known as Carol Danvers was looking at on another screen, her gaze froze on Nick Fury's picture, eyes slowly moving to the ground.
"Hey... You're okay kid, Relax. You're in a hospital in a country called Wakanda. You're safe." He whispers. "You're dad is here, just in a waiting room. You just got out of surgery. My name is Steve. I know your dad. We... used to work together." He says softly. "The doctor is probably talking to your dad right now."
As soon as Tony took Peter home to the compound, he knew Peter snuck around to see his other dad, and well he stopped caring about the second time, he couldn't keep a teenager from seeing his other dad so he'd let him go. He stayed up in the lab working on his son's birthday gift with a soft smile on his face, a new spider suit, and just new equipment.
Steve got away and smiles once he gets to their meeting point and sees Peggy standing there. He was happy to see her once more. Especially since she’s young and happy and is doing what she loved.
Tony lightly played with the mans hair with one hand and the other rubbed his back muttering how he was allowed to cry it out and  that he was here for him
"They expose them to near-lethal amount D.A.R.K terrigen," Nat steps in, crossing her arms across her chest.
"Okay doll," Steve nods, just wanting to help Tony relax for right now, there was a small pause as Tony scooted over in the med-bay bed gesturing Steve to crawl in
Steve walks over to Peter and places a hand on his shoulder. "Hey, Queens." He uses the kid’s nickname and smiles softly. "You alright there kid?"
“He’s a little calm… just really shaken up,” he replied, running his fingers through whispering soothing words into the toddler’s ear including their love and support.
The silence took over the room as Tony ripped off the detachable arc reactor, grabbing steves hand, and slammed it into his hand, already becoming breathless from the air supply.
"Bunch of tired old meals," He started his way towards Steve continuing his rant. "I got nothing for you Cap, no coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options- zero zip nada," he paused looking right at him. "No trust, you fucking lying piece of shit of a boyfriend, I needed you but you left me,"
Peter huffed at this, crossing his arms as his father set him on one of the kitchen stools after he gave up on his attempts of getting down. "You're mean,"
"But but- Lemme go see Daddy! I wanna see robots!" said as he bounced up and down angrily or well-tried before Tony stopped him holding him down in his lap.
"I-i still want to see you- even if dad doesn't i do- the other parent I’ve never had-,"
"I promise bug,"
"You should know, I'm not in the best of moods," a voice boomed as a new person joined them on the ship, slamming down a spazz of lightning destroying one of the big robots.
Tony's lips curved into a smile as he moved on from the bag over to the bookshelf near the bed, running the tip of his finger over the binder of Steve's rare collectible Encyclpida collection- he remembered how much of an oldies nerd the man was. He never really follow or understand the new world and preferred the old times. Always kept old things spread out around the room, he didn't mind one bit. He could feel the tears already building up- maybe it was cause he tried to push back what happened 5 years ago, try to move on but the guilt haunts him when he's awake... when he's asleep in bed- feels like it will always be on his mind every second of each day.
Steve was sitting in the meeting room, thinking about the accords and everything. He looked over at the door to see his fiancé and he smiled softly over at him.
“Processing…,”
It ended soon enough, Tony was dosing off on Steve's shoulder as he told Friday to turn the tv off
"That won't be for another 12 years Steve," the brunette looked towards him.
"Yeah..., the poor baby must have been really scared,"
"Hm... kind of buried the lead ya know," Tony awkwardly spoke, plugging in the thumb drive. "Could have told me about that earlier?" He sighed softly as he sat back watching the files download taking a glance at Bruce who was about to sit down before he remarked. "No no no, no sitting on my couch you're still on the list," he spoke with a glare in his facial expression before turning back to his computer as the download finished, starting to search through the files before asking the girl behind him.
He stares at Steve in the rearview mirror before looking back at Peter. “Well, your Pops is super duper strong and well me? I don’t got any bud,”
After waking up, fully cut out of the dead iron man suit, he was told that he was on the brink of death if Vision hadn't found him in time he could've lost his little one too.
"Cap smashed the reactor,"
Tony went silent for a few seconds as he looks to the side nervously.
"Excuse Sir Stark-Rogers," The AI Friday spoke up. "Sorry to interrupt but your husband has just arrived in the driveway,"
Tony paused again, closing his eyes a little, letting out a small grunt of pain, and opened them again. He had to finish this for Steve.
She grabbed the folder and set it aside, knowing she would have to sneak it back when she had time- the room door opened as they wheeled in the unconscious boy, hooked up to an IV, bandages wrapped in many places.
"Tony I'm going to need you to focus-,"
The hospital aid tilted their head. “I wouldn’t know the answer to that I do apologize- I only know that the King and his sister would go visit the uh- compound for a week”
Steve laughs cutely and kisses his cheek. "Everything okay, Tones?"
Steve looks over at Peter and shakes her head. "I... I don't know about that."
----------------------------------------------------
"Yeah definitely," he laughed. "Alright one pop before bed and that’s it, you should be in bed, didn’t papa put you to bed?"
"Doll, please," the man lightly whined, traveling his hands down to cup his ass cheeks, giving them a light squeeze earning a soft moan from Tony. "Its been forever... and i missed you and just want to appreciate what's in front of me...,"
“What is this?” he asked aloud, they died in a car crash that was-
"Bunch of tired old meals," He started his way towards Steve continuing his rant. "I got nothing for you Cap, no coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options- zero zip nada," he paused looking right at him. "No trust, you fucking lying piece of shit of a boyfriend, I needed you but you left me,"
"Yes papa," she looked up qt him with her adorable smile. "I prwmise!"
Tony was getting drowsy by the second, he felt Steve pull out and pull himself into his strong super soldier arms as he let himself slip into the darkness of sleep.
Steve nods and turns on Finding Nemo. "Sounds good." He smiles and gently kisses his son's head.
Steve smiles brightly at Tony and reaches for his hand. He was so happy to be back with his family.
Tony turned around and saw the young version of his abusive father. He took a deep breath thanking him and tried walking off but the man stopped him.
Steve smiles and kisses Tony's cheek again. "come on in guys." He smiles and opens the door for his friends.
"I don't get it,"
"Papa would be grumpy pants," Peter said before he decided to run to his costume chest pulling out his toy captain America helmet before sliding it on his head and turning to his dad, deciding to play a little and mock what he's seen his other dad do a lot when he's home. "I've worked too much, I'm too tired, Do it yourself Tony," He said in a grumpier and deeper voice but started giggling after. Tony made himself laugh instead of a sigh, he didn't want Peter to know how lonely and sad he was without his husband around. "Ah my silly little Pete," he said as he picked up the boy and spun him around, Peter clinging to him after he was brought down from above. Even if he gave his dad a hard time, he did love him a lot, he loved his dads equally.
Steve gently takes Tony's hand and kisses his knuckles. "Y'know, I still love you. I've never stopped loving you."
"Doll... I'm sorry... I'm so sorry," Steve softly started leaning his elbows on the bed, not pulling his hand away. "I shouldn't have abandoned you like I did a year back and fight you until you were bloodied and broken.. left you to die.. ran off with Bucky to go off the grid,"
15 years later, years after the civil war, years later after Siberia where he thought his unborn kid was dead by the time he was found. When he opened his eyes again, he could see bright lights, people yelling around him before it went black again
"Hey!" The voice said. "Exits this way,"
"Yes yes, I'm spidey boy!" Peter said happily, squirming from the tickling.
Steve chuckles and pecks his lips again. "We will get Peter back." He whispers. "I know we will. I believe in us."
“If you leave the mask at home, I’ll buy you ice cream!” He tried bribing the little one.
He had it paused until tony came in with the sodas and a big bowl of popcorn
"I agree, it feels more right than the past 15," he got off the couch. "Should we just leave him? He looks peaceful,'
Peter immediately hugged the man tightly as he could hiding his face.
Peter- with Tony’s help- crawled into the back of the car where he smiled big, looking out of the window. Tony got in next to him after helping him, pressing a kiss to the top of his son’s head as Steve started up the car starting to drive off. “Make sure he’s buckled,” he reminded him.
"Mhm everything’s peachy," he turns his head after leaning it back on steves shoulder. "Just thoughts,"
Steve hugs Tony close and kisses his cheek gently. "I've got you, babe. I've got you."
"Well... at least its quiet,"
Steve glanced in the rearview mirror at his husband, sending him a bit of a glare. “You told him about the basement?”
He nods and smiles brightly. "Yes, it is, princess."
"Well if it isn't my little twin hm?" Steve pressed a kiss to the boy's forehead. "Like father like son hm? You look so adorable in that, it suits you," he teased as Peter started going on a rant about how much he missed him and how his day went, but it was through his mind, so climbing the tree was climbing a skyscraper and being put in timeout was a jail and all that while Tony stood from afar watching the two, listening while he grabbed a water bottle and headed over to the two to greet his husband.
“No I haven’t,” Tony spoke truthfully, he didn’t want Peter to know about the bad of the world so he never mentioned what Steve truly did.
"Tones, what are you still doing up here?" Steve asked, an eyebrow slightly raised. "We're needed on stage soon,"
"Oh god, I hope so..,"
Steve and what was left of the Avengers headed back to the headquarters once filled with agents and chatter now filled with confusion and fear. Word was out that Fury disappeared
He moves both hands to steves cheeks, stroking his cheeks feeling the freshly shaven cheeks. "I-i'm sorry i didn't call-,"
He looks over at Tony with tears in his eyes. "I'm not playing a prank on you, Tony." He whispers. "I would never do something so cruel..." He whispers and bends down and gently kissed his lips quickly.
After the last bite and putting her back in bed. "Alright, missy now you ready to sleep?"
With a soft pat. "I'm sure you can make this all alright- I wouldn't push this onto Tony though so fast but start with something small- maybe start with seeing your son- don’t mention to him about you being his other dad yet,"
"Good, i made spaghetti" tony smiled at them before walking inside
Steve gently kisses his lips back. "We will get the kid back... I promise."
"What is this?" He asked, turning around in his chair to face both of the people in his RV. "Who is- Who is Tiny Dancer?"
Fuck tony was panicking as he told the others he was going after peter and getting him help as he sent his suits to help knowing he wouldn’t be back, he found him, he looked like he took a plane to the body. He picked him up and without thinking he knew Wakanda was the best bet to help him, he wasn't a doctor and the hospitals would see the spiderman suit. He flew off sending T'challa a message he was on the way and to prepare a room for Peter in panic. When he arrived he was met by Shuri and other scientists with one of those hologram stretchers. T'challa told him he prepared a room for Tony knowing he wouldn't leave his son’s side.
"It's good to see you too, Bruce," Nat smiled softly back at him before walking past him, dragging her best friend away to the jet, Bruce following along after being lost in thought.
"You're right," He hummed, with his other hand he ran his fingers through their fast asleep toddler's hair. "What do you say I have the person who made my suit, make him a costume for his birthday and maybe have an expanding suit in cloth form?"
He heard the brunette whine when he so suddenly pulled out all fingers at once, leaving him empty. Steve spit into the hand that he used his fingers to prep, twice, using this as a not so less painful way lube, he knew how weak Tony was and didn't want him to do any work. He groaned softly as he spreads the spit over his length before adjusting Tony's hips as he eased himself into him, trying his hardest not to flick his hips up right away, trying to take his time showing him how much he cared for the man on his lap.
He lightly hummed, pulling the alcohol-soaked pad off and used the small bandages putting two on the scratch luckily not needing any stitches. “Mhm, Peter suggested it when I asked what he wanted for dinner- if you don’t mind,”
She was the closest to Fury so might as well, they agreed on.
This place was full of hallways, twists, and turns, it felt like there wasn't an end. It was dusty, space dust everywhere, filled with covered boxes in a lot of these rooms, like no one had been here in years, not in use. It was as if they weren't trying to keep something out... but something in. Having to use some of the juice left to fly up on a broken elevator shaft and take out the security turners, having to drop down and more hallways to run through, he finally reached the room.
Steve smiles brightly as he watches his son's experiences.
He nodded as he hugged him tightly. "T-this is the best birthday ever,"
"Huh," he said with a slight smile, god he never smiled at him when he was a kid. "Rogers, like ol Captian Rogers?"
Tony immediately stood up using the table as support, knocking over a glass or two that was in front of him. "You know what I need? A shave," continuing as he begins to rip out the IV in his arm. "And I believe I remember-," He hears his best friend Rhodes in the background calling his name as he rips it out a bit painful as he began raising his voice a little. "Otherwise that what we needed was a suit of armor around the world remember that? Whether it impacted other precious freedoms or not that's what we needed,"
Steve wipes his tears away again. "Yes. I absolutely 100% know he still will, he missed you alot when you went to dust..."
"Worlds Governments are in pieces, uh... the parts that are still working-,"
Steve laughs cutely and gently kisses her forehead. "Okay okay, well... Once upon a time, there once was a King. He lived in a tall tower that looked over his kingdom. It was a peaceful kingdom. Until one day, a God came to hurt his kingdom, bringing the war to the once peaceful kingdom. The king needed help. He needed a team of warriors to help him protect his kingdom. He had multiple heroes; a spy, an Archer, a beast, a God, and then the soldier. They all worked together as The Avengers. But after everything had calmed down at the war, something happened between the King and the Soldier. Do you know what that was, Princess?" He asks her softly.
Silence came over the group after Bruce and Pepper carried Tony back to the medical wing leaving Nat, Rhodes, Nebula, Carol, and Rocket, along with Steve himself who had to take a seat after the events, putting his face in his hands.
Steve was driving back home, continuously worriedly looking back in the mirror to see if he was calming down, and luckily it looked like Peter was slowly relaxing in his father's arms. He started to just sniffle once finally calm while his dad continued to rock him as Peter just fell into a deep sleep after the whole ordeal that happened.
“I believe we have it handled mostly here, Captain,” the head surgeon responded, looking up at him. “You could help set up a recover room with one of the aids, we’re finishing up here, I’m sure mister stark is just worried that’s all,”
In the end, it’s the term
had also been enlightening.
“It still doesn’t seem very polite,” he replies with a slight smile.
Steve chooses to ignore that.  “I think we can both agree that our last meeting did not go according to plan.  What I want to know is, what can I do to convince you to revisit your construction plans?”
He still doesn’t quite understand why this is all such a big deal.  Okay, maybe Tony is a bit particular about who comes into his lab, and it maybe it is a kind of strange that Tony’s devoted so much of his time to ensuring that Steve feels comfortable, but that speaks more to how Tony is just a genuinely good person, not because Steve’s anything special.  He still hasn’t quite worked out why Tony’s gotten along with him as opposed to the other field agents, but he’ll figure it out.  Eventually.
Steve, though he gets it.  He completely understands the three little word embedded within that unfortunate outburst, of his tiny answering smile is any indication.  “Language,” chides, though the words have no heat to them.
She does make a difference.  Falling debris has trapped some people on the seventy-sixth floor, and she’s able to clear some rubble that the fireman definitely wouldn’t have been able to move in time.  She’s making one final sweep when the ceiling caves in, effectively cutting off her access to all exits.
“I’ll meet them on the landing pad,” Steve answers as he sprints to the stairwell, not trusting the elevators to get him there faster. With any luck, he can be waiting for them when they land.
“Tomorrow.”  Fury turns, apparently satisfied with getting the last word.  He nods briefly towards Bruce with a succinct
"Wait...Tony?" Steve blinked as he tried to pull himself up slightly, barely doing much ." Tony..," he repeated, when he finally started to feel circulation again, he pulled himself to his elbows as he stared at his face, blankly as he ran his fingers over tony's cheek, the two just laying in silence as if this was just a dream to the both of them.
Steve sighed as he relaxed laying back on the bed, petting the boy's hair softly. "I think he's good and knocked out now, can I tell you what I had in mind?"
“Just a moment..,”
Steve chuckles softly. "Peter, you can call me Steve." He says softly and smiles sadly.
--------------------------------------------------------
He giggled before running back over to his friends with a big smile
He paused again. "So, fuel cells were cracked during the battle and we figured out a way to reverse the iron charge bought ourselves about 48 hours of flight time but uh... it's now dead in the water.. 1000 light-years from the nearest 7-11," He always tried to joke in situations like this but he knew Steve wasn't going to laugh.
The Terrigin, the element that the Avengers had created and showed at Avengers Day, shouldn't have been released to the public. And because of that, it caused damage on an unprecedented scale to San Francisco. Thousands of people died while many more bear the scars of what had become known as A Day, hundreds fell sick, encased in strange cocoons only to emerge with dangerous, otherworldly powers. With no known cure, it has spread across the country
He walked over and grabbed a glass of water and hands it to Tony. "Of course I do. I love you, Tony."
"Okay, okay," Steve cut him off taking a deep breath. "Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything,"
Morgan waves him off and snuggles into her bedsheets, Steve slowly backed out of the room after turning off the lamp and closed her door ajar before going downstairs to see what his husband was up to, spotting Tony doing the dishes with a frown on his face, he immediately walks up behind Tony and hugs him close from behind, gently kissing his neck. "Hey, Handsome."
"Perfect landing... but damnit not much juice left in these repulsors," Tony huffed as he finally got into the satellite without too many problems besides almost being sent back to Earth many times after having to manually remove his booster. "Hope this place isn't crawling with Georgie's guards...,"
Tony hummed lightly, gave his husband a quick peck on the lips before turning his head to his son.."Yeah bubs, he's gonna spend alot more with us,"
Peter looked up at his Dad with big eyes full of curiosity. “What does pops do? Why can’t I know?” he asked with a small pout as he asked.
"Figure it out later, right now its sleep time,"
She clapped her hands happily. "Thaats me!"
Tony paused for a moment sinking it all in before patting the kid on the shoulder. "Come on...Let's go regroup the rest of the team," he gave her a soft saddening smile.
"S-steeb- fuck...," He watched Tony's head as his eyes squeezed shut as he was eased onto Steves cock, his fingernails digging into Steve's forearm probably gonna leave marks by the morning, his head buried in his neck, he felt Tony's teeth nibbling at his neck, he knew Tony was trying to quiet himself but he was going to be very loud when Steve would start moving. He moved so he was laying back onto his back, pulling Tony with him, still inside of him.
Kamala nods in reply and just heads off, he waited for her to be out of sight before turning his attention to the two assassins, he couldn't help but his lips curling into a smile first turning to the redhead.
Tony let out a slight laugh, resting fingers on his forehead. "I saw this coming a few years back I had a vision, I didn't want to believe it but it was a dream,"
Natasha's lab is sort of like the secret lair of Stark Tower. The further underground you go, the higher your security clearance must be, and only the woman herself and Iron Man have access to the most important rooms on the ground floor. Steve assumes this is where the magic happens. All he knows is that Natasha Stark and Iron Man disappear into this room late at night and Iron Man emerges the next day with technical upgrades.
