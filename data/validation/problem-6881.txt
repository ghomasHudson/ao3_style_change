But Steve wasn’t changing back.  Tony took a deep breath, reaching out to touch one of Steve’s limbs and trying to reassure himself that this was okay.  After all, it hadn’t been immediate last time, either.  So he could wait.
With the coast relatively clear again, Tony ran back out, following the rope through the smoke and arriving back at the pit. "Rhodey?" he yelled as he got there.  But the rope hung loose, and the pit was empty.  It was then that he realized that everything was suddenly quiet—no more gunfire, no more shouting, only the quiet crackle of fire on leaves—
Right.  He and Rogers had been walking, heading toward the entrance again, when they’d both collapsed for no reason…
Tony exhaled softly.  "I don't know, Steve."  There was a pause, and then he continued, "Did… did you see his arm?"
Bucky had also ultimately been turned into a mindless being who had nearly killed Steve, but Steve held his tongue about that.  Tony was right.  There was some happiness in his life after he'd fallen in the mountains, and Steve needed to hold onto that.
With a groan, he pulled himself away, jogging to class and arriving just in time.  The period felt like it dragged on forever, and even doing more theorizing on the microbots he'd been working on as a side project didn't make time pass any faster.  The rest of the day was similarly slow, but the good thing about time was that it
He sounded so certain, Tony almost believed it.  He wanted to believe it.  "Okay," he said.  He managed a smile back.  "Good."
The eyeroll Cap did in response was almost contained.  Almost.  "I figured that out," he said.  "'Cap' is fine."
Tony gazes back at the stars with half-lidded eyes, watching them twinkle into and out of existence.  The night is silent around him, and all he’s aware of is the sky, the ocean, and Steve wrapped around his body.
Tony shook his head, leading him under the archway that proclaimed they were entering the St. Barnabas Hospital.  Steve thought he could hear a chime or something as they passed through, even though they were still outdoors, but he wasn't sure.  "The hospital might have disinfectant.  Needles and thread for sutures.  Maybe a sink that I can get working.  It's better inside."
Well, Howard is already mad from the looks of it, but what can they do now?  Steve’s not running away, so it’s probably best to just deal with it.  “Alright.  Stand up straight and follow me.”  He takes a deep breath—as much as he enjoys pissing his father off, it still kind of terrifies him.  Just not by enough so that he wants to stop, is all.  Then he saunters up to the table, nodding to Sunset before turning to Howard.  “Father,” he announces.  “I’d like to introduce Steve Rogers to you.  I met him up on deck last night, and I thought he would be enjoyable company.”
The woman immediately slumped onto the ground again, letting out a sound that was a cross between a laugh and a cry.  "Jess?" she tried.  "Jess, the hell are you doing here?  Where's Luke?  Where's Danielle?"
(Steve isn’t perfect all the time, though.  He sits down next to Tony one evening, looking glum: “I tried to look up the American dream,” he tells Tony, “but all I found were results about real estate.”  Tony laughs, but he feels bad about it afterward, so they sit down and listen to CDs of the Midnight Racer.)
Tony stood.  He didn't know why, but he couldn't sit there anymore, listening to Steve say what sounded like—like a damned
"No, there's no need," he finally said.  "Unless you want to get everyone at once.  We should figure out what we're going to do in Fengjing."
He looks back up, heart fluttering.  “I have a headache,” he announces.  “For which I have you to thank, Father.  So I’ll be heading back to my room.  Good evening.”  Before they can protest, he leaves the dining room, heading for the staircase—and there Steve is, facing away from him, studying the mural surrounding the clock.  “Steve?”
“Sure I have.”  Rogers turned his attention back to the notepad, scribbling something down.  Probably more notes.  “Used to be a big fan.”
"You're wrong, Mr. Birch," Cap said.  His gaze seemed unfocused, but he looked remarkably calm otherwise, completely at odds with Tony's frayed instincts, which were telling him to go back up and find the others.  "The others.  They're up there, destroying the carrier's missile launchers as we speak.  Nothing is leaving this ship."
“Holy shit,” he gasped, arms flailing as he scrambled backwards, reaching for his pack so that he could retrieve his gauntlets.  The giant sabretooth whined, and Tony blinked, belatedly remembering that oh right, this was the kind of company he was keeping these days because his life was crazy.  “…Sorry,” he said after a moment, still trying to catch his breath.  Was Steve trying not to laugh?  It looked like he was trying not to laugh.  “Hey.  I dare you to react any differently if our positions had been reversed.”  Really!  If Steve had been in Tony’s position, he’d probably have decapitated him with his shield by now.
"You know," one voice was saying, accusing and almost frantic.  "You know what it does.  Tell me!  Tell me why I'm seeing these things—"
Tony woke with a jolt, sucking in a lungful of air and immediately coughing it out.  He felt like hell.  His throat hurt, his arm hurt, his side hurt, his everything hurt.
Honestly, he didn’t know anything.  But the cave drawings had suggested that the tallest mountain in the area was a good place to be, and if there was something,
"Sweetheart," replied the woman and now that Steve looked more closely, the resemblance was evident.  They had the same eyes. "You shouldn't be sleeping here. It's bad for your back."
since their last switch; he could hardly believe it - but that journal, Tony had thought, had been so important to them both.  All Tony could find instead was a sketchbook, which just made it sting a little more. Steve had made space in his personal belongings for a sketchbook, but not his journal?  What if the two of them had swapped places earlier; what did Steve expect Tony to do? Had he just given up on ever switching with Tony again?
And so he learns the awful, terrible truth.  He learns about the registration act, learns about how he believed in it so much he went to war with Steve over it.  He learns about clone Thor and Bill Foster and the anti-registration side’s surrender, and then he learns about the day Steve Rogers was murdered with tomato on his face and power-dampening shackles around his wrists.
Hmm.  Well, Tony was always up for a good fight.  Of course, most of his fights were in well-lit, open spaces.  Or just
It seemed like he was safe for the time being.  At what cost, though? Had he made things worse for Tony?  And yet - what else could he have possibly done, just listen and do nothing?
He'd been clearing the debris for maybe ten minutes when a whistling sound echoed through the tunnel, and Steve blinked, realizing Tony had started up the train.  "Steve?" he heard.
“Okay.”  Steve doesn’t say anything for a moment, blue eyes drifting, and then he reaches up, fingers brushing against the edges of Tony’s goatee.  “I want m-more time with you,” he says.
they were captive, Steve didn't want to know—now on the loose.  He threw aside the last piece of the chair he'd been tied to, then took off running back toward the room he'd woken up in, away from the biters he could hear from somewhere behind him.  Once there, he flung both his and Tony's packs over his shoulder, hoisting his shield.  He was on his way out when he caught sight of Maya, still out cold against the ground, and despite everything, he paused—she was the one who had done this to him, but… he couldn't just leave her here for the biters to devour.
Rogers just sighed at this, turning away into one of the igloo-things.  He had to hunch over to get inside, which was, honestly, an image Tony had to snigger at.  Whoever used to live here must have been pretty short.  “Are you going to mope now?” Tony asked his retreating figure.
"Sergeant," Fury replied as he nodded back.  "I couldn't help but overhear the tail end of your conversation."
"I want you to remove the body, yes," Tony said.  "And check the rest of the ship.  Make sure they didn't leave any surprises for us."
That was some pretty obvious deflecting, but Tony decided to let it go.  He was starting to get the irritating feeling that there would be a lot of letting things go where Cap was involved.  "Okay," he said, even though it would have been more expedient to have the others here as well, but Pepper and Rhodey were already sleeping.  "Well, we won't be able to form a detailed plan until we actually get there and see what it's like for ourselves.  The area as a whole is occupied by the Japanese, but the specific area we're interested in is an evacuated dig site, not a populated town.  There isn't much reason for anyone to be there, Chinese, Japanese, or otherwise."
Tony joined him a moment later, having retrieved his shovel—he'd left it behind since it was too much to hold on to during a supply run.  "Oh, darling, am I glad to be reunited with you," he said, pressing a kiss to the handle.
had happened.  There was evidence.  And come to think of it - maybe this explained some other things, like Ty's taunting before practice and the fact that none of his things were in the right place.
Natasha lowered her hands, seeming to relax a little now that they were listening to her.  "I was in a group of three, myself included," she said.  "One of them left several days ago to forage for more supplies south from here.  He hasn't come back."
- Tony wondered if either of his parents had a connection to the military.  The dad had passed away, so it was within the realm of possibility. It wasn't something Tony could exactly ask about, though, not if he wanted to avoid rousing her suspicion.  "I want to say that you shouldn't let things like this ruin your relationships with other people, but how can I, when you're standing up for what you believe in?"
"Relax," Maya interrupted.  "Sorry.  I misspoke.  I'm just trying to say—the world's gone to shit, and we need to find a way to fix it without having to go through a load of red tape, because that takes time we don't have.  That's what I'm glad for."
Curious now, Tony opened the sketchbook up, only to be greeted by a horrendous mess of scribbles.  It sort of looked like drawings on top of drawings on top of drawings, but there were so many of them that it was hard to tell what any of them were at this point.  "It's abstract art," he managed, just so he had something to say. "You're not supposed to tell what it's supposed to be."
Rogers opened his mouth, like he wanted to ask some more questions, but thankfully he seemed to eventually decide that keeping quiet would be best, instead just nodding and turning around.  “We should be able to find our way back to the entrance,” he said.  “I’ve been keeping track, but it’ll probably take us all day to get out, if not longer.”  Tony just shrugged, and Rogers turned to face him, frowning again.  “You’re going to be okay, right?”
But his lack of reaction then kind of reminded him of Steve's lack of reaction now.  And if, God forbid, Mom died, Tony knew he wouldn't be able to cry whether Dad was there or not, because Stark men didn't cry; they were made of iron.  And he also knew that not using that outlet would probably screw him up in the long run, but, well, here he was.
Tony leans down, and it looks like he’s about to just bury his face in his crotch when he pauses, glancing back up at him.  “You’re okay with this, right?  Getting naked?  Doing the horizontal tango with me?”
Groaning, he tried to push himself onto his feet, but his body refused to listen.  With no better options, he started crawling instead, which at least had the benefit of keeping him below the smoke.  Maybe Jarvis was near the front.  Maybe there was still a chance for Tony to fix his mistake.  Maybe, maybe, maybe.
He’s placed on strict bed rest then, and the doctor gives him a few pills of Aspirin with accompanying instructions to not go anywhere.  So as soon as Tony’s left alone, he gets up, ignoring the Aspirin and heading outside toward the rail, a blanket wrapped tight around his body as he gazes out over the water.
"That's ridiculous," Steve said, flushing a little.  He'd done no more or less than the rest of them!
Rogers shook his head, uncapping an antibacterial ointment and starting to rub it over the injured area.  “I’m just doing my duty,” he said.  His gaze flickered up toward him as he managed the faintest of smiles.  “Glad you didn’t ditch me yet?”
“There’s something under here,” he announced sometime past noon, stopping in the middle of an unremarkable grove.
Cap chose that moment to turn away, and even though Tony could see that he was getting a wet cloth, it still felt very purposeful.  "I… I heard you.  That first night.  I have very good hearing."
," Fury replied.  "It's your job to get the other pieces—however many there are—and put this back together before the Nazis do.  We got this piece by luck, and they don't know we have it yet.  I want to keep our advantage for as long as we can."
"Oh, thank God," she said.  There was another sniffle.  "We were so worried.  Can… can you open your eyes?"
"Sounds like a plan."  Luke clapped Tony on the shoulder.  "Thank you both, man.  You probably saved our girl's life.  We won't forget that."
“Because I’m looking for something too.”  And Tony would just as rather do this all alone, but Fury was providing the means—and with his time running out, he could hardly afford to snub him.
Huh.  He hadn’t expected Rogers to have any experience with magic, much less be able to identify it—but then again, he’d heard of some weird stuff happening during the war.  Well, it didn’t matter.  Tony rolled his eyes, waving one hand.  “You probably don’t trust anything that wasn’t made in America.  I’m going to pick it up.”
Tony can’t hold back anymore.  Wordlessly, he throws himself forward, wrapping his arms tight around Steve as he kisses him for all he’s worth—and Ty, Sunset, Howard,
"It was always going to happen," Tony said gently.  He withdrew one hand, bringing his bag closer instead.  Steve watched as he rummaged around, pulling some papers out.  "Listen to me," he said.  "This next part is very important.  Do you remember these?"
Tony's eyes seemed wet again.  For several moments, he didn't move, and Steve feared that it was over, wondering if he should just give up.
This was probably the end, but for some reason, all Tony could think about was extending his pinky finger to Steve and swearing to him that he wouldn’t drop dead.  That was a stupid promise, he thought to himself.  Steve was going to be so disappointed once he went back to normal.
"We can check," Cap sad.  He brought the piece out again and pushed it around on his palm, but it didn't do anything of interest.
Steve just had to charge at him once more.  Hissing in pain, Tony hauled his ass out of Steve’s way, firing at him again—he hated to do it, but if Steve was anything like that other sabretooth they’d fought, it’d just be an annoyance at worst.
Tony groans and shakes his head, trying to clear it.  He knows why.  “Ricochet,” he explains weakly, trying to pull away and wincing again when that just results in more pain.  How bad is it?  He can barely tell.  There’s blood starting to stain his lifebelt, up near his shoulder—at least it didn’t hit his chest.  And it’s not gushing, either.  Small victories.  “I-I don’t think it hit anything important.  It’ll be okay, Steve.  We have to get out of here.”
that will make some noise.  His eyes land on the officer he’d seen earlier, whistle still in his mouth, and he feels himself swallow.  He can’t stay here with Steve, he realizes.  He has to leave him.
Pepper scrubbed at her eyes with one hand and nodded.  "I guess," she said.  "Make sure Tony doesn't get up and do things.  He'll try that."
When Steve came barreling toward him, Tony started running forward as well, leaping up and grabbing hold of a branch above him, even though it made his injured arm feel like it was being ripped right off his shoulder.  With that, he managed to swing up over Steve, letting go and landing right on him, though he was facing the wrong way.
"If the crossbows are along the walls, I could use the shield to disable them from a distance," Cap suggested.
Steve shrugged and put a peach slice in his mouth.  "If she's sincere, then weakening us is the last thing she needs."
Cap blinked at him a few times, then seemed to remember what he was doing, cutting the piece of gauze off and taping the end together.  "Oh," he said.  "Thanks, Mr. Stark.  Um.  Tony."
Tony shook his head quickly.  "I'm sorry, Steve," he said.  "It's just—she said most of the people here are scientists.  I've lived the last five years—"
"And then I remembered the other thing you wrote.  'Don't go.' So I put two and two together and I guess I figured out, kind of, what was gonna happen, which I'm assuming is why you didn't want me to go.  But obviously you can see I went, and - and maybe you're upset that I did; I don't know. So I wanted to explain why I went, and why I'm still there even after I realized what'll probably happen to me."
Tony almost, almost felt bad about this, but ultimately it was inconsequential.  Rogers didn’t need to know about his ailing heart, and Tony didn’t
himself that he didn’t care about words or soulmates or any of that stuff anymore.  Usually, he doesn’t.  Usually, he has more important things to think of, like saving the world or helping Steve retrieve his shield when it gets lost in the Atlantic Ocean.  But Hank and Jan get married.  Pepper and Happy get married.  Fellow Avengers Justice and Firestar get engaged and leave the team.
He shifted the light to the left, following the progression of drawings.  First two human-looking stick figures, then a human and a sabretooth.  Then a sunrise, an arrow, and a sunset, repeated three times.  Then a tall mountain, then the human and the sabretooth standing at the top, and then two humans standing on the top.
"Ma'am," he managed, holding her at bay as gently as he could, wincing when he saw skin strain and start to tear, "please, I'm here to help!"
It was when they were leaving Milford, Connecticut—or at least, what once was Milford, and was now a silent memorial of deserted apartments and crumbling office buildings like so many others—that they finally encountered one of the herds Steve had heard of, but never seen for himself.
Come to think of it, Tony did feel kind of woozy, but staying put was boring.  They still had a lot of exploring to do.  “I don’t want another giant mutant cat with skin of steel to attack us while we’re here.”
That wasn't a particularly pleasant thought, but it wasn't as though Steve hadn't had to make do without running water during the war.  "Which way we headed?" he asked.
Cap had stepped back, his hands trembling a little.  Tony watched him take a deep breath.  "Yeah," he said.  "Should we go?"
Tony snorted.  He had to admire Cap being so upfront.  "Well, let me know when you plan on rebelling."  He yawned then, standing up and sticking his hands in his pockets.  It was day one of their mission, and there was something he still had to take care of.  "For now, I'm going to bed.  Good night, Cap."
“You met me while I was in the middle of trying to get away from it all,” Tony replies.  “That’s… the opposite of being brave.  Or smart.”
"Then get over here," Tony said, gripping at the edge of the airship with one hand and leaning as far out as he could, arm extended.  "Come on!"
"Hard to say," Tony replied, eyes focused on the needle.  "This isn't a small building.  Honestly, I'm more worried that there are a bunch of biters locked away somewhere nearby.  Hospitals were one of the starting points for the epidemic.  People would flood these places at the beginning, looking for help, and then they'd all turn."
Tony blinked slowly at Cap, not sure how to reply to that.  "Well," he said at last.  "Yeah.  You're important."
That was enough for Tony.  Without further ado, he slithered down the rope, keeping his eyes and ears peeled for anything suspicious, but besides the light coming in from above and the shadow from Rogers’ head on him, there wasn’t much to see.  Not too long after, his feet touched the ground, and he felt around blindly for a moment, making sure everything seemed solid.  “I’m in,” he called, bringing out his flashlight and shining it up at Rogers.  “Can you see me?”
But Steve kept talking over him.  He was done listening. "I don't know anything about you except that you like to yell a lot.  And I'm not like that. I - I act like I don't listen sometimes. But I do listen. And I innovate and invent and I help when I can - "
Tony frowned and looked down.  He had an injury there?  His arm wound ached so much, he was barely aware of anything else going on with his body.  "I'm fine," he said, because if he couldn't really tell it existed, then there was no need to bother anyone about it.
"If I doubt myself, why wouldn't I doubt everyone else?" Tony asked before immediately regretting it.  The fact that he'd had a lot of doubts about himself since the war started was probably not a thing he wanted to broadcast, especially not to someone who was in close contact with Fury.
me you and Iron Man were the same,” he huffs once they’re back at the mansion.  Tony throws up his hands, listens to a few lectures about trust, and eventually things return back to normal between them, but it’s funny.  Once his closely-guarded secret is out to Steve, he feels better, not worse, and somehow their relationship gets even better once Steve knows the truth.
“It’s a repulsor blast,” Tony corrected, promptly coughing up some blood immediately afterward.  God, it tasted awful.  “Not… not a beam of light.”
"Damn right I have."  Tony carefully made his way to the thing that had nearly went through Cap's head, pulling a pair of gloves out of a pocket and sliding them on before picking the item up.  "It's an arrow," he said, the light of his flashlight sweeping along the far wall.  "Some of the tiles on the floor must be triggering… I don't know.  Crossbows, I guess?  There's almost certainly more than one of these lying in wait."
“That means there are creatures capable of written language here,” Tony said.  “There’s a difference.  Anyway, I don’t think it matters.  I’m not picking up on anything of significant mass that seems to be alive below us, so even if there were people here once, they’re gone now.”  But if they’d ever owned anything magical… then maybe that was still here.
"I mean there are people out there who will take everything you have if you give them half a chance," Tony said.  "They come in with a wounded gazelle gambit to get you to lower your guard, and then they turn into a damned lion."
He holds the gun to his chest for a moment, breathing hard as he stares into space.  He’s running out of time, and this is the best he’s got.  It’s going to have to be enough.  Accepting this, he heads back into the hall, looking down it—and then he freezes.  Jesus Christ.  In the time it’s taken for him to find this one hope, the hallway looks nearly flooded.  It’s unsettlingly dark near the end, and one of the lights is flickering irregularly.  It’d send chills up his spine, if his spine wasn’t already currently soaking in freezing water.  As bad as things look right now though, he doesn’t have a choice.  He needs to get to Steve before it’s too late.
Tony blinks at him a few times, not sure why he looks confused—and then it hits him.  “I—no—God, Steve, I’m not going to shoot you!” he says.  “Here, get your hands wet; it’ll make the metal more brittle—”  Steve complies, and Tony continues, “I-I’m going to shoot the chain.  Ideally.”
There were several more images of that first man, and Steve looked at them all, unsure what to make of it.  He could only assume they were recruitment materials from the Great War, but it was just… a strange thing to find inside Tony's contraption.
"You tried to kill us," Cap snarled.  "More than once.  Give me what I'm looking for and I won't try and immediately return the favor."
Sunset, meanwhile, snakes up to Tony, leaning forward to whisper into his ear.  “Maybe he took it while you were getting dressed again.”
"I don't kiss and run," Steve said, lips quirking.  "And anyway, maybe I could search for my own friends at the same time."
But Steve just gives him a smile, that same dazzling, determined smile that’s sent Tony charging into battle a million times in years past.  “You’re going to get through this,” he says.  “You’re an Avenger, whether or not we’ve disbanded.  And I know—I
Ten years ago, Stark had designed a weapon unlike any other, one that had the potential to kill more people at once than all the fire bombings they'd had up to that point combined.  Ten years ago, Steve had decided he could no longer listen to Stark's justifications, and their relationship, and everything that came with it—the stolen kisses, the quiet pleas to be careful, be safe, the secret smiles exchanged when in the company of others—ended.
And Rumiko—his beautiful, passionate, temperamental Rumiko who was, if not with him, at least across the Pacific and out of harm’s way—
That… is just about the saddest thing Steve’s ever heard, so he reaches up, placing his hand against Tony’s shoulder.  “Everyone deserves to have a voice.”
After some time, the tunnel seemed to widen, and Tony realized they were standing at the edge of… of something.  Something magnificent.  “Rogers,” he breathed.
Tony stared at his feet again.  "…Well, I had nightmares for months after that.  I still do, sometimes, when I'm not dreaming about the biters instead.  Can you imagine, Steve?  Having everything you are taken away from you?  The thought terrified me.  It still does.  I'd rather die than let that happen."  He scuffed one foot on the ground, continuing, "And I think the reason I was so afraid was because I knew… Hydra had that power.  They could do this.  They did it to my
“This is none of your business,” Tony said.  He quickly scarfed down the last of the chicken and rice, polishing it off with a final gulp of coffee.  This stuff was truly awful.  “And I want to keep going, so we’re going to keep going.  End of story.”
.  And though he knew intellectually that this would happen, that Steve would somehow go from the scrawny kid he'd known to the living legend playing out before him… well, it was one thing to think it and wholly another to actually see him in action.
the third time, because he heard an answering cry, which was good, but not good enough.  "Cap?" he called as he held his sleeve to his face in a vain attempt to breathe in less of whatever was around him right now.  "Rhodey?  Pepper?"
“Charmed,” Sunset replies dryly.  Tony can see Steve open his mouth to acknowledge her in return, but she’s already looking away again, talking over him.  “Your father has been looking for you.  He wants to talk about the merger before we reach New York.”
?" he said.  It hadn't been doing this before; he was sure of it.  But it was hard to deny what he was seeing right now.
The other man laughed; Tony could feel the hairs on the back of his neck prickle in response.  "I'm calling you on your bluff," said the man.  "
"No," Cap said.  His hand dropped down to his side abruptly, and he continued, "Ms. Potts and Mr. Rhodes are probably ready now.  We should join them."
He doesn’t realize anyone’s nearby until a crutch comes out of nowhere and prods him in the back.  “What—” he manages, and while he doesn’t
the right answer, but Steve figured it was better than trying to guess for real and getting it wrong.
not when you were acting completely on impulse, just so damn glad to see him alive again that kissing was the only thing you could think to do.
," came Steve's voice, sounding oddly disembodied.  Tony was doing nothing but sitting here, and yet he could feel his heart start to pound uncomfortably fast.  "
Tony makes a sound suspiciously close to a purr as Steve touches him, leaning forward into his hand.  Steve is enthralled.  “I did, in fact,” he murmurs.  Then he pulls away, much to Steve’s disappointment, though he makes up for it by taking his hand.  “Come here.  Let me show you something.”  He leads them to a small safe, inputting the combination and opening it before pulling out two small boxes.  “As you know, I’m getting married.  Presumably.  This is supposed to involve exchanging rings and such.”  He holds up one box.  “I got this for her.  It has a blue stone because her name is Sunset and it doesn’t match at all, which is petty but I don’t really care.  Probably looks better on you, actually.”  Steve snorts, and Tony grins, taking the ring out and dropping it into the pocket of his pants.  “But she won’t be needing this anymore.  Meanwhile, she got me this beauty.  Just take a look.”
The most pressing thing, he supposed, was the light filtering into the room.  He found that as soon as he opened his eyes, he was practically blinded, and so he was forced to close them again, placing a hand over his face as he groaned.  Light sensitivity. Definitely not something he'd experienced before.
.  For being there for him, for changing his life, for opening his eyes.  For showing him that he has a life worth living, because Steve is in it, and because—because Tony loves him.
There was another explosion, followed by the sounds of shuffling getting louder and louder—the biters were coming back down the stairs, and Steve was only a few feet away from the staircase.
"I already said you could," Cap replied, sounding overly patient.  "Have some faith in me."  He brought Tony's pack over, opening it up and showing Tony what was inside.  "Look.  Mr. Jarvis showed me how to recharge the gauntlet."
worth bringing up was how Steve felt about Tony, about how great and smart and kind he was, and how Steve was glad that of all the people he could have somehow switched bodies with, it was Tony.  Despite all their differences, Steve had grown to like him and he was proud to call him a friend, and he hoped that Tony would never change.
Rogers nodded again, and so they set off, with Rogers leading because Tony honestly had no clue where they were going.  Multiple times along the way, though, he had to call out to Rogers, telling him to slow down because he was going far too fast, which was honestly getting to be supremely annoying.  After an hour of this, Rogers evidently felt the same way, turning at his shout and glaring at him.
"Wait, what?" Cap replied, his hands going still for a moment.  "No.  I mean—"  He took a deep breath, then went back to rolling the gauze.  "Look, when those things came out… for a while, the promise of a new issue was what kept me going.  Things were bleak.  I was eating boiled cabbage and mayonnaise sandwiches.  But then I'd read
how much Stark loved that suit, so why would he just toss it aside because of some noise?—but he decided not to press.  He supposed it didn't really matter, anyway.  Stark didn't have his suit, and that was the end of it.  "What about your heart?"
As always, though, all he brought was himself.  He supposed the least he could offer was to help Steve out, so he went about doing just that.  Perhaps having anticipated a possible switch, Steve had clearly labeled everything, so Tony didn't need to figure out on his own what was needed of him.  There wasn't all that much left in the house at this point - Ma's room, in fact, was completely empty, and the sight of it bothered him enough that he shut the door so he wouldn't have to look in there anymore - and Tony quietly lugged what little remained into the trash for disposal, taking frequent breaks whenever breathing got too hard.
So up they went.  Around noon, they found another pond and stopped to rest, Tony sliding right off of Steve and flopping over onto the grass.  “Sore,” he croaked, pulling both packs off of Steve and reaching into one to grab a bottle of water.  Seriously, riding bareback on a damn sabretooth was never going to be comfortable, no matter how much he did it.
Steve was using his official Captain America voice.  Tony hadn't known the man for very long, but he had a feel for the Cap voice now.  It was hard to argue against it.
Tony frowned a little.  "Those regulations exist to prevent the things from happening during the war from being repeated."
Rogers sighed and tilted his head back, leaning against the wall.  “I didn’t want to bring this up,” he began, and somehow Tony knew what was coming back.  “But I looked at your… metal chest plate thing.  While I was bandaging you.  And the display said 22%.  I’m assuming something bad happens if it gets to zero, right?”
"We don't doubt it," Luke replied.  "But the thing is, two grown men ain't going to be carrying around baby formula, are they?"
Carefully, he reached in, pulling the notepad out.  Knowing Steve, it was probably filled with boring notes about the flora and fauna and whatever else they were supposed to be taking notes on, and sure enough, the first half of the notepad didn’t disappoint.  But since Steve was still moping and Tony was still bored—since, after all, boring notes on stuff he’d already seen were
Tony sure is nosy.  “We kissed once.  But then I wanted to leave, and she wanted to stay.  Paris is her home.”  He smiles a little wistfully, remembering her.  He hasn’t thought about Peggy in a while.  “She was really something.  Brave.  Smart.”  His gaze shifts back to Tony, though, and he continues, “But I don’t think I regret making the decision to go back to America.”
Steve is shy, apparently.  Well, that’s fine.  Tony makes a big show of turning away, putting back the clothes he’d pulled out of the armoire—but as soon as he hears the sounds of Steve taking his clothes off, he pokes his head out and stares.  God.  Steve’s back is extraordinary, and Tony can’t help but watch his muscles ripple as the other man strips down.  Nngh.  He suspects that he’s been building up to this ever since he first laid eyes on him, but now he knows for
Without thinking, Steve sprung into action—"Don't!" he cried, and he shoved Tony out of the room, slamming the door shut and jamming it with a piece of furniture and his shield.  Vaguely, he was aware of a cry of protest, but he put it out of mind.  He instead turned back to Bucky, who was slowly walking toward him.  "I thought you were dead," he breathed.
They have their first fight as a couple when Steve comes back from Bucky-hunting in London and finds that Tony’s shot himself up with Extremis.
stomach was still full of raw, possibly-not-entirely-digested deer, no matter how gross that seemed.
Realizing he was staring, Tony quickly looked back down at his own sad pack of beans before Rogers could catch him, picking up a fork and beginning to chow down.  Aside from the sound of Rogers’ chewing, which Tony had to admit was kind of obscenely loud, they ate in silence—Rogers, obviously, was in no state to talk, and Tony didn’t really have anything to say.  When they were done, he packed up all their things, frowning disapprovingly at Rogers’ bowl.  “Ew,” he said.  “Sabretooth slobber.”
No longer hungry, Tony pushed his food away and stood up, mind racing.  If it was supposed to happen today, then maybe his original instinct to run away as far as he could would work.  Even if Steve came back the next day, history would have been changed, right? And maybe the simple act of not being available
Steve glanced back at Tony.  It was hard to tell in the dark—they hadn't lit a fire—but he thought Tony looked tired, too.  "Let's sleep," he said.
He stared at it.  What had happened?  How was this even possible?  Curiously, he dug the gem out of the socket to see what would happen, then promptly convulsed and gasped for breath, hurriedly jamming it back a moment later as he tried not to panic.
"Okay," Steve said.  "And what about the other person, the one you want us to find?  'South' isn't enough to go on."
“Steve,” he says, and he turns a little, wincing again as he agitates his arm.  God, it’s so fucking cold, and yet his arm is the opposite of numb.  Sometime between getting the hell off the ship and onto the raft, it seems like his wound has opened again, the tablecloth Steve had wrapped around him earlier turning red.  Not much he can do about it now, though.  “I-I think I liked lying in the c-c-car with you more.”
"Could be something irrelevant," Tony said, following his gaze.  "Turkey's neutral.  No combat here."
Every now and then, he checked his power detector to see if maybe, just maybe, it was picking up on anything.  But since they’d dropped down into the hole, it’d been behaving strangely—whether it was because they were underground now or because of something else, Tony didn’t know.  Hopefully it was because of something else.  Something magical.  But time would tell.
"He's got everything," Luke said.  "I've seen the storage rooms.  We were gonna break in and get what we needed."
.  After all, Steve was supposed to be their note taker, but he was hardly in any state to write down anything now, and how else was Fury supposed to know what they were seeing if Tony didn’t record it?  Imagine that, he thought.  Steve was rubbing off on him.
"What are you trying to say?" Steve asked, his eyes squeezing shut.  He wasn't sure if he'd actually accepted any of this yet.  He didn't think he had.  "You've been dying this whole time?"
Steve tilted his head ever so slightly, and the light his hair caught in that movement made him look like an angel.  "Shouldn't I get to decide that myself?" he said.
"You kidding?  I went there all the time as a kid," Steve said, reminiscing.  "I used to imagine that I was an officer on one of those ships.  Not that the Navy was my goal, but the ships were right here…"
Before he could say more, there was a sudden movement; one of the previously-still biters on the ground lunged toward Stark, who let out a surprised sound, kicking it away and stumbling backward.  Steve quickly threw his shield to break the biter's legs at the same time Jessica swiped at it, missing the first time but hitting her mark on a second try, twisting the knife hard.
Steve gives him a small smile, though it fades away as he speaks again.  “I hate that you did something so dangerous to yourself—”
"It's the truth," Tony insisted.  "But I guess you're in luck.  No one's going to be reading any history books for a while, I'm thinking."
"This was an important mission," Cap muttered, but there was no heat behind his words, and that blush was still there.  It was kind of adorable.  "And you shouldn't look so amused.  It's antiseptic next."
Which meant, Tony supposed, that he actually had all the tools he needed to make sure it never happened again.  After all, didn't Tesla mostly operate on naps? Tony thought that with a few lifestyle tweaks, he could get there as well, and then he would be free of this bizarreness.
Abruptly, the two of them jolted forward, Tony grabbing onto the control panel to remain steady as Cap held onto him for the same reason.  The sound of the bottom of the airship scraping the ground was so deep he could feel it in his bones, his teeth chattering as the vibrations made their way through his body.  From behind him, Cap let out a soft grunt, but made no other sound.
What on earth is going on?  Has Tony already died, only to wake up in some sort of limbo where people care about him for some reason?  “I… think the fall alone would kill me,” he manages, still trying to wrap his head around the mystery that is this handsome stranger.  “It won’t be cold.  It’ll be like… it’ll be like flying.”  He’s always wanted to fly.  Maybe not when the end result is breaking his neck upon impact in the freezing waters below, but he figures it’s better than never flying at all.
Tony glanced at him.  He looked better than he had yesterday, though he was still a little pale.  "I know what you're thinking," he said.  "You want to see how different things are now.  Don't do it, Steve.  Remember your home the way it was."
Instead, he tried to focus on what was here.  He put his bag down, and then went over to his sketchbooks, which were sitting out on his desk - usually he just shoved them under his bed so that he could easily reach them from his bed without having to get up.  With growing apprehension, he picked up the top one and started to flip through it. What was he going to find, he wondered? Would pages be missing, crumpled, or scribbled over? It had, after all, happened before.
"Let's see," he said as he opened up the folder with all the mission details that he'd been given.  "British air base, it says here. Something about guarding some sort of experimental plane from Nazi spies."
Steve opens his mouth to speak before quickly shutting it, rubbing his forehead.  “I’m shouting again,” he mutters, taking a deep breath.  “Okay.  It happened and there’s no going back now.  I just…”  He sighs, and when he looks back at Tony, his eyes are sad.  “I don’t understand what you did to yourself.  And I’m not really sure I like it.  I’m scared that this is going to hurt you somehow, and… I think that maybe we need a break.”
"Yes," Tony said.  "But more importantly, they were the base of a formula that could be injected into a person, which… destroyed them from the inside.  It didn't turn them into biters, but it… reprogrammed them.  They kept their knowledge, but they lost all of their identity."
He also found a large room with multiple cars and motorcycles inside, all of which seemed to belong to Tony based on the decor of the room - boards with technical-looking drawings not unlike the ones Steve had found in Tony's notes, posters for what were probably the latest movies of Tony's (including one for
"Yeah, you trying to convince me it's Monday again is really sad," Ty agreed.  "Let me see this." Before Tony could say another word, Ty had snatched up his backpack from where it had been sitting on the floor, opening it up.  "Oh, wow," he continued, bringing out Tony's copy of
some boarding-school slang he didn't know?  Why was the state of Indiana involved in this?  Who were the twins?
Rogers took a few steps in, his frown evident in the glow of their flashlights.  “What happened?” he asked.  “Where’s the glowing thing?”
There was a pause, and Steve was terrified that Tony wouldn't get moving, that he was leaving the train.  Finally, though, he shouted back, "But you're in there!"
That was what she'd yelled when they'd first come in, Steve remembered.  But… "Everyone else here has turned," he said.  "Are you sure you're not just hurt from something else?"
"Don't," Carol snapped.  "It's Burnside's damned fault.  You're not the one who poured concrete on the windows.  I'd help you escape again if I had to."
Steve’s eyes widen as he sputters uselessly, and right on cue, that charming blush stains his cheeks again.  “I—what—”
will especially always be needed.  You were our beacon of hope during the war.  I think you still are for a lot of people, even if almost everyone in this country believes you're dead.  And third, what am I, chopped liver?"
They stopped for the night in a small cave, where Rogers set up a little fire and started to look through a notepad he was carrying.  Unsurprisingly, he’d taken notes about the various fauna and animals and such they’d seen today, which Tony hadn’t thought to do.  Well, whatever.  His memory was good enough, and if Rogers was doing it, why did Tony need to?
Cap picked up a dressing pad, staring very hard at it as he laid it over the gunshot wound.  That thing was probably going to leave a scar, Tony couldn't help but think.  "
But Rogers, damn him, was still looking at him expectantly, and Tony groaned, rubbing his forehead.  He… he
“Spill it,” Tony demands, ignoring her sarcasm because he can tell she’s still hiding something.  “You’re plotting something.”
“Steve!”  Steeling himself, Tony manages to swim in the direction of the voice, nearly sobbing when his eyes land on Steve, who apparently managed to emerge beyond most of the other people, far away from the ship.  One hand is above water, grasping tightly onto the makeshift raft Tony had built for them—thank God one of them had managed to hold onto it.  “Oh, God, Steve,” he breathes, going over to him and reaching up to touch one freezing hand to his face, making sure he’s really here.  “A-are you alright?”
Tony never even got to thank him.  Not for pulling him back over the edge the other night; he vaguely remembers thanking him then.  But for
For obvious reasons, Tony had chosen not to dwell on this part of Cap's story.  It was history. It had already happened, and there was nothing he could do about it, so why not just ignore it and think about all the other wonderful things about him?
“Do you know,” she hisses, “what an honor it was to be a part of Steve’s life?  He gave me that honor even though we both knew my words weren’t for him.  And then we broke up and he gave you that honor, and I was happy for him because he was happy.  But you wasted it.  You wasted it!  You killed him!”
.  There’s a wad of cash sticking out of his pocket, and everything becomes clear.  Fuck.  Howard is, of course, the type to make his own luck.  “Come on, Steve—” he begins, starting to tug the other man away, not wanting to watch this, but then Howard’s gaze snaps up, and suddenly they lock eyes, Tony’s throat going dry again.
Tony shrugged.  "Well, we're going after this because the Nazis want it, right?  But as far as I can tell, it doesn't do much aside from act like a magnet even though it looks like a rock.  But maybe you've experienced otherwise."  He wasn't sure if this was a safe topic or not.  Cap thus far had made no comments on his affinity for it, despite it being pretty clear to at least Rhodey and himself, and Tony wasn't sure why.  He thought again of the pages of blacked-out text and wondered if he'd understand better if he'd known what it said.
"We're a little further north from where I'd expect it to be found," Rhodey replied.  "Still figuring out if that's noteworthy or not.  But it's native to the country, yes."
In silence, the three of them stood, Steve taking point this time as they approached the building and made their way to the closest window.  From behind him, Jessica whispered, "There's something on the edges that wasn't there when we left."
?  God, he didn't want to think about what Dad would say about that.  His only comfort was that Dad probably didn't care enough to actually look at what he was taking, so he'd probably never even find out.
When Steve goes underground, Tony doesn’t even hear about it until minutes after the fact—which, given that he has Extremis, is completely unacceptable.  By the time he’s able to head out and look for him, Steve is long gone.
“But not exactly just as bad,” Tony replied, clapping him on the back.  “Semantics is everything.  Relax, Steve.  I’m alive and you are refreshingly human.  We should be celebrating, really.  Know if this airship has a bar?”
Tony didn't reply.  Instead, a few minutes passed, and Steve heard the soft sounds of snoring—it seemed as though he'd fallen asleep.  Steve decided to follow suit, praying to himself as he drifted off that it would be okay if he trusted Tony Stark again.
"Natasha has him," Tony said gently.  "I… told her about him and you.  She said she didn't know anything about his past, and that he'd trained her as a spy…"  He trailed off, shaking his head.  "I don't think we'll ever know what happened to Bucky or how the hell he apparently ended up working for the Soviets.  I can't imagine he did it willingly.  But… he found happiness, at least.  With Natasha."
“I’m not pretending.”  Very slowly, the man inches closer so that he’s leaning against the rail as well, turning his head to look at him.
What had Steve written in his journal again?  He was going to help out a doctor, and once that was done…
Once he'd regained his breath, he picked up his lunch bucket and continued on home.  At least Dougie had beat him up early on today - it meant that Steve didn't have to keep an eye out for the rest of the way back, since Dougie was content limiting himself to just once a day (except on Fridays, then it was twice).  The worst was when he was practically at his doorstep, only for Dougie to burst out from his own home two doors down to ambush him.
Steve whipped his head around to look at him, and Tony found himself involuntarily stepping back, automatically bringing his gauntlets up.  It was just—for a moment, he’d seemed dangerous.  Like an actual sabretooth.  But then the look faded, and a puzzled expression took its place.
Cap reached up, his hand against the cowl that covered most of his face.  There was a moment of hesitation, but then he moved his hand, pushing the cowl off to reveal messy blond hair to go with the blue, blue eyes.  "My name is Steve," he said.
Sunset makes a sound of disgust.  It really is a shame they can’t get along better, he thinks.  She’s not afraid to speak her mind in front of him.  Unfortunately, he really can’t get behind the stuff going on in her head.  “I don’t want you to see him again.”
“Steve…”  Everything in Tony wants to say yes, especially the part of his mind that can’t even remember the relationship going to hell between the two of them, the part of his mind that loves Steve more than anything.  But just because he can’t remember doesn’t mean he doesn’t
He seems to be referencing something, but Tony doesn’t know what.  It doesn’t matter.  None of that matters because now they’re kissing, and just like that, Tony knows with exquisite clarity that the words he’s carried on his wrist for his entire life are for no one else but Steve Rogers, and he knows with equal certainty that if he were to look at Steve’s wrist at this very moment, he’d see his own handwriting looking back at him.
"Yeah," Tony repeated, grateful to have a chance to do something.  "Get out safe, okay?"  Without waiting for an answer, he made his way toward the nearest pillar, keeping his head low.  There was still smoke and the sound of bullet fire all around, and he couldn't help but worry about Pepper—but Rhodey was a sitting duck while he was in that pit, and Tony needed to get him out as soon as possible.
Cap took a deep breath, gaze flickering away for a moment before he looked back at Tony.  "They're… far.  But I think they're alive.  Their transceivers were still sending signals, but the distance became too great and they dropped off."
The days passed without too much incident, the two of them trekking quietly through snow-covered roads that had long since been abandoned and walking past that buildings nature was slowly beginning to reclaim.  There were bodies—several of them—that they passed by, with Stark jabbing the heads of any that were close enough with an ice pick.  "I'm not risking getting ambushed," he'd explained, and Steve supposed he understood.
"Well, I'm sure with you around I'll stay in one piece," Tony said.  He swung his off the bed and managed to stand.  At least his legs were fine.  "Anything we gotta do before we go?  Pay?"
surprisingly, she doesn’t look very happy.  “We’ve been looking for you,” she says as she falls into step behind them, jabbing Tony in the back.
plan of action, but with twenty-nine seconds left, it would have been nice if he picked up the pace.
Tony turns to stare up at the stars and entertains the possibility that the both of them will die tonight.  “It’s g-getting quiet,” he says, and his voice is as thin as a reed.
looking as though he were going to wet himself.  "Getting him killed is the last thing I want.  But you know as well as I do—better, probably—that he's not going to stay here if he doesn't want to."  His lips twitched.  "I've seen it enough in
with you.  And… I don’t want to be on a break anymore, Tony.  After what happened, and after thinking about what we do… you’re right.  We get into dangerous situations all the time, and life’s too short to get upset over that.  I’d rather spend my time being happy.  With you, if you’ll have me back.”
“I’m worried about you,” Rhodey tells him over the phone one day, and the tone of his voice makes it sound like he’s plotting to fly in from Camp Hammond to ambush Tony and make sure he’s doing alright any second now.
.  And now, to have lost him, to just as well have Steve’s blood on his hands, to have paid the cost of a working heart with Steve’s life…
Steve glanced at the body Jessica had been kneeling at—Peter's?—and headed for the door.  "I'll go first," he said, pausing once he was in front of it to listen.  He could still hear the moaning of the remaining biters from all around, but he didn't think any of the sounds were coming from inside.  If someone was in there, they were being very quiet.  Carefully, he tried opening the door, but apparently it was locked from inside, because it didn't give.  "Stand back," he told them, and then he kicked the door open.
Cap looked up and met his gaze, his lips parted in—shock?— and then a loud explosion from above rocked the ship.
“Oh,” Steve says, quickly packing up his materials.  “Sure.”  He stands up, following Tony as he begins to walk around the deck.  “What did you wanna talk about?”
Steve could have done without the sarcasm, but Tony was right.  Things weren't looking good.  If it was just him, he would have broken one of the windows and jumped out, but that wasn't something Tony could do and still be able to run off—especially with his ankle hurt again.  Then he blinked, remembering.  "Natasha's things."
"I was," Tony agreed.  "Still am, I guess."  Doing the research part, anyway.  He was obviously not stateside at the moment.  "But…"  He took a deep breath, looking back out the window again.  "I guess you could say I've enjoyed working with you."
Steve shakes his head, slowly at first, then faster.  “No,” he says.  He glances over at Howard, then at Tony.  “Tony.  I didn’t take it.  You know I didn’t take it.”
him.  Tony was familiar with the stories—he knew that Cap was hailed as a hero by a lot of people.  But Cap had told him, with complete honestly, that
It’s almost ridiculous, how much events in the distant past that he can’t even remember still haunt him.
With that, he turns and heads back inside, and the fact that no one stops him tells him that Howard isn’t following.
"I am."  Tony put the papers back into the bag.  "Take the reactor after… it happens.  Reed will know what to do with it."  He took a deep breath, looking paler than ever.  "And…"
“I’m honored you think so,” Steve said with a small smile as he picked up his shield, starting to polish it.  Tony raised an eyebrow.  It already looked very shiny.  “Anyway, I’m glad you came.  I wanted to ask you…”  His gaze slid sideways, to Tony’s chest, even as he continued to polish away.  “How’s your heart doing?”
"The world ended."  Stark opened his eyes to look at Steve, who found himself taken aback, wondering why Stark would say something so bizarre.  "It's not exaggeration," Stark continued, reading the disbelief on Steve's face.  "Let's backtrack.  Remember the undead monster trying to eat you?"
Pepper tilted her head.  "I can see that," she said.  "The ancestors guard her tomb.  So their tiles are the ones that shoot the arrows."
Throughout the years, not a week goes by in which he’s not in the air, soaring over shining lakes and quiet lands, through glittering clouds and roaring winds.  He flies high and he flies fast.
Once he'd opened his eyes again, though, it became pretty clear as to how that happened.  He was in Steve's body today. Which was great for him, he supposed, since it meant he wouldn't have to suffer for last night's actions, though he did feel a bit sorry for Steve, who was likely going to wake up with a pounding headache.  And since Steve wasn't an idiot, he would probably figure out what the pounding headache was caused by and then be so, so disappointed in Tony...
Steve waits all morning for Tony to come down to the third-class deck, busying himself by sketching some of the people nearby, but the other man doesn’t appear.  So around noon, he leaves his spot and starts walking around the ship, trying to see if he can find him.
“Of course I remembered.”  He can feel Steve lowering their arms, the other man bringing their hands to his front so that he can embrace him.  “I know I can’t give you a lot, Tony.  I have the clothes on my back and about ten dollars in my pocket.  But… I can give you this.”
"I—" Tony began, and then his throat closed up, and he looked down at his hands, clenching them tight.  "…I'm sorry," he said at last.
He’d started off the week looking for a cure for his broken heart.  And now, he thought, sitting here next to a war hero, a super soldier, a military man—now he thought that maybe he’d really found it.
"You can't go," Maya said, stepping out of the garden.  Steve turned to look at her reluctantly, though he kept Tony—still coughing—shielded with his body.  There was a long gash on her face that wasn't there before, and she was holding the tranquilizer gun from earlier.  "You made me lose my samples of your blood.  I need more."
Well.  If he couldn't get out of the restraints, then he'd have to get out of the chair.  He tensed up, then pushed off with his feet as hard as he could, flipping the chair—and himself—over and landing on the back legs with a loud crack, the wood of the chair breaking beneath him.  Maya cried out in alarm, and as much as Steve hated to do it, he kicked her with one of his freed legs, and she fell back, stunned.
"Tveria," Tony repeated, drawing out the word.  He motioned to somewhere up ahead, where they could see a biter shambling around, and ducked onto a side road to avoid it.  "One of the Four Holy Cities in Judaism.  Supposedly, when the final redemption comes, Tveria is where it'll begin."  He chuckled to himself, though Steve didn't see what was so funny.  "Redemption is a nice thought, isn't it?  I wonder if humanity can be redeemed after everything that's happened."
But he’s not, so he doesn’t, and eventually he pretends to fall asleep so that they’ll go off and do other things.  Once the room is empty, Tony gets up and finds a computer and looks for
Unable to help himself, Tony just smirks again, waving one arm.  “We’re both men.  What do you need privacy for?”
Tony wasn’t anticipating that, though.  Sure, maybe he’d never fought a sabretooth before, but he was certain he’d be able to manage—he’d brought his gauntlets along, and he’d never met an animal that couldn’t be quelled with a repulsor blast in the face.  Of course, if he used the gauntlets too much or too hard, then he’d have to hook them up to his heart battery to recharge them, and there’d be no way he could last the whole week… but that was a problem he’d deal with once he got there.
Tony blinks at him, his heart skipping a beat or two or three.  “What?” he manages at last.  He can’t have heard right.  This is what he’s been wanting to hear for ten years, but he’s always, always known that he never will be able to, because—because he doesn’t deserve it.  He did a terrible thing, and it’s only right for it to go unforgiven for the rest of his life.
There was no time to worry.  The biters were starting to slow down near them again, and, not wanting to be a sitting target, Steve broke into a run.  More than one biter made swiping motions in their direction, but Steve set his shoulders and barreled past them.  Soon enough, they were finally, finally back at the field, and Steve paused, catching his breath and praying for the throbbing in his side to stop.  Almost right on cue, a muffled explosion came from behind them—something blowing up upstairs, most likely.  Now all Steve had to do was find the exit, and then they'd be safe.
So Tony fired again.  In hindsight, this was probably an awful idea, because it caused the sabretooth to lash out, clawing blindly at his chest as Tony cried out in pain, automatically shooting again in response.  “Rogers, fuck, for the love of God, get this thing off me—”
Steve blinked, tilting his head, and Tony could tell what he was thinking.  “No, I’m just kidding,” he said.  “Eat away.  I’m just unsettled by the blood you’re spraying everywhere.  But please, continue.”  Steve let out a whine at this, like some sort of overgrown… sabretooth puppy, but he obediently went back to munching away as Tony put the fire out and packed their things.  Once he was done, he rested his head back against the cave wall and let his eyes shut, tuning out the sounds of Steve eating raw meat.
Having never been rich himself, Steve has to admit he doesn’t actually know what Tony’s talking about.  He knows a few things about father issues, though.  “What’s wrong with Sunset and your father?”
The subject was simple.  This Joseph character had proposed to the writer, leaving her confused because she wasn't sure if he'd proposed because he knew he was going off to war soon, or if he actually loved her.  And her own feelings were muddled as well, because she thought about the possibility that he'd never come back and how awful that made her feel, and she'd always liked him before but now maybe she loved him and she just wasn't sure?  It was, Tony had to privately admit to himself, all rather mushy.
"Not sure yet," he replied as smoothly as he could.  It was better than dumbly repeating everything she said, at least.
He shut the notepad, quickly shoving it back into Steve’s pack and glancing over at him.  From the looks of it, Steve was still staring into the pond—he should put a stop to that, probably, and so he got up, walking toward Steve.  Once there, he took a seat beside him, ignoring his surprised glance.  “Hey,” he said.  “You want to talk?”  Steve gave him a look, and Tony groaned, rubbing his forehead.  Right.  Steve couldn’t talk.  And the reason he couldn’t talk was probably because Tony thought he was annoying.  Magic was irritating sometimes.
Fortunately, though, Rogers eventually lowered his head, starting to lap up his food.  He looked kind of like a dog with a food bowl, though Tony wasn’t sure if this was something he should bring up.  It was kind of cute, he guessed, but also unsettling.  This was wrong.  Captain America was a human.
"Nothing," Tony replied firmly.  There was an—opportunity here, he felt.  And if he took it, things could go so right.  Or—also as likely—it could go so, so wrong.
“Of course I came back,” Tony breathes, managing to slog toward him.  “I-I think I found something that’ll help.”  And he shows him the gun.
From behind him, he could hear Rogers sigh, and then he heard the rustling of paper, like maybe he was putting all of the documents back in their folders.  “It’s late,” Rogers said.  “We’ll be there tomorrow morning.  I suggest you get some rest, because it’s going to be a long week.”
“Tony!” he hears at last, and he inhales sharply in relief, getting a mouthful of seawater in the process and coughing it back up.  “Tony, where are you?”
Tony sighed.  Rogers’ response didn’t tell him anything, but he wasn’t in the mood to press tonight.  “Wake me up when it’s my turn to keep guard, then.”  Rogers nodded, and Tony rolled out his sleeping bag, curling up inside it before discreetly checking the charge on his heart.  93%.  So far, so good.  If the rest of the week was as eventless as today, then he was in no danger of running out of power.  Whether or not that was particularly desirable was another question entirely, but Tony had little choice but to roll with it.
"No, not really," Tony said.  He lurched out of bed and made some adjustments, and for the moment, the airship stopped shaking.  It wasn't going to last forever, though, and he knew that he needed to start thinking about the best way they were going to hit the ground with this.  "But I did warn you we'd barely get there, didn't I?"
"What—" the woman began, still staring at Maya in horror.  "I—I don't know what you're talking about!"
Natasha didn't answer at first, instead watching Tony as he looked at the papers, his eyes widening again.  "These are blank," he said.  "Where are the Tveria blueprints?"
Tony blinked down at it, surprised that Cap had already put this together for him.  "Well," he said.  "Thanks."  He hesitated, then turned around so that Cap could help him put the pack on.  Everything still hurt, but it was a throbbing, constant pain that he could tolerate for now.  He just needed to last until they found the last piece, and then he could rest.  "Are
Tony groaned, reaching up with his good arm—though it itched, so it wasn't really a good arm anymore, except his bad arm was both itchy and shot, so he supposed it was still his good arm if only relatively speaking—to rub at his temple.  "No, not that," he said.  "I don't care about that."  Who gave a damn if he was having some nightmares?  He always had nightmares.  "I mean the important things."  His throat ached again, but he made himself add, "My friends.  Where?"
"You literally ran to the locker room as soon as we were finished to read this shit," Ty snapped.  "You haven't even changed out of your track uniform. I'm tired of having to deal with this, so tell me what the hell is going on with you.  Now."
In his darker days, he almost felt as though that stripped him of his right to live.  Maybe he deserved Steve's fate as well. He sure as hell didn't deserve his charmed life, not after what had happened.  Yet despite thinking that, while now finding himself in a situation where this could very well be it, he was still afraid.  If the worst happened, he deserved it. But God help him, he was a coward without Steve's courage to ground him, and the thought of it all being over sent a tremor down his spine, even if it looked more and more likely with every passing second.
There it was, the gulf between them.  The reason Tony had taken his hand and then pulled back.  The reason they had parted ways.
"God, of course not," Tony managed.  "But they modified the designs that they stole.  Made it more suitable for acting as a biological weapon.  I didn't realize it at the time, but they did some test runs with it near the end of the war… they were working with the Japanese, dropping the plague over China.  Then the war ended, and it seemed like it was all over."  He snorted.  "But it was never over.  A few years later, the biter epidemic happened, and here we are now.  And it's my fault.  It's completely my fault.  I killed us, Steve.  I killed everyone."
"Gee, I can't wait," Steve sighed, gripping at the bed he was sitting on.  Then Tony pierced him with the needle, and Steve hissed softly, letting out a pained grunt.  "T-think the last time I got sutures was in '43," he managed in the hopes that talking would distract him from what Tony was doing.  "We were in a factory.  Lots of moving parts.  Bucky patched me up that time."
Tony set the reports down, then picked up a glossy, annotated photo.  "Oracle bones," he announced.  "The ancient Chinese would write questions to the gods on bones and tortoise shells, then burn them and figure out the gods' responses based on how they cracked."
The rest of the papers almost looked like a condensed scientific article, beginning with an abstract and ending with a section titled "Expected Results".  Furrowing his brow, Tony went through the long list of anticipated outcomes: the subject would have enhanced speed, enhanced strength, enhanced metabolism, enhanced durability, enhanced reflexes… it went on and on.  Finally, it concluded:
Okay, time for excuses.  Tony cleared his throat, trying to seem casual, and said, “I mentioned I’m hallucinating, right?  Pretty out of it.  I hit my head, you see.  I wouldn’t put much stock in anything I’m doing right now, really.”
“Oh.”  Steve goes back to touching him, hands roaming his chest and arms, and Tony makes a low sound in the back of his throat.
“Promise.”  Steve presses another kiss to his nose, and they cautiously make their way toward the lifeboat, where one of the crew members is shouting something—
Carol taps her card.  “He’s fine, which you’d know if you hadn’t been ignoring your transmissions for the last five minutes.  He’ll be out of surgery soon.  The others are in the waiting room, if you want to see them.”
“Maybe,” Steve says, sounding contemplative.  “But I don’t think that’s it.  I think it’s something else.”
"Yeah?" Tony asked as he split the food between the two plates.  He snorted softly.  "What, you want something from us?"
, based on that one time he’d plucked it out just to see what would happen.  Hell, he’d probably have a heart attack and die.  And wasn’t it a shame that he’d worked so hard for so long to find a way to cure himself, only to undo everything just to return Steve to the status quo?
“Uh huh,” Steve said with a little smile, setting his shield aside as well.  “Well, I’m happy for you, Tony.  I don’t know what I would have done if I’d come back to myself and seen you dead.”  His mouth set, and he turned on Tony with a glare.  “You broke your pinky promise.”
"No," Birch said.  Tony looked back at him, and he was glad to see that Birch was no longer laughing, his pale face drawn and concerned.  "I was supposed to ruin him—ruin his future—with his own weapons—"
“Alright,” Tony murmurs.  He reaches up, gripping at Steve’s shoulder a little, then licks his lips and keeps on going.  God, it
And, perhaps, most distressingly of all, Steve's conclusion about the double date had been correct.  (
“What is it?” Tony asked, frowning.  God, he hoped this wasn’t his way of letting him know he had to do his business, though he supposed it would be better than just letting loose without warning.  Rogers pawed at the wall again, looking back at him.  Tony sighed, shining the flashlight against him, trying to figure out what he was getting so worked up over.
Tony obliges, and his mouth falls open as he does.  It’s like… it’s like the whole world is ahead of him, all radiant skies and dappled waters, and he’s soaring through it all.  He can’t even see the railing from here.  “Steve,” he gasps, and suddenly he’s a little boy again, arms outstretched as he runs through the yard, pretending—”I’m flying!”  Is this what pilots see when they soar through the air?  When they glide over shining lakes as the sun goes down?  For all his love of aircrafts and flying, for all his tinkering with wing designs and pilot controls—he’s never flown before.  His father’s never let him.  But today, right here, right now… he’s flying.  He’s flying over the Atlantic and no one can stop him.
Pepper drew back, then nodded in Cap's direction.  "Thanks, Cap," she said, and then she left the room.
Steve settled down beside him, licking at his paws.  Tony turned to look, blinking and raising an eyebrow when he saw just what Steve was doing.  “So is that a thing you do now?” he asked.  “Licking yourself?  Pretty cat-like, isn’t it?”  Steve just shrugged, tongue lapping away, so Tony continued, “Alright, so here’s something I’ve been wanting to know.  Doesn’t that taste awful?  You’re covered in dirt.  You’re eating it, basically.  How is that okay?”
recognition," Tony replied.  "Good news is, I think we can still fly this thing, and I think I have an idea of where our friends are.  Bad news is, I don't know that she'll fly for long, and if I'm reading the transceiver signals correctly, they're in Turkey."
Natasha stared at Steve for a long moment.  Then she turned to Tony, putting away the Makarov and setting down what looked like several miniature cylinders.  "Smoke bombs and firecrackers, with love from Russia.  If you're traveling, you'll need them more than me."
The man looked back.  His face was pale and drawn, like he was ill, and his expression was—neutral.  Completely neutral, as though he wasn't deep in a forest that had just been set aflame.
"No!" Birch repeated, his voice sharper, more panicked.  "I know the stone works!  How do you think I ambushed you in China?  How do you think I knew you would come here?  I was told by someone who could use it—who saw what you'd done before you'd done it!  I know!"
And so they fall silent again, but Tony breathes easier now as he finds himself laying back on the ground, barely noticing when Steve lays down beside him, and then he remembers what Steve had told him earlier.  He’s home, Steve had said, even though he’s sitting on the opposite side of the country in a poppy reserve owned by the government.
"Amazing, isn't he?" said the guy who'd brought Tony here in the first place.  Tony cast a glance in his direction and saw a shit-eating grin wide enough to match his own on a good day.  "No shield or anything. Going at it with nothing but a smile."
"Yes," Tony agreed as more of the day's events came back to him.  God, what a mess it had all been.  "You know, Rhodey threw a rope up at me while he was still trapped in that pit?  He wanted to use it to climb out."  Cap didn't reply, so he continued, "I was too weak to tug him up myself with it.  So I went off to tie it to something.  But when I came back, he was gone.  I wasn't quick enough, and I lost him because of that."
Tony hesitated, then shook his head as he rested it against Steve's chest, trembling a little.  "Thanks," he said quietly.
Cap returned moments later, dragging the suit along.  It had taken a lot less time than Tony had expected—Tony had no idea how the Army had managed to find such a pinnacle both personality- and strength-wise, but it was commendable.  "How are we doing?" he asked.
(A stray thought popped up, reminding him that this had happened before when he was six, and if he focused hard enough he could still make out the faces of what must have been Steve's parents back at that age.)
Thoughts of Ma came to him unbidden, and immediately Steve could feel his throat go tight as he tried to block them off; still they persisted.  He couldn't help it. Tony's Pa naturally made him draw parallels to his own Ma, who was kinder, happier, better than him in every way.
It seemed as though she knew nothing about Project Rebirth, and Steve was keen to keep it that way.  "So you want to find a cure," he said, changing the topic.  "There was no need to keep me here by force.  I would have helped."
"Okay," he tried as he guided her back toward the cabin, instinctively keeping himself away from her mouth.  "Alright.  You… don't understand me.  That's fine.  We'll get you to the cabin, and maybe once you've had something to eat we'll figure something out…"
To his surprise, he saw nothing out of the ordinary.  Everything looked intact. Maybe no one had looked through these.  Maybe he was just being paranoid. Maybe no one besides himself had even moved them in the first place.
Steve pouts, not entirely happy with this development, but he spreads his legs so that Tony can settle between them.  “You look cute like that,” Tony continues, smirking as he lowers a finger, circling his entrance—Steve gasps quietly and bites his lip, and the curve of Tony’s mouth deepens.  “This is a better look, though.  Can I continue?  You’ve done this before, right?”
Steve grunted and writhed at the impact, turning long enough for Tony to catch the glint of the shield on his back—right.  The shield.  That had helped before, hadn’t it, the last time Steve went full sabretooth on him?  Maybe it would help now.
Steve held his tongue, though, and didn't call him out.  He looked around instead, needing to know even if he dreaded hearing the answer.  "And Jim?"
The other man’s gaze dropped down to his chest, though his metal plate was now covered by the shirt.  “Promise me that if we continue, you’re not going to drop dead on me.”
Steve swallowed hard.  He could see the ice again, rushing ever closer.  He blinked to get rid of the memory.  That was all it was now—a memory.  Not a vision.  "I thought I'd died, too."
"Tony," he said, and the other man looked back at him, expression unreadable.  "Even if you understand, I still hurt you.  That will never go away, and I am sorry for that.  I don't want to do that again.  And—I want the chance to not do that again, if you'll give it to me."
"It's not that," Ty insisted.  Tony wasn't sure how much he believed him.  "I mean, I just don't get it. You were
Of course, given the way these dates were turning out, the plan may very well not work.  Tony sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose as he remembered what Steve had written. "Yeah, well," he said.  "I apparently have a big problem when people mouth off against the troops." She'd said something, Steve had replied, and then they'd gotten into a loud argument and parted ways.
"Yes," Tony said.  "But that doesn't change anything.  I'm gonna fix this.  Because I refuse to believe that this is the way things are always going to be now."
Rogers made a non-committal grunting sound in response, bringing out his notepad again and writing more things down—presumably about the things they’d seen today, because he was a note-taking machine.  Tony, meanwhile, brought out his sleeping bag, slithering into it and checking his heart monitor beneath the metal plating.  81%.  Nothing to worry about.  “Don’t tell me you’re going to keep guard again,” he said.  “There’s nothing here.”
Obediently, Tony took a swig—it was just water, not anything exciting, unfortunately—and swallowed.  “I thought drugs didn’t work on you.”
But, he told himself, he had evidence that it had all happened.  The voicelogs on his laptop. The water-damaged homework that Tony suspected might be tear stains from their last switch.  The drawing of himself and Mom in a field of lavender. It was all proof that someone had touched his life once. At the time, it had felt like they had swapped lives for so long.  Now it felt like the distant past, a fading memory of a tiny portion of his life.
"Hey, Tony," he heard in his own voice, and he suddenly felt such a powerful mix of relief, nervousness, and loss grip at his heart that he had to pause the recording to compose himself, taking in great gulps of air.  It was Steve. It was really Steve.
The question takes him by surprise, his eyelids fluttering for a moment.  But then he turns his head in the direction of Steve’s voice, giving him a small smile.  “I do,” he says.  He’s had his share of corporate spies and ladies who’ve wanted to bed him in the hopes that he might gift them something extravagant.  But Steve—Steve isn’t like any of them.  He
He wanted to be a coward.  He wanted to wipe the laptop and never know.  But even as he thought it, he knew he couldn't do it.  Steve had
He slumped against it afterward, breathing fast despite the lack of physical exertion even as he willed his heart to stop thumping so he could hear if anyone was following.  For a long moment, there was nothing, until finally he heard Tony's Pa yell for Jarvis, something about getting him a drink.
With that, she disappeared from view, and Steve could hear her shuffling above the ceiling tiles, away from them.  A few minutes later, there was the sound of loud banging and shouting, and the sounds of the biters at the door waned.  To be sure, Steve got down on the floor, peering through the gap under the door.  "It's clear," he said to Stark.  "You ready?"
Steve blinked slowly, staring at the sky where the woman's head had once been.  Then his gaze went down, and he found her head on his chest—or what remained of it, anyway, once that bullet had gone through.
This was better now, even if broken chair legs were still attached to his calves, but he still didn't have use of his hands.  Checking to make sure Maya wasn't getting up, Steve ran out of the room, looking down the hallway, and—there.  Not too far down was what looked like an office with a glass wall, and Steve charged toward it, bursting through the glass and hearing it shatter around him.  There were tiny flecks of blood appearing on his clothes, but he ignored them for now, turning his back toward one of the glass edges still attached to the wall and sawing apart the restraints binding his wrists together.
Ma gave him a weak smile.  "So I should be glad you only have one person in your life doing this to you, is that it?"
Tony closed his laptop and set it aside, scrubbing at his eyes.  He'd just told Steve the day before that it was okay to cry, but that didn't mean it was okay for
He had to wonder if that was the intention, for the drawings to be unintelligible.  Maybe it was the only way Steve could express himself without other people being able to tell what he was doing.  The problem was, Tony couldn't tell what Steve was doing, either.
“Isn’t it?” Tony replies, beaming.  “My father won’t know what hit him.  Well, he probably will, and he’ll probably be upset.  I guess I should hide or something.  Hey, maybe I’ll change my name.”
Cap shrugged a little.  "I'm pretty sure that whatever you told Virgil didn't involve you dying in an ancient Chinese tomb," he said.  "Wouldn't want to make a liar out of you."
When the lifeboat comes for him, he’s nearly frozen, but still alive.  But even as they wrap him up in blankets, trying to get him to lie down, he struggles against their hands and sits up anyway, ignoring the searing pain in his shoulder.  And he looks over the edge, looks over at the figure lying motionless on a makeshift raft, just one body in a sea of hundreds—
Tony traps him.  Tony reboots when Steve tries to bring him down, and Tony beats him until Steve’s suit is torn and his skin is bloodied.  When Steve still refuses to surrender, Tony has his guys activate their audio-blocks, bringing all the rebels down to their knees in agony.
Steve blinks at that and quickly draws his hand away, looking up at him apologetically.  “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to hurt—”
“No,” Steve says, and Tony can’t help but deflate a little.  That would have been too easy, and Tony doesn’t deserve it, anyway.  Nonetheless, Steve stops rubbing at his wrist, taking Tony’s hand instead.  “But I miss you, Tony.  I miss what we had before… everything happened.  And I think with time and effort, we can get it back.  And you’re worth that effort.”
Ty snorted and shook his head.  "Wish we were in the same gov period.  Would have loved to see that."
"Well, if I can cut down on your healing time, why wouldn't I?" Tony asked as he poured some ethanol onto a clean part of the towel and started dabbing away.  "We're friends, right?  That's okay for me to say?  I generally prefer that my friends don't suffer if it's not necessary."
Steve took a deep breath, leaning against the door when he heard the biters continuing to thump against it.  They were going to break through if they kept this up.  "Where's Jessica?" he asked.
Was he wrong?  If Steve had been recruited, surely there was some sort of documentation.  No way something like this didn't have a paper trail. But where was it?
"Jarvis!" he tried again, voice hoarse from the smoke, but again no one answered.  Tony went in deeper, stopping along the way to pick up one of his notebooks off the ground, and that was when he saw a pair of feet sticking out from under a collapsed shelf.
one.  And does it really matter whether or not they’re soulmates if they’re happy together?  She doesn’t think so.  He doesn’t think so.
Tony turns to look at him, his eyes widening as the full reality of what’s going to happen tonight hits him.  The ship is going to sink.  People are going to die.  And somewhere down below, Steve is handcuffed, possibly all alone, and he can imagine him now, head bowed as he thinks about how much Tony must hate him…
When Tony opened his eyes again, Steve was still looking at him with the same intensity as before, unafraid.  "What makes you say that?"
"'Their'?" Tony repeated, wanting to make sure he heard right.  He was afraid to hope, but he needed to.  "All three of them?"  It wasn't great to know that they were in Nazi custody, but it was good in that he knew that they wouldn't be in Nazi custody unless they were alive.
He squeezed his hand, and Tony found himself squeezing back.  "A future," Tony said, and somehow, this time he really did believe it.
“Call me Tony,” he replies hastily.  “I think you’ve earned the right to address me by my first name.”  Besides, Mr. Stark is his father.  He doesn’t want to be his father.  Nonetheless, Tony takes his hand, shaking it before it occurs to him that Steve doesn’t seem to recognize him.  How is that possible?  To Howard’s great displeasure, Tony’s been caught up in a number of well-publicized, scandalous incidents in both America and Europe.  Finding him in bed with another man a month ago had been the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back.  But Steve here… who knows.  Maybe he lives under a rock normally.  He certainly looks poor enough for that.
be comfortable?  He supposed it could be worse, really.  Rogers was surprisingly graceful and smooth in his movements, and thankfully for Tony’s stomach, he didn’t bound down the road like a crazy thing.  At some point, Tony had to admit that this was a good idea, despite the growing soreness in his legs.
Wasp bit her lip, looking nervous as though she didn't want to be the one breaking this news to him, but it had to be done.  "Over half a century," she said at last.
"Yes, and now they wouldn't hesitate to kill her given half a chance."  Stark stepped in close, grabbing Steve's shoulders.  "See reason, Steve!"
Then suddenly he stopped falling, because there was an arm around him, holding him steady.  Rhodey, his brain managed to tell him amidst the agony.  But while Rhodey was strong, Cap wasn't light, and neither was Tony for that matter—they wobbled precariously, Cap still dangling too much to get a good grip on the door and the airship unable remain level as it tried to maneuver.
Tony inhales, exhales, and then rubs his eyes to make sure he’s seeing right.  “It’s you,” he says after a long moment, and she just quirks her lips, slipping her bracelet back on.
And then he was gone, having bought Tony the precious few minutes he'd needed for the suit to fully charge up.
, and even though he’s known Tony for all of, what, two days, he knows there’s something special about him.  Something he doesn’t want to slip away.  Is whatever they have now going to last once they get off the ship?  He doesn’t know.  But this—whatever this is—is something he’s going to enjoy while he can.
Tony blinked up at her, then took the papers back.  "Thanks," he said as he slowly turned them over in his hands.  "Almost forgot about these."
It was happening again, apparently.  Ma was talking about something he didn't remember anything about, and he didn't like the implications.  Either Ma was imagining things, or he was suffering from memory loss - maybe Dougie
"I told you once that I enlisted because it was the right thing to do, and I had a duty.  That's the truth, but not the whole truth. The whole truth is that it's because of my parents.  Ma raised me to stand and fight for those who were important to me. And Pa lived it. He fought for Ma."
Steve had a feeling Tony was being obtuse on purpose, though he couldn't imagine why.  "Is something wrong?" he pressed.  "Is the reactor broken?  Is your heart okay?"
"Rhodey was alive when we separated," Stark said, shaking his head again—quickly this time, as if trying to clear out his previous thoughts.  "That was about half a year ago.  See, this is the part where you come in.  We'd spent the past couple of years just trying to survive.  Rebuild.  We met a few people, some better than others.  And—I don't know.  I thought we were getting somewhere.  Hell, I even learned how to grow things.  But it was all meaningless.  People were still turning and biting other people unless you destroyed their brains.  The danger never ended.
Then his fingers closed around something else, something buried deep in the bag.  He pulled it out, blinking slowly at it, the metal glinting dully in the fading light.
," Cap said, far too quickly to be convincing.  "Hold still.  I gotta clean this."  He shifted Tony's arm, then started to dab at the edges of the wound with the cloth.
Tony blinked and looked at the newsreel.  There was Cap… and there was Bucky, his famed sidekick, charging off into battle together.
Tony's lips parted, and for the second time in mere minutes he found himself at a loss for words.  It was just—Cap
Tony had had no tags.  Tony had never officially been military.  But as Steve carefully pushed the dirt back in, he thought that this was exactly where Tony belonged—with the rest of the soldiers, because he was as fine a soldier as any of them had been, had served their country as much as anyone else, if not more.  And like the others, he had paid the ultimate price.
“Stop fretting,” Tony interrupted before Rogers could get on a roll.  “Look, it’s okay.  We know our way back.  Besides, we haven’t even explored the whole place yet—”
"So let me get this straight," Rhodey said.  "We're making the assumption that the item mentioned in the bone writing is actually a third of the item we have with us right now, because—"  He looked at the annotations next to the characters on the oracle bone photo.  "—Tiger-circle-three, apparently.  If that's true, and if this piece was found in one of those capitals, then it would imply the other two pieces are hidden in the other two capitals."
Rogers was silent for a moment, probably thinking about it.  “I don’t think it can fit in here,” he said at last.
"You're a strange man, Cap," Tony said.  "But alright.  We go in together and break through whatever defenses they have set up.  Then we find the others.  Then, if it's there, we use our pieces to find the last fragment.  I want us to end this, one way or another."
He was almost in when a sudden weight almost dislodged him, and above him, Tony grunted in pain, still trying to haul him up.  Steve looked down to find a biter clinging to his waist and swore softly to himself.  By now, at least, the train was going fast enough that the biter's head was lolling back a little, unable to fight the wind enough to bite him.  He kicked, but still the biter held fast, its teeth gnashing.
Steve just shrugged, picking the dead deer up in his mouth and ambling back to where they’d left their things, Tony trailing after him again.  Did any of this bother Steve?  It was hard to tell.  But Tony had to admit, for a second there… he’d been terrified.  Terrified that Steve was gone and in his place was a massive prehistoric cat that’d just killed something and was looking for blood.  And Tony didn’t know if Steve knew that for the briefest of moments, something else had overcome him.
have a freak for a son!” Howard screams, yanking the tablecloth off and sending utensils and dishes and uneaten crumpets everywhere as Tony cringes, automatically scooting back in his chair.  Before he can get very far, though, Howard shoves the table aside and advances on him, placing his hands against the armrests and leaning in close, breathing hard.  He sounds like a bull getting ready to charge.  “It is immoral,” he hisses.  “It is wrong.  It is illegal.  How are you so selfish, Tony?  Have you even given thought about what would happen if someone besides me catches you?  Do you know what it would do to our company?  To
The memory of last night's dream came back to him unbidden, and Tony tried to somehow blink away the gnawing feeling of hunger that had plagued him the entire time he'd been that scrawny kid.  Maybe getting just the one donut hadn't been enough. "Uh, yeah, I guess," he said distractedly around his donut, chewing with more gusto than he normally did.
Steve forced himself to his feet, swaying a little but managing to remain upright.  Tony didn't stop him, his hands dropping out of Steve's hair.  "I got bit because of myself," Steve said.  "You need to stop doing this, Tony."
, on a small adventure that so far hadn't even involved glimpsing an enemy soldier.  This wasn't his arena, but here he was.  Tony found himself irrationally fearing humiliating himself in front of the man, but that was a stupid thought, and he pushed it away quickly.
He was afraid of a lot of things.  Of rejection.  Of uncertainty.  Of what terrible things might lie for them in the future as they irrevocably marched toward it.
He reaches Steve’s wrist, now missing the watch Tony had gotten so used to seeing there.  Idly, he wonders where it went before he’s suddenly struck by a thought—the watch is
"The Captain has them," Rhodey said.  Tony must have reacted in some way, because he continued, "Is there something wrong with that?"
“Hey, calm down,” Tony offered quickly, since Steve seemed on the verge of a panic attack, even if he was doing a good job at keeping it under wraps for the time being.  “It’s okay.  Do you know what just happened?  Or how you got here?”  Steve shook his head, withdrawing a bit and apparently trying to make himself look as small as possible, which, for an animal of his size, was basically an exercise in futility.  Tony sighed.  “It’s okay,” he said again, awkwardly reaching out to pet him.  “I guess you just… forgot yourself for a moment.”  If an hour counted as a moment, but hey, who was arguing semantics?  “Anyway, you wandered off without me, but it’s alright.  I found you and we’re headed toward the mountain anyway, so no harm done, right?”  Steve gave him a morose look, like it was absolutely not alright, but Tony tried to ignore it.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Tony says, but inside, he’s painfully aware of what she’s saying.  Of course he knows.  He’s known of every single time Steve has approached his office and his home.  He has to, in order to hide himself away so that he doesn’t have to look at him.
“I know, I’m sorry,” Tony replies.  “Look, it’s—it’s going to be alright.  Come here.”  Of course, since Steve can’t actually go anywhere, Tony closes the distance between their lips, kissing him for all he’s worth.  Regardless of what happens next… he wants this one last moment with Steve.  “It’s going to be alright,” he repeats afterward, stepping back.
He was in the middle of designing some gauntlet upgrades in his head when he abruptly heard a snarl coming from right behind him.
They fell quiet then, enjoying the temporary peace as the train continued through the tunnel.  Dimly, Steve was aware that they should probably be keeping an eye out in case there were more blockages, but he couldn't make himself get up just yet.  But evidently luck was on their side, because soon enough, sunlight flooded into the compartment, and Steve realized they'd cleared the tunnel.  He pulled himself up, Tony doing the same beside him, and looked outside.
him, even if he hadn’t explicitly spelled the words out.  Him!  A hot mess of neuroses and personal issues from his youth—
The hallway they'd stepped into was dark, and Tony blinked as his eyes adjusted to the change.  From one of the rooms came the sound of raucous cheering, and it was this room that the other man led them to, practically bouncing on his feet.  "
Then a breakout at the Raft happens.  Steve’s the one who calls Tony in, so he heads over just in time to pound into a bunch of escaped crooks and lock—well, not all of them, and not most of them, but
Finally, tired and emotionally exhausted despite the fact that he hadn't left his home all day, he trudged back to his room, shutting the door behind him.  His gaze wandered, landing finally on his desk, where one of his laptops sat in case he woke up in the middle of the night with an idea - and that was when he remembered that if he'd been Steve, then Steve had been him.
aware—the armor was hardly silent—but Tony decided to try and keep quiet anyway as he edged closer to the voices, using the shelves of weapons as  cover.
But the kitchen was empty.  Confused, Tony checked the doorway - maybe she'd stepped out - but he knew she only had the one pair of shoes, and they were still sitting in the entrance.  So she was home, then. And from the looks of the closed bedroom door, she was in her room.
“You can do this,” Tony said again, terrified.  “Rogers.  Steve.  Fuck.  Get your ass up here because I’m not doing this for you.  Come on.”  There had to be something he could do.  Maybe—maybe he could swing back and somehow kick Rogers up?  No, that was no good; he’d probably dislodge him.  Could he just try grabbing onto one of his paws anyway?  No, then they’d probably both fall.  God, he hated this.  He hated being useless.
At this, Tony frowns.  That’s a weird thing to say about the words that might lead you to your soulmate.  Okay, maybe he has his own issues with them, but this is
This was - not entirely surprising, Steve had to admit to himself.  Tony slept in only his underwear at school, and Steve was starting to suspect that the reason he even had underwear was because Ty was liable to barge into his room at all hours of the day.  And now that he was at home, there was apparently no more need for that last bit of modesty. Here he was, just… completely exposed.
And then they left, heading up the way Steve and Tony had come from.  Steve watched them go for a while, then hoisted his things and started walking the other way, Tony by his side.  "That was nice," he said.  "Having human contact.  I missed… talking to people."  It was, of course, understood by them both that they'd done a piss-poor job of talking to each other, and Steve knew it was his fault.  Now, maybe, they'd do better.
There was still nothing but silence.  Steve chanced a glance up at Tony, whose expression was… pained?  When their eyes met, Tony quickly looked away, swallowing.  "Steve," he said at last.  "I would have given up anything to hear you say these things ten years ago."
He let go so Tony could sit up and take a look as well.  Tony did so, cursing softly afterward.  "I didn't even see it.  God, I'm so sorry, Steve."
Bucky pressed up against him, and it took Tony a second to realize that he was steering the bike back toward the plane.  "We don't stop this, the whole Eastern seaboard becomes target practice!" he shouted in return. "We gotta turn it around!"
But it’s okay, Tony thinks as he pulls Steve back up to their room.  Because at the end of the day, he’s the one who gets to be with Steve, and that’s all that really matters.
He then said a string of syllables Tony couldn't quite make out - not any language he knew, whatever it was - and then the recording ended, leaving Tony staring blank-eyed at the screen.
And he was Steve.  Thin, asthmatic Steve, who in the coming days would undergo a procedure to make him as heroic on the outside as he was on the inside.
Steve looked back at the bag.  There was a box in there, and he brought it out, opening it to reveal several bullets.  He swallowed and offered the box to Tony, who stared at it before taking out one bullet, replacing it, and then taking out another bullet.  He repeated this a few times until he finally found one bullet he was apparently satisfied with, sliding it into the magazine and handing it back to Steve.  "Now… now we're ready."
Tony saves Steve’s life once, twice, a hundred times in the years that pass.  He lets Steve sit in his garage and draw while Tony works and spars with him in his free time.  He gives Steve relationship advice on Bernie, on Diamondback, on Sharon as they sit in the kitchen drinking coffee together at the crack of dawn on the days Steve spends the night at the mansion—Steve having risen early and Tony not yet ready to sleep.  Sometimes, when he has Stark Industries business to attend to at his other branches, he drags Steve onto his jet and goes sightseeing with him in between meetings: to Normandy, to Beijing, to Easter Island.  (Steve is reluctant at first, afraid of missing any crises that might happen in New York, but after they fight off some supervillains at the Great Wall, he concedes that crises happen everywhere so it probably doesn’t matter where he is.)
"It's not," Stark agreed.  His voice was hard.  "The people who died during the war were still capable of missing the family they left behind."
Then another pair of arms reached forward, and he was finally pulled back into the airship proper just as it pitched forward.  Tony swayed dazedly for a second, then fell back onto the floor of the airship with a grunt, his vision going white.  "Cap," he managed, trying to blink the whiteness away.  "Is he here?  Safe?"
To say nothing of Ma, who had always been so kind and supportive and who was - just - gone.  She hadn't even been his mom, but she'd been Steve's mom, and Tony had seen how much of Steve had come from her.  And Tony had learned, maybe, to… care about her.
“Steve, what…?” Tony began, but before he could get any further, Steve lowered his head, nudging at Tony’s hand before opening wide once more.  Frowning, Tony looked down, trying to figure out what on earth Steve was trying to tell him.
Steve's eyes darted around the room, and Tony felt his gaze linger on him before sliding away.  "How much later?" he asked quietly.
Tony blinked up at him, his own chest heaving.  "Alright," he said in the ensuing silence—relative silence, anyway.  Neither of them was shouting anymore, at least.  "Thanks for that."
"You were surrounded," Tony replied, as though that were any reason to come running in without any thought toward self-perseverance.
And maybe, he thought, he could tell him how sorry he was about what had happened that night, how Steve had misunderstood what it had meant when he'd woken up in a different bed, how Tony wouldn't ever even think about having found happiness with Ty.
"I'm flattered," Natasha said.  "Well… perhaps someday."  She held out her hand for them to shake.  "It was a pleasure meeting you.  Surprisingly."
And like that, his crew was assembled.  Tony gathered them all together in a room, laying out the additional materials that Fury had provided him after he'd agreed to the mission.  There wasn't much, but there was enough to get started.
He looked back in time to see Cap's lips quirk upward.  "You guess, huh?" he said.  "I guess I could say the same."
Abrupt gunfire cut Rhodey off, and on instinct Tony threw himself to the ground, grunting in pain as everything was jostled.  Pain or not, though, he had to act.  He quickly pulled his pack off, reaching inside with his good hand to grab his gauntlet, but by the time he looked back up there was smoke everywhere—more than was natural, and he suspected that their new company had added smoke bombs to the mix.
"Calculus, English lit, lunch, physics, French," Ty recited.  "Wow, I hate that I know your schedule by heart. Anyway, I'll see you at lunch, I guess."
"It already is," the man said.  He smiled benignly, turning toward the door.  "I will check on your friend Stark," he continued.  "He may be of use to us."  He left, and only Steve and Maya remained in the room.
.  Art that Steve had done of himself and Mom, sitting in a field of lavender - how'd Steve know that was Mom's favorite?
"Uh huh," Tony said as he looked around.  "Nice place you've got.  How many people here?"  He hadn't, Steve noticed, mentioned that they were planning on looking for a cure, too.
be real.  It’s too strange.  “Thanks,” he mumbles after a minute, hunching over and pulling the jacket closer, shivering.  He hadn’t realized how chilly it was out here earlier.  At the time, he hadn’t cared.  But now he does, and Steve’s jacket is around him, warming him.  Is it leather?  It smells like leather.  Probably the only nice thing he owns, based on the rest of Steve’s clothes.
“Don’t apologize.”  Quietly, Tony presses another kiss to his neck, nuzzling it idly afterward.  He doesn’t say anything, so Steve doesn’t, either, instead just rubbing his back in small circles.  They stay like that for several moments, Tony seemingly content to just lay his head there, but eventually the silence is broken.  “I want you to touch me, Steve,” Tony murmurs.  “Will you do that?”
of them back up.  In the aftermath, he, Steve, Peter, Jessica Drew, Daredevil, and Luke Cage stand around in a circle, marveling just a little at what happened.  “So we were pretty cool together,” Peter says.
, Steve’s face goes pale, and he ends up dropping the duffel bag he’s holding, eyes wide.  “What,” he asks in measured tones, “is this?”
But there was nothing he could do about it.  "Okay," he said.  "So let's assume that he knows we're already on our way.  And the closer we get, the better he'll be able to pinpoint us.  Well—pinpoint whoever is holding the pieces.  Almost sounds like we should each take a piece and approach wherever we're going from different directions."
"Damn right!"  Maybe that was why Tony enjoyed this aspect of the suit so much.  It was just a shame he hadn't added these modifications until
Tony couldn’t tell if Rogers was joking or not, but he swiped ineffectually at it, trying to snatch it from the other man’s grasp.  “Mine,” he said.  He didn’t like sharing his toys.
And that, Tony supposed, was where they differed, because Tony was quite sure he could explore the Savage Land on his own.  Hell, he’d been the leading man for
So Tony does, tilting his head up a little as he does so.  Is Steve going to kiss him now?  It’s certainly a good time for it.  But no, Steve is leading him forward instead, guiding him toward the rail.  “Step up,” he says softly.  “Keep your eyes closed.  I’ve got you.”
Tony opens his eyes then, and even though he expects it, it’s still a punch to the gut when he sees the coffin and not Steve.  “I’ll never forget you,” he whispers, and then he pushes himself onto his feet.
Steve pushed himself up into a sitting position, groaning a bit.  She wasn't wrong, it seemed. "It's okay," he said anyway. "I wanted to be here when you came back."
"This it?" he asked, as though it weren't obvious—it was clear Cap knew exactly what it was, given the almost reverent way he was staring at it.  Tony wasn't sure if he should be unsettled or not.
"I-I don't know!" she stammered, but Steve continued staring at her until she blurted out, "The press box!"
The sound of bullet fire rang out, and Pepper let out a breathless gasp as dust sprang up in front of them, a result of the bullets hitting the ground nearly at their feet.  The only good thing was that the plane couldn't keep up these kinds of close calls for long, not when it was moving so much faster than them; it turned away after it passed overhead, presumably to circle back and try again.  "We gotta get rid of it," she managed.
Tony was apparently uninterested in subtlety, because he clapped his hands together and looked at her, expression defiant.  "So, lady, what's the deal?  My friend is bleeding out and I don't know what you want to do with us.  Are you going to help?"
this to happen,” he said quickly.  “I’d much rather have you as a human.”  He was a lot easier on the eyes as a human.  “But anyway, don’t worry.  I’m sure there’s a way to fix this.  I’m Tony Stark, remember?”
Damn it.  He kicked again, and this time the biter stumbled back, but then it lurched toward Tony, who had fallen and was grappling around for a weapon.  Steve grabbed the biter's arm to yank it away, only to find that the arm had come right off.  He cursed, reached for the leg instead, and with a loud cry, tossed it right off the train, panting for breath afterward.
"Sure," Steve said, stepping aside so she could get down onto the ground, where she shook out her hair and frowned at the black grease and dust on her hands.
The cut really isn’t that bad, Steve’s suit having taken the brunt of it, although Steve’s kind enough to not say
The first hour or so that they spent walking on Chinese—or Japanese if the Axis powers were to be believed, though Tony wasn't inclined to do so—soil was eventless for the most part, filled with heavy breaths as Rhodey led them down the mountain and through the dense underbrush.  They'd tried, unsuccessfully, to see Yinxu proper from their vantage point, but the air was heavy and humid, and Tony knew better than to try to make any assumptions when the hot air was playing tricks on their eyes.  For now, the plan was the same as before: to get there first, and
“Here we are,” Rogers agreed.  Tony turned to watch as Rogers brought out what looked like a sparse map of the area with various squiggles covering it, kneeling down to lay it flat on the ground.  “I mapped a potential route we could take.  It’s not exact because there aren’t really paths, just these rough ideas of where the mountains and forests are, but I think if we go in an outward spiral like this, we can see a lot of things but still be able to return to the airship point pretty quickly.  What do you think?”
They’re so close, he thinks.  Their lips are only a few inches apart.  And Tony… Tony doesn’t want to hold back anymore.  If anyone’s watching, to hell with them.  So slowly, tentatively, he pulls one hand away from Steve’s, reaching up to cup Steve’s cheek with it.  Steve, for his part, holds perfectly still, quietly gazing back at him, though Tony thinks he can hear the pounding of his heart—or maybe it’s his own that is beating so loudly.  It doesn’t matter.  The only thing that does matter is that they’re together.
It was hard to describe.  He thought to himself, as he managed to sit up in bed, that maybe it was more the lack of feeling that was bothering him.  Because - well, because honestly, right now he was pretty sure he was supposed to be hungover.
Tony straightens when he’s done, looking down at the stone.  “You raised a hell of a boy,” he says, and then he turns and leaves.
Tem was here.  Tony was here, too, seemingly conscious, but Tem was standing over him, one hand grasping Tony's collar.
Yinsen glanced up, meeting Tony's eyes briefly, then looked back down at the gruel or whatever it was he was preparing.  "Coming from you, that's quite a compliment," he replied. Everything about him was very calm, as though he wasn't being held captive in a dark, cold cave by a terrorist group right now.  "But you can see what my brilliance has done for me. And, I suppose, for you."
“You’re hopeless.”  Nonetheless, she cracks open the box, and Tony blinks, peering inside.  “This is the ring I intend to present you with at our wedding ceremony.”
Steve ran.  In his arms, Tony threw something, and he could hear firecrackers going off between the sounds of Maya screaming—though whether it was out of fear or rage, Steve couldn't tell.  It didn't matter, anyway; only getting out of here did.
Tony shook his head, as though he could read the thoughts running through Steve's mind.  "It was worth it," he said fiercely.  "It was so, so worth it.  You make me think that we'll find a way out of this darkness.  Not even because you survived a bite.  But because you're Steve, and no matter what happens you'll always be Steve.  You've given me hope in a hopeless world."
"No," Steve said, because even if some of the things Tony was saying touched on the truth, he couldn't let Tony believe he deserved to carry such a weight on his shoulders.  "You weren't the person who made the Jericho into a biological weapon.  You weren't the person who made a damned biter infection to begin with.  For God's sake, this is Hydra we're talking about.  It doesn't matter if they used your design as a starting point or not.  They would have got there anyway.
He grimaced.  Whatever was going on down there, it didn’t sound very good.  In fact, based on the loud thumps, it seemed more like Rogers was scaling the wall, sliding down, and falling.  Over and over and over again.
"I'm not a dog," Tony said, sounding a little put out, although he at least limped over to the bed.  "Well, except where you're concerned.  Can I say that now?"
"I know!"  A plan was starting to form in his head, though he already knew going in that it was a damned foolish plan and maybe he would die, but at this rate they were going to die anyway, so it wasn't actually that risky after all, and him dying was better than the lot of them dying.  He came to a halt, motioning for Pepper and Rhodey to keep going when they turned toward him with bewildered expressions.  "I'm going to shoot it down."
.  But… but… he can’t risk scaring Tony away at this point with his… socially unacceptable tastes.  “It’s just—you know, to be an artist, you can’t just confine yourself to only the dames, or only faces, a-and the guys and gals in Paris are really willing to model a-and—”
Strangely, Tony’s not afraid.  Disappointed, maybe.  Definitely sad.  If only they’d talked earlier.  If only Steve had joined him.  If only Steve had just
That… was a good point.  Steve wasn't entirely sure what was in the bag Stark had offered, but he remembered them finding beef jerky and cans of chili recently, which probably wasn't the greatest thing to feed a newborn.  "Does this Burnside have baby formula?" he asked.
“Well, this is great,” Tony sighed, looking around.  Hmm.  Maybe this wasn’t entirely a crapshoot.  There were a few conveniently-placed vines hanging from the trees on either side of the ravine, which made him wonder if whatever ancient civilization that had once occupied this place had grown them here for the express purpose of swinging across.  Tony had swung across using his fair share of vines, so it wouldn’t be new, just terrifying—then again, that was part of the thrill.  Rogers, though…
Steve obediently went to sit down, looking around curiously.  Tony apparently lived in a mansion of some sort, because everything was huge; Steve's entire apartment could probably fit in the dining room.  It was ornately decorated, and Steve suspected that anything sitting out that looked like actual precious metals were probably the real deal.
"Oh, I wish the gaping stab wound in my stomach was my only injury," Carol said, laughing weakly.  "But no, I'm definitely bit."  She carefully stuck out a leg, revealing torn pants and a wound that was festering, but hardly looked like a bite.  "It barely broke the skin," she said.  "That's why I'm still alive.  But between this and bleeding out, I'm not gonna last much longer."  She exhaled softly, looking up at the ceiling.  "Until you came, I guess I just wanted to make sure I wouldn't die by being torn apart by the others.  But…"
Not too long afterward, masked men break into a Stark Industries facility and steal half-a-dozen prototypes in a precision strike, somehow knowing exactly what to do and where to go.  Weeks after that, Sunset says she’s breaking up with him.
Tony frowns.  This is hardly the direction he’d expected the conversation to turn toward.  “I—yes—but what does it matter to you?” he snaps, trying to regain his composure again.  “Go away.  You’re distracting me.  Let me go in peace.”
The terror and chaos of those early days was hard to imagine.  "It's been five years, right?" Steve said.  "If there were biters here, they're probably gone by now."
As soon as she was gone, Tony came up to Steve, placing a hand against his shoulder.  "Hey," he said softly.  "We should go."
They managed to find a small pond partway up the mountain after dusk, deciding to set up camp there for the night.  As Steve went to lap up water from the pond, Tony opened the pack of black beans and ate them cold, feeling too vulnerable to start a fire.  What if pterodactyls were nocturnal?
Maya took a few steps closer, though she was still some distance away.  Her expression remained stoic.  "He knew that sacrifices had to be made," she said.  "It doesn't change anything.  I can always find a new place to do my work.  You're the key.  The key to unlocking humanity."
"Is it strange if I blame myself for what happened with Birch?" Tony asked softly as he stared up at the ceiling of the plane.  Because he did.  Rationally, he knew he'd done the right thing.  Birch had harmed his company and his employees.  Jail was the correct place for him to be.  But—what had he
His tone was light, but he looked concerned, as though fearing that that was actually what they had to resort to right now.  Tony had to hold back a laugh.  "God, no," he said.  "I have a few new tricks up my sleeve, you know.  Ones that never appeared in
They break apart several moments later, and Tony leans forward, panting quietly as he rests his head against Steve’s shoulder, one hand sliding from Steve’s cheek down to his neck, then his shoulder, then his chest.  “Steve,” he whispers.  “Do you really want this?  Do you really want
She’s not very happy with him.  Not that she’s said as much, but it’s obvious in the glare she levels at him as they settle across from each other in the promenade.  “I checked in on you last night after dinner,” she says stiffly, one dainty hand picking up a crumpet and spreading jam onto it.  “You weren’t there.”
Tony still couldn't tell what Cap was thinking.  "Yeah," he said as casually as he could manage—which, he had a feeling, was not actually all that casual.  "I mean—you said you enjoyed this, right?  And… and you're nice to have around.  So.  It was—it was an idea."
I’ll be back.”  He splashes over to where Steve is standing, then kisses him hard, panting as he looks into his eyes—and Steve feels the three words he’s been dying to say right at the tip of his tongue.  But no, he thinks.  He should wait until they’re safe, or until… until they run out of time.
Steve nodded, and Jarvis left, leaving him alone and still vaguely confused in the dining room.  But sitting here pondering wasn't going to help him much, so eventually he got up and went to wash his plate.  The thought of playing with the roast box (or microwave, whatever) again occurred to him, but he was half-afraid that doing so would somehow summon Jarvis, who would then promptly rap him on the knuckles with a ruler.
An older man was already in the kitchen when Steve finally emerged from his room, dressed in the t-shirt and shorts he'd resorted to after getting lost in the gigantic closet and giving up on finding anything from there.  He was cooking something, and the room smelled heavenly.
Tony laughed then.  It was just a quiet, breathless chuckle at first, but then it got louder, longer, and before he knew it, he was laying back on the floor, eyes squeezed shut in mirth.  For
Cap sure looked sweet with that megawatt grin of his.  "Then I'm glad you've enjoyed yourself," Tony replied.  He wondered if he should say what he was thinking.  The worst Cap could do was say no, right?
"—And if that happens, I don't want my last act to be lying around somewhere, waiting.  I need to do this, Tony.  For Bucky.  I can't leave him here."
But this—this is different.  Steve is inextricably wound up in the part of his life that Tony found so hard to share with Rumiko.  Steve’s seen him at his best and also at his worst.  Steve is
The woman was unmoved.  She pushed closer instead, those rotting teeth still working furiously, inches away from his skin—
Tony nods, moving closer.  Too much of that, and Steve’s not going to have room to touch him.  “More.”
Grimacing, Tony slung both his and Steve’s packs onto his good shoulder, then picked up the shield, because he’d be damned if he was going to leave any of their stuff behind.  Once he was ready to go, he took off, heading in Steve’s general direction—what else could he do?  They’d come this far; Tony wasn’t going to abandon him now.  But really, damn the man.
For now, he kept reading.  The next letter was dated a month later and had different handwriting and the first words were
Rogers—no, Steve, he needed to start thinking of him as Steve now—looked toward the mountain, contemplating it.  Then he started to walk, and Tony followed after him, looking up at the mountain as well.  It wasn’t
by his little speech.  For God's sake, the man was Captain America.  Tony had heard stories about him, and they weren't even from magazines of men's adventures.  He found himself wondering again what the hell a man like Cap—a leader on the battlefield, a master of military tactics—was doing
It was his fault.  He was supposed to be a futurist, someone who could shape what was coming next.  Instead, he'd been ineffective, his presence inconsequential to the tragedy of both Steve and Bucky's fates.  He'd had a chance to make things right, and he'd failed.
Steve nods again, biting his lip as he looks off to the side, chest heaving.  “I trust you, Tony,” he says.
The half-amused expression was replaced by one of genuine concern, and the stranger stepped back, holding up his hands.  "Hey, whoa. It's me. Ty. Are you okay, Tony?"
Well, that was progress.  Steve reached up, about to run a hand through his hair before remembering that his hands were covered with the remains of another human being and thinking better of it.  "You want to tell me what just happened?"
An hour later, S.H.I.E.L.D.’s airship was heading their way to pick them up, and then—at long last—they were going home.
"Don't go down that path," Tony said.  Steve could feel him applying the antiseptic, but the sting was nothing compared to the turmoil in his head.  "It's okay, Steve.  I know why you were angry.  The fact that you stopped being angry was more than I ever expected."  He smoothed the gauze on, his touch gentle.  "Because all I'd wanted… needed…"  His hands dropped, and Steve turned to meet his gaze, his blue, blue eyes.  "I found you," Tony whispered.  "And I got to see you again."
Tony beamed, or at least he tried to beam, even though he was lying on a bed with one arm awkwardly elevated.  "I knew it!" he crowed.  "My God.  I have a fan.  And that fan is
Steve nods as he quickly complies, fingers flexing.  “W-water’s cold,” he says.  “Can’t feel my hands anymore.”
They stopped talking after that, chewing in silence.  Canned bologna wasn't Steve's favorite thing, but he certainly wasn't going to turn down anything that was offered.  When they were done, Steve looked at Tony and jerked his head toward the doorway, wordlessly asking if he was ready to go.  He got an answering sigh in response, Tony seemingly resigning himself to the fact that they were going to do this.  Then they picked out some of the things they thought they would need and left through the southwest exit as instructed.
They didn't talk much after that, though the silences they shared in the coming days seemed much less tense than before, and Steve was reminded again of what a fool he'd been to cling to his old hurts concerning Tony.  And now when Tony was quiet, Steve thought he could read him better—to reassure him when he sensed Tony's thoughts were straying to darker places.
It went against everything he knew.  A more naïve him might have protested that it was immoral.  A more stubborn him might have snapped that it felt like giving up.  That no matter which way he cut it, it was wrong, and he could never do it.
Tony never heard the rest, though, because in the next instant, a thousand pounds of big cat bowled into him, knocking the wind right out of his body.  Oh, shit.  Oh,
.  Probably a different language, Tony decided, since while he knew the slang decades ago had been out there, this was a bit beyond that.  Happily, the rest was in English, though reading it gave Tony the same unsettling feeling the first one had - more words written by ghosts who weren't here.
For some reason, Tony finds himself laughing, his first real laugh since everything went to hell half a year ago.  He has no idea why.  It just—it seems like such a Steve thing to say, somehow.  Or maybe it’s funny because if all those lunches and dinners and impromptu excursions around the world in the past count as dates, then they’ve already gone out a few hundred times.  Hell, maybe he’s just giddy.  “Fine,” Tony manages once he reins himself in.  “This Friday.  We’ll go somewhere with fancy apple pie.  You’ll love it.”
Now it was Steve’s turn to look dazed, apparently—very slowly, he lifted one hand up, pressing his fingers to his lips as his gaze met Tony’s.  “Oh,” he said at last.
.  But if they spent too long hanging out down here and missed tomorrow’s pickup, then he’d be in big trouble.
Cap hesitated as he clenched his fist, staring hard at the base of his fingers.  It was difficult to tell, but Tony thought he could see a band of darker skin around one finger, the one that had wore the ring.  Maybe it had burned him.
something terrible.  Tony was almost tempted to think that maybe Steve had put two and two together wrongly, but no, Steve had never been a fool.  He was clever and smart and so, so brave, even in the face of his impending fate.
He pauses for a moment, chest heaving as he watches Steve carefully for any signs of wakefulness.  When Steve doesn’t move, he practically shoves at him, voice rising and scratching against his throat—”Steve.  Steve!  Wake up, Steve, you have to—y-you have to wake up—”
With a nod, Tony dips his head back down, managing to find the crook of his shoulder and nuzzling into the space there.  He looks adorable and happy and sated, which is the best Steve could have hoped for, really.  “We’ll have to do this again later,” he says, voice muffled.  “Much later.  I’m exhausted now.”
Rogers made a sound that might have been a laugh, if only Tony knew what sabretooth laughs sounded like.  “Was that a laugh?” he asked.  “Does Captain America really laugh at things?”  Rogers just looked at him impassively, and so Tony sighed, pulling one of the packs off Rogers’ back.  “Fine, don’t tell me,” he said.  He reached in, bringing out one of their packaged meals, then blinked and turned back to Rogers.  “Uh.  You wouldn’t happen to still want to eat…”  He glanced at the package, continuing, “…pinto beans, would you?”
More intriguing was the kitchen, which was filled with all sorts of gadgets Steve didn't recognize.  Knowing now that he was in the future, he could assume that a lot of things were actually new home inventions that didn't exist during his time, and he was burning to find out what they did.  At school, his exposure had been limited - there were few appliances lying around, food having been served already cooked, classes still having been taught with the traditional chalk and blackboard.  Being in Tony's home now was like an entirely different world.
It was as… unbelievable to look at, really, as it had been when he'd first seen it in the morning.  It was
"He's not—" Steve began before stopping himself and sighing.  She didn't need to be burdened with his personal problems.  "Fine.  We'll wait."
"Funny how things can slip through the cracks when a crisis is happening," the man—Birch, apparently—said.  "You can hardly blame them.  They needed scientists."
"Steve, stop," Tony said, the worry clear in his eyes.  "You're being irrational.  None of that matters anymore.  You've been bit and it's my fault.  Please just relax."
,” Sunset spits.  “Anyone who looks at you can tell you’re a man of wealth.  God forbid if someone tried to rob you.”
The man smiled at him, and it made some subconscious part of Steve relax, like… like he knew he was safe and going to be taken care of.  Kind of like how Ma made him feel. "I heard you wake and suspected it would be some time before you came out," he said, and Steve felt himself flushing involuntarily.  It was crazy, but he half-suspected Jarvis had known exactly what was occupying him. (Did that imply that Tony was often occupied by the same thing?) "Breakfast should be ready in a few minutes.  Please have a seat."
"Mr. Stark?" that same voice pressed.  Tony was pretty sure it was Cap, since no one else on the airship called him that.  It helped that the voice sounded just like Cap's.
There Cap went again with all that encouragement.  Tony was starting to believe that he really meant it.  "Yeah," he said.  "And we got you, too."  He'd been annoyed at the prospect of Cap tagging along at first, but… it wasn't so bad anymore.  It wasn't bad at all.  Even ignoring the fact that he was a handy man to have in a fight, his presence was just… comforting.  He trusted Cap.
Tony shakes his head, promptly scooping Steve up into his arms bridal-style and ignoring his protests.  “Showing you that movie was such a bad idea,” he says before flying them back to Stark Tower.  Once they’re there, Tony gets out of his suit and steers Steve to the bed in one of the guest rooms, making him lie down.  “Jarvis would do this, but he’s sleeping and I don’t want to wake him, so you’re stuck with me.  So strip,” Tony commands, and, looking amused, Steve does.
"Jarvis!" he yelled, on the off chance that Jarvis would reply, but there was no response.  It didn't matter.  Maybe he was unconscious or otherwise unable to respond.  There was, of course, only one way to find out.
Wordlessly, Tony reached out for the gun, and Steve let him take it without complaint.  He looked at it for a long while, running his fingers along it before checking the magazine.  "It's unloaded."
In any case, he supposed it didn't matter all that much, since it was still all just a dream.  For now, there was the mystery of these voicelogs. He was half-afraid he'd summon another racy picture once he hit enter, but his curiosity demanded that it be done.  With a glance back at the door to make sure it was still firmly shut, he took a deep breath and pressed the key.
"Tony," Cap said from off to the side.  It was the first time he'd spoken since Tony's presence was made known.  "Who is this man?"
He'd need some help from Steve's mom, though.  It was still summer and a weekend to boot (and thank goodness, because Steve had talked about his brand-new delivery job and it sounded like something Tony really didn't want to deal with), so Tony expected to see her already in the kitchen, maybe frying up some biscuits.
"It might," Cap insisted.  "If we have two pieces and he has one.  The attraction to our two pieces may be stronger than the attraction to his single piece."
"Jesus," Tony muttered.  "That's a hell of a hunch.  But I'll pick your brain later.  Can you wake Pepper and Rhodey and ask them to get ready?  I'll meet you outside."
Stark slung the rifle back over his shoulders, shaking his head.  "Don't mention it," he said.  "Let's get what we need and go."
Having nothing better to do, Steve complied, letting out a sigh of relief when he saw that his shield was the first thing in there.  He pulled it out, running his fingers around the familiar shape, and glanced over at Stark's back.  "Were you out looking for this?" he asked.  "Did you just find it?"
Tony nodded as he came closer, while the woman continued to linger in the doorway.  "I'll let you two have some privacy," she told them.  "Then I'll bring you something to eat and we can… talk."  Without waiting for an answer, she left, the door again closing behind her.
“W-we both need to,” Tony tells him, setting his jaw in a vain attempt to make his teeth stop chattering.  “A-and I’m saying for y-you to get on first.  And either you c-c-can argue with me a-and we can both spend m-more time in the water, o-or you can l-listen and g-get on.”
Tony’s had the words on his wrist for as long as he can remember.  They’re written in blue ink, the handwriting neat and steady, and for most of his young life he neither knows nor cares what they mean.
They glanced at each other; Pepper looked particularly uneasy.  "It sounded like aircraft," she said.
roll—Steve’s choice, not Tony’s—Tony can’t help but glance pointedly at Steve’s wrist, which is currently covered with a wristwatch.  He’s never seen it bare, but maybe they’re close enough that he can… inquire.  After all, just because he no longer cares about his own words doesn’t mean he’s not curious about other people’s.  “So,” he drawls, “Jan was showing me her words the other day.  You know what words are?”
Tony glanced around.  The sun had risen by now, so there was plenty of light to go by.  "It matches what we know," he said as he took a few steps around the area.  "The building that used to stand here was circular, going by the foundation that's still here.  Somewhere inside should be an entrance that leads underground to the tomb.  Spread out and look."
Then, finally, a shadow fell across him, and even without being able to move, Tony could tell it was another human - a man, dark-skinned, in American military fatigues.  From the eye holes, he could see him bending over, taking hold of his exposed wrist and placing a thumb along his vein.
"Yeah, well, there you go," Tony said.  As he'd known already with the booze and robot-malfunction thing, Ty was much more likely to just go along with a story if it involved Tony screwing up somehow.  "So you go. Have fun."
Jessica cleared a spot in the dirt and started to sketch out a rough map with a stick, detailing the locations of the storage, the exits, and the guards, as well as a blind spot that they'd used to escape, which they could also probably use to get back in.  "If we time it right, Peter—one of our friends—he'll be the one on watch here," she said, making an X in the dirt.  "He'll probably let us in.  Then we just grab what we need and go."
“He brushed it off,” Steve supplies, and Tony nods.  “So that’s why she wants me to bring it up to him.”
And in that moment, standing there with Steve's thumb running over his thrumming pulse, the last piece of the puzzle fell into place.  Those parting words from Steve's final voicelog, all those years ago - Tony had never figured out what they were. But now, he realized, he knew: they were the words a soldier said to the pulse of his heart, his distant love.
"Get away!" Tony shouted, and then he swung the shovel at Bucky, the blade going straight into his skull.  Bucky crumpled to the ground, and Steve could do nothing but watch helplessly as a wave of nausea and dizziness overtook him, sinking onto the floor himself.  "Oh, my God," he heard Tony say over and over as he rushed toward him, fingers scrabbling to get out the gauze and put it over the wound on Steve's neck.  "Steve, what—what the—oh, my
Steve shook his head.  "We don't have the luxury of time," he said, stubbornly continuing to walk.  "We gotta keep going."
Another biter came tumbling from above, but it hit the ground head-first and didn't move again.  Steve inhaled, exhaled.  "Thanks.  I guess.  Are you okay?"  Tony's shirt was torn, and it didn't seem like it had happened just now.
For the next few hours, they made their way through the ruins, their flashlights the only things illuminating the place as they took everything in, Rogers recording their findings with what Tony personally thought was an overblown eagerness—had the man never visited an architectural site before?  He’d probably faint from excitement if Tony ever took him to the Cave of Altamira.
Tony didn't know if he should be relieved or not.  Jarvis wasn't the dead person here, but it meant that the enemy had been on the ship.  And maybe Jarvis was elsewhere.  He didn't know.  But he had to keep looking.
That managed to kick Tony's brain into gear again, and he quickly shook his head.  "No," he said.  They didn't need a fifth member, especially not one who was going to be feeding Fury info about what they were all doing, no matter how many tales he'd heard of Captain America's heroics.  "Can I veto?  I'm vetoing."
“Trust me, if they can afford this car, they can afford more lotion.  Now relax, I need to prepare you.”
you’ve read… that’s just been me looking for a cure.  I tried science.  I tried surgery.  Nothing works but charging the pump, and that’s not a cure, that’s just a temporary fix, because even with the charge, my heart’s getting worse and worse, and eventually not even the charge will be enough.  So I wanted to look for magic.  I mean, at this point, science was failing me.  Why not just throw all my cards to the wind and see what happened?”
Steve followed after her, figuring she'd be able to find her way out of the building—which was what he needed, because he had to put Maya down someplace safe before going to find Tony.  A few minutes later, they were back in the middle of the stadium; the woman went off in another direction entirely, but Steve ran straight into the garden, remembering how strongly it had smelled earlier and hoping that the corn stalks would shield Maya from the biters.
"I'm not going to let you make him - make me think that's not okay," he said, and then he walked right past Tony's Pa, all the way back to his room where he shut the door behind him.
They’re on and off, on and off.  Between helping out Steve and the Avengers, battling his own personal enemies as Iron Man, and carrying out his duties as Secretary of Defense, Tony doesn’t always have the time for her, and she doesn’t like it one bit.  Eventually, though, after he gets past the nightmare that is his living armor and the crap that Sunset and Ty Stone throw his way, he thinks he’s got this whole long-term relationship thing figured out.  He introduces Rumiko to Steve and some of the other Avengers.  He calls Happy to ask him for help on how to pick out a wedding ring.  He gets ready to propose, because—because while he doesn’t know if Rumiko is
"Tony," he murmured, and he reached up again, running his fingers through Tony's hair, remembering the way he had done this so many years ago.  "My feelings for you.  They're the same as they were before."
Steve could see he was getting ready to fight.  "I'm not going to let you speak like that to me again."
It was then that Steve realized what was about to happen—but again, Stark was there, shaking his head gently, and Steve tried not to feel sick.  He hadn't wanted to believe things had gotten so terrible, but everything he saw was screaming at him otherwise.
“Apparently,” Steve says, and they both laugh, even though it’s not all that funny.  But Steve is feeling light and happy, and he suspects Tony is feeling much the same way.  “You really working on all those things you were talking about?” he continues after a moment.  “The… the super…”
Tony winces, suddenly realizing that in those four words his father has already shown more interest in Steve’s side of things than he has.  Nngh.  If they escape this dinner alive and Steve is still talking to him… he’ll have to fix that.  “Isn’t that a bit personal?” he asks, twitching at the idea of Howard mocking… whatever it is that Steve does.
"She was going to wait and see what happened to you," Tony continued.  "I told her that you'd appreciate it if you were there when she buried him."
"We can't bring Danielle in.  And if something happens out here, you're better able to protect her on your own than I would.  Besides, I'm smaller than all of you.  That might be useful."
Cap opened his mouth a little, then closed it, lips pursing.  "Well," he finally said.  "The pieces are attracted to each other, right?  If his piece are attracted to ours then he'll always have an idea of which direction we're in."
"Check again," Steve said at the same time the first of the biters came into view from behind him—or, at least, that was what he assumed had happened, because her eyes went wide and her hand returned to clutching her heart.
Steve furrowed his eyebrows.  "So what, you just assume the worst out of everyone?" he bit out, annoyed—and then he immediately winced, because he realized just how hypocritical he was sounding.  It wasn't fair to judge Tony like this, especially after the things he'd said last night.  Tony had lived through the past five years, and Steve hadn't.  "Sorry.  Sorry.  I didn't mean it."
In the present moment, though, he thinks nothing of it as Sunset takes his arm and smiles down at it, looking pleased.  “Is that so?” she asks, and he grins wide and nods at her, his heart beating a mile a minute.
When they came across an abandoned ad-hoc military base that was littered with bodies with head injuries so obvious that Stark didn't even bother to jab them, Steve had to admit that maybe Stark was right.  Still, as Stark went to forage for supplies, Steve went to each soldier anyway, collecting their tags and pocketing them.
And that was when he knew without a reasonable doubt this was it, that this was the cure he’d been searching for.  His power detector was going haywire, so he just shut it off, stuffing it back into his pack.  “I hope you brought champagne, Rogers, because now would be an excellent time to bring it out.”
Steve frowned at the clipped tone of Tony's voice, but he chose not to press it for now, if only because he didn't want to stand right in front of a stadium that was burning down and filled with biters.  "Let's go," he agreed, scooping Tony up into his arms and starting to walk briskly down the street, turning a corner at the first possible opportunity so that there wasn't a direct line between them and the biters.  He remembered they'd left their bikes somewhere nearby, but he didn't think Tony could ride one in his condition, so walking it was.
.  I guess I did fall off last night after all.”  He turns around to lean back against the rail, gazing at him again.  “Are you serious about wanting to listen to me?”
as Cap bodily hauled him over his shoulder, and before he knew it, they were moving, Cap gracefully making his way from safe tile to safe tile even with Tony's added weight—he must have memorized where Tony had stepped and was now taking them in reverse.  "This isn't necessary," he protested, but Cap kept going, and then they were back at the entrance in far less time than it had taken to initially cross the room.  Tony caught a glimpse of Pepper's face as he was set down on his feet; she looked as though she couldn't decide whether or not to look amused or concerned.  Damn it.
By the time they had made it back to the ruins—Cap had managed to barter for some bicycles, so the trip wasn't too bad—the airship, which was thankfully intact, had stopped burning.  Tony headed inside, first doing a spot check for his armor—still there—before heading to front where the fire had been.  Cap trailed after him, making a soft sound of disgust as they passed by the body Tony had previously encountered.
"We're headed toward Bethesda," Steve told Natasha as they stood outside the hospital, the coast clear for now.  "The NMI lab, specifically.  So if you ever want to leave the city…"
"It wasn't," Ma confirmed, but she was still looking at him a little suspiciously.  Still, she straightened, motioning for him to hold the compress up to his own eye. "I'm sorry he's back at it, though.  At least you'll have Arnie to look forward to." She turned, heading back to the kitchen where whatever was on the pot was still cooking, and motioned for him to follow.
He groaned, running his free hand through his hair.  Okay, yeah, magic was nice and it made his heart work and he was very grateful.  But this whole sabretooth business was almost making it not worth the trouble.
Before Steve could think twice, he'd walked over to the large, full-length mirror standing in one corner of the room, looking into it.  Again, for the most part, none of this was new. What
Tony let out a sigh, running his fingers through his hair.  This wasn’t working.  He glanced at the sky for the first time—he’d been too busy listening to Rogers to pay attention to the light—and frowned.  He couldn’t see the sun because of all the trees, but he suspected it was late afternoon.  The first sunset of their deadline was approaching.  “I’m coming back down,” he announced.  Rogers’ eyes widened at that, and he shook his head wildly, but Tony ignored him, taking hold of the rope and sliding downward as Rogers whined uselessly.  “We have to find another way out,” he said.  “And I can’t let you wander off on your own.  So let’s go—if we follow the perimeter, we should be able to find another exit.”  He hopped on and held on tight, and with a bit of goading, Rogers finally took off.
Things weren't alright, but he wasn't going to cry, he told himself.  Maybe later, when he was alone, but not here and not now.
“Uh, wow,” Tony couldn’t help but say as he got closer, staring at the dead deer.  “I hope Bambi wasn’t around to see that.”
Tony's hands emerged, covered in blood and… other matter.  Steve had seen a lot of awful things during the war, but this came pretty close to taking the cake.  "Remember what I told you?" Tony asked, his eyes downcast.  His hands were shaking slightly.  "Sound and smell, Steve.  If we smell like this, we don't smell like ourselves."  He started to rub the guts all over his clothes, gaze flickering upward.  "Don't wait.  We don't have a lot of time until they reach us."
“Don’t be silly,” Tony said, hissing as he made another loop around his arm with the gauze.  “Please don’t hover over me like that, really, I’m not going to spontaneously combust.”  He taped the gauze in place at the same time Steve tapped his paw again.
He pinched the bridge of his nose with his eyes squeezed shut, remembering.  Yeah, last night had happened. He and Ty and some others had gone off-campus for a big dinner to celebrate the end of the semester, and then they went back to Ty's room and played some party games.  And then Ty, damn him, had dared Tony to drink because "what the hell, Tony, you haven't had a drink all evening; what are you, a teetotaler?" and what else was Tony supposed to do in that case? So he'd drunk.
“Very strange,” he said.  “Okay.  So what, the human is me and this awful depiction of a cat is you?  Then… three sunrises and three sunsets.  And a mountain.  So by sunset of the third day, we should be at the top of some sort of mountain.  Does this sound good?  Because I think I’m talking out of my ass.”  Rogers didn’t seem to be complaining, though, so Tony continued.  “Once we’re on top of the mountain, you change back.  Somehow.”
"I killed him," Tony cut in before Steve could say the words himself.  "I killed him because I couldn't let him get away with a weapon that he could use to kill innocent people, and because he wasn't my father anymore.  And I wouldn't have done anything differently."
What did Tony do in this situation, he had to wonder?  Was this something he had to deal with on a regular basis?  He'd never said anything to Steve about it, not directly, but he'd alluded to it a few times and that was enough to inform Steve that what was going on right now wasn't the first time this had happened.  Had he told anyone, or had he just… dealt with it by himself?
"Why?"  The conclusion didn't particularly surprise him—after what had happened at Fengjing, Tony suspected that the Nazis had been there first and already found the piece.  Maybe they'd found it when they were laying the trap, or maybe they'd already found it earlier.  He didn't know.  But what he didn't understand was why a discussion on how the man in the wheelchair knew their whereabouts prompted Cap to come up with this.
That set Tony off into another fit of laughter and tears, so Steve had to reach up and brush them away again.  "Good point," he said once he'd calmed.  "It's better than nothing.  It's—God, it's so much better than nothing."  He reached up at that point, taking Steve's hand, except then he seemed to reconsider it, letting go in the next second.  Steve wished he hadn't, but he didn't comment on it and instead wordlessly pulled his hand away.  "I don't know what to say," Tony finally continued.  He took a deep breath, staring into the distance.  "I thought you died."
"I can't expect great things out of you if you're falling apart," Cap said, but it looked like he was trying to hide a smile of his own.
Tony nodded.  He started stepping toward the exit, but paused when he noticed Cap still standing there.  "Something wrong?"
.  Us sitting in the woods after raiding a school infested with a bunch of insane people who were barely even human anymore.  Steve… it was me.  The biters were my fault."
“I don’t care about your words,” Tony informs everyone he brings to bed.  His partners will always glance at him, surprised, but in the end they’re happy to sleep with him anyway.  Inevitably, these relationships last little more than a night, but it doesn’t bother him.  Soulmates mean nothing.  His words mean nothing.  The tabloids treat his lack of interest as something scandalous, but Tony doesn’t care anymore.  He’ll sleep around and have some fun, and that’s all that really matters.
"They'll probably disperse by morning, but they were drawn here by the noise," Stark said softly.  "And this is just a small number of them when it comes to the big picture.  We're smarter than them, but each one is capable of tearing me, if not necessarily you, apart if the cards fall right.  If I have a chance to even the numbers by even just a little, I'll take it."
He thinks about his mother, killed in the car with the same make as the one on her wrist, and then he thinks of Steve, dead now because he’d gone to war with the man who had uttered the words on his own wrist mere hours ago, and Tony feels like he knows why Steve didn’t like them.
“Come on, Rogers,” Tony said, shining the flashlight around until he found something that looked like a road leading downward and started forward to follow it.  “We’re on an exploration.  In case you’ve forgotten, that means we should be
“—And you’re no doctor, either, so quit it.”  He pulled his shirt on a little too forcibly, grunting softly in pain afterward.  Right.  It would be good to keep in mind that he kind of had fractured ribs right now.  “Onward.”
Rogers’ gaze landed on the gauntlet, and for a moment, he looked dubious.  Eventually, though, he nodded, pulling out a blanket and draping it over him.  “Yeah,” he said.  “Go to sleep.  You’ve lost a lot of blood.”
And that, more than anything else, is what weighs on him the most tonight.  He doesn’t want to die, sure, but he’s chained to this pole and neither of them is going anywhere, and he can already see water seeping into the room.  So okay, fine, he’s going to die, and that’s bad.  But what’s
Tony blinked at her, nonplussed.  He wasn't confused at the notion of him being talented, of course.  That was just a simple truth where he was concerned. But hearing it from a parent figure?  That was something else. He loved Mom with all his heart, but she was around so rarely, and she didn't spend what little time they had together encouraging his hobbies.  Not that she needed to, honestly. He could encourage himself just fine, and Mom was there for him in other ways. And Dad - well, the less said about Dad, the better.
