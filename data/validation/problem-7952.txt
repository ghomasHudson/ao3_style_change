“I’m always on the winning side.” She releases him and stands up. “Don’t let me down, Rogers.” Without further word, Natasha walks away. She stops only to whisper something in Tony’s ear, and he glares at Steve in response to her information. How she figures everything out so easily should scare all of them.
Left alone with Rhodes, Steve tries again. “I hope you understand, Colonel.”
“We've only just crossed the nation with the locomotive. I doubt you see the future.”
“I refuse to spend the next few days fighting with you. When I said I was sorry, I meant it! That’s the end of it.”
Steve couldn’t do anything but laugh. He barked out and covered his face with his hands. But he found he was shaking. He had to get to the bottom of this – what the hell had happened. “Tony?”
“He’s a firecracker,” Luke comments and then they are off to figure out nightwear for Steve. He shows Steve different lingerie but then adds, “The Prince usually doesn’t end up asking his Escort to stay the night. Sometimes he asks them to leave and come back bright and early. Other times he asks them to never come back. But just in case, you should have a night robe and slippers.”
His friend sighs, and Tony hears the weight of the world settle on Rhodey’s shoulders. “Yeah. He called back when you were on the island. He was worried about how much you were working without sleep. He told me how excited you were, and I told him.” He stops as if he’s trying to recall the conversation. “Shit. I told him to let you go ahead. There was no stopping you once you were neck deep in inventions.”
“You want us to keep an eye still?” Clint asked.
“What’s not true?” Richards says. His perfect face perturbed by Tony’s statement.
Tony glances at Blu. Questions rise up but pop like bubbles in the sky. He can’t grasp them, the oddity of the situation keeps them out of his reach. “Okay. You hold that, I can use the repulsor to light a fire once I connect it to the chest piece too.”
“Ah! Nope. Do that and your hand will get all sticky.” Tony takes the fork from Steve and, with a knife, slices the waffles into cubes using the girdle pattern as lines. He impales a stack of cubes and then flies the waffles through the air, making zooming noises. “Open sesame!”
Strange leaves them for a few minutes as the surgical staff gathers to prepare. Steve turns to Tony. “Are you ready?”
Natasha studied both of them and then shrugged. “I suppose not. So then a warning. Stay out of international and national defense affairs from now on. If you’re not part of the Avengers, you really are just a private citizen.” She tilted her head and raised a brow, surely the picture of a spy assassin. “If you’re not part of the team, you’re part of the problem.”
“Now you’re taking care of me,” Tony says and touches her lightly on her cheek. “Always taking care of me. What would I do without you?” He smiles.
Steve had become something of an enigma to Tony. He sponged up as much knowledge about the modern worlds as he could, learning computers and phones quickly and efficiently. Tony wondered at his sharp mind and wit. He never let anything pass by him; part of Steve was always alert and ready to pounce much like Blu had been.
Jarvis smiled and thanked her. Tony grabbed the book and nearly toppled over from its weight. Its size ungainly, Tony managed with Ana’s help to place it on a table and crawl into the chair to open it. The book smelled old and used and he loved it instantly. He flipped through the pages to the table of contents and saw that most of the book concentrated on the last days in Europe and the last days in the Pacific theater as they called it. There was an entire chapter on the atomic bomb.
“There’s a team now?”
Tony spotted the marks all up and down Steve’s arm. So many lives were linked to his, a man who woke up in a century where he had no one but was now responsible for so many people. He circled back to Steve’s question – give it all up and just retire. “I don’t know. Could you?”
Rumlow stood up and smiled once more. “Let’s go.”
“Stark’s coming to the Conference.” Bucky widens his eyes and reminds Steve of someone who’s done one too many Ringers in his life to actually be sane and lucid anymore.
“Spectacularly is too nice a word for what happened, you know that right?” Fury says and he places his hands on hips and studies the map. “You gotta tell me, Cap, how you’re planning on keeping the peace throughout this whole fiasco.”
Steve enclosed Tony in his arms and kissed the crown of his head. Through the waves of their souls, he detected the halting, quiet despair shadowing Tony. “You need to sleep.”
When the nurse comes and tells him that the surgery is going well, he only smiles. When they report that his husband is out of surgery and in recovery he nods. When the Amazonian doctor comes and tells him they were able to save two of his uteri sacs he says that’s a good thing. She smiles and rests her hand on his.
"Get your boots out of my surgical site," Banner hisses and slaps Steve's feet down, but at least now, Steve can hold Bucky in his embrace as his friend bites down on Steve's shoulder. Thor and Happy grasp onto his legs again, holding him steady.
After a moment, Steve asks, “Are you okay?”
“Steve, you really need it. You look like Casper the Ghost,” Tony said and noted the wan color to the Captain’s skin. “You need to get some meat in you and I have to go a few more days with just pigs’ blood.” Some vampires in between feeding from their mates would visit Blood Dens or settle for animal blood. Tony had been drinking an excessive amount lately. Most of the time it was a sip here and there, but lately he’d been drinking his fill and then some. That wasn’t very healthy for Steve. He needed to be more considerate of his mate. With the serum, Steve healed and produced more blood quicker than normal humans, but Tony’s thirst had been insatiable lately. Thor had commented on it only a week ago.
“Okay?” Steve asks.
The screech roused him out of a deep slumber, but it still took too long for him to react, for him to stumble out of the bed, because the tangled around his sheets. Steve pitched forward onto the floor of the bedroom and shook himself, rubbing at his eyes and forcing his way past the groggy feeling clouding his brain. His arms tingled as he pushed up from the floor and stopped. He hung there, between kneeling and laying prone, as the room looped around him. The serum wasn’t working fast enough, not nearly fast enough to replace what he’d given Tony. Yet, Tony had been hungry, so insatiably hungry that Steve would do it again, in a heartbeat. The nausea came over him as he waited out the dizzy spell. It took too long as the security system screamed warnings of perimeter breach.
“Yes, Commander.”
Tony wrapped the blanket around them, pulling Steve close. At least Tony had body heat to share – though it was technically taken from Steve. Tony kissed him and whispered, “Stay with me, Steve. Stay with me.” Though his heart may be like stone, it constricted and the pressure in Tony’s chest stifled the afterglow of feeding. The idea that he may have harmed Steve, even in the stupor of orgasm, tormented Tony. The guilt tided over him as he continued his mantra. “Please, Steve, stay awake. Stay awake.”
“I can’t remember.”
“Yeah, all of us. We should give it a try,” Steve said. “I talked with Wong and he thinks it would be best if we started with some of our physical training exercises because we know how to do that and then we could add the soul pack dimensions to it.”
“Remind me never to kiss the crown of your head again,” Tony says and it raises a smile on his lips that Steve cannot deny.
“So much faith in your friend even after he betrayed you and your vampire scum?” Ross said and tilted his head. “Interesting.” He stared at his bloodstained finger. “I heard your blood is gold. Did he love to suck you dry through your cock?”
Tony drops his head and presses his fingers into his eyes. “Not many, I don’t think. We’ve gotten far into it. According to my calculations, Ultron’s encryption beyond what we had to do to hack into his brain is more basic. It might be this one and one more. That’s it.”
Tony didn’t say it. Instead he settled against Steve and they luxuriated in long lasting kisses as Steve grew hard against Tony’s leg, and the want and desire to taste him, and be part of him, manifested in Tony. Steve thrust against his leg. Tony disengaged from their kiss as his fangs grew and he felt the need to taste and bite overcome him. Steve arched his neck, exposing his pulse point where Tony had last bitten him, the wound still prominent. He shouldn’t indulge but the look of pure bliss in Steve’s face, the way his body coiled to Tony’s needs, sent him over the edge of doubt, falling into the chasm of surrender.
“They call him only by his moniker, the Lion Hunter.”
How the hell is he going to do this before all hell breaks? The leader of the terrorists is only going to believe him for a short period of time. He has to get the work done and now. Slipping off of the cot, he carefully tiptoes his way around Steve and goes to the bench. He flips through his papers, the tools, and scrap metal lying on the side of the table. He needs to fashion the suit of armor and get the hell out of here.
The harsh reality of it hurt Tony. “So you didn’t think about it at all?”
“You could tell me your name. It would be easier that way.”
Tony pressed his cheek against Steve’s shoulder. “That sounds like a good guy.”
“Luke wants to be Jedi like his father,” Steve explains as he sets the huge bowl of popcorn on the table with two bottles of water. “He blows up the Death Star at the end with the help of the cowboy with his dog.”
The room completely blotted out. Tony couldn’t see or feel his own body. All he knew was Steve. Tangled and knotted together, their souls interlaced, merging into something new, something different, something more. For a bold moment, Steve resisted and their souls retched out a red purple light and then he accepted it as Tony reached for him. Their souls celebrated, the light blinding and hot but never burning. And in that horribly beautiful moment, their souls together formed a union and it pulsated joy and perfection and bliss. Everything around Tony, every sensation, was electrified. And then the world and Steve whited out.
Tony watched Bucky, watched him as a pack member, as a friend and brother to Steve. “I know.”
“You shot her.” Steve said, and his world contorted on its axis. “Twice.” He wanted to throttle Bucky. Natasha was his friend, his close friend – his Confidant – and he would do anything to protect her.
“This is standard. Sometimes the clients like you to wear something special. This time, no need.” She hands it to him. Without protesting, Steve dons the tunic. He feels more vulnerable with it on then without any clothes at all and that’s confusing. Natasha seems to read his mind. “Most of the workers feel more at ease without this tunic on – I know. I apologize but the guild makes it so that all workers should greet a client with at least the standard tunic.”
“But you said-.”
The phantom doctor’s gentle eyes soften even more. “Mister Stark, you are not mad, but you may wish to be.”
“So as not to cause an international incident, you’re going to go hunt down a grown man and force him to come back?” Tony asks.
“Every seven.”
Steve peers over his shoulder. The rain and hail beat and punish the landscape – the place that Tony created for them to enter into Ultron’s domain. In front of them is something different, something odd and disturbing in its tranquility.  “What is this place?”
It takes him a good hour to get over to Foggy Bottom and weave his way through traffic to his destination. When he parks the car and heads towards the brownstone nestled between two others that seem nondescript in comparison, it is nearly 5 pm. He's never going to make it back to NY on time to see Steve. Pausing before he walks up the wisteria lined path, he brings out his phone and sends a text to Steve. It's the only way he's ever been able to get in touch with the man. It took Tony some finagling to get the hooker to give him any contact information.
He tries not to think the trite idea that tonight is special. Buttoning the shirt, he finds a nice embroidered kerchief, one his mother made for him years ago with blue stitched along the edges. Steve ties it around his throat and checks his reflection in the cracked mirror. The split images mock him. He frowns; he shouldn’t get his hopes up. He’s not courting, he can never court a man.
Later when he arrives at the Tower and steps out into the penthouse, several people greet him in the main living room area. “Oh.” He hates intruding on Tony’s guests, especially since Steve’s classified as one of the staff, not a friend. “Sorry, I’ll just go to my room.”
With a quick gliding motion, Steve thrusts in and the feeling nearly sends him into shock. It’s so tight and so strong and he’s over the moon with need that he swoons a little before he’s able to get his head wrapped around the sensation. “Oh baby, sweet one, you feel divine. You feel so tight, so powerful.” He stays motionless and tears streak Tony’s face.
“Yeah, I want it so much. You’re perfect. I need more I need to feel you.”
Natasha smiles. “Yes. I can show you there. I want to scrub you and get you shaved too. I usually do all the new workers, if that’s okay. Then I’ll dress you, okay?”
“We already knew that Sokovia had been supplied with Stark Industries weapons,” Maria said as she crossed from what Steve spied might be command center to the kitchen. “But this is a personal issue that you will need to deal with.”
“And we don’t have Doctor Erskine to figure it out. All we have is Stark and he doesn’t have a clue. Do you know he thinks that your friend Barnes might actually have been turned into some kind of alpha. He thinks he’s in some kind of cycle?” Phillips jabbed his finger on the desk and then shook his head again. “No, I can’t have you going in there. He has to stay confined.”
He leans over and groans as he strains his shoulder. He needs to ignore the pain, because he’ll need to lead both horses across the water. Grabbing his rope, he throws the end to Tony.
“Shit, Steve,” Tony said and brought Steve’s knuckles to his lips. He kissed his love’s fingers. “You earned it. God, you went through so much.”
“Water?” Steve asks and wonders how long he’s been out of it. His lips feel cracked and his tongue sticks to the roof of his mouth.
Blu roars.
I hope you enjoyed this little story. I really wanted to write a story where Steve and Tony talked, listened, and came together.
“Yes. Yes.” Tony waves at him as if even that takes too much strength.
Tony learns not to ask about it. He did once and Steve lashed out.
“Oh, nice to meet you.” Steve shakes hands with both Rhodey (who he learns is James) and Carol (who he learns is also in the Air Force). He eyes Tony, noticing that he’s not wearing his glasses.
Steve almost remarks that he feels like a creep but swallows his words. “I’m going to go and get my sketch pad from my room. I like to draw a little before I sleep.”
“But you could be so much more.” As soon as it’s out of his mouth, he wants to chew his words and swallow them back. He shakes his head, grasps his hands open and closed. “You know what I mean.”
Natasha surprised him though. She shuffled a bit and then smiled. “No reason to be.”
The last jolts Steve and he nearly forgets himself and reacts, but at the last minutes he freezes and clenches his jaw. Of course, Tony would have had an urgency. It would be logical. He would have shared it with someone, someone other than Steve. It hurts like a bolt to the head.
The smile that found its way to Steve’s lips must have shocked Rumlow because the agent growled out a curse and then shouted a new protocol number. Pain hazed his understanding of what Rumlow was doing. The nanite rack twisted his limbs and he cried out, though through gritted teeth.
Tony quirks a brow at him. There’s a lot of uncertainty in his voice. Tony wonders if Army boy is some kind of spy boy, really – a really bad one, too.  “If you say so.”
“You could disappoint me, Steven, I think you even might,” Fury says with a grumble. “Don’t.”
Blu puts a paw over Tony’s shoulders, though not laying all his arm’s weight there. He licks at Tony and then with the other paw, scoops up some water and throws it in his face. Tony slips but falls right into Blu’s grasp. With a gentle swat Blu dunks Tony in the water, and then throws himself into the stream as well. They wrestle, but Blu is always considerate of Tony’s injured side and his arm. After a while, they just splay out in the water, Tony against Blu, and let the stream cascade over them.
Pepper put her finger to her lips to tell him to stay quiet. He went to join her on the ratty couch. Natasha sat in the only recliner but stayed on the edge staring at the television as if she might do it harm with just her gaze. Thor hung close to the newel post of the railing to the staircase. He and Natasha were still at odds over Loki’s containment. Over near the corner of the living room, at the boarded up windows, Bruce stood. His eyes flitted around the room.
“Sure? Why not?” Tony said and grinned as Steve shook his head.
He had lifted a shoulder. “It wasn’t hard to piece together.” He picked at his eyes as if to clean them from sleep, but it wasn’t sleep – it wiped away the tears. “I just wanted to remember something, Captain. I wanted to have some of my life back. JARVIS told me some of it, what he could.”
“I’m part of that, I’m sure,” Tony replied and stepped closer. “This is going to be difficult for us no matter what we promise or what we say.” Steve didn’t immediately answer. Instead he focused on scrubbing the pot in the sink. The muscles of his bicep worked as he cleared away the burnt food.  His concentration drew Tony to his side. He placed a hand on Steve’s shoulder.  “What’d that pot ever do to you?”
“Surely.”
“House arrest?” Steve says and then he thinks about how Scott talked – how he relished speaking about his little girl. How bright his eyes would get and Clint would lean in and listen, adding his own thoughts and memories. “Let me think about it?”
“Okay,” Tony agrees. It’s probably not going to have what he needs.
He spins on his heels. “I mean that alternate realities and different dimensions could exist, intermingle, and warp through that connection. The tesseract is a doorway. Red Skull harnessed it’s energy as a power source for weapons, but what if – what if exposure causes doorways to open, not only through space but through dimensions?”
Thor turned saturnine. He bowed his head and then said, “You must understand your responsibilities. Just as I have come to understand my own.” He faced Steve. “I have come to know that I cannot leave Asgard and the Realms without a protector. My father sits on a precarious throne. While I shun the throne, Ragnorak, the end of all things, will be upon us and I am destine to try and stop it. Yet, I sit here and protect only Midgard. Am I the protector I should be? Have I lost my way for the love of one woman?”
“I’m not,” Steve promises, lying, and Buck closes his eyes and stills. Steve queries Bruce and the doctor only hushes him.
“No. I want to do this. Can I drop my stuff in my room first?”
As the meeting participants disperse, Steven stands sentinel over Tony – keeping an eye on the proceedings. Tony and Jamison discuss a few details of the meeting and the follow up that will take place after dinner. As they finish, Jamison glances at Steven and then back at Tony. He leans into Tony and speaks into his ear, “I don’t know what he did, but you have to set this right.”
Tony laughs and gets to work right away. Steve leaves the whole chicken in the sink and washes it. Then he finds a roasting pan and brings out a bag of herbs and spices. With some olive oil and butter brushed on the skin, he rubs the herbs on the breast and legs.
“Oh.” Bruce scratched at his day-old beard. “Do you think he needs to talk to someone?”
“I think he already said that,” Tony says.
Tony peers over his shoulder. “You don’t like popsicles?”
Steve nods. “Yeah, not a lot of water on that dump. Don’t get me wrong. I had a lot of friends there, still do. But since the war there’s nothing. No food, no water. People just eking by.”
“You weren’t trained?” Tony asks and he’s more than aghast. It should have been in the file. Pep probably already knows this little fact, thus the reason she’s been so irritated with his choice. “At all?”
“I could, months, I could go months.”
“Because of Tony Stark,” Steve says and shakes his head. “How can this possibly be that bad?” Steve knows his history, he understands what’s at stake with each soul.
Steve rubs at his shoulders and softens his voice, “I’m here for you. Remember.”
Tony peered up from his hiding place and winked at Steve. “Not if I save you first.”
Steve nods. “Yep. We have regular, chocolate, and strawberry?”
Steve heads toward the horizon, walking past Natasha who only whispers, “See you in a minute.” He nods at her words.
Tony chokes and pitches upward, but then slumps into the mud and snow, falling unconscious again. Light snow flutters all around them, coating the ground with a white silvery sheen.
“Are you telling me to hack into SHIELD in order to find out where the Captain is being housed?”
Just to tell you the slow burn doesn't mean the you will do without romance. It will be there, just not the way you thought. Also - next chapter - Tony discovers something about himself that leaves him more isolated than before!
Mechanically, Steven eats but Tony can tell he’s not enjoying it. He hopes it isn’t a requiem on his situation but that he’s engrossed in his role – working out who is who in the world and what needs to be done to support and protect Tony and the Stark family. It had better be a strong sense of fealty and loyalty from the omega to his alpha.
“You’re delirious.”
It doesn’t surprise Tony when they climb back up the hill again, but this time it’s a milder slope. The terrain turns lush and verdant. Gone is the dusty rocky landscape, replaced by a thin cropping of trees with undergrowth, and, if Tony’s isn’t wrong, the sound of a brook or creek not far. Blu leads him to the small brook. It’s serene and pretty. It’s not a deep water source. If he waded in it, it would probably only come up to his knees at its deepest.
Steven considers Tony only briefly, and then opens the door to the mansion after they walk up the wide stone steps and across the porch. “I’m sorry, I assumed you enjoyed the protocol. After all you’ve spent quite a bit of time driving it home.”
But Steve shoves against Tony’s hand and gets up on his elbows. “I’m only as clean as my last test, Tony. I’m a prostitute. Use the condom. I – We can’t lose you.” It hurts in every way to say it, to admit these words but Tony acquiesces partially due to Steve’s pleading with him.
“He’s got increased metabolism and improved homeostasis. Her thing is neuro-electric interfacing and telekinesis, mental manipulation.” Maria gave a little shrug. “He’s fast and she’s weird.”
“That’s what you hope, but your stock is bound to take a hit. You know that, it’s one of the reasons you’ve been hiding this, for what? Ten years. Just the fact that you were able to so successfully manage to hide something like being blind is an accomplishment in and of itself, but the fact that you are the major force behind your company’s advancements, that knocks it out of the park.” She barely acknowledges Steve; all her energy is focused on Tony. “So, let me help you with your little problem.”
“Ultron could want to do that.” The pitiful light from the lantern flickers and casts Tony is bluish relief against the windscreen of the cockpit. “If he’s delaying us, then there’s a reason for that delay. He mustn’t have all the defenses he needs.”
“I won’t.” Tony has the gauntlet on and he’s out the thick steel door in seconds before Steve can wish him well.
He mouths a word, but Steve doesn’t catch it.
Tony should apologize. He doesn’t. “It concerns Captain America.”
“Funny, you’re hilarious,” Steve returned. “You can get out a book or a newspaper or something.”
“Exquisite.”
Ever since that stupid dinner he’d had with Tony, things had gone wrong. He found it harder and harder to keep his head on straight. It wouldn’t do, not with tons of missions coming up. Fury, Natasha, even Rumlow and the Strike Team depended on him. He needed to get his head in the game. He smashed a fist into the bag and it flew off the chain, striking the brick wall, and exploding all over the floor. It joined the three others – sacrifices to Steve’s mental instability.
Steve grabs it and pushes it into the port on his implant. It stings but it will allow him the access he needs.
“How far to your friend’s place?”
“A Prime pairing, my friend, is the myth of the true pairing.” T’Challa sits close to him and strokes his hair from his damp face. “It is a story my grandfather once told me.”
Tony locates the table based on Steve’s signal and instruction that it’s a booth. He slides onto the seat. Steve takes the bench seat across from him. The waitress comes over and hands them both menu until she figures out that Tony’s blind.
“You can’t barely breath without making noise, I don’t think you’re ready to stand up.” Tony ignores Steve’s request and starts rifling through his backpack. “Unfortunately, the game has done a job on my backpack.”
Clint half grinned. “If you can’t trust Captain America, who can you trust?”
“Ah! Admit it! You admitted we are now officially in a relationship.” Playing with Steve cuts the tension and it concerns him that this little tangent might derail them, but it doesn’t.
Blu looks him dead square in the face and lifts an eyebrow – or what passes as a tuft of hair above his eye pretending to be a brow.
What would they think of him? How would they judge him? How would his childhood hero judge him? Letting them in and letting them know his weaknesses - no. That could not be.
Steve smiles. “Oh, that’s not necessary.”
Natasha scrutinized each of them before replying, “Well that’s going to be a little difficult considering he hasn’t even met two of the pack members – not really. And we’d have to get them here.”
Deciding that he needs a better view, he starts to stand up but Steve scuttles after him. The sounds he makes are closer to words but not formed due to the rod in his mouth preventing him from speaking.
Steve glares up at the man. Two choices loom before him. Trust Obie and tell him the truth. Don’t trust him and take the fall. The choice is easy. Protecting Tony is part of the job. He won’t humiliate the prince. “It’s none of your business.”
Rumlow jerks his chin. “Fine. Good. You blow me.” He chuckles. “Fuck, you gotta be good. Those lips look divine. Must be if the prince keeps you blowing him.”
“No, you.”
The trade routes are in chaos, the Rims are fighting off incursions from alien races, and Asgard is still lobbying for assistance from the Dark Elves invasion. “At least with the Main Chamber things worked.”
“Oh, oh,” Tony says and then gestures at Steve. “Look at him.” He needs to face the guy again. “Sorry – I – he needs first aid. Do you have anything?”
Natasha demanded entrance and he almost said no, but it was Pepper who smiled at him on that spring morning in late March telling him that he couldn’t avoid the consequences of his past. It ruffled him a bit to hear her put it like that – she didn’t like Iron Man, she didn’t like the danger it put him in and he could understand it, but still Iron Man felt like an integral part of who he would always be. It wasn’t something to be ashamed of.
“Okay but tell me where I’m going.” Steve hangs close to Tony as they head toward the elevator. Once again, they manage the access to the lift similar to the way they did through the doorway. It works a little smoother when Tony just uses his hand at the small of Steve’s back.
“I didn’t do anything. He bonded with me. He named me Beloved. Beloved-.” Tony leaned in, trying to tear away Becky’s hand, see his face. “Do you understand what that means? Beloved? He loves me. He’s the center of everything for the pack – but for me. He’s the missing part of my soul and I’m that missing part of his. He can’t do this without me. Regardless of what he says, the stupid shit. He can’t! For him it would be like-.” Tony pointed at Becky’s left shoulder where his arm should be. “-like losing a limb. Do you want that for him? Is that what you want?”
Tony thinks
“Yeah, about that.” Tony starts to make coffee. “Not the date.” He pulls down some mugs. “The tesseract. We need to talk about it. How it works.”
“I have boots or my beat-up sneakers.” The boots are ridiculous and for riding his motorcycle with steel tips, but his sneakers are torn. Boots it is. He briefly weighs whether or not he should just ride his bike to the gala. Giving him a quick out has its merits, but then driving a motorcycle all the way to the gala negates getting dressed up. Cab it is. He sits down on a box and digs out his boots from another box. He puts them on; they don’t mess up the line of the slacks too much.
“It’s gonna work,” Sam says.
Tony settles into the chair, leaning back but Steve is the one to trigger the mechanism to help him recline. “Thanks.” Tony thinks he might say it out loud but when he gets these types of headaches it’s nearly impossible to tell. His hearing roars in his head and he feels like every nerve in his body tingles.
Steve shakes his head as he retrieves towels and robes for them. “Let’s go to the main room and put on the projection.” He offers Tony a towel who takes a second before accepting it and getting out of the bath. “We can have JARVIS project the beach at night.”
It isn’t Steve who answers – he can’t supply an answer anyhow. But Tony steps back into the room and says, “I might have the answer to that one. It’s a Collapsing Event, do you know what that means?”
Steve tightened his lips as he tried to suppress a smile. “You like it?”
Tony presses a hand on his chest. “Not exactly.” He jingles the wires connecting them. “We kind of did that together.”
“It wasn’t,” Jarvis says and leads Steve into the well-appointed front parlor. “If you will, sir. I will be serving breakfast in the dining room. The washroom is through those doors. You may hang your hat and coat in there as well.” He points to the kitchen – Steve’s been in the house before, knows the furniture, the décor which always showed a certain softness due to Sue’s influence.
Tony shakes his head. “No, you have to tell me.”
. He forces it down like a spoiled piece of meat and says, “Sure.” He swings his arms. “I’d like that.”
“Do you love me? It’s a simple question. Why can’t you answer it?” Tony says and there’s a new flush to his cheeks as his emotions rise.
“True. But Ultron remember is my dreamed up child,” Tony says and there’s a bit of smugness in his voice that irritates Steve. Tony reads Steve’s stiff body language easily enough. He puts up a hand. “That means that he’s willing to let things play out because he’s curious. We just have to make sure we don’t give away the farm – pun intended – as we play his game.”
Steve smiled. “Well, I will try and not get him too upset.”
Grabbing it, Tony slips out the door. He’s quiet as not to wake up Steve. He presses the makeshift doorbell and waits as he sees the flashes under the door. It takes a while but Clint appears. He’s still in his pajama pants but the robe is gone. Tony lifts the first aid kit and says, “I brought them back.”
“Where’s the med team?”
Tony launches himself at Blu. With those broad shoulders and strong arms, the man catches him, lifts him easily off his feet, and spins him around. If there was ever a time, Tony felt like a Disney Princess it is now. He nestles his head against Blu’s neck they stand in embrace.
The clock ticks.
Tony huffs and shakes his head. A rueful smile touches his lips. “I didn’t like it.”
“Good. Because I love you, too,” Steve whispers. The rest of the night is theirs, and theirs alone.
“No don’t put it back in. Just put it over there, we have to hurry.”
Richards voice on the recording chimes in
Before they get to the entrance to the room, Steve hears the clank of silverware and the din of people talking.  Steve sucks in his breath. A cold tide crushes him as if he’s drowning in the frigid Arctic waters. Walking through the door means facing Tony, seeing his hopes and dreams that grew over the last two months bleed away. Inwardly he shivers and he tenses his hands into fists. He fights against it, shoving the anxiety away like he would during missions. He searches the room and doesn’t see Tony right away. Part of him relaxes but the larger part is simply disappointed.
“Exactly, sir. Soul packs are misnamed.”
He wakes up and nearly half the day is done according to his calculations based on the sun. With so little daylight, Tony doubts he progress on the HUD. He curses and levers himself up using Blu’s side as a crutch. The lion sleeps on and Tony rolls his eyes.
“It’s called The Legend of Blu,” Steve answers, never tiring of their daughter’s queries. Morgan can already read at the ripe old age of 4 years; she’s been reading for over a year now. But she insists on a bedtime story from her Da every night.
There’s a melancholy look to Steven and he wipes away the water. “What does it matter?”
He munches on the rest of the cookies during the long ride home. When he’s fifteen minutes from the mansion his phone rings and, while Steve has never called him before, something sings in his heart that it could possibly be him (Tony tries not to think that Steve’s his boyfriend).
“That’s very generous of you, and I’m not here to judge you. I just want to make sure that Tony is getting the best care,” Steve says. The weight of everything that’s happened crushes him. It feels like a mixture of an anxiety attack and his asthma attacks. His pushes his hand in his pocket for his inhaler and realizes it’s probably still back at the island.
Pepper grimaces as she pops the old and original arc reactor out of Tony’s chest.
“I don’t need to feel the wind on my face,” Tony mutters, but Steve takes his hand and heads toward the pier. He narrates the entire walk until they get to the dock.
He feels like a shit, like he’s just murdered a puppy. He only waves the awkwardness, the pain of shame, away. Steve steps away from him and goes to the small bathroom. When he opens the door, it hits the toilet. He has to step over the toilet to shut the door, which he does. In seconds, Tony hears the water in the shower and weighs whether or not he should leave. He scrubs his hands through his hair and imagines Steve washing away the filth of another man or woman touching him. He wonders who it might be; how many others. Then his mind judders to the red head across the hall.
He starts with a gentle press of circles on Tony’s cheekbones. “Then why is it, you’ve denied being blind? I think I know I just don’t want to presume.”
The doctor chuckles in a low, almost self-deprecating manner. “Not long, according to your friends. But your deputy, Barnes, sent a telegram about a blacksmith.”
“God, I hope not,” Steve muttered. He truly hoped Sam or anyone else in the pack weren’t privy to all of his dreams. He placed a plate of cookies on the table. Sam snatched one right away and drove for the coffee like an addict.
Steve picked up the shield and the uniform he stole from the Smithsonian exhibit. “I have to be, don’t I?” He walked away from them, left Natasha and Sam to figure things out. He needed to be alone. He needed to walk away from it all. The memories kept crowding in and he wanted to forget that he was from a nearly century ago with baggage and pain and no shared life experiences.
Tony hushed him, holding him close as he processed the information. He continued to talk, to supply more of the story as he lightly caressed and kissed Steve.
Steve released a breath. “Good, then we go.”
Jarvis appears at the doorway.
“Where?”
Even though the civilians were only decoys – electronic signatures created by JARVIS – it still bothered Steve to hear the report. He never wanted civilians to be in the line of fire. “Copy that,” Steve answered. “Go!”
Tony scoffs. “You are far too cautious my friend. We are out in the wilderness.” Tony gestures with one hand while clutching onto the horn of the saddle’s pummel with the other.
In the end they decide on a rugged beach with the ocean splashing against the shore. According to JARVIS the scene is a projection from a planet in the Stark Systems – one the Tony has his own mansion on. In the distance from where the table’s set an image of a beautiful white curving mansion can be seen. The virtual reality of the simulation astounds Steve.
He rushed over to her then, grasping her hands and holding them to his chest. “Don’t listen to me. That’s semantics. I love you. Pepper, please. Don’t do this to us.”
“You always wanted to be a martyr.” If it’s an accusation it doesn’t have teeth in it.
Over the course of the morning, Tony and Natasha got Steve to dress and to eat – though only an egg and toast seemed a little too small for a super soldier’s metabolism. Later, Sam reported that Peggy would be interned in England and her funeral would be held in two days’ time. Bruce worked with JARVIS to schedule the private jet and Tony arranged the hotel reservations. Steve went through his daily routine, punching bags, running Central Park, and answering lingering questions about SHIELD’s collapse. On the surface, Steve remained cool and calm, but the storm boiled underneath the surface. He held it back but even when he clearly tried to cut the rest of the pack off with chanting the Mantra, his pain and denial seeped through the links. More often than not, Tony sought him out to try and alleviate it, though he had no idea what to do. Not even his usual resources like Pepper and Rhodey gave him strong direction about what to do and how to handle Steve. Neither of them was part of the pack and didn’t have much understanding on how something like a soul bond worked. In the end he succumbed to asking Strange for help.
Steven gazes directly up at Tony. His eyes are motes that are not readable. “I’m not sure what you’d like me to say, my lord.” The last is hissed more than anything else and Tony frowns at it. “I’ve been to the Purge, yes. Anyone with any knowledge of the Purge knows that its history and its name comes from the Great Purge.”
Steve shrugs and says, “I think you know most of it. The tesseract caused me to come back as a lion.”
“Tell me you’re not curious why Fury knows so much about soul packs. How SHIELD can test to confirm. They are using soul packs and spreading lies that it’s just a myth. They want to control you.”
She glares at Steve and he tries to suppress his smile but can’t. Tony’s done everything he promised her. The work with Pym holds promise not only for visually impaired people, but also hearing impaired like her brother. The nanotechnology could even solve the issue of paralysis. She’s only using her forum as a means to keep the crowd revved up and attuned to her. He knows it and so does she. He quirks a brow at her and then with a hand to Tony’s back turns to enter the clinic.
“Yeah,” Steve said distractedly. He needed sleep. He needed to think about what had happened and why. “He’s different. You said.” He rubbed at his face and wished she would go, leave. He ached for sleep, for release. He wanted to lose himself.
It makes no sense to Steve; Ultron had been trying to use it as a strategy to knock Steve out of the battle. Steve hesitates. Can Ultron construct Tony? Would Steve know the difference?
“A glitch. Give it a minute.” Tony holds his gauntleted hand down and waits.
“Yeah, they have ‘em still. Not a lot of people know about them. But I do. Out beyond even the Purge Rim. Stalls of omegas, strapped up and ready for use. Any time you fuck them they come. They want to be treated like objects, I’m telling you. Stalls are the future.” He laughed then and that was the beginning of Tony’s training.
“You’re right about that. This is a big issue, but we did overreact. Pepper knows it, I know it. And Tony didn’t want to see you gone. In fact, I know personally and painfully he asked about you incessantly.” Rhodes sticks out his hand. “So, please accept my apology.”
“Yeah,” Steve says and doesn’t look up from the crackers.
The scarlet flames engulfed the train as the other passengers sobbed for help. He raced to retrieve his shield yet never got there. The side of the train, the actual metal of it, peeled back, screeching as it did. The flares of red energy licked at the sides and then pierced it, opening it like a tin can. Steve grabbed at his bag, but before he could free his shield the searing red energy reached out, away from the metal and, instead, wound around him. It neither burned nor froze, yet every nerve of his body protested, screamed in agony. His core, his soul came alive bright with white blinding light. He couldn’t control it.
This time they discovered Steve in the bathroom of the little restaurant they had eaten shawarma at so many years ago after the Battle of New York. He stood at the tiny sink, yanking the fabric of his pitiful uniform away from an ugly burn on his side. Not all of them could fit in the phone booth sized bathroom, so Tony shoved forward and pushed inside.
“It’ll work with people who don’t make being a double agent a profession.”
“So, Sheriff, I hear you need your horse taken care of?” Stark digs into the meal with not a small amount of appetite. The amount he stuffs away competes with what Steve can haul off and clean up in a sitting.
“You’re not my toy, I know you’re not my toy.” Steve marches out of the room and into the bathroom entrance. “Steve! Steve! I’m speaking to you. Come back here!” Steve stops, his hands in fists. He turns back to Tony. “I hate to point out the obvious, but you are, in fact, a hooker! And you happen to be under a contract with me and therefore part of my crew!”
"Yes, Stane had his goons kidnap me. It wasn't pretty and I'll bear the scars for the rest of my life, such as it is." Tony lays a hand on his chest, subconsciously, and Steve furrows his brows as he sees a certain pallor, and sorrow shift over the usually exuberant man. He snaps out of it. "Now, Captain, eat, we have much to talk about and more to plan."
The meeting dissipated and Tony whispered his release word. Steve slowly stood up, held Tony in his big strong arms. His words were faint, heavy, groggy. “That went better than expected.”
Bucky starts back down the hall, the prisoners in the cells hoot and scream at him. Redwing flies in front and swoops back and forth. The bird keeps an eye out for any threats. As soon as Bucky gets to the corner with his precious bundle the bird sweeps back in and whistles. Bucky’s heard the whistles, chirps, and caws a thousand times and can interpret them – maybe not as well or as fast as Sam can – but still he knows what the basic communication is. With Steve in a bridal carry, Bucky marches forward and tries to hurry his steps. They are on the lowest level and he’s certain he saw a garbage shoot and a sewer outlet to the outside of the fortress not far from the prison block in the schematics. Redwing keeps crisscrossing and flying back and forth to scan the area for risks and threats. They make it a few meters, stop and wait as Redwing checks again. His bundle stays silent in his arms and Bucky wonders how very weak Steve is. How will he ever recover?
“You’re happy? Settled down like this?” Steve thought about the brand on Clint’s arm and the guilt welled up enough that the acrid taste of bile filled his mouth.
“He’s good to me, yes,” Tony says and there’s a faraway look in his eyes. Several minutes later, Tony folds the blankets away and reaches for Steve’s hand. He doesn’t say anything when Steve clasps his fingers, feeling his knuckles, rough and callused palm.
Smiling, Steve notices the glint of Tony’s ring against his own. He’s glad they finally did it, though it had never been something he needed to know that Tony is his and he is Tony’s. It was an event and Steve had to deal with the craziness of the paparazzi. He’s still not as good as Tony is with it. Even blind, Tony can flash a smile and the room wilts in his stead. Steve always feels awkward with no idea what to do with his hands. He feels like a big ape most of the time, especially since he no longer plays the part of Tony’s Personal Assistant. Which reminds him, Clint will be here any minute, looking to help Tony get ready for his appointment.
"Bucky!" Steve cried, twisting around just as another bubble of purple light burst from T'Challa's suit. Steve quickly jumped out of the way, his heart in his throat as he watched it take out at least a dozen of the war dogs before dissipating.
"I am unable to get a completely accurate count while you are in motion, sir, but if I had to guess I'd say there are at least twenty remaining functional suits," answered JARVIS.
Phillips said after a short pause, his eyes intense. "It's
"Then—?"
"Mmm, if you say so." Peter bit down on his bottom lip, glancing between Tony and Steve. "But how am I ever gonna be a hero like you guys if I can't keep from getting hurt every single time?" he asked, nearly tearing Tony's heart down the middle.
They were also informed that it would be none other than Anthony Stark who would be overseeing those simulator sessions, which meant that Steve had to decide now whether or not he was going to try and pretend that Anthony didn't exist, or give into his growing curiosity and make an honest attempt to get to know him. He couldn't help but have noticed that as self-conscious and awkward as he'd been when they ran into each other the previous day, Anthony seemed to have been just as flustered.
“Ahh, yeah?  So?” Tony says, his cheeks no doubt the colour of Mags’s marinara sauce.  “I’m allowed to notice when a guy’s got a particularly nice set of forearms, aren’t I?”
don't want you to mess this up!"
that!"
"Apparently Secretary Pierce got there first," said Bruce. "Anyway, we're assuming that both Gill and Bench were taken to that Mongolian base, and—"
"Too late!" Thanos suddenly growled, catching the gauntlet just before it would've passed over his fingertips. Launching Gamora and Dad off to opposite sides, he immediately grabbed onto Mantis's leg, throwing her from his shoulders. Then he ripped off Dr Strange's ropes and leaped towards Peter, grabbing him around the neck.
—said as he landed on the grass about five metres away. "Now, quickly tell me how we can dispose of this rather troublesome creature!"
"Yeah, yeah. Don't mention it."
“Well, Captain… Rogers, was it?  I must say that that’s a very tragic story.  However,” and he dragged his eyes over to Tony, narrowing them into slits, “I’m still unsure as to what any of this has to do with me.  So unless you have something else that’s of interest, I'm afraid that I must ask you all to leave now so that Tony and I can—”
"No, he doesn't like it," Steve said with a sigh. "I'm starting to think we shouldn't've let him start training with us. I think it's been giving him false hope."
And, even worse, out here, out from under the strict, watchful eyes of his and Gwen's families, Peter was finding it harder and harder to keep his hands to himself. Papa had given him a ton of lectures on how to be a gentleman ever since he and Dad got married, and Peter had taken them all to heart. But those wise words were currently locked in an intense battle with the desire coursing through his body, and the last thing Peter wanted was to come off as creepy or pushy during he and Gwen's first real date in months.
"I am." Steve's arm tightened even more, his lips brushing along Tony's temple and neck. "I'm also feeling very relaxed and satisfied at the moment."
"Oh, you know. It's going," said Peter. "How's New Asgard?"
“Ah, Captain Rogers,” the man said, far too conversationally for Steve’s taste.  “I see you’ve finally regained consciousness.”
"Okay, good," said Steve. He reached for a bottle of superwater, running his sleeve across his sweaty forehead. "I'm gonna—"
"Eh, you know," Peter said with a shrug. "We're hanging in there."
"Tours of the new X-302s will begin in the northeast hangar tomorrow during your normal briefing hours, which your current patrol schedules have been altered to reflect," Phillips said once Tony was finished. "Unless there are any further questions, you are all dismissed."
"Yeah, that's exactly what they're doing," Steve said as he turned to King T'Challa. "Your Highness? I really think we need to keep them in front of us."
Tony frowned.  That couldn't be right.  “Okay, but you told me that there were eighteen thousand units sitting in that warehouse, yeah?”
"Hopefully not just once," Tony said as he curled his hands around Steve's shoulders, tugging him down so he could kiss him, his need to get Steve out of his clothes nearly all-consuming. As Steve's lips kissed across his neck and down to his collarbones, Tony slipped his hands underneath Steve's tight blue t-shirt, making a thoroughly embarrassing noise as his fingers found Steve's skin.
"Oh," said Peter. "That's pretty early."
"Well, then, how 'bout you eat your breakfast and I'll come back once I'm done with my other patients, okay?" said Ms Sharon. "We'll see if we can find those handsome eyes of yours again, hmm?"
he thought, with a lot more intensity than he felt at the moment.
Tony cried as he suddenly came so hard that he nearly blacked out, clutching Steve's shoulders as he rode out the overwhelming onslaught of sensation. Then he pitched forward, practically melting against Steve's broad chest as the post-coital warm fuzzies overtook him, pulling him down into their drowsy depths. He only vaguely noticed as Steve shifted them so they were lying down, tugging the throw blanket over them as he kissed the top of Tony's head.
"It's all right, Captain Barnes," Tony said, shooting a wink in Steve's direction. "Like I said, I didn't expect any of you to make it on the first try." He checked over his controls, his tongue peeking between his lips like it often did when he was concentrating. "Looks like you were only zero point three seconds off, Captain, so it should be an easy fix."
"Yeah, I guess I see how that could work," said Quill.
"No! There's no way I'm gonna just—!"
"Aww, honey," Tony murmured against his chest. His calloused palms slipped underneath Steve's shirt to glide up his back, sending ribbons of warmth shooting throughout Steve's body. "You know you can always get me to do anything when you start talking like that."
Even the fact that Peter was the one who had figured out where HYDRA had taken Papa after they arrested him back in May didn't seem to matter. Without his goofy spider-vision that had enabled him to see through the retro-reflective panels surrounding the building, Papa may very well have been dead by the time Dad and the rest of the team managed to locate him.
"No," it said. "How could you be worthy of such power? You're all killers."
As always, I can’t wait to see what you think!  Don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment!  💖
Tony shuddered, squeezing Steve's hand as he tried to not think about a tiny and sickly baby Steve trying to survive on the tough streets of Langara.
Peter cried. "Where the hell are we going? And why didn't you wanna go anywhere when my dad was still here?"
Dad's eyes narrowed as he stared at Papa's shaking chin. "Well, you're just gonna have to figure out a way then, 'cause it's not gonna happen. There is absolutely no way in
“It appears that the STRIKE team chain of command ends with Agent Rumlow, sir,” JARVIS finally said.
"Well…" Steve said as he grabbed the hard chair shoved into the corner, dragging it next to Peter's bed. "Do you mind if I sit down?"
"Right now I really don't give a damn, Pete," Dad stated, his armoured fingers combing through Peter's messy hair. "We can figure something else out."
There was a loud
"Yeah. Well, anyway… I um…" Tony broke off, swallowing as he tried to reign in the wide smile stretching across his lips. "I've kinda got a date tonight, and—"
"Why can't you just come out later with Steve? That's what he wanted to do?"
"That's ridiculous," Steve said with a frown.
"Thank you, JARVIS," Steve said.
With a frustrated sigh, Tony checked the time.  Steve had told him that he sometimes used Sunday and Monday mornings to run errands, so there was a chance that he was out doing other things.
His boyfriend who was not only drop-dead gorgeous, but also hotter than hell.  And for someone who before Tony had been even purer than the ice he’d been discovered in, Steve was also the most generous lover that Tony had ever been with, going out of his way to ensure that Tony never doubted just how cherished he was.
Steve flinched as the first sleek blue shots fired by the Wakandan warriors zoomed across the plain, aiming for the incoming warg-like war dogs. Above him, Sam and James swerved and dipped as they skirted along the very edge of the force shield. As James flew, he released small bombs from the back of his armour, trying to keep the war dogs that managed to break through the shield from advancing.
Peter offered Gwen his arm as they stepped through the doors, grateful that he'd at least remembered to bring his earplugs to help dull down the booming music. It was just after 8pm, which meant he had about forty-five minutes before he'd have to leave. He had purchased a cheap plane ticket to Savannah, Georgia during school earlier that day which departed from JFK Airport at 1030pm, so Peter was going to have to hustle in order to get there on time. He had already cloned his phone, hiding the duplicate underneath a loose floor tile in one of the boys' restrooms, and had stashed a change of clothes in his locker so he wouldn't have to wear his nice suit on the plane. His new black Spider-Man suit was already underneath his clothes, with the mask tucked down inside the neckline.
"Me either. So, just so you can get used to saying it, who are we going in to see now?"
The pizza was delicious, hot and gooey and covered in toppings, and once Peter had finished his third slice and downed his second cup of Dr Pepper, he was even able to smile as the girls continued their gushing over Thor and Captain America.
"Yeah, I am," answered Tony, rather petulantly. "I made some new adjustments to the hand lasers and a few other things that'd been bugging me. I also played with the colour settings a bit, made the red a bit darker. And you're getting a new uniform too, by the way. I'm experimenting with a new type of Kevlar blend that would offer a lot more buoyancy than the stuff I'm using now, so if you ever wind up in the water again you hopefully won't just sink like a rock, and—"
"Yeah."
"Copy that!" Sam said from somewhere behind Steve, his dual guns firing into a horde of Chitauri foot soldiers. "But do we even know where the hell it is?"
One might also think that maybe the death of his wife at the hands of a drunk driver might actually shock Howard into giving up his own excessive Scotch habit, but that didn't end up being the case either.
Now, he can barely stand the sight or smell of it.  Can barely stand the sound of ice cubes as they slide against each other in the tray inside his freezer, or in the big cups of Coca Cola that he and Peter like to get whenever Steve picks him up from school.
"JARVIS—!" Tony gasped, intending to summon his armour just as Bucky came through the door. He hurried behind Peter and wrapped his arms around him, pinning his arms to his sides and whispering something that Tony couldn't quite catch into his ear. Peter screamed again, struggling for a few more seconds before finally going limp in Bucky's arms. Bucky hesitated for a moment, then gave Tony a nod as he carefully cradled Peter's bloody arm.
"Yeah," Steve said. He gave his head a light shake before setting the datapad aside, settling in on Peter's opposite side and draping his arm across Peter's waist. "I'm sure we'll hear all about it in the morning."
"Yeah, mostly."
"Um… why does she think it'll help us feel better to talk to an Air Corps pilot?"
"Okay, so, let
"Um…" Bucky said a few heartbeats later, poking Steve in the arm. "In order to actually 'go', you kinda have to, you know,
"Yeah, yeah, so you say," Tony muttered. He bit down on his bottom lip, contemplating. In all of his research into the effects of essentially going back to the past, he hadn't been able to answer this particular question to his liking.
Steve nodded. "Yes. I'd—I'd
"All right," said Steve. He tipped his head back, allowing himself a small sigh of relief.
And now the cool metal tags resting against Tony's skin were a constant reminder of his desire to be reunited with his soldier.
"Freeze!" Chief Stacy called, emptying at least five shots directly into the monster's head before he realised that they were having absolutely no effect on it at all. His hands dropped to his sides, his face a mixture of shock and awe as he looked up at Peter just as the monster slammed its fist down onto the floor, sending a rippling wave of lava-covered floor directly at Chief Stacy and slamming him against the busted-up remains of the opposite wall.
"Pete?" Dad said as he came up behind him, squinting at the floor. "Is he still there?"
But that was three months ago, and this was now.  And
And while he was still trying to maintain a brave face in front of Dad and the rest of his family and friends, as the days dragged on with absolutely no progress, Peter had to admit he was starting to lose hope that they would ever find Papa.
"Thank you." Steve waited until Stacy and his young partner had crossed the street before he and Tony exited the coffee shop, heading back towards the Tower.
"Oh, you were?" Peter said, his face falling. "Do you have to?"
And even now, over three months later, it was still hard for him to admit just how close he had come to never seeing them again.
True to his word, not even five minutes later Steve had reappeared in the garage, looking as dashing as ever in a blue long-sleeved t-shirt that exactly matched his eyes, and a pair of fitted jeans that showed off his magnificently round ass to perfection.
"No, there weren't only two doses made, Tony," Howard said as he came up next to Colonel Phillips. Steve clenched his jaw, fighting the strong urge to step in front of Tony. "In fact, I made a total of six doses, but somehow only three of them made it into Langaran hands."
"Sir?"
"I expect to land in Namibia in approximately eight hours, Captain, provided that current weather conditions remain as anticipated," answered JARVIS.
"Yes, he has," said Steve. Barely a second later he had slid off the bed and had almost reached the bathroom door when it suddenly flew open.
Peter's pale cheeks blanched even whiter as he gulped, giving Bruce a quick nod.
And why hadn't anyone ever told him that Howard Stark had created it in the first place?
Steve made a small noise in the back of his throat, thankfully only loud enough for Tony to hear. Both he and Rhodey had mentioned the possibility of the committee bringing up Bucky, and Tony had pretty much dismissed it, thinking that since the Winter Soldier had been presumed dead ever since the Project Insight mess that they wouldn't bother with it.
Biting his lip, Tony trailed his fingers down Peter's round cheek, smiling at the adorably crooked grin on his little face as he mugged for the camera. How innocent he had been back then, how blissfully ignorant of everything that was so unbelievably fucked-up in the world, as it should've been for such a tiny kid.
“Thank you, Agent Fury,” Steve said softly.  He held out his hand, which Fury eagerly shook.  “I can’t tell you how much this means.  To all of us.”
"Peter!" Steve shrieked, immediately clutching his sore chest. "Oh God, Peter, are you all right? Where's Dad, little guy, why aren't you with him?"
"Oh, very well," JARVIS said with an exaggerated sigh. "But I'm afraid not, Master Peter. The visual range is not long enough."
"Pete should be on his way back to the Tower, honey," Tony said. "But I—I think—"
“Ah huh,” Natasha says, smiling wickedly.  “And?”
Tony shot him one of Peter's
Which was good, because Steve knew how much Tony adored those cuddles. And how desperately he had missed them during the year Peter was missing.
Sam and Bucky were already standing outside the door of the restaurant when they arrived, Bucky looking a lot more like himself dressed in civilian clothes and wearing his metal prosthetic arm.  As soon as Peter saw him, he rushed over to give him a hug, the huge smile lighting up Bucky’s face making Tony swell with pride.
Tony blinked, his fingers tightening around the handle of his mug as he stared at the older man’s face, trying to figure out if he was joking or not.
"Or maybe you just unleashed one," said Steve. He waggled his eyebrows, then somehow managed to school his features into a look of pure, boyish innocence in about three seconds flat. "Turn right at the next light, then it's the third house on the left side."
"Well, that's one good thing," said Steve. "Was anyone killed inside the SHIELD building?"
“Thanks, little guy,” Steve said.
"You might say that," said Grandma. "There were many a night where I didn't leave this chair. I just sat here, watching Steven's chest as he breathed. In and out, in and out. Most of the time he sounded like he was sucking air through about a hundred layers of cheesecloth, but he still managed to survive."
"All right, honey," he said. "We can go back to bed."
"Rhodey, Sam, you with me? I got an idea."
They all entered the restaurant to find John Sheppard and Cam Mitchell already seated in the back, where the wait staff had pushed two tables together.
“JARVIS says he can’t pick up any signals, Cap,” Tony cuts in.  He swoops lower, pausing at about shoulder height.  “So unless he’s missing something, which just doesn't happen, then I don't see what we’ve got to worry about.”
"You're always starving," Natasha retorted, elbowing him in the side. "And to answer your question, yes. Pietro and I have got ya covered. JARVIS?"
"Oh yeah, piece of cake," answered Tony. "Nothing a little pressurised air can't take care of."
Peter's heart seized as first Drax, then Mantis stepped through the portal, his fingers curling into fists at his sides as his mind raced at the speed of light, trying like hell to
"Sure did, Cap," came Bruce's reply over the comm. "I'm on my way."
would've taught you better than that. Because you see, the more proper way to have answered would have been, 'good morning'. Or rather, 'good afternoon', if you want to be more specific. And, if I do say so, I think I have the right to be a little sore after you completely trashed my billion-dollar prototype! I mean, was that really necessary?"
"Yeah, but you love me anyway," Tony said with a wink as he gave Steve's ass another firm squeeze. "But if you promise to keep behaving, there'll be more where that came from later tonight."
“February 18th, 2019,” Steve continued.  “Due to rampant tissue damage caused by severe infection, Sergeant Barnes’ left arm is deemed too far gone to save.
"Hey," Tony said quietly, and a lump rose in Steve's throat at his guarded tone. He supposed it couldn't have been easy for him to call Sam like he did, knowing that it would only make Steve upset.
"Oh, sweetheart, that sounds almost too sweet for words." Steve immediately conjured up a mental picture of the precious image, filing it into its appropriate compartment so he could attempt to sketch it out later.
"Oh, come on!" he cried. Throwing out his arm, Peter blindly shot out his web, barely managing to catch the very edge of the spaceship. Grunting, he pulled himself back up to the ship, managing to find what appeared to be a panel that led into an inner level. Dad was nowhere to be seen, and neither were the wizard or alien.
"Hmph," muttered Steve. He slumped down next to Tony, obviously pondering something by the way his eyebrows were twitching.
"She was assigned to help protect me," Peter said. "She just told me this afternoon, Dad. Colonel Phillips arranged it."
"Those are some pretty impressive moves there, kiddo," said Sam, so casually that a knot rose in Tony's throat. "Who taught you all those moves?"
"Stuff like what? I'm not—I don't understand?"
And while Steve couldn’t understand why in the world Tony would think he would need space from him, according to Peter, Tony hadn't ever had a relationship that had lasted longer than a couple of months.  Even his relationship with Peter’s mother had been something of a whirlwind, ending almost as soon as it began when Tony discovered that she had been sent by a rival company to try and spy on him.  Steve had then spent the next thirty or so minutes—and two huge Dr Pepper floats—assuring Peter that he had no intention of ever leaving either of them, but understood that while Tony loved him, it was one of Tony’s self-preservation methods to always assume that his romantic partner would end up leaving him.
He was up to his eyeballs in decoded files and new suit schematics when Peter suddenly walked into the lab, exhausted and disheveled, his pale cheeks lined with tears.
Again.
"Very good sir," JARVIS said. "New Pym Particle test number one commencing in five… four… three… two… one… mark."
"Tony!" Steve cried as he thrust one final time and came, his entire broad body shaking as he spilled inside Tony, finally collapsing down half on top of him.
look grew even more pronounced. "Pete, we don't have to—"
“I let them go, Tony,” Obie said.  He let out a frustrated sigh, throwing up his hands.  “Look, those drugs were never going to be money makers for this company!  That division only existed ‘cause your dad was a sucker!”
"Um… what—what're you doing?" Quill protested as Peter and Dad headed towards the ship, Dad's hand protectively on Peter's shoulder. "Now hold on just a minute! I didn't say you could use my ship!"
But the alternative; swimming out to the prison through the choppy-as-hell, freezing cold Atlantic Ocean was absolutely
“Oh, come now, Steven!” Shostakov says, wiggling his hips.  “Word on the street is that you enjoy a good-looking man in a racing swimsuit, eh?  Even when you can only look, but not touch?”
to?" Tony asked, rather cheekily. "That maybe I actually enjoy taking care of you when you're not too busy being a stubborn fool?"
"Talk to you tomorrow?" Gwen murmured, her arms tight around Peter's neck. If he had been feeling brave he might've even tried to kiss her goodnight, but he really, really didn't feel like having his very first kiss in front of a live audience, especially since he knew that Uncle Clint would both give his dads a complete play-by-play, and never let him hear the end of it.
“Indeed he did, sir,” answered JARVIS.  “Files included are personnel, missions, and documents suspected to have ties to the former Nazi organisation, HYDRA.”
Which, not surprisingly, he did.  And a huge part of that was just how easily Peter fell in love with Steve too.  Tony had promised himself after Peter was born that he would dedicate himself to being the best father he could possibly be, breaking the cycle of shame that had haunted the Stark family for generations.  He had sworn that his old partying, playboying ways would come to an end the very moment the nurse laid his tiny son in his arms.  From that second on, Peter would always come first.
'Cause that would mean that—"
"Okay, so, reboot it," said Steve. "Send the signal again."
"Well, I promise this'll only take a minute, and then you can both be on your way." Leading them into the same conference room that they'd stopped off in earlier, Fury closed the door, crossing his arms. "I've just received word from King T'Challa that the Wakandan government has decided to formally open a diplomatic dialogue with SHIELD, one that also includes your team."
"Don't you even think about trying to go slow now," Tony warned as he rolled over. "You know I can take it."
"And I am definitely hooked on the Stark charm," Steve murmured. He cupped Tony's cheek in his hand, pressing a light kiss to his lips even as his entire body was begging for more. As the afternoon had stretched into evening, Steve had found it more and more difficult to keep his hands to himself, and he was to the point now of trying to come up with a polite yet firm way to suggest to their guests that they should all start taking their leave. He needed to get his husband up to bed.
It took Peter a moment for her statement to sink in. Peter was not at all used to hearing the top Langaran government official addressed by his first name.
Running his bone-dry tongue across his lips, Steve attempts to swallow as he pushes himself up on one elbow.
Peppermint-laced cake aside, Mrs Stacy was an excellent cook, and her fried chicken and seasoned mashed potatoes were almost as good as Uncle Sam's. Between passing the salt shaker back and forth and dodging flying splashes of milk from the boys, Peter ate his fill, so that by the time Dad texted to tell him that he and Papa were on their way, he was feeling much better.
"Well… yeah," Peter stammered, his head spinning. "No, wait, that's not—um… how'd you—wait,
"Sweetheart,
Unfortunately, he wasn't wrong.
"Shit!" cried Major Kowalski as he zoomed by Steve. "Lorne's been hit!"
"Yes, and you still love me," Steve said. He brushed his lips across Tony's in a light kiss. "Let's go to bed, sweetheart. I think we could both use an earlier night."
"Nah, hon, it's okay," said Tony. "If it helps Pete to not have to worry about him then I'll find a way to be okay with it. Your ma's friend though, she's probably gonna need hazard pay or something once she sees how bad the house is, and—"
"Not right now, Steve," Tony whispered. He grasped onto Steve's left hand, unlatching it from his belt and flexing his fingers. "Bruce just kicked me outta there and Clint, Sam, and that bird thingy of his are off exploring the lower levels, so… right now there's nothing much else that we can do."
Through all of the intervening years, Tony had never even considered the possibility that he might actually fall in love with someone, and even less so the possibility that that someone would be so thrilled about Tony having a son. Working up the nerve to tell Steve about Peter—and especially the fact that he was sick—had been one of the most difficult things Tony had ever experienced in his life, and when Steve didn't even blink, when his face didn't give away a single hint of trepidation and instead he expressed how excited he was to meet Peter, that was the first moment when Tony realised that he had truly fallen in love with him.
Which just happened to be the same thing that he had told Peter as well, but like Sam liked to say, sometimes Peter needed to hear things from someone other than his dads for it to completely sink in.
"Yeah, yeah. Sorry." Tony buried his nose into Steve's neck, breathing in deeply. "Gods, honey, you just smell so damn good. Are you sure we still have to go to this meeting of yours?"
seeing so much internal blame and second-guessing behind them, as if everything that was happening was somehow his fault.
"Okay, so anything else?" he asked. "'Cause I'm pretty sure you just used at least three minutes of your allotted one."
And, even worse, there appears to be no floor of any kind for him to land on.
And, if it also happened to help Tony live a bit longer, well, then that was perfectly fine with Steve.
“Oh, you are most welcome,” says Mags.  She digs her fingertips into Tony’s shoulder, giving him a friendly shake.  “Your food will be out in a jiffy.  Make sure to eat it while it’s hot!”
"Oh hell yeah," said Bucky. "I mean, there's gotta come an end to the war sometime, right? Do we even know why we're still fighting?"
Would fate be so cruel as to take both Tony's son and his husband in one fell swoop, only to leave him behind? Was this the final act of its sick production designed to inflict as much torture on Tony as possible?
As much as Steve had always disliked the bright streetlights that used to shine directly onto his childhood bed in Brooklyn, he had quickly grown used to the light blue glow of Tony's arc reactor once they started sharing a bed. To Steve, the constant blue light emanating from the centre of Tony's chest was comforting, a signal that his beloved fella was alive and well, and there with him.
Tony nodded, swallowing hard as he swiped at his eyes.
"Dad's right, little guy," Steve said in a muffled voice. "We're not gonna let anything happen to you."
"Um, I'm pretty sure that wouldn't be very diplomatic of me, Dad," said Peter. "So probably not the best idea since they just saved your life, don't ya think?"
Where would he and Peter be, if it weren't for Steve? How would they have survived out there in the middle of that desert? Or in the Malibu house as it was being bombed? Or down in mad Killian's bunker?
Peter gave a reluctant nod, his mind swirling with various theories. "Yeah, I know Papa likes to be thorough. No one got hurt though, right?"
"Well," she said quietly. "Unfortunately, names are something we inherit rather than create on our own, right?"
Steve thought.
"Ah huh, that's good," he murmured. "So… why don't we try something like this…" He raised his arm and flexed his palm, his heart fluttering as the nanites followed suit.
"More realistic than a merman?" Gwen asked with a giggle. "You make it sound like we'll just be walking down the street one day and hear someone say
The whole thing pretty much sucked. Big time.
"No, I would not, 'cause it's not gonna feel like armour to him," Tony said firmly. "If my math is correct, and it always is—"
“Yeah, sure, you do now,” Tony says worriedly.  “But how ‘bout when I mess your leg up even worse, and we’re still stuck down here?  Then what?”
"Okay, so, what's your plan then, Hammer?" Tony asked. "You just gonna send out your souped-up suit army here to terrorise everyone who doesn't agree with you? Keep the masses in line, so to speak?"
"Just barely," Maria said, letting out a heavy sigh as she turned off her lamp. "I had to pry his fingers from my hand once he was, though."
the wizard had said, right before he'd broken apart like a dead leaf. His eyes, which Tony hadn't much cared to notice at the time, had been filled with sorrow.
"I have—I have heard that before," Steve gasped as he slipped his hands underneath Tony's sleep pants, cupping his glorious round ass as his hips rolled up to meet Tony's. "God, sweetheart, I have
“Um… it was fine?” Peter replied, his eyebrows knitting together as he scanned Tony’s face.  “Did you hear anything from Papa today?”
Now, though, it’s like all of the fears and anxieties that have been simmering right beneath the surface decided to bubble over and start ganging up on him.
"Aahh," Pepper said as she opened the topmost file, scanning down the page. "Qu—Quin—Quentin? I think it says?" She tilted the file sideways, narrowing her eyes. "His signature looks like chicken scratch, but I'm pretty sure it says Quentin Beck. Or maybe it's Bock?… I don't know, something like that."
"Yeah, yeah. Did I mention the mother hen part yet?" muttered Tony. "Now, go on and regale Pete with your vast knowledge of early twentieth century cold remedies. I'm sure he's eating it up."
"No!" Gwen shrieked, shrinking down a bit when the other students shot sharp glares in her direction. "I mean, no, thank you. I don't—I wouldn't want anyone to think that I—I mean, that I got special treatment or something. You know… 'cause we're—we're… friends, and stuff. Yeah."
"Nah, 'cause hardly anyone is," said Bucky. "But apparently Сэм can if the moon is full and Mercury is in retrograde, or some shit like that, and then everybody's gotta hear all about it for the next three weeks."
"Copy that." Steve made one final glance around the circle of his teammates, ending with Tony, whose face was broadcasting exactly what Steve was feeling.
"You think he's ready for bed?" Steve asked a few heartbeats later, his voice so low and husky that Tony let out a shudder.
"I'm telling you, we need to let him know what's going on," Uncle Sam said. "Peter's no dummy, right, so he already knows that something's wrong. It's just not right to keep him in the dark like this."
"Oh wow, really?" Peter exclaimed, briefly drawing the attention of the students at a nearby table. "I mean, really? That would be so awesome if you did! Would you want me to talk to my dad about it, I'm sure that I could—"
the party and then talk to Pete, okay? And if he's not, well, then Pete should be fine—"
"Yes! That's exactly what it is!" Steve exclaimed, his blue eyes wide as he looked down at Tony, obviously understanding that reference. "So it wouldn't be like Yesterday's Enterprise, it'd be more like Parallels!"
“Well, that was fun,” he said once the flame had burned itself out, leaving the tree surprisingly unharmed.  Getting to his feet, Steve brushed the bits of dirt and pine needles from his uniform as he studied the tree, committing its size and shape to one of his mind’s memory files so he could keep an eye out for more of them.
His teammate. The man Steve had known since he was four years old, through good and bad, the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression, through peacetime and war. A man Steve had thought he had once loved, and who they rescued from the brink of his HYDRA-induced madness.
Huffing out a sharp breath, Tony opened his notebook and quickly got to work, making a few minor changes to his notes for the upcoming class. The X-302s weren't too much different from the X-301s operations-wise, but Tony wasn't about to tell the pilots that. Better for them to believe that they couldn't fly the things without Tony's guidance than to allow their collective heads grow any bigger than they already were.
"He will," Tony choked out, wishing he could at least wipe the goddamn tears from his eyes. "He will make it, and he's gonna make it again. He's gonna come back."
"Peter, I promise I'm gonna be careful," Steve said. "I'm gonna have Uncle Sam, Uncle Bucky, and Auntie Nat with me, so… you know they'll be able to keep me in line."
Steve gasped as his belly gave a violent swoop. "Are you—oh God, Tony, are you on the ship?"
"The arc reactors would need to be built with vibranium instead of palladium," Tony cut in. "Otherwise we'll have to be constantly swapping them out."
“That’s exactly what I’m telling you,” said Fury, so matter-of-factly that Tony’s blood instantly transformed into ice.  “‘Cause based on the evidence that we have, that’s exactly what’s happened.”
Peter huffed out a sharp breath, closing his eyes as Papa pulled onto the street. "I know… I just didn't wanna bother you."
"Yeah, nope. Sorry."
“Yep,” Tony replied with a sigh.  He took another sip of coffee as the glowing blue hologram grew brighter and a bright red dot appeared inside the main fuel component of the missile, indicating that it was about to fire.  The red dot grew in size until it simulated an explosion, demonstrated by a red line following along the inside of the missile, which then burst out into a shower of sparks that resembled a Fourth of July fireworks display.
Tony had just put on his own glasses and was about to press the button when he paused, remembering Steve's warning about possible triggers.
"Agreed, One," Carol said. "I'm aiming up. JARVIS's got me ready."
"I would be happy to, Captain."
"Which isn't going to happen," Steve said firmly.
have to tell you that I'm not at all in the mood to remove that privilege from any of you today. Now, do I make myself perfectly clear?"
Peter tipped his head back, inhaling a deep breath through his nose. Grandma had increased both his oxygen flow and the dosage of one of his medicines earlier in the day, worried about his increasing heart rate, and the last thing Peter wanted was to somehow alert her to what he was doing.
For a moment Dad only stared at him, his chin trembling as about a thousand different emotions flew across his face. "And why would this so-called friend of Stacy's tell him that?" he finally asked.
Steve
But then again, Tony never could rest when someone he loved was in pain, and Steve had never been able to hide his pain from him, no matter how hard he tried. Pretty much ever since they met, Tony had always been able to see right through him.
"Oh, really?" Tony said, a bit warily. "And how's that?"
Okay, maybe "concerned" wasn't actually the right word. It was more like he was scared shitless. Tony's worst fear was that some threat would come along—
Both his husband and son gone in one fell swoop… and he was just standing there helpless. Again.
"Cap, I've got eight more hostiles incoming to your position," Sam said as he flew overhead. "ETA about twenty seconds."
"Then why are you here, Mr Stark?" demanded Steve.
Disbelieving, Peter read the section again. And again. And again, his mouth completely dry by the time he'd finished the third reread. His entire body was shaking, his hands clenched into such tight fists that his fingernails had broken through his skin.
"You okay, little guy?" Papa asked as he pulled up to a red light. "Do you need me to stop and get you something to eat?"
"And… uh… I'm not exactly sure," he said under his breath, barely able to hold on as the suit he was riding abruptly changed course again. He scanned its head and neck area, figuring that the team was targeting that section for a reason. "Below the neck, below the neck, below the neck. Ah yeah, there it is!"
"What the hell is that?" he muttered as he squinted off into the distance, trying to figure out exactly what he was seeing. It had to be another aircraft, that much was clear, but it wasn't any Meridian aircraft that he'd ever seen before, nor did it have any Langaran markings that were visible, at least from what Joseph could tell.
"Put the Stacys up in one of the spare apartments," he finally said. "Have JARVIS order in some food and other amenities for them, they might be there awhile."
Tony's belly gave a hard swoop at the resignation in Peter's voice. Apparently in just a few short weeks Howard had managed to trample all of his usual optimism into dust.
"What the hell are you doing here?" Steve snapped, unable to hide his look of horror at Rumlow's face, which was covered with grotesquely pitted and stretched-out skin.
he said again as Steve's lips latched onto his pulse point. He wound his arm around Steve's neck and turned his head to meet Steve's kiss, one so tender and passionate that Tony's knees almost gave way. It was as if Steve was parched, dying of thirst, and Tony was the water that would save him.
"So… you knew, then?" asked Peter. "You knew Papa… didn't like girls?"
"Yeah, I can tell," Papa said as he briefly squeezed Peter's knee. "I talked to Dad right before I came to pick you up, and he told me that he's hoping he'll be able to come back home either tomorrow or the next day."
Davis was quiet for a moment, no doubt trying to come up with something that would sound even a fraction as inspiring as Steve's speech.
Dad and Papa exchanged glances, their eyebrows quirking and dipping in that goofy, non-verbal communication thing that they'd had perfected since even before their first date.
"Yes, I'm sure you're right," said Ma. She gave Tony's arm a reassuring pat. "Chester was just here a bit ago to tell us that they're almost ready for him down there, so… we'll let you have a bit of time beforehand, all right?"
And then, just when he had started to think that he had actually gotten it all wrong, Peter had appeared within the portal, flipping through it before landing right in front of them, just as beautiful and whole as he had been the last time Steve had seen him.
And how badly he wanted him.
"Well, it is a certain little guy's birthday tomorrow," Steve said. "I was hoping you guys could all come over and help us celebrate. I’m even going to bake him a cake."
"Agent Bartlett," Tony said, gripping Steve's arm. "So I guess you are still alive, hmm?"
"Nothing!" Steve said, a bit too emphatically when Sam raised an eyebrow. "We've all been a bit off lately. Losing a teammate tends to do that."
"I love you too," murmured Steve once they broke apart, their foreheads pressed together and tears streaking down both their cheeks. "And I can't wait to go home with you and our son."
"Yeah, yeah," James muttered playfully. "And how many times have I heard that one, hmm?"
"Yeah, well, at least it's something that I know I'm good at," mumbled Tony.
"No," Steve said, dropping his chin to his chest. "Well, I don't know. It's not exactly very—"
Not until he was absolutely positive that Tony was going to be okay.
"Okay, so I like your plan, except I think it sucks," Quill finally said.
"Daddy," he said, so softly that Tony barely heard him. "I don't—I don't feel so good."
Tony leaned forward, pressing a kiss to Steve’s grizzled cheek.
Steve watched through bleary eyes as Helen Cho carefully placed her stethoscope underneath the front of Peter's hospital gown, her brow furrowing as she listened to his lungs. His fingers instinctively tightened around his son's hand as she moved the stethoscope all around his chest, his heart lurching in relief when she finally withdrew it, smiling softly.
Pressing his clasped hands to his mouth, Tony sucked in a deep breath.
"Okay, okay, I'm sorry I brought it up!" Steve backed away from the mirror, tilting his head as he eyed himself up and down. "I guess I'm ready."
"All right, Bruce, we get it," Steve said. "What kind of timeline are we talking about here?"
"It's not intruding if we invite you in," Tony stated. "And as far as I'm concerned, you're just as much of a father to that kid as I am. And being a father by choice instead of by chance makes it even more special."
Besides, he'd been doing it for so long, ever since the Battle of New York, the team was more than used to it by now.
“All right!  Now that’s what I’m talking about!” Obie practically yelled once the simulation was over.  He gave Tony’s shoulder another hard clap, shaking him so hard that some of his coffee sloshed over the rim of the mug.  “So, how soon can I set up the meeting with the Joint Chiefs?”
And yet, like he'd told Steve many times since the beginning of the Avengers Initiative, they didn't exactly have desk jobs. The very nature of their team and its combined strength only served to invite stronger and stronger challenges, and that worried Tony. Despite the fact that they'd recently added two new team members in the Maximoff twins—and he supposed Peter as well, although both he and Steve were still vehemently opposed to naming him an official Avenger—Tony was pretty concerned about what sort of challenges lay ahead.
to glance at his watch... “And, hopefully, that means no one will think to pay too much attention to this lobby, and no one will see where we went after you pass out, and if they check back they’ll just see you chatting to a drunk guy who then wandered off – and, all in all, that should mean they don’t make the connection, and no one raises an alarm, and they won’t come looking for us. For a little while at least.”

know that name – it was buried in there somewhere, among all the millions of pop culture references he’d tried to catch up on in the last year. But there was no frame of reference, no mental image or association. No way to know what joke Tony was making.
“Of course, you can,” Tony breathed, his voice heavy with feeling, his fingers curling possessively around Steve’s shoulders.
And Tony knew better than to push it. As much as he still thought Steve should talk about this, he knew better than to try and force him when he was drunk.
Maybe the specific events he’d chosen to apologise for weren’t the best examples of what he was getting at – but, on each occasion, he’d been getting at something legitimate.
“Really, you cared about Tony, did you?” Steve demanded - before he’d even bothered to think if that was true. Thor seemed to recognise that there was no point starting that argument, and with only the slightest flicker of hesitation, gestured to Rhodey.
...But that wasn’t the same as owing someone his love.

For a second Steve was too breathless to answer.
Steve gasped softly, freezing instantly, his eyes snapping to meet Tony’s again. But Tony was looking at Steve’s fingers now… his gaze following the trail of that one drop of blood.
A thoughtful look came into Steve’s eyes for a second – not sad, exactly… but somehow sad to look at… And then, just as Tony thought the pause had drifted into a stop, Steve blinked, and carried on,
And, of course, Captain America would say that there was no way they could leave the people of Anni-Vara to suffer any longer. That it would be worth capture, torture, even death, to try and make this right. There was no way Captain America would let a personal crisis, or even the risk of a horrible personal tragedy, stand in the way of doing what was right – which was going to Maribelle’s party. They’d discussed it. The best way they had of learning what they needed to know, and not putting any additional lives at risk, was for Steve to go out tonight. Whatever the risk. Whatever the personal cost.

before Steve could see him.

And then, as so often happened – Tony made the choice for him.
So, instead, Tony just blurted it out,
...But there were other ways.
close-
“If you’re not up to it, we don’t have to go today,” Sam repeated, leaning his weight on the steering wheel and trying to catch Steve’s eye. “I can just start the car up again, and take you back home. It’s not a big deal. Everyone will understand.”

he was. In an instant, Tony found himself pulled up off of his feet and hard against Steve’s chest, the burn of Kevlar dragging over his legs. A rush of giddiness flooded through Tony’s head as he struggled to process that surge of excitement, his vision fading at the edges as he threw his arms around Steve’s neck, clawing frantically at his skin.
he told Bucky to call him immediately.
love him?
Steve was sure a lot of effort had gone into researching and replicating the features of a 1940s home. At least, his apartment looked very different to everywhere else he went in the 21st Century, and was mercifully free of the ‘wireless’ and ‘interactive’ appliances that the world seemed to take for granted these days - so he knew that really he should just be grateful for the consideration…
And then, just as Steve was making the turn onto Tony’s estate, Bucky asked,
“...Are
“Oh,” Tony breathed, so quietly that he was sure Steve couldn’t have heard it. He was flooded with a vulnerability every bit as pure and as impactful as when Steve had intervened between he and Nick-
He’d never been able to do that with ‘the Steve thing’, because that alone had seemed just too ominous. Shapeless. It had simply been ‘a fear’ for his entire life, something he could never find the beginning of, something that had always been just out of the corner of his eye. Something it had been easy enough to put out of mind, for as long as Steve Rogers had been a figure from the past.
“...You want us to be in a show?” He repeated, narrowing his eyes.
And all at once Steve could feel that bodily terror of losing him – or, worse still,
“Good,” Tony nodded, trying to smile. “Thank you.”
So, he’d spent ten whole minutes changing his shirt. Because he came up with his
Was that even okay?
“It’s one of the things – means whoever is running this place isn’t in it for the money.” Tony explained. “And

could do a lot better.
Steve dropped his eyes and swallowed hard, clearly floored by that. Tony watched him struggle to find the words for a second or two-
“Yeah,” Tony grinned, leaning into him. “But… Seeing as you can only be here for a few more hours… Maybe we should leave the talking, for now…” And he glanced up to watch Steve’s eyes widen, before he dropped his head and took Tony’s mouth again-
He wasn’t confused.
Tony didn’t often use the word stunning-

Tony kept his eyes on the gun as it fell away in a burst of bright red.
Tony made sure to stand a safe distance from the door frame – he had to stretch, to reach the handle. But then the door swung open, and that bright segment of sunlight appeared on the floor of the lobby…
And then he saw something snag Steve’s attention, and only then did Tony recognise the noise outside – the crescendo of cheers and whistles and car horns, and the collective shout discernible above the increasing roar-
that he wanted Steve to be here. That everything would be even better if Steve was actually here.
“Yes, right. Okay.” He breathed, taking them all in at a sweep. “Okay, we need a more useful command…” And then he looked back to the panel, “Okay, load all files on the history of The Facility, or Mallamen, or Anni Vara. Left side of the left wall.”
As he always did in times of crisis, Tony thought of Rhodey and Pepper, and the various disasters they’d helped to steer him through…

But Belle arriving had woken Steve up. And, when Steve realised she was talking to them, he sat up… leaving a cold feeling on Tony’s legs and all through his stomach…
And then Steve heard the speedy patter of footsteps echoing from the left-hand hallway, and then Tony all but slid across the polished floor, coming to a not-especially-graceful stop right in front of him.
Hard enough to draw blood-
“Doing what?”
He huffed his way past the memory of Tony’s outfit, and tugged at the collar of his own t-shirt - which was at least a size too small for him, and two sizes too small for this weather.
Steve could hear the particular smile when Bucky said it. Knowing, and teasing – and genuinely happy for him.

to be with people…
A little smile tugged at his lips as he thought back to that purely functional final stop on his time-trip, and the Steve that he’d quietly watched unthaw. Of all the Steves that he had crossed paths with, he had a certain connection to that one, having spent so long clinically observing his awakening like that…
It was three days since he last went into cryofreeze, and, all things going according to plan, he was finally finished with that part of his treatment. On the one hand, he did feel more connected to the world and more aware of his surroundings and more confident of the passage of time… He knew he

… A place where he and Tony were together, and happy. Where Bucky was secure and supported - where maybe Tony and Bucky were friends. Somewhere Nat was still alive. A place where they beat Thanos the first time around, a place where time travel didn’t exist…
The second before Tony took that first mouthful seemed to stretch on forever, while Steve continued to look without looking as though he was looking…
And then Steve lifted his head, and sat up, taking his hands away.
“Yeah… Um, also… I’m basically sorry for the whole of the last twenty years,” Tony sighed.
He would’ve felt a lot better if he could’ve remembered everything he’d said…
Taking slow breaths, in through is nose, out through his mouth.

They began their weary march over to the right of the building, so that they could approach the dumpsters side on, through the parking lot. By the time they got there, the sweat was beginning to gather along Tony’s back, and the robes were weighing ever heavier on his shoulders.
“Oh, God, fuck Steve, I’ll come, if you, I can’t-” Tony pleaded, bucking up against him anyway, completely powerless against this now.
Tony blinked, unduly started - and then frowned with a touch too much aggression, as he demanded,
“Yes.”
And then he pulled out of Steve - taking the opportunity to push his pants and underwear down over his hips, clumsily kicking them over his legs as he crawled up into Steve’s arms. Immediately Steve’s fingers were at the front of his shirt, fumbling slightly as he unfastened his buttons-
But he got the impression that wouldn’t be considered helpful either.
“Well, maybe we could go and explain to them that they’re hurting people, and they will immediately understand our argument and feel terrible for what they’ve done, and close up shop, and offer whatever help that can to make it right.” He suggested, wryly. And even then, it took a second for Tony to register what Steve was getting at. He’d already moved onto the next filler sentence,

fell over Tony’s lips, as his gaze fell to Steve’s mouth…
“But we are already sitting in an empty room, on an alien planet, is my point” Steve answered. And Tony couldn’t help a little smile, even through his discomfort.
Tony nodded again, and thought about some of the things he really would have liked to say - all the playful observations it would have been fun to share, all the conversations that could have unfolded so easily, all the ways in which he could’ve relaxed into this happy state of mind…

It was the look on Steve’s face. The guileless, delighted shock that lit up his every feature as he gasped,

a good time to become distracted by Tony’s eyes...
He remembered that horrible fear that he wouldn’t be good enough for Steve…
He hated himself for liking it, in such an instant, primal way.
“Nowhere near,” Rhodey agreed, seriously. And then he turned to Tony, and looked him up and down, and asked, “so, what’s with the toga?”

“Sweet Jesus Fuck, Steve,

Oh, Tony’s chest ached for him in that moment.
Oh, God, this whole thing was just...impossible…
It was gone the moment he saw Steve look at him, of course. But still, Steve knew now that Tony felt sorry for Bucky. That Tony felt sorry for

“There was a Post It note, stuck to the computer monitor, when I attached that tracker last night”
Tony had spent the morning scanning through every file stored on The Facility’s central system. They’d managed to piece together the basic schedule for the entire building, the staff hierarchies – the goal of each
That seemed like a much bigger taboo, somehow.
“Tony-” Steve interrupted - because he knew it wasn’t Tony’s place to be sorry. That he had so many apologies he wanted the chance to make-

- in the same tone he’d prepared for his intended, mission-specific, professional question. It was already shaping his lips, the air already gathering to push the words out of his mouth-
Tony groaned, angrily, and pushed himself up off of the couch with far too much force. Suddenly, he was enraged at the entire world. Furious at the injustice of his very existence. And it was petulant, and it was immature, and it was obviously pointless, because there wasn’t even anything to be mad at.
As Tony leant over to fish his phone out of his pocket, he rolled back into the real world. He remembered where they were, and what they were doing - and everything they had to get back to.
“Do you know who this is?” He asked, tossing one of the pages he was holding onto the coffee table that stood between them. He waited politely for Nick to reach down and grab it.

There was something more urgent he needed to do.
“I’m… not,” he sighed. “I just… You know, he’s leader of the Avengers, and it’s a little worrying when his location is unknown, and he’s uncontactable…”
Steve recognised the sharp little crack as he slammed his bedroom door behind him.

But all of that felt reassuringly normal, when Steve compared it to the night before.
Of course, the time they had wasn’t theirs to keep. It was destined to slip away from them at the same merciless pace, no matter what they did – all Tony could do was try to make the best of it.
“Okay, so, this is how it works…” Tony started, selecting and enhancing a little corner of his hologram – a video of a lumbar puncture procedure.

still maintained that he never needed it, seeing as their only real input was to lock him in his room and tell him to fix it himself-
Steve hadn’t taken in many of the details, on any of his attempts to look around - but he knew it was his favourite of all the places that he and Tony had ever met up. He liked the unfussy, log-cabin aesthetic, the worn wooden furnishings and soft fabrics and warm, low lighting… Of course, like most of the places Tony booked for them, it was secretly high end and very modern, with all the latest mod cons carefully hidden away - but it
Without another thought, Steve just let his head fall forward, and buried it into Tony’s shoulder-

to feel trapped beneath him, at his mercy, entirely without authority or control or responsibility-
"Woohoo, Stevie!" cried Bucky as he came up on Steve's six. "This thing is fucking awesome!"
"You are?" Peter had asked, as the biggest smile Steve had ever seen spread across his sweet face. "You really love him?"
Uncle Bucky thought for a moment. "Okay, that makes sense. But then if it was there the whole time, how would your dad have missed it? He doesn't seem like the kind of guy who would miss something like that."
“Ho-ly shit,” Tony whispered, tapping his fingertips on the dark polished wood of his desk.  “Am I really gonna do this?”
The tears Steve had been trying to hold back finally spilled down his cheeks, dripping onto his lap as he looked over Peter's head at his husband. Tony's face was almost completely impassive, with only his tight jaw and a single twitching vein in his temple revealing his profound anger and betrayal at seeing his former mentor/ father figure willingly torture his son.
Tony smirked at JARVIS's attempt to feign innocence. "Why? You trying to imply that Pete's gonna forget to bring 'em if we make 'em here? What would give you that idea?"
I cannot wait to hear what you guys think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button and leave me a comment! 💗
And, if the way Steve's eyes darkened as soon as they stepped inside their bedroom was any indication, Tony wasn't the only one.
. And when the dust had finally settled from the fierce battle that had followed, and his heroic son had once again freed him from his prison, Peter's very first words to him were, "Papa, it's me! Everything's gonna be okay now!"
After gathering the books he would need for his morning classes, Peter and Ned headed down the hall to their homeroom classroom, sliding into their seats just as the bell rang. Peter violently jumped at the harsh, piercing sound, kicking himself for not anticipating it.
Yet another trait that Peter had apparently inherited from his father.
Peter froze for a second, unable to move as he stared at Gwen's crumpled body, his heart so lodged in his throat that he couldn't breathe.
Steve's heart leapt into his throat as T'Challa frowned. "We open the barrier," he said, low and tight.
Steve was quiet as he towelled off and got dressed, contemplating if he should ask Bucky the question that had been rolling around in his mind ever since he'd found the paper sack outside his door.
"You know who you sound like?" he asked.
"Okay, so how limited is limited?"
Tony watched as the photographer gulped and nodded, backing away just as another leapt forward and snapped a picture right in Peter's face.
Clint trailed off, but Steve understood what he meant anyway.
"Mr Wilson expects Captain Rogers in the lobby of Avengers Tower at 10am, sir," answered JARVIS. "Which is in exactly ten minutes and twenty-three seconds."
"I'll walk you back inside, Scott," Bruce cut in. "Tony, say… your lab in about thirty minutes?"
"There you guys are!" Peter exclaimed as soon as they stepped inside, his round face so pale and drawn that Tony's heart gave a painful lurch. He had been trying hard to deny the fact that despite being in the hospital Peter's condition was still steadily worsening, but it was getting to the point now where it was almost impossible to ignore.
Which was probably why it was called 'space', instead of vast quantities of stuff.
"Ah, three," answered Steve. "One by myself, one with Peter, and one with Tony, about twenty minutes ago."
As most of their vacations did, the week passed all too quickly, and soon Steve and the rest of the team were already packing to head back to New York. And while Tony would likely disagree with him, especially since King T'Challa had flat-out refused to give them any information on their defensive technology, Steve was still very grateful that they had made the trip. Not only had Peter been able to truly relax for the first time in months, thanks largely in part to his instant friendship with T'Challa's sister, but the entire team seemed to be rejuvenated. Clint and Natasha had even taken the opportunity to travel out to the mountains for a couple of days, leaving the twins behind for the first time since they had come to live with them. Bucky and Sam had embarked on an excursion as well, exploring the far western border of the country and camping out under the stars, something that Sam had enjoyed when he was young.
“And I fucking
He cuts off as Tony’s eyes crinkle, and he lets out an amused chuckle.  “You mean, back in your day, eh, Cap?”
“Oh please, Captain,” Doctor List cut in.  “This is all really just a waste of time.  The fact remains that—”
"Vision?" asked Steve. "What kind of a vision?"
"No! Why would you do that?" Steve yelped, his heart jumping into his throat. The last thing Tony needed was another potential exposure to the drug that almost killed him. "Tony, I don't want you or Peter anywhere near that stuff!"
"Hmph," grumbled Tony. "Pretty sure Howard could've explained exactly how it was supposed to work, if you'd only asked him."
And now he was going to have to live without him for the next two—maybe three—weeks, a thought that brought an instant frown to Tony’s face as he set his phone down on the counter, eyeing it as if it had personally insulted him.
"Dad's right, little guy," Papa said with a soft smile. "Go to sleep now."
lifetimes—this ranked right up there amongst the weirdest.
"All right, so—" Tony started.
"Hey, Pep," Tony said fondly. "Just wanted to let you know that Steve and I will be taking Pete and the team to Italy during the week of Pete's spring break, so if the Board members feel like seeing my face they'll have to do it some other time. Oh, and I'll be sure to have the next round of tablet specs done before we leave, if that helps."
Landing in Wakanda, in the middle of a battle that he had technically already fought, had been one of the most disconcerting experiences of Steve's life, second only to when he awoke from the ice. The urge to rush right over to Bucky and Sam and embrace them had been nearly insurmountable, an urge he had seen mirrored in Clint and Natasha's faces when they first laid eyes on Wanda. Both Sam and Bucky had wondered aloud where Tony had suddenly come from, especially since they had been well aware of how worried Steve had been about him the last time, and Steve had also noticed Wanda doing a double-take at Natasha's hair, which was now much longer than it had been a year ago.
"So, you two wanna get some drinks?" Ned asked. "The punch is awesome here, it's even got real strawberries floating in it!"
Breathing in a shaky breath, Tony gathered up his armload of completed simulator protocols and the speaker and hurried out of his office, finding Phillips dozing in his chair in the upper section of the hangar. Apparently he'd found that afternoon's patrol rather boring.
"Hey, Cap!" Sam said as he walked up. "Glad you could finally make it."
Because when the "when" finally came, he and the rest of his team needed to be ready.
"Clint got a hit?"
"No!" Peter exclaimed. "Dad, there's no way that Mr Stacy is in with HYDRA, there's no way! I swear, you have to believe me!"
About a metre away from Bucky sits Jacques Dernier, the Frenchman who took bronze in Steve’s gold-medal race four years ago, and Georges Batroc, a relative newcomer from Algeria.  But while Jacques turned in some decent times in last year’s World Championship meet and Batroc won his semi-final race in pretty impressive fashion, Steve doesn’t really consider either of them to be a threat here.
"You mean, like absolutely nothing in the way of, right?" Tony cut in. "Like, we literally cannot do it. Our best space shuttles can only go to the moon and back, and even then, all the goddamn red tape we'd have to wade through first would make it impossible to get anything done in a reasonable amount of time, so—"
Too overwhelmed to speak, Tony simply nodded, tilting his head back to capture Steve's lips in a sloppy kiss as he clenched down around him, the coil in his gut winding tighter and tighter and tighter as Steve suddenly went rigid behind him, crying out his climax into Tony's shoulder.
said the RT. "
"Tony, what the hell is happening here?" Carol asked. "What the hell's going on, everything worked just fine for me?"
"This is a bigger deal to me than going to space," Steve said, tossing a scowl in Bucky's direction. "And shouldn't you be taking notes or something?"
