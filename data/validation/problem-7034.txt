It takes him far too long to realize that the tugging feeling at the back of his neck is Steve trying to get him to stop kissing for long enough to get rid of his ratty NIN t-shirt.  One of these days he swears he’s going to get Steve so riled up he’ll tear his clothes off – that’s never happened to him before and he has the feeling Steve could actually do it, rend fabric in two like it’s tissue paper between his hands.
Jan and Bucky polish off one bottle of wine while he finishes cooking, and he’s in the process of dishing up when Natasha appears at the front door, looking tired and annoyed, having been kept late on a last minute re-write.
Bucky slowly pulls his fingers from Steve’s grasp, the metal of the handcuff and chain that links his only wrist to the floor clinking lightly.  SHIELD agents had removed his cybernetic arm and without it he seems like the walking wounded, despite the injury being seventy years old.  Bucky shrinks into himself, hiding his good hand in the folds of his worn jacket.
“So when you asked about the problem, that was a rhetorical question then. You’ve already decided what it is.”
Steve clenches his fists at his sides and tries to block Tony out, closing his eyes tightly.  Tony’s words are shredding him, because Tony hadn’t been lying about tearing him apart.  The man knows what he’s doing.  He knows exactly where it hurts the most.
Beleaguered, he stares at the sticky mess, the wet warmth seeping through the thin fabric to his palm.
To his surprise, Natasha swiftly moves in close and wraps her arms around him.  He tenses, startled, lifting his arms off to his sides as she presses close.
“I know it’s late, I’m sorry,” He apologizes before Steve can speak, pulling his wristwatch out of his pocket. He’d been in such a rush he hadn’t even bothered to put it back on.
“Always, Banner.” He quips a beat later.  Steve can’t decipher the subtext, but it’s clear the two men were discussing something more than opening a bottle of wine.
Tony throws his arms out wide to welcome Phil, but just quickly drops them, letting out a disgruntled snort.  He makes a broad gesture up and down and around as if he’s trying to encompass all of Phil’s body.
“Perhaps you and Stark will share a jail cell,” Loki tosses over his shoulder as he turns to leave. “That would work out wonderfully for you both.”
And then a strange blue light emits from the helicopter and Tony’s falling.  Everything’s gone dark, his wiring short-circuiting and his programs failing.
“Clearly candle retrieval is a two person operation.”  Tony mutters to himself unhappily.  His gaze moves from Steve to Bucky, obviously cottoned on to what Natasha’s doing.
“So you and Bucky…” Tony starts, then stops, then starts again. “Your weekend was…eventful?” His voice lifts in question at the end of the sentence, like he’s unsure if
Tony gives Phil the obligatory grief while Steve tries not to make the man giddy and nervous in front of his staff.  He’s not entirely successful.  Phil trips over debris twice before realizing he can’t walk and talk to Captain America at the same time without making a fool out of himself.
“Yeah, we've got this new widescreen project in development, something that's going to make those dinky small television screens seem boring as hell. Might even impress you, Rogers.”
New York stopped being the seat of power for the film industry twenty years ago; the days of Zukor and Loew are done. Tony’s just some hotshot outsider blowing into town thinking he can make movies; these guys want his bank, but at the same time they also don’t want him to succeed. They need the cash because they’re being forced to divest their exhibition arms, while for the same reason they’re weaker than ever and looking to circle the wagons, stop others from chipping away at the system they’ve built.
on the way back, as it turns out that hanging onto the back of Steve’s ridiculous motorcycle is actually amazing now that he’s comfortable plastering himself to Steve’s broad back.  He hadn’t realized how much energy he’d been exhausting trying to keep himself from letting his desperate want bleed through until he no longer had to hide it.
“Not really the point, Pepper,” Tony replies as he sets the t-shirt and sweatpants on the checkout counter, along with a razor and some shaving cream, a couple bottles of water, milk and a box of cereal.  He tosses on a candy bar and a five-hour energy drink for himself, balancing the phone between his shoulder and ear as he digs out his wallet.
they could have Steve right now, and I have gotten nowhere!  The only thing I’ve managed to learn so far is that I thought Kazakhstan was spelled with an ‘I’ in the middle and it’s actually an ‘A’!  How
“Well then give me something to go on.”  Steve demands, his usual patience non-existent.  If Tony can’t spit out an explanation for why things have gone so wrong, he doesn’t know what they’re doing here.  Tony frowns, crossing his arms over his chest, running a hand over his goatee.
Not until the next flare of awareness, dawning on him even more slowly than the first time.  It comes in ebbs and flows, except not that gentle.  It’s like he’s drowning, occasionally managing to surface to gasp for air.  It seems to last for hours.
say that, or did you? Because I know Steve, and I can’t imagine him giving you an ultimatum like that.” She sits down beside him, poking him in the arm sharply with her finger. “You, however, are fully capable of mucking up one of the best relationships you’ve ever had with no help from anyone else.”
, but they had all the same. With the lights of Los Angeles spread out below them, Steve had smiled at him softly in the dashboard light before leaning across the space between them and pressing their lips together in a gentle kiss that quickly slid into something more. The risk was exhilarating, but Tony had to admit even then that the shiver that ran through his entire body wasn't about any illicit thrill. With Steve, it wasn't the excitement of knowing they shouldn't; it was realizing there was no possible way they
He gets Steve on his elbows and knees and buries his face between Steve’s cheeks, tongue thrusting into Steve’s tight hole without much preamble. Steve chokes out a cry and he blindly reaches for a pillow from his bed, dragging it down onto the ground. He shoves his face into it to muffle his cries.
It only reminds Tony of the cold hard truth – he and Bruce aren’t soldiers.  They weren’t ready for any of what happened to them.
“You get my gist, you really want me to be anatomically correct in front of the good Captain here?”  He waves her off, and then gestures toward Steve.  “Now c’mon, re-commence the beat down.  This is getting boring fast.”
Tony regrets layering his Black Sabbath tee over a long sleeved shirt, but hell, it’d been getting cooler in the city.  He hadn’t planned on Oklahoma when he’d left this morning.
“Oh, this one?” Tony looks down at himself, nonplussed. He has the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, the shirt fully unbuttoned, the fabric streaked in engine grease. He shrugs it off his shoulders, leaving him in only his black tank and jeans. He hands the shirt to Steve like the problem is solved.
“I fucking love you too.” Steve does crack a small smile as he mimics Tony’s less-than-romantic phrasing. He’s so beautiful with his gaze downcast, his long, dark eyelashes fluttering against his cheeks and his plush, pink lips parted, that Tony has to kiss him again.
Tony glances at him and must mistake something on his face for dismay, when really, it’s that he’s catching up. What just happened between them almost feels like an out of body experience.
“You’re just fine, Phil, ignore Tony.” Pepper assures Phil, stepping slightly in front of Tony and extending her hand.  Given that Pepper had explicitly taken care of what he would wear for this occasion and the kind of outfits he’s seen everyone else wearing, Steve suspects that Pepper is being kind.
“I remember she was beautiful, like a movie star.  Even then.  She wore this red, red lipstick.  I remember her being kind, and I remember thinking she seemed sad, but I don’t remember what she did or why I thought that.”  He tosses back his shot.  “And I remember my parents fighting all night after she left.”
Thor is with them tonight, his blustery, booming laugh audible even over the din of the crowd. A recent émigré from Sweden, he’s been a boon to the studio’s special effects department. He specializes in weather simulation, and Steve has to admit that his thunderstorms read as near believable onscreen.
The flat screen television has a stack of Blu-rays and DVDs beside it on the stand.  He runs a finger over the titles, amused to find season one of
Tony takes a moment to consider Steve’s arms, glistening with a faint sheen of perspiration.  The super soldier serum has regenerative properties, but he’s never been clear on how far that extends.  He guesses not that far.
– and a patriotic fanfare blasts forth. Way too much trumpet and snare. The sound level actually hurts his ears.
“Yeah,” Steve agrees.  But the song ends and it’s twice as awkward now as it ever was before.  Tony doesn’t move back toward him so Steve stays exactly where he is.  Tony puts his hand against his own chest, fingers tapping against the arc reactor’s glass through his shirt for a moment before he places his palm flat over his stomach.
“You’ve barely slept at all this entire trip so it seemed idiotic to wake you.  And like I said, I had work to do.”  Tony reaches over and switches on the bedside table lamp.  Steve blinks but his eyes adjust quickly to the bright light.  “Pepper needed these reports weeks ago, so it’s good I got them out of the way.”
Yet he waits.  He waits far too long after he shoots multiple rounds, watching to see whom he hit.  It’s not to make sure his target is down.
, even - and above all, tied to Steve.  Tied to Steve maybe more than most, in a taut line that stretches across oceans and ice, decades and wars and money and death and milestones unmarked because his father was off searching…elsewhere.
Tony leans forward, elbows resting on the seatback in front of him, and runs his fingers through his own hair, tugging at the strands in frustration.
“I know business is more my arena than yours, Steve, but even you have to know that’s not a good deal for you. Your anything versus my one thing? I assure you nothing I think is worth that much. Aim higher.”
And isn’t that just…well, he doesn’t know what it is.  It’s something.  He swallows down the defeat of Pepper anticipating this phone call and focuses on the gratitude welling up to take its place.
He kisses somehow exactly like Steve thought he would, but also differently. Better. He guides Steve through it like they’ve been kissing for years, the angle of their heads and the slant of their mouths knowing and assured. Bucky’s tongue slides against his and his fingers tangle in Bucky’s hair and he could do this forever; they have so much lost time to make up for.
And Steve.  Steve.  Steve’s already gone.  He’s failed, and Steve’s gone.  He can’t see the helicopter anymore.
Tony spits in his palm and starts stroking Steve’s cock, which is still long and thick and perfect even if he doesn’t last as long or come four or five times in one night anymore.
“Why didn’t you ever say anything? It’s not like you had competition, Buck, and you must’ve suspected…” Steve stops, not wanting to sound like he only fell for Bucky because no one else paid him the time of day. That’s not how it happened. He'd only ever had eyes for his best friend. “You were the one out on the town every night, I literally had no idea you even felt that way. I thought it was hopeless.”
Tony wonders, amazingly for the first time, what Steve’s plans had been with Peggy.  Or really, what
“And here I was coming to see if you were okay.” Tony says tightly. His gaze ticks down to Steve’s waistline and then back up to his flushed face. “You’d been gone a
It’s not until they squeeze onto the southbound N train that it occurs to Steve that Tony had been fine throughout, calmly calling over Steve’s shoulder to direct him where to go as Steve practically dragged him along.
“Of course I haven’t. I’ve been hiding out, avoiding him ever since I saw this idiotic note you left. He knows about this? Steve—Steve Rogers, our Steve—he said this was okay?”
Steve walks forward, the realization dawning on his face as he takes it all in.  Tony made sure there’s everything Steve could ever want – easel, sketch table, oils, acrylics, charcoal, pencils, brushes of every shape and size.  There are racks of different press watercolor paper, newsprint and pads and pre-stretched canvasses.  There’s a small woodshop set up with nails and staple guns and gesso, wood and a miter saw in case Steve decides to frame and stretch his own.   Steve passes the wash station and runs his hand along the set of wide, slim drawers to lay his work flat and safe to dry.  He taps on the light board as if not sure what it’s even for.
He snaps his pencil in two, the top part of it bouncing to the floor. The noise of the lightweight cedar wood tinkling against cement catches Tony’s attention.
“Tony, seriously.”  Natasha says, though she’s biting back a small smile.  “Just drink your kale & wheatgrass, eat your Greek yogurt, and stop molesting poor Steve.”
“You sure you don’t want to hold out for a better proposal?” Tony replies. “The down low isn’t exactly something you can negotiate. Nowhere to go from here.”
The taste of Bucky’s come floods his mouth, hot and bitter, and Steve swallows it down greedily. He eases off but doesn’t stop entirely, holding Bucky’s length in the wet heat of his mouth until long after the tremors of his body have subsided. When Steve finally kneels back, Bucky’s length resting half-hard against his own thigh and glistening with Steve’s saliva and his own come, Bucky trembles again.
“Oh, my delicate ears, how will I recover,” Natasha sighs in a Southern accent, fanning herself. “Assholes are a dime a dozen in this town, Steve. If you avoid them, you’re going to be out of a job. So the question is, is Stark the kind of asshole you can work with, or no?”
Tony sits down at his desk and lays his palms flat on its cool surface. He wills himself to calm, his arousal to abate. But just shifting in his chair feels like too much, the fabric of his pants brushing against his skin nigh unbearable.
“Ride back home?” Tony asks, pulling Cap in tight and taking off, happily leaving the battle wreckage for SHIELD to clean up.
They come to a stop at a heavy metal door and Natasha punches in an elaborate key code that makes the lock switch from red to green.  Tony has no idea what they’re doing or where they’re going, but he hasn’t known since Natasha met him outside his unpleasant six o’clock meeting with Maria Hill and he keeps following her lead anyway.
As she wheels him down the hallway, he catches a glimpse of an observation room; its windows overlook the medical bay.  The small space is littered with bodies.  Men in dark uniforms.  There isn’t any blood.
Apparently even Monty’s posh accent wasn’t persuasive enough, this time. Steve frowns at the set that’s coming together in front of him.
Steve steps into the theater, slowly walking down the small flight of stairs. He doesn’t join Tony among the seats, instead leaning against the wall opposite where Tony stands.
He kills ex-KGB officials in their beds. He hunts HYDRA down. He tears their men to pieces and burns what’s left of their facilities. One head, much less two, cannot grow if there is no body.
He’s spent so long assuming that Steve could never be his that it’s actually overwhelming to think that that might not be true.
But then again, Steve never did think he was worth much, worth loving. Even if Bucky had told him flat out that he was mad about him, Steve probably would’ve come up with a reason not to believe it.
When he turns back, he finds Steve watching him intently with hooded eyes, teeth worrying his lush bottom lip.
Limbs shaking, he pulls off of Tony and slowly re-arranges himself, facing away from Tony on all fours.
He loves the way he can cover Steve’s body with his, now, just as much as he’d loved how Steve’s body used to cover his.
“A few days ago, but it’s not…it’s not exactly new.  It’s complicated.  But Clint told Darcy and though I hate to say it, Darcy’s an awful gossip.  Figured the whole world knew by now.”
“They tranq’ed Banner first off, before anything else even went down.  It was a SHIELD agent, or at least someone dressed as a SHIELD agent.  They knew what they were doing and they sure knew about the Hulk.  But Bruce is alive and they don’t seem interested in him.  Whoever they are, they’re still here – and they’re looking for something else.”
Steve starts for Tony’s dark blue Coupe de Ville, making like he’s going to toss the keys to Tony so he can re-claim the wheel. Before Steve can throw them or make to cross the highway to the car, Tony stops and gestures down the road.
He absolutely does not picture Steve in the shower; moreover, he does not consider that from the looks of things Bucky might have been sharing that shower with him.  It doesn’t matter.  Theoretically, evidence of Bucky and Steve being together should make this easier to do.
Tony Stark in a Motel 6 – what is the world coming to?  If only he’d caught up with Steve somewhere near a decent Omni.
“Mission was a success, kind of.  No Zola, but he was definitely here at some point and had to leave in a hurry.  He left a lot behind.  We have new tech and information for you to sort through when we get back.”
This thing with Steve is twice as dangerous as Pepper thought and in a very different way than he suspects Pepper believes.  He shouldn’t be here.  He should forget it all and go back to New York, back to Pepper, and let everyone else deal with Captain America.
Tony’s laying it on a bit thick, now, and it makes Steve doubt that this attraction he feels is actually going both ways. Tony could just be playing at this in order to get what he wants. He’s brilliant enough and beautiful enough that it’s likely worked well for him in the past.
it was mere coincidence.  Perhaps passed it off as a Nordic fetish and joked that he planned on opening a division of Stark Industries in Sweden just to expand and refresh his dating pool.
“What?  BOOM.”  Sam makes an exploding motion, signaling the back of his head blowing out from sheer shock.  “I don’t know if I can look her in the eyes anymore.  She’s gonna know I
“That’s a weird interpretation of this conversation.  Positively Lynchian in its strange digression.  Please don’t tell me you’ve got a dwarf stashed somewhere talking backward.”
“The production values may not have been the best, but if you want to talk about presence….” Coulson gestures like that’s enough said.
he's sorry for. He doesn't want to muck this up any further. "I guess we all should have had a sit-down together. I just…I thought this should be between the two of you. It didn’t feel like my place. But then…I thought I should at the very least let you know I was all right with it, so when you and Steve did talk, I wouldn’t be a factor, at least as far as cheating and all that goes. I didn’t want things derailed by worries over infidelity when you have plenty of other things to work out.”
They were so close people mistook them for brothers; yet in truth they were even closer – more like lovers who never dared admit that no one else would ever do.  He wants Bucky to remember
“This guy’s not as good as you.” Steve comments, jerking his head toward tonight’s entertainment, an older guy named Paulie who takes the two nights a week that Sam doesn’t. He’s not bad, exactly, but he doesn’t play with the same heart as Sam, the same finesse.
For one brief but wonderful moment, Steve returns the kiss with equal fervor as if the response is automatic.  But then his hands are flat against Tony’s chest on either side of the reactor, pushing him back.  He doesn’t push hard, just enough to get space between them so he can get words out.
He smiles as Tony steps into the tiny space and takes the washcloth from his loose grasp, and proceeds to slowly wipe his skin clean. Steve stands still as Tony sets about putting him to rights, situating his pants back on his hips, buttoning and tucking in shirts, setting his suit coat back on his shoulders.
“And was he?” Pepper is a little unsettled, but not nearly as surprised as Tony would’ve thought.  Tony shakes his head.
“I just watched you do it.  I can do it.”   Steve physically moves him back and takes his place.   “Put on the suit.”  Tony stares at Steve’s fingers, moving exactly over the keys Tony first tried to access SHIELD.  “
“I’ll give Happy a ring. You can go on out without me, if you want.” The far wall of his bedroom is floor-to-ceiling windows, with the exception of one glass door off to the right side. Tony picks up the receiver and points toward the exit, but Steve doesn’t move. Tony frowns at him, finger still stuck in the first number on the rotary dial. “What, you don’t trust me to call you a ride? Unless my tying you up and taking you hostage is a fantasy of yours, I have to say I’m a tad offended.”
“If this is the part where you suggest Russian Mob again, Stark, I may have to castrate you.  I’m not connected, I have no relatives in Little Odessa, I just happen to be a popular person.” She adjusts her black and white polka dot circle skirt, checks the seam of her red stockings with an imperious, distracted air.
Peter tries to keep his gaze locked on Tony but his body betrays him, his eyes darting toward the door through which Steve just left.
He opens his mouth to tell the guys that he’ll be back shortly with what they need, but their discussion of Dum Dum’s indiscretions has escalated into a good-natured argument over who has made the biggest romantic blunders in the past. Each is sure one of the others has made far more embarrassing mistakes.
He considers protesting but she starts the engine.  The blades whir to life but they don’t drown out the new addition of ricocheting gunfire.  Dr. Ross swears under her breath and starts flicking switches and checking controls with a more assured competency.  Grace under fire, he thinks as he feels the helicopter shift as it rises, that moment when something goes from dead weight to airborne.
The train is empty enough now that he and Tony don’t necessarily have to sit directly beside each other, and Steve misses the close proximity of their seats at the ball game, with Tony’s elbow jostling his side, his thigh pressed casually against Tony’s knee.  Steve had much preferred that to the roomy box seats Tony originally proposed.
The mansion is lit up invitingly when they arrive, and Natasha greets him in the foyer.  From the looks of how far she’s into the book held in her hands, it seems she’s been waiting for a while.
.  He and Tony hadn’t discussed it, but they seem to be living the city by staying on the couch, like the metropolis on screen is a fair trade for the one outside the window.  It’s been a good week since Steve went outside for anything more than his morning run.  He’d even let JARVIS order groceries in rather than doing the shopping himself.
And Pepper knows that things have changed.  That Steve really is pure-hearted and wonderful and everything his father made him out to be, but he’s also human and imperfect and even more amazing than Howard ever let on.  Maybe more than Howard ever knew.  She knows that Tony and he are okay.  Maybe even friends.  What Pepper doesn’t know is that Tony’s been dreaming of Steve at night – hot, heavy dreams where Steve’s buried deep inside of him and making Tony groan out his name as they come together.  Not enemies, not friends, but lovers.
“I’m sorry.”  He doesn’t understand why Steve’s apologizing, but the pain loaded into those two words breaks his heart anyway.  He feels it shatter, all those cracks and fissures giving way.  His hand tightens in Steve’s hair and Steve sucks in a ragged breath.  “Tony, I…”
, enough that Tony can feel it drip from his lips and onto his chin, his chest. He doesn't care. Steve actually does taste good – that hadn’t been an ego-stroking lie – barely bitter and surprisingly light. Tony swallows it down greedily and Steve exhales a shaky string of expletives, shuddering all over again.
The kiss that follows sends a shudder down Tony’s spine. Steve’s tongue and teeth lave over the delicate skin of his throat; in the mirrored wall of the elevator Tony can watch what Steve’s doing to him. The visual is as arousing as the physical sensation itself.
“What do you want from me?” Steve turns around to face him and Tony nearly collides with him.  Steve reaches out a hand to catch him as he wavers this time and Tony pauses, breathes out a pathetic little puff of air, and then looks up at him.
“Yeah, it may not be pretty but it’s functional, and it’s where we’re going.” Fury cuts Hill off.  “It’s already been re-tasked this way.  Should be here within the hour.  Secure Barnes and then attend to your injuries.” Fury hobbles toward the door, dragging his leg behind him and gritting his teeth through the pain.
“Right…” Tony nods, looking down to where Steve kneels on the floor.  He just now notices Steve’s got hair sticking up at the back of his head, rumpled from sleep, and for a moment Steve seems so young and innocent that something in his stomach twists and clenches.  “Because where else would you go?”
’s nose, frowning. Tony rolls his eyes at his best friend as he ducks out from underneath the plane, wiping his greasy hands on a rag.
Steve is oblivious to the rest of the world, caught up in his drawing. There’s a furrow of concentration in his brow, his bottom lip worried between his teeth, and a dark smudge of graphite along the side of his hand. He’s probably drawing Tony.
Steve gets the sense that maybe he could, that Tony might understand, but he doesn’t want to put that on Tony now. They’ve been together for one illicit, amazing night – he’s registering how his body aches now, and it is a
Tony smirks, noticing that even in his apology, Steve didn’t actually profess a change of opinion about the Tower.
He originally thought the bathroom needlessly large, but with Natasha blocking the doorway it seems too small.  She must sense his unease because she backs up, allowing him enough space to pass her and leave if he wishes.
It’s silly, but some days when he’s feeling a little rough, he treks to the sets that are designed to look like New York City. Luckily, Stage 30 isn’t that far from “Brooklyn” so he won’t spend too much of his break today making the walk. They’re shooting some De Havilland picture down at the end of the avenue at “Washington Square,” but he avoids getting in their way and finds a stoop on which to cop a squat.
“Oh.  Good." Steve stands, looks down at his own clothes and finds them surprisingly unrumpled.  Tony seems to read his thoughts.
Steve’s eyes open at that, long dark lashes fluttering, and Tony smiles as Steve’s gaze focuses immediately on him.
“I really mean it. The thought of being able to give this to Steve, I dunno…it doesn’t make me feel sad, or jealous, or whatever it is someone might think I should feel. I feel
“That makes me want to suck you again,” Steve says, hand stroking down to grasp, and Bucky shudders again sharply with the overload of sensation. A weak spurt of come drips from his tip onto the couch cushion between Steve’s legs.
She knows that at some point Howard stopped talking about Steve Rogers and grew bitter and sad, snapping whenever the subject was brought up; she doesn’t know that’s when Howard began drinking more heavily, or that’s when his parents’ fighting became an everyday fixture in the Stark household.
“Hey now.” Tony glares, shaking his head and wagging his finger.  “That’s the thanks I get for putting you up?”
Steve kisses all the way down to Tony’s hips, his legs, his feet, with his hands following slowly after the path of his mouth. It feels like worship and Tony knows he’s been forgiven for earlier tonight, for leaving Steve alone when he should have been there.
to get more firepower in the sky.”  He sounds incredibly disheartened.  Tony traces a thumb over his own palm, as if thinking of the repulsors lit there when he donned the Iron Man suit.  When he glances up, Steve sees barely contained regret in his brown eyes.
Tony will get Steve back, because he won’t be able to live with himself if he doesn’t, but whatever they were building toward,
Cap’s words are the last thing he remembers before waking face up in the street with the Hulk towering over him.
He’d turn the television on, but he’d searched the channels earlier, twice, and found nothing interesting.  There’s a new saying about that, he knows, but he can’t quite remember how it goes.  But he agrees with the sentiment. TV had been cutting edge technology when he’d gone off to the war; now even he’s bored with it.   There’s more of everything these days, yet nothing feels right.
relationship advice.” Tony sits down on a packing crate and leans back lazily, looking up at Rhodey with a triumphant smirk.
, you mean something between you and me, right?” Bucky takes another careful step toward him, his hands still in his pockets.
“Of course I hated you.” Tony rolls his eyes. “You were everything to him. He was chasing you all over the goddamned world, gone for months at a time…” He frowns, lips pulling tight. “And when you came back, and you were you again? You knew him in a way I never could. Fuck it, Bucky, if we’re finally being honest with each other here, I wanted to blast you through a wall. I was so fucking jealous.”
“I’m working on a new suit for Sam, using my repulsor tech.  What he does now can only be called ‘flying’ under the most liberal definition of the term.  With those stupid wings, it’s basically like he’s strapping a jet pack to his back.  He’s gonna end up like George Michael terrorizing Sudden Valley.”
But Tony said he could handle being ruined. Tony said he could come through it. Tony has money. Tony has power. And Tony left
“I really gotta start boning up on some pre-Eisenhower references here, don’t I?”  Tony remarks, plopping down on the stool next to Steve and shoveling a fork-full of eggs into his mouth.
“Being a consultant is hardly dangerous, and leaves plenty of time for me to save the world in other ways, like my awesome clean energy projects – cars are next, wait till you see the prototypes my guys are workin’ on.” Tony almost goes off on a tangent, sharing his plans with Bruce an exciting diversion, but manages to rein himself in and keep on task.  “Besides, I like the idea of bankrolling you guys, making you all neat toys and awesomely amazing uniforms.  I’m Charlie and you’re my Angels.”
But he finds nothing concrete to account for the feeling he gets every time he looks at it.  It’s more beautiful than the most advanced equation he could ever fathom.
He could really get used to this.  In fact, the thought of returning to mornings without exactly this makes him thoroughly and completely depressed.
The need to be skin-on-skin with Tony is sudden and overwhelming. Steve sits up, and in an undignified scramble, gets Tony’s dress shirt off his body and throws it aside; he kisses Tony messily as they both fumble with his pants.
Beckett reminds him of Peggy, and since Steve had announced this with a proud smile rather than a sad look of regret, Tony figures the television show must be doing him some good.  Tony even deigned to sit down and watch it with him once or twice as Steve marathoned his way through five seasons.  Steve really is picking up some quite modern habits, binge-watching first among them.
Tony leans over Steve with no warning, body stretched across Steve’s lap as he evidently reaches for the remote that rests on the end table.  Steve tries not to move, not to breathe.  Before Steve even thinks to relax, Tony’s back in his own spot and clicking the television on.
While he’s never been comfortable with sitting in the back alone with the driver up front – he’s a poor kid from Brooklyn and that whole class division reeks of snobbery – he’s stuck here now next to Tony’s driver in the small front cab of the coupé, and sitting beside someone demands conversation. He can’t think of a single thing to say to the man.
His cock is already sliding between Tony’s cheeks just from the position Tony’s put them in. His tip catches the rim of Tony’s hole, slipping inside just a little. It’s an easy move; Tony is slick and open.
“Why, Steven, I do believe those are called photographs? It’s not a new technology, I’d have been sure you’ve heard of it.” Loki replies with a deep chuckle. Steve’s hands tighten involuntarily on the photos, crushing their edges. “No need to be careful, I can always make more. I assure you – the negatives are safely stored.”
“Oh, so we’ve decided to cancel, good to know. Apart from that, you have a development meeting at three o’clock, and Mr. Hogan should be delivering those items from storage that you requested.”
“I’m fine, Steve,” Tony backs up, waving him off as casually as he can.  “Don’t worry your pretty little head over it.  After talking to Betty, Nat thought she had a lead on the bastards who took you - Thanks, Dummy.”  He pauses in his explanation to take a towel that his robot is insistently nudging him with.  He is pretty gross, sweaty and streaked with oil, so Dummy might have a point.  “So we had a bit of a team field trip.  It wasn’t exactly a walk in the park, you know how these things go.  Most of them got away in the end, Lukin included." He wipes his hands and tosses the rag aside fitfully, angered at the thought of how many escaped the brutal punishment he'd wanted to exact.
“You’re a real surprise, Rogers,” Tony says, the last name sounding affectionate. “I really didn’t expect to like you so much.”
Bucky carefully moves the mug onto a coaster and clears a space for the white paper deli bag he’s brought in with him. The smell of food must pull Steve from slumber.
His shoes catch on the ridge where the stairs collapse, but Steve steadies him without comment, and also pulls him out of the way when he stops in his tracks, at a loss for where to go.
“Bucky. Me and you, and me and Tony…those situations couldn’t be more different. It’s not fair to compare.”
“Yours,” Steve mumbles in agreement, but his lips find Tony’s. Before Tony has time to register confusion or worry, Bucky continues.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about.  I’m physically incapable of looking anything less than one hundred percent amazing.  Today?  Actually one hundred and two percent.” Tony gestures up and down his body, knowing that however exhausted he feels he
“I suppose.”  He doesn’t mean to, but he drifts off into a memory of being fifteen, sitting in the rectory courtyard and drawing spring blossoming pink amongst the trees.  Bucky had somehow managed to scrounge up enough to buy him fancy Sakura Cray-Pas oil pastels for Christmas that year.  Steve had been torn between using them constantly to draw absolutely everything and using them only for the most special occasions in order to make them last as long as possible.  He knew Bucky put in long hours at the shop just to help pay the rent; art supplies were an extravagance neither could really afford.  Steve probably could’ve snuck home some ink and paper from his work at the comics studio, but it hardly felt right to do so.
, now his and Wanda’s names are up there in big, boxy, black letters. In the recent remodel the old red and white sign was replaced with undulating waves of green neon,
seem to be appearing out of nowhere like they’re being teleported down to Earth, replenishing in flashes of blue light over a strange fissure in the ground somewhere near the northern border of Koreatown.
“Good man.” He taps the open notebook in front of them, getting back to business. “So what else you got for me?”
A brand new Buick Roadmaster cruises down the avenue, its maroon paint job spotless and its chrome shining. The top is down and Steve instantly recognizes the passenger despite her large, dark sunglasses and black, feathered capulet. He would never comment upon it, but he can’t help but notice she’s clearly dressed in yesterday’s clothes, a strapless evening gown and shoulder high gloves. Her diamonds shimmer in the sunlight.
“The only way I’m ever playing that song is if Ingrid Bergman herself walks in here and asks for it. If she can stand it, I can stand it.”
“I brought wine,” Jan says as she sees what Bucky has in hand, and Bucky amenably puts his beer right back and re-directs himself to finding a corkscrew in their messy collection of utensils.
“Are you ill?” Pepper asks point blank, rising from her seat and coming around the corner of her desk. Her hand’s already out to feel his forehead as she approaches him. Tony ducks away from her reach, getting up and going back to his office doorway.
“I have no problems making that deal.”  Tony replies quickly, holding his own hand out now for a shake.  Steve obliges but doesn’t linger, pulling away as fast as he can.
He gently pushes his body at Steve’s and Steve moves with him, too dumbfounded in the moment to fight it. Even though every inch of his body is screaming for him to shove Loki away, fear holds him back. Not fear for himself, but fear for Tony.
Steve’s lunch consists of some questionable bologna on stale bread, because it’s Bucky’s turn to do the shopping and he hasn’t quite gotten around to it yet.
“Did you say something?” Tony inquires and Steve shakes his head quickly, not ready to explain.  It’s raining harder now, so he and Tony wordlessly agree to jog toward cover underneath the arches of the lower passage of the Arcade.
asking you a favor.”  She repeats his words, folding her arms over her chest and staring at him blankly, waiting for him to realize the implications.  Natasha Romanoff doesn’t ask for favors, much less of Tony Stark.  “Just be decent and do this.”
Bucky shifts, angling his body purposely away from Steve’s.  His eyelids slowly close against the morning sun.  He doesn’t say anything more.
Bruce is following him, jogging in order to keep up.  He doesn’t know if Pepper is following suit, but if she is, she’s coming in her own time.
On his whim they drive up to Mount Rushmore.  Tony quickly discovers that looking at presidential faces carved into the side of a mountain is boring as hell and that there is nothing to do in the entirety of South Dakota.  He ends up sitting too close to Steve on one of their hotel room beds, watching
Suddenly Steve is picking him up, lifting him like he’s nothing at all. His legs wrap around Steve’s waist tightly as Steve sets him on the counter, pinning him there with his weight.
They are in an Italian restaurant, sitting so close to one another that it had unconsciously been a romantic date long before either of them realized it.
“Great, now Thor’s going to take that as a challenge,” Clint mutters as he gets up from the couch, circling around to get to the table.  Darcy slaps his hand away from the pans and then gestures to Bruce and Betty, waving them over so enthusiastically it’s like she’s flagging a plane in.
He manages to pry open his eyes, mostly because of the tears welling and spilling out, but everything’s blurry and bright, his vision obscured.  There’s something shining directly into his face.
“If that’s what you think you’re doing, you’re wrong.” He replies softly. He leans his elbows on the railing of the balcony, head hanging heavy for a moment. Tony watches him out of the corner of his eye as he lets out another long breath and then lifts his gaze toward the ocean, and then slightly higher toward the sky. It’s probably a trick of the moonlight but Tony thinks he can see the stars reflected in Steve’s blue eyes. He seems to search the heavens for something; though what it is, Tony doesn’t know.
“Are you getting philosophical on me, Banner?  You should stop it, it’s not a good look on you.”  Tony lifts himself up and sits on one of the counters, jostling a rack of vials nearby.   He picks up a stack of Bruce’s paperwork and rifles through it – most of it is SI memos and guidelines, but there are some magazines, and one single letter addressed directly to Bruce in a decidedly feminine scrawl.  No return address.  Curious, he lifts it up to the light but the paper’s too thick to make anything out.
“Hands off, woman, get your own.” Tony squeezes in between her and Steve, waving his arms exaggeratedly to create space.
Probably why Fury won’t let him within ten feet of Barnes.  So just coffee and eye drops for now.  He runs his hands through his hair and then down over his face, trying to get a grip on his thoughts.  His mind is getting muddy and it’s not usually like this, when he has a mission, has a purpose, usually it’s all so
“Valomilk Dips?  Primrose candies?”  Steve sets down his carving tools and rifles through the plastic bags and small boxes of candy.  They’re all familiar little pieces of his and Bucky’s shared past.  Bucky used to bring him candy all the time when he’d be laid up in bed, and even though Steve’s sure some of it was shoplifted, he’d never had the heart to call Bucky out for it.   “Red Hots and Peanut chews?  Buck, where’d you find all this?”
“You don’t mean that.”  Steve states crisply, apparently thinking it’ll brook no argument if he declares it in Captain mode.  Steve should really know better.
“Look at you blushing, you’re adorable.” How she knows the color is rising to his cheeks, Steve’s not sure, because she still hasn’t spared him a glance.
“Really?” Steve asks before he can stop himself, curiosity getting the better of him. Bucky cocks an eyebrow at his enthusiasm and Steve can feel his cheeks flush. He quickly focuses back on stirring chopped basil and minced garlic into the tomatoes, and tries to play it off as mere conversation. “That must have been interesting.”
He hands the rolled up paper to Steve with a flourish.  Steve unrolls it to find a number of ads already circled in purple ink.
Tony starts pulling up all the background information he can on Sam, using Extremis to run through it and highlight any pertinent or compelling facts.  Another New York City boy, born and raised in Harlem.  Twenty-nine.  Once a street thug, now he’s all reformed, a good little social worker doing community outreach in New York’s toughest areas.  He also keeps pigeons on the roof of his building as some kind of neighborhood project for the kids, like he’s some kinda Terry Malloy.
Clint shrugged off such incidents as if they were of no matter. Two years ago, he lost hearing in one ear due to faulty rigging setting off a staged explosion far too early, and he now counts anything less than that level of serious injury as a mere flesh wound. He likes to joke that he made it through the whole real war without getting a single hit, only to get injured in a fake one.
He considers art galleries –MoMA or VOLTA or some DIA space – but he figures all that quiet and all that art wouldn’t push the past from Steve’s head.
He narrows his eyes at the information in front of him, the images and words starting to get blurry.  He needs to find eye drops.  He opens desk drawer after desk drawer, seeming to remember having some at some point.  He needs the eye drops, then he needs coffee, and then he needs to go back to SHIELD and slam Bucky’s head against the wall until the man gives him something he can
Following Bucky’s lead, Tony picks up the small tube of lube discarded on the nightstand, its cap already loose, and arranges himself along Steve’s right side.  He coats a finger liberally and snakes it down to join Bucky’s in the task of opening Steve up.
The ride back is tense and silent.  Whenever Steve glances at Tony, the other man’s gaze is firmly directed out the window.  Steve doesn’t know what to say; Tony’s clearly upset but Steve doesn’t know how to fix it.
“And again, I don’t have the faintest clue what that means.”  Steve can’t stop his exasperation from bleeding through this time.
Steve’s been denying this love of theirs since he was fourteen years old and he’d gotten so damn good at it. He’s awed at the wondrous feeling of simply…letting it all go.
The familiarity is a bit forced, still half an act and half real, but Steve’s sure they’ll eventually manage to fix this.  Stop trying and just be.
“Definite rain check.  You don’t know it yet, but I already beat you.”  Jane grins at him playfully, biting at one corner of her mouth.  She reaches across the table and in mock challenge pokes his bicep with a finger.  Steve holds back a chuckle and manages to play affronted.  Her poke turns into a more defined grab and she makes an impressed noise.  “Well, Darcy wasn’t wrong about that.”
Darcy Lewis stubbornly holds his gaze, cool blue eyes daring Steve to doubt her. He gets the sense that she’ll judge him harshly if his stare wavers in return, so he resists the urge to glance away and relieve the tension.
"You're always saying I need to relax and have fun - now I do, and you're acting like I've killed someone."
“That’s the spirit, Mr. Stark,” Maria replies dryly. Tony finally shoots her a look over his shoulder, tilting his head down to look at her over the rim of his wire frame glasses.
Tony dips his head again and begins kissing the delicate skin behind his ear, the place that he knows makes Steve a little weak in the knees. He disentangles their hands and runs his palm down Steve’s arm, over his hip, smoothing down his body beneath the sheet to slide over the swell of his ass. Tony’s deft fingers part his cheeks and brush over his hole.
Tony turns away from the both of them. He sits down at the piano with an ungraceful thud, but then he drifts his fingers over the black-and-white keys more gingerly.
Maybe it’s just the sharing of intimate details, but suddenly he feels like he and Tony are standing too close.  He takes a few steps away, coughing to clear his throat.
Tony can’t lie.  He’s going to enjoy the hell out of learning every inch of it, figuring out what makes Steve moan, what makes him beg, what makes him come.
Steve Rogers.” Tony repeats. He holds up a hand, blocking the upper portion of Steve’s face from his line of vision, remembering that nose, mouth and jawline below the cowl and imagining the incredible body in front of him dressed in Captain America’s red, white and blue costume.
“Look up.”  Tony instructs him, pointing to the ceiling.  Steve does, and his breath leaves him in an awed rush.
“Catch more flies with honey, Steven,” Sam retorts, smiling back. “More flies with honey. Get that belly full, make ‘em all warm and happy, secrets be spilling like Niagara Falls. Worked with you, didn’t it?”
“At the very least, you would get a good story out of it. We can only hear about Thor’s hunting expedition in Lapland so many times.”
“I appreciate the effort, Barnes, but Pepper’s stocked us up for more trick-or-treaters than can possibly exist in Manhattan.”  Tony hadn’t wanted to participate, positing that opening the grounds to the public would be a disaster waiting to happen, but Coulson had arranged tight security and Pepper thought it would be excellent PR.
marked across the bottom corner of the personnel form is atrociously tacky.  He wonders whose job it is to make
He and Bruce are going to build something, right now, and he’s excited to start getting his hands dirty.
“You were an artist?”  Tony tries to imagine it, but it’s a lot like trying to picture a stereotypical high school quarterback painting happy little trees.  The only thing that comes to mind is one of those silverback gorillas you see in the documentaries that learn how to sign and finger-paint.  Steve as an artist does not compute.   He swallows down his disbelief and tries to imagine Steve as he was,
He doesn’t smoke, but he should really carry a lighter for these types of moments. That would be suave. Bucky is always ready for
Just then Steve walks into the room, grey t-shirt sticking to his damp chest and a towel wrapped around his waist.
“And here I thought it was because I was so dashing,” Tony smirks, and then sighs theatrically. “Very well then. Tell me, what else is on the agenda for this afternoon besides that meeting that is now cancelled?”
“What do you want.” Steve demands flatly, still locked in horror at the condemning photographs. “I’ll do anything for you not to run these.”
“I couldn’t find a pencil down here.”  Steve finally pours himself his glass of tea.  “Would you like some?”
!”  Thor contributes, pounding his fist on the coffee table in joy, happy to have made a suggestion.  Everyone falls silent and looks at him questioningly.  He’s crestfallen over the lack of enthusiasm.  “The singing dog who wears the sunglasses?  No?”
The rest of the apartment is dark, save the overhead light in the kitchen. It bathes Steve in a warm glow as he stands by the sink, alternating between taking small slips of water and turning the glass idly in his hands. He keeps his face downturned and his long eyelashes flutter against his cheeks beautifully, delicately. For so large a man, he seems fragile.
Peter swerves from the little detour he took to think of Steve and Bucky in bed together and returns to thoughts of Steve and Tony. Steve sweaty and hard, bent over as Tony takes him from behind, to be particular.
He stands and lurches toward her, grabbing the pictures from her with a bit too much force. Just the sight of her holding them makes him want to retch. She puts up her hands in surrender, stepping away.
“It wasn’t.” Tony replies, and Peter hadn’t realized he’d said that all aloud. “I mean, it was like 20% of it.” Peter stares at him. He winces. “Okay, maybe 25.”
“You were,” Bucky smiles softly, but then he spots something over Steve’s shoulder and the smile falls abruptly, his face turning hard.  Steve turns his head to look, concerned.
a team. Despite the fact that Steve and Sam Wilson have been roaming the globe in search of him for months, Captain America slides back into his position as team leader so easily each time they gather in pursuit of this scepter. They’ve become almost as adept at tracking HYDRA as the Winter Soldier is himself.
“That is...remarkably adult of you, Tony,” Rhodey comments, faintly surprised, and Tony grunts in offense.
“Just sleep.” Tony murmurs, closing his eyes.  After a long moment, one that seems to last forever, Steve turns over and fits his body against the curve of Tony’s.
She turns from Tony, spinning on her heel and coming in close to Steve.  To Steve’s surprise, she rises on tiptoe to peck him on the cheek.
“No time, Iron Man.”  Steve flags him in one direction, signaling he’ll take the left on his own.    Tony shakes his head.
Steve has never expressed so much emotion over any of the city’s changes; he’s mostly taken it in stride, ever adaptable.  Maybe Tony should’ve called in a favor and taken Steve to some place he’d never seen before, like the private rooftop garden at Rockefeller…but Tony figures the day’s events might have more to do with his exclamations than any real attachment to the old train hub.  Steve was probably going to lose it over something; it may as well be this.
He puts the bottles of water back into the refrigerator and closes the door slowly.  The whole floor is quiet enough that he can hear the whir of the ice machine working inside the freezer.  The AC clicks on then, cool air seeping from the vents high above his head.
“What?  You don’t think this Stark’s gonna be another Hughes? That guy's already driving RKO into the ground and it's only been a year.”
Steve shifts, pushing up to sit, and Bucky catches sight of the Iron Man plushie that’s tucked against his side.
to switch. Despite the fact he’s a muscular mass of a man, he might still want to bend over and take it from someone smaller.
Steve accepts the gesture this time. Their fingers twine together loosely, palms barely touching. It grounds Tony a little, but his heart continues to race. While the distance they walk in silence is relatively short, each minute seems to expand infinitely.
That morning Tony woke up cold for the first time in months, finding Steve curled up on the opposite side of the bed.  The small space between them felt like the distance between galaxies, leaving him feeling unsettled the entire rest of the day.
“I don’t care if you’re fine.  I’m cold,” Tony retorts as flames flare up in the grate.  Tony’s fingers tap out meaningless patterns against the couch’s frame, his hand almost directly behind Steve’s shoulder.  The glow from the arc reactor is cool blue through his thin white undershirt, and his black silk pajama pants seem to shimmer in its light.  Steve knows silk is supposedly luxurious, but to him it looks neither warm nor comfortable.
Inside are a series of black and white 4x5 prints. He sets the envelope aside and turns them right side up to look.
“Name your price, you know I’d offer you anything.” The words tumble out unbidden, but he means them. His eyes lock on Steve’s and they hold one another’s stare until Steve flinches and looks away.
“Gabbing with me will beat sitting on the bus, I assure you. God knows why Stark hasn’t engaged a car service for you, that really should come standard.”
They rest back against the pillows, heads mere inches apart, and Bucky pushes Steve’s hair back from his sweaty forehead as they look at one another.
“He put his mouth on you? Kiss you all over?” Tony looks up at him with hooded eyes, a lock of hair falling loosely over his forehead. He already looks debauched, turned-on. It makes Steve’s head swim.
still arrest people for this, don’t they?” He snaps the photographs from Steve’s hands and slides them back into the inside breast pocket of Steve’s coat. “You can keep these – I have copies.”
“I’m a little put out that I’m not going to be able to fuck you for a few days because Bucky evidently
“If I had to guess.  But I don’t much like guessing.”  She replies as Clint steps aside to cover the ascending staircase; she kicks open the door and enters the hallway, both guns drawn.  “Clear. “
“I know you do.” Pepper tucks her long hair back behind her ears and forces her gaze to Steve.  “Be careful.”
It’s probably better than living in Brooklyn, where his old neighborhood is little more than a fading memory.
“Then we’re friends.  And I mean it.”  He reaches across the table and takes Steve’s glass of orange juice.  “This coffee really is wretched.”
“That…” Steve quickly tries to consider reasons for saying no, and apart from his perpetual awkwardness around beautiful women, can’t find any. “That would be very nice. How kind of you to offer.”
“Or all of that. It can be more than one thing. I know you’re capable of stuffing down a veritable hurricane of emotions under that stoicism of yours.” Steve shifts in his seat, the tight line of his mouth setting deeper. “You’re smaller now, though, so there’s less room to hold all this stuff in. Better just let it out before you explode.”
as their ring tone?” Pepper retorts coolly, arching an eyebrow, and Tony ducks his head sheepishly and frowns at his phone, the traitor. He flips the setting to silent, though it seems that’s shutting the gate after the horses have bolted. “And I’m assuming that since we’re not turning the plane around and hightailing it back to New York, Steve is okay, so what’s going on?”
“I hate you so much right now.”  Tony mutters and slumps down to the floor.  Steve feels bad about it later, but he has to laugh.
Steve tries to force his eyes open but it’s like his lids are stuck together.  He tries to breathe but there’s something stopping him, covering his nose and his mouth, there’s something down his throat and even through his stupor the panic starts to build.  Why can’t he move?
Tony doting on him. Steve used to get downright cranky when Bucky was acting the mother hen, as if every time Bucky offered his help, it impugned his honor, his manful pride.
But he steps forward, pulling the heavy door closed behind him. Without the light from the wine cellar striking the sharp planes of his face, the finer details of Steve’s expression are lost in shadow.
“We’re not enemies.” Tony replies simply, then drinks slowly, gauging him over the rim of the glass.
Tony taps his hands against his desk, fingers dancing over its surface. He’s not sure what he’s looking for – his reading glasses, maybe? He pats his breast pocket – no, those are his sunglasses – then his other pockets.
He sits on the smooth, cold cement in the orange-yellow glow of the security lights and listens as thunder rolls faintly in the distance. It is starting to rain.
“Welcome back, sleepyhead,” Bucky says gently, resisting the urge to reach out and run his hand through Steve’s messy hair.
The next morning Tony wakes from a surprisingly restful and undisturbed slumber to Steve opening the door, two large coffees and a bag of pastries in hand.  He hands it all over to Tony and sits quietly, doing nothing, as Tony digs in.  Steve’s eyes are red, his skin is pale, and he’s clearly been up for hours.  Tony begins to suspect that not only is there someone on this planet who can function on less sleep than he, but that he’s not doing nearly good enough a job at being a distraction.
Steve pauses for a moment, taking a deep breath and looking Tony in the eyes to make sure the man understands him this time.
.  He has to.  He’s not a stupid man, and he’s read all the files and reports.  “You should go back to bed, Tony.”
“He offered me a job.” Steve abruptly directs the conversation away from who he did or did not sleep with. It's awful and downright yellow-bellied that he'd rather have Bucky believe he went to a prostitute than have Bucky know the truth. But he can't bring himself to say that he had sex with a man, much less a man that he is - or was - genuinely interested in. He's too weak to even consider dealing with the fallout that would cause in their friendship.
“Is ‘yes’ enough for now, and we can work out the particulars later? Because I…” His words drift off as their mouths brush together once, then twice. “Literally all I can think about right now is touching you. I can’t think of anything else.”
Bucky climbs off the sofa and crosses the cramped room in a few wide paces, giving Steve the cigarette. He clamps his hand over Steve’s shoulder for a moment before passing toward the kitchen.
He stares at the garish TCI advertisement for as long as he can stand it, then switches to deciphering the
Tony repeats in his head, imagining what it would be to wake up to Steve in his bed every morning. Blond hair on his pillow, the vast expanse of pale, perfect skin against his silk sheets, that shining fabric slipping over Steve’s immaculate body as he rolled over in the morning sunshine, sleep clearing from those brilliant blue eyes as Tony’s mouth claimed his to kiss another day hello.
“That’s right, you can’t fuck a library book.” Pepper replies. Tony glares at her harshly, but it has little effect. “And Steve’s okay with this?”
Steve laughs bitterly, boggled by how one person can be so utterly contrary, attacking him one moment and assuring him the next.
“If it was about love, he never would’ve stopped looking.”  Tony says it softly, not really realizing he’d spoken aloud.  He shakes himself from it, and quickly sets himself to moving, adding fresh ice to his glass.  He opens the bourbon with a hard tug and pours himself too much. “I sometimes wonder if Howard ever realized the tiny,
The last of Bucky’s clothes hit the carpet with a heavy thud and Steve places his palms on Bucky’s thighs without thinking, smoothing them up toward Bucky’s hips as he climbs back onto the couch and straddles Bucky’s legs. He bends to take Bucky’s cock in his mouth.
“Yeah,” Bruce looks surprised, and a little touched, by Tony’s question. “Of course. It’ll be nice to see her again.”
He hovers in front of Bucky for a moment more and then tilts his head, surveying the force field that blocks any of them from getting too close to the opening in the ground.
He doesn’t wait to see if Steve is actually following him; he winds his way through the house and up the back staircase to the screening room.
“Me.  You.  Vroom-vroom.”  Tony holds his arms out and rotates his fists like he’s holding the bars of a motorcycle.  Then he taps on the driver’s side door and bends over slightly, leaning on the side view mirror as Happy lowers the window.  “Hap, we’re gonna get something to eat down that way.  Wanna join?”
“Nothing to be sorry about, Pete. Nothing to be sorry about at all.” He sounds somewhat amused, but Peter can't believe that's not a front, that he's not offended.
Steve stops protesting when Tony stops moving and starts staring instead.  Steve doesn’t have his shirt on.  Or shoes.  Tony uncurls his fingers from around Steve’s belt buckle and takes a step back, but other than that he thinks he manages to bluster past it quickly enough.  He grabs the jeans he wanted Steve to try and shoves them over, pointedly not leaving as Steve strips down to his brand spankin’ new Ralph Lauren underwear and begrudgingly puts them on.
the new variable in the equation. Hmmm.” Tony claps his hand to Peter’s thigh, dangerously close to where his cock is still—how,
“I know, Pepper.”  Tony knows her patience is wearing thin.  He can push the sarcastic humor only so far before it stops being a defense mechanism and turns into an offensive weapon.
!” Bucky doesn’t give Tony time to reply to his filthily possessive question, just lets go of the tight hold he’d had on Tony’s cock. Tony loses it near instantaneously.
“Yo, Stark.” Clint says sharply and when Tony looks, he flips him the middle finger.  Tony’s nonplussed.
He stares at the ceiling, arms folded in toward his chest and his fingers tapping out idle rhythms against the metal and glass of the arc reactor, until he hears the elevator doors open and Pepper clicking her way back into the room.
After the meal is finished, Bruce bars him from the kitchen because Thor wants to learn how to wash the dishes.  Apparently an incident with the dishwasher at the tower had left him wary of using a machine.  Steve leaves them to it.
“She and Hank have been separated for months, that's not news,” Tony scoffs. “Who is printing this tripe? Quill?”
They’re really just swaying together now, rocking slowly back and forth.  It’s not complicated like the dances he used to watch from the sidelines, the ones Bucky could do with ease.  Tony probably knows harder steps, could show him if he asked, but Steve’s happy like this, not really learning anything but how to be close to someone.
the head of his crew. When he leaves the soundstage to walk the backlot in his work clothes, he always feels a bit underdressed.
Tony tilts it toward Steve, giving him a direct whiff; Steve can’t help but perk up, the scent stronger than the smelling salts his ma used to use when the stench of city trash baking in the summer sun got too strong. Steve looks up at Tony, his bloodshot eyes wide, and Tony wiggles his eyebrows at him.
Tony swallows hard, his hands stilling on Steve’s thighs as Steve almost imperceptibly spreads his legs just that much wider.
“His girlfriend was British, Tony,” Pepper replies distractedly, her eyes sweeping the tiny joint for a sign of Steve.  “I hardly think he’d be lost over a little slang.”
If you would like to avoid this content, I would recommend skipping from "When he stands back upright, Steve nearly jumps out of his skin to see another reflection in the mirror beside his." until the end of that scene.
“The night is young, stay awhile longer,” Sam entreats kindly, and Steve hedges, torn between his honest desire for the quiet of his apartment and the innate need to avoid disappointing the people who matter most in his life.
“And you’re known for your tact.”  Pepper retorts, but Tony stops her mid-eye roll, reaching over and taking her hand.
Bucky stares at him for a moment, face pale, and Tony wonders why the hell he looks so surprised.  There’s no way that either he or Steve could’ve thought their relationship was a secret – neither of them are dumb.
“We gotta go,” Steve states when he pulls away and Tony fights it, dragging him back. “You should go put on the suit.”
Steve feels sleep tugging him back under, pulling at him with insistent fingers.  He doesn’t want to go.  Bucky chooses that moment to turn back, satisfied that the agent has gone to get him medical attention, and it’s enough to keep him awake.
He looks up at Tony standing in the doorway, the dark circles under his blue eyes giving away the fact that he evidently hadn’t slept as well as Tony had.
Tony puts his hand on Steve’s hip but the intense pull between them has snapped and broken. The light, whatever it was, had given Steve a beat to come to his senses and even in the relative darkness, on Steve’s face Tony can see rational thought winning out over desire.
“I don’t give a shit about the stupid movie. Forget it. Cancel it all. I’m settling this with Borson and then I’m done with this bullshit town and its bullshit people.”
“So you did go dark on purpose.”  He comments and Steve looks weary as he slips his wallet into the back pocket of his new jeans.
“What’s wrong with this one?” Maria inquires, her voice as sharp as the jab of her pen as she strikes out another name on her notepad.
He barely gets a glance at the space he was being kept in – a small medical bay, lined with empty singular setups of beds and machines.  All the cots are empty; the one he just vacated is the only one that shows signs of use.
Steve can’t really bear whatever’s happening with him and Tony right now so he lets their conversation drop.  He notices there’s a half full glass of water on the stand beside the bed and reaches for it.  It must be Bucky’s but they’ve never minded sharing.  He can’t quite make his hand function correctly, his fingers clumsy, and he ends up knocking it over.
“I haven't been following the Hollywood news while out here,” he replies. “Taking a much-deserved break.”
“And Bucky knows what he’s talking about?” Natasha’s amused chuckle is throaty and deep. Her low voice has always been more of a cat’s purr than a birdsong. “I know Bucky’s opinion matters the most to you of anyone’s, but you’ve never had a problem forming opinions of your own, Rogers. What did you think of Tony Stark when you met him? Anything like his father?”
Tony looks toward Steve again.  He wants to rebut Natasha’s statement but is momentarily distracted by watching Steve run a hand through Bucky’s messy brown hair.
Darcy leaves behind bright red lipstick on the edge of her glass. She’s got a pretty smile, and her eyes spark with mischief to accompany her wide grin.
“He craves the attention,” Pepper says.  “His addictive personality doesn’t start with work and end at alcohol.”
“I actually have something to show Steve.” Tony explains, looking up as Steve walks into the room with perfect timing.  He’s fresh from the shower, clothes sticking a little to his damp skin.  Tony smiles at him, ignoring the double pull of lust and affection.  “I have something to show you.  Come on.”
Steve hears Natasha’s flat greeting from the kitchen and he quickly takes his pan of eggs off the stove, flipping the burner off.  In the living room he finds Pepper standing rigid just inside the doorway, looking at Natasha with obvious surprise.
Steve smiles back at him warmly now, all too innocent and wholesome for what Tony is currently recalling.  He holds Steve’s gaze, remaining silent but smirking until Steve seems to pick up on the tenor of his thoughts.  When Steve unconsciously licks his lips, Tony knows they’re now both on the same page.
“Steve.”  She nods at him coolly, pulling her ear buds and tucking them, along with her iPhone, into her carpet bag. “What’s goin’ on, you guys?”
“Dum Dum, that was Barnes who sent her your way. And you were so drunk, you didn’t notice until she took you up to her room.”
“Be there in a minute.”  Bucky hangs back, nudging Steve to go on.  Steve doesn’t bother pointing out that Bucky’s now being just as obvious as the others had been ten minutes earlier.
“Well.  I can’t possibly read any more about conic-section interference fringes.”  Bruce closes the journal and takes off his glasses, rubbing the bridge of his nose.
“Bite me, Dum Dum.” Morita makes an obscene gesture in his direction and both Dugan and Jones chuckle. “Quality work takes time; I take pride in my craftsmanship, unlike some people.”
For one brief, horrific moment, Tony worries that he may turn the corner and look up to the loft, find Steve running those amazing, strong hands of his over Bucky’s body, but he quickly dismisses the thought.  As a fear, it’s downright insane, because Steve would never do that to him, and he understands that as surely as he understands gravity and mechanics and the speed of light.  But it’s still a fear that won’t go away for good, maybe because he wants to be Steve’s
“No, that’s what you think.  Every time the Avengers Assemble, you spin out of control like this.  I never thought…”
“Make yourself at home,” Bucky mutters around a mouthful of toothpaste, not sounding all that gracious.  He doesn’t ask if Tony’s here for Steve, because that much is a given.  Tony wanders toward the living room as Bucky disappears down the hallway, giving the bathroom door a cursory knock before barreling inside.  Tony can hear the shower running.
He always thought Natasha was just quite adept at reading him, but maybe all women are this remarkably astute and he’s simply never been around them enough to realize it.
of – the strange pull of attraction between them, Steve doesn’t quite trust the man, or trust himself around him.
“There you are,” Tony greets him as if he’s the one who’s been waiting. Steve squares his shoulders and stands up straight as he takes Tony’s proffered hand for a shake. “Thank you for coming to meet me here. I’m having some renovation done on the Malibu house, it’s a bit of a mess. Well, it’s a huge mess, actually. I may have accidentally blown something up. Not a big deal, but it’s a
Steve exhales a long, slow breath, not knowing how to explain it. Tony’s lived his whole life in the spotlight – he’s never known anything else – and he’ll probably never understand how uncomfortable Steve feels about the pursuit of fame. He holds Tony carefully away from himself for a long moment, and then opens the bathroom door. He heads back to the bedroom, Tony trailing behind him.
Steve tries to pretend he didn’t just have that thought but it doesn’t work.  He knows Pepper and Tony are on the outs, but that doesn’t give him the right to think such things about his friend.  He coughs, shaking himself out of it, and then falls back into the rhythm of Tony’s banter.
“Steve…” Tony reaches up and runs a hand through Steve’s hair in what he hopes is a comforting fashion. “That was
“Come on you two, quit playing grab ass and get down here.  Thor wants pizza.”  Barnes calls back, and Tony sighs, pulling up the number for Ray’s and trying to decide if ten pies will be enough.  Fifteen’s probably safer.
“I’ve been trying to…well, it’s just that whenever I see something new in the city that I like, I draw it.”
Tony has no idea why conversations with Steve tend to go this way, like Steve isn’t sure that Tony’s really asking what he thinks he’s asking.  They’ve had their issues and all, but Steve acts like Tony’s constantly laying out traps to trip him up and that’s never been Tony’s intention.
“A thing?”  Natasha nods, frustratingly vague, and Tony makes a face at her.  “You and Clint are always going off on ‘things’.  SHIELD-related ‘things’.  Fury should really be sending us all out on these ‘things’.  You know, team building and other such nonsense.  Misadventures and the like breed brotherhood.  Or so I’ve heard. I never got much into the whole frat thing at college.  I think I’d enjoy hazing Katniss, though that’s just a guess.”
But he doesn’t mean it’s changed in the obvious ways.  For Tony, it’s smaller than that…and larger than that.  It’s something intangible, a sense that the city he once knew is somehow just…gone.
at compliments.  Both giving and receiving.  Oo, that ended up a little dirty."  Tony looks pleased with himself, his eyes dark, pupils dilated in the dim light of the park.  His hair is in disarray and has been ever since he took his baseball cap off during the sixth inning, and coupled with his blown gaze, he also looks wild and…aroused.
Steve Rogers stopped following him two days back, and now in a twist of fate he finds himself following Steve Rogers.
Steve’s cock is ramrod straight except a very slight curve upward just before the head. That curve, Tony knows from experience, is a curve that will naturally hit that practically perfect spot inside of him. It’s like Steve’s cock has been molded to fit Tony’s body, a god-given gift to provide Tony pleasure. Any thought of asking Steve to bottom disappears so quickly that it’s like he never considered it in the first place.
“I would—if you do too. Tony is willing.” Steve sneaks a glance at Bucky’s face, trying to get a better sense of his reaction. Bucky is watching him with equal scrutiny, which probably means that they aren’t actually getting much of a read on each other at all. “Polyamory is what they call it; these days there’s a helpful term for everything. It’s not exactly usual, but it’s not unheard of.”
Maybe if Steve were in a less bitter mood, he could admit that he’s selfishly a little pissed at having one of the very few people he knows decamp for greener pastures, but right now he doesn’t want to think it’s about Stark abandoning
It’s safe and warm in the apartment, so inviting against the dark, snowy night that blusters so much harsher around the tower, this high above the ground.
“Because this place is so much better,” Steve snorts. Their apartment is poorly designed, windows not allowing for any cross-breeze to circulate the air in and out. In the dead of summer, their rooms become a veritable maze of portable fans; small ones and big ones perched perilously wherever there’s a nearby electrical outlet to be found.
“Oh holy fuck, Steve,” Bucky gasps, every inch of his body snapping taut as Steve sucks at the head, tongue laving the sensitive tip with attention. He’s never done this with anyone but Tony, and the ways that Bucky reacts—both the similarities and the differences—are exciting.
Steve meets his eyes and Tony sees it then, that hidden fear suddenly all too evident.  He wonders how long Steve’s been like this, waiting for the other shoe to drop.  A rush of self-loathing swells up within him.  He’d doubted Steve, vaguely, for two days and could barely stand it.  He’s getting the sense Steve has been doubting him for much longer than that.
“Don’t forget kickball Sunday in McCarren.  And Ultimate Frisbee on Monday!” Clint’s voice chases after them.
“Isn’t it?”  He replies.  He can’t describe how Steve stares at him then, but he doesn’t really like
“Hello,” Tony answers and rises from his seat. His hand is on Steve’s stomach, peeling that wet fabric upward so he can touch bare skin, feel the lines of muscle shifting underneath his fingertips. His belt buckle is mere inches from Tony’s hands and Tony reaches down, pushes worn leather through metal.  He slips the copper button through its hole, drags the zipper down. There’s nothing but bare skin underneath. Steve inhales sharply. Tony looks up at him, finds Steve staring down at him with barely concealed lust. He's trembling.
moment when two dirty looking guys in beaten clothes walk into a high end clothier and nearly get asked to leave.   It’s resolved the second Tony whips out his credit card and his thousand-watt don’t-fuck-with-me smile, charming and threatening at once.  Lo and behold, miracle of miracles, they recognize him then.
“I'll bet she has,” He snorts. “Tell me, Jan, how's Hank?” Tony quirks his head toward her, accusatory. Tony seems to be getting the wrong idea about him and Jan. Steve doesn't bother to correct him, reminding himself that Tony has no right. It doesn't much matter as long as Jan's unbothered.
“Steve Rogers, ma’am,” Steve takes her hand; Tony’s surprised he doesn’t kiss it in some quaint old-timey gesture.  But he gives it a quick, firm shake, accompanied by a pleasant but staid smile.  “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Miss Potts.  I’ve heard nothing but wonderful things about you.”
Barnes stands up, taking a few steps toward them, letting his metal hand trail along the edge of the counter.
“Tony!” Pepper is stalking toward him, which is quite a feat in her fashionable high heels. “There you are! Where have you been?”
“I’m sorry about…” He runs a thumb carefully over the burn, trying to judge how bad it will be.  “I didn’t mean to scare the crap out of you.”
“Well, I know the lyrics, but I don’t know about teaching you the music. Guess I could hum it for you.” Steve shrugs and circles around, taking a seat on the edge of the bench beside Sam. He’s careful not to interfere with his playing, but Sam shifts slightly to his right anyway, giving him more room.
Bucky reluctantly pulls off of Steve’s dick, wiping his lips and leaning away when Steve doesn’t lie fully back down on the bed.  Instead, Steve keeps himself propped up on his elbows and watches, looking down the length of his body to where Tony is buried between his legs. His hips thrust toward Tony’s face and Tony takes it, enthralled by pushing the boundaries of Steve’s self-control.  He lifts Steve’s legs up over his shoulders and delves his tongue even deeper into Steve’s body.
“Pepper’s in Japan on business.  And it doesn’t really.”  He doesn’t know why, because theoretically a loved one by his side should be reassuring, but when Pepper sees him like this it only makes him more upset and it all becomes a vicious circle, feeding itself into a bigger frenzy.
“Oh, I don’t know.  I don’t suppose too much can be asked of you, but I must admit I expected something old-fashioned and lame like: ‘Your smile makes me all twitter-pated.’  At the very least.”
Steve knows when they go back to the mansion, Tony will disappear off to wherever Tony disappears off to, and he’ll be left alone.  The thought of returning to his lovely but lonely bedroom isn’t at all appealing, but telling Tony that he’d rather stay here and stare at the rain hardly seems an option.
“I’m a master of the perfect buzz,” Tony claims.  “Your empty stomach is nothing but an asset here.”
“What the…” Tony starts, eyes widening.  Instantly curious, Steve turns to actually look up at Thor.  A red bandana is wrapped around his head like a sweatband and his look is overall more lumberjack than usual, given that it looks like he hasn’t shaved in over a week.  Which may not seem that bad except that it seems like Thor can grow a full beard in a single afternoon.
“Speaking of Natasha, where is the fair lady warrior as of late?  I have not seen her much during my stay.”
There’s an array of folders in two stacks on the nearby table and the SHIELD logo stamped across the face of one catches Tony’s attention.  An open folder tops the smaller stack; Tony recognizes a photo of his father anywhere.  The big red
goes unsaid and Steve knows that the implied reprimand should keep her from bringing it up again, if only because she’ll be so irked at his presumption that she then won’t want to talk to him either.  If he’s managing to bear the fact that Bucky wants to see only her, the least Natasha could do is let him deal with it how he deals with it.  He’s not interfering and he’s not criticizing, and that should damn well be enough.
“You feel so…” Bucky gasps against his lips, the rest of his words disappearing into another kiss. He adjusts his stance, hips shifting a little to the left, and Steve moans into Bucky’s mouth. His leg slips down from by Bucky’s shoulder to bend around Bucky’s waist, heel against the small of Bucky’s back. It’s like they fold into one another; for right now there’s nothing in the world except Bucky’s body against his.
“Hell, Steve,” Bucky gasps, grabbing his hand and pushing it away. Bucky quickly twines his fingers with Steve’s however, wanting his touch somewhere even if he’s too overstimulated for what Steve intended.
“What…precisely is going on here?”  Tony makes a vague gesture around Steve’s person as he takes in the set of blue and white striped button-down pajamas that are hanging off Steve’s body.  They’re about a full size too big, which makes Tony wonder how and where Steve even found them.  And if he bothered telling Thor that he’d found a store with off-the-rack clothes made for giants.
“I appreciate that,” Tony replies, sounding not at all grateful. Jan's smile thins and her eyes narrow.
“Steve Rogers, you are Brooklyn through and through.  Don’t tell me you’re thinking of defecting.  Tony, is this your Park Avenue crap influence at work?”
“Hmm?”  Steve slowly opens his eyes; the effects of the kiss leaving him slow to catch up with Tony’s meaning.
Steve picks up the tee and sweats Tony had tossed onto the bed and turns back around, holding them up with a skeptical look on his face.
“You notice she’s always finding you clothes?  You’re her life size Ken doll,” Tony says as he and Steve run down the stairs, through Tony’s workshop to the connecting garage.  He hits a few buttons and the MARK VI case begins to open, pushing pieces of the suit forward as other parts of the cavernous garage begin to light up and roar to life.
“Except I can, Bucky. I can. And it’s okay. This time is yours and Steve’s. Only yours. We’ll talk more when I get back—when we know exactly what it is we need to talk about.”
, Tony thinks, and pushes the chair aside, closing the gap between them.  He takes hold of Steve’s arms.  He’s so warm to the touch, solid and sturdy – here, not dead, not asleep, but here, and
Steve, on the other hand, looks remarkably un-rumpled, hair parted and combed perfectly, pristine white tee stretched taut across his chest and the drawstring of his blue pajama pants tied tight around his hips.  It occurs to Tony that given Steve’s appearance, he probably hasn’t even laid down tonight, much less tossed and turned while trying to chase that impossible slumber.
“If you’d like to correct the record, I actually do have an issue on which I’d just love for you to comment.” He says this with such barely disguised pleasure that Steve immediately gets the feeling he’s walked right into a trap.
offered him a job opportunity. “And my crew,” Steve adds belatedly, trying to sell the encounter better.
“And then call Happy and let him know I’m headed back to New York tonight. Make all the arrangements.”
“Eeesh.”  Tony shakes his head adamantly, refusing to take it.  “If you think Scorsese’s version of New York is brutal, you probably won’t care for that one either.”
“Pepper took the liberty of getting some more clean clothes for you.  Not that that outfit doesn’t look great and all –“ Tony reaches out like he’s going to touch the dark fabric covering Steve’s chest beneath his leather jacket but stops at the last second.  “ – but I figured you might want something else seeing as how this trip of ours is, at this point, indefinite.”  Tony runs his hand over the rack of shirts and pants, the shelf full of folded sweaters, then opens and closes a few drawers of the dresser.  “Yeah, looks like she’s got everything you might need.  Holler if there’s something we forgot.”
“Maybe good sense is overrated.” Bucky shrugs and then starts gathering everything he’d brought from Streit’s to put it back in the deli bag. “I’ll stick this in the fridge with your name on it so Clint doesn’t steal it.”
Peter looks up as Steve enters Tony’s workshop, surprised to see him entering so casually, without even pausing to knock and without the usual announcement from FRIDAY that a guest has arrived.
“Cool down, Cap.”  Tony pats his arm, haphazardly trying to pull him back down.  “Say hi to Pepper, I don’t think you two have ever actually met.”
“You’re insane, go to sleep.” Tony mutters, reaching up and grabbing the book along its top edge. Bucky doesn’t startle, he just turns his head slowly and looks down at Tony, raising an eyebrow. He pries Tony’s fingers off the book and places them back on Steve’s arm.
“Putting me up or putting up with me?” Bruce asks, though he’s smiling so Tony’s not too worried that he means it.  At least not completely.
“Guys, so sorry I’m late, I just…I got caught up and then…” Bruce apologizes, flustered, as he squeezes in to the last seat left open at the long communal table, across from Natasha and beside Thor.  His thin tie is hanging loose, his purple-checkered shirt half-unbuttoned, revealing a hot pink t-shirt with a unicorn emblazoned across its front.  He’s carrying his dark green grandfather cardigan folded over one arm and his thick glasses sit crookedly on his nose.  His curly hair is rumpled, like he hasn’t combed it in days.  “I don’t know where my brain is at lately, it’s like I’m two different people and I can’t keep things straight.  I didn’t even mean to stay that late, I hope I didn’t hold you all up too much.”
“A nice looking thing?” Tony repeats in disbelief as Happy helps him up from the floor.  He wishes he could’ve completed that move with more grace but he’s really getting too old to be spending nights passed out on marble tile.  Every part of his body hurts.  “A nice looking thing?”
“How you behave with Steve.” Natasha holds up a hand to stop him talking.  “You seem the most invested in Steve’s happiness.”
This new position is tenuous; Steve has to support most of Tony’s weight in order to get him at the right angle to slide back inside. Tony’s left hand finds the towel rack on the wall; the other clutches the curved edge of the sink. He wraps his legs high around Steve’s back as they clamber for each other again.
"I guess I deserved that." He admits, and somehow that makes Steve regret saying it. "That's why I'm here. Can we..." He looks over his shoulder toward the kitchen, getting a bead on where Bucky and Natasha went off to. “Can we talk?” Tony is already stepping inside, closing the door behind him.
“Ok, it’s been a while but we don’t have much choice.  You’re hardly in a state to pilot a helicopter, Captain.”
in particular. Who set up this meeting? I don’t want this guy, don’t want him directing this picture, don’t see why I have to sit down with him and pretend otherwise. It’s a waste of my time.”
Sam wraps up his song early, ending a verse and skipping right to the last few bars, played at twice the normal speed. A few patrons turn their heads toward the piano, curious. The layer of sound once provided by the music is noticeably absent for a long moment, but soon the murmur of conversation adjusts to fill it.
“I mean it, Tony.” Bucky pauses again, swallowing hard. "If you're counting on me being the bigger person here..."
something urgent and needy clawing at the edges of his mind, even though he takes his time and fucks Steve long and hard. He focuses on Steve’s pleasure, triumphant when Steve starts breathlessly begging to come. It’s always rare that Steve loses his inhibitions enough to be downright noisy, but he’s panting and whimpering and crying out now like he simply can’t hold it in.
Steve almost gets into the shower with the water ice cold, used to his and Bucky’s life of relative frugality. He has a foot in the tub before he reconsiders. The thought of the freezing water stinging his skin is unbearable; he wants comfort, not punishment. He could allow himself this, couldn’t he? Compared with the long list of sins he racked up last night, running up the hotel’s heating bill seems a rather small crime.
Steve smiles a little, his anger abating at the sight of Tony dripping like a drowned rat.  Tony drags his hands over his face and then pushes his hair back, thumbs his nose.  His undershirt sticks to him like a second skin and the arc reactor appears even brighter in the darkness.
“Oh for christ’s sake.”  Tony mumbles.  “Just one time I’d like to ask where Steve is and have someone tell me he’s watching reality TV in bed like the rest of the human race.”
“But you were thinking it.” Tony points at him, eyes narrowed.  He runs a hand over his goatee, making sure he hasn’t left any mess behind, and then throws his trash into a nearby can, tossing it in a perfect arc.  “3 points.”
Another song has started on Tony’s phone, so Steve quietly crosses the room and turns it off.   It’s not his unfulfilled promise to Peggy that haunts him as he waits in silence for Tony to come back, and he can still feel the ghost of Tony’s hand in his.
“Get in.”  He clicks his jaw tensely as he pops the door and nods his head toward the inside of the car.  Steve hesitates, having a bad feeling about where this is all heading.  He wishes Tony would look at him but the other man keeps his gaze fixedly elsewhere.  Steve brushes past him and climbs into the car.
knows what you were thinking.”  Natasha rolls her eyes.  “And I don’t think tattoos would stay on his skin anyway.”
“Steve, I’m back.  Got you some new threads.” He calls over the sound of the running shower, flipping on the table lamp by the closer of the two beds.
Objectively he knows it’s a good piece of work.  It’s balanced in form, balanced in color.  It’s equal parts sleek and jagged, kinetic and still.  There’s a sense of movement and a sense of force, like trying to contain something that refuses to be contained.  He can parcel it down to its separate pieces; admire its construction and how it functions.
“Both. You know how I love to mix business with pleasure.” He smiles as he moves in close, smoothing his hands up Steve’s chest. Steve doesn’t miss that there’s an anxious edge to that grin, a tinge of that vulnerability that Tony too often tries to hide.
“I did too,” Bucky shoots back.  “I asked for one and Sister Mary Constance told me greedy little orphans go to hell.”
“Nigel, a pleasure as always. Some weeks ago, I was offered a viewing of your wine cellar, but I demurred. I do hope that’s still possible?”
“We’ve been looking for him for awhile, Steve.”  Natasha murmurs.  “I didn’t want to say anything in case it all came to a dead end.”
It’s like Steve forgets to breathe, the rise of his chest simply stopping mid-inhale. By the time he finally exhales, Tony has his answer.
While Howard had been taking cushy Hollywood gigs and his factories had been pumping out as many munitions as the metal supply would allow, Tony had been in Tunisia, unwisely trying to do his own part by using his Italian roots to his advantage. Thanks to his mother, he looked the part and could speak the language, and his background in military armaments made him a great candidate to infiltrate the Italian forces posing as a black market arms dealer.
“It’s Barton.”  Clint announces before dropping from a hole in the ceiling.  He looks a little worse for wear but he’s in one piece.  The blood on his arms and face doesn’t appear to be his own.  “I didn’t think anyone was able to get through to you.”
“I found that film to be greatly amusing yet rather silly.  But truly, this Madonna of yours has shape-shifting skills worthy of Asgardian magic.  I laud her gifts.  It is no wonder many of your religions worship her.”
For one brilliant moment, Steve sways toward him.  It’s not a kiss.  It’s less than that, it’s not even close, but it promises everything he never thought he could have.
Steve and his best pal continue hitting all the Big Apple sights, playing tourist as if they’re foreigners and not native New Yorkers.  It hardly seems to matter that most NYC landmarks haven’t changed much since Steve and Bucky left for Europe in ’43; they want to see them anyway.  Clint and Natasha go with them almost everywhere.  He suspects that is part Fury’s doing because the director still doesn’t trust Barnes in the slightest and wants to keep an eye on him.  This will probably be the only thing he and Fury will ever agree on.
Bruce sighs, pushing his magnifying glasses back up to the bridge of his nose as he looks up at Tony. His brown eyes are distorted and watery behind the thick lenses. “If the camera’s not working properly anyway, what’s the point?”
“Everybody take five!” The 1st AD, Victor, shouts from somewhere out of sight, his loud voice echoing throughout the sound stage.
, because he knows Tony left uneasy and wouldn’t have returned this self-assured if he hadn’t been eavesdropping.  He pauses, and Tony keeps going a few paces before realizing Steve has stopped.  Tony circles and backtracks.
Steve finds their designated seats toward the front of the house and slumps down with relief. The worst part of the night is over; sure, the audience and critics may hate the damn picture, but it might actually be a blessing in disguise if the premiere makes no kind of splash and the film slips into obscurity. He’d much rather that than to have it be a major hit that he must keep discussing and re-living for the rest of his life.
The demigod brings him back to the others and deposits him gently onto the cracked floor. Together they stand and stare over the city from the gaping hole in the side of SHIELD’s headquarters.
Steve’s sure Tony won’t tell him the truth so he angles his own gaze through the tinted glass and watches the city go by.  So many people.  So many of them still reeling from the Chitauri invasion.  He doesn’t know how much more the city can take.
He slips his hand around Steve’s waist toward his front, fingertips dipping dangerously below Steve’s belt.  He feels Steve tense; he doesn’t want to take it too far – okay, he
Steve sighs, pushing off the railing and pulling open the screen door. He stops short inside the entryway, surprised to find Natasha sitting calmly at their kitchen table, sipping coffee and reading the paper.
“Luxury condos and sushi bars, Chase ATMs and Norman Foster bull shit,” Natasha is still muttering to herself, stabbing her fruit.  Clint reaches over and takes her fork from her, shaking his head no.  “Seriously, Clint.  Whole Foods.  CBGB? Gone!  Yet there is a
“Okay, punks, lemme show you the kitchen.”  He claps his hands together once, drawing everyone’s attention, then sets off down the hall.  “I hope one of you can cook, because I sure as hell ain’t ever going to.”
“You’ll never stop looking.”  Pepper states, her voice strangely heavy, and then waits, looking at him like he’s supposed to say something.  What can he say?
Los Angeles is quiet this early in the morning. When Steve started his roadwork, the sun had yet to rise and the streets were empty. He’d arrived at Griffith Park just as dawn was cresting blue and pink against the muddy sky. The dilapidated Hollywoodland sign is barely visible through the morning haze as he pauses in front of the observatory to stretch for a moment before heading back down the hill.
“Tony.”  Steve mumbles.  He’s the only thing Steve can really see through the muddle.  He needs Tony.  Maybe he says it aloud.  He’s not sure.  The doctor glances at him.
“Hey, hey,” Tony says soothingly, picking up on the undercurrent of desperation in Steve’s actions. He tries to pull back a little so that they can look at one another, but Steve hangs on to him tightly, keeping him close. “What’s goin’ on?”
“Don’t worry, I won’t breathe a word to anyone about your torrid little love triangle,” Tony retorts, which only serves to make her frown more deeply. “But seriously, why
“I wanted to…I wanted to say that if you come up with any way, any way to deprogram me, or unlock my real memories, or
Tony is a far more rough around the edges, bruised and battered and maybe feeling his age just a little more than he’d care to admit.  His muscles ache and his goatee needs trimming and even Extremis seems to be running sluggish.  But the fact that he has enough energy to find Steve’s unkempt appearance remarkably sexy assures him that he’ll be just fine.
,” Tony presses, and Steve shrugs, still keeping his cheek pressed to Tony’s chest where the arc reactor used to be. Tony always says he can feel the difference there, despite Extremis having repaired that damage, but to Steve his skin has always felt smooth and perfect.
” Bucky replies, unable to keep the cutting edge from his tone, but Tony’s already walking away. He kicks one of Tony’s shopping bags as Tony leaves, the paper giving a loud and satisfying rip as he mutters to himself, furious. “I
“And that makes me…what? Older? Bruce and Clint fit the bill there too – and yes, I know Clint’s real age, that Dorian Gray punkass freak,” Tony blathers on in his confusion.  “I may be the oldest but I’m by far the most immature, and I
“Don’t do this to me, Tony – you can’t say that and then leave me.” Steve murmurs against Tony’s mouth, half-plea, half-anger. His hands are pushing at Tony’s shoulders, fingers grasping at the fabric of his shirt, even as he continues to answer Tony’s kisses. Steve’s own body isn’t sure what it wants to be doing.
