“You are, and you can’t argue against both of us,” Tony stepped in, lying down on his couch, pointing over at Bucky. “What have I told you about arguing against us when it comes to the subject of your greatness?”
“Just for me? That’s not what we agreed on,” Bucky pointed out, but he couldn’t help developing a smile big enough to make his cheeks ache. He didn’t know what Tony had planned, but he couldn’t help but be excited for something special for him. “Is it for the goats?”
“I should have seen that coming,” Tony said as both Bucky and Steve burst out laughing. “Ha ha, both of you. Let’s see who wakes up covered in dirt tonight.”
“Will I still be able to pull it back?” Bucky asked, looking up at Jarvis as he readied his newly cleaned scissors.
“So will your suggestions love me for me, or because I’m the king?” Tony shot back just as fast. “At least this way I’m pretty much guaranteed more honesty. I’ve socialized with the great courts of this land, and it’s pretty much a pit of vipers.”
“My people…” Tony began as the clamor began to die down, feeling a bit better that things were going well so far. “Welcome, all of you, to the first of many nights of festivities. Tonight has gone so well, I don’t see why we can’t do this more often.”
“Tony…” Bucky whimpered after not too long, still feeling sensitive inside, though it was only pushing him further towards a second climax. He was breathing hard, hanging onto both Steve and the pillow underneath his head, his grip intensifying on both. It wasn’t like the first time, though, the slow build up was replaced by a sudden flash, and before he knew it, he was practically screaming and squirming around hard as he came again.
“I’m kind of disappointed, I thought they’d be fancier,” Steve said as he held the ticket back out for his mother. “I suppose they’ll work though.”
“I…” Pepper dropped her voice, looking around to make sure no one else had slipped in the room. “I’ve heard that people that go to Latveria have a habit of not coming back. And those that go to look for them suffer the same fate. It could just be a story to scare children, Sire, I wouldn’t say that’s the truth.”
“Am I the only person you’ve been with, though?” Steve queried, wanting to know more than just that he was good in bed, though that did make him feel better about himself.
“You’re welcome,” Von Doom bowed his head again before looking up at Tony. “If you ever want more, I’m sure we could come to an understanding, of sorts. What belongs to Latveria is open to the Iron lands.”
“No, he says it’s not the baby making, but I think that’s got to be a close second, I mean…” Steve laughed as well, not feeling bad for making Bucky blush bright red. “So what is it, Buck?”
“It can’t be that bad…” Steve said, trying to sound more positive than he was feeling. “You seem nice enough.”
“I’m never going to be ready for this,” Bucky sighed, squeezing his friend’s arm harder as they walked forward into the banquet amidst a round of applause. Whether it was friendly or not was yet to be seen.
“Bucky! Steve!” said Tony from the bottom of the stairs, running into their circle of light to throw his arms around them both. It was a beautiful, but tearful reunions between the three of them as Bucky and Steve opened their embrace to welcome Tony into it.
“I think we should move this to bed…” Tony panted when the kiss finally broke, flushed with arousal as he reached down to pull his own shirt up and over his head. “What do you two think?”
“Wow is right,” Steve grinned, reaching behind him to grab a box of tissues, setting it on Bucky’s chest before he took a couple out to clean up his youngest boyfriend, surprised by how far up his body he’d managed to come. “Bucky, that was amazing, I’ve never came like that before in my life.”
“It’s for me when I’m working, you can’t knock it over,” Tony turned it on, picking up a half full water bottle, and setting it on the flat part. Taking out his phone, he walked it over past Howard on clawed feet, steering it up the wall as the table remained in place, until it was hanging from the ceiling. “See, it’s doing that part okay, the part it’s bad at…” Motioning for his father to step back, the robot came crashing down, the water bottle rolling under a desk as it went quiet.
“Do you want to do anything right now? What do you usually do in the mornings?” Steve inquired, unable to keep looking at the metal arm, not knowing a polite way to ask why Bucky had one.
“So I’m late, just send a plate down here,” Tony shrugged, leaning over to get back to work as he picked up another tool.
“I’m giving someone else a chance to step up into the job,” Tony said with determination in his voice. “My father took a chance, and it paid off. I’m going to try to do the same.”
“Yeah, Buck?” Steve responded, still rubbing Bucky’s shoulder as he watched his expression, wondering what it was that had Bucky so stumped. He could be slow with decisions, Steve was used to that, but this was the first time he could really see Bucky struggling with something. “Whatever it is, I promise you, I won’t get upset.” He was waiting for another horrible secret to drop, another reason to hate Howard Stark and to want to protect Bucky at all costs. He told himself he would be prepared for what Bucky had on his mind.
Steve reached over to touch Tony’s arm, giving it a reassuring squeeze as he began to cry openly, kneeling next to Bucky, desperately trying to hear for any of the emergency vehicles. He felt like someone had ripped his heart out, that he’d had everything he could have wanted and now he was watching it drain away.
“So what’s your idea then?” Tony knew his Uncle had one, though he doubted he wanted to hear it.
“Sire, we’re ready for you now,” Pepper came into the tent, going right over to Tony to start adjusting his outfit, smoothing some areas and puffing up others. “Were you lying down in this?”
“I think you two just don’t want me to sad. Even if we watch a sad movie, you’re so quick to start joking after, like I’ll break if I start to cry,” Bucky pointed out with a weak smile on his face. He was thankful that they cared for him as much as they did, even if they were too careful with him sometimes.
Exactly who was he working for?
“What is it?” Tony crossed his legs, the movements of his knee making his foot bounce.
Sitting in another cart, still holding his messenger bag against him, Steve was pretty sure he wasn’t getting a cake and gift basket today. He hadn’t realized until he got home and had a long time to think about this that it all seemed really weird. Stark Industries didn’t deal with medical testing, so why would there be a patient here? And what had they done to him, exactly? He remembered Ms. Carr telling him that Bucky would tell him if he wanted to, but he felt awkward at the thought of asking someone what made them special. It didn’t take long for him to decide that he wasn’t going to let his curiosity get the better of him with this job.
“He’s a warrior, I’ve heard of him taking jobs though,” the corner of Stane’s lip tugged up in a cautious smile as he spoke. “He’s good, he’s supposed to be strong and effective as killing. I’ve heard he’s taken on whole crowds and finished the fight without a scratch.”
“If it gets too tight, you can just marry someone random,” Pepper shrugged, though she didn’t know who to suggest off the top of her head.
“I would like…” Tony began, leading Bucky in and over to the bed, tracing his fingers down the small of his back. “Do you want to undress each other?”
“Package deal, huh?” Steve asked with a laugh, slipping the ring onto Tony’s fingers, grinning at him from ear to ear. “So you’re a thrifty relationship man, are you?”
“In here,” Tony said, opening the door to the garage, pulling a set of keys off the wall before walking over to a black SUV, pressing the key fob to start it. “Just get in the back, we have to go.” Opening the back door to help Steve get himself and Bucky in, Tony quickly jumped in himself, opening the garage door and hitting the gas.
“Maybe not…” Howard said, turning so the gun was pointed straight at Bucky. “But I’ll shoot him.”
“It’s just that King Von Doom has arrived, sir,” the man said hurriedly, trying not to nervously fidget with his hands. He’d been on the business end of much of Stane’s temper, he wasn’t looking forward to more.
“So is this, this is important to me,” Tony pointed to his work with the end of the tool before tossing it up again. “Making something the world hasn’t seen before, that’s what’s important to me.  I want to be the king that ushers in the next great age, not the one that did the same old shit until I died.”
“They told me you were coming with me to move,” Bucky sniffed, slowly relaxing in Steve’s arms, though he felt no less terrified of what lay ahead for him. “Father said when he walked in here that they were hoping you’d be a while, they’d even brought the box for me.”
Tony stepped off the bottom stair, looking into the clear bedroom at a tall blonde sitting on a bed next to another person with their face buried against their legs. “…so which one? Why are there two of them?”
“I think so…” Steve whimpered, his cock twitching inside Bucky as he felt Tony’s fingers hit that spot inside him that Bucky had told him about. Letting out a sharp cry, he gripped Bucky’s hips harder, his fingers turning his skin red. “Have you done this before? Sex with two people?”
“What’s he like? If I go in there, is he going to tear my head off?” Steve asked, wondering if he was going to be a gigantic pain in the ass. “What makes him special exactly?”
“When is this starting?” Von Doom had to say after a few moments of silence, the rest of the room murmuring the same question as they all sat in wait.
“And now as he watches down on us, I call forward our King, His Majesty, Anthony the first to come forward,” the priest said as he gestured over to Tony, who was doing his best to look broken up as he rose from his chair, slowly drawing his hands away from the coffins. “He has asked me to speak to you all himself about the lives of Steven and James, and as he knew them best, it would seem most fitting. Please, Your Highness, step forward and give us all a glimpse of these men, who have been taken from us too soon.”
“This is Clint, he’s here to kill me,” Bucky said nonchalantly, shrugging a bit, not moving from Steve’s side.
“Tony…” Bucky began, though Tony still seemed to want to talk, which he seemed to do more when he was nervous. “Tony, no, I don’t want to hold back at all, I want to be with you now. I’m fine, I promise.”
Bucky laid down on his back, pulling his knees against his chest and kicking out with both legs as hard as he could. He knew this roof had needed replacing back when he and Natasha moved in here, he hoped that was would work to their advantage. So when he felt his foot go through, he could have cried with relief.
“In here is perfect, we’ll get rid of one of the others, they’re mostly just nature anyway,” Tony looked around, trying to think where the picture would get a lot of light and focus. Pointing at an old painting of a bowl of apples next to a vessel of wine, he turned to the others. “What do you think about here?”
“I don’t want to say competition, that sounds harsh,” Tony shook his head, looking quite pleased with himself. “This entire contest was about fate, what chance would bring me, and it’s brought me both of you. So I can’t imagine doing anything other than this. I’d like to think I’m a fair King.”
“Would it sweeten things if we tripled your salary and bought you a Corvette?” Ms. Carr asked as she leaned forward.
“What is it?” Sam asked, picking it up and putting it in his own pocket before leaning forward again.
“I…that would be great,” Bucky took a deep breath, forcing a smile, really trying to be more pleasant than he normally felt.
“Clint?” Natasha drew the blade back, letting the man go, and taking a step to the side.
“I did to come here, I think that’s the best we can hope for,” Tony said as he sat down at the head of the table, keeping his hands back and out of the way as the servants rushed to bring him his food. “I did do some thinking, though.”
“My only worry is…” Stane took a deep breath in through his mouth, blowing it back out through his nose. “Tony says he loves them.”
“Can you hold me here?” Bucky whispered as he stared at the fetal monitor, watching the numbers on it, wishing he could see his babies on their screen.
“Thank you so much. Thank you so much for that,” Tony said, hooking up the ultrasound to the computer before sitting back on the couch. “We probably should have just waited until you’re up here for this. Sorry.”
“He’s cool, I like him, does he have a name?” Bucky leaned in, watching him with delight, reaching up to poke him when he stopped. “What’s a prototype? Is that what this kind of creation is called?”
“The same kind of things I do in the rest of the day, time doesn’t really matter down here,” Bucky said with a shrug, repositioning himself so that his legs were crossed and his arms were across his chest, hugging himself again. “…I have pretty much every video game ever made, every movie, I have some games I used to play with Jack under my bed, like chess and stuff, some other toys and junk…I don’t know…”
“Oh my gods, how much did we drink?” Tony moaned as he came from the other room where Jarvis had undressed the three of them as to not ruin their fancy wedding clothes. Now, just in their underclothes, they were finally alone for the first time all day. It was what he’d been waiting for since they were reunited earlier, and now that the time had come, he couldn’t help being nervous.
“I would imagine there’s going to be a fair amount of fraud surrounding this, sire, you are making a very large offer,” Pepper looked up at him, her pen still. “And I don’t mean just lying about traits. How do we make sure the tickets are one of a kind and not forgeries?”
“No, not really, I just stay at home most nights, or I go out with friends, but I’m usually back at a decent time,” Steve said, shaking his head a little. This question made a little more sense, but he quickly guessed that there was more to this job than she was going to tell him.
“The same way you do, he’ll appoint people,” Stane said with a bit of a shrug. “You of anyone should know you don’t need to sit in the throne all day for things to get done.”
“Yeah, but…both of them…” Bucky said, looking up at Steve again as he tried to move over a bit more.
“You HAVE to!” Steve pleaded, starting to break. “Bucky...”
“If you put dirt in the bed, I will kill you!” Steve said, though he couldn’t stop chuckling staring at Tony, shaking his head. “Just let her make a mess of herself, that’s what the hose is for.”
“I’m pretty sure Rhodey can look after anyone we pick up,” Tony sipped his coffee, looking thoughtful for a moment. “…and if it goes that badly, I can just pick one of your people. The North guy or something.”
“I’m still asking for those boots,” Fury chuckled, shaking his head as he went back over to his spot on the rampart.
“It’s better to have you here and have that gone,” Bucky said finally, looking up into Steve’s eyes, smiling at him as the last of the stress of showing off his arm left him. They weren’t disgusted, they were treating him like normal, he wasn’t being pushed away like he so dreaded.
“Tony, I know you’re in here,” Howard said, looking around the room to figure out where his son was hiding, his best guess being over by the pile of metal he’d watched Tony bring in piece by piece. “This place is a mess.”
“You’re so special, you know that?” Tony laughed weakly, holding Bucky close, feeling in that moment that there was going to be an end to the pain and loss he was feeling. “It has nothing to do with what you can do, and everything to do with who you are. You’re amazing, Bucky, I’m sorry how it happened, but I’m so glad to know you.”
“We don’t know that I don’t love this person yet,” Tony pursed his lips, looking up at the silvery moon in the sky. He wished Strange had done more magic, he’d never seen anything as beautiful as the sky that night.
“Ask Janet, she’ll know,” Tony smiled, genuinely thrilled that Steve was going to be happier here now. He wanted him to think that the whole castle was going to be his home, not just a few rooms. “And bring your mother, there’s no reason why you can’t, I don’t think Janet keeps this place too secretive.”
“You’re empty now, hopefully,” Steve said as he reached over to undo Bucky’s loose ponytail, gathering his hair back into a neater one before he put the elastic back on his hair. “There, you look gorgeous.”
“We’re not going to lose you, or our kids, just trust in us, okay?” Steve said, wishing he could believe himself as he said that. He wanted the burden of fear to be on himself and Tony, he didn’t want Bucky to have that cloud lingering over him for what could be his last time on Earth. He just really had to hope that he was being pessimistic for nothing.
“I would do anything for you,” Steve replied, tightening his grip as he walked along the side of the road, which was oddly more stable than the road itself. “You should know that by now.”
“It’s fine, really, I’m pretty much packed,” Dr. Marner said, waving off his concerns with a smile. She still felt bad for telling Howard where they were, and while they didn’t blame her, she still felt it was up to her to make sure Bucky was alright.
He wasn’t looking forward to this nearly as much as he felt he could be.
“This room is your room, you can do whatever you’d like in it,” Tony said, stopping beside the bed, pulling Bucky and Steve closer, putting an arm around both of them, his hand moving down to the smalls of their backs. “Now, I’m doing some thinking here, and I think the best way to do today is for you two to start. You’ve known each other for longer, wanted this for longer, I think I should let you go first, Steve. But then it’s my turn, if you’re still up to it, Bucky.”
“I’m very serious,” Natasha’s voice was serious, and Bucky knew he wasn’t going to be able to make her budge.
“I’ll start here. Don’t tell us til the end, we need to build suspense,” Tony said, figuring he’d seen them moving in that area not long before. “Okay, that’s an octopus. Where do I go go now?”
“NO!” Tony screamed, not even thinking as he lunged forward, tackling his father off the back of the couch and onto the ground, swinging his fists like a mad man before ripping the gun out of his hand. He didn’t realize Howard’s guard was coming up behind him, he didn’t even hear Steve breaking a chair over his head to take him out. All he could see was Howard’s face at the end of his gun, afraid and covered in blood, and as he pulled the trigger, all he could feel was hate.
As the elevator doors opened, he stepped out into the empty hallway, his footfalls echoing in his head with each step he took. “You can do this, Steve, you can do this,” Steve whispered under his breath, closing his eyes as he scanned his pass, listening for the accepting chime before pocketing the plastic card, opening the door with one hand as he balanced the box with another. Stepping into the room, he was about to say hello to Bucky when he realized there was someone else there, a nurse who seemed to be taking the boy’s vitals.
“She’d like that…” Steve’s eyes met Tony’s and he returned the grin, a warm feeling spreading in his chest. Gods, he was so happy to actually explore his artistic talents, to have the time and the materials, this was an amazing gift. After Bucky’s sacrifice for Steve’s health, it was the greatest thing he’d been given.
“What? No, this is nothing, it’s fine,” Tony said, clearing his throat as he wondered if now was the time to alleviate some of his fears about Bucky, needing to know that he wasn’t doing this for the wrong reasons. He couldn’t forgive himself if he brought any kind of harm to Bucky, so as hard as this might be, they needed to talk. “Come on in, there’s nothing here that will break or hurt you. Well, maybe some of that stuff in the corner, but don’t worry about that. Where’s Steve?”
“No to which?” Tony asked, making a face as he tried to mask his annoyance. He’d come up the Wizard’s tower thinking this was going to be easy if he insisted, but now he knew why Pepper had given him the job. The only foot he put down was keeping Strange from slamming the door on him again, and it was really starting to hurt.
“O-oh…okay, that’s…that’s hot,” Steve could feel his body responding to Bucky’s words as his heart beat faster, a tingle ran through him, and he felt his cock stir in his trousers. “I’m sure we can do that for you, have you in the middle while w-“
“If that’s what you two want, I’m on board,” Steve said as he opened the first aid kit, taking out a wipe to clean the area and a pad of gauze to put back on it. “Kids are smart, they’d figure out the truth if we didn’t give it to them, and they wouldn’t trust us. So I like this. We just have to tell them in a way that they understand.”
“We are going to be registering your retina scan and thumbprint once we get inside the elevator,” Ms. Carr said casually as if she was just mentioning giving him a key for the place. “Like I said, you will be placed on red star clearance, there are only a small handful of people that have it, myself included. You must carry your badge at all times, you will need it to access Bucky’s habitat. If you lose it, you must immediately contact me. Do you still have the phone I gave you?”
“His Majesty hasn’t told me what he plans to do in regards to that, my apologies,” Pepper looked down at the list in her hand, knowing she had to go visit the Barnes man next, though she was going to try to get a chance to talk to Tony about Steve’s question.
“I don’t know about that…” she said as she hugged her notebook to her chest, her cheeks burning brightly.
When Steve had informed Ms. Carr that he thought it would be best if he stayed close to Bucky, he was surprised how fast she had one of the rooms down the hall renovated for him. He was glad that there didn’t seem to be a problem with his marriage splitting up, and that living on lower level eight appeared to work for everyone involved. He didn’t have a kitchen down here, but the cafeteria was open all hours to provide for all the different shifts, and no one cared if he used the company credit card on take out. He missed the couch outside of Bucky’s room at first, but after a few weeks, he felt completely at home in his new room.
“Fair enough,” Tony nodded, figuring he could put up with that if it meant that Strange was going to participate. “Can I ask you something? Do you talk to other wizards?”
The spot wasn’t big, maybe the size of a grape, and it only went a few millimetres deep into the wood, a peeled back chunk exposing a patch of unprotected wood tinged a red ochre. Nothing around it was stained the same, the protective layer that kept the rest of the wood dark brown and smooth had done its job, though that one area still stood out, telling a story of what had happened that night. After Howard died, the cleaning service had tried their best to get the blood and brain off of the surface, and Tony couldn’t fault them for the job they did. It wasn’t one he could have done himself, even if he was the one to pull the trigger on his father himself, but seeing the aftermath was something entirely different.
“Eight? Okay, that’s not too bad, let me think…” Steve said, putting down the cards and holding up eight fingers so he could keep track of how many things he’d mentioned. “I collect Brooklyn Dodgers baseball memorabilia, I run every morning, I used to have an orange cat named Jinx, I used to get sick all the time as a kid but I grew out of it, I’m an artist or I try to be one anyway, my best friend is a pilot, my favourite food is spaghetti or hot dog cart hot dogs, and I’m married to a CIA agent named Peggy.”
“Fuck…” Bucky breathed, reaching down under the blankets to give his cock a squeeze, letting out a shaky moan. Just imagining Tony and Steve touching him at the same time, their fingers probing inside of him, stretching him out to make him ready, he couldn’t help himself. He didn’t know if he was supposed to refrain from touching himself, but it was fucking hard not to. Steve and Tony were both gorgeous, and strong, and sexy, and he didn’t know how he was supposed to last four days without even kissing them.
“You’re right, we are,” Steve agreed, taking a sip of whiskey, though he didn’t quite love it as much as Tony or Bucky did. He still had a taste for ale, though he was glad he could get better quality than the swill he used to drink. “We should take that trip to Wakanda that we’ve been tossing around, it would be nice to see a new place and meet new people.”
“He’s not overly strong, it’s only a precaution, they’ve never had an incident,” Ms. Carr said, knowing that Steve likely wasn’t going to like the next part of their conversation. No one ever did. “Bucky has an implant in his neck that is triggered by the panic buttons, as well as the doorway itself. If he tries to leave, he will receive an electric shock strong enough to destabilize him.”
“…fine, it’s yours,” Tony sighed, knowing that he couldn’t have his special day without Fury and his soldiers. He’d just have to deal with the purse masters later and hope they still gave him enough for the celebrations. They weren’t going to be happy with him for approving things for everyone, especially when it was just for a night of fun.
“You’re insane, you’re fucking insane, how the fuck did I not see that until now?” Tony shook his head, reaching behind him to squeeze Steve’s hand, feeling the tremors running through him as well.
“Yeah, I guess I should,” sighed Steve, bringing his hand up to try knocking again, maybe better this time, when the door opened and Natasha appeared before him. Dropping his hand back down, he clasped them behind himself nervously, forcing a smile. “Hi, uhm…is Bucky around?”
“I’m so sorry, sire,” Pepper approached him slowly, going to place a hand on his arm as she made it to his side. “This funeral, is there anything I can do to make it easier on you?”
Bucky just nodded, not sure what to think of that reaction, but afraid that if he tried to talk, his voice would just crack.
“We’re going to hold you every night,” Steve said, nuzzling Bucky’s temple, his hand moving under the younger man’s shirt to rest against his skin, trying to imagine the belly he was going to get as their child grew.
“Oh wow, look at the kids,” Steve said, pointing over at Penny, who was chasing her older siblings with Laika in tow. “Seriously though, Bucky, you know you want more, and you know we’re on this ride for as many as you want to give us. We’re not going to pressure you.”
“You don’t want that, I’d name them them something nerdy,” Tony laughed a little, trying to think of something off the top of his head that wasn’t his father’s name. “Uhm…Luke and Leia? No matter what we’re having, that’s it. They’re just Luke and Leia.”
“It’s not bad, really, I had to figure out a new running route and I’m getting used to delivered groceries, but it’s okay,” Steve said, not wanting to complain, not when Bucky had it so much worse. “It took me a while to get used to not having windows, I always feel like it’s night in my room, it’s not nearly as bright as yours.”
“Are you sure?” Strange could see that something was bothering Tony, but he didn’t seem to be very forthright about it.
“I’m not cold, I’m scared!” Bucky insisted, unable to help the tears that were rising in his eyes. “I’m sorry, I love you two so much, I didn’t mean to yell.”
“Are you supposed to meet with the King today? Did he say if he’d be coming to visit?” Sarah asked, leaning back in her chair, feeling like royalty already.
The day of the draw had arrived, and the entire town square had been turned into a giant party for old and young alike. Musicians had been hired to play both on stage and around the edge of the crowd, and the King’s favourite acting troupe were brought in to amuse the people as well. There were trays of sweets and barrels of drink, and as the night began to fall, coloured lanterns were lit all over, bathing everyone in a rainbow of light. It had been the wizard Strange that brought the biggest show, however, managing to terrify most of the adults and delight all the children with balls of light that shot through the sky and turned into shapes above their heads. When it all ended with a giant, glittering butterfly exploding into thousands of tiny ones, the cheers from the crowd had been deafening. If Tony meant to win over his people with this spectacle, he would have done a good job. The grand finale, however, had yet to come.
“Can you really?” Stane questioned, leaning forward. “Do you want to spend your life with someone who only loves you for your money?”
“I’ll have you looking like a proper Prince in no time, sir,” Jarvis nodded at Steve’s reflection before turning back to his work.
“I feel…I feel…” Steve’s lips were parted, breathing heavily as he was pushed into Bucky’s tight body, making a strained noise as he felt like his cock was being milked as Tony was fucking him hard. He felt like every nerve in his body was singing, he wanted to scream at the top of his lungs. The intensity just kept growing, and he didn’t know how much longer he could last.
Steve jumped, sending a scoop of protein powder across the counter instead of into the blender with the spinach, chia seeds, and frozen blueberries he’d taken forever to put in there. He’d been slowing down for weeks now with all the pressure of Howard Stark on this conscience, even though he’d only seen him a handful of times since he began his job with Bucky. He found himself getting increasingly paranoid, which wasn’t helping his routine, especially his sleep schedule. It was getting harder to hide it from Peggy, even with her work schedule taking her out of town every few days. He knew he couldn’t keep putting it off, he couldn’t lead her on forever that he was in love with her, especially now that he could be putting her in the line of danger.
“Uh huh…” nodded Tony, though his mind was quickly drifting off of the topic and back to the project he’d been working on. “Say, why don’t we revisit this in the morning? I have some things to do, I can think about what you had to say, and we can figure it out from there. Sound good?”
“Look on your phone. Look up ultrasound and yolk sac,” Bucky insisted, looking at the screen, not sure what he was feeling about all of this. “I’ve been feeling sick the last week and a half, and that makes sense with it just being the yolk sac right now. It would mean I’m five or six weeks pregnant.”
Looking at the stylus sitting next to the tablet, Steve thought it over for a moment. It wasn’t that he was completely attached to his job, he liked it, though he didn’t make as much as his wife, Peggy, but the benefits were great and it was a short commute. He had been hoping on a promotion soon, and a raise, so he could look into buying a nice hybrid car for himself. He was also wondering if he could ever pay for a place of his own. It wasn’t that he didn’t love Peggy, but he knew he was a much different person than he was when he married her after college. She deserved someone with a lot more passion for her, and he deserved to be happy.
“Leave him,” Tony didn’t want to agree with Bucky’s logic that he should do this, but he wanted the burden lifted from him, and he knew that would be worth a bit of pain in Bucky’s books.
“Trust in Natasha, she’s really smart, okay? She’s really tough too,” Bucky said as he looked into Tony’s eyes, smiling weakly. “If she says she can do it, she can.”
“You like that?” Tony asked, slowly moving his fingers deeper within Steve, wiggling them experimentally as he drew them out a little, only to push them back in. “How’s that, Steve? Think you can get used to this?”
“Then we’ll have do teach you,” Tony replied, putting his other hand on Bucky’s shoulder. “I promise you, I’d never hold something like that against you.”
“It was amazing, there was so much,” Steve’s laugh was a little nervous, though only because he didn’t know what they had in store for him.
“I’ll go slower. It’s getting a bit better up ahead,” Steve said, starting up again, wondering where the nearest doctor was and feeling sick himself.
“We wi-“ Steve turned his head as the computer began to ring. Letting Tony sit up to accept the car, not wanting to disturb Bucky’s head in his lap, he smiled as Dr. Marner appeared on the screen. “Hi, Laura, sorry if we interrupted your plans.”
“Do my people think so?” Tony leaned back, looking up at her with a serious look on his face. “What do my people call me? What do they think of me as a King? I doubt I’m anything like Roger the Wise, my father was practically perfect for this job.”
“That doesn’t exactly fill me with confidence,” Tony grumbled, his mind playing every single scenario where one or both of them stomped out on him. “If they leave, I marry someone of my Uncle’s choice.”
“Mom, I don’t think we need to be this close to the front…” Steve said as his mother guided him through the tightly packed crowd.
“Of course…” his chest aching more and more as Tony spoke, Stane slowly got back into the chair, placing his trembling hands on the table. Tony had really thought this through, and he was going to have to find the weaknesses in it fast. “Have you told anyone else?”
“FUCK!” Steve cried out, his hips jerking hard as he felt himself finish deep inside Bucky, his vision swimming with spots of colour as he felt the waves of his orgasm slamming against his brain, echoing through his body. When it finally began to wane, he began to go limp, panting hard as he leaned back against Tony.
“I remember him sucking on me, I don’t blame you,” Steve panted as he picked up his pace, letting out a gasp as Bucky got impossibly tight for a moment. “He loves cock, I don’t know how he lasted without me. When we were together, we were fucking twice a day most days. When we could, anyway.”
“It’s going to be okay…” Bucky whispered, holding onto Tony tightly as he petted his back like Steve did for him. “Everything’s going to be okay. You’re not alone.”
“Hm?” Tony looked up, trying to look innocent as he continued to walk over to their new couch to take a seat. He wasn’t about to keep the one that Bucky had been shot on. That was easily replaceable, that had been done immediately.
“They do watch executions, I don’t know if you can beat that,” Stane said dryly, not quite on board with paying for a virtual circus to appease his nephew.
“Steve…!” Bucky whimpered, grabbing the bed with the metal hand and Steve’s shoulder with the other, his fingers curling. “Steve, that’s so much more than fingers, that’s so much…so much better. Please don’t hold back…”
“I’m just not interested in anyone I know,” clarified Steve, hoping at least this laid some of his mother’s worries to rest. “I’m just happy to have my job, live with you, and hang out with Sam a few nights a week. I don’t want that to change right now.”
“No, nothing like that,” Natasha said quickly, looking over at Namor and mentally commanding him to stay quiet. “Bucky, I had an idea, and I don’t think you’re going to like it.”
“You going to tell me what that was about? How’d you lose weight if your calories are regulated so closely?” Steve asked, taking Bucky’s smoothie over to his nightstand before he sat down himself in his chair. “You had like four slices of pizza for supper last night.”
“I don’t know, the lights were pretty nice,” Natasha said, sitting on top of an empty barrel, the ticket in her hands as she looked over at Bucky. “I know you’re not happy about this…”
“I don’t mean to be rude, but…why?” Tony asked, leading Bucky down the corridor towards his workshop. “Is it the arm? Because that would be really stupid. You can’t catch arm loss.”
“Your mother was an exception to the rule and you know it,” Stane said darkly, protective of the memory of his sister.
“Put the card in the scanner again, as you put your thumb on the pad and look into the scanner. Then ask to go to the eighth lower level,” Ms. Carr said, watching Steve with a polite smile on her face, and Howard Stark’s voice in her ear. So far he was pleased.
“If that’s what you’d like, sire,” said Pepper as she clutched her notebook a bit tighter, hoping that was the end of Tony’s odd requests. She was worried enough about him without adding his mental health to her list. Though she was still going to go forward with her plan to spend time with him, hoping nothing else would pop up.
Pulling Bucky’s shirt away from his body, Tony held his breath as he tugged it up and over Bucky’s head, dropping it to the floor once he was free of it. Bucky’s body was better than Tony had expected, lean, strong, and flexible from hours of yoga, with a ring of scar tissue around the metal arm, as well as a vertical line on his stomach, likely from whatever surgery his father had performed on him. Reaching out, he traced his fingers over Bucky’s collarbone, his hand slipping down to touch his metal arm before moving over the scar tissue.
“I definitely want that,” Bucky said, letting out a shaky breath as he looked up to Steve. “What about you guys being with each other?”
“What else did they lie to me about you?” Steve asked, knowing he needed every detail to be perfect if he was going to plan to steal Bucky. He would be going against the resources of one of the biggest companies on the entire planet, and all he was was an artist who’d settled for a desk job.
“I don’t know why you put it on at all,” Stane said, walking over to his nephew to put a hand on the puffy material covering his shoulder. “I mean it, you don’t have to do this.”
“All of that, just…for one client? Can I only call them from here?” Steve said, questioning a lot of what Ms. Carr was saying, but not wanting to sound like he was being too critical of the job opportunity.
“I don’t know, what do you think about that, Buck?” Steve asked, raising an eyebrow as he took a drink of his beer.
“So basically you’re telling me that if you have a window, it’s a constant battle with wildlife and weather, and you might suffocate if you don’t open it enough?” Bucky chuckled as he leaned back against the wall, wrapping the blanket around him. “Are you saying that they did me a favour not putting me on the top floor?”
“And disappoint you both? No, I’m really fine with it,” Bucky insisted, relaxing at Steve’s touch, his hand going down to his stomach. “I can feel them moving a bit, I think they want me to go through with it.”
Tony, Steve, and Bucky enjoy their wedding night together.
“You can stay here as long as you want, you and Steve, my home is open to you,” Tony answered, giving him as comforting as a smile as he could manage, hoping that it worked even a little. “I’m sorry, Bucky, you will never be my property, you never should have been told you will be, but that doesn’t mean you’re not important to me. If you want to leave here, I will make sure you have everything you’ll ever need, but this can be home for as long as you wan-.”
“…we should guess, I mean, there’s really only three combinations, winner doesn’t have to make dinner tonight?” Tony suggested, looking over at his phone to see if the doctor had messaged back before turning his attention back to Steve and Bucky.
“Steve, I love you,” Bucky said as he pulled away from his fiancé, just wanting him to go, resigned to his fate. “I’ve forgiven you, I can go now.”
After arriving in Dawson City, the men get to their new home and get settled.
“I did the best job I could for you, Tony, please…” Stane begged, walking closer to Tony, bowing down to him. He wanted to go to that cold, dreary place as much as he wanted to eat a bowl of glass. “I’m sorry, I was wrong. I promise you, I can do better if you give me the chance. I can be a better Uncle to you.”
As Howard turned his gun toward Steve, and the needle came for his stomach, Bucky panicked, kicking out and landing one foot square in the doctor’s chest. Turning his body as much as he could in the large man’s grasp, Bucky’s metal arm reached up to grab Howard Stark and jerk him backwards. Their eyes met in the moment that Stark almost lost his footing, not breaking apart as Howard’s hand spun back around, the gun aimed right at Bucky when it went off.
“Don’t worry, we have a few minutes,” Steve said, looking at Bucky’s pants before reaching out to take the sticker off the leg. “Feel like having a relaxed day?”
“I’m sure, Tony,” Pepper frowned, really not wanting to do this to her boss hours after losing his fiancés. “And he is right about that, we don’t have much money set away. We’ve taken out a loan from Wakanda in the last year.”
“I’ll see what I can do,” Tony shook his head as he turned to leave, knowing he still had a few more visits to make to get everyone on the same page. Pepper was going to love him for it. “I’ll be in touch.”
“See? You made a good choice,” Natasha said as she helped herself to more grapes, biting a particularly round one in half.
“That’s not fun any more,” Peter said, hanging off the jungle gym by his knees.
“We can talk about that later, I don’t think you want to think about that right now,” Steve said as Tony pulled up in front of the small hospital, already seeing the car they’d rented for Dr. Marner. “Bucky, remember that red, yellow, and green light system we tried before? You have to let us know where you are now so we can try to help you. How are you feeling right now?”
“You’re welcome,” Tony said as he lead Bucky up to a door at the end of the hall, slipping his key into the lock and turning it. Opening the heavy door, he picked up a lantern hanging up on the wall, and turned to look at Bucky. “Are you sure you want to go in there? I’m going to bore you.”
“You…you make me happy too…” Bucky panted as he draped his legs over Tony’s shoulders, reaching out to Steve and taking his hand to squeeze. He thought he’d been pushed to the limit by Steve, but every move Tony made inside him made him want to go further. “Can we do this a lot? Both of you?
“…yeah, then we’ll do that,” Bucky rubbed his forehead for a moment before getting to his feet. “I’m going to tell one of the guards to just go get Tony and Steve, I’m not going to say why. Maybe we can just keep this between us.”
“If it isn’t the man on the wall,” Tony said as he stepped into the light from the torches, smirking a bit as every soldier but Fury dropped into a bow. “At ease, I’m not here for an inspection or something. Go back to work.”
“If you’re so determined…” Stane sighed, wondering if there was something stronger he could have. The wine wasn’t cutting it. “I will speak with Pepper and we’ll start the process to find your intended today.”
“It was beautiful, we can’t thank you enough,” Sarah gushed, standing next to her son and giving him a nudge to stand up straighter. “Please tell the King we’re very thankful for his hospitality.”
“Holy sh-…I mean, this is nice,” Bucky mentally kicked himself for almost swearing, and started blushing outright as Tony burst out laughing.
“That’s your profession, what do you like to do?” Tony asked, raising his eyebrows as he leaned closer to the younger man. “We’re not here to judge you or anything, I’m just seeing how I can help you.”
“Yeah,” Bucky added, looking down at the clenched fist at his side, specifically his twitching thumb. He didn’t know how much more of this drinking and procrastinating he could take.
“What about Frank Castle?” suggested Stane, feeling a bit optimistic at leaving their future in that man’s hands. He was supposed to be both brutal and effective, and Stane appreciated both.
“I just meant that we don’t have passports,” Steve said flatly, though he wasn’t going to hold that against Tony at all. If he punished Tony every time he was sarcastic, they’d probably never speak again.
“Please don’t go, please don’t…” Bucky begged, slowly letting go of himself to cling to Steve, burying his face against the man’s shoulder, his tears soaking through the thin material of Steve’s blue t-shirt.
“He didn’t randomly pick her,” Stane pointed out, pacing back and forth behind the chair he’d been sitting in. “You could be putting us in danger!”
“No, I’d save you both, that’s why Tony’s here with us too. One of us would take you, one of us would take the baby,” Steve said, shaking his head, not wanting to think about this taking Bucky’s life from him. It had occurred to him in the past, and he’d pushed his thoughts from his head then too. As far as he was concerned, Bucky would never die.
He couldn’t think of a better way to describe Bucky, he felt like he could breathe again after drowning for years. Even with the threat of being murdered hanging over him, he wouldn’t change taking his job, he wanted to be near Bucky, even if just as his friend.
“So does this mean you two can live together now? You’re not going to kill each other or anything, are you?” Tony questioned, not wanting the headache of brawls happening in the castle because these two had a past.
“I haven’t heard word of a tax increase, but you’re right, it’s possible,” Sarah mused, worried that they wouldn’t be able to handle another one. Things had been tight enough since her husband died, and even Steve’s wages didn’t cover enough. She had to hope that it wasn’t the case, she didn’t want to think of them ending up on the streets.
“To be fair, I didn’t think to,” said Tony as his face fell, looking sadly downwards at the floor. “I was so busy thinking about me just marrying them that I didn’t think to invite the whole world. Did someone invite you?”
“All my life I was told I was made to make you happy, and I hated you for it. I thought I was just here for you to have babies with, and that I’d spend the rest of my life in a cell unless you needed me,” Bucky said, moving closer to Tony, still holding his hand. “But now I know you’re not a bad man, and you’re just as caught up with your father’s wishes to control your life. I’ve never remembered having parents, I don’t know what that kind of love is like, but I’m pretty sure it’s big. So if you’re guilty that you still love him even though he’s done this, I’m not angry. I get that he’s still your dad…”
“So you want me to fuck you? Do you miss me playing with you like this?” Steve asked, his other hand moving to get more of the grease to stroke his own cock as he stretched and wiggled his fingers to keep him ready for it. “Fuck, Bucky, you feel so much tighter than I remember.”
“Let me guess, the others picked blue,” Bucky said, trying not to move much as more hair rained down on his shoulder.
“Thank you,” Tony said, his shoulders relaxing now that he knew Stane was on his side. “Let me know how it goes.”
“Duly noted,” Steve said with a nod, following Bucky who had walked into his bedroom, hoping that they could have at least some privacy. Stepping into Bucky’s room, he watched as his former friend took a seat on the edge of the bed, purposely avoiding eye contact. “…James.”
“Don’t you dare apologize for that, don’t!” Steve said, watching as Tony tensed up even more in the driver seat, keeping his arm around Bucky as he tried not to let the stress of the situation get to him even more. “We are not angry at you, and we’re not going to be upset with whatever you choose. There is nothing for you to feel sorry for, so get that thought out of your head. Tony’s right, let’s deal with this when we’ve all calmed down, okay? Oh thank god, is that the airport?”
“Tony, Bucky’s pregnant,” Steve blurted out, not meaning to be so blunt, but Tony wasn’t going to listen to him any other way. “He did an ultrasound on himself, and we saw this bubble inside him, and it looks like the pictures online. He says he’s been feeling sick, and he really has been tired lately-“
“It’s the first one you showed me,” Steve let out the breath he’d been holding in, delighted with the reaction from both Tony and Bucky, who hadn’t stopped staring at it since he uncovered it. “I wanted to include little things about us in there. Like how Bucky and I first kissed under a pear tree.”
“It might even be fun, you could enjoy yourself,” Namor added with a half smirk as Bucky turned to glare at him. “It’s possible.”
“I would like that,” Bucky nodded, pleased with himself, and actually curious about this workshop Tony disappeared into. “I mean, maybe I can help you. Somehow.”
“I bought one just for this occasion,” Tony said as he got up to head to the kitchen, opening the hall closet and taking a red bucket out.
“I will only darken your doorstep for as long as I’m welcome,” Von Doom said politely, turning around and nodding back at some of his servants. As they emerged from the shadows with a medium sized chest, Von Doom waited for them to set it down before he opened it. Inside were bars of a silvery metal, each stamped with the Von Doom family crest. “For you, King Anthony, the best Latveria has to offer.”
“So…retirement guy, he didn’t…?” Steve asked, not wanting to sound suspicious, but if the old man died here, he didn’t think he was going to like that much.
“So what do you do for your spare time?” Bucky decided he’d jump in and start the conversation between the three of them. Hopefully Steve wouldn’t have too much to add to it.
“I wrote you a song,” Bucky blurted, immediately wincing a bit as he thought about what he’d just said. At least a painting could hang on a wall forever, he wasn’t sure what a song could do for them. “It’s nothing much.”
“I kind of thought you would say that,” Tony grumbled petulantly, wishing he could have more alcohol, though he knew that would probably only end up with him falling off the stage.
“I’ll get him,” Tony said, getting out and going straight to Bucky’s side, throwing the blanket back into the SUV, and kneeling at his boyfriend’s side. “We don’t have much farther to go, baby, and we can put you in the front seat. I didn’t think about you being travel sick, I would have brought something for your stomach.”
It took a moment for Bucky to take in a ragged breath, coughing a little before he went back to breathing properly, feeling light headed and dizzy in the meantime. “I don’t feel well…” he said weakly, leaning against Steve and closing his eyes.
“I’m okay with it, just a bit nervous,” Steve’s hips slowed, though they didn’t stop, his heart skipping a beat in his chest as he watched Tony scoop some of the white stuff on his fingers. “Bucky says it doesn’t hurt, and for how much he loves it, I’m going to believe him.”
“That’s never one hundred percent, they might discover something about themselves down the road,” Tony said softly, looking out the window before giving his head a little shake and looking at Bucky. “Not that I’m trying to ruin the excitement, I’m just…it’s fine. I think it’s a good idea.”
“Th-thanks,” Bucky pursed his lips, feeling a lump in his throat that he took a deep breath in through his nostrils. He wanted to sound more genuine, more passionate, like he truly meant that thanks from the bottom of his heart. Most of all, he wished his voice hadn’t cracked.
“It is what I’d like, thanks,” Tony brought his eyes up to meet hers. “I didn’t get to spend enough time with them. I feel like there was so much more I could have learned. I’d never seen a finished painting from Steve, or heard Bucky sing, and I can’t order them back to life, or buy them back. I’ve never felt so weak and lost.”
“So, Steven and…Bucky’s fine, right?” Tony looked at Bucky for a second, waiting for him to nod to continue. “Would either of you like a drink of anything? I’m sure you’re in shock, I can give you something stronger than you’d probably be used to.”
“I couldn’t make him budge, especially once they were really dead,” Stane shot back, just as annoyed by the situation as Von Doom was. He thought today was going to be the last day he needed to worry about his plan. But Tony had asked him for one more week to mourn, and he couldn’t think of a good enough reason to deny him. There was still time until his birthday, after all.
“Sire, there are dangerous people out there, they can’t be allowed to come here,” Pepper insisted, letting out a long breath as she brought her hand up to her brow. “I haven’t even begun to ask you what criteria you want for a spouse.”
“I don’t…!” Stane flexed his fingers on the sides of the ring, fighting every urge to throw it across the room. “I don’t know, I just found this out. You have to be patient with me.”
“When did you get those?” Steve asked with a gasp, sitting up a bit to get a better look at them.
“Seriously?” Steve’s jaw dropped, absolutely shocked that the polite, gentle man he’d had a few conversations with would do all of that. Though he supposed the best place to hide if you were committing acts like that might be right in the open.
“I had a family once, but they died in a car accident, my father, my mother, my sister…” Bucky began, dropping the cards to wrap his arms around himself again, his breathing shaky and uneven. “My arm was ripped off, I was dying, and Stark Industries heard about me somehow. They faked my death at the hospital, and then they brought me here and saved my life. They build an arm for me, but they did medical tests on me, but it wasn’t just me, there were others. I’m the only one the tests worked on, though, so they kept me here. I don’t know what happened to the others…I-O don't know if that's enough for eight...”
“James, please take Steven’s ring and place it on his finger, pledging your life to him,” the priest’s hand extended forward as Bucky took the ring from his palm.
“Seriously…a boy and a girl…” Bucky said, hugging his stomach, looking like he was in shock. They suddenly felt so much more real to him, and the fact that they were only a couple months away made him terrified as well as elated. “We need to come up with names, so…everyone start thinking about that.”
“I’m going to agree that it’s good Steve is here,” Tony leaned in to give Bucky a soft kiss against the raised scar, nuzzling the spot afterwards. “But your sacrifice should be honoured. Thank you, Bucky, for making sure both of you made it here to me.”
“I…I have no idea…” Steve said, though he couldn’t help thinking he wished he could paint Bucky the way he remembered him. Smiling, laughing, the Bucky he’d loved. But it might be awkward if the first thing he did was a portrait of his rival. “I don’t know much about painting, I should probably start with something easy.”
“You don’t have to apologize,” said Steve as he cleared away their clothing, hanging it up as best he could before putting on some more casual wear. “And we can, just have a whiskey, maybe something sweet to eat. I’d like to just have some time with you.”
“Just...just hold me, okay?” Bucky said softly, scared and feeling utterly helpless as he buried his face against Steve’s neck. Closing his eyes, he wanted to shut out everything in this world except for the two men he loved with all his heart.
“I don’t think being good with electronics is going to help me here, but if you want me to…” Tony said, about to pick up the probe and start trying it out when the laptop began to ring. Hitting a key, the doctor appeared on the screen, her white hair glowing in the sunlight from her window, her usual smile on her face. Tony had chosen her because she’d worked around the world delivering babies, and her track record was spectacular. That and she was retired, which made her less obvious if his father was sniffing around.
“I don’t know…I feel like I’m…” Bucky closed his eyes, rubbing them with his free hand, and breathing slowly. “I’m fine…I’m being stupid, sorry.”
“I’d figure out something,” Steve nodded, trying to keep emotion from seeping into his facial expression. He didn’t want Bucky to know he had any reason to hesitate in his decision.
“Okay, I’m-woah!” Tony laughed nervously when he stepped in the room, jumping back as their kiss broke. “I can go, I’ll just-“
“Hey parents, look what I can do!”
“If something happens down the road, we’ll support them and love them and let them be who they want,” Steve said in a reassuring tone, petting Bucky’s hair as he watched Tony, concerned about how he’d been acting in the two weeks since they’d returned to their home.
Tony sat at one of his work benches, his large mug full of coffee sitting untouched beside him as he held a long piece of rigid wire in his hand, flipping it over in his fingers. He’d woken up early, just after Steve had left to go for a run, and he stayed in bed watching Bucky for almost an hour before he got up. He felt like he should be working on going through his father’s files again for anything on Bucky, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. He was mentally exhausted, and on top of that he was entering a relationship with two other people, one of them being more complicated than anyone else he’d ever been with. He really liked Bucky, but how could he possibly know that Bucky really liked him? And would he lose Steve too if he pushed Bucky away? Could he live with that choice?
“Afa mijia, fostja famer,” Stane murmured under his breath as the ring lit up, white light burning his eyes as he stared into the middle, waiting. As mist began to leak from the cracks and pool in the center, Stane didn’t react as another face appeared in the white smoke. It was a man with brown hair and eyes, and he didn’t look happy.
“No, to be honest, but I had inside information about avoiding security, I knew when the patrols were, where they were, all that,” Clint frowned, reaching into a pocket to take out a slip of paper with some odd writing on it. “This is my own code, but those are the times the guards would walk over to this area of the castle as well as for Steve’s window.”
“I’m fine, just…getting settled with this new position is more stressful than I thought it would be,” Steve said, letting her take his temperature as he turned the blender on, guilt mixing in as she pressed her hand against him. She was always the most loving wife, and it wasn’t that he didn’t love her, he just didn’t know how well they fit together any more. He didn’t want to upset her, though.
“There are lots of them to look at,” Steve said, starting the car and looking at Tony with concern in his eyes before he pulled out of the spot and started on their route to the house. He was more used to city driving, but he was looking forward to long empty roads that hopefully didn’t have very many moose on them. “This is the first time I’ve been to Canada, this place is gorgeous.”
“Thank you…” Bucky whimpered as he slowly began to collect himself, reaching out to touch the arm, running his fingers down it. “Thank you so much, it’s beautiful, I love it so much.”
“Can you stay? Please? We were going to meet you here, I thought we could surprise you,” Bucky said frantically, not wanting Steve to leave, really wanting his first time to be with them both.
“…I’m sorry too…” Bucky said, his voice small and sad as he gave Tony’s hand a gentle squeeze. “I’m sorry you’re losing your father over this.”
“And once we get that chip out of you, Bucky, we can go anywhere you want in the whole world. I promise you that I’m going to take you to see it all,” Tony said, drying his eyes on his sleeve, chuckling a little. “You’d think for billionaires, we’d have more tissue boxes lying around. I’m going to get right on that.”
“You can tell him yourself later,” Pepper walked up to Steve, looking him over, lightly touching his chin to move his head from side to side. “Jarvis, I’m thinking a short style for him. He was a soldier, he would suit to look like one.”
“I have,” Tony exhaled, taking another drink before turning around and just grabbing the entire whiskey bottle for himself.
“The goats, mostly. Only the goats,” Bucky corrected himself, hoping that the burning in his cheeks was from the alcohol and not him turning a shade of red to match Tony’s chair. “I don’t think anyone else wants to listen to that.”
“That sounds like more than a hobby, that sounds like a calling,” Steve’s eyes moved up to what Tony was looking at, smiling a little at the painting.
“I love you both too,” Bucky said, trying to keep his eyes open as long as he could before he lost his battle and fell back into a deep sleep, aided by the painkillers coursing through his system. He looked like an angel as he slept, his dark eyelashes fanning out above his pale cheeks.
“Oh we can handle it,” Fury said, his hands on his hips. “But it doesn’t mean we’ll enjoy ourselves.”
“He looks…pretty normal,” Steve said, realizing the boy was nothing at all like he’d pictured. He’d been imagining a medical experiment gone wrong or something, but Bucky seemed to be like any other teenager he saw around. He noticed that Bucky had a metal glove on, though, he wondered if he’d been too quick to judge Bucky as average, he hadn’t taken to account how many afflictions were invisible. “I mean…I’m sure he is special, it’s just not as obvious as I’d imagined.”
“I…oh wow…” Taking a deep breath, Steve looked at the job description again, skimming it over. He didn’t know if he could say no, though, he wanted to separate from Peggy, and this would allow him to do that. This would allow him to do lots of things, maybe he could actually afford a bigger place, he could have an art studio. And if he didn’t do this job, someone else would, maybe not as well as he could do it, and he’d be back at his own desk.
“It was never our intention to sneak him away,” Howard lied, though his smooth voice made the statement sound as innocent as it possibly could. “We’re just moving his things right now, we thought he’d be more comfortable with them there.
As one relationship changes in Steve's life, another strengthens.
“I won’t go out again. I’m sorry I went out this morning, but it had to be done,” Steve rubbed Bucky’s back, scowling as two of Howard’s workers came back into the room to keep packing. Pulling Bucky closer, he whispered into his ear under the guise of a hug, hoping that no one suspected anything. “Trust me.”
“…I never loved someone before you, and now I feel like I have all the love in the world, so thank YOU,” Bucky said, moving his hand so it was against Steve’s chest, running his fingers over it, feeling the tension of carrying him in his husband’s muscles. “I love you so much, Steve…”
Steve didn’t hesitate, scooping up Bucky in his arms and going after Tony, well aware that something was obviously seriously wrong. His own nerves were on edge, he couldn’t imagine what was going through Bucky’s head at the moment. He had to hope that this wasn’t going to push Bucky’s anxiety into overdrive.
“Tony…Tony!” Steve said loudly, trying to break his husband’s concentration off the floor and onto something, anything else.
“Then don’t hesitate.”
“We’ll manage,” Steve said as he followed Tony into the house, immediately impressed with his surroundings when he stepped inside. Everything was relatively modern and clean, much different from the rustic cabin that Steve had pictured, and partially been dreading as he was the only one that could cook. “Wow, this place is nice.”
Sitting inside a small, driverless, blue vehicle that he’d mentally nicknamed the Stark Cart, Steve moved through the Stark compound, his messenger bag on the empty seat. Jennifer from HR had just told him that someone had wanted to talk to him, and he was to report to another human resources employee at the end of this ride. He wasn’t sure what this was about, as as much as he told himself to stop freaking out and enjoy the ride, it wasn’t quite working.
“How are you, Buck?” Steve asked, his heart swelling with love every second he watched Bucky and their children, seeing a look on Bucky’s face that he could only describe as pure contentment.
“Where could we hide them, though? And what about bodies?” Tony didn’t see how this was going to work, everything was just getting more and more complicated in his head.
“Go get us each a new shirt, I’ll clean him up,” Tony said, slowly getting up and pulling Bucky with him, making sure to grab the pieces of wood Bucky had dug out of the floor as Steve disappeared up the stairs “Do you want to throw these in the wood stove, Buck? Then I can clean you up and have you ready for Dr. Marner’s phone call.”
“Okay…uhm…I can bring healthier treats if you want, less time on the bike,” Steve offered, wondering now how many cupcakes Bucky should have, though he wasn’t about to deny him one. He just hoped it didn’t mean Bucky would have to be on the bike all afternoon.
“I’ve been thinking the same thing myself,” Steve looked over at Tony, extending his other hand out above Bucky.
“The best ones out there,” Tony said, lacing his fingers together with Bucky’s, kissing his forehead before leaning over to press one to Steve’s cheek as well. “I’m with Steve, I love you four with everything in me.”
“No, not yet,” Steve reached over as Sarah leaned out to pass it over, taking the slip of paper and examining it in the light of the fire.
“Number one hundred thirty. One three zero,” Tony said as he showed the number to Stane, who nodded to confirm it. “Step forward, one hundred thirty, and show us your ticket.”
“Okay, so…what exactly is the problem? You don’t like them?” Rhodey realized he hadn’t discussed them with Tony since they came to the castle a fortnight ago. He’d figured Tony would be able to pick one in that amount of time, though, he didn’t usually seem very selective when choosing lovers.
Both Tony and Steve frowned at that, their hearts breaking at the thought of Bucky fearing abandonment after he’d had the baby for them. It had been so programmed into Bucky’s heads that he didn’t have a role past incubating the babies that he still feared it despite being told every day how much they loved him. He was going to have to be convinced that he was their top priority now and forever, and that adding to their family wasn’t going to change that.
Bucky just nodded, taking the bits off Tony and walking over to throw them in the fire unceremoniously. He felt like the emotional outburst had drained him along with the pain, and he just wanted to close his eyes and forget about the rest of the day. He didn’t want to disappoint the others, though, so he still felt obligated to having an ultrasound and finding out what they were having. They couldn’t just call them Luke and Leia.
“I don’t want you to hate me!” Bucky yelled back at him, chipping harder at the wound in the floorboard, frantically, leaning over even more to look for any hint of red.
“So what do you propose we do?” Stane cleared his throat, trying to keep his tone as neutral as possible. In his head, he was throttling Tony, and not for the first time.
“I would have never, ever done that to you,” Tony said, still stroking Bucky’s hair, his thumb moving down to catch some of the tears from his eyes. He knew that Bucky trusted and loved him, but he could still understand that lifelong fear residing in the darkest spots of Bucky’s mind still. “They need their Pops as much as they need their Papa and their Daddy.”
“I don’t see how I can’t be at this point,” Tony said, reaching down to grasp the bottom of Bucky’s shirt, rubbing the thin material between his thumb and finger, eyes still locked on Bucky’s. “I like you for you, not just because you’re gorgeous.”
“You can find a better way, Steve, you can…what are you looking at?” Sarah asked, following Steve’s eyes over to the pub, spotting Sam. She hadn’t wanted to push things, but she was beginning to think there was a bit of a spark there. After years alone, she’d hoped Steve had found someone new to fill that hole in his heart.
“It does,” Bucky whispered, smiling more as tears pricked the corners of his eyes. “It really does.”
“Steve…?”
“Joy,” Pepper said dryly, not looking up from the papers before her. “I appreciate it, Sire, I’m just very unsure of how I’m going to organize this so fast.”
“Then let’s do this,” Tony laughed, turning to the priest and giving him a grin. “We’re ready, please give us the blessing of the gods.”
“Well, shows you how much you know about me then,” Bucky retorted sharply, being as polite with Steve as he could manage to be, as he took his drink back from Tony. He may have a truce with Steve at the moment, but that didn’t mean they were friends, or that they ever would be again. He could be civil, but that was it, Steve wasn’t getting any more than that from him.
“Nothing. A bucket actually,” Bucky said, not sure about how his stomach was going to take the tea and crackers. “Definitely a bucket, I feel like someone’s beaten me up inside and all my organs are protesting.”
“So how do you want to do this? I can move out, you can keep all the furniture and that, I can be out whenever you want me to be,” Steve said, feeling a little winded as his marriage came to an end, even if it had been on life support for a while now. “I want you to keep your ring though, okay? You don’t have to give it back, I bought that for you. If you sell it or something, that’s fine too. It’s yours.”
“I do,” Bucky nodded, not hesitating in the least.
“I have no idea, but his father married a commoner, so it may be a family thing,” Sarah looked out the window at a couple hurrying past as the rain fell harder. “Though he met her out hunting when she was looking for mushrooms, that’s a much more conventional way to meet than the lottery.”
Steve gets closer with Bucky and comes to a realization about himself.
“I’ll meet him one day, Steve, and I’ll tell him how much you love him, right in front of you too so you get embarrassed,” Sam said, reaching over to the table beside them to steal one of the napkins, setting it down by Steve’s utensils. He knew he should probably think about this more, but he knew a good gut feeling when he had one, and he knew deep in his heart that Steve would do the same for him. “As of now, you two aren’t alone in this. If you need someone to help break him out and fly you two to safety, I will.”
“Until next week,” Stane muttered under his breath, outraged by what a farce this all was. Tony didn’t know what love was, he was as selfish and self centered as his Uncle, though he chose his own interests rather than money. He was going to be as clueless as to what was going on in his own kingdom after he married Von Doom as he’d ever been. Stane was willing to bet on it.
“We’ll talk names later, we have to celebrate,” Tony said, turning to the computer. “Dr. Marner, thank you so much for your help. When you arrive, let me know what time you’re coming in. I’ll make sure one of us is there to help you with your bags.”
“Bucky, we’ve been over this before,” Howard began with a tired sigh, which only made Bucky sob harder. “You’ll have anything you want, everything in the world, and you only need to be pregnant for nine months at a time.”
“Believe me, he is,” Ms. Carr said, gesturing down to the control panel on the desk. “Everything is labelled clearly, that’s the button to lock the door if you’ve gone in and out, the switches to dim the lights are here. For any medical issues with Bucky, you press the blue button to summon his nurse, and you’ll also be seeing her twice a day, one in the morning and once in the evening, so she can check Bucky’s vitals. Now, you’ll notice inside of his room there are red buttons, those are panic buttons. They neutralize him immediately and other red star clearance personnel will be notified to come to your aid.”
Tony couldn’t even hear what Steve was saying on the phone, it all sounded like static in his ears as he reached down to touch Bucky’s cheek, the gun in his hand falling to the floor as he pushed the doctor aside and reached to hold the shirt against Bucky’s wound. He couldn’t help the tears that rose in his eyes as he felt how saturated the material already was. He couldn’t lose him, he couldn’t lose them, he didn’t think he could go on with that void in his life.
“You’re not supposed to think,” Tony growled playfully as he began to thrust into Steve, wrapping his arms around him to run up and down his muscular frame. “You’re just supposed to feel.”
“I’m…” pursing his lips, Bucky wasn’t sure if he should put up more walls or tear some down. Tony was staring at him though, he had to say something or he was going to look either boring or stupid. “I like to sing.”
“You didn’t mean to hurt him,” watching Steve, Sarah stirred her stew slowly to lower the temperature. “You loved him.”
“Even if they came from a medical experiment?” Bucky whispered, turning his head to look Steve in the eye. “Even if they give me to Tony and I really like him, why would he want to be with a mess like me? That’s why I worry about ending up in a prison again, Tony and his normal boyfriend raising our kids. I couldn’t blame him.”
“It doesn’t matter if we know if they’re alive or dead, they’re too young to survive outside Bucky so if he dies, they’re dead too. I don’t need to hear it!” Tony snapped, petting Bucky’s hair back from his forehead, his eyes blurred with tears. “Nothing fucking matters if he dies!”
“Okay, but stop me if you’re too sensitive, or if it hurts,” Tony said as he poured some lube into his hand, liberally coating his dick with it as he looked at Bucky, watching his face carefully for even a twinge of pain as he pushed inside Bucky’s still stretched ass. “That’s so fucking good, baby, you’re still so tight for me.”
“Are you okay, Tony?” Steve asked, watching him wince in pain.
“I do remember you, we had that conversation about Wakanda’s vibranium mines, you were most knowledgeable,” Von Doom lifted the whiskey to his lips to take a sip, feeling it burn all the way down his chest. “How is trade with Wakanda nowadays?”
“…you never said anything about Bucky being a guy, that didn’t shock you?” Steve asked, his laugh a little more genuine.
“We’ll talk about it later,” Tony replied, leaning back in the throne as he gave a nod to Pepper, who disappeared into the neighbouring room. “This should be interesting, I can’t believe they got here so fast from Latveria.
“We’ll love whatever we get, won’t we?” Tony said, bringing his hand over to touch Bucky’s very round stomach, watching as the twins moved under his skin, a sight that he didn’t think he’d ever get used to both for the awe of watching his children and the fact that Alien had been one of his favourite movies as a kid.
“I’m going to get better with people, I’m going to be able to travel and that soon,” Bucky said with determination, looking into Tony’s eyes for a moment before his gaze turned to the scenery again. “If this is a small town, I should be able to go out here.”
“We need to settle this,” Stane said instead, looking over at Pepper in the corner who looked completely confused. “And not in front of the general public.”
“Would you walk away from this contest for me?” Bucky queried, looking right up at him, making eye contact. “Would you walk away from marrying Tony if it meant my forgiveness? Would you sacrifice that for me?”
“You’re right, you’re both right,” Tony breathed out, letting out a short peal of manic laughter. “Okay, you’re both…you’re going to love this. You’re going to laugh and laugh and laugh-”
“Are we going inside? What if we’re seen?” Bucky asked as the cart pulled up in front of the stables and Nick Fury got to his feet to get out.
“Get it up, you’re doing great, baby,” Steve cooed, helping him hold the bucket, still rubbing his back. “It’s not much longer, you can do this, you’re stronger than anyone I’ve ever met.”
“Please don’t make me go, please don’t…” Bucky pleaded, choked with tears, feeling like he was going to be sick as he clung to Steve’s hand. “I don’t want to do this, I don’t want to…I can’t do this…I can’t, please don’t make me…”
Steve and Tony smiled, putting down their drinks and reaching out to take both of Bucky’s hands, squeezing them.
“You’re not going to be, I promise you won’t be broken up,” Tony reassured him, laughing again, though there was some lightness to it. Wiping his eyes, he looked at Steve, feeling desperate at that moment to be a part of their embrace. “M-May I?”
“I wouldn’t joke about that, si-I mean, Tony.”
“Happy,” Bucky answered back, his eyes not leaving his babies. “Green.”
“Oh, I will,” Stane watched Tony leave, waiting a few seconds before his face relaxed, leaving him looking as stern as ever. Gripping his cup, he gritted his teeth, allowing himself a moment before he began to start planning all over again. This wasn’t the complete disaster he’d been dreading. This was just another beginning that he hadn’t thought of, but the end result was going to be exactly the same.
“You people are easy to please, of course we can do that,” said Tony, grinning wider as he thought about getting to spend time with both of them. This was better than his original plan, this way he was going to get a bit of a choice from the pair that fate brought them. “Pepper, how long until you can get them each a few rooms?”
“Hopefully what doesn’t take long?” Tony came in, still dressed in the clothes he was wearing earlier, looking worried. “Bucky, are you alright? Did y-why is there an armed man in here?”
“Baby…” Tony smiled as Steve held Bucky’s hand for him to slip the ring on, pulling him into a hug as Steve gave him one from behind, keeping the three of them tightly together. “You’re ours, we’re yours, you had a long road to get here but…now you’re home.”
“I know they would have, they love potholes,” Tony said, walking back over to the lounge chairs, sitting back in his own. “We’ll take them for a drive one day after Benjamin comes, find a shitty road, make an afternoon of it. There’s tons of them around here. Maybe you shouldn’t come with your car sickness though, baby.”
“That’s understandable,” Steve nodded again, not really wanting to check out the weapons or wizard anyway. “This is all kind of intimidating. Not you, you’ve been very gracious, but just being here.”
“Oh, thanks,” Steve said, figuring he was going to have to haul one of them in from the other room. Bringing it closer to Bucky, he sat the chair down backwards, and took a seat with his arms crossed on the back, giving the boy a weak smile when they made eye contact. “…Look, I know this can’t be easy, you don’t even know me…”
“I thought you needed the sleep,” Bucky slowly began to relax as his contraction eased off a bit. He still felt like he was going to throw up, though, he felt more nauseous now than on the airplane. “They’re only eight minutes apart, so it’s not a big deal yet. I don’t feel well, though, I feel really sick.”
“Your Hi-I mean, Tony…” Bucky bowed a little, fighting his awkwardness as he stood up straight again. “I’m glad you’re here. I mean, it’s nice to spend some time alone with you, an-what is that box?”
“Coffee,” Natasha and Bucky said together quickly, which only made Pepper burst out laughing.
“Oh?” Stane rose his eyebrows, trying to ignore the happy little voice in his head  cheering on his possible victory.
“I’m thinking a fire display, what can you do in the lines of that?” Putting weight on his crushed foot, Tony made a face, leaning against the wall.
“What? No,” Tony shook his head, laughing again as he tried to think of something interesting to tell these men about himself, besides the king thing, obviously. “No, they won’t be punished, but I might have Pepper pick a more suitable position for them than anything to do with writing. I wouldn’t dream of punishing someone for a mistake like that.”
“Good…I’m in my pyjamas…” Bucky said, as if that were the main reason he didn’t want people to see him. He was slowly getting used to new people, the staff around the mansion had been very nice and patient with him, but the thought of a crowd was too much right now.
“I think it’s odd how little we know about life here, yet they’ve dressed us up and stuck us here with pretty much no instruction,” Bucky frowned, going over to the chair next to Natasha’s to take a seat himself. “I’m starting to wonder if we’re not here for some weird game for all the rich people’s amusement. Ohh look at the poor people, they don’t know how to eat, let’s laugh at them.”
“Happy anniversary,” Tony grinned.
“And now, the moment you’ve been waiting for…” Tony announced, looking over at Stane with a smile, his heart pounding in his chest. “The family that will be joining me in the castle is…”
“Wait, not so fast, we need to get Steve and Bucky out of here first,” Tony frowned, standing up straight and walking over to the two sitting on the bed. Kneeling in front of them, he reached his hands up to take their hands. “I’m not going to let anything happen to either of you. No one outside of this room is going to know you’re alive. Sorry Steve, that includes your Mom.”
“I can go with you, I’m able to walk,” Von Doom turned to look back at Tony and Stane, giving them a nod. “I shall see you both at supper. Thank you very much for your hospitality.”
“You mean we’re going to help others, but in the meantime, we get to live like this as well,” Bucky said with a chuckle, glad that they could both have full bellies because of his luck. He still didn’t think it was worth their time to pretend he was going to win though, but he wasn’t going to ruin Natasha’s fun.
“Natasha’s pretty happy here, I think, I am too,” Bucky winced again, hating everything he had to say. Tony spoke so eloquently, with such a warm and inviting voice, and he basically mumbled most of the time. “I’d like to see more of you, I mean, I want to get to know you too.” Nice, much better.
“I’m naturally curious,” Bucky sat crosslegged now, his hand resting on top of his right knee. “Now tell me the truth, and then I’ll tell you the truth about something you choose.”
“Just when we’re out,” Tony said, stiffening a bit in his seat as Steve turned onto a dead end road, immediately thankful that he bought a vehicle with four wheel drive and glad that Steve had noticed that feature. “This is not a road, why is this considered a road?”
“When do we leave?” Steve asked as he got out of the car, realizing Bucky was barefoot, and scooping him back up into his arms as Tony opened the lift gate to get their luggage, throwing the coats over his arm.
“So?” Von Doom asked, raising an eyebrow.
“Is that what you call it?” Bucky asked flatly.
“No, no I didn’t,” Rhodey shook his head, really wondering what had got into his friend. “Was I supposed to watch for him? I was just told to come here after lunch to meet you.”
“That’s impossible, this ticket says one hundred thirty!” the other guard looked at the ticket, frowning at it before holding it out as well. “There seems to be a mix up, sire.”
“Tony Masters? Benjamin Poindexter? Daken Akihiro?” Stane listed, trying to think of every assassin he’d heard of, knowing that Von Doom would know the status of each one.
“I can’t say I blame you,” Ms. Carr said, not reacting to the voice in her ear signalling delight at Steve as a candidate. “You’re exactly what we’re looking for, Mr. Rogers, the position is yours if you want to take it. I would tell you to take some time to think it over, but time isn’t something we have much of. Bucky has already been alone for a while.”
“I…oh, wow,” Bucky’s cheeks began to burn as he felt his blood quickly moving south. “I think I’d like that a lot, I hope…I hope you’re happy with me.”
“Are you kidding me? I’m counting down the days,” Stane laughed as he leaned back in his chair, crossing his legs on top of his desk as he stared into the clear image of Von Doom before him. “He’s been a pain in my ass since I killed my sister and brother in law, but I can’t exactly just chop his head off. I’ve had to bide my time, do this carefully.”
“I am-I am NOTHING like him,” Tony insisted, still keeping his voice low. “I will figure out a way to make this right, as right as I can, and I’m starting with calling the police and getting my father out of this house.” He looked at Steve again before walking over to Bucky, his heart aching at the tears running down Bucky’s face as he stared forward, looking like he was in a state of shock. “Bucky, anything you want, anything at all, you can ask me for it and I’ll do anything to make it happen.”
“Obviously…what exactly happened, can you go over that for me?” Tony queried, rubbing his temples with his thumb and index finger.
“Years? How long has he been here?” Steve’s eyebrows shot up, looking around the room Bucky was kept in, trying to picture growing up in there. This all seemed much more horrific than he was let on, he was starting to feel like he’d made a big mistake signing onto this. If they got caught keeping Bucky in this basement, what was going to happen to him if he knew about it and said nothing?
“Most people aren’t raised in cages, maybe I’m just weird,” Bucky laughed softy, shrugging a bit as he pulled up the blankets to get comfortable.
As Bucky’s song continued, he sang about their meeting, the attacks, and the drama leading up to their wedding. He sang about the year they’ve had since, their talks of adoption, their rule over the Iron Kingdom, and the love they shared along the way. By the time his last note trailed off, Bucky looked down at his husbands expecting to see their neutral expressions. What he hadn’t been prepared for was the tears streaming down their cheeks.
“I just want you…” Bucky whispered just loud enough for Steve to hear, pleading to be taken from this place and spared the fate that had awaited him since he was a small child.
“This place is beautiful, I still can’t believe we’re here,” Steve smiled at the King, impressed by Bucky’s last line but not about to point it out here or anywhere else.
“Who’s Tony Stark? I’m William MacKinnon, that’s Jude Turner in the backseat, and you’re Benjamin Chapman,” Tony said, watching the GPS, as their turn appeared on it, wondering what the roads ahead were going to be like.
“It is,” Tony nodded, standing motionless for a moment before turning around to a table next to him. Taking the stopper out of an enormous crystal bottle, he poured three glasses of whiskey, one glass nearly overflowing. Handing out the two lesser filled glasses to his guests, he took the full one for himself.
Bucky was Howard Stark’s personal property.
“That’s because you’re a good man, Steve,” Sarah said with pride in her voice as she went back to her seat, looking around the opulent room as she clutched her coffee close. “And a good man is what this Kingdom needs.”
“I do like that, thank you,” Steve said as he followed him up, gasping a little as he stepped into the bedroom. The skylights above the bed were purple with the last light of the day, and the bed underneath was almost as big as Tony’s bed in the mansion, though this one looked softer. “Are you claiming your spot, Bucky?” “Yes,” Bucky replied, lying on the middle of the bed, staring up at the sky. “Will we be able to see lots of stars here?”
“Of course you do,” Bucky said, reaching up to put his hands on either side of Tony’s face, cupping his cheeks. “I don’t want to be without Steve, and I don’t want to be without you now that I have you. I don’t think it’s often you find three people that all want to be together, I think it’s pretty special and it means something. Maybe all of that had to happen to me to get me right here, right now, and…and I think that’s the only way I can justify my past, to think that I had to suffer to be here.”
“I do what I can,” Steve chuckled, blushing himself. “I mean, we can do that now, but…I kind of want something to eat first so I have some energy. I feel like I’d be terrible right now.”
“And protect him? No. No, I’m not lying to the kids at all, you’re right. I don’t want to have stories I need to keep straight,” Tony looked behind him as Steve came down the stairs with a couple of new shirts and the first aid kit. “Steve, we’re telling the kids the truth about Bucky, and my dad, and anything else they need to know about. We’re just going to have to figure out how to say it.”
“He was quiet, but his mind was always going,” Tony laughed weakly, reaching up to brush away a tear he’d managed to conjure. “He was so thoughtful, he cared about people even though they didn’t care about him. His goats were his life, and I don’t think there are better cared for goats in the whole Kingdom. Bucky was very nurturing, even if he wouldn’t admit it himself. He would have been so good with the kids we would have adopted. He would have done anything for them.”
“Tony, he did tell us what he knew,” Bucky piped up, looking over at his unimpressed fiancé. “Maybe we can figure out who hired these people if we follow the name Ten Rings.”
“Who is that guy? Why is he in your room?” Steve looked back and forth between Bucky and Clint as he closed his dressing gown, having left it open in his rush. “He’s got a sword. Why does he have a sword?”
“Kind of. I like entertaining people in here,” Tony laughed, stepping forward and turning so he could face both men. “I haven’t been ignoring you, I know it’s been a couple days since you got here, but...I’m just a man who’s not used to sharing his time with other people. I’m going to work on that.”
“It’s still a good idea, there was just a little mistake, not a big deal,” Tony said as he walked over to Pepper, putting a hand on her shoulder until he felt her relax a bit. “Take your time, I’m sure we can find something to talk about. You, what’s your name?”
“I appreciate that, thank you,” Tony didn’t want to discuss this in front of everyone, having worried that his act wasn’t realistic enough. He still worried that something was going to happen to Steve and Bucky, he still wished he could feel better about that.
“Then, yes, that’s what I want. Please,” Natasha couldn’t help the nervous smile that broke across her face. Looking at Bucky, she almost giggled when he gave her the same look.
“Steve…” Sarah sighed, shaking her head to reach over to get him a napkin, handing it over to him. “Clean yourself up with that. We can’t have the King walking in with you covered in fruit.”
Steve had been about to offer to have a bacon cheeseburger and Coke delivered for lunch when he realized what Bucky had said, his words hitting him like ice water down his back. Fourteen years of imprisonment, an entire childhood lost, and for why, he still didn’t understand. But nothing he could think of justified what they were doing to him.
If you don’t want to read sex, skip this chapter. It’s not key to the plot.
“Maybe that will get you out of your room more often,” laughed Tony, delighted in how wide Steve’s eyes were as he looked around. Obviously Steve liked it, and he couldn’t ask for a better reaction than this.
“Oh, the blond man is Steve Rogers, he’s been acting as a handler of sorts to Bucky,” Howard said casually as if he’d just introduced Tony to his new secretary.
“Bucky…” Tony didn’t know what to say to that, not wanting to break Bucky’s heart by denying his theory. Tony couldn’t believe that fate is what brought Bucky to him, he didn’t want to think that someone had to suffer just to bring him happiness.
The three of them smiled, each of them feeling that giddy rush in his chest as they let go just enough to face each other. It was like anticipating that first kiss all over again, sweaty palms, awkward grins, and pounding hearts, but it quickly culminated into something beautiful between them. A moment etched onto their minds within their perfect little home together, one that none of them were ever going to forget.
“I don’t think so,” Bucky yawned, eyes closed and ready to pass out. “I love you both.”
“Noted,” Steve said as he drew his fingers back, teasing the rim of Bucky’s ass a little before taking his hand away. Inching closer on his knees, his hands gripped Bucky’s hips for a moment, just looking down at the familiar view that had only gotten better in the last few years. Taking his cock in his hand, he gave it a few strokes, making sure it was still slick with the lotion from the jar. Positioning the tip of his erection against the tight ring of Bucky’s ass, he let out a long breath as he slowly sunk into him.
“We don’t have to talk. Want to play a video game?” Steve asked, gesturing over to the television, figuring that might help distract Bucky from whatever was upsetting him. “You can pick, even though you just beat me in every game we play. You’d make a good assassin, I swear, judging by your Call of Duty zombie prowess.”
“Steven Rogers,” Steve replied as Tony pointed to him, not sure if he should bow or nod his head, instead going with an awkward version of the two.
Supper had been an absolutely stunning event. Pepper had gone far beyond her usual level of skill and delivered a meal that was tasty as well as great entertainment. Though not much actual conversation went on during the feast, the King had told them that would wait until after, when they could have some privacy. That was for the better, however, because both Steve and Bucky were concentrating more on the sword fights and dancers than being social with anyone else. Which was much to Sarah and Natasha’s annoyance.
“I thought if I talked about what I knew, I could help,” Clint offered, hoping that would save him from the two angry looking men.
“I was so scared…” Bucky wept brokenly, curling up against Steve, holding onto him with his one arm. “I just wanted you.”
“It’s not such a bad ride...I think the motorcycle will be more fun, though,” Steve said with a strained laugh, trying to be friendly even though he wasn’t sure if he should be.
“I’m impressed. You’re a billionaire and you know what stew is,” Steve chuckled as he looked up from the ground, throwing a handful of kindling into the wheelbarrow Tony was pushing. “Do you really know how to make it?”
“I’ll take the first shift, you go to sleep for a few hours and I’ll wake you up if he wakes at all,” Tony said, still looking at Bucky as he spoke to Steve, hoping this didn’t turn into an argument, he didn’t think he could have a civil disagreement right now.
“One second,” Tony said, walking around to the passenger side and opening the door, pulling an envelope containing fake passports, drivers licenses for himself and Steve, and more cash. Stuffing it into the bag of money that was still over his shoulder, he closed up the SUV and locked it, turning towards the others. “Let’s get out of here, we’re not safe here.”
“We…we ironed things out,” Steve said softly, rubbing Bucky’s back. “I apologized, we kissed, and then we realized that we were going to be separated forever anyway. Until now, that is. Until…” He blinked hard, his eyes misting up as the thought of being with Bucky and Tony forever hit so many emotions at once.
“You just want me to make nice, get to know those two men, maybe their families too…”
“We have do to this, Natasha and your mom deserve a good life,” Bucky’s voice trembled as he snuggled tighter against Steve. “I could live in a shack with you if it was just us, I wouldn’t care, but it’s not.”
“It’s such a hard habit to break though,” Sarah held her cup in both hands, warming her palms. She should have been at work hours ago, right now she should be covered in fish innards and scales. But instead of freezing, aching hands, fingers that struggled to straighten and bend, she was sitting in a dressing gown worth more than every garment she’d ever owned put together. It was surreal in the most beautiful way possible.
He’d had to hold it together alone, and he didn’t know how much longer he could do it.
“We are, aren’t we?” Bucky’s smile was more genuine that time, more hopeful, and in that moment, he felt like he had a real chance at this. He could marry the King, he could change their kingdom, he could be everything he dreamed for himself. Steve Rogers could play the good soldier, but Bucky could be something darker, something more captivating instead.
“Be careful!” Steve called after Tony as he grabbed his bag full of money and left, locking the door before he closed it. Letting out a long breath, he pulled Bucky closer as he put his head back. “Bucky, how are you doing? Let me know what’s going on in your head so I can help.”
“You literally pulled me off the couch at a party and announced that I was yours now,” Steve chucked, rubbing her back as his mind went back to the first night they’d hooked up. “You were scary and I loved it.”
“This is better than than sling thing in the shed, we can carry a lot more. We just can’t let the box get so low again if you want to use the sling,” Steve chastised as he threw more sticks into the growing pile, freezing for a moment. “…what was that?”
“If it makes you feel any better, he doesn’t blame you in the least. And neither do I,” Steve said, watching as Tony buried his face against his hands again, feeling sorry that he was taking all of this upon himself. “We both saw how you reacted, you didn’t know, Tony. None of this was your idea or your doing, and I really don’t think Bucky’s going to start thinking that any time soon. It’s the opposite, to be truthful, he knows you saved him, he knows you’re doing everything to protect him right now.”
Though as soon as he was on the stage, he realized he wasn’t alone. Looking over to the other side, he saw Steve and his mother being led up the other stairs. All of a sudden, anger was flaring inside him, and it took everything he had to not go push Steve back into the crowd. The only thing stopping him was knowing that King Anthony was right there, and he didn’t want to start their relationship with the King thinking he was a lunatic.
“Sire, this is your first supper with the lottery winners,” Pepper reminded him urgently, walking over to his desk. “They’re waiting for you to arrive so they can be brought in.”
“I hope I don’t disappoint you then,” Steve said as he lifted the red velvet cloth away to reveal a gold framed painting of the three of them in their more casual clothes. Captured in paint, Tony held one of his machines in one hand, his other arm around Steve, who had his arm around Tony on one side and Bucky on the other. In Bucky’s arm was a small black and white miniature goat, a favourite of his named Bess. The background was split between a pear tree with ripe, bright fruit hanging from its branches, and a wild rose bush.
“Of course,” Tony led Bucky over to the mirror himself, putting an arm around him as Bucky took in his image. “What do you think? Think we can get you a working arm one day?”
“It sounds a lot easier than it feels,” Steve began to rub his back again as Tony came out of the house carrying one brown and one grey car seat, running over to the liftgate to put them in along with the bag before turning to Bucky. “Are you okay?”
“Then who?” the little voice in his head was gone now. Stane was fully annoyed once more.
“They were reasonable,” shrugged Tony casually, looking at Fury very matter of factly.
“I knew this wasn’t a good idea,” Stane muttered as he went to take a seat, rubbing his brow.
“W-wow…” was all Steve could manage, his heart beating with excitement in his chest. Then, as the thought of Bucky getting made over entered his head, he couldn’t fight back the blush that rose to his cheeks. He’d always thought that Bucky was handsome, and imagining what he looked like now was definitely having an effect on Steve.
“I do…” Bucky continued the hug, clenching his eyes shut as he tried to shut out the world and forget that the day he’d dreaded had finally come. He had to believe that if he had Steve, he would have hope, and more importantly, that he’d always have love.
Steve nodded a little, taking a reluctant bite of his omelette as he pretended to be interested in his plate. He knew what he was unloading on Sam, and he knew how it was going to affect him. They’d been best friends since high school, and as much as they’d yet to admit to each other, they were brothers in each others hearts.
“No, it builds up. It starts off not that bad, but the longer I’m outside of my cage, the shock gets worse. It takes about a minute and a half to kill me,” Bucky said softly, his shoulder sagging as he felt defeat wash over him. “They didn’t tell Jack the truth either, he wanted to get me out of here, but it doesn’t exactly sound good that they’re more willing for me to die than get away.”
“No, we’re not calling them that, stop it,” Steve argued gently, though at this moment he was almost happy enough to buy into Tony’s idea. He was going to have a son and a daughter, he had his two husbands, his heart couldn’t get any more full at that moment.
“I know,” Bucky sighed, heading out the door, wondering if the guards would have jobs after tonight considering his head almost got cut off.
“I’m sure you could,” Tony said encouragingly, wondering if he should take Bucky by the arm before he told himself to just do it. Stepping beside Bucky, he offered his arm and a smile. “Shall we?”
“What is taking him so long?” Sarah asked quietly, standing in a room off the hall wearing a brand new light blue dress, her blonde hair in an intricate braid down her back.
“Maybe we should stop and dump that, he might need it again,” Tony said as he pulled over, waiting for Bucky to finish before he got out and took the bucket to dump it in the ditch, trying to ignore the sight and smell of it. He was going to be having kids, this would probably be on him at some point, and he was honestly struggling with that part. Taking out a half drunk bottle of water out of the cup holder, he rinsed the bucket and returned it to Bucky, miraculously not adding to the sick on the side of the road himself.
“Here we go,” Natasha whispered, unaware that Sarah had said the same thing to her son. “Are you ready?”
“Of course,” Bucky nodded, figuring he wouldn’t mind performing it in the future now that his initial jitters were gone.
“That was amazing,” Tony said as he began to clap, standing up to his feet as if he were at a professional performance. “That was beautiful, Bucky, how could you think it was any less than that? That was us in a song. You captured us.”
“Did you pick this place because of me?” Bucky asked from the backseat, realizing that he hadn’t seen another car since they left town, and also that he didn’t mind cars as much when Steve drove.
“…deal…” Pepper reached forward to shake it, though she didn’t look very happy about it. “I hope you can find someone else.”
“I definitely want to go in there, and you can’t bore me,” Bucky chuckled, relaxing a little after the tension of their last conversation. “It does look kind of creepy, though. Mostly because of the dark.”
“Elektra Natchios is out…” Von Doom said immediately, trying to think as well. “I angered her a few years ago after a job she failed to complete for me. I don’t trust her, and she doesn’t trust me.”
“Now, Von Doom,” Tony turned to the other King next, smiling at him. “Do you really want to stay here and watch me get married? Or would you rather just scurry back to Latveria now that your plans have gone to shit? Because, if I’m going to be truthful, I don’t particularly need or want you here. So…what is it?”
“I’m okay, still sick in the morning,” Bucky said with a nervous smile, wishing they could just skip to the part where he found out his baby was okay. “I haven’t forgotten to take my vitamins or any of that.”
“Tony…” Howard started, walking over to him to calm his son, not wanting him to scare Bucky on their first meeting.
Bucky didn’t reply, only pulling his blanket around him tighter, looking up at the tall trees lining the sides of the road. He was hoping to see a moose, he’d seen one in a nature book once and he didn’t know if he believed they could be as tall as he read.
“I know it. I know him.”
“Someone needs to come by today, we can’t wear these all day. Surely there’s something they want us to do,” Sarah tilted her head a bit as she thought about what she could do with all her spare time here. “I should be working on an embroidery design for your wedding.”
“Everything looks great,” Christine said as she put her stethoscope around her neck. “Try to eat a little more, Bucky, it’s just a few pounds but you should try to gain them back.”
“Sorry, I’m just trying to make conversation. It sucks in here,” Steve sighed, looking out a crack at the street below, the whole alley bathed in evening light. He was getting hungry, but he knew they would have to wait to eat, and they weren’t getting meals like they did in the castle either. He felt fully spoiled by the lifestyle he’d grown accustomed to.
“I think I speak for Steve and myself when I say fuck yes,” Tony said with a little laugh, his hands grasping Bucky’s thighs to keep them against him as he thrust into the younger man, feeling like his cock was getting harder with every precious sound his lover was making. It was going to be hard to last long with Bucky, everything about fucking him was like something straight from one of his personal fantasies.
“I’m going to figure something out, okay? I don’t know how or what or when, but I’m not going to let them keep you in a basement for your entire life. Maybe if…the chip in your neck, could you just stand the shock if I run you through?” Steve was pretty sure Ms. Carr had said the shock wouldn’t badly hurt Bucky, but he didn’t want to just try it.
“It’s not doing things that I’m worried about,” Bucky leaned back against the wall, finishing off his beer and setting the cup on another barrel. “It’s how I look. I don’t look right, especially with my shirt off. It’s so…unbalanced, and…ugly.”
“Do you know how I felt that day? When that weird fucking asshole drugged me and I woke up with one arm?” Bucky asked as he brought his eyes up to meet Steve’s, not realizing he was frowning.
“After two, and no, I’m not tired,” Tony pointed over at the coffee machine which was still half full, an empty mug sitting not far away. “So can I ask why you’re in here? Because you don’t come in here. You text or send someone in here to get me, or you just wait until you see me.”
“Tony, you already know you’re in a position of power over them. You’re royalty, and they’re only here because you’ve invited them,” Rhodey sighed softly, hoping he was getting his point across without upsetting Tony or making his problems worse. “Whatever you do, they have to answer to you, so get that out of your head because there’s not a lot you can do about it.”
“So what else have you been up to? How’s…I mean, are you still talking to Peggy? How’s that going?” Sam asked him, leaning forward in his chair, a little curious why he hadn’t seen his best friend in so long. If he wasn’t sure of it, he’d swear that Steve was seeing something and hiding her from him.
“I won’t pretend that you weren’t one, because you were,” Bucky said matter-of-factly, not about to sugar coat Steve’s behavior over the last few years. “But I have to admit, I don’t think I would have been ready for your apology for a while there. I was really angry.”
“I remember my father’s rule, I wasn’t that young,” grumbled Tony as he picked up one of his tools, fidgeting with it in his hand. He remembered a lot about his father; mainly that he was relatively loved and admired by the public, and that there had been no major wars under his rule. King Roger was still regarded highly among the older population, while King Anthony wasn’t so adored.
“It was fine, we mostly played cards between patrols,” Steve took the tea with both hands, leaning back in his chair. “It’s not quite what I pictured when I signed up to the King’s service. I thought I’d be doing good, not breaking up bar fights and getting cats down from rooftops.”
Steve jumped as he heard a sound like the front door being kicked in. Unweaving himself from Bucky, he clambered over to a small hole in the middle of the floor Namor had showed him. Pushing aside the book that was covering it, he looked down into the lit room below in time to see a bleeding Namor on the floor with two guards standing over him. And more guards were coming.
Until their wedding, he wanted to be apart as little as possible.
“Jesus. Are they hiring? Because I’ll give up being a pilot for whatever the hell is is you do now. What do you do now?” Sam asked as he walked over to a table in the corner, taking a seat and picking up a menu. “Why am I looking at this, I want the Denver omelette.”
“Steve, I know you love Bucky and you blame yourself for what happened to him, but he’s a very angry man,” Sarah said softly, knowing that her words would hurt her son. “He’s changed since you knew him. I’ve talked to lots of people around town about him and they just avoid him now. Why would the King pick an angry man who pushes his people away?”
“If you’re sure,” Bucky said with an uneasy laugh, still wary on how to behave exactly and hating Natasha for not choosing to do this herself. She was way better with people than he was. He knew he really needed to get some sort of pardon for her past crimes though, he didn’t know if they’d try to throw her in the dungeons.
“I think it’s beautiful, it’s so…” Steve was at a loss for words, not sure what he should say. He still didn’t know exactly what Tony had in mind, but he was sure he could guess. “Who works in here?”
“Sire…”
“I’ve never asked him,” Steve said, though he wished he did. He’d have to ask him in the morning when he was awake, but he didn’t think he was going to like the answer. “He’s seen lots of movies and television shows, so he knows what life on the outside is like, he’s just never participated in it.”
As the two of them laughed together again, Steve knew that he’d made the right decision, and not just because it was going to make Peggy happier, but she’d be safer the further away from him she could get. Pouring them each a coffee, they shared the morning together, going over good memories and bad, realizing how much they’d needed each other for so long. Steve knew that there was never going to be another Peggy in his life, and for that he was grateful, because he didn’t think he could handle two. As sweetly and playful as their relationship began, it changed over Kenyan blend from a fairytale marriage into a rock solid friendship.
“You should have heard her when she was born, she was loud. We’re definitely going to know when she wants something,” Tony chuckled himself, beyond thrilled that Bucky seemed more wrapped up in seeing his children than in worrying that they weren’t at home. “She calmed right down for her Daddy, though.”
“I was told to kill Steve Rogers and James Barnes,” Clint said as Tony took the slip of paper off him to look over his code. “I know they’re the King’s fiancés because I was there on the evening of the lottery.”
“Yes,” Steve said without a moment of hesitation, knowing in that moment that he truly meant it. He would figure out something to help his mother so she didn’t have to work so hard, but he would give up this beautiful life to apologize to Bucky. “It’s the least I could do. Is that what you want?”
“Then Steven, place the ring on Tony’s right ring finger and pledge your life to him,” the priest said, the corner of his mouth tugging up into an amused smile. He hadn’t minded the interruption, he found Tony’s wish to be rather sweet.
“…Bucky, you know we can’t let you go. You’re legally dead, and you’re very unique, and that means you’re going to live a different life from everyone else,” Howard said without much sympathy as the boy broke down in front of him. “The rest of your room will be packed up and sent to the mansion, it shouldn’t take you both long to unpack. I’ll leave you to it for now.”
“Shut up, you know what I mean,” Bucky blushed, biting his bottom lip as he hugged Steve closer. “Well, now that you bring it up, I definitely mean both.”
“…why?” Bucky asked, suddenly tensing up and looking very worried.
“I think you’re having some anxiety, baby. Do you want me to carry you to bed?” Steve offered, not sure if he should give him room to breathe or hug him tighter. “We can talk to Tony later, don’t even think about that right now. I want you to think about you, I want to know what you want and need.”
“And now, so you can all get back to drinking and having fun, let’s get this draw over with!” Tony gestured for Stane to step forward, a large bowl of paper scraps in his hands. “I’ll pull out one piece of paper and read out the number, and then I want the owner of the ticket to put up their hand and step forward. Just the winner, please, we’ll have lots of time to bring your family to the castle tonight.”
“Wow, I didn’t realize things were that far gone,” Sam said, pouring his sugar into his newly delivered coffee, adding some cream along with it. “So what’s the new job like? You’ve been pretty vague about it, I mean…I just know you’re rich and you have a sweet bike now.”
“The big blue one on the right,” Steve answered, not moving from his spot.
Tony jerked the wheel, going up on the sidewalk in front of a thankfully empty bus stop and nailing the mailbox hard enough to send it a few feet down the pavement. Sitting completely still for a few seconds, he turned and looked at Bucky and Steve in the backseat, blinking a few times before slowly turning back around and continuing to drive down the street.
“I definitely need something to eat, I’m starving,” Walking over to Bucky, Steve began to undo the ties on his clothes, working the man out of his fancy clothes. “There you go, how’s that?”
“Yes you may,” Bucky reached over, getting the vessel of water they were sharing, taking a drink, mostly just to stall answering. He knew Steve could be impatient sometimes. “And no. Who else would want me?”
“…you promise?” Bucky whispered, hope shining in his eyes.
“And what is this warrior’s name?” asked Von Doom, truly curious now.
“And do you Steven Grant Rogers accept these two men into your heart? Do you pledge to give them the best of yourself every single day? Do you swear your loyalty to them through troubles or triumphs?” the priest touched Steve next, his pale old hand giving his arm a squeeze.
“You’ve already pigged out today. And how are you still standing?” Natasha said teasingly, leaning back against the wall. “You’ve drunk so much beer and you’re still okay, I don’t know how that works.”
Taking a card out of the deck, Bucky flipped it between his metal fingers, his eyes on Steve’s as he flashed him the ace. One. For now.
Bucky ignored Ms. Carr, though there was anger in his expression now as he shot a group of undead Nazis. He didn’t look up as Steve stepped from the room.
“I’m sure it will be,” Ms. Carr said, her own smile lacking genuine feeling. “Please, follow me.”
“Your back and shoulder must be killing you, though, you don’t have to do it all now,” Tony said softly, wishing Bucky would stop, especially when he could see him hurting. “You’re supposed to be resting with your blood pressure. Let me take you to the couch.”
“Good, I love flukes. There’s something satisfying about them,” grinned Tony, giving Pepper a wink as she shook her head again. “This is going to go down in history. No one’s going to want to forget it.”
Tony plunked down on the floor, tired of squatting, watching as Bucky took apart the offending stain, wondering if it was as easy as this to ease his mind. “You’re doing a good job at that. Should have used the chainsaw in the shed though, it’d be done in four cuts.”
“I won’t,” Tony watched at Steve slowly drifted off to sleep, not looking entirely comfortable in his chair, as he put his feet on the bottom of the hospital bed. With his elbows planted on the thin mattress of the hospital bed beside Bucky, Tony leaned in and buried his face against his hands, fingers carding though his hair as the tears squeezed out between his eyelids, running down his palm. In that moment, all the pain of the day caught up with him hard, and he knew then that it was going to continue to weigh on him for a long time. If they long the twins, it was going to be forever.
“Who tried to kill us?” Bucky needed to know, he needed to know where all of this was coming from. “Tony, I feel like I’m going out of my mind, is this over? You have to tell me it’s over.”
“Because I secretly love hockey and fries with gravy and cheese on them,” Tony shot back sarcastically, feeling guilty the second he did that. “No one would think to look for me up there, it’s isolated, there’s an airport even though it’s isolated, it works.”
“I love you more than anything, and when I thought I was going to lose you in that attic, I wanted to die alongside you,” said Steve when he could finally find the words to express what was going on in his head. “I love you and Tony, I can’t live without you.”
“That’s not what I want, I still want to do this, I just need some time…” Bucky said weakly, not moving his face from the pillows. “I just…for the first time in my life, I don’t want to die. I have everything I want, I have you two, and even if things aren’t perfect with us having to hide, I don’t want to leave this. I’ve only had a bit of happy life, I want more.”
“That’s very touching, Tony,” Pepper smiled at him sadly, not surprised when he couldn’t return the expression. “What about Bucky? He was so quiet talking to me, I feel like I barely knew him.”
“What does it matter what Bucky wants? Tony, he’s not a person, not any more, he’s been removed from the grid, he died when he was three,” Howard said, shaking his head at his son’s reaction to his wonderful news. “He knows he’s yours, he’s always known that.”
“Maybe the King can make him happy though, maybe he can bring a smile to his face and he’d be the Bucky I know again,” Steve hoped that could be the case, that it wasn’t too late to save Bucky from himself.
“Well excuse me for not brushing up on my polygamy lessons before meeting with you today,” Rhodey shrugged again, at a loss for what to say. Usually Tony liked his advice, he felt bad letting him down today. “Tony, if it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be. What will happen if they do leave?”
“Shh!” Natasha perked up, looking up as the musicians stopped playing on stage and more red and gold lanterns were lit. “It’s time!”
His eyes still meeting Fury’s, Tony did his best to stand tall, look regal, and be intimidating. Right until the moment he began to laugh. “…damn you.”
“…we don’t have long to go, can you hold out another quarter mile?” Tony asked, wishing he could do something to ease this pain for Bucky, hating to see him like this. He had to remind himself that it was going to be worth it, but at this point it was hard to keep that in his mind.
“You want me to…?” Steve asked, waiting for Bucky to nod before he reached out to select a card of his own, showing Bucky the five of diamonds. “You don’t have to…”
“So how’s it going? Almost done?”
“Because they want to make sure you’re straight, and that you don’t fall in love with me like Jack did,” Bucky said casually, watching intently as the cards slid from hand to hand. “My creator, Father, said he wasn’t making the mistake of hiring a single person again, so obviously you’re married if he hired you.”
Steve’s heart ached in his chest watching Bucky comfort him, touched that Bucky could be so loving as to be the one to look after Tony. He’d only known Bucky for a few months, but he was the person that knew him best in the world, and even he was surprised by the level of compassion that Bucky was showing.
“Not a problem. Had some fakes made up, they’re in the glove compartment,” Tony said, nodding his head towards it. “Everything’s taken care of, I had the house stocked up, there’s fire wood…”
Something told him this wasn’t going to be an easy decision.
“I don’t care, I want to know now,” insisted Tony, not backing down, more than a little interested now. If he was going to have to spend these days without Bucky and Steve, he might as well get something accomplished. “Tell me what my legacy is.”
“I’ve…I’ve never thought of it like that,” Steve stammered, taking a deep breath in as he thought about everything he’d drawn to that point. He’d always gotten frustrated with the flaws in his work, but maybe he should be thinking about how that just made him unique instead. “Is that what you tell yourself when you work on your inventions?”
“Let’s just say, it was really fortunate that the kid after me showed off his giant jar of bottle caps,” Steve sighed, kissing the top of Bucky’s head, nuzzling him and breathing in the smell of fresh shampoo.
“Of course, whatever you want,” Tony said, kissing the top of Bucky’s head as he reached over him to set his hand on Steve’s side, smiling as he soon felt Steve’s hand on his. Keeping quiet, he watched as Bucky soon drifted off to sleep, unable to get the smile off his face.
“You’re not ugly, Buck,” Natasha sighed, hating every time this came up. She hadn’t found the right thing to say to him yet, but she was still working on it. “You don’t know the King, maybe he wouldn’t care.”
“You could have at least come up with a plausible lie,” Bucky sighed, looking at Steve, who was struggling not to look as amused as he was. “Did he say that?”
“You’re asking if I’m okay? Tony…I can’t imagine what’s going through your head, don’t worry about me,” Steve said lowly, not wanting to wake Bucky, he felt like he and Tony needed to work some details out together before they talked to Bucky.
“Are you alright?” Bucky frowned, watching as Tony tried again to straighten his hair. “Is this a bad time? We can come back.”
“Good, I’m glad to hear you’re taking this so seriously,” Dr. Marner said, fiddling with her computer for a moment. “I think we have the ultrasound working, I’m getting black image here along with you three.”
“I’m a virgin, I’m not a prude, I’ve been thinking about being with you for years. I hoped you would be like this, enthusiastic about it, but this is beyond the best of my imagination,” Bucky chuckled as well, staring up at him, not bothering to fix his shirt that had rode up his stomach when Tony was on top of him. “Tony, you’re not pushing me, I want this. I want both you and Steve.”
“You’re sure you can’t go with fire? Fire’s impressive,” Tony nodded, finishing his tea and setting down the delicate china on his own table.
“I knew you were married,” Bucky said, chewing on his lip for a moment, reaching over for the cards so he could slowly shuffle them.
“You’re not going to lose me,” Tony said angrily, half wanting to take the bottle back, but he didn’t want to escalate things between them. “I just need some time, like you said, no one gets over something like this overnight.”
“It’s so cool!” Bucky said, popping his head over it to look down at Tony and Steve. “The roof is made of window above the bed, but there are these sliding things that cover it. I think we should open it up. Oh, and there’s another bathroom up here!”
Staring at his husbands, his heart growing in his chest, Bucky felt the ghosts of his past getting fainter, their cold hands letting him go as the warm sun beamed down on everything he had in the world.
“I promise, as soon as the doctor gives you the all clear, we’ll get right back to fucking like bunnies,” Tony laughed, absolutely delighted to see Bucky in a good mood considering he was still away from home. It wasn’t anything he was about to point out now, he didn’t want to give Bucky anxiety, but he’d have to mention it to him later when they were in bed.
They’d all been married for two months now, and life in their house in the woods had been nearly perfect. Bucky was doing well, his doctor set to arrive later that week, and their babies were flourishing inside him. He was, however, stuck on bed rest, which meant that all the work around the house was falling to Steve and Tony, who were only too happy to do it for him. It was a comfortable, quiet life, and even Tony had to admit that he was enjoying the break from being surrounded by technology and people. It was going to be hard to leave the Yukon when the time came, it really had become home for the three of them.
“How did you know that?” Steve asked, watching his hands move, marvelling at the dexterity of the metal hand. He didn’t think prosthetic technology was anywhere near this, but he still didn’t feel right asking about it.
Finishing his drink, he reached over and picked it up with one hand as he fished out a small key from his breast pocket. Sliding it into the tiny lock, it opened with a barely audible click, the lid swinging open to reveal something even the wizard Strange didn’t have in his possession. It was an iridescent glass ring the size of a dinner plate with tiny cracks running all over it’s surface. As Stane lifted it from it’s case and put his hands on either side, it began to glow from within, letting out a low humming noise.
“What? Why not?” Steve blinked, genuinely surprised to hear that answer.
“You mentioned once there was a council you go to,” Tony said, crossing his arms to keep himself from fiddling with more of the little bottles. They had wisps of coloured smoke in them, and he couldn’t stop wondering what it was.
Steve turned on the newly acquired and assembled ultrasound they’d been informed to get by Bucky’s new doctor, a lovely woman who was checking on Bucky over video calls until she could come up there for a few months. So far, they’d needed to buy a few medical supplies, and all of Bucky’s appointments over the internet had gone well, but Bucky was starting to show now. He was only going to get bigger, making things more complicated, and Steve was worried that Dr. Marner alone couldn’t save him if something went wrong.
“Don’t you fucking touch me. You have lost that right,” Tony said with a snarl, keeping his voice as low and even as he could for the sake of Bucky’s nerves. “Get out of here, or I swear to god, you will regret having me.”
“Yeah, Tony?” Steve answered softly, hugging both of the men as close as he could.
“I’m pretty sure the King has people to embroider for his occasions, and I’m not definitely marrying him. Don’t forget about Bucky,” Steve reminded her, getting back up on his feet to grab more food.
“You don’t owe me anything, you know that right?” Tony asked, reaching his hand out to touch Bucky’s shoulder, giving it a squeeze as he watched his husband working on the floor.
~~~~~~~~~~~
“Tony, he’s alive!” Steve said in a panic as he stood over Bucky, who’d been hit in the shoulder, looking over at the doctor cowering in the corner. “Can you help him?? Please? BUCKY!” Steve panicked as Bucky’s eyes slowly drifted shut, slapping his cheek to try to rouse him with no avail.
Closing his eyes, Tony broke down a little, shaking his head as he felt tears fall off the bottom of his jaw. He could hear their voices telling him to keep going, that he was doing great, and that he could do this. They would be there for him when Stane was gone, they were going to be his family now, and they could do this.
“So…it’s our wedding night…” Tony was pretty much reading Steve’s mind at the moment, wondering where his normal confidence had gone. “I mean, I know we all want this, so…what are we waiting for?”
“Not at all, I was just packing and doing laundry, and then and seeing if I had time for a nap before you called. This is actually more convenient,” she said as she looked at Bucky, still amazed every time that a young man was carrying twins for as long as he had. “I will be up there and able to see Bucky in person this weekend.”
“He’s smart,” Tony said, looking back at Steve, nodding a little. “I do care about you. I know we just met but I’m glad you’re here. I’m glad for your role in all of this because I think Bucky needed you. I need you. If anything good is going to come out of all of this horror, I hope it’s this.”
“I like doing yoga,” Bucky began, counting on his fingers as Steve had, still shaking all over as tears ran down his face. “I love bacon especially on cheeseburgers, I like Coke but not Pepsi, I can speak Russian and German, and….and I don’t remember what outside is like because I haven’t left this room since I was three.”
Steve took a deep breath, holding his tongue as a litany of cursing ran through his head along with the image of himself punching Howard Stark’s teeth down his throat. Squeezing Bucky’s hand tightly, he fought to will himself to be calm, taking a few deep breaths as he thought of something he could possibly say to that.
“Please, have a seat,” Ms. Carr said, taking one herself at the head of the table. “Before we begin, we’re going to have to ask you to sign a contract.”
“You don’t have to say it, I wanted you to stay,” Bucky blushed at the attention, rather enjoying it. “You don’t have to fuss on me, I’m okay now that I know you’re both good with it. I’m so glad you’re-“
“I’m sure Tony might want you to share,” Bucky chuckled, though Steve couldn’t see how much he was blushing in the darkness of the small room. “But I appreciate it.”
“…are you sure you want me to…?” Bucky gestured to his shirt, reaching over to tug the loose hanging sleeve. “I get that it’s not exactly sexy, I can keep the shirt on to cover it up, it’s not going to upset me if y-“
“Don’t worry, you can change on the plane if you want,” Steve rubbed Bucky’s shoulder, pretty sure that he didn’t actually care about that, but he was going to play along.
Bucky looked between them at the wide smiles on both their faces, a small one appearing on his own as he leaned back against Steve and closed his eyes. “How about we just lie together for a bit?” Bucky said sleepily, already worn down with the excitement of his day, though he wasn’t ready to take a nap just yet. “Our bed?”
“Holy shit…” Bucky burst into laughs, his head still swimming, but he couldn’t stop looking at his tiny baby girl. “Our little Gwen…”
“Jesus Christ,” Steve and Tony said in unison, staring down at Bucky breathing hard and full of Steve’s fingers.
“Are you sure we’re safe?” Bucky frowned as they were loaded up into the covered cart, staying close to Steve.
“Bucky knows, Tony. If your goal was to protect his feelings, he’s already guessed,” Steve said with a sign, getting up to go sit closer to his husband, wrapping an arm around him. “Of course it was going to bother you, even if it was a stranger it would probably bother you, not many people can just shoot someone and be instantly okay.”
“See, everything’s under control. Well, except the draw, obviously, but we can work with that,” Tony laughed, finding himself a little nervous in front of Steve and Bucky. He wanted them to like him, but he didn’t know how genuinely likeable he was as everyone just put up with his shit with a smile on their face. “Though I like this, I think fate has brought you both to me, and then hopefully my heart will do the rest.”
And as he stepped forward, the stoic look he’d adopted didn’t waver for a moment.
“Steve..” Tony got up from his couch, kneeling down in front of the painting to study all the little details Steve had included within it. “Did you…is that my mechanical horse?”
Standing in front of Bucky’s door between his guards, he raised his hand for the tenth time to knock on it, only to pull it back as if the wood was going to burn him. He’d felt like that before, back when Bucky gave his arm for the elixir that gave him strength and health. Every single time he went to talk to his friend, he couldn’t bring himself to, and what had it cost him? He didn’t want history to repeat itself, though, he truly wanted to do this. He just didn’t want it to blow up in his face, though even he admitted he deserved no less.
“Fine, you don’t get any,” Tony said stubbornly, pushing the wheelbarrow further into the woods, pretending to be angry as he tried not to burst out laughing. It didn’t last long, though, the second he looked back at his husband, he lost his last bit of control, the sound of their combined laughter echoing in the empty woods.
“It’s…Peg, I love you, you’re amazing…” Steve began, shaking his head as everything in him screamed at him not to break Peggy’s heart.
“And I can drive the car into the lake, but is it a good idea?” Tony asked, popping an almond into his mouth. “Climb the tree if you want to climb something.”
“Show and…what?” Bucky asked, looking confused, though it was enough to distract him for a moment.
“…what do you mean you made him?” Tony asked, mentally begging for this to be more innocent than it sounded.
“Give it to him, give it to him, Steve, you’re doing so fucking good,” Tony guided him, raking his nails up Steve’s thighs and around to his lower stomach. “You’re going to fill Bucky up, and you’re going to scream when you do it. You’re going to cum so hard, you’re not going to be able to move, you’re-“
“I suppose I don’t have to ask where you were, you’re right here. We were supposed to meet an hour ago!”
“Now that we’re getting closer to him being moved, we had minimized the staff and were relying on your predecessor to keep him company. After his death, there has been a short period of time where Bucky has been alone more often, he’s not always up to socializing with me or some of the others. He was very attached to his last companion,” Ms. Carr said, knowing just how attached his companion was getting to him, which was why they’d had to get rid of the man. He hadn’t given them any other choice, really. “He’s taken it very hard, and he’s nervous about the move, we thought it would be best not to stress him with lots of new people, I think you’re going to be enough for him to swallow for now.”
“This is impossible, my Uncle says we don’t tax the peasants unfairly,” Tony was stunned, figuring he might have a reputation of partying too much, but not this. “He said they’re being taxed so low our own amount of gold was lower than the other Kingdoms. I specifically wanted that, he assured me! Are you sure there’s no mistake?”
“He’s telling the truth, I didn’t sleep with Bucky until he was pregnant,” Steve lied, though he didn’t know how much that was going to help. He was going do anything he could to keep Bucky and his children safe.
“It’s not up to me,” Bucky said, pulling his knees up to his chest and hugging them, resting his chin on top. “Nothing is up to me. Even if I do choose what to eat, I still have to go on the exercise bike as long as I’m told to based on my choices.”
“I’m sorry, this can’t be comfortable,” Tony laughed softly as their lips separated, unable to resist the urge to nip at Bucky’s bottom lip. “I don’t want to push you or rush you into anything you’re not ready for.”
“Maybe the gods worked in your favour that night,” Steve blushed at the compliment, delighted that Tony both him and Bucky. He couldn’t help but feel protective over his old friend.
“He’s there now?” Stane immediately sprung into action, pushing past his assistant and all but running down the corridors. He was an active man, but he was also a big one, and he was quickly out of breath by the time he got downstairs. Making his way through the people, he tried not to push as he moved through the crowd, but he was quickly getting frustrated with those in his way.
“Why would you do that?” Bucky sat up more, his plate almost sliding out of his lap as he stared at her with wide eyes. “Tasha, you’re wanted, you shouldn’t be going near guards or…you can’t stand on stage if you win, you’ll be recognized.”
“I can get down, I don’t want to sit with my back against anything. Can I ride into town just lying on Steve?” Bucky asked, leaning against Steve, breathing hard as the contraction finally left.
“I think we should go up there,” Steve said finally after a few minutes of listening for any sounds from Bucky, though the silence was just as bad.
“Shower, definitely,” Bucky said, pointing above his head, though he had no idea what was actually above him right now. He was still learning most of the layout of the place.
“Steve…” Sarah sighed, but she knew her son wasn’t going to budge on this. “I really hope you win this, you know. You’re such a talented artist, and if you had the money to buy proper supplies, I know you could make beautiful things. I want you to be able to flourish, not just live.”
“God…” Tony wished he had another drink, the warm buzz from the first three not doing anything to touch the pain in his chest. “I’m going to get that chip out of him, I’m going to get him outside and…and I’m so fucking sorry. I feel sick to my stomach thinking of what happened to him in my name, I am going to spend the rest of my life making it up to him one way or another.”
“I can’t say no to that…” Steve breathed, taking Bucky’s hand as he crawled onto the bed with him, pulling Bucky against himself as he kissed him hard, pushing him back into the mattress. Running his hands down Bucky’s side, they made their way behind him to grip his ass, squeezing it  as he felt their cocks slipping against each other. “Oh my fucking god, you taste delicious…”
“It was hard in a way that you’re probably not thinking, baby, we were just worried about getting care for you either way,” Tony said, brushing a piece of hair behind Bucky’s ear before leaning over to give him a soft kiss. “I’m going to be honest, I’m not sure what I’m going to do to help you yet. But that doesn’t mean I’m not going to work hard at finding a solution. I will not let you be in danger, it’s not happening. Protecting you is the whole reason we’re in the middle of nowhere already.”
“He didn’t volunteer for this, Tony, we made him for you,” Howard said, excitement in his voice as he was finally getting to reveal the fruits of this long process. “He’s been waiting for you for fourteen years.”
“I think that may be a good idea,” Von Doom nodded, looking over at Stane for a moment before giving Tony another smile. “My exhaustion is catching up to me a bit, I think the whiskey is to blame for that.”
“We shouldn’t be talking in public like this, even quietly,” Von Doom said sternly, his own way of ending the conversation as he leaned back in the wood pew, looking around the room at the lavish decorations. What a waste of money.
“Oh, shit!” Steve cursed, putting the scoop back into the container to start cleaning up the spill. “Sorry, sorry…morning, Peg.”
“His son had an accident and needs care in the city, so he can’t come up here with him,” Tony said, taking a deep breath and picking up the bags again, heading up the stairs. He’d packed the bags until bursting, everything from clothes to toiletries to electronics, he wanted to make sure they weren’t going to be bored when they were there. “If it makes you feel better, I gave him more than what he was asking, figured it might help with his kid.”
“Because you imprisoned him and did experiments on him! Me loving him has nothing to do with you, I’d rather he had a full happy life than to have suffered for me!” Tony snapped, his heard beating faster as he watched the doctor readying Bucky for this procedure. He could see the fear on Bucky’s face, and he hated himself that he was related to the man doing that to him.
“Why do you worry about me? I just break up fights and catch thieves and that, and I have Sam in case someone tries something,” said Steve, frowning a little when he thought he saw something in the shadows of the alley near Sam.
“What would I do? I’d say something like…” Tony crawled closer, his eyes shining in the light of the fireplace, studying each and every mark on Bucky’s body. “Steve, fuck his brains out while I keep him busy. Stuff’s on the nightstand.”
“You don’t want to wait a few days? Plan things out?” Steve furrowed his brow a little, though after he said it, he really wasn’t sure what they needed to plan if it was just them other than if Bucky wanted to decorate.
“Actually, we can’t. Not a lip to lip one, anyway,” Tony sighed, frustration in his voice as he looked Steve in the eye. “You two can’t either, we all have to go in this in a frustratingly virginal manner. I mean, I’m not one, but I can’t have slept with either of you. If you have slept together, don’t tell me.”
Bucky shook his head a little, crying hard as he pressed a kiss to Peter’s head on top of his black locks. “Thank you…” he wept, nuzzling his son and breathing him in. “Thank you for not taking them away from me…”
“Are you going to tell us?” Bucky’s voice was barely above a whisper as he leaned forward. Everything in him was telling him to grab onto Steve, but he couldn’t force himself to move.
“I wonder how much longer the free food and drink will be around, that can’t possibly go on all night,” Natasha changed the subject, trying to get Bucky into a better mood. Maybe this hadn’t been the best plan for him, Natasha had hoped he would see it as more of a chance for change. Instead, Bucky seemed to just use it as another excuse to hate his appearance.
“You’re very welcome,” Tony raised his glass, smiling widely as Pepper lead Von Doom from the room. As the doors closed behind him, his face fell back into a melancholy expression as he grabbed the whiskey to pour himself more.
“You…” Steve wasn’t sure what to add to that, feeling like he could cry. “Buck, I don’t deserve you. You’re beautiful, you know that, right? Inside and out, there’s no one out there like you, and I’m the one that gets to call you mine. How am I supposed to go through the rest of my life without holding you for every minute of it?”
“Did you see Sam? I was glad he didn’t have to work, it was funny seeing him get that drunk,” Steve laughed, sitting on the edge of the bed, though he wondered if he was being too bold taking a seat there. “I didn’t even know he could dance like that, especially on a table. Natasha sure got a laugh over it.”
Tony has a talk with Bucky and the two of them include Steve in their plans.
“I think I’m too tired to feel,” Tony looked at his watch, not surprised that it was some time after two. “Do you want a coffee, babe?”
“I’m not going out there for you,” Pepper said flatly, watching Tony toss back the whiskey in one gulp. “Sire, if I went out there, they’d only keep chanting to see you. I can’t do this job for you.”
“I didn’t know there were forty four types of solitaire,” Steve said, trying to sound interested rather than sad that Bucky obviously had more time on his hands than anyone he’d ever met. He should be out hanging out with friends, going to school and planning for his future, not mastering how to play games by himself.
“Commoners have no idea how to behave like royalty, that’s absolutely out of the question,” Stane said, clearing his throat as he wondered how his sainted sister could produce such a challenging offspring. “I have four nobles selected for you to choose from, two men and two women, and you can pick one of them. They’ll have more of an idea of how to rule than someone off the streets.”
“Uhm, what else? What else can we really put?” Tony asked, thinking that over, catching the colourful ball of glass. “We can’t really specify that they need to be nice, or generous, or anything like that. Anyone can say they’re those things anyway.”
“You’re not much help, Rhodey,” Tony said flatly, leaning back against the bench as he crossed his arms over his chest.
“Let’s get to Dawson City, and get settled, then we can talk about that more,” Tony said, his voice straining to stay low and even as he backed up and got back on the road. “It’s your choice, Bucky, just…let’s wait to talk about it. One problem at a time, okay? Or should I say ‘eh’?” He laughed weakly, sounding more defeated than anything else, not sure how much more he could take. If that plane wasn’t ready to go and compliant with his wishes, he was going to have to start taking people out.
“I think you’re going to have to find a way,” Rhodey turned his body more to face Tony, keeping a comforting hand on his shoulder. “You’re not going to be happy if you lose one of them, are you? Maybe by telling them this, one will walk away anyway, and you’ll know it wasn’t meant to be.”
“Kirk is my favourite too, him and Bones,” Steve said, getting more and more worried by Bucky’s behaviour as he spread the cards out again. “Going to choose a huge number for me this time?”
Tony had hoped that line would garner applause, and he was relieved when it did. He felt like he was starting to get the hang of this, he wondered why he’d been so scared to talk to them. They were perfectly fine when they were drunk, fed, and entertained.
And suddenly it did, and he didn’t know what to do with himself.
“Gods fucking damn it,” Bucky grumbled, pulling his hand back from his erect dick, rolling over so it was pinned between him and the bed, hoping the pressure would make him feel a bit better. Every time he moved, however, it just felt more sensitive, and his fingers twitched to wrap around it. He wished he’d asked Tony about this, he was going to be so angry if it was okay.
“Come in,” Stane said in a cheerful voice, hoping that his guest had finally arrived. As the door opened, he was disappointed to only see one of the men who worked for him. His tone quickly changed. “What do you want? I’m a busy man.”
“It felt like…like everything in my life changed in a moment,” Bucky said, his hand gripping his thigh as the familiar ache gnawed at his heart. “I couldn’t be a soldier like we planned, I couldn’t even be a good apprentice anywhere, everything took two hands. So now I herd goats and steal from people who can work.”
~~~~~~~~
“Do you want us to take a picture of you with them?” Tony offered, reaching into his pocket for his phone and turning the camera on.
“It’s fine. Both of you, please relax, that’s why I gave you the whiskey,” Tony said, wondering if he should give them more. He was pretty sure Bucky was already drunk though, he looked like he was swaying on his feet a bit. “Why don’t we have a seat? Make things a little more informal.”
“You got us, baby,” Tony said, bringing Bucky’s knuckles up to his lip. “Think we came up with that one the first night we were together.”
“Do you have a favourite character?” Steve asked, very aware of how upset Bucky was, wishing he’d taken psychology in school instead of art. Bucky didn’t seem to want to talk, and he was pretty sure he shouldn’t push him.
“Wow…” Steve whispered, leaning his head back to see as they walked up the aisle, going around the stage to a door hidden behind it. “It’s beautiful in there. Did you see, Bucky?”
“Because you don’t try, Anthony!” Stane finally snapped, his hand settled on his head as he tried to slow his heart and temper. “You treat this kingdom as your playground, and you need to stop. You’re not a child any longer, you have responsibilities and you must see them through. Do you think your father behaved like this when he was King? You may be too young to remember, but-“
“And what does Bucky want??” Tony yelled back at him, burying his face in his hands as panic tore through his body. “I’m going to be fucking sick…"
