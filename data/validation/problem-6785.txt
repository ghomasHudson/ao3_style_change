peter kind of figured he would get put with ned and mj, because of what tony had told him when he signed peter's permission slip. he, ned and mj didn't have to move as vincent and wade moved over to where they sat.
“of course not! the labs were looking for an intern and i simply sent in your resume for you,” peter explained, and mj hugged him tightly. “thank you, peter. it means a lot.”
"that's exciting. problem is, everyone will know you're gone," mj replied, still doing her push-up test. "yeah... i mean, you could have mr. stark make this big thing for you so you can leave," ned suggested, marking down every push up she did. "dad's going to be leading the tour. i'll figure out a way, even if him taking me out is far and few between. i made plans with him tonight and obviously i can't go."
that night, when peter arrived home from school, he was met with natasha and bucky making dinner, bruce and tony watching how it's made reruns, and clint and steve discussing who would win in a fight- bugs bunny or sheen estevez, neither of which steve probably knew about all too well.
"so, how did it feel to be frozen for 70 years?" flash asked, smug. "i wasn't frozen," bucky deadpanned. "oh, sorry, killing people," flash clarified, a shit eating grin on his face.
"so we just sit here for the next few hours? what are we going to do?" bucky asked, his arms flailing up as he turned around, but he crossed them.
"are there any other questions?" tony asked, and it was dead silent. "okay, then. time to hand it over to your principal! see you tomorrow morning, future!" he exclaimed, guiding peter in to the actual compound.
it was all mundane to peter who dragged himself all the way to his room and flipped on to his bed. he screamed into his pillow before someone called his name from downstairs. "coming!" he shouted, sliding off his shoes, changing into pajama pants, and grabbing his permission slip out of his book bag.
"of course not! and just so you know, if he hurts you, he'll have a lot of enemies," tony warned, making peter laugh. "i don't think he's going to hurt me, dad, but thank you."
the end of the school day couldn't come soon enough, even if peter was going back to his delusional family. he still loved them, after all, and he appreciated that they all opened their home up to a bunch of seniors for a weekend expo.
when peter got home from school, he threw his book bag down by the gym door and started to rummage for a snack. he was so hungry and determined he didn't notice bucky come in from the gym, shirtless and sweaty.
"woah, woah, woah. i will never willingly give you up, peter parker. you're the best person in the world. you're kind, you're sweet, you're extremely intelligent, you're beautiful, and yes, you may have intrusive thoughts, but i will always love you, okay?"
"no, no, i'll answer. it wasn't hard to adjust. i lived in an lgbt community. it's not really a new concept, some people are just really, really awful to others," bucky said, putting emphasis on the last part as he stared flash down. sam started snickering, and flash blushed deeply.
"do you know how weird it is to hear you say dad? i never expected to have kids," tony thought out loud. peter smiled, making tony his own serving. "i hope i'm what you wanted," he joked, switching the plates out as he began eating. "oh, you're everything, and more, peter. honestly- you're the best thing that's ever happened to me. i don't know what i would do without you."
"okay, tour's over. my room, now," peter said, picking up their book bags and marched right past them in the hall. his room was up a set of stairs all the way at the end of the hallway.
sam came out of the lab and in to the lobby, groaning, thinking there was another group until he saw peter and mj. "hey, cool girl! you're the best," sam said, stretching his hand out for a fist bump. "mj," she said, introducing herself. "sam," he replied, impressed. "told you i was his fucking favorite."
"i think you should kiss tony," steve said in a flat voice. "i shoul- what? you want me to kiss your boyfriend?" bucky exclaimed.
“good morning, everyone. i’m maria hill, this is phil coulson, and this is thor, god of thunder,” she announced, waving to everyone. she pressed the clicker in her hand in the direction of the power point behind her. “today we’ll be talking about careers in domestic and international security, and how you can get involved today.”
"no, no, what? you kissed james buchanan barnes? the winter soldier? are you crazy?" mj asked, and peter laughed. "bucky barnes is not the winter soldier, first of all. that was his body, but not his brain. second of all, he's an amazing, sweet guy and yes, i did kiss him. twice," he said, finishing his breakfast before crinkling up the wrapper to throw it back in the bag.
"hey, peter," bucky groaned, putting his head on to peter's toned chest. "mornin' buck. how'd you sleep?" peter asked, combing back bucky's stray hairs. "this is the best i've slept in months, doll."
his project was about the inequality of lgbt people during ww2, and even though he went to a somewhat welcoming school, some of the kids in his class were definitely not going to like his presentation.
about 15 minutes later, they pulled up to midtown high. "thanks again, happy," peter smiled, stepping out of the tesla. people started to mumble and whisper, pointing at the car and 'the big dude (how the hell does peter know that guy?)' driving it. peter saluted to happy, who sped off as he strode inside.
"i could say the same about you two," peter said, adjusting in his seat. ned and mj went bright red as they shook their heads. "jesus fuck, lighten up you guys. i don't care if you have or not," peter laughed, turning forward as soon as their teacher walked in and called for quiet attention.
"no thanks, friday. just here for my field trip," he cut her off, worried she would out him as tony's son. "no need to be rude, peter. i'll send you to bruce."
"oh, definitely. but wouldn't he be doing things to you? like taking you in an elevator while i watch? wouldn't you make me happy?" steve replied, rocking his hips up into bucky's again.
"i go by flash," he growled out, getting up to move with his group. lillian reached over to pat his shoulder. "it's okay, eugene," she smiled, sitting back down. he yelled in frustration.
tony stepped away from the mic, watching as the teens jumped to hug each other, tears streaming down their faces as they shouted their victories. tony smiled into the crowd, and peter was extremely proud of him. he usually was generous, but peter knew that he was doing this in a humongous gesture to peter that he was proud of him and he loved him.
he especially hated it when he got a field trip form sent home with him for a trip to his own goddamned house- the avengers compound in upstate new york. the whole of his school's science academy would be going for a weekend to see the stark labs, have discussions with bruce banner and tony stark, and sit in at unimportant company meetings as sub-interns. they would also be staying in the hotel-like residential area of the compound with full catering from a private company, all expenses paid as per stark industries.
the first module was very uneventful, which was good, because the second one was anything but. the panel was bucky, steve, and sam, simply to provide knowledge about what the teens could with technology for the military. in fact, there was a military recruitment area set up in the back of the room.
steve backed up, pushing himself against the wall dramatically, thrusting up into his own hand. "have fun," he said, biting his lip. tony resumed what he started, only to be pulled up by his hair.
peter woke up the next morning in the arms of his... boyfriend?... which was weird, because the last thing he remembered was a very harsh kiss up against his bedroom door before bucky opened it to pull peter in so he could kiss him deeper and harder.
"i don't know about you, but i liked it," bucky shrugged. peter smiled at the ground, and then up at bucky. "yeah, i really liked it," he said biting his lip. bucky leaned in slowly, but this time, peter didn't wait. he put his hands in bucky's hair and pulled him in to a searing hot kiss.
and then he was gone. peter sat back down on his bed, head in his hands. bucky was laughing his ass off. “i’ll never live this down. they will never let me live this down,” peter said to himself, standing back up and hurriedly gathered his clothes again.
"my life is going to be awful now," peter groaned, making his way through the lab monitoring hallways behind tony. "i thought i made it better! no more teasing!" he said, typing in a secret code to unlock a door that opened in to their living room. "no, but they're going to try and be my friend so they can meet all of the avengers. no offense, but you know you're a bunch of showy whores, right?"
sure enough, tony came strolling out of the building. everyone applauded, and he bowed, which peter laughed at.
“i really want to text bucky right now," he huffed, putting his head on the table. "why can't you?" ned asked, sharing his food with mj. "well, if i tell him anything's wrong, he'll come up and pull me out of school and make me tell him everything. if i text him and say i just want to talk, he'll let me finish school and when i get home he'll make me tell him everything," peter mumbled angrily.
"if you put this off any longer, i'm going to scream. fuck. me," tony said, wrapping his arms around bucky's neck, bringing him down for a kiss.
"it's okay, i have a tracker on his phone," peter said, fumbling with the find my friends app on his phone. he had every avenger's name and location up there, along with mj, ned, and pepper. "he's out at the bejing office. i think there's a really big meeting thing there today with a contract to build another weaponry in shanghai. is there anything you need me to tell him? i can send an urgent message to him if you need me to?"
he started to move his boxes downstairs as per his web shooters, when all of the sudden he felt a weight fall through his throat and settle in to his stomach. he had a sudden realization that most relationships don't last through college or even make it untill then. him and bucky were going to break up.
Tony and Steve sat up on the bed and smiled at their boys. Oh how they were so lucky to have such amazing and wonderful kids in their life.
Steve turned on the vibrator and put it against his son’s clit, pushing at the nub. He gently moved the vibrator up and down Peter’s lips, making sure to go a bit deeper and push harder into his hole.
“Yeah, Li’s right. You’ve done more for us than our biological parents did. You gave us a home, you gave us food and clothes, you gave us anything that we asked for but mostly importantly you showed us how much you loved and cared for us from all your small gestures. You and papa both showed us how much we mean to you and that you’ll always be here for us, but we also want you to know that we’ll always be here for you too no matter what. We love you and we’ll always love you for who you are.” Peter said.
He finally came to the conclusion after waiting for an hour and half, that Ryan wasn’t going to come. That he never wanted this in the first place and that he wasn’t important to Ryan anymore. He grabbed his phone, paid for his drink and made his way outside of the restaurant, catching the sad glance that Lia shot him as if she had figured out what was going on. Peter then dialed Steve’s number and waited for his papa to pick up.
“His classmates and then when he told his teacher about them, his teacher told him to man up.” Tony said as anger bubbled again inside of him.
“Kiddo, it’s just gonna be a pinch. And then afterwards when you’re done, we can all go for ice cream. How does that sound?” Tony said.
Tony did just that, letting his son’s voice calm him down. Footsteps were heard coming down the stairs but Liam didn’t pay them any attention. He kept his focus on Tony as he helped him come down from the panic attack that he was experiencing, letting his voice soothe his dad the best way it could. Tony let out a harsh breath, willing himself to calm down. He closed his eyes tightly and felt arms loop around him while the ones that were holding his hands tightened their grip even more. He tried his best to get his breathing to labor down and kept his eyes shut until he knew it was over. The tightness in his chest disappeared, his heart rate calmed down, his hands weren’t shaking as badly anymore and his breathing was back to normal. He opened his eyes and looked in front to see who it was and saw Liam’s worrying eyes looking at him. He turned his head to see who was around him and was also met by the worrying stares of Steve, Peter and Damian.
He sat down through the lessons, focusing on what his teachers where saying. His thoughts were running wild and he was trying to think what he could have done for them to treat him like this but nothing came into his mind. Damian knew that he never bothered anyone, that he never even talked to anyone because everyone either hated him or ignored him. He never understood what the reason was but he didn’t care. He didn’t want to be friends with these lowlifes anyway.
Peter whined at the sound of his dad’s voice. “Dad? Dad? Are you okay? Where are you? You’re hurt. I’m gonna come save you.” Peter said as he frantically got up.
Damian’s eyes filled with tears and he rapidly shook his head fast. He didn’t want it. He didn’t want the needle anywhere near him. Steve turned to the doctor and gave him a apologetic smile and started to apologize but was cut off by the doctor saying that it was okay and that he understood. He had many patients, both older and younger, who were also afraid and he didn’t mind if he had to wait while they calmed them down.
Peter got to the board and started to work out the problem. His head was pounding but he tried to take his mind off of that and focused on completing the problem. When he was done, he looked over at his teacher to see if the answer was right.
Peter shook his head no and then proceeded to pull out his phone so that he could show them the texts that Ryan had sent him. When he got out his phone out, he saw that he had gotten another text from him and he opened it. What he read broke his heart even more and he bit his lips to keep himself from sobbing out.
“I beg to differ.” Steve said walking out of the kitchen and coming towards them, placing a tray of snacks on the table in front.
Tony let out a laugh, scooping his son up from Liam’s arms into his own as he tickled his cheek. Damian giggled as his dad tickled him and the rest of them burst out in laughter too.
“See kiddos. It wasn’t that bad. Thank you Doctor.” Steve said as he shook hands with him, Tony doing the same after.
“I do to Bucky, trust me I wanna do the most painful things to him but let’s not talk about this here.” Tony said.
“Hey bubba, you’re home early.” Steve turned around and looped his arms around Liam. Liam snuggled into his papa’s hold and tried his best to keep the tears from falling.
Steve and Tony eyed Peter carefully before making eye contact and then nodding. They both gave him a smile and Steve placed a plate of pancakes in front of both of them and went back into the kitchen to grab his plate.
“Good boy Pete. Such a perfect good boy for us.” Steve said as he grabbed the vibrator from the side draw.
Liam was nervous. To put it as simple as possible he was nervous. He had been applying to colleges like crazy, wondering if he would finally be accepted into his top one and today was the day he was going to find out. He really wanted to go to Stanford and he knew he had worked really hard to get where he wanted to be at and he really hoped that he had done enough to get there. His brother, Peter had already been accepted into M.I.T and he was really happy for him. He just didn’t want to disappoint his parents or his siblings because he’d be a poor excuse of an older child if he failed them all.
Bruce sat down on the bed to check Peter over. He took his temperature which read out to be 102 which wasn’t so bad but still high. Bruce checked Peter over before prescribing him medicine.
Tony was in his lab, working on fixing the coffee machine that Clint had broken accidentally, when his phone rang. He went over to answer it.
Damian nodded his head and leaned against the window, looking out at the scenery that was passing him. They got home 15 minutes later and Tony led Damian towards the lab.
He got up and made his way towards the table. He didn’t care if he was about to make a scene but he wanted answers. He wanted to know why the hell was his boyfriend was doing this. He reached the table and stared at the two.
Seeing that he wasn’t going to win this fight, he stuck his tongue out at his brothers and cuddled deeper into his dad’s chest, wincing a bit when he put pressure on his broken nose while his brothers laughed at his actions.
“What do you, what do you mean he’s in trouble dad? What’s wrong?” Peter asked as his voice quivered.
“But wouldn’t you want your child to get into top colleges? I mean dad went to M.I.T and now Peter’s going there as well and maybe Damian will go to some top college as well. What if I’m the only one who doesn’t get in somewhere? What if I fail you? What if I can’t do anything and I end up wasting your money?” Liam said in a hurry.
“Of course buddy. I’m not going to make you go to a school where you’re being bullied and the teachers-“ Tony started to say before he was cut off by a voice.
“Of course baby. You are a good boy and you’ll be good for your brothers yeah?” Tony said, pressing a kiss to his head.
The coach nodded and let the class go and Damian made his way to the basketball hoops. He grabbed a ball and went to the furthest one away from everyone else. He was minding his own business and ignoring his classmates until a ball came flying out of no where and hit the back of his head. He winced a bit but didn’t pay them much attention.
Steve nodded and gave her a smile and thanking Mr. Jones before scooping up his son and walking out of the nurse office. Him and Tony both signed Peter out before headed towards the car. They laid him down in the back while Steve got in the driving seat and began to drive home.
“We know, we know, but we’re still going to spoil you nonetheless. You deserve it.” Steve said handing him the box.
Tony shook his head. God he felt so pathetic for the way he was acting and the fact that he had made them worry so much over him, he felt like he was the worst person ever.
Tony laughed before scooping his son up and putting him on his hip. “Alright munchkin. Let’s go. We’ll be right back Steve.”
“Yeah bud, it was. Did any one of them hurt you kiddo?” Steve asked as he brought his hand to Peter’s back and rubbed it gently.
“One second, I’ll be right back.” Peter yelled. Peter ran to his room and went to go grab his favorite stuffed animal that he had ever since he was little.
Tony and Steve both made eye contact with each other and communicated with their eyes. Something wasn’t right.
Tony chuckled at his oldest son’s behavior and said, “sure but then there won’t be any hot water left when you go take a shower.”
“I always get up this early to go for my run. What are you doing up so early bud? You still have two hours till school starts.” Steve asked.
Steve still hadn’t said a word and the kidnapper was getting furious. He cutoff the machine and then went towards him while grabbing a scalpel from the table.
Tony put his mug down and wrapped an arm around Liam and his son leaned in and whispered in his ear. Tony’s hold on him tightened as Liam spoke the words.
Bruce smiled sympathetically. He understood those situations. He’d been bullied when he was a kid as well so he definitely understood what it felt like being treated that way. He continued to poke around and feel before prescribing some medication.
“Ned, I’m gonna need your help to carry him to the nurses office. Someone else call the nurse and say that Mr. Jones is bringing in a student who has just fainted.” Mr. Jones said.
He let out a sigh and made his way to the locker room to change. He quietly made his way to his locker and began to change his clothes, hoping and praying that none of the older kids saw or paid attention to him.
“Steve, Steve, babe, wake up love. It’s just a bad dream Steve. It’s just a bad dream. You’re okay.” Tony said gently while running a hand through his hair.
Tony leaned over to ruffle his son’s hair and they got situated into bed. They all cuddled each other close while Tony ran a hand through Steve’s hair gently. Soon they all fell asleep and Steve didn’t have anymore nightmares during the night. He knew that no matter what his family would be there for him whenever he needed them no matter how bad the situation would be. His family would always have his back.
“Well don’t let me stop you then bud. Go ahead and open it.” Tony said giving his son a gentle smile to ease his nerves.
Tony and the team were looking for Steve everywhere. They checked all the places that they could think of where Steve could be. Tony had tried tracking down from where the video call could have came from but he wasn’t able to pinpoint the location. So they had decided to spilt up and search for Steve wherever they thought he could be at.
Peter waited for 10 minutes, glancing every so minute at the door to see when Ryan would arrive. When he finally saw his boyfriend walk in the door, he was about to gesture him towards where he was at when he saw Ryan pull a girl towards him and ask for a table of two. Peter felt confused for a minute until he saw the waitress bring them to a table, which was a couple of seats away from his and they both sat down. He then saw Ryan grab the girl’s face in his hand and gave her a kiss on the lips.
“It wasn’t that bad when I woke up this morning so I didn’t think it was necessary to tell you.” Peter said as he looked down at his hands.
“Hey, hey Steve, babe listen. Listen to me love. You’re okay, you’re safe now. You’re home, in our bed, in our room with me and Peter right here with you. Breathe for me babe, breathe.” Tony said as he gently consoled Steve and tried to get him to calm down.
It was days like today that Tony really hated. Days like this one where he let his dark thoughts consume him. Where he would hide himself in the lab for hours, not caring about anyone or himself while he drowned himself in thoughts of work and worried if he was truly loved and wanted by his family and whether they truly needed him or not. He always thought about the moment they would realize he’s never done enough for them. The day they would realize that he wasn’t worth anything. The day they would realize that their lives would be truly better off without them. He hated thinking like this, he really did but he was just so insecure. He always tried his best to show his kids that he was there for them. He didn’t want to turn out like his father. The man was always so cold towards. Always ignored him unless it was to punish him or yell at him for being a disgrace to his family’s name. He was thankful for the few people that he had in his life but what if he was never enough for them? What if they realize that they didn’t want to waste their time with his pathetic self anymore? Tony let his thoughts run wild, his breath hitched and his breathing quickened and before he could stop himself he was going into panic mode and the dark thoughts in his brain wouldn’t stop.
After everyone left, Steve had already fallen asleep with Peter cuddled on his right side. Tony turned off the lights before climbing into bed and putting an arm around both Steve and Peter. Peter had his arm around Steve’s chest. Tony planted a kiss on both of their heads before pulling up the covers and falling asleep.
“I applied to a lot of them but Stanford was my top choice and the decision’s in this letter.” Liam said.
He shook his head, clearing out the thoughts before burying his face in his dad’s chest and enjoying the moment that they were sharing. They pulled away a couple of minutes later, knowing that if they stayed too long that Tony would miss his flight, which they didn’t want to happen.
“He fell asleep. His fever feels about the same so I’m not sure if the fever reducers that the nurse gave him are strong enough.” Steve said.
Just when Steve was finishing to make sure that Peter felt comfortable and that the binding wasn’t too tight, Tony stepped out of the bathroom, looking a bit more relaxed and less tense. He made his way towards the bed where his son and husband were and got under the covers.
“Scan complete Captain. Young sir has a fracture which would require a cast. I have already alerted Dr. Banner about the situation and he’ll be waiting for your arrival.” Jarvis said.
Steve chuckled again, ruffled his son’s hair and made his way towards the door while he let his son get ready. Damian made his way to the bathroom and jumped in the shower. He spent 10 minutes in there before getting out, drying himself off and making his way to his room. He put on his clothes, grabbed his book bag and made his way downstairs to the kitchen table.
Peter and Damian changed their clothes and started on their homework. Damian was half way into his homework when he had an idea. He got up from his desk and made his way to Peter’s room. He knocked on the door and waited for his brother to answer. Peter opened the door to see his younger brother standing there.
“Hey now, listen okay. No one is going to leave you babe. Not me, not Liam, not Peter, not Damian, none of us are leaving you whatsoever. You haven’t failed us at all. You haven’t disappointed us either. You have done none of that. We love you and we’ll always love you.” Steve said.
Peter was in the living room when he heard his brother’s yell in the kitchen. He quickly got up and ran to the kitchen and examined what had happened and made his way over to where Liam was with a worried look on his face.
Peter quickly undressed himself, climbed onto the bed and spread his legs out for his parents. Steve and Tony moaned when they saw just how wet Peter was, his hole and thighs glistening with his juices. They both undressed themselves before getting on the bed and coming face to face with Peter’s deliciously wet hole.
“But it’s a needle and it’s pointy and it’s gonna, it’s gonna-,” Peter said before he was cut off by Steve’s gentle voice.
Liam sighed, feeling guilty about the fact that he had practically ruined his father’s run. Steve carried Liam home, making sure to be careful so that he wouldn’t aggravate the injury even more. Once they arrived, Steve set Liam on the couch and asked for Jarvis to scan him.
Once Steve and Tony finished tidying up the kitchen, they made some hot chocolate and then made their way to the living room to see all three of their kids spread out on the floor while they colored. They smiled at the scene and sat down on the couch, handing out the mugs. Once everyone had their cup, Steve and Tony snuggled into the couch as they watched the show playing. While Liam colored he felt a shiver go through his body and he took a breath. It didn’t go unnoticed by his parents.
“Listen buddy. None of that is going to happen. We don’t expect you to get into a top college kiddo. You can go to any college that you want. You don’t have to focus on the top colleges or the ones that are well known. Again there are thousands of colleges out there and I’m sure that you can get into hundreds of them. You don’t have to get into a top college to show how smart you are. I know how smart you are. Papa knows how smart you are. Peter and Damian know how smart you are. Heck even your uncles and aunts know how smart you are. You just have to have some faith in yourself bud.” Tony said.
Steve looked over at his husband and smiled. He knew how much his son enjoyed drawing and how it was always something that made him happy. And the fact that Tony had gotten him something that he could enjoy even when he was just sitting around while he healed made him smile even more.
Dr. Richards quickly swabbed the other arm, before injecting the needle carefully and pulling it out when he was done. He put a band-aid on top and then it was over.
Ned looked up to see his best friend coming towards his seat and gave him a small smile. Peter smiled back despite the pounding in his head.
Peter glared at his dad and mumbled out a good morning as he got out of bed and picked up his clothes. Tony chuckled, ruffled his son’s hair and left the room while Peter headed to the bathroom to get ready. Tony checked his watch and was relieved to find that he still had time before his youngest woke up.
“Thanks dads.” He let a few tears slip and wiped them away. His dads hugged him tightly, kissing his head and soothingly rubbing his back.
“I, wow Pete. This is truly so beautiful kiddo. We love it so much. Thanks bud.” Tony said as Steve pulled his son into a hug and ruffled his hair.
Steve and Tony had decided that they would send Peter out with Liam while they rest of them set up and get the decorations ready. Liam offered to take Damian as well so that his parents could work without having to worry about watching his baby brother.
“Yeah babe, it’s me and Peter’s here too and everyone else is taking care of that son of a bitch.” Tony said.
“Dad, dad, no, no. You gotta wake up.” Peter said as he crouched down to where Tony’s body laid on the ground, bruised and battered.
Damian shrugged, keeping his face hidden into his papa’s chest as he allowed more of the comfort. Everyone agreed to it and Liam ended up picking out Home Alone, knowing that it would cheer his baby brother up.
Tony and Steve’s face softened. They sat down on each side of him and gently started to comfort their son.
Tony’s feeling insecure. Luckily he has his family to tell him that he’s forever loved and that they’ll never leave him.
Damian looked up at his dad with teary eyes and nodded. He bit his lip and looked back at the doctor who had a gentle smile on his face.
Steve let a few tears fall from his eyes as he listened to his husband. He quickly wiped them off and Tony pulled him into a hug all while whispering reassurances to him.
“Tony, hey I was just waiting for you. What’s wrong?” Bruce said as he grabbed his medical kit and followed his best friend out and up to their room.
Damian pouted but snuggled into Liam’s chest. Liam chuckled at his little brother’s behavior and ran a hand through his hair. Peter was about to speak up but was cut off when their dad entered the room.
They all burst out in laughter. Tony wiped his eyes and chuckled. Maybe they did love him just as much as he loved them. Maybe he wasn’t as much of a burden as he thought he was to them. Atleast he knew he was loved by the people that he loved the most and that they weren’t afraid to show him how much they loved him.
“Steve I’ll be there in 30 minutes. Hey bud,  I’m okay yeah. I’m perfectly fine, I promise. I’m coming home okay kiddo. I’ll be home before you know it.” Tony said.
“Li, you don’t have to apologize for this. Accidents happen and that’s okay. We can always order take out. It’s nothing to worry about. You didn’t ruin anything.” Peter said as he applied the cream to Liam’s hand.
The cafeteria went silent and he could feel all eyes on him before everyone started to laugh. He bit his lip from crying out and quickly got up.
Tony grinned back at him and they pulled up to the restaurant. Peter got out of the car and walked his way to the entrance. Tony asked him if he should stay until his date arrived but Peter nodded his head no, saying that he was okay and that he could wait a bit until Ryan came.
Tony twisted the door knob and they entered Liam’s room. Their son was laying down on his bed with his back turned towards the door, snuggled under the blankets. Making their way to his bed, they both sat down.
“I have two students who got in a fight. I’m not sure who started it, but my students said that they saw Damian start it, so I brought them here.” Coach Wilson said.
Peter let out a huff and sat up on his bed, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes, yawning and stretching.
“The only thing that I can tell is that he has a fever. We will have to wait for him to wake up for him to tell us what else hurts.” Ms. Lee said.
Tony and Steve soon followed and from that day on everyone knew to never mess with Steve Rogers or his family because it will never end well for them. He could destroy you just from his verbal threats but will gladly throw punches if necessary.
So for this prompt the stories will be centered around the superfamily but what I have done is I’ve added two more characters to the family who were also adopted by Steve and Tony. Even though it is centered around them, you can add other MCU characters to the prompt if you would like but they won’t be the main center of focus.
She got off of his lap, sitting beside him and used her hand to cup the outside of his cock and rubbed it. She pressed her fingers at his tip as she kissed his cheek. Liam squirmed, grabbing her hand and stopping her.
Tony smiled at Steve and leaned forward, pecking him on the lips before saying, “and me and Petey will protect you love.”
“Pete, what’s wrong bud? Why are you crying? Did something happen kiddo? Are you hurt?” Tony asked worriedly as he heard Peter’s sob.
“So good for us sweetie. You’re so beautiful for us. Cum for us some more sweetheart. Keep going.” They said as Peter’s hole kept gushing.
He let out a sigh, snuggling into his papa’s shoulder. Steve chuckled at his baby boy’s behavior and rubbed his hand up and down his back, making his way towards where Peter and Liam were.
Peter nodded his head, put the marker back down and started walking towards his seat. He was almost there when he suddenly got dizzy and before he knew it the whole room was spinning and he was falling.
Dr. Richards performed the same procedures that he did on Liam with Damian. He took his height, weight, checked his heart rate, eyes, ears, mouth and asked him the same questions. Once Damian was done, Peter stood up and made his way to where the doctor was and the procedure repeated again. Once Dr. Richards was done, he let them know that everything was good.
“Listen. We’re not mad at you. We’re not upset with you. You haven’t disappointed us nor have you let us down. And it’s okay if you didn’t get in. It’s not the end of the world bud. You have numerous other colleges that you can get into and we’ll still be proud of you.” Steve said.
Liam gave them all smiles and that’s how he spent the rest of the day. He showed them his drawings, set up his new phone, they ate dinner and then finally cuddled up on the couch to watch a movie. Liam sighed in content. Even though he was bed ridden for a couple of weeks, he knew that his family would always be there to make sure that he wouldn’t feel lonely at all and he loved them for that.
Steve and Tony chuckled at their sons behavior. Sometimes it was hard to believe that one was an adult and the other was almost one.
Steve didn’t say anything and his kidnapper was furious and continued to torture him and all Steve could do was sob and scream for him to stop.
Peter was almost ready for his date that night. Him and Ryan had decided that they would meet up at the restaurant as they usually did for most of their dates. It was their thing basically. Going out to eat once a week and then going to the movies on the weekends. Everything was perfect in their relationship. They both made each other feel content and they deeply loved each other.
Steve knew something was wrong but he decided that the questioning could wait. Peter heard some clattering going on in the background and then heard his papa’s voice again.
“I’m bored baby. How about we do something a bit more fun?” She smirked at him while continuing her grinding and kissing his lips.
Meanwhile Steve and Tony were in the kitchen, preparing their son his favorite meal along with ice cream and cookies that were also his favorite.
Tony just shook his head and pulled Steve into a hug and right then Peter walked in with Bruce. When they entered Peter ran straight to Steve’s side. “Are you okay papa?”
“W-we should go search for him, r-right. I-I m-mean what if h-he’s in t-trouble and h-he can’t get out?” Peter said as tears streamed down his face.
“Toni Stark,” the pretty news anchor said before she continued to ramble on in her native language.  A stock photo of the Compound appeared in the top corner as she continued to talk before it was replaced with what looked to be live footage from a conference room.  The Avengers symbol was on the podium placed at the front, where Pepper was trying field questions that the station was airing.
Over the past few months, all of this had rather become the normal for all of them: rundown hotel rooms and bad coffee and television and radio shows that most of them couldn't understand, this was their life now.  It was hard and by far wasn't fun, but it was nothing new to Steve.  He'd spent so much time at war that this almost felt more real to him than anything.  Living in one place with people that were like a family, eating what and how much you wanted without having to worry with rations, sleeping in a nice bed with a girl you – well, that was the fantasy.  Running, hiding, helping people – that was reality.  Steve had only just forgotten for awhile.
Then Pepper, ever unflappable Pepper, paused to clear her throat and shifted uneasily on her feet.  That...that wasn't a good sign.
Then, just as suddenly as it all started, it stopped.  No one really noticed at first because Toni holding herself up in the Compound for awhile wasn't anything new.  But then a few months went by and no one had seen her.  Not Toni Stark, anyway.  She wasn't going out any more, not to parties or charity events or anything like that.  There hadn't even been any announcements from SI that Pepper hadn't fielded for awhile.  Rhodey at some point had become the unofficial spokesperson for the Avengers press conferences and the work with the UN.  It was like Toni had just...disappeared.
Before what had happened really began to sink in, Toni heard the door behind her open.  There was a loud mummer of reporters chatting loudly echoing from inside, as well as a few flashes of cameras.  There wasn't anyone out there yet except for Pepper, who had been stalling for the past few minutes while Toni talked to Peter, so Toni figured that they were trying to catch a picture from over Pepper's shoulder of what was waiting in the hall.  Thankfully, Toni was standing at too sharp of an angle for them to have caught her in any of them, and Pepper was already shutting the door before Toni had a chance to move.
"i need someone to sign my permission slip for a trip to the compound, but since tony can't do it, can you?" peter asked sweetly. he went to grab it and a pen slowly. "do i have to?" happy whined. "yes please," peter smiled, handing over the stuff he reached for. "you're lucky you're tony's kid," happy grumbled.
“i can’t believe that this weekend even happened,” mj stated, shaking her head. her and ned were in the seat across from peter. “i mean honestly, i’ll earn all my money at the internship and i won’t even have to pay for school. what more could i ask for?”
“why are you smiling so big?” vincent asked, he himself smiling. “just thinking about some things. ya know, happy shit,” peter blushed awkwardly. vincent laughed, nodding. “yeah, i really do know,” he said, turning his attention back to the teachers.
"that's impressive," a girl said, sitting down in front of peter. she was very obviously pushing up her cleavage and touching his arm a lot, and he leaned in to her touches. ned and mj both put a leg across him. "he's closed for business," ned said. "you were too late. bye hunny," mj fake-smiled, waving to the girl, who walked off with a scoff.
peter jumped on to the ceiling, but slowly lowered himself when he saw fury. the man was intimidating, and peter had only met him twice before. the impression he was making was not a good one.
after they got to the school, everyone said their goodbyes and rushed to their cars, eager to get home and tell their parents about the weekend.
"well his boyfriend wants you to, too," tony mumbled, scratching his thigh and avoiding eye contact. "doll-," bucky mumbled, and he walked up directly in front of tony. he sat down, trying to calm himself.
"are you fucking serious? if you sign, everyone will know you're my legal guardian! if you don't sign, they'll make me seem like i have been lying about the stupid stark internship thing! and, if they catch me, i'm fucked!" he exclaimed, trying to gain traction with what he could see happening. "peter's right, but you have no other choice,
tony and bucky sat on either side of peter, both loudly bragging about the new m.i.t. student. steve was holding hands with tony on top of the table, having his own conversation with sam and nat. bruce and thor were leaning in to each other, smiling more and lingering their touches. everything was right with the world.
module three was quantum physics with dr.s hope van dyne and hank pym, and their "test dummy", scott lang. peter really missed them, as he barely got to see his estranged family (affectionately dubbed auntie hope, uncle scotty, and poppa hank, of course) and was really excited for this module, as he really needed to brush up on this subject and there were no better teachers than these three.
peter slowly made his way to his room, not noticing that bucky had followed. when he tried to shut his door behind him, bucky caught it, scaring peter, who jumped onto his wall.
bucky moved fast, shifting tony's legs to around his waist. "yes sir," the soldier said, smiling. he lined himself with tony, ready to push in. "anger really does bottle up when you're angry, i guess," he said again. tony immediately went to defend himself, but before he could speak, bucky bottomed out.
"you didn't tell me the twice part!" ned said, and peter just sipped the coffee. "are you a thing now?" mj asked. "no. actually, after i kissed him, i ran. tony told me that i should go for him, though."
"i need you to understand something, peter. i don't want anyone but you. if i wanted nat or clint, i would've asked out nat or clint. if i loved them, i would've been telling them that. but i come home to you, i want you, and i love you, peter stark. i won't ever leave you, and i hope you never leave me."
"hey, baby," peter heard, feeling bucky's metal arm slide down and mess with his hair. "why are you still up?" he asked, kissing peter's head. "the teacher. is he gone?" peter asked stiffly, unmoving.
peter kissed back, but the pit in his stomach stayed for a different reason. peter pulled away slowly. "i didn't tell them yet," he whispered in to bucky's ear. "fuck, i'm sorry. i thought that was why you were here?" bucky replied. peter just laughed, moving to stand with the group.
"so angry. i think it bottles up faster when you're short," bucky teased light heartedly. tony frowned, causing the two soldiers to laugh.
"yes, sir. recorded it, as well, per mr. stark's request," the ai replied. "well, sorry you had to, uh, see/hear/record that. thanks," steve said, gesturing bucky to step out with tony, and he was going to follow.
steve latched himself onto bucky's neck at about the same time tony started to take his tip into his mouth, and steve had never heard a more deep, pleasured sound. it was really doing things for him, and he hoped it did the same for tony. he really wanted this to happen a lot more.
peter made it back to the dorm on time for him to grab breakfast and be at their last module on time. it was security protocols and technology, funnily enough. the last three module runners were maria, coulson, and thor, who looked very happy with his spot in the middle.
“yeah, thanks man. i’ve got free tuition and a sugar momma,” ned joked, and mj just smiled and kissed him.
Steve laughed a little at their interactions before wincing. Peter looked up at Steve. “Are you sure you’re okay papa?”
Steve gave his son a smile which he returned back before continuing to talk to Peter about some random things. A couple of minutes later Steve, with Tony’s help, brought the dishes over to the table setting them down.
Steve woke up as the sun shined through the windows, hitting his face. He let out a yawn and turned to look at his husband, smiling as he saw just how peaceful he looked. He stretched himself out, letting out another yawn, looked at the time and decided that he should definitely get up. He pressed kisses to Tony’s lips and coaxed him awake.
Once they were done making sure that he was wet and open enough, they took their cock in their hands and aligned them together. Then they eased Peter down until their cocks entered his hole.
Liam shook his head again. “She…she didn’t get any further because I-I ended up kicking her so she would g-get off me.”
Liam hesitated a bit. His hands still felt shaky but maybe coloring could take his mind off of those thoughts. He smiled at his brother and took the book that was offered and Peter made room for Liam to sit down. They colored and watched the show until their papa told them to come sit at the table for dinner.
‘Wait, when did Steve get here?’ Tony thought, before shaking his head and scooping his son up in his arms.
One look at their son’s face and Tony took the phone from his hand while Steve held him close to his chest. Peter continued to cry, his heart hurting even more at the cruel words that Ryan had sent. Tony read over the message that had been sent and his eyes harden. Who the hell was this guy and what even gave him the right to say shit like this. Oh Tony was so going to teach him a lesson but that could wait. His son needed him the most right now and that’s who he needed to focus on.
“I don’t know Tones. It sounded like he was either crying or close to crying. I asked if what was wrong but he kept saying to come pick him up. He said that everything was okay but I don’t think it is.”
Steve, Tony and Peter were out for a walk in the park. They wanted to get some fresh air since they had been inside the whole week due to the fact that Peter had gotten sick. He had been fussy all week, being cooped up in the house and not being able to go outside and have fun. Steve and Tony both had promised their toddler son that once he got better, they would take him out and he could enjoy all that he wanted to.
All three heads snapped at the sound of Steve’s voice and they looked at their papa. Peter paused the movie and looked over to Steve. Damian got up off of the sofa and ran towards Steve. Steve bent down to pick Damian up which let out a squeal from him.
Tony chuckled a bit at their behavior and sat back down on the sofa. Gosh his husband was so stubborn at times. Peter cuddled up on Tony’s left side under his arm while Damian and Liam cuddled up on Tony’s right side. They quietly watched the movie until the food was done and saw it being brought out. Steve, Bucky and Sam placed the trays on the table, handing out the bowls and spoons to everyone. They quietly enjoyed the movie, laughing at some parts while also being intrigued.
Bucky nodded and looked down at his best friend and the state that he was in. It broke his heart to know just how much pain had been inflicted on one of the people that he loved like a brother. He felt like he had failed as a friend to him. Steve was always there for him since the beginning no matter what the situation was and seeing him in such a fragile state made Bucky want to cry. Steve was there for him but he had failed Steve when Steve needed him the most.
Damian and Richard made there way to the principal’s office along with their coach. They entered the room and were greeted by him.
“Jesus Pete, I hope you’re okay.” Ned said as he sat down next to his best friend and held his hand.
“Papa, papa, you’re okay. You gotta wake up papa. You’re not there anymore. You’re with me and dad. It’s okay.” Peter said.
“Can you tell Richard to stop bothering me. I’m just trying to play by myself but he won’t let me and-“ Damian was saying before he got cut off.
The kidnapper wasn’t happy with Steve’s response and had a hard glare on his face. “You wanna play it like that, fine then. We’ll play it like that.”
It had been 10 minutes since he had gotten here and Ryan still wasn’t here. He decided to wait a couple more minutes before texting Ryan to ask where he was at.
“Dad please tell me where you are? Please. Please I need you. Tell me where are you? Please.” Peter said as he cried.
After Tony helped Peter use the restroom, he cleaned him, washed their hands and held Peter’s hand as they walked out. He was almost back to where Steve was waiting for them when suddenly he was surrounded by the flashes of cameras and questions being thrown his direction.
“No worries Mr. Stark Rogers. We’ll be waiting for your arrival.” Mr. Jones said as he said goodbye and hung up.
“Can y-you c-come get m-me first? P-please dad?” Peter said rubbing his eyes furiously to stop himself from crying out fully.
It took Tony 10 minutes to drop Damian off at school. Damian got out the car, said goodbye to his dad and made his way inside the school. He walked his way to his classroom and sat down. Soon other students filled the class and the teacher began her lesson. The classes went by quite fast and then it was lunch time. Damian made his way to the cafeteria with his classmates and got in line for lunch. He grabbed his tray and made his way to a table away from most of his classmates. He knew most of them didn’t like him and thought that he was spoiled just because his parents were well known and rich. He was told often times that he was lying and a pathetic excuse and that no one could love him for who he was. It hurt, of course it did, but Damian was used to the jabs. That’s all he ever heard when he was with his biological parents, but that didn’t mean it hurt less then it already did. He was used to everyone picking on him, getting away with it and calling him an attention seeker.
Damian nodded his head slightly but didn’t meet his dad’s eyes. Tony eyed his son carefully and then asked the next question.
Peter let out a choked sob as he tried to speak. His bottom lip trembled while he tried to calm to himself down.
“Peter stop making a scene. Let’s go outside and talk about this.” Ryan said as he tried to grabbed Peter’s arm.
“Well that’s good. I’m gonna go bring out dinner. Dad and your brothers should be down in a bit.” Steve said.
Tony and Steve laughed at their son’s cheekiness as they looked through the pictures. Each one brought smiles to their faces and their hearts melted when they saw their most precious and special moments. It ranged from the day the got married, to the days they had their date nights, to the day they adopted all three of them and brought them home, to the days they celebrated all their special occasions together. There were little notes written to the side and god were their children trying to make them into an emotional mess or what?
They arrived at the compound and Tony quickly ran to the medical wing with Bruce behind him. When they arrived there, Bruce quickly started to examine the head wound and wrapped it up. He then moved on to stitching Steve’s wounds and cuts. When he was examining his friend’s body he was disgusted to see just how many cuts were along his skin. God what were they trying to do to him. After Bruce patched up all the gashes he left Tony alone with Steve.
They all nodded their heads and then walked their way towards the elevator. Once it got up to their floor, Tony carried Liam towards the couch while Steve grabbed his crutches and sat him down in a comfortable position. Liam was grateful for that action. He wasn’t sure if he could walk at the moment.
When both of them got to where they were, the first thing Steve noticed was Liam’s bandaged hand. He sat down next to his son with Damian on his lap.
Steve grabbed a small vibrator, lubed it up and inserted it into Peter’s asshole. He turned on the vibrations and set it to low getting Peter to moan. They took him by the hips and started to pound into him, chasing their orgasm. Peter had already cum numerous times throughout the wild sex that they were having. They knew that they had overstimulated their son and the wetness of his pussy was also bringing them to their edge.
“It’s not gonna hurt much at all yeah. All it’s gonna be is a pinch and it’ll be over before you know it. You won’t even feel it in a couple of hours.” Tony said.
Just when Steve thought he couldn’t hate the media more, he found another reason. Steve let out an angry puff as his son told him just how harsh they had been. He examined the arm and saw the fingerprints that were left on the skin. He took Peter into his own arms and said, “how about we go home and see if a heating pad will help with that yeah?”
Peter nodded his head and Steve let Tony hold Peter. Steve looped his arm around Tony, keeping him close as he possibly could before they started to walk home.
“Hey, no. There’s nothing to apologize for Tones. Just let it out and then we can talk about it, okay.” Steve said still continuing his motions on his back.
“Hey, Jarvis informed me about the situation, I’m all set so I can check Liam now. I know Jarvis already scanned him, but I’m just gonna scan him again so I can see where exactly the fracture is located.” Bruce said.
Steve and Tony made their way out of the elevator, both letting out a sigh as they were finally home. They made their way inside and were heading towards their bedroom when the sight of their three children on the couch stopped. Examining the situation, they both smiled and walked over as they saw that they were watching a movie.
“I’m taking the suit.” Tony said with a tone that Steve recognized was his tone for that nothing was going to stop him from coming home.
“Oh my fuck, daddy.” Peter sobbed out as he came around his parents cocks, squirting his juices all over their laps.
She let out a cry and Liam quickly grabbed his things and ran out of her apartment as fast as he could, not looking back. Clenching his teeth hard he swallowed down the nauseous feeling that was creeping up his throat. He sat in his car and took a deep breath and began driving home, trying his best to stop himself from shaking and his tears from falling.
“Oh really, wow kiddo. That’s so sweet. Guess we have a mini Steve in our house then.” Tony said with a chuckle.
All 5 of them laughed and Tony and Steve thought that this was definitely one of the best anniversary mornings that they ever had and were excited to spend these mornings with their small and loving family.
“Wait. I can go get it. You guys just got back and you’re probably really tired right now.” Liam said getting up but ended up being pushed back down.
“No need for that bud. We’re always going to be here for you whenever you need us. You can tell us anything you want.” Steve said.
Peter felt his heart freeze and then shatter at the sight of seeing his boyfriend kissing someone else. He rubbed his eyes with his hands, trying to see if it was just a hallucination that he was having but when he looked back over to where Ryan was at, he saw him giggling and laughing with the girl. The girl who was suppose to be him. Ryan was suppose to be with him, not her. Weren’t they boyfriends, or was everything that they ever had meant nothing and Ryan was only using him?
Steve and Tony watched with a smile on their face. They were glad to see that the bond between their kids was so strong.
“No, we’re through. This relationship is over. Thanks for letting me know how much this relationship meant to you. How much I meant to you.” Peter said before walking out of the restaurant as tears started to gather in his eyes.
“I don’t think so kiddo but we’re going to go talk to him. Dinner’s done so you can start eating if you want and we’ll be right back.” Steve ruffled both of their hair and they made their way up the stairs to Liam’s room.
Liam nodded and a couple seconds later the cuff came off. Dr. Richards recorded the blood pressure on the chart.
Peter let out a sob before getting out of Steve’s hold and jumping into Tony’s arms. Tony looped his arms around his son’s shaking frame and began to calm him down. Steve adjusted himself so he could loop his arms around both of them.
When he entered the school, he went to his usual spot where he always met Ned. He got to his locker and saw that his best friend was already there. He walked up to his friend and greeted him.
“Fuck sweetheart, that was hot. You’re so fucking perfect. God what did we do to deserve you.” Tony moaned as he felt his son’s juices on his cock.
“Wuv oo.” Damian said and then squealed when Peter tickled him. He laughed along with his brother and knew that this was definitely going to be a fun day.
At that moment Tony walked in with a cup of coffee in his hand. He saw both his husband and son on the couch and made his way over to them.
Steve grabbed a washcloth, wetting it and then wiped Peter’s mouth. Peter kept his eyes closed as he fought off the nauseous feeling.
“No if, ands or buts. None of that okay. You don’t have to get into the top colleges kiddo. We know how tough it can be and we’re not forcing you to get into the high level colleges. Whatever college you get accepted into, we’ll be proud and happy of that. Doesn’t matter if it’s top level or not.” Steve said.
They waved back and stayed there until Tony’s flight took off before getting in the car and driving home. Peter fell asleep in the car before they arrived. When they did, Steve scooped his son in his arms, walked up the stairs to his room and set him down in his bed. He was glad that they had eaten before going to the airport since it was so late when they got back. Steve changed his clothes before climbing into bed next to his son and falling asleep.
“Alright kiddos have a snack and then go up to your rooms, change and let your brother rest for a bit.” Tony said.
Lilly rolled her eyes. “Oh come on babe, it’s just a bit of fun. Don’t be such a spoilsport. I’ll make you feel real good baby.”
Bruce was about to step out when the door opened and Bucky, Rhodey, Thor, Sam, and Clint ran inside.
“Hey, it’s okay. We’ve got you. You’ll be okay babe. I’m so sorry I couldn’t get to you sooner. It’s alright, let’s go home. You’re safe now. You’re with me.” Tony said as he gently consoled Steve.
Tony let out a choked sob and buried his face into Steve’s chest. Steve tightened his hold on Tony, running a hand up and down his back while also running his other one through Tony’s hair. He rocked them gently as their children watched them with worried eyes.
“Shut up. You’re scaring him.” Tony growled out as he stepped in front of his son even more so he could shield him from all the cameras.
Peter lifted his head up from where it was on Tony’s shoulder and looked at Steve. Steve’s heart broke when he saw the tears shining in his baby boy’s eyes and making their way down his cheeks.
Steve chuckled at his son’s excitement and went to go put his shoes on. He grabbed two water bottles from the fridge and waited for Liam to get back. Once Liam came back down, Steve handed him a water bottle and Liam thanked him. They headed out the door and began to start on their run.
Liam nodded his head and let the doctor wrap the cuff around his upper arm. Liam felt the pressure of the cuff tighten and he winced a bit. Wow did that hurt.
“That sounds good. I’ll check your blood pressure next. This is going to feel a bit tight but it’ll only last for a few seconds.” Dr. Richards.
“Thank dad I will. Bye.” Peter said before walking towards the restaurant doors. He entered and was greeted by an employee.
Liam opened them up and smiled at what was written. He smiled at the sweet messages and how beautifully it was decorated.
“So in conclusion, we love you just as much as you love us, maybe a tiny bit more.” Peter said cheekily.
Peter groaned at his parents dramatic behavior before they all bursted out laughing. After a bit more teasing, and Steve telling Peter to enjoy his date, they finally left. It took him 15 minutes to arrive to the restaurant that they had planned to go.
Peter woke up to a stuffy nose, a sore throat and his muscles aching. He already knew that this wasn’t going to be a good day. He climbed out of bed and headed towards the bathroom. He brushed his teeth and then hopped in the shower hoping that it would help with his muscle aches. When he was done, he stepped out and headed towards his closet to get dressed. God he felt like crap but he didn’t want to worry his parents so he quickly got dressed, grabbed his book bag and headed downstairs. When he got downstairs he saw his papa putting out his plate and his dad making coffee. He entered the kitchen, put his book bag on the chair and was greeted by his parents.
Steve smiled gently at his son before pulling into a hug and saying “thanks kiddo, I’m sure he will.”
Steve blinked open his eyes and let out a yawn, adjusting his vision to the brightness of the room. Tony soon followed, waking up and letting out a yawn and he looked around to see what was going on.
Tony pulled out the tablets, grabbed a glass and filled it up with water, then made his way back to where his family was. He handed Liam the tablets and glass of water and Liam gulped it down, hoping that they would soothe the rest of his pain.
Steve went to go fetch the thermometer and came back with it. Peter opened his mouth and Steve put it under his tongue and waited for it to beep. Once it did, he took it out and looked at it.
“That’s what I thought. I’m done wasting my time here and I will be taking my son out of this school as I now understand just how shitty it is. You will receive that email tonight and I’m cutting off all donations that I have made for the school. Good day sir. Come on Damian, let’s go kiddo.” Tony said as he helped his son get up and without wanting to hear another word from the principal he walked towards the door.
Peter nodded his head and Steve stepped out so he could get him a change of clothes. Peter jumped in the shower and sighed as the warm water hit his skin. He felt his muscles relax and he let out another sigh. He heard the door of the bathroom opening and knew that it was his papa. He stayed there for a couple more minutes before turning off the shower, drying himself off and jumping out. He dressed himself in the fuzzy pajamas that his papa had put and made sure that his hair was dry before walking out. He made his way to his room and saw that Steve was already there, a bowl of soup sitting on his bedside table while his papa had just finished changing the sheets. Steve looked up to see his son walk in and gave him a small smile.
Tony’s concern grew even more at Steve’s words. That was definitely worrying. “Let’s go see if we can talk to him.”
“Oh to hell with everyone. Did you check your security tapes that have been set up around this school? Did you check to see what the situation actually was or did you just feed off of what other students were saying and contributing to the bullying that they were doing towards my son?” Tony said, growling underneath his breath and wanting to punch the man sitting in front of him.
“Alright munchkin, now it’s your turn. Whatcha got kiddo?” Tony said pulling his youngest son into his lap.
Outside, the thunder had stopped but the rain still continued, not as heavily as before but could still be heard as it hit the concrete. About halfway into the movie, most of them had fallen asleep, snuggled into each other and the blankets. Everyone else snuggled together on the couches while they continued to watch the movie until they all fell asleep in the comfort of each other’s presence. It was days like these that made them happy to know that they could share some bonding time together and it would be worth it.
His smile was returned back before he was pulled into a hug and two kisses were pressed to his head. He understood that his parents were disappointed in him and all he had to do was try harder and he would. He would try harder and he would make his parents proud. Little did he know that Tony and Steve were already proud of him and that they would always be, no matter what.
Peter nodded his head in agreement. It really didn’t turn out as bad as he thought it would but sometimes he just had that fear in the back of his mind.
“I-I know but aren’t you like disappointed in me? I let you guys down and now it’s like-,” Liam started before getting cut off.
The phone calls took 20 minutes and 10 minutes later both of the students parents were walking into the building and heading towards the principal’s office.
“Bud whatever he said is not true that all. What he called you, is not true at all. You’re an amazing person with a golden heart and if he can’t see that, then he is not the right one for you bud. He was way out of line and he has no right to call you any of those words and I want you to know that none of it is true. You’re loved buddy and you’ll find the right one at the right time.” Tony said.
Liam was taken by surprise at the action and paused the movie. “Uh…umm Lils, what are…what are you doing?”
His parents sighed before Tony grabbed Peter’s chin and made him look up and said, “next time bud, if you feel sick, even if it’s just a little bit, please tell us. You scared us when your teacher called saying that you passed out.”
Liam nodded his head and got up, taking his plate, rinsing it off and putting it in the dishwasher. He wiped his hands and made his way back to the living room and waited for his brothers to finish. After everyone else was done with dinner, they cleared the table.
Peter held onto Steve’s hand while Tony reached for the glass of water that was on the nightstand and gently brought it to Steve’s lips. Steve took small sips before pulling away and looking at his husband and son.
Liam’s eyes widened at what his dad just gave him. He opened it up and smiled. He was totally going to have fun with this later.
They sat up against the headboard and Liam brought the tray in front of them. The aroma of the food hit their noses and it smelled amazing. They began to eat their breakfast, enjoying the taste of everything that was on the plate.
Everyone stared at the two and watched them bicker until the coach come over as he witnessed everyone had stopped playing.
Steve and Natasha were in the kitchen making hot chocolate and sandwiches for everyone. They talked amongst each other as they prepared the snacks before grabbing the tray and making their way to the commons area.
Tony wrapped his arms around his husband and son as he said his final goodbye. He was going out of state for some business meetings, which he really hated at times because he spent so much time away from the people that he loved.
Tony and Steve nodded and answered the questions that were asked. After Dr. Richards had gathered everything that he needed, he started their standard procedure.
Peter looked at where his parents were standing with tears in his eyes and two seconds later Steve and Tony were rushing towards him and hugging him. Steve scooped his son up and put him in his lap as Peter continued to cry. When he finally calmed down, he looked up at them.
“Alright guys we gotta make breakfast before dad and papa wake up. Go get freshened up and come downstairs when you’re done, alright?” Liam said.
“Pete, bud. Tony left to attend some meetings out of state buddy. Remember he told us.” Steve said as he rubbed his hand up and down his son’s back and carded the other through his son’s hair.
“That sounds like a good idea. What do you think bud?” Steve asked as he continued rubbing circles on his son’s back.
They burst out in laughter again and continued playing. Everything was going well until the lights went out and it was pitch dark.
Steve hummed and grabbed the medicine that Bruce had given them, opening it up and taking out a teaspoon and giving it to Damian. Damian swallowed the medicine before cuddling back into Tony’s chest being mindful of his nose.
Nothing, not a sound was heard in the air and Peter’s heart rate sped up. He looked around the damaged town. Buildings were broken down, trees burnt, and cracks in the pavement. He looked all around the places he could, screaming Tony’s name at the top of his lungs as he frantically searched for his dad everywhere.
“Oh for the love of god, that’s the 5th time in a row. What the heck?” Liam yelled dramatically. Peter laughed.
Steve nodded at that, his anger flaring up even more. He was going to make that girl pay for doing this to his baby boy. Nobody got away with hurting his boys. “Does it…does it hurt kiddo? Do you want uncle Bruce to make sure you’re okay?”
“Yeah babe, what Peter said. You’re not there anymore. You’re with us babe. Please wake up.” Tony said before taking Steve by the shoulders and shaking him.
Peter and Damian made their way to their study room and began to look for papers and markers. When they finally got everything that they were looking for, they sat down and started to make them.
“You’re all so cute when you’re angry like that. Goodbye Stark. I’ll see you soon.” The kidnapper said before cutting off the call.
Peter and Damian shrunk into their parents side as they eyed the doctor as he made his way back, stopping at the sink and washing his hands before putting the needles on the table and taking out the bandages. He put his gloves on and turned to them.
Steve groaned softly and opened his eyes, trying to adjust to the light. He looked around the room to see where he was. He could move freely. His hands and legs weren’t strapped to the table. Was he, was he not there anymore, he thought in his head. He looked over to his side to see his husband and son sitting next to him. He tried to sit up but his back hurt really bad that he let out a loud “oh fuck” which startled Tony and Peter out of their slumber.
Steve and Tony laughed at their son’s reaction before letting him continue playing; enjoying the delightful sounds of his laughs.
“Thanks.” Liam mumbled as he took it and put it on his hand, letting out a sigh as the coolness dimmed down the burning.
Damian smiled at the way his parents had appreciated and loved their gifts. Tony and Steve pulled their sons into a hug, thanking them once again for the beautiful presents that they had made.
Steve sighed and let it go. Damn those puppy dog eyes. He and Liam both got to their feet and started their run back home. Liam did his best to not let his pain show and Steve decided to run a bit slower so that he wouldn’t leave Liam behind. His son was so stubborn at times.
Peter and Damian looked up into their dad’s eyes and waited for him to speak. He gently started to coax them and reassure them that everything would be okay.
Tony smiled at his youngest, looped his pinky around Damian’s small finger and smiled. He then gave Liam a nod and proceeded to continue what he was doing. Liam went and got Peter and all three of them headed out to kill some time before the party started.
Peter chewed on his lip. “Okay papa. Let’s go buddy.” Peter scooped Damian up and put him on his hip, making him squeal in delight, which made Peter laugh and they made their way back to the living room.
Liam opened it up and his eyes widened. Inside was a brand new phone that he wanted to get but always thought against it.
And that’s how Peter spent the rest of his day. They played loads of games there was music, food and cake. Everyone was having a good time. Peter was glad that his whole family was here. He was glad to see his friends as well and that he was spending this moment with them. When it was finally time to cut the cake, everyone gathered around to sing happy birthday and Peter once again was reminded of how he had the best people in his life. As the party neared to an end, they played the last games that came in mind. After that game ended, it was time to open presents and Peter was so shocked at the amount of presents that he got, that he really couldn’t believe it.
Liam bit his lip, taking in the words that were just said. Maybe they were right. But the thoughts still lingered in his mind.
“Okay that’s okay, but if you need anything don’t hesitate to tell me, tell us alright.” Tony spoke with a gentle voice.
“You don’t have to hold yourself back, okay baby. Just scream and moan as much as you want.” Steve said as they both got in their position.
“That’s right sweetheart. Me and papa are the only ones, so don’t let anyone else touch you okay baby.” Tony said.
Tony chuckled and soon they were joking around with each other. They went downstairs as Peter waited for his time to leave. When it was finally time to go, he texted Ryan if it was okay for him to leave and meet him there.
After all three boys were snuggled in and sound asleep, they made their way to their room, changed and climbed into bed. The first thing they were going to do in the morning was visit that girl and give her a piece of their mind.
Steve nodded and gave them all small smiles and then prompted to ask Tony if he could sleep in their bedroom. Tony looked at Bruce for confirmation and when Bruce nodded he helped Steve up while Thor took his other side. They gently and slowly helped him up before practically carrying Steve to his and Tony’s room. When they got there, Tony and Thor helped Steve get comfortable on the bed, careful of his injuries. Steve hissed a bit but situated himself in comfortable position before his eyes started to become droopy. Tony thanked everyone for all their help but they nodded their head saying that there was no need and if they ever needed anything then they can call. He bid them all goodnight and they left to go to their rooms.
Bruce gently wrapped Liam’s ankle in a cast, trying his best to not cause his nephew anymore pain. He also provided him with crutches so that he could walk without having to strain himself.
They entered the Avengers Tower and quickly made their way to their room. Steve took Peter from Tony’s arms so he could change him while Tony changed into more comfortable clothing. Once they were all done, they made their way to their bed and Steve laid Peter down gently. He grabbed a couple of heating packs to help with the soreness in his arm.
“If you ever look towards my husband again, I will kill you and make sure that your body isn’t found.” Tony growled out.
“Li, kiddo. Are you cold?” Tony frowned, leaning over and pressing the back of his hand to his son’s forehead. He sighed in relief when he felt that Liam didn’t have a temperature.
“Whatever Stark.” Bucky said, rolling his eyes and giving him a smile. Tony shook his head and smiled back at Bucky.
Now Liam was worried. He quickly made his way down and ran over to the station his dad always worked at. He saw Tony sitting on his seat, back turned away as his shoulders shook. Liam quickly ran over and bent down in front of his dad. He looked closely and saw that his dad was having a panic attack and quickly began to coax him. He took both of Tony’s hand in his own and squeezed them gently, a sign to tell his dad his he was here.
Ms. Lee nodded her head and then went to fetch the fever reducers. She returned back with a glass of water and the medicine and handed them to Peter.
Peter looked up at both of his parents with tears streaming down his face and clouding his eyes. He opened his mouth to speak before closing it and looking back down at his hands.
Tony and Damian made their way over to where Bruce was and saw that he was deeply concentrating on a project. Bruce looked up when he heard footsteps approaching his direction and gave his friend a smile.
“Strict bullying policies? My son told me that his coach said that he should and I quote, “man up and take the hit.” Is that how you’ve trained your teachers to handle these situations? Telling your students to just “man up” and “take hits” instead of handling the situation properly.” Tony said as he tried to keep himself calm.
Both parents chuckled at their oldest son’s behavior. Sometimes they wondered what they did to deserve such wonderful kids in their life.
Ms. Lee nodded and continued to check Peter to find out his symptoms. Mr. Jones went to the nurses phone and dialed the number of Peter’s parents.
Liam hesitated and then shook his head no. “It’s just….throbbing a bit but it doesn’t hurt like that.”
“Alright class, complete the problems on the worksheet and then I’ll call each of you up to complete the problem on the board and explain what you did to get your answer. If you get the answer wrong, don’t worry at all as I will explain the right way to get it. Understood?” Mr. Jones said.
They set the trays down on the table, making sure that they wouldn’t fall but still be in reach. Steve took a seat between Tony and Peter as Damian climbed out of Tony’s lap and into his, snuggling into his papa’s chest. Steve chuckled at how adorable his son acted and pulled him close, planting a kiss to his head while grabbing the mug of hot chocolate
Tony buried his face deeper into Steve’s chest, letting himself cry while his family comforted him. He didn’t know why this was affecting him so much. Steve lifted Tony up and walked his way to the couch, their children following him behind as he sat down and held his husband close. He murmured reassurances in his ear and rocked them back and forth. Liam, Peter and Damian didn’t say anything and just tried their best by comforting their dad the best way they could. Tony’s sobs eventually died down but he didn’t look up and kept his face hidden.
“OH MY GOD! DADDIES!” Peter screamed as his hips bucked hard at the simulation and he squirted again all over the object and even his parents hands. Peter was shaking, his orgasms were getting more and more intense but god he was loving it so much. They played with the vibrator, brushing it all over his pussy as Peter screamed and orgasmed over and over again, his body releasing squirt after squirt of liquid.
He ate lunch quietly, not interacting with anyone around him. When the bell rung, a sign that lunch was over, he collected his tray and made his way to the trash can. He was almost there when someone put there foot in front of him and he tripped, sending him falling to the ground and the tray flying in front of him.
“Liam got hurt on the run and his ankle is fractured. I let Jarvis scan him just to make sure and I’m bringing him down to Bruce’s lab so he can check it over.” Steve said.
Tony took one look at Steve and seeing him awake made him jump up, which ended up making Peter stand as well.
Peter pouted, then smiled and said, “when I was little and got nightmares I would always hold him and he’d make me feel better. I just keep him around for the same reason and I know it’s a bit childish but he helped me so maybe if you cuddle him he could help keep your nightmares away.”
“Alright good afternoon class. I’m gonna let today be a free day and let you do whatever you would like. Just don’t fight and play fair. Got it.” The coach said.
“Both of you, principal’s office now.” The coach said while he went to tell the other coach if they could watch the class so he could handle the situation.
Liam smiled back and got off the seat, making his way to where his parents were and sitting down next to them.
Peter knocked on his parents door and waited for them to answer. Steve and Tony were inside their room when they heard a knock on their door. They both looked at each other in confusion wondering who could be at their door at such a late hour. Tony got up and went to open the door and was surprised to see his son standing their, looking flushed.
Bruce hummed and said, “well I gave your parents some medicine that’ll help. You just gotta eat something first before you take them.”
Steve let Peter finish and got up to go get the cold medicine. He returned back and saw that Peter had ate half of the bowl and didn’t push him to finish it. He poured the medicine into the cup and gave it to Peter. Peter swallowed it down and let out a sigh. He snuggled into the blankets as he let his papa tuck him in. Steve pressed a kiss to his head and made his way towards the door but before he could get up a hand caught his wrist and he stopped.
He walked down to the kitchen to see if his husband needed any help. He made his way to where Steve was, looped his arms around his waist and pressed a kiss to his neck.
“Oh no. Oh no no no. We are not going to start this again. It’s gonna go on for ages.” Liam said dramatically.
“Look bub. I promise you that it’s not gonna hurt that much alright. All you’re going to feel is a little pinch and then it’ll be over before you know it yeah.” Steve said.
Steve frowned before reaching forward and putting a palm to his son’s head. He could feel the heat radiating from the skin and moved his hand to Peter’s cheek.
Steve and Tony froze at the words that came out of their son’s mouth. Tony spoke up and said, “can you tell us what happened buddy?”
“No, nope. Not a chance kiddo. Now up and at em or else you’re gonna be late and if you’re late then dad’s gonna be late to work.” Steve said.
“He will be buddy, it’s just going to take some time for him to get over the trauma that he dealt with,” Tony said as he pulled Peter in his lap and wrapped an arm around him as they waited for Steve to wake up.
“Did you really think that someone who date a freak like you. Ha! You make me laugh Parker. Your just a orphaned little bitch and no one likes you. Are you crying now? Boo hoo. God you’re so pathetic and just a waste of space. Well later loser, having fun being a whiny piece of shit.” Ryan had said.
“And you don’t have to be sweetheart. She doesn’t deserve you if she can’t respect your boundaries. That’s not a healthy relationship.” Tony added.
Damian ignored him and continued to play with the ball. Richard angrily walked towards him and tried to take it away from him but he didn’t bulge.
“Hey kiddo. Aren’t you suppose to be enjoying your date and not calling your old man in the middle of it?” Tony said playfully.
Damian nodded his head slowly, looking at his papa’s eyes as the tears filled up in his own. Everything from the day came rushing back to him and he buried his face into Steve’s chest and started to cry, wincing a bit when pain shot through his nose but not moving from where he was.
Tony gave a light peck to Steve’s lips and quickly sat down next to him on the bed and carded a hand through Peter’s hair.
Peter scooted over on the bed so he could make room for his papa. Steve lifted the blankets and climbed in, putting it over the both of them. Peter snuggled into Steve’s chest and let out a content sigh. Steve kissed Peter on his head, wrapping his arm around his son and ran his hand through his hair. Soon Peter fell asleep in the comfort of his papa’s arms and a couple days later he was feeling better and being his usual self.
“That sounds delicious and of course I am. I’m not going to let you do all this work by yourself.” Peter said as he helped his brother gather the rest of the ingredients.
They continued to bake the treats and once they were done, they headed out to the common area where their son was laying down. They saw that he was still and asleep but they had to wake him up so that he could dinner and take his medicine.
Tony snickered as he continued to tease his best friend. They went back and forth teasing each other and laughing at their ridiculous talks.
Peter had been waiting for an hour now and Ryan hadn’t shown up. He rubbed at his eyes to stop the tears from coming as he took out his phone and dialed Ryan’s number to see if he would pick up. He tried a couple times and when Ryan didn’t answer he let himself shed a few tears. Numerous thoughts ran through his mind as to what could have happened or if he had done anything wrong to make Ryan upset but he couldn’t think of anything.
“Steve? Peter?” He called out. He reached his room and opened the room to see his husband rocking their son in his arms. He walked in quietly and quickly.
He arched his back and pushed his mound closer into his parents face and came. Tony and Steve slurped up their son’s juices, devouring the musky taste of his wetness. Steve pushed in a finger and started to finger his son’s cunt as the hole clenched around it. Peter was panting, his pussy throbbing around his papa’s finger as Steve began to speed up his thrusts, adding two more fingers into the hot and wet cavern.
And any other prompt details you might want to add. Your prompts can be simple and to the point or in detail as to what you want to happen. If your prompt confuses me, which I’m sure it won’t, I’ll ask for clarifications.
“I decided to make sausages and hash browns for breakfast and I saw this recipe for strawberry French toast that looked really delicious and easy to make so I was going to try that. Wanna help?” Liam said.
Peter nodded, gave them a smile and snuggled even more in between his parents. Steve put an arm around his son while Tony grabbed his hand in a way to comfort him. They watched the movie quietly and soon Peter fell asleep, knowing that his parents always had his back and that they would love him no matter what. He didn’t need Ryan in his life. He could do much better and he would. Just like his parents said, he’ll find the right one when it comes time but for now Peter enjoyed the love and comfort of his parents and he knew that if no one else in the world loved him, his dad and his pops surely did.
