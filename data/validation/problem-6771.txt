Tony looked up to see Steve approaching him, with a nervous but determined expression on his face. It hurt to look at him, knowing he didn’t feel the same. All he wanted was to be left alone in peace. Steve, no doubt, had noticed something was wrong, maybe even picked up on Tony’s feelings what with the way he had hightailed it out of there, and probably wanted to talk it all out. Ugh. He knew how that was gonna end. Polite but firm rejection and a promise to be friends forever, thrown in the mix. He threw back the rest of his drink as Steve came to a stop in front of him.
“Okay, I’ve got to admit, I was skeptical, but you actually managed to pull it off. How’d you do it?” Steve bumped his shoulder against Natasha’s after everyone had dispersed after picking names.
“You haven’t answered my question yet. Will you be fulfilling this voucher as well?”, Steve insisted as he nipped at Tony’s lower lip.
“Okay, you can shove off if you’re not going to help. And you know why. This gift is perfect. It’s just, I can really see him in this. I just need to figure out these damn needles.”
Steve beamed. The guy’s smile looked like it was made up of rainbows and puppies and sunshine and Tony found himself unable to help but smile back. Ugh, this crush really was rather inconvenient. Look at what he got himself roped into now. All because of a crush.
“Tony, it is 3:30 in the morning. That’s when normal people are asleep and are not worrying about what stupid thing their best friend has pulled off now.” Rhodey bit out, in that exact tone of voice which meant that he was currently pinching the bridge of his nose and wishing Tony were in front of him, so that he could effectively punctuate that statement with a punch.
Come morning, Tony left Grant sleeping under the sheets, kissed him goodbye and quietly slipped out of the room. He made his way back to the mansion by five and fell asleep, dreaming about what ifs and if onlys, starring the pretty blonde from the previous night.
They walked a block to the hotel Tony had chosen for the night and made their way up to the suite. As soon as they were inside, Tony pushed Grant up against the door and kissed him thoroughly. Grant ran his hands over Tony while Tony left a pretty little line of hickeys across his neck. As they moved things further, Grant quietly confessed that he didn't have much experience and was in fact, a virgin. Tony quietly groaned at the perfect, untouched man, all ready and waiting for him and vowed to make it the best night he could. The rest of the night was lost in a blur of discarded clothes, exploring fingers and pretty noises.
“Aw come now, no need to be so grumpy. Don’t you envy those plebeians their ordinary lives? Anyway, I need your help. This is important. Life or death important. You know how it is, superhero and all, Iron Suckup, was it?”
"Hey, I'm Grant. What's your name?" , asked Dimples (HIS NAME IS GRANT! Tony's mind helpfully screamed at him)
Okay so what did Steve like? Old Brooklyn neighborhoods, the museums, runs in the dog park, modern art----Oh! He had the perfect idea. Steve had terrible taste in music and it was Tony’s duty as a friend to help educate him, introduce him to the classics and the whole world of rock music and what better way of doing that than making Steve an old fashioned, honest to god mix tape? It was a classic gift idea and Steve would love listening to it with an age-old cassette player. Tony would throw that in as well! It really was the perfect gift.
“Explain to me why Tony seems to think you gave him a rejection sweater for Christmas because you didn’t feel the same, even though I know for a fact that you’re stupid about him and had me rig Secret Santa just for him.”, Natasha ground out.
“It will be fun. Come on. Its Christmas. I just- back in the orphanage, Bucky and I used to play it with the other kids and it made being stuck alone on Christmas so much better. I just thought we could have that again, you know. Like a team, like friends, all together.” Steve’s lower lip jutted out as he pouted.
"Come on man, are you listening to yourself? A decorated captain, who apparently is one of the nicest guys out there, made up a fake identity, stalked you to find out exactly which bar you would end up in the night before your marriage and then proceeded to make amazing conversation, charm you and sleep with you, all just to make fun of you?" Rhodey exclaimed disbelievingly.
“Merry Christmas, Tony.”, Steve whispered and they kissed again, to a series of cat calls and whooping from the room at large.
“Yeah, I thought it would be perfect, what with all your complaints about being cold and you’re always stealing my hoodie on movie nights and now you don’t have to do that anymore and you could just wear this- “
Steve blushed fetchingly at the words and whispered, "Hi, my name is Steve. I am a Captain in the army and a part time comic book artist in my down time. I hate that I was pushed into this thing but I'm glad for it because it brought me to you."
It was Nat’s turn to blink at him, before the corner of her mouth tugged into a smirk, looking somewhat smug.
- she supposed there would be a slight awkwardness. Not so much on her part, she didn’t really care when it came to her team; she knew them more than they probably knew themselves and
Okay, so he wasn’t oblivious to the tension between him and Tony. Everyone knew about it - they were like hot and cold, they bickered relentlessly, started shouting matches only every week it seemed, and had a very complicated past when it came to each other, extending prior to their actual first meeting. But the tension had started to dissipate into something more… interesting? Was the best way Steve could describe it.
hard to keep himself busy, to not let his thoughts get away with him as to why they would be sleeping in for so long and
“Yes, and I agree - no way in hell are Hydra managing to sneak past about one hundred armed soldiers defending every entrance to the place,” he then pulled up another file, “But, they were there long enough to find journals from the original team on the programme, many of whom firmly believed that Erskine collated all his data in some vault in Switzerland - the only place not teeming with special interest,”
They eventually reached the base, only visible by a few bunkers inconspicuously poking up through the snow. They were concealed as old war bunkers, but Steve had studied the layout religiously, and recognised which one was a concealed entrance.
Bucky vaulted into the building the second the gap was big enough, followed closely by Nat. The others stayed outside prepping medical supplies just in case, Clint taking a business call with S.H.I.E.L.D who were on clean-up.
Bucky shifted awkwardly next to Tony, who was barely suppressing the body-wracking shudders escaping from his control.
It was only enhanced by the fact that he now gazed at the man through rose-tinted glasses. Well, that was a stretch, because glasses or not, Tony was astonishing.
Clint eyed Tony warily as the smaller man gently felt around his ribs, trying to get an idea on the damage. Since the ordeal with the accords and the barbs Clint had directed at Tony from behind bars, their once playful friendship had become cold and unsettled. Clint had trusted Tony, but after the…
Damn. He was maturing. Giving advice and being all responsible and shit. He pulled back the bowstring, and made a bullseye (of course), before slyly looking back towards the bench, noting that Steve had gone.
“Steve – I know,” the other man smiled, “I mean, knowing you, I’d be a little concerned if you didn’t,”
“I think I know that hat - that hat abducted me, it did things to me and now I can’t have children!” Clint said, stood in his obscene purple flip flops.
Tony stilled, but after a few moments leaned into his touch, eventually laying his head down on Steve’s shoulder. Steve bit his lip to stop himself grinning like a mad-man.
When he entered, Tony was sitting cross-legged on one of his rug’s. True to Nat’s warning, there were bits of wiring and metal, circuit boards and intricate tools Steve was sure he’d probably snap between his fingers if he attempted to operate them.
Inside it was dark, filled with a few bookshelves, but namely a large sofa some of them occasionally used to read on.
“God, don’t pull that face, it’s not near as assuring as you think it is.” Rhodey laughed softly, then directed his attention to Nat.
Natasha and Tony marched in unison toward the communications room, while Bucky and Steve patrolled the corridors surrounding the room, ready to notify the other pair of any suspicious activity. They couldn’t blow their cover before getting the message to S.H.I.E.L.D out.
The shock of the freezing water sent Tony reeling back, thrashing against the water. He felt hands tighten around his jacket, pulling him under, pushing on his head, forcing it down and scrambling over his body.
Nat wanted to rebuff that statement but held out a little longer. Tony wet his lips, and continued, albeit a little softer.
It was his penance, and he deserved every stretch mark, scar, discolouration, and mutilation the device projected onto him. It was freakish, he knew - Pepper, bless her heart, had never mentioned it save for the situation where she had to stick her hand through his chest.
“Oh, can we make a trip of it?” Nat supplied from her spot on the rug, legs thrown over Bruce’s lap. “If we’re needed anywhere we’ll get there in a flash, I mean, New York isn’t the only place that needs defending-”
sound while waving his hand around, trying to encompass the atmosphere of the gym, “And it’s so stupid but it
Tony groaned softly into his mouth, making Steve’s weak. He placed a hand at the small of Tony’s back, his other hand still in Tony’s hair, as he tipped the other man backwards and leant forward. He might have been anxious about being rejected, but now, kissing Tony was all the affirmation Steve needed to jump into action, all his previous hesitation replaced with a searing
“Everyone else seems to have forgiven me now,” Steve sighed, twiddling his fingers together, casting a cautious look at the other man.
As soon as she spoke, Tony had decoded the file, which exploded into hundreds of top secret documents, all of which had been produced in the last six months.
did he get that idea from?! I can’t even tell you how far off base you are with that one, Cap, but wow I’m not letting Sam live that down-”
Steve took the opportunity of Tony distracted in his banged with Clint to peek under the fold of the zipper, revealingly a deep cut in Tony’s abdomen. Steve winced before pouring the alcohol at it, holding Tony firmly in place while the other man let out a started Yelp and hiss of pain. He couldn’t tell from the outside of the undersuit Tony was hurt, which was predominantly due to the fact the dark material made it extremely difficult to see the bleeding.
Steve spun around at the commotion, gun raised, before lowering it when he saw Tony. Tony was leapt down from a hight like a bat out of hell and sent himself and - and a hydra agent (how did he miss that, damn it?) skidding across the clearing.
“We gotta jump on my count or it ain’t gonna be a pretty landing!” He bellowed at them, while Steve approached him, gripping into his friend’s shoulder giving a reassuring squeeze.
Bucky smile cut short when he saw the concern etched into Natasha’s delicate features, looking at Tony who hadn’t responded once. The gap made by the hulk was big enough for the medics to get  a pair of gurney’s in. Steve was hoisted onto one, his head rolling side to side as he furrowed his brow, muttering something about being fine, while Natasha rolled Tony over.
Barnes’ mouth was set in a thin line, barely making a sound as he breathed. He’s listening for something, Tony realised, when a noise outside drew his attention towards to door. He almost didn’t hear it, but a rustle of movement beside him and Nat was now wide awake too.
“You know, Rogers, if this is some backward-ass way of apologising, just drop it, okay? We were fine! Why did you have to bring it up, like I’m not fucking embarrassed about it? Get over yourself, Jesus,
Rhodey was watching cartoons with Clint’s kids, joined by Natasha who has sat cross-legged in the carpet, braiding Bucky’s hair. Laura and Clint were squished together on a love-seat, talking in hushed voices, sharing private smiles, and Sam was engaged in the cartoons more than the kids, unsurprisingly, every-so-often asking if anyone wanted a cup of tea or juice. He was good like that.
“The building has ventilation above it to release carbon dioxide, since it’s totally underground - those bunkers act as an airlock, which is what makes this place so hard to detect. Our best bet is to get out through the dead space above us, since we’re not exactly in the position to just walk back out the way we came.”
“S'gonna get even colder soon, did you manage to get much from the wreckage?” He spoke quietly, yet could be heard as clear as a bell.
“What’re you doing, agent?” Tony spun round at the voice, thankful he decided to keep his helmet on, visor down. Natasha entered the room, discretely shutting the door behind her.
Tony loved Thor. Thor was so wise, and happy, and kind, and his laughter rumbled in his chest like thunder- was that part of being a thunder-er?
Tony couldn’t help but crack a smile, but the unease from the performers outside a large toy-store remained settled.
Clint had his arm swung round Sam’s shoulder, Steve on his other side, helping the injured man trek through the snow.
Clint practically fell through the doorway, followed by Rhodey and Bucky, who had gleeful expressions plastered over their face.
“Jesus fuck, Tony, do you ever shut your goddamn mouth?” Steve said hopelessly, eyes swimming with mirth.
Steve laughed at Tony’s indignant squawk, before setting the dishcloth down and wandering out towards the balcony in the recreation room.
“I guess,” he sucked at his bottle, taking the opportunity to spend a bit longer to think over how to respond, “I just try to pay attention, I guess.”
“Good news is they won’t be able to intercept it unless the physically dismantle this computer, so we’ll have to hold them off long enough for it to reach Nick, then get the hell outta here.”
They didn’t even bother to sit up when the hatch to the jet opened, and Clint, Steve, and Bruce practically scrambled out, looking around frantically before spotting the pair waving lazily at them from their spot.
“Oh, for the love of- I regret being nice to you already,” She got up and went back to the sea, and this time, Tony followed her.
“How’s it holding up?” Rhodes tried, eyeing the somewhat shoddy-looking sling that hung around Sam’s shoulder.
“You’re going to be the death of me, Tony Stark,” there was anxiety in his tone, but he seemed comfortable enough that Tony could stay. They were in a hospital room after all, just not Tony’s.
“All right,” Steve announced, standing up from his perching position on the floor, “I say we rest now, get some energy and figure out food when we wake up. After that maybe one of use will be sane enough to think of some way we get outta this mess.”
“Aw, he looks so happy,” Bruce commented, before casting a look at Natasha, “think we should tell them and spoil his fun, there?”
“Here, let me just-” Tony took the stick back, sliding one of the strawberries off and holding it out delicately in front of Steve’s face.
“I mean, we have work in common, both like horror movies, that place in SoHo with the donuts, have a… a home in common, I guess you’d put it?” She knew Tony knew what she was getting at, but unlike her direct approach, was prodding to see if she’d volunteer the information herself.
Tony saw red, firing up the repulsers on his boots and lunged at Doom, swinging at his metal-coated face, then tightening a lethal grip around Doom’s neck. Doom scrambled at the armour, trying to maintain a grip out of desperation, Tony thought maliciously. This coward had put his team, his family, through hell and back more than enough times, and now had almost taken his Captain from him. Because although Steve wasn’t technically his per say, Tony felt it like a throb in his heart that Steve
Natasha sighed, “I figured as much,” she hissed as Tony gently dabbed at the wound clean with an anti-bacterial wipe they’d plundered from the rather underwhelming first-aid kit they’d found in the bathroom. “God, you
harder than was necessary, but he couldn’t help it, especially now Sam had planted that seed in his mind. The more he thought about it, the more he watched them together, the more it grew.
“You were so pale and there was just blood everywhere- it was, brutal, seeing you like that. You looked so
“We probably should have just asked that guy for his phone. I honestly don’t think they’re still after us.”
Bruce, Vision and Thor hadn’t come with them this time – it hadn’t seemed necessary at the time. They were almost relieved, though, that the Hulk hadn’t come into contact with the empath like they all had.
Steve didn’t really mention it – drawing up the conclusion that Tony had thought better they keep to side streets to avoid too much attention. Yet, when they were in the store, Tony made to move to pull up the hood of his jacket or keep his head down; in fact, he even knelt down and spoke to a few kids shopping with their parents, discretely paying for their groceries just to ease some of the tension the parents seemed to carry in their shoulders.
The following morning, Tony and Natasha were sitting on the steps of the cabin porch when the familiar sound of the quinjet’s engine came within earshot. Nat adjusted her grip on the paper cup full of sickly-sweet hot chocolate that the resort owner had given them when they asked to use the phone, clearly taking pity on them. They’d been too exhausted to properly wash, and with no other option, has slept in the same clothes they’d made their great escape in.
Clint was clearly joking as an effort to ease the sense guilt he and Steve both knew Sam was harbouring. He’s saved Steve and probably actually given them a great chance of getting out alive - two super-soldiers is better than one, after all. Though, Sam had felt particularly useless while he was consumed in agony and had to rely on Steve to keep his head on straight while they made their escape.
For a moment Steve didn’t even chew it, before he quickly snapped back to reality. Looking up, his shoulders sagged in relief at the fact no one had seemed to even notice. Tony was holding out another one, and Steve liked to think he was more blasé when taking it this time. As Tony took the last one, Steve found himself looking intently at the brunette, taking in the man’s ridiculously full eyelashes, which only emphasised his ‘Bambi eyes’ - a phrase he’d heard
Steve was too busy staring at his shoes to see the look of realisation passing over Clint’s face. He repressed the urge to grin, knowing it would only make Steve ask more questions - questions that Clint didn’t feel were his place to answer.
“Gentleman, it was a pleasure-” Tony grinned, scooping his winnings into his arms. “So, just to get this right - each chip is an hour worth of you filling out post-mission paperwork, Steven?” The brunette asked innocently.
Their easy bickering went back and forth for a while, eventually merging into the rest of the group’s conversation. As the sun dipped lower, and Tony began so slump ever so slightly (they hadn’t brought coffee with them, so much to the genius’ horror, he’d only had
“Right, coming back to that ‘jealous’ part,” she warned, “But he wanted me to tell you because he said it wasn’t his place?”
After the debrief, the others enthusiastically agreed to head to Clint’s farm for a few days. Clint was beaming, barely able to stand in one spot when they touched down, and he ran out, scooping Nathaniel into his arms. Laura smiled and kissed her husband, while Natasha crouched down in front of Clint’s daughter, who began talking to her excitedly.
“Honey-bear, I think we were too old for that kind of thing about a decade ago,” Tony snorted, wincing when his headache kicked back at him in protest.
Steve really, really couldn’t take this anymore. He’d walked past the common area, only to spot Tony and Nat passed out on the sofas, curled into one another while reruns of
She walked backwards, pulling Tony over to the area of the room with padded flooring, “You can be harder to catch, quicker on your toes, and if you for the love of
Six hours was a long time to be fighting, but it wasn’t unusual in their line of work. But this one was taking its toll. The usual chatter on the communal comm was now filled with sharp updates and commands, the occasional brisk response, and mostly of grunts and yells for their teammates.
“Yes, but Steven is staying put in his room, I suggest you do the same, Tony.” With a wink, Thor strolled down the corridor and jogged to catch up with Nat until they disappeared from view.
A stifled groan escaping Sam’s lips drew his head out of the back of his mind - somewhere he was venturing far too often these days, and he came to his side.
Tony was about to make his presence know to Steve when a spot of light caught his eye from amongst the trees a few yards behind Steve, who was busy kneeling down beside the agents, searching them for anything useful. A figure stepped out the shadows, raising a large looking blade into an offensive position.
Tony sunk to his knees, running his hands down the length of Steve’s gorgeous body, muscles flexing and tightening under the touch.
Steve winced as the knitting needle poked him for the thousandth time. Right, why had he thought he could do this again?
“So, what’s in the envelope?”, Steve asked. Tony had all but forgotten about the envelope he was still clutching in his hands.
“Okay, so you love him. But clearly something went wrong. Tony has a bad habit of assuming things and hearing what he wants to hear. Tell me exactly what happened, so we can set this straight and you both can stop with the constant moping.”, Pepper said.
“Just for you.”, Steve whispered as he smiled the heartwarming smile Tony knew was reserved just for him. God, Tony loved him.
Steve snorted, “Don’t I know it? I’ve been trying to tell him how I feel for months and to no avail. Never mind. Christmas is the time for new beginnings, I’m sure everything will work out just fine.”
He knew he had screwed up somewhere. He wasn’t just imagining Tony’s hopeful eyes and soft private smiles that he dearly treasured. He just needed to figure out how to make things right. He couldn’t lose yet another chance, not now, not again. A part of him really believed that Tony did feel something for him.
"Well, I don't know what to call it except for fate. Here I was wishing for the same thing that just happened." Steve said with a small smile, his eyes deep and earnest.
The armor upgrades had taken no time at all. Two days in the lab and an all nighter later, Steve’s brand new, bullet proof, reinforced armor was ready. But with four days yet to go for Christmas, Tony’s mind began churning again.
"Everything I told you but my name was the truth. And the answer to your question is that Howard wouldn't let me. He was afraid I would drive you way with my stupid antics. But what excuse do you have? Not like you asked to meet me or couldn't have found out anything about me if you wanted."
“Holy shit, holy shit, Tony,” the man moaned, hips jutting forwards as if they had a mind of their own.
“I think he was actually stood on the roof on the Empire State Building last battle? Conducting lightning or whatever it is you do, buddy-” Tony supplied, legs thrown over the back of the chair as he dangled off the edge of the seat backwards. Steve cringed at the sight when Tony moved too fast, seeming as though he might land on his neck and snap it or something stupid and not unlike Tony.
Steve bobbed his mouth open and shut, at a loss of what to say. Tony smiled softly, took pity on the man and gently lifted his hand, closing Steve’s gaping mouth, tilting it closed by his chin. Steve gradually leaned into Tony’s touch, closing his eyes and sighing contently. Tony let his hand linger over Steve’s cheek, then settling softly cradling his jaw.
Before Steve knew it, he reached Tony’s floor. He ducked back, using one of the glass frames to check his reflection, inwardly berating himself for fussing with his hair and checking his teeth.
“No, he didn’t,” Steve admitted to himself, “he was pulling his punches - he, he could’ve shot you with that missile, instead he just used to to trap you. He showed us mercy, despite-” Steve glanced up at Tony, gazing at the smaller man, striding forwards determinedly.
However, she couldn’t help but grin through bloodied teeth at her latest escapade, finding that she genuinely hadn’t seen herself in this particular situation. Leaning her head back against a stab of upturned concrete, taking shelter from an onslaught of gunfire, she rolled her head to look to her left. Her eyes travelled down her left arm, along the pair of handcuffs latched onto her wrist connecting her to her companion. She was met with Tony’s frantic eyes looking back at her, incredulous at her grin.
“Fine, fine!” the brunette grumbled, begrudgingly following Steve over the edge of a small crowd watching the antics of the group.
It was Nat’s turn to take an obnoxiously long sip of her drink, innocently fluttering her eyelashes at him.
Nat fired behind her for good measure as they sprinted for the treeline, making sure to avoid running in a straight path. Gritting her teeth through the searing pain in her thigh, Nat pushed forward, distantly aware that Tony was also resolutely ignoring his own pain for now. They had time for that later. Once close enough, they dove, tumbling down the steep bank at the edge of the treeline, before getting a grip amongst the undergrowth and tuning their guns back to face any agents in pursuit.
They tossed their remainder of their clothes away, ignoring where they landed, so long as they weren’t governing a strip of Tony’s gorgeous body.
Tony huffed in frustration, and smacked the dash fruitlessly when the systems wouldn’t cooperate properly. This was his tech, damn it! It should be fully operational no matter the weather - snow storm be damned.
” He grumbled, swaying on Steve’s shoulders, before sighing and pushing up on Steve’s head, coming to a shakey balance stood on the man’s broad shoulders. Reaching up, he pulled himself up through the hole he’d created, shimmying into the ventilation tunnel it had revealed.
“Nonsense! This is far better, you’ll thank me later, Samuel.” Thor grinned. Sam just shook his head, chortling.
“One wrong move and that broken rib becomes a punctured lung, and we’re royally fucked if that happens, Clint” Steve said sternly, challenging Clint to protest again. When Clint opened his mouth, Steve raised his hand, “That’s an order, Barton. Just because you could go out right now, doesn’t mean you should. It’s not a necessary risk.”
“Ah,” Wanda said, much calmer than the others – she never read any of their thought without asking, she had enough control, but that didn’t stop her getting a feel for their emotions. Bucky hadn’t even been upset when he broke the news to them. She must have sensed it wasn’t quite the case, but she never mentioned it. “So that’s why you were ‘holding off’ telling the media, because you didn’t want to have to go through the press,”
Tony craned his neck to get a better view out of the door, deciding the coast was clear and he pried himself off his bed. Looking down, he was relived they’d put him in scrubs, not the usual medical gown. After the ordeal with Clint, who protested profusely at the medical staff for baring his ass to everyone without his knowing, S.H.I.E.L.D medical had been reluctant to have a repeat of the incident.
“Not – uh, not like that, God… I just mean, I’ve been too afraid to admit to you that I…” he trailed off, suddenly finding his mouth going dry and hands becoming clammy. “So, uh, you like me, right–? Wait,
Wanda hung back with Tony, casting a concerned look at the dishevelled brunette, who didn’t look too comforted.
“Now now, Tony, don’t look so hurt,” Doom crouched down next to Tony - when had he fallen to his knees? “Consider us fair, now. You destroy three-quarters of my fleet, chase me away from my home in New York, force me into hiding like a sewer-rat, and paint me as a terrorist. So,” he mused casually, “I kill your Captain and- well, you, I’m afraid. Are you actually so naive? That you could what? Just
More gunfire spat at their make-shift shelter, sending shots of concrete dust around them. Nat instinctively curled inwards, grabbing Tony by the back of the head and pulling him closer to her. She made note of the shouting that was growing louder; it wouldn't be long until their captors caught up with them.
Steve nodded at Sam, then turned to look at Tony who - despite having a huge purple bruise forming over the bridge of his nose and around his eyes - looked at him determinedly.
“Not exactly,” he breathed. God - he thought he’d made some progress in flirting since his first attempt with Peggy, but Tony made him feel simultaneously like he was a scrawny kid from Brooklyn all over again, and like he was on cloud nine.
“You shouldn’t have moved beds at all!” She sighed, frustrated but compliantly, as she moved around the side of the bed Tony was on, only to sigh again when she noticed his stitches.
Nat dragged the man’s body behind a desk, before heading back towards the door, looking through the glass panel for anyone approaching.
The moonlight made the snow outside glow softly, subtly illuminating parts of the cabin. Tony shifted to sit up slightly, careful not to press on his new stitches thanks to Steve. For a guy with large hands, Steve had a remarkable skill for detail, probably because of all the time he spent sketching privately.
Clearly it was, because the tension from Tony’s shouldered rolled off, and he gave a tentative smile.
He told her that while they’d been stuck in that cell; she’d asked him why he’d turned down her offer so many times, and Tony can still see how she was trying to so casually bring it up, but that he’d actually hurt her feelings and
It was nice, being able to have a conversation with Sam again without any underlying heated argument. Since hydra’s attacks became more frequent and more concentrated, putting their own differences aside was necessary, and dammit if it wasn’t refreshing to just
What was it he had thought before? His mind was sluggish and he could barely process what was going on. Compressing Steve’s chest felt like instinct, it came so naturally when nothing else did. The blood loss, part of his mind quietly supplied to him. Ah, he remembered why he felt to shit now.  He’d been … singing … before? Oh.
Natasha didn’t consider herself leader material, but she was exceptional at planning strategy, maybe even more so than Steve. With radio silence from their two leaders, the responsible fell onto Natasha’s shoulders. She was already jogging to Tony’s last location while she barked out come orders.
Even in this state, being steered off somewhere unknown without hope of being able to stand upright on her own, what perhaps surprised her more than anything else these past few days was the fact that she without a doubt trusted the man at her side with her life.
“Excellent,” Nat said without missing a beat, “Get a few, and some cheesy garlic bread while you’re at it,”
On the other side of the jet, a medic was evaluating Sam’s arm, raising it to see when and where it hurt, nodding sympathetically when the man grit his teeth. Rhodey was laughing with Clint, who was currently shirtless with a large bandage wrapped around his torso, applying light pressure to the break. Steve was smiling at the two men, laughing alongside them every so often, while Tony was sat at Rhodey’s feet, receiving a gentle head massage that made his eyes roll shut.
“No! No, no, no, no, no - I’m perfect right now, perfectly fine, I could pilot the suit to prove it-”
He maintained a steady rhythm of beats, before taking in a huge gulp of air - which was heavy with smoke and dust - and brought his lips to Steve’s. They were cold and lifeless, but Tony beat on, filling Steve’s airways, until bringing his attention back to maintaining compressions on Steve’s chest.
. His nose had a soft curve to it - unlike Steve’s own quite sharp features - and up close Steve could see the freckles that peppered the high-points of his face, the faint wisps of silver hair at his temple-
They were like that a lot nowadays, ever since they got back from their little kidnapping escapade. Sure, they’d been close before then - they all had - but now… it was different. They were
Maybe Steve should have accepted her offer to help, then he might not have to listen to their endearing small talk. Christ, he was being so fucking
“Can’t take this guy anywhere,” he drawled playfully. Sam eyed him dubiously, a quirk playing on the corner of his mouth. “See, if you landed on your own two feet instead of - you know - your fuckin’ face, we might’ve had a slightly smoother exit back there.”
Steve was panting, shoulders heaving with adrenaline and fists clenching and unclenching as he caught his breathe. Tony kicked himself internally for not coming out sooner, since they clearly had needed the extra support. Steve was tired, which said a hell of a fucking lot about the current mess they were in.
Between them and the ladder escalating to the exit, was an experienced-looking agent. He’d clearly anticipated which exit they were headed too, and decided to take them down himself.
Steve lay in a large medical bed - larger than his he noted irritably, favouritism, much - looking more peaceful than he usually did nowadays. Hobbling over to Steve’s side, Tony nudged the door closed behind him with the heel of his bare foot.
They split off into pairs, since hydra agents on patrol usually were in groups no larger than three unless they were headed somewhere important, like to secure the perimeter. The base was much scarcer than it had been their previous visit, which sent a wave of satisfaction through them all.
Grunting in frustration and feeling the sudden build up of panic and dread, Tony did the only rational thing he could think of, and lunged.
How wrong they were. This man was brilliant, so fiercely intelligent he’d managed to pick out a needle in a haystack of intel - hell, it was a needle disguised as a stand of hay, if they were sticking with he metaphor. He didn’t think Tony would ever stop surprising him, and the thought of it made his stomach leap in a way that sent warmth etching into is bones. By some stroke of luck, Tony wanted him - the grunt who barked out orders and punched bad guys in the face.
“Please, that’s just an average day in our line of work. You’ll need to do better to impress me, Anthony Stark.”
The doors hissed open and immediately the team were encompassed my the freezing-cold air whipping through the door. Bucky grabbed onto one of the yellow handles with this metal arm and craned his head out the door, judging the drop distance from the falling aircraft.
, Steve had let himself slightly forget how close he and Nat really were. She was as grounding as she was unpredictable, a combination Steve didn’t think was possible until he met her.
of the reason, but mostly because you always try and set people up, so maybe it’s your turn to be on the receiving end! You deserve that too, Nat.”
“I think I just have better delivery; don’t take it personally, I’m better than most people at most things.”
Tony was running away from Rhodey now, cackling as the other man dove after him, possibly intent on tossing him into the water. He ducked under Nat’s arm, before coming up behind her, both hands on her waist as he used her to shield himself from Rhodey.
Steve’s gaze was interrupted by a beach ball colliding with with side of his face, and Tony winced as he saw the blonde loose his footing. Immediately resurfacing from the water, Steve lunged at Bucky and Sam, grappling them while Natasha, Clint and Bruce hooted.
They’d been called out to Bucharest after reports of Doombots terrorising the town centre. Doom, in all his bravado, seemed to have learnt a thing or two since his last encounter with the Avengers, and this time had chosen not to invade the city where the team actually lived. What is it and super villains and New York?
Tony had surged forward then, and firmly placed his mouth over Steve’s, enticing a whimper from the blonde, who cupped the back of the smaller man’s head and held him close. Tony’s lips were soft and pliable, and he moaned gorgeously when Steve led him back against the cool tiles of the floor, swinging a leg over the brunette’s hips, pushing him down with the weight of his muscular body and deepening the kiss.
Tony’s head shot up so fast he almost gave himself whiplash. Steve was awake, and smiling at him. Why, why was he smiling? Tony wasn’t fast enough, he could have gotten Steve killed-
“Cap actually looks pretty out of it, oh, my god - you corrupted Captain America, you heathen, Tony Stark-”
he had no doubt that this would be the hottest they’d get for the rest of the year as well. They’d spent most of the afternoon kicking around in the shallow ends of the water, blasting music and eating an obscene amount of food. But between an entire team of superheroes that also happened to consist of a literal demi-God, two supersoldiers, and Bruce - who’d transformed for a mission just the day before - so, it was a little more understandable.
“Nah, but you might if you don’t get that disinfected.” Tony said as he nodded casually at the gash in Clint’s other side where his quiver had dug into him on impact of their less-than-graceful landing.
Okay, perhaps he tended to wax poetic about Tony sometimes, but Steve supposed he was just proud of his friend’s achievements. Or, so he told himself. He wasn’t sure he wanted to look into his friendship with Tony too much. As long as he ignored the glaring signs that pointed towards feelings that were not strictly platonic, he’d be fine.
That seemed to ease the stiffness from the others, and they came forward to check their leader over, Thor pulling him into a much warmer embrace, followed by Sam, Clint, and Bruce.
Cap had decided just he Bucky and Nat would be going out armed, taking Tony with them for the technical stuff, as Bucky put it.
Bucky drained the last of his cartridge, before shutting the door, sliding the rifle between the handle  to hold off the agents from coming in. He and Steve jumped up, easily pulling their weight into the vent one after the other - their only difficulty was squeezing their shoulders through.
Natasha stayed silent at that, but he was trained just like her to notice the tiniest quirks of a person. She hid them well, but in recent years, she’d been spending time with a very different crowd of people than to the ones she was around growing up. She’d let some things slip, like chewing the inside of her lip, just slightly, but enough that he noticed.
“Why are you always trying to set me up, anyway?” She questioned after Tony had mentioned that another woman was casting eyes Nat’s way, pointing an accusing fork in his direction before stabbing at another piece of pancake.
He’d wondered over, wordlessly sitting by the other man as his trembling fingers hovered over the Ivory keys
Tony straightened up, eyes focusing as he nodded. “Uh, sure, that’s fine,” he gestured for Steve to sit down.
“Shy all 'a sudden, Stark?” Steve drawled, a twang of his Brooklyn accent seeping into his words. Tony merely looked unimpressed, but the awkward twitch of his fingers under the table made Steve  pity him, and he dropped the snark.
Back during the war, he and commandos had played this game religiously. They were experts at poker faces, bluffing, and knowing the hands to play; and they were almost vibrating with excitement at being able to rub it in the others’ faces.
“My friend, t'would be unwise to move so hastily at this moment,” came the deep comforting voice of their resident Demi-God from beside him.
Yet the invincible Iron Man had gone wildly out of his way just so he didn’t have to walk past them.
Another large and ominous sound echoed underneath Tony and the agent, before Tony’s eyes met his, panicked and wide, and Steve barely had a moment to call for Tony’s name before the ice gave way and the two men out on the ice went crashing though the surface into the freezing cold mercy depths below.
By the time their sprint had ebbed into a fast-paced walk, the sun was beginning to set around them. Tony’s breathing was laboured, and Nat couldn’t suppress her limp any longer. Her eyes were getting droopy, and she was vaguely aware that Tony was taking most of her weight.
“He doesn’t have a problem with Morocco,” Bruce supplied, patting Tony on the shoulder as he walked past them to the elevator. “He has a problem with you being the one to decide,”
The man quickly jumped into action, coming forward, and helping Tony with Nat’s weight and guiding her to the inside of the truck. He eyed the handcuffs a few times but thought better of mentioning them. Tony climbed in after her, collapsing in the seat and clutching his side.
“Sure, okay,” Tony said, looking at his cards. Tony looked up at them and gave them a shit-eating grin, before quickly schooling his expression into something neutral. It was the oldest trick in the book - a double-bluff, acting disappointed after pretending to be happy at a hand. Steve had to stop himself smiling - it was kind of adorable.
Now, they had grown to truly respect one another and actually enjoyed hanging out with one another. Really, all of them on the team had created that sort of bond with each other, but she had grown a different kind of unique fondness, a weird kinship, towards the genius as of late that she hadn’t been able to figure out.
“You’re soaked through - don’t try and tell me super soldiers don’t feel the cold, you need to start warming yourself back up, and I don’t care if it hurts your dignity,” Sam pushed Bucky down by his shoulder, plonking him next to Tony, and bringing the blankets that currently swamped Tony over the other man’s shoulders too.
“Oh, thank fuck… me n’ Laura only just finished patching up the barn the last time he landed the jet
“It’s okay, we just need help, that’s all, sorry about the-” Tony nodded at the gun held loosely in Nat’s hand, “Yeah, that - can you help us out here?”
Infiltrating a Hyrda research base never was a picnic, especially since unlike some of their other foes – namely AIM, Hydra seemed to actually learn from their mistakes.
Which they hadn’t been for almost a month now. It wouldn’t have been so bad, had New York not currently undergoing a typhoon, as Clint labelled it. Relentless onslaughts of hail and rain had poured down over the city, dragging the days and nights on into one grey, gloomy block of time.
They’d decided to head off the following evening, getting one last day of rest before heading over to Switzerland, where they were sure they’d find Hydra sticking their noses into other people’s business.
This time it was Sam that cut him off, “I don’t regret doing it, hell, I know it was going to shit before I went and broke my damn arm, but still, I held you and Buck back. Pro'ly would’ve gone better if I landed right but,” Sam hissed as Steve wrapped up his injured arm, but carried on a beat later, seemingly ignoring what was bound to be an apology from Steve, “but, like I said, I’m not going to be sorry for saving your ass - again.”
“I honestly expected more of a challenge out of your Glorious Leader, Mister Stark.” Tony blinked back the tears he had felt brimming in his eyes, seething at the sound of the muffled snipe from Doom, twisted disgustingly into a dull mechanical tone.
An electric chirp sounded from the computer Tony was leant over, fingers tapping away furiously, “I’ve sent the signal, but the tech here is - is
Steve watched the scene with a warm buzz from the balcony, having used Thor’s mead as a mixer for most drinks just to feel the effects. Tony skunk in beside him, his head rolling back in a hysteric laugh at the scene before them. Steve jumped suddenly when Tony seemed to lose his footing, easing them both into the cool tile floor as Tony continued to giggle to himself.
“I can sure as hell try,” the Colonel breathed with a huff of determination, stalking out onto the outside porch for better reception.
Steve hollered which holding Sam to his side, who had taken on a sickly grey tone to his skin. The break was bad, and Sam was only dimly aware of the situation going on around him.
, he’d realised. Moments after he’d come in, Rhodey entered the shop as well, taking one look at his friend and drawing the same conclusion Clint had just made:
Their gazes met then, for a few moments that felt like an eternity, living his stomach swimming wonderfully. And if Steve’s touch lingered over Tony a little longer than anyone else’s while they all shoved each other around playing volleyball, the brunette didn’t seem to mind.
“Aye, a month ago now, that was,” Thor sighed, throwing his head back into the fluffy cushion it was resting on.
“What’s up with you, your face is doing that thing where you look like you’re trying to crack the Da Vinci code or something-”
Ten minutes past and Tony still hadn’t seen or heard from the others. Rhodey had woken up, not nearly on as main pain meds as Sam and Clint, and had a pistol in hand from his spot on the sofa. Tony cursed whatever hydra goon had set off the EMP immobilising the suit. He and Rhodey had had to abandon most of their armours, not having enough time to get it back into working order. They’d made sure to blow it up first of course before retreating back to the jet.
. Brunch is a cornerstone of modern gay culture - if you didn’t know that before, it’s vital that you do now, since…” she gestured at him with her hand.
Steve wound his arm around the smaller man’s waist, pulling him in closely, enjoying the way Tony’s breath blew softly into his forearm - reassuring him of his presence.
After a few moments, it became clear neither of them had any intention to back away, and Steve pulled on Tony’s hips, sliding him towards the edge of the counter and flush against his body. A few blissful minutes passed of deep, passionate kissing, when the sound of little footsteps tottered into the kitchen, before sharply turning to yell into the living room.
“Lie down.” He ordered, looking at Tony expectantly. When Tony stood up, Steve’s eyes widened at the growing patch of blood emerging from Tony’s abdomen.
though, and half the time those smoke detectors went off it was probably because someone was smoking pot in their room, not because of me!”
The genius was currently trying to set up a campfire with Rhodey, Bruce, Clint, and of course, Nat. Steve himself was helping create some monstrous desert with Buck, Sam, and Thor, the latter of which was encouraging them to create some obscure kebab of marshmallows, chocolate pieces and strawberries.
“Relax, Clint!” Tony called from Rhodey’s shoulders - the reinforced frames around his legs giving him more strength to support the weight, “I’ll buy you a new pair!”
They all were silent. The last time anyone really piped up was half an hour ago, after Clint had erupted in heaving coughs and Nat had swore loudly when a splatter of crimson spat from his lips, violently contrasting against the sheet of white snow they were ploughing through. Definitely a punctured lung then, Steve thought grimly, resolutely trying to force down an emerging sense of dread from the pit of his stomach.
Steve would laugh at the expression on Tony’s face under any other circumstance - torn between shock, mild horror, and confusion - but right now, all he could do was wince back.
Steve had lit a fire, knowing they’d be there for a good while longer because of the storm messing up tracking technology, even my SHIELD’s standard. It was a pretty nasty storm after all. The team crowded round the small furnace, faces illuminated in the warm glow, despite feeling cold and bitter on the inside.
“This isn’t-” a wet kiss to the cheek, “-too much-” a bite on Steve’s neck, “-too soon,” a dirty kiss over the lips, “-is it?”
Clint had spent the majority of the mission perched on top of rooftops, giving the rest of the eyes over the entire scene, picking out bots with explosive arrows which strayed too far from the centre of the battle.
Tony was still smiling as Steve came to stand in front of him, passing him one of the mugs in his hands.
Steve leaned in the last few inches, pressing his smile against Tony’s. They kissed slowly, intimately, and so gently, as if scared the other person would suddenly realise what was happening and jerk away.
Money wasn’t a problem for Tony, but that didn’t mean he didn’t understand the problems it made for other people, so, he did things like that fairly often, though always under the radar.
“Even I wouldn’t have trusted the US Army back then,” Steve quipped, strolling over to stand next to Tony, taking over the schematics.
“Uh - what the fuck is this?” Sam asked carefully, eyeing the viscous white-goo Steve had just played up in front of him.
Bucky had to stop himself snorting when he saw Steve glance at him thought the corner of his eye, as if to ask,
“It was Tony’s blood,” was all she said before her and Bucky hoisted his limp form in their arms, making their way over the the gurney. Gently placing the man down, they hastily jogged with him out the building as medics swarmed around them, fitting Tony with an oxygen mask while others were giving him a once-over, yelling commands in Romanian for the prep team in the jet.
Buck shone a torch through the building, casting it over metal girders, beams, blocks of cement, and then two bodies, one slumping over the other. Nat noticed too, and they quickly covered the distance, coming to a stop by the two bodies.
The others gradually joined them in watching movies, and things began to pick up again. It was still…
The agent had been hiding in the shadows, seizing the opportunity of Tony’s turned back from where he dropped out the vent to use him as a bargaining token.
What surprised Steve, and Rhodey it seemed, was that Nat didn’t immediately just hand over Tony herself (they’d seen her lift
“Oh, come on! Why the hell are we just staying here?” The man threw himself to his feet, clapped his hands, and turned to face Thor, who was taking up an entire sofa to himself, Jane sat haphazardly on his hip. “You - where haven’t you been yet? Statue of Liberty? The MET - oh! Empire State Building?”
“-lets go somewhere where it isn’t pissing it down, take a break,” she enthused, raising an eyebrow at them all as if to emphasise her point - decidedly ignoring Clint’s input.
Noting the guilty look flashing across Tony’s face, Thor quickly changed the subject, and was leaning down to pick something up of the floor.
On the rare occasions she’d had to bunk with one of the guys, they’d always been quite rigid, staying as far away as possible from her without making it too obvious. But Tony… she didn’t even think it was just that he was comfortable with sharing beds with people, or that he didn’t have the same respect for women (he was best friends with Pepper Potts, for fuck’s sake, she’d never tolerate any of that shit, and if she loved Tony, that was enough of an indication that he wasn’t one of
Smiling, he felt the smooth curve of the brunette’s hipbone under the plush covers, smiling into Tony’s hair - breathing in its comfortable scent.
“Worry about yourself, Rogers!” He shot back with gritted teeth; though the prosthetics wrapped around his legs allowed him to move his legs again, it wasn’t exactly easy sailing running through snow while under fire.
Putting years of media training to use, and acting as if he didn’t care, he shrugged of the shirt he was wearing, exposing his chest. Natasha turned to him smiling, but it quickly turned to a scowl when Tony ran up to her, and scooped her up in his arms, charging at the water.
Fifteen minutes later, Natasha emerged in the entrance hall in a beautiful white sundress, dark blue pumps, and a large sun hat - the brim extending enough to almost cover her shoulders.
Tony noticed the other three looking at him expectantly, and he huffed an air of annoyance. Of course, because he was without his suit he should be the one to stay behind, because without it, he’s as good as a civilian. Steve read as much on Tony’s scowl, and sighed gently.
“She normally likes to listen to songs n’stuff,” Bucky had told Steve, Sam, and Rhodey, who were all rubbing their hands in front of the fire.
Clint started to hum along – not being the greatest of singers, but good enough to hold a steady tune. Sam started to bob his head, murmuring the words softly.
“You were -” Bucky squeezed his eyes shut, as if trying to dig pack into his past and turn over the right stone that would give him the answer he knew was there, but couldn’t find. He remembers her face, her hair, the way she moved, the way she hunted. He felt…
“It would have been too long!” Tony interrupted, feeling his own anger boiling in his gut, “Thor and Hulk were being bombarded by Doombots, you needed to get somewhere safe yesterday, and I was not gonna let that asshole just get away!”
Reaching into his pocket, Tony pulled out a carefully wrapped spliff, and placed it between his lips languidly. Steve let his eyes linger over his friend’s mouth, lips parted around the joint, and bobbed his mouth wordlessly.
Tony howled with laughter, his friend looking at the pair incredulously, unable to keep his own hysterics contained.
Bucky and Sam approached him, rolling their shoulders and stretching out their quads as they did so.
“Drop your weapons, now, or I swear to God I’ll pull the trigger,” when the others gave no response, the agent laughed, “You thing I’m lying? Believe me, it would be an hour to execute this man, I’d do it happily even if it was the last thing I did. Try me.”
The villa they were staying in was buried amongst the rows of beautiful homes alongside the coastal line, overlooking a wonderfully deep blue sea - glittering droplets of golden sunlight off it’s gentle surface. The air was thick and warm, filled with an ambient buzz of vibrant lifestyles and comfortable laughter. Their home for the fortnight was half dipped in cool shadow, the top blanketed in an orange glow from the setting sun to the left of the building.
It was comfortable. She and Tony over the past few months had accumulated that sort of friendship - they could be physically affectionate all the while hurling petty insults at each other like children. It was nice, and something she didn’t have with many people especially beyond the team. People were scared of her, which she didn’t exactly try and deter since it worked in her favour. But still, she’s still human, and it was just such a relief to have people
The others filed into the room, taking up respective places, perched on windowsills, plastic chairs, and at the foot of the bed. As the others joked around, throwing pizza crusts at Steve when he got doe-eyed, Tony settled back against Steve’s chest, and smiled.
“Decided not to go for the hot pants in the end, huh, Sam?” Clint quipped, settling his hands on his hips.
Clint was now observing Nat’s ankle (“dammit Nat you shouldn’t have been walking in this unsupported for so long” “as if I wanted to lean on you, govniuk, you were spitting blood, it was gross”) so Steve strode over to where Tony was sat, and noticed the way Tony immediately yanked the zipper of his undersuit back up.
Tony looked up at him through his lashes, half of his face illuminated by the low ebb of the fireplace opposite them. He was beautiful – this close Steve noted the freckles dotted over the bridge of his nose, the strands of grey hairs growing from his temples, each individual lash that framed his dark eyes.
“He did manage to take a photo of us in his phone’s front camera, though, so he got something out of it.”
“No,” Steve tried to play it cool, so why he said what he did next was beyond him, “I was just taking in your face.”
“He ain’t never been righteous, pal,” Bucky drawled, joining them on the floor. “He’s been picking fights and doin’ joints longer that you’ve been a moron”.
“They were fucking on Clint’s kitchen counter,” Bucky said flatly, expression not betraying any form of lie.
“You assume the worst out of things when it comes to yourself, but it’s only because, well because I
A few hours later, when they didn’t come down for dinner, no one bothered to disturb them. Steve didn’t need anything else that moment anyway, peppering kisses across Tony’s face as they led in his bed, sheets tangled between their bare legs.
Wordlessly, FRIDAY ensured the door was locked and turned the lights up a fraction, just enough to see – which Tony was hugely thankful for, since after Steve set him down on the sofa, he pulled his shift off to reveal his naked torso.
“Do I even need to tell you that it’s not as bad as it looks? C’mon, I’m fine, Nat can vouch for me,”
Natasha stepped up on the ladder on the side of the bunker, lifting the trap door, motioning Bucky to follow her. They couldn’t go in, guns blazing this time. They had to be tactical. Natasha and Bucky had the best stealth training, they’d go in, take out four guards, and take their uniforms.
“Thanks - thank you, Tony, you had my back out there and I’m just sorry I-” Steve fumbled for the right worlds, before signing and settling on, “I promise I’ll have your back next time, Shellhead.”
Green was an ugly colour on him. He had no right to be jealous, he was still close friends with both Tony
Tony stared, open mouthed and silenced for a moment before his face contorted with rage, and he let out a yell any Asgardian warrior would be proud of. Tony was ready to give everything and anything to finish this right now. He transferred all power into his chest beam, gauging a deep, burning crevice into seven bots surrounding him, and sped towards Steve’s limp form, delivering another devastating shot from his chest, taking out the two considerably larger bots who were crowded around his Steve.
The God levelled him with a mock-serious look that Steve had long gotten used to, “This is why you make an excellent leader, Steven. Stern, but compassionate; firm, yet fair. I’m truly grateful-”
“Mister Stark,” Clint declared, stepping up to the mat, giving an exaggerated bow and flair of the wrist, “care to join me?”.
the fact they hadn’t gone overseas, so) - the pair had already planned their escape. Sure, Nat would give the grunts some credit; A-plus for the abduction, but everything else…
“You're telling me your Mom never cussed you out for your manners? I mean jeez, I thought rich kids were supposed to have good etiquette drilled into them.”
Bucky took the other shirt from Bruce’s hands, and held the two up together, eyebrows raised. Realisation settled over the group like a thick cloud.
“We’re low on fuel, Tony, is there anywhere we can set down in range or do I just land us in the next clearing?” Natasha’s face was set with grim determination. She was the same after every mission, only tending to her own injuries until they were definitely out of the fray; not that she ever let on to anyone she was hurting. That had been one of the first things trained out of her -
They sat there for a few minutes, smoking together, passing the item between them tenderly. It was intimate, and usually Steve would have slipped away by now, back to the safety of his other teammates; but Tony… Tony was intoxicating. The knots that had formed in his stomach felt eased under the buzz of alcohol and steady mull of weed. Steve mouthed the end of the joint each time he brought it to his lips, as if  trying to taste Tony. It was sensual, and Steve felt himself lean towards Tony - and amazingly, Tony was leaning towards him too.
And if he also happened to loiter behind as well because it gave him more alone-time with Steve, then frankly that was his business. Also because he could pinch some of the leftovers Clint always put aside.
“No! Well, in a way – but not bad!” Steve tried, running a hand through his hair in frustration, looking helplessly at Tony who seemed to only be getting more offended by this rather patchwork ‘confession’.
Following up the staircase, it opened up onto a landing which branched off into four bedrooms, with enough space that each of them would have a double bed to themselves. Thor and Jane claimed one for themselves, while Tony lunged into one of the large rooms he was sharing with Bruce and Rhodey. Bucky slung his bag off his shoulder into another room, which he, Steve, and Sam decided to bunk in together, leaving Natasha and Clint to fight over the bed closest to the balcony. Clint won, surprisingly, only to realise Natasha was smugly sat on the bed he then realised was closest to the ensuite. Damnit.
Clicking the door shut behind him, Tony scurried to the nearest evergreen to get some kind of shelter while he surveyed the area. His breath frosted in front of his nose, and be took a moment to control his breathing before heading in the last direction he saw the others go. Following in that direction, Tony regarded the bootprints left in the snow. Hydra issue combat boots had a distinction tread mark, and Tony followed them cautiously. As far as the hydra agents knew, only three Avengers we’re currently out on the scene.
“Unless you’re planning to cook for everyone else, I’d hurry up with that if I were you before the rabble gets here,” Bruce commented, smiling over the rim of his mug as he brought it to his lips, “they’ll demand to be fed as well.”
“What I mean, is that I sometimes like to- to observe people’s faces a little closer because it helps when I practise drawing.” Okay, that made sense. He’s in the clear.
Steve swore when Tony took him inside his mouth, making him throw one arm over his face and another to the back of Tony’s head. Steve pushed the brunette’s head deeper, thrusting forward into the movement. Tony expertly got him off with just his lips and tongue, humming strategically, Steve barely able to stop himself sliding down the wall. He gripped at the handle of the banister, which gave way under his strength.
“Shut up, Steve-!” Tony grit out, though he had an air of nervousness around him, smothering most of his frustration.
Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist, flicking his tongue over the man’s bottom lip, feeling heat pool in his belly and his insides go gooey.
Rhodey of course got to stretch his legs out across a sofa to himself, and Clint occupied the other to take any strain of his ribs that he might’ve gotten sleeping on the floor. Sam took the pillows of the armchairs and made himself a makeshift mattress, which no one complained about given the state of his arm.
“I don’t know what changed, all of a sudden it was a tension that needed to be beat out in a punching-bag, and now it needs to be beat-“
Tony closed the gap between them on one swift movement, bringing their lips together tenderly. Steve got with the programme quickly, and kissed back, bringing an arm round Tony’s waist, drawing him closer. Tony deepened the kiss and Steve moaned softly into his mouth, letting his mind drift upwards. He’d wanted this for so long, it ached in his chest and throbbed around his body. He tilted Tony’s head backwards gently, kissing Tony deeper and leaning over his body slightly, letting Tony lay back as Steve gently climbed over him, careful of his stitches.
"It's not like Howard let me meet him or see him beforehand. He was so sure I would manage to drive him away and break his precious contract with the military. Ugh, this is a disaster." Tony groaned.
"What are the odds though, that we would both end up in the same place though?" Tony muttered quietly.
All of this had led to this night, the night before his wedding, which had left Tony sitting in a bar with Rhodey, sipping whiskey together, looking for his one last act of defiance before the marriage, because for all that Tony's public image of being an easy lay screamed, cheating was not a line he would ever cross. Hence, the one last hurrah before he was bound forever.
Gingerly he opened the oven and the pulled out the burnt cake. Why couldn’t the universe be nice to him just once? This was the third such cake. It was like he was doomed for failure.
When Tony reached the table, the red head gave him a once-over and a smirk that left him feeling like she was privy to a secret only known to her and kissed her friend goodbye, leaving Tony alone with the man.
Team bonding. What a joke. Like there was anything worse than mandated team bonding, being forced to sit there and pretend he was one of them, like they were all friends or something, instead of a bunch of unstable, explosive characters thrown together. He knew they barely tolerated him at most. Why bother mixing in when he could stay all day in his lab, with his wonderfully addled bots and innumerable carafes of coffee? Okay so maybe they weren’t quite as terrible as he made them out to be, but they were probably all gonna leave him some time anyway. So why get close and get hurt? Nope, the lab was safe. Tony was very much happy here.
Tony carefully made his way to the altar where a surprised looking Rogers gazed at him. The minister rambled on but it all passed in a blur. They said the right words at the right places and then it was time for the knot to be sealed with a kiss. Rogers leaned in, his eyes like clear blue crystals and gently pressed his lips to Tony's.
Steve was probably just annoyed at him and had found a way to effectively stop it all. And there went the hope, hope that Tony hadn’t even known he was clinging to, how could Steve ever feel the same if he had such an issue with Tony even cuddling with him. God, Tony was an idiot and he had only himself to blame.
Of course, it was. Because karma was a bitch, to Tony, especially. Fate totally had a special vendetta against him. The universe was, in fact, out to get him.
He thought things were going so well and Tony had liked the sweater so much, exactly as Steve had thought he would, and Tony had made him all those wonderful things. No one had ever done so much for Steve.
“Nothing. Thank you for the present. Merry Christmas, Steve. These are for you.” Tony smiled woodenly as he handed over each of the presents one by one. Steve expressed his delight appropriately for the mixed tape and the new uniform and engine until they were left standing there awkwardly.
Steve watched as Pepper and Natasha bent their heads close together and discussed something for a moment before they both began stalking towards Steve and Bucky, with twin expressions of anger and frustration.
And now a dozen articles for homemade gifts later, here Tony was, standing in the common room by the giant Christmas tree, with a varying assortment of presents by his feet as well as clutching an envelope in his slightly sweaty palms. Oh god. What had he been thinking. This was a mistake. Doomed for failure. That’s what it was.
"Aw, platypus. Are you jealous? You know you're my number one man" Tony laughed, before glancing back at the blonde again.
All around him, happy couples were enjoying the holiday season. He couldn’t help but imagine himself and Tony like that, so happy and in love for the whole world to see.
“You wound me, platypus. You’re mean. Plain evil. Anyway, since I’m clearly the better person of the two of us, I’ll let it go and come to the point. Okay, cakes, how do we go about them? Because clearly I’m doing something wrong and all my genius is unable to figure it out and J is being of no help and this is the third, or the fourth was it J, cake that I’ve burnt and now I don’t know what to do and Steve’s Christmas will be ruined all because my fate sucks and the universe has a grudge against me and Steve deserves perfection and the best and now- “
“I don’t care,” Arto says, choosing to not share about his own panic about the same thing earlier. That was earlier and he’s over it now. “They’re so cool. And they’re super comfy too.”
Tony pauses. “Because. The work we did was connected to my DNA. We weren’t sure that the prototype nanites would work with anyone else’s cells.”
Arto huffs but sits back down on his heels, reaching for Clint’s other arm. Clint makes a sound in the back of his throat and Arto hastily loosens his grip.
It’s only around twenty minutes later when Steve comes to find them. He knocks softly and then edges into the room, trying to look all normal and shit. He misses by like a mile, because his face is all pink and blotchy and it’s
“Well, glad to see that life a la Hydra hasn’t done anything to his imagination,” Tony says vaguely from across the counter.
He just keeps his head low, finishing his breakfast as Clint tries to get Anna to eat hers, and Sam and Bruce chat idly about the news.
sweep. Steve Rogers is in the room next door, visible through the floor to ceiling glass windows. He’s got his back to them, standing shoulder to shoulder with Captain Barnes and in the middle of a video call with someone. That isn’t a problem in itself; the problem is that Steve Rogers seems to have left something in Nick’s office.
There’s a long silence. Arto looks at Steve. He’s doing that thing where he clenches his teeth together so hard that the muscle in his jaw looks like it’s going to snap. He doesn’t say anything though and neither does Pepper, and it’s getting kind of awkward.
“Nope,” Steve says. “What would be the point? You never listen to me when I tell you to go to sleep.”
“Next one, Art,” Steve prompts, and Arto nods and kneels up, holding onto to Clint’s shoulders and gently squeezing with his thumbs, just like his therapist showed him.
Steve still hasn’t said a word since his initial four-letter outburst. He’s staring at Natasha with his mouth hanging slightly open again. Clint’s hand edges back towards the popcorn and Bucky firmly pushes it back down.
“Yeah,” Arto says but he doesn’t sound convinced. He watches out of the window in silence as they head out, his usual chatter and questions absent. He’s not even kicking the back of Clint’s seat. Steve’s not sure if he’s grateful for the reprieve or not - he’s worried about Arto but not so much that he can’t appreciate a rare moment of peace. He decides that he’s not a maniac, so keeps quiet and guiltily enjoys the quiet all the way to the school.
“Steve’s a jerk,” Arto says moodily as he flicks at the straw in his glass, watching it spin around.
“Um, in an empty conference suite at the venue. It’s cool. It’s my gala, I can skip as much as I like.”
Steve sighs, rubbing at his forehead. “Yeah I’d probably feel better with one too. Though the world isn’t black and white, not everything fits into a label or category.”
Steve’s internal monologue supplies. Because he loves Arto with all his heart but can easily admit that Arto is pretty used to getting his own way, and this sounds like an impending disaster. He can all too easily imagine the tantrums that will come if Arto doesn’t win his beloved box of Lucky Charms; Tony offering to buy out General Mills to get a box for Arto; the press catching wind and then the headlines about Arto being the most spoiled child on the planet; the board chewing Tony out for making reckless business calls based on his family life; the arguments Steve and Tony will have about letting Arto get what he wants.
“Shhh,” Clint murmurs, both his arms now wrapped around Arto. “I got you. You’re okay. They’re just idiots who love each other so much they don’t know what to do with themselves.”
Arto wakes after a much better night’s sleep. Well, he’s woken up twice by dreams but at least they’re dreams about the Victoria’s Secret model that had been plastered on one of the billboards in Times Square, rather than dreams about that uncomfortable sterile white room burning down.
Arto doesn't even acknowledge that Tony has spoken, though Steve takes heart in the fact it’s not an outward refusal or a negative response. With that in mind, Steve holds out his hand. “Come on,” he says. “I’ll play with you.”
“I miss you so much that I think I’ve actually gone crazy,” he says without any preamble. “And I was going to stay out of the way and do my time but I can't do it, Art. I can’t. I love you, and I love Steve and you’re my goddamn family and I know I fucked up but don’t ask me to do this without you guys. I’ll do anything. I’ll - I’ll burn everything on the Extremis project. Hell, I’ll give it to Reed Richards. Anything. You say it, I’ll do it.”
“Arto!” Steve shouts, cursing before grabbing Arto’s lunchbox and hastily climbing out of the car. “Arto, wait!”
“Whoa, watch it, Short-Round,” Bucky calls, holding Anna in the crook of his arm. He looks up and stops dead, looking warily at the crowded kitchen.
“Dunno,” he says. Anna bats away the proffered piece of toast and then lets out another unholy shriek as Bucky wanders in, coat still on and cheeks pink from the cold.
Arto sends the message, keeps his phone in hand as he stares out of the car window. They’ve been on the road for three hours already, both of them quiet and not really in the mood for talking. It’s okay though; Steve had bought him breakfast with a smile and Arto had given him a hug to try and say thank you. Not just for the breakfast, but he’s not sure Steve understood.
That stops Steve’s rambling. He cuts off mid flow, but then forces that smile back onto his face. “I’m not, I’m good,” he says. “How about you?”
Steve isn't entirely sure where the new obsession has come from, but he doesn't mind. He can take another few weeks of Cinderella if it means he doesn't have to watch Finding Nemo again in the foreseeable future. He's got a copy of Jurassic Park on standby for when it does get too much; he's pretty sure that'll be a hit.
