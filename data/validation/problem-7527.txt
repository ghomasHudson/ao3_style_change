If he knew that he would be getting prod with needles and shouted at by a feisty Italian for moving too much he never would have agreed, not in a million years. But unfortunately Steve doesn’t have the ability to see into the future, like Thor’s friend Heimdall, so he’s stuck listening to a rapid speaking Italian scolding him and choosing a fabric that will apparently ‘bring out the colour of his eyes’ or whatever that means. Tony has already been fitted for his custom suit apparently, so Pepper is overseeing his fitting and making sure everything is up to Stark Industries standards which are surprisingly high for a company whose boss once mixed coffee with kale in order to get the caffeine and the nutrients (it was revolting, Tony isn’t allowed near the smoothie machine ever again) but then again Starks know how to command respect, Howard always did. Tony is much like him in that aspect.
A little giggle leaves Tony’s lips and Steve’s expression brightens up immediately, he kisses all over Tony’s face apart from his lips to try and get more of those adorable giggles and is blessed when Tony laughs more and more.
First of all let me say I am so sorry that I haven't updated in a while, I have no excuses or reasons apart from just feeling immense writers block? I have posted a few irondad one shots and a stucky one as well but I never once stopped thinking about this fic I promise.
Steve searched for a staircase and ran up them using his super speed, the individual steps blurring as he rushed up and threw open the ‘DANGER DO NOT ENTER’ door at the top, stepping out onto the solid concrete rooftop, his eyes frantic as he scanned the roof and he felt his heart settle as he saw the man he was looking for. He approached him slowly and felt his heart break as sound of soft sniffles filled the air, wanting nothing more than to reach out and envelope the man in his arms but settles on a comforting hand on Tony’s shoulder.
is calling him credible. Hammer is just j- “.
He couldn’t trust Romanoff as far as he could throw her because she was trained to follow orders and he can’t trust that those orders will always be in their best interest, you can’t trust someone who is so willing to follow someone else. Dr Banner was a nice enough guy, but his counterpart is concerning because how can you put faith in someone who cant be controlled? The quickest way to lose a battle is to use a faulty cannon and Hulk would be their faulty cannon, costing lives because he cant be trusted nor controlled. Barton is another Romanoff and he had no doubt in his mind that if it came between saving the whole team or just saving himself and her what he would choose, at least the man has clear priorities. Thor is problematic on a whole other level because he is an alien so how true can his allegiance be to Earth? Plus there’s no way that some of the evil energy from his brother hasn’t rubbed off on him, he can’t be as pure as he looks.
Enjoy chapter 4 of 'I Don't Dance'
“Stark Industries is hosting a Charity Gala on Friday and Fury has demanded that the Avengers have a representative there who isn’t me because we need to look good and portray a clean-cut image and show that we support each other.” Before Steve can even get a word out Tony interrupts him which would rile him up on a normal day, but he can feel Tony’s stress pouring off him in waves and decides to just shut up and listen. “I told Fury that we can’t just be show ponies and rally up for the cameras, but he said we had to show the world that we like each other and are somewhat friends otherwise they won’t trust us to work together to protect them and will fight to disband the Avengers which will be a catastrophe, so I just need two of you to come to the Gala and pretend to enjoy yourself for a few hours. Well technically only one of you because I’ve already roped in Point Break and his girl so just one more person out of the three of you, please?”
“I know that you love being the little spoon because you feel protected, that you didn’t know what colour your eyes exactly were until after the serum because you were colour blind and I say that’s a damn shame because they are the purest blue I have ever seen, the colour of a clear blue sky after the world’s most beautiful sunrise because to me your eyes represent new beginnings and moving on from a dark past to walk into a new day.”
“I didn’t know that you and Pepper broke up.”
“Steve, how long have you been in love with me?”
“Well I thought this was a Gala to commemorate
Hi everyone!!!
“See that’s your problem Steven, Tony sees you and the others as friends, yet you see him as a means to an end. He would do whatever he could possibly do for every single one of you but especially for you and you just brush it off as professional courtesy? You got hurt 3 months ago on the field and had a broken shoulder and bruised ribs”
“Don’t you dare say that he’s jealous Rogers” Tony may look wrecked, but he was using his media voice which broke Steve’s heart a little.
As soon as the words left his mouth he slapped a palm over it, shocked that he finally confessed the emotions that had been festering up inside of him since he met the bubbly genius. Tony looked up at Steve with the fragility of a broken porcelain doll yet the anger of a lion as he full on screamed now.
Out of all that Tony just said he was choosing to focus on
“I did fucking tell you, jackass!”
I didn't think I would be talking to you so soon but after posting chapter 5 a few hours ago and getting such a positive response I was invigorated to write and finished chapter 6!
“No you fucking didn’t I would remember!”
“Tony I- “.
“I told you the third night you were in the hospital with your broken shoulder and ribs I –“ he swallowed as his jaw clenched at the memory. “I was so close to losing you and it terrified me that you had gotten hurt so when you were sleeping I took your hand and told you. You didn’t hear me but I prayed to whatever is out there to give you back to me because I love you more than I could ever love someone and I couldn’t lose you. I couldn’t lose someone I would rather die than live without. Then your heart started beating faster and the doctors came in saying you were waking up.”
“Stark, there you are! I was looking everywhere for you, but I should have known you would be by the bar.”
Pepper settles gracefully against the soft satin backing and Steve follows with the grace of a new born deer, all limbs and jerky movements but she ignores that thankfully. Her lips are painted a delicate nude and her hair swept up into a graceful bun that isn’t quite unlike the style his mother would wear when going to work as a nurse, its practical and beautiful just like Pepper herself.
“Ouch!”
Wait really? Those two weeks were a blur of pain medication and then he stuck to his physical therapy routine without caring about much else but Tony…Tony was sick because of him and he didn’t even come and check on him? Didn’t even visit? Damn he’s a jackass.
Now, finally here is chapter 6 of 'I Don't Dance'.
“Pardon my language but that’s a load of bullshit” Pepper sits up straight and ready to attack with her fierce gaze alone and suddenly Steve wishes he wasn’t on the other side of that look. Paired with her outburst he just knows that she has a bone to pick with him even though he hasn’t done anything, he hasn’t right?
The cold air reminded Steve of when he would sit on the roof of his building with Bucky and they would spend hours stargazing and just talking about how they hoped to live long enough to enjoy their lives. Those days all they really wished for was survival and to settle down but now that Steve was finally able to do everything he and Bucky dreamed of he faltered. Tony was the only person he was attracted to after Peggy and he was off the market, he hadn’t built any close bonds with his teammates, so he had no friends either and he went home to a lonely floor every day. Is this really what he wants from this life?
Steve laughed with joy and took Tony’s hand, setting both of them on his neck as he looped his arms around Tony’s curvy hips. They swayed to the song they danced to all those months ago and the lyrics still ring true, both of them laughing and smiling at each other, refusing to be more than a few steps apart because they are officially in the honeymoon stage.
“That proves that you were trying your absolute hardest to avoid me doesn’t it? Because the first person I looked for after it was
Romanoff stops sharpening her forty knives, why she needs forty he will never know, and gives him a bewildered look as though he’s grown another head which honestly he probably has or is at least going crazy. Looking over at his right Barton is frozen with a spoonful of Cheerio’s dripping into the bowl below, okay that reaction is a tad bit dramatic and honestly Barton had no one ever taught you to close your mouth when you’re eating?
Steve is getting his suit for the Gala and Pepper is going to give him a few home truths.
He groans as his alarm clock blares out a the ‘Star Spangled Man with a Plan’ and slams a heavy weighted hand onto it to shut it up. Tony thought it was hilarious when Steve swore he would kill him and isn’t above murder, but Sarah Rogers didn’t raise a punk who would kill someone over something so trivial, so he tolerated it the way he tolerated everything in his life currently. The only good thing about staying in the Avengers compound was that he had everything at his disposal, he could thank Stark for something at least. His showers were always hot, and he could stand under the spray without fear of using up all of the warm water, he could have anything he desired to eat ordered in and cook with the plentiful groceries in the kitchen and he also had state of the art technology all around him (although he had no clue how to use half of it) so things could be much worse. He tries to remember this as he walks out into the kitchen to hear raised voices and inhales a deep breath, what could they be arguing about now?
Steve was frozen and had no idea what to say.
With a sigh he lifted his glass of whiskey to his lips and sipped on it, watching Tony and Pepper laugh on the dance floor as he spun her around in a waltz.
“Over my dead body.” He smiled softly at hjm as he rubbed Tony’s cheek affectionately. “And I mean that literally because I think all of our friends will kill me if I hurt a single hair on your head.”
Steve inhales a deep breath as he rubs his hand over his face pondering over this current dilemma. He could easily just say no; the option is right there and Stark probably wouldn’t blame him either because out of everyone their relationship is the rockiest. But maybe that’s exactly why he
For now I hope you enjoy Chapter 3 of 'I Don't Dance' (:
come near Tony again then I won’t just break your nose, I’ll break every single bone in your body and do it in such a way that you won’t even have the mercy of passing out to escape the pain.” He bared his teeth in a snarl at the man and threw him back down to the ground where he belonged waving over security.
“Well I have missed you Stark, with all of your wit and loving comments” Thor’s smile towards Tony was gentle and full of affection, he clearly cared about him a lot, if it weren’t for the fact that Steve knew Thor was head over heels for Jane a familiar feeling of envy would overtake his senses.
just asked him a question that could make or break everything. The answer he gives will change everything for them and can he be that selfish? Can he truly do this? So many questions including the one that sent him into this spiral and he realises that he hasn’t said anything for a good few minutes.
has something against all of those involved. If he had to choose a group of people to build a professional relationship with and trust them with his life it sure as hell wouldn’t be these bat shit crazy individuals. As Stark had so eloquently put it “Fury, do you think this is the breakfast club? Because I refuse to make out with Rogers” and although at the time he did not understand that reference, nor was able to hide his blush at the thought of talking about two men kissing and him being one of those men, he did agree with Stark after watching the movie. Fury couldn’t expect them to band together and protect each other with everything they had because they were so unbelievably different.
he said the wrong thing and made Tony cry another time. God he’s hopeless at this and can only cause Tony pain.
“Hey Tony, looking good.”
“When you dipped me down and sang those lyrics I just knew that like the song said I would do anything for you because you truly had me in the palm of your hand. You’re the only one who holds the power to destroy me Steve Rogers.”
“Why didn’t you tell me?”
go to the Gala and support Stark because the world knows that they are two bulls clashing horns and due to that fact are hesitant to trust them and let them save the world in peace, you’d think they would be grateful and move on but apparently not. If he showed up at the Gala along with Thor then it would show partnership and that the Avengers are strong, he can see Fury’s logic behind this unlike with everything else but that doesn’t mean he’s happy to do it.
Steve then had only one coherent thought as he ran out of the hall as fast as his legs could take him, his mind screaming at him as he looked around he numerous faces frantically yet couldn’t see the one he was desperately looking for. His heart was beating like a drum and the blood rushed to his head as he span around, gripping his hair in both hands in a frenzy.
Wait this is about
“I have everything? What exactly is
Barton is the next to object with something pretty pitiful. “Stark, you said we wouldn’t have to do any of that rich boy stuff man” the tone he used could be described as laughable if not for his face being even more comical with his lower lip jutting out in a pout.
“People around me don’t love me they just tolerate or use me. I am only good for providing and doing shit for people” Tony kicked a stray plant pot beside his feet making Steve jump, “You couldn’t even stomach looking at me until now!” Steve’s eyes glossed over as tears fell, wanting nothing more than to wrap the broken man in front of him into his arms and make this all better but how could he? He did this. He contributed towards Tony feeling like this.
Steve felt ashen as he took in the information, shaking his head as his mouth went into overdrive and just let out rambles.
“That’s bullshit!”
Wait.
“Ever since we sat in your office and you called me your family, I really do love you Tony and I would be the luckiest man alive if you gave me an opportunity to prove that to you every day for the rest of our lives.”
Steve stood in absolute shock as memories of that dance swirled around in his head and Tony’s defeated eyes stared right into his. He cleared his throat and whispered out.
“You’re not exactly my biggest fan after New York are you, Cap? Plus you just point blank denied having feelings for me so what was I supposed to do? Get shot down earlier?”
“Glad that the two of you could finally join us” Pepper gave Tony a look that Steve couldn’t quite understand as she said this, and Tony just grumbled as they all entered the decadent hall which was prepared for the Gala. Steve felt positively overwhelmed as he was met with the sheer splendour of the room, from the luxurious burgundy carpet to the ancient paintings of cherubs gracing the ceiling it was all breath taking. He continued to scan the room until he saw a photograph on the stage under a large banner which read ‘The Maria Stark Foundation’.
he thought bitterly as he quickly emptied his glass and asked the bartender for another.
, that he has just put his foot in his mouth and his shoulders slump slightly not used to being on the other side of a lecture since Bucky used to lecture him on picking fights with bullies.
//////
“Thanks Steve, you’re looking pretty dapper yourself” he paired the comment with a sultry wink and an easy grin, their eye contact broken by Pepper placing a gentle hand on Tony’s forearm and urging him that the limo is waiting outside.
Steve’s focused was swayed from the reporter in front of him as he saw Tony stumble from the reporters crowding his space, with long strides he walked over and pulled the shorter man behind him protectively before he even realised what he was doing and glared at the reporters.

Steve has flashbacks
Tony moved forward to lean his forehead against Steve’s and sniffled again before asking a question.
Steve nods jerkily as Tony gently wipes away the few more tears that leave lines against his porcelain cheeks. That was an emotion, but love filled day for the both of them and probably one of the greatest moments they had had together as a pair.
Tony’s legs buckled from exhaustion but before he could hit the ground Steve grabbed him, lifting him off the ground and against his chest where Tony’s ear was pressed against his racing heart. His own tears were streaming down his face as Tony sobbed against his chest, gripping onto his shirt so tight that the seams were stretching but Steve didn’t care. God he was such a jackass to this beautiful man who never deserved it.
“Tony, by everything I don’t just mean money and materialistic things. You have more than money could ever buy! You have the determination of a lion as Iron Man and as Tony Stark, you have lived through unimaginable situations yet have still found a way to thrive despite that. You have a heart of gold that is always ready to help others, the Avengers included as you didn’t need to give us a place to live but you selflessly did so. You have a family and people who love you more than you could ever know- “.
Steve cupped Tony’s cheek and wipes away the tear tracks, gently caressing the smooth skin under Tony’s eyes to catch any stray drops and spoke in a low and sincere tone. “Tony, he was spouting bullshit out there you can’t tell me that you believe anything that man-child says! I swear just last week he was on Fox News giving an interview which has got to show you how unreliable his word is if
Tony looked up at Steve with red blotchy cheeks and an almost child like innocence to him as he whimpered hopefully.
As more rockets and fireworks shot up into the sky the pair leaned in and shared what would be the first of many many kisses. Steve still had a lot of grovelling to do and you can bet your lucky stars that Tony would make it difficult, but the former would do anything because Tony was worth it. For now they stood in their perfect love bubble with two special stars going by the names Sarah and Maria looked down at them from heaven and blessed the couple with happiness that would last forever. And you know what they say about blessings from Angels, they are always heard.
Their screams echoed around the empty space and Steve stood even more frozen than before, tilting his head in confusion as Tony took a haggard breath to try and compose himself but failed as his tears were falling faster and he was shaking from emotional exhaustion.
“This isn’t about me because believe me if it was I wouldn’t be speaking to you right now.” Not about her? Then what is she angry about? At his clearly confused expression she lets out an exasperated huff and looks him in the eyes for her words to hit home.
“That may be true, but you were always the only one I wanted. Even Pepper knew that, it’s why she left and probably why romantic love will never exist in my life again.”
“I’m so sorry baby I am so fucking sorry, I love you so much and I will never ever ever treat you like that again. I’m so sorry you had to deal with me being so awful to you.” He squeezed Tony tightly and pressed multiple kisses against his hair as the genius took deep breaths to try and calm himself down, Steve whispering sweet nothings into his ear as he slowly began breathing normally again but still didn’t let the soldier go.
The gang goes to the Stark Gala and drama happens
Steve made his presence known as soon as Tony’s head dropped into his hands, grabbing a mug from one of the cabinets and placing it under the coffee machine as he crossed his arms and leaned against the counter, the only sound in the room being the slow drip of coffee hitting the empty mug. He really didn’t want to ask but he’s curious and you know how the saying goes, curiosity killed the cat. “What are you guys talking about?”
Of course they danced to their signature song at every opportunity and every single time they make sure to say that they don’t dance, country might not be every person’s cup of tea but I can tell you this, at their wedding there wasn’t a single person who didn’t shed a tear.
“Pepper, instead of dancing around the issue can you please be straightforward with me? I am trying to understand how I can fix whatever it is I’ve done to you and quite honestly this isn’t helping” he narrows his eyes as he stares her down, hoping to wear the woman down but she only scoffs and shakes her head at him in…disgust?
Tony lets out a sarcastic laugh which sounds so wrong coming from him, he didn’t laugh with such malice, not ever. He giggled behind a closed fist, he let out loud chuckles and occasionally would be in hysterics where he would bend over clutching his stomach, but he hasn’t seen nor heard this laugh and definitely never wants to again. This laugh had Tony’s eyes glassy with unshed tears yet simultaneously emotionless, his grin bordering on sheer rage and his fists clenched by his hands and occasionally scrubbing at his cheeks when any tears escaped. This laugh expressed…pain. And Steve hated it.
He just oozed luxury and beauty, Steve felt like Icarus flying too close to the sun as he couldn’t tear his eyes away from Tony until he could hear the others exchanging pleasantries.
Okay so I have finally realised that with writing you cannot force yourself to finish something by putting a deadline on it so I can't promise when the last chapter will come but when it does I'm sure it will be worth the wait.
and takes his coffee, mixing in two spoons of what he thought was sugar and taking a single sip only to spit it out again immediately.
“Why do you hate me so much? What did I do, Steve? I…I tried so fucking
“Justin, I didn’t know we were raising money to keep your company running today although after seeing your stock prices you desperately need it.” Tony sipped on his water and Steve smirked as Hammer’s face turned bright red, he could practically see the steam shooting from his ears.
“Well maybe you wouldn’t considering you were unconscious!”
Tony’s face became ashen and he blurted out a quick “excuse me” before all but running towards the exit and that left Steve to look down at the measly earthworm who spouted complete and utter filth.
Steve cleared his throat and nodded before shifting so that Tony’s hand fell off his knee, the touch comforting but knowing that Pepper was right there and wouldn’t like her boyfriend touching the other man was enough to make him give it up. He didn’t notice how Tony’s face fell or how the others roped Tony into another conversation immediately, guess the super-serum also emphasised prior stupidity.
“Thor! Jane! So glad that the two of you could be pulled away from your love cave for this” Tony smirked whilst Jane gave him a light-hearted punch on the shoulder and Thor just belted out a loud laugh.
After that moment it was as though they were attached at the hip, wherever Tony was that was where you would find Steve and it was the true the other way round as well. Tony helped Steve find the beauty of New York again and Steve gave Tony a reason to keep his cool and not ruin his life.
Steve frowns and drops his hand from Tony’s cheek, taking a step back as he says “But he is, Tony. You have everything.”
Hi again!
of you showed up apart from Mr Odinson and Dr Banner which I thought was pretty awful considering the whole reason why he got so sick was because he was too busy looking after you to pay attention to himself.”
Tony was the first person out of the Avengers that he truly became close to, the only one who understood his grief and understood why Steve acted the way he did. Meeting him was good for Steve and perhaps it became too good, perhaps they became too close and perhaps he became too attached because when it came to their first battle the pair sadly fell apart.
“Plus we couldn’t miss a chance to support you today, Tony” Jane smiled softly and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear “Friends support friends”. Steve met Pepper’s eyes when he heard that, knowing that the sharp look in her eyes was there to taunt him
As he mulled over what the God said in his head, Tony had finished his dance and came over to the bar. Tony ordered a water with lemon and then looked over at Steve with a genuine smile and Steve’s lips twitched in response.
Love confessions, so much angst and emotions and a happy ending
Tony’s favourite place was the rooftop of his Tower. Whenever he was upset or angry he went up to the rooftop because it reminded him that he could get through whatever was bothering him. He wouldn’t be able to go to his own Tower right now, so he would be…on this building’s roof!
? Pitiful Rogers, even for you.
his mind so helpfully supplies, and he can’t help but agree with a soft sigh. It isn’t Tony’s fault that Steve doesn’t like him, to be truthful it isn’t even his own.
“I have a small problem with all of the Avengers, but you are by far the biggest problem in my life right now.” She really doesn’t like any of them? And especially him? His silence only prompts her to continue as she settles her hands on her knees keeping herself upright. “Sure, all of you use Tony for his money but at least the others have some kind of respect towards him and treat him somewhat nicely.”
“You really love me?”
think of anyone but yourself. Yet everyone should drop whatever they’re doing to care for you even though in my opinion you haven’t done much to be worthy of so much affection not when you have the cheek to look down on someone like Tony Stark who has taken all of you in and thinks of you as family.”
Steve groaned helplessly around Tony, the vibrations feeling amazing, but he slid his hand up Tony’s open thigh obediently.  Two fingers glided through the slick smeared there, tracing little circles over the small loop of the contraceptive implant under Tony’s skin.  Without hesitation, Steve pushed two fingers into Tony’s slick heat, and made a noise of helpless arousal as Tony threw his head back and moaned in completely unexaggerated delight.
Steve.  He hadn’t come here looking – he had ten or more (an uncomfortably lot more) years on some of the people here.  But Steve was sharp, intelligent, talented, empathetic, drop-dead gorgeous, and seemed to be enjoying Tony’s company.
“Pepper?  Pepper
He’d told Pepper he wanted to have the Courting Gala to give back, and at first, he was certain she didn’t believe him.  Tony had been cheerfully hopping in and out of bed with plenty of willing partners over the years, and had taken more than one casual heat buddy, but a Courting Gala was supposed to be more serious.  They were for finding partners, close friends, even the love of your life; long-term relationships, or at least the start of them.  For most of Tony’s life, that hadn’t been his style.
The last fastenings finally fell away, and Steve eased the last the cloth down to Tony’s knees.  Moisture trickled down Tony’s thighs, and he could feel Steve’s breath as he leaned close to see Tony’s hole and smell him unimpeded by cloth.  Alas, you weren’t supposed to penetrate anyone with anything at this point, but Steve’s fingers were making soft little arcs and circles on the bare skin of Tony’s ass that were sending pleasurable goosebumps up his spine.
Steve laughed and flushed, putting his hand on Tony’s shoulder with only a little hesitation.  His fingers oh-so-casually slipped into the ribbon loop sewn there, and tugged at it, deliberately.  Challengingly.  The motion sent a zing of lust through Tony.  Steve might be new to courting, but it sure as hell didn’t mean he was bad at it.
Pepper bustled into Tony’s office with all the efficiency of a very organized whirlwind, chivvying him out of his seat and down the hall to the elevator.  Tony didn’t offer any resistance or even a peep of protest, not when he saw the time.  Also he had long since learned the futility of opposing Pepper when she was trying to run his life.
“I don’t think I can wait anymore,” Steve said, and drew back to kiss Tony all over, soft, hot lips claiming his cheeks, his forehead, his eyes, temples, and lips.
Steve blinked, and then blushed furiously (the skin of him growing so hot Tony could feel it) as he realized Tony had been waiting on the last part of the ritual.  “Omega, I would have you.”
“I loved having you, omega,” Steve said into his ear.  Tony shivered and gripped Steve’s hand around his ribbon.  “I’d give you every ribbon I had.”
Every suck was making Tony hotter and wetter, and with the sensual delight of Steve’s pleasantly thick fingers stroking inside him, he was producing enough slick to cover Steve’s hand in a few minutes.  Tony was racing for his climax with Steve’s relentless attention, and while he wasn’t going to object to anything going on, he didn’t want to be too fucked-out to enjoy the rest of the evening.
The courting costumes all sported a loop or three on the shoulders or sleeves where an interested suitor could tie or clip a ribbon to indicate interest or just simple admiration.  Back before phones, that had often been the only way to track down an admirer.  Tony had always liked the story of Cinderella and how she’d left behind her glass-beaded ribbon with Prince Charming; he’d had to go and find the clever work of her hands, instead of a rich velvet ribbon of a noble.  Some people at courting balls like to try to gather as many ribbons as they could just to feel popular, but most of the time ribbons could lead to friendship, a date, or even sparks flying right away.
“For architecture or engineering, or science fiction or fantasy novels.  Maybe children’s books…”
“I’m so sorry, I wasn’t watching where I was going, are you all right?”
if we ever got serious with someone.”
“Bucky,” Steve said, leaning into Tony’s steady touch.  “He’s a beta, he’s my best friend and I love the hell out of him.  Back when I was a buck ten, we, well, we wanted to make sure we knew how to do
“Go on.  That feels really good,” Tony urged into his crossed arms, wondering if maybe Steve was just looking for a bit more feedback.  Rude of Tony not to keep him updated, but he’d been enjoying himself rather thoroughly.
“Anyone who’s caught your eye?” Tony asked.  He tugged a little on his tie, loosening it.  Steve’s eyes nailed to the motion.  He took a half-step closer and looked around the room.  “Maybe.  It’s different, with the new suit and all.  Thanks again for that.”
Tony ignored him, and crossed his arms across his chest defensively. "Okay well, I'm here! What do you want!"
JARVIS allowed them access immediately and it was sad that Steve already knew where to go. He ran towards the bathroom and almost cried at the sight. He heard Bruce gasp behind him.
He quickly flew towards the child, ignoring the team's yelling behind him, picked the kid up, and flew him towards safety. After landing in a nice park, a middle aged woman came running yelling, "My baby!"
Tony closed his eyes and harshly exhaled from his nose. He should have known. "Traitor!" He snapped.
Helen nodded sadly. Thor tilted his head in confusion. "And not for attention? He did it because he thought he was... worthless?"
kitchen, and was surprised to see the whole team waiting there, as if they had expected him. When he walked in, they looked up.
He let himself in and as he walked into the lab, a horrid stench filled his nose. Copper... Blood?
Jarvis seemed to hesitate before he added, "Sir, maybe it would be best for you to communicate with the others, you seem stressed and your vitals are-"
Tony stood up from the toilet, his hands shaking so much that he dropped the toothbrush. He gagged at the taste of vomit, but felt oddly satisfied. Finally, he was making some progress. He ignored the empty feeling in his stomach, flushed the toilet, washed his hands, and walked out of the bathroom. A worried Jarvis immediately greeted him. "Sir, your vitals are concerning. Perhaps a snack would do you some good."
"Tony!" Steve gasped, standing up.
Steve couldn't help but think about finding Tony just laying limp on the bathroom floor, blood oozing from his arms. He would never forget Tony's dead eyes, and his pale face, as he just laid there. It was embedded into Steve's mind. He wanted so desperately to apologize, to tell Tony that he wasn't worthless. He wanted to see the poor man, alive and well. "Jarvis please..."
Clint followed, unusually silent. Thor stood by the door, watching with sad eyes as Bruce took out a first aid kit. Bruce held gauze in his hand and walked over to Tony's shivering form. Steve let go of the brunette, and Natasha and Clint backed away to let Bruce do his work. Tony kept his head down the whole time as Bruce wrapped his injuries. When he was done, he held Tony's hand and led him out of the bathroom. Tony didn't resist, staying silent and holding Bruce's hand tightly, his eyes dead. Steve, Clint, Natasha, and Thor followed them out of the bathroom. Bruce turned to them and asked, "Who's room can Tony stay in?"
Everyone looked at each other, uncomfortably. They weren't really friends with Tony. In fact, they avoided the man at all costs. But now, they felt horribly guilty about doing so. So they all nodded.
The Avengers stared at her in shock. Even Natasha looked surprised. "H-he... he's done this before?" Steve asked quietly.
Jarvis, as if taking pity on Steve, was silent for a few agonizing seconds, and then said monotonously, "Speak wisely, Mr. Rogers. Sir takes everything to heart."
The team visit Tony in medical and realize that they completely misunderstood him.
Nobody bothered to reprimand him, they were all tired after seeing Tony's state. Clint shook his head. "Why... why were we so mean to him?"
Sad chapter oof. Hope you liked, expect more within a few days
Helen pursed her lips. "Well... for the most part yes but, well..."
Tony resisted the urge to glare at her and instead gave her a tight smile. "Yeah, yeah, just waiting for everyone to grab one."
"T-this! You can't just expect to be able to trick me like this! I'm a genius, remember! I'm not an idiot!"
"I'll go get something to eat," Tony finally relented.
The team all nodded in agreement. Steve started, "I think I should stay-"
Helen sighed. "He once tried to starve himself."
Tony looked down and mumbled, "It's fine. I don't even care."
Tony only looked down, shuffling on his feet slightly. "Okay," he said without emotion.
"As do I," Thor said, his voice low for once.
The team did not want Tony working in the lab alone. Even though Tony persisted, they insisted on watching a movie.
Tony felt himself blush at Steve's kind words, and he turned away, unable to comprehend them. "I... I'm tired now."
Tony finally noticed that the rest of the Avengers, minus Bruce, were in the room. He felt himself to begin to panic. He had relapsed and Steve had been the one to find him. Now, he would be kicked off the team for sure. To his mortification, he felt his eyes begin to water. He whispered, "I'm sorry..."
Steve finds Tony in the aftermath of his cutting.
Steve thought he made some progress. He thought that he made Tony see that he wasn't worthless, or any of that crap he thought he was. Tony was amazing, and it made Steve very sad to know that Tony didn't
The team finally talk with Tony.
Tony averted his eyes, but stayed silent for a moment. Then he mumhled, "Cap..."
Steve's expression became menacing and he shouted, "You only care about yourself! Now, thanks to you, a team mate is injured, but I'm sure that doesn't even matter to you!"
Steve felt horrible. He had completely misunderstood Tony. He thought the man was a selfish, conceited, whore who didn't care about anyone but himself. But instead, Tony was an insecure and unhappy man only looking for praise. And what had Steve done? He told him that he only cared about himself. And worst of all, he'd forced the other Avengers to have the same mindset about Tony. "Will he be okay?" Steve asked.
Everyone stared at each other. Finally, Clint told Helen, "We don't know. Steve went to the lab to find him, and he just saw Tony laying on the bathroom floor with cuts all over his arms and legs."
"I know Steve. I know it's pathetic-"
At this point, JARVIS was becoming panicky, knowing what his boss was about to do. "Sir, please!" He kept shouting, but he knew Tony couldn't hear him. He was going to have to try something else.
Steve hadn't even realized he was screaming until Bruce and Thor had run in. The both of them froze at the sight of Tony on the floor. Steve quickly informed them of what had happened. "I think he wanted attention, so he cut himself."
I finally got motivation. Srry for any mistakes. I wrote this quickly
Helen shook her head sadly. "He relapsed..." They heard her say quietly.
By the end of Steve's speech, Tony was shaking. Steve stared worriedly at Tony. "Tony are you okay-"
Natasha was looking at the bandages around his arms. "When was the last time they were changed?" she asked softly.
The team followed Steve to his room, all giving Tony worried glances on the way. When they finally reached Steve's room, Bruce flicked on the light and lead Tony towards the bed. He gently laid the man down, and Tony lay on the bed, not moving, and his eyes lusterless. It seemed like he was in a catatonic state, and it was odd, not hearing Tony talk for such a long period of time. The team all stood in Steve's room awkwardly, unsure what to do with themselves. Steve finally said, "We can't leave him alone. Not again..."
Steve leaned down and gathered up Tony’s cock in his hand, wet with slick and pre-cum, a pleasant handful of hard, sensitive flesh, and stroked it a few times.  He dipped his head down and fed the tip of Tony’s cock into his plush, pink lips, tongue laving over it with relish.  His cheeks pinked as he sucked Tony down further, and Tony gave a yelp of shock.
“Art.  I’m doing some work at community centers, teaching and murals and stuff.  I’m trying to get a gallery show, and I’d love to do some art for books,” Steve said, rocking very slightly on his heels.  He didn’t look bored, so Tony pegged it for nerves.  What the hell did he have to be nervous about?
“No worries.  I’ve been around the block enough times for three of us, and you are doing stellar,” Tony said, smiling.  He finished his undressing in a few short motions, exposing himself completely to Steve’s hungry gaze.  Scars be damned, his vanity could take a hike, because Steve was looking at him like he was the most lovely thing he’d ever seen, but also the most real.
Steve made a small gesture with his hand, to Tony, then back to him, looking down at the floor a bit before meeting Tony’s eyes.  “I’m representing an icon, I’m recognized wherever I go.  I never really knew if someone was talking to me for me or trying to date the shield.  It was safer to just stay friends.”
This was
“That wasn’t my idea,” he demurred.
Tony paused to admire the crowd as they moved around the space.  The designers who’d participated in this year’s gala had done some outstanding work with the traditional courting costumes.  Bare necks, of course, one and all.  Wide-necked shirts, strapless tops and gowns, even a couple of daring nearly bare-chested courters, all to show that the wearer was looking and available.  Tony was wearing a full-width dark tie, saying without words that he wasn’t looking, though he lacked the pin or charm to show that he was in a relationship.  Anyone working the gala who wasn’t sporting a throat charm was wearing light-colored throat bands or ribbons to show they might be looking, but not tonight.  That was supposed to keep people from bothering the staff while they were working, and so far no one had transgressed those bounds.
That worthy looked in awe around the huge room, eyes lighting on some of the art on the walls.  Tony cut the potential distractions short by throwing himself on the bed and beckoning Steve with a come-hither glance.  Steve crawled on the bed and loomed over Tony before descending to kiss him again, humming with pleasure.
“Is that-?”
Tony smiled, and kissed him, long and slow, caressing the ribbon he’d given him.  “Whatever we want.”
From the elevated view, the place was going to be jumping tonight.  Swarms of people were already milling around, enjoying champagne and canapes, trying to be as casual as Tony felt.  And he was, or at least he was pretty sure he was feeling a lot calmer than most of the younger faces down there.  They were looking for love in all the right places, and there was no better time that tonight to show off and find that someone.  Tony wasn’t looking, except in the very aesthetic sense, and that took a lot of pressure off.
Instead he took a length of blue and white patterned ribbon from his pocket and tied it to Tony’s ribbon loop in return.
Something in Tony felt like he was melting, and he settled himself in the circle of his alpha’s embrace, feeling Steve’s arms close around him like the armor he’d once used to save himself.  Settled into warmth and togetherness, Tony drifted off to sleep listening to Steve’s breathing.
“You feel amazing,” Tony breathed, and threaded his fingers through Steve’s hair, tugging up gently.  Steve came off of Tony’s dick with a final laving of his tongue, but kept his fingers thrusting slowly.  “Come up here,” Tony said, and Steve started to lean up for a kiss.  Grinning, Tony sat up and kissed that lovely neck that had been on such wonderful display.  Steve cupped Tony’s head with one hand, making a soft sigh of pleasure as Tony worked his way down his neck, across that ridiculously broad chest, to the hard, tight peaks of his nipples.  His fingers stuttered inside Tony as Tony sucked on the sensitive little nubs, and Steve uttered a strangled cry.
Ritual done – both partners had been assured of the other’s health, scent, and consent.  Now came the free-form part of the program.
“I like you a lot.  You have excellent taste.”  Tony snagged two flutes of champagne from a passing server and handed one to Steve.  “To Pepper, who will be happy to know I’ve found someone for the NASA job.”
“Yes, very yes,” Tony enthused, relaxing his stance some more.
“If NASA asked me, I’d jump on it in a heartbeat.”
Steve smiled, his blush fading.  “I was glad I did it.  I just wanted to do the right thing, and help people.  I’m also glad I got out while I did.  I didn’t need it to be my life.  My friends Bucky and Sam share the shield now,” he said.  “Mr. Stark- Tony, thank
“Move,” Tony begged, tightening his legs and grip, clenching down on Steve inside him.  “Move or I’m gonna die, here.”
.  Wall-fucking could wait until the second date.
“I’m glad,” Tony said, feeling some warmth at the praise.  Getting good feedback on StarkTech armor always felt different than when he’d got praised for new missiles, bombs, or firearms; it felt sincerer, and a lot cleaner.  “And how about now?  Since you got out?” Tony prompted.
Tony thought with amusement, wading into the crowd.  He got some attention, but didn’t get mobbed.  Word had gotten around about that; the first year a few people had gotten ejected for not getting a clue about his boundaries, and no one wanted to leave.  He smiled at the young courters, grinned for their selfies, asked a few questions, even suggested a few people talk to each other based on their answers.
“You did him justice.  I don’t think anyone else could have,” Tony said, holding his gaze steadily on Steve.
If Tony wanted heat relief, he had a few friends or professionals for that.  Most omegas with strong heats had something similar.  But he wasn’t more than casual friends with any of his sex buddies.  He wanted more from Steve.  This was courting, not just sex, and he wanted to make sure he did this absolutely right.  Steve deserved it.  He deserved the damn world.  Tony at least had more experience to draw from, and he wanted to make this
Tony was enjoying it immensely, hand caressing Steve’s short hair, but he was still very amazed.  He could count the number of times someone had sucked his dick on one hand; his past partners had tended to eat him out or finger him once past early foreplay.  Omegas were supposed to be more sensitive to being penetrated, and pretty much everyone concentrated on that.  Tony was no exception.  Having something in him when he was horny was never less than excellent, but this was extremely nice too.
“Could we… go to the bedroom?”
“Tony, you’re running late.”
Tony turned and sped towards his bathroom, calling out commands left and right.  “Power-wash cycle, JARVIS, with a scented rinse.  Spin out the courting suits and pick something nice.  Blue tie, anything that goes with the suit.  Pick the accessories, I trust your judgment!”  He shed clothing with every step, dropping them all over his bedroom.  Between a long creative session in his workshop, a nice healthful sparring session with Happy, and then ruminating over diagrams while he’d completely lost track of time, Tony knew he had to look more like a bed-headed college student after a frat party marathon than someone Pepper would let through the doors of his own party.
“Is there somewhere we can go?”
There was not going to be any formal opening of the Gala, and absolutely no speeches; they only made people self-conscious.  Instead there was food, drink, music, dancing, and enough clusters of couches, tables, and little intimate nooks to make you think Stark Industries was opening a furniture showroom.
Tony raised an eyebrow.  “Captain America, I presume?”
When tall, blond, and stacked turned to make certain there was no one else nearby he needed to apologize to, Tony noticed that his ass wouldn’t quit either.
” Steve said, looking where Tony gestured.  Pepper was talking with a group of courters and designers both, looking beautifully elegant as always.  Steve looked downright awed.  Tony completely understood and appreciated the sentiment; if you knew anything about Pepper, you couldn’t help but be awed.
“You want me to draw you?”  Steve didn’t seem at all adverse, indeed even eager.  Tony melted a little, resisting the urge to purr.
for showing off her design on such a perfect specimen of alphahood,” Tony said, recognizing the style of the suit and openly ogling Steve with a bit of exaggeration.
Steve kept stealing glances at Tony, eye sliding down his face to-.  Suddenly Tony felt like an idiot.  Here he was, monopolizing Steve’s time while silently proclaiming he clearly wasn’t looking.  And he
Steve clasped their ribboned hands together and brought their bodies together flush, making Tony moan a little in anticipation.  “That sounds perfect.”  Together, ribbons sliding against each other, the alpha and omega resumed their courting.
Omegas were wearing longer skirts, or coats with long tails that went to the knees.  A few even had the very traditional bustled skirt.  All of them were highly decorated in the back, just like Tony’s own tux jacket with its blue, red, and gold embroidery.  In boarding school they’d had all the omegas wear the traditional bustled skirts for the practice courting balls, but Tony was glad Pepper had opted for something more modern for him tonight.
“Good, you’re good,” Tony reassured him before he could even start to worry.  He gave Steve a stroke, clenching around Steve’s fingers hard as he felt the size and weight of him in his hand, his knot already filling out a little in anticipation.  “You feel
“If I were Castella, I’d be thanking
Clarity returned in an instant, the lure of the delicate schematics he’d been plotting suddenly run straight out of his head.  He quickly stepped out of the elevator, walking quickly backwards towards his bedroom.  “Pep, you’re a lifesaver,” he said, blowing her a kiss.
“What about after you were discharged, though?  I thought people would have been ambushing you with ribbons.
“Not how most people usually think.”  Steve shifted himself very carefully as someone went by with a cart full of canapes and desserts, careful not to snag on it.  He swirled the champagne, looked up at Tony, and kept talking.  “In school I was always more into basketball and swimming than football or wrestling, you know?  Then I joined the Army.  My drill instructor decided I was a project, and she pushed me.”
, Tony recognized.  JARVIS had excellent taste.  He’d have to compliment him later, because doing so right now wouldn’t have been fair to Steve.
“Fuck, you’re good,” Tony groaned, eloquently letting Steve know he was doing just dandy.
, not a casual date.  He was going to make sure he did this
Tony used the drinking to as cover to hide the rush of excitement that flashed over him.  God, he wanted to eat this man with a spoon.
“Funny, I was about to say the same thing, handsome,” Tony said, his smile never feeling so easy or free.  He cupped his hands around Steve’s face and brought him in for a long kiss.  As Steve’s body finally let Tony go, he eased his legs down from their high perch, aided by Steve, who ran his hands up and down Tony’s body to ease any aches.  Tony flopped his hand over to the nightstand to bring out some wipes to deal with the worst of the mess in return, nailing his eyes to Steve’s and whispering a soft, “Thank you.”  When Tony finished, Steve finally laid on his side and opened his arms tentatively.
“Get inside me, alpha,” he said, and felt a powerful thrill as Steve moaned like he was holding onto control by the thinnest of margins, his lovely dick throbbing and glistening, his body tense with holding back.
“Come on now,” Tony whispered into his mouth, and pulled away long enough to get down on his back, thighs spread, slick, pink hole on full display.  The traditional omega presenting was fun and all, but did zero favors for his arc reactor when it came to actual fucking; he knew from experience it called up an ache that was an absolute boner killer.  But from the look on Steve’s face, lust mixed with a kind of tender adoration Tony wasn’t entirely sure he deserved yet, this was going to be more than fine.
There was a great mix of people here from every part of the city and a little outside of it, and everyone was dressed to the nines.  It had been one of Pepper’s assistants who’d suggested leveling the playing field with little makeovers for everyone, and Pepper had made it happen with a huge amount of glee.  Courting was difficult enough without worrying that you weren’t going to be able to show yourself off the way you wanted to, or your budget couldn’t stretch for a cab ride.  Not every problem could be solved by throwing money at it, but this time it could, and Tony absolutely loved being able to play fairy godmother.
Steve laughed self-consciously.  “You have no idea what my stuff looks like.  I could be terrible!”
for what you did.  The new armor and protective gear your company started putting out saved a whole lot of lives.”
“She’s one of my heroes,” Steve said, grinning.
Tony, however, wasn’t looking to start a revolution.  He wanted this man, wanted to know him.  As befitted Captain America, Steve was a ridiculously wonderful looking alpha.  Every part of him was perfect, and Tony felt himself starting to get wet by just looking at him.  Steve threaded his hand through his hair, and Tony could see his delightfully enthusiastic response. His cock was beautiful, long, thick enough to make Tony’s mouth water, the prettiest shade of pink, and hardening slowly from Tony looking at him.  His knot was just barely swollen from arousal, but Tony could tell it was going to be spectacular.  Steve needed to model for a new statue of David, and Tony would cheerfully pay to get it into MOMA.  He sighed in appreciation and said the next part of the ritual.
“Sometimes its just enough to be okay, or not too bad,” Tony murmured back.  Steve let out a breath that he didn’t seem to realize he’d been holding, those broad shoulders relaxing.  His hand kept a firm hold on Tony’s ribbon loop, the little tension there driving Tony crazy.
him.  The desire wasn’t entirely surprising, the man was a beauty, but Tony was surprised at the strength of it.  He hadn’t really felt like that since, well, before Afghanistan.
He was drifting away from one group and about to turn to find another when he ran into a wall.  The wall quickly cupped his elbow to stop him from stumbling, apologizing all the while.
“You could never be terrible.”
His eyes were so very blue in the gleaming atrium lights.  Tony swallowed.  Hell with dancing around this any more.  “Oh, I don’t want you in a mask.  I want you in as little as possible.”
“You don’t have to-!”
“I hope my last few classes help me there,” Steve added.
The elevator doors opened and Tony joined the crowd, making sure to stroll by Pepper to prove he’d made it on time.
Tony nodded sagely.  “Totally get it, my buddy Rhodey and I had all sorts of fun back in the day.  Now I can give tips to the people he’s courting.”  He waggled his eyebrows and Steve stifled laughter.
Steve’s breathing sounded shaky, but he put his hand very gently on Tony’s head.  “Please, if you would.”
Steve closed the gap between them and wrapped his arms around Tony, eclipsing the light from his arc reactor.  “I’m so glad it’s you.  You’re beautiful.”
When the elevator door opened to Tony’s floor, Steve finally moved his hand up to the ribbon loop again, holding it loosely and letting Tony take the lead.  Tony led him into the little sitting room adjoining his bedroom, and sank to his knees on a cushion he’d snagged off the sofa.  Steve knew they were starting the next phase of the courtship ritual, and any movie with a romantic alpha/omega scene, prime time TV drama, theater production, love song, or novel with a relationship plotline from the last few hundred years laid out the script for this in detail.  But he slowed down, staring at Tony in wonder, smiling at him with a bit of incredulity before taking his place right in front of him.
“Everyone here just seems so happy.  And I am too…”
There were tables with hanks of ribbons on them all over the room, but Tony didn’t want to waste a second looking for one.  He whipped his tie off from around his neck and quickly tied it around Steve’s impressive bicep, slipping the ends through the ribbon loop.  Steve looked at him with astonishment, amazement, and a decided amount of lust.  The only way Tony could have made his interest more plain would to have stripped naked and presented right there and then.
“I’m gonna thank her too.  Probably with obscene amounts of money and a few sponsored shows.”
Tony rubbed at his chest absently as the soap was washed away and the scented rinse sprayed over him.  Just enough scent to mingle nicely with his own omega aroma, a cleaner, more businesslike scent that didn’t shout out that he was courting.  Wouldn’t want to give people the wrong impression.  Ridged, keloid scars were like tiny mountain ranges under his fingers, and the pressure called up a dull ache from the weight of metal in his body.  The metal in his chest housed a magnet to keep too-fine-for-surgical-intervention-shrapnel from slow-dancing into his heart.
“Alpha, I would have you.”
Tony felt himself blushing like a school kid.  “Not so bad yourself.  Actually, scratch that. Right now, I’m the luckiest guy in Manhattan.”
Steve took his arm with gentle strength.  “Let’s go.  Now.”
“I thanked her up one side of the street and down the other,” Steve said, nodding at the preening designer a few groups over.
“The company has a lot of contracts with NASA.  I don’t throw my weight around over there, so they listen when I make a recommendation.”
“What?  It’s weird?” Tony asked with seeming casualness.  He had understood the difficulty of transitioning back to civilian life from the military intellectually, before he’d found himself plunged into the middle of it by a murderous business partner.  After, he’d gotten a much closer and far better understanding than he’d ever wanted.  His therapist was probably the best-paid professional in the city.
And boasted about it.  At a gala.  Where Tony had just had a difficult but enlightening conversation with a journalist hungry for a story.  Between Christine Everhart’s recorder and publisher, and Pepper getting into Obie’s files, Obie had found himself with a life sentence somewhere unpleasant and Tony had found himself standing alone at the top of his company.  He used what he’d learned from his captivity and turned Stark Industries around to fix mistakes, instead of make them.  The suit he’d used to get out of that cave had been the last weapon he’d ever made.
“Never,” Steve promised, sounding suddenly fierce.  His head came up in challenge, and Tony suddenly hung on for dear life.  Steve’s hips slid back sharply, and then he began to thrust, solid, powerful, utterly satisfying thrusts that had Tony reduced to little wordless noises.  They raced for the peak between them, Steve’s expanding knot working Tony open, Tony giving up a strangled cry as his body seized on Steve, waves of pleasure rippling through him.  Seconds later, he exploded into another, higher peak as Steve shoved in, his knot fully expanding as spurt after spurt filled Tony up with warmth that left him glowing.  Steve froze above him, lost in the sensation, and Tony sighed in contentment, his own cock spurting untouched as his body clenched around Steve.
Steve Rogers was very clever-handed, and kept pressing wonderful light kisses to every bit of newly-bared skin, caressing over the cloth where he had yet to puzzle things out.  His hands were large and marvelously warm, squeezing him through his clothing with a teasing touch.  He was being careful, slow, maybe even too slow, but there was some pleasure in delaying gratification.
“You’re good,” Tony said, laying a hand on the wall’s arm.  “More than good, actually.  Tony Stark.”  He put out a hand, and the wall took his after a moment, shaking it with a hand that held a little more callus than most.
Tony made quick work of the buttons, baring Steve in just a few seconds.  The words were old, and so was the posturing, but everything was part of the ritual for a reason.  Alpha clothing was easy to remove, and in this position, an omega could give pleasure, or bite an alpha’s most prized attribute right off, if they felt the alpha had been disrespectful or coercive.  There had been more than one attempted arranged marriage or war bride who’d gotten their point across in that exquisitely painful way.  In a few cases, governments had been overthrown and new omega rulers crowned as a result.
better at it than me,” Tony said proudly.
Tony threw an arm across his face.  Fuck.  Steve Rogers was saying “thank you” for complimenting his dick-sucking skills.  Tony was certain he was about to spontaneously combust.  “Where did you learn that?”
“Oh, we’re good, damn good, you just surprised me.  Keep going,” Tony said.  He licked his lips in anticipation, and Steve smiled in relief before sucking Tony back down.  He looked amazingly peaceful with his lips stretched around Tony’s cock, slowly sucking him all the way down, hand moving to caress Tony’s thigh, then back up, just keeping the tip in his clever mouth to torment with his agile tongue.
“Besides, I bet you can remedy my opinion here and now,” Tony said.
He kept his eyes shut as the soap cycle started, the water droplets making a metallic
Yeah, definitely didn’t want to give people the wrong impression.
Tony nodded with total empathy.  His own heat-buddies were friends of long acquaintance, or professionals with impeccable credentials, no one who was likely trying to bed him out of his fame.  It was part of the reason he’d stopped wearing an open-necked shirt to the Courting Gala; the few people who knew him well enough not to be overawed were also either already in a relationship, uninterested in one with him, or too important to him to wreck with trying to take things in the wrong direction.  He’d had a boatload of issues even before Afghanistan, and now it had seemed like too much trouble to throw himself back into the dating pool. Except he was considering it, right here and now.
Steve’s hand tightened in Tony’s hair a very pleasant amount, an involuntary spasm at Tony’s acceptance.  He breathed out quickly to settle himself, then picked up his part of the ritual.
Steve covered him, weight on one muscled arm as Tony curled his legs high around Steve’s chest.  With a tip of his hips, he helped Steve find the right angle.  In a single powerful thrust, Steve filled him completely, making Tony’s head loll back and Steve’s drop to just brush the arc reactor as they savored the unbelievable pleasure of the heat, the pressure, and the stretch.
“You,” Tony whispered, his voice rough as he slung an arm over Steve’s shoulder, “are filling me up places I didn’t know I had.”
“You feel so perfect,” Steve murmured back, like he was talking right into Tony’s heart.  “You…”
The shower shut off, and blowers turned on, drying Tony off in a few minutes without the need for a towel.  JARVIS had his closet open when Tony hustled out of the backroom; the racks spun to something Pepper-approved, deep blue, with a tie in a shimmering shade darker, watch and cuff links harmonizing.  He armored up in his suit, cursed his pants as he did the five million buttons and belts and buckles, slid the cufflinks home, and remembered shoes before JARVIS could say anything.  A dash through the bathroom to make sure his hair and beard were behaving, and he was o-so-casually descending in the glass lobby elevator, precisely on time.
“To Pepper,” Steve said solemnly, raising his glass in return, “who I hope finds me worthy.”
“What kind of art?”
Steve blushed a bit and looked down at his shoes.  Despite radiating nervousness, he had none of the sharp edginess alphas could get when they were feeling defensive.  Under the nerves though was a very healthy alpha scent that was doing things for Tony above and beyond Steve’s adorableness.
Steve shrugged out of the rest of his suit with a shy smile, laying it over the sofa with reverence.  Tony drank in the beautiful sight of Steve’s hard-earned physique, briefly framing his hands like a photo, making Steve laugh.
“Yeah, I got into art school on the GI Bill after I was discharged.  It’s great being back here again but…”
“Thank you,” he said, painfully sincere, shifting a little back and forth.  “I was lucky I didn’t get killed or court-martialed.”
“Sergeant Carter would probably like that.  In the USO, you spend a lot of time in transit, or waiting around.  I made the most of it with every gym we came across, and when we didn’t have that, I improvised.
sequined.  Plus he’d rigged up lights on it.  He’d won first prize by a landslide, once everyone, including him, had stopped laughing.
“Ah…” Steve stared down at the deep blue tie that was covering over the ribbons his friends had given him.  “Tony…”
It had been a damn miracle he’d been found alive.  A few months later, after shutting down weapons’ manufacturing, Obie had gotten Tony voted out.
The designers had included other traditional elements in the courting costumes.  The alphas had very well-cut pants or skirts with high slits, elaborately decorated on the front.  At more formal parties, the traditional decorated codpieces were standard for alphas, but most regular folks wouldn’t be caught dead in a codpiece in public.  Wisely the designers had updated the designs, though Tony did spy a few die-hard traditionalists.
“I’ll take you up on that later.  What do you have on your phone?”
