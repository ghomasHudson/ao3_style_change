“JARVIS?”
"Well?"
Steve smiled as if they both knew that wasn't true and considering the fact that they hadn't even talked about how much money he would get, he was right of course, but that fact would be manfully ignored for the good of all and they both knew that too. They were getting to be bros already.
" Tony shook himself out of his reverie. "
Morgaine looked at him in surprise. It was the first time her face showed anything but sullen anger.
“You do?”
"Does my soul have any value? I would think it would be completely ruined by all the deaths I am responsible for. With all the blood I have on my hands, surely, my soul is a shoo in for you. Why haven't you taken it yet?" He watched the demon ponder his words. He thought there might be a little airflow coming from a shadowy place behind him. Avoiding showing any interest in that, he stepped back a bit to make sure he wasn't mistaken. He needed to keep the demon engaged, though.
"Listen," he started, "that
“Devotees? Cultists? Sla-”
“Yech, that is positively medieval. Do it, I guess, but don't get caught.” He watched the man some more to see if he was going to approach or anything but the guy seemed content with just watching Steve for now.
For the last motherfucking time, he swore to himself.
Someway, somehow, Pepper had managed to find a WWII army dress uniform that fit Steve and the way he entered the room with his cap under his arm and a shy smile and a small wave of his hand, there wasn’t a person there who didn’t instantly fall a little bit in love with him. Steve talked with ease, made it seem delighted that he was there with all of them and had obviously been briefed within an inch of his life by Pepper. He made Tony sound like a swell guy, who had completely selflessly searched for him for decades in secret and offered him a safe haven to get adjusted to these confusing modern times. He played endearingly discombobulated when reporters tried testing his knowledge of recent events, he told some funny war stories and managed to be so ‘Aw Shucks’ about his ordeal, that Tony had an almost irrepressible urge to lean in towards the microphone and announce. “I sucked his dick, yesterday. Just so you know.” But then he spotted Fury and Natalie behind the crowd of reporters and he got distracted.
“Oh god, Steve, I missed you so much.” Tony swallowed down a lump in his throat and blinked furiously.
When the shepherd's pie is in the oven, Tony goes and takes another shower and Steve tries to focus on Tom Clancy again. It doesn't work. He's horny and he's scared. Last night was a disaster in every sense of the word, yet it's as if it happened years ago and he can think back on it, shrugging and saying, “yeah, that happened,“ without any of the anguish that ought to accompany a memory of falling apart like that. Like it was a totally reasonable price to pay for getting Tony's mouth on his dick. As hard as he is getting just thinking about that mouth, maybe it was. It freaks him out a little. He remembers how scared he was when Tony propositioned him, and he remembers the utter devastation he felt afterward, but he can't make himself feel those things right now. It's as if they happened to someone else. But Tony sucking him off,
They were coming back from a water break, when Steve all of a sudden pushed him into the men's restroom and into the handicapped stall. He flipped the lock and pushed Tony against the wall, his forearms bracketing Tony's head. His face was close enough to kiss and Tony couldn't help it, his thoughts went there and his breath hitched and his heart started pounding.
“That’s one worthless piece of dead plastic,” Tony said conversationally.
And then the trial ended, but it didn't end. They won, and Steve was free to go and he did. But he didn't come to Tony.
For reasons unknown, the kittens seemed curious about the stranger in ways they had definitely not been curious about Tony and it was not a little bit irritating to see them gingerly venturing towards his outstretched hand. Once they had started sniffing his fingers, he gently scooped them up and rose to standing. Tony got a better look at him now. He was taller than Tony and probably a couple years older. He would have been classically handsome if there hadn’t been a gaunt look to his face, as if he had missed a few too many meals. His eyes seemed a little haunted in the way they would focus on Tony and then slide away, only to come back a second later. He could be a junkie, but if he was, he hadn’t been one long as far as Tony could tell. The man offered him the kittens. It was a strangely appealing sight. Big man, big callused hands, tiny balls of fluff looking deceptively innocent. Tony smiled but didn’t reach for them.
Tony sucked in a tiny breath and next to him he felt Steve tense up. Fury couldn't know, could he? Steve was sporting a neatly trimmed beard, his hair was slicked back and he wore sunglasses everywhere. Even if Fury had somehow figured out that Tony had found America's Supersoldier, the man currently guarding Tony's back looked very different from the old pictures of the clean shaven, all American poster boy for sleeping with your hands above the blankets. Of course, Tony would still pay half his fortune for thirty minutes under said blankets, but that was neither here nor there.
Finding Steve was easily the most depressing job Tony had ever had. And some days he was even counting pretending to build a big gun in a cave in Afghanistan with a hole in his chest among those. At least he'd had tools there, and a plan. The first village had not been a fluke. Everyone he faced as Iron Man either ran screaming or fell on their knees praying like televangelists. Asking if they'd seen or heard of a big blond dude with a star on his shield didn't produce any coherent answers and was therefore pointless.
help, they had to be pretty bad indeed.
Steve did. He carried Tony all the way to the bedroom and Tony didn't care if that wasn't a particularly masculine thing to have done to him. It put him in the perfect position to enjoy the friction against his dick as he clung to Steve, arms and legs wrapped around him. And Steve made delightful tortured noises as he endured Tony's sucking and biting on his ear while he clumsily tried to navigate the doorways. He intended to toss Tony on the bed but Tony stuck like a limpet and dragged Steve down with him. They took turns removing bits of clothing and each newly revealed bit of skin was greeted like a long lost friend.
“Sure you have, JARVIS. Now, Del, let's saunter, yes,
“Yeah? You think you can do that? You sure? Don't you need to practice? Why don't we practice? Right here. Nice dim hallway, perfect setting.”
"No, sir. Just visual. And I can't see their lips, so that is no use."
“Of course.”
and it seemed to kind of work, but not completely. The little spokes went stiff and the eyes went glassy, but the wheels still turned and the thing was everything but still. Steve was slowly being forced back by it and he started feeling the heat of the flames at his back. Just when he considered doing a drop and roll to get out from under the engine and let it crash into the fire, the cauldron lid slammed shut and the flames died. He could hear Tony’s voice casting a few quick spells and the acid stopped leaking and all the flying metal object came back together in the center of the room.
"You! That is Sir Percival's horse. Where is he?"
"That would be using your discretion, not mine."
On the small stage an elderly couple was butchering
Draco regarded the both of them closely, apparently reconsidering their outfits, then he smiled at Tony.
"You're the lord of the manor. He'll accept no substitutions."
Eventually Thistlethwaite huffed and got out his wand and Tony slapped Steve on the shoulder and said he’d go see Pepper and be back directly.
Steve deflated visibly.
"I, eh, I usually tell everybody who invites me that I have other commitments and then I spend a nice quiet day in my workshop with nobody bugging me."
Tony looked at him speculatively, his face expressive in ways Steve was unqualified to interpret.
A week after that, though, he got a letter from his late father’s lawyer. It stated that, because he was of age now, Obadiah Stane was no longer in charge of Tony’s trust fund and he had full access to his inheritance. Which was a mind boggling amount of money and stocks and real estate, and what have you. It took him by surprise. Of course, he had grown up rich, but he’d gotten so used to being poor the last four years, that this felt unreal. And he hadn’t expected this to happen until he was at least 25, or maybe even thirty. It seemed very unlike his father to actually consider him an adult at 21.
have been good to me, my friend."
“It's a good question, but not one the men in uniform would answer for me. I have my suspicions, but let me know what you think once you get to know him more
A couple of weeks later, he was pretty damn sure he didn’t agree. He was sitting sideways on his loveseat, legs thrown over the armrest while he was covered in cats. Thor was snoozing on his lap, Brucie had tucked himself under his chin and Clint and Tasha were climbing up his curtains. They were teenage cats now, all too long limbs and awkwardness and it wasn’t good for his curtains, but they were too funny batting at each other while trying to get to the top first, so he had decided not to care. Staring morosely at the stack of boxes in the middle of his floor, he tried to work up the energy to start collecting some of his shit to move into Bruce’s room. They had all helped Bruce move in with his girlfriend Betty in Leiden last week. He would stay there until his postdoc in Amsterdam started. Tony thought he’d most likely end up commuting, though. The housing market in Amsterdam was notoriously tight and he got the impression that Bruce was kind of done living an hour away from Betty.
"You're picking this up quick," Tony said. Another side effect of the super serum, Steve supposed. Which he couldn't say, so he settled for another 'uhuh'.
It was awesome. With cold blooded efficiency Tony turned his team of minions into cruel, backstabbing cheats. On the other side, Steve’s cohort was excellent at battle cries, but not much with the actual aiming of the snowballs. And in the end their hapless little armies mutinied, ganging up on the bigger boys and Steve and Tony were mercilessly buried under the remains of Tony’s illegal fort. When the kids had run off victoriously, Steve was left with a squirming and cursing Tony on top of him, snow in every orifice. Steve was helpfully wiping Tony’s face with his mitten, and Tony was slapping at his hands, when Steve became aware of the position they were in and how close Tony was. He’d only have to stretch an inch or two to be able to kiss him. Tony’s lips would be cold, but his tongue would be hot behind them and Steve wanted it so much that he had to roll over and dump Tony off to stop himself from doing it. Tony glared at him for the extra dunk into the snow, but that was okay. Much better than what Tony would do if Steve had given in to that impulse.
Tony takes the screwdrivers out of his mouth.
"Hey Steve! You want some chestnuts?"
"Call me Steve. How did you find me? Did Tony....?"
"It does, doesn't it?" said Tony, taking the kid's hand and speeding up the pace with which they were going down the stairs, to the relief of the rest of the group caught behind them. "But so do cat-snakes. What are your design specs?"
"I dunno," said Steve, scratching his abs, "I'll leave. Maybe the Fantastic Four need a Fantastic Fifth."
Slowly, Steve pulled away and hovered right above Tony's face, pupils blown and looking deliciously mussed up. Tony was about to protest again that he didn't need a fucking nap, when Steve said: “You know we'll still argue all the time, right?”
"Let me put it this way: Does anyone involved in this trust fund have the slightest notion of the results of these expeditions? Even if only how much metaphorical ground we have covered? I would imagine in 70 years we have explored quite a bit of ocean floor. Who decides where to look next?"
Tony was caught between feeling insulted on Steve’s behalf and a big fat wave of relief.
Tony made a face.
“Yeah. Next time. See you in a few days, right?”
“Stark? What do you want?” No welcome in the voice.
“What?”
. It had turned out that Steve barely grasped the concept of karaoke, couldn't carry a tune in a bucket and knew only a handful of songs if you didn't count his extensive knowledge of Glen Miller, early Sinatra and pre-war show tunes. Steve had been embarrassed at that and Tony irritated, but eventually both of them had realized at about same time that they were talking about karaoke as if they were planning the D-day invasion, and they'd cracked up. Still, if Sabbath Bloody Sabbath was out of the question, then Tony wasn't going to sing any fucking Bruno Mars or show tunes with Steve at Karaoke Night, thankyouverymuch. Dedicated late night browsing had turned up some Sinatra that would only require Steve to go 'ooooooh' in the back ground. Of course the ship's karaoke library did not have that one, but JARVIS had fixed that real quick.
Sailing a magic ship was a little boring, since there wasn't much to do and Tony found himself near the prow, leaning on the railing watching the smudge on the horizon that he assumed was their destination. The good news was that the Grail seemed to definitely be on this island and they wouldn't have to go island hopping along the Scottish coast. The way his heart was pounding in his chest right now even when he wasn't doing anything made it very doubtful he would survive that kind of extension of the trip. The bad news was that they still weren't a hundred percent sure the Grail would be their way home. Tony really didn't want to think about what would happen if it wasn't. He told himself firmly it was their best bet right now and he'd worry about other solutions when it was necessary. Not that there would many options for Tony at that point, but at least Steve would still have a shot and Tony would stick with him till the bitter end. And bitter it would be.
“I wouldn't go that far,” Fury offered after a pause, clearly puzzled by what he considered a non-sequitur. Rogers' look was totally blank.
"What the hell, Clint?"
“Drinks.”
“Alright. I guess. I'll take your word for it. Anyway, you've been deployed. You may not have done it, but you sure have heard about it. What do you know? What am I working with here?”
Steve scowled. “You have no fucking idea what you’re talking about, Tony. This isn’t even about you. It may or may not be just a fuck for you, and thanks for making that sound cheap and ugly, I kind of felt it was more than that. Whatever. But when I walk out that door you just roll your egocentric little ass over in your warm little bed until you’ve decided what you’re going to wear and what you’re going to have for breakfast. And what am
ready.
"Not that you're not attractive. You are, in a vaguely creepy sugar daddy kind of way. Better now that you aren't gray anymore, what were you
A few days later Steve and Percival found themselves being feted by a local lord, who wanted to know everything about their fight at the Maidens' Castle. After Percival's colorful recounting of their heroic deeds, there was much commiserating from the lady of the house on the atrocities suffered by the victims of the seven brothers. As if not to be outdone in the heinous crimes area, though, the topic eventually shifted to the imagined atrocities committed in the witches' castle two days to the east.
Tony thumped him on the chest, but it was obviously a happy thump.
"Wait a minute," interrupted Tony, "Back up for a sec. The Winter Soldier is Bucky Barnes? As in 'died tragically in WWII' Bucky Barnes? Holy fuck... Did Hydra catch him?"
Tony felt distinctly James Bond-like when they were marching off to dinner in their tuxedos, toothbrush tasers strapped to his lower legs. Corbin's tux wasn't the quality he was used to, but he'd live. The unanticipated upside of formal night turned out to be Steve in a tux. Del's was a little bit tight across his shoulders, but
Steve stared at Tony wearing his jumper. His jaw was clenching.
"Don't eat wild mushrooms unless you really know your shit."
Steve follows his gaze to the dead screen. It broke last year, and he hasn't gotten around to getting a new one. Or, more accurately, the idea of getting a new one had paralyzed him.
Tony almost leaned back, until he remembered the bench he sat on had nothing to lean back against. He settled for leaning his arms on the table instead. He looked at Steve.
Natasha smirked. "It'd be the charitable thing to do, don't you think? Then maybe they won't end up miserable failures."
"Don't worry about me, " Steve interjected, "They haven't caught on yet, by the looks of it. I'll be near the helipad when you get back. Maybe I can scope it out." Tony didn't answer, although the silence sounded disapproving all by itself, so he added: "Confirm, Stark. Or I am going to have to assume your communicator is busted, or out of range, or, you know, underground. And we wouldn't want that again, now would we?"
"You...." Tony started, "You're doing that on purpose."
Gawaine wasn't taking the lecture well. "I need to do no penance," he retorted, "We knights often suffer great woe and pain in the course of our duties. That should suffice. If you wish you can consider my escorting these ladies to the convent as my penance, but I will do no more. And as for finding the Grail, it's really not that special anyway." He turned to Steve. “We need another escort, now that Lancelot has left.”
" That was not the Captain America voice. That was all Steve. Sounding a little... panicked. He wouldn't..? Of course he would.
“Tony! Shut! Up!” It came out through gritted teeth.
"Yeah! My grandma says all those holes were for dead people and those are really small so they must have been for dead babies. They should make a railing here, so you don't have to touch the dead babies if you trip." The lady holding on to Steve's arm beamed up at him: "I did tell him that. Just to make sure he wasn't going to go climbing into one of those holes before he realized what they were. He still climbs onto the paper towel display shelves in the grocery store. It's a thing."
Tony kept glaring at the soap. “Don't worry, the others are back at the campsite, wrapped in blankets and eating soup.” Steve looked around him in surprise. He hadn't even noticed them leaving.
“It was about to take me over the cliff when I crossed myself, “ Percival answered, “Then it shook me off and burst into flame as it went over the edge.”
“Ah.”
I heard you sing that. Not sure I want to be a girlie, but nice to know you liked the beard."
"Oh geez. Suit up, Steve. There's your shield too."
"What the ever living fuck!"
be in the kitchen and to minimize his exposure to Steve, who was seriously starting to cramp Tony's style by being funny and considerate and earnest and adorable and unfairly fucking gorgeous. But how could Tony be expected to stay in the workshop when he could smell cookies? He briefly considered nailing his hand to the workbench with a screwdriver, like Jesus on the cross, but thought it might be considered a bit of an overreaction to imaginary cookies. Besides, that would be referencing the wrong holiday. And with his luck, Steve would be the one showing up with bandages and concern in his eyes and Tony didn't want to explain that particular 'accident' to Steve.
And with that Tony got himself an actual witch.
He sat the apple down on the workbench with a thwack and a comb tooth rolled away. Turning to Steve, Steve was once more caught in the pure intensity of Tony’s gaze.
"That was it!" said Percival in the sudden silence. "That was the question we were supposed to ask. I
Steve shook his head, busy wiping god knows what from his shield.
and believe you me, Del has had his share of threesomes. Probably not with women, I think he's gayer than that, but who knows... The point is, though... the point is that Del would not have been standing there like a blushing virgin like you did!”
“For fuck’s sake, Clint, stop being a douche. I’m taking the cat to my room out of respect for your allergies and you’re chopping the fucking vegetables like a decent human being or I swear to God you’ll regret it!”
“You? Me? Us?
Steve had never seen a house elf roll her eyes before.
“No… You know.”
“I’m good with wards, too, though,” said Steve, wondering if Tony’s assessment was true. It felt true. Mostly. “It just would have taken too long, considering the fact that you were being beaten to a bloody pulp by your diva motorcycle.”
you to talk science with me. You're.... You make me feel centered and... invested. I don't know how to explain it. You're like yoga or something. You make me feel better about myself. Shit, that sounds awful. But I don't think that would
"You're a fucking liar, Rogers." He heard Steve's sharp inhale. Then the man bit back.
“We should wash his clothes while he is in there.”
“I… what?” Steve looked from Rhodes to Tony, pleading. “Tony, what? You can’t-”
It turned out he didn't have to. Hidden behind a boulder was a path that went up a crag in the rocks. Steve wanted to weep with relief. A path meant there was something at the other end. Shelter of some sort. And shelter meant dryness and warmth. He prayed it would be more than an abandoned barn. Clothes, food and fire was what they needed. He picked his way carefully along the path, the evening shadows heavy and foreboding.
"Like Gawaine?"
He wrote and edited non-stop for a month. Then he and Yinsen picked a date for his defense in October and sent out the thesis manuscripts to the committee. And then he was done. There was nothing left to do but wait until the manuscript came back from the committee members, and then he’d have to send it to a printer. It was like swimming underwater the whole length of the pool and coming up to find everyone had left, him hanging off the edge of the pool, breathing hard, while staring out over the empty expanse of concrete. He didn’t know what to do with himself now that the project was finished. He considered traveling, or even gardening. He thought he’d probably ought to start a new project, but he was almost sure he wouldn’t take the postdoc position.
The next morning Steve wakes up with anger simmering under his skin. It's better than panic, but it's still uncomfortable. Steve hasn't really been angry in years. But now he's pissed off. At Tony. At himself. At all the freaky feelings he doesn't want to feel, but that just keep coming. He wants the wall back, but he knows at the same time that he shouldn't want that. Now that it's cracked, he knows the wall is bad. No matter how much safer is seems to be with the wall between himself and his feelings, it's not living. It's existing, but not living. He does his breathing exercises while he stares at the ceiling and the anger recedes a little. Gwenna puts her head on his hip and he unclenches his hand to scratch behind her ears. He's still on edge though when he gets out of the shower.
Natasha turned up next. A couple of days after Sam had left, Tony found her sitting at the kitchen table with Steve and Bruce as if she hadn't been gone for more than a year. They were having coffee and discussing..... food? Tony was a little hesitant to join them, since the food seemed to be a serious topic and it didn't look like they were waiting for his input, but reminded himself this was
Lancelot shook his head. "If they were commoners, maybe. But a lady's virtue and beauty are her only possessions of value." That was rich, coming from the man who was screwing his best friend's wife, annihilating her virtue in the process. But Lancelot was talking in generalities, not specifics, he supposed. And maybe he was on this Grail quest to better his life.
“Must be why their kids in Hogwarts keep trying to get me hooked on shit. Get the Stark heir in their pocket and dependent on them”
with every bit of wiring that comes out of the thing and he's on the verge of telling Tony to stop, just
Steve sat back on his haunches and watched Tony's labored breathing. The arc reactor was barely giving off any light and it seemed to dim a bit with every exhale. He wracked his brain about what else he could do to make sure Tony would survive, to make sure he would wake up tomorrow morning ready to bitch at Steve about the accommodations or some other inane issue. But there was nothing else he could think of doing right now and it scared the shit out of him that it might not be enough, that Tony might
“Honestly? Sitting here with my thumbs up my ass. Bored out of my skull.”
"Come on. Let's go! We need to catch him this time."
"No, it's the same! Like with you. You haven't had sex, so would you feel more comfortable being in charge when in bed with someone or would you be glad if someone told you exactly what to do?"
“Yes,” Tony said after a long pause that felt heavy with… something. “His name is Steve.”
Tony flinched back.
By the time Tony notices his approach, he's hammering in another thin steel fence pole.
wake up. He looked so fucking fragile and beat up, pale even in the firelight. With a shuddering breath he pulled himself together. He hung his own clothes next to Tony's. He really should have rinsed the salt out of them before he did so, but the pull of exhaustion was too strong. He carefully laid himself next to Tony, making sure not to jostle him and fell asleep instantly.
God, he'd been a fucking idiot. He stood up and dried his feet on the grass, before climbing back into the armor. He had no time to lose. He was going to need a dilapidated castle and some henchmen and he had to think of some appropriate prize to be wrest from the demon, and-
“I thought you were supposed to keep
“You didn’t see the Times Magazine article?”
idea!”
Tony liked keeping an eye on the defrosting of Captain America in the climate controlled room off his workshop and he wandered in and out during all hours as the solid block of ice slowly thawed. They had a decided on a slow defrost to avoid as much tissue damage as they could. It would be great if Captain America came out of his watery grave looking well enough to undergo embalming and be presented to the American public before they'd have the official interment with proper honors and ceremony. Tony wasn't sure yet if he would let Pepper handle that, or formally present the corpse to the US Military as a gesture of goodwill from Stark Industries (and maybe that would get congress to stop pressuring him to hand over the Iron Man suit for a while), but in the meantime he had decided not to tell anyone about his find just yet.
“Steve is Muggleborn, I’m afraid,” Tony would announce with a little relish, and the eyebrows would climb a fraction higher. One or two couldn’t or wouldn’t hide an actual sneer. Tony
"You could work for me. I need a bodyguard. It's a boring job in which you have lots of time to stand around and observe and think things over. I'd need you close by, so you can stay with me, and I'd pay you. Until you know what you want."
The demon looked at him intently. Now he was hermit shaped, but his eyes had elongated pupils and shone a sickly purple. Tony'd almost rather have him drop all human guise.
“Then you can't solve the problems of Black Widow.”
They shook on it, because that was the type of man Steve was and Tony felt a little bit better about himself just being in the presence of that kind of guy.
Steve shook his head.
Tony had a hard time parsing that sentence, distracted as he was by the sensation of Steve’s skin under his fingers.
“And then,” said Bors behind him, “The idiot spotted a lion and a serpent fighting on the beach and he decided we had to go help out the lion, because it was a nobler beast.”
. Don't you? You do. Oh my god, you really do." He turned and addressed the workshop at large, spreading his arms. "Tony Stark has feelings! For Captain America!" He started laughing and looked back at Tony. "Never thought I'd see the day, man. This is precious. Does Pepper know?"
....? the slashfiction? It eh... arouses her to see the gay men. She would like to watch... you." As his brain struggled to make the switch from Hydra to voyeuristic sex, Tony considered tasering the guy on general principle. For not being Hydra. And for making him feel stupid because he really should have seen this coming a mile away. It wasn't like he hadn't been propositioned with a smorgasbord of sexual permutations before, after all. Usually they were a bit more suave about it, but he'd run into the bumbling kind too. He gave Abdel a toothy grin, that the man seemed to take as a good sign. Which was a bit premature, because Tony was planning on having some fun with this first. Before he'd turn him down, of course, because he doubted Steve would be.....
“My name is Elayne, Sir.”
"What's wrong with this place?"
“Sam, don't sign off on anything until I've seen it!”
Steve took a deep breath.
“Then what the hell were you thinking?! You convinced yourself I wanted no part of you and you told nobody what happened between us and you were doing
"And what the fuck is wrong with jogging at a respectable hour, like, 11 in the morning?" Tony kvetched on.
“What do you mean ‘the one person’-?”
a good boy." And he slowly slipped his thumb into the wet heat of Steve's mouth. The sensation went straight to Tony's cock and when Steve curled his tongue around Tony's thumb and sucked it deeper into his mouth he had to suppress a groan. Oh lord..... He leaned forward and ghosted his lips along Steve's cheekbone, caressing it with his breath. Steve tried to turn his head towards Tony's mouth, but Tony would not let him. "Stay still," he breathed. Steve obeyed, except for continuing to move his tongue up and down Tony's thumb in a truly filthy fashion. Cheek to cheek with him, Tony lifted Steve bound hands and slipped one of Steve's index fingers into his mouth and gave it the same treatment Steve was giving his thumb. Steve moaned and the sound of it, so close to Tony's ear, gave him goosebumps. Tony could not remember the last time he had gotten this hard from just a bit of finger sucking but a quick look down proved that at least he wasn't the only one. The tent in Steve's pants showed that he was fully proportional and Tony salivated at the idea of getting his hands on that. He realized he could. Steve would let him. Steve would totally let him. Steve would also let Tony replace his thumb with his dick and fuck his mouth and the idea of that made a wet spot on his lounge pants. That would be way too much way too fast, but Steve would let him, because Tony had asked him to trust him. Tony knew instinctively that when Steve gave you his trust that meant to Hell and back, no questions asked. Which meant that Tony had to stop this, right here, right now, even though his dick was whining that it didn't wanna stop, ever.
"Listen. I am sorry if we forced you into this. I know you said you preferred being alone. We should have -"
He finds Tony. The man is struggling with a massive roll of orange fencing, hammer shoved into a loop on his cargo shorts. Steve wants to keep walking, pretend he didn't see him, to deal with the uncomfortable flutter in his gut somewhere out of sight, but there is no way he's going to be able to pull that off. Why did he have to go look for Tony? What the hell is he doing to himself?
"Fun?" Tony had a hard time wrapping his head around that concept in relation to cooking.
She scowled. “Why is this Sauron so important to you? Who is he?”
Steve ran back inside the barn, while yelling for Tony and Bors to get up. Bors was the first to grasp the situation and Steve sent him off after Percy, after he'd quickly saddled his horse. Steve helped Tony pack up to follow as soon as they could. He knew he could have gone himself and leave Tony with Bors to catch up with him later, but he rejected that idea as soon as it presented itself. He wasn't going to get separated from Tony again and, really, when push came to shove, he just didn't care about Percival's well-being as much as he did about Tony's. He saddled the horses and then loaded them up with the stuff Tony handed him.
Steve didn’t answer, just opened his arms silently and the next moment Tony launched himself across the limo and wrapped himself around the other man. He buried his face in Steve’s neck and Steve did the same to him, squeezing the breath out of his lungs. But that didn’t matter. Because Tony needed it, needed the physical reassurance that this was real, that this was Steve in his arms and he was allowed to touch him and allowed to talk to him and Steve still still wanted him. Still loved him. Steve’s shirt grew a little damp as the reality of that notion settled into Tony’s bones. Tony didn’t even care. Besides, his own shoulder was a bit moist too.
"Wow. I can't even imagine. That must get annoying." Of course, Tony immediately wondered if Steve had ever heard him jerk off in the shower. He sure as fuck hoped he'd never actually moaned Steve's name aloud when he did, he couldn't quite remember now if he had. Maybe he should check with JARVIS, just so he knew how much embarrassment he was entitled to.
Steve parsed that for a moment. “Beatles?”
"Right." He quickly cast his eyes downward and went back to work. As promised, he did Hawkeye next, then Widow, both Bruce and Hulk (that one was easy), Thor came out a little weird, but gingerbread Loki was awesome. He paid lots of attention to gingerbread Cap and it came out adorable. Tony surreptitiously took a picture of it. He looked around.
columns then. Good, Savage was a better Obi-Wan than Tony would ever be. He closed his eyes at the memory of how he had almost fucked up,
“Take good care of him.”
"Tony is angry with me." Steve didn't know why he was even talking to a complete stranger about Tony, except that it felt like such a relief to talk about him. To talk to somebody who knew him. He suddenly felt starved for information.
He wasn't in much of a hurry and he preferred the back roads, so it took him a couple of days to get to Bethesda. Once there he visited the parents and the boyfriend of the marine he had inadvertently killed. He was grateful they didn't kick him out in disgust and were willing to hear his apologies, but the visit wasn't comfortable for anybody, so he tried not to overstay his welcome. He left a check for half of the amount left in his account in the mailbox on his way out. He wasn't sure how well the military took care of the survivors these days, but it probably hadn't improved much.
It took Fury three days and four hours to get through, and that was a pretty poor showing. The SHIELD IT department was obviously a barren wasteland when it came to intellect. And Tony wasn't counting hours since he'd last seen Steve, he really wasn't, because that would be crossing the line between mildly obsessed and pathetic. And that he would never admit to. It so happened though that JARVIS helpfully supplied the hour count every time Tony barely even twitched an eye, because his fucking AI was moping too.
where you live!"
"Screw you, flying monkey, and your pop-psychology. If I'm not the Tin Man, and you're wrong about my heart, I'll have you know, very very wrong, just ask anyboy, then I am the great and powerful Oz."
Tony yawned and pulled his shirt over his head, exposing his leanly muscular chest and a trail of dark hair leading from his navel into his pants. Steve’s eyes widened and his mouth went suddenly dry. He quickly flipped onto his back, slamming a pillow down on his groin and fixing his stare on the ceiling, as Tony made his way into the bathroom.
“See?” Tony said to Entwhistle. “Next to him, it won’t be too- Oh, come off it, you two! I have no time for this. Guests are coming in less than an hour.”
"If he dies before his soul is properly tarnished by whatever impure thoughts that smoke is planting in his brain, I'll bet you're not going to get it. I'll bet the other side gets his soul then. The side with the angels and such. So if I kill him now, I would technically be saving his soul. By not killing him, his soul is mine to bargain with."
Natasha frowned at Tony.
He pulled back abruptly. Tony looked at him, questioningly, his lips swollen and red and it was the hardest thing not to kiss him again, immediately. Softly this time, maybe. But-
“Nope. Long gone. God knows where.”
“God fucking dammit!”
When he woke up the sun was much higher in the sky and yet, there was no sign of Steve and Percy. Something wasn't right. He pushed himself up to standing and walked over to the little chapel. He couldn't hear anything from inside the little building, but that would have been the case if they were still praying too. The first thing he noticed when he opened the door was a hint of a smell. It wasn't incense. It smelled a lot like sulfur but it was overlaid with something much sweeter. There was still no sound. When his eyes had adjusted to the gloom within the windowless little structure, he saw there was nothing inside. No altar, no pews and most importantly, no Steve or Percy. He cursed under his breath. There was no way they would have left him and the horses behind while he slept, so they still had to be here. Warily, he entered the building, on his guard for any undead creatures that might want to devour him.
By night time Tony's fever was going up again, despite the willow bark and his heartbeat was erratic. He wrapped himself around Tony again that night when he shivered and applied cold compresses when he sweated. He had bittersweet memories of his mother doing the same for him when he was a kid. He figured she must have felt the same kind of helplessness, watching him struggle for breath.
Around 8 pm the previous night's lack of sleep catches up with him and when he finds himself nodding off while reading his book, he decides to just go to bed. Gwenna has already relocated to the foot of the bed. Steve gets into a fresh pair of pajamas, since he sweated through the previous pair, and climbs into his double bed. Just when his head hits the pillow, the loud noise of an engine starts right under his window. He jack-knifes back up and swears. The hell?! Padding over to the window he realizes he is looking straight down onto the top of the trailer. There are some badly rusted spots on its roof and Steve thinks the goat man should be praying for the drought to last. The noise comes from a generator. Soft lamplight spills through the tattered curtains of the trailer's windows, so Steve's new neighbor must be home. He briefly considers going over to demand he shut down the noisy thing, but it's only eight pm and Steve doesn't like... confrontations. Then he considers moving to his mother's bedroom on the other side of the house, where he won't be able to hear it. He's considered it before; it seems weird to still be sleeping in his boyhood bed, while there is a perfectly fine California King bed with a pillow top mattress elsewhere in the house. It's not like she died in the bed, she died in a car crash. Still, he wasn't ready before and he isn't ready now. Cursing himself for his paralyzing inertia, he grabs another pillow out of the linen closet and wedges his head between the pillows to block out the sound. It takes him hours to fall asleep. At least he doesn't dream.
Steve had a question. One that he'd never thought Tony would answer, except maybe he had a feeling that if there ever was a moment he could ask it, this would be it. He mulled the pros and cons for a while. Then decided to go for it.
Steve pulls his hands away slowly as Tony releases his grip and holds them up in plain sight. Tony is wary, irritated. With Steve? With himself?  But then he smirks and maybe it's a little forced, but then he squeezes his ass muscles and Steve's dick is instantly back in the game. He wraps his hands behind his head to stop them from reaching out again, as Tony starts fucking himself on Steve. Maybe it's a good thing, the added awkwardness, as Steve alternately looks down at Tony jacking himself as he comes down on Steve again and again and up at the ceiling in desperation, needing to last longer. Needing to last because it feels so fucking good to be inside Tony. It feels phenomenal and he is pretty sure he is going to be disappointingly quick about it. He grits his teeth, biting back a groan, trying not to be consumed by the way his hips are rolling up, pressing him deeper into Tony's heat as the man slams himself down. Tony's breathing is getting loud and ragged and its fuel on the fire that is building in Steve. Too rapidly, too soon, but he can't. He can't make it last much longer.
Thor shrugged. "As far as I know, he speaks truth. I have no magic, but my mother always said spells can't be undone until they have played out as they are set."
They fought well together. Somehow Tony had known they would. Maybe it was all that exposure to Steve's tactical thinking as he had whispered Iron Man through missions, that made their cooperation flow so smoothly now. As if they'd been fighting together for decades. He knew almost intuitively what Steve was going to do next and the same seemed to be true for Steve. Tony was suddenly wondering why he'd been so adamant on being a lone wolf, before. This felt... good. Really good. Maybe they could still fight together occasionally once Steve was back in the role he belonged in.
“Sure.” It wasn’t that late, barely midnight, but post coital drowsiness pulled at him too. He maneuvered them under the blankets and it wasn’t long before Steve’s breath evened out, his head on Tony’s shoulder. Tony tried staying awake to revel in his closeness, but he passed out soon after, right before Kim Deal pronounced
"For fuck's sake, Rhodes! One: You're indoors. Two: you're in civvies and three: you outrank Steve. You can't possibly expect him to tell you stand down, it would go against all military protocol and that's, like, Steve's religion.
Steve flushed a little and quickly looked away.Tony tried to rein in his reeling head and refocus on the conversation, but Steve’s hand wrapped around his under the table and just like that Tony lost all semblance of coherent thought. Steve’s hand was warm and a little rough and it possessed the ability to make several thousand of Tony’s nerve endings sing at once. When Steve’s thumb rubbed a little circle on the back of his hand he thought he might spontaneously combust. His mind was spinning in circles. What did this mean? Was it the same as when they held hands the other night? It didn’t
"Just to be clear, I am not fucking you, Stark."
have been- on time to prevent this massacre.
"I swear Tony, if you break that man's heart, or if you drag him down to your level, I will end you. I know I am your friend, but if you fuck up my idol we are done. Got it?" He forced Tony's head up and down as if Tony was nodding voluntarily. "Say: Yes, Colonel Rhodes, I understand."
“I feel emasculated, Tony.” Steve tried for lightness as he swung his leg over the bitch seat, wondering if the bike could sense his ambivalence and balk at him. He was almost disappointed when it didn’t react.
“The arc reactor?”
"My contract is.... indefinite," Steve said softly, his fingers twitching, "They're never going to to let me go." That didn't make a lot of sense, but Tony was so busy jumping on the
"Okay, let's find out what happened here. Tether the horses and, Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan, carry Galahad's litter. We can't leave him until we know more." The boy still lived, but his fever hadn't abated.
Tony thought his smile might break his face.
There was more silence from under the bed and then the sound of a boot dropping to the floor.
Ten minutes later Tony had an entirely new appreciation of what had gone down in Washington last summer and a new found need to go point out a few holes in the story Maria Hill had told him when she came to work for him. The woman probably couldn't help keeping secrets, though, spending that much time with Nick Fury was bound to have left scars, but it was the principle of the thing. He made a mental note to sic J.A.R.V.I.S. on her to see what else she was hiding, First though... He pointed at Sam's wings.
"We should. June work for you?" Steve looked a little wistful as well, but Tony doubted it was him featuring prominently in Steve's daydreams.
So he found a back door and stepped away from it all. As he lost himself in the crowd he felt vaguely uneasy that maybe Tony was waiting for him. Well, maybe he was and maybe he wasn't. Steve hadn't heard from him in months, not since he'd watched Iron Man take off from the cruise ship. Not since Tony had not answered him on the com unit. But even if he was, Steve was in no shape to see him.
"No. I mean. I don't know. I need to open his armor. I need to make sure he can breathe. I don't now how it opens!" Steve was frantically running his fingers over the armor to see if he could find a latch of some sort.
"Yeah?" Steve asked, "What normal holiday things are you going to do, then?"
Arthur looked a little constipated, but Steve didn't care one bit. He was going to find Tony and get out of this place.
"Do you want to watch another one?" asked Tony, "Or are you going up too?"
The house elves must have brought Tony’s clothes to him in the bathroom, because he came out fifteen minutes later, dressed in clean pants and a thin shirt. Steve had washed up at the sink, gotten dressed and cleaned up the glitter in the meantime. He was rummaging in his trunk, looking for a jumper, when Tony spoke up.
Yikes. Has it really been 2 years?
Another shiver went through the body beside him.
.” His voice was so soft Tony barely heard it. Oh God.... Steve was still a virgin. Okay, okay. Deep breath. Regroup. Well, that explained the constipated faces out there, anyway. Tony was obviously going to go to hell for dragging out that little game. He closed his eyes and tried to think of the right words to say. Mess this up and they could kiss their cover goodbye. Steve wasn't so good an actor. He lifted his head and looked Steve in the eyes, his big, beautiful, blue eyes that looked so very vulnerable right now.
“Oh, Steve. Of course there is! Look, that lady over there in the jewel tones. What do her robes say?”
“Good… Oh, and Romanov? For fucks sake, don’t let him go clothes shopping by himself anymore. It’s a fucking disgrace SHIELD is letting a national icon go on tv in old man pants.”
?” That was Clint, of course. “I didn't hear that story. Did you hear that story?”
"Steve...."
Steve smiled widely.
She settled in beside him, gazing at the canal. She looked fresh as a daisy and her dress didn’t have a wrinkle on it. It wouldn’t dare.
? But the guys that weep for their lost loves when they come are the
“We were on patrol.” Tony had to strain to hear him. “Me and Bucky and the rest of our unit. And we got blown up. I got hit in the head with something and I was out of it for a while. When I came to, everyone was dead.. Bucky’s left arm was torn straight off. He was lying next to me, half over me, as if he was trying to protect me, still. We were friends since we were orphans together in Brooklyn. He was always looking out for me. Always backed me up when I got into stupid fights. Even followed me into the army when I insisted on enlisting... “ His voice was thick and it took a minute before he continued.
Steve can't think. His mind has gone completely blank, his blood is roaring in his ears. He can only look at Tony for a moment. And then his mouth floods with saliva and three hundred thoughts crash in simultaneously. It's bound to be bullshit. It's a lie that it doesn't have to be complicated, everything is complicated, especially Steve, but, oh dear god, he wants this to be true. How much he wants it scares him. And letting Tony that close scares him. Tony is a pushy, prodding, walking disaster, who has no fucking clue what he is doing to Steve and wouldn't care even if he did. And Steve wants him to do it to him. He wants Tony to push through his boundaries, to annihilate his objections, to shatter his peace of mind. He does, yet he doesn't. But he wants Tony's hands on him again so bad that he knows he's fighting a losing battle with his rational mind.
“Tony Stark.”
"We're screwed, aren't we?" said Steve, still laughing, and he turned his head to look Tony in the eyes. The moment stretched, Steve's smile slipping a little.
Later that night, after a successful defense and a properly lubricated dinner with all the scientific hotshots and well into a rousing party, Tony sought a small reprieve outside to catch his breath. The stone wall of the centuries old building they were in was pleasantly cool against his back and the sweat was cooling on his brow. He’d lost his bow tie ages ago, his shirt was half unbuttoned and the night air felt marvelous on his throat. He listened to the soft sounds of the canal water lapping against its brick sides a few yards away. A couple of laughing students on jangling bicycles took the corner with a blatant disregard for traffic rules. When they had gone, a soft voice said right beside his ear:
Steve nodded his agreement. Percival and Bors were too cold and exhausted to protest, and even Steve was tired. They all just followed Tony like little lambs. Steve couldn't help but wonder what the hell just happened, though. He'd thought Tony was still angry at him, but you didn't hug people you were angry with, except now it seemed like Tony was angry again.
"Whose idea was this?"
Tony lifted his head, interest piqued. "Internal clock? Serum effect? How precise is it? Did they ever test it?"
“Lady Morgaine. Are you having trouble with the Eye of Sauron?” She had made exponential progress in the time she'd been in the castle (all while running his household with an iron fist), and had rapidly become proficient at lighting up entire rooms. So they'd moved on to shapes. Tony was particularly proud of the Eye of Sauron he helped her create. He knew for a fact that Steve had seen and liked those movies, because he was a total Tolkien nut. Having that thing on top of a tower would be like a homing beacon.
"No. I mean. You should come inside. Cool off."
"That isn't fear, dumbass. That's... you know..." Tony flicked his eyes down to Steve's lips and then back up to the blue eyes that still stared at him without comprehension. "You're very close." Tony could tell when Steve connected the dots. He pushed himself away from Tony with alacrity and staggered back against the opposite wall, the diaper changing table hitting him in the ass. His cheeks were flushed and Tony bit back a sigh of disappointment. The good ones always had that deplorable gay panic thing going on.
"You know of him, then."
“Shush, you. He doesn’t need to know that. Steve, why are you still standing here? The vultures are circling.” Several men and women did seem to be on a glacial drift towards Tony’s corner.
, dammit!
"Yeah, yeah. You could drag your sorry carcass down and change the keg yourself, you know. You can do it. You taught me how.”
“I guess I am not going anywhere anytime soon.” Steve said it lightly, but Tony could hear the question behind it. It’d be impossible not to, considering Steve’s situation. He carefully kept his tone light as he answered.
When Tony opened his eyes he couldn't see squat. He was lying on his back on some grassy hill, looking up into a sky that was dark. The stars were obscured by a dense fog. Lovely. His fingers were still tingling a bit, but looking at his hand, he noticed that the glowy sphere was gone. He managed to sit up. Shouldn't leave the armor in the wet grass for too long. Titanium alloys didn't rust, but still. It just didn't seem like the wise thing to do. He tried a beam of light, but it just reflected on the mist. So that was pointless. Right.
"Tony! You're cold! I'm so sorry for dawdling. Here, take my jacket." He started shrugging out of it. Tony elbowed him.
"What are your plans?" asked Steve again, "Will you join us?"
“I can do that. I think I can do that.” He did not sound completely convinced.
The next day was Saturday, and when they left to meet Bruce and the others at De Wijnhaven, it felt like they were different people. Tony locked the door behind him and when he turned towards Steve, who was waiting for him a few paces away, hands in the pockets of the new jeans they had bought the day before and the rosy early evening light picking up the blonder strands in his new haircut, things were normal in a way they had never been before. Maybe, maybe they could do this, he thought.
Tony unwrapped the bundle on his pack horse that held his improvised saltpeter extraction device, to check on its progress. The bat guano would work when used in the raw, but if the saltpeter was leached out of it to be used pure, the resulting explosive devices would be much more powerful. He'd figured out a way to do it on the road, so they wouldn't have to stop for two days to process the bat shit, and that made the fact that their progress was being held up by these little encounters extra annoying. The sounds of metal striking metal came from behind him and he suppressed the urge to turn around and drool at Steve in action. It had become somewhat of an addiction, frankly, and one he needed to quit cold turkey. Another reason why these encounters were bad.
“Must have decided it wasn't worth his while or something.”
Steve forced himself to grab Tony by the hair and pull him off. Tony whined in protest. He looked dazed, his mouth a wreck, swollen and bruised. And Steve wanted him so badly he felt completely lost.
After the dishes, instead of picking up
Tony gestured expansively to his chest. "Moi? I am the soul of compliance compared to you."
"I think they’re dying to talk to you now." Tony grinned. "Probably want to know when you’re going to make an honest woman out of me. America’s Favorite Son can’t possibly be having premarital sex! Why, that’d be
"You can't, can you?" Well, well, wasn't that interesting.
"There is a lot of speculation still, Sir, and the opinions are divided between Captain America miraculously surviving his crash or his fathering offspring in secret before he died, but the link between Captain Rogers and Captain America has certainly been established."
"Oooh, you're right! Building stuff is like a mating ritual for Stark!" Clint crowed, and he continued in a deep David Attenborough stage whisper: "Here we see the rare Iron Stark with its remarkable red and gold plumage making its offering to its intended mate, the Blue Spangled Rogers. The Rogers is puffing up its star covered chest and flapping its arms, as part of the mating dance. This has never been filmed before in the wild! Any minute now, we'll see the Iron Stark respond to the mating dance by presenting its rear end for mounting..."
Rhodes rolled his eyes and Bucky guffawed.
"Because he likes you? That is generally why people send postcards and I don't get the impression he is all that deep."
Steve rolled onto his side to face Tony and gently cupped his cheek with his hand. Tony's eyes were black pools in the dark of the night.
Tony decided to go with sarcasm rather than outrage. “Gentlemen! Welcome to my humble abode! To what do I owe this pleasure?”
.....
Elaine led them to a large room that Steve immediately recognized as Tony's make do workshop. It was nothing like his workshop in the tower, of course. For one thing, it was lit by torches and there were no robots zooming about, but it had Tony's stamp on it nonetheless. He cleared a space on the giant table that was positioned in the center of the room and laid Tony down. There was still no movement and the light from the arc reactor was weak, though stable. Steve resumed his efforts to open the armor. Elaine was watching him from a small distance, but when he looked at her she just shrugged. No help there, then.
to kill yourself?!"
any of them?”
“Yes, Master Stark, everything is on schedule.”
"Humor me. What would happen if we found Captain America alive and well?"
Immediately something dark and rotting and vicious came snarling out of it and threw itself at Steve and Percival. Tony had no idea what it was. His nerdy knowledge base was much more scifi oriented than geared towards undead creatures, because the latter didn't come up with many interesting or even interestingly ridiculous ideas, so he found them kinda boring. And he obviously hadn't played enough AD&D in his days to figure out if this was a lich, or a zombie or a wraith or a ghoul or whatever. Whatever it was, it was fucking fast and seemed determined to claw someone's eyes out. More worryingly, it didn't seem to be affected much by the steel of the swords. It clearly didn't feel any pain and it refused to drop limbs that should have been severed by the force of the two knight's blows.
“I bet. Remember Bruce said the same thing. When he wasn’t throwing plates because everything annoyed him.”
"I am trying not to. But I do wonder why you'd want to spend so much time going to parties and dating supermodels when you could be a full time member of the Avengers." Steve uncrossed his arms and put his forearms on the table, interlocking his fingers. He leaned towards Tony. There was something very close to wistful in his eyes. "I would think being an Avenger would be worthy of more of your attention and, yes, commitment." Tony relaxed a bit. This wasn't about him so much, apparently, as it was about Steve, who was.... almost jealous, it seemed. He leaned forward too. Another couple started in on
Tony wasn’t so sure he agreed beyond the scientific aspects of it.
"You can see contact lenses from this distance?"
The hermit started orating about the Old Religion and the New Religion and the serpent representing the Old Religion and about how the lady in black had apparently been the devil and Tony tuned him out before he'd said more than five sentences. He looked sideways at Steve, who was listening with more or less rapt attention. It was hard to believe the man had kissed him yesterday. Twice. And that it was the second kiss, and not the first, that had him feeling off-kilter today. The first one was easy, that one had been lust, pure and simple, nothing wrong with that. Beautiful, wet, naked man in a river, who would pass up
"Cat's out of the bag, I figured," shrugged Steve. "The internet will have figured it out by now, right?"
“So you left him and came here?”
fine, really. Let it not be said that Tony was obstructing Freedom, Justice and the Captain American Way. And the man did have a suite of rooms here, even if he'd never used them.
Then Tony licked his lips and it broke something in Steve.
“Her number is unlisted, sir.”
“Thanks for telling me.” It was the only thing he could think of to say. Steve nodded his head unhappily.
"Okay. Let me rephrase the question. When is the last time you were even mildly emotionally invested in Christmas?"
"Steve Rogers sent you all these cards? As in
“Yes!” Tony beamed, then dimmed the wattage when Steve frowned at him with comically downturned eyebrows. “No. Not really. But it’s a good start! Proves that we still want each other and then, afterwards, we can communicate properly and take it from there.”
Steve Rogers. Surely you've heard that he's been defrosted. You can't have missed the
"Alright. I can do that." He threw his arms around Thor and went for a godly volume as he bellowed in return: "Welcome to you and yours, friend Thor! Merry Yuletide to you all. Let's pass the wassail and drink to everyone's health!" Thor pounded him happily on the back while everyone started cheering as if this was some momentous occasion and Tony really needed to start hanging out with different people if this qualified as a cheering opportunity. Then Thor called for the Wassail Bowl, by which he apparently meant the soup tureen, and poured about half a gallon of the hot, sweet, spicy and above all alcoholic concoction down Tony's throat and after that everything was pretty much a blur. A blur with an astounding amount of singing in it.
Oh, blessed innocence.
“Isn't it her husband's task to rescue her?”
Tony looked down at his cargo pants and his black wife beater and raised a quizzical eyebrow at Steve, who flushed a little.
next to him. Steve yelped in shock as the bike crashed down and the jagged piece of machinery tumbled right after. He took a shaky step backwards and when he felt the wall through his sweat soaked shirt, he slid down it until he was seated on the floor, yanking Tony down beside him. For a moment they just sat there, panting, Tony leaning heavily into Steve’s shoulder. The moisture of his breath tickled the hair on Steve’s arm and Steve repressed a shiver.
“This is going to look really good,” she said at last. “You have great hair.”
“Oh yeah, I know that one. I believe that one says ‘Come fuck me through the mattress. Now!’ In fact, it reminds me of the time when Draco-”
“Sir, if Del Porter is just there for...” He hesitated.
Watching Tony buy a questionable assortment of electronics was less than enlightening.
“Don't worry, my master has me under perfect control.” Tony made JARVIS say. He sounded like Tony had kicked his puppy.
"I know," Steve said quietly, "I wanted to go alone. We've had a lot of company and it's been wonderful, but it was good to have a break." He took another sip of milk, then added in a softer voice: "Sometimes it is better to face your ghosts alone. Or at least surrounded by strangers who don't know your story or what you've lost."
If Steve thought the noises Tony made at his oven were bad, they pale in comparison to the near orgasm he has when he is actually eating the apple crumble a la mode. It's very good, Steve knows this on an intellectual level, but all his brain space is occupied by trying (and failing) not to picture fucking those same grunts out of Tony as he's bending him over the kitchen table. He doesn't taste a thing.
. He'd made sketches of Tony at work, and he'd worked out, which had been completely distracting and sex had been inevitable after watching him do a zillion push ups with no shirt on. He'd made sure Tony was fed at regular intervals, he had listened to Tony rant with apparently infinite patience and had made sensible suggestions now and then, which showed that he was actually listening and could tell when Tony went off on unrealistic tangents. Now, standing next to him at the railing Tony realized he wanted this. This closeness and familiarity. This sense of Steve being by his side and staying there, because he belonged with him. Belonged to Tony. It was crazy, but somehow not as crazy as it had seemed even just a day ago.
“What happened?" shouted the angry pixie, "What happened is that you should never have let that sniveling twat go when she wanted to go home. When she said it must have a been a mistake. I told you she would stir up trouble. I told you she was going to make up some horror story about us god forsaken witches and the things we get up to. I told you she'd be back with her whole damned village in tow!" She paused for breath while Tony struggled to a seated position, pieces of armor rolling every which way. He didn't seem aware of Steve's presence yet and ended up with his back to him, facing the angry woman. She continued. "And lo and behold, the entire damned village shows up, frothing at the mouth, with pitchforks and shovels and you can't even get into the air anymore to scare them off! How the hell were you planning on stopping them? By annoying them to death like you do me?!"
“Isn’t Clint really allergic to cats?”
Now Tony looked up. And grinned.
Tony looked at Steve.
"I am also going to cross cats with snakes, so I can have a furry snake that purrs... But that chairlift sounds kinda cool."
"Good. Excellent." Tony started to scramble onto his feet. "Do you want the front side or the back side of the China Barn menu?"
“Did you tell him you’re the savior of the wizarding world and I’ll hex his feet off if he doesn’t stop?” Draco stage whispered.
“They're sullied,” agreed Gawaine. “Nothing to it. They'll need to join a convent to repent.”
"You were not cleared to leave the hospital, Tony. One of these days you are going to stop making me complicit in all those harebrained schemes that end with you nearly killing yourself."
"Where is he?" Natasha sounded deceptively pleasant. Loki turned up the wattage of his grin.
the experiment, but how long before they realized Tony wasn't Corbin? How long before they found out they had snagged Iron Man instead? It would be obvious a soon as he was forced to take his shirt off. Would they kill him or was he worth more alive? Probably depended on how much they needed money. Steve hated the fact that Tony's life depended on a Hydra bookkeeper and he picked up the pace a bit.
He wasn’t sure if the swoop in his stomach was fear or something else.
Daylight came and Tony woke with a start, disoriented and wondering why the hell he had slept in the armor in wet grass. Then it all came rushing back and he knew he slept in the armor precisely because the grass was wet and he had no blankets. He'd stayed up for hours alternately wondering why he was here instead of Sam, worrying about Steve's well being and plotting Loki's slow and painful demise. It had been spectacularly unproductive and eventually sleep had won over the need to keep the armor pristine. Now he sat up and looked around him. The fog had lifted only a little, but there was some watery sunshine coming through the wisps and visibility was dramatically improved over last night, even if it wasn't one hundred percent yet.
Tony glanced up from his tablet. "Good morning, Sleeping Beauty. Coffee is ready if you want it." He seemed preoccupied.
With considerably less enthusiasm he made his way to the table. It was going to be a long, lonely three weeks.
“It seems a little extreme,” Steve admitted.
"No. No, Steve, stop. It's not that. It was fun. It was fine. It was totally fine. It's just - I'm just -"
All of a sudden it hit him. What the hell was he doing? How ridiculous was it to try and keep four cats on twelve square meters? Fifteen, once he moved into Bruce’s room.
Tony didn't expect Steve on Monday or Tuesday, but by Wednesday he started to get a little restless. He drowned himself in work and played with his cats, who were really quite cute when they were not a pain in the ass. And even then they were more funny than anything else. Thursday it was worse and he told himself not to be ridiculous. On Friday he thought he saw a flash of the white kitten with the orange ears before he started his shift at De Wijnhaven and he knew in heart that Steve would show up that evening.
“Hitchhiking.”
"Thor is here to sing to my orchards?" Tony asked flatly. He wondered what the hell had happened to his relatively uneventful life of three weeks ago. "Do I even have orchards?"
Tony held out a hand to Steve to help him up that he didn't need, but took anyway
He tried getting back to his exercises for a good thirty minutes, but questions and doubts kept intruding. And so did the need to
Steve tried. He was pretty sure the shoes would disintegrate if he cast one more
They got into position. Steve held out his left hand and Tony draped his right hand over it. Tony's other hand rested on his shoulder and Steve got to rest his on Tony's waist and that was nice. The Quickstep was a fairly lively affair with a simple base step they learned to add some variations to. Initially it was a bit confusing with the steps and the rhythm, but it got a little better when JARVIS offered to keep count. JARVIS kept on a steady drone of 'slow, quick, quick' while Steve kept looking down at his feet to make sure he wasn't stepping on Tony's toes.
Steve watched him in silence as he clunked away in the armor.
"Nope. No. Not using the company account. Thank you, Pepper. See you at 4."
"What?"
"Oh look, Antonio Banderas is in charge, " Tony whispered, nodding to the Hispanic man with long wavy hair who was currently welcoming everyone, "That is a bit of a cliché." Steve knew better than to say 'who? 'or 'what?
“Okay. Not much further west you can go.” They had reached the front door and Tony started digging for his key. “Couple dozen miles and you’ll hit the North Sea. You could head south a bit to Hoek van Holland and catch the ferry to Britain. That what you’re planning to do?”
“Why don’t you move your stuff into Bruce’s room instead?”
"JARVIS! Get the Mark VIII ready. Get me the Captain America suit and did Natasha deliver the shield?"
Steve let some of his frustration bleed through in his voice.
“I don’t know if that is the best or the worst idea in the history of the planet, Tony.”
So Tony took Steve home for the second time in two days.
“Fine, we’ll catch up later, Tony. Nice to meet you, Steve. Way to go!”
“Tony...” he breathes.
“Granted!”
“I’m so glad you’re all supportive,” he announced. “And I want you to know it’s not for lack of trying…” There was a new round of laughter and a little ‘oh’ from Darcy and Steve lobbed a coaster at his head. “...but I was actually talking about my cat called Steve, who managed to get knocked up before I managed to catch him… her, a couple of days ago. He... she is going to be a teen mom and while I blame society and not her, God forbid,  anyone who wants a kitten in a couple of months, let me know.” Then he said back down and raised his glass to everyone, which was met with ‘Cheers!’ all around.
The voice came from Bucky’s bed, but it took Steve only half a second to wake up enough to realize it wasn’t Bucky who’d spoken. Even if it was common enough for Bucky to wake up with that exact phrase on his lips. He flipped over in bed and smothered a grin at Tony’s affronted look as he took in the red and gold bed curtains. He had a spectacular case of bedhead, made worse by the copious amounts of glitter that were still embedded in his hair.
Tony met the empty gaze of the armor with a flat look, refusing to correct himself.
“I’m saying that, unless you actually believe you can transform one kind of matter into another, all your transfiguration spells are going to come out as jacked up illusions.”
“No!” Tony interjected. “I mean, I need the Eye of Sauron.”
Tony and Steve had a brief argument in Florrie's rose garden about whether they should let Percival come with them or not. Tony actually didn't see the point of dragging the man along, now that they knew where they were going. It'd be tricky and tiring to have to keep up the pretense of being anything other than Medieval dudes for Percival's benefit, so why not ditch him? Steve flat out refused saying he had promised a guy named Bors to keep an eye on him. And he wanted an extra sword to guard Tony's back now that he didn't have the suit.
“About ten minutes,” Steve mumbles to his placemat, hastily shoving a forkful of food in his mouth.
"It's weird," said Steve and hey, there was that blank look from earlier at breakfast again. It was like they were trying to outblank each other right now. Tony wondered what that actually meant about the contents of Steve's thoughts. Probably just junior high school type embarrassment about his lack of experience, more was the pity. "We've met several hermits already on the way here and they seem to know things they can't possibly know, like your name, and- " Steve swiftly changed tracks. "Lancelot said they're considered the mouthpieces of God and one always had to do as they bid." He shrugged like he had a hard time buying it, but wasn't convinced it wasn't true either.
"No more unicorns for you," said Tony, rolling into Steve's side and catching his eyes. Steve smiled at him widely, feeling warmth pool in his belly as Tony smiled in return. He slid his fingers into Tony's hair and pulled him closer. "You expect me to ride into battle on an ordinary horse now?" he muttered, faux put out. "Well," Tony whispered back, "I know this budding geneticist that could probably make you one with fangs and maybe a scorpion's tail and.... " Kissing was an excellent way of shutting Tony up, Steve had noticed.
Behind him he heard his bedroom door click shut. Not knowing what to do or say, he steadfastly continued what he was doing. A moment later Steve’s hands landed on his shoulders and a voice spoke softly by his ear:
Steve tried really hard not to imagine what that would be like, to ride that sleek monster seated behind Tony, with his arms wrapped around the smaller boy. Flying through the winter nights, with the wind in their faces, chasing the moon. He failed spectacularly.
“And yet, Pepper is arguably more your creation than you are Howard's. Tony, the man donated a sperm cell, he didn't
“Oh, he probably likes it, but he doesn’t want his father to think he does, so he won’t get cut out of the family’s potion business. See, that is his father over there, in almost identical robes. I bet our friend has fun in all kinds of unsavory ways on the sly, though.”
“Hell, yes! Nothing better. Nothing better than getting the orneriness fucked out of me. God, Steve, the way you would be able to hold me down and just make me take it... to make me forget what I was angry about and to make me beg for you instead... ungh!”
Then he hot wired the contraption into the arc reactor.
Natasha shook her head. "I don't think so. I'm thinking it's Falcon too." She turned back to Loki. "How do we find out who can go get him?" Loki unearthed a glowing globe about the size of a tennis ball out of a pocket. Its blue light was pulsating steadily, as if it had a heartbeat.
"Pepper! He hasn't sent me a card in three days!
Tony went to see his aunt Peggy in a nursing home somewhere on the Eastern Seaboard. Pepper didn't understand why he needed to bring his bodyguard along on that particular trip and insinuated that surely he could keep it in his pants for a day or two while visiting his father's elderly friend with Alzheimer’s, but fortunately she insinuated it in such a classy way that Steve still didn’t realize that she thought Tony was fucking him.
“Okay, Del. We're getting a bottle of booze at the tax free shop and we're going back to the cabin and then I guess I am going to give you a primer on Other People's Kinky Sex Lives 101, so you won't be struck dumb if it ever comes up again.” And we're very much not going to talk about what just happened, he added silently.
Steve had fallen silent. Still glaring at Tony, though. Glaring hard. The suit looked great on him, Tony noticed, even now that it was wet and steaming in the winter air. He'd have to build something into it that made it dry faster.
to go to bed.”
He was so successful at the last that Howard cut off all his funding to try and force him to come home. It didn’t work. By the time the credit card stopped working, Tony had already paid the ridiculously low tuition and one of the PhD students that ran a lab Tony was in had taken a shine to the new kid and got him a job with his uncle who ran Cafe De Wijnhaven. Tony worked his ass off all day, bussed tables and changed kegs in the 17th century beer cellar under the bar at night, and got a share of the tips on top of his minimum wage. And he bought a bicycle off a junkie to get around town with.
Tony dove in the shared pantry and found a can of tuna with Natasha’s name on it in permanent marker. He grabbed a can opener and a saucer too.
tight. Gotta open you up, babydoll.” He spreads Steve's cheeks apart.
“I am not even half as dead as I was two weeks ago, Pep. I am a paragon of health, relatively speaking."
"Hey, Clint, can you make me a gingerbread man with wings? I need to do Falcon."
"Okay, okay, I get it. I should have had a better plan. You can stop now."
“Shut up, Stark!”
“Sure. I think it was her deciding that he wasn’t worthy of your, or anyone’s attention, more than anything else. That’s how we found out. She was telling Jane all about this smelly homeless person who came to the door last week and rang her doorbell. Don’t worry, Natasha already reamed her out for being a judgmental little bitch. It was brutal. But you gotta admit he can look pretty rough, man. Anyway, he was here Tuesday last week. Thought you’d oughta know.”
"As long as we're sharing," said Natasha with a small smile, "I am Russian Orthodox and all we need is vodka to make it a holiday. Any holiday. But not any vodka. None of that horse piss they drink over here."
"Airco," Steve blurts.
“Yes, like that,” Steve answered too quickly. Tony wisely shut up as Steve started pulling him towards the exit. He couldn't help giving Natasha a little finger waggle wave and a shit eating grin as he passed her, though. He didn't know what he had won, but he could tell he had won
“What the
“I tried to tell him that you wouldn’t be flying witnesses out here and such for his sake if you had moved on, but he seems to think you’re just that kind a person.”
“Just the one. And he more or less rescued himself, really.”
"Couple of years ago. Pepper dragged me to a holiday party, I think."
"You look fine. Your hair is long." So was Tony's. And his Van Dyke's was longer too. "But you haven't lost any muscles, praise be." He continued. "Care to lose the chain mail and get comfortable? I have lots of questions, dude."
"Do that and you'll be sure to damn his soul to hell."
“Fine. I can go tell him myself soon, anyway.” And with that she swanned out of the room.
“Now I am ready for a nap,” he admitted. Steve straightened his clothes and made a face at his shirt. Then he pulled it off and made to get off the bed.
. The houses around the square looked.... really rickety. Was this some sort of museum village? Had he crashed a Ren Faire? The only new looking building was the church, which was in Anglo-Saxon style, and it looked very fresh and sturdy. In fact, it looked brand spanking new instead of a thousand years old...
“For god's sake, Rogers, stand the fuck down!” Stark hissed furiously. “Can you
"You said the bees wouldn't sting!" came Percival 's voice.
“It’d go a lot faster if you stopped eye fucking each other,” suggested Clint helpfully.
"Tony. Shut up. Listen." Steve paused. Apparently to make sure Tony was following orders. Tony bit his tongue and tried. "Tony. You triggered some memories... that song got to me, that is all. You meant well and that makes it alright. Stop beating yourself up when things go wrong despite your good intentions. As long as you try to do the right thing I will cut you a lot of slack, like
“‘S not evil. Just angry.”
The man smiled. "Orders from Ms Potts, sir. I have been told to report at all the ports of call of the
“You. You’re a matching pair. Just the other day, he was like-” Barnes gave Tony exaggerated puppy eyes and continued in a whiny voice that sounded nothing like Steve at all: “I don’t know, Buck, it’s been three months, I can’t assume he is still interested in me. He’s handsome and smart and rich, why would he wait for me? I am such a basket case.”
“How do I..... How do I be Del?” he finally managed, much more uncertain than he wanted to sound. “I don't have a clue how to do this.” Stark sighed and bowed his head again. He let go of Steve's shirt and that felt a little bit like a loss, but then Stark started smoothing out the wrinkles he had left in the pink -no, salmon- polo shirt and that was good. Yeah, that was really nice. Of him. That was nice of him. It took him a moment to realize Stark was talking again.
"Hamburg is more north than east of here. And you can hitchhike that in a day, with a little luck. He must have come from way east, to end up looking like he does. What is a Brooklyn boy doing that far out?"
“Please tell me nobody kissed me.”
"You pimped me out?"
“This is a nice town,” said Steve. “Kind of small, though. Are there any big towns close by?”
"Put lots of cheese on top. And breadcrumbs!" Tony plops himself on the couch and picks up Steve's book with a disdainful look on his face.
“Please,” panted Steve, “Better angle if you do it.”
Steve turned to go, but paused by the door.
Nothing happened.
The first raft he'd gotten to was the one Clint had shot and it had been sinking rapidly. Two of the men had already boarded and were guarding the entry point in all directions, except up. So Steve had maneuvered silently until he was right above one of the guys and dropped on top of him. He'd heaved him over the side by time the other man had turned around and there had only been a brief scuffle before that guy went flying. The grappling hook was severed without much problems and that had taken care of that raft. He'd repeated the procedure with the second raft he came to although the fight was more satisfying, because this raft had managed to land six of the men already. Still a piece of cake though. The third raft he'd got to had already unloaded though and all the occupants had disappeared inside the ship. That is when Steve had looked up himself and had spotted the goons standing on a balcony that he assumed was his and Tony's, so up he'd gone and taken care of those.
. He can barely parse what Tony is saying. Frustration flares into irritation.
“That’s why he wore what he’s wearing. It’s shockingly modern. As a muggleborn I don’t suppose you see the significance.” He said he neutrally, as if Steve’s ancestry was of no interest to him, and that was the only reason Steve didn’t stalk away.
“Last week? When? Why didn’t you call me then? Did you tell him where I am?”
Tony turned and took a step towards the alley exit and then stopped cold.
“You think?” Tony was torn between ‘yes, of course’ and ‘is that overstepping his boundaries?’.
the part, Captain Boytoy.” Steve sucked in an unsteady breath. Stark was very close and very angry and that was very... wow. It took him a few seconds to realize that Stark seemed to expect an answer.
“Damn straight,” Steve bit out and stalked off towards their cabin.
“Yes, you do. You’re wet and shivering. Besides, Bruce will get angry if you don’t.”
“Fuck, Rogers, it smells like sex in here!” Bucky exclaimed before he was even seated. “Aw man, look at you.” He gestured at Steve’s everything with his good arm. “Have you no shame?” Rhodes just looked disapproving.
His mom was always exasperated by the burdens Steve took on out of what she called a misplaced sense of guilt, and he knows this, but yet again, Steve can't
“Yes?”
Things were off in the weeks after Steve left. Part of it was that Tony felt ashamed about how he’d lashed out after misunderstanding what Steve had been trying to say. It wasn’t like Steve hadn’t told him how it felt for him, that evening they had sat on the couch. And still Tony hadn’t even considered that angle and had gotten really bitchy. Somehow, he’d convinced himself that everything was normal now after they had had sex, because he cared about Steve and that must have made everything magically alright. Or something. He blamed Meg Ryan movies for that one. But mostly himself.
I..... Yeah..... How did you know?" Steve thought she looked like a porcelain doll, if porcelain could be as hard as titanium. Her words were scalpels performing precision surgery.
"You can not break your word and forfeit one quest in favor of another, Sir Gawaine. You can go look for this Grail, but you can not swear that you will complete the quest. When the time comes to meet the Green Knight, you must abandon your search and fulfill your word." Gawaine turned to smirk at his brother and for a moment Steve thought he might stick out his tongue at him. Arthur looked up and noticed the newcomers by the door. He hailed the men gathered there.
“I got mine in Leiden, but Rotterdam is closer. I’ll pay for the rental, but you gotta go get one now, or you won’t be back in time.”
The cat slunk a little closer and carefully sniffed Tony’s fingers. Then it finally started eating the little bits of kibble. Tentatively, Tony stretched out the fingers of his other hand and scratched him softly between the ears. Steve produced a stuttering purr, but didn’t stop eating, so Tony slid the hand under his belly and slowly stood up. The treats were gone now, but Steve was still nosing his hand looking for more and he didn’t struggle. By now, Tony had plenty of knowledge of how cats liked to be held and he fitted him comfortably in his arm, while keeping up a soothing stream of whispered promises, while Steve licked his hand with his raspy tongue.
"Are you not sworn to protect the innocent? What kind of a knight are you? Your pathetic failure to live up your chivalric oaths on a daily basis does not--"
he muttered.
He said turning back to Steve. Sliding off the table, he dislodged a piece of the armor that clattered to the floor. Tony winced.
“I am an optimistic man. Hey, Harry, could you help Steve decipher what Tony’s choice of clothes is trying to say?”
Later that night Tony fitted his new vibranium powered arc reactor in his chest and got a new lease on life. JARVIS congratulated him. No one else was there.
"Well..." Loki hedged. After another squeeze from Thor he added: "Someone can go after him. Then both of them will be able to come back together."
Tony dove under the bed where he kept the suitcase and dragged it out. He had it open and assembling when Steve entered the room through the sliding glass doors. Tony stared at him, couldn't help it. It was like that time he'd come to Tony's rescue in the catacombs but with the intensity cranked up to a hundred. He was magnificent and beautiful and he was grinning at Tony like Tony was the prince in Sleeping Beauty that had woken him up, and he was just so very happy to be back among the living. He was also a complete fucking stranger. Well, maybe not complete. Tony could see the shape of the Steve he knew, but it was like the Picasso version of Steve. Tony searched for words, but couldn't find them. Nothing to connect him to the Steve he.... The faceplate clicked into place and then the issue was moot.
year's KENZO swimwear?” Pouty princess went extremely pouty at that point, but was apparently smart enough to know a lost cause when she saw one and beat a retreat. Tony guided Steve back to the lounge with a hand on his ass, just in case she was watching. She was. And boy did that feel good. Steve's ass too.
or something equally disastrous. So he startled a little when he felt Steve's hands on his biceps, warm and solid. Steve was now standing behind him, not crowding him against the bench or anything, giving him space. Maybe Steve was more comfortable not looking at him while talking either. The thingamabob he was holding clattered onto the workbench.
"I have more things to do than cater to your little snit."
"It wasn't like that!" Tony disagreed. "I wasn't thinking with my cock, lady. I was thinking I didn't have the right to hold her prisoner."
“What are you doing?” Steve whispered close to Stark's ear.
"Exactly!" Tony grinned. "Now let's find another taxi, some decent food, and then we can take the afternoon off. As long as we're back on the boat by 8 pm, we're good. JARVIS!"
Steve had reached the chopper and stood wide legged, hands on his hips, his hair flying in the wind of the chopper blades.
they are going to have problems with."
“Not really my thing,” Tony smirked back.
The kittens were nosing around a dead sparrow, exactly where Steve had indicated they would be. The white and orange one spotted them first and took off like an arrow. That one was going to be a problem, as skittish as it was. The white and black one stood his ground for a bit. It hissed and puffed up its tiny tail, but when Steve squatted and stuck out his hand to try and grab it, it ran through Tony's legs and was lost in the shadows a moment later. Tony cursed his own slowness. He shouldn't count on Steve's skills, thinking they were infallible.
Steve is panting with the strain of
Steve reached out for Tony’s hand and drew him closer. His other hand cupped Tony’s jaw and Tony couldn’t help but press into it. Steve kissed him softly, a barely there pressure of lips that made Tony’s heart seize nonetheless.
Steve doesn't know how much he wants to admit. Tony isn't interested in his issues, he made that very clear. But still, he asked. He notices with surprise that he can answer without getting wound up again.
Christmas Eve was a very subdued affair in the tower. Thor and his entourage had left all bleary eyed in the morning. Falcon had dragged himself out of bed at noon and left for his aunt's house. Everyone else was barely mobile by the end of the afternoon and still a little green around the gills. Everyone except Steve, who was fine, unsurprisingly, but he was kind enough not to rub it in. Bruce made a light soup for dinner to cater to the delicate state of their stomachs and they watched
“Hey Phil. What’s up?”
“Possession is nine tenths of the law. Elisa seems to think they might not even fight you for it now that you have it back.”
It had been close to a week of this odd camaraderie when Steve considered throwing in the towel on his most recent assignment. It was nearly 11 at night anyway, he was so tired his focus was shot, and the fucking comb just would not transfigure into a real apple. It looked like an apple, but he knew it wasn’t. He glared at the thing sitting on the workbench. Then sighed at it.
"Babe. Let him go. He's not... It's not what you think. It's not Hydra, it's a stupid, stupid prank." Tony pleaded with him. In a daze, Steve let go of the boy, who turned around and slid down the wall and buried his head on his arms, crying some more. Steve grabbed Tony's upper arms and pulled him closer. He felt warm and real and Steve just didn't understand what was going on, but he knew he didn't want to let go.
What the hell was he doing?! He pulled away with alacrity.
“Hop on,” he intoned through the speakers and stuck out a boot and an arm.
“What is he going to wear in the meantime, though? My stuff doesn’t fit him.”
"As if a few pointy sticks are going to stop if from having
?! In a military chopper last I saw. Listen, you fucking fuck. I have had it with your fucking head games! I am quitting your secret boy band! I am taking my toys and going home. Go manipulate some other dumb schmuck. I don't give a flying fuck. We're done.” And with that Tony cut the connection. Fury immediately tried to call him back. Tony had JARVIS put him on hold indefinitely with elevator music.
Steve shook his head minutely, as if trying to clear it from the visuals Tony had just so callously provided. He stepped away from the changing table, a little closer to Tony, but not anywhere within touching distance. Tony felt another pang at that.
“I like baseball,” Steve counters, a little defensively.
"How would the team handle those threats without both of you there?" Steve asked, obviously curious.
Steve to manhandle him. Steve went instantly, painfully hard. He lunged forward and shoved his tongue into Tony's mouth and after that everything dissolved into a frantic whirlwind of lips, hands, tongues, teeth and more skin than Steve had ever laid his hands on. It was absolutely fucking glorious.
Now the man looks at Steve as if he is soft in the head and Steve gets a feeling he does that to a lot of people. In this case it is justified, since Steve doesn't want this man to come into his house, but here is inviting him in anyway.
"Is this a test?!?" Redditch kept smiling, so Steve shouted again. "Is this another fucking test?!”
"A sodomite! I know you are disgusted now, little man. You'd better go. You can't win. Once he spills, the Grail is lost and his soul his mine."
“What happened?”
“You want to establish some sort of information exchange? Joint research?”
"Hola," he tries. "Como estas?"
He smiled and jerked his head towards the cafe on the corner.
Steve quickly dropped the chain mail on the bank and stepped into deeper water to hide the growing bulge in his small clothes, transparent as they were when they were wet. He didn't avert his eyes though and watched as Tony tried to work the coarse soap into a lather. The arc reactor glinted on the water as he was rubbing vigorously, to little avail.
"Quiet!" yelled Steve over the pandemonium. The silence was instantaneous.
“Dear Captain. Would you care to explain to me why, after all we've been through, I haven't seen you since we got back?”
Tony counted to three in his head. “Why don't you just stick with simple translations, JARVIS. We wouldn't want to waste battery power, now would we?”
I hope everybody realizes that Steve will get worse before he gets better. But he will get better eventually. Just not in this chapter.
"Well, I think we are done here. Let's see if we can find a place to dry out and maybe find some food." Steve started putting away his sword and shield. The unearthly cold of the place was gone, but the heavy stones of this church would never get warm on a night like this.
“This serves as a thrice a day reassurance for me that you haven’t blown yourself up again, Mr Stark. Besides, they are not
McGonagall peered over the top of her glasses at a spot behind Steve.
"Seriously, Steve, I'll be here when you get back. I promise I won't run off with any hermits. I'll just take a nap or something.”
"Then what?"
“No,” said Tony. “He’s better than perfect. He is a good person.”
Then the demon flickered back to hermit with the purple eyes and beamed at Tony.
Tony was stuck under project 11C and he couldn't get the fucking. wires. in. place. god
. What was it with Tony and the need to get up close and personal with collapsing buildings? He waited for Tony to respond, but nothing happened.
“What are you doing?” The voice was unmistakably American. Dutch people spoke excellent English, in general, but they never managed to sound like this. Tony couldn’t look around, lest he lose sight of his marks, so he couldn’t tell if this was the touristy type who was here for the Delft Blue pottery or the backpacking type who was here for the weed. Both types were easily recognizable, generally.
Tony kissed him and it was like no other kiss he'd ever experienced before. He couldn't help but pour his heart into it, all the fragility and gratitude and joy that threatened to drown him if he didn't share it with Steve, right now. He found himself on his back a while later with Steve leaning over him, smiling again.
“I'm from Brooklyn, actually, and not really religious.” Tony could hear the trace of the accent now. “But, yes, I love my country.” Steve stuck his head out the door and frowned at him. Tony gave him a big, fake Cheshire Cat grin in return, with just a little bit of 'don't fuck with me' in the eyes. I took a moment, but then Steve smiled and retreated, shaking his head. At Tony or at himself for not berating Tony for his shocking lack of patriotism, that wasn't entirely clear, but he guessed they were still good. Good, that was good. Even if Steve hadn't answered the important part of the question. Which was interesting. Far more interesting than the fact that Tony apparently gave a fuck whether he had Steve's approval or not. Right.
"Come a-wassailing. Thor is here to sing to your health, as lord of the manor, and to sing for the health of your orchards." Steve was having a hard time containing his glee.
"What was that monster making you see, anyway?" Bors was asking Percy, while he ladled food into a bowl for him. Percy looked back at him with wounded eyes. Then he hung his head.
Steve was fully dressed. In his own clothes.
“Steve is pregnant!”
“So… uh.... Why sentient motorcycles?” Hoping Tony would let him leave the elephant right where it was. “Why not just get a bike from Weasley’s Auto Emporium?”
Steve chuckled and pressed a soft kiss into Tony's hair. His mouth lingering in the same spot, he murmured: "You'd be a pretty princess."
“Yeah....” It goddamn was.
“First names? This can’t be good.”
or Extension Charm on them. And as literally everyone knew, thanks to a certain person, Steve didn’t have two galleons to rub together. Steve’s mom had been a muggle and there were no Gringott’s vaults left in his name. All he owned was provided by the school.
“I... No!”
"Tony, I do not need you to buy me a thousand dollar tuxedo."
“Tony?” Steve’s voice came from the doorway to the living room. “Who’s at the door?”
The hostess led them to another table for eight in the restaurant, which was currently occupied by four young Japanese women in Cinderella dresses. They were friendly and giggled a lot whenever Steve smiled at them, but their English was so limited that they'd exhausted all the possibilities of conversation before ten minutes were up. And that was when their contacts arrived. Middle Eastern Guy cleaned up nice in a tux and the lady in charge had also made an obvious effort. He introduced himself as Abdel Bajjah and the woman as his wife Yamilla, and they claimed to be from Lyon. Once again, it was Tony who had to carry the conversation, but that was because Abdel also worked in a lab and was very interested in Corbin's research. No surprise there. Steve wasn't ignored this time, though, which was promising for not having to shoehorn him into the upcoming negotiations. Which Tony was expecting an invitation for any minute now....
“Yeah,” sighed Steve. “Me too. I like you, Tony. I really do. You’re a good guy.” Then he smiled, and it was so incongruous that Tony almost missed what he said next.
"I am afraid Bruce is making curry tonight," he said while shoving one of the hats onto Tony's head. Tony would have taken the stupid thing right back off, but it was blessedly warm, actually, so he decided he could suffer the indignity.
Steve turned back to his outlook, scanning the surroundings for trouble, be it human or animal. He sighed again. Maybe Loki was right to move him here. Not because of the chivalry. There was a lot less reading poetry to ladies of the court than he'd expected. Maybe that was somewhere else. Maybe they flounced around in rose gardens reciting poetry in France.
"You heard the man." He jerked his head sideways. "There's the mistletoe. Now kiss me."
“Well…” began Draco.
"It's a bit late to change the security codes now, isn't it? No, this was always meant to be the Avengers' home base. Consider yourself home." Tony couldn't read Steve's expression, but apparently the word 'home' was a bit of a sensitive issue. He turned to Sam.
Steve was making his way up the outside of the ship at a good clip, when Black Widow's voice came through the communicator.
, Tony!?” he finally managed. “An Unforgivable?! You cast a fucking Unforgivable!”
Tony was sure his AI was sulking extra because he was missing his more extensive powers back home and his data banks. So was Tony, actually.
Tony made a dismissive gesture with his gauntlet. Concrete dust wafted from it.
"Best to give them what they came for, so they'll leave you alone. I guess I would have climbed you like a tree and shoved my tongue down your throat." Steve swallowed hard and felt his hands twitch. And his dick. Tony continued: "Think your commanding officers would approve of that?"
"Dammit, Tony! What the hell was
“Send Bruce. He's a doctor and his face isn't in the tabloids.”
"Stop! You'll rip your souvenir! Let me help."
“Subtle like a ton of bricks,” added Tony, “but very efficient.” With that he strode off down the hall. Steve took a moment to cast a R
That was as far as he got before Tony crushed the com unit in his gauntlet.
For the second time in 24 hours.
"Getting there. Remember this will be slooooow." Tony rolled his eyes at him but knew it wasn't going to make a bit of difference.
“Master Stark… what?”
Right outside the gate they ran into a hermit. As if he'd been waiting for them, which he must have been because there was no place where he could otherwise have been headed to for miles around. Steve reined in his horse and bowed his head respectfully. Tony rolled his eyes. The silver disk of the sun that was trying to shine through the thin clouds was almost at its zenith and he was antsy to get on with things. The hermit raised his arms. Drama queen, obviously.
have feelings for
“Because you are the one person I personally invited. Besides, I said I wouldn’t leave your side. Can’t keep that promise if you’re hiding under a table somewhere.”
“Personally, I wouldn’t take that bet.”
“Seriously? Having the naughty dreams is the bug that crawled up your ass? Must be getting uncomfortable with all the sticks you have up there too. Jesus Christ, I thought it was something I'd done, but you're just having the little crisis of conscience that any 12 year old altar boy who recently discovered his own dick, has had.”
Whatever. Tony was still too blissed out to work up any indignation. And it was infinitely amusing to see that his lack of fucks to give riled Clint up more than any snarky come back would have done. Tony filed that bit of information away for later use. To annoy Clint even more he gave Steve a spectacularly sappy look and kissed him slowly with lots of tongue right at the breakfast table. Steve's pink ears were adorable and Tony made sure to make that observation out loud too.
In the evenings he visited nearby keeps to prod the local heroes to come seek him out and the system worked well enough. So far, it was just the rest of the flower of contemporary knighthood and not Steve, though, so he unhorsed them all and sent them back where they came from.
The interior of the limo was as quiet as a coffin. Happy had taken one look at him in the rearview mirror and then the divider slid up with a soft hum. Tony didn’t know what to do with himself, he felt so fucking conflicted he wanted to scream. But he didn’t even know why, and he wasn’t going to let whatever it was get the better of him. He had more fucking dignity than that. He did punch the seat. Once. Then he yanked his tie up and over his head and ditched his suit jacket and focused on breathing steadily.
"Should be here in thirty minutes or so. Excuse me while I go take another shower." And then he made his escape, pretending he couldn't feel Steve's eyes on his back. This was done. This had to be done, for both their sakes.
Tony snorted, but put on the jumper anyway. He slid his hands down his sides, smoothing out the soft wool. It fit him perfectly.
As he handed over the soap their fingers brushed. Steve had to fight down the urge to pull Tony in when that happened. He wanted to plaster himself against that gloriously wet, naked body and bury his face in Tony's neck. To mouth along the ridge of his shoulder and up his neck to finally curl his tongue around his ear, while he placed his hands over the globes of his ass to pull him closer. To press his erection against the V of those hips.
Tony did prime numbers in his head to stop himself from grabbing his own cock and just spurting over Steve arching body.
This could only end in humiliation and heartbreak.
Steve bit back a involuntary laugh. "You don't like it? It's got Stark logos all over it, I thought you liked that kind of thing."
Ten minutes later, Barnes and Rhodes climbed into the limo.
“You hear that?” said Clint to Natasha, with a smug look of satisfaction on his face. “I have a cat named after me.”
Steve bit his tongue and just nodded.
“Well, that disqualifies Tony then,” confirmed Bruce.
Brown eyes turned back to him.
They sat in silence, munching chestnuts, which tasted much better than Tony had expected. Steve made little pleased noises while eating, which Tony manfully ignored. When they were getting to the bottom of the bag though, even Steve's warm presence couldn't counteract the numbness of his feet and ass anymore and he suppressed a shiver. Steve sat up with alacrity.
“Jarvis?” he said softly.
“Oh please,” scoffed Tony, “It's not like I don't have another forty odd suits at home and a fully functional AI.” He paused and glared at Steve. “And we are going to bring
." And he slowly pulled Steve closer, his eyes never leaving Steve's and kissed him. Softly, this time and somehow that was even worse. It was like being laid open, with all his warts and insecurities and to have someone -Tony- smile at him regardless. He couldn't stand it, it was too much, he wanted it too much. Steve pulled away as much as he could, which was barely an inch and breathed: "Tony...."
“Okay, that's enough. You are gross.”
“You think Hydra has a lot of Middle Eastern members?”
But deflection was his natural state of being.
"No."
“Ok. Here's the thing.” Fury leaned back in his own, infinitely more comfortable chair, steepling his fingers. “This morning we apprehended Corbin and Del Porter, before they were to leave for Marseille, where they were to board the cruise ship
“They’re probably too young still?”
"Did you bring the armor?" Steve sounded curious.
"I made you fucking cry, Steve! Of course I did something wrong!" Tony felt like his skin was a size too small and tried to outpace it. Looking everywhere but at Steve, really not ready for whatever expression he might find on Steve's face. "Just let me fucking apologize, okay?"
Tony didn’t know how long they kissed like that, but eventually lust built and built again and two pairs of hands were scrabbling at Tony’s jeans. When they’d finally wrangled them off and Tony had kicked off his shoes, Steve pushed him towards the loft bed ladder. Never breaking the kiss, Tony stumbled backwards until the ladder hit him in the calves. He started scrambling up them backwards and Steve’s mouth trailed to his neck, his shoulders, his chest, his belly, as he got higher. He was kind of hoping that hot mouth would eventually reach his dick, but Steve followed him up the ladder and didn’t get any lower than his stomach. He finally flipped backwards onto the bed and scooted backwards with alacrity to make space for this unexpected lover, who crawled up after him, just as eager. They wrapped themselves around each other and just held on for a long moment. It felt reassuring. Before too long, though, they were kissing and groping again. The last bits of clothing were soon removed and Tony was breathless with want when Steve rolled him onto his back and positioned himself between his legs. His forearms planted next to Tony’s head, he lowered his head to kiss Tony deeply, then asked:
"Right..... Where are my manners? Steve, this is my friend, Colonel James Rhodes. Rhodey, this is Captain Steve Rogers." Steve smiled and held out his hand, but to Tony's surprise Rhodey didn't take it. Instead he clicked his heels together and his hand snapped to his forehead.
It was impossible. It was absofuckinglutely impossible that Cap was still alive after seventy years of being frozen. But if it was not impossible, if somehow his heart was beating, however slowly, he should be breathing. Tony brought his face a fraction from Cap's lips, trying to detect air flow, any air flow.
smile and Steve wanted to preen a little. Then Tony turned back to Dane. "Problem solved. Del will take us back."
“I'm sure some kind of deal might be possible. I'm always open to profitable offers.”
“It’s today?”
“What justice would you see them do?” asked Lancelot. “Would you have these women tear them apart with their own hands and add to the burden they already carry? Is their loss of virtue not enough to bear?”
“Thank you for your input, Stark. So, yes. Both of you are booked at a spa. Captain Rogers, you will get your hair bleached, a full body wax, manicure and pedicure and a spray tan. I've been told the tattoos on your ass can be done so they will hold for at least a week.” Tony tapped out a quick instruction to Jarvis to create a meme featuring the Dos Equis man stating
Motherfuck. What?
His eyes firmly on the Eye it took him a while to notice it wasn't the only light out there. In front of what must be the witches' castle was a collection of bobbing flames, that he assumed were torches. The torches were outlining a seething mass of people. He could hear them now too, they were shouting and screaming in anger. It was an honest to God mob, pitchforks and all and they were trying to storm the gates.
“Do you, though? Need some, I mean. Percival and I, we're perfectly capable--”
Tony tried to untangle his brain from where it had tripped and hopelessly entangled itself in the concept of Steve being an actual virgin, what with the shoulders and the stormy blue eyes and the muscles and the muscles and the other muscles and the plump bottom lip and oh, the things Tony could do to that bottom lip, and really, that way lay madness and he forced himself to parse the rest of that statement.
Steve knew in his bones that being Tony Stark’s big fat middle finger to anything was going to be a risky undertaking, one that was likely to backfire in spectacular ways. But he’d be lying to himself if the idea of annoying a bunch of stuck up purebloods wasn’t appealing. And to be wanted by Tony Stark, even if it was only for this, was appealing too.
"Yeah. Well. Judge not, lest ye be judged yourself." Steve was running out of patience rapidly. "Go back to sleep, son. You need your rest to heal." Galahad obediently closed his eyes.
Then the door of the trailer opens and Steve hastily steps back, out of the line of sight. His heart is hammering in his chest, but he doesn't know why. It's his own house, his own window and that damned trailer shouldn't even be in his driveway. But he still feels like he almost got caught looking at naked neighbors through a telescope. He goes to bed and listens to the generator and the snatches of music coming through his window until the wee hours of the morning.
"Your heart is pounding."
But it was out of his hands, now.
A couple months later everything changed.
"Well. Congratulations," says Goat Man. "Do you want a prize?"
"Yes," nodded Percival happily. "Remember? The hermit said that Sir Stephen would find the Grail because he was a maid and did not kill people needlessly."
“Just start slow,” he said, and laid back down.
"You're welcome," said Steve, pained. "That is wonderful, but please, I need it first." He said down heavily on a chair, unable to hold himself up any longer, Tony cradled in his arms. "Please, milady, he's dying." His voice broke on the last word.
Steve sat astride the stone bench with his new sketchbook between his legs trying to get the frantic expression of the half submerged horse just right. The sun was warm on his neck, the fountain water smelled faintly like chlorine and all around were the sounds of children and people talking, and subdued traffic noises from further away. Tony was on the other half of the bench, feet on the seat and tablet on his knees while he used Steve's back as a recliner. His weight was a pleasantly warm and solid presence. Occasionally he'd mutter something to JARVIS about a particular bit of armor design and once he mentioned staple guns, but he obviously didn't need Steve's input. He was just
This was why he hadn’t discussed it with Steve, because he’d known he’d take it badly. Maybe he hadn’t expected it to be taken
The crashing and grunting was almost upon them and still Galahad was fidgeting with the heavy spear. Steve cursed silently. Did he think the boar was going to do the chivalrous thing and wait for him to be be ready? This wasn't going to end well.
"How is a staple gun going to put anyone down, Stark?" Clint's voice was full of derision. It was shocking, the lack of faith he had in Tony even after all these months. Tony sighed heavily.
“My name is... uhm, Anthony, Lord Stark.” One could hardly claim to be a demon king and be a commoner, after all.
"I told you, I have a suit already."
"I said I would." Steve smiled.
“For leaving you for dead.”
“Actually, that quote is 'You can't expect to wield extreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you'. The quote you're thinking of is 'Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords, that's no basis for a system of government.' You mixed them up,” he said.
"Why is everything about your
Oh man, that was going to be bad, if it was in the Prophet. Steve knew things were going to get really, really complicated, but, God, Tony was kissing him and rational thought was beyond him.
"So what do we do if this doesn't work out?"
“Hi. I’m Tony.”
"Nah, I don't sleep much." Or well, Tony added silently. Especially recently.
Tony looked at him for a moment, hesitating. He didn’t know this guy, but then again. This was Steve’s oldest friend. How untrustworthy could he be? And then he realized that the likelihood of Steve sticking around would be much greater if Bucky was working for Tony too. And he kind of liked the guy.
Draco smiled.
"Really? Are you sure? The blond one seems to be having a good time."
“The brain is all I got right now, Cap. No weapons, no armor, no data. I don't even have any tools.”
Steve was so overjoyed to see Tony waiting for him at the top that he forgot to back off when Tony went to hug him. Before he realized what was happening Tony's arms wrapped around him and he didn't have the will or the heart to break it off.
As if Steve could say no after that.
Just when Tony had had about as much company as he could take and was considering going back to his workshop, despite the fact that he really wouldn't mind another cookie or two, it was unanimously decided that the tree was ready for decorating and Tony was pulled along in a flurry of ornaments, popcorn garlands, tinsel and Steve's wreath cookies.
"That does sound nice. We should go visit them sometime. Make sure Thor is doing his job." Great, now he was picturing lounging on a blanket in the dappled shade among the trees with Steve, picnic basket by their side, feeding the man one grape at a time, and brushing his lips with his fingers as he did so.
That had not answered Percy's question, judging by the look of befuddlement on his face, so Tony switched tacks.
"Oh, sure," said Tony, "That must be it. None of our concern then. Let's just go back to the party. Wanna dance, Clint? I can Waltz now. I'll even let you lead."
every time he didn't get a cultural reference, so he stuck with a
That seemed like a stupid idea to Steve, but he knew better by now than to challenge Tony on issues like these. He’d only dig his heels in.
After a moment Steve let go of Percival's arms.
So it wasn't so much that he had just kissed a man, outside of the charade he was supposed to take part in, but more that he was wondering what the hell he was doing kissing
“Sleep well, Tony.”
But when Tony touched Steve's hand, meaning it to be an unobtrusive gesture of comfort, Steve turned his hand over and laced their fingers together. They remained like that until Tony had to shift down after they took the exit to the airfield. Fucking sports cars with their manual transmissions.
Well, he would find him in due time. First he was going to find a hotel because he needed a shower and about a gallon of coffee. Then he would put together a plan of action, and he would find Steve and catch a flight back to the good old US of A. First class of course, because sleeping in the armor made his back hurt. Cursing the fact that he wasn't twenty anymore, he cracked his neck and stretched his muscles and then blasted off, heading North. It was as good a direction as any.
Homesickness hit him like a ton of bricks. Not for a place... for a time. Maybe a time
It hit him again a few weeks later. It was the day Bruce was to defend his PhD thesis and the man himself burst into Tony’s room at what seemed like the crack of dawn, but was in fact closer to 9 am. Tony blinked down at him sleepily from his bed.
“Hello beautiful,” he crooned softly and Steve told himself not to be stupid. One didn’t get jealous of a motorcycle.
“Aw, come on. It’s probably Jane. Only those in the throes of new love would go out in this. Or did you tell her about the lasagna? Go open the door for your moocher girlfriend, Thor!”
At Rhodey’s request he’d also flown in his former housemates as additional witnesses. They had all been helpful, but according to Rhodey, Darcy’s brief testimony has been the most effective. He’d mimicked it for Tony:
"Pardon me, Sir, but I meant that Captain Rogers' temperature has risen faster than the current ambient temperature could have achieved. He..." JARVIS paused and that was so unusual that Tony looked up questioningly at the speaker in the ceiling, as if JARVIS was residing there; something he hadn't done in years.
"I thought you had everything."
Without the armor, things were almost worse. It took ages to get anywhere on foot and then he had to do without the whispered translations (that were admittedly a little spotty) provided by JARVIS, who was sadly confined to the suit. Old English was fucking hard and his brain was wired to be more technical than linguistic, so he wasn't picking it up very rapidly. He was fairly sure Steve's eidetic memory had made the learning process much easier for him and Tony was a little jealous, but also relieved that he might be suffering less than Tony.
The washer buzzes almost simultaneously with the oven timer and Tony lopes off to transfer his clothes to the dryer while Steve takes out the casserole.
Rhodey looked at him, then looked at Steve, who was sitting across from Tony doing an uncanny impression of a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
“Ehm... Guys would talk about making love to their girlfriends, but not about... sharing or watching other guys with their girls.... and definitely not.....” He hesitated. Tony waited, but that seemed to be as far as Steve could go.
Camelot was in disarray when the boar hunting party arrived home. Where normally half the population of the keep would come out to welcome them back and congratulate them on their prowess (and the boar's head that Gaheris had insisted on dragging along), now they barely merited a glance from the few people rushing from one end of the courtyard to the other. A pair of buckets were lying on the ground next to the well, their contents long since soaked into the cracks between the cobblestones, and an abandoned horse only half loaded with lumpy packs of something was trying to get at the weeds near the courtyard wall. Steve exchanged a worried glance with Tristan who indicated silently that he had no clue what was going on either, but whatever it was he didn't like it. Steve turned to his men.
"Take. Off. The armor."
Which, as Tony was well aware, was about evenly split between symphonic rock and heavy metal.
"Tony. You're looking good."
He lied, because for the next few hours Steve stood in the eye of a storm of needles, threads, measuring tapes, buttons, scissors and a lot of silent judgment and Tony was nowhere to be seen. A house elf he didn’t know yet thankfully brought him lunch at some point.
It was Fury's turn to roll his eyes. “Nice try, Stark. The ladies at the spa have already received their instructions. If you hurt them or try to bribe them I will sic Black Widow on you. Are we clear?” Tony wisely shut up and apparently Captain Rogers was still struck dumb by Del Porter's fabulosity.
"Steve!" Tony sounded quietly strangled, "What the
In retrospect, Tony should not have let Pepper book his vacation, when she was clearly still upset by the whole 'I am Iron Man' thing. He'd
Steve did as he was bid, and together they blasted off. Tony briefly considered heading back to the hotel, but he didn't know if Whiplash had any friends and also, the reporters knew where they were staying, so it didn't seem like the best option right now. He didn't really know where else to go, though, his brain obsessively flitting back and forth between all the freakish events of the last few hours and refusing to assign processing power to finding a solution for this particular problem. 'Not here' seemed to be most important, however, and that he could do. He chose a direction at random and flew until he stopped feeling like there were people breathing down his neck.
“How long? That bit is really hazy.”
Tony chose not to answer the question, so he wouldn't lie. He started pacing around the little cave they were in, looking into the nooks and crannies. There had to be another source of oxygen in this space, or Percival would have asphyxiated already with the manhole cover closed. Steve would probably have lasted longer, but there was no telling how long. Meanwhile, he talked.
"You make me feel alive," whispered Steve and he must have gotten closer because that was right in Tony's ear and it made him shiver. "You can't imagine how long it's been since I've felt alive." His breath ghosted against Tony's cheek and his hands were sliding down Tony's arms and crossed over to his abs, pulling him against his chest.
Tony thought back on the near destruction of New York and begged to differ, but he wasn't stupid enough to voice that opinion. The important bit of information here was that this demon, or whatever it was, considered itself more badass than Loki, which was worrisome. Also, if Tony wasn't mistaken, there was a little bit of unfriendly competition there. That made it unlikely he was dealing with Satan himself, because the latter should be able to blow Loki out of the water. Without batting an eye. For the time being, Tony was going to guess mid to high level minion of the Lord of Hell.
And he pointed to something that looked like a dark blob against the dark waves for all that Tony could make out.
Tony trails his fingers down Steve's torso, leaving a trail of goosebumps in their wake.
any more like a soldier out there? Do you think Del Porter has been any closer to being in the military than dressing like a stripper cop for Halloween? You can't just fucking
Well, it hadn’t been a total waste of time, gamma rays were really interesting.
"That is good. It's good to know what you are fighting for. Take a few more weeks if you need to wrap your head around it. But you need to come home."
“Oh, my mistake,” said Natasha and Tony could almost hear her eyes rolling over the com. “I guess just Steve is miserable, then.” And that was so much worse.
"Yeah. Apparently," Steve sighed, relaxing his hold on Tony's face, turning it into more of a caress. "I'm sorry, Tony. I'm sorry he was such a failure as a father. But believe me when I say that not all people judge mistakes as harshly." Steve was rubbing his thumb over Tony's cheekbone now. Tony wasn't going to say it. Tony
“Not even close,” scoffed Tony. “You know very well the Stanes are next in line. But I’ll make sure I bequeath you the Carnaby china in my will, I’m sure that will make you happy.”
“Well done, grasshopper! There is hope for you yet.”
They were. There was much rejoicing about Steve finding the 'lost' boys, that he valiantly grimaced through, and a lot of fussing over Josh's unfortunate fall and then Steve and Tony were following Cecilia and her charges back to the exit, once they had made it clear to her that she needed to not follow procedure in this case. When they were climbing up the stairs that came out in the underground basilica that they had started in, Steve finally had the opportunity to pull Tony aside. He turned on him.
Steve shifted from foot to foot and wiped his palms on the robes that he considered ditching right then and there. His gaze sought Tony’s again and this time Tony caught it. Tony smiled. The not fake smile. Everything else faded away and Steve swallowed hard. Then Tony’s smile changed. It got that turn up at the corner of his mouth that preceded every occasion when Tony would do or say something to provoke him, when he would act deliberately to get a reaction out of Steve. Tony’s hands went to the top buttons of his outer robes and never breaking eye contact, he started to unbutton them. Steve’s mouth went dry.
you have a heart. A big and squishy one."
Tony tried to elbow him, unsuccessfully. Steve just pulled him closer and smiled into his neck.
“Please tell me we're not going to see the Rockettes next,” he interrupted.
Steve hit the stone again, which resulted in more shrieking and more cracks. His smile looked strangely fond, though, which made no sense.
"Perhaps you're right."
“Why, yes, Steve. That’s a
"He has a pair of chaps too."
Tony's grin is positively evil. “You got it, soldier boy.” He places a hand on Steve's chest and pushes him back towards the bed. When he hits the edge, his knees buckle and he sits down with a thump. Tony straddles his legs, looming over him, one hand on his shoulder, still sporting that grin.
“It’s not a horcrux, you heard me explain how it’s not a horcrux! Bruce didn’t even know something had happened to his processor. It’s harmless. It doesn’t take anything away from you. You just….infuse it.”
she was unflappable and ruthless, it worked admirably.
“Well, according to McGonagall a transfiguration with that kind of mass discrepancy would run into continuity-elasticity limits and can cause reverbs onto the caster.” Steve wasn’t
His downward spiral is stopped short by the realization that he can see Tony's cock now. It's half hard and cut and curves a little to the right. Steve's fingers ache to touch the silky smoothness of it, but this time when he reaches out, Tony slaps his hand away.
When Tony resurfaced a little later, December 13th or 14th or so, he was met with pretty much the same scene, only Bruce was frowning at the paperwork now too, mug of green tea in hand.
It was hard, because somehow Tony seemed to have decided that Bucky’s bed was better than his own and just started following Steve home at night. So Steve couldn’t even rub one out in peace. Instead he lay there in the dark listening to Tony talk about random topics and letting the sound of his voice wash over him until the Compulsion dragged him under. Then Steve would slink into the bathroom and jerk off furtively while he imagined crawling into bed with Tony afterward.
"That's not what I meant. Of course I think you can do this. I think you can do this so well you may change the course of history and should we really risk that?”
“Don’t be such a drama queen, Tony,” chided Draco. “At least a third of the people here wish you no harm whatsoever. And I am sure only half of the rest are actively disappointed last year wasn’t the start of your inevitable decline into substance abuse.”
"Tony..." It was a whisper that he could feel more than hear, even with the com unit, even through his armor. And Tony couldn't deal with that. He just couldn't. He closed his eyes as he blasted off towards the quinjet.
A little,” he admits, feeling a smile tug at his own lips. He suddenly wonders if Tony meant it, that they could fuck a few more times before they moved on. The idea is appealing.
.” The motherfucker waggled his one visible eyebrow. Tony rolled his eyes in answer. He gave a him a sloppy imitation of the salute Rogers had omitted and muttered: “Stay thirsty, my friend.” Then he got the hell out.
“Captain Rogers! What are your plans now? Will you be continuing as Mr. Stark’s bodyguard?” The reporter cracked herself up with her joke and the entire room laughed with her. Tony wanted to kill her career. A week to live or not, he wanted to drag Steve out of there and forget that anyone else had any kind of claim on him.
“You can pass that on to your creepy director, too.”
Great. Just fucking great. What the hell was he supposed to do with vague numbers like that? So there was no GPS and there were no phones and no showers and no first class flights. Then he cursed again when he realized coffee wouldn't be introduced on this continent until Columbus had gone and massacred a bunch of Indians in South America.
Tony clung hard to the knowledge that Steve had managed to not drown before he got frozen for 70 years, but it didn't make him feel any less frantic when he finally blasted out of the building.
Steve Rogers?"
"Oh yes. So much concern," the thing said mockingly. "I look forward to possessing it soon, in all its freshly tainted glory."
When the sounds died down and the thing was reduced to a smoldering pile of rags, Steve looked at him and grinned.
"Oh yeah. Because I am comfortable. I mean... comforting... Something."
“Right,” Steve sat up straight again, smiling too. “It’d be cruel not to help a fellow out, when he is as inept as you at catching a couple of little kittens.”
"Again?!" Clint threw up his arms in disgust.
Steve realized with a shock he wasn’t the only one seeing this, it wasn’t just the two of them in the room. Hundreds of people were seeing this.
“How are the cats?”
It was the obvious distress in the elf’s voice that convinced Steve. He looked more prim and proper than any elf Steve had ever seen, yet here he was, clearly upset.
“What do you want me to do?”
“He's not going to need Adele.”
Clint mumbled something that sounded like "farm", but that couldn't possiblybe right. Well, it was none of Tony's business if Clint didn't want to share. Tony looked back at the group to see if they were as surprised to see Clint as he was, but obviously they had been aware of Clint's presence in his tower. He really needed to have a little chat with J.A.R.V.I.S. about announcing visitors. Roommates. Whatever.
"Babe me one more time and you'll have the list shoved up your ass, honey." Natasha gave Tony the same little finger waggle he had given her on the ice and strode off with a grinning Clint in tow.
"Al... what?" Bell looked truly flabbergasted. Tony ruled him out as being in on any kind of conspiracy. Complacency and incompetence seemed much more likely vices.
Steve sprinted over and pulled Galahad aside before yanking the boy's spear loose and aiming it at the hog's heart. After the thrust silence descended over the clearing. He straightened up, wiping his forehead and willing his adrenaline fueled breaths to even out. Raising his eyes he met the gaze of the other four men who were staring at him in shock. Right. That had probably been a bit much with the displays of super human strength and speed. He swallowed.
“What’s wrong with the kitchen stereo?” he asked Natasha.
“Tony said you’d kill me if I did.”
Steve nodded happily. "Where is it?" He asked Percival, who immediately looked even more embarrassed than before.
Tony woke up on a couch. At first he wasn't quite sure where he was and what had woken him up. For one thing, this was not his couch and the blanket that had been draped over him actually left his face free, which is not something that Dumm-E had ever managed to accomplish. Then the smell of coffee registered and he jerked upright. Right.... cruise ship cabin.
The apple dropped out of his slack fingers into the water but Tony didn't notice it. He was too busy being astounded by his own stupidity. He'd gone about this the wrong way around the entire fucking time! He couldn't believe he wasted these weeks trying to chase down word from Steve. When all this time he should have been spreading word of himself, packed in an attractively evil package, tied with a irresistible challenge as the pretty bow on top. Sprinkle it all with some references only Steve would get and the fool would come a-riding to Tony's rescue on a white horse with trumpets blaring and banners streaming in the wind.
"Don't laugh. The shaking hurts my head."
“I haven’t talked to Stane in three years.”
The anger didn't stop there though. He was also angry at Steve for not telling him his secret, even though he realized he was probably under orders not to. And angry at Steve for being all
"You can be whoever you want to be in your Oz, Tony, although really, you're much more of a Glinda than a Wicked Witch of the West. In
“Alright, children,” interrupted Rhodey. “Can we talk now?”
The ship was.... overwhelming. There were indoor and outdoor pools, restaurants, shops, casinos, gyms, night clubs and there were people everywhere. He automatically started trying to spot the enemy. Their contact could be anybody. Snipers could be anywhere. Contact would likely be made during one of the scheduled activities, but that didn't mean they weren't being watched this minute. It could be that guy with the dodgy hairpiece that was staring at them. Although it looked like his companion was pregnant, that might be a bit much even for Hydra. But times had certainly changed that way and....
It took Steve a minute to parse what Tony was saying. When he got it he couldn't help but shake his head at how utterly wrong Tony's interpretation was. But since it worked to his advantage and saved Steve from having to explain what had actually been going on in his head, he'd take it. Bless the man for handing him a plausible excuse.
Tony conceded the point. “Fine. Okay. No more counting. You know we’ll be depriving science of some unique data on superhero sex drives here, but okay. We’re official.”
"He is plenty deep, Pep," Tony sounded insulted in a distracted kind of way. "Because he likes me? He likes me
“I do. I’ll get that ready too.” Natasha ran off to her room.
a place. The Brooklyn where he'd grown up, where he'd roamed the streets with Bucky, on the days he hadn't been so sick he'd had to stay home. His bedroom with the damp ceilings. The old comics that had entertained him when he couldn't go out. The ballgames they'd played on the streets when he could. A time and a place when everyone he loved had still been alive, including his mom.
Silence settled once more over the workshop. Tony kept searching for words, but they just wouldn't come.
"Actually. Was that thing in Switzerland a one off?"
“No wonder you pissed off Bruce.”
They couldn't stay here. Tony had been weakening rapidly even before all this and the arc reactor could stop any moment. They had to get home, where there were hospitals and antibiotics and most of all, a spare reactor. Steve decided they'd have to leave in the morning.
"So they say, but truthfully, it shines so bright that you can't make out the shape very well. But it is about as big as you mentioned and it does pulse like you said."
"What are you going to do with all that stuff?" Steve asked.
Tony smiled thinly at Bucky and Bucky stared harder.
When he finally crawled into his bedroll hours later, much colder, but no wiser, Tony scooted close to him and threw an arm around his chest. Steve stiffened and Tony made a frustrated little noise.
?” Stark repeated. Steve closed his eyes.
She smiled. A more genuine one. "It only works when he is on earth. And he breaks it a lot. Tony sees it as a personal challenge to design a phone sturdy enough for him. So far no luck though." She tucked the phone into his leather jacket. "Now, I am counting on you to wander your way back east. Don't take too long. Tony is miserable and he is hard enough to get along with when he is happy. Don't force me to come and kill you." And with that she shook his hand and took off down the road. Steve stared after her for a long time before he went back to his bike.
"I... okay." Eloquence wasn't his strong suit tonight.
The bantering tone was gone and Steve missed it already.
“Let me see,” said Bruce-the-human, while Tony shrugged helplessly. Bruce took the kitten from Steve and examined it closely. Steve shoved his hand in his pocket and stood a little forlorn while a small puddle formed around his feet on the old industrial grade black linoleum.
The last minute rental selection in the store was abysmal, there was no other word for it. Unless he gained 40 pounds by 2 pm, grew another foot or would consent to going in baby blue, there was nothing available.
“What type of offer were you considering then?” asked Tony.
“Yeah.” Tony sounded amused too. “Don't worry, you can be Robin. You'd make a good Robin.”
“Like you want to throttle me, and fuck me, at the same time? And maybe hug me after? Yeah, I know the feeling, Cap.” Oh, how Tony knew that feeling. There was a gasp from the spectators. Steve went beet red, but Tony didn't miss the way his breath sped up and his lips parted.
"I know you want to help him," Bruce continued, "but I think the best thing you can do right now is let him be for a bit. Have J.A.R.V.I.S. help you monitor any tracks he leaves and be ready when he pops back up among the living."
you. He didn't even create me and he had a lot more to do with what I am, than with what you are. Your brilliance, your courage, your dedication, your generosity, that is all you. He doesn't get to claim any credit for that. You're not JARVIS or a suit of armor. It'd be like me patting myself on the back as team leader every time Clint hits a target. It'd be like--”
To hide his smile, Tony wrapped his arms around Steve and hugged him. It took a second, but then Steve hugged him back. That felt really, really good. Wow, the man was large. Aware that they were standing in the middle of the restaurant and probably blocking traffic, Tony pulled back reluctantly. Okay, now they were both smiling awkwardly at each other and there was more blushing. Which was adorable.
“Just because you are sartorially oblivious,” countered Draco, “doesn’t mean that Tony and Steve aren’t making a statement with their choice of dress.”
Shooting up into the air over his own gates it looked indeed like the local king had showed up with a small army. Tony had expected this, of course. He wouldn't have let a demon move into his back yard either. There were about a dozen men on horses and four or five times as many on foot. They all wore chain mail and had different variations of sharp metal sticks, and a few were holding banners. Whatever order they had arrived in went out the window as soon as they spotted Tony coming over the castle walls. A few horses reared, men were stumbling back away from the panicked beasts and what looked like a twelve year old boy tripped over his pike and managed to take three men down with him. Seizing the opening his appearance had given him, Tony shot a few repulsor blasts over their heads, adding to the chaos. Several footmen in the back made a run for it, despite their king's bellowed order to stand fast. Tony drowned him out by turning up AC/DC's Hell's Bells over the speakers. Then he did loop de loops over their heads, ripped a few lances out of shaking hands and tossed them aside and then he fried some vegetation on their outer perimeter. More people ran, dropping their weapons, including a few of the knights on horseback, but the king still held steady. So Tony plucked up the adolescent boy next to him from his saddle and by the look on the king's face he had guessed right. The boy was likely his son and dear to him. The panicked boy was kicking wildly and Tony had to tighten his grip lest he drop him; the boy promptly lost control over his bladder, but at least he went still. Tony felt like a big, mean bully, but it had to be done.
So much for being inconspicuous. Tony flushed and darted a glance at Steve. The man was staring down hard at the soapy water, but there was a little smile playing along his lips, so all seemed not lost. Still… Tony picked up a wet scrubbing sponge and launched it at Clint’s head. Because he wasn’t Clint and his aim sucked, he missed, but he did manage to hit the table right in front of him, causing a small shower of dirty dishwater. Clint let out a stream of curses but stopped abruptly when Natasha cuffed him upside the head. She expertly flipped the sponge over Steve’s head into the sink and that was that.
"Where the hell am I going?" He couldn't help asking, even if it felt like defeat.
Peering into the hallway in front of the cabin it turned out that Tony hadn't been far off the mark. So maybe there weren't 87 goons in front of their door, but at least a dozen and lord knew how many were inside the cabin.
The king nodded solemnly, as if demons were known for their extensive demands for household goods.
“I guess they’ll ship me back for my court martial, too. Not that I’ll see much of the place… But it’ll be good to be home.”
"How they always handle them: toss all we got into the fray and hope for the best."
The anger burned hotly for almost two weeks. It was a time in which he was phenomenally productive (as opposed to the Denial Days, which he had spent mostly drunk) and made breakthroughs in a number of projects. He added staple gun tasers to the armor, for one. He blasted a lot of grunge and metal through the shop, like any well adjusted man who had had his formative years in the late eighties and early nineties, but JARVIS was the only one around who could complain and he knew better. Especially after Tony had threatened to scrap him after sneaking
" sighed Steve. He gestured to Percy. "Let's go." And with that he led the way for Tony, Percival and the pack horse to follow. Tony waved at those of his witches who had come to say goodbye and Percival waved at Elaine, who beamed back and then they were off.
“You hiding, Stark?”
“The meeting is on a cruise ship in the middle of the Mediterranean, Stark. You'd be surprised to know how fragile those boats are, even big ass motherfuckers like these. One well placed hole and the thing goes down with all on board. I'm sure you've seen Titanic? Compared to the Hulk those icebergs are remarkably passive and peaceful, you know. Given that we're dealing with Hydra, the chance that Banner will hold it together isn't a risk I am willing to take.”
fucking shithole.” Steve hears him anyway. He waits for Tony to elaborate, but it doesn't happen. Eventually he goes back to his drawing. Fuck it, he's going to try the smile anyway. He can always burn it later.
“No, hold on to them, please. They like you. Don’t want to lose them again. Come on, it’ll only take a minute.”
“Right. I should let you rest.” Steve made to move away and Tony grabbed him by his newly shorn hair.
“I left him and went to my brother Arthur. After all, he'd married me to the man. But his opinion was that I should be a more obedient wife and he was about to send me back. So I chose to leave with what faithful retainers I had left and come here.”
