Except that Tony did remember how lovely Steve’s chest had been, even if he did smack into it and Steve when flying at top speed.
Steve shook out a blanket under a tree beside the lovely rolling creek that flowed through his estate. He did not regret his decision to set business aside for a few hours. He looked back towards his renovated house, the slate roof shining in the sun.
“Please, don’t be mad at her!” Tony rushes to placate her by covering her hands with his. “I asked her not to write to you about it. I thought...Well. An assault was enough of bad news, if I said I welcomed a stranger to heal his wounds even for a short time, you and father would be so angry. You would have cancelled your trip...”
“Oh no Jarvis, it’s fine. But please, come in.” Tony invites him to a chair close to the wall with a motion of his hand.
Ned’s face fell, but he quickly brightened. “Can I put lots of dots on paper so it looks like glitter?”
“His name is Tony, he’s an alpha, for what that’s worth, he’s going to live in my dressing room for now. He’s already rejected the offer of a doll house.” Steve didn’t understand what Tony wrote next in the list. “Something wheels. What do you think this is?” He pushed this list over to Sam.
make a strong impression during the Van Dyne’s ball. I think we didn’t receive that many letters two years ago when he came out for his first dinner party in London!”
Sam pushed Steve out the door and into the carriage, just as Steve’s knees turned to jelly. Settling hard into the carriage bench, Steve muttered, “It’s never been this bad, Sam.”
The human then knelt so that he could see Tony eye-to-eye. “I didn’t know what you would like for breakfast so we guessed.”
Tony realizes he should have tried to show his intimate side to Steve from the beginning because he’s more sensitive to that. He remembers Bucky had warned him a few times that the blond disliked showoffs and superficial people. Well, Steve manages just fine to sleep with some specimens like Rumlow, but it's true he hardly paid attention to him, and he never said he liked him as a friend either. If Tony had listened to Bucky, Steve would have been much nicer.
He made the short drive back to his apartment, all the while ignoring the WhatsApp notifications from the group chat he had with his best friends - Nat, Sam, Bucky, and Carol. They were all supposed to go to Nat and Bucky’s house that night to watch The Bachelor and make fun of it and it was usually one of Steve’s favorite nights of the week. But tonight, he had a phone call to make. He quickly texted the group that he had to catch up on some parent emails and he’d see them next week before grabbing a beer from the fridge and settling on his couch.
“My last rank was commodore, actually,” Steve replied. Despite all his honor and successes in the field, Steve did not have the political pull to be named Rear Admiral. Lack of political connections was in fact worse than being an omega. “I could not be promoted so it was more life at sea or retirement.”
But there was the… weirdness of asking out his son’s teacher. Peter’s last day of kindergarten was June 11. Tony checked his phone - May 15. Surely he could make it another month?
“Absolutely,” Steve assured the boy, who then scrambled over to his friends to presumably alert them of his creative brainwave.
Grumbling, Tony crawled up and over the drawer lip onto the table. He had no way to signal Rhodey to come and get him. So he was stuck until his wing unsprained itself. Once on the table, he found that someone left him a dish filled with preserved and fresh fruit, bread, crackers, and candy with cups of milk and water.
"Of course. You aged well, my dear; your looks are much more refined now." His mother gently puts the gifts near his plate as if to bring proof of his beauty and its effects on others. "It was just a matter of time before our friends and neighbours would notice it."
He’d been hard at work sabotaging the mill works. A determined fairy could make a lot of mischief and do a lot of damage. He’d needed more supplies and that’s how he ran into Steve.
Stark men are made of iron. He will find a way to get better if Steve doesn't want him back. He inhales.
“Tony,” Steve shoved his elbow playfully into Tony’s side and the other man still didn’t move. That’s when Steve turned to Tony and realized he was crying.
The only thing that moved faster than Peter’s mouth was his brain, but he was also sweet as candy, kind to the other students, and helpful whenever it was asked of him. Peter was a sensitive kid, who tended to cry easily and whenever he was frustrated - which was also frequently. He got frustrated when things weren’t fair, when he was bored, when he was confused, and whenever someone picked on his best friend MJ for having ‘crazy hair’.
On the second day, Tony’s wings still had not improved and he had ventured out into Steve’s bedroom as far as the sitting area. He had breakfast with Steve, drinking all the coffee offered, but barely looked at or talked to Steve. Then he retreated to the dressing room to work on some device through the day and into the night.
Tony couldn’t find anything to counter her words. All the fights and fear slowly evaporate from him. Nothing happened as he expected. She guessed everything by herself, didn't soothe his worries but exacerbate them and he has been unable to hide his feelings correctly. The least he can do is admit she is right. He faces her, his heart pounding against his ribcage.
Peter dropped his voice to a stage whisper. “You’re my second favorite omega in the whole wide world.”
“I don’t know about this,” Steve said. He looked over the collection of fine silks and silver and gold woven muslins laid out by the dressmaker’s assistant. The fanciest dress he’d owned to this point had been a fetching sprigged muslin he’d bought his last time in the capital city. But admittedly, Steve was weak for blues, reds and whites and the dressmaker had brought a variety of hues.
Tony came in his human form, dressed in dark, somber clothes. “I wish we’d met under better circumstances, Mr. Rumlow,” Tony said, leveling the alpha with a confident stare. “The Captain and I have been discussing matters with your bankers and expected a more formal meeting. But Captain Rogers was excited to check our his new property.”
As March stretched into April and April stretched into May, Steve found more and more of his life consumed with texting Tony Stark. Sometimes it was about Peter.
“About what?” Natasha asked. She had settled in a upholstered chair near Tony’s table. Tony had expanded his work area across the console table that Steve had brought in when Tony complained about not having enough space to work. No doubt to sneak Tony snacks as the fairy worked on his building plans.
"The usual politeness but no proposition to invite him here. He's insufferable but we must concede he does have a point." His father’s steady gaze roams from his mother back to him. It feels like a long needle piercing through his skull.
He was stuck here for the duration. Contrary to what humans thought, not all fairies were magical. Tony was an engineer and scientist fairy. Which made it hard for him as a fairy. His father had been particularly disappointed that Tony wasn’t keen on going into the family magic business.
Tony can’t finish his sentence because Steve has come across the table and has pushed Tony’s chair brutally to sit on his thighs. Utter shock paralyzes him completely. Steve takes a pause to cradle his face between his hands, contemplating it with a hungry expression, before kissing him passionately. Tony’s brain is numb from Steve’s assault, the sensation of soft lips crashing over his makes him moan. His soulmark sings in joy as Steve runs his hands on his chest, caressing all the skin he can touch, his fingers marking each bump and hollow created by his muscles tantalizingly. Tony holds him closer like he's his anchor. The waters are completely swallowing him whole, he's drowning under the many waves of pleasure Steve keeps giving him so generously.
He tugged on the unfamiliar jacket. Tony had decided to attend the ball as if he was human. Complete with carriage, giant human size, and silly human clothes. Though he had to admit that the jacket and formal breeches were more comfortable than his usual fairy clothes. And the gold embroidery on the jacket lapels and tails added a very nice touch.
Thank you for the people supporting me through comments, kudos and likes U/////U I'm truly grateful and I hope you're having or had a good day!
“Steve, this place is lovely and I am enjoying our visit. We’ve all seen how you’ve perked up being around people. But --” Natasha said.
There was a world within that ‘but.’ He knew Nat far too well. “Preparations, though,” Steve pondered.
The tiny man looked incredibly indignant and glared at Steve. He tried to flap his wings, but one wing didn’t work as well as its partner.
The soundtrack of Steve’s soul really was a room full of joyfully chattering children. He’d known he wanted to be a teacher for as long as he could remember. He loved kids and he knew it wasn’t just because he was an omega. It certainly made it easier to get a job - people still had stereotypes hung up around alphas being teachers.
“I've never seen you so besotted before, Stevie,” Bucky smirks, throwing a sly glance at the blonde Omega resting on his shoulder.
Tony rises abruptly on his elbows. He runs his hands through his hair in annoyance, then covers his eyes, hoping it would chase away this uncomfortably arousing picture. Today, he promises himself he will stop going in circles, thinking again and again about this Omega, scrutinizing what he may or may not feel for him in a dozen different angles without any satisfying conclusion.
Peter giggled. “You’re silly, Mr. Steve. It’s spelled dee-you-em-dash-ee. He’s is a robot and his name is actually ‘Dad’s Ultimate Machine Excavator’ because Daddy first built him with Uncle Rhodey to do some digging at the old Stark house, the one we never go to because Daddy says it’s haunted by all the ghosts of disappointed fathers, but I don’t know what that means, but I don’t want to ask because Daddy always looks sad when he talks about it and I don’t like it when Daddy is sad. Anyway, DUM-E is an early proto… prototype?”
“I’m working,” Tony protested and Steve responded by taking off Tony’s glasses and prying the phone from his hand.
“It’s nothing very conclusive, however, I’m afraid,” Tony says, his hands ruffling through his hair. He sighs dramatically. “Most of them are unfinished works. Dealing with ships is a much more complicated affair than designing rifles.”
Steve stood tall and straight, in his full dress gown of exceedingly fine blue satin, adorned with gold ribbons and embroidery, complete with long white gloves, pearls and small white flowers laced through his blond hair. Somehow he’d acquired a necklace and earrings set with blue gems.
“Thank you.” Steve grins at her. His voice is so hoarse he wonders if she managed to understand his words.
Steve comes hard with the culmination of Bucky’s hitting his sweet spot just right where it should, and the imaginary vision of Mr Stark’s gorgeous features strained by intense pleasure, sobbing unabashedly as Steve licks and eats his cunt. The echoes of his voice dissolve into the night when Steve and Bucky’s arousal peak drop down. After they wiped away their mutual dried fluids from their bodies, Steve rolls on Bucky's side.
“What about that rich handsome Omega you fancy?” James interrupts smugly. “You could work for him, see him every day. It would be like heaven for you.”
Tony was good for Steve. That was all that Steve needed to say to people. He was eager to show off Tony at gatherings at the capital. He’d already confirmed a visit with Bucky and Sam over the holidays with Tony’s enthusiastic agreement.
“My mother,” Steve says incisively, immediately regretting how he sounded. He already feels tears coming to his eyes. She has just asked a simple question. He has no reason to feel so annoyed at her, he can’t expect her to know- “She’s the one who taught me. I - Sorry, I don’t wish to talk about it.”
“What about him?” Steve flushes, his whole body and voice tense like a bowstring, on the defensive, ready to launch some arrows.
Steve rolls his eyes. He can smell a mix of sugar and spice coming from Bucky’s skin. That bloody idiot.
“You do if you move the furniture out of the drawing room and parlor -- open up both rooms. That is the reason you took down the wall and installed the pocket doors, right?” Sam said.
“I...I wouldn’t formulate it this way.” Tony stammers with a fake confident smile he hopes would be enough of a wall to protect his beating heart. Any pretence is necessary to escape this situation, any illusion of control. “Yes, I thought about him but...I was most troubled by the assault. The memory of it. It was the first time I suffered from an Alpha’s disgusting behaviour.” He huffs.
Steve rattled it off, skeptically, as Tony typed into his phone. “There, that should explain everything. Say goodbye to Mr. Rogers, Peter, we gotta get to Auntie Pep’s.”
But would Steve have room on his dance card for Tony, who should not have been late? Who wouldn’t want to dance with Steve?
“Only if you think you can find doll furniture. Bucky’s good at whittling …” Steve looked up at a very skeptical Sam. “I’m responsible for him being here. If he hadn’t flown into me --”
They danced twice, enraptured in their conversations. Tony hadn’t resisted her offer. His heart had skipped a beat the few times her gaze locked on his. He heard many people muttering in his back, considering how lovely they looked together, wondering if Lady Virginia Potts would court him or not. She had blushed demurely when she admitted she did found him fascinating to talk to, never interrupting him when he had spoken with pride about the recent weapons for heavy artillery his father had created and would soon show. She shared some of her achievements at her classes and personal ideas for trade with other countries. All in all, the ball had been very pleasant in her company. If her hand had lingered on his arm a bit too long when she walked him alongside his mother to their carriage, he didn’t mention it. If he remarked how she shared some similarities with Mr Rogers, he keeps it to himself.
Natasha and Bucky had no trouble telling Tony lots of embarrassing stories about Steve growing up and in the Navy to much laughter all around. Tony had his share of stories about his friends, particularly Rhodey.
At least the constant planning for the ball reminded Tony to not become too comfortable here. Besides, he was essentially living in Steve’s closet. It was a nice sized room with chairs, a table, a small bookshelf, a dressing table, and Steve’s current wardrobe. So a closet in effect.
Tony pushed forward, just as the first notes of the next dance sounded. “Can I have the next dance?” he blurted out, as he looked up at Steve.
“I’M FINE, STEVE,” Peter called back from his place on the playground, a few hundred yards from where Steve and Tony were sitting on a bench.
Steve wasn’t sure what alternate dimension he’d slipped into, but Tony Stark was an alpha. Everyone knew that. Plus, he smelled like one.
Steve was particularly fetching today, his hair tied up in a blue ribbon matching his dark blue spencer. His lovely rose and sandalwood scent added to the enticing picture. Tony pinched himself. He had a mission and he couldn’t get distracted.
Steve snaked his hand around the back of Tony’s neck and brought him in for a kiss. Steve’s tongue pressed along the seam of Tony’s lips and Tony braced himself for teeth and tongue and longing and instead, he got tenderness. When Steve pulled away, he pressed their foreheads together.
-It's NSFW. If nudity, rimming, fingering/prepping for anal sex make you feel uncomfortable, please close the tab.
Sam clapped Steve on his shoulder. “Town is not a far ride -- I’ll rope in Bucky and we’ll be back by dinner. Will Tony be joining us?”
Great, he was now feeling sorry for himself. He had to pull it together. He had things to do, business to attend to, and needed to be anywhere but here.
Steve was pretty alright for a human, Tony had decided after the first day of being grounded at Steve’s estate. It was easy also to forget at times that Steve was an omega, given his size and bearing.
Steve felt a sudden pang as he realized that Tony might have lost his battle to save his forest. He had one last thing he could do for Tony, to make up for ruining his chances to stop the mill. He rang the bell for the housekeeper. “Please fetch my business clothes.”
“Hey. I wonder - Do, do you-” Steve’s deep voice stammers, matching the storm in his blue eyes. Tony is stunned by how bright they are.
“I was lucky to buy this estate -- a friend of a friend told me it was available and I was able to secure it for less money than expected.”
Her sentence silents Tony immediately. He forgot he asked Mrs Woodwards to keep this significant detail out from her letter. He gulps. His mother’s gaze turns calculating, her mouth slightly agape. She’s looking at Tony as if she’s noticing something new about her son she never did before and she’s feeling uncertain about it. Tony feels his throat constricting. His brain runs wild with many sentences he could say to repair the damage, words shifting, forming then vanishing. Even with his best efforts, nothing precise can escape his lips to reach his mother. She inhales, a thin-veiled current of dread filling her eyes.
Never in his life has Tony felt a single misplaced word could sentence him so badly his mother would have a completely different opinion of him. He massages his breastbone in the hope to appease his breathing; his ribs constricting under the pressure of two imaginary strong hands compressing them on each side.
Tony puts the teacup back on the platter, clinking the delicate porcelain. He stands up and stretches his arms above his head when Ana rushes in the room with a trolley, saluting him with a quick bow. Suddenly, she stops in her tracks, sniffs around and frowns, her nose wrinkling at the stuffy odours emanating from the sheets. Tony gives her an apologetic smile, but it comes off more like a grimace, one of his hands massaging his neck in embarrassment. He did stay too long here. It stirs Ana into motion. She becomes a commanding presence, performing each action with sharp and efficient gestures: removing the tea service, changing the dressing of his pillows then taking care of those covering his thick blankets. She puts them back into proper shape, with some good perfunctory slaps, before folding them in a neat pile at the end of the bed. Once it’s done, she gathers all the smelly sheets on the ground, walks to the windows and opens them in a satisfying clank. Dust swirls through the sunlight rays. Fresh air, at last. Tony takes a deep breath. He moves to fetch some clothes for the day in his wardrobe while Ana is pushing all the dirty items inside a basket she carries under her armpit. She walks to the door and turns around to face him with a knowing smile.
“Captain Rogers, to what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?” Rumlow said. True to his nature, he ignored Sam as a beta not worthy of his alpha attention.
The fairy who had been sitting on Steve’s hand had slid down into a prone position. Steve gently poked at him. “No sleep for you until you’re fine.”
Steve hid a smile behind a gloved hand. He offered his arm to Tony. “Ready for dinner, Mr. Stark?” he said.
I thank Swisstae once more for their amazing beta-read work ♥️✨I hope you'll enjoy reading it, folks! Have a nice day!
When Steve bought his estate, he expected to live a mostly solitary life. Despite his wealth, military service and reknown, and acknowledged attractiveness, Steve had no marriage prospects. He had long reconciled himself that he was destined to be the old bachelor with a home open to his friends and their families for holidays and summers and whenever his friends’ children wanted to visit Uncle Steve. He had the influence to introduce friends at court and launch them in their careers. Loneliness was his portion in life.
Mr Hammer. A slimy Alpha, confident, ambitious and completely unashamed of how ridiculous he looks in public. Brash, inelegant, those were the first words Tony thought when he faced him with a forced smile. People seemed to only tolerate him because they were either too polite not to invite him or too mindful of how rich he is, how generous he could be with people he considers his close friends. He had tried to monopolize Tony’s attention during the entire ball. He had even dared to touch the back of his neck during their dance, pretending the foul gesture was accidental when his smile had said the opposite. Tony had wanted to push him away to the cost of disrupting the dancers around him. It’s Lady Virginia Potts’ sweet manners barely covering her barbed remarks thrown at the Alpha’s mortified face which had saved them both their reputations. When Tony had wanted to sit near the opened windows to get some fresh air, she had dutifully accompanied him only using her elbow as support for his hand. She had sat next to him until he felt better, her protective Alpha scent blocking all the other smells around. Tony had raised his gaze to thank her. He noticed for the first time that night how clear her blue eyes were under the candlelights of the ceiling, how fair and unblemished her skin was, how brightly her long reddish-blond hair shone.
A most convenient place to be in heat. Speaking of which, his skin has started to prickle since yesterday as if a thousand warm ants are running under it. Tomorrow, he will start to leak and become a desperate moaning mess once again, for his utmost embarrassment. Thank God, Bucky was in a too much similar state to make fun of him in these situations. Steve turns his head on the pillow to the sound of something clicking in the doorknob. He stands on his elbows, not wanting to rise from the comfortable bed, especially not to welcome his Alpha friend who must have taken a detour to reach him.
Peter shook his head and MJ piped in. “If he was a king then I wouldn’t be in charge. I wanna be in charge.”
Even though he had been dismissive of the ball when Steve first mentioned it, Tony had given into his ingrained curiosity. The constant discussion and planning had convinced Tony that it could be fun, especially the dancing. A small investment in magic usage and glamor spells and here he was in the crowd descending on the manse.
Tony had run away the moment he fell upon that scene. Suffice to say, it had been a catastrophic way to start the holidays. He couldn't even remember if Steve had called his name or not while he fled. Everything had felt blurry and hazy for two weeks, a painful and brutal mix of hot and cold sensations, especially at night, when Tony was alone, sprawled sluggishly on his bed with the same thoughts running in circle in his mind. His mark kept burning like it never did since he had been wearing it. Tony couldn’t help scratching it when no one could see him.
“Last I saw he had stepped out to look at a carriage,” Steve said. He turned his head back and forth looking for Bucky in the crowd.
"That is precisely where you lack insight, my love." His father's voice drops an octave. "Our son is running out of time. We travel a lot, anything can happen to us. And you fell terribly ill last year, have you forgotten? It tired your body.” He makes a pause by finishing the last drops of his coffee, his expression much sombre now. “We must not count on our health, be ready for any plausible outcome. Besides, Tony is old enough to hear about this."
He had full command of his house again and had come down for breakfast with Sam, Bucky and Natasha. He refused to talk about Tony.
“I understand you needed to be on your own for a while, after what happened to you. Perhaps, you were repulsed by having an Alpha around with your father coming back,” She pats his cheek. “But I thought...Oh. That’s silly of me, but I thought we would…I guess I just wanted to talk to you. To hear your voice. I was so scared for you.”
“A list of things we can and can’t do -- not getting mixed up with humans or human business covers most of it.” Tony pointedly looked at the scrap of paper in Steve’s hand. “I’m wondering where my stuff is.”
“Tony-” Steve gets up, his frown is back on his face but Tony is swimming fast now, he can’t stop him.
“Lady Virginia Potts,” his mother announces regally, her pale yellow dress fluttering in playful waves as she joins them. She holds a small book and flowers in one hand. “This woman is quite diligent in her pursuit.”
“Do you want to play Uno with me before they come back?” Steve asks louder, his arms standing rigid by his sides as if he could snap at any moment to slap someone’s face.
A scramble ensued and it took a few more minutes to get everyone settled at their tables and in their seats as he and his teaching assistant - a college student named Darcy - put all the appropriate supplies on the table.
“I don’t need -- fine, if you all think it’s a good idea.” Admittedly, Sam had a way of getting Steve out of situations that Steve felt his fists could resolve faster. He was on private business, not the King’s. Steve’s temper did add to the alpha illusion and a calming beta would help as well.
He hadn’t heard about the fair folk since he left for sea. Even though he kept the ways his ma had taught him and had the kitchen maid leave out milk and fresh baked bread.
The next day, his mother takes him to a morbid place in London. Tony blanches when he learns that it was there that two low-class Omegas were beaten, then hanged publicly, for they were caught having sex in a brothel. Alphas knotting one another receive the same treatment. As a Great Britain’s citizen, you can escape a brutal sentence thanks to your social standing, but nothing can save you from being exiled. During the entire trip back to the manor, Tony’s mother has grasped his hand and hasn’t let go when she mentions how a couple of Omegas in the countryside had tried to marry, by pretending one of them was an Alpha. The ruse didn’t last long, and they were forced to divorce. Some said they left the country; others claimed they were shipped away against their volition to an unknown place. No one had wasted their time to look for them. They were forgotten. Tony has crushed his mother’s fingers in petty retaliation. She isn’t responsible for any of this, but by God, he never felt so angry before! It’s as if someone has ripped a blindfold he wore his entire life without knowing it, and he was forced to see the truth even if it’s painful for his sight. Everything is ugly now. As the carriage follows its track offhandedly, Tony glares at the streets, glares at the buildings, and the strangers attending to their daily lives.
But Steve had been born under a lucky star. He’d had a most fortunate life as a navy officer, wildly successful in battles, given his country’s hightest recognition and awards, and amassed a large and significant fortune wisely invested. His one indulgence was purchasing a small remote estate. He now had independence, respect and the freedom to do as he pleased when he pleased.
“I will check in with you before dinner. If you need me, ring the bell. I will be working on invitations in my study.”
“You said the same thing two weeks ago, sir.” Jarvis interrupts gently. “The poor Lady must think you're indifferent towards her. It is not a good thing for your feelings to be misunderstood by someone you wish to marry. Another Omega may come into the picture.”
Sam frowned slightly. “Do you think that’s wise, housing an alpha fairy in your dressing room? Is he attached?”
Steve - gorgeous, gasping, blushing Steve - letting Rumlow having his way with him, sensually on display under the gazebo, the both of them hidden behind the large pines' shadows.
Steve was willing to put up with the inconvenience of not using his dressing room for a short time. Tony would be protected in the room from stray animals and he asked the maids to leave the room alone for a while.
"Your mother and I cannot guarantee your financial security if anything bad happens to us both. Our estate, our house, it will all belong to your cousin. Unless you wish to depend on his unreliable charity for the rest of your days, I’d strongly advise you to find a suitable mate this year, as soon as possible."
He should return back to the house for cards with his friends. The sun was finally setting behind the trees, and the slight breeze was delicious on his skin. The breeze could turn cold shortly and he hadn’t brought a wrap with him.
“He’s part spider, I swear,” Steve muttered to his boyfriend of two years, who was completely engrossed in his phone. “Tony?”
Matt said calmly and something in Steve twisted. Peter had a good life at Allensville, and good friends in MJ and Ned. To rip him away from that because Steve was uncomfortable went against everything he felt as an educator.
“A ball. Hosting a party would be good for you,” Natasha pointed out. “Weird recluse is not a good look, Steve.”
Tony’s face told Steve all he had to know. His face felt red as he remembered his fond thoughts and unspoken hope. “I understand,” Steve said briskly. “You are a fairy on a mission and now that you are healed, you need to get to your work.”
“It’s just-” Tony wets his lips, his heart pounding with iron fists against his ribcage. “I’m sorry. I wanted to apologize. I saw you both two weeks ago and I - I hope I didn’t interrupt anything or - Well - I didn’t talk about it to anyone-” Tony ruffles his hair with one of his hands to get his restlessness under control.
“I do not-” Tony starts to say. He wets his lips. “She’s agreeable but I don’t wish to marry anyone.”
“It looks so pretty,” Angela murmurs in awe. “Where did you learn to sew like this?” The question, though innocent, rises Steve’s hackles.
Now that Tony was more fully awake and fortified with coffee, he got a better look at built-like-a-brick-house Steve. Designed by someone who liked their omegas large, muscular, attractive and endowed. “Tony,” he replied, holding out the thimble again.
Even though he had been there to hear what Steve was planning, Tony had not anticipated how resplendently beautiful Steve would be in the candlelight of the ball.
At the same time as Steve was having his mind blown, Tony was wrestling to keep his anger under control.
Steve had no idea why there needed to be hats, or why they needed to be matching, or why MJ was involved, but he let his brain rest on the idea that he affected Tony the same way Tony affected him.
He sighs in capitulation and waits for the final root to be snipped as he looks at the sky. Once he hears the sound of his mother putting her pruner back on the table, she kisses his cheek tenderly.
Steve’s head whipped up from his phone to see Peter standing in front of his desk. The kids were all supposed to be outside for recess, though, so…
“Then it’s Prince. Queen MJ and Prince Peter,” Steve explained, cutting off the parental secrets hour before it could get going and the two beamed at each other.
“You should come to the capital for the fall season,” Bucky said. “We can make up the guestroom on the second floor of the house -- you’ve always liked that room.”
“I don’t want --” Steve started. “I could see the capital but not the Baths.” He wasn’t keen on revisiting his past with other retired officers.
Tony proffered another tiny list. “You’re not supposed to know we exist,” he added. “It’s the whole fairy code.”
“I could say the same about you.” Steve chuckles. “I know you had lots of sexual experiments, so I was surprised you were so...weird about it. I only fucked with Brock that one time. I just needed some relief, but you've been looking at me as if I did something very horrible, and it just confuses me.”
Jarvis doesn’t say anything when Tony stays in his father's workshop to spend his few and precious hours of building, dismantling rifles and pistols, instead of saluting Mr Rogers and his Alpha partner when they deliver the usual bags of flour, sugar, stacks of eggs, and bottles of milk. Jarvis keeps his mouth shut as well when Tony draws the curtains closed so he wouldn’t see the blonde Omega's tired and resigned face outside the windows. And Jarvis doesn’t utter a single word when he finds the young master crying in the library one night, but he does bring a cover to warm him, some sheets of paper and drawing tools he could use to make progress in the schematics of new vessels he recently imagined.
“Whoever that berk who will wear this is, they’re very lucky.” An Omega says in the back of the room, breaking that floating moment they were all absorbed in.
A couple of weeks later, Steve spared no expense in holding a dinner party for all of their friends. Tony’s friends Rhodey and Pepper had come to stay with them for a short while. Steve had been given to understand that Rhodey wanted to confirm that Steve was good for Tony.
“Of course we would have! You’re an Omega. What if that stranger was ill-intentioned? Yes, he did save you, but he could have used this opportunity to attack you or steal anything in our home!” His mother retorts in an outburst of indignation.
Dizzy from Tony’s presence, Steve nodded in agreement with him, as if he knew Tony’s plan. “Perhaps Mr. Rumlow has not checked his mail?”
“I mean, if you don’t want to speak about it, I won’t pry or-” Tony backpedals immediately, afraid he made another mistake to get on Steve's nerves.
Like I said in the past chapters : don't repost that artwork elsewhere without my authorization. If you want to see more of my drawings you can go to Twitter : @kappamairi.
Tony cut him off with a longer, sloppier kiss. When he pulled away. “I’m in this and you know that. They don’t matter. They make money off of other people’s pain or distract themselves with it, depending on who ‘they’ are. Peter loves you, I love you, and hell, Pegs is about ready to adopt you.”
Just maybe, just once, it’d be nice to get something he deeply wanted. It just wasn't meant to be with Tony.
“Isn’t it the fourth time she offered courting gifts?” his phlegmatic father asks, turning one page after the other. "I lost track of the count." He swipes away nonchalantly the crumbs out of his book before closing it, completely at odds with the chaos disrupting his son’s mind.
“I could wear the uniform --” His formal, more formal, and seriously formal naval uniforms were packed away in storage. “Or have a formal coat and pants made.”
Stark’s phone must have rung at that point, because he stopped, looked at the device and sighed heavily.
Steve blushed as the dressmaker and her assistant held up fabrics against his skin. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught Tony daring to sneak looks as Natasha and Steve talked about which fabric would be best for the ball.
“Do you need help to harvest some more?” One of his hands indicates the garden in a jerk. “I could supply you with some bark or…”
Tony flushes with pride at the mention of the king but he deflates rapidly. The king is too busy with that Jacobite rebellion to meet him and his father. This sounds like something his Majesty could have said in passing without any serious intent behind it. Besides, Tony sneers at the idea of being surrounded by the courtiers, who would listen to them, enraptured, but who would fail ultimately to understand or to challenge their ideas. As an Omega, he would just serve as a new form of entertainment. His father’s company takes most of the credit of the ships’ commissions anyway. His name doesn’t appear on any paper. He’s known only by reputation because noble Omegas are not supposed to work.
Steve had heard Peter talk about ‘Dummy’ a lot and assumed it was a pet of some kind. “Why would your dad bring your dog to a meeting?”
Tony had lovely manners for an alpha, though he fell on the prettier side of the scale than the handsome side. He could be mistaken for an omega if he went out and about with his wavy hair arranged artfully and the color of his face brought out with an ascot. Steve’s makeshift clothes did not do Tony any justice at all.
“Hmmm,” Steve said as he put the cozy over the drawer. “I’m going to take him upstairs. It’s too drafty down here.”
“I know I’ve been clumsy with you and you find me really annoying - Pepper keeps telling me I’m a hot mess - I didn’t mean to piss you off. I never wanted that-”
“I understand. Let’s see. If you work for another family in the countryside, but not too far away from London so I can keep an eye on you, you’d be happier?”
Steve blinked at his phone and then stared towards the horizon where the Starks’ car had disappeared to. He wasn’t quite sure how long he stood there, but the sun was a little lower than it had been. He wandered back inside his classroom, gathered his things, and then headed to his car in a daze.
The comic is complete now UwU/ Thank you for joining me in this ride <3 <3 Each comment, kudo and bookmark made me very happy, I'm grateful for it and will cherish it.
Tony admired the slight blush that crossed Steve’s face as they both remembered how exactly Tony ended up here. Steve showed some promise since he brought coffee and didn’t question Tony’s name. Humans he’d found over the years had weird ideas about fairies. “Bruised, battered and sprained. I’ll heal.”
"Well, as long as he marries a wealthy Alpha so they can keep an eye on his cousin, we shall all be fine," his father snaps harshly, opening his newspapers like a shield he brandishes between himself and any argument his spouse or son would throw at him.
Tony told Steve he was going to barricade himself in the wood shed so he could avoid all humans. While Steve would have appreciated having Tony there, he couldn’t blame the fairy. All his neighbors and then some had accepted Steve’s invites and the house would be full of humans. Not a safe environment for an injured fairy.
Steve shook his head. “We’ll see. I had thought of offering to invest, and shut them down that way.”
Steve stares at him, his eyes wide open in bewilderment as if the sky has just torn itself in two to reveal a rain of falling stars.
Each detail appears in flashes, much brighter than they were when Tony and Mr Rogers stood together in that damned library. The colours are enhanced to the point that the vines streaming on his home’s walls are as vivid as the old oak tree’s leaves standing in the distance, intensifying even the flowers and their perfume. Tony feels a bit dizzy. He stumbles and clings to some bricks of the main arch leading to the garden to reclaim some stability. The coarse stone under his fingertips anchors him. He blinks rapidly, his scattered thoughts reconnecting to each other one by one after a few minutes. He finally manages to regain his composure as he turns his head to look at the garden, welcoming him with a nice flagstone pathway leading to the centre; that same centre being connected to four smaller tracks made of gravel and grass. Each one of them guides the visitors to four different inviting parts. As Tony ventures in the garden, walking down the steps and through the pathway, the repetitive sound of his feet crushing some pebbles appease his anxious thoughts. His mother is very insightful but he doubts she already knows exactly what he discovered about himself in his time of seclusion. He guesses she only wishes to see his face, to know how he fares and if he needs anything for the upcoming weeks. Perhaps they would talk about the new ball they would attend at the Van Dyne’s estate soon. There is no legitimate reason to be concerned over this exchange.
Tony could see the outline of the human as he approached. He shivered from a cold breeze from the window. Then the human’s scent hit him, sweet and floral with wood tones. Omega. Likely unbonded as well. Tony sighed exasperatedly. He did not need this. He’d been good, decent, even ate his vegetables occasionally. Why him?
“The plan endures,” Tony commented and then took a breath and Steve turned his head to see Tony staring directly at him. “He’s officially in first grade? Right? You’re absolutely not his teacher anymore?”
“Let’s talk business, Rumlow. I want the mill. I have money and you need my money,” Tony flatly stated. He patted Steve’s arm. “If you return to the carriage, we can head home as soon as I am done here, Captain Rogers and Mr. Wilson.”
Yes, I have a headcanon of Thor being very sensitive and feeling when two people are having the best time of their life in bed UwU He's not the god of fertility for nothing <3
He had a hard time explaining what Tony was working on to Bucky during their morning ride. “He’s remarkably smart and inventive,” Steve said fondly.
“I don’t know and I didn’t ask. I didn’t realize he was even an alpha until I got a slight whiff of his scent when I held him up to the window.”
Even better, Steve saw Tony staring open-mouthed as he walked down the grand staircase. Tony’s friend, Rhodey, nudged Tony. “Don’t.”
Steve moved on at that point and so did the day. Before long, it was 3:30 and time for the students to get picked up. Steve was one of the staff on the schedule that day to make sure all the students got in the right cars or on the right busses and he loathed carpool duty. No one followed the rules exactly, parents stopped to chat with each other instead of driving in an orderly fashion…
A quick assessment of the mill room yielded no tools like a hammer or an axe. Steve could do a lot of damage with an axe. Maybe that plank over there.
They never talked about all the rancid-smelling corpses accumulating in the open air while walking in London before, perhaps because they both knew they would be uncomfortable to mention it, and realize how indifferent they came to feel about this situation. That city made them live near things they wouldn’t have stood to see in normal circumstances. Who knew where it could escalate? They could be the next people to be buried in the overflowed cemeteries in a month or a week. This constant fear had been a part of their daily lives from a long time, but Steve deeply feels in his bones that both of them deserve better. And now, it’s the right moment to make some real change.
He worried about his neighbors. Wealth and fame insulated him very much from criticism and he was well aware that he was an oddity of being both a war hero and a wealthy unmatched omega. Almost fit for a zoo or museum exhibit.
The evening is warm but with a fresh, gentle breeze accompanying them, so they’re not suffocating like during the past two days. Tony is mystified by how Steve is gentle and fun during their game. He keeps smiling and even shows Tony the cards he drew and added to make the game even more hilarious to play. Tony feels grateful his friends are not there so he can share such a nice moment with him. They’re completely relaxed with each other.
The worst possible time for his heat to kick in. Now, Steve had worked missions before while in heat. But he and Sam were not armed, and there were likely to be civil consequences should Steve knock out Rumlow, not least of which would be a failure to close the mill.
“An Omega, you refused to mention to us, is the reason why you felt so troubled you had to isolate yourself. From me. From your father,” she states in a low voice, detaching each word methodically. Yet, fear and uncertainty are showing in her posture, her shoulders and back straightened, her neck rigid. Tony can smell something sour in her usually sweet and honeyed Omega scent.
Now Tony didn’t understand human manners and dances all that well, but he did pick up that perhaps dancing each dance with Steve was not proper. But he couldn’t resist. Steve was gorgeous and easy to talk to as they waited to take their turns.
"I know Brock is the worst choice, he can be a real asshole sometimes. Having sex with him is not something I'm proud of," he mumbles.
Tony taps on the paper with his pencil, his mouth twisting in opposite lines, but Jarvis makes no move to leave. Tony bites his lips in frustration, then turns around to reach for Lady Virginia Potts’ letter. At the corner of his eyes, he can see a glimpse of a very personal portrait he never showed to anyone before, hidden between the pages of a sketchbook. He’s not talented at all to draw human figures. Enginery is the only thing which has an appeal to him in picturing except Mr Rogers. It’s just a silhouette with two bright blue dots on a barely sketched face. Yet, the value Tony attaches to it is very strong. His eyes well up in tears as he pushes the sketch further away, so he doesn’t see it anymore. Then, he opens Lady Virginia Potts’ letter with shaking fingers.
His biggest problem relies on its velocity; the ship is too heavy and the cost of fabrication too high. Against a lighter and cheaper Dutch fluyt, his ship would fail against its competitors, even if it could bring a bigger cargo and has stronger protection from any enemy. He bites his nails, lost in thought. He could try to mix the two designs, finding an in-between, but that’s the safest and less interesting road, and Tony hates the safest roads for they bring nothing revolutionary on the table. It still unnerves him that no one has still taken any interest to bring these fascinating pumping and steam engines on the table. He found out about them when he had read some letters between Thomas Newcomen and his father, the latter wanting to improve the design of Mr Newcomen's engine, turning it into something less-wasting in energy with a brand new condenser.
“What you get to do for the next thirty minutes is to make a cap for yourself! It can be anything you want, you just need to be able to wear it. Miss Darcy and I will be helping you with things like glue and staples and things to make the hat make a shape, but you have to tell us what you want it to look like. So think hard, artists, and dream big!”
“I do,” Tony says in a hollow voice. “I understand…it’s not something approved nor rightfully explained by anyone in our society.”
Why did he behave in such an impulsive and lewd way that night? He flushes in mortification as he recalls how aroused he had smelt and the wetness dripping on his skin. Mr Rogers had only touched his face yet managed to reduce him to this state! His teachers would have baulked at his tasteless behaviour. Smelling aroused in public is the most embarrassing situation to be in, adults tolerate it when it happens by accident in the early stages of adolescence but he is twenty years old; he should know how to control himself! Jarvis is the one who should have taken care of Mr Rogers wounds. He even volunteered, but Tony had immediately interfered to do it in his stead, rushing to the Omega’ side into such close physical proximity that his mother, who always encourages him to be nurturing and kind to Omegas, would have disapproved. At first, Tony thought he acted out of compassion because he couldn’t bear the sight of an Omega in pain, but he has since realized that an unhealthy dose of dishonesty had clouded his judgment and his morals. He had enjoyed touching Mr Rogers. He had taken advantage of the situation so he could share a private moment with him, regardless of the consequences.
“No problem," Tony says in a stilted voice, annoyed at hearing Steve admitting he enjoyed what Rumlow did to him. "It happened to me many times before. I don't want you to be embarrassed about it, that’s all.”
Tony watched Steve make his way through the crowd and then turned to see Natasha’s sharp eyes on him. “Don’t hurt him,” Natasha said bluntly. “I’ve been looking out for him for years and Steve deserves an alpha that will understand him.”
Dinners with his friends had turned into planning for the ball. Steve and Natasha would be spending the rest of the day writing out invitations and Steve was not looking forward to it.
Natasha kindly saw to removing Tony’s things without letting Steve know what was left behind. Steve knew he’d be hurt if he saw any of it.
Tony soon proves to be extremely clever, pragmatic and sensible in learning how to attend to the estate’s economic affairs. He knows how to rule a house and its staff; people enjoy to gravitate around him in social gatherings. Gregory is popular as well but he’s much lazier and complacent in comparison; unlike Tony, he hardly takes any interest in the Stark industry and in learning how to deal with the economic issues he may face in the future. Even Edward, who had spoiled Gregory since he was a child, laments over his son’s careless nature, and how he wishes him to be more like his nephew. Therefore, his father and uncle tacitly agreed that the best option would be for Tony to marry a wealthy Alpha. It would bring him stability but also power to intervene if his cousin manages the family’s propriety in the worst possible ways.
“They left to buy some meat and peppers for the BBQ tomorrow,” Steve shrugs, clenching his fists on his knees, his gaze resolutely fixed on the wooden floor.
Meeting Mr Rogers once again - even if he dreads the mere idea - would be perfect to challenge the strength of his attraction and desire. Besides, he needs to apologize for the poor way they left each other that night and also for the shameful display he made of himself. He didn’t even have the time to bid him goodnight and to accompany him to the manor’s portal. Tony has to make amends. He can also invite Rhodey to his home so they could spend an afternoon together! His Alpha friend has a worldly point of view on many subjects; between his lower-class upbringing, his stellar social ascension and his many travels in the British Colonies for the Navy, he is the perfect source of information. If there is someone he can trust on this subject, it's Rhodey and no one else.
“It’s not magic!” Tony insisted. “It’s all science and natural philosophy. No magic needed. I save my magic for special occasions.” He sorted his papers together. “There’s nothing worse than technology used badly.”
Tony rests his head on his mother’s shoulder for a moment, then he makes a decision. He grabs the flowers, the book, and pats his mother’s joined hands in a clap.
Why yes, Steve was aware of the woman that Forbes had ranked as the country’s most powerful female alpha. Steve rolled his eyes as he said, “I’ve heard of her, yes.”
“When I want to,” Tony said. At least standing with Steve’s friends would ward off any competition for Steve’s attention.
. Having two Alpha sons had made his grandfather immensely proud, yet he favoured Howard over Edward. As he grew older, he refused to divide his property, so Tony’s father inherited the whole estate. Edward received a house in the countryside he could live in comfortably thanks to Howard, but his rank in society had lowered significantly. Fortunately, he was good-natured, he never harboured any resentment towards Howard who always supported him financially and encouraged him in his military career. His fate turned brighter when he married the heiress of a wealthy commercial family and soon regained his prestigious social status. Years went by, but none of the brothers managed to break their father’s entail for they found themselves in a delicate situation: Howard and Maria had trouble to conceive an heir. Since the two brothers were courteous men and wished to respect their father’s wishes, they vowed that the first Alpha child born from one of them will inherit their estates and the manors they possessed. Edward and his wife soon gave birth to Gregory. Yet, a surprise disturbed their carefully-laid plans a few years later: Maria almost lost her life when she finally succeeded to deliver a son to Howard. It changed everything.
“At least take Sam with you,” Bucky insisted while Steve waited for his carriage. “He’s reasonable.”
There was a brief break in the music as dancers set up for the next round. Tony pushed through the crush, aiming towards Steve. Steve was graciously greeting and nodding to his neighbors, enjoying their rave compliments on his house, renovations, gardens, food and the ball.
Of course you do, Steve bit back a smirk. He adored MJ and would basically punch anyone who dulled her inner fire later on in her life. “Ah, so then Peter is your consort.”
Natasha shared a look with Bucky and Sam because that was the signal that she had convinced Steve. “We can plan that out tomorrow.”
“The fucking Omega Protection Law says that unbonded omegas can’t pass down property to their children unless that child is an alpha,” Steve growled.
And, he realized, thinking about him as Tony for the first time as well. He’d had Peter in his class for eight months and had always thought of his father as ‘Stark’.
“Excuse me, would you put it under the light, please? So, we can have a better view!” The other pleads, their eyes sparkling with an eager glint.
Tony Stark was an Alphahole. This was public knowledge. He’d been an Alphahole since he finished at Allensville when he was 13 - even before he presented as an alpha. This was…
“That was quite the ceremony,” Tony remarked to Steve as Peter ran off briefly to go hug one of the classroom moms.
“- and I saw you going bright red when you looked at your phone. My daddy does that too and when I ask him why he says it’s because Mr. Steve said something funny. So are you red right now because Daddy said something funny?”
First Steve was stunned and amazed that he was holding a fairy. Fairies were myths and legends and he’d never heard of anyone who had seen one. This particular fairy was gorgeous in red and gold, coloring that extended to his delicate orange-red wings with black tips.
Tony goes back inside the house after he finishes swimming laps in the pool. As he's creeping inside the kitchen, he stops at the faint sound of a melody ringing in the air, coming from the old piano. Aside from droplets dripping from his body to the floor, he stands motionless. When he hears Steve’s voice, humming, Tony feels like his body and his mind are slowly disconnecting from each other, nerve by nerve. He walks with discrete steps, so as not to break the spell the music has cast on the house. The melody hypnotizes him, inciting his muscles to relax to the point of feeling like they’re made of a gelatinous texture. He thinks he recognizes the composer’s name who made the music Steve's playing, but he’s not sure - Jean Sibelius, maybe? The walls and the creaking wood under his feet exude a softness that was never there in the first place. The soulmark he had tried to hide with concealer since summer started burns bright on his inner thigh, pulling him towards Steve like a beacon.
Tony had to focus. He had a simple routine. He woke, tried his wings, got annoyed when his wings weren’t better, worked on signaling Rhodey or Pepper, made plans for how to stop the mill, talked with Steve, had dinner with Steve’s friends, and went to bed.
Tony planted himself right next to Steve, briefly touching his arm in a possessive manner. His nostrils flared a bit as he caught Steve’s scent, now stronger than before. “I’ve been securing the deed to this property and the forest beyond -- have you not received the mail from your investors?”
See you next week, for the last page <3 Once the comic is fully done, I'll make a post on Twitter with all the pages together with a few corrections on the panels (yes, I'm nitpicky).
“Peter?” Tony called, his voice clogged with tears. “Can you come here, quick, please? We have some important news.”
“It was a small fire -- easily put out.” Steve had thrown a glass of water on the pile of sparks, soaking Tony in the process. Steve might have laughed at Tony frantically wringing out his clothes as he complained about Steve saving his life. But that was not good manners.
“Would sir like to try fabrics?” the dressmaker’s assistant asked when she came to the door. Tony immediately ducked down so he wouldn’t be seen.
Mr Stark would crawl naked on the bed and lounge there, waiting for Steve to come to him with bated breath. Steve would first caress him, his firm thighs, his arms, then the curve of his bottom, with feather-like touches only because he thinks Mr Stark craves the softest sensations. He would peck his erected nipples before sucking them, rolling his tongue on the light chestnut buds, eliciting moans the brunet Omega couldn't contain even if he wished to. Then, after Steve finishes to mark his collarbone, Mr Stark's red lips would open like an invitation, begging for more kisses, a distorted picture of the night they found themselves in the library. Steve would provide for him because he wants to be tender with the lovely Omega but not too much or he would be too greedy about it. So, he would refrain from kissing his swollen lips after the third time. Mr Stark would complain, wouldn't he? Who is Steve to deny him such pleasure when he offers himself so generously? It's only when he's on the brink of tears that Steve would gently spread his thighs to reveal his leaking cunt, hidden behind brown curls. What a glorious sight it would be.
Steve did feel a lot of guilt that Tony was in the predicament he was in. His good manners, his sincere desire to see a fellow creature thrive, and his general excellent temper prompted Steve to keep checking in on Tony and to make sure that he was comfortable and healing.
Steve has a painful expression on his face and Tony resents himself for having made him feel that way. Something in him, raw and powerful, compels him to finally be clearer with Steve, more honest, to reach him. The rational part of Tony's brain knows it’s the neuronal and hormonal imprint of his soulmark which gives him this urge to communicate to the small blond. He feels it’s the right time to listen to it, after months of frustration and useless pining. His sincerity has allowed him to have this special moment with Steve, and Tony wants to experience more beautiful occasions like these in the future. Of course, the blond may not share his mark, perhaps this sudden inspiration is misleading him completely, and his deep attraction is one-sided. But right now, Tony is not scared of being ashamed or rejected. He’s tired of fighting against his feelings. He closes his eyes to channel more energy for the perilous dive he's about to make.
When the car did pull up at 4:07pm - seven minutes before Stark predicted, Steve noted grumpily - the man called out to his son the moment he got out of the car. “Petey pie! I’m so sorry, DUM-E didn’t want to get back on the plane, but then I told him it was for you and he moved a little faster.”
“You’ve dreamed of a full dress gown for years, Steve. You keep looking at that muslin embroidered with the spangles like a starved person looks at food.”
Tony’s soulmark sends tingles all over his inner thigh, igniting a small fire in his belly, and sparks in his soft member. He coughs and rearranges himself to be more comfortable on his chair, but also to hide the evidence of his growing arousal. Steve fiddles with the hem of his shirt, lost in thought.
“You mean…” Steve’s voice trembles and Tony is astounded at that because Steve hardly trembles, the rare times he does it’s because there is something he fears in front of him. And yet, he has never backed down to not confront it.
Tony startled from his work. “It’s not like I’m not going to fly again, Steve. It’d be handier right now. But I couldn’t ask for a better lugger-around than you.”
The fairy struggled a bit in the linen nest, as if trying to sit up and fly. Steve gently rubbed his back to reassure the fairy. The fairy leaned into Steve’s fingers.
A collective sigh follows that statement. Steve takes this as his cue to go back to his chair. He applies his final touches, checking if all the colourful threads are securely attached. He folds the garment in a neat square looking undisturbed and untouched by any hand who may have profaned its beauty. A few minutes after Steve drinks a full cup of water, he leaves the room, a bag on his shoulder, ready to deliver the product to the Beta shopper living not so far away from the workhouse. The flow of conversations starts again once he closes the door behind him like nothing had troubled it, especially not something smooth and beautiful to dream about.
Tony sighed loudly from his workbench. He’d been cranky since the morning. He woke up and found that his wing was still not completely healed and not reliable for flying. Plus they were moving back and forth between Steve’s bedroom and the dressing room and interrupting his work.
Steve felt the blush creeping up his face. He knew he was a good teacher, but it was always special to hear it from others. “Thanks, Matt. I do my best.”
“Bill’s up for a vote next week in the subcommittee,” Tony replied, in what to anyone else would be a non sequitur but Steve had a feeling he knew where Tony was going.
Steve knew immediately why Tony had been so deeply offended at the mill. Overly estimating his engineering ability, Rumlow had designed his lumber mill in the least efficient way possible, clear even to Steve and Sam’s uneducated eyes.
None of that was going to help Tony in the least get out of his current situation. He flexed his wings and wow, did that hurt. One wing bruised, the other wing sprained badly. He sighed. Not going anywhere until the wing recovered.
“Buddy, I’m not lonely,” Tony said, as his inner voice said liar. “I have you, I have Auntie Pep and Grandma Peggy and Uncle Rhodey and Uncle Matt.”
“I’m sorry you had to wait with me, Mr. Steve,” Peter said at one point as Steve played on his phone and Peter read his book.
“Last month in story time,” Peter replied, “he told us all about his best friend and then we got to meet Mr. Bucky. He’s married to Mrs. Nat who teaches in the big school and he has a metal arm, Daddy, a metal arm and he said it’s because he got in a bad accident when he and Mr. Steve were in college and Mr. Steve saved Mr. Bucky’s life. Mrs. Nat said it was true! And that sounds like me and MJ because I would do anything for MJ, like keep lots of secrets for her, and if Mr. Steve is a good friend then he’s good at secrets.”
Not that he let that stop him now. His wardrobes and chests were filled with an appropriate wardrobe for a young-ish omega of means. He could order art supplies he’d only dreamt of while he was served in the Navy. He stocked his library with the latest in historical and scientific works.
“I could set up your own table and chair. My friends have been keen to meet you formally.” Steve smiled gently at Tony, hoping to persuade him. From their interactions he found Tony to be interesting and of substance. His friends would agree.
That was not true. Steve hated it but he had a simple wool coat and pants and plain waistcoat and linen shirts for times he needed to conduct business and be taken seriously. All he needed to do was look the part of an alpha to be considered an alpha, even if he didn’t scent like one. Doing that always killed Steve a bit inside.
One of the great joys of his retirement lay in Steve’s clothes. Freed from the constraints of having to dress like the male alphas and betas he commanded, Steve was able to indulge in wearing dresses and jewelry like other omegas. Steve wasn’t built like the other omegas. He’d been blessed with height, muscly arms, and broad shoulders. A good body for hard work at sea, not so much for the lovely and graceful dresses Steve longed to wear.
To make the matter worse, hygiene was very low. Well, it was low everywhere in the streets, but somehow, probably because of promiscuity, it was even worse there. Steve always felt it was an open field where diseases seemed to spread fast. He knows barely anything about medicine but if there is one thing he’s good at is making connections. He noticed his health was slightly better and more stable when he takes a regular washing. Bucky follows his example for he has faith in his practical judgement. Steve has enough health problems on his own, he doesn’t need his life to be more complicated because he wandered in the wrong kind of places. The small tavern’s room feels like a manor in comparison to where they used to sleep.
When he was tired out by Tony’s love and his heat was spent, Steve stretched out and smiled tiredly at Tony. “Thank you for coming for me. Thank you for coming back.”
Then Rumlow hissed low and dangerous at Sam. In a handful of minutes, Steve was not going to be at his best, and they were not going to be in a good position to defend against an alpha going into rut.
“Then it will be of no matter to me, as I will be long gone by then,” Tony declared. “I must get back to my business.
“That was reckless of you, Antonio, very reckless. Why did you take that risk?” His mother stares at him judgmentally. Her tone is calmer than before but still icy.
"Hey, Steve! It's okay! You don't have to justify yourself. You did nothing wrong," Tony says in a pleading tone. "I've had my share of scumbags. I know how it is to have an itch to scratch, and sometimes the only option you got is something coming from the trash can."
Steve took the fairy, tea cozy and drawer up to his dressing room. He reckoned that would be the quietest place in the house. The dressing room was not the most organized room and Steve cleared off a small table and set it near the window. The fairy might recover in the night and wish to return home. He put the drawer on the table and tipped the cozy enough that the fairy could slip under it and leave if he wanted to too. Lastly, he opened the window a crack.
The workhouse is busy with chatter and cheers. The windows filter sun rays, dividing the heated room into rectangular pieces of light and shadows. Compared to other workhouses, this one is quite clean, free from too much dust. Its walls are bare, and not covered in food waste or filth, like in other places Steve had found himself unfortunate enough to work in before when he was a child.
Steve had given up on that idea years ago when he set out to sea and had to suppress any sign of being an omega. The option of family and children had evaporated back then. He’d met his neighbors and hope remained dead.
Tony turned to see his boyfriend - gaahhh, if that word didn’t just send him - approach the pool. He smelled terrible and Tony wrinkled his nose. “Baby, what’s the matter?”
Steve smiled and took a deep breath of the flowery, perfumed summer air. He looked so perfect and wonderful, and Tony knew how good, honest, and loyal he was. It made no sense to him that he could have fallen for a human omega, but Tony had not met anyone better and he wasn’t good at denying himself good things.
“A crown,” Peter said solemnly. “Because MJ wants to be the queen and so I told her I’d be her helper person but we didn’t know what kind of hat they had and MJ said I could still have a crown.”
“Stevie,” James says, clearly disturbed by the conversation, the wavering tone of his voice betraying him. “You've got to be blind not to see how rotten it becomes, but not everything is so horrible. We have auditoriums to go to, gardens, some exhibitions you like to see, even friends! And jobs! Where else do you want to find one? There’s almost none in the countryside. They're all taken!”
“Petey Pie, love of my life, apple of my eye,” Tony said, making sure to keep his voice calm. “Why did you tell Mr. Steve?”
Steve dug his fingernails into his skin, as his dizziness grew and his mouth ran dry. The slightest breeze on his skin made him almost groan.
What pleased him today was working on his art, a passion he’d had since a small child, and in the clothes that made him happy.
“But we never see them and when we do, it’s always about work and you get those squiggles in your face that mean you’re sad.”
And Tony was getting itchy. He wanted to ask Steve on a date, badly and for several reasons. One, he really did think the man was beautiful and desperately wanted to know what he tasted like. Two, Peter adored him and Tony understood why. And three? Well, it would be really nice to have someone in his life who knew everything who wasn’t also on his payroll.
Steve stares angrily at the ceiling, his arms crossed behind his head. Bucky is late. They recently found a decent tavern in town, two weeks ago. They chose to rent a room there tonight for a good price, so they could release some tension and joyously mate in the best and most comfortable conditions. Thankfully it was on the borders of London, far from the slums, closer to the countryside with a clear river not too far away, so they can get water to clean themselves a bit after their frolicking. Steve feels extremely grateful he met Bucky when they were children, for he is the safest partner he could find around. In London, there are some houses lower classes Omegas and Alphas may use when they wish to mate privately, instead of doing it in some disgusting alleys, late at night, because they don’t have a place to live in. Bucky and Steve could have gone there since it’s free but it’s rampant with randy - on the borders of threatening - Alphas in a rut. There was a time Steve was frightened one of them would force his way into his room to assault him right after Bucky left to take a piss outside. Fortunately, he came back at the right moment to chase him away. He still has goosebumps when he thinks about it. He had only been seventeen. Steve loathes these houses so much.
Tony adds bitterly in his mind when he remembers two or three Alphas too forward in their advances, but he refrains himself to mention it so he won’t spoil his mother’s joy.
"What? Your nieces in Milan?" He laughs unkindly. "They're children! They may love him now, but believe me, once they get married, it will change. Their future husbands may not like him nor want to be charitable towards him."
He hears Steve speaking some bits of broken sentences between their kissing, they're like the last missing pieces of an engine Tony had struggled to put together for so long: “You drove me crazy!”, "I hated it when you teased me so much.", “I panic every time you’re near.”, “Bucky kept telling me I’m scary when I’m too focused on something.”, “Tony, you feel so good.”. Steve sighs blissfully when Tony grasps his hard member through his beige shorts. They rut against each other, groaning, moaning in abandon. Steve grits his teeth in frustration, he opens his own shirt and throws it on the ground carelessly. Tony doesn't waste a second, he ensnares Steve's bony waist, catching his skin between his teeth. He leaves a trail of blooming, purple marks on his rosy neck, then he bites, and sucks hard on a spot right under his red ear. It’s the most delicious thing he’s ever tasted.
“I hope it’s not too much of a glow,” he said. As a rule, his heats had been very manageable since they started and he had a lot of experience hiding them. He was fairly regular, the heats were mild and easily concealed. He even consulted a calendar when selecting the date of the ball to avoid the possibility of a heat. “I’m not due for another three weeks.”

"Well, yes. We must. It displeases me as much as you, but we cannot avoid to speak about that subject any longer." He lowers his newspapers to pointedly stare at his son. "He heard you haven't married yet and sent me a letter complimenting our house, and how much he would
Tony scribbles furiously on a large paper. His desk is a mess of drafts, shortened pencils, rules, compasses, and mathematical calculations regarding speed, displacement, and length. The rain pours outside of the window, the dark sky a stark contrast to the warm light of the candlelights. The rhythm of the raindrops soothes Tony’s mind so his focus is sharper than usual. He has been drawing and redrawing the schematics of an important merchant ship the whole day. Three large and strong masts, over 1700 tons burthen, much more than a regular Indiaman, heavily armed against privateers, pirates and potential ill-intentioned rival merchants.
Tony looked stricken and Steve knew then that he wasn’t even supposed to see Tony before Tony left. “I see,” Steve said tightly. “You are always welcome here, Tony. I should attend to the cleaning downstairs.”
Thank you for your patience, folks. I chose to draw a bonus page with a bit of color on it as a gift for all the comments, kudos and gentleness you gave me through this comic. I'm happy you enjoyed it and expressed how much you loved it <3 <3 It was great to share this with all of you <3
Stark was the son of the son of the son of who founded the town and he carried himself like that mattered more than anything else. He owned the land the academy sat on, and a whole heap of other things, so the minute it was announced that Peter was born, the entire staff knew they’d be teaching him some day. They all assumed, however, that they’d be getting a spoiled brat - since Tony’s reputation at Allensville when he was a child still endured.
“It’s not your fault, Peter,” Steve smiled at the young boy, afraid Peter would get a complex due to his father’s irresponsibility.

No, Steve was a man of great sense and practicality. Fairies couldn’t be the answer. He picked up the basket and blanket. He glanced back to his picnic spot, in case he caught sight of the fox. But left with the uneasy feeling of still being watched.
His father is always silent when he takes a look at Tony’s sketches. His eyes jump from a drawing to another so fast Tony can almost see the cogs in his mind turning.  His father is not a man of words, but his proud smile and the way he claps one of Tony’s shoulder before returning to his projects are more than enough. Letting Tony rummage in his workshop, turning a blind eye to all the books he takes and reads, tell a lot of how much he wants his Omega son to devour all the knowledge he needs. It's his way to help him in his research, and creation because they both know it’s for a short term. As long as Tony is under his Alpha father’s rule, he's only tolerated to help him and work for him. Yes, it’s unusual for a noble Omega to have these interests. But, as long as he marries and fulfils his role to another Alpha, where’s the harm to let him entertain himself? The young ones need to have their share of fun! Tony heard this from his mother’s friends many times in the past. It amused him, but it irks him now for he’s painfully aware of how his freedom is limited, how no one aside of his close family and a very few business partners takes him seriously.
The brunet snaps out of his reverie. Steve has finished playing for a few minutes. Fuck. What can he say so he doesn’t look like a complete moron, planted as a piquet in the middle of the room, and only wearing his wet swim trunks? Quick, brain! Find something!
The idea that maybe he was dressing the prettiest he could and not for himself alone ran through Steve’s mind. A silly idea really.
And they could rest after this passionate mating UwU they deserve a good night and the softest dreams <3
Steve had begun to take tea with Tony in addition to their daily breakfasts. After pressing Tony to take another bit of cookie -- he noticed that Tony never ate nearly enough -- Steve suggested, “You could join us for dinner.”
Unless it's something more problematic, like a genuine attraction similar to the one he used to feel for Mr Stone. The matters of the heart are so complicated sometimes you can feel a powerful crush for someone then finding yourself at a loss when it suddenly disappears  like it never existed in the first place. This happened to Tony on many occasions though he admits he had taken an instant liking to Mr Rogers the moment he came to their house. The blonde Omega kept doing his best at his work, even if his health condition leaves a lot to be desired. Between his difficult breathing, scoliosis, and impaired hearing - Tony even suspects him to have poor eyesight but he never asked him - it’s thanks to his tenacity he survived for so long. Truly, it’s no hardship to admire him or secretly wishing to be his friend. How different it is now. The shift in his feelings had been so intense, Tony wonders if it has ever been here from the beginning, lurking in the corners of his mind, and revealing itself once the opportunity had arisen.
His conversation with Rhodey had put final damage to his battered hope. His friend had simply refused to continue the conversation.
"Antonio!" His mother lifts her head, a brilliant smile on her face. "I was wondering when you would show yourself! Come! Sit with me, my love." She pats affectionately on the free spot next to her.
Peter beamed and threw himself at Steve for a hug. “I knew it. You both make each other red! You should get married. I gotta tell MJ so we can make matching hats.”
Tony’s eyes slid back to his pile of paper. Steve packed up his pencils. He learned to not ask questions he didn’t want the answers to. Tony was passionate about saving his forest and with his wings noticeably better, it wouldn’t be long before he left.
Steve shot Sam a look. Sam could hold his own in any fight, and he was already maneuvering his way between Steve and Rumlow.
“We’ll have to figure it out. Paper and something to write with should be easy.” Steve tapped his pen thoughtfully against his chin. “He’s going to be with us until his wings heal.”
Tony joined Steve when he escaped to do some sketching in the side garden. Steve appreciated the quiet company as Tony worked on his design and Steve sketched him. Tony flicked his wings on occasion. Steve saw that his right wing was not dragging as much as Tony fidgeted around.
And from now on, Steve swore he will try to have hot sex with Tony as far as possible from Thor because he can't handle the embarrassment UwU (but he failed of course, no matter the distance, Thor can still sense it <3)
He stands up with the tissue in his arms once the other Omegas have ceased to stick to him, aligning themselves so it looks like Steve is walking in the middle of a royal alley with nobles surrounding him on each side. Once he’s close enough to a window, he opens his arms as wide as he can to display all the patterns on the silks. Light pinks, blues and greens are shining, interwoven in different flower shapes on the creamy base. The whole ensemble glows peacefully under the sun. Some Omegas have stopped in their motions to stare wistfully at the cloth Steve is showing delicately, like a precious treasure only reserved for the gazes of a selected few.
Steve was as angry as anyone else at the terrible situation for omegas in America. They’d once enjoyed quite a few more freedoms, but the 1980s brought a rise to power of a faction of incredibly conservative alphas who decided that omegas were not to be trusted as anything else but wombs. As a particularly small boned omega who’d had a lot of health problems growing up, Steve’s womb was pretty much closed for business and he resented that that fact meant he was useless in a lot of people’s eyes. He went to marches and signed petitions and canvassed for progressive candidates, but….
“Stop your nonsense!” Steve sputters, his cheeks all red. “He doesn’t need anyone else in his staff! It’s already full!”
Is it even possible for two Omegas to forge a romantic bond as strong as one between an Alpha and Omega? Furthermore, the need for an Alpha is so overwhelming for people of his kind, especially during heats, it’s almost impossible to deny it or live without it. Betas paired with Omegas are rare for a reason. Unless his teachers had biased opinions on that matter and had taught him wrong for whatever reason. Tony realizes he had learnt as much from his companions as from the education his family provides for him. For, there was a time he heard crude gossips from his group of friends, during an afternoon tea session. They had chatted excitedly about that embarrassing situation where two Omegas, acquaintances of theirs, were rumoured to have been caught in the middle of the night, almost naked and locked in a passionate embrace. Needless to say, no matter how true or false these accusations were, it had ruined their reputation for good. Tony never heard of them again. He wondered at times where they could be.
For Steve, heats are always a blurry and frantic mess of heightened sensations, lubrification mixed with sweat, Bucky’s dick sliding in and out, and short breaks for Steve’s fragile heart to rest because its beating was either too fast or too slow for no reason during the day. Sex, unfortunately, tends to increase the symptoms. Bucky intervenes immediately at the first signs, his calming pheromones appeasing him rapidly. It does the trick. Steve would say it’s even quite helpful at some times because it forces Bucky to slow down and to take his time for Steve’s pleasure, his hips rolling more seductively against Steve’s thinner ones, plunging his dick in his cunt slower. As Steve rolls on his back for Bucky to take him from behind, something wicked sparkles in the Alpha’s eyes. Steve should feel a bit alarmed by that - unwittingly aroused too - his friend can be such a trickster in bed when he feels like it but he lowers his defences when Bucky limits himself to caress his bony hips. He leaves a trail of kisses from his pointed shoulder blades to his neck where his bonding gland is pulsating, and then he dares to murmur:
If nudity and sex make you feel uncomfortable, please close the tab. This art and comic belongs to me, don't repost it elsewhere without my authorization. If you want to see more of my art, go check it at @kappamairi on Twitter.
Steve lowers his head, even more, revealing his neck and ears. Tony notices how very red they are. He takes a step back when Steve rises suddenly from his stool to stare at him with a deep frown on his face. Oh no. What did he do now?
“Do you miss flying?” Steve asked. He’d gotten too used to Tony being around. Maybe too used to seeing the fairy at breakfast, tea and dinner, talking about books, art, gardens, waterworks, whatever crossed Tony’s brilliant mind.
“I know.” Steve could call in favors. He wished he’d thought of that earlier when he first met Tony. A letter from Sir Fury would end any and all mill business. But Tony had seemed so confident he’d done enough damage, and Steve, perhaps, was besotted at the time.
“That mill though.” Tony sighed deeply. “I hope that the mill owner hasn’t restarted or fixed all the things I sabotaged. If he destroys the forest, innumerable fairies and other creatures will lose their homes and be turned out into the world. There’s not many places to go that have that old earth magic like that old forest.” Steve nodded. “It’s so wasteful, Steve -- he’d be better off using a mill wheel or the sun to power the mill -- see I figured out how to harness the sun’s light to run the mill --”
He fetched some punch for Steve, as they decided to sit out the next dance. Natasha and Sam stood with them. “You can change into human form?” Sam asked.
“You’re still reminiscing about the Alpha who hurt you?” she inquires with a worried glance at her son.
Standing next to Steve, Sam leaned forward to see what Steve was jotting down on a separate piece of paper. “Where are we going to get half of these things? Clothes?”
"Yup. You can say that again," Steve sighs dejectedly. He blushes while grimacing. "Sorry, we made a show of ourselves. I mean - it felt good but still, we should have been more careful."
“Relax, Stevie,” Bucky says with a swagger in his walk as he bends low to pour water from a pitcher in a porcelain basin on the floor Steve had previously brought. He takes one of the bar of soap on the dresser. “We just kissed and rutted against each other for a bit, that’s all. No clothes off. It’s not my fault if I can’t get rid of her scent.”
Steve whisked the fairy back to the parlor where Nat, Bucky and Sam were sitting. He pulled out a drawer from the side table in the hallway and brought into the room. He put it on a table, looked for something soft for the fairy.
“But the Omega Rights Movement is gaining ground,” Steve said. “In the last three years, we’ve gotten so many new rights.”
“I had the whole staff protecting me!” Tony stands up and starts to pace, rising his arms in aggravation. “I’m not a child who always needs to be watched for every minor thing! Besides, he was an Omega! He's one of the most gentle and brave souls I ever encountered. He would have never hurt me…”
Tony considered his options while the human went off in search of breakfast. Wings, useless. He had a set of tools in his doublet but nothing to work on. Pepper wasn’t expecting him back for another week. Rhodey would likely consider sending out a search team, but they’re never going to find him in this place. Especially since he wasn’t supposed to be within miles of this estate.
After Tony watched them play cards in the drawing room, Steve brought him back to the dressing room. For the first time, Steve was reluctant to say goodnight, wanting to keep the evening going, to hear more of Tony’s intriguing stories and hear his laugh.
“Tony, here’s what you requested,” Steve said. He held up a basket filled with various bits and scraps.
“Doesn’t matter,” Tony sighed. “I’m probably too late.” He looked out the window. “There’s a mill owner who is cutting down an ancient forest to power his mill. I have to stop him.”
Steve let his hand wander slightly as he looped their pinkies together. “Absolutely not his teacher.”
“A ship with cannon would accomplish the task better. Or a letter from court. That’s my other option.”
“He must have done quite an impression on you if the memory of this Omega is stronger than what this Alpha did to you,” she murmurs. “Don’t you think?”
“What you need to do is throw a ball,” Natasha said as they lingered in the dining room with the last of the dessert and glasses of wine. The last of the day’s sunlight streamed through the open windows.
But never in his life did he think about the indignity of not being able to pass something down to your child.
I started this story with something much shorter in mind but once I started diving into research for this era, I just couldn't stop @_@;
He fluffed up the napkins as best he could and lined the drawer. He laid the fairy in the linen nest, hoping he didn’t hurt the injured wing more. “He might have had a concussion.”
“Hmm, I hope so.” She nods languidly. “I thought of growing mulberry trees for next year. Its berries are very good for sore throats.”
When Tony asked him if he would ever want his hand in marriage, Rhodey had shaken his head and ruffled his hair.
Steve’s ma told him when he presented, he’d never be beautiful or cute, but he was sturdy and that mattered more. Handsome was for alphas, pretty for omegas. And so Steve was neither. He’d have to shift along best he could in life.
Steve never had such a wonderful heat before. He let himself get swept up by Tony, let himself go free, fully trusting in Tony to take care of them both. Tony buried him in kisses, endearments, touches meant to caress and arouse. Steve never felt loved like this -- completely and thoroughly. Tony told him he was beautiful and perfect and everything he could ever want. Steve soaked up his words, touches and love like the desert soaks up rain. He was meant to be here, right here, entwined with Tony, sharing all possible intimacies.
“I will not leave this room until you read her letter and answer her. Any choice you make in what you’ll write to her Ladyship is yours and yours only, sir.”
His mother lowers her chagrined face to the ground. Tony puts his hand on her knee to comfort her, his mouth stretched in a flat line. They both know how his father is right about the situation, but none of them appreciates to hear it. At least, he has the good sense of being self-conscious about how his frankness can be damaging for others, but he won’t make any apology even if the atmosphere is so loaded they don’t dare to say anything else. His father is indeed very talented to ruin good breakfasts.
Tony looks at the fountain so he won’t meet her gaze directly. He lets the silence linger on a bit longer to gather his courage.
This page was harder for me to draw, especially the posings U_U; Tiredness is bad for inspiration. I hope you will still enjoy it :3
Tony and Steve have some sweet fun together, feeling more at ease. Steve is taking charge in a surprising way UwU <3
"Even if Tony finds no husband or spouse, my family will always welcome him." She twists her hands on her lap, dignified and resolute.
After five dances, they took a break from the crowded room and headed out to the gardens and the cool evening air. Many of the other ball attendees also had the same idea. Steve walked to the edge of the garden hedge. The full moon shone brightly above them. Steve’s jewelry sparkled in the moonlight and Tony longed to kiss him. He shouldn’t -- he wasn’t planning to stay and Natasha’s warning echoed in his ear.
Just like the melody the blond played before, everything is on the right tune, no strident note, no interruption. They both speak in a very harmonious tone like they're both flowing on the same peaceful river. Tony had felt the strong potential of their connection since the day his mark appeared, right after he met Steve, and he is ecstatic he can finally see a glimpse of it.
Steve held out his hand to Tony to lead him to the top of the line of dancers. Steve was the host of the ball, after all, and he started off each dance. And it was fun! Tony never had such fun before as he and Steve laughed their way through the figures. Next thing Tony knew, the dance was over.
“Someone is moody, today.” Bucky’s chuckle resonates in the room, his back turned to the door to safely close it. “Hello to you too.”
“He’s an early prototype of the kind of robots that Daddy and Grandma Peggy think could help people who can’t move right by themselves. Auntie Pepper’s in a wheelchair, did you know that, Mr. Steve, and she sometimes can’t reach things on high shelves and so Daddy wants to make things for Auntie Pepper to go shopping better.”
Thank you to all the people who left amazing and sweet comments at the second chapter :3 I'll take the time to answer each one !
“Forget about this Tony. Mr Rogers, your attraction,” he had said gravely, sipping his tea then patting his hand in comfort. “Forget about all this; it’s much better this way. Besides, it’s not as if Alphas don’t appeal to you, right? Marry a good one, and you’ll be safe and content for the rest of your life.”
"It was a very entertaining evening," he says, stirring his spoon inside his coffee before taking a long sip. "People were exceedingly nice to me."
Rhodey had looked outside the window with an indecipherable expression. Tony had wondered what he may be thinking about, so he did the same thing as his friend. The view of the garden, its trees and walls, had ignited a spark in Tony's chest. There is a landscape behind those walls. There will always be something ahead of him.

“It is true,” Jarvis sighs, then straightens himself. “Master Anthony, if I may, won’t you please honour the promise you made to your mother and answer Lady Potts?”
An impulse induced by the danger Mr Rogers and Tony both endured when they were facing that Alpha? Did it spark some sort of temporary bonding between them, triggering their biologies in unsettling ways? It can be. Yet, Tony has no concrete proof to support that. For this hypothesis to be true, he would have to face danger again, in different settings, and in the company of different Omegas to be sure of this. It could be a really interesting experiment, but he fears it wouldn't be approved by society at large, which is quite unfortunate if people ask him.
The tea bell rang. “Back to work,” Steve said. “I’ve strategized my share of battles at sea but all this ball planning is rough work.”
The prospect of inviting his friend lifts his spirits, a new surge of energy ripples inside his body. Tony puts his feet on the floor, moving his covers aside, ready to finally stand up off his bed. He stops when he takes a look at his bedside table. His mother’s favourite tea service is standing proudly on it, with its striking painted roses arranged in small bouquets, intertwined with golden leaves. A full teacup has been waiting patiently for him this whole time. He contemplates it with curiosity. Tony is not as interested in art as his mother. Far from it. He fails to understand exactly how the rules work when it comes to style, pleasing aesthetics, tasteful decorations or what is the best way to match plates and cutlery together in the dining room, though he tries to fake it as best as he can during social gatherings because that’s what was expected of him. Yet, even though he can’t relate deeply to his mother’s preferences, he always pays attention to what she enjoys the most, and he noticed she had used this service when she was alone or when she received close friends at home. It means she must be the one who prepared this.
But Steve was already out the door and on his way. Work would be the best healing for him. And he didn’t want to poison his last sweet memories of Tony from the ball or from the other lovely times that they had together.
“Don’t upset yourself, tesoro mio,” his mother says softly. “This exchange won’t be as uncomfortable as you may think. What you share with me is safe from your father.”
Sensing Tony’s discomfort, Jarvis decides to stop talking. His gaze lands on the flowers of Lady Virginia Potts standing sluggishly in a long vase, with her book and letter underneath, still unopened. Tony follows the direction of his look and huffs.
“But that was a big risk to take, Peter,” Tony said, realizing that being mad at his kid wasn’t going to get them anywhere. “How could you know that Mr. Steve would be a good secret keeper?”
Steve suddenly felt lighter and smaller. Then Tony gathered him up in his arms. “This won’t hurt a bit, darling.” He murmured a few words and Steve was whisked away into a swirling cloud.
Fan, you great owl, I hope these last pages of your prize satisfied you. It was a pleasure to make this for you :3
Steve had left all the glad-handing and fussy events behind when he retired from the navy. But as much as he loved his home and his freedom, he was lonely. Having dinner with the neighbors would be a good thing. And he needed to do some of the social niceties to have that option.
Besides, Steve was still human. Fairies and humans didn’t get along in the best of times. Tony lifted his wings, and felt immediately the unnatural tug on his right. He had to get better soon to get back to his mission and before he did something stupid like fall for the giant human.
Tony leaned forward and then caught himself. They were among people who could see them. He settled for lifting Steve’s hand and kissing his knuckles. “Thank you for a wonderful evening,” he said.
This whole inheritance mess is the result of a mistake from his paternal grandfather, the late Edmund Stark, who put an entail to his estate.
“Dad had a big meeting today with Auntie Pepper and Grandma Peggy. He had to fly all the way to Washington and yell at the people in the big round house,” Peter continued. “He told me all about it last night. Dummy went, too.”
Tony, he thought with a smile on his face. Steve remembered the touch of Tony’s lips on his gloved knuckles. So different in intention than when he would take Tony from room to room in the mansion. Maybe -- maybe there was something there. Steve had not been in love before -- it had been too risky for his career to let anything progress beyond a slight infatuation. But now, he had nothing to fear.
Tony wets his lips. What he will say will change what she thinks of him. Either he lies, pretends his attraction is almost gone. They could fool each other until they got tired of this new superficial relationship they built out of comfort or he finishes to reveal everything to the cost of putting a strain on their bond. How foolish he has been to think he would feel lighter by the end of this conversation.
After a few days, when the heat is completely over and the pair is ready to leave the tavern, the blonde Omega decides it’s time to confess something.
All that he could see was his -- the house behind the orchard and garden, the rolling fields, and this creek and tree. The rest of his property extended into woodlands and fields farmed by tenants.
“And still, your father has taken your schematics from last week with him and presented it to Lord Stane. I’d say he hadn’t seen such an amazing idea coming from someone so young for a long time, sir!” Jarvis adds, his eyes twinkling with joy. “Rumours are spreading about the king himself. He had shown interest in meeting you and your father.”
Tony marvels at all the possibilities behind these new machines his father has since spoken about for weeks, to the point he had left behind his designs of naval artillery and pistols so he can be engrossed in wheels, pumps and pistons. Sometimes, when no one is looking, he sketches machines from his wildest imagination, drawing small pieces like rotating cogs connected in a circular motion like a planet to its sun, the ensemble-driven by steam. These small pieces turn into big imaginary travel devices. In his mind, they look like a series of closed carriages made of metal, lead by a bigger one from where the fuming and pumping energy comes from and advancing at full speed thanks to strong wheels rolling on tracks. They would link all the cities of his Majesty’s lands so it would only take a few hours to travel instead of days. And, when he feels bolder, he dreams of the sky. He dreams of metallic ships as round as balloons, flying high thanks to steam, and transporting people without any risk of sinking or being struck by lightning.
He nods at his parents, thanking them for the breakfast and retreats inside of the house to finish his latest project in his father’s workshop. He leaps up the stairs, fuming.
Right now, he rarely had the spare time to spend an entire afternoon on drawing. Even when the yellow-green spring grass and early flowers beckoned to him as he sat working on his accounts for his small estate. Even in retirement, Steve had paperwork to do and business to conduct and soon he would have visitors to his estate now that the renovations were complete.
“Because,” Peter said matter-of-factly as he ate his after school snack of peanut butter on apple slices, “Mr. Steve seems lonely and you seem lonely and I want you to have someone like I have MJ and Ned.”
And finally, there is a time when Mr Rogers doesn’t come anymore. Someone new replaced him, more efficient, with no ailments to slow him down. Mr Barnes follows him a few days later. Jarvis cannot tell if it’s a good thing or not, but he notices his master has been much more proactive in his hobbies since the news reached him.
A small pause hangs in the air like an invisible hatchet ready to fall and sever Tony's head from the rest of his body.
Steve went back to the dining room sideboard and found teapot cozy, near the perfect size to cover over the drawer. When he returned Sam, Bucky and Natasha were gathered around the table looking down at the fairy. “He’s asleep now,” Sam said.
To what extent does he crave it, how deeply this need is rooted: Tony is not sure. It’s one thing to recognize you want to be closer to another Omega. It’s another to live with this new information and to decide what to do with it. That’s why he needs to define, as clearly as possible, what happened in the library so he could plan what’s ahead of him. First, he has to run through the many potential answers this problematic situation entails, whether he likes them or not. Tony channels his energy inwards, his thoughts like roads displayed on an imaginary map.
“Petey pie, we talked about secrets, remember? And that’s a big one,” Tony Stark said in a slightly strange tone as he scooped up his son and planted a bunch of kisses all over his face and head.
Sam, Natasha and Bucky had declined to follow Steve into retirement. Sam and Bucky kept a house in the capital and were happy with the occasional work they did for the government. Natasha traveled in her circles, clearly still engaged in the spy life. Steve had extracted a promise that they would visit when the estate renovations were complete.
“Fairies have a lot of magic,” Steve said. “That’s what my ma told me. Sam -- that lovely beta over there has been trying to catch your eye since she arrived.”
His mother nods, her lips set in a grim line. She crosses her arms and rises to stand in front of him, gripping her elbows tightly as if she has to refrain herself to hold him in fear she would crumble under the weight of his admission. Tony thinks he couldn't bear it if she touches him.
“I’m not the alpha for Steve,” Natasha said and Tony wondered if he heard a touch of regret in her voice.
“It's fine. It's fine.” Steve says, raising his hands to placate her. “Come on. Give me a bit of space, I’ll show you.” He adds with an aggravated sigh.
A big thank you to all the people who leave comments, kudos and bookmarks <3 It really touches me <3
Sam walked up to Steve and looked down at the nest. “I’d been taught to leave out sweets and water for them to keep them out of the barn, but I’ve never seen one in person.”
“Okay, buddy, but no one but Mr. Steve, okay? And in the future, ask me first before you decide I need a friend?”
“Yes.” Steve sighs in relief. “I’ll take anything, as long as I won’t need to stay inside the city. I’d feel safer if you could come with me.”
He hated all this right down to every particle of his body. But he owed something to Tony, even if Tony didn’t love him enough to stay.
“It’s craft time,” he called and was answered by sounds of celebration. “Can everyone go get their smocks from their cubbies, please?”
Thank you Swisstae for having cheer-reading me and correcting my mistakes :3 <3 You're always so helpful! Have a nice day folks! I hope you'll enjoy the story as we go deeper into it!
“Captain -- I did not realize the Navy accepted omegas these days. A shame, really -- but maybe that’s the only option for an omega of your size? I have something on offer that might interest you more than a mill.”
He had his breakfast with Tony first and he eagerly set down the tray, expecting Tony to summon him to bring Tony to the table.
So Tony had sworn to himself that he will move on once the holidays are over, working on projects, meeting new people while taking care of the ones he already has by his side. Steve can keep scowling at him like he always does, his horrible soulmark can burn as much as it wants, he won't give a shit about either of these two things anymore!
At the moment, Steve was waiting for all the students to be ready to finish washing up from lunch so they could start arts and crafts time. They were going to be making hats for themselves that day, since they had just read Caps for Sale that morning and Steve could not wait to see what his class came up with. He was already sure that MJ would want something that could sit on top of her hair and not have to contain it, but he also knew it wouldn’t be a tiara. Nebula - he had so many questions for her parents about that name - would make a space helmet, Harley would make a hard hat, but he didn’t know what Peter would create.
“Daddy,” Peter said matter-of-factly as he got up and put his backpack on to run to the man in question.
The afternoon shadows grew long and Steve knew he had to return to the house for dinner. As he packed up his basket, he felt like he was being watched. His head snapped up as he surveyed his surroundings. It was an old feeling back from when he was in the Navy -- knowing when he was being watched. His first thought was that it was a fox or possibly a hawk.
