Percy smirked at him. ”Yeah ok deal. But seriously I do have to get home. My moms making blue pancakes for breakfast tomorrow so there is no way I'm getting myself in trouble tonight. We'll talk after school. Somewhere private got it?”
Peter just raised an eyebrow and Percy sighed.”Listen, Percy, I trust you so if you tell me what's going on here I'll explain well” he gestures at his suit.
“Hm?,” Peter said trying to focus on securely getting his webbing around each branch once they moved to a more forested area, “Wait why can you fly on him I thought you couldn’t be in the air because of the Zues Poseidon thing.”
Thanos attempts to say something else as a giant piece of rock hurls in from the sky towards the purple entity, he is cut off as it slams him into the group.
He shrugged, ”I'm just saying Thor can hear that, I don't have much experience with Norse gods besides Wisegirls cousin but I'm sure there are some that would smited you for that.”
Peter snorted but scraped some of his meal I to the fire sending a prayer to Poseidon hoping he wouldn’t be smites for sitting at his table then sitting back down next to Percy. Percy grinned at him the shook his glass with a strange blue liquid in it. Peter cocked an eyebrow, ”Are you drinking some radioactive concoction?”
Peter didn't respond, he was too surprised by the fact that he was dry. Percy rolled his eyes and they moved ashore and sat on the sand, ”You never fail to surprise me, Percy Jackson, ” Peter said.
Percy and Peter give Camp Half-Blood a Thanos debriefing. And afterwards Peter and Annabeth have a heart to heart.
There was a strange compression in Percy’s chest, his breathing was slow and his chest was tight. There was an unexplained anxiety rushing through his veins, ”What are you saying?”
Peter though as he walked towards Mr.Stark’s kitchen before going back to drag his mentor with him. Peter took the sprayer out of the sink and used it to create a mist. Tony was beginning to think the kid had gone mad.
The older man sighed and hit play on the screen. Peter found himself watching a clip of Percy and him fighting the chimera. Tony looked away when Percy had finished the monster off sighing deeply, ”Kid what you did there was illegal. You're going to have to turn your friend in, you had no reason go hurt that women.”
Percy concentrated as much command ADHD demigod could as Peter was grabbing his shoulders sobbing and yelling at him for leaving but was able to slowly separate the out the water from the blood that'd left his body. He let it slowly enter where he was stabbed and felt a familiar tingle.
Tony eventually allowed Percy to join him. He figured they didn’t have time to argue about how stupid of a decision this was because the ship seemed to be preparing to fly back into space. Tony called for another one of his Iron Man suits so he they wouldn’t need to worry about Percy dying from the lack of oxygen in the air. That would not be ideal. He may be able to breath underwater but the thin atmosphere- and the lack of oxygen at all in space was a completly different story. Percy Jackson never thought he’d be in an Ironman suit. Sure, he wasn’t as mesmerized with them as Peter was but he did respect them. They did good, and hey what teenager didn’t want to play dress up for a day every once and a while. He and Mr.Stark began to fly after the ship. Percy nearly missed a bird or two but with the help of FRIDAY and a little input from Stark he managed to sneak onto the ship right before it left the thermosphere. He may have tripped and fell on his face when he landed but that is something no one but he and Mr.Stark needed to know.
”WELL! That was fun! Let's do that again sometime but for now I believe food was mentioned....ok maybe I was the one who mentioned food but Stark is a billionaire or something surely he can spare 10 bucks give or take for a pizza.”
The real fight had just begun.  Strange had sent his cape to wrap along the gauntlet, hoping it’d prevent him from closing his hand then started making portals for the Spider-Peter whatever to attack from the air, he seemed to enjoy them cause each time he came out, he shouted some variation on ‘MAGIC’
Nico glanced at it, then warily shook it, ” Nice to meet you uh Peter by the way. So what's going on?”
Percy and Peter head to Camp Jupiter to give them more information on Thanos in person so it is easier to have cooperation between the two camps.
Peter felt something drop in his stomach. Mr.Stark sounded mad. REALLY mad but Peter had no idea what he had done to warrant this tone of voice, ”Sure...uhhh like on the phone or-”
After introductions Percy stood up on the nearest bench and shouted something in what Peter  could only guess was Greek. Whatever it was it got their attention.
“I’m a Hufflepuff yeah, we need to watch the movies together. Harry Potter weekend when we get home?”
Hey all! I appreciate you guys taking the time to give this a read! Love you for it, really! Let me know how you are liking this and I was wondering if you would like to see Peter/Percy? I'm considering it but Percabeth still is a possibility. I plan on updating again tomorrow! Have a lovely day.
Things were going well until Quill flew over, “I thought you'd be harder to catch. For the record, this was my plan. Not so strong now, huh? Where is Gamora?”
At that Percy rolled his eyes, ”So I have to make sure I don't piss off the Gods all while making sure I don't piss off the impulsive guy with a militarized suit?”
”Percy, I'll be ok..I'm happy that even if I don't get this opportunity you do. Become an Avenger, ” Peter said offering him a little smile.
While Stark and Strange were bickering about whether or not they countinue on course to Titan and face Thanos head on. Percy and Peter just watched flabbergasted, thinking it best to not chime in. Percy gingerly grabbed Peter’s hand which made the other boys cheeks heat up so much so that a light pink hue appeared. Peter was glad it was dark so that no one could see it. It seemed that Tony had won the little debate and Percy was almost positive it was because they had no idea to steer the ship but whatever the reasoning was they got their answer when they all panicked as they attempted to land smoothly.
“Hi, I’m Hazel,” she said softly, “ I know these things are hard to get used to. They can be overwhelming but don’t worry, you’ll be ok.”
All of a sudden Peter was interrogating Percy about Annabeth’s Norse cousin. He couldn’t believe all of these myths were real what the actual hell is wrong with Earth. How are they still keeping this a secret? They started getting in a debate wondering if the Norse demigods and the people living in Valhalla had ever connected the dots between the Avengers, Loki’s invasion and the whole Asgard space thing. Starlord seemed mildly pissed off that Thor was getting praise he mumbled something about gods not being that powerful.
Thanos was reminiscing like every Disney movie villain, “ Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, and not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.”
By this time they were out of the school walking towards the nearest park. Percy reached into his backpack as they sat down and pulled out what appeared to be blue cookies, well, smashed blue cookies anyway. Percy gave him a somewhat embarrassed smile. ”I tried” he bit into one before offering the bag to the other teen.
Thanos pointed forward, far past where Percy was laying, towards two familiar figures. The demigod could hardly make it out do to the dusty air and distance, but he soon realized it was Peter and Tony. They were talking, simply talking, glancing at the Thanos and Percy and then back towards each other in hushed whispers. Or maybe not whispers, he was too far to tell.
Strange smirked and allowed sarcasm to drip heavily into his voice,”Congratulations. You're a prophet,”
Percy grabbed his hand to keep him from walking away, and pulled Peter into a kiss. Percy's lips were rough, chapped and tasted of the sea, while Peter’s were soft, smooth, and were sweet like cinnamon. Eventually, Peter pulled away, furiously blushing and apologizing taking the blame immediately before Percy kissed him again this time quicker and softer to silence him which again took Peter by surprise, ” Look, Peter, I don't know what I am but I know I like you. And I know I've wanted to do that since we've met.”
With a smirk on the grapes face he moved, accepting the stone than infinity gaunlet and all, within seconds he’d vanished before anyone could move.
Peter and Annabeth slowly made their way to the camp fire. Every once and a while they would stop and Peter would listen to Annabeth explain the history, meaning and purpose of a particular statue or cabin or tree every time they passes something hung she deemed important. And of course Peter didn’t mind at all. He was playing catch up on this whole gods thing anyway. Any extra information was good. Nonetheless, Peter decided he really liked Annabeth, she was intelligent, strong, and passionate.
Percy took a deep breath and began, ”Look. I didn't want to be a half-blood. Most of the time, it gets you killed in painful nasty ways. I only entered this world a few years ago and it all began with my uncle accusing me of stealing his master bolt...”
So he allowed her to drag him through the laughing crowd, over towards Percy and his friends. Peter felt completely out of place there. He knew it wasn’t his fault but he couldn’t help but feel like he was intruding on a moment he wasn’t supposed to be a part of. But then one of the girls Percy was talking to turned around and smiled at him. It made him feel warm throughout, he couldn’t help but stare at her golden eyes and curly dark hair. She gave of an aura of comfort and stepped aside to make more room for Peter.
Tony Stark meets an interesting angsty teen, Stephen Strange wants to be done with this shit and Bruce Banner just needs a hug.
“I’m your worst nightmare,” Nico answered darkly, at Tony’s uncomfortable expression the three teens laughed, “I’m sorry I had to do that, but I’m Nico.”
Steve Rogers seemed to appear put of nowhere. He walked towards the three and gave Tony a kiss on the cheek before looking over Percy, ”Uh Tones...this is a kid.”
Tony didn’t say anything, scrunching himself up and holding himself like he would to fall apart if he didn’t.
“Stop fighting, slut,” Hammer purred, using one hand to hold both of Tony’s wrists away from his body as the other hand stroked Tony’s ass, “I’m going to enjoy this.”
Steve decided to remedy this. It wasn’t his place. He was not Tony’s alpha. But he couldn’t stand watching the man of his heart stay unhappy if he could change things.
Steve had laughed at that, knowing this would be the last time he’d see Sharon as she walked out of the car.
“Yeah, sure,” Steve said dumbly, still looking at Tony rather than typing up the order. He didn’t even notice Bucky chuckling into his hand.
The dom, surrounded by his possy, a larger group than the one surrounding Tony, laughed, “if you want to talk, Rogers, talk. I have nothing to say to you.”
“If I were to believe you,” Steve said, “which for the record, I don’t. Who are you fellas? And why is one of you the size of a bug and the other a robot?”
“When I was young… I had a best friend. He was also kidnapped… by hydra,” Steve said, brows furling with the memory.
“We should give him a change of clothes. We can’t let him walk outside with a huge American star,” the robot- Iron man grouched, “Jan, can you get him something?”
Tony didn’t have the money to call for a babysitter, but Peter has shown time and time again that he was more than able to take care of himself when Tony was in a pinch so Tony was used to leaving his son alone.
Tony didn’t see Rogers for the rest of the day. That night he went to bed and he still didn’t see him. He laid on the bed, eyes wide open, waiting. Close to midnight- when the cell bars usually closed- they stayed open. It was fucking weird.
The dom sighed, walking towards the small sink and washing his face before pissing into the side toilet as Tony stood, wearily staring. The dom’s cock, though flaccid, was huge. Bigger than Obi’s and that had done a lot of damage. Tony swallowed quietly.
“I understand,” the man said, bored, “I’ll let Maria know. You’ll be given to a dom who’ll force his will on you.”
“Would you, god of sea and sky, take this son of the earth to be your lawfully wedded husband for all to see?” The gruff older voice asked.
Tony held the phone in one hand and the receipt in the other. He had apologized to Sasha and canceled on her, knowing that he would not be able to stop thinking about one particular man. The man he wanted to call when he got home. He weighed the pros and cons of calling Captain America.
Tony wanted to say Steve was wrong. How could Steve say that when his own father couldn’t see the potential in him?
He opened the car door but the neighbor was coming over. Tony blanked out for a second, his neighbors knew to leave him alone, but never this guy. He was always friendly, always wanting to chat.
Miraculously, the robot was more human than the actual humans in the room. Steve burst out laughing despite himself. The other people in the room grinned tentatively.
Steve would just call him and talk about anything and everything. The changes Steve observed about the world when he drove across America, the cuisine, the cultures that surrounded him, and Tony would listen. Sometimes he’d add in his two cents when Steve asked a question about how something worked, but most of the time, he’d just listen.
Mr.Stark rolled his eyes, ”Kid, I like you but don't play dumb with me. I was watching baby monitor protocol to make sure it was functioning properly and it's obviously a good thing I checked it out. What on Earth were you thinking!”
And just like that a mop of black hair and sea green eyes appeared, ”Oh Peter! Hi! Can I help you with something, ” he cocked an eyebrow when he saw Tony gaping in the background, ”Is there something I need to know?”
By this time they were out of the school walking towards the nearest park. Percy reached into his backpack as they sat down and pulled out what appeared to be blue cookies, well smashed blue cookies anyway. Percy gave him a somewhat embarrassed smile. ”I tried” he bite into one before offering the bag to the other teen.
Stark looked at the man, like he didn’t really want to know the answer but asked anyway, “How many did we win?”
Stark charged up his gun when he saw the arm around Peters neck tighten, “ You kill my guy I blast him.”
Steve stuck out his hand and the sheid flew into it, ” This really doesn't seem like a fair fight do you want like a-”
Peter smiled a sort of sad but hopeful grin and the two sat quietly together for a while. Peter’s breaths eventually leveled out, making a constant light
Thanos looked down in mild shock and kicked Percy down in an instant, quickly disarming him. Peter was hurled with great force into a nearby rock pile and the weapon that had saved Percy’s life time and time again was thrust into his abdomen.
Peter vaguely noticed shrieks from those surrounding him and saw dust drift past the corner of his eye but he didn't care.
They were back in Avengers tower- no the compound upstate. They were lounging in pajamas on Tony Stark’s couch in front of a large flatscreen, with the lights fairly dimmed. Percy and Peter were cuddled up next to each other, Peter was laughing at whatever joke had just been told and grabbed a handful of popcorn, throwing a few pieces playfully at his boyfriend before giving him a small kiss on the cheek and turning back to the movie. Harry Potter. They were finally having their marathon. His mom and Paul were there, so was a little dark haired baby. Estelle. Peter’s Aunt May was there too, along with Tony and Pepper, both looking years younger. Stress-free. Even Annabeth was there so was Grover, Nico, along with Peter’s best friends Ned and MJ, they were in the corner developing deep on Reddit for the latest theories. Percy wondered if they would actually be friends in real life. Everything was happy, it was calm, it was perfect.
“Horses are my dads domain so Pegasus’ qualify so no blasting me out of the sky allowed with this one,” Percy chuckled in response.
Peter looked over at the green-eyed boy and smiled softly, ”I don't know. It's complicated...I guess we just-”
Thanos gives him a look over, “You have my respect, Stark. When I'm done, half of humanity will still be alive...I hope they remember you,”
In the middle of the trios conversation Peter got a panicked call from Tony rambling about Hulk returning and Asgard being destroyed. That was not good. Nico offered to take them to New York.
Percy walked up next to Peter and watched him observe the fountain and mumbled something under his breath that sounded a bit like, ” So are you, ”
Peter shushed Percy and pet his head, whispering meaningless reassurnece quickly the half blood quickly realized the encouragement was more to keep himself calm rather than to help Percy. Not that he blamed him, he had done that time after time especially in Tartarus with...
Percy seemed a bit uneasy with his role. He was told to head to Thanos’ main ship. Do a perimeter check, at least. He was in charge of figuring out what was where, how many aliens were on it, and if he had the chance to infiltrate, he was to do so. Peter wasn’t really fond of that, he fought Strange on it for at least 10 minutes, listing Percy’s attributes, why he’s useful in battle. But Strange simply gave him a grim look and said, “I’m aware of his power, but he’s the only one that can handle the ship on his own,”
Bucky’s face went from surprise to understanding as Tony stood up, saying hoarsely, “no. It was nothing. Is my shift up?”
Tony tried to punch in his employee numbers and leave as quickly as possible but Bucky wasn’t letting him up. He grabbed Tony tightly by the arm.
The dom leaned down to kiss him. Tony froze in place, opening his mouth mechanically to let the foreign dom explore with tongue. Tony instinctively turned away even as the dom pulled him into those strong arms. The dom pulled both of them back until they fell onto bed. Tony did nothing but let him.
“Call me when you find anything out about Ransom,” Tony said quietly, not even looking in Steve’s direction.
Tony stayed in their cell, hiding behind the beds and curled in on himself. He wasn’t always this skittish. He used to be loud-mouthed and brash, a sub the media dubbed the ‘wild child.’ Obi put an end to all of that. He put an end to a lot of things.
Tony shut his mouth. It was what every manager told him when he applied. ‘Why did you apply here?’ The truth was he was banned from the better job applications he applied to and the rest… well, the explanation was simple. He was blacklisted by his very own father. But he couldn’t tell some poor schmuck that.
“Does he do that? Watch papa all the time?” Bucky asked with a false cheer, a sinking feeling pervading inside him.
“I- I,” Tony chewed his lower lip. He already began terribly, but he pushed forward, shoving the papers on the table, “I want to go to college.”
“Yeah,” the man said lazily, wrapping his strong arms behind his head, “pretty little sub like you?” He smiled and it looked nasty, “you’ll be eaten alive.”
“How would you like me?” Tony asked, eyes dull and lifeless like the light it once held was sucked out.
“Ransom doesn’t like it when I tinker at home. He turned my old lab into a nursery. I’m supposed to do the home chores. I mean, I’m sure there’s something to vacuum…” Tony said standing up.
“People talk to me so they can get on my brother’s good side, well, here I’m telling you that won’t work!” Tony shouted.
He tried to sneak away but he stepped onto a creaky piece of floorboard, notifying Tony to his presence.
“Hmm,” the dom rumbled, sounding disapproving against Tony’s inaction. Obadiah hated it when Tony didn’t react in anyway during sex. Tony resigned himself for a session of pain, trying to send his brain into any happy memories. His favorites that replayed in his mind so often that they were distorted and warped with his memories of brutal beatings and pain.
“You did nothing wrong, my love,” Steve said quietly, quickly realizing the problem. Tony had finished before Steve had and… that was a horrible offense in Tony’s eyes.
He shook his head. He could meet his childhood hero if he wanted to. No one could stop him, especially not Greg.
“It’s it your eyes, the way you look at him,” Sharon’s expression was kind, “it’s alright, Steve. I always knew you weren’t really invested in our relationship. But it isn’t healthy to pine for someone you can’t have. You have to move on sometime.”
After another failed interview, Tony almost resigned himself to take a black market job just to make ends meet. He was already living in squalor, the shittiest apartment he could afford. It could barely be called a studio, more like a closet. He didn’t know what he would do if he wasn’t able to afford even that.
“Apologies, Rogers,” Gregory’s smile turned sharp, “but Tony is my brother and I cannot trust you with him.”
“That’s not protection I’m seeing. Do you even meet people that he doesn’t approve of first?” Steve asked.
“Mr. Rogers,” the red and gold robot said in a distinctly calm tone, “you are welcome to leave. Just be aware that just beyond these walls is several metric tons of icy waters from the Pacific Ocean. If you were to break out now, you might survive and swim to shore or you might become another frozen capsicle in the deep once again.”
“I suppose,” Tony’s smile was plastered on his face. He knew he’d probably not encounter the hottie again.
“What, I can’t listen to my husband’s laughter before I leave for an uncertain amount of time for war?” Ransom laughed.
Steve felt his heart sink in his chest, but he still managed to smile and nod before going into the van and driving off. When he was a sufficient distance away, he parked in a remote area in the suburbs and sobbed till he couldn’t shed any more tears.
“It’s almost like you care about Anthony Stark, wait, you do, you’re his bodyguard,” Clint scoffed darkly and sardonically.
“That’s not true and you know it,” Steve frowned, “if that were true, he wouldn’t be leaving for afghanistan for three months and leaving you alone here.”
“I’m fine, Steve,” Tony said, staring into Steve with glazed dark eyes, “I- I never thought I could be happy.”
“I love you too, brother,” Greg’s easy smile was back as he stood up, “anyway, I’ve come to tell you I set you up on a date with that Sasha girl. Don’t miss it. It’ll break her heart.”
Tony walked forward, like a man possessed, stepping over Hammer’s body to wrap his arms around his dom and kissing Rogers with a passion he never thought he had.
Tony did not show any emotion as his love life was speculated in the open in front of him. He looked down at his food tray, his hands shaking under the table.
Steve pulled Tony into a bone crushing hug and the dam broke. Tony sobbed, wrapping his arms around Steve like a vice, never wanting to let go. Romanoff’s sudden appearance had triggered a harsh memory of when he had been kidnapped. He sobbed until he had no more tears left to give. All his mistakes- his and Greg’s but it was mostly his- caught up to him.
“Aw, darling,” Steve drawled in thick Brooklyn, reaching out to wipe the tears from Tony’s eyes, “it couldn’t be your fault. You shouldn’t be carrying this weight. You’re just an ordinary civilian.”
“Unless you have a secret you’re keeping from us?” Steve poked the girl’s side. The girl giggled as Steve began to tickle her.
“He began escalating. Bringing people to watch me, discipline me whenever I made a slight mistake. I had no freedom. I had no friends. I had no one,” Tony’s tone went dull, “I had no one but Obi. He played both good cop and bad cop. Being remorseful when he ‘had’ to punish me. Bringing others- business men and women- to bruise me up and make me look pretty. There was one man…” Tony shook, eyes growing wide, sad, and lost, “who hurt me more than Obi did. He was an important man with many subs under him. But he wanted me. He wanted- he wanted me to be his. Obi would give me to him for days, weeks and he’d… he’d hurt me… no scars. He didn’t want to destroy
As he got ready for his first day, he had to dig into his clothes pile to find a suitable shirt and pants to go to work.
Howard slammed a fist into Tony’s face. He fell to the floor like a sack of potatoes. To stop himself from sobbing, Tony bit his tongue so hard he could taste blood.
“Alright, children, settle down,” Reed sighed, rolling his eyes like this was a common argument for the two to have.
Steve stopped talking to Bucky, hibernating in his new apartment. The apartment was a piece of shit, but it was all Steve could afford on such short notice. When he was not working, he was in bed. When he wasn’t in bed, he was watching Tony’s and Ransom’s home from a safe distance. He was telling himself that he was doing this to protect Tony, that it was under Ransom’s wishes, but he couldn’t quite convince himself. He didn’t know the passage of time. Everything seem to blur, and, though he desperately wanted company, he couldn’t bear the thought of sharing a bed with some stranger, or even someone he knew.
Tony awoke with a jolt. Everything was dark and quiet and he was smothered by strong arms from behind him, arms that did not feel like Obi’s. He tried to slide away from the arms but the person holding him held on tighter, cooing, “it’s alright. I got you.”
“I have your brother on speed dial. Why would I need to use you to get to him,” Steve said in that soft tone.
“-o I said, ‘seriously, Clint? An arrow in the milk carton, again?’” Steve complained, “and he said, ‘I gotta stake my claim.’ The audacity of the man!”
After hours of waiting, after the prison guards changed shifts several times, Rogers went back into the cell and sighed, turning on the water to wash his face.
Steve hung his head. He knew he was in the wrong, that Bucky was right, but he couldn’t help feeling betrayed.
Rogers laughed and it was bright and light, “that’s classified information. If I tell you, I would have to kill you.”
Rhodey immediately rammed into the dark haired alpha and they wrestled a bit on the ground before Rogers stepped in between, “stop! Stop it! Stop, you fucking idiots!”
Tony thought about that disgusting man putting his hands on him and shivered. He hugged his legs to his chest, teeth chattering, “What- what’s in this for you?”
Steve muttered filthy promises into Tony’s ear, “if I had my way- which I do- I would be fucking you on every surface of this prison, the walls, the bathroom, in the showers, on the breakfast tables, in the halls, on the fucking field, midst the flowers were you belong, show everyone you are mine, that your gorgeous ass is all mine and only mine.”
He got there 30 minutes early. It was already busy. The baristas barely had time for him, having to serve the customers their complicated orders. He waited nearly an hour, being greeted once and a while by a barista or a frazzled customer. It was incredibly hectic.
Fuck, he was, maybe he could cancel on Sasha- but it would be incredibly rude to cancel on the same day for a date wouldn’t it? Tony liked Sasha. Not in that way but-
Tony could see his future. After he finishes highschool, he was to marry Obadiah who he was betrothed to since Howard found out he was a worthless omega. He’d have an unhappy marriage, full of pain and misery, forever pregnant with children he would never love. He could see it all now in stark greys and blues and purples. Like the color of his bruises.
Their tongues played lazily, Steve whispering against Tony’s lips, “I’m going to insert another finger.”
At the latest gift, however, Tony put his foot down with a small kind smile, “it is very sweet of you to give me all these gifts, Steve. Very sweet and I’m very grateful. It almost feels like you’re courting me.”
“Tony?” Steve turned to his sub. Tony sat there, back ram rode straight, eyes wide open, glazed, as he stared at a particular spot in the distance.
It was apparently a day where the doms and subs were cycled outside to roam lazily in the sun. Tony was swarmed in a small crowd of people as Rogers stepped out of the crowd, heading towards another dom and his group that was ten times more burly.
Steve just flipped him the bird while continuing to kiss Tony. Tony moaned loudly and obscenely in retaliation and Steve smiled against his lips, knowing exactly what Tony was doing and loving it. Clint just sighed, “goddamn it. This is worse than when Nat and Bucky got together.”
But Tony was happy with Ransom, they had two beautiful children together. Harley and Morgan were precious. Steve was happy to play the cool uncle. He was happy to be Tony’s brother in law.
“No it isn’t!” Steve snarled, eyes flashing angrily, but he stopped his rampage when Tony put a hand on his shoulder.
The blonde guard raised his head and Tony flushed dark with embarrassment. The guy was leering at him, stepping forward to touch him, his chest, brushing against his nipples, his hips, his cock, his ass. Tony chewed his tongue to stop from saying anything. He felt like nothing but a slab of meat.
’ alpha but Steve always thought he was too traditional. He thought Tony had mellowed that part out of him.
Tony remained in the cell, feeling adrift until one the guards- thankfully not Ty- beat the side of the cell bars and said, “get out, it’s shower time.”
Whether he was close to sobbing or laughing hysterically, he wasn’t quite sure, his eyes glazing over, “no!”
After Steve hung up, Tony looked down at his phone and realized that his phone was on no caller ID mode. He shouldn’t show up. This smelled like trouble.
“Howard knew about Steve’s dreams of being an actor,” Tony said almost desperately. Finally letting the demons out after all these years, “he would have destroyed those dreams before they were even realized. It’s better this way.”
That night, when Steve went to drop Sharon off, she turned to him, voice soft and non accusing, “you’re in love with your brother’s husband, aren’t you?”
“No, no,” Tony shoved at Steve but he was useless against that supersoldier strength, “I shouldn’t have told you.”
Once he returned with the food trays, he realized he hadn’t gotten a good meal since the night he was incarcerated. He was fucking starving.
Tony felt… light. Like his head was in the clouds. He felt… good. Safe. He let out a deep moan when Steve curled his fingers deep inside of him, eyes blown, half lidded. Steve kissed him viciously, claiming his mouth. Tony was going wild.
And that was the end of the conversation. Tony was more than a little confused. A puzzle presented itself to him and he loved dissecting puzzles and seeing how things ticked.
He stepped towards, circling around the large complex. It was huge, towering just below the tips of tall pines scattered across the land. The structure looked pristine- Undamaged by the elements like it was built this morning. He furled his brow, which could possibly be the reason for this structure to be made on an island that the locals feared to go near. Perhaps there were people living on the island? People who did not fear those children tales that the locals spoke reverantly about the island?
“Anyways, I have to go to work,” he said, pointingly looking at Steve’s tight grip over Tony’s hand. He was running late already.
It was pathetic how much he loved Tony Stark, but he couldn’t help it. Once Ransom introduced his boyfriend to Steve, he fell hard for the doe eyed, fiery omega.
“It’s Stark not Stane,” Rogers said casually. Tony was almost touched that Rogers remembered. He would be if he wasn’t currently trapped in the dom’s arms.
He stripped down to his underwear and waited to be handed his prison clothes, until the guard told him, “continue.”
“No! No, you are lying! They wouldn’t have won. I stopped-“ Steve snapped, before realization hit him, “you’re not- you’re hydra!”
They even averted their eyes when Tony took off his clothes. Rogers didn’t. He stared and took in his fill, cool blues taking in Tony’s exposed skin greedily. Tony shivered involuntarily, trying to cover his privates discreetly.
He was on his nth girlfriend, bringing her to meet Ransom and Tony, when Tony took him aside, “Steve, I worry about you. When are you going to settle down and start your own family?”
He didn’t even notice the door opening into his room, didn’t even flinch when a rough hand came to touch his face.
Tony quickly put on his orange prison uniform and left the room, feeling the promise running its course through his mind. He had to get out of here. Even if it took sucking someone’s cock to do it. He wasn’t subbing for anyone. Never again.
Tony smiled and, even though his face was blotchy from crying, Steve couldn’t help see how beautiful it was, “thank you, Steve. You’re such a good man. How have you not found someone yet?”
Iron man was quiet for this rant, stoic. Steve glanced over at the man in metal armor, “then how do you know so much about me?”
After some time of spying, sleeping, and working, one night, while he was watching Tony’s house forlornly, having had a bit much to drink- surprisingly, Tony was the first to approach. Tony walked over in the dead of night, dressed in a light cardigan, pajama pants, and fluffy slippers, holding his head high. He looked radiant and Steve shied away when Tony spotted him.
Tony looked at him meaningfully, “you know. I used to be a playboy before I met Ransom. I thought I’d never settle down and have a family. I thought I was too broken for that. But Ransom taught me differently. I hope you find someone who can teach you that too, because you aren’t the playboy type. I know you, Steve. You yearn for a family just like I had.”
What happened next happened so fast that Tony didn’t quite see it. One second Hammer was trapping Tony’s body between the dom and the tiled wall, the next second the dom was faced down on the floor, unconscious.
It was a slow day at the coffee shop. Steve was at one of the tables, wiping it, when his best bud, Bucky Barnes announced his presence loudly, followed by his girlfriend Natasha. They were still in the honeymoon phase, having broken up and come back together multiple times. Steffens rolled his eyes at their entrance, “hello, welcome to coffee bean, can I get your order?”
He had to strain to get up, but time heals all wounds as they said. His limp had gotten marginally better at least and he could faux walk without it being too painful. Not that anyone noticed these days, with the state of the world being what it was.
“Tony…” Steve said softly, “You were the first person who genuinely cared enough about me to ask if I was ok. That makes you a somebody in my eyes.”
“It’s necessary,” the guard explained through the buzzing in Tony’s ears, “so the sub nor the dom drop. Don’t worry, we give fresh sheets every-“
“Steve,” Tony said hoarsely, standing up to open the door, “oh, gosh, I’m so sorry, you must think of me as a terrible parent.”
“Hey Aiden, I’m taking my lunch break!” Steve called back, grabbing the danish, ignoring Bucky, before leaving the store after Tony.
That was three days ago. Tony thought to himself, grumbling as he waited at the coffee shop. He had two coffees already ready partially because he was nervous, partially because he didn’t know what to do with the two hours he was at the coffee shop.
Tears ran down his face and he curled on himself, weeping. When highschool was up, his life was over. Over and done. He wept for a life he could not control. For the unfairness of life. Once all the tears ran its course, he laid there feeling helpless. Helpless and alone.
That’s when the kids returned. It was easier to pretend everything was alright with Morgan and Harley around. Tony didn’t bring their argument up as well, happy to bask in his children’s glory, but Steve could tell that even now, Tony wasn’t happy. Not completely happy anyway.
Tony closed his eyes but he couldn’t sleep, no matter how much his body screamed for relaxation, having someone’s arms around him set off all his alarms. He stayed awake, listening to his own rabbit heart beat. The dom wasn’t doing anything to him now, but it didn’t mean he’ll
“Later, Tony,” Steve tried, but Tony wasn’t having it. In fact, his lover seemed inconsolable, even more fearful when Steve tried to convince him that it wasn’t going to happen. That he wasn’t going to punish him. Compliments didn’t even seem to help.
When there was no response, Tony leaned over the bundle of blankets and shook his son gently awake, “Peter, wake up, it’s time for school.”
Tony went to the interview in a shirt and slacks. It was the nicest thing he owned after his dad kicked him out of the house and out of the will. It was the only thing he always wore at interviews. He put on a charming facade, hoping that this time, a manager would hire him.
“I do,” Tony gasped, wrapping his arms around Steve’s bare shoulders and dragging Steve back into a harsh kiss.
Tony didn’t know what he wanted. He wanted- just just wanted to stay there in Steve’s arms and hide from the world, but he knew he couldn’t. He separated from Steve, looking up at him with wide sad doe eyes, “I.. I was kidnapped…”
“Fuck you, Greg,” Tony snarled. It was half hearted and they both knew it. Greg did everything he could for Tony but he still couldn’t help resent his brother.
Then, when there was a slowing down of traffic, his manager and boss, according to her name tag her name was Sharon, came to him with a smile, “oh! You’re Tony.”
“It’s just going to be three months, sweetie, I’ll be back in no time,” Ransom said in that calming tone of voice Tony didn’t like.
It confused Tony to no end. Rogers was all swagger, he walked through the prison like he owned the place. But he was a prisoner, just like Tony was. What made him so different?
Tony began taking off his clothes at a rapid pace, Steve had to subdue him physically to get him to stop, “Tony! Tony-“
“And while you’re at it, get yours too, I’m starving,” Rogers said, showing his back to Tony. And that was the end of the conversation.
The dom took the empty trays and left. When he returned he curled around Tony, spooning him. It was nice, having a warm body wrapped around his cold clammy one.
“Yeah but you need to choose someone who isn’t…” Greg wrinkled his face, “male. Someone who can help you continue the family line.”
his father had snarled at him. Tony was grateful that Peter was not in the room when Howard said it,
I changed the perp of Tony’s sexual harrassment from random Arron dude to Hammer. It just doesn’t make sense as Arron so there’s that. That’s the only retcon I made. Other than that, enjoy the new chapter.
“Who was that?” Steve asked after the third drink. He barely felt it but Greg looked like he was drunk from just the sip.
Steve gave Tony exactly what he wanted, not holding back anymore, he slid in and out, cock slapping against Tony’s ass making loud obscene sounds. The next door doms were not going to be able to sleep tonight. Pity, Steve didn’t care.
“Good,” Steve kissed him, then, slowly, excruciatingly slowly, he pushed all the way in, until his cock pushed against Tony’s prostate, and Tony felt full, head high in the clouds.
Tony kissed Steve, slow and languid. The alpha peeled away his own clothes, shirt and pants, and then, more carefully, Tony’s. He treated Tony delicately, like he would break if Steve pushed too hard. Tony whimpered softly against Steve’s lips when his underwear was peeled away.
“You know why, Tony,” Greg grinned but it didn’t reach his eyes, “we aren’t children anymore. You have to grow out of your… gay phase sometime.”
JARVIS was something Tony hid from his brother. He hid a lot of things from Greg and though it pained him to do it, he did it for the best. Like his project on sustainable energy or his more problematic and explosive weapon archetypes. Also, the more complex versions of Iron man. It was better if Greg didn’t know.
Steve kissed Tony, squeezing his shoulders, brushing against Tony’s nipples, his waist, and finally his hips, “tell me if it gets too much. Are you familiar with the stop light system?”
“I’m not. I’m worried about you. You can’t live like this forever,” Steve walked over to the window, “Greg knows this… it’s why he set you up on that date before right?”
“Why didn’t you apply to NASA?” Bucky asked, “you’re smart. Heck, you got into MIT in your sophomore year, which you would have gone if you didn’t get together with Stevie. What gives?”
“I… uh, lost people too, so I get it, but probably not in the way you do I mean-“ Tony continued awkwardly. It didn’t seem to fill any of that silence even as Tony rambled on about loss.
“Don’t entertain the silly omega’s ideas,” Howard scoffed, “an omega is born for one thing and one thing only. Fucking.”
“Hey!” Tony squeaked when Ransom began tickling his waist, “hey! Don’t- haha! That’s- hahaha! Fucking cheating- stop! Stop!”
He was about to react when Natasha- a sub- smacked Bucky on the head. It shocked him enough for indecision to reign.
“Would you, son of the earth, take the god of sea and sky to be your lawfully wedded husband for all to see?” A gruff older voice asked.
, “please, he’s my only son,” his voice broke on that sentence, “He’s my baby boy, he’s- he’s the only good thing in my life. I don’t know what I would do if-“ he choked at the thought, “Please… please, help me find him.”
The arms unraveled from around them as Tony quickly tumbled out of the bed to the floor, grasping at his chest.
At that, some of the old Tony pulled through, staring at Rogers like he was crazed, “you’re a strange one.”
“Please,” his voice cut off. He was shaking so hard a stray breeze could keel him over, but a hand on his shoulder reminded him that he needed to be strong. For Peter. He would be strong, “If someone, anyone has any information on the…” he couldn’t say the goddamn word.
“I don’t know! I fought my way into this goddamn playhouse and this is what happens! Ugh! I’m always the supporting role! The side character! The goddamn love interest! I just want to be the main character! Just this once…” Tony laid down on the grass, “is that too much to ask?”
“Full of tricks aren't we little wizard,” Thanos smirks as he reaches for the stone in Strange's’ necklace.
Now Peter had heard about Pegasus before in fairy tales and myths but not once did he ever expect to see one. And he certainly never even in his wildest dreams did he expect to to see a Pegasus fly onto one of Mr.Starks balconies nor did he even imagine  think he’d be swinging alongside the son of a sea god as he flies across Manhattan’s muggy sky.
Flash decides to be a jerk to Peter. Percy swoops in and saves the day. Both of them are trying to figure out what is going on with the other.
Percy was standing next to him, hands in his sweatpants pockets, rocking back and forth on his heels, a tiny smile visible with his tousled hair, “My friend Nico...I believe I mentioned him...well he was a little too powerful so I had to break it to prevent anything else from happening,”
Peter was about to answer when Percy lurched forward, eyes gold, ”Something is coming, ” he rasped before promptly passing out.
Strange, clever as always prepared a portal. Peter hopped in and while Percy’s hand gripped Thanos’. A web intertwined them both. And Percy’s free hand lunged at the gauntleted hand with the sword. Blood seeped down the golden bronze metal.
Tony attempts to get the tea on Peter and Percy’e relationship, Peter is in a constant state of worry, and Steve...Steve is trying his best.
As Thanos approached he would’ve sworn   Stark had moved. Something had happened, it was brief and subtle, but different.
Strange was never a fan of large groups, nor did he find himself time to keep up with what’s considered iconic or funny nowadays. He did value the importance of the outside world but it was almost impossible to balance it all, once he deemed that sort of thing more unimportant it was a bit easier to balance it all. Only a bit, you never realize how much work it is to keep reality from crashing down on people. So while the group he had gotten stuck with was arguing about frivolous pop culture and the adults in the group seemed to be growingly confused while the two teens hollered uncontrollably, Strange took the opportunity to find a moment of solitude. Hoping that’d he’d be able to meditate on the future,an alternate timeline, something to see what plan,if any, would actually work. Was there actually anyway for them to make it out of this alive? Could the universe survive?
“I don’t know!” Bucky threw his arms up before letting them fall to his side. “The machine, it just beeped, but he’s still not moving-“
“Pete had an errand to run, and Michelle looked exhausted so I sent her to have a nap after she fed her.”
Tony just smiled and pulled Steve in for a kiss, soft and gentle. “I absolutely know. I love you too.”
“Thanks Clint,” Steve told him as he exited the room. “Do you mind staying with Tony? I’ll go greet our visitors and try and answer Loki’s questions before he gets too close to Tony’s earshot.”
!” Steve pouted. He sat himself up and tried to ignore Tony's concerned yet amused face. “You’re a freaking walking, talking robot. He loves that shit! Way cooler than a guy who can throw a frisbee around.”
After dinner, Steve paid the bill, Tony left the tip, and they were out the door back to Steve’s bike. It was time to end the night in the park.
Peter shook his head on a laugh and Tony managed to extricate himself from Steve’s grip, stealing another cube of mozzarella for good measure. The whole scene was incredibly domestic in a cliché sort of way. Peter wasn’t exactly wrong – they didn’t often go all out with dinners, even if they did insist on having dinner together as a family every night they could. As non-traditional as they could appear to be, their family was close-knit and did truly love spending time together, something both Steve and Tony worried about as Peter grew up. But he still enjoyed spending time with his parents, and his extensive list of honorary aunts and uncles equally. Friday night dinners usually revolved around take-out, so Peter’s question wasn’t completely off-base.
Bucky held out his hand to help Steve up. “For a second? I’ve knocked you out 6 times already and you’ve barely seemed to care. You usually thrive on kicking my ass.”
he thought pulling Riptide out of his pocket. He threw down his backpack and began charging at the irritating beast. He was able to stab it in the leg before  flames erupted from it's mouth. Percy quickly called on water to wash out the beast when he saw a web fly down from above. Then another. Before a masked figure swung down from a building near him and began wrapping up the pesky chimera. Sure, he knew about Spiderman from YouTube, even though he didn't have a phone you couldn't really go anywhere in New York without hearing his name. Spiderman was Queens’ pride and joy, but still it was a bit shocking to see the figurehead wrapping up one of his enemies. Percy sort of figured Spiderman was a more friendly neighborhood type of guy but apparently he minored in Greek monsters too, or at least he does now. Percy quickly shook himself out of his shock before using the situation to his advantage and finishing the beast, causing gold dust of scatter everywhere. Percy turned back to the formerly masked figure to give him his thanks hoping he wouldn't be asked to many questions before he felt a lump form in his throat. Standing in front of him clutching the aforementioned spiderman mask was the incredulous face of Peter Parker himself. ”Percy, is...is that you?” he asked.
Bucky was doing all this with the speed and experience of a seasoned barista, but Tony flopped around. He dropped a huge jug of strawberry juice which made his and all the other barista’s shoes sticky for
“After Stane’s death, the mandarin took the opportunity to corner the weapons market. He bought out the crashing and burning Stark Industries and took over the weapon’s game. All in a matter of months,” Natasha said.
“Stark doesn’t even go into that room from what I see,” Iron man said, miffed, “besides, he’s not going to notice some things missing here or there.”
Tony felt his body collapsing on itself. He leaned back until his back hit the wall of the cell, arms wrapped around his chest, trying to make himself as small as possible as he rasped out, “I- I can’t-“
Tony looked down at his prison assigned shoes. All his life, he was under the control of others. It wasn’t fair. He stood up and followed a bored Rogers, keeping a weary eyes on the other doms and subs. Surprisingly, none of the other doms looked at him or leered at him. Even Tiberius the guard seemed to be looking at his nails rather than Tony. It was strange.
On the one hand, Steve Rogers was a hero. He was Tony’s childhood dream, a poster Tony would stare at, hoping that he would come down and save Tony from Howard and the shitty life he was given. Steve was his first wet dream, hoping someone would hold him while he cried when he was bullied for being too young, too smart, too stupid, too naive. Steve was his inspiration, when he was trapped in the cave with a car battery attached to his heart.
“I’m brilliant,” Tony spat out like it was a curse, “in ways that my father or Greg never was. But…”
Tony nodded, his well of hope flooded by grief for another friendship lost and acceptance. There was no reasoning with
Tony was almost used to this new normal. Where things weren’t expected of him and he was allowed to go as he pleased, do as he pleased. After that demonstration, the other doms in the prison were almost afraid of him, going out of their way to avoid him or let him pass. How unexpected that he’d find more freedom in prison than in the real world at large.
“What do you mean? It’s not the weekend, we don’t go outside unless it’s the weekend,” Tony said softly.
“I don’t believe that,” the chatty blonde sub said, “they say the Stanes had a happy marriage. Everyone knows that.”
“Yeah…” Tony said, “it was… bad… I have shrapnel in my heart. I had to rig a car battery to my heart just to stay alive… they used it against me… Tortured me for information about how things were made… I told them I didn’t know anything but… they wouldn’t listen.”
“Work can wait, this is more important,” Greg said with an easy smile, “If you married a lady maybe you wouldn’t be so lonely. You have the pick of the flock, brother, just leave Ms. Potts for me.”
Steve frowned. This was the first time Greg mentioned having a brother, let alone a twin. And he let his twin get hurt.
While he was scrubbing himself off, a big burly dom came forward and leered at Tony, “hello, gorgeous. Mind scrubbing my back?”
Tony tried to swim towards the ship, but it was no use. The ship sailed at a pace too quick for him to follow. He let the waves drag him back to shore, throwing him on the sandy beach. He curled his knees towards his chest and wept.
“I was trying to find something that would fit our good Captain and you should be thankful that I did at all in this trash heap,” Jan grouched back, handing the clothes to Steve.
He went through the people he met who could be his potential Dom. First- no, he wouldn’t choose Tiberius. Not in a million years. That scum of the earth, the leering bastard, was worse than Obi. Second was this nameless dom he was currently rooming with and third- some unknown new dom who would force Tony- basically another Obadiah…
“You understand why this is so important, Steve. The Mandarin has set his sights on Tony. Now that he owns Stark industries, he wants the man behind the curtain,” Natasha explained.
He was taken into the back room and showed several videos, all of them quite straight forward. They were mostly filler, if anything. Tony knew his way around coffee, he’d drunk the best of the best and this shit wasn’t it. Well, coffee was coffee, even coffee from a famous fast food chain.
The whole group went quiet, all staring at Tony. Tony felt himself shrink. Did he do something wrong?
The bastard Obi probably lorded every mistake over Tony when Tony wasn’t expecting it. That was the only reason for this traumatic response.
Tony blinked. The other doms quickly turned away and ignored Tony as the strange quiet dom took him out of the showers.
“I don’t know what happened. They had such a perfect marriage. Obadiah Stane was such a great dom to his sub. How could this have happened.”
“I have my spiders,” Nat answered obtusely. Steve couldn’t help feeling like this was the most that Natasha had ever spoken to him and if she wanted to keep her secrets, he’d allow her this.
’ came to mind but Tony kept up his brightest false smile and said, “good, good, how can I help you today?”
Tony swallowed down his nervous tension, his fears, his grief as the camera's lights flashed all around him. He hated this. He felt small, vulnerable. He could hear his father’s disapproving voice in his ear, ‘
It was nightfall before anyone entered the cell. People passed by, sure, but no one bothered Tony. Something the sub was not used to. Having privacy.
Tony paused. He never talked about what Obadiah did to him to anyone. No one cared. But, from the look in Steve’s cool blue eyes, he knew that Steve cared in a way no one else had. Maybe that’s what made him spill.
“I killed him,” Tony answered, hugging himself, “I was never going to be free if I was in the other dom’s grasp. I took my chance. I- for all the years- my father- Obi- I was never going to be free. I just wanted it to end-“
“Good,” Bucky said before snatching a sanitized dish towel and heading off, “holler if you need help.”
“Nothing, I just need to know why Captain America keeps calling you,” the woman continued, playing with a knife, “why you?”
Tony was… if he could dare say it, he was happy. Steve spoiled him rotten with love and kisses. Just waking up in his lover’s arms made him beam. Tony touched Steve more often, no longer shy and uncertain but bold and flirty. Steve reciprocated with touches of his own, on Tony’s arm, around his waist, his face, his hair. Tony loved it.
Tony stayed stark still, frozen under Steve’s slack body, though his walls continued to milk Steve’s cock.
As the man disappeared beyond a door, Tony stopped, blinking. The doors were enormous bold dark mahogany wood. He felt entranced, opening the door with both hands, revealing a huge open altar where, though empty, Tony felt the presence of hundreds people in the pews, watching him.
Tony tried to relax, but his heart rate speed erratically, body anticipating pain. His breathing went rabbid and his eyes widened with fear until Steve kissed him, slow and languid. Then he remembered, he was here with Steve. Steve would not hurt him. He promised he’d go slow. He’d prioritize Tony over his own pleasure.
That night, while Rogers was brushing his teeth, Tony reached inwardly for the courage to ask, “why are you doing this?”
Tony wasn’t listening anymore, his whole world was crashing down on him. He had escaped one prison for another.
Tony turned to see Sasha standing awkwardly between their clasped hands. Tony instinctively let go, “oh, sorry, I-“
“Why should I?” Tony said, voice completely toneless, “you would never agree. You’re a dom, you can do whatever you want with me. You don’t care about what I say.”
Tony knew this story, having heard it from his father, but he listened dutifully. There were details he hadn’t heard before, and it calmed him to hear about what really happened to Bucky Barnes. Tony’s heart broke all over again when he heard Steve talk about how his best friend fell to his death on that fatal train ride.
“Because there is someone in you. Someone wonderful, strong, gorgeous. Someone I could get lost in. Someone I could love fiercely with all my heart,” Rogers confessed passionately, holding Tony’s face in one hand. Tony leaned into it, anticipating a kiss, “but he’s not there. Not yet.”
“More, daddy, I need your to-“ Tony whined but Steve was one step ahead. He took Tony’s cock in his hand, and began rubbing it, squeezing, and playing with the weeping head, urging it to completion. Tony cried out as he came. Steve came not a moment later, inside his lover. He bit down at the long column of Tony’s beautiful neck, rubbing and nuzzling the mark.
Tony’s eyes went to his dom who had a complex expression on his face. Tony lowered his head, “sorry, I-“
“Tony Carbonall,” Reed explained, “you haven’t met him but he’s the one the initial creators of the Avengers resistance. He recruited all of us. He’s quite secretive himself but we believe in his cause and that he’s doing the right thing. He works for Stark Industries but as a cover, that’s how he said he met Iron man. I’m sure you’ll meet him when we hit land.”
“Come on, Tony,” Greg tutted in frustration, “you have to choose someone who can give you a family. Someone kind, honest, loyal-“
Tony was entranced. He felt like someone else. The tingle of fear that was not his own, misplaced anxiety, and
“Makes me wonder why Hydra let the Starks keep such an enormous collection of Captain America memorabilia,” Reed said, contemplative.
Tony blinked as he saw the blond haired man in the house next door wave at Tony as he was heading towards his beat up car.
Steve sighed, leaning out to pull the dark haired genius into a hug from behind, “Tony, I don’t want to stop seeing you. Do you want to stop seeing me?”
Percy looked thoughtful for a minute and then his eyes widened and he looked at Peter concerned. It seemed as if they were having a conversation yet neither one said anything. Percy then stood up and dragged Peter out of the room.
Mr.Stark tried not to snort as he suited up. Ideally he would make some snippy comment and then dramatically Iron Man it up but he figured the kid seemed to have that covered. Percy was already kicking one of the aliens butts. He had busted one of the pipes running under New York for some water which both made him stronger and seemed to short out the space raisans weapons. Tony figured that he should probably help now so he shot into the air firing his blasters at them. Things were going decently enough, Peter and Death kid quickly joined them. Peter and Percy ended up working together seamlessly and Death- Nico was doing some creepy skeleton stuff but hey who was Stark to complain as long as he was on their side. But then the magicians showed up again. Said something about using the stone was the best was to protect it. Or some stupid reasoning like that. And wizard cape guy got himself kidnapped by the prune.
Peter pulled a face that screamed WHAT THE HELL...or maybe he was just thinking about the thousands of followers he had on his Thor fan blog on Tumblr.
Fury occurs the moment he realized it was a fake. The gem is smashed and Strange is thrown into the grown, the impact makes him blackout. Out of nowhere a red and gold device latches itself onto the infinity gauntlet,
”Damn. We are oblivious to how did my AI not- oh never mind I want to try something. Follow me please young children!”
Both Peter and Percy, had been dreading this all day. For one, Percy was just worried he was about to piss off another god or primordial being. And Peter, he really didn't want to relive what happened to his Uncle Ben, but he figured he had to be honest if he wanted an honest response from his new friend. ”Yeah, yeah I think we do.”
Peter shifted in his seat and watched as they approached the building, ”Well knowing him he's done his own research. He might just want to know more? Or ask your experience? He is a very instinctive man, it's hard to tell.”
And so Percy told him everything. Starting from the beginning when he was 12 with the whole lightning bolt fiasco, going to the Titan war, even mentioning vaguely his time in Tartarus. Percy surprised himself with that. He hadn't really talked about that with anyone. Not even Annabeth. In fact he hasn't spoken to her in a while...but somehow with Peter it was easy. He didn't know why but he trusted Peter. He felt like he could tell him anything.
Peter smiled and tackled him in a hug. They laid there for the rest of the night calmy,  a smile on each of their faces, happy and close.
”Peter, you're babbling and I'm afraid I'm having a hard time following what you are saying. Can you start from the beginning?” Mr.Stark said.
”The feats of Perseus Jackson are known far and wide across the galaxy. Just because those ungrateful mortals ignore you and the gods time after time take advantage of you does not mean your feats go in- noticed. They force you into situations where you have to choose, right and wrong, good and bad. But you and I both know there is more to it then that, the world is a lot more- grey than people let one, ” Thanos has taken a step back, no longer in a combative stance, ”You’ve been through so much young one, you must be so tired, so tired of fighting, so tired of being forced into battles where you shouldn't be involved. First the Greeks, then Romans, Egyptians, Norse, now this. Perseus, this is not your fight.”
After everyone was done questioning the existence of Gamora, who was obviously very important to the group, especially if they were here on Titan seemingly very pissed off at Thanos. If Percy was being completely he was having trouble keeping track of the conversation, his demigod senses were running wild accessing the situation. He was hyper-aware of the arm around Peters' neck. His main focus was getting his...whatever Peter was to him out of danger. Percy was pretty sure if he repositioned riptide he’d be able to free Peter, but he had no idea how fast this man was with his trigger. Strange could probably prevent the gun from firing, maybe make a portal and get them to safety, but he had no idea how to communicate his plan to the older man.
Peter ended up sitting at Percy’s- well Poseidon’s table at dinner. Chiron tried to make him sit at the Hermès but Percy wasn’t having it. Peter awkwardly followed the line of people who were dumping parts of their food in the flame, when Peter asked why Percy mumbled, “Offerings to the gods. It's not enough that their omnipotent and all-powerful, they need to feel appreciated!”
So I wasn't going to post this part until later but I saw a twitter post that made me cry for about a half hour so I needed something hopeful to be added to my stort :) hope you all like this addition.
Percy instinctively dove in after him and made an air bubble around them laughing, ”How in Hades did you manage that?!”
They saw the man who called himself Dr.Strange being monologued by the purple squidward alien along with strange bluish silver bars surrounding him. Some type of advanced alien tech. But Peter was no where to be seen. There was a strange lump-like feeling in Percy’s stomach, he wasn’t used to it, sure he had been afraid for someone before but he didn’t ever think he had been this worried. Stark was obviously assessing the situation just like he was,  determining their next move. The situation seemed slightly helpless, they were at a terrible angle, sure they could see Strange, but they had no idea exactly how many aliens were aboard this ship, nor did they know what sort of weapons they had. It also seemed like a bad idea to move for the same reason, they were hidden and had no way of knowing if there was another spot they could get too quietly enough to observe what was going on.
There were small things that did change between them. Whenever Tony felt emboldened or particularly grateful, he’d give Rogers a kiss. Usually a peck, nothing like in the field. Tony even touched Rogers at times. On the arm, the back, around the neck. Rogers would return the favor.
What happened next was too quick for Tony to focus on. Suddenly Rogers was in the middle of a fight with all of the people in Hammer’s crowd, easily disarming and knocking people unconscious. In fact, he looked bored.
