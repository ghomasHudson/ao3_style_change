Tony took a deep breath, mentally checking his defenses. Phone, earpiece, nanite glove. Steve. “Let’s go.”
The portal closed.
“If his Majesty doesn’t mind, I’ll take the final question,” Tony drawled into the microphone, and deliberately waited for T’Challa’s nod before pointing into the eager sea of reporters. “You there, with the face. No, not you. Yes, your face.”
“Wouldn’t you like to eat something first, Tony?” Romanoff asked, her gaze boring through him.
Oh. “In Wakanda?”
Tony’s pulse hammered a drumbeat the whole way to the car, which Tiberius had parked in the most sheltered corner of the lot. The bigger man was always keen to avoid scrutiny, but the Compound was a bad place for that. Windows everywhere, by design.
Schmidt floated closer, a peculiar intensity in his eyes. “How fitting that of all living souls, it comes to you and I, here at the end,” he murmured. The Captain registered the possible threat, Nebula also on guard. Steve couldn’t care. “I have spent so many years searching for ways to complete my service and be free, to no avail. But thanks to you, Captain Rogers, I see my path to redemption.”
There was no alert, this time. Only a blue mist, and there he was.
But Peter would hear the glass break. He would be the one to rush in, and look down, and see-
“Great, thanks,” Steve answered. “Although I wasn’t really hungry.” Which was true. And not. The serum pangs were always there. Unseen. Not really his.
know of,” Tony muttered, but instead of arguing, T’Challa just smirked. “Look, Barnes,” Tony said, keeping his expression aggressively neutral, “Wakanda’s the better option if you’re looking to stay off the radar, but if you’d prefer to go home, I promise I’ll do what I can.” He grimaced, as if his own words tasted unpleasant. “But don’t mistake the offer for me giving a shit,” he continued. “This isn’t forgiveness, it’s the job. If you don’t have a preference, just flip a coin or whatever. Either way, it’s up to you.”
Steering. Right. The billionaire shook his head, and ruthlessly brought his errant thoughts back under control. Not Steve’s fault. Momentary lapse.
he was on his way
“I’m here,” came Tony’s soft reply.
The other man looked close to tears, but he listened. “Okay,” he said.
Rogers, of course, was in his element. Asking questions, offering suggestions. Making
Tony gritted his teeth against yet another wave of slow, hot tears, trying to shelve his own misery but failing. It wasn’t fair. This was supposed to be the better future, the one where everyone could live mundanely ever after, as happily or as miserably as they wanted. To win it back, Tony had been willing to sacrifice everything, pay any price. But not this. Not
, Steve, and then they were kissing again, skin on heated skin, and it was both too much and not enough. Tony wanted to stay just like this forever but also wanted to break away because they were just
Barnes shook his head. “He was protecting us both. Without him, I wouldn’t have fought back. It would have been murder.”
Sam caught up but didn’t touch him this time, just kept pace beside him as Steve slowed his walk, got his breathing back under control. Gone. “You good, man?” Sam asked eventually.
love you?”
“I will give you anything you ask,” Nebula declared. “My body, my mind, my soul. Name your price.”
Besides, even if this new future insisted he no could longer fit where he had once belonged, telling Pepper about his day had always been Tony’s favorite part of coming home.
Once Tony was settled, Steve dared to look around. Clint was still sitting at the deserted table, staring at the wall. Nat was pacing back and forth near the door, fists clenching, then releasing. Bruce was standing nearby with his eyes closed, muttering fervently. Sam and Bucky both stood back, upset but discreet. Rhodey-
It brought a chill to his bones.
“Even in defeat, you defy the inevitable,” Thanos said. “Your spirit is impressive, Stark. I believe I will remember you fondly. As a reward for your courage, I will not draw unnecessary blood through the mechanisms of armies and war. No, your planet’s balancing will be clean and merciful, in your honor. This is my final gift to you.” Tony stared up at him, still struggling to catch a breath, never mind respond.
It had taken the team weeks to find their target on Titan, and that was when they had known what they were looking for; as they set off across the anonymous plain Tony was prepared for Vormir to be a disappointment, but after just a few minutes, Nebula called a halt.
Thanos gestured to the gauntlet on his arm. “My mission will soon be complete. Allow me to obtain the Time Stone, and I will return you to the past. All I ask is that you stand down from this fight, Captain. Leave this unhappy time to its miserable end. Surrender to the kindness of Thanos, and good fortune will at last be yours.” The alien waited, his enormous chin arrogantly high.
The blue pillar lit up, emitting a long enthusiastic flash of light, followed with slower, dimmer pulses by the rest. The Soul Stone smiled, corrected herself. “We all will. And after, if you survive, we will honor your courage with any reward you may dream.”
“Name it,” Tony said, ready to win him the world.
On the hill, they sit, limbs comfortably tangled; their watch marks the passage of yet another day. Yet another year.
“Is the pain back?” the other man asked, hands fidgeting helplessly at the air. “Should I call someone?
“No, Steve,” Tony said, steady despite his pulse pounding in his ears. “It’s not awful. It’s sad, and I hate it, but it’s the truth. And please, trust me, this is exactly the kind of thing I want to know. That I want you to tell me, if you can.”
Steve knows his presence will change this world. He’s counting on it. And yet, in this moment, he hates himself for it.
, fell beyond the reach of acceptable, were deserving of being erased. He did not know why that idea felt so threatening - or maybe he did; hello, textbook narcissism - but that was a bargain he would never accept. Better to share; better to speak. Better, always, not to carry it alone.
God, Steve had so much to apologize for. Despite his resolve to be patient, Steve had the sudden impulse to stampede into the other room and demand to know what Tony was thinking. He could only imagine what the other man must be feeling. The video of his parents would have been devastating to witness, both as a son and as evidence of Steve’s betrayal. Despite their friendship, Steve had expected the worst of Tony, had kept quiet for fear of Tony’s vengeance if he ever discovered the truth. Yet even under the worst possible circumstances, Tony hadn’t lashed out. He had recoiled instead, escape his first anguished instinct. Too late, Steve had seen the danger in his inaction, had understood the awful cost of his silence.
“Congratulations on adding one more failure to your list,” Steve said. Petty, but whatever.
Yet the shield never wavered. “I don’t normally hold with crude language,” Rogers said, “but you can kindly go fuck yourself.”
Steve could only blink, because he hadn’t, in fact, thought of that. At all. It seemed a ludicrous possibility.
Yet there were still tears in her eyes. “I’m sorry too. But after you left Earth, I made a decision, Tony.” And she held up her left hand.
Tony found the trail down to the water and followed it without much difficulty, this being their eighth day at this particular location. As he approached their usual barrel-filling rock, he saw the three large containers sitting empty nearby, but no sign of Steve. He frowned, looking around, trying to suppress the usual stab of nerves that signaled something was not as expected, then closed his eyes and tried to listen to the forest around him. Steve’s trick, from his war days. Granted, it was slightly harder to discern the relative normality of sounds in an alien ecosystem, but the surrounding wildlife were busily chattering away in their strange knocking version of birdsong, and it was silence that Steve had always warned him about. So, there was probably not a space bear, about to eat him.
“On our way,” Tony called over, and he shot Steve a grin that promised mischief. “I’m so gonna tell him,” he teased.
Eventually he got up and sat next to Steve. “I
Instead he took a deep, cleansing breath, then another, feeling the sweet truth settle into him, head to toe. It was done. Steve was beaming at him, radiating pride and love and joy. It was over.
And then, with a sting of remorse, Steve realized why. Thanks to the terms of his parole, Steve still wasn’t allowed to leave the Compound without clearance. It was no coincidence that for the past couple of years, Stark had rarely bothered to show his face there, despite living in Stone’s ridiculous mansion a mere hour away. But Bucky was still in Wakanda and had offered his help in the upcoming battle. If he’d stuck with that team, Stark would have had to work alongside the man who murdered his parents, all while fighting the end of the world.
“He’s
It seemed he wasn’t the only one. After they landed, Nebula and Rocket stayed in the cockpit running scans of the local area while Tony, Thor, Bruce and Steve rejoined Clint and Natasha in the larger cargo area. The two spies had already finished up the final equipment checks, and for the next few minutes, there was nothing for the strike team to do but wait. Steve looked around. There had been an awkward moment back on Earth when he’d first realized the initial team was going to include only the original Avengers, but considering they hadn’t fought together since Sokovia, having a kind of reunion now felt nice. Felt fitting, being here together in this terrible now.
- they would have to live up to the name. As if everything in their lives had inevitably led up to this moment, the job not just another mission but some grand confluence of destiny. He was as ready as he could be, Steve thought. His body felt strong and rested. His mind felt focused and calm. In the inner space the Captain was waiting. But even there, in the most stable place he knew, Steve could feel a lurking terror underneath, a barely suppressed tremble that warned of the hell to come the second he stopped fighting the fear into remission. And looking around, he could see the same in his teammates, the struggle it took just to stand still.
It all escapes him then. Her death. Hulk’s Snap. Younger Thanos, their victory. The cost. She listens. Clint listens. Even Schmidt listens, floating nearby, like a nightmare. Steve breaks down for the first time since… and Nat holds him close. She’d always known.
“The word you say when you want the other person to stop,” Ty said.
Duty was an eclipse.
“You promised you wouldn’t leave me,” Steve whispered, when he could.
Somehow, his former nickname made Steve’s heart ache worse than his ribs, but once more the pain medication was softening his grip on the conversation. “Okay,” he whispered, his eyes drifting shut.
“Steve.”
The air surged back into his lungs in a painful rush, and Tony rolled over, coughing. By the time the dizziness let him stand, Thanos had been hammered into retreat by the glowing woman’s fists, cheered on by a visibly uninjured Peter. Tony watched the alien make his escape through a portal, leaving the shattered street silent and empty.
Steve could almost admire the brutal ambition of the Sokovian soldier’s scheme. Psychological warfare had never really interested him, the long-armed delicacy required seeming too fickle for the coarse churn of the battlefield, too dependent on luck and circumstance. Yet in his quest to dismantle the Avengers, Zemo had been able to identify Steve as the team’s weakest link and ruthlessly exploit his flaws, all from a comfortable distance.
take this… I’m the one who fucked up here, Steve. Not you. Jesus, why would you- Steve, I knew
“That’s a really excellent question, Rogers. What
go to him-”
Steve hesitated. “Do you feel, in your mind, like there’s something… waiting?”
As Rhodey stepped back, Nat slipped close and pressed her lips to Tony’s cheek. He smiled. “Go save the world,” he told them.
The silence stretched, an endless void into which it seemed no one dared to speak.
Steve pushed the memory back, tried to lock it down with all the rest. To remember was to grieve, and this was no time to feel sorry for himself. He had a choice to make.
Steve nodded, then looked around. Thor had moved Thanos about fifty metres away, and apparently Clint was taking no more chances; the Mad Titan was now pinned with multiple arrows through his limbs as he slumped against a nearby tree. Steve waited for some part of him to protest the inhumane treatment of a dying prisoner, but apparently no such part was left. The arrow had at least given his body something to focus on, a channel for his excess energy, and he felt strangely relieved. With the outer signs of his wound was already closing, Steve struggled to his feet. Tony stepped in close to help, and stayed close.
,” Steve said, his voice cracking. “
-the ensuite bathroom door opened, and Steve emerged, froze. Beard gone. Explaining the Steve-gone. The cold bed.
The answer, when it came, sent ice down his spine. “You know why.”
But Steve couldn’t bear it, the mask blocking his face, the fake air, he couldn’t
“I’m not gonna lie. Yesterday was a tough day. Maybe the toughest,” he heard Steve say. So close. Now nothing but air. “If anyone needs more time, take it. But no matter the complications, our objective hasn’t changed. Starting today, we move forward.” Tony opened his eyes and watched faces as Steve stared around the group, making eye contact with everyone in turn. Their Captain. “You all know the plan. Let’s get to it.”
Eventually Stark slammed to his feet to leave the room, but at that very moment the public alert went off, signalling yet another alien arrival.
Six weeks of Steve persuading people to hope, to hold on, to try just a little longer, even as he knew he was asking the impossible.
Tony had… he had forgotten to check on him. Had, in fact, forgotten all about him.
Steve jerked away as if burnt. “What is this…?”
Rocket rolled his eyes but joined in. “Meaning those shiny magic rocks don’t play by our rules.”
“I’m sorry,” Vision told her. “There will likely be significant changes, even with total success. For one, I expect to lose most of my combat abilities. Yet the risk to life everywhere is too great, otherwise.”
“Not… exactly?” Tony said.
understand?” Tony bit out, as if irritated by his confusion. “What should I tell you? What makes you think I need
“No,” Tony said, frowning as he began to catch on. “He did not.”
And right on cue, Ty switched on the audio. “… stop it, Steve,
The other man leaned back in his chair. “Wow,” he drawled, voice dripping with derision. Steve’s stomach lurched. “How very
“I don’t understand,” the super-soldier whispered, “I don’t-”
Tony took another bite of his apple. “Eat, you dork.”
“Is that why you found…” Steve couldn’t bring himself to say the man’s name, but Tony seemed to know what he was trying to ask.
The super-soldier sat and started assembling a sandwich. In his hasty preparations, Tony hadn’t had time to do much beyond grab the basics, but he’d made sure to pack enough to satisfy even Steve’s enhanced appetite. He soon discovered to his horror that building a well-balanced sandwich was evidently not included in basic Army training; Steve was apparently satisfied with slapping plain cheese onto dry bread and cramming the result into his mouth. It was, frankly, an outrage. After Tony’s intervention on the sandwich front, Steve volunteered to brew some tea. (“So what, like, you carry around a hot plate for emergencies?” Tony asked, confused. “There’s this thing called ‘fire’, Tony,” Steve said, then laughed for three entire minutes. Tony counted.)
“We’re going to go back,” the other man told him. “You are going to sign the Accords, and we’re going to be a team. But you will never, ever, touch me again.”
Given the increasingly strained faces of the lab team, Steve had anticipated delays, but the timeline was still a blow. Not Tony’s fault, though. “We’ll take it slow if we have to. For now let’s work through the variables. Figure out if a strike on Titan is even feasible.”
the best thing that’s ever happened to him. Even MJ’s excited.”
Tony Stark, literal genius, pretended ignorance. “Like what?”
Steve’s mistrust of the Accords rose up within him, deep as ever, but this time his resistance crumbled under the weight of Tony’s gaze. Defeated, he nodded, and Tony’s eyes widened slightly.
But even that tiny spark of possibility led his thoughts down dark paths, because soon it wouldn’t matter anyway. Soon, Steve would erase this aberrant future, and if by some miracle he survived, he would have to live on in a shiny happy world with a spiteful Tony who still wanted to hate his guts, from whom Steve might never receive a second chance. If there had been some sort of complication growing between them… If Tony told him how he felt… Would it be cruel to let Steve know just what he would be erasing?
“Uh, he is
Tony wanted to resist on principle, but he really was so exhausted. “Ten minutes, tops,” he murmured.
“I just…” And just like that, Steve was hit with an errant flash of recent memory of Tony pressed against the glass, all dark eyes and promises. “I don’t…” Steve had been asking for…
Unable to resist, Steve seized Tony’s mouth in an eager, clumsy kiss. “God, yeah,” he muttered when they broke for breath. “And, and vice-versa, Tony. Everything.”
Steve swallows. “Yeah.”
Steve was smiling right back, his blue eyes sparkling with warmth and love and humor. “I mean, they are kinda cute-”
Tony stared at his spoon. He hadn’t finished his pudding.
“You’re welcome,” Tony says, then gives him a tiny crooked smile.
“At first, yeah, maybe.” The other man’s laugh was bitter. Embarrassed. “Guess I picked the right guy for that job.”
Nebula stopped in front of Thanos, stared down at him. The Mad Titan opened his eyes, squinted up at her. “You,” he breathed, and the scorn that dripped from his tone fell like a lash.
“Do you know what this, Captain Rogers?” she asked when he joined her. A hologram of some sort of plant was projected before her, rotating slowly.
She joins him, shoulder to shoulder, silent until she sighs. “Such power in your possession, Captain, and yet here you stand on the sidelines. Are you not at all tempted to use it?”
Chewing. Bland, nutritious. Good. No point. There was something very wrong, he thought.
, and as Earth’s shakiest heroes head out the door, Steve has the weirdest feeling that things might actually turn out okay.
The other man gave a quick cough to clear his throat. He looked so tired. “Uh, so turns out Fury was holding out on us. Again. This time, it was some kind of glowing super-woman. Her name’s Carol; she’s nice. Came back from her space vacation when Fury called, smashed Thanos halfway to next Christmas before he tapped out.”
“Yeah,” Tony said. “Uh. Is he here?”
“A lot has happened, Pepper,” he said, hating how his voice shook; her hand paused, but resumed its gentle strokes.
“But I had the choice,” Bucky said. “It’s good, having the choice.”
“I know. I know, Steve. But it’s too much, this way. You have to stop. Wait for us to figure out how to help you.”
Heartbreak had nothing on the thought of Steve Rogers being lonely.
. Not
“Don’t get your sparkle-pants in a twist,” Tony said breezily while rolling his eyes, which meant he was properly injured. “Got my head rattled by some road, saw stars for a bit, which up til that moment I had assumed was just a cartoon thing-”
Tony was crying, so hard he couldn’t see.
It feels like watching him die all over again.
In the following days, they all move into the Tower. The team becomes friends, then family.
Secret words, danger, unstoppable. Wrong.
For now, the Captain had his own job to do. Steve left Thanos’ cracked Gauntlet under the capable protection of Natasha and Rocket, ducking out of the hut’s low doorway and blinking in the harsh noon sunlight. He was aware of Tony following him out, a little surprised that the billionaire wasn’t choosing to stay and nerd out with the others.
Then he pulled away and began to cough in tight, harsh barks. Even as someone replaced Steve’s oxygen mask and the spasm slowly eased, Tony focused only on the sensation of his fingers trailing through Steve’s hair, along his brow. He didn’t notice when someone replaced the visor over his face, too busy was he memorizing every expression that flickered across Steve’s face. Serene and pale, Steve lay and stared right back at him, eased into the deep contentment Tony had witnessed only briefly, once before.
All things are possible, he reminds himself.
, Steve, god, whatever you want,” Tony blurted out, clumsy with desperation.
“Please, Steve,” Tony begged, and there were tears blurring his vision. “We just need a little more time, that’s all. Please give us more time.”
Drawn out of his misery by the novelty, Tony took a full lap for a better view, noticing how it looked like the portal could be entered from the back as well as the front. In a time of magical apocalypses such a detail should not have creeped him out, but wow, it
“I don’t want to go,” Steve said, meeting his eyes, urgent. “But I can’t promise I won’t.”
“You never asked either,” Steve said.
“Not a good time,” she said tightly.
Barnes muttered something under his breath in Russian which translated to, “dear god, there’s two of them.” Then Barnes was moving, grabbing a pillow off the bed and dropping it to the floor before sitting on it. He slouched back against the wall and sighed. “Look, Steve’ll be back soon, then you can talk to him yourself. In the meantime, tell me more about Asimov.”
And then he would die.
Busy demolishing sandwiches, it took Steve a while to catch on but eventually he saw Clint giving Tony some narrowed glances, muttering to Nat beside him. The heat of his fury took Steve's breath away; carefully, so Tony wouldn’t notice, Steve stared daggers at the archer.
“Showed up, headed straight for Vision so Wanda… Wanda took him out.”
Steve had been appalled to realize that this had always been Stark’s plan, but for whatever reason the man hadn’t trusted Steve enough to share his full intentions. Yet thinking back, it was hard to blame him. As a colleague, Steve hadn’t listened, hadn’t trusted him enough to sign even though the billionaire had basically begged. And as a person, Steve hadn’t been brave, hadn’t done the right thing when it mattered most. Regardless of subsequent events, Steve knew Stark had paid a bitter price for Steve’s own mistrust, being the one Zemo had sought to destroy.
Suddenly desperate,
“I’m fine,” came the annoyed reply; Tony released a breath he hadn’t known he was holding.
“…yeah? Maybe.” And Tony stored away his regrets for what might have been, alongside all the others. “Anyway. Once we got to Titan, we met up with some other folks looking for Thanos. Rocket’s people. Decent fighters, but not… Luckily we had some time to kill. That’s when the wizard used the Time Stone to sneak a peek at the future. Steve, he said we could win. That there was a way. But only one.”
It took only three days for Steve to smash his stupid vow into tiny stupid little pieces.
Steve’s laugh made his nose crinkle. “Eh. Call it a draw?”
“Take me through it, Rhodey,” Tony requested. “What happened after I left?”
“You know, it’s funny, really,” Steve tells him, his voice rough. “When I came back in time, I never expected to be doing this again. I mean, theoretically I knew this day might come, but… I guess I never thought I’d actually make it this far.”
Safe. They were safe.
And so he did, leading the super-soldier outside into the warm sunshine and onto the waiting speeder, the onboard map blinking arrows towards their destination. Driving on land or sea never produced quite the same thrill as flying, but as he pushed the vehicle as fast as it could go, Tony felt like he could soar at the windswept bliss on Steve’s face.
As the other man searched for his keys, Tony stared up at the windows, blank and unfeeling, no protection at all. Then, as if conjured from a dream, Tony saw the familiar figure; just a dark shape behind the glass, but somehow Tony knew.
Afterwards, all Steve could remember of the battle was a series of crystalline moments, all else a blur in between.
“I’m afraid your oxygen levels are still falling, Steve,” Helen said. “With your permission, we would like to put you on a ventilator to help you breathe.” She could barely meet Tony’s eyes.
Stark was staring down at it, his nose crinkled in confusion. “You told me that was a real-time feed of an alien sky.”
“King of the North,” Shuri greeted him. The memory of the first time she’d called him that made Tony smile. But it also felt so very long ago.
“Hi,” Pepper said, caressing his forehead, his cheek. He surrendered to her touch, content, watching her face. “I heard you had quite the trip,” she said eventually, a hint of… something… in her voice. Of course. New York. To her, he had just left. Had left her.
, leading people on only to disappoint them later, you ever think that
Pepper squeezed his hand. Kind. Wrong. Why? “I just wanted to let you know, I called off the wedding as soon as Tony left on that ship. So whatever you two have been up to these past six months, he’s not… He’s free to figure it out.”
He can’t remember the last time he’s been this turned on during his first time with someone. He barely even knows this guy, yet all he can think of is burying his dick inside him. Like he’s been waiting his whole life for this moment. His hand trembles a bit as he moves his thumb to pull at Tony’s hole, which gives nicely as Steve pushes inside. He pulls back out and pushes two fingers inside instead, enjoying Tony’s hitching breath as he stretches him.
Steve had heard about rimming. If the Internet was good for anything, it was informing him of what SHIELD’s uncomfortably detailed course on twenty-first century sexual norms had omitted. He hadn’t imagined that it would do much for him, but now? He was starting to reconsider.
His heart leapt in his chest when he heard the sound of a zipper being pulled down.
“You with me, sunshine?”
good at the same time. He almost missed Tony asking him if he was okay or not.
“Fuckin’ Morikawa wouldn’t stop filling my cup,” he grumbled before closing his eyes again.
Keeping his eyes closed let him focus on everything else: he was warm and dry, which meant that Tony must’ve cleaned him up afterward. He smiled to himself at the thought.
, but…
Tony waved a hand as though dismissing the billion-yen deals he was supposed to be negotiating. “Yeah, but it’s pretty boring, to be honest. Stuffy meetings while I listen to old dudes drone on about technology they barely even understand.”
, since when did his company hire a total specimen like this guy? Tall, built, and definitely Tony’s type. He knows he would have remembered walking past this guy in the hallway—that hip to shoulder ratio
Tony regretted it as soon as he opened his eyes.
Tony dropped to his knees and crawled over Steve. He thought the alien creature would feel wrong, but it was… nice. Its body was warm to the touch, and it shifted around to accommodate Tony.
Bruce nodded. “Like I said, it’ll take a day to run the rest of my tests. As far as I can tell, though, you’re fine. There haven’t been any lasting effects.”
Sliding an arm around him, Tony rested his head right behind his ear. “You haven’t felt me enough, tonight?” He reveled in the way Steve shivered against him.
Tony’s gaze locked with Steve’s, though his expression was no longer flirty and lust-filled. He had the same look in his eyes that he had whenever he started on a new version of the Iron Man armor.
He breathed a sigh of relief when he finally reached his own reserved place at the end of the room. Keeping the dead weight of the man’s body balanced with one hand, he reached for his key card in the other and swiped it over the lock to open the door. The door opened with a soft click and Steve hooked his foot into it to nudge it open.
Steve couldn’t help laughing at Tony’s ridiculousness. “Hi,” he replied.
it. Won’t be long, now. You’ll like this, I promise.”
Natasha was heading off of the mat. “Like I said, we’ve decided this situation needed an intervention.” She turned to him, her red hair swaying over her shoulders. “No hard feelings, Steve. Tony will be here any second to let you out.”
Steve nods. “I… I know. I mean, I wouldn’t lie to you.”
Steve wanted to shake his head, but he felt paralyzed by Tony’s gaze.
Steve couldn’t help his own big grin in response. “Sure, Tony.”
What he hadn’t been prepared for, though, was the after work drinking culture. See also: fucking sake. The kind they’d had at the shabu shabu place had been some high quality stuff that looked like water. The flavor hadn’t been much, but it’d left a nice after taste in the mouth. Tony hadn’t realized just how much he’d had until he was face down on the table, his limbs like lead. When he’d finally summoned up the energy to look around, he saw all of his colleagues similarly knocked out. Fan-fucking-tastic.
“T-Tony…” Steve said, his cheeks burning. Apparently feeling exposed like this did things for him because he could feel his cock harden further, too. More precome leaked down his shaft. He couldn’t help shivering.
“That’s… not part of the whole process, no.”
Steve glanced down at his stomach again and gasped when he realized Tony was right. He could see the way his stomach was swelling even further under Tony’s hand. Really, it should be alarming, Steve distantly thought to himself. Instead, it was the hottest thing he’d ever seen. His cock certainly agreed with him, not even letting the amount of times he’d already come deter it from filling out again in record time.
Tony settles into the musty sheets with a sigh and lets Steve bandage him up. An odd sort of calm settles over the room soon afterward. He hears Steve get up and start moving about. A glance at the window shows that the snowfall has already picked up significantly. He sighs and settles further into the musty sheets of the cot’s mattress. He’s starting to sweat and he’s pretty sure that isn’t related to the room’s temperature. He groans as another sharp bit of pain lances through his back.
“I’m sorry,” Steve finished.
“And you still feel that way?”
,” Steve gasps, his voice thin and raspy.
Steve nodded fervently. “’Course.”
“Don’t you think we owe them?”
Tony wastes no time getting in contact with JARVIS on his phone. He isn’t exactly happy with what the AI is telling him.
He pushes back into Steve’s embrace and lets out a content sigh. Steve mumbles something into his ear, and before Tony knows it, the world is shifting around him until, disoriented, he finds himself in Steve’s lap. They’re sitting on Tony’s discarded jacket, he realizes. His legs are covered by Steve’s discarded shirt, keeping them warm. Steve wraps his arms around Tony in a strong embrace.
“Should I call you when he does, Sir?”
Suddenly everything fell into place to form a finished puzzle in Steve’s mind. He took two bold steps forward and grabbed Tony’s shoulder, stopping him in his tracks. Tony glared up at him, but Steve didn’t let that stop him.
okay, isn’t he?”
Bruce didn’t look appeased by that answer. “Tony… you know this whole thing isn’t your fault, right? I’m the one that wanted to keep the specimen.”
Tony sinks into Steve’s embrace. He can’t remember the last time he’s felt this relaxed. Relaxed and… safe. Being connected to Steve like this just feels so
The first brush of its legs against the oversensitive head of his cock was like nothing else he’d ever felt in his life. He cried out wordlessly and came again, hard. As though sensing his pleasure, the creature closed its legs around his cock to cradle it between its legs and its underbelly as it continued to raise itself into the air above him.
“Yeah?” Steve pushes his hand back against the swell of Tony’s abdomen and they both groan. “Feels good to be all filled up?”
“Well, this isn’t going to be fun, but that’s going to need to come off.”
Then he picks up a lavender rose, dreamily, inevitably, and holds it out to the man by his side. Time itself seems to stop, the electric uncertainty nearly setting Steve on fire when Tony just stares at the flower, dark eyes growing wide with its meaning.
!” the other man yelled, leaping to his feet. But to Steve’s horror, Tony wavered as if he would fall, only a quick grab at the chair saving his balance. Too late; instinctively, Steve had tried to sit up, to go to him, but the first slight motion summoned the shrieking agony in his chest, the reality of his injuries smashing him flat.
“Third cup gives you jitters,” the super-soldier reminded him, then frowned down at his outstretched hand.
“I presented him with the option,” Steve clarifies. “He decided to take it.” Across the table, Tony looks genuinely miffed at the abandonment, which makes Steve’s heart clench with painful affection.
He’d sat by Peggy’s bedside all night, listening to her rasping breath. At some point Steve had fallen asleep, and when he woke he’d lost his grip on where he was. When he was. For a minute, he was that angry kid again, ordering his mother to keep fighting even as her disease stole the very air from her lungs, helpless to do anything but watch her drown.
time…”
He caught her hand between both of his. “I fear you must,” Vision said softly.
Yet he never reached the end of his sentence; a blonde woman wearing a plastic visor burst into the room, a phone clutched between her shoulder and her ear. She tossed a similar visor to an equally confused Tony. “Put that on,” she ordered, then turned to Steve in the bed. “Hi, Captain Rogers, I’m Doctor Palmer. I’m sorry for the rush, but on Doctor Cho’s advice we are going to move you to isolation immediately.”
“Guess not,” Tony says after just a tiny pause, but it’s enough for the grief to rush back in.
Weeks pass.
“Technically thirty-four,” Steve snapped, feeling slightly aggrieved, “and I let people get close all the time.”
Tony nodded. “I sent him back but he snuck on board before the donut left orbit.”
, ready, his cheek so soft and warm and real against Tony’s fingertips. The other man closed his eyes and leaned helplessly into the contact with a groan; Tony felt some trapped twisted thing within him, half-buried, half-prized, finally surrender to peace.
“Okay,” Steve said. “I won’t, I- Whatever you need, Tony. Tell me, please. You have to understand, I want to make this right.”
Once the team had reached a consensus on their next moves, they’d turned in, and this time Steve had curled around Tony for comfort; he’d held the super-soldier close until the trembling stopped, and then, probably, they’d both slept. Morning brought a strong breeze, hectic leaves, more of the same bad dream he was beginning to realize was just life now. Also low voices. Pity glances. Tony had always known he was the weak link of the team, and now everyone else knew it too. He didn’t care, and thought it a bad sign. Empty.
. Unable to bear the man’s touch, he flinched away, his very skin aching at the loss of Tony’s heat.
Tony grinned, unable- no,
“Okay,” he said. “Do you need me to… do you want company?”
something.”
“I strongly disagree and will fight you over everything you just said,” the billionaire said in a severe tone, but he was smiling.
, Steve thinks. Long overdue, really; he sets his jaw for the blow.
“How bad is it?” he heard Tony ask.
and watch from afar. If Nebula succeeded in using the Space Stone, they’d come back and guard the other Stones until she returned. If she failed, they’d come back and bury what was left of her and wait for Thor’s friend to make a new Gauntlet, then hope Thor had better luck.
- yet they were all fighting to their limits, every single second treading the edge between victory and disaster.
Steve felt a stab of need so strong his whole groin ached. “Yes,” he answered, voice rough.
Once they had secured their own version of the Gauntlet and had set a reasonable date for the assault on Titan, the team had allowed themselves one long day to argue over who should take the risk of wielding it once they successfully retrieve the Infinity Stones. Rocket’s past experience with the Power Stone had convinced Tony to back Thor as the only possible candidate until Nebula silenced them all with a powerful speech listing everything Thanos had done to her over the years. It was agreed then that she had the right to attempt the Gauntlet first, with Thor on standby if it proved too dangerous for the android. Thankfully, Steve had quit trying to volunteer by that point. Super-serum or not, there was zero chance Tony was letting him anywhere near that thing.
That had never been unusual for routine Avengers meetings, and these past two years Stark’s absence was almost expected. Yet nothing about today’s meeting was routine.
Tony stared around the room, both seeking and loathing the unspoken agreement he saw on everyone’s faces. “Maybe we really can take out Thanos. Maybe. But what about the next guy? And the next? And the ten guys after that?”
However, Tony had learned to steer clear of the siblings’ comfortable bickering, so when his nano-display alerted him of an incoming call, he was happy for the excuse to dodge into an empty side-room.
The sharp intake of breath by his ear shocked Steve’s brain into something like alertness, knocked him right out of the drift and back into his body; every part of him scrambling to take it back. Danger. Wrong. “Wait, no, no, don’t answer that,” Steve said desperately, trying to dispel the sudden tension he felt in Tony’s arms and body. “That’s not… It’s not a fair question, I shouldn’t have… You’re alive, you’ve always been so alive and I’m- it’s not- no, stop, don’t worry about it.”
Steve wondered, swamped by a fresh angle of panic.
Steve thought.
“Thanks for…” Steve gestures at the flowers.
With a rasping swish, the glass door slid open and Helen Cho stepped into the isolation room, face sombre behind her visor. “Captain Rogers,” she said, bad news ringing through her voice. “Steve.”
It was really over, Tony realized. Thanos was dead.
Two ships, Stark relayed, instantly reverting to his professional cool. One heading for Wakanda, the other about to rock up at the Sanctum’s door.
Steve shrugs. Not his problem, for once. “He knows where to look.”
The first hints of early summer dawn was already brightening the room. With Steve now stable in recovery, the New York team decided it would be best to go back to the Sanctum and rest up before the next attack. Despite his own lack of fatigue, Tony judged this a good move, and had even made up his mind to leave with them, but right as Wong began opening the portal, Wilson announced his intention to stay behind until Steve woke up.
“In that case,” Steve said, sounding calm in an offensively successful way, “carry on.” Then the man had the nerve to lay back and smirk at him, so naturally Tony had to spend a minute or two kissing him long and slow because apparently he did have the fluid capacity to run his dick and his heart at the same time. Who knew.
Steve went still. “I’m sorry too. For Pepper, and Happy.”
and even Steve holding him tight doesn’t make it stop, he can’t stop, it won’t
Tight.
“How long do I have?” Steve heard himself ask, his voice cold and flat.
“So you’ll be staying in New York?” Wanda blurted out, an odd expression on her face.
With that, Ty hung up; Tony stared at the phone, foreboding twisting in his gut.
This was it.
Vormir turned out to be a morbid slump of a planet, seemingly perched on the perpetual edge of twilight. The land was a maze of shallow puddles between dunes of black sand, the sky above eerily lit by an eclipse stuck on the brink of totality. Luckily, it had human compatible air so Tony and Steve could throw the breathers back through the portal before Nebula closed it.
“Huh?” Tony said, confused, then appalled. “No, Steve,
“Boss, you have eighty-seven missed calls-” Friday began; with a dull shiver, Tony muted her, then slid down the wall to wait out the dizziness. His thoughts were getting fuzzy again, the first promise of a headache gathering behind his eyeballs, but he couldn’t rest when he still had a job to do. He could see into Steve’s room from here, well enough to see the man was still unconscious; Tony
“And who’d we lose?” Tony asked, as if this whole conversation hadn’t been leading up to that question, this moment.
But Tony looked confused. “What? Why?”
“The Stones,” he says.
But the other man wouldn’t look at him. “I have to,” he whispered. “I have to, Steve, you don’t understand-”
The mingled pleasure and pain drove Steve’s mind further into ecstatic incoherence;
The android frowned, tried again. “Can you stand?”
“So what, you see me without the serum for one minute and you’re already thinking wow, poor tiny Steve, it’s cute how he tries to be brave but now I know how he’s so pathetic really-”
“-I let you go off alone for
“Why thank you, Mr Odinson,” May said, smiling up at the Asgardian, a certain twinkle in her eye suggesting she’d taken note of his enthusiasm. While May leaned over to give Tony then Steve a quick kiss on the head, Thor managed to pick Peter up; there was one accidental introduction of the kid’s head to a stray wall, but under May’s supervision, they left without further incident.
And so Tony said nothing, did nothing, tried his best to feel nothing. Instead he sat still in endless sinking exhaustion, trying to keep his breath steady, trying to pay attention as the others argued back and forth about strategies and deployments.
It took Tony a long moment to manage a reply, which sounded a bit like, “hhnrgh?”
After Wanda and Vision had volunteered to take their off-world allies back to the Compound, the remnants of the team had settled into the waiting room, too battle-sapped to move. Considering six hours ago he’d died, then an hour ago he’d woken up semi-clothed in a hospital bed amid a choir of shrieking nurses, Steve didn’t mind staying put for a while. Apparently, his attempted resurrection had been initially judged a failure, so as a sign of respect, some of the staff had taken it upon themselves to clean and dress the body. Alerted by the screams, Peter had tried to fill him in on everything he’d missed, but Steve had flung on a shirt and insisted they find Tony instead.
And yet… Tony hadn’t mentioned her. Hadn’t really talked about what they were doing at all. He’d just followed Steve back to his room that first night and crawled into his bed like it was routine behavior. And after a few nights, it was. At the time, Steve was slow to question it, content to savor every second he got to spend with Tony after such a long and bitter separation. But as days turned to weeks, he felt more and more as if there was something hanging over him, something vast and hidden and unspoken between them, and it loomed larger every day.
And Steve was
“Goddamn it, just
“Don’t worry about it.” It was kinda heavy, but he could handle it.
Rhodey eyed him, clearly surprised but going with it. “Hey, I’m always happy to visit Wakanda.”
The ship’s ramp was lowering, and Tony squinted against the harsh noon sunlight. Time to find out who else he’d lost. It felt like the worst kind of Christmas, he could almost laugh. Then the ramp hit the ground and the gloomy ship was overrun - was that a raccoon? - and suddenly Rhodey - Jesus, Rhodey - was there and alive and wrapping his arms around Tony and there too was Nat and Bruce and Clint and then, somehow, Tony was laughing even as he was crying because out there on Titan he’d had dreams where he came home to find nothing but dust and instead somehow, even now, he had people.
“Good, because that was some intense cuddle action. Like what are you, part koala?”
Nebula caught Tony looking and raised her chin haughtily, as if to deny her own sorrow. “Rocket is one of the Guardians, like Gamora and Quill,” the android explained. Then she stared at the raccoon, as if seeing him for the first time. “I suppose he is now the last.” Rocket moaned softly, his anguish at the news wrenching to witness.
The attack on New York had come as a weird relief. After all, punching was punching. And the Avengers Initiative had given Steve something manageable to focus on. Fighting was both familiar and a way to be useful again. At least on the battlefield, he could be sure and strong. For everything else… Well, if he missed something, these days there was usually someone around to set him straight.
“I want to stay,” he said.
Almost.
Bucky blinked up at him. “Would it…? Yes,” he said faintly, then stronger. “Yes.”
“That, we have established,” Tony agreed. He was still staring at the floor, his jaw clenched.
Yet the man he saw wore the blank face of a stranger, an impostor with ice in his eyes.
In the following months, they take down Hydra. They neutralize the Mandarin. They defend London, and when Loki returns to wreak havoc, they are ready.
“Can’t blame a guy for having dreams,” he said, tossing his head airily, then he yelped as Steve stood, lifting the other man easily in his arms.
After a slight pause, the other man began to roll his hips, the deliberate movements eliciting further sobbing cries from Tony which this time Steve resolutely ignored. Once Tony was clearly settled around him, Steve withdrew almost the full way before sliding home, again, then again, his thrusts deep but still so tender, still so restrained.
“No,” he says. “I don’t think I will.”
Then he was cold.
Driven to fury by the loss of Loki, Thor traveled from Nowhere to Nidalvallir in search of a weapon worthy of vengeance, accompanied by Rocket and Groot. The Valkyrie and the remaining Guardians set off for Earth as quickly as they could, but the message they sent ahead, warning that Thanos now possessed the Space Stone, arrived ten minutes too late.
“Ship’s here,” Shuri called, and the group began to follow her out of the lab; only Tony, Nat and Rhodey lingered.
They walked back to the Sanctum together, slow and silent as a funeral.
Then Shuri, Rocket and Tony were off, arguing back and forth about something quantum and complicated. Steve didn’t like Thor’s expression and gently steered him into a chair, resting his hand on the Asgardian’s shoulder. Time was, he wouldn’t have dared presume, but small affectionate gestures meant a lot these days, he was learning. Steve tried to follow the rapid debate but was lost as ever until Tony eventually took pity on him, slowing down enough to explain the basics.
for your bullshit right now-”
Tony looked up at him, eyes blazing behind the plastic visor, courage and fear entwined. “That night… it meant a lot, okay? I just… I didn’t expect it, any of it. The whole thing felt like a dream… but I fucked it up so it didn’t matter what you thought of me, it was easier to let you believe whatever you wanted-” The other man broke off, shaking his head; Steve squeezed his hand in support.
He sniffed, wiping at his cheeks, and sat up straight, forcing himself to meet Tony’s silent gaze.
“And Gamora?” the android asked, her tone carefully neutral.
Dazzled, Tony grasped after sense, but when the hovering doctors made no move to intervene, he saw no possible refusal.
Eventually, they left him clean and soft, his heart beating quiet and slow.
He hated it.
Steve frowned. Sure, he liked to draw flowers, but most plants were just plants to him. Even the glowing purple ones. “I’m not familiar with it, no,” he answered.
Steve lives in a haunted house, he thought.
Part of a deep hidden canyon lay spread before them, two wide and shallow rivers plummeting over the cliffs at each end. The falls of water were delicate, ethereal, spreading misty angel wings over the greenery far below. The sun sent glimmering rainbows playing around the edges. Steve stood and stared, all eyeballs, drinking in the sight as though he could swallow it whole.
it would be better if he stayed far away. It always was. Yet he could still feel the nurses watching, their well-meaning concern eating through him like acid.
“You threw yourself off a cliff and died,” Rhodey said. “I’m so mad at you I could kill you myself.” Hearing the pain that lay under his best friend’s words, Tony could only sigh. It felt like being sorry was just his natural state now. These days he hurt people as easily as he breathed.
Tony felt his blood freeze. “You know me?” Despite his galloping heart-rate, his own voice sounded casual, even bored, but he was glad to note Wong and Rogers appearing at his back.
It made sense, as far as Steve could tell. “Okay,” he said. “And then what?”
Steve sank back, at a loss for how to respond, because absolutely none of what Tony had just said was true.
Tony crossed his arms and leaned against the nearest side table. “Oh yeah?” he said, trying to summon the energy to play along. “How good?”
, that Steve fell into the most undignified giggles. He should be freaking out, he knew, but somehow, with Tony in his arms, he felt both rock steady and infinitely delirious. For a second Tony just watched him laugh, grinning slightly, then thoroughly put an end to his distraction by claiming Steve’s mouth again. Then, with a magician’s ease, he slipped a deft hand into Steve’s pants and-
.” And he whipped his arm towards Rogers, the red gem blazing.
There was a pause. “So I see. Apologies for my indiscretion, Stark. You may be heartened to hear that I have brought mighty reinforcements to bolster your planet’s defenses, including a Valkyrie of legend, Heimdall the All-Seeing and a certain blue cube you may remember. Uh. Plus a few others who can fight and stuff, may be of use. But in exchange for this assistance, I would ask that Earth grant refuge to the rest of my people, for most on this ship are no warriors. They are farmers and craftsfolk, scholars and healers, children and families, peaceful souls who lost all but their lives in the destruction of Asgard.”
out into orbit to test their recent modifications. Rocket offered to accompany her but the android rebuffed him and stalked out alone in her customary abrupt way. Instead, Thor invited the raccoon to join him on an excursion, something about Norway. After checking in with Tony, Rhodey offered to pilot for the two off-worlders; he’d always wanted to see the Northern Lights but had never found the time. Surprisingly, given his dislike of planes, Bruce chose to accompany them. Although maybe Tony shouldn’t have been surprised. He and Thor had forged a strong connection during their time in space, and were rarely found far from each other these days.
He is dizzy. Drowning. If all things are possible, then… He stares up at the sky, streaks of fire in the distance. New York is burning. Somewhere, a nuke is being prepped for launch. He could stop it. He could stop all of it.
. He came here before. Did you meet him?” Nebula demanded.
As if he’d never met the man. “It started when I landed,” Tony said.
Under that thought, he broke. Sam caught him just in time to lower him to the floor, then Tony was kneeling before him, and Steve buried his face in Tony’s neck and clung tight, trying to hide, his whole body shaking. Hide from the eyes. Always eyes. Watching, needing, seeking, feeding. Even good, even friends. “Easy, Steve, easy,” Tony was whispering, soothing. Always the one holding him together. The only one who might let him fall apart. Broken, wrong, nothing, gone…
“Sure, yeah, by today’s standards,” Steve countered. “But back then I spent half my childhood sick in bed, not knowing if I would even wake up the next morning.” Years of memories, years of frustration. “Always standing on the sidelines, watching other people live their lives without me.” Choking on jealousy. Yelling at his mother, the only person he could reach. Witnessing her exhaustion. Then, the shame.
They had just reached a narrow part of the trail when Steve signaled for them all to halt. Nebula did not notice or care, and kept walking. A shadow floated oddly into her path, and as Steve leapt forward, shield high, Tony aimed his repulsor at the overhang above, ready to bury whatever it was at the first sign of threat. Nebula finally stopped but just raised her fist, the soft glow of the Space Stone erupting into dazzling brilliance.
Still off-balance, it took Tony a moment to comprehend where Steve was going, but as the realization hit, he followed with terrified haste, arriving just as Steve finished smashing through the steel door to reveal a terrified-looking Ty-
God, the warmth he had once felt in those arms-
“I’m not sure he needs an answer anymore,” Tony said.
…and then Clint is close to the edge, too close and he’s saying goodbye and neither of them can get to him in time, he falls and the light flares and when they wake up Nat is holding the Soul Stone and sobbing, the gem Steve had carried nowhere to be seen. He walks her to the ship where she kisses him goodbye, dry and dusty on the cheek, and she’s already grim with all the grief that is to come yet still resolute, still strong, and he cries again when she leaves because it will never be him that she comes home to, never again his Nat who comes home.
“Steve’s fetching water,” the scientist told him, a slight smile of apology for making him jump. “Figured he might need some help.”
He turned around, wanting Steve to be the last thing he saw. “Bring them home, Cap,” he said.
Thanos glanced at Gamora, then looked up at the Soul Stone. “My life has no further purpose. It may yet have value. Please,” he said. “If you can. Let her life be restored. Take mine, for the balance.”
“Helluva day,” his friend said eventually.
Nothing woke.
“It’s the truth, Tony,” Steve insisted. “And you can come back to us whenever you want. Ask us for anything you need. We’re still on your team, no matter what, I promise.”
She gave him a withering look. “Please. If you’re going to steal my boyfriend, I think you can at least call me Pepper,” she said; nearby, Sam choked on his drink.
The Captain answered. “No.” Steve answered. “Yes.”
Nobody argued, which was in itself a worrying sign. Yet Tony had to admit it was kinda nice watching the team relax and chat over breakfast instead of hurrying off to their endless duties. Even Shuri joined them for a while, quickly approving the change in plan and even offering stealth transport to anywhere in the world. Clint and Nat were the first to take up the Queen’s offer, wishing to visit the farm, with Okoye volunteering to fly them. She and Nat had become close friends through their many weeks running the night shift, and from what Tony understood things were still strained between the General and her exiled husband, so likely Okoye preferred the distraction.
and so he freezes, just a second too long; Tony’s eyes go wider than he’s ever seen them as he and the others realize who exactly had paid the price for the future this Steve had left behind.
Taken altogether, it was more good news than Tony could handle. More reward than he could ever deserve. It was a mistake, he knew, to take so much more than his due, but he didn’t know how to give it back. Maybe it wouldn’t matter. All he could do was enjoy this one golden moment, treasure it and tuck its memory away for future, duller days, because that much he did know. Happiness was not sustainable. Sooner or later, the debt would come due.
The super-soldier shook his head, staring at the Stones as if mesmerized. “I can’t do that, Tony.”
“You don’t have to do this, you know,” she whispered, her eyes steady on his. “I can sit with Captain Rogers.”
he thought giddily,
Steve closed his eyes. “There was a schoolbus,” he murmured. Then he touched the Power Stone, and in a torrent of purple energy, half the palace exploded.
. Tony would have liked to be grateful, but the absence left him echoing with uneasy anticipation. He tried to drown out the disquiet by laughing louder, chattering harder, to apparent success.
After unhooking his machines, they rolled him out of the room, the blurred corridors sliding by in a maze of endless ceilings.
The gem Strange had sworn to protect. The gem he’d given up in exchange for Tony’s life. No other way. Tony shuddered. “Yeah.”
. Where once he had seen only Steve’s arrogance, Tony now found traces of desperation. Underneath Steve’s scorn, he could see hints of anxiety, even insecurity. With growing self-loathing, Tony traced the strange new echoes down through the years, discovering how Steve’s perpetual confidence had so often rung hollow with vulnerability, and doubt, and fear.
It should have been an occasion for celebration; they had, after all, successfully acquired the ability to go back and save the universe. Once they had all returned to Wakanda, Shuri had announced their pending salvation to her people and ordered the palace staff to break into the last of the fresh rations for this one night. Tony could hear the revelry going on in the city outside, could appreciate the relief that followed hope.
“Steve, I’m not going to argue with your reasons,” Tony said slowly. “I trust they were good. But I still wish I’d known. Honestly, for years I didn’t think you even liked me as a friend.”
“That
“I don’t think relieved is the right word for this feeling,” Pepper said. “That makes it sound like loving you was a duty. It never was that, Tony.” She hesitated. “But there is a certain comfort in knowing it’s over.” She pierced him with a stare, steel always, under the sunshine. “Maybe because I’m not that surprised. You and Steve… I’ve always felt there was something pulling you away. I thought it was the job you couldn’t quit. But now...”
The exhaustion would spread. The cold would take him.
“Contrary to the legend, it turns out sweet Anthony is
“Yeah,” Steve agreed. “Yeah.” But he didn’t move until the full minute was up, and neither did Tony.
And it had
bitch-
Steve back to the ‘40s?” Tony asks, sharp and suspicious but
“Alright,” Rogers announced as he stood up, the others as usual springing to attention at his every twitch. “I’ll keep a full team with me in New York to protect the Time Stone. Everyone else will head to Wakanda to work on the Mind Stone and coordinate the planetary defenses. Thor will use the Space Stone to bring us the Reality Stone. By the time he returns, we will hopefully have a way to neutralize these things.”
The Captain used whatever shield he could.
The room wasn’t far; he walked in and stopped. The room was unchanged, the room was changed. Not like the last time. Just like last time.
Rhodey sighed, resigned. “Tony, he’s not… himself right now.”
“Okay,” Steve said.
“Steve?” Tony asked, unsure if he was even awake.
A sleepy-eyed Bruce appeared at the door to the lab. “Hey, I think there’s a meeting? You guys coming?”
A shadow falls across him. “Feel like company?”
Just before the call connected, Tony grabbed for Steve’s hand. The other man squeezed back gently.
No one was there.
The super-soldier had retrieved his pencil and resumed drawing. “I know. I heard you.”
Silence. “You alone?”
“I…” the android trailed off. “I feel… something.” She clenched her fist and the Space Stone emitted a faint blue glow in response, the color traveling up her arm in short pulses, its energy diffusing under her synthetic skin. The effect would be pretty, if it weren’t so terrifying to think of the damage such power would do to an organic body.
-and Steve was
“From that very first day in Hawaii,” Ty said, cruel and smug. “Two years ago exactly, which makes this our anniversary, I suppose.” He laughed. “Kudos where it’s due for all that noble suffering. You lasted so much longer than I expected.”
“How can you know where your toe is if it’s hidden in a shoe?” Nebula countered, then shook her head. “Inaccurate, but the sensation is comparable. Further explanation is redundant.” And she stormed through the portal as if embarrassed.
, please, come back, don’t do this,
Tony stared at the wall, trying to school his expression into neutral. “Not a problem. I stopped drinking a while back, another month and I’ll be fine.”
But then he gives Steve a soft smile, brighter than any sun in any sky.
The Soul Stone tilted her head to one side and pointed to Tony. “Actually, he saved you. Once there were two souls in play, I had enough leverage to protect you both. But without his actions, I could not have intervened.”
Nebula was in place behind Steve; the super-soldier was still too stunned to move. “But… Thor,” Steve managed, yet Tony was already shaking his head.
The super-soldier swayed on his feet. “I have to… I have to go back. Have to fix this.”
The billionaire tried to shrug without letting go of Steve, then growled when he failed, which provoked further interesting sensations. “Better than anything we’ve got so far. Worth an assessment, at least. If it’s too risky, we can still go the quantum route. But Steve, honestly?” His voice shook slightly. “Right now we’re at a dead end. If that’s the route to salvation, we’re looking at years.”
How could he not? It’d been broken often enough. And each time felt like the worst time, until the next time. As a kid, losing faith in his parents’ love, then losing them completely. As an adult, learning how deeply his life’s work had harmed the world, then learning why. As an Avenger, being considered a liability, then proving himself one. He’d thought Germany had to be his ultimate low, from his decision to recruit a literal child right through to watching Rhodey fall from the sky. All because he’d placed too much faith in a friendship he’d desperately chased, one he’d never really thought he deserved but tried to live up to anyway.
One hour and seventeen minutes too late.
Official time of death was recorded as 22:43.
Steve studied the other man, still hoping for a sign he was wrong, but in his heart he felt the truth, could trace its awful shape down through his memories of the past two years, in the way Tony was trying to hide his face, even now. He knew he had no right to the answer, but Steve had to ask. “He hurts you?”
Tony thought, a sudden blast of golden joy enveloping him. “Did you just confuse Katniss and Captain
Time passed, people said goodbye.
Steve felt the hot humiliating sting of tears but clenched his jaw against their release, desperately ordering himself to hold it together, at least until he was alone.
Steve stopped abruptly, surprising the former medic. “There’s something wrong with me,” he told him; fast, before the words could melt away again. Broken, wrong, nothing, gone…
Which may have been a mistake, because next thing he knew, Steve was sitting up and was holding Tony’s head between his hands, keeping his mouth away from Steve’s body. “Please tell me that’s not… Is that all this is, Tony?” Steve asked, and Tony could have wept at the shuttered look on his face.
. He’d only kissed Tony because… Steve frowned, mind racing. Because… Tony had just told him they were done, and… it felt like Steve was losing him forever. Like how he’d just lost Peggy, for the second, final time. But the first time, he’d kissed her to say goodbye, so… Somehow, he got his wires crossed.
And at that precise moment, his empty stomach gurgled like a chorus of operatic frogs, and Steve fell into a fit of giggles.
This time, some part of Tony was aware when they came to take him away. This time, he didn’t fight. Their hands were gentle, and by now the body was cold.
