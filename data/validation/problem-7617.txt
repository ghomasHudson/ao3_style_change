As all best laid plans go though, a new villain drops by two days later to mess everything up. Steve sees very little of both Tony and Iron Man, only managing a small chat with the former as they crossed paths in the elevator. Iron Man finally shows up for a sparring session, but that is the only time he sees the metal man before the Avengers alarm startles him out of sketching alone on his floor.
Before bed on the first day he found a sock under the couch, some thin and silky thing that looked more expensive than anything he ever wanted to own. The afternoon of the second had him looking through his nightstand for one of the bookmarks Iron Man bought him only to find a tattered and dog eared paperback. It looked vaguely familiar, but he could say with absolute certainty he did not put it in there. There is a set of miniature screwdrivers left half open and discarded in one of the kitchen drawers and two coffee mugs he’s never seen before in the cabinet above the sink.
“You don’t even wear a hat, Cap.” He shakes his head and really considers finally giving into the call of the scotch. His thumb spasms a bit on the lip of the glass and he turns to Steve, tilting it a bit towards him. “Care to find out?”
Steve smirks a little at that and something heated flares into view on his face. Tony can’t seem to look away from those eyes, not that he wants to at all, so he walks the rest of the way to the door and following elevator backwards.
“Okay.” Steve tells him and his smile grows brighter, warmer. All the tension in Tony’s body just let’s go at that smile, all the embarrassment and uncertainty collapses under the weight. Then Steve steps forward and dips down to press a kiss on the tip of Tony’s nose. It flairs bright in his chest and Tony’s face splits open in a grin he’s sure looks a little dopey.
“Well I’m glad you all could make it to my spontaneous little homecoming party.” He begins and lets all their fake little chuckles wash over him as he smiles bright and completely in command. “I wish I could say I had a lovely vacation, but it turns out being totally off grid does not really agree with me.” The chuckles continue because Tony can play an audience like a goddamn fiddle. For a moment he lets them alone to their amusement, then he breathes deep and leans forward on the stand with clasped hands. Just as the silence starts to creep into uncomfortable, he speaks again. “I was held captive by men using the weapons I myself designed.” A shocked hush descends over the room and Tony relishes their predictability without so much as shifting in his stance. “I watched young Americans killed trying to defend me from these same weapons. From things I created to protect them. I saw just how badly Stark Industries has failed at accountability, how much I let myself become part of pretending the problem does not exist.” The murmuring is starting to pick up again and he can see a few of the bolder ones leaning forward at the ready to shout out questions. He stands at his full height. “Stark Industries will no longer pay party to this kind of intentional disregard. Until further notice and effective immediately, the weapons manufacturing division of Stark International is shutting down. There will be no questions.”
“Not here. S.I.” His eyes widen, but there is still no surprise, more relief and possibly... vindication?
And you can have my heart
For the first several nights in this loop, he’d scribbled out page after page under the fading light of cooling embers. Eight year old memories, though sharpened by the location, are only so clear and he couldn’t let his advantage go wasted by the warping of time and human recollection. Originally, he only meant to focus on the movements and dates of his captivity, but late at night under the weight of the earth and his own mistakes, everything feels urgent. So on top of secretly building weaponized armor, he tasks himself with protecting a thick stack of smudging parchment. Risks losing a physical record of every name, date, time and location of any important thing that is and will be in his life.
“Yes, I think we just might.” Yinsen admits eventually, quiet and sincere, and he does not have the same hesitation for looking at his companion. Tony repays that courtesy and meets the man’s eyes firmly.
He’s still trying to tamp down on the urge to ask Steve to keep doing this with him forever, when he feels fingers brush along the line of his cheek. Steve is still supporting himself on both elbows, so he can only manage a light swipe with his finger tips. It burns all along Tony’s face all the same, takes up every shred of his focus.
They fucking did it. He fucking did it. He got them both out! His laugh may be approaching manic, but even under all the heavy leather and scorching sun he feels cool and buoyant.
“No, don’t get up yet. Just, stay.” Tony whines, shaking his head quickly back and forth. Grinning crookedly down at him Steve gives into the request and settles down so Tony can only just breathe in under the weight.
“Fine.” He’s not as good at keeping back the emotions in his voice and the dull edge of it still sticks into her side as she steps out of the workshop. The scales are forgotten and it’s not until long after all his other secrets finally come spilling out that she ever sees them again. They never do take the plunge, but years later she looks back and doesn’t regret much.
Then he adds on all the weird games his mind’s been playing on him the last few weeks and it all tumbles into a horrible twisting mess. There are too many things to process, too many uncertainties. He needs to pick something he can work on, something to focus on before he crumbles under the weight of it all. It feels too much like waking up to an unfamiliar future, too much like being completely alone and haunted by things recent in his mind but really long past.
Tony asks him to pick a car and Steve points to the Audi immediately. The seats are deep and Steve knows they’ll be enough leg room for him to feel comfortable. Plus this one has heated seats and it may only be october, but that is a luxury he really appreciates about the future.
“I won’t leave him out there.” He says firmly, to himself and to the gauntlet he just slammed into the crumbling wall beside him. Nothing on earth is going to stop him from getting Steve out of here. The ice can’t have him a second time.
“Tony, I’m sorry.” Steve beggs, rubbing his nose deeper into Tony’s hair. He smells like his expensive styling gel and the sandalwood soap Steve got him to start using. “I’m so sorry sweetheart.”
Steve looks up from his sketch to check the lines of Tony’s nose in profile only to find Tony staring straight at him. It freezes him in place and he lets the sketchbook and pencil slide down into his lap.
“No.” Tony responds seriously and looks up at her with a proud little smile.
“You’re different.” Steve finally finishes with, taking a long swallow of his juice to keep from expanding on that sentiment. It seems like an especially good decision when he realizes Stark is looking at him with wide and outrageously hopeful eyes. It makes him both want to run from the room and open his mouth to say something profound, something worthy of that gaze. Of course, because he really wasn’t kidding when he told Stark he is terrible at talking to people, he decides to ruin the mood instead. “Besides, I remember mucking it up well enough at first.”
New chapter :3
"He doesn’t know if he’s my Alpha." Interrupted Steve, calmly. "I know."
It’s on Tony’s file that he’s a playboy with no desire to find a mate… and he wants to mate with me.
Suddenly, the roses stop being so import. They started weighting more and more… so I let them fall on floor, as I reach for Tony and hugged him tightly.
Shattered.
“Yes, or no?” I ask desperately.
“Congratulation.” He brought himself to say. “Last year of high school?”
I try to look at Bucky, but both his image and voice start to fade, as I think:
I’m starting to wonder if I’m a fail as an Alpha.
I thought he was dead…
“What?” She yelled.
“Just spit it.” She said with her arms as crossed as she was.
Hope was restored… or so I thought, before meeting Mr. Howard Stark.
I had never had a proper image of something, or someone, in mind while masturbating.
I kept going. As I got closer to his room I felt the pheromones emaning from there. Steve was in Heat, alright, and I could help the suddent bonner in my pants, as I felt the amazing scent from his arousal.
The lips were Steve’s lips!
“I looked so bad.” He says chuckling, with tears stuck on his eyes. “It’s weird, because I don’t even remember taking this photo anymore.”
“I’m going to his house!” Declared Tony, interrupting his CEO.
Before she could start talking Tony heard the front door from that house opening.
“This man must either be a big deal inside Stark Industries, really rich, or be really into you. That’s like, as expensive as your house, Steve”
And, finally, I got the biggest bouquet of red roses I could carry, and went to see my amazing Omega. And he accepted my courting, above all that!
So, it took me a while, 'cause I dind't feel like M-Preg, and my brother wanted me to do it, but it feels right this way, so: NO M-PREG.
There were a few moments were Tony felt like an idiot.
Will be posting the 7th Chapter at the beggining of next week.
I could hear the gasping and small whispering being exchanged between Pepper and Bruce.
As we get closer to the gym I can feel myself felling antsy. There’s some sort of… I don’t know… some something I can’t quite put my finger on that got me feeling stressed out.
“It’s nothing.” Steve answered.
Of course there had been cases of Alphas getting it wrong, but it was very rare.
“It was just a mistake. I know.”
When he had finished mental slapping himself, he noticed he had unconsciously got closer to the young man, and was now peeking at a very realistic drawing of the bird on the window.
Anthony Stark hated ceremonies, but much more, ceremonies in his honor. That’s why, after Pepper pushed him into making a donation to S.H.I.E.L.D. (a military school); and after she organized the event; and after she made sure to make it happened on the 4th of July (because military school, really?); and after he came all the way from his penthouse… he decided to hide in the only unlooked room he could find.
Interesting, Stark thought…
“No. I had to hold back a year because of a surgery.” Said the boy with a sad look on his eyes.
I hope I’m not preventing Steve from finding love. But above that, I hope Steve can never find love in anyone but me… even if we’re not really mates.
What am I going to do?
"Does this means we can still be friends?"  He asks, still wrapped in my arms.
He could make this work for him.
“So, I have to get going. Mr. Stark’s my ride, and his CEO and him are already wanting, so…”
No other person ever made me feel the way that man did.
The kid seems pretty talented, and his wings were being cut off because of the pricey education system.
Could she be saying what I think she’s saying?
“Steve. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Just give me a chance to explain, okay? I promise it wasn’t what you’re thinking. I’m just so sorry, Steve.” He’s crying. “I’m sorry…”
“Why weren’t you at the ceremony?” She asked.
"I mean what I said. Now, are you going to wrestle me or what?" I joke, smiling, hoping to light up the mood.
“A what phone?” Asked the blonde confused, after only being able to understand the word ‘phone’.”
No way he’s getting close to my Omega,
“Maybe he’s just shy about calling.” He thought, already dialing the number on his own Stark Phone. “It’s turned off…” Tony said sadly, a few seconds after his phoning attempt.
What if that Alpha is Steve’s Alpha? The real one?
“Is everything okay, Steve?” Asked Peggy, while gulping down her second piece of cake.
“Then call him. He’s number is in there, isn’t it?” Retorted Bucky, smiling rather widely at Steve.
"Courting you, of course. I thought I made it clear that I wanted to court you…" He suddenly got very pale.  "Oh my God! I‘m so sorry. Of course you don’t want me to court you. I‘m so stupid. I’m so sorry… let’s just pretend I never said or did anything. Oh, God, I’m so sorry."
“What are you doing now?” Pepper asked, completely annoyed.
Today is my first interview with a possible family.
I spent three lovely months courting Steve, and I’m not going to have everything ruined by some other Alpha.
Steve seems really happy that Bucky is making progresses in the therapy.
True, that that tended to happen. And usually he was out and done.
Hope you readers enjoy it :)
I need to Tony to tell me everything is going to be alright!
Tomorrow, I’ll either die, or become a proper Omega.
"What if he finds his real mate?" I must have made the worst face possibly, because right after he asks that, he keeps talking, looking even more concerned. "You didn’t thought about that, did you?"
His scent!
Wait!
It’s been eight years since I’ve been adopted by the Tony Stark AKA Mr. Father and Steve Rogers-Stark AKA Mr. Dad, and I still haven’t brought myself to call them just ‘Father’ and ‘Dad’ without the politeness of the ‘Mr.’… so how will I bring myself to tell them I currently have two Alphas fighting for the right to court me?!
“Because you are Tony Stark, and there’s nothing strong enought…” I say brushing away his tears.
Hope you enjoy, if you do, leave kudos <3 so I'll know ;)
New chapter :3 YAY!
Her phone starts ringing. She looks worried as she looks from her phone and then to me.
Professor Erskine looks at me, waiting for my approval. I nod to him, as to tell him it’s okay. He leaves the room.
“Tony, he… aren’t you talking about the old photo in his walle?.”
“He hasn’t called yet! Why hasn’t he called yet?” Question Tony, rather hysterical, at Pepper.
According to my father’s journals, life wasn’t easy for him back in the days, and part of the guilt was on my father. It disgusts me the way he wrote about how he saved “Project Rebirth”, by convincing Omega Steve Rogers to put his life on the line.
Most people present between the ages of fourteen and sixteen, but by the time I turned eighteen I had not presented yet.
I haven’t seen Steve in two months and when he finally came back from his mission, he comes back with an Alpha.
“He sent you a gift! Open it!” Exclaimed Peggy.
It’s kind of agonizing.
I never asked my father about that man, but ‘till this day I have that photo.
I hope my (possible) new family doesn’t think I’m boring like Mr. Stark did.
Steve is the most amazing Omega I’ve ever met… And, for some reason, I’m starting to doubt myself. How could I ever thought someone else, but Steve, was my mate.
If you like my work, please leave kudos <3
Today I will be meeting Omega Steve Rogers – the one and only – Captain America.
I had some personal issues to take care of and then I got stricked with the worst writer's block ever!
As I entered the gym I’m overwhelmed with the most delicious scent… and view.
“Tony, calme down. There’s no need to call S.H.I.E.L.D., okay. He’s not in danger… Listen… He didn’t disappear… Listen! Tony! Listen to me! He with me, okay. He’s safe.” Suddenly she turns pale. “I can’t tell you where we are.”
Tony looked outside and there was a small blue bird outside the window. The brunette couldn’t help but think that the bird’s blue feathers were no match for that blonde’s beautiful blue eyes.
Was he being asked who he was? Him? The most famous man alive?
“I could be a reporter.”
I wanted to yell that man’s name, between my moans, but I didn’t know his name and ended up coming with an empty groan.
An old woman with wavy white hair answered the door.
“He used to have a phone when he was 11; for emergencies, you know. But he got robbed. Although that phone didn’t look nothing like this one you gave him, honey. The one he had was tiny and had a little cap. How’s your tea, by the way?”
His face light up.
Hell! I still carry that picture in my wallet ‘till this day, but…
Steve doesn’t deserve to be lead on by some indecisive Alpha!
“Way to put your foot in the whole, Stark.”  Thought the (not feeling like it anymore) genius. “Well… I happen to know that Mr. Stark it’s considering making the donation to the art program.” He said while texting Pepper to make the donation to the art program.
“Besides, you know I can’t cook for my life.” Laughed Bucky.
“Maybe…”
“That is how it will be with Peter.”
“Steve, it’s fine.” He said, noticing how the youngest went from embarrassed and stressed to relieved. “First of all, I’m sorry I couldn’t stop by on your birthday. Second, I should have given you a simpler model.”
“No more secrets between us.” Tony had said.
I felt his inside tighten more, as his eyes rolled to the back of his head, with his neck bared, and he came with my name between his lips.
I'M SO SORRY I'VE BEEN ABSENT FOR SO LONG!!!
He said he could do it himself without help, and I thought his lack of understand of sex dynamics was adorable and sinfully hot at the same time.
Being the only Omega doctor in the tower, he was the only one qualified to check what was wrong with Steve.
Suddenly the doorbell rang.
“What do you mean…”
And there it was, in his eyes; that look – like he wants to dissect me… and that look was replaced with disgust as I started crying.
-Tony POV-
- Peter POV -
“To stop me from keeping you happy.” He finishes, cleaning the remaining tears on his suit’s sleeve.
The odds of getting adopted are already so small… if they don’t like me I might never get adopted!
Stupid and selfish ideas came to Tony easily, and looking at those birds, he had the most stupid and selfish of ideas ever.
I had been in Steve’s room for 10 minutes and after a heavy make out session, I decided it was about time I took out his clothes.
Tony stopped for a minute.
But happiness comes short when you’re talking about me.
"No one ever gave me roses, or any flowers, much less an Alpha."
Only a fail of an Alpha wouldn’t be able to identify their mate…
As days go by, there seems to be no kind of love game going between them.
He said, right before he dived into certain death:
Just minutes after leaving S.H.I.E.L.D.’s facilities, I, for some wicked reason, opened my wallet.
Imagining that man there, with me, made everything more intense and much more pleasurable.
"What do you mean: you know?" Bucky asks me, after a few moments of silence, looking at me, with shock.
But when the invasion came, a biggest fear arose: the fear of losing Steve without letting him know he was mine.
She does.
“And cheaper!” He exclaimed.
“Please, Tony!” He cried out weakly, after a while of rimming. “More! Please..!”
I knew Stark’s father: Howard, and Howard was a horrible Alpha. And Tony? He’s might be worse… No. I’m being unfair. He’s not like Howard. Even though he made clear he doesn’t like me, he still gave me shelter, arranged me therapy and tries to befriend me… but still…
I put on my best (fake) smile, as I saw the door opening.
Suddenly, he comes in running through the door.
He did as told, after drying his tears in his sleeve.
“This is going to end so badly.” Pepper said leaving.
- Peter POV –
I’m really nervous, but above all, I’m scared…
“I didn’t see.” The blond said with a tear rolling down his face.
“Why do you even have a photo of me before the serum in your wallet?” There’s a pause, in which my brain is still trying to reboot. “Were you waiting for a chance to mock me?”
I wanted to say something like: “Are you stupid?”, or “I hate you!” or “Hi, I’m Steve.”, but nothing more than sobs came out.
“It’s my birthday. I turn 18 today, and grandma said I could have Peggy and Bucky coming over. Peggy and Bucky are my best friends.” Spoke the beautiful blond very happily.
“It was a special delivery.” Answered Steve with tiny tears in his eyes.
I’m a mutant, and it’s very rare for mutants to get adopted. Plus I’m already 10 years old, what makes it even harder to get adopted, ‘cause everyone wants a normal baby, not a 10 year old mutant.
I know I shouldn’t be judging him by his father’s actions, but… but, what if he actually felt disgusted by my crying?
If he has a personality, I’m sold!
“Steve.” I started. “I love you, you know that. The bite…”
“His name is Peter.” Tony said, looking at Peter’s file.
… I’m not sure if the smile on my face it’s still on.
I thought Tony would end up being the same as his father… God, I knew his father… I’m so old now… so out of date… so I thought, maybe, if I hated him from the start it would be easier. But it end up being harder.
I just… I want a family so much.
Of course I cried.
(Please forgive me for taking so long...)
He was shouting, and I wasn’t being able to process all the information… Steve was that man?
“They’re the couple that wants to adopt you.”
And I became confused… and, even though I’ll never admit it… I felt scared.
What’s an Alpha supposed to do in this kind of situation… but to fuck his Omega sensless?!
His Alpha friend, Bucky, had finally accepted to go to therapy, because he was going feral… seriously, this guy is dangerous for Steve… but is also the onl friends Steve has, aside from the avengers – a last reminder of his previous “life”. I can’t just break them apart out of jealousy.
“Did you show the other avengers?” He was crying.
"Professor, I think I know what’s going on. May I have a moment, alone, with Steve?"
He just nodded, still too scared.
My Omega?
No one has two mates…
Had he passed out?
The little noises escaping his mouth were drivivng me crazy. It was so sweet it sexy. In overall it was madning.
I knew Bucky was right, but I couldn’t let Steve suffering in a Heat. I was going to do everything to make sure he felt nothing but pleasure and joy in this state. Just had to be careful not to bite him, and everything would be fine.
Steve looked complitly drugged in bliss. He had his eyes half closed, his mouth was slightly opened with a little strain of drowl going down his chin. He was breathing was uneven and his blonde locks were messy. He was sweeting heavly. He was a truly a vision.
“You do?”
“I figured that much, since you’re not a teacher.”
“You won’t be good at being a father…” I agreed. “You’ll be extraordinary!” I finish.
I can’t help it, but to feel angry.
After a few moments, Tony decides to break the silence:
"Then, how can you let him do this to you?"
Then I had to wait a week for the S.H.I.E.L.D.’s doctors to allow me to visit Steve. They said he had been exposed to extreme stress. Agent even tried to make me feel guilty… it may seem wrong, but I felt pride in knowing that my absence had caused such an impact in my mate, even without having him know that he’s destined for me.
Apparently, yes, since his face lit up right after Tony’s words. A big smile adorned his face.
It really infuriates me what my father did to this Omega!
“I don’t think so… but don’t tell Mrs. Gonzalves I said that.” He said smiling openly.
“You don’t know if he’s really your Omega!” Yelled Bucky from behind me.
… And I didn‘t noticed.
Wait…
“I know, Tony.” I said smilying at him.
"Not offended at all."  He says, but I can feel his eyes pierce holes through me.
She looked at him suspicious.
Everything, now, in that man reminded me of Steve, because it was Steve!!!
I thought that if I joined the army, and helped in the war, maybe an Alpha would see me with respect, and we would devote our lives to each other.
Hope everyone likes it :3 And don't forget to leave kudos <3
“My Omega called for me. That’s what you said, right, Bucky. I’m gonna make sure he’s okay.” I said, feeling very close to baring him my teeth, and then moving on in Steve’s room direction.
“Are you hiding from the crowd too?” He didn’t answered, so the guy continued.  “Don’t’ worry, I don’t like crowds either… isn’t it nice they left the art studio unlocked?”  More silence.  “Sorry, you probably don’t want to hear me talking. I’ll just be over there.”
“What if I’m not good at being a father.” He interrupted.
It’s been a weak since then.
"Since when did you know?"
Was he okay?
This Alpha is, apparently one of Steve’s old pals from back in the days, who was brain washed to kill him, blah blah blah Steve saved him blah blah blah they come back blah blah blah and now there’s another Alpha in my territory, spending time with MY Omega!
… Maybe not…
“Because Steve doesn’t know who I am, and I kind lied, and took advantage of it. Oh, and it make sure it is delivered today, before his birthday is finished, please. Bye, Pepper. Love you.” He said leaving the office, and leaving alone before she could ask any more questions.
“So we’re clear, that photo… the reason he wasn’t sure I was his mate, was because he thinks the man in there was his mate?” I ask scared, as if my life, my whole living propose depended on her answer.
But every time I tried enlisting for the army, I got turned down… that was, until Professor Abraham Erskine said that he wanted me for his “Project Rebirth”.
“So did I, Pepper. So did I.” He lied, dramatically, back at her.
“Just have it delivered with this card to the address that I’m texting you as we speak.” He said pushing the card onto the CEO’s hands.
“Oh, my God, Steve! That’s a Mark XLVIII Stark Phone ” Yelled Peggy, exited.
“Just because I’m me.” Tears already going down his cheeks.
Before I could do anything Steve had squelch the photo, threw it at me and ran out of the room crying.
We talked about our insecurities, fears and most of our dreams…
I'M SO SORRY I'VE BEEN AWAY FOR SO LONG!!!
Small talk? Really? What was he, a 14 year old?
We get to the gym door.
“Tell us.” Peggy insisted.
There had been the pressure of my family’s name, hence: the pressure to be the best at everything related to education, pressure to have the proper charisma, the pressure to, always, be the center of attentions and the pressure to present as an Alpha.
New chapter!
"He doesn’t know if he’s my Alpha." I say, calmly. "I know."
“ He didn’t even knew you. He may have been doubtful, but I don’t think that’s because he doesn’t love, or because you aren’t his mate… that photo was the closest thing he had to a mate for over 20 years. I know it shouldn’t have any influence. He shouldn’t have had doubts and…”
And I tried to tell her what happened, but only sobs and the word: photo, came out of my mouth.
How had I been so blind?
“What? I have no idea of what you are talking about.” He said in a very high pitched voice.
She says it will be just as good as when everyone at the orphanage got invited to that Stark charity event, where they had bouncers and cake, and everyone got a chance to talk to Mr. Stark and hi mate, Mr. Steve.
I departed from him and started moving, slowly and steady.
Sorry for the wait. MAJOR WRITER'S BLOCK:(
I may be going feral, but one thing’s for sure: Stark isn’t sure if Steve is his Omega or not!
It’s this kid going to buy his lie?
So Steve just didn’t know how a cellular phone worked. The last one he had used had a little cap, for fuck’s sake.
"Are you honestly telling me no Alpha ever gave you flowers?" He says, or, better yet, yells.
He grabs my hands.
Once I got him naked, I sat against the headboard of the bed, still fully dressed in suit and tie, and told him to put himself in all four on top of me with his ass against my face. He semmed confused to why I was asking him that. Once again the lack of common sex knowledge turned me on, making the pants from my suit horribly tight.
He looks back at Peter’s file.
He did as I told him.
I just need this.
“Are you hiding from the crowd too? “ Asked a beautiful blond guy, with the bluest blue eyes ever.
“You do?” I ask feeling incredibly surprise and uncomfortable.
I thought I had posted Chapter 6 already, but, today, when I was going to post Chapter 7 I noticed that I didn't put the previous chapter here.
I feel Bucky’s arms around me, but I don’t want Bucky to hug me! I don’t want Bucky at all. I just want Tony…
What?
It was like it didn’t matter to him that I was an Omega. We argued. We challenged each other. But we still held respect for each other. And he made me feel safe…
“You went to my room and read me your wedding vows.” He answered me, with tears forming in his eyes.
“What’s your name?” The brunette asked.
Hope you like this work and that you will read the sequel :3
I need her to say ‘yes’!
Aut May – the nicest caretaker here at the orphanage – says the couple that is coming here today is nice and that they will love me lots.
“Not really. It’s pretty bad, actually. But this is the closest school with an art program my grandma could afford.”
“Give me that.” Said the brunette boy, taking the package and card from Steve. “ ‘Hi, Steve, sorry, but I won’t be able to make it for cake. Got some delayed work here with Mr. Stark. Anyway, hope you like your gift. My number is already in it, if you wanna talk. Also, don’t worry about paying your phone calls and for internet and stuff. Go nuts. It’s on me. Signed: Mr. Edward.’ ”
“I thought you were hetero.” She lied.
“At 11 p.m.?” Said Bucky.
I was so focused on being happy with Tony; I guess I forgot to think what I would do when he found his real Omega.
"Why… Why are you giving me roses? " I ask taking the roses on my arms. They felt kind of heavy.
-Steve POV-
But I hope they’re as nice as Mr. Steve was when his mate and I were talking. He kept smiling so caring and he went to get me cake anda soda when I was babling about the science fair.
Tony barely heard the estimated time of arrival for Banner, his attention on Peter who had gone from scremaing to whimpering and wailing, still struggling against Steve's hold on him. Fearing the worst, he turned around to see how Kalyca was doing. His blood ran cold at the sight.
"Where is my suit, dad?"
Warning(s): None really. Some minor swearing and non-detailed minor violence, mention of character death. Mostly this is just lots of talking and some shouting XD
"Did something happen?" Bruce asked looking from the doting parent to the other two avengers slumped down on the stools in utter relief, having no idea of the heroic deed he had performed by scooping up the wandering toddler a few hallways back and returning here.
The grieving parents were interrupted by a loud screech from Raakel. She was standing next to Kalyca, flattening herself to the ground as if afraid or perhaps shocked? The reaosn became apparent clearly when Kalyca took a breath!
wrong.
"He just needs some space. Give him some time before calling an emergency."
Rating: General
Ned nodded before taking off, but he stopped after only a few steps and turned around to push Peter's bag into Happy's hands. "Peter is going to need those."
He left Peter standing there unable to utter a single word in response.
He looked at the phone in his hand and it jolted him into action as he remembered what Peter had asked him to do just now, when he'd called. Ned was impressed that Peter had been able to find the time to call him and not kowing what was exactly going on, was nervewrecking.
Day 19, Prompt #19 & #28: "Yes, I admit it, you were right." & "Enough! I heard enough."
make a difference?"
Perhaps the kid was taking a shower and couldn't hear him? Though it didn't sound like a shower. Something wasn't right here. Sam had a bad feeling. Apologizing mentally to the kid, he opened the door.
Even if he did stumble and mess up now, he was confident his dads would protect him now that he saw them circling him like this. The rest of the morning was spent flying around the tower and scaring the other avengers through the windows, especially his uncle Clint.
but there were plenty he'd never seen before. Obviously there was Norman Osborn, better known as the Green Goblin. Otto Octavius had captured him, Venom skulked about as did Electro and Vulture. He'd even seen Mysterio off to the side.
"Nah, once was enough I think." They all laughed at that before dispersing for their separate tasks. Peter took the drawing and hung it above his desk, as a reminder for himself of why he became spider-man. Who he should be.
"Let's just start moving and see where we get. At least we've got each other for company."
"I don't know exactly why or how this has happened, just
"You would allow me to do that?" Tony asked cautiously.
"The kid is awake!"
. He snapped his head back foreward and stared for a few seconds at his own hands. Then as if his body caught on to his mind, his fingers lost whatever connection allowed them to stick to the ceiling, and Peter came tumbling down.
"No I haven't seen him." Bruce asnwered. "I asked Friday to inform you and Peter and she reported back that you would tell Peter."
Peter looked away, not wanting to be reminded of the fall out with his dad. "I just needed some air." He was secretly pleased even Dr. Strange cared about him. Though Peter wasn't as close to all the avengers and thus not all of them were his aunts and uncles, all the avengers were considered family by all. Having proof that even the estranged wizard cared meant a lot to Peter.
Tony turned to look at his son, to see if he understood when he suddenly felt tiny lips against his own forehead. "I love you too, daddy."
"Steve is going to kill me. Best keep the kid alive." Bucky spoke out loud, before joining his nephew in the battle.
His head was spinning and his sense of threat was constantly tingling, so when a hand landed on his shoulder he flinched and wildly flung out his arm. Whoever he was facing was not letting go, grabbing for him again and again no matter how often Peter pulled away. It wasn't until he felt metal instead of flesh or cloth that he stopped fighting. Confused he looked up and almost drowned in relief.
Tony could feel the tears roll down his face but he refused to acknowledge them, pulling out of Clint's hold and turning away. In truth, he hated how he couldn't be there for Steve. Hated how he felt the need to grieve alone. Hated how he lashed out in his grieve at everyone else. He'd chased everyone out and Steve leaving had hurt the most.
Very carefully, with the lightest touch, he closed his bedroom door. The sound of the doorbell had Peter stopping in his tracks at the top of the stairs. A wave of anxiety rose up out of nowhere, a feeling as if he were under threat. Trusting in his gut, Peter ducked behind the banister, out of direct sight of the front door. He heard his aunt May move towards the door, her footsteps echoeing loudly as if his hearing had suddenly been dialed up to the extreme.
"Of course. You thought I wouldn't?"
"I'm in."
And promptly found it lacking another person. It was fairly early, but it wans't too unusual for Peter to be up already, especially with their family in such distress. Had the kid even slept at all? Tony checked the bathroom, then the kitchen, the living room....he was nowhere to be found.
"I never know it could be this way."
Hope you enjoy!
"Sorry, would you mind if I take this for a moment. It's a voicemail."
been here before.
Peter was running as fast as he could. He couldn't recall why, only that he had to run. A painful tug in his chest convinced him to stop and draw in desperate breaths of air. The pain did not decrease nor did it increase. Peter was confused and wondered if something was wrong with him. Was this why he was in medical? Was he injured? He couldn't remember. But maybe Kalyca could.

has happened."
"I agree, it was unusual."
Silence finally descended on the two and Ned thanked his lucky stars no one else was in the school right now, but it didn't alleviate his guilt by much as he'd just effectively exposed his best friend's secret.
mask, apparently and just as black as the rest of his suit.
"Get away from me!" She screamed as she stumbled away from him, tripping over her injured leg and falling down. Peter reached out to help her but it only invoked more hysterics. "NO! Help! Someone help me!" she threw whatever she could get her hands on. "Get away from me! Leave me alone!"
Warning(s): none.
He sighed before answering. "No, that's alright. Thank you for the offer, but Steve is right. Peter just wants to be alone for now." Turning to said husband and pointing a finger threateningly at him; "But he'd better let me know he's alright within an hour or I will send my drones after him."
One step into the room had him stepping on glass and water, the noise making him jump. Alarmed he looked around and noticed another disaster area like the bedroom. The mirror was smashed, its pieces under his feet. The faucet appeared to be broken in half, water steadily gushed out and the shower curtain had been ripped off and lay forgotten on the mess of a floor.
Steve was out the door in a heartbeat, Tony rapidly following him although there was no feasable chance of him keeping up with the supersoldier. "Alert Banner!" Tony ordered JARVIS as he ran.
A few tense minutes of silence passed before Peter startled at his own ringtone and nearly dropped his phone. Hesistantly he answered it.
Warning(s): none.
"Peter? Is it you?"
"I'm alright, Pe..Peter." She crawled into his lap, slowly. She was clearly in pain from the way she moved but Peter could not feel how bad. His own pain was too great to pick out what Kalyca was feeling specifically. And she no doubt was feeling the echo of his own pain. Best to let a third party deduce the damage then.
Steve felt himself get weak in the knees, but thankfully Scott and Clint noticed and set him down on the nearest available space. "We'll find him, I promise you." Scott tried to reassure him.
Iron Man was fast. Peter would know as he'd seen him in action and he worked on the suit enough alongside his dad. He also knew no matter how fast he was, the distance was too short to catch up. The suit had released Peter when they fell, desperate to save himself.
Tony slapped a hand over his mouth. "Pipe down, will you." He said in a hushed voice before taking away his hand and he actually smiled at Happy. "And no, I didn't kidnap anyone. That was my son, whom I've adopted a few years ago when his parents died. I never told anyone about this beyond a select few because I didn't want that kind of attention anywhere near the kid."
"JARVIS scanned the cars. There were three. You were in the middle one. I tried to stop the last car but they panicked and drove right into the car you were in. I was so scared I'd lost you." To emphasize this his dad hugged him again mindful of Kalyca and the fact he was in his iron man armor.
"Please answer the question m'am." The voice sounded irritated and that worried Peter. How long could his aunt stand her ground before they took matters into their own hands?! Peter itched to go down there but if he did right now he might complicate things.
"Tony?"
. Better this than finding him dead in the gutter one day."
"My name is Alan Fredrick. I'm here on behalf of Mr. Parker, sir."
I start feeling very bothered and numb…
I first met Agent in Pepper’s and Romanoff’s wedding.
I talked to Mr. Stark about my project on the science fair and stuff I have been learning at school… I must have sounded so lame! He’s like, the smartest man ever and I talked about winning the first prize at a regular science fair? He must have thought I was so boring…
“And why do you need a wrapped phone?”
“No. I don’t know. I just…”
- Steve POV -
I'm sorry to those who wanted a pregnant Steve :(
That was the moment I presented as an Alpha.
“I bet you all had quite a laugh out of my expenses. I always though your father was the worst Alpha I’ve ever met… but it seems like the worst was actually you all along.”
"I’m fine." I say.
“I’m... I’m here to see Steve?” He stuttered.
Inside the army facilities, there were only two people I can truly trust: Miss Peggy Carter and my childhood best friend Bucky Barnes. Although they were both Alphas, neither saw me as a weak omega, instead, they looked at me as a friend. I’ll always appreciate that. But I still want to feel loved by an Alpha. I still would have liked to have the support of a loving Alpha, because tomorrow everything will change. I either die or I’ll be reborn as a new, strong Omega.
I should have just taken the flowers and shut up… now he’ll understand how undesirable I am.
“You don’t need to bring me a gift, but I would love if you stopped by for cake.” Said Steve smiling widely.
But finally, chapter 9 is here! And I'm also almost done with this work :3
-Tony POV-
- Tony POV -
So, how come I’m so sure the man in this old, damned, photo is my mate, at the same time I’m sure Steve is, also, my mate?
When I was a teenager, right after presenting, I knew right away that the man on my father’s picture was my mate.
I’m doing my last blood test right now, and I can feel myself shaking as the needle pierces through my skin.
“You seem sad, so talk to us.”
I can’t believe it.
“Yeah, it’s definitely going to art program I just received a message from Mr. Stark’s CEO saying that their making the donation to the art program. Also Mr. Stark won’t be present at the ceremony… He’s a busy man.”
And then, one day, while running through my father’s office, I found, at the bottom of a drawer, an old photograph.
"Because, even if he’s not sure I’m his Omega, he still wants me to be he’s mate. He loves me. That’s more than I ever hoped for… Bucky, I was the worst Omega to ever be born. I always dreamed that someone would like me the way Tony does, but I never thought it would actually happen. I don’t care if he’s not sure we’re meant to be. I care about what he wants us to be."
"No." As I let go of the hug, I gather as much strength as I can, so I wouldn’t start crying out of happiness, before I keep talking. " I… I want you to court me."
“Shouldn’t you be happy then?” Asked Bucky.
“He’s probably worried about you.”
“Yes, of course. I’m so sorry my gift was an inconvenience to you, I promise you I’ll give a simpler AND cheaper phone next. And don’t tell me you don’t want it. I want to be able to talk to you any time, so you can’t refuse it. How about something with a little cap?”
“Sweetie, let Mr. Edward answer you. I swear I don’t know why he rumbles so much.” She told him.
“I don’t really like goodbyes, so… Look, would you mind if I… I don’t know, drop by your house, or something. It’s totally fine if you don’t, ‘cause you don’t know me… but I thought I could bring you a gift… or something.”
"That he wasn’t sure?" He yells, while a tear fall down his face.
And who was I to deny him?!
In it was an image of a beautiful man. He wasn’t looking at the camera, as if he was too shy to look up to the photographer. Even though he was looking down, I could tell the man had clear, expressive, eyes. His lips were thin, but resembled a perfect cupid bow.
But then…
"You’re okay Stark?" Fury asks.
“Is he handsome?”
I took off the rest off my clothes in a very non elegant way.
“I don’t need to waste money on a newspaper. I talk to Mrs. Gonzalves everyday about the news. She’s a really nice lady. Why do you ask?... Are you famous, sir?”
I had never felt so happy before. I just want this happiness to be forever.
“Don’t say it like that.” I begged again, hoping in my head, that I could have said: no, it hadn’t been a mistake, but… it had really been an accident. “Steve. I love you.”
Fury says he read my file, so I’m hoping my file impresses him.
"Nice to meet you, Mr. Stark." He tells me. But he says it as if it was not “nice” at all to meet me.
This man was magnificent… so magnificent that I caught myself with a boner.
Since when is someone I don’t know “my Omega”?
FLASHBACK
-Steve POV-
“And she wants an extravagant gift, am I right?”
And the way he looked at me… it’s like he hates me!
Piece of cake.
Mental slap!
“What?” I whisper in confusion, looking at a smiling Mr. Rogers-Stark, and a Mr. Stark, who, unlike the other day, seemed very nervous and sweaty.
He didn’t say a word. He just scotched a bit so I could enter.
“Yeah, but, on a scale of 1 to 10, how happy would you be, if he donated the money to the art program?”  Why was he even asking that? He knew this guy for 10 minutes and was already ready to call Pepper and tell her to donate the art program. Sure, he had a tendency to give expensive gift to the people he felt attracted to, but this was a student, and he was thirty. Didn’t matter he was 18, it was probably still a crime in some country.
Hearing Steve say my name so sweetly and baring his neck like that… in the heat of Steve’s pheromones, I stopped being able to think and I came inside him, bitting his neck… and marking us forever as mates…
“That would be swell.” Steve said.
"You brought me roses." I say, mildly shocked.
-Tony POV-
“I know it sounds bad, but…” She starts.
- Peter POV –
“I’m not your secretary. I’m your CEO!” She yelled.
“Are you Mr. Edward?” She asked with a sly look in her eye.
We are constantly fighting, but, still, I can’t help but to adore him and challenge him and want to treat him as if he belonged to me.
“Steve…” I start again, in hopes of letting him know how important he is to me, but get interrupted by him.
I need to let Steve know that Tony Stark might not be his Alpha.
“It’s… retro…? But why have you been working all night on this design? It’s nothing special.”
He decided he was going to make this kid his lover, and without him finding out who Tony really was.
He stops and looks at me and… God! What happened to his eye? His left eye was so swollen. When did that happened? Had it been swollen before?
“He’s entering a Heat.” Bruce told me.
"Captain Rogers is in the gym. I’ll send for him." Fury said. "Coulson, go get Captain Rogers. And tell him Mr. Stark is here to meet him."
But this time?
Me!!!
“Oh. Okay, then. Goodbye, Mr. Edward.” Steve said, sadly.
Everything became blurry.
“Well, he’s got the latest Stark Phone model out of you. What else could he want now?” She said, looking at Tony’s little freak out session. “But, why are you so upset? It’s not like it’s the first time you’ve got dumped after a lover got what they wanted from you.”
“What if… what if he doesn’t want to be a Stark.” He asks looking up from Peter’s file, at me, right into my eyes.
I always thought no one would love ‘cause I’m Peter Parker Stark, and here I am: in a middle of a Alpha Duel.
- Steve POV –
And worse – two Alphas from the S.H.I.E.L.D.S.’ Superhero Trainning!
And with that, the student (Tony assumed it was a student, since it was wearing S.H.I.E.L.D.’s school uniform) sat on the other far end of the room, took out a notebook from his bag and started drawing.
It’s time to come clean.
I lift his chin, and force his gaze back at me.
I pushed my cock inside, feeling his walls welcoming me warmly and tightly.
“I’m not helping.” Smiled Bucky even more.
When I first met Tony Stark, I was very scared.
“No, he doesn’t. It’s his birthday, just so you know.”
I feel my face getting hot, but it’s not from rage, or shame… it’s from the tears that are, now, rolling down my face. I’m trying to stop crying, but I can’t.
“What…? What are you talking about…?” I asked raising my hair to look at her in the eyes, even thought my vision was still blurry from the tears.
“Tony.” I say, ashamed of how weak my voice sounds, but even  more ashamed of how stupid I was.
"Because I love him."
“Pepper?! How can you say that to me?!” He exclaimed dramatically.
Everyone was filled with joy: my father, the staff, Jarvis… but me?
“You’ve meet someone again, didn’t you?”
"That I loved him?"
He got to tell me all about the photo, and told him about Howard, even though he got really jealous.
“What are you going to do?” Bucky asked.
“It’s a long story.”
The two had been talking through the whole afternoon, in the art studio, and Steve, who, although, knew he was gay, had never been in love with another boy, had fallen for Mr. Tony Edwars already… but Mr. Edward was not just a boy, he was a man. A really attractive and interesting man; who was so kind to Steve, even though they had just met.
"You want to court me?"
“You’ve got to understand, Steve. Tony was a teen when he found that old photo. He believed for years the man on the photo was his mate.”
“You don’t have to explain. I’m the one who’s sorry.” I am crying again. “I didn’t let you talk. I just jump to conclusions. I already know, and I’m so sorry I didn’t listen to what you had to say… I’m the one who’s sorry. I’m in the living room of the penthouse with Pepper… I’m ready to hear you now. I’m sorry, I… Tony?” I ask the moment I hear a small noise and stop hearing Tony breath on the other side of the line.
For Steve, I would dive into certain death.
“Don’t worry, honey… can I call you that?” She questioned, without giving him the time to answer. “You seem like a «honey» type of guy.” She continued. “Don’t worry, honey. It’s not that he didn’t like it; he just doesn’t know how it works.”
-Bucky POV-
How could Tony do that?
“That you loved me…”
He seemed like everything I wanted on an Alpha… but at some point so did Howard Stark.
Waking up from death in the lap of my Omega, while he cried beautifully over me… I don’t think I’ve ever been that happy…
I parted his cheeks. His little, cute, pink hole was very close my face now, and I lost no time. I started liking the hole, taking my tongue all the way down from his hole to his sack, following the stream of slick that was dripping.
"I noticed a while after he started courting me."
After mating with Steve, and a well deserved beat up from Bucky, that ended with The Hulk holding Bucky away from me, I discovered that Steve was aware that I was unsure about us being mates.
Still I hope you like the final chapter of this work... that will have a SEQUEL, centred on their son ^^
We were kissing frantically, not even sure if Pepper was still there or not.
“You don’t know Mr. Stark? I mean, what he looks like?”
"Is that bad?" He asks, looking honestly worried, but I can’t really focus on anything but the huge, beautiful bouquet he was holding with both hands.
And Steve’s nose and hair!
I try to help her up and apologize, but the enormous need to scream and cry makes it so hard. She ends up standing up by herself. She looks at me, with worry written all over her face.
“Was it him?” Asked Peggy.
"You look sweaty." He says, I’m not sure if to annoy me or not.
END OF FLASHBACK
“You’re not just a CEO, Pepper. You’re my best friend.” He said pulling the best puppy eyes a man in his 30’s could.
“I guess I would be very happy. The art program really needs some help. But he probably will donate it to the chemistry program. Mrs. Gonçalves says he likes science and stuff like that.”
-Tony POV-
“I don’t real care about it. I have other things on my mind.”
“Me neither.” Smiled Peggy, just as wide as Bucky.
“I know a Steve…”
I had three Phd’s and no status in society.
New chapter, just like I promissed ;)
And the worse part is… that I actually happy knowing that Deadpool will defently win this…
“Way to make it weird, Stark!” Tony thought to himself and process talking, because one: he didn’t have a filter; and two: he was in for an attempt to change the mood. “So, you… never mind.” He said regretting opening his mouth already.
I take the phone from her hand.
He started moaning my name loudly as I thrusted into him in a, now, ruttless pace.
“It’s just the latest model of phones from Stark Industries!”
“Peter.” He repeted.
He made me feel loved… and, quickly, I fell in love with him.
“Why wouldn’t he want to be a Stark?” I asked, and procced on talking before Tony was actually able to come up with na answer. “You’re the mate I always dreamed of, why wouldn’t you be the parent Peter dreams of as well? Tony, you’re amazing! You’ve proven that many times, not to me alone, but to the world as well.”
I have been dealing with some personal problems and hadn't had the time to write.
And then, came the invasion.
I can’t let my best friend live in a lie… even if it makes him happier than I ever seen him be in his life.
That’s the whole reason for courting. It’s the Alphas way to let the Omegas know they are mates.
When I was a kid, there had been a great deal of pressure placed on me.
“The bird on the window. “ He answered never taking his eyes from the notebook.
I saw Steve’s eye’s going instantly to my manhood. The way he was looking, with so much thirst, made me feel flattered, and a lot hornier. He started moving his legs, uncertain of what to do with them as more slick leaked out of his hole.
“That’s pretty good. The art program must be nice here.” He said.
“I’m sorry…” He says. “I understand if you hate, after all that I put you through. But…”
“Mr. Edward?” How odd must it have been to Steve, Tony allowed himself to think; seeing one day, on his house, this man he barely knows, wearing a hoodie in summer, sitting on the younger’s living room that, by the way, screamed «CRAZY CAT LADY» (even if he hadn’t seen any cats) with a mug with tea next to Steve’s grandmother. “I’m so glad you’re here. I wanted to call you, but Peggy and Bucky won’t tell me how that phone works. It doesn’t even look like a phone. Why doesn’t it look like a phone? And why did you give something as expensive as my house. Peggy said that’s the prize on it. Is it really that expensive?”
As a matter of fact, I didn’t.
I can remember it like it was yesterday.
"Fury, please, I’ll let myself into the gym. No need to bring Agent into my life… no offense, Agent."
Seventy years stopped in time… but… I wonder if it’s was not for the best.
"What if Tony finds his true mate?"
Happy stopped by the house indicated and asked his boss if he was okay…
"Yes, sir. " Agent says.
It was about forty years old.
Take that, Agent.
“Remember at our wedding, when you got nervous because you were afraid I would leave you, because you thought you weren’t going to pull off the whole mate thing? Remeber what I did, right before we got married.”
“Who’s it from?” Asked Peggy.
“Shut up Bucky. What’s the matter? Does he have a girlfriend?”
Of course she would. It was a summer day and he was using a hoodie. She probably was assuming he was there either to rob her, or sell drugs to her grandson, or some other shit.
That’s why she became so pale. I now have the two sides of the story… but no one else does.
“Tony? Is everything alright?”
How can any decent Alpha do this?
“Yes.”
“So that’s why you made extra.” Said Bucky, no longer feeling like finishing his fourth piece of cake.
No Alpha ever did that for me.
I’m feeling very confused with his words… I mean, I know the man in the picture is beautiful, and I know that Steve has a low self esteem, but how could he think I would be able to love this man more than him?
“Cake?”  Tony asked confused. The guy had an aura of innocence around him, but he was all perfect muscles. He was having a hard time picturing him baking.
And Tony though he had made progress in lighting the mood… but, as usual, he kept talking because this student was really the cutest man alive; and who need a filter anyway?
A weak since the last time I saw Tony.
“HE WHAT?”
"What? I… because I was trying to start well with my courting."
“I don’t hate you, Tony…” I say already too used to the tears in my eyes, but crying wasn’t going to stop me from letting Tony know my feelings. “I love you.” I confess.
Howard said no one would love me if I was unattractive.
“After seeing this photo, how could you want me?”
That guy was a high school student. Probably a minor. He shouldn’t have this kind of thoughts.
It’s the romantic moment I’ve always dreamed of… or it would be, if he hadn’t said what he said next.
As I ‘m about to explain the stupidity that it’s my brain and me in general, he says:
"Just fine?" Steve inquired sensing an underlying
"Just don't feel like you have to use it. If you want you can keep calling me uncle Steve for as long as you want."
A hand closed around Peter's upper arm and by reflex Peter pulled his arm forward to free himself causing said person to stumble forward so violently he fell forward and banged his head on a nearby table. He  was out cold instantly. Peter could not believe his luck. What the hell was happening to him?!
"No not really. There's just something about him."
Despite his resolve, Happy couldn't help but smile at that. Tony scooped up his son, and wow wasn't that still a strange thought, causing Peter to giggle loudly. "It's because he's such a happy person!"
"Oh I think we both know it was pretty bad."
Rating: Teen and Up.
Tony stared at the tear-stained face of his little boy as he placed the little bandage on his knee. He hated seeing Peter like this, but he had an idea to cheer him up. "There all done, well almost done."
A crossroads. Multiple paths. But Peter on the other hand was delighted. He
Tony gently stepped away from the comforting hand on his shoulder, scooping Basil in his arms as he walked out of the lab. "Yeah, you're probably right."
"What if you linked my suit with Friday, somehow? I know my suit isn't made of metal and stuff ,but I'm sure you can figure something out. That way, Friday can monitor me and if I get injured, badly, she can alert you. You won't have to spy on me." Peter added with a gently chuckle, his adrenaline fuelled anger having subsided.
"Goodnight, Spider-Man." Otto said criptically before a smoke bomb of some sort exploded in his face and he lost consciousness.

Sam slammed the fridge door closed a bit too hard as he turned on the two. "And you didn't think to check on him?!"
"Yes. among other things."
"No, Gwen wait. It's absolutely you're business. You work there and I had no right to be there. In fact you didn't rat me out, for which I'm grateful but also confused."
Warning(s): none.
"Yes." Peter froze not expecting the answer. Unfortunately Friday was not done yet. "You flatlined several times in the Tower's medical facility until you eventually did not recover. I was very sad and still am. I miss you Peter."
Peter is around 10 years old in this.
Peter sighed. He knew why. That damn bag he found at his aunt and uncle's house. A photo of his father and one dr. Connors. He'd just wanted to know something more, anything more about Richard Parker. Even though he had a great life, two fantastic dads and a true family in the avengers, not to mention a wonderful aunt and uncle... and yet his birth parents' deaths still bothered him. There was just something about it. Maybe it was nothing, just his traumatised child mind trying to process it all through nightmares and dreams. But a part of him wondered if some of those dreams weren't made-up. What if they were memories?!
"Right, sorry. Still getting used to all these advancements." Steve had a pensieve look on his face as if he was remembering all the crazy new technology he'd had figuratively thrown at him. "I should let you get back to you work. Sorry to bother you."
“Staring at it, is not going to change anything.”
Kalyca curled up on his lap, worry about what the message could hold nagging at them both. Peter pressed play.
"Yes. Why do you ask?"
all characters will probably act way out of character and some things have been exaggerated for fun and to suit the prompt. Just so you know why something might feel weird.
, Bruce knew something had happened to Peter, but this was beyond his wildest theories.
"Pops!" Peter stumbled in his surprise before bending over to catch his breath. "Sorry, I didn't hear you."
But no Peter.
"Alright, how do you feel Peter? Still tired? Any nausea?"
He waited a few second and when there was still no answer, he opened the door. He immediately got smacked in the face by a piece of paper. Pulling it away, he observed the room. The window was open and the growing storm outside had entered Peter's room. Bursts of wind had scattered many of Peter's belongings in such a matter it was dangerous to walk around. On the bed, he found the entire contents of the fridge.
"You got it, kiddo."

"It's okay, Peter. It's me, it's dad." His dad pulled him into a hug and Peter sagged against him. He was safe now. Unfortunately for Peter, his dad pulled away needing to check him over. "How badly are you hurt? I'm so sorry. I had no idea those idiots would startle this badly."
"What?!"
Steve pulled Tony away from Bruce as Qatara grabbed Basil by the neck and carried him away creating some distance. Bruce did not move away or try to strike back for which Steve was grateful. Raakel rubbed against his leg in comfort yet continued softly growling, a clear sign that Bruce was still feeling that surge of anger at Tony's actions, despite not wanting to feel that way. However, there didn't seem to be a risk of the Hulk appearing. Bruce had enough control right now.

Peter hesitated for only a moment before stopping. "You could....I mean....Can you stay?" Peter felt his face heat up in embarassment, but his need to not be alone was greater. Besides it wasn't like they'd never hung out before, yet somehow now it felt strange to ask him to. "You don't have to. You're probably busy and this is boring anyway. Sorry."
"I've got the papers right here. To be clear. Once you sign this, you will relinquish all rights to Peter Parker. Do you understand?"
"Do you know who I am?"
"Well, I'll still go check on him." Sam responded. As he left the room, he could just hear Barton questioning Rhodey on when he'd asked Friday about the kid. Honestly, they were Peter's honorary uncles but couldn't be bothered to watch out for the kid. Perhaps he was overreacting, but Sam couldn't just leave it to an AI, even one he liked.
"I'm okay aunt May. Promise."
"Alright then. Hold my hand." Peter did as he was told, watching mesmerized at his pops' wings as they were invoked. Large, blond almost golden, feathers blossomed before him into beautiful wings that would make many people jealous, and had in the past.
SPOILER! Read drabble first!
"He has an aunt and uncle who have indicated they'd be happy to take him. However, Richard made a will stating that you, Mr. Anthony Edward Stark have been given custody of Peter Parker, assuming you accept it. If you choose not to take him Benjamin and May Parker will get custody. Do you understand, sir?"
„I hope they wake up soon.”

Peter was prevented from answering by none other than his dad finally returning. "Hey kiddo, I'm back. You better not have been slacking in....here." Tony looked surprised at seeing them both in his workshop. "This day just got a lot better. My two favorite people in the same room."
Technically superfamily ,although Steve is only mentioned and doesn't appear.
I honestly couldn't come up with much, so sorry for the super tiny drabble, but the whole point of this event is to write something even if it's not much. Hope you'll all still enjoyed it.
"I'm sorry. I can't tell you. Please stay safe." The call was ended by Peter without warning or a proper goodbye. Just like that, he was gone.
Guilt settled heavily in his gut at the mention of his boy. He'd treated him horribly, yelled at him. Yes he'd been angry, and yes Peter had done something incredibly stupid and it had resulted in terrible consequences.... but he wasn't the only one to ever make mistakes. He needed to talk to his son.
"Change is annoyingly difficult."
"How...."Tony couldn't even get the question out but Clint seemed to understand.
Several seemed okay with it, even without ever knowing who he really was. Tony only really payed attention when Steve asked him for his opinion. He thought about for a while, but eventually decided he liked the new guy.
Bruce purposedly ignored looking at Raakel, not wanting to raise to her baiting, but it was hard to ignore the slight smugness radiating from her end of their bond. He knew exactly what she was getting at, but the prospect of telling the distraught parents what he believed to have happened to Peter was not a good one. Besides he’d much rather wait for Peter to wake up so he could help the teenager through the change first. It was traumatizing enough without the added stress and fear of his parents.
"Do you think I enjoy hurting you?" Peter didn't grace the question with an answer. "You do, of course you would." He stepped closer, using the chair to balance himself and leaned over Peter, as if trying to intimidate him. "I'm trying to
It was like the roles were completely reversed!
"Make your choice, Stark."

know I'm not coming home for a little while. I won't say anything about all this."
Warning(s): none. Just a deep conversation.
Finally Tony gave in, how could he not. Steve had that affect on him, damn his very fine husband. "I know...I know, I just hate to see the kid suffer. He's suffered enough already in his life. "Tony placed his hands on Steve's for a moment before gently prying them off and continuing his task of getting ready for bed. "I hate being useless."
"All of you stop, you're only making it worse. Get back!" Bruce tried to keep control of the room but it was getting cinreasingly harder to do with everyone confused and frightened. Having the Hulk roar in the back of his mind about threats and anger was not helping. It was costing most of his attention and energy to keep him at bay and form the look of Raakel shaking beside him, he was losing that battle.
"You had better!" He couldn't help but snap back. He didn't mean to be this person, but his son was missing! He couldn't think straight, let alone mind his manners.

His son, his child, his little boy.....
Peter looked around, beside him, behind him. She wasn't anywhere! "Kalyca!?" Where are you?!"
The elevator came to a gentle stop at the right floor, the doors opening to reveal none other than his dads. Peter sighed internally, not feeling up to this but having no coice in the matter. He pushed off from the wall with more effort than was considered normal and immediately the stern faces morphed into concern and previosuly crossed arms reached forward as if to steady him. Peter usually dodged such attempts but his world shifted sideways dangerously, so he allowed them to steady him and almost literally pull him out of the elevator, his bag dragging behind him as he lacked the strength to lift it up.
Peter scoffed at the offer. "Oh come off your high horse. We all know you're going to torture me if I don't answer. Just get it over with."
"Any specific reason for that?"
Prompt 6: "Yes, I'm aware. Your point?"
Hope you enjoyed it regardless.
"Do you know where he is? Where he was taken?" Happy asked shockingly calm.
"You don't think
"JARVIS, where is Banner?!"
"Long enough," Tony answered as he wiped his black smeared hands on a cloth. "Honestly, I would have expected either of you to notice me by smell alone."
A frustrated noise was all Peter got as response before sounds of a scuffle could be heard. He was about to inquire if Quill was alright when the door to the cockpit burst open and the alien bug came right for him. Peter quickly webbed it to the ground to slow it down before leaping over it and through the now destroyed door. He knew he had little time as the creature possessed some sort of acid liquid that could easily dissolve his webfluid. Something he found very interesting, but not at this moment.
"Peter, please go."
"Thank you Friday." He returned distractedly, his eyes never leaving the poor vision of his hurt boy. It was clear from some of the wounds that Peter had been tortured. Tortured! Who would torture a child?! It mad eihm sick to his stomach just thinking about it.
Knocking on Peter's door got him nowhere. There was no answer. "Peter? Are you in there?" Still nothing. "I'm coming in, Peter."
Tony nodded, tugging off his own skates and picking up the two pairs. He walked back over to the counter and leaned over to dump the skates behind it. He slipped on his shoes and walked back over to Steve who was giving him a startlingly obvious once-over. Not that Tony was complaining.
Rhodey had a far off look in his eyes and he shook his head vigorously. “Some-some creature came into the compound Tony and he...he didn’t even do anything at all. He just
“I think we need to talk.” Steve informed him, words careful and calculated like they usually were these days. Rapid-fire arguments were a thing of the past but Tony thought they were about to make a comeback.
“Right. Well to be fair, you did sort of catch me off guard.” Tony couldn’t hold back his happiness if he tried, and he couldn’t keep his hands off of Steve either. Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s hair, it was soft underneath his fingertips. He decided he enjoyed the new length.
Tony wanted to kiss it away, so he did. “We are leaving the past in the past tonight, yeah?” If they started to think too hard, their little life raft was bound to sink.
Steve extended his jacket and Tony huffed a breath. He had an equal urge to refuse the jacket because Steve would undoubtedly become cold himself and to accept it because while the jacket was warm, Tony was undeniably cold.
He hadn’t seen Steve yet. He wasn’t sure he was ready anyway.
“And that is why you and Dum-E have a weird bond. I get it now. You’re both in the Party Pooper club.” Tony pressed the button that would take them to Steve’s floor. Steve liked his harder mattress more than Tony’s soft one and Steve found it endearing that Tony always remembered the small things.
“What’s wrong?” Steve asked, purposefully walking slow to match Tony’s pace. Tony appreciated the small gesture. He always appreciated Steve’s gestures.
“There’s not much of the Avenger’s anymore.” He remarked, realizing that it probably took him a while to reply. Happy didn’t seem to notice, or if he did, he didn’t mention it. Tony put the mug back down, drumming his fingers against the ceramic absentmindedly.
“Exactly, in a letter. Classy.” Tony said, sarcasm lacing his words. His eyebrows flicked upwards before dropping back down.
Tony looked up at Rhodey under furrowed eyebrows and then back at the texts. “I’m not going to blow it, okay? Have a little faith, Rumplestiltskin. Also I told you not to text Clint, it's not a good idea.”
Tony had expected as much, but he always gave it a try anyway. "Somehow I never see these drawings even when they are done."
Steve did remember all that, it had been a nice day, one of the few they got off to go do as they pleased without Avenger’s business on their plates. They’d even gone for ice cream afterwards.
He got up on tired legs. He felt like he was moving through jello and yet he felt tense and high-strung. He hoped Vision had turned out alright, and he really hoped he hadn’t been wrong. Sure, it would be great to have one over Steve, but really he was just worried. He had already hurt Wanda so much, and he’d be lying if he said she didn’t cross his mind when he decided to put the jewel in the place of the mind stone.
Tony’s first words to Steve were, “Come with me.” And then he walked past him, right out the door. He didn’t even glance back to make sure Steve followed him, just assumed he would. The faint sound of footsteps behind him was just reassurance.
Tony reached forward, but Steve gathered up his arms and dragged him to the backroom. Tony hadn’t realized that there was a backroom but he was more focused on Steve anyway.
And of course, some nights Tony was up and about in the workshop till dawn.
“Hate to break it to you but that logic is flawed.” Tony pulled his hood up higher as it began to slip. He could see the skating rink up ahead, not more than a few minutes away if they continued at the same rate.
He noticed Steve’s staring and looked down, seeing the scars marring his chest. Tony was used to seeing them in the mirror, he’d had them for so many years now. He used to look at the arc reactor and wonder how he truly lived with the piece of metal in his chest. And now without it, he was still the reminded of its existence. Tony never thought to be embarrassed of it.
“I’m bored, Fury hasn’t given me anything to do today.” Steve had eyed him one more time before shrugging and accepting that response. Tony could tell he wasn’t buying it.
__________
It was heat and beauty, but it was cold and messy. His mouth was pressed against Steve’s with hunger and unhinged vehemence. His hands came up to rest on Steve’s chest, absently tracing the shape of the star that used to sit there. Steve’s fingertips were a constant pressure on his waist as they pressed into his exposed skin.
Natasha and Steve were in the room in only a couple of seconds, FRIDAY probably alerting them of their presence. Everyone in the room was holding their breath.
“For as long as you’ll have me.”
Tony laughed, happy and carefree. He hadn’t felt this light in what felt like years. “I thought you would like it!” He proclaimed defensively, but there was a laugh in his voice too. He had painted the words on the front of the shield in yellow paint just a couple of days before when he had a second of spare time. “It’s yours. I’m done playing this game, I’m done being petty and you’re done being stubborn. Please take it? I actually really want you to have it.” And Tony thought he would be saying it just to convince Steve, and maybe he was just looser after mind blowingly good sex, but the words rang true.
“We won’t.” In Tony’s mind it was just that simple.
“That’s alright, I got you.” Steve whispered, hands tightening around Tony protectively. And he didn’t plan on letting go.
anything.” Tony’s head snapped up, and he ran a frustrated hand through his unruly hair. He caught a glimpse of himself in the cracked mirror behind the bar and quickly looked away. He looked like a mess with unruly hair and deep bags under his eyes.
“It’s really more of a thank you. For introducing me to disco in the best possible way.” Steve put his hand on Tony’s knee and Tony forced himself to tear his gaze away from the drawing.
When Tony got back to the compound, he could sense something wasn’t right. He brushed it off as lingering paranoia and headed inside. He was met with eerie silence. It was usually fairly quiet around the compound but never like this. A clap would have echoed as loud as a gunshot.
“Sometimes I wish Natasha would send me a warning via Morse code before we got new visitors.” New visitors translucently meant Steve, Rhodey wasn’t too dense to pick up on that, and he spared him a comforting half-smile.
“How’s Barnes?” Tony asked him, finding it only fair that he also make awkward conversation.
Steve picked up the notepad he had been sketching on earlier and his pencil. He put the notepad in his lap, and twirled the pencil between his thumb and forefinger. He flipped through the scratchy pages filled with doodles. Mainly of Tony, sometimes of the team.
That was fine because Tony couldn’t deal with this small talk anyway. He didn’t even know how he was supposed to react anymore. It was making his skin itch, so he decided getting to the point would make this easier than just standing around trying to be something they weren’t.
, Tony tried to say when he saw the tears on Steve’s face as well. “It’s okay, it’s okay.” He whispered when he got his voice to work again. He took in a big breath when he felt himself begin to slip away.
Steve rolled over in bed, glancing over at the glowing digits on the clock sitting on his bedside table. He sighed, and flipped back onto his back. He drummed his fingers against his chest, realizing vaguely that he picked that habit up from Tony.
laugh that lit up the dark skating rink all on its own. Tony hadn’t heard that laugh in so long, and it was like a peek of the sun behind a grouping of thick clouds.
Things got a lot more complicated after that.
He spun Tony around without warning and wrapped his arms back around him from behind. Tony leaned into Steve indulgently, and even on ice Steve was practically immovable. “So we are going to stay like this? You won’t hear me complaining.”
“Alternate your weight on your feet and slide forward. It’s similar to rollerblading.” Steve did a lap around the skating rink and Tony followed him with his eyes, jaw going slack. Steve circled around and returned to Tony’s side, a small smile playing at his lips under the dim lighting from the street.
The weather was a crooked line between chilly and cold and Tony knew his thin pajamas wouldn't keep him warm. He didn't mind.
“Chocolates could be a start, followed up by a foot massage, and then maybe a carriage ride home. Or is that pushing the limits of your devotion to me?” Tony asked with a purposefully artificial smile.
It had been a slow week, so when Rhodey had asked him to go grab coffees he hadn’t objected. He took his car to Starbucks and tossed on a baseball cap for guaranteed stealth. He hadn’t thought to bring comms because villains had been laying low and Tony couldn’t even remember the last time he was sent on a mission, no matter how silly.
“Are you mad that I left you a letter? Would you rather I dropped by to see my handiwork in person?” And the utter torment on Steve’s face was not anything he ever wanted to see. He didn’t even get any sick pleasure out of it. He just felt sick.
"I know." Tony hated the understanding in his voice.
Rhodey made a face that was somewhere between confused and exasperated. "Of course. You’re a genius, I think you should have picked up on that by now.”
“Hey, you remember when we were at the supermarket staring at the lobsters in the lobster tank? And I told you that they don’t feed the poor things and you were so upset that I offered to buy them all?” Tony asked seemingly out of the blue. He sounded rather amused.
“I won’t.” Steve bent to pick up his shield with a wince Tony didn’t miss, before extending it out to Tony. Tony reached out to take it dumbly, more out of reflex than anything else.
The first person he saw when he entered the compound was Peter, and his eyes widened marginally as he brought up his finger to point at the kid. “Don’t you have homework?” He demanded, softening only a little when Peter shot him a smile.
With Clint distracted, Tony turned his head to Steve. That smile was now aimed at him, which wasn’t unusual but made Steve’s heart skip a beat all the same. “Would you like me to catch you up? You missed some plot points.”
And then he took a step.
"I think you're just saying that." Steve murmured, obviously still enveloped in creating jumbles of scratch marks that would come together to be something jaw-dropping. Tony was fairly sure Steve was incapable of anything less.
“So, not the jacket?” Tony asked, a small smile daring to make an appearance. He tilted his head up, feeling almost jittery. He waited patiently for Steve to cobble together some sort of answer or make a move. Steve went with the latter.
“I know my limits. As much as I hate magic, I don’t understand it and I certainly can’t replicate it. I had to do what I could for Vision’s sake. For Wanda’s. I don’t know how many ways I can say it, I
“That’s the problem! Working on things isn’t actually
desk when he realized somewhat distantly that he really, truly hated the Accords. It was a wonder that it had taken him so long to identify the feeling.
Maybe he didn’t hate the document itself, but he hated everything it had brought on. And blaming a ‘living, breathing document’ as Ross addressed it, was easier than blaming a living, breathing person. A person he tried not to think about too much, but that was proving difficult when he was sitting in that person’s room. With that person's gift stuffed away in his jacket.
Rhodey must have caught on, maybe something in Tony’s face gave it away, or maybe Rhodey just knew him long enough to know when he was up to no good. Tony was leaning towards the latter. “No, Tony,
“God, I love you.” Tony murmured almost like it was just second nature, and Steve felt a smile fill his face and tug so hard at his cheeks that they ached from it. The way Tony said it, as if there wasn’t a doubt in the world, was doing things to Steve’s heart. Tony could say those three words everyday for the rest of their lives and it still wouldn’t grow old.
“I said probably.” Tony leaned into his touch for a moment before slipping away to get rid of the pot of coffee. Steve couldn’t have hid his surprise if he had wanted to.
“Nobody needs to be hurt, I just need the stone.” The alien smiled at him, wicked and pale, twirling the spear looking thing in it’s hand. It looked awfully sharp but Tony sure as hell wasn’t letting this thing get away with the time stone.
“Nope, I quit.” Tony told him, leaning back against the railing with a huff of breath. Steve grabbed his hand and Tony watched him warily, the shit-eating smile on his face was growing and that could only mean trouble.
“This isn’t about being Avengers anymore. Every single one of you is here to save the Earth, to save the universe. This officially goes beyond your petty fighting and differences, this goes beyond the team. You all need to trust each other even if you don’t want to. And you’re going to trust any new super people you meet. That’s how this works, Sam.” Fury placed his hands on the table, leaning over and giving them each a one-eyed stare. “Am I clear?”
“Can’t believe I’m saying this but I actually agree with you on that.” Tony hadn’t even minded seeing Clint, who had punched him in the face just seconds after seeing him.
“There’s no trust here, and a relationship can’t work like that Tony. One day, one of us is going to say the wrong thing and it will all implode.” Steve warned, and Tony knew he was probably right but he didn’t care about that either.
It wasn’t until an entire month of chaotic happenings passed that he truly talked to Steve.
He let out a trembling breath when he felt a small thud against his burning palm. A shiver climbed up his spine and he felt cold when he should have felt the warmth of relief.
Wanda had stared at him with an expression he couldn’t decipher, her jaw twitching. "I can’t forgive you, but I think I’m beginning to see your point of view.” Then she had walked away. Tony had wondered if he had Vision to thank for that.
Tony let the armor fall away from him again.
“See? Nothing.” Steve walked up beside Tony and stared at the stone as well. “A little flashy, don’t you think?”
“I still can’t really believe Dum-E ever pulled off that dance.” Tony murmured, in awe of the detail the drawing depicted. Steve always managed to blow him away and Tony could never see it coming.
During the second week, while Tony was down on Earth with Steve, they reverted back to their old ways. Truce momentarily forgotten.
“Maybe.”
“Thanks kid.” Tony murmured, reaching up a gauntleted hand to squeeze Peter’s. Peter smiled around the tears and squeezed back just once before turning away. Tony frowned, wondering if it was the bleeding upsetting Peter.
The city was awake without being intrusive and shining lights reflected on the canvas of the sky. It seemed a sight worthy of a photograph or a sketch.
probably want to get it all out in the open, and talk about feelings and whatever the hell but I’d rather not.”
Tony headed back towards the bar, hoping he didn’t look bad. He pushed his hair back and swiped his sleeve over his lips for good measure. He saw Rhodey sitting at the bar, and by the looks of it, he was playing a game on his phone.
Steve’s hands moved down to Tony’s belt, working it open and tossing it aside. Tony was about to mutter something about how Steve was awfully eager when his tongue slipped into Tony’s mouth and effectively silenced the words.
That's how Tony knew he couldn’t possibly be alone.
According to what was written there, Thor had come into contact with another one of the stones. Apparently it was even more powerful than the mind stone. Tony tapped his fingers against the edge of the table with an unstable rhythm.
“If we only have a night, let’s make it at least somewhat memorable. There’s a place I want to show you.” Tony dragged Steve’s head down to his ear, pressing a kiss to the edge of his cheek. “I missed you.” He whispered, before pulling away fully and straightening out his clothes.
They were coming back. They were coming back?
“We’re your favorites.” Steve commented teasingly as the elevator signaled that they were on the right floor. Steve led them to his room. Tony had designed the floor and had been there countless times but he was practically dead on his feet.
“I wouldn’t miss our anniversary.” Steve gripped him equally as tight, gentle but strong. His fingers dug into Tony’s sides, hard enough to hurt, but it only made everything feel more real. He lifted Tony off of his feet and Tony felt alive for the first time in almost a year.
“I’ll accept that.” Steve decided, and tugged at Tony’s hand, using it to draw him closer. “And I understand, I’m just a little frustrated.”
It was always going to end one way. Tony knew it, he was just worried Steve didn’t. Tony sat up, the sheets scrunched up on his chest falling into his lap. “I have a present for you.” Tony said, quietly, like he didn’t want to disrupt the night and the sleeping creatures outside the compound.
Steve shook his head adoringly, hand lowering marginally to settle on Tony’s head. His fingers absently stroked Tony’s hair, and Tony leaned into it, tilting his head back. Steve’s fingertips began to gently massage his scalp. Tony mumbled something under his breath about magic fingers that Steve only heard with the help of super hearing.
“What?” Steve looked surprised, which was more emotion than Tony had seen on him in a while. Tony was almost pleased with himself.
“I think I can piece it together on my own.” Steve assured him, handing Tony the coffee he he had forgotten he was still holding in his hands. Tony took it gratefully, taking a sip.
“Tony?” Tony’s head snapped back down at the small whisper of his name from Steve’s mouth. Tony almost wanted to smile and he felt the skin on his jaw pull in response.
He was free.
“Happy? I didn’t call Happy.” Tony frowned and turned his head to look at Steve who just shrugged in response, feigning innocence. “You used my phone. You're supposed to be laying low.” Tony felt a pang of worry.
It was just a soft brush of lips but it made Tony feel like he was attached to a live wire. Tony’s eyes were still open and he slowly lifted them to meet Steve’s eyes which were only inches away from his own. They hovered in each others space, lips close but not touching again. Their shallow breathing mingled in the space between them.
Rhodey finished wrapping the bandages and he tied the end of the gauze, patting Tony’s hair into something presentable. At least that’s what Tony was counting on. “I know I can be selfish, and I know I don’t say this enough but, how’s my hair?”
His second was to go down to the communal kitchen. He settled on the latter and the elevator took him down to the floor once he stepped inside. It was quiet when he stepped off the lift and that wasn’t unusual considering the time but it still made Steve feel uneasy. He was used to the bustle of the team lighting the room, but in the dark it was eerie and it made Steve’s skin crawl.
“Two. Can’t be a playboy anymore. You are totally and completely taken.” Steve curled his arms around Tony and shifted so his cheek was pressing into Tony’s curly hair. Tony obviously hadn’t gotten a haircut in a while but Steve didn’t mind it.
“Don’t apologize.” Tony put up his hand up to stop him from uttering the two words Tony wanted to hear least in the world. He sighed and walked out of the storage room, enjoying the fresh air outside as he did so. It was beginning to feel fever hot in the storage room.
“Oh, like I care.” Tony scowled, trying to contain the vicious anger clawing at his throat. “You can’t just a slap a band-aid on this.”
When he really thought about it, there was honestly no person he trusted more. And that was more significant than Tony wanted to give it credit for.
It sounded like the worst or the best idea of all time. Tony couldn’t exactly decide. Problem was that’s not what they were here to talk about.
Steve obliged, returning the kiss in a manner that could only be described as hungry. His lips were soft but insistent against his own, and Tony shivered at the fervor behind the movement.
“Always.” Steve swept Tony into his arms and away.
The light that had surrounded them seemed to fade into the shadows and as they headed back to speak to Fury, words were clogged in their throats.
__________
“Alright, feet out for speed and in to slow down.” Steve demonstrated and Tony watched him with raised eyebrows. He wasn’t going to be able to pull that off and he knew it but he couldn’t bear to admit it to Steve. He flashed a thumbs up.
“I know.” Tony waved him over and stole one last kiss. It tasted like the caramels his mom used to buy for him. Tony considered building some sort of invention that could make one moment last forever.
“I actually have a question, just to finally know before we get tossed into the heat of battle.” Tony took a small step forward, his eyes trying to figure Steve out. “Were you going to kill me?”
Tony whirled around. He would never not recognize that damn voice. He was aware, in the back of his mind, that he was much too tired for this and it would definitely end badly.” Yeah?” Tony wondered if he sounded as tired as he felt, and if he did, he wanted Steve to pick up on it and leave him alone before things got ugly.
There were rare occasions when he would wake up and forget he was in the future. He remembered fairly quickly, but those first few seconds would shake him to the core. On day’s like those, he wouldn’t leave his bed for hours and he’d miss his morning jog. He’d let his feelings out onto the blank pages of his sketchpad before getting up and starting the day.
Rhodey was probably teasing him because he had a concussion anyway, so he wasn’t about to take his words at face value.
But for all he could do, he couldn’t have predicted this. Because while Steve was good and pure, Tony was tarnished and broken. Because they could never agree on one single thing. Because in Siberia, Tony Stark thought he was going to die by the hands of someone he trusted for the second time in his life.
“Yeah, I think that’s some good advice.” Steve answered but Tony knew that was Steve’s biggest point of struggle. One day, when this was all over, Tony hoped Steve could make a new life. The one he always wanted.
“Like a gauntlet.” Steve picked up a piece of paper on the table and held it up, realization dawning in his eyes. The vague outline reminded Tony of his own gauntlets. And sure enough there were little divots where the stones would go.
?” Rogers punctuated every word behind gritted teeth, and Tony blinked at him. At least that was more like it, Tony had worried the old man had gone soft. He had his hands on his hips and everything. Tony took in the black Captain America outfit and frowned when he saw the star missing. He was seriously considering giving him a new name for his new suit. But actually, Tony vaguely remembered a new name, it was on the tip of his tongue but he couldn’t pin it down.
” Tony needed Steve to hear him. He needed a hint. After everything Tony had faced, he couldn’t bear this as well, and so he pushed forward.
Steve’s smile shined from his eyes. “You don’t know that I will help anyone cross the street.” Steve walked around the counter and helped Tony out of the stool he had been sitting on with a hand on his back.
"I wouldn’t do that do that." Tony turned his gaze back towards the city but it seemed less appealing now and he found himself turning back towards Steve. The piece of his hair that the wind was pulling at seemed somehow infinitely more important. It only reiterated something Tony already knew.
And Tony knew he had done it, even as he fell back and hit the ground. Even as his suit fell around him in shambles.
Steve looked hurt, like Tony’s words had sliced a cut right through him and it was a long road to recovery. His eyes were wide with shock. “No,
"It'll be worth it." Tony could tell from the sound of scratching against paper that Steve was nearly done. His strokes were longer, more assured. Just for good measure.
else. I mean, what if something had happened to you?” It was incredible how Steve could insult him and compliment him at the exact same time.
Tony shrugged. “I don’t care-” Before Tony could properly finish his thought, he was being dragged across the ice by an unbearably stubborn man that Tony had regretfully married.
“I could have helped the Guardians.” Tony could see moonlight glinting off his Iron Man suit in his peripheral vision and he knew sitting beside it was Steve’s old shield. Steve was already dressed up in his dark Captain America suit sans the shield. Tony had tried offering it back to him countless times. You can’t hold a grudge when death hangs in the balance. Thanos wasn’t a threat to be taken lightly.
"Enough of this. Where is Peter Parker!"
Peter winced when Bruce extracted another piece of shrapnel from his back. His patrol tonight had taken an unexpected turn and not in Peter's favor. He looked miserably at the closed door beyond which his dads were most probably arguing the whole spider-man shindig.
"Who's Jack?" Uncle Clint asked. Seeing an opportunity to tease them back, Peter jovially responded.
"Alright Bruce, what do you know?" Tony asked as he walked into the lab followed by the rest of the team. Bruce turned around in his chair, hands together as he tried how best to explain.
"Thank you, Peter. Can I offer you any other assistance?"
"Peter!" A small desert fox crawled out from under the blanket, jumping onto the seat beside Peter. "You're being rude! Introduce yourself."
"No!" Aunt May threw herself at Ben's side, trying desperately to stop the bleeding but only succeeding in spreading it over herself. Peter sat frozen with his uncle in his lap unable to look away from the fading daemon of his uncle.
I don't get why I get my ideas only in the evening. This entire challenge, I keep stressing during the day as I need ot think of something for each prompt, but it isn't until evening that I come up with something XD MAybe I secretly like the stress of playing it so close to the deadlines XD
I was convinced I was going to fail this day as I couldn't figure out what to write. Then I got an idea and still felt unsure of how to write it, but when I tried to make a start on it, it suddenly took on a life of its own and voila, I made it!
"Peter, what's wrong?" His pops asked him as he brushed the sticky hair from his forehead.
"I know."
"He could just be protecting his loved one's."
"Nice try."
Day 12, Prompt #12: "What if I don't see it?"
Steve was just turning back the bedspread when Qatara's ears shifted and her head came up turning towards the doorway. Basil came jogging into the room jumping onto the bed beside Qatara and promptly began cleaning his fur, clearly agitated. Tony followed suit clenching and unclenching his hands as he walked to his side of the bed and began to get ready for bed.
"Really?" Peter couldn't help smile at her which only made her blush more.
Day 15, Prompt #15: "That's what I'm talking about!"
Prompt #8: "Can you stay?"
Ned looked somber at his answer. "You really don't recognise me?" Peter shook his head, despite feeling horrible for admitting the truth. Clearly Ned had been expecting a lot more fomr this encounter. Had he saved him once and forgotten about him? "Could you take off your mask?"
"Actually yes. I'm not who you think." Peter took a deep breath before spilling his guts, figuratively. "I'm from a different universe."
By no means is there any medical or scientific knowledge here on my part. This is all just imagined knowledge to fit my story. In no means does it fit reality unless by accident. After all, I'm playing with fictional superhumans and aliens in this fandom :)
There were many strange looks sent his way before Clint spoke up. "Isn't that why you hired the kid in the first place?"
"Hey dad, can you look at this for... oh." It wasn't his dad. Staring back at him was none other than Captain America himself, more recently knows as his dad's future husband.
Rating: Teen and up to be safe.
Peter was breathing heavily by the time he stepped into the elevator of the Avengers' tower, his home. Cold sweat trickled down his back causing him to shiver. His stomach churned unpleasantly and he felt far too warm to be comfortable. As he leaned heavily against the wall, a familiar voice responded to his presence.
Peter noticed movement below and saw Kalyca unconscious on the floor of the car. Unfortunately for PEter his movements had gained unwanted attention from the dog daemons he could now hear behind him, from the trunk. The non-driver turned around, obviously alerted by his daemon and started at the sight of Peter being awake, as if he had not been expecting it.

While the four grown men argued over the supposed win, Peter turned to Ned as the frozen state of his friend was starting to worry him a bit. "You alright, Ned?"
Tony sputtered indignantly, crossing his arms as a defensive manoevre. "Of course not. I do not tear up at every single thing."
"What-" Happy again didn't get to speak as Ned continued, this time revealing the most damning information he could ever give up.
"Tony!"
Peter stood up to gain more height and proceeded to hug Tony. When he pulled back, he looked thoughtful. Tony didn't need to prompt his son to ask his question though. "Daddy, what does precious mean?"
Prompt #10: "Listen, I can't epxlain it, you'll have to trust me."
Clint stood up, now curious enough to join the discussion. "The only one who's been in the tower besides us would be, Peter. He came home about an hour ago."
And, he realized a tad on the late side, perhaps someone was using this kid to lure him there. If that was the case, he
Peter shared a look with Kalyca at her suggestion before agreeing. Keep it vague but no lies. "I-"
"I think something is wrong with me." He whispered brokenly. Sam silently agreed before grabbing a towel and wrapping up the soaked teenager.
Peter turned to his uncle and noticed the numerous collection of shrapnell already pulled from his body. Perhaps everyone's reaction wasn't exaggerated. He had shown up covered in blood and swaying where he stood. Bruce gave him a knowing look.
Before Tony could digest the words, Peter lashed out and drove a thin object into his neck. Shock overtook him as Tony dropped to the ground, his entire body shaking as he desperately pried the foreign object out of his body. His blood was everywhere and spreading rapidly and standing above him, actually smirking at him, was Peter.
Tony quickly stepped back into his suit before reaching for his son. "Give him to me, Steve. I'll get him out of here. You help the others get home." Steve nodded his consent as he glanced with clear fear in his eyes at his still unresponsive child.
Peter looked around as a feeling of familiarity came over him. Had he been here before?He edged himself around the nearest corner, ignoring his uncle's shout of "Hey wait for me!", as he slipped and struggled to get out of the water. When he caught up he seemed to deflate at the sight before him.
"I believe it can possibly influence or even control someone, but you seem unusually resistant to it. We could have a chance with such an advantage."
Peter carefully took the letter from his excited dad and as he opened it, he noticed all the avengers leaning in closer. Smiling at their behaviour, he moved back a little as he pulled out the letter. Except it wasn't a letter.
"I'm not sure, yet. I do know it's loose in the city, because Hydra lost control of it. I do have my own eyes and ears in the city." He added at Peter's incredulous look at the information he possessed. "The incident that injured the Captain, I believe it was this creature Hydra threatened the non-human avengers with."
The young boy tilted his head as he watched Basil, a tiny smile appearing before vanishing just as quickly.
Everyone's wings sort of disappear into their body, leaving a sort of tattoo on their back as a representation of their wings. When they intend to use them, they "invoke" them. This is how I'm calling it in my wingfic headcanon.
When Peter came to, he was no longer inside the bunker. The first thing he saw was a blue sky and some trees. Carefully getting up, he noticed he was on the outskirts of the city. The city, which was still standing and appeared undamaged from what he could make out from this far away.
The mission as it was called, was nothing like Peter expected. It was utter destruction. His family had launched at the guardians as their opponents had been called with no care for the city or its people. There was no delegation of jobs, just pure madness and chaos as his family tore the city apart trying to get these guardians.
"Or a bad one."
"We are looking for one Peter Parker and we have reason to believe he is at this residence."
"Mary? Both of them died?"
"Hey, Peter. Would you like to come inside for a bit? It's pretty cold out tonight and you look like you could use a warm drink. Do you like hot cocoa?"
Still, not all change was bad, Peter thought as he swung freely through the city following his spider sense to the current danger.
The peace and quiet was broken when Peter broke off the faucet, staring at it in horror while the water shot free of the plumbing. "Peter!" Peter turned defensively to Kalyca, "I didn’t mean to do it!" before blindly grabbing several towels and plugging up the broken faucet.
"Hey, Ned. Where's the kid?" Ned was frozen again. What was he going to do now? "Is that the kid's bag? Why do you have it?"

Tony backed away from Bruce, dodging Steve's reaching hands all the while taking a breath becoming more of chore. Peter was dead. His son was dead. And the last thing he heard from him, was his boy begging for someone to help him, to make the pain stop. Tony's legs gave way and he crashed to the floor in a heap. He didn't have the energy to push Steve away as he held him.
, and these two had the gall to try and keep it from him!?
Peter turned his head towards the sound, trying to see his uncle Scott. Though it was exceedingly dark, his eyes had started to adjust ever so slightly to the lack of light. Enough that he could vaguely make out the general shape of his uncle who Peter realized was pushing himself up from the ground, slowly.
Steve's gaze was clear and honest, there was no lie there. He truly was giving it his all and yet Peter was giving him a hard time. Scrawny, unathletic Peter was giving Captain freakin' America a hard time?!
"What happened?!"
"Norman!" The Vulture stepped forward looked concerned at Peter. "The Avengers won't stand for that. They'll come at us with everything they've got."
Thor moved forward, eager for a good fight, completely forgotten why he had approached Peter in the first place. “Thor stop!” Steve’s warning fell on deaf ears as the Asgardian strode towards Peter. Again Peter deflected his attack, pushing Thor away with one arm sending him crashing into the far wall.
"Why are you such a morning daemon when I’m clearly not a morning person?" It was a rethorical question, one that Kalyca answered with an eye-roll before cleaning her fur as she waited for Peter to finish.
“I know. I’m sorry. It’s hard to see them like this and even harder to know what they will go through.”
As soon as Peter was gone, Steve sent Tony a smug look. "Yes, I admit it, you were right." He answered the look, before making his way to his workshop to work on his son's suit.
"Not fair, daddy." Still smiling, Peter playfully pushed at Tony, but Tony was faster and stronger and lifted Peter easily upside down. He dropped him, gently, on the sofa before abruptly blowing a raspberry on his stomach. "That is one to make you squeal."
"What?! What's happened to her?"
"It sounded urgent. Is everything alright?"
Tony shook off his surprise at the fiesty daemon before putting his hand on Peter's head in a paternal way that was very unlike himself. He just did it on instinct.
The spell was broken the moment he saw his aunt go down, fast from the corner of his eye. With a cry of alarm he moved as if to leap of the bed and help her, but his pops held him back before he'd even gotten one foot on the ground. Bruce had lurged forwards and caught her before she could truly hurt herself and held her as to Peter's horror, she burst into tears.
"The whispers, can you not hear them?"
Tony and Steve looked over their shoulders at a very confused and concerned looking Banner standing in the doorway. Kalyca twitched once more drawing everyone's attention followed by Peter releasing a final breath of air.
"Peter? Can you hear me, kiddo? Peter?"
"A risk we're going to take. Spider-Man is not to be harmed, not even as a bargaining chip against the Avengers. That's not how we work."
destroy something right? Cause some trouble for the little ants?"
"Let go of my wife and get out of my house, right now!"
"Well, uhm.....let's just say there is a certain taste to it?"
else. Where do I sign?"
Though it seemed as if Peter would like a physical opponent if his fierce punches were anything to go by. Peter looked like a mess with his hair stuck to his forehead and his clothes plastered to his skin. How long had he been in here?
"Do I want to know why you are familiar with these sewers?" He asked Peter as he followed his lead.
Alarmed, Peter nearly toppled off the table. "They can't take Spider-Man from me!"

What had they done to him?
Happy prided himself on being Tony Stark's best friend and yet it bothered him that he had never been allowed on Tony's private floor in the tower. He could understand if it was private for all, but there were a select few people that had come and gone form the elucit floor, Pepper Potts for one. That had started many a rumour of her being involved with Tony Stark.
"Tony, it will be alright. Peter is a smart kid."
Rating: Teen and Up, again because of the warning I'm not certain is required but playing it safe.
"Listen to me, Peter." The serious tone of his voice gave Peter pause. "This is obviously a trap. He choose the time and place, he took someone you love- "
"If you want his trust, you'll let him in on your decision."
"But I -"
Warning(s): none.
"That's my name. Now can you explain how you know that? I don't exactly go around revealing that information."
"You got fanmail, Peter!" His dad exclaimed cheerfully, waving a letter in the air. "We checked it for all kinds of dangerous things, despite you being a fairly new superhero, but you can never be too careful. Now why don't you open it, because I am dying to know who your first fan is."
Peter looked up, surprised to see none other than Gwen Stacy approaching him. It took a moment for Peter to get his head straight and stand up to greet Gwen, who by then was looking at him with an amused expression.
"I'm sorry, Peter. We can't do that. I need you to calm down and let me help you."
Silence descended upon the room as they all let the words sink in. Eventually, Peter was the one to break the silence. "Can I say something? I think I've got an idea."
I'm so sorry for this being late. Yesterday really didn't work out for me, but at least that means you get two prompts today XD
Kalyca and Peter shared a look.
"I know!" Peter exclaimed, exasperated. "It's not always like this." He almost whispered after.
"I'm fine, these are barely scratches now."
His dad's raccoon, Basil, was walking back and forth on the back of the couch, leavinga brush of cool air in Peter's neck every time he passed by him. Qatara, on the other hand, was seated perfectly beside his pops, ears switching between up and alert and flat in the neck in concern.
buried beneath the seemingly casual words.
"Maybe he's just shy."
Peter would gladly stay like this for a while but his memory choose that moment to surface. "Uncle Ben!" Tony held him before Peter could run off in a tizzy.
"Ugh, what is that smell?"
Tony regretted it immediately but he waited a few seconds to compose what little was left of himself. But by the time he turned around to apologise, Peter was gone. Never had he hated himself more but he vowed to make it up to Peter when this was all over, when he knew his husband would be alright.
"FRIDAY! GET ME EVERYONE AVAILABLE!" Tony shouted as both parents ran to help their son.
"They had a son."
READ THE WARNINGS IN THE SUMMARY FIRST IF YOU HAVEN'T YET!
The elevator doors opened, alerting Tony to an unwanted visitor. He didn't bother to look or even get up. If anyone was foolish enough to bother him, on their head be it.
Hydra had gotten hold of an enormous source of power enver before seen and energy readings were indicating an explosion was going to happen and not just any explosion. This would wipe out the entire city if not more and Peter had been the closest to the base.
"Thanks uncle Bruce."
Like a sledgehammer against a wall, his emotions surged alive and he stumbled back as his legs turned to jelly. Both his dads reached for him but it was the solid wall at his back that caught him. He slid down in a rush, even as tears slipped from his eyes without consent. The first hand trying to offer comfort, set off a burst of anger so violent, it shocked Peter himself. A surge of adrenaline fueled by his anger, had him leaping up but he didn't get far before strong arms encircled him, restrained him.
Steve turned to look behind him and saw Peter standing in the doorway, holding his favorite dino plush under one arm and his comfort blanket in the other hand. "Hey kiddo, what are you doing up?" Peter quickly stumbled over to the sofa, needing a little help from his papa to get on it.
