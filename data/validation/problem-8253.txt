Nobody likes a whiny bitch after a session of great sex. But he’s pretty sure Steve’s worlds away from his previous flings so maybe asking for more than just a cursory wipe down won’t be such a big deal. Plus, he
"You did not just do that."
"If I'm good, will you wear the slave costume for my birthday?"
He works on maintaining a good rhythm, pulling up to the tip to tease the slit on Steve’s cock with his tongue before sliding his mouth down again. His hand follows his mouth, stroking the parts he can’t reach… yet.
In any case, even if he weren’t swamped with work, there’s no way he could’ve done anything to help the breakdown happening. It seemed to be mostly internal and Tony’s repeated calls to the guy had done nothing to garner a response, so he thought to give it some time while telling J to keep an eye on their guest.
Steve’s dick, which has shown interest from the moment Tony’s ass parked on top of it, is twitching and filling, and Steve can’t help but push Tony against the wall of the elevator where he can grind against Tony.
"I know…"
He's about to say
He looks at it, frowning for a second, before looking up at Tony. "Oops," he giggles.
Shuffling to the side pulls Steve from his thoughts and he looks up, momentarily disoriented. His tea is cold in his hands, and next to him Tony is sitting cross legged under a blanket, his fingers manipulating an image made out of pure light. Tony's face is lit up, his eyes shining and his fingers flying. He looks nothing like a dreaded summoner of demons.
Tony hears Steve as well when he comes closer, muttering under his breath.
is the absolute best he has ever felt, and Steve already knows next time together will obliterate that notion.
"Of course, Agent Romanoff."
Steve smiles politely, dreading what is to come, which is only strengthened when Thor takes a big step back.
Before Tony can nod Steve has picked him up bridal style and carries him off.
"See you later, Tony," Steve says after he steps out onto the floor.
Steven Grant Rogers plasters himself to James' side like a tick to a dog, except much more
It was barely used, the kettle, a gift his former butler had given him when he was shipped off to boarding school - a contraband that was a perfect symbol of Jarvis and Ana flouting the rules to care for Tony. He’d held on to it for purely sentimental value, busting it out only in the direst of times when he needed the comfort of the smell of steeping tea and a nostalgic routine that he’d learnt only through observation.
At James' question the robot beeps and twirls around in joy, and James smiles involuntarily. The second bot comes closer too, but gives the impression it half hides behind Dum-E.
beautiful,” Tony counters, feeling a slight flush on his neck at the expression of wonder and… softness on Steve’s face. Without thinking too much of it, he pulls off the undershirt as well, baring himself, bright blue reactor, scars and all.
about navigating.
Tony moves on Steve's lap so he's mostly facing out towards the table and leans back into Steve’s warm chest. It’s a more than comfortable perch to watch the game from and heckle the players, joining in on the “helpful” suggestions of which block to move.
And the best way to please the board and their military contracts is to build more sophisticated things that go boom.
The soft touches are making Tony come undone and he squeezes his eyes shut, trying to quiet the part of him that revolts at his gentle treatment, that says he doesn’t deserve this care, these soft touches, especially from someone like Steve.
Not like he’s been left with much else, he has no means of communication, no weapons on him, and he has a feeling that if he were to try to run the guy would probably have no issues catching up with Tony’s bruised ass - pun intended.
“Hey,” he says back, stupidly. There are so many things he wants to say,
"The tools…" Tony asks, looking around the workplace.
something
Steve sags a bit. He would've loved to team up with Tony, and he leans a little heavier against his boyfriend's (
“I love you too,” Tony says simply, and it’s perfect. With everything the powers that be have thrown at Steve, he still gets to have this, and he wouldn’t trade it for anything.
And please him it does.
Steve has to roll off to fetch the lube, and first applies a big dollop to his hand before lying back half on top of Tony. Next time he'll draw this out and see what noises he exactly can coax from those gorgeous lips. Now he wants to make Tony feel
"Wait, you think this isn't real?"
He pulls Tony higher to press gentle kisses onto Tony's face, causing Tony to giggle. There's still a bit of come on his chin and Steve licks it away.
“No, wait, I – Ix-nay, Jay. And you,” Tony points at the blond adonis, “how did you get in and more importantly, did you fuck with my surveillance inside?”
Swallowing the lump in his throat, he kisses down Steve’s neck, feeling the rasp of his five o’clock shadow against his lips. “I still can’t believe all it took to convince you to have your wicked way with me was some Asgardian booze,” Tony jokes, bending down to bite playfully at Steve’s nipple.
"They seem as surprised to be here as we are," Hawkeye remarks.
They fit together perfectly.
"Don't play Siri with me, we both know you don't go Skynet because you can't be bothered."
Bruce simply raises an eyebrow in response, “Give your doe eyes to someone on whom it might actually work, like your boyfriend.”
, shoulders. Jesus, when’s the last time he’s been hugged? Bucky had held him close but that had been during sex. Before that, Rhodey maybe? Sunset never wanted to hold him, and towards the end with Ty the touches were something Tony avoided.
and he takes hold of Tony's cock again to apply the slick from base to tip. When he's satisfied, he lines himself up and takes both of them into his hand.
“S’just JARVIS. He’s an AI - uh, a computer? Like a machine?”
"No, Steve," Tony protests, holding up his hands in defence as he backs away. "I had nothing to do with this, I'm just an innocent bystander who happens to invent appliances that run on vibranium and talk Mandarin when they're sleep deprived. Besides, it could be good for your--"
A few pulls and Tony’s close to coming. He grips Steve’s wrist, stopping his movements as he explains, “No - I - together, want to come with you, Steve. Together.”
“I shall.”
Tony nods silently, idly scratching James' scalp as he thinks. "Does it matter?" he asks after a minute, his smile a tentative and brittle thing.
Steve knows he should call for the doctor, but he needs to savour this moment for just a little bit before he does. Needs to soak up the warmth from Tony's gaze before he inevitably has to share Tony's attention again. Needs to bask in the knowledge that
“Have you been drinking long? Sorry I got late, by the way. I know you wanted to do dinner too but. Work. You know how it is,” Tony says privately to Steve as he reaches forward to place his empty beer bottle near the leg of the table.
guy was kind of a dick, a very very hot dick but a dick and also seemed all heavenly fire and brimstone and well, Tony wasn’t about to throw Bucky under the bus to save himself.
Tony barely looks at the time but he knows it’s been upwards of an hour, maybe more. He minimises the windows and places the tablet to the side.
rather than someone he just met today.
With that weasel safely deposited on new-SHIELD's doorstep, James hurries back, just in time to witness Steve and Tony's awkward goodbye in the common room.
Steve stares unseeing at the beverage in his hands, mulling over any hints he might've missed. Things his superiors have said or done to clue him in.
come off his hand. “You’re something else, Shell Head," Steve grins, and finally walks to the bed.
"Something wrong with my skin,
“Do you intend on repeating the events of last night?”
He pulls back to give Steve a wink, his hands having a mind of their own and running over his shoulders, down to his pecs, and lower still trailing along his abs.
Steve whirls around and whips out his sword in one fluid movement when suddenly there’s another male in the room, but he sees nobody. Is this the boy’s father? Did he bring the demon? Instinctively he places himself between the kid and the rest of the room, sheltering him from whatever comes next, as he scans the room for the next threat.
“As you can see, I’m a-okay.” Tony’s nose wrinkles at the unexpected assault and laughs with Steve, legs tight around his waist. “Onward, my faithful steed!” He calls out, raising a hand and pointing towards the elevators.
"You don't care if you live or die," Steve nods to himself. These are the most dangerous ones, in his experience. The greedy, the proud, the lecherous; they all follow a predictable trail, and are thus easily outmanoeuvred. The ones that have given up though, they are erratic and should be handled with care.
, like all others, had just wanted something out of him and Tony had served Bucky up on a platter cause he couldn’t control his dumb mouth.
Loud screeching comes from the portal, echoed by the group next to Steve. The group bounces over to the portal, except for one who converses with Thor in, for their species, hushed tones.
He could coo at the shy smile Steve and Tony give each other -- and with the way they both shoot him a glance he probably did. They aren't deterred, though.  Achingly slow they move closer until their lips meet in a chaste, but oh so sweet kiss.
Steve can't help the frustrated growl that leaves his throat and he wipes an agitated hand over his face. He's not equipped for this. They asked him for this case because he's one of the few able to best the Winter Soldier. This negotiating with sullen teenagers is
"That's using your resources wisely," Steve counters, looking up to wink at Tony. He likes the way Tony is around them, nothing at all like that horrid, fabricated rapport S.H.I.E.L.D. tried to shove at Steve. Tony is sweet and funny and caring. All else is just a front, and Steve knows what maintaining those is like.
"USO."
He nods. He’ll sort out later what it means that Tony gave him the power to decide over his life or death, for now he needs to see him and know for certain he’s alright. Steve follows a nurse through a maze of corridors and back staircases finally through a nondescript door.
them." At the word he tears the seam at Tony's ass apart with a grin, until the pants hang in tatters and Steve can reach Tony’s briefs.
A tinny voice comes from the little communication device that the kid dropped when he saw Steve. Without moving his sword, Steve squashes the thing with his heel. The kid's parents are out with the demon, and it won't do if the kid uses the device to call for their help before Steve can interrogate him.
“You’re in grave danger. We need to leave.”
"But how?"
He thought he knew the world but then Bucky happened, and now he doesn’t even know who Bucky
"We're a team!" he announces, squeezing Tony gently.
“Uh, what’s in the barrel, Thor?” Bruce asks, wariness in his tone.
) and his fierce blue eyes that glare at Tony like he murdered his puppy.
Once the water boils, he pours it into the two mugs, over the tea bags. It’s a part of the ritual too, imagining Jarvis’ indignation at him using tea bags, and the lengthy rant that might follow. He can never justify the necessity of buying loose tea given the rarity of their use and moreso it brings a smile to his face every time he does this to momentarily revive his oldest friend even if it is through a lecture.
On second thought… Tony consequently responded favourably when Steve acted soft…
"The arm always hurts," James states, ignoring Steve for now. If Steve is with James, and James wants him to be with Tony, then James needs a reason to be around Tony a lot. It's elementary. Everyone knows Tony Stark gets a hard on from any tech, so James' arm should provide an adequate excuse to stay down here.
He probably shouldn't. Maybe he can just give Tony a hug. Hugs are allowed. He loves Tony so much, and Tony gives the best hugs. Best everything.
Steve frowns and concentrates, willing to make sense of the disturbance. There has to be some kind of alternative explanation, because there was no indication this one would be sent out again… He tries to locate it, a pinprick of dark energy where none should be, but even as Steve focusses on it the energy changes, spiking wildly before dulling again.
And maybe, it’s the words, the way this being calls Bucky his friend, the way Bucky himself looked like he was carrying the weight of the world in his eyes even as he fucked Tony into the mattress, maybe it’s the kindness Bucky showed him last night when the world only showed its teeth but Tony wants to wipe this look off the guy’s face.
unharmed? What did he do… are you hurt?"
around him is almost on the painful side of too much. Almost. With the grip on Tony's hair he keeps him in place, until he is completely spent and collapses onto the mattress with a sigh.
Plus, he’s about 99% sure he can trust Thor to not poison their leader or otherwise harm him.
me and fuck you until all you can say is my name.”
this moment meant to him.
“Knowing us, I’m sure we’ll find a way,” Tony replies in amusement, before a yawn rips through him, the day catching up with him. He pulls Steve down onto the bed, lying on his side to not put pressure on the reactor.
"Preliminary scanning done," J.A.R.V.I.S. informs them before they erupt in bickering.
Clearly something has to be done. The sad face Steve wears whenever Tony isn't looking, grates on James' heart like a stun gun to his left arm.
"Those blocks are like toothpicks," Thor says, and ma Rogers woulda told him to stop sulking.
“J? You there?” He asks his voice hoarse and mouth dry as the fucking Sahara. “JARVIS?”
"USO," Steve mutters, rearranging the letters on his little shelf.
“Yeah, I see it.” Tony says, eyes trailing all over the man – flitting across bright blue eyes, pink lips, the killer jawline, broad shoulders, bulging biceps, thick thighs and then back up again – or is he even a man? Or is he like….
He hadn't known the Winter Soldier was bound by a book, and he's not sure what it means.
“Fuck,” he breathes out, dropping his phone onto the sheets and rubbing at his forehead. God, what did he do last night….
“How’s our guest, J?” Tony asks quietly as he grabs the two mugs.
After one hundred and seventy three hours of this James snaps and punches Steve in the face. He has lived alone for the better part of a year, this hovering is bad for his already frayed nerves. Now Steve looks even sadder than Tony, a look which turns even worse when James tries to explain you don't sneak up on a brainwashed assassin.
Even with Tony's outline of how the night could proceed, Steve doesn't want to presume- the pants ripping thing was to show off, okay- so he moves his hands back up and to the front to rest them on the top button of Tony's shirt.
The man's pitiful pleading stops when his windpipe is crushed with a satisfying crack.
What does it say about his life that the only people who see right through him don’t even exist on this plane of reality.
"It's okay, I'm glad you're here now," Steve smiles, and leans in a little to press a kiss to Tony's cheek. Because that's what boyfriends do. And Tony has the absolute best cheek, all handsome and soft. (His boyfriend!)
He’s a little surprised at himself at how easily he’s doing this for some preternatural entity he doesn’t even know the real name of, but Jarvis brought Tony into his ritual and used it to comfort him. So, maybe he’s only paying that forward. Maybe it’s the anniversary of Jarvis’ passing which Tony missed during his alcohol fueled misery party after the whole Bain Tech business last week. Guilt can be a powerful motivator too, he finds.
“So you’re saying whoever summoned him had the chance to control him using the book and if it’s gone, hypothetically of course, then he can’t be controlled. But can he be
He doesn’t even want to think about the way his stomach is roiling and his chest
"I love you, Tony Stark," he smiles. It's probably too soon to say it, but fuck it. He's not gonna miss this chance fate is kind enough to throw at him. Nothing like waking up seventy years in the future to install some yolo mentality.

Before Tony can reply, the guy places a hand on his shoulder and Tony stumbles as he feels power rush through him, pulling him in every direction. He’s barely aware of his hands bracing themselves on the guy’s broad chest and the firmness of said chest is the last thought he has.
"Spangles, cupcake, don't be mad." Tony sounds slightly out of breath, but not sorry in the slightest.
"Maybe Tony can help," James offers as a last resort. If Steve is occupied with Tony again James can sneak away. And maybe kill some things.
Tony takes hold of Steve’s wrist, pulling his hand away from his cock and leading it to his hair. “You can pull if you like, I’m into that,” he says, taking hold of Steve’s cock in his own hand, the other cupping his balls as he leads the head of Steve’s cock into his mouth.
“You’re welcome, kiddo. Now, you got something for me?”
"Son of a bitch!"
surface he can lay Tony on will do. As long as they’re both naked. And on top of each other.
Nat and Ginny smile up at him knowingly at his confused frown. Only next of kin are allowed to see someone in IU, he knows from when Clint came home more dead than alive from a botched mission last year.
Before anyone can react the cube flops forward and completely envelops Steve for a second where he can’t see, he can’t breathe. His team’s frantic shouts on the comm cut off and he’s surrounded by sheer joy and happiness and sweetness and then it’s over, the cube rolls on and hops after the others, leaving Steve
"Could but didn't, Tasty Freeze," Tony shrugs and rolls back a little way away on his chair now that the commotion has passed.

"Because you can tell by the way their blobness vibrates at the corner, right?" Tony snarks, but Steve can't afford to smile at the joke.

Bucky makes a reappearance, and we see something of Steve's past. Tony feels out of his depth.

Steve grins, pleased his remark made Tony all soft and happy again, not stuttering and grimacing like he was before.

“You know, I have a feeling you haven’t been to this world in a long time, not in the last few decades anyway,” Tony says, placing the wine bottle on the nearest surface and moving to the control panel.
it, talk to it. He’s totally gone on this man.
. Tony in the meantime, looks like someone kicked his puppy, and his puppy's puppy too. When Steve turns back -- blush so fiery James is tempted to upend a bucket of water over him -- Tony transforms his face back into something that resembles a smile if you don't look closely as they resume their walk.
“One doesn’t call Fólkvangr’s mead
He almost has to take a moment to send a prayer of thanks to a god he doesn’t believe in when Steve’s cock- large, red, sticky with his seed from his first orgasm, and absolutely gorgeous- swings out of his briefs and slaps lightly against his stomach.
-----
Biting his lower lip, he smiles slightly. “Yeah, okay, go for it, big guy,” he says, leaning forward to kiss Steve on his temple before pulling away from him.
Steve shoots into action. His boyfriend is hurt! He sits up while cradling Tony to his chest.
“Fuck….” He breathes out, groping blindly at the side of the bed for his phone. It takes another full minute of squinting at the phone through bleary eyes to access the seldom used home-control app he’d developed as a pre-JARVIS, and get the blackout curtains to slide shut.
"I can, you know," he says in between pressing hot kisses to all the parts of Tony's neck that are within reach.
He was certain that he’d done it, had sex with Bucky because he was attracted to him, because he was lonely, and he wanted to be desired.
"Well, I couldn't
It’s one of his closest guarded secrets, not even Rhodey knew about Tony’s little guilty pleasure. It’s his and his alone.
Steve’s brain flatlines, its already diminished capabilities completely down when Tony
Steve's not even sure who comes first. His third orgasm comes over him like a gentle tide, every nerve of him softly singing as he watches captivated when Tony comes as well.
They keep Tony in a coma for four days more. Somewhere an extra bed is moved into the room which all the staff politely ignores. Somehow there’s always leftover food just waiting to be warmed up when Steve emerges to use the restroom. That's the only time Steve leaves Tony's side, that and when they have to clean and dress the wounds.
I didn't immediately hear because they were talking in a dialect. This is most fortunate.
It's a nightmare. He has a hard time keeping them off him, their sharp pincers starting to wear down the inforced fabric of his pants and whenever he stomps two, there are three more skittering up the backside of his legs. Thor kills large swaths of them in one go with his lighting, and Nat and Clint punch small dents in the horde with the Widow Bites and 'Fun' arrows, but Steve is struggling and they’re wearing him down with their sheer numbers.
James nods and stands up at attention, in an odd way relieved someone tells him what to do.
), because Bucky is dead and Stevie is Steve now.
Uh oh.
If asked, Tony wouldn’t be able to tell how they got to this point. When faced with a mostly catatonic heavenly warrior, his mind must’ve run a subroutine he’d implicitly picked up from the Jarvises because somehow he’d strongarmed the guy into the nearest seat and left him there under JARVIS’ watchful eye as he dashed to the kitchen and started the kettle.
"I can explain…" Tony starts, though now that he surveys his surroundings he's not quite sure what made him think this was a good idea.
"J, cabinets, big ones," Tony orders in a rush, voice slightly higher than usual. Steve looks like he wants to crush James in another hug, but isn't sure he's allowed.
Tony takes stock of the man - nope, the angel? Really? Who knew angels were less Clarence from It’s a Wonderful Life and more Paul Bettany from Legion. Although, it’s a pity he’s not shirtless.
, but it's refreshing in a way he doesn’t recognize. He's used to being cold. Weapons don't get dressed, not even when they sleep in the coldest part of their master's fortress, but this cold is different, isn't bonedeep. It tickles the skin and makes his breath come out in little white clouds that are almost… joyous.
“Don’t worry, kiddo. I just wanted to tell you that the board meeting is taken care of. I gave them our usual spiel about you working on a new idea. And not a hint of your rager last night is going to be on the news, I’ll make sure of it.”
Only ten more steps to where J.A.R.V.I.S. keeps the elevator doors open, but instead of letting Steve go up in peace Tony enters as well and stands next to him like he doesn't reek to high heaven.
James watches over the good Captain as he recovers in the hospital, and notices the comings and goings of his team. He moves with them to New York, where they find residence in the most ostentatious tower (James secretly loves), and he cons his way into an apartment close by.
He moves one hand between their bodies, wrapping his hand around Tony's cock.
Steve maneuvers them midair so that Tony falls on top of him and not under, which he’s thankful for despite the high-end memory foam mattresses, since being squished by a super soldier once in a day is more than enough.
in green sticky slime.
" Steve laughs himself.
“We can’t just leave Thor here?” Bruce asks somewhere behind Steve as he overly carefully walks towards the elevator.
Okay.
He stands, and in four long strides has he closed the distance between them and is holding his swordpoint at the boy's throat.
The kid stands gaping at him, and Steve takes the opportunity to step closer until he looms over him. "You

“Good question, my friend,” Thor nods, and looks around the room to see if he has everyone’s attention before he pats the cask.
"They understand
"Captain!" Thor waves Steve to come closer.
"You're metal arm buddies," Steve chuckles.
,” Thor suddenly booms, sitting up straight to glare at Bruce. “If not for my respect for Anthony’s furniture, I would challenge you to a duel.”
Cupping his cheeks, he presses his forehead against his boyfriend’s. “Hey, babe, I’m okay. You didn’t squish me, I was just surprised. I’m all fine but I think you might be a bit too gone. What do you say we go back to mine and you can check me
Every muscle in James' body is suddenly strung taught like he's being electrocuted, and he looks around with mounting panic to search for the source of the word.
Tony looks up when JARVIS uses a pop up notification on his hologram that He-Man is out of his catatonic state. He’s still slumped in the same posture, his hands around the mug of tea and Tony’s certain that he hasn’t even tasted the damn thing.
"Hi," Tony answers, unable to muster more than a whisper with his parched throat.
to keep others safe.
"Got a lock on where they came from, I can open another portal to help them return."
"Sorry," Steve smiles, obviously not feeling sorry in the slightest.
Steve realizes at the same time as the demon that it isn't bound, and he watches with horror how it takes a step forward. It's then that the demon turns its head to gather its bearings, and Steve gets a full frontal look of its face.
"Double fine. Guess
Every attempt there's something that screws it up. A pigeon craps on the handwritten letter James -- disguised as a waiter -- shoved under Steve's plate; the Avengers alarm goes off when they're at the movies where James changed the scifi action flick into a romcom.
"I'm not mad."
Steve squeezes Nat’s hand and welcomes Ginny’s hug, wrapping one arm around her in relief.
Getting riled up, Tony tries to give weight to his argument by poking the dude in his rock hard chest for no other reason than the fact that his self preservation instincts, if they ever existed, have taken a long holiday.
Steve doesn't stop and suddenly lunges, pulling Tony tight against him. The absolute last thing Tony registers is the soapy, fruity mess he's now covered in, not with being pulled against naked Steve chest, and with beautiful Steve face grinning down at him.
Steve is barely aware he sags to his knees, his legs simply unable to hold the weight of the knowledge. In the clip the demon,
He didn't know what it was like to be a person anymore, couldn't survive without orders.
Tony groans and buries his head in the pillow, the pillow that still smells like spunk and ozone. It’s the overabundance of the physical evidence of the events of last night that won’t let him write it off as a whiskey induced hallucination.
Steve and Tony talk, there are some revelations, and the boys get a measure of each other.
"It's the tools too," James continues, emboldened by how his confession seems to bring Steve and Tony closer.
If it weren't for JARVIS' acknowledgement of both the intruders, he'd think he's lost the plot. Angels and Demons, what even is his life.
He's a little sketchy on the details, but in
," Steve smiles, feeling all warm and happy and utterly smitten. Tony is looking like the killer diller in his dress shirt and pants, his tan forearms on display with the sleeves rolled up like they are. Steve doesn’t know what it is about Tony with his sleeves rolled up, but he likes it a lot.
It was so logical at the time, but looking at the mess around him he concedes he might've miscalculated somewhere. What if he put lids on the bowls and decreased the power with one point four percent and--
James had a stroke. It's the only explanation. The trigger words triggered an aneurysm and now he's hallucinating or in a coma.
Odin punishes immediately, apparently.
Steve's whole being is set alight at those three words. He
Tony pushes himself off of the bed with a whine, and wraps the sheet around his hips, stumbling towards the door, carefully picking his way around the shattered glass and fallen over furniture. Damn, he had no idea this was the level of destruction caused last night.
“That was awful, Rogers,” he says as he wraps both arms around Steve’s neck, effectively ruining Steve’s cosy shirt with Tony’s overall chocolatiness.
Tony runs his hands along those incredible thighs, as he looks up at Steve, enjoying the hungry look he finds there. “I’ve wanted to do this for so long, wanted you for so long, and I want to give you this. I’m clean and you’re a supersoldier, we don’t need a condom. Will you let me?”
"The stakes are high," Clint grins. "Get it?
The bot chirps what sounds like an affirmative, and picks up his ball to wave it in James' face.
Steve Rogers is as perfect a human being as you can get, and it has nothing to do with the serum.
τιμή = Ancient Greek for Honour
It all feels awfully real, but pretending he could wake up from this gives James the ability to say out loud all the things he feels about the other two, and the smiles and blushes he gets in return are the best thing since mounted scopes.
"Tony! Come taste my Asgardian wares!” Thor calls out and the smirk on his face tells Tony that he might be fully aware of the innuendo.
“We're never talking about this again.”
"I don't think I technically count as alive anymore? Cause I died." He wonders if that's true for Bucky too, and realizes he knows nothing about how demons are created. Can't involve anything pleasant.
Steve nods. How can you say no to a plea like that? Steve can't. Not when this is something he has tried to imagine on innumerable occasions. His imagination never came anywhere near. He never could've known how Tony looks as he eyes Steve's cock, never would've thought Tony would all but beg Steve for the favour of sucking him. Never even knew Tony liked him the same way until only a few weeks back.

"You made three kinds of batters for me?"
Before he can even contemplate whether dragging his dehydrated body to the kitchen is worth the effort of gaining some refreshing, thirst quenching water – or if its better to just waste away but not have to move – there’s a series of loud knocks from the front door, followed by an incessant ringing of the doorbell.
Tony yawned until it felt like his jaw was going to unhinge, and then padded across the road and hopped up the shallower slope into a patch of fading sunlight.
“What can I do to assist?”
“Who’s Dr. Banner?” Tony asked, blinking rapidly against the spray of salt water. The captain’s expression turned from exasperated to confused. “You said I should go down below with Dr. Banner in the echo lab.”
Watching Steve carefully, Tony descended from his boulder. Steve’s ears followed his motion, but his lips stayed firmly over his teeth, and he didn’t snarl when Tony got closer. He tried to squirm away when Tony reached a paw out for his belt, but Tony swatted him on the chest. In reply, Steve snapped at tail. Reacting automatically, Tony swiped his face, and they both sprung away from each other – Tony more gracefully than Steve.
Head bowed, Tony stepped down from the doorway and onto a patch of scraggly shore grass that had clawed through the sand. He leaned back to look up at the fight going on far above his head. Iron Man and War Machine were bare specs against the gray clouds, but he knew the shape of their fingers, the curve of War Machine’s neck as he angled upward, the vibration of the suit’s thrusters pushing him higher and higher.
“No, darling. You’re perfect.” He slid into the space between Steve’s thighs, rolling his hips down to press their cocks together. Even through the clothing, it felt almost shockingly good. Steve’s thighs closed around him and squeezed his still-sore ribs. The dull pain was probably a good thing. “This is what you want, hm?” He shoved against Steve deliberately, just to hear the bed creak and slam into the wall. Steve made a noise somewhere between a groan a whimper.
she replied, craning her neck around to look up Steve.
Tony did show up for Old Horror Movie Night. He sat in the recliner by himself, and managed to stay awake. Clint and Steve got into a fight over the popcorn halfway through and it ended up knocked into the air.
Once the tom had gone, Steve and Riverstones laid down by the fireplace to take a nap, and Tony had found a sunny windowsill. After all the chaos of the morning meal, Tony was immensely grateful for the quiet. He studied the dogs while they all dozed. Steve was as big as Walker had been, and dwarfed every other dog in the village substantially, and was a moving mountain compared to all the other animals, except maybe the kangaroo.
“I can’t.”
From his new vantage point, he could see confused rats milling around the room, Steve fighting through the throngs of their bodies. They were no longer attacking, but they didn’t seem keen to get out of Steve and Riverstones’ way either, staring dumbfounded at the two dogs whenever their attention could be focused at all.
, Steve hurried to add.
“You’re really going to let that brilliant mind just die?” Steve prodded from beside him.
Steve’s ears swiveled side-to-side. “He’s a good friend,” he said finally, defensively, though he wasn’t sure what he was defending.
One of the dogs broke away from the group to meet Moonlight in the road. They touched noses, and then spent a couple seconds sniffing at each other’s mouths. The whole gaggle of puppies, even the sleepy little girl, went bounding over to them, barking out, “Dad! Dad’s back! Daddy!”
As easily as he had sprung into motion, he found stillness at the base of a thick branch. He sat down, comfortable with being motionless in a way that he hadn’t been for a long time. Stretching out along the branch, he balanced himself comfortably, and promptly went to sleep.
a computer. Tony clearly remembered hundreds of hours of coding, and putting together composites of dozens of voices, tweaking and pushing, and dissolving into sobs when he finally got it right).
“Sounds like fun.” It did. Tony loved those cheesy things.
They stared at each other for several tense seconds, before Tony finally twitched his ears and twisted around the groom his tail back under the armor plates. Steve could tell that he was still pissed from the tension in his spine, and decided to explore while Tony got himself sorted out.
. He threw the whole lot into a pillow case, humming cheerfully to himself as he did, and then tossed it into the suite’s small dryer, and turned it on.
A knock sounded at the door just as he was leaning forward to pick up his pen again. He clenched his teeth, and hissed out a breath between them.
. Tony blinked against Steve's shoulder, not sure what to do with the contact. He’d meant to drag Steve into a sloppy kiss, get a hand into his tight suit, and walk him back to the bed. As he stood there indecisively, Steve freed his other hand and reached up to grab the back of Tony’s neck. He scooted in closer until Tony was completely engulfed in his arms, and then leaned down and buried his face against Tony’s neck.
“We’re… well, we’re not from around here.” Steve wasn’t sure if he should tell her that they were from another planet, and that he wasn’t actually a wolf. For one, he didn’t know if she’d believe him, and for all he knew, humans were the enemy.
He managed to get the bag open at last, and found the kitten pressed all the way to the back of it. She trembled so hard that it looked painful, and smelled distinctly of urine.
“Give them to me.”
“That was silly of me,” Tony said, and crawled backwards off the mattress. He took a detour to refill his cup, and let Steve watch him drink it. The last of his headache had faded into a dull pressure behind his eyes, and the persistent ache in his joints and spine was fast on the way to joining it. He took his time stripping out of the borrowed clothing. He knew what he looked like, and he knew that he was covered shoulders-to-knees in bruises, but who knew? For someone like Steve, that might be a plus.
“I’m not really here,” Tony insisted.
“Come on, kids, jump down!” he urged. The girl who had come up to him hopped out readily, but the others stayed huddled in the back of the cage, shaking and terrified. If only he had hands. The girl huddled by his feet, reminding him of Nighteyes as she tried to get as close to him as possible.
“I can’t,” Steve said. He started to shake, body wracked with shivers that had nothing to do with the cold. His eyes rolled upward and to the left. “You don’t have to do this. Please.”
Tony was quiet for a long beat. Steve expected him to say something snide and swim all the way across just to prove he could, but Tony surprised him by hopping lightly onto the shield and getting comfortable high on Steve’s shoulders. His chin rested on the top of Steve’s head, and his legs splayed out to either side of Steve’s neck for balance.
Tony was trying to come up with a decent fight to engineer when he felt a gentle brush of warmth against his hand. He looked down at where his and Steve’s hands almost touched, and then up to find Steve looking back at him.
The door opened, and Tony’s company came through shield-first.
Tony let his breath out slowly so he wouldn’t snap at Bruce. It wasn’t Bruce’s fault that looking into that impenetrable darkness had driven Tony’s heart rate up until he could hear it thumping against his ear drums. He cleared his throat and reported all the findings he didn’t have. His own voice came out so softly from lack of air that he had to clear his throat to repeat himself. Bruce kindly did not ask how he was handling it, and Tony tried to pretend that he was handling it just fine.
“Haven’t I done enough?” Tony demanded. “Haven’t I crawled through enough shit to deserve to just… stop?”
Steve pulled Tony's other wrist over and bound it to the first. He watched Tony with almost unnerving intensity while he did so, barely glancing down long enough to be sure the knot was fast. Tony couldn’t be sure if Steve was daring him to protest, or watching him for any sign of indecision. He couldn’t guess which one Steve wanted more, or if he’d put Tony out of his mind altogether, if maybe Tony was just a body for the moment. Steve leaned over him, dragging the belt over the edge of the desk, and taking Tony’s hands with it. He let his weight rest on Tony’s chest as he looped the belt around one of the desk’s legs. Steve was heavy, and the weight of him pinning Tony to the desk was enough to drive his breath out of his chest. He gasped in sips of air, trying to hold as much of it in his lungs as he could, but he didn’t ask Steve to move, and Steve didn’t offer. The RT couldn’t be much more pleasant for Steve than it was for Tony, but he didn’t seem the least off-put by it. Adjusting the angle of his spine, Tony hiked his legs further up Steve’s hips, and held on tight.
It was still some distance away, but Steve guessed that they would reach the outskirts of the village within the next hour. He looked up at the sky again.
The smaller dog sneezed.
he ordered.
closer to home? Your friend Colonel Rhodes is nearly ready to tear my arms off it’s taken so long.”
getting in between Tony and someone who needed a thorough re-education about the nature of the universe.
Dr. Winslow flinched back from him and then squared her shoulders and glared. “It’s
Tony automatically dropped back into the grass, heart hammering, and then made himself look up again. The dog was laying on its side, and obviously still breathing. It had a great mane of pale, fluffy fur around its neck, but the rest of its body was a darker color, and the fur was shorter. It also had a strange pattern of vertical stripes down one side.
There was a brief pause, as though the suit were considering the request, and then he was all at once assailed with scents. Overwhelming, a thousand different messages filtering in through the vents from the unique scents of his travelling companions, to dozens of piles of animal shit in various stages of decay, vegetable matter living and dead, and a dark, dank, musty scent that was what he imagined being trapped in a coffin would smell like.
“I wasn’t laughing at you. If you had any kind of idea the sort of day I’ve head, you’d see why that was funny. Steve, I can’t give you a new support team. The personnel problems we are dealing with right now would make your head spin.” Tony leaned back in his chair, and might have continued, but Steve’s eyes had gone flat. He was so obviously not interested in the details of Tony’s problems that he may as well have said it out loud. “Suffice to say, you are going to have to find another way. What are the problems?”
For a second, she looked like Natasha (who was Natasha?) and Tony pressed his hands to his eyes until she reverted back to Emily Winslow. “Sorry,” he said. “Maybe I’ll just go… lay down.”
“What about Loki?” Steve asked immediately, expecting that whatever magic let him hear Strange would work in reverse.
Tony needed 5 minutes. In a battle, he knew that might as well have been a lifetime, and it was asking for a lot. Still, Steve’s answer to “I need 5 minutes” should have been something better than flying a jet right into Galactus’
Tony curled over and put a thickly mittened hand to his head. He might as well have been naked for all the good the winter clothing was doing him – he was chilled and soaked in sweat under his parka, and probably smelled like piss (goddamn wet wool), and his stomach was hugging his spine.
Tony followed after him slowly, and the moment his knee touched the mattress, Steve’s legs parted without so much as a glance of suggestion. Tony laughed delightedly. Steve’s immediate reaction was to pull his legs together, but Tony reached out and caught him by one knee.
“Get these people out of here!” Steve shouted over the wind, but Clint and Natasha’s responses were barely more than blips in response.
“Whole new meaning to ‘don’t bite my head off.’” Tony started snickering to himself. He yawned hugely, and looked up to see the sun filtering down through the trees. He twisted back in the direction that Steve had gone off to with the wolf, and then down at the ground. It was a nice spot, and he could use a nap, but his teammate had wandered off with a stranger, and Tony should probably be more worried about that.
“Dr. Winslow,” Steve said, gesturing her over with one hand. “He moved his foot. I was talking to him, and he – he moved.”
His voice echoed inside his helmet, and Steve just looked at him sadly.
“…Tony?” Steve said hesitantly. He tilted his head slightly, and said, somewhat nonsensically, “Standby.”
out of touching Steve while they talked, and grinned when Anthony’s eyes narrowed in on the not-exactly-casual contact. Tony watched his pupils dilate, the bob of his Adam’s apple as he swallowed hard. Steve flushed and Anthony looked away, and it was sickening how gone they were for each other, and almost sweet how oblivious they both were. Judging from the look in Anthony’s face, Tony didn’t think he was even aware of it, and who was Tony to judge? He’d been intentionally blind to more than his fair share of things in the past.
re-engaged and he continued forward like Tony wasn’t sitting up in bed wearing nothing but a pair of tight red boxer briefs (“I feel a little foolish about keeping that secret from you till now,” he remembered saying, standing in nothing but a thong with his armor stripped away, Steve’s shocked expression as he realized that his friend Iron Man was Tony Stark, and Tony terrified that shock was bordering on anger).
“This’ll be cold,” he warned. He could have taken the time to warm it between his hands, but he didn’t. Steve gasped at the first touch of the lube – not all that cold, it had been in his pocket after all – and then held his breath as Tony pushed his middle finger slowly past the ring of muscle. Steve’s body clamped around him like a vise, so tight that Tony felt the circulation cut off to the finger. He twisted his wrist, curled his finger just right, and Steve let out an explosive breath, somehow clamping even harder around him. Steve’s hips thrust up automatically, and he threw one arm over his face.
Steve couldn’t feel his lungs expanding. He couldn’t feel air around him, pressure against him, or a sense of falling. There was no up, down, or sideways. He flailed his arms and legs, but there was nothing around him for purchase. He squeezed his eyes shut, and then opened them so wide that they hurt. The blackness was so complete that he couldn’t be sure that they were really open.
“You could stay,” Tony offered stupidly, haltingly, one morning. The sex hadn’t been angry, hadn’t been the result of fighting, they were just both there and the tower was otherwise empty, so why not? If there was any time he was going to ask for it, good-mood-fucking seemed like the best option.
, Tony muttered.
Tony shook his head to clear out the last of the dream, and blinked at her. She wasn’t that tiny – actually she was probably 5’8” and her hair was a dishwater blond pulled back in a tail. She had hazel eyes and Jolie-lips, and a decidedly Scandinavian cast to her features. He looked around suspiciously, but he was back on the boat, standing in the echo lab. The ocean crashed against the portholes and slid away, very close to the waterline, but not under the surface.
“Sit down, Captain Rogers!” the voice snapped. Pain cracked down Steve’s spine and his ass slammed back into the seat hard enough to make the chair rock. Clenching his jaw, he tried again, but he couldn’t convince his legs to take his weight. The chair shuffled a quarter of an inch backwards.
Across the table, Tony sobbed, wide eyes filling with moisture that spilled down his cheeks and made the blood and dirt run. He shifted in the chair, trying in vain to push away from the table.
He felt a curious mix of agitation and sorrow as he tried to make Tony understand that he was just protecting them. He was often frustrated by trying to convince Tony that he was doing what was best for them as a team, but maybe being out alone on an alien world was making him even more protective of his teammate. It was important that Tony understood.
“Sorry, Cap,” Tony whispered. He couldn’t hear Iron Man’s response through the comms, but he didn’t need to. He closed his eyes. “I’ll take it from here, Rhodey.”
Steve said, yawning,
He stood to go, and Tony couldn’t suppress a snarl of frustration as he shoved himself to his feet. Steve whirled at the noise as if he expected Tony to attack him, and they ended up staring at each other like starving predators defending territory.
It was dark when Tony finally got his brain to reboot after a dozen failed attempts. Sensation came back in a quick cascade - a building tingle in his limbs that rushed from his fingertips and toes inward and upward, and then heat, aching joints, tears pooling at the corner of his eyes, pain in his throat, swollen tongue, swollen fingers, dull discomfort at the inside of his elbow, the weight of the blanket on his thighs, the pressure of the canella on his face and the tickle of the prongs in his nostrils. The sound of the heart monitor, the sour scent of antiseptic, and a bitter metallic flavor at the back of his throat. A hundred minor complaints registered all at once up and down his body, all demanding his immediate attention.
By the time the leather was finished and the stain set- by the time the shield was complete, his hands shook as his vision waivered. His sweat was clean of booze, and his body felt heavy as lead and like it was hollow at the same time.
G*psy and other racial/ethnic slurs used in period manner.
Stevie is, as usual, a complete dream, dark hair a little halo of wisps around his head, sleepy and nestled easily against the curve of Bucky’s rapidly growing belly where he is gumming his omo’s shirt enough to leave a messy wet spot. The two others are what have him mildly stressing being alone with the babies. The eldest, their little Annie, is wrestling with the fancy “always stays sitting up” teddy bear slightly bigger than she is, and the fact that at nine months old she is winning the battle to pin it says a lot about her heritage. She gets a lot of her stubbornness and fighting spirit from her Alpha. Theo, sweetheart that he is, has had to be pulled away from attempting to disassemble the roomba three times now. With his strength, he’s already managed to break three of them but the intelligence displayed in wanting to see how they work just delights both his parents too much to be annoyed at the destruction. Bucky, as always, is more worried that somehow Theo will hurt himself with the pieces.
Steve snorted “We were platonic, Tony. He was a child when we met. A man to his people, but a child to ours. You know this. We both talked of this with you. And you needed us... and we needed you. Despite how you shoved us away, that never changed.” Tony’s gorge rises, that horrible nausea and choking feeling returning.
Steve doesn’t snap back at him, and doesn’t let it stop him cleaning Tony as if he were some toddler that got into mud. But as Tony can’t muster the energy to really care, let alone do it himself, it goes without mention.
He could fight- but if he did, every blow would be mirrored. Every shot would be taking out parts of himself too raw and fragile to bounce back, no matter his serum. If it was fight, or the world. If it was fight or Stevie dies… he would, of course he would… but it would be his own death.
Tony felt that coiled burning ache behind his lungs, itching and scratching under his eyes. It was all he could feel, as it just kept growing, constricting his lungs and leaving his jaw clenching. “He’d be alive without me.” Tony spits, stomach roiling.
Another two episodes later, he was getting the package from the front door.  When he turned off the TV, all three children stared with huge eyes as he showed them his order. “New bath toys, but you can each only play with them if you don’t fuss about the bath.” He signed along as he spoke, and Stevie shrieked, but Annie and Theo both nodded eagerly. The bath was a rousing success, as was the new nightlight. By the time all three were asleep, Bucky had ordered a bunch of new toys and looked up similar shows. He was excited for this Fraggle Rock show, while Teletubbies was a bit simple, he thought he could really love the puppets of the other show.
The first rays of light find them, naked and curled together, their soul marks now raised and thick. Tony traces them, ideas for the armor, for a suit of golden yellow wreathed in red, to match the red and blue on Steve’s shield. They were never going to have Bucky in their bond, but they would also never be without his touch, without his influence. A little brother to one, and a teacher to another.
. He was become Gregor, if only emotionally.
Steve’s hands moved to Tony’s wrists. Pressing over the soul marks, over the connections that anchored their fates as intertwined, that said they, somehow, in some way- belonged together.
Tony slinks back into the lab and pulls up Bucky’s tumblr, wincing at the most recent reblog. “Whooboy.” He mutters, and he really can’t be sure if Bucky is trolling Steve or honestly confused, but either way he knows Steve is going to need a whole lot of punching bags and drawing supplies to work out the upset.
“Tony, say you will join me- that you want this. Please.” Steve asks it softly, searching Tony’s face, and Tony, can’t deny him. Not with how his heart hammers, with how he can feel the pulse in both wrists, can feel the phantoms of those hands- not on his wrists but on his chest and shoulder. He swears- those touches- are what marked his soul, echoing back to his birth.
Poor Bucky is out-numbered and all alone with the super tots.
The starter that pushed Bucky out of MCU and a world with no Omegaverse, into the DCU as an omega.
“We may not be able to save the world, but we can rebuild it.” Tony finally manages, his own hands twisting in Steve’s hold, palms from both sets of hands covering the other’s soulmarks.
(See the end of the chapter for
Bucky blinks, and then grunts, “Huh. Guess that makes more sense than her trying to make a coat out of them. Wait till I show Steve.” He begins to leave the room, when Tony finally realizes what Bucky just asked. He jerks back, bashing his head and burning his hand, all while shouting. He stumbles from the bench and is pulling his finger up to suck it as he desperately scrambles after the already departed Bucky. “WAIT, NO COME BACK! Why did you ask that???”
The pain struck him as an after-effect, the screaming wails that escaped him nearly inhuman as he struggled against the pull, sinking into the shrinking portal as if being eaten alive while he struggled against it’s sucking tide. The last thing he saw of reality for an eternity of pain, was that cat suit man charging at the portal and stopping short as it was barely wide enough for a hand but sucked at him like an exposed vacuum.
Oh, how Tony felt a fool. How Tony felt the sins of every lauded “victory”. How he dug into the reports, how he had sought anything to disprove the halfblood liar, instead finding only the damnation of ever more proof. Now he had his sins laid bare, an accounting he could not turn away from in any measure...
Bucky wasn’t ready to die. He wasn’t ready when the German Forces knocked down the door. He wasn’t ready when he dashed across the rooftop, desperate to be away, away, anywhere but here. He bashed into a strange gargoyle like statue on the corner of a roof, crumbling it as he ran from the strange superhuman man in a cat themed suit. Between one step and the next, he was enveloped in swirling pink and green so lurid it seared itself into his eyes.
He hammered through the nausea, and he sweated out the booze another drop at a time. The air was hot, a fetid stench of rancid sweat, of booze burning out of him mixing with dried old rusty blood. He worked the metal, shaping it a shame, a death, a sin at a time. His eyes watered from the fumes as he plunged the metal into the water, steam billowing up alike fog from the lake near his childhood home.
The music was, interesting. The singer was, not the best to his ears, sounding almost like that awful forced mid Atlantic accent Carry Grant would sometimes use. All three of the babies were used to Bucky singing when he put them down for naps. It was, like magic. All three were nodding off, by the second repetition. Bucky carefully paused the show before the children’s cheers, taking up singing in his own husky barritone, all the slowest old melodies of his own childhood. He sang, and the children slept, and over the next hour and a half, he finished the sweater, and sang while keeping an eye on the children, working to make them all strips of banana and chunks of hard boiled egg whites, and a few other little soft things, like steamed carrots, thankful all over again that none of the children had developed any allergies yet.
But also notebooks filled with his struggles to recapture his good memories. Recapture his childhood, his joys, his Father’s people and their songs, and what he had learned of him, of the joys of the world in the smallest things. Of loss but fragile hope, always crouched with- “if you can re-find these- you can re-learn these things” and other notes horrifying in their implications, especially when paired with the other notebooks.
Bucky had been acted on by outside forces nearly all his life. And here- he was in hiding. Here he was not safe- but here, he felt, he was as complete as he had been since before good men took his Papa from him just because they thought his skin and music made him bad. Before Gypsy was a word Bucky applied to a dead man who had been his mountain and guide.
Okay- PLEASE do comment with if you guys want this as it's own fic, I can start moving all the RP over ifthe Diana player is okay with it.
He didn’t deserve kindness, especially. “I need a good hard boot to the ass- a punch to the teeth. You of all people-“ Steve barked at that, though his hands didn’t become harsh, “Won’t have you telling me
Debating spinning this off on it's own with just, pure fluffy sweet Omo! and Dad! ficlets. Thoughts?
Tony pulled the curving metal out, staring at it, before setting to finishing it.
with the puppies???”
And the man that facilitated it- the son of the man that supplied Andrew Jackson himself, that had funded these horrors before- sat drinking in a dark smithy with cold ashes where a heart once stood. Useless and worthless like the still and quiet ruins of his heart. Instead of doing something- he had let the world pass him for a full year of wallowing, would still be wallowing in drunken stillness, or dead if not for the events of the day before yesterday.
It was less of a comfort, when his father was killed. When Bucky had stepped up to be the man of the house. His Ma remarried, a gentile man, with hair as red as fire and a temper to match. He never laid into his sisters or his ma, especially not his new, youngest sister. But there was nothing Bucky could do right. It seemed only natural that he spend more and more time over at the Rogers. The memories stayed roughly happy there. He lived more like a brother, helping Sarah and Steve, caring for Stevie when he was poorly, and keeping him out of the worst of his scrapes when he wasn’t.
A family, with Tony and Steve at the helm- guiding and shaping them together, each taking up the slack for the other without thought of when to step up, dancing as naturally together as any ballerina could dream of.
“You may stink, Tony, and- you may be still covered in blood... but you need me.” Steve said softly. The gentle tone left Tony rubbed raw. He didn’t deserve pity.
He breathed out through his nose, jaw clenching, his gorge rising in a copper tang that left him glad there was nothing but bile and booze to come up.
Pure unadulterated Babies ad Omo fluff.
Because he woke to “uh-oh!”s from his kids, hugging each other and giggling together as they pretended to be Teletubbies. He had a recipe for Tubby Toast to try for breakfast, and the day was gonna be a lot of fun, even if it was just him and the babies all day.
Anthony Stark had built weapons the world had never seen before. The smoothest action, the easiest reloading. The best accuracy. Explosives. Canons. Guns. Rifles. He built the repeating fire guns that shredded horses, men, children and bison alike. He built the weapons that even now, were being used to slaughter.
If their hands strayed to each other, and their lips lingered in kisses, perhaps, it spoke to their closeness. Or perhaps it spoke to how they both know- with absolute certainty, how much the other means to them. For how close they both came to losing the other, before they ever came together. One to the bottle and inner demons, and one to the violence of man against itself.
But it’s too late by the time the soundproofed lab doors swish open, because down the hall, Steve’s voice is getting that high, squeaky outraged note as he yells “She wanted to do
Teletubbies is offered, and Bucky eagerly turns that on by saying “Play the Teletubbies from the first episode.” He is grateful all over again that their house has all these automated tools to hand. It takes Theo a bit to realize the TV has something for him, but ever attentive Annie whips her head around at the first giggle of what looks like a baby in the sun. She plops down, the high pigtails of her curly hair making a perfect pair of stubby wings for the bear as she uses it for what it is intended as- a place to lean and rest. She stares up, enthralled, and Theo joins her as the strange showerhead looking things push up from the grass. By the time it is focused on the clip of a child pushing himself around on a bike, Theo has crawled his way over to his sister and both babies are leaning on the bear, sharing it’s back support as they watch. Two dark heads of hair, closer to black than brown, rest against each other till their hair blends. Both children are nearly silent as they watch. The tools the little blond boy uses have Theo wiggling and making “same!” in ASL again and again.
He made up a large shared plate for the two, and a smaller plate for Stevie. He knew it was a bad idea to have let them nap so long, and letting them eat here in the living room was further setting a bad precident… but, just this once, wouldn’t hurt. Bucky trailed off singing, and settled the sippy cups of juice before each child. Prince Anthony(Ann for short) for Theo, the bright purple cup showing the first male omega princess, and his older sister, the first Alpha Princess, Elsa, for Annie. Bucky had discovered the power of Disney, and if it didn’t cause fights sometimes, he’d use it more often.
Then- there was only the feel of every molecule being split open and put back together. It was the only way he could quantify the unending wave of pain that moved up and then back down his body. He fell through colors he had no concept of, things his mind could not grasp but his eyes, enhanced as they were, swore were real. He was terrified that this was HYDRA’s new plot. That this was punishment and preparation. He never wanted to fight again. He just wanted peace. He wanted to rest. He wanted to make cookies and sing the songs he had spent his time there memorizing and learning. He wanted the pain to stop. He wanted to do whatever it took for this nauseating horror ride to stop.
Tony swallowed again. “You had each other.” He reasoned, the argument old and worn in his own head.
Tony let the hammer strike the red hot metal again. His heart was pounding still, and if he stopped, the shaking of his hands would make him scream. Four hundred women, children, true innocents, in every way, between just three of the dozens of massacres he knew of. Tens of thousands of bison. An entire way of life, THOUSANDS of people starving, dying because of him.
His heart was no longer ash. His body was no longer flesh. The boiling print of blood on his chest, over his heart, would never wash away, for he could feel it sunk into his very soul. Could feel his sins radiating from it to pulse through him, the molten lead where blood should be in a man.
“Tony? What’s a Furry?” Bucky asks, tilting his tablet back and forth, as if trying to decipher something.
Bucky has never been so grateful that Stevie is, for all intents and purposes, a standard human, with the only traces of the serum’s effects being a slightly faster healing speed and a boosted metabolism. Bucky is desperate, and, since his saving grace, Maria, is out right now, Bucky does something probably a bit dangerous, and asks the Television “What is good for Babies to watch?”.
Romani Bucky features heavily in this verse. No understanding of the Roma or Romani culture is needed to rasp this, I think, but if something needs clarified, please do let me know!
In summer when the other children ran wild in the sun growing nut brown and wild, Bucky never stood out. He laughed and ran and played. In the winter, though, when even the swarthy Italian bambinos began to lighten towards milk, Bucky always retained a bit more of the summer’s tan. When he asked about it, his father put his own hand, much darker, next to his, and told him that unlike his sisters, he had inherited more of the sun’s love. It had comforted him at the time.
Tony carried his tiny burden out of the cave with Redskull’s shrieks following behind.
Using his grip on Steve’s wrist, Tony pulled him forward. Steve’s arm came up around him automatically, and
Tony commented when he straightened up, but he didn’t wait for Steve’s response.
Tony asked obstinately. Steve grunted, got down on his belly, and scooted his way closer to Tony’s side.
“You do
Tony hopped down and sauntered in between them to interrupt what looked like a brewing, baffling fight. He intentionally smacked Steve in the face with his tail, and then sat down between his feet.
“Who the hell are you? Tony Stark has been confirmed at a board meeting in Manhattan, so you better drop the damn act!” Steve growled, advancing with the shield held up like he was one wrong word from caving Tony’s head in.
“Mr. Stark,” the captain said from somewhere behind him. His voice was growing both weary and pleading. “Go to the medbay.”
“Always,” Tony quipped, giving Steve a backwards wave on his way back to the first of the black puddles. He stopped just at the edge, and seemed to just stare at it. His shoulders were tilted opposite to his hips, and the set of his helmet suggested he was trying to look away.
“Tony?” he asked uncertainly, some of the fight seeming to go out of him.
ing sound low in his throat, great big head ducking down. Tony felt a growl settling in his chest. He knocked his left paw into the back of his right foreleg. The crowd pulled away from him as the armor
Steve hesitated. “I’m still angry.”
That was fine. It wasn’t like he hadn’t struggled down a hallway by himself before.
On the dais, a man stood, naked to the skin save a tangle of grotesque jewelry. His face was a parody of human features, twisted and sharp, with a strange texture, and an odd brown colored head.
Riverstones said in a rush.
His paw found a stone protruding from the otherwise smooth surface, and then the wall gave a shudder. It ground slowly open to reveal the two canines waiting eagerly at the entrance. Steve darted in so quickly that he nearly bowled Tony over, and Riverstones followed right on his heels. They both halted a few strides into the corridor, noses going into overdrive as they sniffed the air. After a moment, the door slid shut with a muffled.
the ghost of Rhodey’s voice replied. “
The dogs’ house was at last quiet. Getting breakfast prepared had been a study in chaos. Tony had found himself a perch up on a shelf that kept him out of the way of the puppies, and had watched the scene in claustrophobic terror. Moonlight had quickly put Steve to work hauling cuts of meat out of what Tony guessed was an underground cellar. While the puppies had chased her with increasingly shrill demands for food, Moonlight had pulled the slabs on meet onto a hot stone to cook.
!” Tony screamed back. He tried to get up, but his knees just gave out. He was weak, and cold, and
The laugh exploded out of Tony’s chest before he could stop it. Steve reared back like he’d been struck, and Tony choked it down. He held up a hand to prevent Steve from storming out, and took a slow breath to re-center himself.
“Jarvis?” Tony croaked, and then stopped because Jarvis was at home with the Avengers – no, dead – no, an AI – no, Vision (Vision?). Tony was starting to unravel, he couldn’t keep anything straight. “I’m fine!” he called out breathlessly. “I’m fine.”
Tony looked over to him and found a tunnel of green light stretching across the floor and disappearing through the curtain. He understood immediately that it was to funnel the kittens out of the caves so none of them tried to bolt down some dark hall. The rats had been shoved out of the tunnel’s path, but were starting to move with more confidence.
“Wait!” Wasp said, voice tiny and high-pitched and fast, “Don’t you recognize it? It’s the famous red, white, and blue garb of Captain America!”
Tony huffed out an annoyed breath, and Steve repressed a yipping laugh of his own. Tony might be even smaller, comparatively, than he usually was, but Steve didn’t really want to go up against him when he was so wound up. Tony had always been so cool under pressure, that all the growing and hissing was new and delightful. He got the distinct impression that the wolf was fascinated by Tony and trying to get him away from Steve’s side.
Moving very slowly, Steve slipped his hand under Tony’s. When Tony didn’t pull away, he laced their fingers together. “Will you go on a date with me this Friday? Nothing fancy,” he added quickly, still whispering. “I thought we could talk? Out of the workshop.”
“There you two are!”  Strange said. His words seemed to come slowly, as if they had to pass through a sheet of water before being morphed into barks. Tony’s head twitched, and Steve wondered if maybe the words sounded like meows to him. “Universe number 213. You couldn’t have stayed a
Steve didn’t react to the outburst and Tony panted through a dozen breaths that whistled through his throat like swallowing chips of ice. He turned a frustrated circle and came to rest with his back to the hospital bed. The heart monitor became slowly audible under the cadence of his breath.
Tony laughed, and took another sip. He let the alcohol sit on his tongue until it felt like it had burned all the skin in his mouth off, and then swallowed it deliberately. He watched Steve watching him, and smiled when Steve’s eyes caught on his throat. Tipping his chin up just to be obnoxious, he swallowed again. Steve flushed.
Fury turned his body to make an inviting gesture back toward one of the giant automobiles. “Come with me, and we’ll get it figured out.”
, Tony complained, watching him from afar with an obviously disgusted grimace.
Sitting down, the wolf let her tongue loll out of her mouth. “You’re the one in my territory,” she pointed out. She was obviously amused by Steve’s display, or maybe by Tony’s much smaller form next to him. They probably made a strange picture.
Good enough. Tony put a hand on his pelvis to hold him down to the bed, moved into a position that would put less strain on his forearm, and went to work. Steve was fantastically responsive, his entire body twisting and pushing while Tony worked two, and then three fingers into him.
Steve stopped flinging himself around like a mechanical bull…
“No!” he yelled, suddenly panicking and not sure why. “No. I’ll be right out.” He didn’t even know who was on the other side of the door and suddenly couldn’t remember who else was on the ship, except the captain… captain … he had a name, Tony was sure. Dr. Banner – no, Foster –
half-buried in the snow (did that make sense after seventy odd years? No, not seventy-odd, it hadn’t been that long. Just fifty? Maybe only twenty-four? He couldn’t keep it straight.) He finally managed to choke down the mouthful and hit himself hard in the chest to clear his airway (the reactor, Jesus – except, it wasn’t there. He didn’t have a heart problem, he’d never been to Afghanistan – no, Vietnam).
“Hey, it’s okay, you’re safe now,” he said softly, and then tore at the rope with his teeth. The kitten inside meowed piteously and began to shake. Tony started to purr just to let them know that he was still there, gnawing and tugging at the rope, annoyed all over again that he didn’t have opposable thumbs anymore.
“Mr. Stark,” the captain said (why couldn’t Tony remember his name?) “I really think you should see the physician.”
Tony just shook his head. “I’m fine.”
Now that Steve was closer, Tony could see that the uniform was vastly different than Tony was used to, but it looked good on him. Wasn’t that the point? If Tony’s brain had dreamed Steve up, it had done a lovely job with the wardrobe. Looking wary, Steve knelt down next to him and lifted a flashlight. Tony moved out of the bright beam, and snaked a hand under Steve’s arm. Steve jumped, but didn’t immediately decapitate him when Tony boldly set a hand on the inside of his thigh.
He couldn’t make himself say
Tony started to laugh. He’d beaten cancer and had it come back to chat with him. He’d been stupidly in love with a very straight WWII relic who didn’t like him very much for years, and had watched him get eaten by a world-destroying titan. He’d died to save the world, and he then gets to wake up in a basement with his mouth tasting like stale cotton balls. He lifted a middle finger toward the ceiling.
Alone in the woods, Tony tried to make sense of where they’d landed. The lack of color vision aside, the world was vibrant with sounds and scents that he couldn’t find words to describe. He gave into the sudden desire to run up a tree’s rough bark. He almost fell off from the weight on his back, but recovered with thoughtless ease, finding that place again where his body moved with seamless coordination.
Steve let his breath out in a gasp of relief. His spine felt liquid in the wake of that dry, sharp sound, his guts twisting. “I’m fine, it’s okay,” he stammered.
, or wait for Steve to say one more word. Tony closed the bathroom door gently behind him and rested his shoulders against it. He ran the shower as hot as he could take it and stayed under the spray until his skin started to hurt.
, and he forced his lips to cover his teeth again. His heart fluttered so hard against his ribcage that it almost felt like some kind of fainting episode, but he managed to sit upright.
“Pull the trigger,” Kilgrave snapped, obviously and immediately angry that they’d taken their attention away from him.
Tony meant to shout, but instead heard himself exclaim in shock, “The Wasp is right!”
Steve jolted as if he hadn’t remembered the kittens, and then hung his head in shame.
“Good idea,” the captain said sagely and watched Tony half-climb and half-slide down the stairs.
“Your friend is lucky to have you,” Riverstones observed.
, he grumbled while Tony laughed.
Tony’s breath caught in his throat as his orgasm rippled through him. His hips took on a life of their own, snapping forward once, twice, and then shoving hard a third time and locking into place against the curve of Steve’s ass. Steve came again, all but sobbing through it, body twitching weakly in time with the pulses.
“Mommy!” she cried softly, and then again, “I want mommy!”
“We won. Come back with me, and we’ll get you straightened out.”
Tony’s legs opened and fell away almost before he’d decided to obey. He heard a soft whine of noise, and realized it had come from his own throat. Heat flushed up his face that had more to do with embarrassment than the lack of oxygen. Steve gave the belt a sharp tug, and then slowly pushed himself upright again. Tony tested the knot himself, and found that even when he pulled with all of his strength, he couldn’t get it to budge at all. The length of the belt kept his arms back at an uncomfortable angle, and forced his back to bow while the edge of the desk dug mercilessly into his forearms. He could already feel the steady heat of pain building in his lower back from the position.
Tony’s feet dropped back to the floor with a dull thump that recalled the spilled coffee mug. He struggled to swallow and breathe at the same time, and ended up somewhere in between the two. He cleared his throat, becoming more and more aware of Steve’s seemingly uninterested gaze the longer the moment stretched. If he really wanted to, Tony could flip himself over the desk. The height of the desk and the lack of leverage meant he might do damage to his elbows, and would land off balance and mostly on his knees, but he could do it. He prodded at himself in a mute question to see how far Steve would have to go for Tony to make an effort at freeing himself. The answer was disturbingly grim.
Steve bore him to the floor in a chorus of truly nightmarish snarls and growls.
. “I’m just tired. Ignore me.”
“Having fun?”
“I will,” Kilgrave promised. He sounded very reasonable. “Just put that cute little red dot…” The fingers of his right hand walked down Steve’s chest to rest over his heart. “Right here.”
Or the universe where his weapons were responsible for thousands, hundreds of thousands of deaths, and he let it happen? Where his every effort to rectify his mistakes just compounded the problems, and his own ego knocked him off his feet again and again, where he and Steve were at each throats as often as they had each other’s backs?
It was the captain, not Rhodey (Of course not Rhodey, James Rhodes was a classmate at MIT, and they were friends, they were best friends, but Rhodey wasn’t War Machine, wasn’t a colonel, wasn’t on the expedition, didn’t know Steve (yes, of course he did, he was a fucking Avenger, he’d been Iron Man and Iron Patriot, and he’d rescued Tony in Vietnam – no, Afghanistan. He’d been employee, friend, ally, adversary. They’d fought together and against each other, and rescued the president,
