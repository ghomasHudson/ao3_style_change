“Okay, I can’t do this much longer, I have work to do. Just give me those damn papers and I will get them to him.”
Steve stared at the body, at the lifeless form and it took him a while to realize that he was not frozen in place, that he was in fact staring at a video clip that was frozen until he wasn’t. Until brown eyes moved in his line of sight, worried and so deep that he felt drowning in them. Slowly he registered Tony’s hands on his face; then his words, calling out for him.
“Yeah, for some reason graveyards don’t do it for me,” Tony replied with a huff before he pulled out his phone again. But instead of blueprints and schematics he pulled up a video feed on his phone. It didn’t take long for Steve to recognize the view. He saw the woman, but his gaze was drawn to them. Despite Tony’s misgivings they looked right, like a couple. And suddenly Steve realized how perfect Tony fitted at his side, how much he liked the warmth where their bodies touched. For a moment Steve got lost in the picture of them, but then Tony started working with it, cutting out the woman’s face and throwing it in some kind of search engine. At least that’s what Steve thought what he was doing.
“Oh my god, Jamie, stop!” Once again Zola was thankful for her dark skin, at least her embarrassment wouldn’t be that obvious. Then she caught Barton smirking at her. Or maybe it would. To spies. And anybody knowing her.
Zola looked up when there was a knock on her door. Kevin Miller stood in front of her, waving some documents at her.
She had enough dignity not to run out of his office. But when she was in her own, she cursed the glass door. Right now she would have preferred a wooden door to hide behind. Or at least be invisible.
“You know, if I’d known about those perks of the executive floor, I would have fought you harder for this promotion.” They both knew this wasn’t true, Jamie had no patience whatsoever for the bureaucracy that the executive floor required.
“Jarvis, turn up the heat please,” he croaked and was grateful for Tony’s efficiency in all of his tech. Almost immediately he could feel a stream of warm air ghosting over his skin. God, he hated being sick. Since the serum him being sick usually meant some battle wound, but he hadn’t felt so weak in years. More than seven decades actually. He wanted to be angry at Thor for infecting him with his Asgardian flu but couldn’t bring up the energy. Instead, he just curled himself up and tried to go back to sleep.
“I know, I know. Believe me I know. For some reason she can’t see the sexual tension between the two.”
Tony parked the car in front of the hall and they both walked the few steps to the main entrance, every step accompanied by the soft clicks of the Iron Man armor assembling around him. As soon as the gauntlets were on his hands he raised them defensively, and Steve adjusted his shield from protecting them both to his standard ‘prepare for combat’ position. He could see Steve checking the perimeters but apparently found nothing.
Tony had to have heard something in his tone, because some of the compassion in his gaze was replaced by curiosity.
Steve flashed him a smile, before he turned serious. “You are probably right. This can’t be a coincidence. The universe is rarely so lazy.”
It was definitely late morning or early afternoon, when Steve heard the door silently clapping. He opened his eyes and saw Tony putting down a steaming mug. Herbal tea, from the smell of it.
Steve let out an exasperated breath at the lack of clear answers, almost tempted to avoid the serious talk they were apparently having. But the he decided to be brave, he had been braver for stupider things. He could do this.
“You are Nat ... I mean Ms. Roman … I mean Ms. Black Widow. It’s a real honor, I’m a big fan.“ He stood up to shake her hand.  Black Widow took it and allowed the shake.
She snorted at the disbelief in his voice, but wasn’t surprised by it. Too often had he painted himself as god’s gift to women, thought that his money and his connections made him interesting and attractive. Almost never listened to her, regardless what topic. If she was lucky she received a condescending explanation why she was wrong. Whatever it had been that she found attractive once, right now she just wanted to leave.
“Yes, you have to come, Daddy. How is Papa going to be healthy again?” Peter had lifted his head and looked at Tony.
Steve was not surprised when the video footage appeared. On the screen he could clearly identify Tacle as the one approaching Clint.
“Yes,” Steve sighed. “So now we are down to two Avengers to protect New York and they are the most unexperienced ones.”
The first thing he noticed when he came back to himself was Tony. Tony stroking his back tenderly with one hand, the other steadying him at his hip, his head leant against Steve’s. Vaguely he wondered where Tony had cleaned his hand, but felt too sated to really care. Instead he raised his head and looked at Tony who smiled at him softly.
It took a while until Marisa searched in her bed for tissues, blowing her nose loudly, while finally putting some distance between her and Steve. When she seemed composed enough Tony repeated his question.
The traffic light changed to red and Tony used the chance to look at Steve. He saw the slight blush on Steve’s face.
Steve stared at the pictures in front of him. One taken from before the battle, her and the pram, several mugshots of her and the last one clearly taken in a morgue.
The sudden blast of repulsors was the most beautiful sound he had ever heard and the only warning he got before the weight dragging him down disappeared. A moment later a metal clad hand wrapped itself around his middle and steadied him while he tried to step on Iron Man’s shoes.
It wasn’t the startling realization it might have been. But it also wasn’t the first time that he had thought about kissing Tony. Only this time it felt as if it was a natural progress, as if he could just get up from his seat and take those two or three steps to Tony and just do it. He waited for, well he wasn’t quite sure, what he waited for, maybe the voice of reason telling him ‘no’. The nervous flutter of his heart, warning him that the wish to kiss may be one-sided. But while he watched Tony giving his frustrations a voice, nothing happened. Instead he remembered every warm smile, the lingering touches, the compliments.
“Then those monsters attacked. And I watched the TV because what else could I do. But when I saw it, when I saw the baby and I knew it was Cullen, I knew it. How could I not recognize my baby? I didn’t know what to do, I wanted to hide but what about my Cullen?”
“I can read,” she interrupted him. “And I’m pretty sure, Mr. Stark can as well. Just give them to me, I don’t have the whole day.”
“’The view’?” Ori gave them a dubious look. Originally from Hawaii, he continually complained about hideous buildings as well as the lack of palms, beach, and surf.
As far as aliases go Edward Krats was certainly not the most elaborate, but it had the advantage that it had been in use since his childhood, when his father and Obie wouldn’t want the world to know that a mere child was responsible for some of SI’s inventions. Instead Edward Krats had been created and now when the board and the public both had requested rather loudly Tony Stark’s withdrawal from Stark Industries it came in handy to have another genius in the backhand, especially one who had already worked for Howard Stark. A little voice modulation and rerouting phone calls on his part, a little story telling on Pepper’s and everybody was eager to believe in the existence of another genius who preferred no personal contact whatsoever to his employer.
“Calling Dr. Banner.” Steve could hear the disapproving undertone, but apparently Jarvis had detected that nothing would deter Tony from this course of action. Once again he tried to turn around, this time mobilizing all of his strength. It was not much and by the time he had turned his head to look at Tony, the man was kneeling in front of the bed and looking at him with worried eyes.
For a moment he wasn’t sure if Tony had heard him and with a every second passing he felt more and more insecure. The other man was staring at him with an unreadable expression; before he suddenly crushed his mouth to Steve’s and then bolted upright.
Tony paused. Pepper was indeed not a technician, but she usually worked as his spokesperson to the board, selling them his ideas. But since Ultron Pepper had a harder time getting them to follow her lead. They had questioned every single one of her propositions, questioned her judgment. The fact that the public did the same didn’t help. Public appearances of them as a couple turned into media spectacles and Pepper had a hunted look in her beautiful eyes that he had never seen before. It was then when he decided to take a break, to disappear from the public eye. And it was the final straw to their relationship. Tony was by no means an expert for interpersonal relationships, but he knew Pepper, saw that she wasn’t happy and that he was the reason for it. When he offered the end of their relationship, he had seen the relief behind her tears.
“No, you didn’t. It wasn’t your fault,” Steve tried to calm her down, but the sobs just grew stronger.
He started climbing on the beam were the hostages hung, slowly edging nearer, when one of the tentacles slung himself around the beam and pulled. With a horrible sound the beam broke and Steve could only barely catch himself from falling. He looked at the other side of the beam where the three women hung, all three of them unconscious. And all three of them were slowly sliding down the now broken beam. In an instant he calculated the odds of him jumping to their side and stopping their certain fall to death. He looked for Tacle and then took his shield, throwing it so that it would end up in the beam as a blockage for the women.
It was strange for Steve hearing Tony being relatively formal to his new AI. With Jarvis he had always been playful, but there was still something missing in Tony’s relationship to Friday. But then Jarvis had been around Tony for years, it was hard to forget something like that. Maybe it was some kind of grieving mechanism.
“Nothing really unexpected. Just almost sent Thor to Asgard to fetch one of their healers to treat you for a common cold. I mean we didn’t even call them when Loki drenched us all in some magic flower potion.”
“This guy went to extreme lengths to stop you. He did not kill you, he used yourself against you. And if it’s indeed your blackmailer than he also contacted you personally. I don’t know, Cap, it sounds as if you’ve made yourself an enemy.”
“Yes,” he confirmed and stood up. “What about you?” He closed the distance to the armor, raising his hands to feel Tony’s warmth and chase the image of the lifeless armor away.
She suppressed her sigh. He wasn’t the first to ask for him and at the moment it looked as if a sign ‘Morgan is gone, there is no replacement’ might actually be a good idea.
“Oh, thank you Mr. Krats. That’s good to hear. Listen, I’m sitting with the board right now, they have some questions regarding the StarkPad based on your last specifications. Since I’m not a technician I thought it would be best if you could explain it directly.”
Steve took a deep breath. “Letters that claimed if I wouldn’t step down from the Avengers I would regret it. I didn’t took them seriously at first, but after …,” he faltered, “well, after this incident,” he gestured to the screen, “I received another letter, saying ‘I told you so’ that it wasn’t over.”
“So, is this going to be awkward and in the end we will be avoiding each other and be terribly polite. Or …”
It was a delicious torture, slowly and delicate, but with enough variation to keep Steve right there on the edge. What little coordination he had left, he concentrated on getting Tony naked or at least touching his skin. He managed to rip his shirt, so that he had access to Tony’s collarbone and let his head drop on his shoulder, inhaling Tony’s scent and pressing open mouthed kisses to his skin. His fingers dug into Tony’s hips when a particularly delicious stroke brought Steve nearer to completion.
A few weeks later she saw Stark and Rogers leaving Stark's office. Rogers had one arm around Stark's  waist and she could see them smile happily at each other. She looked after them until they disappeared behind the closing lift doors. She was about to turn back to her office, when a hand pushed between the closing doors and Tony Stark looked out again.
“He said the only thing left for me to do was giving Cullen a lovely farewell with flowers and a marble angel on his tombstone. But …,” she pointed helplessly at the rest of her flat, “I couldn’t afford that. I can barely pay for this hole.” She bit in her lip.
“Oh, yes, I know him. He is a pain in the ass. He is also a member of the board of SI, kind of inherited the place from his father. His father was a Senator and also a board member, and only when they changed the law regarding extra-income for Senators, son quit his day job at the Pentagon and became one of SI’s board members.”
With a last look at Tony, still unmoving and covered in the remains of the tentacles Steve started to climb to the roof. He could feel the shift in the beam as Tacle used one of his tentacles to pull himself further up. A long jump and he reached the trap door to the roof and was through it in an instant.
For some reason Steve had missed him the most, even though Tony had been the one to leave even before everything had started to fall apart. Or maybe he was the reason why everything was now a big mess. Maybe Tony had been the one to tie them all together. Steve had thought of contacting Tony, but didn’t know how, didn’t know if he was still allowed to. And now he was standing in front of him and it was such a shock in the best of ways.
“Oh, I’m sorry, Ms. Potts. I was just collecting my thoughts,” Tony returned to conversation smoothly, “so, gentlemen, what are your questions?”
Steve had given up all attempts at silence and concentrated only on his progress, but in the back of his mind he registered the noises of repulsors and metal beating against metal. It didn’t sound good and when he felt he was safely out of reach he risked a glance at Tony.
It took too much effort but he managed to rip his mouth away from Tony, staring at him, at his dark eyes, the slight flush, the swollen and moist lips. “Are you sure,” he asked because now he needed to know. Tony simply rolled his eyes and lifted one of his arms to bury his hand in Steve’s hair before pulling him again down on his lips. His ‘yes’ was whispered into Steve’s open mouth.
Several heartbeats after Friday’s announcement both he and Steve stood still, too surprised to say something.
“You are a genius and I’m an idiot,” he declared when he almost ran out of the bedroom grabbing his trousers on the way out, leaving Steve lying in the bed wondering what the hell had happened. Steve was pretty sure that this declaration had nothing to do with their previous discussion which was confirmed by Tony’s next words.
The lifeless tentacle sprung back to life and grabbed Steve and dragged him slowly over the edge. Steve tried to get up, to resist the movement but the tentacle kept him immobilized and Steve only managed to grab the corner of the roof to keep himself from falling, his finger nails drilling in the concrete. He tried to wrestle out of the arm, but he could feel himself losing his grip.
“Maybe you could describe him to Captain America.” Out of the corner of his eye he saw Steve suddenly turning to him.
He had no idea how long he slept, but when he woke up again, it was to Tony entering their suite. Steve tried to greet him, but every muscle in his body protested, so he just stayed where he was and hoped for the best.
“Yeah, but they camped on the front lawn, figuratively speaking, they didn’t have anonymous sources.”
They had been kissing. Rather passionately if she was any judge. Steve Rogers leant over Stark who lay on his back on the sofa. One of Stark’s hands was in Roger’s hair, she suspected the other clutching at Roger’s shirt. At least both of them were still clothed. They both looked at her with different mixtures of shock and embarrassment (Rogers) respectively amusement (Stark). As if the position on the couch hadn’t been clear enough, their red and swollen lips screamed ‘We had just kissed’.
Steve had a tablet in front of him, already studying the layouts of the building they were heading to.
Yeah, Tony knew this, too. All his instincts were telling him so, but he tried to be more careful about his instincts and better check everything twice. Still, the niggling feeling in his head was hard to calm down
“It’s the code I installed in the StarkPhones last year and I really don’t know how many lines of code I’ve written since then. Besides it’s a self-learning code. The original code was made by me, but the system adapts to the needs and wishes of his owner. And don’t worry I didn’t make murder phones.”
But the worst part were the three figures hanging above Tacle from the ceiling. Tony’s heart clenched as he recognized Pepper and it took him a moment to identify the other two women: Marisa Rhys and Tammy Lynn Richardson.
Tony lifted his head as if to confirm this statement. Steve expected him just fall back on his chest, but instead Tony stretched to press a light kiss on his lips before he watched him searchingly. Steve had no idea what Tony was looking for but didn’t have to wonder long about it.
Since then they kept their distance, talked only on the phone. But sometimes, when they were not talking as Edward Krats and CEO, but as Tony and Pepper, he could already hear the same lightness their friendship had before they made it more. And in every photo he saw of her, she looked – maybe not happy – but content. Declaring the break-up publicly helped her getting her standing back and by now it seemed as if the board was back in her hand. So her request was a little surprising at least.
“My baby, Cullen, … He was dying. The doctors … there was … there was nothing they could do … the medicaments didn’t work,” and one of the tears broke loose. “They said he only had two weeks left. Two weeks! He was a baby. How could he only have two weeks left,” she sobbed and tried to breathe calmly. “And one day somebody contacted me on Facebook, said there was only one thing I could do now.” The tears were flowing freely now.
“Why are you so nice? You had to disappear. I did that. I made Captain America disappear,” she sobbed in his chest.
“It was that or thinking the whole time what I could have done differently. And I did that most of the other time so every distraction was welcome,” Steve explained, turning serious half-serious again.
Steve smiled. “I’m feeling much better.” And he did. No headache, no freezing. And his voice was almost back to normal. Tony touched his forehead.
It got the meaning across, although Tony didn’t seem convinced. “It can heal broken bones but not a runny nose?”
“He wanted one day with Cullen’s body. He said he wouldn’t do anything to it, wouldn’t harm it. He promised and I … I said yes.” The last bit was whispered.
It took only a few seconds before another flood of pictures and information was spread out on the screen.
Steve’s expression turned thoughtful, but before he could say anything, before Tony even knew if he wanted to know they were interrupted by Friday.
“Can you describe him? Or do you know his name?” Tony tried to distract her, but he could see that she didn’t hear him. She just cried and sobbed against Steve’s chest and Tony could relate to that; knew how it felt to keep the tears burning in your eyes to yourself, wishing for Captain America to hold you.
“At first I refused to listen to him, blocked him, but he was persistent. And then Cullen was gone,” she looked at Steve with tearful eyes, pain clearly written in the lines around her mouth, “and the mortician was so cold and he barely looked at Cullen and he would offer me nothing more than a glorified shoe box. And I couldn’t do this. I couldn’t let my baby be buried in something like that.” Her tone was pleading now.
“Yes, you have,” Tony confirmed. By now he was hovering directly over Steve. “You make me feel young because the last time Rhodey and I lived together was at MIT.” Tony’s eyes were dancing over him as he pressed a small kiss to Steve’s left eyebrow. “You let me keep the Avengers to play.” Steve’s amused snort was somewhat muffled by another small kiss, this time to his cheek. “You bring me coffee.” The kiss ended on his nose. “You let me make love to you.”
He flicked his hand and the picture turned, he rewound the footage, followed the path of the pram until they got a glimpse in it and Steve had to close his eyes for a moment, while Tony pointed to the child, “no discernable breath pattern and I doubt a baby could sleep through the noise of a battle,” he moved the footage forward, “it doesn’t wake up when you hit the pram with the shield”, he moved it even further until the child was floating in the air and then maximized it and pointed to some dark spots on the baby’s body, “I’m not a medical man but I wonder of those dark spots came from the body lying somewhere for some time. Also look how there is no movement in the body itself. It’s almost like a doll. Rigor mortis.”
“And the newspapers said you were kinky,” Steve could almost hear Clint applauding him for this statement.
The front door of Marisa’s building was nothing more than better draft shield and Steve would have been really surprised if the lift had been working. The ‘out of order’ sign was so faded, he could barely make out the words. They made their way up the stairs and Steve could feel the curious looks of the neighbors even though he couldn’t see anyone. He knew from his childhood that the neighbors would notice almost anything, nothing would be missed by watchful eyes, but unless deemed necessary nothing would be revealed to any authorities. Maybe not even two men that looked clearly out of place in this part of town, even to people who didn’t recognize them.
“So, you are not allowed in the kitchen?” Steve laughed. Tony’s disasters in the kitchen had become legendary.
“Of course, my dear Captain, of course.” Tony flashed another grin at Steve before he became serious again.
“As I said not 100 percent. Unfortunately only one of the witnesses had a StarkPhone so the picture quality is not as good as I would wish for. But …”, and with a dramatic swirl he let the picture disappear and several new pictures of the child’s mother popped up, “… along with the facts that the mother was homeless, found dead a few days later and as confirmed by her autopsy had never been pregnant in her short life gives me enough material to believe that this was completely staged.”
This chapter describes the death of a child, not explicitly but probably enough for anybody who is triggered by this.
“What do you mean, he’s taken?” Zola hadn’t heard anything like that. Although admittedly she was usually pretty late on picking up gossip.
Zola was pretty sure it started the day Jamie came into her office to pick her up for lunch. There was nothing unusual about it, down to the part where Zola just had to finish this email until she was ready to leave. So when her office door opened she barely took the time to look up.
'How on earth did Natasha Romanov know her favorite flowers?', she wondered. Apparently too long, since Rogers offered an explanation.
“Yes, yes, I did. He promised me the best funeral money could buy, everything for Cullen I could wish for.”
And it was the ‘please’ that did it because Tony Stark didn’t beg like that, not in this serious tone. He took a deep breath, the air shakily leaving his lungs, and he did it again until he felt able to withdraw from the warmth of Tony’s hands, stable enough to take a step back. He could still feel Tony’s fingers on his face, wanted to take a step forward, but instead forced himself to stay still.
The first contact of Tony’s fingers around his cock let him shiver helplessly. He could sense the satisfied smirk on Tony’s lips but Tony’s thumb sliding over the tip and spreading the precum derailed the slight trace of irritation. Instead he tried clumsily to claim Tony’s lips again. Tony met his lips eagerly, but never letting go of his cock.
"I will tell them myself.” He decided and smiled at her. “If anybody gives you grief, just tell me. And believe me,” he added, blushing slightly, “we will lock the door next time."
“I do.” In an instant Steve was at her side and took her hand. “I do.” Gently he pulled her towards him, moving his hand soothingly over her back.
Steve risked stepping up close to Tony and kissing him between his shoulders. He was delighted when Tony awarded him with a pat on his head and kissed Tony’s hair before he leant against the desk Tony was working on, close but not touching him.
The line went dead and they both looked at each other. Under other circumstances this might have been comical, but at the moment they didn’t feel like laughter.
“I don’t think so. After Ultron there weren’t that many people out for your head, at least not considerably more than before,” and Tony winced slightly, but still acknowledging the point. “But now it should have been – well, not forgotten – but at least not be in everybody’s mind anymore, but it still is. You were forced to leave your company, you have to hide in Brooklyn.” And Steve smiled teasingly at him, before turning serious again. “Someone is influencing the public opinion against the Avengers. Maybe even the military to call back Col. Rhodes. And since when is an argument with a bystander a reason to suspend someone? We would have been all benched one time or the other, you even more so than anybody else. So there should be something to find. We just have to look into everybody, from the press to the guy arguing with Clint.”
“Yeah, I know some of your enemies, and they usually take the classical route. Fight you, try to kill you. But this guy must have studied you, he knew how you would react to something like that, that you would retreat. I mean I would probably have started drinking again …” – “Tony!” – “… It’s true, I would have, doing things carelessly,” he could hear Steve snorting, “okay, doing things even more carelessly, maybe killing myself by being Iron Man, but you, you would still try to protect your team.”
Tony settled back on the bench and stared pointedly on Steve’s hand that still rested on his shoulder.
The first connection of their lips was tentative as if they were both trying to decide whether or not this was the right angle, but Steve used the hand on Tony’s face to direct him in the right direction but maybe his hand just followed Tony’s movement anyway. Their next kiss was much more secure, just the right pressure, a not so careful nibbling until Tony involved a little tongue and Steve opened his mouth and the kiss turned heated.
“Hey yourself,” was all Steve managed as reply and he grinned in return when he saw Tony’s eyes laughing at him.
“Do you remember when I said that I couldn’t trace the source of the Facebook contact because of the encryption code the guy used?”
Tony hummed appreciatively and Steve felt Tony’s hand exploring his chest, sliding down to cup his cock through the trousers. The delicious pressure forced a moan out of Steve’s chest and he had to steady himself against Tony, suddenly weak in his knees and much too close to the edge. He managed to lift his head and found Tony’s eyes, almost black with arousal, burning into him. Steve rested his forehead against Tony’s and watched as the other man’s fingers slipped into his trousers and freeing his cock.
Steve turned around, away from the warmth. He was not sure how to explain the other aspect of his guilt, but sure that he had to do it.
When they turned to look at its owner, Zola could feel her jaw drop and out of the corner of her eye she saw Jamie and Ori doing the same. Next to them sat Black Widow, Clint Barton and Sam Wilson.
It took long to find something. Right now they had spent the last three days waiting. Or in Steve’s case exploring the whole Brownstone and its amenities including a ‘Captain America proved’ gym as Tony called it. He had tried working out his impatience with activity like exercising or cooking, but soon had figured out that the best way to endure it was staying close to Tony. They discussed things seriously and bickered as old friends and it was so easy, so natural that Steve wondered why they hadn’t done this before.
“Really, you are surprised?” Mr. Tacle feigned surprise. “If you are that slow maybe I’ve been invested in the wrong firm for the whole time, Mr. Krats.” He paused meaningfully. “Or should I better say, Mr. Stark.”
Steve put his shield back on his back and started climbing the ladders to get to the hostages. The large machines in the hall covered his progress, but also left him without a view on the battle. He didn’t like not knowing what happened on the battle field all the time, and what he gathered from Tony’s commentary of the battle didn’t reduce his worry. Apparently those tentacles proved to be very difficult to take care of, so Steve was relieved when he could catch a glimpse of Tony cutting one off with some kind of laser.
“Certainly, Sir,” the AI replied before one of the larger screens was filled with pictures and articles. They both stepped closer, looking through the material. Some of them were dismissed immediately; some of the articles received at least some screening. But it was Steve who found something. A picture of him and this guy with a woman on the other side. He enlarged it to show it to Tony. Tony moved the rest of the material to the side.
“Can’t be that renowned if they resort to telediagnosis,” Tony murmured as he swung his hammer enthusiastically on the piece of metal in front of him, drowning out the reporter with steady blows. For some reason watching the news lately made him aggressive and he wasn’t even watching FOX. His self-therapy was interrupted by Friday.
Steve immediately ducked behind his shield while Tony started his repulsors and tried to draw the fire on himself. It didn’t work quite as well as intended but at least Steve managed to reach cover behind one of the machines. Not that it helped very much, since the stream of bullets didn’t stop and they ricocheted through the hall.
When Steve woke up, he noticed three things. First, it was already morning, the early morning sun already lighting up the bedroom. Second, he felt slightly better, but this could also simply be caused by the third thing. He lay curled around Tony who was massaging his scalp carefully.
“Everybody who can modify my code to make it as you call it a ‘murder phone’ is also able to write the code to do so himself,” Tony snapped.
“Oh god, I wouldn’t want to work there,” Zola shuddered. “Anyway, as I was saying when I go in there they are always sitting on the sofa and simply eating and talking.”
“Well, as far as I know, Ultron developed his murderous tendencies quite soon after he was created. Since we are still alive, I’d say those phones are safe. And since the phones for the public will have a downgraded version of this technology I assume humanity must find other ways to kill itself.”
Steve let his head drop back on the bed for a moment, allowing himself a small happy smile, before he decided to follow Tony and get a more thorough explanation. On the relationship thing or on Tony’s apparent flash of inspiration. And maybe he could get a few kisses. He would like that. He made a stop in the bathroom and in his guestroom to get clean clothes before he went down to the workshop where Tony was already rapidly typing and muttering to Friday.
“That’s very generous of you,” Steve responded with mock seriousness. “Could you please provide me also with enough food to gain those 100 pounds you mentioned?”
His unease changed into anger and he had to grit his teeth to not say out loud the first things that came to his mind. He absolutely hated that every time one of his inventions was mentioned it always boiled down to Ultron regardless that none of Ultron’s actual code was anywhere in his other inventions and even more important none of them had become self-dependent killer robots.
After a short night Zola arrived at the office. On her desk lay the latest noise-cancelling headphones from the Stark line which would only be released at the beginning of the following year and a simple white card with the initials T.S.
It wasn't her first aftermath after the Avengers had to fight some weird-ass baddie in New York, but it was still strange to return to her office in Avengers Tower. The building obviously had taken some hits, but it still was structurally sound. And on her floor there were just little signs that something had happened - one shattered window, some paper lying around. Of course the view outside was another story. Zola could see destruction and burn marks, but since there had been no casualties she tended to consider them just cosmetic damage.
“Oh yes, I do!” Tony’s optimism was confirmed a moment later when Friday announced an address in an industrial sector just outside the city.
Tony smiled lazily at Steve, glad the other man was smiling back, glad the tension in his body had disappeared somewhat. Their smiles faded but their gazes lingered, and something almost forgotten came out from the hidden corner of his mind. A longing that he had never voiced, never acknowledged, but knew was there. Tony licked his lips and swallowed as he saw Steve breaking eye contact to watch the movement. Tension grew, tension that Tony was desperate to break. And he managed to swallow the sudden dryness in his throat.
For a moment he considered protesting, but then he curled around Tony’s pillow inhaling his scent and listened to his two favorite persons in the world.
It was ‘don’t doubt me’, ‘why are you so stubborn?’ and ‘I can understand you’ all in one word. For a moment Steve allowed the understanding to settle him, knowing from Natasha’s dossier and even more from seeing Tony after Ultron that he had enough demons of his own to see them in Steve. But still.
Although he knew why. Their bad start had lingered, and although they kind of agreed that things said on the helicarrier were not to be taken seriously, they also never apologized for each hurtful words. Plus, they had never been alone, just the two of them. And as Steve had learnt, there were too many layers to Tony that only were removed one by one when they ended up in one of those discussions that went so close to Steve’s heart. He would drown in the warmth of brown eyes, lulled in by a voice that promised everything he could wish for. If he were asked he would say it was his favorite time with Tony, but he had started appreciating all the time he could spend close to the man and even more that the feeling was apparently mutual.
“I’m not sure, apart from waiting there is not much we can do. Until Friday comes up with something relevant we have no lead.”
And it was. Marisa’s description hadn’t been that great, but in front of them was a photograph of the man he had drawn.
“You want me to hack into the personal data of the members of the press, the congress or the military. You wouldn’t believe how disappointed I’m right now,” Tony laughed.
Tony leant very close to Steve and whispered. “But I would have been tempted.” Steve’s slight exhale was something he saved to review later.
The swell of noise indicated that some of SI’s directors tried to contradict her, but Pepper pulled another ace out her sleeve.
“Oh, it’s you “, she just acknowledged her friend and looked back at the screen. “Sorry, I still need a moment, I got to finish this.”
The apartment wasn’t large, from the small hallway Steve could see one other door beside the one they were led through. The room they entered was clearly multifunctional. The sofa a convertible version, still unmade with crumpled sheets and pillows, a corner with a baby bed and baby clothes stacked on the sideboard next to it. Another corner was clearly set up as kitchen, the camping oven and a microwave the only tools for cooking meals. The old TV under the window was on, but muted.
“Do you want to wait?” He asked hoarsely and could feel the moment disappearing. Relief and disappointment battled for a moment, but in the end he managed to shove every idea about the man in front of him back where they belonged.
“Yes,” Peter exclaimed and started climbing on to Steve to take over his favorite position on Steve’s chest.
“So now Natasha, probably not a coincidence. Although I like the ‘pulled a Tony Stark’ expression. I hope it catches on.”
Steve was balancing on the edge of roof having grabbed the hook of one of the cranes. A shot to his feet stopped him and he turned. Tacle stood in front of him, heavily breathing but the weapon in his hand was pointed steadily at Steve.
“I’m just …“ She pointed to the door, but before she could make her escape, Mr. Stark hold her back.
“No, but I expected something with a little more finesse and secrecy. You are said to be tactical mastermind.”
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean ... I mean it's lovely … you and Mr. Stark and …,” Zola gesticulated wildly, “congratulations ... I just wasn't expecting it. I mean I probably should have … with how everybody is talking about you two, but I haven't and now it's awkward. And why couldn’t you just lock the door or go somewhere private. It’s not like the whole tower belongs to Mr. Stark. And I still have to tell my friends about it and I don’t want to. But Black Widow also expects me to say something. And they were betting on you. I mean I wasn’t betting, that seems strange but everybody else was better. And all the others never want to go to Mr. Stark’s office when you are there. Did I tell you that I have to tell Black Widow about you two? She will probably want to know why I didn’t tell her sooner. She is terrifying. Oh god, I'm babbling," she realized and closed her mouth.
“They have one year being an Avenger under their belt, and it’s not as if you left your shield at the cabin in the woods.”
“Two men on a bench staring at a grieving woman – not a good sign. A couple enjoying some time off in a park, way better.”
Steve was relieved that the little coffee shop he had found during one of his morning runs was still there and hadn’t changed at all. After coming back from 70 years of ice he preferred some things remaining the same even if this kind of wishful thinking would give some of his friends enough fodder for old-age-jokes. Not that any of those friends was around, he had left them behind when he had quit the Avengers after …
They approached the doors and although Tony’s hud didn’t show any sign of life or unusual devices he opened them carefully to risk a peak inside since his head was protected. But there was nothing on the other side of the door and they made their way slowly through the former reception area of the building. They repeated this process two times until they were in the main hall where they finally found signs of life.
They stayed in their respective spots for a long time, Steve in front of the grave and Tony on his bench. At some point he had taken his phone out, checking Friday’s progress on their investigations and seeing that there was no progress, working on some of his projects that had been neglected since his investigations. He was immersed in one of the technical specifications of a modified helicopter when Steve sat down next to him.
Marisa Rhys lived in a block that clearly had his best days behind it. Even Tony’s non-descript car looked out of place, much too shiny for this street that seemed grim and dark even in the middle of the day. They had waited until Marisa had left the graveyard before Tony collected his camera equipment and they returned to the car. At a nearby coffee shop Tony had filled his caffeine addiction while Steve took the chance to grab a bite until they got Friday’s message that Marisa Rhys had returned to her home.
“So, let’s see. Friday, can you pull up the material of the last Avengers fight, especially the scene when Barton is having the row with the civilian?”
“The usual: type of paper, printer, anything interesting in the word choice, spelling, other traces, you know the spiel.”
“Hello, my dear Captain. It’s so nice to hear from you. I thought you would stay in the woods, but I guess you heroes must always do some rescuing.” Tony had never before heard the Avengers’ work described so contemptuously and that did include anything Fox News said about them.
“Because you called us. Because you tried to blackmail me. You tried to get my attention and now you have it and I want to know why?”
Steve risked a glance and saw the armor in the middle of the hall, dodging several tentacles and trying to fight back with his repulsor blasts. They didn’t seem to have much of an effect, but luckily the same could be said about the bullets.
Tacle pressed some kind of panel on his arm and the three tentacles holding Tony were released and falling down on the ground with a shattering noise, taking the lifeless armor with them. It was horrible, so, so horrible and for a moment Steve wanted to go down, wanted to check on Tony and it was Tacle starting to climb on the machines to get up to him, that spurred him into motion.
He shied back from following this thought to its end, knowing too well that he would probably return immediately into hiding if he thought too much about it. Instead he concentrated on the board with their selection of coffees although as always he ordered a simple black coffee. It was still early, but the morning crowd was already on its caffeine hunt. Luckily for him most of them ordered their coffee to go so he easily found a free table.
Steve hadn’t finished his coffee, but he was pretty sure that wherever Tony would lead him, coffee wouldn’t be far away. He just nodded and picked up his bag and jacket while following Tony out of the shop to his car. It was one of the non-descript cars nobody knew Tony owned, looking like a family van on the outside but having every gadget Tony could imagine on the inside.
When Tony started trailing kisses and bites down his jaw and his throat, Steve remembered how he admired the other man’s throat from afar and he used his supersoldier strength to carefully manhandle Tony in the right position. Judging from his moans and the way Tony moved his head to give him better access; Tony didn’t mind him taking control. But of course the other man didn’t stay passive. Instead he pulled up Steve’s shirt and Steve’s lips left Tony’s skin for a moment so that Tony could pull the shirt over his head.
Steve was quiet on their ride back to Tony’s house. Tony looked at him from time to time, but he couldn’t sense any tension on him, he even seemed a bit lighter as if a weight or a dark cloud had been lifted. When he caught Tony looking he smiled slightly.
He settled on a nearby bench, keeping his gaze on Steve and their surroundings, but it was still early and not many people were at the graveyard. Also their corner was pretty secluded. It left him with more time to watch and worry about Steve. Tony knew guilt intimately, knew that Pepper and Rhodey tried to talk him out of it, argued with him until they all were hoarse from the screaming match those discussions usually evolved into. But they couldn’t really understand that guilt didn’t work that way. Guilt walked straight through all the arguments and settled into the lower pit of his stomach. He would always feel responsible for the deaths that had been caused by his weapons, his inventions, regardless how justified his actions had been, regardless how much Obie had orchestrated behind his back. There was always this burden on his shoulders and he had stopped a long time ago trying to explain this feeling to somebody else.
“Yes, you are.” And with this Tony pulled Steve closer to him, encircling his hips with his legs and threw both arms around Steve’s neck. Tony kissed him, deep and full of feelings and only the slight touch of heat. Steve wanted nothing more than to stay here forever and kiss a naked Tony in his arms, but then Tony whispered ‘take me to bed, soldier’ he was really happy to follow an order.
“Marisa Rhys, 23, worked at a diner until some months ago, currently unemployed, member of several Facebook support groups for families losing their children to cancer,” Tony rattled through the information. “And I have an address.”
“Okay,” Zola agreed, but still hesitated a moment. Jamie was glaring at her. “I walked in on him and Mr. Stark kissing.”
“Only when Mr. Stark was there. And usually after hours. And here …” she gesticulated in the direction of the door “… here you can see him every day.” She sighed again. “Too bad he’s taken.”
“Interestingly enough there are no records for an autopsy of the baby, but a GoFundme-site collected money for its funeral. The funeral drew quite a large public attendance.” Tony pulled up several other pictures of a large black dressed crowd on a cemetery. Steve stared at the crowd, felt the wave of grief for a life lost at this young age, but the voice in his head that drowned ‘it’s your fault’ was not complete gone, but at least not as loud and insistent as it used to be.
“It’s just … it’s you following the trail and I’m … I’m useless. I’d prefer to do something. Not just sit and wait.”
Yes, everything was packed, besides one thing. She grabbed one of her shirts out of the bag to wrap the picture frame from the side board. It had been taken at the beginning of their relationship and she was always reminded of the butterflies in her tummy and sunshine kisses. He had never understood why she liked this picture so much, claimed that he was barely in it. And in a way he was right. They were both framing Captain America, his arms resting on both of their shoulders. And although the Captain did nothing extraordinary, his smile almost shy, he captured the attention of the viewer. Despite the end of her relationship she wouldn’t leave this behind. A picture of Captain America was still worth something and the third person in the picture could easily be folded away.
“Yes, and as I said, former Pentagon paper pusher. Has a hell of a lot connections. I guess that’s why my father went with the exchange. Tacle was one of those who protested the most when I closed down the weapon’s manufacture.”
“Probably yes, now that I know what I’m looking at. But this is a very limited edition of the StarkPhone and only a few selected people received this advanced version of it – you know like the president or my board of directors for example. And each phone had a slight variation, like a serial number in his code, so I can trace every phone back to its owner.”
Steve didn’t wait until Tacle regained secure footing with his remaining three tentacles, just threw one of the concrete blocks on another one of the tentacles. Judging from the sparks that errupted, it was also out of commission. This was confirmed by Tacle’s angry scream as he followed Steve furiously on two tentacles.
“The money, early access to groundbreaking tech,” Tony shrugged. “He is not the only one of the old directors that doesn’t like the direction SI is taking now but as long as it’s making profit they mostly keep their opinions to themselves. Also it’s not so easy to get rid of directors and besides, as I said, he’s got good contacts to the Senate and the military. I may be not in the weapon’s business anymore but I still like to sell some of the stuff I invented to the military. And Pepper claims he is sensible guy. But apparently even Pepper can be wrong.”
Drifting off, he could hear Jarvis announcing Bruce’s arrival and felt soft hands carefully prodding him. The sound of soft voices washed over him, when he fell asleep again.
And so Steve stood up and took the two and a half steps until he was right into Tony’s space. He put one hand on Tony’s hip, the other hand caressing Tony’s jaw, tracing the lines of Tony’s beard. Tony’s reaction consisted of putting his arm on Steve’s chest and raising an eyebrow as if asking ‘really?’. But he only stopped talking when their mouths were just inches apart.
“No cure for cold,” Steve pointed out. “Maybe serum not better than science.” He didn’t even try to formulate complete sentences.
“If two medical authorities recommend snuggles …” Steve got himself upright and let Tony slip behind him so that he could lean on him. It was their standard sitting arrangement when they took one lazy afternoon.
Tony had been right, it only took a few strokes for him to spill but Steve continued until Tony stopped him. Wondering what to do with his hand and the remains of Tony’s orgasm he lifted it looking for some piece of cloth or even his shirt to wipe his hand clean, but then he remembered the taste of Tony’s skin and some part of him needed to know if every part of Tony tasted this good.
“Let’s see. Friday can you find me anything about my friend Mr. Tacle here. Social media, public appearances, especially anything to do with the Avengers.”
They arrived at a Brownstone in Brooklyn of all places, no trace of the glass and steel that made Stark Tower so distinctively modern. Instead this house looked like the homes of Steve’s childhood and his artistic eye collected the wrought-iron window boxes, the carefully crafted decorations on the plaster while they waited for the garage door to open. Just as he was about to comment on the lack of high tech so far, the seemingly ordinary wall in front of them turned into a window wall to Tony’s workshop. It was not as spacious as the tower’s or what he imagined the Malibu house’s workshop must have been, but the tech he saw right in front of him looked still right out of one of those science fiction movies he had watched in the last few months.
“So that’s how it is, Captain America watches television instead of taking care of the Avengers,” Tony teased. “Next thing you hear he has turned in real couch potato gaining 100 pounds and scaring kittens in trees instead of rescuing them.
"Who is in it?" He still sounded amused, but there was a hint of steel in his voice that made it clear why he was leader of the Avengers.
“What about you?” Steve looked at Tony. “Dr. Banner said lots of snuggles and Dr. Parker agrees. Do you want to act against medical advice?”
He looked at Tony for a moment longer, until he turned and settled against the bench. Carefully Tony released his breath, imitating Steve’s position and trying to get back to his helicopter schematics. It took him more time than he liked to admit and even then he was the whole time much too aware of the body right next to him.
Finally the lift was up. She opened the door and for a moment it felt like a déjà vu. In front of her, Tony Stark and Captain Rogers apparently very enthusiastically confirmed that they were still alive. And they hadn’t noticed her yet. A passionate sound threw her out of her reverie and she hastily took the blocks away that held the door open, watching them closing. Zola leant on the panel next to them and began sliding down the wall until she sat on the floor.
He watched her silently as she collected the last of her possessions. To an outsider it probably would have been an obvious sign of the state of their relationship that she only had a few things in the apartment despite several months of practically living together. Hell, she usually managed to distribute her belongings more effectively in any hotel room she stayed. But right now, she was just glad that she didn’t need much time to gather everything. A last look around, a last walk through his apartment but there was nothing. He followed her silently, glaring daggers at her.
For a long time they looked at each other. Tony felt suddenly too exposed under the scrutiny of those blue eyes and almost slumped with relief when Steve changed the topic.
Steve looked at the screens in this workshop, looked at the projects on the desks, he could even identify some of those things, looked back to Tony.
Zola laughed at Jamie’s expression, apparently ready to get back at Captain America for doing something to her friend. It made her feel lighter.
“Yes, sometimes I have to bring him plans, especially since Morgan and he don’t seem too compatible. You’ve heard what happened in the meeting with Johnson.”
“I’m good,” was Tony’s answer and then he pulled him flush against the armor until there was no more space between them. The smooth surface felt strange against his body, but the feeling of the kiss he remembered.
“We probably should take this as a working theory. Okay, let’s head back to workshop. Until we come up with something, we won’t know for sure. Hopefully it won’t take long until we find something.”
Steve was already in their bed – and he liked the feeling of warmth every time he thought of a bed as their bed – and enjoyed the view. He had enjoyed it almost daily in the last three months since Tony and he usually spent their nights together – either at the Avenger’s facility, at the tower or most of the time at the Brownstone.
A strange sound came through the speakers and in took Tony a moment to realize that it was a giggle. He wondered if the bad guys at some point in their careers had to start laugh strangely. If so supervillainy was even more unappealing.
“Oh, yes, fast, please,” Tony’s answer was barely more than a moan and Steve set up a punishing pace, studying Tony’s expression for guidance. It was now Tony’s turn to pant against his skin and Steve loved this, loved the idea that he could render Tony as helpless as he had made him, loved the knowledge that they both enjoyed what they could do to each other.
“He is just human,” she tried to explain, but from the look on his face it didn’t work. He still had the star struck look on him that all new engineers had until they had to work close to Mr. Stark. Then they were still in awe of his genius, but much braver in their personal contact. She had seen it enough times not to recognize the pattern. But right now, she didn’t have the time to work through this pattern.
“As you can see Clint is not for subtlety,” Romanov stated. “But more important, there is a betting pool. If you want to join?”
Tony walked seemingly aimlessly through the rows of tombstones and trees of the graveyard. It was a pretty nice graveyard, he supposed, more like a park. It also made it easier to hide the cameras he had brought with them. Mostly they were directed to the baby’s, no Cullen’s grave as the tombstone said, but some also covered a larger area if anybody interested in the grave wouldn’t go as near as Steve was right now.
Tony nodded slightly and settled back against Steve, even leaning his head slightly against Steve’s shoulder and Steve was still amazed how natural that felt, as if they should be always sitting that way.
“Cap DB?” Steve asked but before Tony could answer the screen was filled with images from his worst nightmare, the reason why he left the Avengers in the first place.
"Just a moment," she shouted down before she started working on the panel to override the electronic control system. It didn't take her very long - Stark loved clean codes and panels - to get the lift working again. Since she couldn't see what was wrong with it, she opted to get it up in slow motion, making sure that none of the sensors showed any indication of trouble.
“So, we can guess why you are working against Tony. But why are you fighting the Avengers, Mr. Tacle?,” Steve asked and Tony raised his eyebrows at him questioningly. He interpreted Steve’s answering shrug and tilt of his head as ‘why not’. With the universal sign ‘your turn’ he left the conversation to Steve who thanked him with another small smile and squeeze of his shoulder.
Bruce sighed: “I know he is worried. But I’m really happy that the serum makes this flu a 24-hour thing. I think Clint is already hiding.”
“We are not.” Ori said.  “Just watch one interview with them. My grand-parents also have those stupid smiles when they talk about each other but they have been married for 50 years. Steve Rogers and Tony Stark are totally gone for each other. I bet you.”
“Unless you want Mr. Stark to look over these codes, I would suggest you accept Mr. Krats explanation.”
“Well, my dear Mr. Stark, that depends on if you found out my secret. Or were you too busy staring adoringly in the dear Captain’s eyes. Oh yes, I know all about you. Obie was one of my best friends and even best man at my wedding. He told me all about you. You think you can hide, but not from me.”
“We can go something fancy the next round,” Tony growled and Steve liked the sound of it, the promise that this was something more than a fling in the workshop. He slid his fingers in Tony’s pants and pushed them down. For a moment he let his fingertips run along the veins, before he curled his hand around Tony’s cock.
Tony watched Steve standing in front of the tombstone decorated with a small angel. His head hang low and his shoulders were hunched and Tony knew that despite all of Tony’s evidence Steve still felt responsible for the death of this child. He hoped they would find the mother and learn something more about Cullen and the circumstances of his death, but above all he hoped that they’d find that he was right, that the kid had been already dead and hopefully hadn’t been murdered by Steve's mysterious blackmailer.
“We know. We are already trying to come up with plausible scenarios to lock them in a cupboard,” Wilson laughed.
“Because in my experience those who scream the loudest about something usually have something to hide. Until now I’m not exactly wrong,” he smiled wryly, “but unfortunately nothing what helps us.”
Steve smiled as his son started his careful examination. Dutifully he opened his mouth and took deep breaths when told so. His heart swelled when he watched Peter scrunching his nose in concentration while he listened to Steve’s heartbeat with his tiny stethoscope.
In the early stages of their relationship Tony might have deflected, but now Steve could feel his shrug.
“Ms. Robinson?” He addressed her. She probably shouldn’t be surprised that they knew her name. It was still unsettling.
What he saw made his heart stop. Three tentacles had winded themselves around Tony and he could see Tony struggling in the armor, but he couldn’t move. Steve still heard him through the com, but that was just more or less heavy breathing with heavy cursing. With horror he watched another tentacle approaching the armor holding again a gun. It looked different than the guns they had been greeted with and a moment later he knew why it was different. It was an EMP gun and Steve saw the arc reactor flickering out and the sudden lack of noise in his ear was terrifying.
Steve snorted. “There will be other afternoons. And As if you would have stopped after what we’ve just heard.”
He took one of the free newspapers intending to use it as a polite signal to be left alone so that he could plan his next steps, but an article about the Avengers caught his eye. He started reading it only to stop disgusted a few lines in when he learnt that Hawkeye had been suspended for his argument with the civilian. So now the Avengers were down to three with Natasha as the only founding member still active. And unfortunately Natasha was still no media darling, refused to play their games.
“She left,” now Tacle sounded vicious. “She left and it’s your fault. If you haven’t met her … You are going to pay for it. You’ll see. You both will pay for it.”
“It’s worth a shot,” Tony tried to convince her. “He was an artist before the whole fighting Hitler stunt.”
The roof was a clustered mess of chains and concrete blocks, three cranes and a cable winch as remains from when the hall still had been in function. There was not much cover so when the first tentacle came after him he took the hook from the cable winch and pierced it through the tentacle before releasing it. Tacle was dragged to the side of the building before he released the tentacle.
“So what took you so long?“ Ori asked. They were sitting in their favorite deli, just around the corner from SI and were enjoying their meal.
“Getting a second opinion?” Steve lifted his gaze to Tony who stood behind Peter, basically hovering.
He had very fond memories of this bedroom, and it had the added bonus that Pepper wouldn’t come by unannounced to force Tony to do something for Stark Industries since the newest Board member Tammy Lynn Richardson was an enthusiastic supporter of Tony Stark. And she had enough connections of her own, including some members of a committee looking into the allegations against another member of the Avengers.
“Well, you can keep me company while I wait. Friday does most of the digital footwork; the only thing for me to do is checking the sub-routines and giving her new search ideas. And I’d say you can certainly help with the latter.”
“You are impossible. You are an impossible standard for us to reach. No man can compare to you and no man should. They should see you as you really are. How could you do this to us?”
“You were a pain in the ass.” Bruce said down on the bed. “Why don’t you make yourself useful? I bet Steve would love to have fresh bed linens. And maybe also prepare the sofa, I think a change of scenery might do him good.”
There was just one major thing wrong with the tower - Jarvis was still offline. Apparently yesterday's bad guys had gotten one lucky hit on a critical spot in the tower and now the whole building struggled with electronics. Like the lifts that got stuck all day.
The phone call ended soon after that and left Tony with the helpless anger of someone who is a persona non grata in a company that bore his name.
“As I understand it, the new StarkPad is based on the special edition of the StarkPhone we received for testing purposes last year?”
The last kiss ended on his mouth and Steve’s heart sang. They hadn’t said ‘I loves you’ in the three months of their relationship but sometimes Tony would say things like this and kiss him so earnestly that made him sure those words weren’t that far away.
“I’m good. I’m almost ready with the new StarkPad you requested and I had some other ideas for marketable electronics. I’ll send you a proposal within the afternoon.”
It took him two steps to stand before her desk. It felt weird remaining seated, so she stood up, feeling completely awkward.
“I know, it’s just … from a tactical point of view … it makes sense to remove one after the other. I just know that someone is messing with the team.”
“Do you mind helping me out, soldier?” With this Tony directed one of Steve’s hands to his own crotch. Steve felt the hardness and eagerly traced its outline.
Steve just raised an eyebrow, so Tony squared his shoulders and gave Friday the signal to accept the call.
“Well, I’m not sure we should sell this. It’s based on the Ultron routines and killing StarkPhones and StarkPads is the last what the world needs.”
As if to prove his father right, Steve could hear the telltale sound of footsteps approaching the bedroom. Tony started to disentangle himself from the embrace and got up, leaving a kiss on Steve’s temple.
“How could I not recognize my own code?” That was not what Steve had meant, he had felt more betrayed on Tony’s behalf that someone would do this to him, but before he could find the words to explain it to him, Tony already continued his explanation.
So he understood what Steve was feeling. He also knew that Cap didn’t deal particularly well with guilt. He could hide it, but from the few things he gathered regarding the Bucky/Winter-Soldier debacle Steve still felt responsible what had been done to the other man. Otherwise Sam wouldn’t be on a manhunt for months. Or this baby – Steve had dropped his shield, almost literally, and went into hiding.
Tony gave the keyboard a final tap and the long lines of code disappeared from the screen and instead a picture appeared.
“No, it appears, he caught Mr. Thor’s Asgardian flu. His symptoms are similar to the early stages of Mr. Thor’s sickness,” Jarvis explained.
“I don’t understand why you are so surprised. You are the one that insisted that they were in love with each other.”
She was pretty sure that the three of them were equally panicking right now. The Avengers had just caught them gossiping about Captain America and Iron Man. Who was their boss. She was sure that this was the definition of not good.
Shaking her head she looked after him, before she decided that she had already lost her flow and needed a short break anyway. She stood up, smoothed down her dress, before she headed out of her office. Morgan’s desk stood strangely empty in front of Mr. Stark’s office, only the telephone left on it. Zola could see the lights of different extensions blinking. Taking a deep breath, she hesitated a second before she knocked on the door, shaking the head over herself. Just because Ori and Jamie – and the Avengers apparently her mind unnecessarily added – thought that Mr. Stark and Captain Rogers were an item, didn’t mean that it was true. She waited until she heard an affirmative noise and then opened the door.
She put the picture in the bag, mentally running once again through the place and trying to remember if there was anything else and ignoring the angry glares he sent at her.
Steve ignored him. “Several entrances, three levels including a basement, one large hall for machinery as I see it. Not the best place for an attack if we are only two.”
“Yeah, that’s why I came back to New York. I was running out of material to watch to finish my metamorphosis, but you had to drag me back into the Avengers business,” Steve deadpanned.
"Those are for you," Rogers said, almost shoving the flowers to her. She could see him blush and thought about the curse of a fair skin before she remembered her manners.
Zola frowned slightly while typing furiously. Admittedly the view from her office was better than the one from the R&D floor, mainly because her office now was higher and so she could actually view over parts of Manhattan, but basically all there was to see were other buildings. Not that she could actually afford to watch out of her windows, since she was busy finishing her old projects from R&D next to her new ones on the executive floor. With a final click she finished her email and sent it to one of the engineers, before she looked up.
