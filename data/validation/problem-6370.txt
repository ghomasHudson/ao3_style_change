Tony feels Steve’s shoulders shake as he silently laughs, and the engineer stretches his lips into a lazy smile.
“You are worthy, my friend,” he states in a matter-of-fact tone. He lets those words sink in first before he continues. “After all, it is only prudent that you also learn how to handle Mjölnir in a fight.”
“You okay, Bruce?” Steve asks politely. He remembers the drink in his hand, some weird concoction that Tony carelessly thrust towards him, and takes a sip of the cool drink, careful to hide the wince at the fruity taste combined with the alcohol.
, focus, Steve. “I know you guys are mad, but, um. I didn’t mean to freak you out, but I don’t regret doing what I did. But still, I— I’m sorry.”
“Nothing is wrong with you, Tony,” Jarvis states firmly, and for a moment Tony almost believes him. “Now come along. The earlier we arrive at our destination, the sooner your questions will be answered.”
“Well?” Natasha asks with a raised eyebrow. She can feel sweat dripping down her forehead, and her face must be a lovely canvas of dirt, soot, and blood. Just another day at the playground.
Now, Tony is perfectly aware of his flaws; he’s loud and larger than life, arrogant, doesn’t know how to be part of a team (that’s still a work-in-progress, and even he knows he’s marginally improved in that department), presumptuous, self-absorbed, and a laundry list of issues that could go on and on. Despite that, what
If anything, the super soldier’s frown deepens at Tony’s incoherent response. Steve closes the small gap between them until they’re only a foot from each other. Tony finds himself swallowing inaudibly at the close proximity, his heart starting to beat a staccato rhythm against his ribcage. Next, he feels Steve rest one large, warm hand on his elbow, and Tony blinks again before looking up to meet Steve’s baby blues.
“The song, it’s perfect,” Tony answers. He casts a glance a Steve, but Steve’s already looking at him so he doesn’t miss the bashful expression on the engineer’s face when he says, “For this kind of night. So fucking cliché, too. Middle of the night, walking along the filthy but quiet streets of the city that never sleeps after consuming an unhealthy amount of sugar at the local diner.”
His teammates, especially Steve who hasn’t left his bedside in the Tower’s med-bay following the intense battle, had excitedly showed him video reactions and tweets of Tony wielding Mjölnir. Apparently expending that much effort and energy using Mjölnir had completely drained the genius, who only woke up after losing consciousness for almost fourteen hours.
When Natasha walks past Tony, she lightly brushes her fingers on Tony’s clean-shaven cheek and kisses it. Before she pulls away, Steve hears her whisper, “I’m glad you got home safe and sound, Antoshka.”
Steve smiles at him and nods, and he can’t help but think that Tony’s reply sounded more like ‘thank you’.
“Mr. Odinson left it there by accident after I alerted him of Mr. Barton attempting to break into the safe that contains his pop tarts,” JARVIS replies after a short pause.
“No, no, I’m fine,” Tony quickly declares, but the way he gravitates closer to Steve says otherwise. “Just… just feeling cold. Nothing to worry about, Steve.”
“Yes. That. Adding in that observation Steve shared before about the mysterious chills Tony gets now and then, I think it also ties in to what’s happening with his brain. Because if you look at the dates here, say about three days ago — I recall Tony wearing a sweater to dinner.”
Steve blinks rapidly. He clears his throat and wets his lips because there’s a reason why he’s here in the first place.
It’s one thing to have your family and friends constantly remind you of your worth, and it’s another to have the whole world bear witness to him wielding Mjölnir, a feat only achieved by an alien god, and have them sing
“Do you think SHIELD will be able to find something?” Steve had asked the physicist after Agent Hill and two SHIELD agents left the Tower with the device.
make up for the prolonged absence. I'm really sorry, and at the same time I don't even have an excuse like ¯\_(シ)_/¯
Tony cackles as he gets up from his position on the carpeted floor, draining his fourth glass of scotch before he walks over to Bruce and starts to tug the other man to his feet.
“No, she wants to talk,” he hears Thor say reassuringly. “I believe she’s concerned for your welfare and only wants to be assured that you’re fine herself.”
Tony dealing with the press, let alone the paparazzi, in his current condition. It’s for the best that he remains here in the Tower until we get more answers
And just like that, they all disperse to the kitchen. Pepper says goodbye to them, claiming that she has paperwork to do, and kisses and hugs Tony before she walks to the elevator.
It’s late in the night and Steve’s still wide awake. Fortunately, it’s not because of a nightmare that kept him up, but rather he was struck by inspiration to draw.
To say that Tony was shocked at the public’s reaction is a huge understatement. CNN, BBC, Fox News, and several other broadcasting channels
Tony swallows inaudibly as his late butler’s soothing English accent fills the dark void surrounding them.
Tony blushes, thankful that it’s just the two of them. He caresses the hammer’s face with a fondly exasperated look.
It’s apparent that the two are absolutely unaware of Steve’s presence because Peter’s singing along to the song, and Tony?
Thor’s expression clears. “Ah. But you mentioned earlier that the increase of his brain activity at night is similar to when a person is awake.”
Tony pats his back before they both pull away after a few moments. “It’s nothing, Steve. Besides, it wasn’t just me! The rest of the team pitched in, too.”
The super soldier physically fights off a shudder when he feels Tony’s warm breath on his bare skin.
(Tony wins, but only because Steve’s throat is tight with emotion seeing as he was too busy imprinting this very moment to memory.)
“Sorry, sorry,” Bruce says hastily, and Steve finds himself barely keeping up with the scientist’s rambling. “I think we just made a breakthrough, Steve. Well, not yet, but soon we will. The answer’s
He hears voices over the comms but Tony can’t discern what his teammates are saying. Between one breath and the next, he allows a predatory grin to grace his face before he lets pure instinct take over.
Oh, and for that year, Tony built Steve his own art studio on the 88th floor, a level above the super soldier’s apartment. Not only that, but he also got him a complete set of the best art supplies money can buy. To say that Steve was happy with his gifts (because Tony doesn’t spare
Overall, Tony’s satisfied with how everything turned out. If only the butterflies in his stomach would settle so he could focus on more important things, like try to enjoy this goddamn party.
“Collate all the data you have on Tony’s brain and send it to me,” Bruce pronounces, his movements a little jerky as he quickly puts all the medical supplies back in his bag. He shoves his glasses up his nose as he continues, “Oh, and can you create a graph or chart listing the important points of his brain’s activity? It’s possible that there’s a correlation to these shivering episodes Tony’s experiencing versus the normal ones. I just, the whole picture’s not there yet but oh man, JARVIS, if we can map it out from the beginning and work our way backwards then we’ll finally be able to have the answers we’re —”
“Steve,” Tony utters in a gravelly voice, hope and fear and longing evident in his whiskey-colored eyes, and all Steve wants to do is take this stubborn genius in his arms and never let him go.
After placing a second batch of grilled cheese sandwich on the pan, Steve feels Tony approach as the latter opens the fridge to take out a jug of milk. At Steve’s raised eyebrow, Tony grins boyishly at him.
He’s known Tony for nearly two years, been living with him for almost that long, and not once did he hear the man speak without swearing every other sentence. Feeling ashamed of himself for not noticing the obvious, Steve discreetly glances at Bruce and is filled with relief when he catches sight of the embarrassed look that passes over the physicist’s face.
Tony admits (if only to himself) that he is a lot less emotionally intelligent than he wants to be, but he’s
One glance at the clock shows Steve that Tony’s right. He’ll wrap up his conversation with Tony, finish his lukewarm tea, and then go to sleep.
“I have already alerted SHIELD of the situation and have sounded the alarm at Avengers Tower,” JARVIS replies. “Captain Rogers has informed me they are en route to the location and will arrive in five minutes. Mr. Odinson has also been notified and will arrive via the Bifrost. The suit has also been deployed and will reach you in two minutes.”
me as I am, and deemed me worthy. Not just the ability to lift her, but —” Tony falters for a second, and Bruce sees him swallow inaudibly before he forces the rest of the words out, “— but in general. She
Unfortunately, neither Tony nor Thor arrive on time because not barely five seconds pass when she hears the telltale sounds of the cluster of spider bots approaching around the corner.
Steve grabs his beverage from the counter and walks to the couch, where he deposits the mug on a Captain America coaster (gag gift from Sam). He’s just taken a sip of his drink when his phone buzzes repeatedly in his hand.
For the next several minutes, Steve remains quiet but vigilant as Bruce carries on with checking over Tony. He scrutinizes the arc reactor while asking JARVIS questions that Steve knows is full of science jargon. Bruce also uses a pen light to examine Tony’s eyes and the insides of his mouth, much to Steve’s bafflement.
Clint stares at him with a raised eyebrow. “Y’know, that day we were both in the kitchen and I asked you to put the milk back in the fridge. Then you thrust your hand out and then Mjölnir, well,
Again, Steve shakes his head and smiles lopsidedly at his friend. “Doubt it.” He gets up from his seat, taking the empty mugs with him to dump it in the sink before he opens the fridge to rummage through the contents to prepare a late lunch. “Anyway, what do you feel like having for lunch?”
Steve’s bringing up the rear, so he witnesses Natasha place a comforting hand on the middle of Tony’s back as she walks past him. He sees Tony turn his head to smile at the redhead, who smiles back at him with a warm look. Next, he sees Clint set down a bottle of cold water by Tony’s plate, the archer clapping a hand on Tony’s shoulder when the engineer thanks him with a small grin. Warmth blooms in Steve’s chest as he observes the small details of his teammates going out of their way to be considerate towards Tony. As he settles himself in his usual seat, which is in front of Tony and on Bruce’s left, Steve shoots the engineer a lopsided smile as he pushes the bowl of fresh fruits closer to him, a clear gesture that Tony should eat a piece of kiwi first.
“Is it morning already? What time’s it?” He asks, and Clint takes in the exhausted lines across Tony’s sleep-deprived face.
is so damn domestic. Sure, he’s been living Tony and the rest of the team for a long time now. They’ve already established a routine at this point, no matter how sporadic that is. But it’s times like today that Steve is reminded on how absolutely fortunate he is to have this life. This team.
to them afterwards for his outburst earlier that day, and if it were under different circumstances, Steve would’ve laughed at the others’ gobsmacked expressions — even Natasha’s face slackened in shock upon hearing Tony’s genuine apology. But what surprised Steve more was when Clint regained his composure and

He has been informed constantly these past several months — fuck, make it years, considering Pepper, Rhodey, and Happy have been in his life the longest — that he isn’t alone. That he’s a good man — though that thought’s still a harder pill to swallow — and worthy of having good things. He no longer has to shoulder the weight of the world’s problems on his own should he choose to because he has his team, his

He sees his own hand clutching the milk jug for Tony to take. Next, he catches sight of Tony’s expression go from disinterested to alarmed, brown eyes blown wide in — panic? Shock? Fear? — before that
is Steve’s whole world, and the blond man is just now realizing that everything he’s ever wanted and needed has been in front of him all along.
Tony, in his esper form, fighting not only the shadows that danced forward and back, slipped around, attacked civilians, like silent assassins, but fighting the image of his father.
“Maybe I want to be caught?” Tony heard a few groans around the table, but to be fair, this conversation threw him off.
The woman's laughter stopped only when the giant white dragon appeared. Steve didn't pay attention as the creature attacked her, his eyes focused on Tony.
“Can I have a donut?” whispered Xion, climbing onto Tony's lap, and reaching for the pastry. The other two sat near Steve and Natasha.
With a sigh, Steve said, “Maybe not entirely, but certainly parts of it. We have no right to judge what anyone else went through, and in this place where everyone's trying so hard to get along, Templars and Mages, humans, elves, Qunari, dwarf....to push each other away would just take us one step closer to more fighting we don't need.”
Yeah, I'm going to make this into a series. But I think I'll work a bit on the Avengers/Inquisition fic, too. =3
“Forgive me for interrupting your rest,” said Thor, when they entered. The rest of the team sat in various states of wakefulness. “I told Lady FRIDAY it was not urgent.”
And he vaguely wondered if this was a sentient computer. It wouldn't surprise him one bit, given everything they experienced recently. He was absolutely fascinated, but largely pissed off. Natasha and Axel were distracting Nobodies, putting their lives in danger, and he and Steve...
He closed his eyes, even as Natasha put a hand on his arm and squeezed it. 'Well, might as well go down in a blaze of glory,' he thought, as he unlaced his shirt.
“Word of your runes has spread,” Natasha said. She watched carefully as Tony forced his body to relax.  “Someone came by earlier, wanting to talk to you. Her name's Dagna. I think she's like you.”
“Of course, darling,” she replied, but not unkindly. “Ideas need to start in such small ways before they are ironed out, and even then problems arise. However, I agree with your idea. Mages need a school, not a prison.”
“I thought I'd find you here,” said Natasha, sitting beside him, as they watched the stream idly meander.
And then, almost like someone turning on the lights, Steve found himself in a vast field. No sun, no clouds, but a blue sky, no wind, or animals, but endless fields of grass.
“Xigbar, and you're extremely funny, Mr. Stark. Shame that I do have the upper hand...get it? Upper?”
“It is an honor to meet you, Tony Stark,” said the stranger, and in the blink of an eye, the image changed. Suddenly, his beard, hair, and mustache were long, white, and sleek. He wore blue robes, runes on his long sleeves. “My name is Ramuh.”
“Masked,” said Vision. “The woman said softly, 'Oh, Tony,' touched the arc reactor, and it lit once more.”
But he would worry about that later. Right now he focused on Tony, on his gently trembling form, on his lips as he pressed a gentle kiss, then a deeper one, ignoring his teammates playful banter...
“Through sickness and health,” mumbled Bruce, earning a few snickers from around the table. Tony glared at him.
The woman, apparently a warrior as well, crossed her arms. Natasha kept an eye on her as well, but still focused mostly on Cullen. “Fix it, Cullen. Isn't this what you do?”
Tony touched it, feeling a familiar warmth spread through him, calling to a part of him. It was part of the mixture of blood given in his infusion, the fire that seeped in his veins.
So when a messenger came, one of Leliana's spies, to inform her she was needed in the War Room, she took a deep breath, and went to join her teammates.
“Mo...mom?” he rasped. It couldn't be her. She died at the hands of the Winter Soldier, a secret that Steve had kept from him, and led to one of their worst fights. The two avoided each other for weeks after that revelation.
More creatures ran towards them, some now bigger than others, some wielding what Strange and Wanda said was magic.
“I didn't. I carved a rune into me, to save myself, because I didn't want to die.” He shrugged, as if what had happened was completely normal. “I had some help, really. Another mage helped me with the idea, before those sadists killed him. I just added some stuff to make it work better...the runes around the main one...using metal and inks for the main rune...”
And then he moved his hands. One hand glowed.  They were both staring at it, before they both noticed him smiling.
“I'm not sure how good this thing is,” whispered Tony, frowning, when he felt Steve's warmth fill him.
“Kingdom Hearts...it can't be all dark or all light, if its made of the Hearts of worlds and people.”
For now, he would leave the practice for later. He could still use magic, could even focus the energy in his gauntlets, so that would suffice for now.
“The....you know, just once, I'd really just like to understand one conversation fully,” moaned Tony.
Axel winced, his easy smile slipping away. Tony saw how he didn't focus on anything for a moment, and a shudder went through him, his normally pale skin almost white.
“And a glowing mark on his hand. But even without that, I think we'll do all right. We're not exactly defenseless.”
The look Steve gave him was filled with hunger and longing, before he made his way above to take Clint out.
Edax received no reply, and just the very hint of a smile crossed his face, placing his hand on the ice, and giving a gentle caress, as if he could touch the goateed face.
“You are as well,” Steve replied, a small smile on his face. “But I am not someone who would want a quick tumble in the sheets. And that's not even why I brought you here. How can you be so distracting?”
“Doesn't matter if your mana pool is low, Steve. You're still a super soldier.” Tony grinned as he managed to break into the system. He knew that they only had a short amount of time before the Nobodies approached.
“Not just,” said Rook. “There may come a time when the Inquisition is no longer needed. But there will always be people who need help, and their voices aren't always heard. It's true that this group will currently help the Inquisition, just like the Chargers do, but we...I want a group that can survive after, and still help those in need. Thedas will always need heroes.”
No matter what he did, all they could ever see was a man, a smart man, who threw money at problems, who was careless, who could never love...
“I remember him,” said Tony, smiling. “He was always very nice to me. We talked theory lots of times.”
“Captain?” interrupted FRIDAY. “Mr. Stephen Strange is here,” she continued, and for an AI, she managed to drip enough ice to keep several drinks cold. Vision gave a small smile.
Phantom, Tony hoped, concealed part of their movement, as they silently moved from hallway to hallway. For just a second, he thought of asking Axel to take them to Siren...to that other Maria...he had considered it so many times.
“Fucking spies,” mumbled Tony, fingers dancing along the keys. Warning lights were begin to appear on the screen, and soon he'd set off the alarms, he was sure.
Also, Phoenix. Do not get me started on Marvel Phoenix. There is none of that in this. Think of her as more a Pokémon... but an esper.
Tony sat quietly, waiting. The mention of the runes made him nervous. Had someone else done something similar to Steve as well? His heart pounding, Tony watched as carefully, Steve first removed his armor, unstrapping gauntlets, removing the chest plate...it seemed like a long process. His thought wandered just a bit, trying to find ways to make things a bit more efficient, something that offered protection, movement...
Tony thought of many fights he had been in, and none of them felt quite as surreal as this, even when they fought against Wanda. This was a fight out of a storybook, turned into a horror movie, mixed with an action flick.
Tony looked down at his chest. “Huh.  We can all be a group of freaks together.” Rook laughed, while Cullen and Cassandra shook their heads, bemused. The other elf watched quietly, just the hint of a smile on his face.
He woke up, the burning still present, and a different girl with red hair wiping the sweat from his forehead.
"Was it supposed to do that?" Dagna finally managed to ask. "That was amazing! The force of the runes, the lift, the..."
“Maker, no. You should have heard the words coming out of his mouth when he found out. He was furious that I put my life on the line like that, said I should have sought a regular mage's help.”
He tapped the table a few times, his thoughts and emotions moving like the water in a fast moving stream.
It was completely unreasonable. Steve knew it, and yet, he could not let it go, that one piece that sang of Tony.
In some ways, it was good. He ordered a giant futon to place in one of the rooms, with lots and lots of pillows, so that when everyone wanted to cuddle, they could. Steve and him still slept in the same room, though they didn't discuss anything further yet. Sometimes the girls joined them, usually accompanied by Natasha, sometimes with a few others. Spiderman came to live with them, including his aunt, which was an experience all of itself to tell her what her nephew had been up to...
It didn't help that Xion called a keyblade hours after the first meeting, a massive thing, taller than she was, simplistic, except that the metal looked like molten hematite.
“Very good, Captain,” said the voice of Stane. He stepped out from behind the trees, encased in armor of red lyrium, his eyes tinged. “I'm sure if I gave you time, you would even find more clues.”
“So our Tony has the ability to shoot magic around,” began Clint, “and now can seal up these doors and shit? It's your lucky day, Stark!”
“Sarcasm currently not appreciated, Birdman.” Axel caught the popcorn thrown in his direction, munching on it. “When Heartless or Nobodies steal a heart, they don't get it, though they keep trying, right? What happens is that it goes elsewhere, locked into an area that is the link between all worlds, Kingdom Hearts.”
“Each world is sealed, so you can't just randomly move between them,” said Aqua. “It's like a lock, that you can close or open. When the doors are opened, the darkness, the Heartless, can flood that world, try to take the hearts of that world.”
“It's all right. We were just going to have a nice chat, weren't we, Steven?” Tony asked. Steve hummed in response.
A girl, so young, stepped forward, a drawing pad in her hands, and she hunched over it, holding it tight, her blond hair pulled into a loose ponytail. Blue eyes looked at him, didn't waver, as she moved to stand beside him.
Steve's shield flew through the hair, hitting Ade in the stomach. Tony's heart clenched, but he only hesitated a moment, plunging the keyblade into the Heartless' chest. Blue eyes looked at him in shock.
And Natasha could hear that ineuendo a mile away. She stood up just a little, and leaned forward. The table grew quiet, and Bull's eyes turned towards her.
It didn't always work, they discovered. They'd talk about whatever came to mind, how much they hated some of the other scientists, how magic worked, their old home...
“You're still learning,” said Steve, ignoring the others. “What we experienced was definitely unexpected, and I'm betting it won't be the first time this happens. Yes, we probably should have made sure we were more informed before leaving, but I promise it's not the first time we've been caught off guard by our enemies.”
“It was a very small, barely there village, between Honnleath and Redcliffe, destroyed in the last blight, from what I heard. It was called America.”
“I want to announce to everyone our engagement, and fight with the stupid people who object, and celebrate with the family. I want to do all the planning and arguing over colors and flowers, and I want to watch you walk down the aisle, looking beautiful. I want to wake up next to you every day...”
“The same, Lady Vivienne,” replied Tony, grinning. Apparently, Vivienne had talked with Steve before.
The Captain...was strange. An odd mix of innocence and the threat of violence hung about him. He didn't talk about his past often, simply because he didn't feel there was much about it until he joined the Templars.
“It's very easy to dismiss another's ideas as foolish, but very different to sit down and discuss matters with an open mind. All ideas should be considered, not all followed.”
Steve nodded, staring at his hands. “You showed me something deeply personal before, not afraid of what others would say. I'm...not as brave. I'm afraid...I'll have to take my shirt off.”
Tony did not recognize this voice, and he immediately tensed. Compassion squeezed his shoulder, but didn't move. The elf that approached him was entirely bald, no tattoos, so not Dalish, and wore the simpliest of clothes. Something made Tony uneasy. He could sense something on the very edges of his mind. Not a demon, he could tell, but something else. A well of power that just skirted the edges of his mind, but not malevolent, either. Oh good...a mystery in a conundrum; just what he always wanted.
And the realization hit Steve like a train, his eyes widening, even as Tony simply leaned back, the armor disappearing like it never existed, as he hit the magic barrier around the building, and the arc reactor turned dark.
The woman's smile grew larger, and she nodded. “Yes. My name's Aqua. Thank you for seeing me. If you trust me, I brought breakfast. I saw what happened yesterday...I'm sorry.”
Steve sighed, rubbing his neck. “Not particularly. We could swim to one of the larger islands, something I'm not terribly keen on, given that we have no idea where we are, what's in the water, and what we'll meet. We don't know how long or if the others can find us here...”
He didn't pause, starting a brutal pace that caused Tony to shout on each thrust in, moaning with each slide out. Steve grunted with each push of his hips, nipping at his neck.
Steve sighed. “I suppose we should start sending out messages to Spiderman and other younger kids, giving them the same offer, then.”
With a snarl, Tony tore the buttons off of Steve's shirt as he yanked it open. They paused for a moment, both of them staring at the other, and Tony watched as Steve's eyes dilated.
“I'm sure there's a few people we can ask to join the Avengers here,” said Natasha. “Then we can figure out what group goes fighting the Heartless.”
Steve remedied the issue, pulling Tony onto his lap, wrapping his arms around him. In a minute, he would help his genius up, to go get showered and changed, then go join the others. Tomorrow, they would come up with a plan, start training more. They all thought that maybe these people would have to scramble to regroup. They were wrong.
“James and Cullen, I've told personally, recently. Cullen's told the Inquisition, which is probably part of the reason that he recommended me to the team.”
“You've got to be kidding me?” Tony asked, even as he took Clint's hand and was pulled up into the vents.
Natasha shook her head, helping Tony up and out, and ignoring everyone else. She had wanted a quiet evening, not this drama, but at least the news would now pass through, and they'd get it over with.
Ramuh nodded. “Yes, that is one of our names. We have been called many things; esper, aeon, monsters, just to name a few.”
One held the arc reactor, and his hand immediately went to his chest. He felt just a bit relieved to feel it in his chest. The middle cradled Bucky's bionic arm, and the last...
“I find,” he said, somewhat still detached between emotions and body, “that I find myself at a disadvantage, Lady...”
Again, they all stared, but this time at Clint. The man in question sighed, his ears twitching just a little. “Yes, I'm an elf. My parents were in the alienage, and decided while everyone else picked fancy elfy names, they were going to give me a human name. Hence, Clinton, which I hate.”
Jan wrapped her arms around him and squeezed tight. “You’re my best friend, Tony, and as your best friend I have to ask. Are you going to do something about Steve? He’s been staring at you ever since lecture started.”
Loki crossed his arms and rested his weight on one hip. “Are you deaf? I said you’re blocking the door.” He paused and peered at Tony. “What happened to you? You seem different.” He flicked a hand dismissively. “Not that I care. I’m just asking so I can make fun of you later.”
Tony groaned and rolled his eyes. “Fury can go clean his eyepatch or whatever he does. I’m going down to the workshop. Alert me only when it’s absolutely time to head out.”
Steve looked even more constipated than before. “Just hear me out. I want to apologize for yesterday. I was out of line and you don’t deserve what I said about you.”
He stands under the light and looks out into the dimness. “Yeah. Yeah, just tired. Nothing a good night’s sleep won’t fix.” He takes one last glance before stepping into the elevator and letting it take him up to the penthouse. Lethargy pulls at his bones as he stares at the closed elevator doors. He’s just tired from binge-working. He just needs to sleep. Captain America’s either rubbing off on him, or he’s experiencing premature aging. With that thought, he crawls into bed and closes his eyes.
Tony dropped from his shoulders and staggered to the side. “Oh thank God. Open air!” His legs gave and he collapsed to the ground in an ungainly heap with a groan. “I’ve never been happier to see the Timefog.”
“Right. Making sure that I’m doing okay. Did Fury also tell you to do a psychiatric evaluation on the narcissistic man-child that he sent for this highly important mission?” Tony looked at the readings from his gauntlet’s holographic display. “Because clearly I can’t be trusted to do anything important by myself, because I’m careless and don’t care to think about anything other than fooling around, making myself look good, and throwing money around. Right?”
He took a few more steps and looked around. The suite looked just the way he’d left it earlier that day. He glanced back at the open elevator for support, then walked further into the open-plan living area. The silence was a palpable heaviness around him and he flexed his fingers. The servos in his gauntlet whirred, but even they seemed muffled. Tony crossed the room to look out the expansive windows.
Tony stood so fast his chair toppled backwards. “Oh shit. Is this the part where I run for my life?” He took another glance at the failing lights and the encroaching darkness before running to the elevator. He jabbed the button for the penthouse and held down the close door button. Just as the last light in the lab failed, the doors slid closed. Something solid and heavy beat against the reinforced metal and Tony scrambled into a far corner. He wheezed, high and sharp, as the elevator shook.
It was late by the time he stumbled into bed, the caffeine finally wearing off and eyes dry from staring at bright screens all day long. JARVIS said something but he could barely hear him over the pounding of his headache. Tony managed to mumble something generic in reply before he pulled the covers over himself and passed out.
Tony swayed, but his eyes stayed steady. It entranced him, filled his being with something barely comprehensible. His thoughts stilled under gossamer threads of quiet. He pressed a hand against the glass to steady himself.
Tony narrowed his eyes. “There’s no if. Of course Iron Man can defeat Captain America. Fine, I’ll do a training session with you. Just for a test run. Obviously I’m going to effortlessly beat you.”
Tony winced and rubbed the spot she poked. “Okay, fine. Do you want proof too? A selfie of Steve and me at the Power Gym? Or wherever?”
With a faint buzz, the lights clicked back on. Tony’s breath caught in his throat. Instead of the sleek shine of metal, everything was covered in a strange grayish dust. The lab looked like it’d been abandoned for a long time, and everything was still. The lights flickered ominously at random intervals. Tony couldn’t determine if it was the lighting that cast everything in a chilling purple-gray, or if the air itself was that hue.
It also turned out Steve actually tried to schedule a training session through JARVIS. Fortunately, JARVIS was intuitive enough to delay it. Unfortunately, JARVIS was a blabbermouth and told Steve Tony was feeling unwell.
He strode towards the figure. “There’s something wrong with the suit. JARVIS isn’t answering and nothing seems to be working.”
Steve beamed. “Thanks, Tony. I’ll see you tomorrow at 7 PM then, at the Power Gym.” He quickly left with what looked suspiciously like a bounce to his step.
Tony wheezed with effort. “Get out now. You weakened it when you separated it from its energy source.” He coughed, wet and laboured. “It won’t attack while it’s recuperating.”
Tony didn’t really remember Monday or Tuesday. If he thought about it, he could dredge up vague snatches of memory. Jan fluttering about in equal amounts of excitement and worry. Lecture moving at a snail’s pace. Steve’s judgmental yet concerned face. Being electrocuted in Professor Pym’s lab. The Winter Soldier’s abysmal emo music in the quad. The last one he definitely did not make up.
He stood there, in front of the Dojo, quiet and motionless. He still couldn’t pick up anything peculiar with his senses. But suddenly, a flash of colour in the corner of his eye. Steve turned his head and looked. And did a double-take.
Tony sighed into her hair. “He’s been trying to talk to me ever since that mission into the Timefog. He keeps going on about friendship and teamwork. It’s quite confusing. Maybe he wants something from me?”
In any other circumstance, Steve would let it go, because it was Tony and Tony Stark did what Tony Stark wanted. But he took a closer look and saw what probably passed as sleepwear for the other man. No one else was around, and no one was accompanying Tony.
Wasp’s voice spiked sharply in excitement. “Right?! You’ll look so hot in this, the campus won’t know what hit it!” She settled down and grabbed his hand. “But really, you look under the weather. Are you sick?”
Data collection in itself was a simple affair. What was not simple was the red, white, and blue figure hovering in the background like an overgrown guard dog. Tony grumbled under his breath and tried his best to ignore Captain America. He managed to last half an hour before cracking. “This isn’t getting us anywhere. I’m going in. Track our progress, JARVIS.”
The branches shook furiously and flexed like claws. A resounding growl came from the trunk and the ground rippled.
A tremendous crack thundered behind them. One of the tree’s branches cracked and snapped, still attached to the trunk by the splintered bark. Black liquid dripped and sizzled from the fierce heat and licking flames.
“This isn’t funny, buddy.” Tony blinked in the darkness, but all he got were bright bursts of light flashing behind his eyelids. Looking at glowing holograms for so long had made it difficult for his eyes to adjust.
Steve jerked as if he’d been hit. “That’s not what I- Tony, no. Look, I’m sorry about going off on you earlier today. It was out of line, and I shouldn’t have said the things I said.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “I’m going in to get better readings. Being outside the Timefog isn’t really giving me anything new. Don’t worry your old self, Cap. It’s only a little ways in.” He smirked to himself. “You can sit this one out if it’s giving you the heebie jeebies.”
Then, like a switch had been flipped, the fog slipped away. Tony took in a ragged breath of air, glad for the respite. A tall shape emerged in the murky middle distance and he breathed out a sigh of relief. “Steve, there you are! Didn’t you hear me calling?”
Tony ducked his head and fiddled with the coffee cup. “Right. Uh. Yeah, sure. I’d like that.” He ignored his burning cheeks. “But try not to dent the suit, okay. I just cleaned it the other day.”
Today was no exception. The two of them had another argument after classes ended for the day. It was another stupid fight where Tony tried to be as obnoxious as he could and Steve exercised his disapproval. He had to admit, he’d said some words he wasn’t proud of, but Steve had hit back just as hard, pointing out all of Tony’s shortcomings like he was reading off a checklist. All of it had lodged itself in Tony’s brain, bouncing around like a pinball game with no game over.
Tony shook his head in consternation. Jan being concerned was one thing, but Cap? Totally random. Maybe Steve was feeling particularly in touch with his emotions today.
?!” A hand latched onto Steve’s throat with inhuman strength and pressed him down onto the ground. “Make it stop, now!”
“Tony, what’s wrong?” Steve set the torch down at the fire and grabbed Tony by the shoulders to bring him back to the fire. “Stay close to the fire. I need to get to the tree.”
But he really only remembered the overwhelming sense of fatigue. Being distracted. Staring off into nothing. The effects of coffee were short-lived, and several times he caught himself nodding off. Seemingly losing his sense of direction even though he helped design the campus.
He gave a choked scream and spun on his heel, whipping his hand up on instinct, forgetting that the repulsors weren’t working.
It was late, and Steve should really be back in his dorm and sleeping, but he had too much energy and an intense need to burn it off. That was why he found himself at the Robo Dojo fighting robots at two in the morning. If he thought too much about it, Steve would feel guilty about the rampant waste of breaking so many robots. At the same time, he knew how flippant Tony was about the damage and would probably see it as a challenge to make more resilient robots. He was hoping Tony had learned his lesson after the whole Ultron debacle, but Tony’s enthusiasm can run away with him sometimes. More like most of the time. That was probably why Tony and Jan were such good friends.
As if triggered by the sound of his voice, the overhead lights flickered rapidly. A low, grinding moan echoed about the room, and one by one the lights started failing.
He’d just finished finalizing the second project for Stark Industries when the overhead lights flickered. Tony sent the project back to R&D and squinted at his to-do list. “JARVIS, I’ll go to bed when I’m done. And I’m almost done.” He opened up the first project on the list for Pym. “Just a bit longer.”
On the far edge of campus, a figure walked at a sedate pace towards the undeveloped side of the school. A figure that was wearing gleaming red jet boots. With a gauntlet. Tony was walking away from campus at two in the morning.
Tony looked at him incredulously. “Do you hear yourself, Cap? Interpersonal relationships? Building a foundation? You sound like a SI new employee icebreaker. Not that I attend those. But I assume if I were to go to one, it would be the exact same.”
It’s really no stretch to find themselves kicked out of class immediately after. It’s okay though, because the lecture material was really boring and Tony knew it all already. And it freed up more time for Jan and him to hang out together.
Tony groaned and pulled the covers up to his chin. Dr. Pym’s lab was first thing in the morning, and he needed to be awake enough to even try to avoid getting electrocuted.
She shook Tony’s arm aggressively. “Remember what you promised me! I expect selfies! I love you!” She smacked a kiss onto Tony’s cheek before jabbing a finger at Steve. “You!”
The penthouse suite was just as dusty and dim as the lab, but the lights were calm and steady. He stepped out of the elevator cautiously, but there were no strange noises and he could not feel the presence from the lab. The air was still stale and oppressive, and Tony tried in vain to clear his throat.
Steve watched in horror as tendrils of black seeped through the whites of Tony’s eyes and into his skin. Steve gripped the back of his neck. “Sorry, Tony, but I have to do this.”
Ice slithered up his arms, up his neck and over his scalp. Distantly, he heard something whisper in the breeze.
By the time Tony realizes what’s happening, it’s too late. The realization sinks into him like ice, and then he just feels- nothing. The emptiness should’ve frightened him, but apathy spreads until he’s left staring at the wall of his workshop. Tony blinks. He looks down at the soldering iron in his hand and wonders why, and if, it mattered.
JARVIS highlighted the rapidly approaching figure on the HUD. “I do believe that is Captain Rogers, Sir.”
Something grabbed onto his ankle. Steve looked down, making to jerk his leg away from impending danger. He breathed in, sharp, and crouched down. “Tony, you’re awake. Are you okay?”
A faint rumble rattled the ground and Steve quickly checked his pockets. He pulled out the lighter and snatched up the driest plant material he could find. In no time at all, he had both a steady fire going on the ground and a makeshift torch in his hand. He turned to place Tony closer to the fire for safety only to find him missing.
Tony didn’t dare move. His breathing sounded harsh in his ears and he swallowed, trying to control himself. The stale air stuck uncomfortably to the back of his throat. The lab was eerily still and he was the only one in it, but he could feel a presence, crawling at the back of his mind, watching him.
Tony waved a hand. “I’ve got SI business to take care of tomorrow. If you want your training session it has to be on a weekday, after class.”
All told, it took him three hours to get ready. He blamed it on sleep deprivation and a strange feeling of preoccupation, even though he wasn’t thinking of anything in particular. The shower itself took an hour just because he kept staring off into space. An inordinate amount of time was wasted with him standing in his generous walk-in closet gazing blankly at his clothing options. At one point, he’d come back to himself, one hand on his beloved cheese fridge’s open door, looking unseeingly past all the cheese.
Tony smiled at her. Jan was the best, really. “No, just feel a bit off. I didn’t sleep too well last night.”
Jan huffed. “Oh, Tony. Maybe he actually means that he wants to be friends with you! I understand where you’re coming from, but sometimes an offer of friendship really is an offer of friendship.”
The two men stared at each other. Steve cleared his throat again and shifted his weight. Tony raised his eyebrows at the other man’s uncharacteristic nervousness. “Can I help you?”
Tony almost looked like he was resting against the wall of the cave, face lax and eyes closed. Tree roots wound themselves heavily around his torso, pressing him into the wall of packed soil and pale thin strands of plant material. An arm was flopped to the side, with a thin root wrapped around it. His other limbs were covered in more roots. One root in particular snaked up Tony’s neck and nestled along his jaw, pale feathery filaments reaching toward the cut in his cheek in a mockery of gentleness. The arc reactor shone through a gap, throwing everything into sharp relief.
Steve grimaced. “Don’t distract me, Tony.” His muscles bulged as he tensed. “Loki is right. You’re heading away from the Tower.”
It was like a horror video game, but he was the protagonist, and there was no quit game option. He rubbed his face into his pillow and tried to shake off the chill.
Jan rolled her eyes. “Boys.” She gave Tony a quick hug. “See you later, I’ll message you!” She flounced away, disappearing into the shifting mass of students.
For once, he was glad Steve had insisted on tagging along. Who knew what would’ve happened if Captain America wasn’t there? Tony would probably be dead or dismembered in the Timefog and no one would know or care.
“You have to burn it. That’s the only way to stop it.” Cold sweat beaded on Tony’s forehead, mixing with the dirt and dust. “You can’t kill it, Steve. I don’t think it can be killed.”
The Timefog felt as ominous as it looked from outside. The coolness of the purple-gray haze caressed Tony’s face in a way that felt eerie and menacing. His neck prickled and goosebumps went up his arms even in the temperature-controlled suit. Unlike a natural fog, there was none of the associated moisture. Tony supposed if one wanted to be precise, calling the Timefog a haze would be more accurate. But then again, ‘Timehaze’ just didn’t have the same appeal as ‘Timefog’.
Tony groaned and rolled over until his face was pressed into the pillow. He shouldn’t have to think about Captain America’s motives in bed. That sounded very inappropriate and dirty. He snorted into his pillow. Maybe he should try that against Steve in training. It might give him an advantage. Offend Steve’s old fashioned sensibilities, get him flustered. Throw him off balance long enough for Tony to get a hit in.
Tony jerked, choking in a ragged breath. “JARVIS? What-” He glanced about wildly. He was standing at the glass walls that lead out to the landing pad. Outside, the campus was quiet, foliage swaying gently in the breeze. Pre-dawn light painted the horizon a glowing orange. There was no haze, no dust. “What’s going on?”
Steve could do nothing but watch as the black liquid gathered itself and slipped down through the cracks in the ground, out of sight and reach.
The ensuing silence made Tony go cold. “JARVIS?” He checked the suit. It was still powered on and he was clearly able to move about. Except JARVIS didn’t reply and any other functions that would’ve been useful to him were equally non-responsive.
Eventually the fire exhausted itself. What was left was a blackened, burnt out husk with only the largest boughs still attached.
Jan nearly shrieked. “What!” She ignored other students shushing her. “Steve Rogers asked you out and you fob him off onto your AI assistant?!”
Tony’s eyebrows climbed higher. “Okay? Sure.” Steve led him out of the lecture hall to one of the more secluded areas of the park.
Steve squeezed his shoulder. “Not your fault. I can get us out, but you’ll have to hang on to me, okay?” He draped Tony over his back and made sure his grip around his shoulders was secure before standing.
Tony’s head lolled limply against his shoulder. “If it makes you feel better. I don’t think I can stand anyway, so you’re going to have to carry me.” He wiped ineffectually at the black stains around his mouth. “I think we’re safe now. From it, at least.”
A viscous liquid oozed out of the broken bark and Steve hoped it was sap. He highly doubted it was sap though, for it was a strange dirty shade of oily dark and stunk of festering rot.
Tony stood facing into the Timefog, hot rod red boots toeing the wispy purple fog. Something resembling an amalgamation of panic and Tony’s name tore itself from Steve’s throat. There was no indication that Tony heard him, and Steve knew that no matter how quickly he moved, he would not get there in time to stop him.
At first glance the tree seemed barren, but upon closer inspection he could see the beginning of buds emerging from the bark. They were not the bright waxy green of budding leaves, but a dark faded colour, leeching the surrounding light.
Loki sniffed. “I was going to challenge you to a dance competition, but I have to say I agree. It would be too easy a win against you in your current state. I’ll challenge you another time.”
On the ground, amongst the swirling wisps of fog was a thin trail of cheese crumbs. The crumbs were spaced several feet apart. Steve knelt down to inspect them. He might not be a cheese connoisseur, but even he could tell it was a sharp, crumbly cheese. Steve looked in the direction of the cheese trail. Six feet in and the cheese crumbs started to look hazy. Several feet more and there was only swirling fog.
They hugged for a good moment before Tony drew back. “Okay. Now, please tell me there’s a good selection of cheese here, because I’m craving some cultured milk products.”
Jan leapt up and shrank down to Wasp size. She hovered in Steve’s face. “If I hear anything about you hurting Tony, you’ll regret it!” With that, she flew off with a zoom.
They stared at each other in silence for a beat, before Steve twitched. He grimaced and huffed. He looked like he was getting his teeth pulled. “Would you be free for that training session we talked about?”
Tony groaned and waved a hand. “Fine. Whatever. Just keep your hands to yourself.” He turned and marched into the Timefog without waiting for a response.
Something lodged itself into the tread of his boot. It was so incongruent with the surrounding grassy field that it made Steve pause. He looked at the patch of grass he was standing on and stared. What looked like pale yellow crumbs stood out from the green grass. Looking closer, Steve realized they were small pieces of crumbled cheese. He lifted his foot and almost laughed at the sheer strangeness. A chunk of cheese the size of a quarter was wedged into the groove. Steve dug it out and shook his head. Leave it to Tony to leave a cheese trail.
A weak chuckle sounded by his ear. “Getting a piggyback ride from Captain America himself. Who would’ve thought?”
By the time class ended, Tony and Jan had sat themselves on top of a picnic table, onto their seventh coffee of the day and basking in the afternoon sun. A shadow towered over them and Jan gasped loudly.
He picked up the torch and ran for the tree. Steve opened up the lighter and splashed the lighter fluid onto the trunk. He thrust the torch at it and the ground bucked. He kept his balance until a terrible noise rent the air and brought him to his knees.
The longer he sat there, the more he became aware of a faint creaking sound. It seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere at once. The sound of it sent chills up his arms and spine, and the hairs on the back of his neck stood on end. It echoed, intersected with the flickering lights, a disordered pattern that sent Tony’s pulse leaping. Something about it was old and familiar, but he knew he’d never come across it before in his life.
Tony rolled his eyes. “There is it again. ‘You don’t care’, blah blah blah. Rhodey’s given me that speech before, Cap. Don’t you worry, you’re just reiterating everything everyone’s said to me at one time or another. Just relax and enjoy the Timefog, why don’t you.”
Jan made a noise and hugged him. “You flatterer, you. Thanks so much for coming, but if you feel like you need to go home, just go, okay? I don’t want to contribute to you feeling worse. I can always throw another party when you’re feeling better.”
The hand on his shoulder stopped him. “Tony, you’re still going in the wrong direction.” Steve took pity and turned him around. “The Tower is that way.”
His face was pale and sallow. Dark smudges standing out from under his eyes spoke to the lack of quality sleep he was getting. His cheeks looked sunken and thin, and the cut on his face was an angry red, throbbing faintly in time to his pulse. His hair was in disarray, a complete removal from the usual stylish look he went for.
Steve let himself be pulled along. “You look really pale, Tony. You weren’t hurt anywhere else, were you?”
A faint glimmer caught his eye. Something was glowing under the carpet of roots. A blue that Steve was very familiar with.
Hugging Jan always made Tony feel better. He tucked his chin into her hair and sighed. “You’re the best, Jan. What do you say to a selfie?”
Steve dodged branches and roots and was about to grab his shield when he was slapped hard into the ground. He grimaced at the web of roots in his line of sight and made to pull the offending branch off.
Steve followed the trail, senses on high alert for anything and everything. It didn’t hurt to be too careful. The hush that was characteristic of natural fog took on a more insidious character in the Timefog. It wrapped around Steve, hid things from his eyes and ears. But no matter how difficult it was, he was determined to find Tony.
Tony looked up from the chunk of wires he was holding. His neck cracked multiple times in quick succession. “Already?” He blinked and squinted at his phone. The lock screen lit up with the JARVIS-set reminder and two messages from Jan. The first message was a selfie of her in her latest outfit. The second message was a follow-up on how she was going to design Tony a matching set. He smiled at that and fired off a few emojis.
Seven minutes and fifteen seconds of silence passed before Steve opened his mouth. “I’ve been meaning to talk to you.”
Steve spluttered and Tony smacked him on his very firm arm. “Don’t get your panties in a bunch. It’s just Loki being Loki. You know how he is.”
Tony simpered. “What a gentleman, walking me home.” He rubbed at his face and ignored the stinging in his cheek. “Well, come on then. I want to go home.”
Several paces away, a disturbance in the soil caught his eye. What looked to be the hard edge of a circle was pressed into the ground. He’d seen that exact size and pattern many times at the Academy, usually glowing and streaking through the sky. Suffice it to say, Steve was very familiar with the tread of Tony’s jet boots.
He should probably apologize to Steve in the morning. Thinking back, their argument after class had been completely silly and pointless. Way to annoy the one guy who would volunteer to have your back, Stark. That and the whole Timefog business had turned the day into a gong show. Then again, if Steve hadn’t been there annoying him with his all-American face, he probably wouldn’t have gone into the Timefog in the first place.
“Is it that hard to say yes to training?” Steve took them down another street and the main entrance of the Tower glowed with a welcoming light. “Besides, I thought you’d want bragging rights if you take down Captain America.”
Tony gazed out the windows. His hand grew lax and fell to his side. Something whispered at the back of his mind, indistinct and shadowy.
“We have to start somewhere.” Steve forged resolutely ahead. “Teamwork doesn’t just happen spontaneously. You have to build a foundation. Work on interpersonal relationships.”
He stepped into the Timefog and it swarmed around him, wrapping him in a blanketing quiet. Steve knew without looking behind him that he would not see the campus. The fog had the strange ability to conceal things even when it seemed to go against the laws of physics. All it took was one step in the wrong or right direction to end up in a different place.
“Fire.” Tony let go of Steve’s leg. “You have to burn it, Steve.” He had to stop to catch his breath. “That’s the only way.”
“I believe you were sleepwalking, Sir. You fell asleep in the lab, then came up here. You stood here for two hours and forty-seven minutes. Your vitals became increasingly distressed, so I tried to wake you.” JARVIS paused. “You were unresponsive to my calls for twenty-three minutes, Sir.”
He really wasn’t sure how it became that odd. The last thing Tony remembered was trying to improve the flight efficiency of his hoverboard. That probably explained the flight stabilizers. But the espresso machine and air conditioning were still a mystery. He shrugged and scrapped the file.
Tony jerked his head away and patted her back. “Shush, you. And he’s not asking me out, he’s asking if he could pummel me and my armour into the mats. Not in the sexy way.” He paused. “Wow, I’ve never seen Steve’s face that colour before.”
Steve waited, but the roots underfoot didn’t show any signs of awareness or mobility. Just normal tree roots then. He hoped.
Even with minimal lighting, Steve could tell Tony looked unwell. That was an understatement. The paleness of Tony’s skin contrasted unpleasantly with the heavy darkness under his eyelids. His face was streaked with dirt, and his breathing was so slight Steve had to watch carefully to make sure he was still alive.
Tony bit into a slice of Port Salut and savoured the taste. He shrugged. “I don’t know what to say. I’m just really tired lately. And yesterday night, I had this crazy dream.” He ate the rest of the slice, even though he no longer felt hungry.
Tony wiped at his face and his fingers came away with a thin smear of blood. “But I don’t sleepwalk.”
Tony flapped his hand in Loki’s general direction. “I know how to get home, Loki. It’s fine, I can handle myself. Go have fun with your dance battles.”
He ripped his leg away from the root trying to grasp him and brought the edge of his shield down on it when it reached towards him.
“Dinner after then!” Steve opened and closed his mouth like a fish out of water. “Dinner- I mean.” Steve took a deep breath in and let it out in a rush. “Jan was right. I was trying to ask you out but I couldn’t get it out. But I also want to spar with you. So I guess what I’m really asking is if you’d want to spar with me and then go for a dinner date after.” He quirked a smile at Tony.
That probably explained why Steve took up a good portion of the few memories he could actually recall about those two days. Super soldier turned tour guide. It would’ve been funny if Tony wasn’t the one acting like a freshman on his first day at school.
Tony clambered to his feet and realized he was alone. The Timefog was so thick he could barely see his hands. “Steve?” The name was quickly swallowed by the haze. Tony looked about. “Steve, where are you?” There was no answer.
Tony’s brain felt like it was steeped in molasses. “What? No, nothing. I’m just tired. I need to go home.”
“Welcome home, Sir.” JARVIS’ voice was always a soothing balm to a harrowing day. “Might I remind you of the project Director Fury assigned you? You are to observe and take readings from the edge of the Timefog in two hours’ time.” Or not. JARVIS was a taskmaster, that’s what he was.
True to his word, Tony spent all of Sunday holed up in the lab. The only times he stopped working were for meal breaks, bathroom breaks, and Jan breaks. Early on in their friendship, Tony had learned the hard way the consequences of ignoring Jan for too long when she messaged him. Of course, she was perfectly understanding and accommodating if there were legitimate reasons for him not answering. Tony understood the need for immediate feedback, especially when it pertained to new ideas and breakthroughs and you needed someone to bounce ideas off of. Really, they were two peas in a pod. That was why they were best friends.
Normally, Tony would have replied with something smart, but terror still clung to him. “I- I don’t know. Let’s get out of here. Fury’s got all the data he needs.” He grabbed Steve’s elbow and tugged.
Another day, another argument. Sometimes, it seemed like all Tony ever did was go to school and fight with Steve. That was his schedule, wake up, go to class, pick a fight with Steve, and then home again and work.
The noises of a full suit of armour falling to the ground were quickly dampened by the fog and petered out. Tony groaned and winced at the sudden pain in his cheek. He prodded his cheek and his gauntlet came away red and wet. He’d cut himself on a bit of exposed rock. It was only a few drops of blood, but it had smeared darkly across the rock and a lone withered tree root.
Steve pressed his lips together in a thin line. They had to get out before anything else happened. He looked up at the ceiling where he fell from. The hole was still there, but new growth was visible at the edges. He used the shield to enlarge the hole enough so both of them would be able to get out easily.
He looked at the screen and nodded approvingly. “You’re right. You’re totally right. Your talents know no bounds.”
Receiving no response, he tugged at one of the roots holding Tony in place. A faint hiss and it shifted, but stayed in place. Steve gripped it tight and ripped it away from Tony’s chest. A shriek pierced his ears and sticky black fluid sprayed across his arms.
Jan pouted. “You better not be saying that just to placate me! And you’re going to say yes to that date, you hear?” She prodded him hard in the chest.
The howl that erupted from the tree shook Steve’s bones and jarred his teeth. He ripped the shield out of the trunk and the howl turned into a shriek that threatened to rupture his eardrums.
He didn’t know how long he stood there, staring out into the bleakness, until he reflexively blinked away the dryness in his eyes. Tony skimmed through the decrepit buildings again, but his eyes were once more drawn to the same distant spot in the horizon. He stared at it until it seemed to expand and fill his entire field of view.
“Well, someone’s perky today.” Jan rested her chin on a palm and dimpled her cheeks at him. “I’m glad you’re feeling better. You even look better. You had me really worried the last two days.” Somewhere in the background, the lecturer was droning on about something or other.
Tony coughed and took a shuddering breath. He squinted up at Steve, eyes bleary but clear of black. “I’m never doing anything with the Timefog ever again.” He shifted gingerly and groaned hoarsely. “I think you can let me up now, Cap. The worst seems to be over.”
Almost as if sensing his mounting anxiety, the fog thickened even more, until it was a roiling wall penning Tony in where he stood. He swallowed past the lump in his throat.
Jan gave a little ‘aww’. “Was it that mission Fury sent you on? The Timefog always gives me the creeps.”
It was almost anticlimactic when he finally saw it. The odd hulking shape in the near distance. Finger-like projections reaching toward the sky in some sort of twisted, gnarled display. It seemed to change shape every time he blinked.
“Ensuring the safety of the students is a good use of my time, Tony.” Steve looked at him with earnestness in his eyes. “I know we don’t see eye to eye, but your safety is still important to me.”
Tony’s heart lurched. Goosebumps skittered from his scalp down his spine. A blink of the eyes, and the shape subtly shifted. Tony’s breath left him in a quiet wheeze. He blinked again and the shape suddenly seemed bigger. He stared hard at the form and willed his eyes to not blink until his eyes watered.
They picked through one of the available cheese platters, undisturbed by the other party goers. After a quiet moment, Jan placed her hand on Tony’s knee. “Did you want to talk about it?”
A spasm ran through the other man. “Steve, Steve, it’s too hot. I can’t do it. Get it away from me. Steve!” Tony grabbed at him, fingers white with effort and panic.
Tony’s shoulders tensed. “You already apologized yesterday, so I’m not sure why you’re still hung up about it. And sure, everyone’s friends and we’re all happy. Can you let go of me now? Because I’m getting hives from all this mush.”
Jan linked their arms together and led him towards the bar. “Nothing beats your cheese fridge, Tony, but I did curate an impressive collection, if I say so myself. I expect an in-depth review. Thoughts, impressions, praise, criticism, everything.”
The Timefog was sedate as he retraced their steps, following the trail Tony left, and he instinctually knew that they wouldn’t encounter any danger along the way.
Tony shivered. “Yeah. I decided to go in to get better readings. But then I thought I saw something, and JARVIS was acting up. But hey, got some fresh new readings for Fury, so success?”
“What is it, did you see something?” Steve peered into the fog behind Tony before his eyes snapped back to his face. “You’re bleeding.” He used his free hand to wipe the blood from Tony’s face.
A low rumble reverberated through the floor, travelling up Tony’s legs. The lights flickered, and a shape coalesced in the reflection captured by the glass.
“Oh. I guess so.” Tony hummed. “He also really wants to do a training session with me, but I fobbed him off on JARVIS.”
A huff of displaced air stirred up the strange gray dust. Heart stuttering, Tony turned slowly to look. He choked down a snort of disbelief and blinked rapidly. The elevator doors stood open. The lights within shone with a steady glow.
Tony brought a hand to his chest in mock affront. “Janet van Dyne, are you accusing me of not always looking my best?”
Steve’s eyes roamed his face, unconvinced. “If you say so, Tony. Get some rest, will you? I’ll see you around.” He patted Tony’s shoulder awkwardly, then strode away.
!” Tony threw his head against the hard ground and screamed. His voice climbed in pitch, higher and higher, until it was overlaid with an inhuman, unnatural tone. He thrashed and seized, and Steve was forced to lie on top of him, using his body weight to hold him down.
Music had been blasting from the lab’s speakers ever since he’d stepped foot into the space. It was currently playing through Playlist #57. Tony spun a hologram depicting a water filtration device in the air. He saved the project, finalized it, and sent it to R&D. Ever since the nightmare, silence gave him the creeps. Strange sounds seemed to emerge from the silence, but JARVIS was never able to pick anything up. Music filled the space, made it much more difficult for the silence to creep in. It’d gotten to the point where he wondered if he was finally losing it.
Sam gaped at them. “You guys look like you’ve been through the ringer.” He looked at Tony. “Actually, you look like you just survived the apocalypse.”
Tony sighed gustily, good mood gone. He landed (impressively, if he did say so himself) and addressed the man in front of him. “What are you doing here, Rogers? I've got important things to do, so you need to move.”
The surprise HYDRA attack in the late afternoon managed to put a dent in the armour and loosen several components, so Tony placed one of the more damaged pieces on the table in front of him. JARVIS helpfully brought up a schematic of the piece, a pauldron. The holographic 3D model glowed an electric blue, while the damaged parts were highlighted in red. Tony reached for a screwdriver and got to work.
A whisper of something threaded through the fingers of fog, almost dampened to silence but not completely. It slithered over the rocky ground, flitted out of reach of Steve’s combat boots, and twisted in the air. The sound dissipated as if it was never there. It was so quiet, Steve would’ve missed it if he wasn’t listening. A thin creak.
He received no answer and suddenly a sense of unease washed over him. Tony’s footsteps slowed until he came to an uncertain stumbling halt. “…Steve?”
The other man grimaced. “Look, I just-” He huffed. “I just think you can be better. I see all this potential in you but you just squander it. Like you don’t care.”
Tony landed on the Tower’s landing pad and stumbled. Even though it was a normal day and the campus hadn’t been invaded, he still felt as though he'd gone three rounds with both Hydra and AIM at the same time. His muscles ached and he had to fight to keep his eyes open.
A slithering sound caught his attention. With his eyes adjusted to the darkness, Steve spotted a tendril reaching towards his leg. He huffed and cut it down with the shield. The root seized and curled spastically into itself, before withdrawing into a crevice. Nothing else came at him, so Steve looked towards the only source of light in the cave.
Steve frowned and held onto the armour. “That’s not a good idea, Tony. Fury didn’t say anything about going in.”
He set off down the street after Tony. At first, it was a brisk walk. Soon, almost without Steve realizing, the brisk walk became a steady jog. A strange sense of urgency weighed down his gut like thick mud. The hair on his arms stood on end.
Steve took in a breath of night air. The coolness with that particular smell of nighttime was calming, but he still felt restless. He considered getting one last hit in at the Blasting Range before turning in for the night, but paused. A strange hush seemed to fall over the campus. He couldn’t detect anything out of the ordinary, except that the air seemed to have stilled.
“Tony!” It was futile. Steve knew that sound simply did not penetrate the Timefog. No sound came out, and no sound went in. Visual was only marginally better. Even with his senses enhanced, Steve could only see a few feet into the fog.
The sky was dark and filled with roiling clouds. There was no sun to be seen, or if there was, it was hidden behind the heavy cloud cover. Everywhere Tony looked, a strange haze clung, giving everything it touched an odd grimy tinge.
As lecture ended, Steve made himself known. Tony and Jan were just about to leave their seats, collecting their things. Tony sighed to himself. Steve was so tense he practically stood at attention, and his face looked as if he was waiting for a court martial.
He jammed the shield in again and held on as the ground trembled and bucked. The tree roared and the root nearest to Steve ripped out of the ground and towards him. He retrieved his shield and leapt away just as the root slammed into the space he occupied a moment earlier. He cut down a flailing limb. “That all you got? I’m not exactly impressed here.” He hefted the shield and threw it at the black wound.
He placed the chunk of cheese on the grass behind him and squared his shoulders. Tony had left a trail. That meant Tony wanted to be found, or intended to retrace his steps. A surge of affection rose up within him. Steve placed one foot into the fog. Tony wanted to be found, and Steve was going to find him, Timefog be damned.
It splintered and broke, and something inhuman howled. It reverberated through the air and Steve’s body, and he knew without a doubt it came from the tree.
Tony suddenly gagged and retched, and Steve managed to turn him on his side before he heaved and emptied the contents of his stomach. Black slime pooled and dripped onto the rocky soil. Tony heaved and hacked until nothing else came out.
He was standing just outside the doors of the club, and he didn’t know when or how he got there. Behind him, the music pounded away, much quieter enclosed within a building. In front, the campus spread out into the night, lights softening the darkness.
So what if he was self-centered and spoiled? And a multitude of other negative personality traits? He still had his Tower, JARVIS, and the armour. That was all one needed in life, really. After all, he was Tony Stark.
Steve steadied him effortlessly. “I’m going to ignore that.” The hand on Tony’s shoulder had migrated to his back at some point. “I’ve been thinking about this, and spending time in the Timefog confirmed what I was thinking.” He firmly turned them down a street when Tony kept walking forward. “We should spend more time together. Training. Work on our teamwork.”
Steve adjusted his shield. “I’m looking for someone. Brown hair, rocket boots, gauntlet. Seen him around?”
The tree caught fire quickly and everything cracked and heaved as roots pulled themselves out of the ground. It shrieked and something whipped by Steve so quickly he barely dodged it. He rolled to his feet and lunged away.
Steve leapt onto the carpet of roots and brought his shield down hard. The entire structure trembled and bucked as if trying to throw him off. But Steve held on, and brought his shield down again and again, until the web he stood on splintered and caved.
Tony woke with a full body jerk. He looked around his bedroom with a hammering heart until he realized it was the alarm that woke him. The last vestiges of an already forgotten dream slipped away, leaving only unease in its wake. He took a gulping breath and pressed a hand against the arc reactor. It was just a dream. He was fine. Everything was fine.
A groan, louder than the creak he’d heard earlier, split the air. The hair on the back of his neck stood on end. It had come from his twelve o’clock, but at a distance. And it was definitely not human. Before he could do anything, a multitude of sounds echoed out from the fog. Groans, cracks, a distant rumbling Steve felt through the soles of his boots. A low grinding noise, so tortuous it almost resembled a wail, resounded. Steve leapt to his feet and held the shield in front of him. Something was happening, and he didn’t know what.
Relationships were never Tony’s strong point. Engineering, inventing, tech, those were his selling points. And money. And fame. Maybe Steve wanted something. It was kind of sad how long it’d taken Tony to think of this, but in his defense he’d been having a long week. Maybe Steve wanted gear? Some more robots to beat up? A new arm for Bucky? Tony made a mental note to ask him when he saw him next. Everyone wanted something. He should also tell Steve that if he had a request, he could just tell him outright instead of going about it in such a roundabout way. Tony was always happy to build things for people and help them out.
Once he’s stepped out of the suit, Tony activates his wrist gauntlets once more before asking JARVIS to connect him to the team’s comms via his bluetooth earpiece.
Tony shoots the ceiling a fond smile before he looks down to meet Steve’s eyes. He claps a hand on one broad shoulder before he slowly (albeit reluctantly, though hopefully Steve doesn’t notice) pulls away from Steve’s firm but gentle hold on his arm.
“Sorry to be a disappointment, Rogers. I’m perfectly aware that I’ve got a laundry list of issues. Some days I hide it well, some days I don’t. And I’m so fucking sick and tired of everyone treating me like I’m like some delicate piece of china that’s gonna break every five fucking minutes. You may claim to know me, but as a matter of fact you
“You know,” he starts conversationally. He waits until Tony lifts his head to meet his gaze to continue speaking, “In the twenty-six months I’ve been awake in this century, you’re the first person to tell me those things. And it’s true. It can be overwhelming. Some days I feel like I’m going to lose my mind because there’s just
. Making enemies, however? Sure, he can probably write a dissertation about that. The thing is, the ugly truth is that Steve doesn’t know
“Like when we talk to him,” Steve explains. “If you’re unsure about something in regards to anything about him, don’t be afraid to ask. This Tony is, for lack of a better term, vulnerable right now. We have to be a lot more considerate towards him, also conscious of the manner we speak to him. I’m not saying that we have to treat him like a delicate piece of china. Just that… we have to be careful.”
When Tony finally looks up, his whiskey-colored doe eyes quickly fall on Steve’s. And Steve, who was more concerned than angry at the genius’s sudden disappearance in the first place, feels like he’s been gut-punched at being on the receiving end of the truly
Tony parks his car in the garage then quickly turns off the engine. He takes off his seatbelt but makes no move to get out of the car. Instead, he takes a deep breath and slowly lets it out through his mouth.
Steve’s birthday is coming up in a week and the engineer still hasn’t thought of what to gift the super soldier. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. How utterly preposterous, yes — no need to rub it in. Tony, for all the wealth he has and the genius-level intellect he possesses, he’s still unable to come up with
Bruce takes several deep breaths before he manages to reply, “I think it’s safe to say that as of this moment, it’s just Science
about Howard’s son that leaves Steve feeling very peculiar, and it certainly doesn’t help that Tony’s extremely easy on the eyes.
It’s in that moment that Tony decides to lift the faceplate, and Natasha meets his worried look with an impatient one of her own.
To be fair, this evening’s been eventful enough, so Steve’s more than willing to be a spectator of what he hopes is going to occur in the next five minutes.
He occupies himself with catching up to decades’ worth of information he’s missed since he was in the ice. It’s slow going, but the support Steve has received from his team in terms of helping him acclimatize to the new century has proved invaluable.
Pepper nods her head in understanding, and there’s a profound sadness in her eyes as she continues. “I— I can see it. And I won’t ask, or even demand you to give me answers. But you know I’m here for you, Tony. Right? And I’m willing to listen whenever you’re ready to talk. Okay?”
So to have Clint tell him all those things strikes a strong chord in Steve. He’s not hurt or offended, no. He’s
?” Bruce interrupts with a pointed look. Steve blinks and he flushes slightly at the mild accusation in the physicist’s tone. Bruce sighs again and then shakes his head. “I’m sorry, that was uncalled for. It’s just that sometimes, Steve, you forget that there’s more to a person than the persona they project, and Tony’s a prime example of that. He has more layers than an onion and has walls of defense higher than the Great Wall. We’re well aware that the two of you don’t really get along and aren’t the best of friends, but come
by that time! It’s just too coincidental for you to say these words to me when I’m stuck in my own head, not knowing if I’m just having a conversation with myself or my subconscious or… or — ah, fuck it, I don’t know. And I
“Just— next time you want to go out… maybe let us know first?” Steve adds with a beseeching look at him.
“That sounds like a good idea,” Tony nods at Bruce, his smile turning faint. His gaze turns inward then, as if he’s recalling a memory. It’s only thanks to the serum that Steve’s able to hear Tony mutter under his breath, “Maybe I’d get answers about why I’m in-between.”
“Okay, Rhodey, you’re on loudspeaker. You’re in a safe space?” Pepper asks as she increases the volume of her phone before directing it to the microphone that’s lodged in the monitor.
Right away, some pop music starts to play over the speakers. Steve, who’s been listening to all kinds of music ever since he’s bought his own iPod (
“Once again, sir, I must reiterate,” JARVIS answers, resigned. “I wouldn’t consider him a role model.”
Much to Steve’s amusement, Tony, who’s probably only realized he’s said more than he’s meant to, fidgets in his seat and tries to wave it off. “Eh, it’s fine. Any good American citizen would’ve done the same.”
“Can’t be a sexy thing,” Clint mutters to himself, only to yelp when Natasha slaps him upside the head.
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve says earnestly, and Tony fights back a shiver when he feels the other man’s breath ghost over the shell of his ear.
When Tony’s head is nestled comfortably once more on Steve’s shoulder, the super soldier selfishly allows himself this moment and rests his head on top of Tony’s, nose brushing lightly against the dark brown locks.
Of course, that was also the night Steve realized he harbored romantic feelings for a certain genius.
Steve, who’s bobbing his head to the beat of the catchy song, sees Tony smile at Natasha, eyes soft as he takes her hand and twirls the Russian to his side, Natasha following the brunet’s lead without question.
Tony sighs and rubs his eyes. “Hey, J. Any reason why Thor thought to leave his hammer here in the first place?”
“Who needs a nuke or lightning when we have a fully functioning suit with an arc reactor embedded in it?” Tony asks innocently. “It’s perfect, J.”
Tony’s silent as he contemplates his words. Without waiting for an answer, Steve starts preparing their food.
. Because if there’s one thing Tony is, it’s that he wants to take everything to the next level. From the gifts to the actual celebration, he wants this year to be better.
But Tony’s smiling, if a little reluctantly, as he says, “It’s fine. Now that you mentioned it, I’m curious myself. Thinking back to when I first woke up, I never felt the urge to swear. I mean, it’s
“Yeah, I know,” Tony cuts in. They hear the ping of the lift as they reach his floor, and before they step out, he quickly adds, “I know I didn’t have to, but I wanted to.”
After that, he tells Pepper the interaction he had with Steve at the communal kitchen from a few days ago, and how the super soldier’s words jarred some memories he wasn’t aware he could still recall until that fateful day. And how, in the years he’s been living and fighting with the Avengers, none of them knew of his musical abilities. How he accidentally on purpose kept it a secret from them. It wasn’t in his file for the proposal of The Avengers Initiative, that Tony knows of for certain. So in that time he decided to gift Steve with a private performance (which will happen sooner than later, he thinks with trepidation), Tony knows that it’ll be the most honest and most open he’ll ever be towards another person.
“St’ve,” Tony slurs, smile widening a fraction. In response, he feels one of Steve’s gloved hands run through his damp hair as dry lips press against his equally damp forehead. “Mmm…”
That’s perfectly fine with him. Unless he decides to cut this hide and seek game short and Tony goes home an hour earlier than planned.
Well, it looks like she’s finally going to bear witness to Tony lifting Mjölnir. She would’ve preferred it to happen under better circumstances, but she’s not one to look a gift horse in the mouth. So with a nod to signal her consent, Tony only hesitates a second before he grips the handle of Mjölnir and swiftly lifts it from her broken leg.
“Nobody wants a repeat performance of earlier,” Natasha pipes up with a knowing look. Everyone agrees with her with a shake of the head, and Steve doesn’t miss the guilty look that crosses over Clint’s face.
Disabling JARVIS was no trouble at all, although stepping into his lab for the first time since his accident was pretty tough. Guilt and shame still courses through Tony as he remembers the protests JARVIS voiced the entire time he input the codes to temporarily shut down his AI. But it had to be done, a part of Tony thinks. If he hadn’t done, then JARVIS would’ve alerted Steve and the others of Tony’s scheme. Then he never would’ve had the chance to step outside his Tower.
Steve falls asleep after taking another look of the last photo Tony sent, which is already saved in a secured folder comprised of photos of him and Tony, but mostly of Tony.
Their gazes lock then. Tony’s smirk softens into a smile but his whiskey eyes are heated, and Steve knows he has a similar look on his face. Slowly, he pulls one hand from his pocket and raises it to trace a bead of sweat that’s trailing down the side of Tony’s face. He sees Tony’s eyes flutter as the genius sighs quietly. Steve’s heart is hammering against his ribcage as he wets his lips, throat dry at the sheer
Sighing despondently, Tony waves a hand and the blue holograms displaying the specs for Clint’s arrowheads and Natasha’s Widow’s Bite disappear. There’s no fucking way he’ll be able to focus on his work now if he’s going to keep this up.
Tony bites his lower lip as he lands beside an upturned truck. He fires his repulsors at two approaching Chitauri before he replies to his disapproving AI.
“Accept it, babe,” the blond mutters against Tony’s cheek as he presses another kiss. “We’ve always known you’re worthy. It’s just now the rest of the world is finally aware of it, too.”
Fuck, these assholes are definitely toying with him like a prey, and that thought just pisses Tony off even more.
He’s coping, he’s adapting. He’s adjusting, and with each passing day Steve starts to feel less lost and more… well, not
. I was still here that time, Tony. I could’ve been alerted by JARVIS, but apparently you revoked that protocol, for some reason your AI can’t even tell me. Now please, Tony, please give me an honest answer. What happened and why did it take
Natasha, who at first was stoic and guarded around them at first, turns out to be quite affectionate once she’s lowered her walls around them.
“You should’ve been more careful with your words, Clint,” Steve remarks sternly, still displeased at the archer’s caustic words that only seemed to heighten the engineer’s distress.
Tony is silent. He’s secretly impressed at the insightfulness of the elderly woman, and god forbid if she were a few decades younger. SHIELD would hire her on the spot.
“I suggest house arrest,” Natasha pipes up. When they turn to stare at her with mirroring looks of shock, the redhead sighs and explains, “Imagine the Tony we just witnessed dealing with the general public. People will wonder what the hell happened to him, especially when he doesn’t make his trademark sarcastic and witty comebacks. It’s for his protection.”
retain. And regardless of the serum, you also have limitations. So. You know. I get that it can be overwhelming. Can’t imagine what it’s like for you, but yeah. I’m getting off track here so I’m just. Gonna. Stop.”
Tony bites his lower lip, and Steve sees the conflicting emotions in his dark brown eyes before the engineer eventually answers, “Will you — ? I mean, I… Steve, I — I need…”
Tony carefully makes his way to where they’re all seated — or stood, in Steve’s and Pepper’s case — in the living room.
Firstly, a pop song is playing at an unacceptable volume. Due to the super serum, Steve’s senses are heightened, causing him to wince at the thumping bass.
“My dear hammer wishes to speak to you,” he says, and Steve’s eyebrows rose high enough to reach his hairline because
“It is to normal people, but this is Tony we’re talking about. He tackles every problem with enthusiasm and passion, regardless of the danger it poses.”
Tony’s comically perplexed expression at the sight of Thor’s weapon served to break Bruce out of his shock as he laughs at the situation.
To hide his thoughts, Steve forces out a chuckle. “I see your point. Not your cup of tea — or coffee, should I say?” At Tony’s snort at the terrible joke, Steve’s laugh is more genuine, and his next words come out more sincere than he expected. “This one’s made for the movies.”
“He’s a prideful man, my George, but even he wasn’t immune to seek help. Even the strongest of people need the comforting touch and the listening ear of a loved one.”
As team leader, Steve should be more responsible; but going back to what he said earlier, they had a well of a week tracking down and destroying a HYDRA base. It's the eighth base they've successfully taken down, so this was a well-earned celebration. And damn it, they deserved this.
“Ugh. Shit. Fuck that dick-shaped bottle,” he groans as he massages his temples. “Never again, I tell you.”
Bruce exhales loudly and Steve feels an ounce of sympathy at the clearly exhausted scientist. After this, the super soldier promises himself to tell his teammate to sleep for at least ten hours.
“Should we contact the Director?” Thor asks then. The worry that’s simmering in the demigod’s eyes somehow comforts the super soldier.
Steve casts a glance at the ceiling — he’s never gonna break that habit, no matter how much Clint teases him — with a small smile before he enters the elevator, the doors closing almost at once.
“It’s fine, Clint. I forgive you,” Tony uttered with a small, sad smile as he looked at the archer. “Thanks for, uh, apologizing. Not many people have shown that much consideration for my feelings before, so. Um. Thanks.”
The archer does as he’s told, and in a split second the 85-inch TV is switched on to a random channel — some cartoon called Adventure Time — and Steve forces himself to slouch in his position. Five seconds later, he hears the elevator doors open, followed by the footsteps of Tony’s sock-clad feet padding quietly, uncertainly, towards the living area.
“Yeah, uh, it was great chatting with you, platypus. But I gotta go do number two. Heh, you know how it is.”
is already unpredictable to begin with, and he’s more so now.  I’m not saying I know the guy, but I observe people — comes with the job and all. All I’m saying is that, the way I see it, the best way to deal with
gets him all riled up and defensive, especially when it comes to the same people he’s been living with for almost two years, and who are
There’s a crease between his brows when he says, “Um, Tony. I think you’re describing a few symptoms of depression.”
In fact, he likes it so much that he’s perfectly aware he’s definitely treading on uncharted waters. And frankly, Steve doesn’t think he’s willing to step away from the feelings that’s starting to surface and blossom in regards to a certain genius-engineer.
Clint shoves away images of his teammates getting it on (he doesn't want to lose his appetite, thanks very much), and instead he diverts his attention back to his breakfast. He finishes pouring milk in the bowl and takes a few bites before he speaks up.
It’s been over a year since the Chitauri invasion, and Steve finds himself adjusting well into the 21st century. Of course, it’s all thanks to his teammates — the Avengers.
Tilting his head in curiosity, Tony now takes note of the slight humming he feels in the hand that’s still firmly clutched around the handle of the weapon. Momentarily forgetting about his caffeine fix, Tony’s lips quirk into a bittersweet smile as he eyes Mjölnir.
“That is one way of describing me looking after you, sir. It is, after all, my sole duty, to protect my creator.”
There’s a hint of sarcasm in his tone this time, and Natasha just blinks at the engineer while Bruce and Steve exchange a look. The super soldier can’t help but frown because although it’s his trademark trait, Tony’s manner of speaking still sounds so
Natasha blinks in shock. She wasn’t expecting that, either. It takes her a few moments to gather her thoughts before she eventually says in the gentlest tone she can muster considering the state she’s currently in. “Tony, don’t. It’s not your fault, so don’t blame yourself. I know I don’t. Besides, with our line of work something like this was bound to happen.”
Tony hasn’t told the others yet, even Steve who’s comforted him that night he made Tony hot cocoa. He knows the super soldier wants to ask Tony about that, and he doesn’t doubt that Steve’s told the others as well. Sheesh, it’s obvious that he has because the rest of his teammates recently had the tendency to hover around Tony. Not that Tony doesn’t appreciate the gesture — he does, especially that they’ve taken to keeping him company every time he’s in the common area. And honestly, Tony’s touched that they’re going out of their way to befriending him. But he can’t help but be saddened by the fact that it had to take Tony being hit with an alien weapon for them to treat him with kindness and respect. To treat him like he
Tony sighed. He could remember how hard he studied, how much work he put into his projects, his heart and soul, and how carelessly Howard brushed it all aside, how angry he became when Tony interrupted...
“You'll be all right, sir,” said Compassion. Always proper, like a butler in a large mansion, or a kind man who gave little street urchins, him and 'Tasha, sweets, before he disapppered forever. “Just take a few deep breaths.”
The creatures stopped, shaking, as if unsure of who to listen, and Kairi, with a wave of her hand, created a wall of flames.
Of course, nobody wanted to call Captain America a freak, oh no. Pumped full of some serum, able to now do things no normal person could...
Several hours later, Steve heard the swish of the door opening, and giggles. He barely cracked his eyes open, arms still wrapped around Tony. Quietly, the three little girls and Natasha climbed onto the bed, pulling large blankets on top, and cuddling on the end of the bed. Tony murmured when the girls giggled again, but only snuggled closer.
Tony held onto Pepper as the ground rumbled, and the glass shattered. He wished, for just a moment, that he could turn back time, take a few seconds to breath, and apologize to Steve for being stubborn.
“Thank you, Dagna. Tony, Leliana wants to talk to us, so I want you to eat, and then we're going to the War Room in a half hour.”
“Kids,” said Tony, “This is Ramuh. Ramuh, these are my sorta nieces, not-adopted-yet-but-still-sorta my kids, Kairi, Namine, and Xion.”
“They very deliberately burned the people and village. There's trees right there. Someone made sure just the village was destroyed, not everything around it.”
“Simple. You continue to fight me, which I don't mind one bit, and I kill Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes, or you fall off the building, and  your teammates are free. Simple, you see? After all they did, it wouldn't be hard now, would it?”
“A door,” he repeated. Light filtered from the entrance to the cave, and Phoenix flared her tails. At the other corner of the cave was indeed a door. It seemed almost drawn on to the rock, and yet...
“It's like trying to fix onto a station,” Wanda explained. “To find the right signal, but it keeps changing.”
“You died. You didn't even hesitate for a moment, did you? You always put your life on the line for us, for me...you....”
“Oh,” said Steve, warmth spreading through his entire body. He never noticed what Tony's eyes said, before, but sitting so close...
“I heard parts of your rather...unfortunate conversation,” said Vivienne, sitting down as graceful as a cat.
“You guys planned this behind our back?” Tony said, giving them a glare, even as he began hacking into the system.
“Tony, did you try to kill yourself?” asked Steve, his throat tightening up. He wasn't supposed to cry, damnit!
“Oh! It's you!” she said, and her eyes seemed to sparkle more. “I heard you had a bunch on you from a fight or something, and I was so hoping I could see it. Can I see it, please? I promise I won't touch.”
Thoughts of projects, of his boots and gauntlets, armor and weapons for the team, that arm for James, that jackass who still needed to apologize, fled as warm lips pressed, gently, against his own.
The arguments, the pain of rejection from not just a truly good person, but of his childhood hero, Captain America.
“Now now,” said one of them, a short-haired blonde man said, leathers dyed purple and black. “I promise we don't bite.”
“No no no no,” yelled Tony as they plunged into the water. Very cold water. Forcing the panic away. he swam to the surface. Steve shook his head as he surfaced as well, both of them taking a few deep breaths.
“I don't like it, Tony. I don't like training children for war, but these kids didn't get a say, and Spiderman's thrown himself in the middle. I'd rather see them safe with us, than out there fighting alone.”
“I didn't think anything would sway you, Captain. But I would like to keep informed of matters. If things get out of hand...”
“It would not be the first time we have been betrayed,” said Ramuh, “and we expect it will happen again. Power can always lead to great good and to great evil, and that is why this world will always need their heroes.”
“I would like to discuss matters further with you,” said Vivienne. “Perhaps we may debate some of the issues at hand. Also, since you are now part of the Inquisition, I wish to recommend a few tailors. Your clothes, though practical, are atrocious.”
“You're wrong,” said Bucky. “I know for a fact you saved at least one little girl, if not other bystanders. She told me, said that the 'pretty person with the pretty eyes' saved her.”
He took two steps before he found himself against the wall. This time, he moaned, and he felt the shiver coarse through Steve's body.
And then right when he seemed to be getting through to all of them, their Civil War...so many people to  fail...
It truly fascinated him, how emotional his Nobodies could appear. Memories, perhaps? He couldn't study this further without someone like Namine...
I almost left it with despair, and then my buddy glared at me and demanded a bit of cuddles. So there's fluff. Because I do like my angst...
“It's odd, though, right?” he said, doodling imaginary drawings on the table with his fingers to keep occupied. “They gave me the brand, so I should hate the idea. I did hate it. Hated them so much when they took me away from 'Tasha...my sister.”
“I find it a place that soothes me, though for others, not as much. The Inquisitor prefers to walk around, rather than sit.”
Dagna continued to ramble as Tony reconsidered his idea. He could just focus on his other ideas. The nice, ice daggers and projectiles he planned to give his sister, the exploding arrow ideas he thought of while talking to Sera...
He studied the glass shard in his hand, contemplating how the light shown, like tiny rainbows in clear ice, so cold...
“You wanted to see me,” said Tony, when neither Natasha or Bruce said a word. “About the runes on my chest.”
In normal circumstances, Steve managed to keep a level head. Perhaps because he couldn't do much, perhaps because he regretted so much, he found his anger level rising faster than normal. He took a breath, pushing it away.
The pain never left him, even in this vision or dream. It surged through him, so each touch, each move, felt like tiny pinpricks.
Steve's hands slipped under the pants to cup his ass, and then pulled them down, fingers teasing as the clothes from his lower half slide down and off.
Tony wished he could spend several good hours, taking the computers apart, studying them and collecting data. He could feel the magic laced in it, along with the electronics.
“He's missing,” said Clint, not actually saying the 'again,' but definitely thinking it, as they all were. The ice that remained between them after the War had melted, still leaving a frost. But they were all trying, at different degrees.
“Of course. Since it's not bad enough that there's a multi-world war, that you were, in fact, kidnapped, changed by Nobodies, that your world is being breached by Heartless and Nobodies...a few of you have the potential to be Keybladers.
“How dare you!” snapped another Mage by the names of James, one of his arms missing. “After everything you went through, with that mark on your head, you really think Mages should just be thrown back into those prisons? What are you, a monster?”
“We don't have a lot of time,” whispered Axel, looking around the corner. “We can be stealthy all we want, but they'll sense us eventually.”
“It's not like I can do much,” he replied, bitterly. “Pump me full of serum, and look, the perfect fighter, who can't even protect his teammates because hey, look, there's magic involved. Fuck magic.”
The idea, or so she understood, was to fix the physical damage. Perhaps Vexen thought Namine rewrote his memories, and therefore wanted to make him an even more powerful fighter.
“Bruce is in the kitchen, cooking up a storm,” said Pepper, pulling a chair up close so that she could take Tony's hand. The girls sat beside them on the couch, Xion nearly on top, the other two girls at his side. Namine held onto Tony's ankle.
“Now, you need a name,” said Fury, giving Tony a blank look. “We can't just call you 'The Inquisition's special squad.'”
Tony didn't know if that actually translated into a yes, but it left him more at ease to know the other esper would remain to watch over his friends.
Tony grinned as he raced off, weaving through the alleys. It took longer to get the notification when Steve took Bucky down. Hopefully they hadn't destroyed anything much in the process.
Or perhaps that was the power of her glare, something that she couldn't really perform properly with her eyes blurred with tears.
“I'm usually that person, but after seeing... I'm okay just sitting for now. So, you are part of the Inquisiton.”
“About time,” said Hawkeye, and Natasha felt comfortable enough to pinch him. She gave the smallest of smiles when he yelped. Steven sighed.
“We're hiding in the vents,” said Clint, pointing at himself, and despite the tears in their eyes, the girls giggled a bit.
Tony held his hand out, and Aqua handed it carefully to him. It surprised him that the blade felt fairly light, but he supposed magic blades could vary. He sucked on his finger when he decided to check the edge, and received a glare from Steve.
“So now that we are all present, we may begin,” said Rook, smiling. “I believe most of you know each other.”
“Do you...you want to go back?” Tony asked, softly. “I'm not really...really related, though...but...”
“Of course,” said Pepper, to everyone's surprise. “Just like people can learn your magic, and turn against you.”
Steve made a move to touch him, but stopped himself. He didn't know what Tony wanted. He was almost terrified of Namine's powers.
“Sorry to wake you up, Boss,” said FRIDAY. “But Thor and a visitor are currently waiting in the dining area.”
Axel raised his hands in front of him, but still grinned. “C'mon, Aqua. It's what I've always done, sneaking around. Anyway, give them a break, yeah? Didn't they just get engaged, or something?”
A young girl, red hair swaying as she ran. She stopped before them, her blue eyes widened as she noticed the weapons pointed at her, but she leaned down anyway, taking gasping breaths.
Of course they were. A reawakened mage having a nightmare could reign havoc without awareness. With a sigh, he pushed himself up.
Steve got on one knee, so he could look her in the eyes. “Hey, who are you? Did you...do you know where Tony is?”
He stood for what felt like hours but was really minutes, senses extended to their maximum. It was quiet again, and that was unnerving. Slowly, as if reawakening, the ground rumbled again. And this time it kept rumbling. Finally, it petered out with a series of rumbles. It sounded very much like laughter. Steve shuddered despite himself. He looked down at Tony’s boot print one more time to bolster himself, and headed toward the source of the noise.
Tony shuddered. He quickly glanced at the horizon, but the world still seemed okay. “First time for everything, I guess?” He snatched another quick glance out the window. “Maybe my bed will give me better results.”
Steve tugged him up and guided him a safe distance from the tree. “It’s quiet.” He observed. “What happens now?”
Steve settled into parade rest and looked him in the eyes. “It’s already been discussed with Fury. I’m staying here with you until you’re done.”
“Very well, Sir.” The lights and sounds of an active workshop fade until it’s dark and quiet, with only the light near the elevator illuminating the space. “Are you feeling alright?” Tony picks out the concern in JARVIS’ voice.
The entire morning, Tony felt off-kilter and cotton-brained. Neither being electrocuted multiple times in Dr. Pym’s lab nor the coffee he had in the morning did much to improve his energy levels.
He dodged another violent tree root and vaulted over crumbling rocks. A leap over an untangling knot of wood, a roll away from a heavily deposited stone, and a quick dash later, Steve was within arm’s reach of the twisted tree trunk and brought his shield down hard.
Tony raised the faceplate so he could bare his teeth in that obnoxious grin Steve didn’t like. “Aren’t you the one who said I don’t follow orders? Besides, it’s for science!” He rolled his eyes again when Steve just kept looking at him. “You’re not changing my mind. See you later.”
Tony shuddered. “I got a glimpse when it was using me as fertilizer. It’s all a bit jumbled, but what I got was that it’s not from around here.” He shuddered again and gagged. “You’re running out of time. Set it on fire, now!”
He watched in awe as Steve’s face transitioned from righteous to constipated. “Wow. I can’t believe it. Captain America loitering about like a creeper. You learn something new every day.”
Tony was close. He could feel it. He couldn’t let down his guard now, especially when he was so close. But as he looked out into the fog, the rocky ground gave him no more clues. The boot print and the lighter were the last signs Steve had within his sight.
The sensors didn’t detect anything out of the ordinary. It was as if there was no mysterious purple fog at all. All readings were normal.
The shield broke his fall, but even then the impact was not particularly hard. Steve crouched at the ready in the dark. The space he had fallen into was not large. In fact, the hole he fell through was only a few feet above his head if he stood at full height. He’d be able to pull himself up and out if he were to jump. While it was lacking in height, the space made up for it in width and depth. The darkness stretched a good many feet in all directions. He breathed in air that was stale and dank. The ground under his boots was a mix of damp earth, rock, and old roots. The space was roughly bowl-shaped, deepest at the middle with the ceiling and ground sloping towards each other at the edges.
Tony kissed her cheek. “I’m back to my old self now. You don’t have to worry anymore. You know I’m stronger than that, Jan. After all, I’m Iron Man.” He waggled his eyebrows and smirked.
Tony’s breath rattled in his chest. “I saw something. I thought I saw something.” He shuddered. “But I didn’t get a good look. And it’s gone now.”
Behind them, the inferno had calmed to a steady burning with the occasional snap and crackle of burning timber.
Tony tumbled into bed and burrowed beneath the covers. Exhaustion seeped into every part of his body. Putting the report together and sending it off to Fury should’ve been a simple task, but he had difficulty concentrating and kept glancing out the window. The trip into the Timefog was something he vowed to never repeat again, unless the safety of the world depended on it. Tony was man enough to admit that the experience was terrifying.
Steve brightened so much he resembled a lightbulb. “Great!” He cleared his throat and frowned. “Great. How about 7 PM? Does that work for you? We could get dinner before or after if you want?”
Parts of the Timefog were denser than others, resulting in highly variable visibility. It could be relatively clear in one area, but advance several feet more and suddenly visibility would drop to zero. Patchy clouds of fog drifted, obscuring their surroundings before lazily passing by. There was no air movement. Even sound seemed to be muffled. Everything was stifled in a still, perpetual twilight.
Tony groaned as he rolled out of bed. After the nightmarish sleepwalking incident, he’d gone to his bedroom to try to catch some more sleep. The few hours he’d managed didn’t seem to help at all. Exhaustion felt like a part of him. Tony stood up and wobbled on his feet. He stumbled into the bathroom and looked in the mirror.
Which brought up another thing. If Steve found Tony so irritating, why did he keep trying to be buddy-buddy with him? Maybe he decided to change tactics and thought this would somehow make Tony more motivated to be a better person. Sucks to be him, because Tony wasn’t going to miraculously become a better person just because Captain America wanted to be friends. If Steve knew Tony had a crush on him for basically his entire life, he’d probably try to get away as quickly as possible.
He shuddered and pulled his covers up past his ears. Clearly, he needed to stop thinking and start sleeping. He wiggled into a more comfortable position and closed his eyes with purpose.
Tony tore his gaze from the treeline. “I’m fine. I just need to go home.” His gaze flitted to Steve’s concerned face then somewhere to the side. “Don’t worry your hyper-stylized self about it.”
The holograms around him flickered, then died out. Tony rubbed at his eyes and groaned. “JARVIS! What did I just say?” He picked the closest camera to him and glared at it. There was no answer. The lights flickered again, then turned off completely, plunging the lab into darkness. The only source of light was Tony’s arc reactor, casting a faint blue-white glow that illuminated the desk.
Tony stared wide eyed at the other man and suppressed the urge to cling to him. “Steve?” He whipped his head around. There was nothing in the fog. No ominous shapes, no creepy sensations. He looked back at Steve to make sure he was real. The other man looked at him in concern.
“She's not one to trifle with,” said Steve. “I'm glad she's on our side, or I'd fear for most of the troops.”
“It's a colossal pain,” said Aqua, smiling. “I mean, if you're not raised to fight this, and then you're getting told that there's a multi-world threat, that's basically trying to steal the lights of the world...it doesn't go over very well.”
Maybe because he grew stronger, or maybe because of what had happened, Tony fought in earnest, trying to get away, panic clearly in his widened eyes.
“It's not much,” said Steve, reaching around his neck to pull out his dog tags. Carefully, he removed a ring from the chain, even as Tony watched, eyes wide.
They both raced. Though the idea of getting caught by Steve enticed him, he knew that the goal really was to stay away as long as possible.
“No,” said Tony, slowly. “I can feel...this well you're talking about, but if I try to...grab it, it slips through.”
Adaar, renamed Bruce to Natasha, laughed. “Don't worry. I know I look like a brawler. And I do brawl if I have to. Sometimes it's just better that way. But yes, I'm a mage, too.”
Tony turned, and threw the glass hard enough to make sure it shattered against the wall. Slowly, as if he approached a large tiger, he approached the mess he made, and knelt.
“You're seriously not proposing to me, are you?” Tony yelled, tugging at his arm, knowing it was completely ineffective.
For some reason, my brain decided that Thor as Justice, Loki as Fear, and Jarvis as Compassion makes some sort of sense.
The woman was young, as far as Steve could tell. She wore simple jeans and a t-shirt, simple sandals, her blue hair cut short and framing her face, and she smiled easily. She carried a large box of bagels and cream cheese.
Tony seemed a bit uneasy as well, but whether that was because of the mark on his forehead, or because of the runes he revealed, that remained to be seen.
Tony shifted, moving to hide his face against Steve's chest. The three girls peeked around him. Xion held her sword up, glaring at Rhodey.
The world seemed to twist around them, before settling. As if they inhabited a different pocket of reality, people only now began to stop and stare...
“My name is Solas. I apologize for entering your dream. I was merely walking the Fade when I felt your pain.”
Steve sighed, and rubbed his temples. So this definitely had to do with magic, as Wanda said. And that meant Steve might as well just trudge along, because there was nothing he could do to help.
“You flirt a lot with me,” came the interruption, “but I don't know if you mean it, or it's just a defense mechanism.”
“Bruce,” said Leliana, not missing a beat. “I know that you hesitate to fight, but they could at least use a good healer.”
“I don't know what it is, but that's not water. It's something magical. If you go in there, I don't know what will happen.”
Carefully, slowly, Aqua raised her hand. With a shimmer, a sword appeared in her hand. It held a diamond motif, the blues of the blade crisscrossing to create the shapes in the middle, as it made it's way down. The hilt was simple, but the guard seemed almost like the cascade of a waterfall. He could see the keychain itself, like a drop of water.
So he was a bit surprised when he was practically attacked by two redheads, one glaring at him, the other practically in tears.
Silently, Tony followed. He considered asking questions, but figured that it would be futile. Clearly, Steve wanted to tell him something, but wished for a more private venue.
Again, he was silenced with a kiss. This time, Steve didn't let him pull away, flooded his mind with warmth that spread throughout his whole body, a peace that relaxed the tension, and calmness that stopped his racing thoughts.
Steve put a hand over his mouth. “You and I are a team now, whether you like it or not. This bond we have between us isn't going to just disappear when you leave. I'm sure about it.”
He rubbed Tony's back when the genius woke, sometimes silent, sometimes shaking just a bit with quiet tears. Steve felt the overwhelming pain, choking him, and filling his eyes with liquid grief. He pulled Tony closer, hold him tighter, and slowly, the sorrow shifted to warmth and love. This bond they shared was just another aspect of their lives they eventually would have to figure out. But not now...
Steve turned, the feeling of Tony muted here, but he still felt it, and pointed. Quietly, they moved.
Tony took a step back, his eyes widening and mouth opening. He looked at the others, but they appeared perplexed or angry. Steven's eyes narrowed, his lips tight, hands clenched.
In Steve's mind, the place should have been dark and gloomy, but it wasn't. Though the marble building was light, it felt cold, like ice.
“Yeah. You seem like me,” said Axel. “Fire is part of your element, if I'm any judge. And she's a good sort, needs a good home...”
“I don't even know who I am anymore,” said Tony, not turning. “Though Namine didn't erase my memories, she shared so much, showed me what could have been. In one world, you and I almost killed each other over Bucky, because when I found out he killed my parents, I went after him. We broke the Avengers. Because we couldn't talk.”
The elf hesitated. “Yes, I will tell you, but not here. I think what you really need is time to heal. Close your eyes.”
Natasha and Tony looked at each other. Both of them were thinking that it sounded like bullshit, that the Iron Bull didn't just want to say hello. On the other hand, they made no show of hiding their presense, either. That put Natasha only mildly at ease, even as they were introduced to the group. They introduced themselves.
He and Steve, shockingly, didn't agree on something else in the ongoing revision of the Accords, and decided that having another sparing match would be good. Nobody really mentioned that the two of them coming to blows head on and full armor may not be the best idea given their track record.
“This is worrisome,” said Thor, at the end of the story. “It makes me wonder how it is so easy for them to travel between worlds.”
With a wry smile, Steve shook his head. "I still want to know you. To understand everything that happened to you. Maybe...eventually..."
He let Steve lean down towards him before using as much force as possible to push him aside with his foot. At the same time, he rolled away, getting on his feet. Steve nodded, once, to show approval.
“To make you better,” he said. He had a family in this world, and even there, Howard somehow managed to screw things up....
It took an hour, and they let the girls continue to sleep. Even then, they all stayed in their pajamas.
Inside a giant, glass containment system, she stared at him, her delicate hands pressed against the glass. Her hair floated around her, twirled long, far longer than he remembered it being, and she glowed a faint blue, her skin, shades of blues, greens, and grays. Tears filled her eyes...
Tony kept trying to call up this mysterious keyblade that supposedly he had the potential to call, but the more he stared at his empty hand, the more irritated he became. How was he supposed to protect anyone if this thing didn't show up?
Some of his happiest memories were of the Avengers and Steve, his small family. Alone, he talked of them freely.
No words, just the insane laugh of the woman, as she threw lightening at Tony, who tried to deflect, who tried to hurt this Howard...
As his foot touched the grass, a voice called, “Anthony.” A command, and he stopped, before slowly turned.
What of Rhodey, who had witnessed him drunk many times, who watched him nearly destroy himself over and over and saved him?
“Nope,” replied Steve. “You rely on the suit, and I know you sometimes...avoid practice. I thought you might like a bit of a game instead.”
“You can't pick the family you're born into, but you can decide who you want to call your family,” added Kairi.
Strange sat back, a bit surprised at Tony's vehemence. “You realize that just like any of you can learn this magic, so can someone else, someone who will use it against you.”
“Passage of darkness between worlds, filled with all sorts of shit. If you don't know how to get between the worlds, it can get rather nasty, and it's easy to get lost in. Basically, if you don't have a map, you're basically screwed. You know that place you were being held beforehand, Tony? Castle Oblivion is in the Rift.”
Easily, like lifting a cup, Steve pulled him up as he leaned forward, devouring his mouth in a kiss, and Tony wrapped his legs around the muscled torso so that the Captain could undo his own pants. He thought he heard a cap pop open, but found himself distracted by the lovely neck he bit in retaliation for everything.
If they managed to survive, if they managed to one day put their differences aside, they really needed to work on fighting against magic users.
They looked at each other, dark brown meeting sky blue, and Tony's fingers gently made a path from Steve's wrist, up his arm. He felt the smallest of shivers move through the Captain as his hand moved behind his neck. He could feel the thrum of lyrium there, as well.
The three of them entered together, then just stopped, because really, the view...Natasha could only thing 'breathtaking.'
They both stopped for a moment, just to try and understand what monstrosity lay before them. It looked, almost, like their home, the Avengers tower, but wrapped around and inside, lay monsters, part of the building, some grotesque, some beautiful, like angels. At the very top, wrapped in darkness...
For several seconds, no body spoke, and then, quietly, hesitantly, Kairi began the story, of how Howard took them in, how he changed after their Tony died, how Vexen and others tainted his mind...
“The Inquisition has grown larger over time as deeds of Herald has spread, and so have requests for help. We try our best to respond to as many as possible, but it is impossible for Rook to handle everything, and therefore we will often send out others to solve issues he need not handle. We try to fit the requests to our specialties as best as possible, but it is not always so simple.”
“You can ignore it if you want, but it isn't going to disappear. You've already attracted the Nobodies, so it's only a matter of time.”
“What the fuck, Steve?” Tony jumped out of the chair, but, as usual, Steve moved faster, grabbing him before he could run.
And just a gentle shove, like the ghost of a touch, and he fell. He didn't scream, even as the water enveloped him, and all turned dark.
This madman, whatever his name was, had easily wrapped them in magic, and though Wanda definitely  seemed to try and counteract the spells, he had the upper hand.
“The point,” said Aqua, “Is that we need to find the keyhole to this world and seal it, so Heartless cannot flood this world.”
Aqua sat down. “I'm fully aware of your view on yourself, Mr. Stark. I know your history. You made mistakes, just like anyone else, and punished yourself harder than most. You consistently strive to make things better after all that was done, flinging yourself into danger so others don't get hurt. You may not be perfect, Mr. Stark, but your heart is a beacon of bright light.”
“Please do close your mouth before a fly decides to find a new home. I promise that I don't bite innocent young boys such as yourself.”
Axel lifted his arm before he could dismiss the blade, showing an area near the hilt. “You can slide a summon stone here. Coincidently, did you notice your keychain?”
“What the fuck is wrong with you fucking people? No, really? Who the fuck decided that was a good idea?”
“Overwhelming?” replied the elf. The landscape changed, the buildings disappearing, the bodies gone. They were now near a lake with a few weeping willows and trees nearby. The softest of breezes caressed the leaves and grass, and the full moon reflected on the water. Justice stood nearby, hammer in hand, but overall, appeared relaxed. Compassion looked into the water.
The Heartless uncrossed his arm, the hint of a smirk on his face. “All Nobodies pick names with an x,” came the reply, a deeper bass unlike Steve. “Usually they become creative, altering their own names. Edax didn't want to be that obvious, didn't want any association with your good Captain.”
I love you, Steve wants to say, but doesn't know if that would make things easier or harder for Tony, so instead he winds his arms around his neck and kisses him until Bucky knocks on the door.
"And don't," Tony says right over him, shaking his head, something ugly coming into his expression. "Don't let me stay just because sometimes in among all the babble I can talk pretty. Don't think you have any kind of obligation to me just because I think you have a spectacular ass, okay? You don't owe me anything, Steve, and I couldn't bear it if -"
"Okay," Tony says, still chuckling. "Fair answer. And hey, it takes care of my next question, too, so points for brevity."
"C'mon, then," Tony says, taking his hand and tugging him down. He doesn't kiss Steve again, but he does put an arm around his shoulder and tug him close. "Is this okay?"
Steve whirls. He's still holding Tony's hand, and Bucky's there, right there, standing in the open doorway with a rucksack over his shoulder, looking at Steve all tentative and hopeful, and yes, yes, this is it, this is everything Steve ever wanted in one room.
Tony's still staring at him. "You said 'when you'd finally slept with someone.' That is exactly what you said. Did you mean - did you mean -"
"No!" Steve says immediately, not letting that thought get any further in Tony's head. "Oh Jesus no. No, no, nothing like that."
"Really," says Steve. The part of him that's not watching Tony is wondering if he's suddenly going to get a rundown of Tony's job and car and The Stats (as Sam and Nat and Steve's other friends who get hit on call them) for why he'd be a Good Catch.
"I just don't want you to think," Steve sighs. "I care about you so much, Tony, and I just don't want to give you reason to doubt that."
attractive. He's facing the barkeep, too, and his hand is resting on the bar close enough that it's brushing Steve's.
"What, no," Tony says before Steve can, which is a relief until he continues, "*I* should leave YOU guys to it, so I'll see you tomorrow -"
Their second date they go back to the same cafe, then for a walk through the city. Tony's every bit as charming and engaging as he was before, but there's something just a little different about him this time. Steve thinks he's starting to relax a little more; that he's not trying so hard. He starts talking about a few of the engineering projects he has going on, and Steve doesn't understand a good forty percent of it, but Tony's so animated, his shirtsleeves rolled up and his hands waving energetically, occasionally running through his hair and making it stand up wildly, and Steve likes this even better than the studious flirting.
"Stop, oh my God, just stop," Steve says, putting his hand over Tony's mouth. Tony doesn't duck away but he does look at him for the first time since they sat down, and seeing the liquid concern in Tony's dark eyes makes everything in Steve go soft and his breath come easier. "Please don't apologize for that."
Steve doesn't want to. He runs through every excuse he can muster, from I don't know what he's doing right now, he could be busy, his phone might not even be on, and finally Bucky says, "Steve, if he's not the type who'd come back for you, you shouldn't let him come back at all."
Steve laughs and pulls Tony in by the waist, but at the last second doesn't kiss him. Doesn't know if that'd be weird, with Bucky maybe wanting to kiss one or both of them and maybe not. Really doesn't want Bucky to feel left out, either. So he turns it into a hug instead, dropping his face to Tony's shoulder and muffling his smile in his shirt.
They're outside Steve's apartment, tucked away in a dark corner of the little brick alcove, safe from prying eyes and pouring rain. Steve is pressed against the wall with his arms around Tony's neck and his hands roaming over his solid shoulders and tangling in his wild, dripping hair. And Tony - Tony's pressed all down his front, the solid warmth of him so different from the scratchy cold hardness of the brick digging into his shoulders. Tony's got his arms around Steve's waist, and seems to be doing everything he can think of to get just
say, like Hammer, that ass) Steve is, in fact, tall enough to see over the counter. He's just not big enough to catch the barkeep's eye quickly. Nor is he big enough to maneuver through the crowd quickly on his way up, and half the time he ends up getting jostled so much on his way back one or more of the drinks will spill. It's not that people are cruel to him, exactly, it's that they just - don't notice him.
Twenty minutes later there's a knock on the door. Filled with apprehension, Steve holds a finger up to Bucky, then goes to answer it. He opens the door, and there's Tony.
Tony blinks at him, then blinks again. He looks so startled it breaks Steve's heart. Not just for how badly he himself failed Tony, but for how badly Tony must be used to being treated.
"No, no, that's not it at all," Steve says. "It's just - I mean, I wanted you to stay. I did. But - Bucky doesn't get much time on Skype, you know? And tonight he had a huge chunk of time, so we've been planning this for ages."
Steve freezes. Tony and Bucky don't say anything else. After a minute Tony calls, "Steve? Do we really need another chair?"
"No," Steve snaps, angry now and seeing it all happening in front of him again. "I accidentally walked past your table and I fucking HEARD YOU, Tony, you and your friends all laughing at me -"
What even CAN he say? 'I know you guys get hit on so much you complain about it, but guess what, it just happened to me, and I'm so fucking happy I can't stop smiling?' Probably no. 'I know all the people who mack on you guys in bars are creeps and assholes, but seriously, the person who just did it to me is
"I don't have a girlfriend." Steve looks down at the three drinks, then back up at Tony. "And I don't have a boyfriend, either."
"I'll, um, I'll get you a chair," Steve says awkwardly, completely unsure what to do with himself. Tony doesn't object to Steve leaving the room.
"Here," Tony says, handing his phone to Steve. He shoves it too far and Steve fumbles for it and it almost drops, but somehow between the two of them Steve manages to get a grip on it. It's already open to a new contact, and Steve's hands are shaking so bad it takes two tries to get his own damn number in right, but eventually he manages.
It flips: if the three of them were in a polyamorous relationship then that means that more than just Steve and Bucky dating and Steve and Tony dating, Tony and Bucky would be dating too, and Steve knows from very personal experience how extremely protective Bucky is of the people he cares about. Bucky would tell Tony to stand up for himself and demand what he needs, too.
"No," Steve says, then scrunches his nose, because he is sure that Bucky doesn't have it right but he can't put his finger on why.
Steve hadn't understood. It was like not realizing he was thirsty until he took a drink of water. Nothing else in the world exists except Tony.
Steve's laughing, too happy with the thought of Tony and the reality of Bucky to do anything else. "I'm joking, Buck, jeez. Of
Steve knows what Tony's trying to say, but he's still too incredulous. "You mean you were a freshman in high school -?"
Words remain beyond Steve's abilities, and Tony remains gleefully talkative about all the shenanigans the three of them could get up to. He's joking but not, doing it to make Steve blush but sincere, and Steve doesn't know how to make him stop without protesting too much. Finally, finally,
And Steve finally gets enough breath to choke, and Tony pats him on the back and apologizes, and Steve thumps his own chest and waves him off, but then Tony just
"Or been treated well in turn," Steve says quietly. Tony's never said anything outright, but Steve's not stupid.
At last, Steve settles into his chair and mock-glares. It's supposed to be a mock-glare, anyway. But judging by the slight shift of Bucky's head, it may come off a bit more sincere than he means it. "Because it is pouring rain outside, that's why."
That is not the case with Bucky. Because with Bucky the big question isn't whether or not he'd like to date Tony - yes or no, either way won't upset the balance of the universe. No, with Bucky the big question is whether or not he'd like to date STEVE. Steve, whom he's been friends with since they were tiny. Steve, whom he's never shown any inclination towards. Steve, so scrawny and bland that most people don't even notice him. That Steve.
"Because you don't trust me." Steve starts to protest (more out of reflexive politeness than honesty, really), and Tony holds up a hand. "You don't. You shouldn't. Thinking back, I can definitely hear what it must have sounded like to you. But I really, really need you to believe me, so I've got to do something to prove to you that it was
what it seemed, and that I do genuinely like you. And the only way to do that is to give you control and let you do something that I could not
"Made you?" Tony says, willfully missing the point. "I seem to remember both of you being on board the moment you found out it was a comedy starring Cate Blanchett."
He's barely got time to clean up and throw on some sweat pants before his computer chimes with an incoming Skype call. He snags an afghan off his bed (the cream-colored one Bucky got him from Barnes & Nobel for Christmas three years ago, because that is
being comfortable with the idea - at least he is until dinner actually happens. Steve's so caught up in imagining the three of them together he quickly loses track of the conversation, and the words don't make it quite into his brain but what happens is Bucky says something kind and protective to Tony, and Tony just stares at his plate and blinks and his cheeks turn just the tiniest bit dusky and Steve is so overwhelmed with how much he
"Because!" Steve says, throwing his hands up. "I just told you! I'm not a child and I'm not made of glass! Just because I'm short and I've got asthma -"
"You didn't tell him that either, did you," Bucky says, calm and matter-of-fact. "He has no idea you'd never slept with anyone before."
"I know what 'signif' means," says Steve, still too confused to be polite. "I'm just wondering why you care."
"There," Steve says, holding his phone out so maybe the camera can pick up the text. "I hope you're happy."
how I wanted this to happen," Steve says, rubbing a hand over his face. Then he decides to just buck up and take it, so he snags Tony's hand and drags him over to his desk.
Tony brings his free hand around in front of them and opens it, and somehow through all that he managed to keep a hold of what Steve had put in his hands.
They end up sitting on a bench in the park watching people go by, like every rom-com ever set in New York. Steve's surprisingly okay with it. When Tony finishes his coffee Steve snatches it and goes to throw it away before Tony can react. He's walking back to their bench when he spots something on the ground and gets an idea.
He leans down and kisses Steve's cheek, gives him a pointed look as he puts his hands in his pockets and pushes his jacket down, then walks away into the rain. Steve just watches him go.
Tony looks down at the contact and says, "Okay, fair warning, he might not say anything, and I might get my ass kicked for this, but for you, darlin', anything."
It's gratifying because Tony's reaction is much the same, drawing back and his shoulders hunching. His face shuttering. "What? Why?"
the one who brought up the idea in the first place. Though didn't say so explicitly, he's implied pretty heavily that he's been involved in polyamorous relationships before and would be open to being in one again.
leading him on, Tony really does genuinely LIKE him, and in light of that Steve's treated him pretty badly. Unintentionally, but these last few days have probably been as awful for him as they were for Steve. "I'll do it right now. And I'll, um. I'll - I'll text
Steve starts to pull away, citing the fact that this song is anything but slow, and then a new song starts playing.
Steve stares at him, at the depth of emotion pooling in Tony's wild, dark eyes, and forgets everything about himself long enough to pull Tony down to keep kissing him.
"Well we do!" Steve says defensively, and it seems to be Tony's reaction that's finally knocked Bucky back into the present. That, or clued him in that Steve meant it and this wasn't some kind of weird joke.
The next day after work they go out for coffee, because Steve figures it's best to keep it simple. They meet in the lobby and walk together, and the whole way Steve can't help but sneak glances up at Tony, like he's still not quite sure this is real. Most of the time he ends up catching Tony's eye because he's already looking at Steve, and then they both look away quickly but it's fun anyway.
"Well," Steve starts, but Tony shoots him a quelling glance, and for once in his life Steve listens.
"Look," Tony says, clearly trying not to laugh at Steve's shock. "I did say we email. And no, I'm not going to tell you anything we talk about, any more than I would give Bucky all the details of
At first he wants to write an email, because this is going to be a looong story, but. He also wants to tell Bucky in person. Or as close to 'in person' as they can get, anyway. (He also doesn't save things to tell Bucky when (
It tapers off after a moment and they just breathe. Then Tony huffs a laugh against his lips and says, "Now
"Okay," Steve says. He realizes he's smiling. It makes his face ache, but pleasantly; like putting down something heavy he hadn't realized he was carrying.
Tony smiles at him - and this one, of all the myriad smiles Steve's seen on Tony's face so far, this one is by far his favorite.
After a moment of looking at him expectantly, the guy shrugs and sips his own drink. "Worth a shot," he says.
"It's not a rock," Steve says seriously. Tony looks at him incredulously, and with all the solemnity he can muster Steve says, "That, Mister Stark, is what we down in Brooklyn call a
After the movie they're all quiet and subdued, though Steve thinks it has less to do with the hour - probably less to do with their pending relationship change, honestly - than with the movie itself. They part ways, and Steve still doesn't kiss Tony, and Bucky doesn't kiss one or both of them either. When Bucky's leaving Steve goes in for a one-armed bro-hug like always, then thinks the better of it. What if Bucky's uncomfortable? What if he doesn't want Steve, and now that he knows Steve wants him he doesn't want Steve's greedy hands on him?
Steve can't bring himself to look at him, but they're close enough that he can feel the movement of it when Tony shrugs. "I want to be with you," Tony says simply. "Even if you can't or don't want to open up to me all the way, just - let me know where you are so I can be with you, all right?"
"Yep, yep, I see what you're saying, Barnes," Tony nods, plopping down in the chair and putting his hands on his knees. "That's definitely a sound proposition. Rogers? Thoughts?"
Tony follows him up the cement steps and onto the porch. It's more of an alcove, brick walls on both sides and partial walls between the door and the street. Steve takes his keys out and fumbles them, trying not to think about Hitch.
how far outside your experience this is, I realize you didn't keep this from me for all that long, and I realize that
Tony nods solemnly while Steve lays everything out. When he picks up a one of the outlines to start going into detail Tony says, "Steve. Darling. Sweetheart. Apple dumpling. You know I love it when you get all strategic like this, right?"
"I've spent some time in sales, you know," Tony says, suddenly looking seductive again, leaning back against the bar and taking a sip from his drink. He swallows. His throat moves. Steve swallows, too.
He can't bring himself to tell them. For their sake, too, but mostly because he doesn't think he'll ever be able to say the words without throwing up.
