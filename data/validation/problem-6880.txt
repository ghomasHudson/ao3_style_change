It was the usual time Steve had his lunch break. He stepped out onto his balcony and called his boyfriend.
Steve sent Bucky a text and asked if they could talk.  He didn’t expect him to be awake, so his stomach muscles clenched at the sight of the three dots on his screen.  Bucky replied with “I’m at home.”  “Do you want me to head over?” Steve asked.  “Up to you.” Bucky wrote.
Natasha moved over to sit next to Bucky on the couch.  “Now that perv is gone, wanna watch something else?” she asked.
The brunette man grabs his wallet and heavy jacket, gives him one last hurt look, and leaves out the front door.  Steve backs away, dropping onto the couch and sobbing into his hands.
Reaching into his jacket pocket, Tony pulled out a box that looked too big and too flat to contain a ring.  He let out an uncomfortable laugh and opened it toward Steve, “Steve, baby, would you move in with me?”
“Sure, just text and ask if I am working.  Come hang out anytime.” Bucky said pleasantly, looking down at her.
“Alright psycho,” said Steve, “why would you need to bring this?”  He gestured to the gun he was holding.
The sounds erupting from Steve were the loudest and most guttural of all.  He slipped an arm back to hold Bucky’s head in place, to his surprise, Bucky allowed it.
Steve looks uneasily between them, “I uh, can go turn the TV on in the other room.  Call for me.”  He stood and left.  As soon the bedroom door was heard clicking, a rush of heat and nausea ran through Bucky’s body.
“I didn’t say you were nosey, did I?  You’re fine.” he said, forcing a smile that went away quickly.
Getting dressed, Steve told Bucky he would bring home coffee and bagels, trying to get on his good side.  Bucky didn’t seem phased and only sent a simple “okay.”
Marco quickly asked for lube and condoms, and began to prepare himself quickly.  Bucky watched, stroking himself in awe then took over aggressively.  They were grunting and moaning gutturally like animals.
After going back to sleep and waking hours later, Bucky sent Steve a message asking how they were doing.  Steve’s text was a neutral update he would give anyone.  Bucky paced his bedroom and felt his stomach clench as he wrote “I was thinking, we should probably go ahead and get together soon.  That is if you guys are up for it.”
Steve sat alone crying to himself for a few minutes.  When his tears subsided, he looked in the mirror to make sure the redness in his face went away.
Steve tilted his head over to lean on Tony’s shoulder, “No...I just need some time to get my emotions in check and let my counseling work.  This is more than thoughtful of you.”
“I guess.  Natasha talked to me about it last night.  I am feeling a little better about it just not...great.” said Steve softly, staring at his food.
“Honestly if you were ever torn in half like that,” Bucky typed, “I would just leave.”  He hit send and had to tell himself to breathe.
“I got it.” offered Steve, pulling out his phone.  “There is a really good gourmet Chinese place we found.  It’s actually authentic and only 3 blocks from here.  I could even walk to pick it up.”
Bucky watched him reach over and grab his glass of scotch without looking at it.  He downed the rest of it.
“You guys help yourself to any food in the kitchen and the drinks are in the mini fridge under the counter.  Anything you want.” she offered, “I have to go mingle but I’ll come back and hang out in a bit.”
It was too difficult for Steve to make eye contact as he stared out the giant bedroom windows.  He noticed the city lights that were starting to come on in the dusk.  “So...as you know, therapy has been really helping me out.” Steve told him, “I should have kept doing this after I got back from my tour, not just because I was at war but because...I needed to reflect on some things inside myself.  That’s all because of you, and I can’t thank you enough for that, Honey.”
The possessiveness he felt over Bucky used to get passed off (in his mind) as a strong friendship. Now, knowing what he knew, Steve had to find it in himself to be mature and supportive.
“I’m glad you enjoy that so much,” nodded Bucky, “it really suits you.  I’m sure those kids just eat you up.”
“Kay.”  came Bucky’s bitter voice as he dropped in the grounds and water to start the pot to brew.  He walked quickly into the adjacent laundry room to put on pants from the dryer.
Natasha was flirting with Bucky and dominating their conversations.  Steve tried to talk with her and distract her when Bucky went off to work, but she would become completely distracted every time he approached them.
They stared at each other for a minute.  Steve’s eyes sparkling with love while Tony remained scowling.  “Is there something wrong?”
Sucking in a breath, Steve nodded.  Bucky slowly turned him onto his stomach and slid down the underwear just enough to expose Steve’s muscular ass.
"Shelbyville, Indiana originally. I moved to Long Island when I was 12." Bucky replied, "What about you?"
Nervously, Tony walked inside.  As they both went up the steps, the gun reappeared against Tony’s lower back.  Frank looked around the open floor plan home, then walked them over to the dining table.
All the working out he’d been doing gave him the upper body strength to hold Tony’s weight on his back while he met his thrusts.  “Fuck,” Tony groaned into his ear from behind, kissing his neck and shoulder, “you feel so fucking tight.  I love you, love being inside you.”
He felt a little proud of himself since he stopped whatever might have just happened.  They didn’t, so that should count for something.
After working out, Sam asked Bucky if he would join them for group therapy sometime.  He could only give him a maybe since he had a lot on his plate.
They took the uber home and after talking the rest of the night in their separate beds, they drifted off to sleep.
He could see it would make Tony uncomfortable because he had to explain later how he felt about it.  “I just can’t hurt you.” Tony had said, “I love you too much and I don’t like to feel pain, so I don’t want to inflict it on other people.  I’m sorry, babe.”
He sent Steve a text saying he was headed home.  It was around 4 as promised, therefore traffic was a nightmare coming back into Manhattan.
Sipping his coffee, Steve sent Natasha a text, asking if they could talk.  She replied with “Is this about Bucky’s facebook?”  Natasha was always a few steps ahead of him.
Bucky froze then moved his lips with him for a few seconds.  He was patiently waiting for Steve to pull back to take a breath.
Tony doesn’t say anything which means Steve has to physically turn to look at him, just to confirm that it’s Tony.  It is.  And Stark’s looking a lot like he wishes he hadn’t bothered making the trip back up the elevator.
Steve looks down for a flicker of a second then back up again. This time with resolve in his eyes, like he knows what’s coming is going to be painful but he’ll face it anyway.
“That sounds doable,” Bruce agrees. There is really no request James could make that Bruce won’t consider. This one is an easy yes. “Once we’re inside, Tony might be on the screens. You’ll hear Jarvis’s voice if I need a second opinion on IV placement. Steve was in Tony’s lab last time I saw him so he might be visible as well. Do you want me to keep them out of sight?”
“Steve’s got an old computer up in his room,” Tony says.  “If he’ll let us rip it apart, there’s our circuit board.  Gun powder isn’t going to be a problem.”
“You don’t need to try and make me feel better,” Steve says.  “Sometimes you do the best you can and it’s still not enough. I might not like it but I’ve got to live with it.”
"How many times should I have let it happen, then?" Nanna asks, with a disarmingly patient smile that seems to appear out of nowhere.
Steve isn’t sure what to say.  Of course Tony doesn’t need his help.  Even without the suit, Tony’s got a ton of self-defense training.  He could have taken Jonathan easily.  Yet he stood there and took the hit.  Was ready to take another hit.  Has taken too many hits.
Rhodey gives a sort of waffling gesture.  “They weren’t knocking him around, if that’s what you’re asking.  They weren’t a big help though, either.  They mostly ignored him, unless he was acting out.  Howard had other priorities.”
Steve tracks down Clint’s cable company and pays in advance for a full year of HBO.  It’s the least he can do.
Clint turns a little in the seat so Bruce has any easier time inspecting him.  He’s careful with his touch, and Clint manages to keep himself perfectly still.
“A story I’m going to demand to hear over lunch,” Tony says.  He turns on the car and puts it in drive.  “For now, we’re going to talk about feelings and it’s going to suck and just... roll with it, okay?”
“I’ll call you tomorrow when I get home, okay?” Tony said softly as he was sliding into the fancy car service that was picking him up.  He closed the door and rolled down the window.
The smaller man went limp in his arms, and let his strong hands take over.  One went to Tony’s left pec to hold him up and play with his nipple.  The other continued petting his dick expertly.
“Fuck yes.” the man hissed behind him, teasing Steve’s entrance with a fingertip.  “Nice and tight just like I remember.”
The tall thin man turned to him and said he was looking for an address, then listed theirs down to the unit number.  Only 2 other tenants lived in the building.
“Tones.” Rhodey grinned back, leaning over to hug his friend.  Carol stepped up to do the same.  “Love that sweater dress.” Tony said with admiration.  It was color blocked with blue on top, gold around the middle, and red on the bottom..
Steve put on a brave face and smiled back at him, “Hey, yourself.  Did you ask everybody to come over?”
They laughed together.  When their smiles faded, they sat and listened to the current song playing for a minute.
As soon as the rest of the crowd silenced and looked over at the two men, Tony started to speak loud for all to hear.  “I’d like to propose a toast to Steve.  He came here to do inspections, unpacked us, decorated, and basically self catered this entire event tonight.  So let’s hear it for him!”  Everyone cheered and sipped their drink, including a smiling Steve.  As soon as it was silent again, Tony clinked their glasses together.  Steve stood frozen as Tony sipped his own drink, setting it down on a side table.
Steve’s arms went limp and his hands fell from his hips, “I have been trying to split my time!  I’ve been asking for your approval with everything I do!  You said you were fine.”
"You do too," slurred Steve, "honey."  His hips were now wiggling while pushing back against Tony's cock.
Steve looked around the large living room to find the sliding glass door to Nat's balcony. "Patio is over there. Want some company?"
“Yeah, me too.” replied Bucky.  He could tell Natasha was holding back on pressing the problem between him and Steve.  “What do you think I should do?” he asked.
“Hey.” Marco says, laughing awkwardly.  He brushes back his dark bangs.  He’d shaved his hair into an almost mohawk and you could see more of his tan skin on his neck.  There had to be so much product in his semi short locks holding them in place.  He was dressed up with a clean shave,  wearing a nice blue button down shirt with a vest, tie, and jeans.  Marco’s sleeves were rolled, making his arms look bigger and stronger.
"Look," Bucky said tenderly, "I'm not trying to add to your stress right now.  I just think we need to address this elephant in the room."
Steve nodded against his grasp and managed to squeak out a "Please."  Tony decided to taunt him by letting go of his throat and spreading his cheeks.  He started rubbing the tip of his dick over Steve’s hole. Even with water lightly spraying them, Steve could still feel the precum being spread on his rim.
Steve still occasionally was going to see Tony at his place, but it was only for meals and short visits.  Their sleepovers had stopped completely and Steve could tell his boyfriend was getting antsy.
The two men would go to group therapy together and tried to be each other’s allies when either of them had a flashback or nightmares.  If Steve couldn’t get in touch with Sam, he had his boyfriend.
Tony shushed him and snuggled in closer to look back up into his eyes, “Let’s not think about that.  Not right now.  Okay?”  “Okay.” he nodded, letting out a deep breath.
There was silence for a minute, then Bucky let go of him slowly and sat in his own chair, putting his knees between Steves and rubbing his shoulders.
“So we’ll pick your clothes up on the way back to my place.” suggested Tony, “This is a beautiful night for us and I want to celebrate on my big bed by worshipping you.”
“I don’t know for sure.” Bucky wrote, “You’re essentially still saying you are torn between Tony and I.  That’s not good.”
“I’m done.  I told you let me know if I’m being too nosey!  I just wanted to understand what happened.”
He kept assuring himself that this wasn’t going to be an attack or a barrage of accusations.  In no way could he let himself get emotional.  This needed to be a normal discussion about communication, not the new relationship blossoming in his friend’s life.
Steve ignores him and drops to his knees to pick up the bigger pieces one by one.  “I prefer to clean up my own messes.”
“You need to get some sleep,” Bruce says. “And to eat if you can. There are still some StarkBars in my bag, and once you’ve got something in your stomach you can take more pain pills.”
“Barnes,” Bruce sighs. “He had his glove on a puck that got smacked free. Somehow took Barnes’s glove with it, and someone got tripped up. Skated over Barnes’s palm and nearly cut him clean through.”
“It’s not a malfunction,” James says slowly and insistently, as if Clint and Bruce need convincing. When he opens his eyes his focus is fixed beyond the room like he’s staring right through Bruce and Clint at unseen captors and vicious men. “I have the mission report.”
Tony’s looking down at his plate now, pushing his dessert around into a messy swirl of raspberry and chocolate.  He’s smiling, but by the tense set of his shoulders, Steve can tell Stark would rather be anywhere but there.
“Basically? They fucked with your head so much there’s no rhyme or reason to what you’d remember and you definitely weren’t in any shape to be making calls on your own. It makes sense. Torture can break just about anyone so how do you make sure your super soldier doesn’t give up all your secrets? Wipe him after every mission.”
“Natasha Romanoff? Codename Black Widow,” James says, then pauses, as if trying to place a memory. “I shot her.”
but he wanted to know the specific part of their current shitshow that was causing Steve so much pain.  So Tony’d typed out a few lines of code to force a sneaky screenshare.
“Tony, Bruce, I need you to head into the trees first.  Stick together.  Head downhill.  Once you’re in past a hundred feet that copter will be firing at you blind,” Steve says, his voice steady and firm.  “We’ll hold their attention to give you a head start.”
It takes a full week of sleeping together before Tony agrees to let Steve call the points. They’ve just woken up in Tony’s bed, and he’s warm and he’s happy, and it’s about damn time to share that joy with their friends.
Tony fumbles with the buckle to get himself free.  When it clicks open, he climbs out.   Steve checks to make sure there aren’t any cars coming then exits after him, because he’s not going to continue this conversation by shouting out the door.  As soon as Steve takes a step in his direction, Tony takes several steps back toward the car to keep it between them.
Sam warms up to Tony pretty quickly, now that it’s obvious Tony really is on their side.  And since Tony hasn’t heard much about the events that led up to the Tri-Skelion mess, he gets filled in on the details over Lamb Jalfrezi and beer.  When Sam brings up his broken wings and sounds completely torn up about their loss, Tony stops with his fork in mid-air.
There’s concern there on Bucky’s behalf, and it sounds genuine.  Steve appreciates that more than he knows what to do with.
Tony’s team-- the Manhattan Rampage-- is only one win away from first in their division. And even if they’re going to get there without Tony, he still wants to watch.
“I don’t want to hear it,” Steve says as he lifts the first box of explosives carefully out of the back.
Bruce recognizes Sam’s technique. He’s keeping Bruce engaged. He’s looking him in the eye and asking questions to keep him present and in the moment. Bruce would tell him it isn’t necessary except a little bit maybe it is. If nothing else it’s easing the awful absolute that losing James is inevitable. Sam doesn’t look like a man with no hope.
Tony’s bleeding from a small cut on his cheek and he’s rubbing his jaw like he’s been hit.  He’s staring at Jonathan with wide eyes, full of betrayal.  Jonathan’s holding the car keys in his fist and he’s got his arm pulled back like he’s going to punch Tony again.
“Where’d you learn to do that?” Tony asks.  He still looks calm as he goes back to drinking his coffee.
Someone (probably Natasha) had left a fresh glass of water and a bottle of pain pills on the nightstand. Bruce hands two to Clint, who takes them immediately.
“Bucky, shut up,” Clint groans.  “Unless you brought me coffee from home and then I don’t care, just give me coffee.  I’ll love you forever.”
“In that case, give me a minute to change into something more comfortable and I’ll meet you down there.”
Tony won’t meet his eyes.  “What you saw... It wasn’t Jonathan’s fault.  I’d been pushing his buttons all night.  I do that.  It’s all me.”
“I’m sorry,” he starts.  Because he is sorry.  “I know this is a long shot, but is Mr. Stark in today?”
“Fuck,” Natasha swears. “Stark-- I know you monitor these comms! Clint’s on the roof. We need an evac! Now!”
They all skate to center ice, and Bucky looks over their assembled friends. There’s really only one choice that makes sense.
They stand and Steve carries the box of shards with him as they walk toward the entrance of the penthouse to wait.  The silence is much less awkward now than it’s been in weeks.  Probably because it’s no longer full of things that need to be said.
“But he’ll wake up,” Steve says, letting out a breath that speaks volumes about Steve’s stress level. Maybe he’d heard it from JARVIS, but it’s obvious what he’d needed was to hear it from Bruce.
“You’d know if I snuck in here with with anyone else,” Bruce points out. “And yes, that’s James. I’m not 100 percent sure he won’t kill you when he comes out, so if you’d rather us take a walk, I can leave a note.”
Tony reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small blue box.  He flicks it open and inside there are two rings.
A few days later, Ms. Potts asks Steve to stop by the tower to sign for the ownership of some shares in Stark Industries that Howard had left behind for him in case Steve ever returned.  Even after all those years, Howard had never given up hope.  Steve really doesn’t know what to make of that.
“We all get it,” Clint says, standing up without being asked. “After a bad mission-- some people don’t like to be alone. I don’t. And then once I’m a little more with it I want everyone the fuck out.”
“Makeup tips,” she says with a smirk. “Or how to kick a guy in the balls so he won’t be getting up anytime soon. Maybe both in one video. I’ve got plenty of talent to share. One of you could be my demonstration dummy.”
Steve's smile borders on flirtatious and Tony's really not sure what to do about that.  Steve's sitting close enough that their arms are touching and it warms Tony all over.
When Bucky was alone once again, he definitely felt more calm than he had in weeks.  He’s so relaxed, that even when his sister video calls Bucky to bitch about her life, he listens attentively and it doesn’t phase him a bit.
Steve had been drawing more lately, making sure his mind was occupied with something positive.  He was only able to meet Sam for a run a few times a week when he could escape the scumbags that were always waiting outside.
Steve huffed at himself when he looked down on the floor to find Bucky’s bed deflated.  He’d foolishly forgotten to set it back up.
“Me either honey.  Just talk to me, calmly.” said Steve, rubbing the soft skin on his back with one hand.
Steve spit out his mouth wash, “I mean, I had to get an extension for Bucky.  So it will be up again in about 4 weeks.”
“The problem was,” Steve said apprehensively, “he made some poor decisions, but his old partner um...overreacted.”
Later that week, Bucky dominated all of his interviews.  He decided to work at the most upscale place which was a whiskey bar in the middle of Manhattan.
Tony tossed the towel on the counter and looked up at his boyfriend a little irritated, “No, I think I’ve been very supportive.  Even though you spend every spare moment with him so he doesn’t have to be alone.”
“We betrayed the trust of a man that I respect very much that has been very good to me.  To both of us.  He even makes an effort to be my friend.”
Tony thought to himself for a second then sighed, “Fine.  Sleep on the sofa.”  He stormed out of the bathroom and went to bed.
"He bugged me about why I wasn't married yet, then asked if I was 'still a faggot' in front of everyone."
They stared at each other silently for a minute before Bucky just said “Alright then.”  Tony shifted carefully to stand up from the couch.  He stepped over to him and extended his hand to shake.
In a flash, Steve gripped the rail over the stairs and pulled himself up to put his feet through the gap underneath.  He slid across the floor to scoop up the gun and point it at the man struggling to pry the knife out his arm.  Steve yelled, “Stop right there!”  He stood up and watched Frank finally yank the knife free, bleeding all over the wooden floors.
Wiping his face and sniffing, Steve tried to even his voice.  “Sorry for being emotional.  I’m just weird right now.””  He sobbed and shook his head.
Steve shook his head, “I appreciate it, but you don’t have to cater to me or anything.  You deserve happiness.”
Tony told him “His name is Frank.  Were you the person to lay him off or mishandle his case or something?”  Still Steve shook his head in response.  He moved toward the cuffed, unconscious man for a second to examine his Army uniform.  Seeing the last name sewed into it still didn’t give Steve any clues.  “I don’t remember Frank Montago.”
The long haired man had a tight black Jack Daniels t-shirt under his denim jacket and his eyes looked like he didn’t sleep much the night before.
Bucky opened and closed his mouth a few times, trying to decide what to say.  “I’m not upset about the...walking in on me.  It’s fine, but I'm curious, did you get a good look at who else was in that picture?”
They stopped by a phone store and got Bucky a new device then stopped at a small grocery store for some food.
“Sure.  He’s just so extra.  You know Tony...” Steve said, rolling his eyes, “Plus, Bucky here is staying with me for a little while so I can’t really start nesting yet.”
Bucky stayed where he was while Steve took Tony’s spot on the couch.  It was obvious Steve was trying not to cry.  He looked as if he was in pain as he stared at the floor.
A few drinks into the night, Natasha was watching Bucky take care of a patron when she leaned in to Steve’s ear, “Hey.”
Steve usually had to get up super early to prepare things in the kitchen before his run.  Breakfast was then made gourmet by him, sometimes it was super specific to Tony’s preference.  (And required trips to multiple stores per dish.)
The both nodded silently to themselves for a few minutes.  Steve drank the water from the coffee table.
Bucky looked confused for a second then scratched the back of his head, “Look, I’m going to make coffee, but keep talking.  I’m listening.”
They found Natasha chatting with Tony in the kitchen.  She was sitting on her counter and he was making himself another drink.
Pulling the blade out of his knife, Steve said loudly “You forgot to lock the front door, hun.”  Steve saw the man point his gun back towards the sound of his voice.
It may have been selfish, but Tony wanted to hurry and start the next chapter with his boyfriend.  Moving in with someone had never been desirable to him before Steve.
Bucky took another gulp of his coffee then rubbed his friend’s arm with his skin hand.  “Are you going to call him or anything?”
Bucky grabbed an ashtray off of a table and pulled out his cigarettes.  He put one in his mouth and lit it.
“I would like to be friends.” added Marco, sipping his own root beer, “It would be nice if we spoke regularly again.”
After a minute, Tony sauntered out wearing a pair of jeans and holding two t-shirts and a blazer.  "Which one, babe?"
Steve closed the closet door and stood against it, “Can’t say I am, although Shelbyville is tempting.”
Tony noticed Bucky and Nat deep in conversation and steered Steve over to the vacant loveseat in the living room.  “He’s making friends.” he whispered to his boyfriend like they were proud parents.
“It’s okay you didn’t want to tell me,” Natasha sent, “I’m just really perceptive.  Always have been.  Steve has been absolutely crushed over this situation.  He’s riddled with anxiety.  I’m not saying you should try to start over, and this was his fault too.  However, you should at least tell them you are glad he and Tony are okay.”
She asked what it was about, so he described the dream in detail.  “I think I know what that could mean.” Natasha wrote.
Since they were making confessions, Bucky said “I’ve had feelings for you...since we first started being friends too.”  He became extremely self conscious and thought he sounded pathetic, “Since the first time I walked home with you to play video games.”
When they pulled back, Steve pulled them under the water and began to lather Tony with their fancy body wash.  The older man smiled at him hazily, “You don’t need to do that anymore, remember?”  Tony was kissed again before being turned around to have his back washed.  “I’ll admit I really did enjoy bathing you.” Steve told him, “It’s intimate and it makes me happy to see you relaxed.”
They start making out and Steve even pulls the tablet out of Tony’s hands to straddle him and kiss him even more fiercely.
Tony sighed and attempted a smile, “I like to believe that he loves me too.  You can love a couple people at once.  I mean, have you been to Brooklyn lately?  Most of the gen Z’s are in open relationships.”
He introduced Bucky and she went to shake his prosthetic then made a whole ordeal about apologizing and they both had to assure her that she didn’t do anything wrong.
“How did it go from friendship to friendlier?” asked Steve, mentally slapping himself at his word choice.  “Tell me if I’m being too nosey.”
As they arrived at the apartment building, Bucky had to wake up his friend and get him out of the cab.
Steve buries his face in his hands but jumps at the loud crash echoing in their bedroom.  Abruptly he uncovered his eyes to see a broken vase shattered on the floor and the pedestal it once sat on still rocking back and forth.
“No.” whimpered Steve, looking down at his lap.  “I just found out about an hour ago.  Besides, he’s doing an inspection at his lab right now for his seminar.  I won’t even be able to see him off when he leaves tomorrow.”
Bucky continued to cry.  Steve pulled him back against his chest, rubbing his back in circles.  “It’s going to be okay,” said Steve.  “It’s fine, Buck.  I’m sorry too.”
as we get home.”  He started to look over the party guests to make sure Carol wasn’t within earshot.
That night, Steve and Tony were in their boxer briefs, turning down the duvet and getting ready for bed.  Switching on his lamp, Tony asked “So what did you guys do over at Bucky’s place?”
Tony’s recovery process from being shot was still in the early stages.  He’d gotten lucky since he didn’t need surgery and only needed a few stitches.  Physical therapy had to start immediately to make sure he wasn’t experiencing muscle fatigue or blood clots.
“Five years ago, I told you how I felt about you." said Steve, tears falling silently, "You're the one who didn't say it back."
“I want to move in, honey, I do.” said Steve sincerely, taking a few steps toward him with his arms out.
“What do you want?” asked Tony calmly, but still sounded nervous.  “You can have anything.  I could tell you where I keep all my watches, everyth-.”
Tony couldn’t help noticing how muscular Peter was, how his beautiful brown eyes stared up at him when he was explaining something to the boy.  It was obvious the young intern was hanging on his every word.  It was nice to feel idolized and revered.
Bucky was groaning and panting, whimpering “No...no!” repeatedly.  His prosthetic arm was clutched around a couch pillow as he laid on his right side.
Steve agreed and hugged him tight until he was forced to let go.  He watched Bucky get dressed and go to work.
“Hey babe.” came Tony’s voice, “I had a little bit of time and wanted to hear your voice.  How’s your day?”
Just as he was emerging from the door to the staircase, he spotted his package on his welcome mat in the purple hallway.  However, there was also a man dressed in a black denim jacket and pants sitting on the floor, leaning against the door to his apartment.
Steve was at work on his lunch break with his 2 best friends he had there, Natasha and Wanda.  The three of them were complaining about their boss while opening their lunches they brought.
Please give me comments.  It's my life blood.  The next chapter will go right on into their little discussion.  D-Rama!
Rhodey crossed his arms and stared sternly at his friend, “So you’ll think about possibly ending things with Steve and let me know what you decide?”
“Do you need me to go get you anything?” Steve offered, “I don’t need to teach a class tonight until 6.”
“Yeah, she offered.  We have just been getting to know each other.  She’s been chatting with me through stuff with my dad.”
“Like I said,” whimpered Steve, “he doesn’t talk to me anymore.  Bucky feels terrible and he wants to apologize to you but he is also scared.  It was my idea.  He’s my best friend and really was trying to just be supportive at first.  I pushed it too far.”
Tony stood from the long wooden conference table where they were gathered, “That won’t be necessary.  I’m leaving now.  You know where to call if there is a problem.” The other 5 men in military uniforms stood as well.
Bucky looked over his shoulder so his voice was better heard over the loud music, “I know you want 2 bottles of Heineken.  My treat.”
For a minute Steve debated bringing up the past. He remembered things about Bucky's home life when they were in school together that seemed relevant, but also could possibly upset him.
When Steve looked back at him, he realized just how sloshy his head felt.  This drink probably should be his last.
Steve nodded with worried brows.  “You just…” Tony continued, “I’m sad because of the level of...betrayal.  It’s not like you at all.”  He got up to sit next to Steve on the edge.  “I mean, I still love you enough to...work on it.” sighed Tony.
Plopping down on Steve’s couch, Bucky sighed and proclaimed “I’m so glad you came with me today.  Thanks for dropping everything to help me, man.”
They got their food, enjoying the expensive but delicious meal.  The only conversation while they ate was about the performing jazz pianist.
Steve heard the words going through his mind once again.  “Tell him.  You don’t deserve all this if you aren’t honest.”
Steve felt weird witnessing this heavy conversation.  He started to get up off the sofa, but Bucky put his prosthetic hand on his knee to keep him there.
Bucky pulled back to look at him, “Alright, let’s get out of-”  He was interrupted by a man shoving him from behind.
Of course Tony wanted to do something dirty, but Steve asked him to settle for listening to soft jazz on the couch by the fireplace and cuddling.  Steve had Tony’s back against his chest so he didn’t have to see his sad, vacant expression as the events from earlier stayed in the front of his mind.
Paparazzi were constantly parked outside of the hotel where they stayed in hopes of getting a glimpse of either of the two men.  Steve’s black eye was still prominent since he had been punched directly into his eye.
Picking up his fork to dig in, Tony said “I’m so excited.  I think you should stay over tonight to honor the next step in our relationship.”
Sunday morning, Steve woke up in Tony’s bed from the sound of his alarm.  It was about 8:00AM and the two of them were naked and spooning.
“We have to get rid of them anyways.  They creep me out now.” said Steve, squinting at them.  He had to see his boyfriend tied up in one chair and contained Frank in another.  Tony put his good arm around his boyfriend’s waist, “Looks like we will be furniture shopping again soon then.”
Bucky admitted to Steve after the 3rd night of them sharing a bed that he’d never felt so rested in his life.
“You alright?” asked Bucky.  His chin was propped on top of the blonde’s head and he rubbed his back gently.
That made Bucky smile at him, Steve laughed all over again at his expense.  The brunette responded “I would love to, but it’s my first day to myself that I’ve had in a while.  I think I’ll just do my own thing.  I appreciate it though.”
Soon there was a knock at the front door.  Promptly, as the door opened, Marco emerged with a big smile on his face and connected their lips eagerly.
“Yeah, it’s got very minimal beans.  It’s mostly meat.  I need to make some rice still.” Bucky told him.
Rubbing his jaw, Bucky licked his lips before speaking again.  He let his eyes wander as he said, “I kissed him.  I don’t know why but I  just felt a weight lift off my shoulders when it happened. Marco was so nice about it.  He gently stopped it and told me it wasn’t the right time but that everything would be okay.”
“How can you guys possibly want to be my friend anymore?” asked Bucky, pulling back slightly.  Steve smiled at his blotchy face and swollen eyes, “That’s what love is.  The certain type of love can always change.  There is nothing wrong with it.”
Clint crosses the room, passes Bruce and gives him a hearty pat on the back as he moves toward his duffel bag. He picks it up by the strap and slings it over his shoulder before walking out the front door.
A warm smile came over his face as he went to join Steve at the dining table.  Bucky put his plate down and stood next to him for a second.
“I want Steve.” Frank interrupted, walking around the chair to face him.  He never put the gun down.  “I need to talk to him.” he sneered.
It was a normal occurrence lately for the two of them to have discussions about all the lifestyle changes that were going to have to happen when they live together.  This was only another one added to the list.
“You’re stronger than that.  You’ve fought for this country.  They can’t just get rid of you.” Bucky assured him.
When he would visit Steve more often a few years ago, they visited a tiny Korean place.  That food would chase away hangovers after long nights out at the bar.
Wrapping his plush bathrobe around himself, Tony walked over to his boyfriend and kissed him sweetly, “Alright then...but then...you’ll be...officially all moved in?”  He was smiling with an exaggerated surprised expression.
Steve nodded, “Alright.  I think I was going to go stay with Tony again tomorrow night, but I will be back in time to see you off, hopefully.”
“It was all pure luck how I got it.” said Bucky, following him to the couch in the living room.  They sat on opposite sides of the large sofa, smirking and laughing a little at the tension that seemed to be there.
He noticed the laundry door open and the dryer going. Bucky's empty duffel lay on top of the machines.
Steve peeked in the office doorway down the hall, “Hey.”  Tony’s scowl turned to a soft smile as he turned his attention to the man.  “Hey!  I know I said I was done with work for the day, but I got this one email to finish.  I hope that’s okay.”
Steve picked at his lunch as he turned his attention back to the man on the phone, “Sorry, babe.  I’m here.”
“You know it.  I managed to track down my great-grandfather’s metals.  They are made out of silver!”  When Steve’s boyfriend shook his head, he worried for a second.  “If we’re moving in together is that a problem that I like to research my heritage and collect World War 2 artifacts?  We could sell them to a museum one day, ya know.”
Steve jumped up and got in his way, “Why are like this?!  Why is your first instinct to flee, huh?”  He was fully crying.  It felt like Bucky was trying to get them broken up as friends as soon as possible so he could get the “hurting” over with.
“It looks good so far.  I just got here and did a walkthrough of the floor.  I give my presentation tomorrow.” Tony told him casually.  He could hear random people in the background echoing in undoubtedly a hallway.
Steve had no serious injuries (except for the mental ones) and was moved to a low-risk job at a base in New York.
Abruptly, Tony’s head shot up to give him a dirty glare.  “So, you’re trying to tell ME what I should do right now?”
Steve interjected and started a new discussion on how Bucky should prioritize his potential places of employment.  Then Bucky started talking to Tony about his company.
It was pretty crowded and noisy that night but it was mainly small groups staying at their tables with friends, only getting up to get more drinks.
When they were stripped completely, there were no words exchanged.  Bucky pushed Marco to his back on the bed and dropped on top of him to keep roughly making out and thrusting their bodies together.
“As a precaution,” she announced, “I have hired a security team to wait downstairs and at the elevator of this floor.”
“Sure, maybe.  I mean, the nightmares really haven’t been happening for a while.” murmured Bucky, wiping his face.
Tony simply fastened the top button of his suit jacket and put on his coat.  Saying “Gentleman.” and nodding before leaving the room.
He smiled back at his new friend fondly.  “Thanks, Nat.  I just...I worry about my family and my own life and how things will turn out and I guess that bleeds into my dreams.  I’ve had sleeping issues for a long time.”
“I see...yeah it’s hard out here but I’m sure you could find something.  Maybe I can help.  What do you do normally?”
They talked more about Tony’s trip until the food came, followed by their friends.  It was a nice little gathering.  Everyone left full of food and alcohol.
“I miss him, Nat.” whimpered Steve, obviously referring to Bucky.  “It’s been over a month now since I heard from him or seen him.”  He started to cry a little.
James’s eyes dart between the two men and he takes a step back to lean against one of the porch supports. Now that the initial panic is gone Bruce empathizes with James’s struggle to regain control.
‘A few weeks left in rehab', turns out to mean five.  No one wants to rush Tony home, especially not Steve.
He usually enjoys their banter but today his heart’s not in it.  Pepper sits on the edge of his desk and smooths some hair out of his eyes.
Tony shrugs before turning on his heel.  “I’ve flown further for less.  Come on, old man.  Let’s get some lunch.”
“Can an egg be worthy?” Tony asks, offhandedly.  Or it would be off-handed if he didn’t have a gleam in his eye that makes Steve smirk.
“I don’t think you are. It’s just important to me to identify you in the way you want to be identified. I still-- I don’t really say the Other Guy’s name when I don’t have to. My friends all say it and it’s not like I can blame them; they’ve got to call him something. I just don’t like to own it.”
“I do, yeah,” Clint agrees.  “Nothing fancy.  Just a farmhouse off the grid, with a bunch of land between it and the nearest neighbors-- it’s somewhere safe. Always was somewhere safe. Maybe that would be enough.”
“Cheerful,” Steve muses.  “You want to stick around for a bit? Tony suggested I spend some more time on the plan for what we’re going to do with Bucky once we get him here.  I know we’ve discussed it at a high level but the actual details...”
It doesn’t take long to unload their makeshift bombs, and then while Tony, Bruce and Steve get the explosives set up, Bucky moves the van back to a safe distance near the tree-line.  They manage all their work within the ten minute window of time they have allotted for the distraction that will allow Kate and Nanna to get out of the server farm safely, and for now, things are on track.
zombies were harmed in the making of that Vine.  Plus, Steve made disappointed eyes at me and I offered to reimburse the company but it was like 53 cents worth of staples and I need to wait until I get my check--”
It’s not a good situation but Steve’s willing to try and work through it.  When he pictures Tony at the Children’s Hospital, or ushering nervous interns through a crowded lobby, or explaining science in a way that lights up his whole face, Steve knows that Tony is worth the effort.
“It wasn’t made for him,” Natasha explains. “Or for you, Bruce.  An old friend sent me an ICER, in case I ran across an enhanced operative who wasn’t going to be taken down with anything else.”
For a few seconds Steve thinks she’s serious.  And then she smirks.  Clint actually looks a little disappointed when he realizes she’s teasing.
“I’ve thought about it,” Tony agrees, once he’s tucked his knees comfortably to the side.  “But it’s not like that would bring mom and dad back.  I have my doubts it would make me feel any better.  And as much as I can’t believe I’m saying this-- it isn’t all about me.”
Steve doesn’t speak. Not because he doesn’t remember Mercy Rhodes but because he remembers an awful lot about Mercy all at once. Not all of it rated G. The boy (he’s probably twenty, but God, twenty looks young these days) takes Steve’s silence as a no.
Tony doesn’t reply.  Steve checks to make sure Tony’s still breathing then drives on to a private airport.  Pepper may be angry and frustrated, but she’d still helped arrange a StarkJet to get them back to New York.  Steve had tried to contact Jarvis for help first, but he’d gotten no reply.
“He’s on my list,” James says, glancing back toward the mountain where Clint had been watching. “I'd have found him eventually. All your other friends, too.”
If you're an author and you rec your fic in the comments I will go and read and give you lots of love!
“Had enough fresh air for now?” Steve asks.  He sounds a little disappointed.  "They're going to be relentless until we eat the fries."
It’s the guilt from his earlier rudeness that gets Steve moving, and maybe also the newish edge in Tony’s voice.  Tony’s walking fast but Steve easily catches up.  They take the stairs instead of the elevator, down to an R&D floor Steve’s never visited.  There’s a kitchen there, and Tony yanks down mugs and plates and dumps them in a cardboard box that had previously held paper towels, according to the print on the side.
“That’s helpful,” Bruce says.  “When you say that it’s uncomfortable, could you talk more about that? Actually, can I put you on hold for a second?”
“You know, this feels a lot like a conversation I’d usually have with Tony,” Bruce says, stepping into the living room.  His smile tells Kate that he doesn't consider this a bad thing.
They’d talked about sex on multiple occasions.  Told each other what they wanted and what they absolutely didn’t want.  It was difficult because Steve had boundaries and Tony mostly seemed to think whatever Steve wanted was fine.  And in their case that could work because Steve was a good guy.  He wouldn’t take advantage of Tony’s hesitance to make his desires known.
“Ohhhhh,” Pepper says.  She looks incredibly relieved as she reaches over, picks up the bottle of wine on the table, and pours Steve a glassful.  “In that case... welcome to the club.”
He knows he ought to be as pissed at Tony as everyone else is.  Steve certainly hadn’t come out smelling of roses in Tony’s interviews.  They’d been scathing.  At times downright vicious.  Tony had laid bare almost as many of Steve’s secrets as he’d known.  He’d mocked Steve’s insecurities and inadequacies, his home-sickness for the past, his occasional difficulties with tech.  He’d given out Steve’s personal cell phone number on national television.  The one thing Tony hadn’t done was out him; he’d kept Steve’s sexuality to himself.  It made no sense.
Steve glances back at his boyfriend. Tony’s moved over to the nearest white board and he’s using a marker to write out a long, complicated equation. He pauses to explain a set of brackets, points at the board and underlines something, and the group gathered around him laughs. Tony’s audience grows by the second. Dr. Wilkes, and half the people who are left in the room, are taking notes. They look varying degrees of confused and amazed. There is absolutely no doubt that whatever Tony’s saying is absolutely blowing their minds.
“I think that’s enough,” Steve says abruptly, interrupting Sean as he starts in again with some new lurid detail.
Nanna looks surprised as she shakes her head in protest.  “No, dear.  Howard never spoke ill of you to me.  When he talked about you as a child, he often remarked that he saw potential in you that would allow you to surpass his own achievements.  Maybe there was a hint of jealousy there, but also pride.”
Steve gives Tony a dirty look, and Tony looks extremely pleased with himself.  He really must love being a little shit.  Which is probably why Steve is enjoying this conversation.
“When he’d talk about how you were friends, I never believed him,” Tony says.  “My dad was a mean drunk.  Why would Captain America be friends with someone like that?  Now look.  Me a drunk and you’re still here.  I guess it makes some sort of warped sense.”
“I’m staying in the house,” Steve tells James. “I won’t leave till you want me gone. Have JARVIS tell me if you want to talk, and I’ll be right in.”
“Ugh, you’ve somehow made them even more useless,” Tony complains, as his hair gets pulled in the process.  “What did you do to them?”
“You don’t owe me an explanation,” Steve says gently, after Pepper trails off.  “I know he doesn’t like me.”
It’s surreal to follow Steve out the window, carrying a gun, wearing a borrowed hoodie and hat, to move over/under/around/through a maze of fire escapes, narrow ledges and at one point a roof. They’re definitely avoiding cameras, though. Steve seems to know the location of every single one that could be a problem and they take extra care to avoid them.
“You’re calling middle?” Tony asks, following as Clint leads them carefully down the alley. It’s a strange conversation to have while they’ve all got guns out, but Clint and Steve seem perfectly comfortable. “Just like that?”
“I wouldn’t say better,” Steve disagrees.  Not better by a long shot but she’s not wrong.  Something small has shifted.  And while he’s far from being okay he’s definitely not as miserable he was when he woke up that morning.
Tony sniffs a few more times then reaches up to dry his eyes with the cuff of his sleeves.  He grimaces at the blood that wipes away along with the tears.  “Science is my thing.  You can’t steal my thing and then use it against me.  That’s un-American.”
“You’d better.  And you also better get back all in one piece, mister, or we’re going to have words.”
Tony moves over to the desk and runs his fingers carefully over the model of the USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D).  It’s hand painted and the details are exactly right. +100 Tony Stark Sex Points to Steve for this thing.
There’s a thunk like an elephant from out in the living room, then rapid footsteps dashing up the stairs.
Steve’s setting some career records. Tony’s on the path to set some league records. They’re both way too busy to meet up. At least until the week between when the regular season ends and their playoffs begin.
The TV shuts off and the room darkens considerably.  A lamp near the elevator begins to glow.  In the soft light, Tony looks different.  Less burdened.  Softer around the edges.  And he also looks like he’s going to wake up with sore shoulders and a crick in his neck.
“Thanks,” Bruce says. He really can’t say anything more than that or he risks word vomiting to Clint that he’s a fraud, and a monster, and why don’t any of them have better sense than to spend time with him for fuck’s sake, he’s
They all look starstruck and shell-shocked.  Like the halfway point between a rock concert and a war zone.  Steve can see from their tags that they’re interns.  Must be eighteen or nineteen at most.
James moves deliberately around the table.  He pulls out three small pieces of tech from the third box and places them off to the side.  He picks up the instructions and takes a few steps back to read them.  He keeps an eye on the room like he expects something to jump up and attack him.
The place is totally deserted except for the two of them.  They walk through one full building and half of another before they reach a door that takes a special code to open.  Once they’re inside, they are surrounded by carefully shelved crates.
Two words.  Three, maybe, depending on how Tony counts the contraction.  Two syllables, for sure.  Eleven letters.  Tony can analyze Steve’s words in a lot of different ways.   It’s harder to turn them into meaning.
By ‘got us covered’ Steve had assumed Tony meant he had the keys to a rink somewhere. It hadn’t occurred to him in any way that Tony might have an ice rink at his mansion. Or that Tony would
And just like that, Bruce and Tony are off.  With the two of them working together they make short work of the rest of the printouts.  Which is just as well, because Bucky appears a few seconds before they finish the last sheet.
“For me, I don’t think much about the pain, but being stiff feels weird,” Clint tosses in. “My body’s pretty much the only company I have when I’m on a mission so I know exactly what every muscle’s supposed to do and if they don’t do it right, I don’t like it. Not because I can’t push through the pain but because it’s just not right. It’s off.”
Tony takes better note of the pictures of Bucky.  He looks about the same from year to year all the way through.  Like he was born handsome, and charming and put together right.  Lucky bastard.
He looks back at Steve (since throwing himself off the building is probably a little dramatic) and Steve’s fiddling with the strings of his hoodie and not making eye contact and looking vulnerable and sad.  In the six soul-sucking weeks they’ve spent in Bucky Barnes limbo, all the other times he’s seen Steve this somber it’s been on the video feed when Steve was alone.  In front of Natasha and Sam and Tony, Steve always stays strong.  But here, now, Steve’s letting that go.  The least Tony can do is give his question a shot.
He sounds confident but he looks unsure.  Tony gives his hand a tight squeeze and Steve looks down at him gratefully.  This is definitely a story Bruce wants to hear.  Later.
“That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard and I’ve sat through multiple congressional hearings.  Why really?”
“You should call him Bruce,” Tony says.  “And go talk to him next time you see him.  He’s a good guy.  He could use some friends.”
According to what Clint tells them later that night, the word translates to “Poltergeist who lives in the house and causes mischief and also grips your ankles with long spindly fingers in the middle of the night when you sleep barefoot.”
Steve takes a deep breath.  “Yes.  Affirmative.  Do it.  The video is a threat to the safety of the Avengers.”
It starts soft. Steve lets Tony lead and opens his mouth compliantly when Tony deepens the kiss. It never becomes rushed or urgent. Steve enjoys the warmth and absolute bliss of the intimate gesture, and then Tony pulls away.
Clint glances down forlornly at the egg on the floor.  “It does make me kind of hungry for eggs over easy.”
“Sexy any way you turn,” Bucky says, turning in his seat to wipe a smudge of dirt off Clint’s cheek.  There’s ten times as much dirt and debris in his hair, but that’s no doubt a lost cause.
Bruce can't help but admire that James picked up Clint's casually careful wording that had neglected to mention his thoughts on Tony. With every interaction it is more and more obvious that James is genius level smart. He'd have to be, really, to do the things he's done.
Even if they drag him out, there’s no stopping the flow of information now.  There’s no shutting down the press.  JARVIS is on it, and the truth is going to win the day.
Clint smacks Tony’s ass insistently and this time it’s Steve who gives Clint a friendly but deliberate shove.  And just like that, the last of the worries from the trunk fall away.  These are not murderers or kidnappers or criminal masterminds.  They are Tony’s ridiculous, impossible, friends.
“It was actually,” Tony says.  “Can’t really tell you what the rant was about since the Judgement Free Zone takes place within the Circle of Secrets, but I promise, it was epic.”
Steve hopes his smile says everything he’s thinking because he’s too choked up to speak for a second. Instead he just grabs Tony and pulls him close and hugs him tight.
The house is exactly what they need. Large, and full of light, with oddly angled rooms that allow for bay windows that manage not to give sightlines to the beds. Bruce can’t help but wonder if the house was originally built by people as paranoid as his ex-SHIELD agent friends.
“None of those people are you,” Tony says.  “Anyway, this isn’t going to work.  Even if it’s what we both want, I’m tainted.  Used goods.  There’s nothing left.”
This may be the first time Steve’s opened up without prompting, and Tony doesn’t miss what a big step that is.  But he does try to lighten the mood a little to get the look of sadness back off Steve’s face.
“I leaked the security footage of her singing Oops, I Did it Again at the office Christmas party,” Tony says.  “To Entertainment Tonight.”
“You broke Clint’s arm,” Clint counters. “You didn’t break Clint. Anyway, Bruce is the mother hen of this outfit. Don’t take that from him.”
Tony’s curled up on the floor in a corner, a mess of vomit on the tile next to him.  He’s sweaty, and grimy and he’s lost weight since Steve last saw him.  There’s more than one fading bruise on his jaw and he has dark circles under his eyes, either more bruises or just the effect of drinking like a fish for six weeks straight.  Despite the heat in sunny California, Tony’s wearing a long sleeved shirt.  Steve’s mind helpfully fills in exactly what that means.
Tony’s off to the side, his armor coated in blood. His mask is closed so Steve can’t see his face, but just by his stance, Steve knows something’s wrong. As soon as Nat is whisked away, Steve walks over to Tony and wraps both arms around him.
“Okay. You’re right,” Bruce sighs. “I’m just hoping he understands why we did what we did. He might have preferred us to let nature take its course.”
“Fine.  I know a little about art.  I liked that stupid painting with the stupid people eating their stupid potatoes.  I wrote the essay.  It won an award, did the professor tell you that?” Tony asks.  “And you know what my dad said when I invited him to the awards dinner?  That the ten minutes it took me to write that paper was time I was never going to get back.  That he’d be embarrassed to show up.  That art’s a waste, and I wasn’t going to get anywhere in life if I didn’t focus on what was important.  He wouldn’t even read it.”
Steve’s so stunned by her plea it takes him a few seconds to put together a response.  “Wait-- you think I’m here to talk about kicking Tony out of the Avengers?”
me, I won’t do it again.  I didn’t realize staples counted as company property, and we waited until everyone was gone before I made projectiles out of them.  Bucky helped me clean them all up and no
“I’m not saying we can’t do dinner,” Steve says.  “I’m just saying my preferred order of events starts with dessert.”
They continue until they’re both out of breath.  Steve aches with how much he wants this to go further.
Steve checks to make sure Tony is out of the tower before he heads over after Bruce has left for the night.  He’s not really sure where the best interface for Jarvis is, so he ends up sitting in the Avengers conference room on the 18th floor, well after midnight, feeling a bit like a child in the principal’s office.
“I lost my phone.” Bucky laughed, “I… for some reason remembered where you lived and your code to get in and I just couldn’t remember your number.  I couldn’t even remember my own sister’s number for Christ sakes.”
It was unacceptable for him to be doing it to Steve, again!  He wanted to take the blame, take it all away from Bucky so he wouldn’t have to live with it too.  Bucky tried to tell him before, things just don’t work that way.  He can’t look at Steve as he hears him crying.
When they would come to their makeshift hotel home after the appointments, Steve would always run around, taking care of dinner and the laundry.  He was waiting on Tony hand and foot.  Steve still had to keep bathing Tony to keep his stitches dry, but he really didn’t mind.
“I mean,” Bucky said a little bewildered by his comment, “I’m not really handsome with this.”  He held back his hair to expose his black eye completely.
Looking sympathetic, Steve told him “I sorry Tony, I can’t pinpoint a specific reason...take your time to process.  I’ll give you space and will just be better to you.  I feel like that’s all I can do.”  He chest tightened at Tony scoffed and stormed off toward his bedroom, grabbing 2 more bottles of liquor on the way.
He nodded, “Something I do when I can’t sleep.  I’ve been lifting Tony from time to time as well.”  “Have you been having bad dreams again?”
Tony made eye contact with Frank just as the man moved his gun to point it back at Tony’s head.  “Yeah, just got back.  Traffic was a nightmare.” he replied, managing to sound normal.
When Marco had originally sent him a message, he found out Bucky was in Brooklyn because Wanda and Natasha had tagged him at different restaurants in the area on Facebook.  Bucky had to tell them to stop doing that and take down the tags already in place.
Steve’s therapist had been trying to work on a plan of action with him to break the news to his boyfriend.  Dr. Banner had told him that what he was currently doing would seem as if he’d been buttering Tony up this whole time.  Steve didn’t see it that way, he just wanted his boyfriend to see that he was putting in effort in their relationship.
“I just have a feeling I am going to need something to hold onto.” he moaned, pulling Bucky into more smoldering kisses.
She kept her arms crossed and turned back around.  Of Course she was in a long red dress and heels with a black trench coat and her hair and makeup looked professionally done.
Steve smiled at the concern in his voice.  That was Tony’s natural state, always trying to be the most helpful person in existence.
“I don’t want you getting derailed with me while we ‘try to hang out like normal’, Steve.” Bucky said, sounding hurt and getting Steve to look at him again, “This shit isn’t normal.  We re-opened something that can’t be closed again.”  He continued, “Your boyfriend just got back from a week long trip and you’re here with me right now.”  Bucky finally met his gaze, “This...conversation could have waited.  You’re already prioritizing me over him.”
“We’re gonna fight this.  I can get you the best lawyer in New York.  They can’t do this just because we are in a relationship.”
Steve continued to cry and shook his head.  The brunette man scooted forward and hugged him tightly until his friend hugged back.
“Natasha called,” read the message, “I’m sorry to hear what happened.  You guys are all over the news at the bar tonight.  A person should never have to go through what you two did.  I would have been so upset if either of you didn’t make it and I am feeling so regretful in how I have let things go.  Maybe I could come talk to both of you and settle things.  Let me know when you are free.”
“What about your own therapist?  I know a ton here in the city.  I could even take care of the appointments for you.  How’s that sound?”
“Of course, darling.” Tony smiled, looking up from his tablet to kiss his boyfriend’s forehead.  “I was thinking of playing hooky today anyway.  You know I’ll always take care of you.”
“Oh God, the rats.” gagged Wanda.  “Yeah, I think rats are the state bird of New York.” joked Bucky.  “They can’t fly.” Happy scoffed/laughed.
“Bucky, you just need to have boundaries.  You don’t need to stay away from him anymore unless you honestly can’t trust yourself.”
That made a bright smile come over Steve’s face as he turned back around.  Tony was naked and opening the door to step into the shower behind him.  A small sigh escaped Steve’s chest as arms wrapped around his waist.  There was already an erection rubbing against Steve’s ass when his boyfriend’s chin rested on his shoulder.  “See how hard you make me?” Tony whispered.
“I love YOU too.” said Bucky in a passionate tone.  Steve was given a few more kisses before he laid his head back down on his pectoral pillow.
“You know how it goes.  The honeymoon phase,  you become obsessed with each other, it’s unavoidable.”
Tony took two out and sat them next to Steve’s head where he still lay on the couch.  The blonde man sat up slowly to eat them, his blanket still wrapped around his broad shoulders.
“Love making you fall apart, baby.” he said back in a low voice.  Tony leaned down to take the hands off of Steve’s cock.  Without hesitation, he dip his head down to start sucking off his lover.
“They can trust me.  I don’t slip up because that would be too embarrassing and they’d probably fire me for drinking on the job.  Keeps me on my best behaviour.  Also I enjoy hanging out and talking to people.  I meet a lot of interesting strangers that way.  I love that.”  Bucky smiled fondly, sipping his tea and sitting it on the coffee table.
Tony and he had grabbed a ton of them that week so he could start packing his apartment away at his leisure.
“Alright.  I can feel myself crashing already…so I’ll go ahead.”  said Bucky, walking toward the bedroom down the hall.
“I’m not applicable.” Frank told them, seeming embarrassed as well as irritated, “Recently got put in M&D.”
“Listen, Frank, you haven’t done anything wrong yet.” tried Tony, “The only thing you have done is scare an entitled rich man.  Judging from our conversation we had at the party, you’re a smart guy.  I would be willing to forget all about this and erase my camera footage if you want to just leave right now.”
“I thought you were interested in Nat.  She told me she invited you to hang out.  You guys seem to be hitting it off.”
Steve arrived home around noon.  He went straight to his bedroom to grab some dirty towels when he realized Bucky was in the bathroom with the door cracked slightly.
Bucky let out an exasperated huff and tipped his head to the side to lean it on the couch.  “Knew this was coming.”
“What?” Tony asked someone else in the background, “Yeah, alright.  Babe, I got to go but I love you.”
Steve bit his lip and stared at his phone, feeling like he had tunnel vision and was trapped in a bubble with all the oxygen sucked out.
Scott’s phone rang right after that.  It was his ex wife and she asked him if he could pick up his daughter early.  He agreed and apologized before taking off.
Steve subtly looked at his boyfriend when he said that.  It sounded more like an accusation than a compliment.
Wanda had just started chewing some dip on a cracker, “It really is!”  Her words were muffled by the food.
“I think this ordeal with the crazy stalker has made them see things differently.  Just give it a shot to talk to them.”
Rhodey gave him an uneasy look, like he was questioning his friend’s logic for the hundredth time in their lives.  Tony told him “Steve’s taking great care of me, of the situation with our penthouse, everything.  We had to replace giant windows, get bullet fragments taken, and blood cleaned from my home.  We’ve been through something traumatic, and I know you remember that something like that brings people closer.”
Steve nodded and rested his head on his hand as he watched him start to prepare rice in a separate pot.
.  Needed that big cock.”  He whimpered the last sentence, hearing Tony growl in response.  The older man was a sucker for hearing his boyfriend make those sounds.
Steve was listening to a sad Sia song from his headphones that were so loud it could be heard from a small distance.  He was leaning against a wall next to a tower of his moving boxes, staring down at an old photo album in his hands.
He also meets with Sam every morning once again even though he lives over 40 minutes away from their football field.
“What if I get hungry?” asked Steve playfully, putting his phone on silent and dropping it on the coffee table.
Steve got flustered for a second and dropped his chopsticks.  He paused then took a sip of his water.  “I have anti-anxiety and sleeping pills...for my panic attacks and nightmares.  That’s all.”
Strong hands cupped Steve’s red face, “No, you aren’t.”  The older man’s face looked hurt but still concerned with his boyfriend’s feelings.
The angle hurt Steve’s neck, so he moved them to stand and face each other and kiss deeply.  Tony shook his head and looked him over, “You’re so fucking sexy.  I can’t even take it.”  Steve smiled and kissed him again, “You’re the sexy one.”
Steve was still talking and sobbing but Tony had zoned out and didn’t hear what he was saying.  It was like he had tunnel vision as he stared right past Steve’s face.
Steve passed his friend a full mug and they drank silently.  He placed the cooked bacon on two plates then went to the fridge for eggs.
“I’m so happy I’ve spent the last few years with a sweet, young, gorgeous soldier like you.” Tony told him.
Steve finished his meal in silence, cleaned up, and got dressed.  The whole time he cried silently.  He didn’t want Bucky to be upset with him.  He didn’t want what they had to be over.  It felt too good, too necessary for the both of them.
After a while of uncomfortable silence, Steve said “I don’t want to pretend like it never happened.”  He kept eating.
Bucky went to play a few rounds of his favorite video game with Scott online.  By the time he was finished, Marco was already on his way back.
“Right now?  That’s what we need to do?” Tony huffed.  “Who?” Steve asked, looking back and forth between the two of them.
A small smile appeared on Bucky’s lips, “Yea this little 8 ounces of coffee is going to help with being awake for 26 hours.”
The next morning, after his run with Sam, Steve went home to shower then packed up office boxes to bring to Tony's place.
Steve got up from the couch and closed the door behind Tony as he walked into the kitchen.  “Need any help, babe?” he asked.
Steve looked apologetic and nodded.  Bucky straightened up and continued, “Wanda needed a date to her cousin’s wedding.  She said she couldn’t find anyone else to go with.  When I agreed, we started to chat more and got to know each other.  Then we started to have impromptu dates.  It’s in the early stages but we are having a good time.  I mean, yeah, becoming Facebook official so soon was definitely her idea but...I don’t mind.  I like her.”  He kept his face neutral.
“Steve,” Bucky said, “I think you should do a little investigating of your own.  See who might have it in for you.”
Squeezing the lube onto his hand, the brunette man reached gentle fingers down to Steve’s hole.  The noises his muscular blonde boyfriend was making made Tony smile and add more fingers one at a time.
“I uh…” said Bucky, “I need to get ready for work.”  He stood and hurried out of the room to his own bedroom.
“If you guys had gotten…snuffed out, and we hadn’t resolved this…or even talked.” sobbed Bucky, “I’ve just been going crazy thinking about this whole...catastrophe.”
Tony settled his underwear covered cock in the dip of Steve’s hip and just pressed firmly and pulsed like he was desperate.
“Good.” nodded Rhodey.  The two of them could hear Carol and Steve giggling about the size of all the closets.  “I just have been worried about you, Tones.  I’m worried that you are letting go of the problems you guys were having because of this-”
Bucky opens the door, says he’s sorry and heads inside.  Steve follows him, sobbing “Buck, please.  Why are you doing this?”
Happy brought his poker table a few times and played a few games with the three men and his girlfriend, May.
Last Steve heard Bucky had moved into the suburbs of Buffalo with an Italian girlfriend of his.  He never judged Bucky’s actions or mistakes, he told his best friend he would always be there if he needed help and he meant it.
Tony was straddling him kissing down Steve’s chest, taking his time and pushing his ass against the hard cock leaking behind him.
Natasha always dressed so flashy when she went out since she was a confident, single woman in New York City that had to wear camouflage to work every day.
“You wanna do that RIGHT now?” frowned Tony, “I was gonna call a brunch spot for a rezzy.  I thought we were spending the day together.”
“I’ll talk to him,” Clint agrees.  He shifts up a little and takes out his wallet before pulling out a five dollar bill and handing it to Steve.  “Go buy yourself a milkshake, kid.  I hear the Hawkeye is a best seller.  Uncle Clint will make it all better.”
“Okay,” Steve says. “Yes. As long as it doesn’t involve watching my team play hockey without me, I’m in.”
Tony knows better than to think Hammer values any of their lives.  He just knows when to roll over.  Honestly, it’s all the man knows.
James doesn’t agree; he does nod though, and there’s something pleased about his expression.  It’s obvious he enjoys anyone shit-talking his ex-imprisoners.
He grabs a marker from a drawer and a piece of paper Steve had laid out for sketching. Bucky prints HI JENNY! GO WILDCATS! on it then turns it toward Steve.
Sean’s drunk and maybe plain stupid, because he gives the table a shove toward Steve, and it topples over glasses and a few bottles as it comes to an abrupt stop at the wall that is Steve Rogers’ abs.
Finally James is stable enough for Bruce and Sam to step away to change into clean shirts, stamped with SI across the chest, and to use the sink and the soap to wash up. Bruce figures he’ll be smelling blood for days.
Bruce isn’t sure if James is having a flashback or searching for the right words, but he’s gotten to know James well enough by now that he recognizes it as one or the other.
Tony tilts his head like he doubts Steve’s sincere.  When he decides that Steve is, he places the mug down on the table, turns his hand over, palm up, and holds it out insistently.  Steve sits down next to Tony on the bench and takes his hand. He’s careful to be gentle as he presses down and begins to knead.  It’s impossible to resist smoothing his thumb over a few of Tony’s  callouses, but otherwise Steve keeps it professional.
Bruce lifts his head to object on James’s behalf then realizes he doesn’t have a better suggestion. Where else are they going to go?
“I don’t need the help,” Steve says, in a long-suffering way that doesn’t quite hide the smile in his tone.
“If you talk to Steve, tell him maybe I’ll see him when I wake up,” James says. “If he can keep from getting himself killed between now and then.”
They’re as confused as Steve is.  Steve hasn’t heard anything about Reno. (Now that he’s ditched the Morning Shows, he’s perpetually behind on gossip.)  He’s definitely not noticed any panic attacks, though he’ll be watching for them now.
In the process of searching for the fire extinguisher he comes across the electrical box, and that at least is a way he can contribute that no one else has considered.  It takes Tony less than five minutes to have the power output into and out of the house regulated in a way that’s safer and that ought to prevent any imminent fires.
“It was a prototype,” Nanna says.  “My husband always said Howard was ahead of the pack.  And the things Howard said about you--”
It’s his fifth or sixth Sunday in a row, and the holiday crowds have Steve shoved off to one corner, trying to remain inconspicuous.  It’s there he ends up next to a fancy gold plaque that reads:
Tony lays awake at night waiting for Rogers or Romanoff to call. He’s got so many connections. He can pull so many strings. He would do-- could do-- whatever it took-- if they would just
“I never knock good intentions,” Clint says. “They’re rarer than you think.  You didn’t really get to know Phil, but sometimes you remind me of him. He was always good at this stuff. He put up with me, when I don’t think anyone in their right mind would’ve. I was a mess back then-- well, more of a mess. Phil just had this way about him that made me trust things could be okay.”
Rhodey’s concern is all it takes to break Tony. At least he’s alone in his hotel room where a breakdown isn’t going to cause him any trouble. Isn’t going to fuck things up. And Rhodey’s the only one who hears Tony cry.
James doesn’t respond. He’s distracted by his reflection in the window.  He runs his skin-covered fingers carefully over his hair. He looks troubled.
For the first week, they don’t talk about Tony. Clint just shows up at random times, with food or coffee and whatever else he thinks might cheer Steve up.
“If all my consent questions are bothering you, I’ll knock it off,” Bruce says. “Just let me know if anything I do makes you uncomfortable and I’ll step away.”
“The damage to your knee is internal,” Bruce says, keeping to simple terms to try and help James identify with the words and put together that his knee belongs to him. “Your knee is bruised and swollen. I’d like to press there gently to see if I can tell what’s going on. Is that okay?”
Clint moves out of the way so James can take over with the scanner unpacking then nabs a pancake off the plate where Bruce is loading them up.  He rolls it into a cigar shape and shoves it in his mouth.
James is being clear with his wants so it’d be rude to second-guess. Bruce hangs the IV bag of nutrition on a nearby hook and attaches the pump before using an alcohol swab to wipe the skin along James’s collarbone. He’s done this a few times before, and that was with far less sophisticated equipment. That doesn’t mean Bruce isn’t nervous.  Thankfully the whole rig is set up in under two minutes, and then all that’s left is to wait for the liquid to enter James’s system and do its job. That doesn’t take long either, and by the time the pump beeps to let Bruce know the process is finished, Clint is asleep and James seems well and truly distracted by the Tom and Jerry cartoon playing on the wall.
The faceplate lowers. Tony looks uncertain, but not like he’s going to run. He reaches out and takes Steve’s hand in his own.
Bruce nods, with a self-assuredness he doesn’t feel. “Nat, take us to Clint’s coordinates.  We’ll make it work.”
A part of Bruce wants to step in. To spare Tony from this pain when he hears the stress in his friend’s voice. Except Tony is a big boy. He knows how to walk out a door if being near James is too much. Bruce glances back down at his StarkPad, checks over the readings JARVIS has taken over the last 11 hours and doesn’t interfere. From the chair in the corner, Clint seems incredibly interested in his gun.
“Okay-- I guess you did.  But that’s not on you, it’s on me.  I don’t know how to do this.  And everything I read makes it ten times worse.  The ways they hurt him...”
It’s nice though. Nice that it’s his own face and not the Other Guy.  Nice that Tony’s renamed them for him.  Nice to have a friend.
The rest of the evening passes peacefully enough. None of them are great at resting but after weeks of being away from comfort, Bruce is content to wedge himself into a corner of the sofa and catch up on world news.  Clint’s after dinner run produced a hoodie pocket full of finds-- a couple knives, a compass, a burner phone, a dozen packs of gum.  He and James sit at the table and clean the knives and dissect the burner phone for some purpose Bruce can’t quite suss out.
Steve sits down on the edge of Tony’s desk and his posture has relaxed.  “I don’t think Pepper’s going anywhere because you can tell a Monet from a Manet.”
“I know what you’re doing, Tony,” Thor declares.  “And while my egg is far more worthy than yours, I will not test it until Yolki and I have won the day.”
Steve’s never pictured this conversation going particularly well so he’s unfazed by Tony’s less than enthusiastic reception.
“I’ll give you your privacy,” Steve says, standing up.  He’s not leaving the tower.  He’s not leaving the vicinity of the door.  “I’ll be right outside if you need anything.”
Steve’s not sure what to say.  “I didn’t... I mean, it’s not like the words gold digger occurred to me exactly... What are you even going to buy me?  An island?  I don’t want an island.  I want you.  You’re enough.”
Tony cocks his head. It’s a little weird Steve can rattle off an escape path like that off the top of his head.
And Tony doesn’t even mind the (totally inaccurate) description of his food-search, since Steve seems less miserable than he’s seemed in forever.
“It was great,” Steve says slowly.  “I mean.  Except for the dialogue.  And the plot.  And the 42 minutes of my life I’m never getting back.”
Tony’s not concerned about the early hour.  It’s pretty common knowledge Tony rarely leaves the building.  It’s just people might want to talk to him and Pepper’s made him swear on every car in his garage that he will not have any new sexual harassment complaints aimed at him this year.  And he very much likes those cars.  Also (and he gets defensive here, even if it’s just in his own head) those complaints aren’t usually his fault.  Obadiah had been in charge of hiring for a long time, and a lot of those asshole hires were still around, and either corporate spies or lawsuits waiting to happen.  Combine that with Tony’s less-than-stellar reputation, and voila!  Trouble.
They stare at each other defiantly, so similar in expression they’re like a mirror and a reflection.  It’s James who breaks his scowl first and when he speaks, his voice is steady and low.
Tony did this to Bruce.  Made him sound hurt like this.  All because he was too much of a coward to tell Bruce the truth and risk the rejection of Bruce choosing not to come to New York even if Tony needed him.  And now Tony needed to fix this.
Steve must take it as permission to do more, because he ghosts his hand over Tony's shoulder, then down his arm, before Steve puts his arm around him entirely and settles his hand on Tony's stomach.  He tugs him back a little so Tony can rest against him.
It’s early.  Early enough that Tony should still be sleeping, but he’d woken up from a troubled dream and the sight of Steve next to him made him want to stay awake.  To observe in the quiet of pre-dawn, this absolutely breathtaking view that for the moment is Tony’s alone.
“Shit, shit I’m sorry,” Bruce cuts James off with an embarrassingly frantic set of hand flailing. “You’re not doing anything wrong. That’s exactly right, actually. But please don’t continue, with the starting from the beginning and the... me, bits. I can’t.... with my family history.”
“Call me Pepper,” she says with a cautious smile.  “And you should keep them, Captain Rogers.  Howard wanted you to have them.”
Steve’s ridiculously easy to talk to and seems content to let Tony ramble on about things he and Bruce have accidentally blown up in the lab and about Dum-E and U, too, and all the terrible things they try to put in his smoothies.  Steve listens and laughs and asks a question now and then.
The team’s gone out for a drink on their night off. Tony’s team is out of town in Orlando. It was an afternoon game so by 8, Tony’s blowing up Steve’s phone.
“He’s a looker,” Steve says with a shrug. “And he was nice to me. It doesn’t take a lot more than that these days.”
“You said as much in the conference room,” Steve says. “When you were dating what’s-her-name. The professor. We were talking about bondage. You said you knew I’d be boring in bed.”
“The old-fashioned way,” Steve says.  By his smile, Tony can tell he approves.  +10 points (Tony’s secret points) for not fucking up the first conversation of the night.
Clint reaches down to help with one hand and Bruce digs through his bag for the scanner. Not that he’s sure it will help. Not that he even knows what he’s looking for, but it’s the best they’ve got.
“I think what we’re all trying to say is that if you want to be left alone, we’ll leave you alone,” Bruce says. “And if you don’t want to be left alone, that’s okay too.”
The Science Squad has totally achieved their Fourth of July aspirations.  Soil, rock and chemical clouds go red, white and
Bruce, Clint and Bucky are on the move.  Tony and Steve try to keep busy in New York.  It's not a great day for anyone.
“I bought her things,” Tony says.  “It didn’t work for her and it definitely isn’t going to work for Steve. He won’t even let me pay for his gas to drive up here or split the cost of his hotel room.”
It doesn’t really matter-- it will take too long. James will die before Bruce gets him to an operating table, and honestly he has no clue where he’d even start. Bruce is watching blood ebb and flow and leak in the hologram. It pools around a twisted, jumble of metal and wires and tech. What isn’t obviously man-made is being compromised by a healing ability that’s repairing what it can in all the wrong ways.
“I would ruin you,” Tony says.  He sounds terribly sad and entirely sure.  “I take good people, and I break them, remember?”
Once they’re finished with lunch, Nat and Clint leave their place-mat-weapon sketches behind and Steve pockets them without them seeing.
That's a big part of why Tony rarely leaves the safety of his lab or office.  Pepper's been weeding Obie’s people out since the board ousted the man in the spring but it’s a slow process.
Not that not having a phone would stop Tony if he really wanted to speak to Steve. He could probably make one out of an old shoe and some fishing wire. This is better though. The rules are in place for a reason.
“I’m not a fan of shooting coma patients,” Sam argues.  “Give me a second to make sure I don't hit anything that I just fixed.”
It's a rare thing for Tony to find the scale of a problem overwhelming-- he's always been good at dissecting a situation and then solving it in the fewest moves necessary.  It's probably telling that a possible crush on Steve is somehow a more difficult state of affairs for Tony than an armored space whale or Feolin's Unsolved Theor--
“You never met your father and your mother was a saint,” Tony says, rolling his eyes.  “Tell me something I don’t know.”
It’s been weeks (months? years?) since Tony woke up feeling so rested.  Which is odd, since when he blinks open his eyes he’s on the couch.
“Eh, if I stopped hanging out with people who I’m 100% sure won’t kill me I’d be down to my dog... and maybe Steve. Maybe.” Clint gives it a second more of thought then shrugs. “I guess that’s all to say, I’m not too worried. I know you’ve got my back. What’s he like?”
Bruce is sure it doesn’t help that he and Sam are stained with blood. They’d scrubbed off what they could but without a shower they can only get so clean.
“Did you even write this?” Steve asks.  He’s still gripping the paper, and he looks so annoyed Tony’s forced to take the question seriously.
“Do you ever think about-- I-- mean...” Tony trails off because he knows logically Jarvis doesn’t ever think about Mr. Jarvis or Ana and that’s what he was going to ask.  His AI doesn’t connect to those events or emotions.  In terms of fond memories, Tony is entirely alone.  “Nothing.”
Tony’s boyfriend is called Sean and he’s a personal trainer to the rich and famous.  Sean is tall and blonde and muscular, and Steve doesn’t fail to notice they could be cousins, as far as looks go.  He hopes that’s where the similarities end because Sean’s an ass.  Steve
That got Steve to stare back at his friend again, looking worried and on the verge of tears.  "That was a long time ago."
They were sleeping in the same bed on occasion, but definitely were not having sex.  They weren’t being playful nor physically affectionate.
“I mean, this is it, who are you looking-...” Tony smiled, “Wait, I know you.  We met before at uh...Natasha’s party right?”
Immediately as they were seated, a waiter came by and filled their glasses with water.  He also  placed a plate down containing a sliced loaf of french bread and whipped butter.  Tony ordered a fine bottle of red wine for the table.
“Oh!  You’re Bucky!”  Sam said, looking over his prosthetic arm, “I’ve heard SO much about you.  I just like...I didn’t get who you were at first because Steve said your name was James.”
A pleasant shudder rippled through Steve when he felt the soft tongue begin to lick him open as soon as he stopped talking.  He forgot how much Bucky liked to talk dirty.
Steve felt uncomfortable still, like he had a front row seat to his friend’s heart being broken.  He just wanted to make it all better for him.
Steve was sitting at the dining table with his laptop open in front of him.  He was crying and a half empty glass of scotch sat next to his hand.
Marco always picked up on it, “Well don’t you?  Isn’t this okay?  I was staring at that dining table the whole time I was here and I couldn’t help but notice it was the perfect height for getting fucked on.”
Marco giggled, “I know.  I didn’t think this meant we were...whatever again.  I mean, I just changed my life path.  I am definitely not stable enough for something serious right now either.”
When Bucky pulled back, he kissed up Steve’s spine.  The arm Steve was using to hold the other man’s head dropped down and slipped his shirt off.
They just became friends on Facebook, no doubt that is where he got that picture he was jerking it to.
Tony sighed, “Okay...I’m going to get a bath.  I need to be alone.” He gets up from the bed and grabs a bottle of Johnny Walker to take with him.  As Tony stepped into the bathroom he could hear Steve cry again.  He forced himself not to pause or look back, shutting the door behind him.
Tony stopped making out with him to pull back and moan while squeezing the muscular man by his pecs. "My God, you feel so good."
“I need to make time for all my friends.” said Bucky, patting his knee, “Okoye has been asking me to go dancing with her for forever and Scott has been talking to me about baseball fantasy teams for next season.  Wanda and I said we would take things slow so that’s what we should do.  Maybe slow it down more.”
“That sounds fucking delicious.” groaned Tony pleasantly, looking up at his boyfriend, “You have to make that for me later.”
“Neither?” He paused for a second, “Remember how I said he was here because he got out of a bad living situation?  It was an abusive relationship.  He ran from it and he literally had to start a new life.”
After Steve came into his lovers wanting mouth, Tony fucked him into oblivion.  He was slow and teasing and passionate, making sure the blonde, younger man knew how much he cared about his pleasure.
“She’s nice.” said Bucky, “I am being nice to her because she’s friends with you and Nat is actively trying to be my friend too.  I wouldn’t hook up with her and do that to you.”
Before he could react, Tony was staring at a gun in Frank’s right hand, pointed at Tony’s stomach.  Frank calmly told him, “We’re going to go inside now, Mr.Stark.  We’re going to wait for your boyfriend.”
Other than it taking about an hour for all parties involved to show up for the meeting, it was pretty quick and painless.  Before his boyfriend dropped such a heavy bomb on him, Tony would have gone with his first plan and taken the hit in his business in order to indulge him.  Now, some of that high regard to Steve’s feelings had disintegrated.
Steve could lie to himself but he knew why he gave in to Bucky.  Other than their undeniable leftover feelings, Steve remembered that he would give it to him rough and dirty, something Tony was really hesitant to do.
Afterward, they washed up in the bathroom and got dressed.  They sat on the couch together and cracked open some bottles of root beer.
The photo handed to Steve was one of the two of them at 15 at a System of a Down concert.  Their outfits were awful and what could only be described as "New Jersey punk".
Steve shook out of his daze and finally looked up at the lady waving her hand at him.  “Sorry, what?”
“I don’t think anyone cares much about what I'm doing.  The family kind of...disowned me after that night.”
“You did.” Steve said pleasantly, “We are all still alive, including yourself.  You won a metal, you lost an arm.  It was selfless and brave.”
The two men arrived at the nightclub and there was a small line out the front door.  They walked up confidently to the bouncer and he surprisingly ushered them closer to put paper bracelets on their wrists and take their cash for the door cover.
The sensation forced Steve tighter around Tony, making him thrust harder.  “Oh baby, are you trying to make me cum already?”  he asked with a breathy, heavy voice.  “Mmm,” hummed Steve happily, “want to feel you burst in me.”  He smirked as he looked over his shoulder.  Tony was giving him an astounded yet dark look, like Steve was going to punch the orgasm out of him by just using his words.
Without seeming phased, Tony replied, “Oh c’mon, that’s nothing.  You still are very good looking.  If anything, it makes you look more tough and distinguished.”
“You’re admitting it NOW of all times and you still haven’t actually said it.” Steve said, twisting his body to face him and wipe the tears from his cheeks.
“You know what?  You’re right.” said Bucky, pulling out his phone and doing just that.  However, when he deleted the messages, he accidentally dialed his number.
“I’m still sorry...for a lot of things, but especially if I caused your family to disown you.” Bucky told him.  They held eye contact firmly.
The hand pinching his forehead dropped, “It’s not just because of you, your sister had something to do with it.  She wants me dead.  We BOTH fucked up.  I’m sure your whole family knows about us and hates me by now.”
Of Course Tony was able to charm the pants off of Steve.  When they met, he was immediately flirting with the devastatingly beautiful blonde man.  Then Tony started taking him to many fancy dinner dates since his pay grade was a bit higher than Steve’s.
With a few knocks, Tony let himself in.  He was holding 2 large brown paper bags, “Buongiorno boys!  I’ve got lasagna and chicken parm!”  Bucky was in the kitchen drinking water and smirking through the open space above the bar.
Steve shrugged, “I suppose.  It is pretty cool having a concierge service that will do all our dry cleaning here.  Also there is room service if we wish.”
After an hour of cuddling and watching the show together, Steve got a text from Bucky.  He immediately opened it to read it with Tony.
“Could I get a tour?” Carol asked Steve excitedly.  “Sure.” he laughed, leading her down the other hall toward the bedroom.
The truth was Steve had been sending him a message every other day asking to check on him.  Bucky still only ever replied with one curt sentence.  He knew Steve would keep sending messages because he was trying to start an honest conversation, but Bucky just couldn’t let that happen.
They once again turned their attention to the TV.  Steve became deep in thought.  Tony once again noticed him stiffen and asked if he was alright.
“I don’t think we have been here since 6 years ago, remember?” asked Bucky, “It was Halloween and there was that horror drag queen pageant.”
Tony’s face was calm and content.  When he realized Steve was staring, he looked over at him amused “What?”
“Alright, explain that to me because I thought legally they can’t do anything to you if you are gay…”
Bucky had hung out with Wanda on occasion but didn’t know her that well.  He saw no harm so he said “Why not?  See what she’s up to.”  It was nice and refreshing for him, and kept his mind off darker things.
“I would have considered it.” came Tony’s solemn voice, “If you’d have called me, we could have had a discussion.  I probably would have given you my blessing.  No one would have gotten hurt.”
“I know.  I already called my boss and he is making sure I won’t have to come in until later next week.  I was thinking of leaving Sunday since it’s a 12 hour long drive.”
That was it.  They would talk about it.  He’d have to tell Tony that he was going over there too.  With a sigh, he took off the rest of his clothes and stepped under the hot water.  Steve closed his eyes and just breathed, letting the tension roll out of his shoulders.  The stiffness was from being hunched over the kids' short art tables all day.
While they were half-watching a show and saving different therapists’ websites, Tony kept staring at the sadness still very prominent in Steve’s eyes.  “Other than fronting the bill, is there anything else I can do?” he asked.
After Steve had spent the next few weeks doing a great job at NOT coming clean to Tony, but also doing some self reflection and soul searching, (mainly with his therapist) he’d noticed sometimes he would get pains in his chest.
“Yeah, pretty much.  He just got a bigger one as a gift so, anyway, now all I need is like a sweet TV to mount on the wall.  We could start playing games together online from your penthouse.” smiled Bucky.
“So, check it out,” Bucky said excitedly, nodded over toward his coworker behind him, “Scott is selling his xbox one and I told him I wanted it, he’s practically giving it to me, it’s so cheap.”
They decided to meet up on a weekday when Bucky had the night off.  Pepper arranged an unmarked car to pick him up and take him in the hotel through the garage.
Bucky told him “You just came up to me so effortlessly.  I was unable to talk to anyone until you taught me how.”
“Medium black coffee please.” Steve replied, sliding her $5 and telling her to keep the change as she slid the beverage to him.
“Get out of here.  I’ll be fine.” said Tony, “I’ll have a bodyguard right here in my bed.”  He squeezed Steve’s beefy bicep.
Steve pouted up at her and shook his head.  “Alright,” she said, standing up, “let’s get you up these steps.  Do you think you can take ‘em one at a time?”
The couple situated themselves so that Tony was leaning against the arm rest and Steve was sort of laying on him.
"I wanted to take care of you, Buck.  I wanted us to take care of each other, which, by the way, we’re kind of doing anyway."
It looked like Steve was just shaken out of his thoughts, “I know, I only care about you.”  Bucky pursed his lips, “Yes, but I’m officially telling you that you have to let me take care of myself.”
As Steve opened the door for them, Rhodey gasped at the sight of how big of a black eye Steve was still sporting.  “Yeah,” Steve laughed, “I actually have multiple bruises healing at different rates.  The doctor said the discoloration was normal.”
“He’s had a bullet go through him.  We have to keep it covered for a day before he gets stitched up.” he told her, looking at Tony sympathetically.
Bucky made eye contact with his best friend, “I’m somewhere safe.  Safe as I will ever be.  Unless your uncle is hunting me down.”  He propped his phone on the arm of the couch.
As Steve went in there to turn it off, his boyfriend followed him, the blanket wrapped around his shoulders like a cape.
With a huff, Steve threw his head back and bit his lip.  Whines were punched out of Steve as Tony began to thrust the toy against his prostate, stretching him even more at the same time.
“It’s okay, Stevie.” said Bucky softly,  “This will probably end up being nothing.  Don’t let them scare you into giving up.”
“You know what’s happening.” laughed Steve bitterly, wiping his face again, daring to look back at him.
Steve was able to get back on a work out schedule with Sam again since he moved back closer to him.  Sam had helped his friend find community centers that needed art teachers and he volunteered for every one of them, filling up most of his week.
“Sounds great, honey.” he smiled, kissing his cheek down to his neck, “Who were you thinking about inviting?”
Steve was leaning toward him listening intensely.  He bit his lip and felt his chest ache for his friend.
Shakily, the other man admitted he was terrified.  “We are just starting the next step in our relationship.  In therapy, I figured out that I probably did it because of the bomb dropped on me about work and he was there to comfort me.  I know that’s not the greatest reason, I mean, there was obvious tension there from before.”  Steve’s voice cracked as he said “It will never happen again.”
Steve kept on his t-shirt but changed into his tight, black “fuck me” jeans that hugged his ass sinfully.
With a nod, Steve looked around their penthouse and said “This place seems huge now doesn’t it?”  Tony did the same then smiled up at him, “Yeah it does.  Too huge.  Maybe we should just get a whole new place.”
He was afraid she would fall, so Bucky leaned back and said playfully, “Wait, wait!  Hold on!  Stay there.”  He ran around the bar to the other side and swiveled her around on her stool to hug her properly.
He noticed his hands were in a more relaxed position around Steve’s neck.  The bigger man’s hands were resting on Bucky’s hips.
When Bucky got up to the smell of toast, eggs, and bacon, he sauntered happily over to Steve at the stove to kiss his neck from behind.  “Morning, punk.” he whispered.  Both of them stood in their underwear.
“Well,” started Steve, fixing his hair, “what if I told you that you didn’t need to find your own place right away and you could stay right here?”
“You know the original intention was to stay here temporarily.  It seems like I’d be better off starting fresh somewhere.”
“I guess that’s hard since you guys have a history.” Tony said, as if they were discussing another guy that
The next Saturday afternoon, a football game was on at Bucky’s apartment and he had Natasha and Scott over to watch it.  As soon as Natasha got up to get more beer, Scott started to whisper to him.  “What should I talk to her about when she comes back?”
Freezing up, Tony clutched the small package to his chest.  His eyes scanned the street.  The traffic was too far down the street and there really was no one around.
Steve had dropped down to squat in front of him and smile, “What’re you doing here, Buck?  It’s been a while since I last heard from you.”
“Ah fuck, honey…”Steve sobbed, “I feel so awful.  I can’t even begin to say how sorry I am.  I have been taking forever to unpack my stuff because I was worried you would kick me out.  I mean...do you want me to leave?  It’s okay if you do.”
He managed to give Tony a gentle sponge bath and dry him off before re-doing his bandage and tying the robes on both of them.  Pepper showed up with their duffle bags not long after.  They joined her in the living room.  She’d gotten both of their medications as well.
Tony propped himself up on his elbows, hovering on top of Steve.  “Okay...I just want this process to go a little faster.  Even if there is something I can do to speed it up, I will.”
“It’s okay, babe.  I’m glad you’re here now.” whispered Tony, almost sounding so comfy that it was putting him to sleep.
“No, just very drunk.” she smiled, “Also, wouldn’t want to wake up Tony right now with noise, do we?”
After they had their food delivered and ate it, the two men settled back into their relaxing activities.  Steve started a trashy reality show but wasn’t really paying attention.  He felt the arm around him, the man attached to it mindlessly stroking his hand back and forth on his shoulder.
When he walked out in his long sleeve shirt and pajama pants, he was surprised to find the man still sleeping on the couch.  His blanket had been kicked off below his thighs and tight calvin klein boxer briefs exposed.  (As well as his perfect apple shaped ass.)
“You saved my life.” assured Tony against his mouth, “Even when I’ve been callous and cold to you lately.”
Bucky rolled out of bed and started to stretch when he heard a text come through.  It made noise, so it couldn’t be from he-who-must-not-be-thought-about.
When he was finished, Bucky crumpled up the paper bag and grabbed his coffee.  The brunette man already had his shoes on and he was heading to the door, “Just lock up when you leave.”
Steve even felt a little more relaxed coming home to someone after work.  It was less lonely, even if Bucky would mostly take off at about 9pm.
As he stared at Steve’s flushed face, searching for discomfort he had shown earlier, Bucky couldn’t find any.
“I can’t right now!  I’ll ruin his focus for his presentation.” said Steve, “I mean, eventually they will probably call him in for an interview.”
Finally Steve’s eyes met his and he kept his face soft, “I don’t think that.  I want to help you.  I can get you a job, and I’m sure Tony can help get you a place to stay.  Whatever you need.”
“Is that right?” asked Tony, looking him over, “It’s probably because you’re so handsome and you make people impressionable.”
Mentally, Steve said goodbye to that expression on his man’s face.  It might be a while before he sees it again.
After Steve straightened himself out, he brushed his teeth and Tony undressed him.  They got into bed and Steve passed right out.
As Sam and Steve collapsed against the base of a tree outside the football field, they tried to calm their breathing as they swigged from their water bottles.
Steve nodded and started to pour the freshly brewed coffee.  “Drunk me only ever thinks about food.”
That night when he showed up to work, Bucky's hair was up in a bun and he was wearing his usual vest but with a t-shirt.  He was a little disheveled.
Tony put his hands on his hips, “Was this about the whole rough fetish thing?  The thing that I can’t seem to do right?  Was I just not good enough at all, or just not there at that minute?”
“I’ll see you at home in about 2 hours or so.” said Bucky, walking backwards to get back behind the bar.
A small smile appeared on Steve’s lips when he looked to his left at the man, “You need a play by play?”
Steve pouted and looked him over in sympathy.  “You don’t have to do everything on your own, Buck.”  “Well, Natasha has actually been talking to me.  Apparently she already knew about what happened.”
“If everything has been going well,” Natasha says, watching him stack books on a shelf, “why are you so upset?”
The waitress returned with a few bowls, spoons, and a giant pot of soup.  They served themselves and began to slurp down the rest of their dinner.
“No it’s not!” he whined, uncovering his face, “I have a boyfriend, Buck!  I care about him. I don’t know why I let myself drink that much that fast.  I know how I act and I fucking know my limits!”
Without another word, Tony started to dip down to his knees.  Steve’s breath caught at the sight, especially since his cock was still hard and red, standing straight up.  When Tony leaned his face closer, it was almost as big as his entire head.  He gave a few gentle long licks up the shaft, causing Steve to sigh and stare down at him with his jaw hanging open.
