“But not everybody’s here yet,” Happy suddenly comments before anybody can drink. Tony lowers his hand again, giving Happy a questioning look.
After looking at Strange for a few times, who is giving him a funny look, Peter turns to a stumbling Bruce Banner. Then he points at him, trying to say his name despite his mouth being closed. He’s probably shaking to much, because there’s nothing coming from Tony. Peter hurries towards Dr. Banner and grabs him by the arm, pointing towards his face.
“Steve Rogers, I know It’s been so long. I know you probably thought it wouldn’t happen anymore. But I love you. And you love me. We’re two old people who love each other, grey and wrinkled and-“
Peter’s aware that Tony’s bringing the Fantastic Four up to date, as well as the X-Men. That’s good; the more, the merrier, he thinks. If everybody’s searching for the Symbiote, surely they’ll find it eventually, right? Too bad they don’t have any samples of it left to make a wide search through the computers for it.
It’s not like it was his first time; that experience he got to share with Gwen, at least. But that thought doesn’t make him feel better at all. In fact, he’s feeling worse than ever, like he’s ready to never leave this bed at all.
The moment the doors open, Cap pushes inside without hesitation, calling out for Mr. Stark before Peter can even walk in. Peter waits for a few more seconds, trying to calm himself down. Then he looks up at the ceiling.
“I can ask if she wants to come, but it would be hard since she’s currently out of the country. Something about a dude called ‘Crossbones’?” Peter explains.
Clint sleeps. There’s nothing much to add about that. He gets into the workshop, suggests that, if Tony wants to get drunk he’ll join him, and then lies down on the couch and takes a nap, telling Tony to wake him up if he needs him.
“Oh no,” he mutters automatically, a reaction he’s come to adopt from Peter. He’s had his fair number of run-ins with Deadpool, given the fact that the guy seems to have one gigantic crush on Peter that will probably never be reciprocated.
That was when Steve had started to think about what Stark had said on the helicarrier, that first day they met.
Steve pecks Tony on the cheek before walking off towards the crowd. A couple of people are still looking at them, though others are taking the small break to head to the toilet. Steve jumps down into the public, allowing a couple of the people to take selfies as well. Tony can’t help but smile as he watches his boyfriend crawling out of his shell like that.
“I don’t know how you came back, Venom, but this time I’ll make sure you’ll never see the light of day anymore,” somebody says, once again in a familiar voice. Before Peter can speak up, though, his spider-sense warns him on impending danger – so great that it worked so well
“Who would have thought Tony Stark to be lame?” Peter mutters jokingly, and Tony puts a hand on his chest, pretending to be shocked and insulted by it. He throws his hand on his forehead, leaning his head back as he acts like he’s fainting. Peter just snorts and turns around until his back is leaning against Tony’s side.
Oh lord, is he crying? Peter is pretty sure he’s crying. Yup, there are tears rolling over his cheeks. In a hurry, he tries to wipe them away, thinking back of how his voice had been cracking during that last sentence. Mr. Morita is looking at him in surprise, as if he’s wondering how exactly innocent little Peter could make such a drama.
“Uh, yeah, it’s a bit complicated. We speak two languages, but in our dialect, we mix those two,” Yaël scratched her head, how could she remember the two/three languages she spoke, but not the name of the planet she came from? “One language is a specific one from our planet itself. The other one is Norwegian.”
Her eyes, they’re just… it’s like they’re trying to burn inside his soul, to get all of the secrets out of him. She stares with determination, but trying to show aloofness along as well. Without getting him out of her sight, she grabs for another fry and dips it right back into the sauce.
Mr. Stark seems impressed as he looks at the base of the reactor. So far, it’s not working because of the missing ‘badassium’, but Peter is sure that even like this Mr. Stark can figure out if it’s good or not.
“May, I’m-“ Peter starts, but he doesn’t know what he can say. Does he need to apologize here? Should he explain what happened? Should he-?
“You have no idea,” he gets out. “Just… I’m sorry if I’m not such good company in the upcoming few days. I’m already missing the rest of the semester because of this stupid disease in my head.”
“Mr. Stark?” the man asks. Tony pulls his hand from Steve’s mouth and nods before standing up. If the guard is surprised about what he saw, he’s not showing it. “The chief wants to see you. It’s about the transfer of Mr. Rogers tomorrow?”
They stop when Steve’s phone suddenly goes off. The loud noise cuts into the air, revealing to everybody outside that he’s here. Natasha lets out a curse, and Steve hurries to take the phone. Nobody’s coming, he thinks they’re safe for now. Quickly, Steve presses the green button and puts the device against his ear.
," Tony explains casually. He grabs an apple from the fruit-basket and takes a big bite out of it. Steve raises an eyebrow after that, and Peter, too, gives him his most unimpressed look.
“I know,” he sighs unhappily. MJ then turns towards him, her dark eyes boring into where she thinks his are. She inspects him thoroughly, suddenly reaching out a hand towards his chin. Without a warning, she pulls a strand of spaghetti away.

“Peter, please, let’s not fight about this…please?” Her friend looked up at her and seemed a bit disordered.
During the days, things are going fine. During the night a bit less. Tony is haunted by nightmares, memories he thought he’d suppressed but are actually following him now. Afghanistan, New York, Pepper falling to her death… Sometimes he’s greeted with images of a life he used to dream to have with Mary. Sometimes it’s Pepper, and there’s a kid involved.
’-routine. Having forgotten the case in the hotel, Peter just throws it underneath the couch for now right before dropping into it.
"The only thing we know is that she worked together with that idiotic piece of shit, you can't deny that. She's friends with him."
“I don’t care. My son is currently busy getting his second and third degree at the same time. I’m not distracting him from his studies because the company wants ‘some youth brought back into it’.” Tony does the airquotes as he speaks.
FRIDAY asks in his mind. That’s the good thing about Extremis, Tony figures. Or, it’s not really extremis. It’s something completely new, based off extremis. Being connected to the world, to everything electrical at all times… it makes him feel all-knowing for some reason. Especially when he can just have silent conversations with his AI inside his head without the others knowing about it.
“Yeah, apparently so. Though nobody wants to tell me where I’m from or how I got to be here,” Yaël complains. “It’s so frustrating, I can’t remember anything, and everybody who knows just simply refuses to say anything!”
“So, uhm, that man in the picture with you and Peter… He a family friend?” she tries. Tony could almost laugh at the question.
"Okay, see you- wait, what time-" But X already hung up. Great, now Yaël didn't even know when she had to get up and shower. Nine? Eight? Probably seven...maybe six. Yaël had arrived at her block and opened the door with the blurred glass to the small hallway. She decided to take the stairs, which she saw was the right decision after she walked passed the first floor.
Surfing a bit on the internet while eating his snacks, Peter sits on the roof of a train. The hot summer sun is shining down on him, but he doesn’t feel it. That’s how awesome his suit is!
“Parker and pizza, best combination ever!” Wade joked, but he didn’t get a smile back. Instead, the teenager looked somewhat grumpy. He probably wanted to fill his evening differently, but he was trapped by Wade now. Peter dropped the pizza boxes on a small table that was meant as a post-table, but Yaël never got any mail, so it was permanently empty.
Peter smiles as well, standing up and pulling May into a tight hug. She starts chuckling, wrapping her arms protectively around him.
Shit, what exactly happened last night? He remembers having another panic attack, but other than that… all he can recall that, apparently, he chased Steve off.
“Yeah, yeah, stop whining. I’m just free from training Peter, so I already had to listen to him for a whole session.” This time it was Yaël who cocked her eyebrow.
Bucky was somewhere still inside of there, and I was ready to die to get that part of him back out.”
Peter runs back off the balcony. He needs to check out the compound, then. Maybe there he can find out what’s going on, if the building’s still there at least. Last Peter can remember, SHIELD is still there trying to figure out what this meteor is about.
Peter isn’t even crying. The shock and the panic is too strong for that right now. All he can do is gently tap Tony’s face, regularly checking for his pulse. It’s slow, but it’s there.
“Don’t tell me that’s Peter,” Tony mutters out, pointing towards the baby in Johnny’s arms. It looks about eight months old, maybe. The moment the kid’s big brown eyes fall on Tony, he stops crying.
“You are a reckless one, let me tell you that,” the man says, sounding kind of frightened. How adorable, the guy is thinking about his safety. Peter feels honored, if it wasn’t for the fact that the Captain has no idea who exactly he is behind the mask.
But then he hears that ever so quiet sound, from over the couch. Tony walks up, a bit curious as to what it could be. When his phone buzzes in the pocket of his pants, he takes a quick look. It’s Peter, telling him he’s going to the movies tonight with May. Tony wishes them a lot of fun in a quick reply.
“I think I’m going to refuse this offer, thanks,” Yaël answered dryly, but determined. Nothing this woman could say, was going to change her decision. Nilla smirked.
So, it is agreed that Steve joins them on their movie-night. Once they’re at the tower, the decision is quickly made to watch
“Too long,” he agrees. Then he pulls away and takes Peter’s face into his two hands. “You look great, Peter.”
“I’ll have a talk with the principal, maybe get his teachers to give him some extra work he can make while he’s at home,” Tony suggests, only to receive a long look from May. When he notices, he frowns for a moment, wondering if he did something wrong?
She hid behind the rock and... saw something that made Yaël drop her pudding out of shock. Holy shit, the black hair and slim built, she’d recognize it anywhere. As soon as Yaël recognized Loki, with who must probably be Thor walking by his side, she sat down again and hid behind the rocks. She squeezed her eyes shut and tried her best to remember the blonde guy. “
“What, was he afraid that I was going to hurt his feelings? Or did he think I was going to blow up the city again?” Yaël sneered sarcastically while poking in her pasta with her fork.
Tony raises his head, as if he’s looking at the ceiling. Then he nods and shifts back towards the other two. He dries his cheeks and lets out a long breath. After that, he returns to his chair and takes his place down again.
Ben is already seated on the chair in front of Reed. He’s looking into a file, but he doesn’t really seem to pay too much attention to it. The seat in front of Sue is still empty. They’re waiting on Johnny. The secretary of State, former General Ross, is talking with one of his colleagues. The guy he brought along, is holding a suitcase and handing Ross a remote.
“I still don’t understand why I can’t join. I’ve been a founding member of the Avengers!” Tony complains, not really
The fire-one offered her its hand to help her get back onto her feet, but Yaël waved it away and got up herself, as the fire would’ve burnt her hand if she’d grab it. “Look, that one at least has some manners,” Yaël said while brushing some dust off her pants. The water-one threw its arms in the air, then it put one of its hands on its, uh, hip and with the other hand, it moved its fingers in such a way that it looked like a mouth that quickly opened and closed. It was telling her she was talking too much. “Wait a minute, you sassy twat, you-“
He’s not surprised when a large gun – is that one from Natasha’s collection? – is pointed at him. Barnes is standing on the stairs, Steve is still on the ground, keeping his shield in front of him. Tony can see him lower it the moment he sees him walking inside.
When Yaël heard someone yell: “We’re going through the Devil’s Anus!” through the hallways, she turned her head and stared to the window once again. An enormous vortex was right in front of them and seemed to grow bigger as it pulled and then finally swallowed the spaceship.
They’re speaking softly, but he isn’t listening. He’s aware that the three had been called in to restrain Peter during his seizure, and they probably just never left.
Of course the kid was nervous! That was, again, so human of him. Peter was going to meet his dad again, who still didn’t know he had a son. Well, if Yaël really wanted to shake Peter up some more, she could tell him he was standing to what could be his stepdad someday. But Yaël didn’t want to give Peter an attack, nor did she want Steve to have a nervous breakdown. Jesus, what a weird situation.
Once he gets to bed, he bitterly finds out that Wade figured out his number, and deletes his messages that contain nothing more than little heart-emoji’s.
Tony rubs his eyes. The fifteen-thousandth sigh leaves his mouth as he squints his eyes once more to look down into the microscope. What he sees is the exact same thing as the past 105 times he’s tried this out.
“I feel like I should say ‘yes’ to that to spare your feelings maybe, but no, I’m not surprised at all.” Mary smiles as she walks out of the elevator shaft.
Suddenly, Yann appears with a couple of water bottles with him. Handing one to each of them, he nods towards the exit.
But at the same time, Tony is glad. There’s no more hiding now, after all. And as he looks at his smiling son next to him, all he feels is pride, happiness. The exact opposite of what he felt precisely one year ago. He’s a father, he’s in a stable relationship, he’s sober and even healthier than before, if possible. If he can get used to the serum inside of him with Peter and Steve’s help, he’s got nothing to complain about.
There’s a silence from Steve, who blinks a few times, opens up his mouth, but closes it again time after time. He even lets a few balls bump up against his head, not reacting to it.
“What is he like? Is he as smart as everybody says he is? Many people also say he’s kind of an asshole, but I’d like to think that a man who donates that much money to so many charity cases isn’t that much of a jerk, you know?”
“You watch your language, young man,” Steve says sternly while Tony rolls his eyes. He comes to sit up for a bit, reaching forward until he grabs the collar of Peter’s shirt. Pulling it downwards, he reveals a bit of Peter’s suit.
“Listen, kid, there’s obviously some things we need to talk about,” Tony starts after they’ve been driving for five minutes. They’re already stuck in traffic, and immediately Tony regrets not taking the suit to fly them out of here.
“Have you brought up the marriage thing yet?” she asks. Peter’s mouth falls open behind his mask. A ball smashes against his head. When he turns around, he finds Clint sticking out his tongue towards him. Peter flips him off, glad Steve didn’t see it.
Natasha sees what he’s doing here. It’s smart, but on the other hand it’s also extremely uncomfortable. It’s obvious enough in everybody else’s faces. Steve looks red, again. James is looking at his hands, Sam is looking at the ground. Only Clint holds on to the eye contact.
“Alright, we’ll get you to New York,” he sighs, clearly not completely behind the idea, but willing to risk it for his best friend. Steve manages a small smile after that.
“You know what, never mind… I’m not telling you anything more,” Steve mutters, pulling his hands loose from Tony’s and crossing his arms, clearly annoyed at him. Tony can’t help but laughing further, wiping some tears from his eyes.
Peter waves his hand a bit. “Eh, give or take. Just a couple of them. The rest is still in New Asgard to celebrate the royal wedding.”
When it’s clear that there’s no way for them to get through, neither of them need to speak for Peter to know what he needs to do. Peter puts a few webs on his legs against the cycle to make sure he stays on it, and then he shoots up on a few buildings, pulling themselves upwards with the vehicle included. His muscles burn from the heaviness, but it works when they practically fly above all the people without slowing down.
He’s swinging around New York after another school day, expecting nothing more than the usual robbery or mugging, when suddenly, something large and green comes crashing down in a building not too far from where he currently is standing.
He always tried to hide them or at least keep them folded neatly, but every time he got a guitar in his hands, he forgot to focus on them, which caused his wings to naturally open or sometimes even flutter a bit. Yaël always loved these moments, because Icarus’s wings were really magnificent, and it was a shame he tried to keep them as discrete as possible.
To distract himself, he quickly goes through the rest of the journal, but somewhere around the end, he notices a few missing pages; they’ve simply been ripped out, he thinks. Huh, whatever his mother has written there, she surely didn’t want anybody to read those.
“What the hell do you mean by that?” they ran around a corner, into another hallway. Wade was way quicker than her, she was even kind of losing him. Until he suddenly stopped. Well, he didn’t exactly stop running, he just…froze. As Yaël looked around, she noticed everyone stopped moving. She couldn’t hold back the gasp as she saw Logan froze right behind her.
“Where are you going?” Peter asks, posing the way she wants him to pose and waiting for her to snap the picture. His eyes are showing spots after the shot is taken.
“Uh, Dad, how are you even here? I thought you were in India?” Peter asks in confusion. He can clearly remember Tony leaving only yesterday. He can’t just have flown back to fish Peter out of the water.
“Listen, Steve, I have a lot of money riding on this, and I’m not going to let you ruin my chances of winning it,” Natasha had told him warningly, pointing a finger at his face with a menacing look in her eyes. Clint hadn’t been there at that moment.
“Yes,” he admits. Tony lets out another shaking breath, nodding in understanding – not really – before shaking his head.
He’s getting closer. Just a little while longer, and he’ll be there to get his Peter, to take care of his boy. He doesn’t care if he gets hurt himself, as long as his son is spared. Thanos can do with Tony whatever he wants. He can’t touch a single hair on Peter’s head.
“No, seriously Tony, have you turned yourself into a robot?” Her mouth drops open. “Have you been a robot all along? Does Peter have it, too?”
“If there is anything I know about Tony Stark, it’s that he won’t allow himself to die so easily,” T’Challa tries to assure him. Then he nods at Steve once again shortly before clearing his throat. “Now I have to leave the country for a few days, I’ll be in France to discuss the accords with a few people there. I trust you respect my word and stay put, Steven?”
Shuri, who is by now back in Wakanda, says that she can try to help with it. Having brought a blood sample along before she returned home, she promised to every member of the Avengers that she would try to fix this. Tony can’t wait until she manages to find something.
Peter rolls his eyes, looking up at the ceiling. Even that remark is irritating him! Why does he have so little patience today? Everybody should just go fuck themselves, that’s what Peter’s thinking.
“I can’t be there, I’m sorry Peter. T’Challa won’t allow me to head back to the States twice in one week. Besides, if the government learns that I’ve been in contact with him outside of accords-business, they’ll arrest him, too.” Of course, that doesn’t mean he’s not going to try. He’ll talk to T’Challa immediately. It’s an emergency after all. If they’re successful, Steve can be in New York in about twelve hours. Hopefully, by then Tony’ll be awake again, and they’ll know what exactly happened.
Peter listens, following Happy through a small hallway that leads to an open space with large windows. In the middle there’s a table with a case resting on it. Peter wonders how he was supposed to find it on his own?
Peter mutters, hanging up almost immediately afterwards. Tony pulls his hand towards his forehead, letting out another sigh while shaking his head.
“You’re all out of time, so to say,” Strange explains. Steve and Tony both stand up, blinking a bit in confusion. When they look through the portal, they can see everything happening in rewind. Explosions become undone. People who have fallen, rise back up. Tony takes a deep breath, and closes his eyes as he waits.
But, if he’s completely honest, there are, though few, also moments where being a parent is the worst. They’re rare in his experience, but they’re often connected with Peter lying in a hospital bed, monitored by multiple machines and an oxygen mask over his mouth.
“He made my phone explode with his stupid upgrades!” he then defends himself, getting back into his room and shutting the door again. Peter turns to Bruce, who rolls his eyes but smiles affectionately. Then he bumps at Peter and nods back into the hallway.
Then the conversation falls quiet. A little drama has been averted, and Peter’s secret is once again safe. He slowly picks up the arc reactor again, looking at it in silence as he tries to figure out the next step. Dum-E then hands him a steamy cup of coffee. In the background, he hears his cellphone ring again. Another text-message.
At one point during their lunch, Steve walks back in. He doesn’t ‘live’ in the compound anymore, staying at the tower more often than not. That means he’s being spared from all these childish discussions during the normally peaceful parts of the day.
“He’s the smartest kid in his class,” Tony adds proudly. He’s aware of Peter rolling his eyes in embarrassment, but it’s fun to tease him. After that, Tony clears his throat and turns towards Steve. “Honey, I’m getting drinks, do you want anything?”
At that moment, a loud noise comes from further into the park. Peter recognizes that noise as a fight taking place, and he figures he could help out a bit. He quickly jumps into the bushes and changes his clothes before anybody can really notice it, and then he’s on his way.
Sharon Carter enters the tower at exactly seven in the evening. She’s still in her SHIELD-uniform, holding a tablet in her hands while she keeps on tapping away on the screen, not even looking up at Tony or Steve as she walks inside.
“Yeah yeah, don’t worry, I’ll be out as soon as I finish here,” Peter says, waving him off. Francis is cool, of course, but Peter’s one of those guys who rather works alone – or in the company of a rather incompetent bot, as it turns out. “Dum-E, please hand me a marker?”
“Actually, I need to say one last thing about it,” Steve quickly adds, pulling his head back. Tony raises an eyebrow. “I, uh… I’ve spent some time with, uh, children. You know, in the other universe. And, you know… if you really want them I wouldn’t mind… you know, wouldn’t mind too much, I guess.”
“Holy shit they must have started early,” Johnny says, sounding actually impressed. Peter looks at the sleeping girl, but figures she’ll be fine when he sees her chest go up and down regularly. They don’t knock on the door since it’s open. Instead, they just walk inside, where the heat is even more than before. Peter shrugs out of his coat without needing any more second to think about it.
“So, you’re an alien? I told you Fury and X kept something from you.” Wade said while Yaël made a cup of coffee for him. Wade visited her for no specific reason. He knew she only had to work in the afternoon today, so he simply jumped in during the morning.
Peter doesn’t pay too much attention to Flash, finding the guy’s still a dick despite his sudden turn in behavior. Instead, he keeps himself busy with catching up on his favorite shows, patrolling the streets and after a while even missing a few of his classes. Having bought the latest Assassin’s Creed at last (Peter forgot it came out a few months ago), he’s finding himself binge-playing through the entire game.
“You really want to know?” Tony asks then. “You want to know how, in the evening, one of us gets into the room, giving each other a look? A look that says it all? You want to know how, right before we go to bed, on the moment that I’m about to put on my pajamas, Steve touches my shoulder, turns me around, starts kissing me right here?” Tony points up to his lips.
He didn’t know if it was the medication or the sessions, but after a while, things didn’t seem so dark anymore. Sure, sometimes he started spacing out once or twice, but he managed to pick up his life more or less after a while, and wore the suit once again. By the time December was finished, though, he learned that the only way for him to succeed in his school-year was to start an internship to earn extra points.
true, so if anybody wants to look you up they won’t find anything other than that. As far as anybody’s concerned, you’ve been interning at Stark Industries the entire time.”
“I’m sorry, pal, but you’ve never really been good handling the girls, have you?” He asks. Peter pushes him away by his face and hands out the last plate before pulling the apron over his head.
Nobody responds to that, understanding that there’s just a lot of things that she wouldn’t know right at this moment and that they shouldn’t try to force it all on her. They walk forward in silence, slowly nearing the pond where Peter can already see the ducks swimming about.
“Better we- uh- better we move to the bedroom?” Tony suggests, and reluctantly, Steve pulls his lips back and drops his forehead on Tony’s shoulder. The two start chuckling nervously. “Or do you want to finish the dishes, first?”
“You might have mentioned it once or twice,” Tony responds. “It’s not surprising, though, since I’m quite easy to love.”
“Peter, watch out!” Yaël suddenly shouts, pointing towards something on the road. When Peter looks up, he realizes too late that there’s an old lady crossing the road. The only way of avoiding her is to crash the car, meaning that they could end up wounded. Peter really doesn’t want to end up at the interview all bloody.
“Hey hey hey, kiddo, I told you I needed your help. Now come here,” Mr. Stark says from the other side of the room. Peter turns around and nods, quickly hurrying back to his side where he can see the mechanic working on what seems like a-
Peter decides not to look at everything, still wanting to give Harry some sort of privacy. He puts the files away, stands up and stretches his arms. When something pokes him in the side, Peter can see U holding the cellphone and motioning Peter with it.
“How do I apply?” Peter asks. Dr. Cho pushes herself off the counter and goes to walk to her desk to pick up a phone number. Then she offers it to Peter.
“Uh,” he mutters, letting his mouth fall open at the sudden realization that he’ll get to introduce these two! He hopes they’ll get along! “Ned! This is Harry! He’s my best friend from when we were kids!”
“Still, Peter could’ve died by this stupidity of yours,” even though she was the one who told Peter to get in. This was all her fault… “You clean up this mess, you hear me? And you make sure Fury never finds out I had anything to do with this, or I’ll have no electricity for a month,” she hissed.
Crap, Peter knows he’s smart, but he doesn’t know if he’s smart enough to be working with Mr. Stark! No matter he’s got his own brain from the man, he’s never really been surrounded into the electrical engineering world like
“No, it’s mostly that friend of yours. She came into the office to get a job, claiming that I’m stealing you away from her,” Tony mutters then, sitting back down on the chair. He rubs his forehead while looking to the side.
On the seventh day, Yaël felt bored so she bought an old cello that had been repaired with duct-tape. It was pure instinct, like, she sort of knew she could play the instrument. That cello became her best friend, even though it sounded miserable, because, indeed, Yaël knew very well how to play it.
“Shit!” Steve even yells after realizing their plan had failed. Much to their surprise, an expensive car shows up, revealing T’Challa waiting for them as it he’d been expecting this. So apparently he’s back into the country.
She hadn’t seen Steve nor Sam in a few days and she wondered where they were. All the others seemed to be busy, probably searching those two. But nobody kept Yaël up to date, so what did she know except for that she really wanted wished she was in Hogwarts right now.
“Yeah, off to see my uncle,” Miles says, pointing towards the door that is now behind him as he walks backwards towards it. Mr. Li smiles.
Peter rolls his eyes the moment he hears the question. It’s about the fifth time already that Tony’s asked, and so far he’s always gotten the same answer.
Locking the tablet again for later, Peter walks into the open room of the penthouse. This has almost everything in it; the kitchen, the living room
“Of course it isn’t. I’ll just go help my… boyfriend… I suppose,” Tony says, uncertainly. Wilson just smirks at the word, but luckily doesn’t comment on it. By the time the audio is back on, Tony is already walking away.
But in all his frustration, the warning came late; right when Peter turns around, he’s swooped up in the air by a pair of hand hauling him up underneath his shoulders. Peter’s legs swing around, attempting to wiggle free from the hold.
“Oh, wow,” Yaël smiled teasingly “You surely have already been active during the flight.” Loki crossed his arms and looked outside.
“We’ve been feeling pretty crappy lately, haven’t we?” Tony asks, pulling away slightly so he can look at Steve, who still has his eyes closed but with a sad expression on his face as well. “Don’t you think we should… talk?”
“Says the single idiot towards the guy with an actual relationship,” Peter mutters. Shuri sticks out her tongue towards him.
Steve doesn’t struggle when he’s next. He allows Thor to do exactly what he did with Tony, except this time it goes a bit faster. Steve’s color scheme is, obviously, red blue and white. He does the obvious things himself; putting on the white pants, the red boots. Once he’s given the blue shirt, he’s surprised when Thor starts putting it over his head. In contrary to Tony’s uniform, Steve doesn’t have a chest plate. Instead, there’s a star on the lower left of his belly, made from white stones and small red gems. The cape he’s wearing is red, the same color as Tony’s fabric. In contrary to Tony, Steve has a hood on his cape.
Oh, she’s rambling. Her hand is going through her hair and the other is squeezing the pamphlet until her fingers look white. Peter should intervene, quickly.
Tony doesn’t respond, instead leaving the living room and getting back in the kitchen. Once there, he puts his glass down on the table and turns towards the fridge to get the water bottle back out.
Five seconds may have passed ever since he let go of the Goblin. In five seconds, his mind has wandered everywhere, his heart is already aching, and his fingers are trembling. But not because of the fall; because of Gwen.
“She’s been dead for a few era’s already,” Yaël answered while scratching her hand. It wasn’t easy to talk about it, as everyone reacted with pity, which Yaël really avoided. Hilde’s mouth fell open, but then it seemed like she made a puzzle in her head.
Tony nods. “Yes, we’re both unharmed, but we’re stuck under a pile of rubble that could collapse with the smallest touch.”
Peter blinks, looking at his mask in his hands. Then, indicating for Harry to wat, Peter quickly rolls it over his head, looking at the screens in front of him.
“I wouldn’t expect anything else from you; you’re Tony Stark, after all,” he assures him. Tony smiles lightly before pulling him along. It’s about time they get to their destination, because Tony is starving, and he’s sure Steve is, too.
He shifts on the bed, turning around to face Steve. Putting a hand under his head, his eyes lock with Steve. Neither of them speaks or moves, instead just looking and breathing. Then, after what must be two more minutes, Tony finally reaches out a hand and puts it on Steve’s cheek.
“You can’t die, Sugarpie…” Yaël heard Wade’s voice echo in the nothingness. Oh, so she was getting hints now? What was this, some twisted game of cluedo? ‘Watch your friends and family die as you try to find the answer’, the new, sensational game! Okay, sure, Wade had claimed that Yaël was immortal, but there was no proof for that. Well, okay, she survived a Hulk-smash somehow, which seemed to be a big deal.
Peter nods, smiling slightly. “Yeah, I’m fine. I’m back on the wheel,” he assures her. “Though I’m not sure for how long. The suit is already starting to resist it.”
Peter doesn’t really know when it happens that a random girl takes him away. At one moment, they’re dancing together, and the other she drags him along to the stairs, pulling him inside a bedroom that clearly isn’t Flash’. A small part inside of Peter wonders if he should even be allowed in there, but the other part doesn’t care.
“Come on, Parker,” Peter mutters to himself, shaking his arms and legs a few times before running after the Captain. His heartrate is speeding up the closer he gets, and his fists are clenched so tight that he almost doubts there’s enough blood passing through.
“I’ll just… go there for a bit…” he says. Everybody nods, and before anybody can say anything Peter’s already gone.
Tony tries to ignore the thought. He tinkers on, works out a few more kinks in his formula and checks out the result once more. It looks more promising, but still not optimal. It’s alright, just start over, go for another angle.
“MJ called me. She asked if you were still alive since your phone seems to be turned off. For two days already.”
“I had to force myself to be here,” he admits. His eyes land on the child reaching out for him. In any normal occasion, he would have automatically taken him from her. This time, looking at Raido, all he wonders is if he could ever just get back to that childish innocence? Back to a time where he hadn’t lost so many people, hadn’t fucked up so horribly.
an unfamiliar female voice asks on the other side of the line. Peter takes a few steps away from the guy squirming on the ground just to make sure not to be overheard.
“Are you alright, handsome?” the girl asks. Peter picks up his books and then comes back up, holding out his hand.
Dum-E whirs up as he points his camera towards Peter, turning his claw a bit to the side like a dog would. Peter gives it a gentle pat on his ‘neck’.
She might not be a good friend, heck, the worst friend ever, instead… but she was going to show Nilla that she could be a good sister.
“NO!” the younger woman yelled as Yaël managed to pack in her arms. Of course, she started spitting fire after that. So Yaël had to build around her face too, leaving just a few holes to breathe, but not big enough to do much damage with her fire. That, and if she’d try to steer fire in there, she’d be baking herself.
“Exactly,” Charles says, sounding amused. “Now, I know it’s asking a lot, but there has been only one person alive that Wade here has any bit of respect for.”
Tony nods, though he’s not particularly sure what to think of this. He’d been expecting that he would be staying in here for another two weeks or so, but after what the other doctor just told him… It seems like he’ll be home by the end of the week. Though, regular check-ups with Dr. Cho will be necessary. While she’s no expert on the Super Soldier serum, she’s the one who knows most about it other than Bruce, and Tony’s not seeing him anywhere around.
“I remember how we walked in, and you pulled us to this stall, begging us to buy you one of those Iron Man masks. And Ben said we’d do it if you would pay it back later – so you would learn to start earning what you get.”
“Then what are you doing here? Go to your date!” Sam calls out, and Rhodey opens his mouth to say something, but then thinks better of it and shuts up instead. Of course, Rhodey knows about Tony and Steve; Rhodey knows
“Listen, I know we have much to talk about, but can you finally tell me about this secret mission Thor asked you for? The others wouldn’t say a word about it,” Tony asks. He needs a bit of a distraction. Peter’s fine right now, May’s with him. Steve’s here, too. Everybody’s here.
So Peter takes the high ground, swinging himself up in the air and passing by building after building. He does notice Captain America driving by on his motorcycle, shield safely put in front of his steering wheel. Quickly enough he goes his way, dropping himself a few houses before him. Cap stops just in time, missing him by just a few millimeters.
The evening comes to a close. Once they’re back on the stage, all of them wearing nice, black suits and Peter having put his hat back on, they wait for whatever else is going to come next.
“You have fought for us, protected us, risked your lives…,” Ross continues in his speech, and that’s when Tony sees Natasha move a little bit in her seat. She’s next to Rhodey, with her arms both underneath the table and her back straight, looking ever much like the ballerina she was trained to be in between learning to become an assassin. “But while a great many people see you as heroes, there are some that would prefer the word vigilanties.”
"Steve, stop staring at Tony's ass for a second. We need to get ready for the mission," Sam suddenly says. Everybody turns to look at Steve, whose face is now beet red, eyes blinking nervously. Tony, too, jumps up, turning around with a shocked face. He gasps.
“There are surprisingly few words coming out of your mouth right now,” the familiar voice of Natasha Romanoff says from behind him. “I’m kind of impressed, really.”
Huh, as if. Just because Peter is Tony Stark’s kid doesn’t mean that the chauffeur seems to overly like him. When Peter talks to him, Happy just gives him this stare that clearly says ‘
He can only just see Natasha smirk at him when he walks towards the kitchenette to get himself a cup of coffee.
When Peter Parker was a kid, he didn’t have many friends. People would think he was weird, or laugh at him because of his glasses and his braces. Others would call him a freak for how much smarter he was than the others. But even when it was offered to him to skip a few grades and be placed a few classes higher, he didn’t want to. Because people already didn’t like him, and he didn’t want the older kids to find him strange, too.
“So, when do you leave?” Tony asks, walking Steve by in an attempt to get away from him as soon as he can. But before he can even make it past the desk, he’s suddenly pulled back by his arm, turned around by Steve before the man puts his hands on the back of Tony’s head and presses their lips together. Tony’s eyes widen in surprise, but in just a matter of seconds he relaxes again. This is Steve; there’s no danger here at all.
“Yes! A thousand times yes, Mr. Stark!” He almost cries out. Then he realizes he’s being a bit too loud here, and he pulls back a little bit. “I mean, I would love to assist you in building it.”
“Are you sure you want to do this? It’s not too late to back out now,” she explains. But Peter shakes his head.
“They once were, in the real world, when you were really stuck in it. But this is a dream, remember that. You can manipulate it.” Yaël nodded. Yeah, he was probably right. The problem was, Yaël knew well enough that she wasn’t trained at all. Controlling her powers was a big challenge. But she had to try.
At the end of the fourth journal, his parents are back together and they’re engaged to be married. That’s when Peter puts the journals back away again and makes his way back home. It’s almost evening and he hasn’t eaten all day besides breakfast. Quickly, he makes his way back to his alley and gets dressed back to his own self, before walking to his house. He doesn’t really feel like spending too much time there, so all he does is pick up the fifth and sixth journal, and then he makes his way to the park. It’s not like he has any friends to go to, anyway.
“You guys are no help at all,” he complains. He doesn’t startle when the door to the penthouse opens and Bruce comes walking inside, eyes planted on his own tablet as well as he’s reading whatever Tony is looking at right now.
And when Steve comes up on the screen along with all the other Avengers, shaking the host’s hand, he smiles. He can’t not; Steve is just too perfect.
This is going on long enough. He needs to contact Scott as soon as possible. However he’s going to go back in time, Scott and Hope surely can help him out with it.
time. So I want you to understand that, whatever happened in Siberia, I’m not holding it against you. I never have. If anything, you’re supposed to be angry at me for not telling you sooner about your parents.”
“Yes, totally!” Yaël shouts with much enthusiasm. The smile on her face is genuine, and for a moment Peter finds himself silenced by the sudden realization that he’s not in this alone, anymore.
“It’s okay, Peter,” Tony continues. He glances a quick look at May on Peter’s other side, finding the woman close to having some sort of panic attack. Shit, he should get Rhodey here as soon as possible. Quickly, he leans to Steve’s side and whispers at him.
“I made that thing, I get to use my own toys once in a while,” Mr. Stark counters. “Besides, I pay for this entire building. If you want the honest truth, you’re all even more than a handful! If I have to hire another cleaning-maid, I think I might actually just build one from scratch.”
“Yeah yeah, I can’t bring home more than one girl,” Johnny complains while rolling his eyes. “I already know, don’t remind me of it all the time.”
“That’s because you should make your homework yourself,” the boy, Ned, says with a shiver in his voice. The bully – Peter doesn’t need long to understand it’s Flash and Eddie – just starts to laugh while he looks at his friends. Though, surely, none of these people actually see Flash as an actual friend. They’re probably just scared of being bullied as well if they aren’t.
“You should think about going international. The Avengers do it all the time.” Peter snorts, shaking his head and licking his lips, forgetting that he’s still wearing his mask and instead licking the fabric.
“What do you think? That I would bring my seventeen-year-old son with me when school’s started again?” Tony snaps. He should really hold it in, but he’s not really in the mood for that.
Peter knows what’s the smart thing to do; in a battle, when the enemy is too strong, he’ll always find a way around it. At school, whenever Flash is there again to punch him in the gut – though that hasn’t been happening lately – he’ll make the wise choice not to fight back and reveal his powers to his peers. He doesn’t drink (anymore, because last time had been a disaster), doesn’t smoke, nor does he do drugs.
“Yes, sir,” he jokes, saluting him before taking the glasses and heading Rhodey’s way. The soldier is talking to Happy, seated on the couch and discussing a few of Tony’s old adventures while at the same time glancing in the direction of the kitchenette. Peter thinks he might try and listen in in a while.
“We can’t stay for long. We’ve already been here half an hour and it’s only one hour at a time,” Peter warns him the moment the doctors are gone. He fishes out a tablet from his bag and hands it to Tony. “I thought you might want this for a little while?”
“Somewhere where we’ll both feel at home: Norway.” Nilla’s laughter stopped. Instead, she stared at Yaël in disbelief.
“I’m sorry, I’m so happy that you’re going to get better. But I also didn’t want Steve-“ he doesn’t finish. Tony just pats his shoulder, pressing a quick kiss against his hair. “It’s just- he came to save you, and now they’ve taken him into custody. They’ll transport him away this evening.”
Above the door, there’s another TV-screen. Where the remote is, Peter doesn’t know. When he notices the tablet on the corner of the desk, he decides it can’t be too wrong to try it out a little bit. So he takes it along before he leaves the room, starting up the screen and finding it pretty easy to get inside.
“I’m not saying it’s impossible, but there would have to be safeguards,” he admits at last. Tony can feel his heart actually jump at that, and he can’t help his sudden enthusiasm. Maybe things don’t have to be so bad between them. Maybe they’ll actually see eye-to-eye.
“We went to this party and the next day we woke up and he just sort of collapsed…” It was getting harder to sound stable.
And true to her word, a light starts shining somewhere on Peter’s right. Peter hurries to it, opening it up until he finds things that
“Tomorrow you just write that you updated Dum-E’s protocol or something,” Tony tells him while taking a pen.
“Hey, if it involves kissing my man, I’m glad to do it,” Tony says happily, leaning against Steve while patting his chest lovingly. Steve just clears his throat, clearly still not the most comfortable here.
Tony nods once again, though the conversation falls flat after that little exchange. She takes them through the hallway, entering a door after passing a badge against the scanner. Tony sees her picture on it, still hating the fact that she left Stark Industries to come work for this nutjob here.
need to have yourself checked at.” Peter gets on his feet and starts searching through his closet. Then, he pulls out a couple of clothes and throws them on the bed. “Put these on, leave the suit here. And let me know what the doctors say.”
He can understand the tests they’ve been doing. The blood reports indicate strange valuables that seems to change with each test, stabilizing more and more towards the end until it comes close to resembling a normal blood report.
With lots of effort, he manages to pull his mask away from his face. Breathing still hurts, but it’s better than suffocating inside that metal cage. He needs to get out of the full suit. But that would mean he’d have to reach for the emergency lever, and he doesn’t think he can do that right now.
“When have we ever done something the traditional way?” he jokes. Tony, too, chuckles at that. It’s good to see the laughing lines appear on his tired-looking face again. “I’m serious, Dad. All this crap with Steve, major surgery, the accords… I can understand if you need a little break after a while.”
But he is, especially when suddenly a note is dropped in front of him with on it a very badly made drawing. It’s mostly stick-figures, but the names on top reveal enough.
Thor stops talking. Jane lifts up one hand to her face, wiping away a tear and sniffing her nose. Then she chuckles, turning her face to the audience awkwardly. A few people laugh along, but mostly everybody stays quiet.
Crawling down to Bruce’s floor, he gets to the window of the lab before knocking against it. Immediately, Bruce turns around to see the source of the noise. When he sees Peter, he gives him a smile. This isn’t the first time Peter does this.
“Wa’ an’body hurt?” Steve continues. He finally lifts his head but keeps his eyes closed, instead looking to where he thinks Tony is seated.
Feeling a small ache in his side from all the action, Peter decides to take a small rest on top of a building. He sits down with his feet hanging over the edge, and he takes a good look around him, taking in the permanent wakefulness that is New York. He’s never been in Brooklyn much, but he finds it familiar enough to know his way in and out.
Then Peter squeezes the steering wheel, bringing the car into the usual traffic that will forever stay in New York.
Tony loos up when he suddenly sees something in the sky. It’s like a little meteor or something. In a quick motion, it flies over the city until it lands somewhere in the forest. He looks at it for a long while before FRIDAY starts talking.
“What the actual fuck are you doing here?” he didn’t look happy to see her at all, but she hadn’t expected anything else.
On the other hand, the Infinity War won't be a complete part of this story! So whatever (horrible?) things we have planned, you won't read them here, but more in the second part of the series (aka Yael's story) if you want to read it still when the time comes.
Wanda doesn’t open the book, instead handing it to Rhodey who gestures at her to give it to him. Tony stays away, noticing how Steve stays unmoving, eyes pointed towards the book on the table like it’s going to attack them.
There he was, Raido, with Nilla behind him, holding the blade against his throat just a split-second before slitting his throat. His lifeless body slammed against the tiles. And also that got replayed and replayed right in front of her. If she’d be able to break her neck, just to look away, Yaël would do it. Her two friends kept on dying and got joined by a shade that turned into her father breathing out his last, shaky breath before falling down in the grass.
.” Peter looks down to the ground. “But he’s not good right now, just like I’m not good. And we’re both trying to get better, but it seems to be taking a bit more time with him.”
Oh, Peter remembers that kiss. He lets out another shaky breath while he leans against the tiles of the wall, his forehead pressed against them while his mind brings him back to memory-lane.
“Okay this is getting old,” War Machine suddenly calls out, and then he lifts up in the air and starts racing towards Harry with the gun on his shoulder pointed forward. Harry hasn’t noticed yet, and Peter intents to keep it that way. The sooner he’s back into custody, the better.
Rhodey just sits him down and asks about what’s wrong. They usually sit on the couch while Peter keeps on working. On very few occasions did they tell Peter it’s better to go, since there won’t be anything they’ll do anymore on that day. Whenever that was the case, Peter used his sudden free time swinging through New York’s streets and searching for the bad guys.
“Thank you, Wade,” he says truthfully. Wade seems shocked for a moment longer before he smiles his teeth bare, truthful look gone from his eyes, replaced by the playful grin.
“Negative. If I’m correct, the suit is currently still located at the apartment Peter shares with young master Storm.”
This is a good thing. So Peter smiles, closing his eyes. He doesn’t know how long he’s lying there, but suddenly there’s a hand shaking him. Peter startles, jumping back up on his feet and immediately losing his balance.
Sure, there aren’t too many friends to contact in the first place; Wanda is still out on the mission (they’ve been gone for almost two weeks! It’s been driving Tony insane!), Wade is just too annoying to ask, Ned doesn’t even know about Peter’s friends, and- well, that’s about it.
So he brings up pictures. Images from New York when Victor went after them. From the London Eye, Shanghai when they teamed up with the Silver Surfer to chase away Galactus. Other battles with Doom, and so on and on. All the destruction they’ve left in their wake; the things they’ve helped rebuilt afterwards.
“How many fingers am I holding up?” Mr. Stark asks. Peter shakes his head and tries to stand up, only to find his shoulder hurting like hell. It almost reminds him of the time he got shot, and he wonders if something actually got through his skin.
“Just take your cards, Legolas,” he counters. Clint gives him a glare, but does as he’s asked. Once everybody has their deck, they start up a game, pretending to be any good at it. In all honesty, the only ones who can play are Clint and Tony. Though, with Clint, it was probably a requirement for being a super-spy.
“Ah, yes, I suppose it’s about time I get to visit Aunty Peg as well,” Tony says, grunting when he stands up from the couch. Peter sits up before falling down now that his support is gone, and drops the tablet.
Peter shakes Bruce by the shoulder, giving him a sympathetic look. “Nah, man, you’re the big guns. Remember when you pounded that purple jerk in the face so much he could barely breathe in between?”
Both Steve and Tony take a step back. Neither mentions Peter using the words ‘dads’ to address them.
“I guess you’re kind of right,” he agrees. “But you’re also kind of an ass for bringing it up, though.”
Deciding there’s nothing else much he can do, Peter moves forward at last. The moment he gets through those gigantic door, he immediately feels a difference in temperature; where it has been hot and humid outside, now it’s fresh and ventilated enough that Peter feels like he can finally breathe again.
“Just wait until you’ll see what the outfit for Peter will be,” Steve tells him. Tony smiles, putting down the gown and walking towards the bed. With his knees back on the bed, Tony leans down until his lips are against Steve’s. Steve reaches up his hand, putting them on his boyfriend’s hips and carefully holding on.
"Yeah, no, I’m not meddling with this,” she mutters back. With a headshake, she turns around and runs towards the window. Without saying another word, she jumps back into the open air, leaving Peter alone in the house. He, in turn, just starts walking towards his room to grab for his phone.
“She didn’t say, but I kinda saw it coming, I guess?” Harry sighs, turning his head to the side to look at Peter. “I mean, I’m not mad at her, it wasn’t working for a while, anyway, but still…”
Francis smiles then, pulling out his phone and searching through some pictures before turning the device towards Peter. On the screen, the boy can see Francis and his wife, clearly in a hospital. In the wife’s arms there’s a tiny little baby covered in many blankets.
Peter suddenly wonders if Mr. Stark even follows his own advice. Another sigh escapes his mouth, and their eyes meet. For a few short seconds, all Peter can see is what he sees in the mirror; that same dark shade of brown. There’s no speck of other color in it, just that one chocolate-darkness – that’s how Gwen liked to describe it.
Steve smirks a bit. “That sounds like a lot of paperwork,” he jokes, and Tony chuckles a bit as well. Then, Steve finally lowers the shield, taking another step towards the other man. Tony keeps himself where he’s standing, trying not to appear too eager. “It’s good to see you, Tony.”
“Ah, girl! You ruined the surprise!” Wade complains. Once she’s pulled away from Peter, Wade suddenly pulls him towards him and kisses him straight on the mouth. Peter squeezes his eyes shut in those few seconds that it lasts. “Aaah, that was my second gift.”
MJ gets back on her feet, wiping the pieces of earth from her pants. Then she turns back towards Peter.
going to Berlin to see his dad, and that’s that. But it would be risky. She might ask Tony how Peter’s doing, they might realize that Peter
“There’s something we need to discuss, Tony,” Steve says, holding up a small black box in his hands, which looks a lot like a medication-container to Peter. When he notices Peter slowly walking away, the super soldier gives him a wide smile. “Ah, you’re still here? How did it go?”
“Korg and Miek, you stay here, you’re in for the next round,” the other added. Without even giving Yaël the chance to protest, one of the two grabbed her arms and tilted her over his shoulder. Yaël grunted and slapped the guard in his face, who simply punched her back in full force. Great, Yaël was going to start this arena fight with an already blooded face.
” FRIDAY made Yaël jump while she was pulling the card out of the scanner, so the door got locked again.
“FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941. Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most
Natasha is in the gym, giving the training dummy probably half of her best shot. She’s sweaty, sticky and still full of so much energy inside of her. A small shout comes out of her mouth as she swings her leg up towards the head of the dummy, and it comes flying off.
Tony nods. “That’s why you arrived at the tower through the front door instead of the balcony,” Tony points out. Peter makes an affirmative movement. He forces himself up into a sitting position, pressing a hand on his chest while he tries to take deep breaths.
And then there’s the rain. Or, the water… And while Peter gets soaking wet from it, Tony can only just stare at his son’s moves. When did he ever learn how to move like that? Because Peter’s got serious rhythm.
It’s sweaty and it gets Tony breathless a few times as they move together despite the awkwardness in it as well. They don’t go all the way – they’re not ready for that. But every moment spent together is just as enjoyable.
“Hello?!” somebody asks in between coughs. Peter jumps up, practically sprinting the way of the source of the noise. Much to his surprise, it looks like a young teenage girl. She looks scared, red in the face from the heat, with wet cheeks from tears.
“Wake up,” Mantis whispers towards her, and slowly but surely, Felicia’s eyes open up. She blinks a few times, getting out of her slumber. She looks horrible and exhausted.
“He wants to join the Avengers again. But last time I let him, he ended up getting his neck snapped,” Tony blurts out. He stops talking and takes a few deep breaths while he tries to control the stinging in his eyes. “Anyway, I know I can’t entirely leave the Avengers behind me. I’m part of the team again. But I can do my damnest to keep my son out of it all.”
“If you want a chance to bring your grades back up, you’re always welcome to apply for the internship. There’s still a few open slots for the time being, which you might get if you hurry,” Tony says, trying to change the turn in the conversation. The kid looks relieved for that.
“Nah, man, I’ll take the stairs, that’s fine,” Hawkeye says. He lifts up his hand and instantly Peter slaps a high five onto it. “You’re not too bad at this, kid. A bit more experience, and surely the team will want to make you one of ours.” Then the Avenger is going through the door, leaving Peter alone on the roof.
“Your mother did mean a lot to me, yes,” Mr. Stark says, shrugging a bit. “Which is why her departure had been such a hard blow for me. Outside the knowledge of the press, Obey quickly sent me back to the hospital to get my act back together. Once again putting me on these pills.”
just saw their home being destroyed by… a meteor? What was it even? Peter turns towards MJ and gives her hand a tug. In return, he gets a questioning glance.
“She’s sleeping with him to get male-bathroom privileges, I’m sure of it!” a lady whispered to her friend as Yaël passed them.
Right when he’s about to get back outside, he notices his reflection; there’s smudged lipstick all over his mouth.
THE Captain America just fell asleep in her sofa. It wasn’t the first time, though. He used to sleep in her room every now and then, back when she lived in the compound. Yes, she remembered that, all of a sudden. She used to live in the compound, with Steve and…crap.
Steve guides him inside, but by now Peter knows his way around. Especially de medical-wing. As he sees Dr. Cho pass him by, he looks away despite the fact that she won’t even recognize him. There are even more doctors and nurses in here, as if the compound has its own hospital-wing –which Peter wouldn’t too surprised about, of course. They’re talking about Mr. Stark, after all.
Peter squeezes his eyes shut again. The raining has gone even stronger now, and Peter’s completely wet from head to toe. If he stays here much longer, he’ll probably end up with a cold, which really is a no-go in August.
Tony has no idea what has been going on with Steve’s team, or with Peter’s. He hardly sees them during the day, maybe just slightly during breaks. They arrive here at nine in the morning, and they leave again at seven in the evening, mostly exhausted – or Tony is, at least. Peter and Steve seem to have better stamina than he has.
Yaël smiled and turned back to her rice pudding. Just when she wanted to put the first spoon of her breakfast in her mouth, she suddenly heard a whooshing sound and a grunt, which made her jump up. Oh, Goddamn, she surely hoped the man wouldn’t jump off the cliff or anything, he looked so peaceful!
“O-okay,” Yaël muttered confusedly. He had told all of this like it was nothing, with a tone that didn’t fit the subject, but that was typical to Loki.
“Yeah, a Christmas present for Pepper,” he said, hastily. It only took one look to understand what he seemed to be struggling with.
Once he’s climbed up onto the balcony the lights turn on. Peter takes that chance to get a good look at his suit, finding that his once-red gloves are now indeed black. His wrists are bare, no longer carrying the technology he needs to shoot his webs. There are no refills on his belt, nothing.
“Ste-heeve, we finally have the penthouse to ourselves and now you want to go?” he tries again, for maybe the fourth time already. Steve just rolls his eyes.
“It’s artsy,” Peter explains, not finding the right word for it. The girl – Damn Peter might as well start learning their names, right? – just grins and takes out her pizza box. The way she sets herself down in the couch makes it clear that this is her own house, so Creepy Stalker Guy is probably the guest nobody ever invites but keeps on coming anyway.
There’s more hesitation coming from the woman in front of him. When she raises her head again, her brown eyes are filled with tears.
“Yes, can I help you, sir?” Peter asks, trying with all the force that he has to be polite. It’s not worth getting fired, over. Just try to look calm, don’t show that you’re annoyed as fu-
“Dad?!” he shouts, banging the door now with his fist. If Tony fell asleep, Peter needs to wake him up one way or another. “FRIDAY, can you open up the door for me?”
Natasha bites her lip, finding the shocked looks on the men’s face just hilarious. Tony shrugs off his jacket and hangs it up to the chair he’s seated on.
“If, uh… If I give you the code to bypass them, will you do it?” Peter asks. He’s just being polite here, because even if Ned will refuse, Peter can just do it himself. Ned holds up his hands in surrender.
“I- uh…” Steve mutters out, but then he shakes his head and follows after Tony. Whatever they say next, Peter has no clue. He’s just wondering what is going to happen here. Is he getting thrown out as Tony and Steve go hang out? Or is he allowed to go with them? Does he even want to go with them?
“Crap, you didn’t know?” he asks. Then he slaps his forehead. “Shit, I’m sorry. They were kind of a thing for about three months, maybe four? I don’t know. The problem is that Steve didn’t want to reveal it yet, so nobody really knew.”
“What the hell?” Barnes whispers, seeming even more nervous than before. Tony wonders how long it’ll be until he snaps and just starts shooting everywhere in hope to eventually hit the guy.
“No, we haven’t. Though we were going to if you hadn’t woken up an hour from now,” she says. When there’s a sudden knock on the door, everybody turns to look at it as it opens. There, Bruce’s face suddenly shows up. There’s obvious relief when he sees Tony awake, lying in bed.
“Eh, no, I make these myself,” she said a bit muffled with her head still in the fridge. Wade cocked his eyebrow.
Instead of going to sleep or making homework, he’s just back in the suit, swinging through the streets. He needs the distraction, needs the control that he gets with this suit, the idea of invincibility.
What he sees in front of him is a representation of himself crying as a robot that doesn’t even remotely look like Dum-E works around him. There’s some stupid jokes written around them, but Peter doesn’t bother to read them, instead folding it up into a little ball and throwing it into the trash can with perfect precision.
Luckily, Peter had given her some sort of signal by trying to call her. Heck, Steve had tried to call her a few times since she left too, but for some reason, she never felt like picking up the phone. Yaël didn’t really understand why she didn’t want to. Sometimes, she felt like she was mad at Steve for causing this huge fight. But other times she felt like the islands were a cocoon, like nothing was important enough to disturb her. Like nothing else except the rocks, the sea and her existed.
“I’ll, uh, I’ll keep the phone with me? Dad keeps it in the box all the time, so I don’t think he’ll notice it’s gone.”
As if on cue, the Hulk appears, roaring just as angrily as Steve. He grabs Thanos by the neck, and starts throwing him on the ground.
So, when Peter’s mouth fell open and he told her that he couldn’t believe he got his driver’s license before her, she almost put her fist into his face. Why did he say that with Cap standing next to him? Now that old man was laughing with her again! Why was driving so important, jeez. It was just a big frustration to her.
It’s a kid about Peter’s age that comes up to him this time. He smiles, extremely happy by his visit.
“Goodnight, son,” Steve whispers addressing him the same way Steve addresses Spider-Man. Peter keeps himself from smiling as Steve pulls away, only for Tony to take his place. Another kiss is planted on his forehead.
“How have I been, Rogers? Horrible! That’s how I’ve been. You happy now? What did you expect? That I would just… get over this so quickly?”
He’s been denying it. For so long, he’s tried never to think back of the reason as to why Pepper ended their relationship. Not only because it hurts too much that she left, but because he’s afraid she could be right. And he doesn’t want her to be right.
“Yaël, are you wearing clothes?” Steve asked without even turning around or looking up. He was baking some eggs.
But this time, she needed no music. She could just calm down a bit and think about the situation. Like for instance, if she’d called Steve right after calling Fury, she would have been somewhat more aggressive towards him and afterwards, she’d be sorry about that.
“Sure, yes, thank you Katie,” Tony says, and only then does he move away from the window, pointing towards the chair in front of his desk right before sitting down himself. “Please sit, Mr. …” Tony can almost curse. He doesn’t even know the kid’s name yet.
Wanda doesn’t pay too much attention to Tony, instead talking with Peter and making jokes together. For a moment, even Tony had wondered if there’s anything going on between the two, but after asking a very embarrassed Peter about it, the only thing he got in return was a stuttered and panicked answer that contains the message as: ‘we’re just good friends!’, which is maybe better since there’s still that thing between Wanda and Vision.
“Why are you stopping me, Buck? You don’t want me to go?” he asks angrily. At that time another door opens, revealing Wanda in the hallway, looking confused as she sees the two adults talking in the hallway.
So he decides to put on his suit, and swings all the way to the end of the city. From there on, it’s by foot. It would have been his luck if Iron Man would have been flying by, but sadly, the guy hasn’t really been seen for the past week. The very few times the Avengers were called together, Iron Man hadn’t been with them.
A few sandwicheslater, after practicing a bit on the cello, Yaël went to bed. She felt a bit nervous for meeting Mr. X the next day. But the man came to help her, right? The girl sighed as she typed her text to Diego. This man would fire her so hard someday... and then what?
“I’m here, Tony. I’m not letting you go until you’re ready,” Steve returns. Tony nods against Steve’s chest, feeling his breathing slowly even out again. Right when Tony’s about ready to tell him to pull away, another voice comes up.
Steve joins Thor to a secluded room. He squeezes Tony’s shoulder to indicate that he’ll be back. Tony just waves at him.
Swinging through the window of his apartment, Peter lands into the living room while pulling his mask off almost immediately. He’s aware Karen is trying to tell him that Steve is calling him. He doesn’t care, taking off the suit as quickly as he can.
“Shit,” he mutters. Gently, he tries to open his eyes, finding much to his surprise that it’s dark outside.
“OH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, WE TAKE TURNS ALRIGHT?!” Steve suddenly shouts, his face looking like he’s about to explode on the spot. There’s a total silence in the room after this, everybody looking at Steve with a confused, shocked expression.
He doesn’t let it get to him. Because there’s nobody in these woods; he has alarm systems almost everywhere.
“My-uh… I lost somebody I l- my, uh, girlfriend-“ Peter starts, but he never manages to finish the sentence.
“Mr. Lyman! Is there anything you want to share, young man?” the teacher suddenly asks. Harry stops, pulling the comic away and sitting up straight at his seat.
“What? But, why-“ Loki got interrupted by Thor, randomly joining them as he started walking next to Yaël’s other side.
Sirens are heard in the background. The fire-department, police, ambulance… who-ever it is, Tony is not planning on sticking around. He comes back to his feet, grabbing Steve by the shirt and slightly pulling on it. With his free arm, he makes a movement towards Peter as an indication that he needs to follow.
As soon as she picked out some okay-looking sword, he didn’t give her another chance to let her think about her decision and pushed her into the arena. Many lights shone onto her, and almost blinded her. The only thing she could see and hear were the audience, which had to be many, many people, or, uh, creatures.
It was a long search. Tony and Natasha going through the files with Bruce. They infiltrated one base after the other, always coming home empty-handed.
“Actually I didn’t come here to talk about school; I was wondering if maybe you want to hang out tonight? Go see a movie? There’s this Slenderman movie that came out last month but I haven’t gone to see it yet.”
“Ah, isn’t he just the greatest?” Sharon calls out, turning back towards Steve and giving him a sad look. “Too bad everybody here hates him. I’ve been trying to get them to change their mind, but Tony’s just like a grumpy grandpa, if things don’t go the way he wants it he can get a bit… eccentric.”
“Yeah, a daughter. It’s a girl, we called her Zoey,” Francis says, looking proudly at the same picture before putting his phone away. Then he clears his throat and looks back at Peter. “Listen, it’s probably not any of my business, but Stark’s been treating you right, right?”
“I’ll be back in an hour,” Steve assures him in a whisper. Then he moves away, making his way back to the tower. Tony lets out a sigh the moment Steve walks out the door. He turns his head a bit to the side, blinking a few times as he looks out the window.
Peter nods at her thankfully before moving towards May. When she spots him at last, her eyes go wide and she runs up to him until she’s hugging him. Peter lets out a chuckle as his face is pressed against her shoulder, but at the same time he can’t find much more reason for laughing.
“It doesn’t like fire, either,” Gwen adds. Peter closes his eyes, trying to shake the uncomfortable feeling off.
“Excuse me?” Peter asks. After these past weeks at Stark Industries, Peter finds that he’s grown pretty used to having FRIDAY around. She can be quite the sarcastic AI when it comes to it, but she helps him out more often than not, and that should count for something.
Yaël’s smirk instantly disappeared. Great, handle the thing with freaking air, it was precision work. She made the string put the brush back in the bathroom. Then she tried focusing on it to let it fly towards her. Come on, she had done it with the tiles, right? She could do this!
“Stark”, Wilson greets him. There’s no animosity between them, which is alright by Tony. After all, Wilson didn’t know about his parents. The only thing the two of them disagreed on were the accords, and that exactly is why Tony is here, now.
But that’s not a good idea. “He only just finished his latest edition of the Starkbucks. And before you mention the name, we all told him it wasn’t a good idea. He’s insistent.”
His brown eyes followed their movements carefully. He frowned as he was thinking about his next move. This man was known as a high-intelligent person, but Yaël never expected his intelligence to be actually almost visible. The king looked at the people in front of him like they were a chessboard.
“That’s not all, is it?” Steve suddenly asks, eyes resting on Bruce who looks like he just wants to be away from here. Tony swallows through a hard lump in his throat, realizing that this might not be the best news he’ll hear.
There’s some videos on the test he’s undergone. There’s a few therapy sessions, most of them containing Tony’s therapy-glasses (Peter refuses to call it BARF), and even a few where they test his strength. He’s not really surprised when he sees Harry hasn’t lost all the reflexes, as well as the strength he gained from being the Goblin. He’s not
“Open up that reactor of yours, huh?” he asks, and Peter jumps in action, taking the Arc Reactor back from where Mr. Stark dropped it, and then fumbles with it a little bit until it’s open. Instead of taking it over from Peter, Mr. Stark just directs the glowing blue triangle towards the open latch inside the reactor. Peter looks at it with a mouth fallen open, aware that Steve is still standing there and observing as well.
“So how did your day with Peter go yesterday?” Steve asks casually when they’re once again stuck in traffic. Tony, who without thinking had grabbed Steve’s hand during the drive, hums out happily remembering the good day.
He knows he’s not the only one feeling this way; Steve craves the touch just as much. It’s clear in the way his hands grab on to him, digging in his shirt and pulling it over his head without any warning. And while Tony would have hesitated to let anybody see him without anything to cover his chest, he’s not feeling any doubt in letting Steve see the massive circular scar he has on his sternum.
After that, Felicia starts running off towards another building, moving in an elegant way that makes Peter wonders if she’s very agile. She certainly moves that way. Then he pokes Johnny in the side.
“Ah, well, X and Fury told me not to watch the news, fearing it might trouble my mind or whatever their crappy excuse was to keep me out of the world…”
Natasha hums out as she passes her hand through Tony’s hair in a comforting way, reminding him a bit of how his mother used to try and make him feel better. It’s soothing, and even manages to give him a small smile, though on the inside he feels like he’s still just breaking apart.
While she was talking, X was looking at her like he was searching for something, like he was examining her, but he stayed quiet. He only started speaking after she was done explaining her viewings.
Hawkeye is shooting arrows in the Goblin’s direction. The Falcon is still in a direct duel with him. Somewhere, Peter can hear repulsors charging, but upon remembering that Iron Man isn’t here, he figures it must be
So there won’t be any Steve, Natasha, Clint or Sam at the tower tonight. Wanda was let free because of her age. After letting out the sentences, they’ve even made sure she’s got herself her American citizenship and a chance to get back to school. A chance not even Wanda will ignore.
Shit, fuck, fuck! She tried crawling out of the mud. But every scoop of dirt the two guards threw onto her made her fall down again. She wasn’t fast enough to dig herself out again, shredding her nails by trying to remove the mud. It fell on her face, and after few scoops, Yaël couldn’t follow anymore in getting it away from her nose and mouth to breathe. Her chest felt heavy and painful, a squeak left her mouth as soon as breathing became impossible. And as if it wasn’t bad enough yet, it started raining.
And she does eventually, arriving in the room with Bruce by her side, holding a chart in her hand and a serious look on her face. The fact that she took Bruce with her can’t mean much good.
He’s got to make it right. He’d rather do it today, but the fact that Steve sent him back home means that he won’t be convincing Tony today. It’ll have to be tomorrow, Peter states.
“Yeah… every time, Steve seems to stay away for longer periods. It really freaks Dad out because he’s grounded.”
The waiter points them at their table after a quick explanation. The pizzeria isn’t the fanciest of eating places, but it’s got a nostalgic vibe in it. In the background, the typical Italian music is playing. On the walls, aside from more of Steve’s obvious artwork, framed pictures are hanging. One of them is from the current owner’s father, posing for the picture with none other than the man sitting in front of Tony right now.
“Okay, but can somebody tell Steve not to linger too much in the training room? The bed’s too cold without him,” Tony mutters, closing his eyes as he moves himself into a comfortable position. Then, suddenly feeling the phone in his hand again, his eyes open once more. “Oh, wait… Steve isn’t here.”
But then Tony’s gone again and Peter shakes his head. Sure, Tony’s behavior towards him hasn’t changed a bit, not even after figuring out he’s Spider-Man (though he might have become even more over-protective whenever he sees a small bruise on Peter). But with keeping a regular schedule on when he’s at May’s and when he’s at Tony’s, he quickly comes to realize that, whenever he’s not here, Tony’s spending most of his time hidden away in the workshop – or lately just being busy with removing everything Avengers-related back to the Compound. The tower, which has officially been
After school, Ned gets a ride with Peter and Happy to get to Stark Tower. Normally, Harry would have joined as well, but he told them he needed to do something before he arrived. Neither Peter nor Ned ask any questions, since he probably just wants a little moment with MJ before he leaves.
“That Tony could never be like Steve. That Tony isn’t deserving of knowing him. That’s why, at first, the two couldn’t really stand each other. Tony just kept blaming
“Yeah, apparently so,” Peter mumbles out. Another sigh escapes his mouth, and Peter tries to reposition himself into a comfortable position so he can catch up on some sleep.
Peter just nods without looking up again, eyes once more rested onto the pages in front of him. Right now, his parents are exchanging the details of both their work, and they seem to find something mutual in it that they agree to work together. That, and they discuss work during a date. There’s nothing
“Ah, he better not be wooing my little cousin there,” he jokes. Susan chuckles. Reed finally looks up from his phone and blinks as if he hadn’t realized Tony’s standing there.
“It’s just… It’s not something I can just say right here, right now… We need a more… secluded spot. And Steve.”
“Do you tell yourself that in the mirror every morning? Is it a confidence-exercise I had the blessing of never being assigned with?”
“But mooom, I don’t wanna put my pants on!” he whined while climbing out of the sofa. She slapped his butt when he walked off, into the bathroom next to her bedroom.
And so the two of them went back to the gym, and they sparred for almost two hours. After that, Tony returned home, ready to face it after a long conversation with the Captain about taking responsibility for his actions.
! Peter thinks to himself, slapping his skull a couple of times. He’s never really been a person who expresses a lot of sexual interest. So far it’s always been limited to Gwen, and even with MJ he’s never particularly thought about her in that way. Sure, the medication he used to take could give him some… urges… but they always stood separate from attraction. If he would have been drunk, he would have done it with
“Sir, Spider-Man has been spotted in the city, but according to the sensor the suit is still in Peter’s shared apartment with Mr. Storm.”
“Nothing happened, May just took over. You guys can go to sleep now, I’ll take it back over from her when she gets tired.”
“Great! I’m Mr. Stark’s assistant now kind of, so we really work together and stuff, how cool is that?”
Did he really just call MJ ‘honey’? Doesn’t that equal suicide? He can’t imagine MJ liking the idea of pet names at all!
“Alright, I need to find my Dad,” he says after a few seconds. “In my world, I found out Tony Stark is my dad. That’s almost two years ago or so.”
“There’s some powerful weapons in there, things from back in the day where we were still a weapon’s factory! It’s too dangerous in other people’s hands!”
“I’m in an alternate universe…” Peter mutters out, finally understanding what’s going on. This is a universe where Gwen got bit by the Spider – though how she didn’t die because of it, Peter has no idea. In this universe, Peter died at the tower. Because Peter died, Tony never found out about having a son. Tony didn’t keep Stark Tower and sold it much like he had thought about doing back in Peter’s world.
“Well, Barnes here said it’s you, while Clint says it’s Steve,” Sam explains, pointing towards the two men. Tony crosses his arms together, nodding.
“Yeah?” he asks, wondering who it could be. Aunt May usually knocks and then enters the room, so it can’t be her. A small part wishes that it’s Tony, but he knows that’s just wishful thinking. Of course Tony won’t be there to pay him a small visit.
“I CAN’T!” Tony shouts back, grabbing his arms and softly shaking him. Then he lowers his head until the top of his skull is resting against Steve’s chest. “I fucking can’t.”
“Wait a sec,” Yaël huffed “I’m almost finished.” Korg took a few steps forward to look out of the broken window, to the arena.
“Hey little spider, I just made some adjustments to the web shooters. You should head down to the training center downstairs and test them out when you get the chance,” the inventor says, throwing Peter the new web shooters before raising his eyebrows at the sudden realization that they’re not alone here.
some sort of battery, Peter finds. It works on complete clean energy, and it’s almost limitless. Though, clearly, something is not alright with it, since the thing isn’t glowing at all the way it’s supposed to. Finding himself a screw, Peter starts to loosen the top plate to have a look at what’s inside.
One quick look downstairs, and Peter realizes that he, too, isn’t wearing anything. Despite his headache, he gets out a loud gasp that comes close to a shriek. It’s loud enough to wake Yaël, who startles up and gets into a defensive position, ready to start throwing punches. She doesn’t look any better than him.
After letting go of Steve’s hand – he hadn’t noticed he was holding it – Tony leaves the medical floor of the compound, ignoring the other Avengers when they crowd him to ask questions. He’s got a mission, after all.
“Just- don’t say anything,” he mutters out. He turns back towards the door to Peter’s room, hating the fact that he can’t see anything in there. He can hear more footsteps coming up from behind him. It’s probably Rhodey, Nat or Bucky. Or anyone, really. Tony can’t think at all.
“Oh I wish your Uncle were here, he would be so proud of you,” Aunt May continues on. Peter catches the tears in her eyes, and wonders if it really was such a good idea to tell her already. Especially when she starts pressing a few kisses on his forehead and keeps his face in a strong grip to keep him from pulling away.
Peter tries to dial the switch back down, but it seems like he’s too late. Quickly turning to somewhere there isn’t any glass, a blast of energy escapes from the gauntlet, hitting the wall with a loud noise. From the sudden shock, Peter is once again thrown from his seat, finding himself on the floor again, looking up to find dust filling the room.
Peter looks up when Yaël clears her throat. He sees her in the middle of the room, standing up with one hand on her hip and the other holding something in the air, still as naked as the day she was born.
He was greeted by Natasha, who had her arms crossed as she leaned against the wall. There was some worry clear in her eyes.
He tries calling out Karen’s name once more, but nothing comes from it. Peter makes a questioning sound, taking a good look around him before deciding to get lower, maybe get himself under some light. He jumps off the wall, intending to swing his web to a nearby building only to smash against it. Without realizing it, he must have pushed himself off much harder than intended. Rubbing his aching shoulder, Peter sticks himself back up.
And Peter starts explaining his plan to his friend in the middle of being thrown into Venom once again. Harry’s pulled off his glider once or twice, but he always climbs right back up. Felicia and MJ are nowhere to be seen, which is a good thing. What was the girl even thinking, coming back here when she’s hurt the way she is!
A look into the microscope. The result is still not what Tony would have liked it to be. He doesn’t give up, instead starting over and trying a different approach. The trick is not to lose his patience here, which is a hard enough task to do since his patience is pretty much at the verge of dying right at this point.
“Red and gold is your style,” Peter counters. “Besides, you had any luck on that Tritium-case? What did Dr. Octavius do now?”
“He should learn to concentrate. If I can do it, he surely can, too?” Peter tries. “It would be a shame if Dad would remove the serum if it’s something that can keep him healthy.”
“The black goo?” she asks. Peter nods. Then she sighs. “It startled me. I accidentally tipped it over when I bumped into one of your bots. Then it got on me and didn’t come off until I was outside.” Painfully, she tries to shift a bit on the bed.
“Hello?” he asks, seeing a dark figure standing there in the shadows. When he touches down on the roof, the figure takes a few steps forward, coming out of the dark. Peter’s heart skips a beat when he sees who it is, but he does his best to keep his happiness to himself.
Here we are again, earlier than expected once more. Yes, I'm actually feeling even sicker than yesterday. No, that's not the reason I'm posting so quickly. I just have counted out that the Christmas chapter (which is the 40th chapter) would have been posted on the 26th otherwise. So I'm throwing in an extra upload so that Christmas will be celebrated on Christmas, damn it! ^^
“So, you’re hungover?” Yaël blinked a few times when she heard Peter’s voice, making a mental note she had to go to bed early that night.
Tony turns back to the room, seeing Peter sitting on his bed with his head in his hands. He looks like he’s crying, but his shoulders aren’t moving. When Peter’s hands go through his hair, he startles up, looking down at his hands.
“No, it’s alright. Jim has already offered to help me with it,” she says happily. ‘Jim’ is May’s nickname for Rhodey. “The loan you gave me is help enough, Tony.”
“Oh, you haven’t met her yet?” Wade asks. Then he’s finally trying to move from his ice cold prison, but obviously isn’t able to move. “Come on, I want pizza. Yaël, get me out of here!”
“Peter, you’re leaving again?” Tony asks, hurt and worry obvious in his voice. Peter looks back at him, giving him a light smile.
Peter falls asleep again after Dr. Cho’s nurse injected some more painkillers. As he closes his eyes, he still has his aunt and his father holding his hands, and a smile on his lips.
Tony rubs his eyes, yawning a bit before nodding. He leans his head a bit to the side so that it’s resting on Peter’s for a few short seconds before he finally pries himself loose of his son. Swiftly, May takes place on the exact spot Tony has only just departed from.
“Move over, I’m going to sit there,” he says, pointing at the spot between Peter and Steve. None of them complains, knowing that Tony like to be in the center. Once he’s seated, Peter leans to the side of the couch, throwing his legs over Tony’s. Steve puts his arm over Tony’s shoulder.
“Is Steve there, then?” he tries then, not having mentioned the man since London. Tony stays quiet for a long time. “Dad?”
.” Rejected again, Yaël sighed. Great, this way she’d never be able to pay her bills. Well, she couldn’t even pay the psychiatrist, the one who should help her getting her shit back together actually gave her even more stress. She had been counting her saved money again and again, but it simply wasn’t enough.
Sure, he could do that had it just been Johnny kissing him shortly before Peter pulled back. The fact that Peter had unknowingly returned the kiss and was somehow kind of into it as well makes it even ten times worse.
“How would you know that?” she asked him after she remembered he had said something. The man just shrugged as an answer. “Okay, then who are you?”
“YOU DID WHAT?!” he hisses at him, trying to shout in a whisper. Tony takes a deep breath. Here’s to a whole lot of explaining.
just lost my Aunt. The only person that was still alive who used to look after me when no-one else would. The person I introduced Peter to, because I wanted them to bond. And only when he just got her, he lost her again.”
Peter nods, closing his eyes once more as if he’s about to fall asleep. May leans back in her chair after that, giving Tony a worried look. He, too, feels nothing but dread inside of him.
I'm not really sure what I should say. It feels like the beginning of the story wrote out easily, the middle part became a bitch to write, and the ending went by easily again! There was a moment of writer's block that I couldn't get myself out of, I think. But, I'm glad it's finished at last!
“What’s your name?” Peter asks without thinking about it, looking into her hypnotizing green eyes. She waits until she’s climbed down completely, hooking her legs around his and putting a hand on his shoulders.
Tony freezes on the spot. He wouldn’t have expected Steve to just flat out say it like that, like he didn’t care at all. Carefully, Tony looks back up at him, trying to catch his expression.
“And then there was that attack, and you got separated from us,” Aunt May then continues. “We looked everywhere, but all we heard was ‘Iron man is here, Iron Man is here!’, as if his presence should have meant that we were all saved.”
Yaël was glad that her other wounds from the past months had healed completely, like the burn Nilla had caused. But here in space, there wasn’t a Dr. Cho with cool stuff that could make the wounds healing quick and cleanly. Loki snorted.
“Oh, impolite to mentor? That deserves a mention in here,” Tony bluffs, and Peter quickly pulls the paper out from under his hands and tries to run away with it.
Steve sighs softly, but shrugs and sits down while taking the first page between his fingers. Thor, while continuing his pacing, starts reciting the text word per word, not missing even a little bit of it. He doesn’t stumble, doesn’t stutter, doesn’t lose his flow. Steve has to admit that he’s really impressed.
“That’s too bad,” Steve says, that being the first thing coming out of his mouth since they’ve exited the Penthouse. Tony doesn’t respond, not knowing what to say to it exactly. They get out of the elevator to walk towards one of Tony’s cars. There’s no debate on who sits where. Bruce takes a seat in the back, next to Peter, while Steve sits down in the passenger seat next to Tony. After he’s driven the car out of the garage, Tony takes Steve’s hand into his own and just holds it during the drive.
of Wakanda (aka Shuri, sister of T’Challa), Tony figures that even for his son having a love-life is complicated.
It takes about an hour due to the old technology and the lack of internet in the place, but eventually, he does think he’s got it right. Giving FRIDAY the instruction to go on, Tony waits patiently for the plates to go up and reveal the train wagon.
“This is never going to end, is it?” Bruce asks next to him, snickering a bit when Clint turns the arrow again and Bucky needs to put her right foot on red, causing for his ass to be pressed right in Steve’s face. Tony can’t even bring it in himself to be jealous at it, instead practically laughing his ass off.
Peter’s head turns to the side, searching for the source of that sound. It comes from the door that Peter suspects is Mr. Stark’s bedroom. Immediately, he starts walking forward, only to stop in his tracks immediately afterwards.
Just as a warning; Peter's REALLY sick. As in with all the nasties along with it. And even though I'm a nurse, I'm still not a doctor and I wouldn't know too much about spider bites reactions or radiation sickness, nor about any forms of brain diseases or seizures. I performed MRI scans, but that doesn't mean I can interpret them!
“Watch out!” a low voice says angrily. Peter looks up, seeing a tall man standing there with his phone pressed against his ear. Said man is no-one other than
Or, as normal as they could be. Nothing in her life has really been normal since Peter got bitten by a radioactive spider. Especially because Peter’s just about crap in keeping a secret.
“How did you get here?” he asks, not angry but more curiously. Peter opens his mouth to answer, but then FRIDAY suddenly opens up the door for them, allowing them in.
White damp comes out of the tubes, indicating that they’ve been opened. In the middle of the room there’s a device Barnes seem to actively avoid looking at. Seeing it from a bit closer, Tony figures it must be what they’ve used to control this man’s mind.
After confirming to her question on whether or not he’s coming for dinner in twenty minutes, Peter hides away in his room. His eyes are still stinging, and his throat is still burning.
has someone there who he wants to spend time with. He should ask Yaël, since she seems to know much about him.
“N-no-“ Yaël couldn’t grasp what Steve was trying to tell her. Weren’t they the Avengers, Earth’s mightiest heroes? Okay, there were problems, but Yaël didn’t expect them to actually start fighting each other.
“Sure, kid. As long as they don’t make me angry,” he says with a wink. Peter throws him a thumb’s up and then hurries out into his bedroom.
Thinking back of it, when he tried mentioning it to Tony last time during dinner, all the man had told him was not to get himself into that mess. Now, Peter could listen and stay away, or he could actually try and figure out what is happening here, no?
Through his coughing, Peter looks back up to the sky, where he sees the Goblin and Falcon engaged in a battle of their own. Now, completely distracted from Peter, the Goblin’s smile is gone and he’s giving it all he’s got to rid himself of these heroes trying to defeat him.
“Who on Earth-?” Tony mutters to himself, turning the doll around but not at all remembering how it could possibly get here. Unless… was he somehow brought into the future? Or did he lose his memory? He’s not exactly sure.
Yaël started making links. So, her mother probably got executed somehow. Well, if this psycho was telling the truth anyways.
It’s not that he’s hesitating about this; if anything the only thing he’s hesitant about is whether or not he’s organized something good here. Will Steve even like this all? Or would he think Tony’s attempt at diving back into the ‘good old days’ were too bold?
she asks kindly. Peter lets out a long breath, in one part not really thinking it’s a good idea to go patrolling again. On the other hand, though, having two other people tagging along with him – two people with unmeasurable powers, too – could literally stop him from doing anything stupid.
“Yeah, I remember,” May returns, shuddering at the thought. She drops her bag at the nurse’s station and grabs a paper with the list of patients. Indeed, besides the new names that weren’t there before she left for the weekend, the still familiar name of ‘Otto Octavius’ is still written out neatly. “I can’t imagine how it’ll be for him to wake up,” she admits.
“You could take the blood for the sample right away. I’ll try to take care of the other sample right after that.”
“NOW JOHNNY!” he shouts. Or he thinks he does. He’s not sure about that at all. He doesn’t hear himself. Even when the machine is supposed to be turned off, Peter’s ears are still pretty much ringing. All he can do is watch how Johnny flames up and starts circling around Venom, putting him into a prison made of fire. The circle he forms around him becomes smaller and smaller, until there’s about no more space for Venom to move.
“What do you mean?” she asked instead while getting up and looking around for some kind of exit or window. Korg followed her while he was chattering. “Well, you’re a gladiator now, just like I am, and you’re purpose here is, uh... being a gladiator.”
Which is why he sought distance rather than company. Instead of moving in, he explained that he wanted to figure out this modern world. Stark accepted the excuse rather than pressing him for another answer. Steve figured he simply asked out of sheer politeness.
“Is it an AI? I know you don’t want to share FRIDAY, but I can be happy with WEDNESDAY as well, though maybe slightly less gloomy.”
Peter glanced at Yaël, like he was waiting for her to freak out and scold him, but she didn’t. Instead, she kept her mouth shut and signed him to keep on talking. Peter looked a bit confused, but resumed his story.
Hilde turned to the window and was quiet for a moment, sunken in her own thoughts and memories. “You know, it really saddens me to hear she passed away… I liked her a lot, she was a good friend of mine and was one of the last of us,” And with that, she poured down the rest of the bottle and gave Yaël another bottle to drink together.
Bad press. Great, this couldn’t be worse. He wonders what excuse they’ll bring up this time. A sudden sickness befell him? Or are they going to tell them the truth? Tony can just see his company’s failure at that thought. No, thanks.
And that’s when it happens. At first when all the lights on the ceiling start leaning towards the source. Otto starts typing something on the computer. In the corner of his eyes, Tony can see Peter looking up in surprise, as well. All the women’s jewels start flying off. Their supposedly gold necklaces fly right into the reaction as if a big magnet pulled them along. It’s quickly followed by people’s watches. When Tony’s watch, which contains the gauntlet, comes flying off as well, he figures it’s enough.
“Call Bruce, please,” she finally says, clearing her throat while she waits for Bruce’s face to appear on the screen next to her. It doesn’t take too long before he picks up.
Steve just grunts without raising his head. Harry finally has his coffee and takes a seat as well, grinning widely upon seeing Captain America in this situation.
Without words, he carefully pulled her out of her clothes. When Yaël fiddled with the bandages to get them off, she noticed he was staring at her. She looked up.
"Uh, no, Polaroid is a brand. Besides, it's outdated as well," Tony mutters, sticking out his tongue when he tries to put two small wires together. He jumps back when it suddenly sparks. "That's not supposed to do that."
“Your dad’s not really the best form of example now, is he?” he returns. Tony blinks once before shrugging. When he directs his attention back to the box, he finds if filled with nothing but journals. “That what you’re looking for?”
And the day started out pretty good, too. Tony remembers waking up in the morning, finding the sunlight shining on Steve’s face, seeing the man sleeping in for once in a while. It’s rare that Tony’s up earlier than he is, but Tony kind of likes it. He had reached out his hand, put it on Steve’s cheek, and watched and waited until he woke up.
Of course, Steve doesn’t agree, twisting every word he says and countering them with his point of view. That’s pretty much the punchline of their relationship, isn’t it?
“Well, heck, no, you need to fix this. Stark doesn’t even like me! But still, this needs to be fixed. You really fucked this shit up, Stark!”
Once they get into the room, it turns out Peter’s sleeping again. He’s out of his clothes, wearing a blue gown instead. In his arm there’s an IV running, on his finger a saturation reader. Tony sighs, letting go of Steve and putting his stuff on the chair next to Peter’s bed so he can walk forward and kiss his son gently on his forehead.
Tony wants to say his name, but the words don’t come out. His mouth is too dry. Or is it that his mind is wiped?
“I suppose it’s time to leave,” Bruce adds to that. He takes Peter by the shoulder and nods to Vision. “Where’s the exit?”
But, that’s the thing right there; all he’s created about Peter is just the shell. He sees it in Peter’s nose, and his eyes. He sees it in the small freckles on his cheeks, or in his smile. But that’s about all he’s done to create Peter.
There’s a small city blooming up. It looks nice, though not at all how Peter would have expected Asgard to be like back on their realm. Bruce, too, seems surprised.
“Peggy can’t help you anymore, not this time,” Steve adds calmly, and Mr. Stark stands still again, face suddenly drained from all the anger and now instead showing shock. When his mouth opens, it seems like he wants to say something again, but then he closes it again, letting out a deep breath and lowering his gaze.
There are people surrounding the wreck that was once their car, looking worried and taking pictures. Some of them seem to be making phone calls, while others finally decide to help Peter and Yaël out of the wreck.
Followed by a street name and number. She didn’t notice all the spelling mistakes, as she was wasted herself. This was genius, she was still pissed off at him. She was so going to join him at this party, to tell him her thoughts about him and to run away before Charles was able to send someone to check on her. Who knows how long Peter had been laughing with her ignorance. He didn’t like her, she didn’t doubt that anymore. Who would like the girl that destroyed the city?
“Of course, you did,” Loki let out a bit dryly. And with that, he pulled his knives and slid through the first zombie that stormed towards him.
Steve eventually lets go of him and pulls away as well, watching how Tony comes to sit up. Both breathing heavily, Steve tries desperately to catch Tony’s eyes while Tony does his best to avoid Steve’s.
“Thanks for bringing me home,” MJ tells him, probably not having heard what Peter just said. She kisses him on the cheek one more time before turning her back to him and heading to her door. With a wink, she closes it behind her, leaving Peter on the porch with only his brain to keep him company.
“Peter was there when the Green Goblin killed his girlfriend, Gwen,” Tony starts. “He tried to keep his distance from her because he knew she would follow him everywhere otherwise. And in the end she did. He kept on blaming himself for it. He had nightmares about the whole thing for months. Once he almost broke another intern’s arm back at the tower because he had a panic attack.”
“Okay, just a few seconds, alright? We do not need to see the whole thing!” Sam reminds the two of them. Clint waves off the comment.
“That’s about right, yes,” Dr. Cho says with a smile, though there’s something in her expression that Peter can’t place. Confused, Peter frowns in a sudden fear that she’s going to bring him bad news. “Just take off the shirt and I’ll take care of it right away.”
“You’re not healing as quickly as Steve, but your suture shouldn’t be looking like this yet. It’s truly fascinating.”
“Heya, guys! Everytin’ cool?” the guy asks. Tony’s often unsure on how to call him, but he keeps it with LL. He’s
“In some cases, acute liver failure is treated without the need for transplant. In most cases, though, transplant
But Natasha took Steve’s hand while he was trying to walk away. Her cold skin against his felt weird, but not unpleasant. Right when she was about to open her mouth, the elevator opened up, showing Pepper walking inside as she took off her high heels and loosened her hair.
Tony groans, having forgotten all about the tritium and the Octavius-stuff that happened yesterday. Steve lets out a small chuckle, pulling him back until they’re both lying on their sides.
The higher he gets, the more nervous he becomes. This is not what’s supposed to happen. Worried, he tries all he can to struggle free. His mind travels back to Harry, to the last time he’s been carried into the sky like this.
“Tony, get the hell out of here!” he shouts. In his distraction, one of Peter’s arms frees itself and Bruce gets himself a fist in the face. The man takes a few steps back, pressing his fingers against his nose while bowing forward.
“You have to be kidding me!” Yaël said flabbergasted. How was he not gone yet?! Korg pushed the button he found and freed Loki from the shocks.
Steve shakes his head, despite the fact that Tony can’t see him. They run straight into a forest after a while, but Natasha keeps on knowing the way.
She’s right. Dick leaves quite a mess in his workspace, but Tony figures he’s quite the same on that part. It takes them about ten minutes to locate the set. There are needles, more vials, a clamping band and many more stuff.
“Oh my god,” May calls out, tears already starting to form in her eyes. Steve throws an arm over her shoulder and holds her close to his side, for which Tony is grateful since he doesn’t think he would have been able to comfort her.
Tony then reaches for his back pocket, taking out the vibranium ring he’s had made years ago just for this very occasion. When he holds it in front of him, showing it to Steve, he looks at it a bit sheepishly. Then he puts a hand on the table to keep himself stable while he drops down on one knee. His left hand taking Steve’s, the other one holding up the ring.
Norman stops his movement, now instead staring at where Mary is touching him on the arm. Tony is pretty sure that he’s frowning, though he can only see his back. Good, Mary’s making sure that he’s not turning around.
When none comes, he realizes that the music is probably too loud for anybody to hear them. Peter then shrugs and opens the door himself. With no invitation granted towards him, Peter just walks inside, seeing more people from his school dance on every available space they can find. He shouldn’t be too shocked that most of them are already drunk and mostly just rubbing against each other instead of dancing.
“Because…” Tony sighs, putting a hand on his forehead while he thinks about how he’s going to explain it. If anything, Steve likes the story straight, no jokes, no excessive details. “Because we are where I’m from.”
“Not yet, Steve,” Tony says, passing his hand over Steve’s bare chest and rubbing circles over his skin. “If I’m not wrong, it would be your first time, so we might want to keep that for a special occasion.”
The Goblin… as it turns out, Falcon and War Machine failed to catch the guy, meaning that he’s still wandering around somewhere, doing who knows what! It’s no wonder Peter’s feeling so paranoid right now, since Harry – err, the Goblin – seems to have taken a special interest in getting Peter out of the picture.
“Th-thank you Mr. Stark,” Peter says. After finally managing to put everything away, he accepts the hand Tony had held out, and shakes it.
Oh, Tony wishes he could say ‘yes’, but after Leipzig, the chances of Steve being allowed to come home are limited. He’s deliberately ran away from the law, meaning that he’s going to be searched everywhere. The moment they catch him, they’ll just put him in the Raft along with the others. Another shiver passes through Tony at the idea that they’re all stuck there.
Yaël tried ignore her own frustration during the past few days. She still had no answer to where she came from. X had to be busy or simply forgot about her, because he never called back and Yaël didn’t dare to stalk him about it. So waiting for a dream was all she could do, hoping the dream would give her the answer of course.
In truth, the wound is already more healed than it should have been in the past week. Since Peter’s at the compound almost daily, Dr. Cho looks it over right before he gets to Tony, and since she’s not allowed to share anything about it, Peter’s pretty sure nobody is going to ask questions.
“Me too. And hey, who knows, maybe I can come back to school soon? Finish the education? Go to college, afterwards?”
Peter shouldn’t be too surprised that Johnny’s lips are very warm. His chest bursts out in a strong, overwhelming feeling he can’t place. His hands hang awkwardly next to his body, unsure of what he’s supposed to do with them.
“Don’t try to move, sweety,” Aunt May’s voice suddenly says. Against her advice, Peter turns his head to his left, finding his Aunt sitting there, looking worried. When she squeezes his hand, he realizes she must have been holding it the entire time. “You had a metal pin in your back that punctured your spleen and caused for a lot of internal blood-loss. But they discovered it quickly and they managed to stitch it back up.”
Like that wasn’t bad enough yet, the scenario got repeated. Peter appeared up high and started tumbling down again…and again, and again. She was frozen in place. Every scream, sob, tear she wanted to let out, seemed to be nonexistent. Like this chimera, caused by the implosion of her powers, took away her right to show her feelings. It was a never-ending torture. Yaël saw another shade appear next to Peter and she had a terrible feeling about it.
Peter stands next to MJ, who has put her straightened hair into a messy bun (even messier than before since it doesn’t seem to stay up the way she wants it to) and is wearing a faded Simpsons-apron. She’s already taken off the make-up that was put on her and changed back into her normal clothes. Peter, on the other hand, didn’t get changed.
“You two are obnoxious,” Peter mutters back, jumping off his stool and getting his bag off the ground. “I’m patrolling tonight. See you later!”
“Easy enough, I just lift it up right under my nose,” he says showing to her how he pulls up the mask slightly. MJ lets out a laugh at the funny sight of it. Peter sticks out his tongue, pressing the bowl against his lips to shield away the lower side of his face. MJ is perceptive enough after all.
His phone vibrates in his pocket. He sighs, fishing it out and giving his screen a look. When he sees it’s Johnny inviting him along for another party, Peter rolls his eyes and doesn’t answer. He leaves the phone on his bed while he gets up. His ribs still hurt, otherwise he would have been doing some exercises to keep himself busy. He wonders if he could swing out of the tower and head back to the apartment. It’s at least better than to stay here and listening to the couple of the year arguing their ears off.
She’s about ready to get in another plot with the guys when she walks in to the common room and sees Sam and James talking to each other, clearly discussing something. Without listening to it, she sits herself down on the border of the couch, letting her legs rest over James’ and taking his hair into her hands. At least he lets her do her thing whenever she feels the urge to start braiding his hair together.
He probably shouldn’t. Tony keeps his mouth shut, watching her walk off again with a great tension still in the air. Behind him, the kids get up from their seats and start heading to the door.
“TALK!” Peter finds himself shouting before he realizes it. “That’s always been your issue, it actually still kind of is right now in my universe. You two never talk, and whenever you’re arguing, you always just try to fix it with actions rather than with words!”
“Oh, you’ll love it,” Tony quickly assures him, pulling away from the wall and picking out his cellphone.
They’re sated, satisfied, full with that feeling of bliss and joy. But they’re not alright, and they don’t need an expert to see that.
Apparently, his other friends were better than her. Whatever, right? But Yaël couldn’t help feeling angry about it. She felt like she wasn’t good enough for him. Yes, yes, the kid was busy, school and the internship with his fucking new father.
