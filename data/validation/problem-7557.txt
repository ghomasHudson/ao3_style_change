Tony can’t help laughing. “You know, you seemed to take the whole situation in stride.”
“Ugh,” the man said. “Feel like shit.”
“I’m tempted to assume that you have some kind of freaky foresight, Cap,” he said casually.
Tony grinned as he leaned on Steve’s side to kiss him. “Sounds good to me.”
Tony moved both of his hands to grasp the back of Steve’s head. “Yeah, that’s right.
Steve turned to him with a small smile despite the seemingly dire situation. “Just takes me a lot less time to suit up.”
“Yeah?” Tony’s content to enjoy how utterly overwhelmed Steve is until he feels a large, warm hand around his own dick. “Oh,
“Such a good omega,” he murmurs as he pushes his face into the juncture of Tony’s shoulder and neck, nuzzling him.
“Holy shit, you got it on with
“Tell me you’re close, Steve,” Tony mumbled against his lips.
Steve felt his cock twitch just at the thought of it. Generally, Tony declaring he had any plans in the context of the bedroom led to very good nights for Steve.
Steve shook his head, though that didn’t help clear his mind at all. He still wasn’t sure why Tony sounded so worried. A path of burning pleasure seared across his shoulders and his chest as the creature’s legs continued to wriggle against his skin. The pleasure continued down his back as the creature continued its path downward. It was like a really good massage multiplied by a hundred.
Tony’s expression only further drove the point home as he looked Steve up and down. “I will never, ever get tired of that.”
With all of the precome making it stick to his skin, his boxers were proving to be difficult to push down.
Steve went for the honest approach. “I mean, I was pretty heavily drugged at the time.” He shrugged. He was suddenly conscious of how he was wearing gym shorts that didn’t leave much to the imagination. It usually wasn’t a problem when he was sparring with Natasha, who was always polite about not pointing things like this out. But with Tony… Well, he hoped Tony was too worked up to notice. “It’s just, I think Bruce was right that the alien wasn’t actually hostile. So it’s not like it hurt me.”
Steve glances down at his khaki slacks and the old leather shoes he’d salvaged with leather restorer as he considers the man’s words. It isn’t the end of the world, but it’s definitely disappointing.
Tony blinks a few times. Right. He’s stuck in an elevator. Which is a bad thing. People are coming to rescue them.
“O-oh…” Steve hears himself say in response. Like this, there’s no question about what the intention is. Tony’s entrance already looks a bit loose and ready—like he’s well into his heat. Steve distantly wonders how Tony got through the day like this. The question hardly matters to him as he moves closer, however. All he can think about is sliding into that slick heat. He settles his hands on Tony’s ass.
Meanwhile, the creature’s countless other legs were constantly fondling him from his perineum to his balls. As its other end hung in the air above him, its body undulated against his groin.
The look of concern only deepened. “If you say so…” The man reached out toward Tony. “Anyway, my name’s Steve. How about you?”
Steve was about to reply when it hit him—did the whole team actually see them like that? “A married couple? Really?”
Once he’s finished, Tony’s already sweating. He knows it’s necessary to clean the wound, but it sure as hell isn’t pleasant.
He hadn’t even really known what to expect when he signed up. He’d ended up being assigned to this tiny village somewhere in south Japan, yet despite growing up a city boy, he’d settled in nicely. The townspeople seemed to treat them as some kind of foreigner mascot; he was pretty sure by now that he knew everyone in the small town.
The pressure seemed to stabilize as Steve exhaled heavily. He thought back to the diagram he’d seen a few days ago and realized just what the object must look like. Even with the ample amount of preparation he’d had, though, this was a tight fit. He grunted as what be an egg-shaped object continued to push until suddenly the pressure was gone as it passed through the tight ring of muscle. He gasped as he felt it slip inside.
Tony stared at the scene on the screen in a mix of mute horror and something else he didn’t want to admit to quite yet. JARVIS assured him that the readings of Steve’s vitals that he was seeing did not indicate distress. Rather, he seemed to be experiencing intense sexual arousal. Then again, he didn’t need to read Steve’s vitals to know that.
To Steve’s surprise, Tony’s cheeks seemed a bit flushed, too. Since when did Tony Stark blush?
the best part.” Tony sounded very proud of himself.
Tony shrugs. “Well, yeah. Pretty sure there’s a bunch of rules about not dating employees.” One corner of his mouth turns up.
Tony shrugs. “Looks like it.”
Steve doesn’t look convinced but doesn’t say anything. Instead, he starts a slow march through the snow. It’s knee deep by this point, and Tony notes as he looks around that Steve’s right: it’s snowing and the cloudy sky above seems to promise even more.
“That’s fine as long as I bring the rest of the team in on this. That way we all can be prepared next time.”
Tony doesn’t miss the way Steve’s expression softens when his gaze focuses back on Tony.
Tony turned away and crossed his arms. “Yeah…” He glanced toward the gym’s large windows on the far wall. “I just wanted to make sure you didn’t get hurt. Nothing to be embarrassed about, Cap.”
Tony was drunk. He was so very,
Tony used one arm to brace himself against the armrest and the other to hold Steve’s cock in place. He gave Steve a sly, lascivious smile before sinking down slowly.
Now, though? Who knew. Tony was avoiding him for a reason that Steve couldn’t quite figure out. Was it guilt?
“You ever play a UFO catcher game before?” Tony asked as he walked up to one of the cases.
“Sounds like it’s something we should try again some time, huh?”
“Leave me alone, Buck,” Steve tries.
Tony grinned and reached a hand up to cup Steve’s cheek, forcing Steve to look back at him. “I’ve got a plan, Steve. A plan to finally satisfy your super sex drive.”
“Is that what I think it is?”
The creature’s legs pushed against the tight muscle of his entrance. The cool slick from earlier coated the legs pushing into his ass, easing the way. At first they were just teasing at the muscle, getting it to gradually loosen. Steve let out a groan of relief when they finally pressed in. He rocked back and opened his legs wider while crying out shamelessly for more.
In any case, the man was clearly out for the night and without somewhere to stay. He hadn’t found a wallet or any identifying information on the man, and his clearly very advanced cell phone was locked to a fingerprint. The few moments of lucidity he’d gotten out of the man didn’t give him much to go on, either.
Steve pulls back so that he can fix Tony with an incredulous look. “It is?”
Steve slides his hand back from Tony’s waist to caress the curve of his belly. Tony shudders at the sensation against his sensitive, stretched skin. “It’s a lot,” he answers softly.
Tony’s expression only turned more troubled. “Steve, even if it wasn’t hostile…” And then, much to Steve’s horror, Tony’s gaze drifted lower.
“I’ve been thinking about something.”
“It did,” Steve says softly, and god, that tone goes straight to Tony’s poor heart. Steve’s brow creases with worry. “You aren’t uncomfortable?”
“No more sake,” he mumbled.
“Coming right up,” Tony assured him with a pat to his arm before he dashed off to the mini fridge that he kept stocked in the workshop.
“What? Because he didn’t know who you were?”
Steve agrees, but he’d rather not give Bucky more fuel. He pushes away from the table and stands up. “I’m gonna go for a walk.”
Tony was in Bruce’s lab again, which in itself wasn’t anything out of the ordinary. What was strange was how the lab’s alarms were going off. His first thought was to ask JARVIS to summon his armor until he heard something or someone from the next room over. He headed in that direction. The rest of the lab was in a surreal haze as he walked through it.
“You are so hot when you get bashful over this stuff, you know that?”
“You okay?”
Tony woke up gradually in the way even his partially awake brain associated with hangovers. Groaning, he turned over only to hit something hard. That was odd… He was reluctant to open his eyes considering the pounding headache, but something was definitely off. Despite all of the weirdness, though, he was on something soft and he didn’t feel as bad as he expected to feel, all things considered.
The creature responded by turning its antennae toward Steve, which tickled when they touched his bare arms. He couldn’t help it, he started laughing—harder than he had in a long time. Next thing he knew, he was on his back on the floor, still laughing, the creature crawling along his arm. It still tickled, but as what he assumed was the creature’s head crept closer, the nature of the tickling sensation started to change.
They make slow, but steady progress through the gradually deepening snow.
As Steve left the examination room, he started wondering exactly what might be going on in Tony’s head right now. If there was one thing he’d learned in the months he’d worked with the man, though, it was that such a question was one of the universe’s greatest mysteries.
“Giving you the best orgasms of your life,” Tony said distractedly as he turned to a side table with what looked like medical implements on it. “This is 100% tailored to your comfort.” Tony gestured at the apparatus, which was set close to the ground now.
“A long day? It’s the morning, Tony.” Bruce leaned closer to the screen. “Wait, have you even slept?”
The man throws his head back and moans. “
He wasn’t sure how he could ever look Steve in the eye again after this without spontaneously combusting. Because despite how horrifying the whole alien incident had been, Tony couldn’t get over just how
Somehow, Steve had almost forgotten in light of everything else going on. He did as he was told and leaned back on his elbows to give Tony access to his ass. He could only imagine what he looked like right now, with the end of the plug visible between his ass cheeks. Just the thought made his ears feel like they were on fire.
The whole situation feels surreal as Steve closes the distance between them. He reaches down for the first button on his shirt, hesitating. He looks down to see that the other man is already working on his belt. His mind made up, Steve quickly unbuttons his shirt and untucks it from his pants. He wastes no time removing it and then moving onto his undershirt. The whole time, he can smell the sweet scent ripening in response to his own arousal.
might work?”
“What if there was a way to help you heal up faster, so you could get us out of here and not have to worry about an infection?”
In the meantime, Tony tries in vain to connect with F.R.I.D.A.Y. Seems like the snow storm is making it hard to access any satellites. And they’re probably up in Saskatchewan for all he knows, so it’s not like civilization is likely to be closeby. Just his luck.
“Let me at least help you up there. We can figure it out from there.”
It’s a beautiful Saturday morning outside and usually Steve would’ve gone out jogging by now. Instead, he’s lying on the couch and trying not to think about just how screwed he is.
Chuckling, Steve turned his face back toward Tony’s thigh. It wasn’t long before Tony’s fingers against his scalp lulled him back to sleep. His last thought was how lucky he was to have someone as ridiculous, wonderful, and brilliant as Tony Stark in his life.
“Lift your hips for a second.”
Steve struggled in his bonds and glanced up in Natasha in disbelief. “What the hell?”
Bucky sighs. “Oh, please. I see how hard you work. Don’t think I don’t appreciate what you do for me. But come on, Steve. Everyone deserves a break.”
Moving seemed like far too much effort at the moment, too. His muscles felt like liquid, yet heavy at the same time. He was content to just lie there and let himself be, for once. Tony’s fingers carded through his hair gently, and it felt so good it traveled all the way through him. He groaned as his toes curled under the sheets.
“Sounds good,” Tony mumbles as he starts to drift off. They still have a lot to talk about. For one, how the hell they’re going to get out of this blizzard. Tony also wonders what they are to each other, now. And, well, Steve’s bizarre way of saving his teammate’s lives requires thorough investigation. For now, though, Tony is content to slip into a restful sleep, warm and safe in the arms of a man he trusts. A man he loves.
The last two took a bit longer to push out, but with Tony’s assistance and his other hand on Steve’s dick keeping him hard, Steve managed one more orgasm just as the last one passed by his prostate. He was so overwhelmed by this point that he didn’t realize he’d come until he glanced down to see Tony’s hand still on his cock, dripping with his own release.
Next thing he knows, Steve is kneeling by his side. “You okay?”
“Goodnight,” Steve murmured into the cramped space of the sleep capsule before reaching up to turn off the light.
Tony walks past him and heads for the couch. As Steve watches him, he can’t help but notice how ridiculous Tony looks in the backdrop of his apartment. His sharp button-up shirt and slacks combo clashes against the dull wallpaper. Even his shiny, no doubt expensive shoes look wrong on the old, fading carpet.
“You still with me?” Steve asks as he runs a soothing hand along Tony’s lower back.
Honestly, he wasn’t sure what to think upon seeing the setup that Tony had been hyping up for the past week. It looked like a cross between the examination tables he’d gotten used to in SHIELD medical crossed with a dentist’s chair. It also had a bunch of crazy and quite frankly intimidating attachments built onto it.
Steve blinks a few times before nodding.
“Isn’t this a bit much?” he asked, feeling a bit uneasy as Tony strapped his arms in.
“Speaking of going, um… do you need to head back to your hotel?”
Tony answers, “Undersuit material makes sure nothing gets stuck to the skin that shouldn’t.”
“Well, shit,” Tony said to himself as he made out the words ‘hotel.’ Maybe things were looking up after all. He remembered being told that his train pass could also be used to pay for some hotels around town. Maybe he’d be able to at least find somewhere to pass out for the night that wasn’t the pavement.
“Oh, fuck,” he groans as the constant current of pleasure hits another peak. He has to grab the railing by his side to hold himself up. He’s never felt anything like this before, even during one of his rare ruts. It’s like he’s losing his mind, and the more he gives in, the more he enjoys it. “Y-you okay?” he asks.
“I don’t have to eat one, do I?”
He was panting now, too. It felt like he’d run a hundred miles without stopping. He was pretty sure that Tony was saying something, but the words sounded far away. His attention was instead drawn to sudden movement above him. The head of the creature was rubbing against his cheek.
felt amazing, right now. He’d never felt so great in his life.
Steve knew that voice, though he hadn’t heard it in over 72 hours. He couldn’t resist a sigh as a familiar figure entered his peripheral vision.
“I believe there is a 96.7% chance that Dr. Banner was not convinced by your assurances, Sir,” JARVIS intoned politely.
Tony resists the urge to whistle, instead just staring in appreciation. Steve’s cock is fairly sizable and stands up impressively to almost reach his navel. There’s already precome beading at the head, and Tony’s flattered to think that’s for him.
“Good to hear.”
Steve nodded against Tony’s hand. It had been a lot of work, but it was worth it.
He groaned when Tony raised his gloved hand to his mouth to lick off his come. “Mmm, that was so sexy to watch, honey. You have no idea.”
He does what he can to make it easier for Steve to remove his boots. As Steve gradually works his way upward, Tony remembers how he’d shown Steve where the latches in the armor were so that he could help in case of an emergency. And here they are in such a situation.
“I’ll tell you when to start pushing.” Tony glanced up at a screen somewhere above Steve’s head and seemed to be counting to himself. A few moments later, he started saying the numbers out loud. “In five seconds: four, three two, one… Start pushing now.”
good kisser.
Steve nodded again. He
“You did such a good job,” Tony crooned as he ran a hand up Steve’s leg. “Now just lie back and relax. I’ll take care of everything from here.”
He tried to curl up before he remembered the restraints holding his arms and legs. Instead, he turned his head to the side and shut his eyes. His orgasm seemed to be going on forever as he whimpered into the table’s surface.
“About how Nat and Bruce were conspiring against us.”
A faint rustling noise in the corner of the room caught his attention. It seemed to be coming from the other side of a large cabinet. Steve quickly approached the other side of it, shield up.
“What the hell is an ALT?” Tony asked as he sipped at the coffee they’d ordered.
“Assistant language teacher,” Steve explained patiently.
His unease must have been written all over his body language because Tony moved to close the distance between them.
,” Steve cried out as he strained in his bonds.
“You basically are!” Tony’s hand moved away from his cock and up toward his chest instead. Steve swallowed his moan of protest at the loss. That would just encourage Tony to keep being stubborn. “Haven’t had the time to work on that fucking machine I mentioned a while ago, but the design in my head is complete.”
going to get an erection while talking to Bruce, what the hell. Glancing back up at the screen, he gave Bruce a lopsided smile. No point in putting on an innocent act.
The terrible joke was worth it to watch Steve almost choke on his melon soda. Tony couldn’t help a soft smile as he gazed at Steve over his fries. He was probably giving him some serious bedroom eyes, and he couldn’t help it. Passing the time with a regular person and not in stuffy, super formal meetings was a nice change for once. Sure, Tony wasn’t a stranger to living in the public eye, but the past few years ever since he’d taken over the company after his parents’ death had been nothing but putting on a fake face for the world. Here, in this chain restaurant off the main road in Akihabara, Tony felt more like himself than he had in what seemed like forever. Despite having only met the guy in the strangest circumstances less than a day ago, Tony felt like he’d known Steve for years.
Once he was on his back, he noticed Tony pull something out from underneath the table’s surface. They turned out to be padded stirrups that folded out from the base of the table. Tony directed him to scoot forward and raise his legs up so that he could secure Steve’s legs and feet in the stirrups. Like this he was on display with his ass right there for Tony to see. Tony moved around next to direct Steve’s arms to the straps on the sides of the table.
And then Tony leaned forward, covering Steve with his warmth. It was an awkward angle, what with Steve’s swollen abdomen in the way, but Tony was able to hold himself up by the armrests and settle over Steve’s chest. He smiled down at Steve.
Steve huffed out a laugh. “I’m not an engineering problem, Tony.” That was one thing he was learning about Tony in their relationship: he could take anything as a challenge.
Steve couldn’t help huffing out a nervous laugh. “Seriously? Tony Stark not having every inch of this place under surveillance?”
“Hey, I wasn’t working through my guilt!” Tony protested.
“Bruce’s request, not mine, Cap,” Tony said, the annoyance all too plain in his voice.
worried for him.
Steve chuckled, a smile tugging at his lips. “And if he keeps up the hermit thing?”
Tony rubbed his chin as he considered his question. “Guess I overdid it, huh?” He gave Steve a shy smile. “Well… I wanted to win something for you, but I guess this is a bit too much, huh?”
Tony wakes up with a gasp as his helmet is removed. For a second, he can’t remember where he is and flails out an arm in panic.
“Feel that?” Tony asked, his tone the same as when he was explaining a new breakthrough in his armor’s tech. “It responds to your body heat and changes shape once it’s deep enough inside of you. Peristalsis takes care of the rest.”
Cradling his chin on his hands, Tony leaned forward on the table. “You’ve got that right, sunshine.”
“I didn’t find anything unusual looking at some samples under the microscope,” Bruce said with one of his half-smiles that was meant to be reassuring. “Though I’ll have to do some more tests to be sure. Those will take at least another day.”
Between the intense pressure in his abdomen and the feeling of Tony sinking down on his cock, Steve couldn’t even bring himself to form words. It felt like there was hardly any room in him left for air, let alone wasting any of it on speech.
Tony kept a hand on Steve’s stomach, idly rubbing soothing circles into the stretched skin. “Now, then. Are you ready?”
This time, Tony does shake his head. Shit, did his heats always start out like this? Was it always this bad on the first day? It’s been so long since he had a natural heat, he can’t even remember.
“Exactly,” Tony said. “The idea is that you can inject thousands of these tiny nanites into people and they can take measurements far more efficiently than taking a sample and sending it to a lab. At the moment we’re just testing how accurate those measurements are.”
It seemed to take forever for the first one to travel back to his entrance as he continued to push, his whole body straining as he focused. He wasn’t sure exactly where it was until he felt a strong jolt from his prostate.
Tony chuckled as he continued to run soothing circles over Steve’s stomach. “Sounds like you’re almost there.”
“Well, you’re my eyes on the scene, Cap. What’re you seeing?”
Tony pushed himself up and winked at him. “Maybe,” he said as he laughed softly. Glancing over at some readout floating in the air above Steve’s head, Tony nodded to himself. “It starts to hurt and you tell me, okay? I’ve tested this, but better safe than sorry and all that.”
Steve ducks his head, and Tony is about to say something until he notices the flush on his neck.
“I think you’ll manage,” he said with a strained smile.
Steve didn’t miss the way Tony’s expression softened.
Bruce’s face replaced the call waiting message on the screen. “Tony…”
“Just tell me.”
Steve couldn’t help a chuckle. “I promise you, this is water.”
By the time he’s reached the elevators, he’s running on autopilot as various pessimistic scenarios continue to run through his mind. He’s imagining Bucky’s look of disappointment when the elevator arrives. As he steps through, he barely notices the other occupant in the corner, and presses the button for the lobby.
With his arms on the armrest supporting him, Tony started pushing back down onto Steve’s cock. Leaning over him and being this close meant that Tony’s cock rubbed against Steve’s abdomen.
Steve lets out a heavy breath, hooks his fingers under the elastic band of his boxers, and pulls them down smoothly.
Steve eventually grew impatient enough that he just pulled at his underwear until it tore in half. He let out an obscene moan when his cock finally sprang free to bump against his stomach. He grabbed himself in a too tight grip and stroked himself as the creature continued to crawl over him. It didn’t take long for him to come with a loud cry, his cock spurting thick streams of come all over his abdomen, some of it landing on the creature as it crawled across his chest. Everywhere the creature touched left him tingling with pleasure. As he blinked up at the hazy room, he couldn’t help letting out another giggle.
“Don’t ruin the afterglow, Tony,” Steve eventually answered after a minute.
Tony nods. “I don’t want to risk anything getting worse. As soon as I’m feeling better, I can rig us a way to send out a stronger signal that can even get through this blizzard.”
“You’re killing me here, Steve,” Tony grumbles. “
Steve shook his head as he stepped back further. He reached into one of his pouches to get something to wipe away his neck and hand with. Once he’d done that, he steadily lowered his shield to get a better look at what he was dealing with.
“Merry Christmas, Tony,” he whispered before rolling them over so that Tony was underneath him. Despite actually getting his own capsule next to Steve’s for that night, he’d insisted on sharing with Steve this time. And, well… Steve couldn’t really complain right now. Even if they both got caught, it would have been worth it.
Tony chuckled. “Should’ve known you wouldn’t go for the easy way.” He moved his hand down toward Steve’s soft cock. “Well, for your information, the easy way would just to be have them go back to a more… fluid form and have you push them out that way. The fun way…” His hand passed down below Steve’s balls toward his perineum. “The fun way is to have you push them out just like they went in.” Steve flinched when Tony’s fingers reached the loosened ring of muscle and pushed inward. “You’re still a bit loose down here. I think you could pull it off.”
Steve winced. Right, that had happened his first week moving on. Tony had just laughed his head off and built a new, improved one.
badly?”
“I can handle it,” Steve insisted as he turned toward the door. He had that determined expression that Tony was all too familiar with by now. Steve shrugged before saying, “Serum, remember? I should be okay.”
He reached down to grasp both thighs and pulled back, baring his ass cheeks and giving the creature better access.
“So what’re your plans now?” Steve asked as he dug out his duffel bag.
“Steve?” he calls out hesitantly.
Tony raises an eyebrow at him. “Everything
To be honest, Steve wasn’t sure of how to answer right at the moment. Now that the pressure had abated, he realized he was fully hard. The sensation of its pushing had been tense, but the way it had forced itself past the tight ring of muscle felt good, too. The pressure was still there, though, as whatever had been pushed into him seemed to be moving slowly.
That’s how Steve found himself watching Tony proceed to win prize after prize from the UFO catcher. He went into a long rant about positioning and picking machines where the prizes were set up to actually be reachable. They even changed machines a few times. By the time they were done, Steve was holding onto an alarming number of cute plushes.
“Yeah. This isn’t your usual blackout. It’s city-level.” Tony glances out at the cityscape, which is unsurprisingly darker than it was a few minutes ago. “Emergency crews will be busy taking care of lots of situations like our own.”
Well, Steve hadn’t expected that response. Before he could react, he felt something metal click over his wrists. As light on her feet as always, Natasha was up and did a quick flip backward, coming down to snap something down against his spread ankles. The magnetism kicked in and they pulled his legs together, locking them.
Suddenly a light clicked on and Tony felt the body that was now under him move. He tried to turn around, except he couldn’t between the hangover and his general confusion. Tony could feel panic rising up like bile in his throat.
She shrugged. “Fine. I’ll go a few more rounds with you.” She resumed a fighting stance. “But I’m warning you, Cap, I will
Tony closed his eyes for a moment. If there was one thing he hadn’t gotten used to, it was the sheer force of Steve’s sincerity. “You’re too sweet, Cap. Really.”
Steve wanted to protest. To tell Tony that that wasn’t true. But the only word he could seem to form was, “Please…”
“Take ‘em off,” he says before he can think better of it.
What he doesn’t expect is a handsomely dressed stranger in rose-tinted sunglasses leaning against his door frame.
On second thought, not even leaning. The man was slumped down against the door, his head leaning forwards. As Steve got closer, he caught the smell of some kind of alcohol, which pretty much answered any question he might have had. Probably a salaryman who’d had too much to drink and couldn’t even make it up to his floor.
As always, Natasha used her agility and her smaller size to her advantage while Steve relied on his strength and reflexes. Sparring with Natasha was always a good workout because of the way she knew how to use his strength and bigger size against him. They were even, now; he’d pinned Natasha twice and she’d gotten him one more time. At the moment, they were circling each other, each waiting for the other to move.
“I’m so fucking close, Steve,” Tony said between gasps. “You are, too, aren’t you?”
The man blinked a few times before his eyes seemed to focus on Steve a bit.
“You took it all so well,” Tony said in a reassuring tone. “You are so wonderfully sensitive, too. Bet you can feel exactly how full you are, right now.”
Steve shook his hand. The liquid was warm, but his skin didn’t seem to be reacting to it otherwise.
Well, shit. It felt like he’d met Bruce only a few hours ago and not an entire day ago.
“Hello there.”
“Well, if it makes you feel better…” Steve was back to rubbing the back of his neck—that was also flushed—as he considered his next words. “It didn’t… It didn’t actually hurt?”
“Like that time I got my fist up your ass you came three times in ten minutes?” Tony asked.
,” the omega groans. “You do
Steve glanced back at him. “What?”
his heats—that loss of control frightens him more than he’d care to admit.
Tony starts to relax again and actually pays attention to his phone instead of the blond hottie on the other side of the car. That is, of course, when the whole elevator jerks to a sudden stop and the lights go out.
Tony’s hand on Steve shoulder felt far heavier than it should have. “I’m glad,” he said in a way that Steve had no doubt was sincere. Tony looked relieved, but also… intrigued. “You really
“Let’s find out.” Steve marches up to the front door and kicks it open without even knocking.
Even then, though… Steve had always wondered what it would be like to be even more full than that. If it was even possible.
He heard Steve chuckle into the sheets. “Just wanted to feel you.”
Steve glanced away despite himself. “What, go drag him out of the lab like you suggested the other day?”
They ended up heading further north on the Yamanote Line to Ikebukuro, an area that Steve had heard about but hadn’t had as a priority on his list. It turned out to be worth it, though, once they found Sunshine City mall and the huge Christmas tree displayed within.
“It’s a fairly recent discovery, according to the medical journals I’ve been reading,” Bruce explains. “And I mean, people always had their own lay theories about the phenomenon.”
Steve felt awkward sitting on the examination table as Bruce toiled away across the room, running some tests on blood samples he’d just taken. He’d already been through a CT scan, which Bruce had said he’d take a look at later. It was starting to remind him of the days after he’d gotten the serum when he’d been poked and prodded like a lab rat by the SRS.
Tony didn’t need this interrogation right now. “It’s just… been a long day.”
Steve laughs nervously. Here he is, turned on out of his mind, and this guy is still making him feel self-conscious. “Gee, I’m starting to think you only like me for one thing.”
Tony’s face lights up and it’s the most beautiful thing Steve’s seen. It’s something all of the press pictures never seem to be able to capture: how his eyes light up and his laugh lines appear. Steve could get used to this sight.
“What does this tech have to do with your plan?”
Tony shrugged. “However you want to get them out. Like I said, they’re flexible.”
“Did the interview go
“And it
“Are you fucking kidding me?” he says as he slaps his forehead and lets his head fall back against the glass wall.
They ended up back in the capsule hotel for Steve to pick up some things. Tony leaned against the next locker as he watched Steve intently.
full.”
Steve let out a sigh of relief. That was good, at least. The last thing he needed was to find out he was carrying some weird alien eggs inside of himself like in those terrible science fiction movies he’d watched with Tony for his ‘cultural education.’
Tony’s gaze flicks over to Bruce. “Probably because you stopped giving a damn ages ago.”
Well, sure, he supposed they were the reason the were both together now. “I’ll get them some chocolates.”
The man frowns and runs a hand through his nicely styled hair. “Figures.”
Eventually, he hears Bucky stomping around the kitchenette behind him like a disgruntled bear—which means it’s almost afternoon. He hears the fridge open and close, then the sound of Bucky slowly making breakfast. Part of Steve wants to help him, considering Bucky’s not wearing his prosthetic today, but then he hears footsteps getting closer.
Steve nodded and then turned his focus back to his abdominal muscles. Once again, he felt the objects moving through him until one of them reached his prostate again. Even when he was prepared for it, the vibrations made him gasp and writhe. He was hard and leaking again, adding to the mess on his stomach. By the time the egg was halfway through being pushed out of his hole, he hit his peak.
“Well, that’s certainly the most
Tony glanced up at him with lidded eyes. “How about you take off your shirt, and then we can get started?”
Something nudged his cheek, causing him to look up. It was the creature’s mouth or whichever end—Steve had lost track at this point—again. Steve knew what was coming next. His hands were still occupied holding his legs open, but the creature accommodated him by moving in closer to his mouth as it started secreting that sweet fluid again. He moaned in pleasure as he lapped up more of the sweet flavor.
Tony pulled back and pushed himself up to look at Steve, who was smiling as he turned his head toward him. “Damn, Steve. You really
Tony huffs out a breath against Steve’s lips. “You sure got busy, huh?”
Bucky laughs. “Come on, let’s be honest. I’ve seen him on TV. He
Steve stands up. He hesitates for a moment before giving Tony what he hopes is a sultry smile and asks, “How about you join me?”
“Good,” Tony said as he leaned up to kiss Steve again.
But this? This was something else entirely. It was like some fucked up porno enacted just for Tony.
“Cap!”
Tony glared at the screen in front of him. JARVIS had been harping on him for avoiding sleep for the past… well, he really had lost track of time at this point.
As an omega in a high, very public position, control has always been the key element in Tony’s life. Sure, there was a period in his twenties to mid thirties when he’d thrown that idea to the wind and done whatever the hell he’d wanted. Even then, though, he’d played the game of manipulating what the media saw and said about him. He had to control everything: his scent, sex drive, and most of all… his heats.
“Do I want to know where this is going?”
“I-I’m fine. There’s uh, one other person. But uh…” Steve’s nuzzling his neck again. “Can you give us ten minutes?”
Steve thanks the man before heading out of the room, his portfolio clutched tightly in his hand. Once the office door shuts behind him, he has to resist the urge to slump against the wall. Sarah Rogers, God rest her soul, would never have stood for her son slumping his shoulders just because of a little setback. Even if he feels like crap, he needs to hold his head high as he marches home.
“Have you met me? I’ve got a pretty high threshold for ‘ridiculous’ these days.”
Tony doesn’t have the energy to argue with him. He barely even flinches when he feels Steve’s slick finger against his hole. He even starts relaxing as Steve gently circles his finger around the ring of muscle.
Tony glanced up at him. Steve found himself wondering if Tony’s eyes had always been this striking. Were his eyelashes always so prominent?
Steve groaned, burying his head into the warm pillow as Tony continued to work his hand on his cock. The slide of Tony’s hand was slick and easy thanks to the amount of lube, precome, and come that had built up over the series of Steve’s half dozen orgasms in the past couple of hours. In the back of his mind, beyond the pleasure that was singing through his nerves at the moment, he actually felt somewhat guilty. Tony had fucked him three times with dildos of increasing size, then fucked him with his own cock, and then after that he’d sucked him off twice. And yet more than two hours after they had started, Steve was still worked up and horny as hell. His refractory period was still under five minutes, and Steve himself felt like he’d never be satisfied.
“True...” he answered, his voice shaky.
“What do you need, sweetheart?” Tony heard himself ask.
“How’s your back?” Steve asks once he’s got Tony leaning on him.
The man nodded. His eyes turned toward Steve. “Are you… my guardian angel?”
Resigning himself to the fact that he wouldn’t be falling back asleep after this, Tony stared up at the ceiling while wondering how this was his life. He was, without a doubt, well and truly fucked.
Steve ran a hand through his hair. “It’s fine. I’m not mad at you or Tony. I’m just glad we all came out of this with no harm done.”
Steve didn’t even realize he had been avoiding Tony’s gaze. His eyes snapped back up to meet Tony’s.
Steve smiles to himself. “And so impatient, too.” He lines himself up and pushes in slowly before Tony can complain further.
“There was an interview that you were expected to participate in, Sir, but I’ve sent instructions to reschedule it.”
“Okay, champ. This is going to be fairly simple.” Tony considered his words for a moment. “At least, in theory. All you have to do is push and they’ll come out. They’ll keep a shape that’ll move fairly easily, but will still take some work to push out.”
Guilt was unfortunately something he was all too familiar with in bed. The few times they switched, Steve could keep fucking Tony for hours, even into a second orgasm. As great as that was, it always left Tony sore the day after. No matter how much he insisted it was okay, Steve would once again feel that familiar guilt.
“Maybe,” Tony says. He’s thinking vaguely of picking the lock when a voice behind them says, “Do you folks need something?”
“How are you doing,” Tony asks.
If this is flirting, Steve doesn’t like this version.
“That’s not-” Steve chews his tongue. “There are
he can make people cry. But Steve, as far as he knows, hasn’t done anything to him. This is probably their longest conversation yet.
Tony makes another noise, not disgusted this time, but not much of anything else, either. He looks over at Steve and, hesitant, like he’s not sure it’ll be welcomed, he raises a hand and touches Steve’s cheek.
“What was that!”
“I could use a cup,” Pepper says, in a tone that implies she could use two or three.
Steve isn’t surprised the guy is saying it in a bad way, but how the fuck does this guy know what Steve’s mom does?
“Oh. Nice.”
“Yeah,” Steve says absently. He looks back at him and Clint. “I might stay, actually.”
“You and me both,” Tony says. He waves a hand at Steve’s canvas. “Have a good - painting. A good time painting.”
“You start a fight by punching them in the face, that’s how it-”
. Thank God.” Tony links their fingers together and does his best not to feel like a grade schooler with a crush. “Okay, good. Just wanted to make sure.”
“He is,” Tony says.
Tony waves, breaking out into a grin. Steve waves back, with a sense of relief he doesn’t know how to pin down, and heads over.
“Sorry,” he says. He’s having one of his moments where he’s made out of sharp edges and is sure none of them will ever smooth and he’s going to go through life cutting everyone on them. “Shit, just ignore me. I don’t mean to be - you’re obviously, uh. Going through a lot. I don’t mean to be a dick.”
“I won’t,” Bucky says, rolling his eyes. His cheek twitches, and his face goes serious for a moment. For a second Steve wants to ask if Frodo ends up okay, he burns with it, with wanting to know if he comes out the other side or sacrifices himself for the greater good, or - or -
Sarah heads into the kitchen, which is half-separated from the lounge by a counter, and is otherwise more or less the same room as the lounge. She hums as she starts getting things out of the fridge.
“Looking forward to it,” Steve says.
Tony smiles. It’s a very specific smile, his I-am-so-uncomfortable-but-I-would-rather-chew-off-my-own-leg-than-show-it smile, as Rhodey named it in MIT.
The static burns out when the door opens and two people spill in, the two of them interlocked in a way Steve and Tony
“Your call,” Clint says. “Bruce, let’s blow this joint. Steve, he’s going for his IV again.”
Tony waves him in. Pepper gives him a wide eyed look.
Tony nods like he understands. “Yeah. It’s that kind of book, huh.”
. Yeah. It’s not a mystery why Steve’s attached to Frodo.
Steve is heading to pick up the bowl when the front door open. He jumps, but it’s just Ma, who comes in and sighs when she sees Steve.
“Done,” she says.
“Tony…”
“Uh,” he says. “Yeah, but - still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater.” He regrets it immediately - surely that wasn’t helpful, the context was off, for one -
Tony laughs. His breath catches on it.
He turns the tap off, gives Tony a dishtowel.
“Nothing bad like what,” Natasha says. Her face is the picture of innocence, but Steve knows her well enough by now to take that as a dangerous omen.
He looks over at his Ma, who shrugs.
“That was a joke,” Steve says after a few seconds pass and no one has said anything.
Tony shows up to Steve’s house - the oak outside of it is indeed so big that Tony can’t mistake the house for anyone’s but Steve’s, my god that tree should be in Ripley’s Believe It Or Not - with a dish of shepard’s pie, which was the simplest thing he could make after a day of working on the farm and realizing that 1) he had to bring food to a dinner in two hours and 2) he had no idea how to cook. He’d googled an easy recipe that he could make with the ingredients he had available, and now he was bringing it over.
“Okay, just-” Tony gets up. The chair scrapes. “Sorry, I’m not - this was a great breakfast and I’m sorry for being rude, but Steve, you’re a great guy and the least you deserve are shoes that keep the fucking
Pepper and Rhodey look at each other.
it is. “Yes, Sir.”
She leaves the door open as she walks further into the apartment.
. You have salmon!”
Tony flounders. “That was - Steve won’t do that, Dad. I trust him.”
big thing that didn’t change after the serum, but they were never able to verify that.
“I’m fine.” He smiles, but it must be just as convincing as his crappy small talk, because Tony’s face doesn’t change.
Steve keeps looking at it, gaze flickering around like he’s trying to figure out how all the joints work.
“We had a movie night,” Tony says instead.
This instantly makes him think of Tony, who Steve knows for a fact has had awful hangovers, and still gets them frequently. Obviously Tony thinks that drinking is worth the mornings after.
Steve’s smiling, but he’s trying to hide it.
He reads to her a lot in those last few days as she gets weaker and frailer. He keeps his voice steady and even and focuses a lot on the scenes in the beginning where the dwarves eat the lush spread of food. At some point he looks up and she’s fallen asleep, so he trails off.
“God,” Steve says. “I nearly forgot. We should probably get used to the whole - that, right?”
“He’ll tell you about it later,” Steve says. “You’re at work, Buck, go and work.”
- Tony, what did Obie-”
“Where to,” Steve says, but he’s already getting up.
That was fast. Tony was assuming he’d have to talk Steve into it.
“You don’t have to,” Steve starts, but Tony’s already talking softly.
“Tony won’t magically wake up if you starve yourself,” Clint had said, which Steve takes to mean
Steve snaps his fingers. “Yes! Like - how are Frodo and the rest of the Hobbits going to go back to the Shire and, and - grow their vegetable gardens?”
Natasha removed her shoes and stepped up to the mat. Steve joined her a few moments later.
Steve took a deep breath and then let it out. “I can only imagine what you saw back there.” Oh god, his ears were starting to burn just at the thought. He couldn’t resist reaching back to rub the back of his head sheepishly. He tried telling himself he’d faced far worse than an embarrassing conversation with Tony Stark. “While the situation was out of my control, I was still very… indecent.”
“Uh… Cap?” Tony sounded hesitant, though he still approached the mat. He was wearing a thin band t-shirt and slacks with a pair of sneakers.
Waking up would be interesting. Steve was an early riser, though, and figured he’d be awake before someone sleeping off some drinks.
“Just a bit more,” Tony assured him.
“Can’t predict everything,” Steve said with a shrug. It wasn’t like he was angry about the whole situation.
Steve really did want it. He
“You realize I’m trusting your word here, right?”
He moans when Steve’s finger pushes even deeper.
Now that Tony thinks about it, it’s hard to believe that all this only happened a little over a day ago. The only thing reminding him is the echo of the absolutely amazing post-coital buzz. That and the lovely finger-shaped bruises on his waist.
kicked out.
Tony feels a smirk pulling at his lips. “So you had to keep fucking me for my own sake, huh?”
“Sure, put him through.”
“Sure. Hit me.” Tony steels himself for what’s next. He hisses when he feels the first sting from the disinfectant.
Steve cried out at the contact, back arching against his restraints.
As he heads for the elevators, he tries to ignore the voice of doubt in the back of his mind, but he can’t. Maybe this is their way of letting him down nicely? Maybe they’ve picked another candidate already? Heck, maybe they decided they didn’t need the position after all and canceled it. He’s heard of companies doing that before. It’s a dick move, but definitely possible.
Tony kneeled down beside him. “Look, Cap, I’m not one to kink shame. But I didn’t design this gym for testing out your bondage fetish.”
; more full than he’d ever imagined he could feel. It was everything he’d hoped for and more because it was Tony, and Tony always took such good care of him. After all, the nanites were Tony’s technology; so just like the suit, they were an extension of him. The fact that he was carrying them inside of himself like this made him feel hot all over. He was definitely aroused, but not in the way he was used to. It wasn’t all centered in his abdomen and his dick, for once. Instead, his entire body buzzed with a pleasant lassitude.
Tony glanced up to see the call waiting screen. He’d only met with him… some time ago. What did he want now?
“You’re mistaken,” the voice says, and Shuri’s about to snap back when it hurries on, “this isn’t for you, exactly. And Tony Stark doesn’t know I’m here. As far as Mister Stark knows, no one has been in the network except myself.” This pique’s Shuri’s interest.
“All that information, about the energy signatures,” she starts, “we’ve been keeping a tab on that. If you could—” no longer demanding, their original bargain already fulfilled. This is asking for a favor, something Fury knows Tony wouldn’t take lightly. “There is. Something, something coming, that Tony’s been… trying to keep ahead of. Something he saw—”
Steve snorts and tries to even his breathing, knows the tightness of his chest is probably just him, it’s all just Steve.
“What. Is. This.” Steve repeats and he looks like he’s going to explode before he manages to turn around.
The trail ended at Auditorium 15. Tony took a deep breath and listened.
“What does a wolf have to do with the tree?” Tony asks.
“I came in and you were collapsed on the ground, so I’m guessing that you don’t know how that happened.” Steve looks a little less wary and more annoyed now. Tony grunts and nods, trying to sit up. Steve helps by placing his other hand on Tony’s shoulder and hefting him up by the shoulders, aiding Tony until the other man is sitting up, albeit leaning on Steve more than relying on his own strength.
No, seriously, he was. Ask Jan; it was life and his bountiful years of living it that began to wear down the bit of patience he
The inside of the lid had a note, “just between you, me, and the icicle - FRIDAY”
“The town’s news channel is bustling with reports of light creatures and small quakes despite being told that the seismograph has recorded nothing alarming nor over the norm. I do believe this is a sign of magical interference in the natural order of the city. Would you like me to get your suit ready for travel, sir?”
“Besides, Ross,” Rhodey picks up, catching onto Tony’s momentum, “you’re here accusing someone of something as serious as aiding fugitives of the law; I’m guessing the Accords Council denied your inquiry into Tony’s post-mission interview.”

you’re sifting through all those files?” Rhodey continues blandly, looking up at the three projections FRIDAY has shifted forward once more. “Do you think there will be traces of Zemo’s methodology in there somewhere?”
“Which would mean that you’re not here to speak to us about anything pertaining to the United State’s position on the Accords, either,” Vision continues, “nor material evidence to suggest your hypothesis has any logical basis.”
“—or call us cautious, but the point remains that someone capable of making and maintaining a suit like Scott Lang’s being unaccounted for is stressing some people that don’t like to be stressed. The Accords are international, yes, but this is pushing some people to make their moves to create something at home.”
“Are you saying that the National Security Council is on the case?” Tony replies, leaning back in his chair to look at Ross. “Because, as I understand,
That… was some pretty heavy quantum science, but he lived by battling in a metal suit, his heart was still beating because of the arc reactor and Thor technically was another worldly being so the notes didn’t seem too strange.
Than letting him kill his friend?
It starts here.
, they finally reach a simple white house at the end of the road.
Tony gasps as the dream-state wears off and the pain in his shoulder starts to set in. He’s lying across the floor, the armor in pieces on either side of his body, a sure sign of someone using the override code. The auditorium room is suddenly alight, shining down on Steve’s worried expression.
—gone. And she knew she had no reason, shouldn’t have had the audacity to ask but she had to. She let Fury know through whatever channels she could. So here she was, awaiting a response to reach her before she got out of state.

as collateral damage. They’re lucky for the amount of leeway they have been allotted so far since their departure.
With a splitting headache and a long suffering sigh, Tony reverses the video feeds and opens a new window. He has some names to look up and some myths to relearn.
“Sokovia,” he says slowly, “we can head to Sokovia.” There’s a stunned silence that reigns, although Wanda might feel like it’s just a personal feeling. “What?” Scott asks, looking at everyone. “Look, although there have been efforts to rebuild, you can’t rebuild a
“Jarvis, reroute the message, try to triangulate the signal, remove the attachment to S.H.I.E.L.D. if you have to, I’m getting ready.” Tony shouted as he looked around the piles of boxes and tools for the suitcase. With a little ‘ah ha!’ under his breath, Tony drops the suitcase and kicks the handle, causing it to pop open. He slides his feet into the boots, presses up and the rest of the armor automatically begins to click into place, climbing up higher and higher on his body, Tony locks the gauntlets into place and soon, in a span of barely a few seconds, he’s fully sheathed in his armor.
I swear to THOR I AM GOING TO TAKE A BATH IN BENYLIN!”
“Idonae,” Tony whispers, feels it on his lips and tongue like something sweet, like fragrant apples. The maiden smiles and raises her arms back into their original position; she freezes, pale skin shifting into a gray-white flow that starts at her chest and spreads through her body like an infection. Her eyes are kind, though, filled with something akin to yearning and a touch of familiarity as they turn blue then harden with the same substance flirting with marble but smoother, milkier.
Ross smirks like he was waiting for Tony to say that.
Flying blind is kind of his legacy, anyway.
Albeit restlessly, Tony falls asleep.
It starts here.
"Perhaps this is no longer the moment for snark and vagueness," Fury says softly, "I'm here to check in on Stark, to see what kind of dirt Romanov was implying that could be important enough to cause Stark to get into bed with the likes of Ross."
"And what is with the need for secrecy," he had asked as he eyeballed the civilian car.
No running water, not really, and only scrounging up what they could find… Sam knew they could only wait until Wanda got better to move again.
“Yes, sir. I understand your request. I will have a complete time table ready in a few minutes, sir.”
Both Steve and Tony pointedly hold back any comment on that ‘
“I haven’t seen anything like it,” Sam says, “well, not, I mean.” He huffs out a breath, the weight of the past few weeks weighing on him harder. He doesn’t even know who is at the door, only knows that it opened and shut and, besides a step or two behind him, nothing.
!” Tony spits each curse into the whirling messages and sighs as he commands the top-sliding roof to open. He starts up his boots and starts up into the air, sending new commands into the armor.
Peter was on the ceiling, in his more modern black and white costume, slowly edging towards the two. The woman, thankfully, had her back against the two; she was tall, like most Asgadians, with long blonde hair billowing behind her, outstretched hands aimed towards the torn screen, a swirling portal right in the epicenter. She grunted, made a loud cry and pushed forward with her palms forward and
“My testimony of Siberia,” Tony says, right hand tapping on his chest, eyes going glazed, “or a… paper trail, of sorts, to clear me of the breakout and my whereabouts during.” Tony’s breath hitches when he meets Ross’s eyes, and he hates how this blindsides him, makes his chest ache worse than the new reactor.  “Or—”
Tony’s body feels icy, a painful sort of numb that intensifies with each movement. “Protect them, protect him,” Tony thinks like a mantra, a creed. He places the reactor down, ejects the functioning core and shoves the Tesseract in with the final vestiges of his strength. A bloody hand wraps around the core and Tony looks up for the briefest of moments to look into Steve’s wide blue eyes.
“The wind and the trees call me their own;  I am the apples, and the tree. I am youth, rejuvenation, beauty. Iðunn, they whisper, Idonae they say.” The woman smiles and she’s just so out of place in this warped reality.
A burst of static erupts from the audio port of the Quinjet. Steve, standing beside Scott, startles. Scott raises an eyebrow at Steve, takes a swig of his water. It is late evening, almost night now; Wanda’s fever has abated at last, and they wait for any sign of lucidness before attempting to get her to eat a little, to rehydrate.
man in the intelligence world, well. He may have something to work with.
He had written it all out, neatly and nicely in a post-mission report. Increased anxiety, returned trauma. Something about a species made to be weapons, which is how they were defeated: not meant to think individually, each alien was bred as a weapon. Who had been at the other end of the barrel?
And there it is, isn’t it?

and in doing so, the world was plunged into ethereal darkness and swallowed up by obliteration.
“It’s not of this world, that’s for sure. Sure as hell ain’t no ghost, either.” Missouri sighs and sits further back in her loveseat. “A being of another world came to me in a dream: Snotra, or something, and said that this would happen. That there would be death and scattered about would be the Valkyrie, sort of like reapers of souls but of the other world.” Missouri picks up the mug that was on the table and takes a sip of its contents, studying Tony. “Now, what do

One hand on the steering wheel, Natasha thinks, but the car is driving off the cliff. There is no control, is there, only the illusion of it? Her eyes track the last tear as it travels down the woman’s wrinkled cheek. She imagines Charlie Spencer’s mom looked the same, too.
Watch your back, she had told him, because she was a friend, or as much as she could be, and had seen what Steve would do for the Winter Soldier. What Steve would do for a modicum of the past, for whatever part of
"Actually, I don’t think you even know who I am," Pepper snorts, taking a delicate seat on the coffee table in front of Fury. "I'm the woman that kept Tony Stark alive while he went out to save
Surrounded by all this information and there is still no knowledge to be had.
“So, pretty much, I’ll get my answers when this is all done and over with, huh?” Tony looks at the bitten apple, demanding answers with a sharp glare. The maiden’s tittering laughter flows with the whispering promise of the wind. The lands all fade off into obscurity. Tony feels like he’s falling and then—
“After you,” Tony says with a wink.
“An upcoming battle and eminent death.”
Its two weeks later when Fury finally puts Thor and Steve on leave. The tower seems empty, silent now, missing a vital part of it that made it their home. When the rest of the Avengers return (because the Warehouse Incident, as it has been dubbed, was the prompting for the end of the strange and bizarre occurrences throughout the world) to the building they are quiet, subdued.
What does it matter if he was wrong, if it would always end with this?

The critical look that Loki gives him is all serious, the kind of look Steve recognizes. It’s the look of a soldier marching out to a battle they may not win, for a cause worth dying for.
Shuri turned quickly back towards the staircase where a small box was resting on the bottom step, a small bow perched on the center. It wasn’t tangible; although the presence hadn’t been able to use anything but the audio in the lab, it seemed to have been able to read at least some of the technology and digitized the small box hologram. Shuri, a little less annoyed and a lot more intrigued, opens the box.
