“You too?” Betty asked, holding out the hat for everyone to write their choice of movie on. “I swear, they need to find a cure for this. How do florists stay in business?”
He tried to remember that Tony was no longer ‘Tony’ anymore, but try as he might, he could not forget the man he had fallen in love with over the summer.
“He beats me at Trivia Pursuit.”
“Stupid secret agents,” Tony muttered.
“Thanks. I’m catching up on the classics.”
He was only mollified—just the barest bit—when he coughed up a single ranunculus petal, signaling that Tony was actually feeling some fondness.
He didn’t know what to do.
Bucky smirked and went over to the coffee machine, making Tony’s order. “Just because you don’t get them, doesn’t mean they’re lame.”
Oh, god. What if by confessing his feelings he would ruin all of that? Pepper would never forgive him for taking away her shoe-loving French-speaking bestie. Wait, hold on. That was assuming they all couldn’t be mature adults about this. Just because Steve rejected him didn’t mean that their social circle had to separate again. There might be some awkwardness, but Tony wouldn’t hold a grudge or anything. He and Steve could talk things over, work it out.
. Letters that he had been writing over the last few weeks, carefully writing onto the special stationary he splurged on, and fully intended to give to him on some other day than this.
Tony blinked. “What?”
Natasha snickered. “It couldn’t have been as bad as Milwaukee.”
Steve backed up only a little bit, as if he were still afraid to let anyone into the room. Yeah, Tony’s mind supplied, another alpha rut behavior: being paranoid about any perceived territory.
“One latte and double shot cappuccino,” the guy called, setting a cup on the end of the counter.
Tony inched his way some feet, holding his breath the entire time. Nothing seemed to give way as he continued on.
“And how often does he come to you for things you can’t just fix in five minutes?” Steve asked, getting to the heart of the problem. They had this conversation before, where Tony couldn’t understand why it was so hard for Peter to ask for help sometimes. “Things he doesn’t go to anyone else for? He probably thought, who do you ask book questions? A librarian, duh.”
“Just come towards us slowly,” Cap said more calmly. “We’re maybe ten feet away.”
“Only to temperatures he can withstand,” JARVIS compromised.
“My friends!” he cheered back, raising both arms, which had more drinks and snacks. “What are we watching tonight?”
Tony kissed him again.
“Oh, that thing?” Steve laughed, putting the cookies in their appropriate places. “Does that mean you want to watch it again, Tasha?”
Of course other people would know him better.
He couldn’t see that far into the future (there were too many variables), but it would be fine.
“Hey, Natasha, is that cake for sale?”
“Especially—” Tony held up a finger, interrupting Natasha. She raised her eyebrows as if no one had ever stopped her from speaking before. This was probably the first time in history. This was probably going to be his last moments on this sweet, sweet earth.
Life with Stiofán and everyone else of the clan was different than his home.
“I’m—”
He read the words over and over again, but he couldn’t quite bring himself to believe a single one of them. The things he had said! And how he practically abandoned his post! Who in their right mind would love a mouthy, disrespectful Irishman living in the slums of the East End when they could have their pick of the most fashionable and richest ladies and lords? Weren’t the rich only supposed to mingle and marry into other rich families? Wouldn’t someone put up a fuss? Wouldn’t Tony face all sorts of consequences just by being
“So, tonight’s the night,” Tony said, leaning on his elbows.
Steve pulled back in surprise. “You love me?”
“You’re … welcome,” he said, lamely.
And liked to be an eavesdropper.
Tony looked up and really, really hoped that his smile conveyed everything he
“This Iron Man …” Steve trailed off, lost in thought.
Then he noticed that no one else was in the shop.
Regardless, it was another late night and ideas were scrambling around in his head. He had spent the last forty-eight hours in the lab, fell asleep on the floor at some point, and noticed that he did not have any coffee. JARVIS, it seemed, did not deem it necessary to buy coffee for him to make, and as much as he loved DUM-E’s shakes and smoothies, they did not keep him awake.
“What am I even supposed to fix?” Tony asked, being petulant on purpose.
he had gathered from the bog was good, if somewhat tricky to gather.
If someone was trying to recreate the serum, even if they were in the middle of Siberia and had no connection to the outside world, not even wi-fi, Howard knew about it.
Tony knew that Peter could take care of himself and that he had a good head on his shoulders, but damn, it was like he had a martyr complex or something. He didn’t want to cause trouble or make a fuss or bother anyone. Why didn’t Tony insist upon seeing this kid sooner? Why didn’t he insist on sending the lawyers to the kid’s house? This could have been prevented!
Cup messages/pickup lines
“You sure?” Tony asked. “I got the idea you’d do just fine.”
Tony sighed and looked back at his monitors and keyboards before his stomach let out a faint gurgle. Tony probably couldn’t hear it like Steve could, but he likely felt it.
“Brilliant,” Tony gasped. “That is why I am gonna make you CEO, Pep, you come up with the best ideas. You can talk to the toaster, take the guesswork out of all the buttons and everything. It can tell you when it needs its crumb catchers cleaned, rather than smoke filling—”
Tony held out a handkerchief, which Steve took gratefully as he wiped his eyes and face, trying to take in a breath. It was hard, though, because he wanted to cry his heart out. He and Bucky needed the work, the job, the recognition. If they didn’t make rent, then they would be kicked out onto the streets, and sure, it was little better than their current conditions, but autumn and winter would be here soon enough and with his health …
“You’re still paying, or would you make a friend pay for their own coffee while visiting you?” Natasha asked. She didn’t even bat an eyelash at his worst glare. Rhodey only snickered.
“No. I just haven’t kissed anyone in about seventy years, is all.”
Tony laughed, but it was an appreciative one. Steve knew the answer wouldn’t be something like that, but one never knew where a solution might come from.
“I sent him to the principal’s office,” Mrs. Elison explained, as if she could read his mind. “I just wanted to check in with you. You okay?”
He ran as fast as he could and didn’t look over his shoulder.
“J, have all my meetings cleared and moved around for … the next three days. Medical reasons or something reasonable no one will question.”
Weighing his options, Tony ducked into a supply closet. He didn’t see anyone on this floor, but that meant nothing. If HYDRA of all things was still in operation, that meant they had to be smart and well-funded. They weren’t your run-of-the-mill white supremacy organization with handmade explosive and just a single plan to send their message to the world.
Tony smiled and Peter felt a warm feeling in his chest. It died a little, as he remembered what MJ had suggested. What he wanted to ask.
And that meant he got to spend more time with Steve. He got to know inside jokes and hold his hand during movie nights and got to see how annoyingly awake he was at 5AM to go on a jog like some mad man. They got to share with each other for a little while longer before going through all the paper and scrutiny that the mating courts would require. Neither of them were ready to have their lives and love analyzed for legitimacy just yet.
“Yeah, that’s because it’s one night out of the whole year!”
Steve laughed and returned the hug, patting him on the back. “Hey, if I can’t use my powers for good, why am I a librarian? Now go study, I’ll make sure to renew it for you.”
“W-What?”
“You live two floors down.”
Instead, he felt soft hands on his face, wiping at his temple.
All the plans, all the hopes and dreams, all the nervousness and having to gather the courage to approach an alpha in hopes they might go along with the kidnapping and then say yes in the morning for most of them to break an omega’s heart. Alpha’s Night was the one night where an omega could put their heart on the line and take the plunge instead of wait around for an alpha to take a hint and take them on a date themselves. Hell, half the time the omega chickened out or the alpha laughed in their face, because any omega who relied on Alpha Night must be deficient in some way.
Maybe that was why everyone ragged on him; they liked a clean kitchen in the middle of the afternoon and evening too.
“You have no clue?” Pepper asked, horrified when she saw a huge mass of tiger lilies all over his office’s floor. Tony was hastily shoving them into the garbage can.
When word reached him that SHIELD found Captain America, Tony was at a loss of what to do.
Tony could have
, something he had not experienced in a long time. Tears started to prickle in his eyes. He wished—there was so much he still had to do, to atone for—
. It was the lifeblood for millions of people. It was the drink you drunk when you wanted to take over the world or be a really classy super villain. “How?”
Tony snickered and kissed his cheek. “But they’re
He continued to stare at his shoes, feeling like he did when he was younger. When he was scrawny and sickly. When everyone was worried he would die any second. When everyone underestimated him and thought he wouldn’t amount to anything. No one wanted to invest in him back then either, besides a few people he still respected and loved.
The principal nodded. “I see. Well, now that we know what happened, we have some other matters to discuss …”
for their age and that was likely where some of the bullying came into play. No one knew that Peter took after his mother’s side of the family, which meant that he was going to be a bean pole sooner rather or later. Peter walked close to Tony, enough that their arms and elbows bumped into one another. He seemed to do better being grounded this way, at least until they got to Mr. Roger’s classroom.
The guy chuckled, warm and deep, as if the godly physique was not enough. “Most of them are, yeah. Most folks get a kick outta it.”
repeating.”
Oh. Damn.
Pepper opened a video call a few moments later. “Tony, what does JARVIS mean by you’ve been turned into a squirrel?”
“… and that concludes why I believe that the Apollo Moon Landing was the most significant event in modern American history: despite it’s less than altruistic origins, it has led to the creation of many of the modern advances we enjoy today, helped kick off a generation of engineers and scientists, and has created an avenue for the whole world to collaborate and learn together.”
“Just needed to take care of my class before coming down,” Mr. Rogers explained as he sat down next to him. “But we’ll get everything sorted out once the principal gets here.”
“You just can’t—”
Tony glanced at him. He was not sure what happened in the last … ten hours based on the text messages … but he surmised that something happened.
“Right? That’s why I hate board meetings.”
He had Steve and that was all that mattered.
The one pie that managed to come out okay was now on a sidewalk, getting washed into the gutter. The woman who ran into him was horribly apologetic, but he forgave her. The sidewalks were crowded despite the weather and no one could help gravity.
There were no servants and it was obvious that they did not have as much access to as many resources as he did back in Thrinacia. There were roads, small dirt paths that led to places to fish and to the small fields of grain and vegetables. It appeared that any centers of trade were some days’ walk away and such trips were infrequent. There was a great amount of stone in the soil, requiring many hard hours of labor to remove them, but they were being put to use as borders around their fields. If there were other villages, they were hidden by the hills across the way.
“Really?”
Tony could see the trail of thought that was going through Peter’s head: there was something wrong with him, there was something broken. He hated Mr. Rogers’ for a moment then, for getting Peter caught up in this. Sure, if he had a learning disability or something, Tony would want it addressed, but did he have to do it in a way that made Peter think like this? Peter had already gone through so much in the last few years, from the sudden death of his mother to surviving the foster care system to learning who Tony was. Couldn’t he catch a break?
That explained why no one came after him in the stairwell, Tony thought. Captain America and his partner probably used the fire alarm to their advantage. Good.
Tony felt himself flying through the air.
Were Petra and Actus alright? Would they survive Ovadyah and all of his cruel plans? What of all the other people he did not know intimately? They were innocents who did not deserve to have their lives destroyed or everything they worked for stolen.
He had lost track of how many hours he had been awake and did
Steve stared at him and then hastily wiped his eyes, sniffling. “Oh god. Emotions. Ugh! Tony!”
Steve’s eyes snapped to them, still horrified. “O-Of course I mean I’ll—um—Tony?”
“Want to try something new?” Steve asked one Monday.
“And I didn’t sleep so well last night,” Peter said with a yawn Steve couldn’t help but mirror.
“So this isn’t an attempt to create a squirrel army.” Bucky’s voice was absolutely serious and deadpanned.
“Anytime.”
“Hi,” Steve said, wishing he could pull Tony into his arms and kiss him. But that was a little hard to do right now. Tony stroking his head was really nice though.
“Hey, you sure he’s not awake?”
“Oh, sure you do,” he replied, shoving him back. “I’ll let you know when I see some peonies.”
Tony laughed. “That’s what you get for zoning out during class.”
Tony ran a hand through his hair and called it a quits.
“Yes, that sounds like a good idea,” Steve said, when the parent he was talking to suggested some more tutoring for their daughter. “We have student and teacher aid tutoring available before and after school.”
“Alright. How about you jump into the shower? We got some food being delivered. Getting clean will probably help.”
“No. Too expensive and we knew what he was anyways. Or thought we did,” Bucky said with a shake of his head.
The rest of the movie passed with relative peace, until they stopped to get something to eat. Dinner ended up being an affair of leftovers and cobbling together random items from the fridge before they spoiled. Having fried pieces of pepperoni, ham, turkey, and chicken wasn’t the worst meal in the world, but Steve found himself craving chocolate.
, Tony. This means my business can stay open. This means we won’t be on the streets after a couple of months, loaded down with debts again.”
rom-coms?”
Sure, they had seen him at his worst, but he was getting better. Not just because he wanted to clean up his public image. Not because he wanted to prove total strangers wrong.
He wanted to hug him from behind and bury his face in his neck, feel his shoulders under his hands, know what it was like to have his arms around his shoulders …
“That’s how she shows love.”
“Come,” he said, gently.
He had only a few options: flee, continue to argue, or flee. He could do it. He could point at something and make a break for it. He could toss his book in Tony’s face and run. He could reference tons of research reports and interviews about alpha and omega dynamics in their society and prove Tony wrong (if that were possible). He could stick his fingers in his ears and pretend not to hear Tony for the rest of his life. He could move to Timbuktu.
, but other times, he mourned the loss and wondered what happened to the people who worked there and owned it. Where did they go?
“W-What?”
When Tony first met Steve, it was at an art museum.
Steve stared back at him and Tony wished that he could read his mind.
“Oh, no. I’ve been getting Hanahaki Disease for like, the last two weeks. Not sure what kind of flower this is.”
“Let me give them a call first,” Tony replied, pulling out his phone. As if May or Ben would say no. They adored Peter and had been relieved when Tony contacted them and were more than ecstatic to be a part of Peter’s life, despite the past falling out with his mother.
“Two percent,” Steve shot back. “Two percent, Tony.”
He felt alive, free.
Everyone yelled.
Whispering some words, Lorna placed her hand on Steve’s head. In a flash of light, Steve was transformed to his human form, thankfully with clothes.
“Oh, right there,” Steve said, leaning his hand into Tony’s. He didn’t even know he had an inch there, but it was likely all the fur. Something was bound to get irritated.
“Darcy was grateful that she didn’t have to hear Jane complain anymore.”
“Doesn’t excuse you.”
Yeah. He was.
“In pieces,” Clint answered. “We gathered them all up, but let me tell you, I saw parts of you I never wanna see again.”
Another man was holding him steady, looking at him with such concern it made Steve’s heart skip a few more beats. He had gorgeous eyes. Steve would love to capture the honey tones that were reflecting in the sunlight … Nope, no. He couldn’t. He couldn’t afford to pay someone to sit for him. He couldn’t get anyone interested enough regardless and with this rejection, there was little hope that he could find work doing anything with a brush.
“Well, nice that you’re getting some confirmation of love from them.”
“I don’t doubt that,” Mr. Rogers laughed. “I know it has only been a few weeks since he has been diagnosed, but I wanted to check in on how he has been at home and let you know what has been going on at school if he hasn’t already.”
Tony jumped out of his chair and headed for the elevator.
Natasha smiled as she continued to text on her phone. “He’s SHIELD too.”
“Thank you again,” Steve said.
But in this almost too-crowded room, surrounded by his friends and loved ones, Steve couldn’t find it in him to complain too much about flower petals.
Third? He could not find the edge of his bed even though it was not that large.
Tony whipped out his phone and faintly heard ‘Iron Man’ by AC/DC started to play from down the hallway. It took a few moments, but finally, Steve picked up.
At least he could make a difference now and give his people hope.
Steve had made the mother of all pillow forts: his curtains made a tent-like roof, stolen couch cushions made the walls, and his mattress made the base. Blankets and pillows from the rest of the apartment filled in nooks and crannies, making everything plush and soft. It was certainly a feat, given how small Steve’s room was.
He stammered, unsure how to respond fully. His oral command of their language was still not the best. The last time someone had seen his plans, their eyes lit up with evil delight. Then his creations were put to war. But Stiofán’s eyes were only filled with wonder and curiosity, as if he had never seen someone do such work before.
This was about Steve.
While there were all sorts of rigid and confining gender roles, Alpha Night was one of the few instances where those shackles were thrown off and people took advantage of it while they could. Not that having to wait until a certain night of the year for half the population to be able to ask the other half out on a date would continue to be a problem (among many other things) if he had anything to say about it. But he had to get through Steve’s thick skull first. His plan would not work unless he had an amazing team behind him and Steve by his side.
“We know some German and it’s a classic literary trope,” Bucky said, rolling his eyes. “Now shut up, this is getting good.”
“Kiddo, I got lawyers. The best lawyers. If you want me to, I can have this kid shipped to Siberia before he could even blink. Now, don’t even try to protest. You do not deserve to be bullied for any reason. Not your name, not your looks or your clothes or hobbies. Nothing. You are too young to want to try to be all tough and independent. You’re
wasting your life.”
Yeah, that seemed to fit better.
He might be reading too much into this, but—
But when everyone was drunk and you had the best archer in the land and other highly killed soldiers armed with magic and alchemy on your side?
“Thanks.”
That got a good laugh out of Mr. Rogers. “That’ll be the day! Really, with you as his dad, I think Peter is going to be just fine. Do we want to keep checking in, say, once a month?”
Steve looked up. “No?”
Tony felt all the breath leave his body.
Stiofán pulled him into a hug. Antonius buried his face into Stiofán’s bony shoulder and didn’t hold back his sobs.
Steve felt his cheeks straining from how wide his smile was. His heart thudded wildly in his chest, he was so deliriously happy.
It really was.
It wasn’t just the pillow fort either. There was a pile of granola bars, snack cakes, and other packaged foods sorted neatly on his desk chair, and on the dresser was the coffee maker. At least there was a rubber tray for spills and to corral the mugs and supplies like sugar.
This was
“Come on, we all know liberty smells like a polling booth!” Clint exclaimed, grinning.
But … But clearly Tony though the risk was worth it.
“Tony? Tony?”
Tony sat down and Steve clambered up, resting his head on Tony’s thighs. Tony automatically started to stroke his head.
being really calm about this,” Bucky said. “
Steve smiled brightly, taking a long drawl from his latte. “Thank god for caffeine.”
where the police ignored a panicked person on their emergency channel. There was clear evidence that something was going down.
Industries.”
Letting out a content sigh, Steve closed his eyes and let Tony take care of his hands. It was a weekly ritual supported by his therapist, especially because nail biting was the worst manifestation of his anxiety. There were times he bit his nails to the quick, causing his fingers to bleed. As an artist, he depended upon his hands, but sometimes—
“The upper floors are going to be compromised too,” the sniper said. “I don’t think we’ll be going to the roof either, unless the bomb was localized to this corner of the building.”
Steve did not look convinced. “My walk is just a flight of stairs. You’re liable to get mugged.”
“I didn’t say anything.”
“Hey!” Steve shouted back, waiting for him to come over. “How’s it going?”
Tony grumbled and turned his modified welder back on.
He had been trying to figure out what has turned Steve into a golden retriever. He didn’t accept Stephen Strange’s vague answer about magic and all that. It would eventually wear off, like Tony’s squirrel transformation did, but there were so many unanswered questions.
Tony smiled brightly, brilliantly. Steve had sketchbooks filled with sketches of Tony. Soon, he would be attempting canvas. “Love you too.”
It was good, knowing there were people who would always have his back.
a classic movie. There was a diner a few blocks away from the coffee shop, one of those places that seemed to exist forever and somehow never seem dated. The tile floors were glossy, there was neon in the jukebox, and the menu was horribly expansive. Tony was tempted to ask for a chocolate malt with two straws to complete the picture, but that felt like teasing.
“Oh no, I get them, but they’re still lame!”
“Well, yeah, but it’s still annoying,” he muttered with a blush.
Tony gritted his tiny little teeth. Even though his suit was a brilliant feat of engineering, there was no way around it: he was tiny and he could only go so fast.
Peter felt a tidal wave of dread come over him. She wasn’t going to have them talk about this right now, was she? She wasn’t going to have Flash apologize to him, right? It would be completely insincere! It would just make things even worse! The moment she turned her back or when there weren’t any adults around, Flash would totally retaliate!
“Pepper, I am offended, wounded. Fresh air is important! Didn’t they come out with a study recently about getting two hours of fresh air improved people’s lives?”
Someone came into the room, not that Peter or Tony noticed.
“I am not letting you have that much caffeine at once,” Steve answered.
There were so many other differences … He found himself questioning what the gods were thinking, sending him here. He was so far removed from everything he knew. There was little possibility to recreate his forges and kiln. He drew designs and plans in the dirt with sticks, dreaming and yearning for what once was.
(Somewhere, he knows, Pepper was feeling less stressed and didn’t know why.)
But Bruce knew what long nights at the lab were. He understood technical jargon and the bitter defeat of projects that needed to be scrapped. He knew the dangers and consequences of working with anything that required some risk taking, beyond board members changing their minds or terrorists wanting to use his genius for one horrible reason or another.
It was the nicest morning he had in a long time.
Tony stared at him. “Is this the kind of crap you had to deal with in the war? Please tell me we’re a little more competent than this.”
“Choose your poison,” Natasha said, looking like she knew his darkest secrets and was still going to kill him. Despite her small stature, he was sure she could.
“Hey, what can I get you guys?”
Tony’s heart skipped a beat. No, he couldn’t confess his love right now.
JARVIS brought up a picture and Tony’s entire world shifted.
Why was he not admitting that the letters weren’t fictional? Why did Tony think they were fictional and Steve was some secret writer? Were his letters that bad? Should he say something before it got all out of hand, even more than it already was?
“But I’ve seen the way you look at Mr. Rogers.”
He watched him leave and a part of his brain hoped he wasn’t too obvious.
“Oh, latte this time. It’s the afternoon. I’ll drink the real stuff when I need to stay up late tomorrow. What do you want, Rhodey?”
That would be too altruistic, even for him.
Steve almost dropped his thermos. “W-Who said it was Tony?!”
“No! JARVIS! Delete any and all evidence that I was a squirrel!”
They rushed out into the downpour, following JARVIS’ directions to where Happy was in traffic. They attempted to avoid puddles, but with how they were running, splashes were inevitable. At one point, as they rushed past the gridlock, some car sped around a corner and sent a wave of muddy water. Steve adjusted the umbrella, thereby shielding them from the worst.
Peter smiled and hugged his father closer.
Steve leaned down and kissed him. “Mm. Maybe.”
“You okay?” Steve asked one afternoon.
His voice didn’t go as deep as Sinatra’s did; it had a higher, airier quality. Almost a tenor, if his general speaking voice wasn’t as deep and rich as it was. The coffee grinder, as loud as it was, didn’t seem to drown out his voice at all. Or maybe Tony was just really listening.
Yeah. He was going to have to get inside his mind and find out his side of all this, because that determined look in his eye meant he was going to something amazing or something stupid.
“No. Not really.”
The gods were the gods. They had their reasons.
“Uh, have a good day, Tony.”
Steve threw up his arms. “For God’s sake!”
He prayed. He prayed for mercy. He didn’t want revenge. Ovadyah could do whatever he wanted. His power would only last for as long as he could control the people he gave the tools to or managed to bribe with whatever wealth he managed to collect or steal. But unless he found a more clever way of maintaining power than through fear, the warriors would eventually rebel against him. They would want more power, too.
Pepper rolled her eyes and tapped away at something on her tablet. “Well, this could push up your two o’clock investor meeting.”
, please,” Bruce added. “Think Pepper would like something?”
Steve rolled his eyes and went over, snatching Clint’s BLT.
Tony snickered. “I can see that.”
Despite his worries and insecurities, he had a good feeling about Tony. He was different.
“A little. I’m wondering about his intel, how he knows where to go and who to target. He’s got no support out there.” Steve started to busy himself with rearranging the cups under the counter. Tony could hear the soft clinks as Steve did his best to be careful.
“You guys good?” the pilot asked. His voice sounded familiar, but Tony couldn’t place him. He was going through an adrenaline crash now that he was safe.
Steve knew that his mother would box his ears for the behavior he would soon be partaking in. She taught him better manners than what he would soon be displaying—she taught him many, many things so he would not have to suffer the way she and her generation had. He may still be poor, practically in poverty, and he might not have a drop of blue blood in him, but at least he knew how to speak proper English and he could read, write, and calculate.
(See the end of the chapter for
Some of the concepts explored on the internet through photo manipulation were amazing. Just a simple shift in hue could convey all sorts of different messages and meanings, just like a brushstroke or different shade of green might on a painting. He really liked that so many people were able to express themselves artistically through this medium too, more than ever before. It did not take art supplies and wasted canvasses and ruined paintbrushes. The experimentation, the exploration, the lessons learned about lighting, color, placement … that was all there.
Sam was a cool, mellow kind of guy that made great ‘from scratch’ recipes, until Bucky got on his nerves. Then his snark came out in full force. Natasha still gave him murder vibes, but she thrived under pressure and he was pretty sure she was secretly a geek. She made too many subtle references for her to not be. Bucky was still a jerk, pulling everyone’s pigtails whenever he could. No one knew why he was kept on, but Tony supposed it was because he did occasionally provide decent customer service and excellent coffee.
“You?” Steve whispered, as if in awe.
“Yeah. One cappuccino to go, please.”
He must have looked around for a long while, because Bucky had that smug look on his face that only spelled trouble for him in the future.
“Steve?”
In front of him were three large stones, coming up past his waist, with more of the swirled carvings. He had never seen such a style of carving before. It was wholly abstract and gave no clues as to its meaning or if it was meant to represent a god unknown to him. To his immediate right and left, high walls were made of dark gray stones—but only until the curve of the entrance ended. Beyond them, the rest of the walls were made of rounder stones that shone bright white in the sun. What should have been an impressive roof of more stones and walls was instead a mound of dirt, grass and flowers already beginning to grow. Eventually, he could predict, it would blend into what might be more hills and mounds in the surrounding area.
The guard they left him with didn’t seem too keen on monitoring his ‘progress’ or making sure he didn’t do something like break through their firewalls and dismantle their monitoring programs to work for him instead. There were at least ten other agents using Twitter and another twenty on Facebook. No one would care about one more, especially when he made it look like someone else’s computer was accessing the website.
Antonius let out a sob.
His stomach growled, interrupting him.
“And you still come here? For shame.”
Antonius pulled his hand from the wall and stared at his handprint outlined in a pale blue.
and finding out that Darth Vader was Luke’s father.
Steve’s smile widened and became brighter. “Well, as long as they don’t go to waste.”
Pepper and Rhodey were the only ones who knew what happened in Afghanistan.
He could ask him and break rules and traditions and he
With his luck, it would just make things worse.
With an aggravated sigh, he put the book into the library’s return bin. It went down the conveyor belt with dull thuds. Oh, god, he would probably have to shelve it himself.
But the suit’s power was finally online and he was now working out the last remaining kinks. He was developing a more streamlined armor design and thinking of what he might need in emergencies, beyond flight capabilities and thermal imaging. He was going to need a self-contained air system, emergency release valves, and … and …
“Thanks.”
No, not even close.
This other guy was handsome too.
“So, Mr. Parker, can you describe to me what happened?”
Then Mr. Rogers’ eyes—god, they were a piercing blue—focused back on Tony.
She grinned. Damn. He gave himself away.
Steve grinned at him. “Apparently, you were adorable. And fluffy.”
“That’s … that’s good to hear.”
“Not everyone,” Tony argued. “Some couples stay together.”
“Yeah,” Steve replied. He knew that soon, the smell of Thai would wake Tony up. It was one of his favorites and he was sure to reserve a box of red curry for him. Pepper and Rhodey had also been updated. Pepper offered to pick him up and take him back to the Tower, but Steve said it was alright. Tony was actually sleeping for once and no one wanted to interrupt that. “He wasn’t really himself when he came here. Kind of in and out of it.”
Weird flavors, tries them all because love
“Steve?”
“You know,” Steve began about a week later. “Did we ever figure out
“Maybe something is finally going to be done about him,” Ned said with hope. “I mean, I heard Mr. Rogers spoke to Flash and his parents, but nothing came of that. They threatened to bring in lawyers!”
Tony grinned sharply. “If I can’t, this isn’t the first time I have been held hostage.”
Any fondness he felt for Tony disappeared when he coughed up ranunculus petals for the rest of the day. Gathering them into an envelope, he passed it off to Rhodey when they met up for a history class they shared.
Pepper squeezed his hand.
The professor lodged complaints, but given that no one was breaking any rules and were doing their assignments, the counselors could hardly find grounds for punishment. Class meetings led to study sessions which led to going to the movies, which led to Steve meeting some of the best friends in his entire life (besides Bucky).
Giving food was a traditional courting gift. It went back thousands of years, apparently, when food could be scarcer or less reliable than it was these days. Being able to provide a mate with food or some sort of material security was still a desirable trait regardless if they were an alpha or omega. Steve also knew that Tony would appreciate something homemade.
The walk was still too long and by the time they got to the coffee shop, Tony felt like he was about to burst out of his skin. He
Hypocritical was entirely the right word.
There was unpredictable weather. Tomato plants not protected by frost cloths were killed overnight even though it was past the last average frost date. One minute, it was bright and sunny. Then, suddenly, everything was soaking wet because the weatherman assured the population that there would be no freak thunderstorms. They should have known better.
“Oh—there were emergency meetings,” Tony quickly supplied. “Things are good now! No more fires to put out.”
That was not the point. Three people in this world instantly knew everything that the journalists were trying to figure out. Bruce became a little green, yelling at him for being irresponsible and possibly causing future retaliation. Rhodey was just as pissed, because he had to deal with the fallout and the clean-up and the repercussions, not to mention the possible power vacuum. Pepper shook him until his teeth rattled, because it was one thing for him to get kidnapped, it was another thing for him to dive back into danger without as much as a note.
He then asked a question he hadn’t even tried to ask himself yet:
Tony had to admit, later that evening, as he tried to work through another panic attack, that they had a point. Even as he tried to justify his actions with ‘hundreds of weapons that could no longer hurt anyone’ and ‘so much intel on so many criminal activities’, they had a point.
“Sir, I found the computer that is the source of many of the communications,” JARVIS said one evening.
He glanced back at her and saw the intense gaze she was studying him with. That stare could learn the secrets of seasoned CIA agents in under two seconds. He was not sure where she got such powers, but the state department was forever grateful that she was on their side. Unless they were being idiots. Then she continued to use all of her powers for good.
So caught off guard, Flash stumbled out into the hallway with Mrs. Elison.
He had always avoided looking at it and used a cloak to hide its light at night.
“Well, I don’t want to die,” Tony said. “So, here. Take a look.”
Steve sighed, but gave him a smile. “Sure. Why not?”
Someone was taking his canvas out from his hands and helping him sit up.
survive—he was going to sign up for every self-defense class, mixed martial arts, train with Happy every single day, go to the gun range, and do everything else he could possibly think of to make sure he was absolutely competent in situations like this. He would even study Jackie Chan movies so he could have a plethora of someone improvising in a fight to refer to.
He really hoped this place would do well.
“Um—who said I was?” Peter deflected.
“Yeah. I remember.”
It had been Tony’s first seminar at the library. The rest of the library’s staff had been mortified, but it ultimately resulted in Steve getting Tony’s cell phone number to coordinate another event. Knowing who Tony was, Steve couldn’t believe it at first. He had to be horribly busy with Stark Industries, literally managing a global empire, and doing so many other philanthropic events. He had hundreds, thousands of people clamoring for his attention and pretty much all of them were more important than some omega who worked at a library.
Everything? The watercolor of the Brooklyn Bridge? The oil painting of Central Park in the winter? The other sketches and acrylics? The one superbly awful abstract that seemed to want to be a Pollock but missed the mark by a mile?
Linking into the control panel, Tony used a program he had before and cheered when it worked.
Tony groaned and ran a hand through his hair. Now he was thinking about holding Steve and Steve holding him in a variety of scenarios. Great. Lovely.
Steve mentally cursed, but refused to look up from his book. He could see Tony grin in his peripheral vision, but he refused to look any closer than that.
Late that night, he woke up with a gasp.
“Blessed?” Antonius asked, not knowing that god’s name or their significance.
Above, Sam and Rhodey were taking out men with their alchemized wings, frightening more people along the way. There were dozens of abandoned swords and spears littering the ground.
Steve didn’t bother asking him to lower his voice. No one else was around, really.
Steve let out a deep breath, his shoulders sagging. Tony hadn’t noticed how tense he was still holding himself until now. “And you?”
There were different forms, like the kind that made it hard for children to physically keep still when needed and another form that made it hard for children to focus for long lengths of time. Girls and boys were affected differently. As they grew, the symptoms could change. Scientists and doctors suspected there were more adults out there with ADHD than people realized because by the time they got into the workforce, whatever they weren’t diagnosed with was ‘normal’ to them and why would they seek medical help for something they didn’t think they had?
“Mm,” he sighed when Steve pulled away for air. “Can you do that again?”
“Having an internal crisis about Steve?” Rhodey interrupted.
“I’ll catch up!” Tony replied.
Steve couldn’t believe it.
Tony didn’t stop—and he didn’t come back—until he was sure that he got every single gun, bomb, and flare. Then he made sure to gather all of the intel he could, because like hell he was going to just set everything on fire. That was how cockroaches came back with larger armies: when everyone thought that they were destroyed and had nothing left.
The man—obviously Clint—grinned in response. “Oh, the usual, living off pizza. Is Nat in?”
“You know I do,” Tony said, voice full of conviction and eyes burning bright.
But they did not seem pleased to see him.
He left for the kitchen or some place before Steve could properly protest.
Antonius found out why when she came back with a freshly killed stag hours later.
Tony had to admit he was anxious about the whole thing.
As they walked down another hallway towards a staircase that would provide them more cover, they didn’t come across anyone else. Most everyone who was not HYDRA should have been cleared out of the building due to Tony’s fire alarm, but another glance out a window showed no signs of firefighters or even police.
Something crumbled to Tony’s left, making him freeze. Dust cleared after a moment and Tony saw that he was maybe a few inches from plummeting god knows how many feet down. Snapped cables sparked. Iron beams were twisted and sticking out all sorts of ways. Tile and concrete fell down, so far down that he didn’t hear it land anywhere.
“Well, I wouldn’t mind seeing you again without a lump on my head.”
Tony gasped. “He does not!”
He still dreaded that she somehow
Earlier that evening, Natasha stood before Clint and dozens of others to go over the plan one more time. They all knew that this plan had risks; some of them might not make it back.
“No, he’s stable, as far as I can tell. He’s got the energy to be mouthy and insulting.”
Steve reached up and shifted, pulling Tony closer, so their foreheads touched. “I’m sorry. I’m okay, I’m here. I’m not going anywhere.”
Peter and Tony both looked over their shoulders to see Mr. Rogers coming down the parking lot. It took him little time to reach them and he wasn’t the slightest out of breath.
“You knew Hedy Lamarr?”
“Tony!”
Tony also knew that sometimes, Pepper denied herself a little bit too much. She worked three time as hard as anyone, put out so many more trash fires than imaginable, and hardly got the credit or recognition that she would have gotten if she were male.
Peter nodded and Tony had a feeling he understood on some level.
“She is terrifying. She needs no other compliment.”
. They were nothing but a bunch of stuck up, snobbish, narrow-minded—
Tony.
Nobles scattered. Soldiers grabbed their swords.
“Oh—oh god,” Steve stammered. “Wow.”
“Mr. Stark? You with us?”
“I’m not being coy,” he replied, finally breaking away from the doorway. He busied himself with putting away his things while sweating bullets.
Tony’s cheeks were unusually flushed. “I—uh. Sorry, this is weird. Totally weird. I happened to be nearby, but something’s come up? Could I crash on your couch for a bit? Something’s come up and—uh. Sorry if this is weird. Did I already say that? I think I did. No?”
It spoke to how much comfort Steve needed when he immediately hugged Tony with a vice-like grip, burying his face in Tony’s chest. He felt feverish and was trembling and Tony frowned from how his hair was damp with sweat.
“Hell no.”
Peter gaped. “I’m not the one who wants to date my teacher!”
Tony bit back asking why Steve stopped. Who said he stopped? Maybe he was taking some time off to run a business and make money before continuing lessons. Maybe he decided to do this instead and keep art as a hobby. Maybe something else happened. There was a lot that Tony didn’t know about Steve—about all of them. It kind of made him jealous, but he could hardly fault Bucky or anyone else. He just met Steve and their interactions were limited.
Sure, they first met because they crashed into one another in a coffee shop and got into a heated argument about anything and everything except the spilled coffee, but he would never regret it.
Steve stared.
“Hey, hey,” Tony said, reaching out and laying a comforting hand on his arm. “It’s okay. Rejection sucks. Those idiots don’t know what they’re doing, sticking to tradition like they are.”
“Indeed,” Thor agreed. “Perhaps it has roots in the different ways the college education systems have developed, at least in comparison to Europe. Though how did you know about lilacs?”
Tony’s heart was hammering. Apparently, Steve had gotten worried about him when he didn’t show up at his usual time. He hadn’t even realized that he
“There is a data center along the way. We could find some tools and get word out somehow.”
Steve glanced away, biting his lip, trying to hold back a smile. “I don’t know who calls the shots or made that decision. I mean, they didn’t change Bucky’s name either. He’d say I’m the one who caused most of the crap we had to deal with back then, so it’s karma.”
That was his calculating face. His ‘I am going to end this person’s life’ face. The one where he put the pieces together that no one else even noticed in some strange puzzle only he saw, say something that would revolutionize the world, and then do something about it.
Wistfully. With a tiny little smile.
Tony looked up from his current project: two pieces of metal being melted together by something capable of keeping a steady flame lit. Steve had never seen anything like it. It was like a giant can with a candle sticking out of the end of a hose. More importantly, Tony was lifting the metal plate that was protecting his face. He was sweating, his face flushed from exertion and heat, but his eyes were bright and alert. He looked handsome and alive and—
Men surrounded them, each trying to land a killing blow. The hallway was narrow and long, designed for moments just like this. Not that Steve wanted to be in the position of the one having to fight for his life against dozens of enemies.
“They’re fine! I got them right—” The man made a noise of dismay when he saw one of the paintings had some smudges of dark oil on them. It was a landscape, featuring a number of trees and a meadow. “I am so sorry.”
Steve shook his head. “Tony.”
Whoever was in love with Steve didn’t deserve him.
“But not your gods,” d’Arcy said, her command of the language quite surprising. She only grinned. Antonius suspected that some god clearly favored her.
where they bantered most of their relationship (though maybe without the scandal and lack of communication).
—the precious metal that had been discovered in lands to the east of island city states.
“I hate you.” Steve huffed, pinching the bridge of his nose. This was gonna end in disaster.
“No, Steve. We're not wearing the safety goggles!” Tony groaned.
“Last rule; physical violence is allowed but no breaking anything. No murdering, Natasha. May the best team win!”
“Isn’t that against the rules?” Steve muttered, frowning.
Now it was Tony and Clint versus Sam and Natasha. Natasha was doubling around the kitchen to avoid running into Tony. Instead she decided she’d get herself into the vents to shoot Clint in the ass.
“You shot me?” Steve huffed, holding his gut as if it was real.
“Rules!” Tony said, which earned him a groan from Clint and Sam.
“Fine.” Tony gave in. Clint whooped.
Clint hmphed before pointing at the left flank, “Natasha’s going left. She won’t admit it but she’s better with her left side. Don’t tell her I said that.” He added quickly.
“Hmm? How should I know?” He responded.
Only three left now. It was Natasha versus Clint and Tony.
Steve interrupted Tony with a shout of “That’s weapons!” before turning towards the door.
Sam groaned and shouted "Please don't ever yell 'body slam' when we're in battle!".
After the rules had been stated both teams went a different direction of the Tower; one going east, the other west.
All of the Avengers gathered in the living room. Bruce was drinking tea and seemed to be halfway through a new book. Steve was talking to Tony, “I can’t believe you shot me. You didn’t even hesitate.”
“Fine. You just can’t take being beaten."
Which now left an awkward silence hanging in the communal room where Steve, Tony, Sam and Thor were still sitting, cleaning up what the party had left behind.
“In that timespan he’s already tried kissing Sam twice, he’s cuddled Bruce and told him he thinks green brings out his eyes, he’s slapped both Thor and me on the ass, telling us we’re, and I’m quoting here, ‘hot pieces of ass’, and last but not least he’s been impersonating a spy for the last thirty minutes. He’s clinging to walls, checking if there’s no-one behind him, and he karate chops the air every time you try to talk to him.”
“I told him he could go to that door and play with the light switch for a little. That really got him stoked. I saw him skipping over there.” Tony grinned.
“We should do this every Thursday!” Clint opted.
“Why don’t we ask JARVIS?” Tony nodded to the ceiling.
Sam huffed, having his breath forced out of him. Tony quickly shot him three times in the chest before standing up, dusting himself off and waving goodbye, “Tell Steve I killed you. He’ll be proud.”
“Where’s Clint?” Sam asked the others. He’d stopped watching the man when he hadn’t been kissed for two more hours, figuring the coast was clear.
Natasha came up to Clint, “Clint, you’re drunk and you need to go to sleep. Come on.”
“How long ago did he take that swig?” Tony asked.
Thankfully, Natasha got angry at Clint for almost killing Tony so she threatened Clint in a few different languages, which had the desired effect. He was in bed within 20 minutes. Went out like a light.
“Alright, tell us why, Clint.” Tony asked.
“Agent Barton is currently in hallway 34, room 7B.” JARVIS responded.
“Sorry babe, I’ve gotta go shoot the ballerina and the bird now. Byeee.” Tony kissed Steve on the cheek before using his body as cover and darting into the corridor like a dear running over a highway. An array of bullets followed him. None hit Tony. Most his Steve.
“Shit.” Bruce muttered.
“He’s got a crush..?" Tony breathed. It stung a little.
“Oh come on! I literally have zero plans now…” Tony muttered.
The men nodded at each other before Tony walked back into the hallway. He waited a few seconds before moving towards the gym.
“First rule; if you get shot, the other team gets a point. JARVIS'll keep score, so there’s no cheating. Second rule; the fight will remain on this floor.”
“How about your crush on me, Capsicle?” Tony poked Steve in the belly.
“Meh. The other option was being shot, so I guess I should thank you.” Tony grinned, punching Steve’s shoulder playfully.
“It’s even got my name on it! You guys know what this means?”
“I think we should, too. I’ll take the vents.” Sam offered. Guess the birds would fight it out up there.
Tony rounded the corner and immediately put his hands up. “You’ve got me.” Natasha shot him in the chest.
“Clint, will you please put down the arrow. I’m not willing to die over this.” Steve tried placating Clint, hoping he wouldn’t fire the arrow, knowing Clint was a good shot, even when intoxicated beyond reason.
“The vents. They don’t let as much sound through as you’d think.”
“Oh come on!” Tony groaned, “Sorry, Bruce.”
They had no clue where their opponents were. Instead the remaining four Avengers just crept around the floor, looking around suspiciously every time the wind blew. How they were in charge of saving the world was a mystery.
“He’s in the corridor next to the kitchen, I repeat, vents over the kitchen!” Steve hissed into the comms.
Sam was now at all times on the other side of the room from where Clint was. The kissing accidents made Sam a little skiddish.
Sam was grumbling to Bruce about being shot and tackled. Tony overheard and interrupted, “What, did I ruffle your feathers, birdman?” He snickered.
“He let the arrow fly.” Steve breathed.
Natasha had been going shopping for Clint’s birthday and decided that it was time to fulfil one of Clint’s biggest dreams: a nerf war with the Avengers.
“Yeah, I figured. Any idea on their whereabouts?” Natasha rounded a corner, her toy handgun at the ready.
“This is exactly the reason why Clint wasn’t allowed to drink that mead.” Natasha answered. She’d been drinking all evening too, but didn’t seem the least bit affected.
“You shot me in the back Clint.” Natasha stated. The room fell silent, waiting for Natasha’s reaction. “I must say, ruthlessly executed. I approve.”
Sam mock-saluted, “Aye aye, Captain!” Before heaving himself into the vent and disappearing into the ceiling.
When Sam couldn't find out where the voice was coming from he decided he’d better get out of the vents and try his luck on the ground because this just wasn’t his shtick.
“No!”
“I’m on it.”
“Fine. I’ll take the left flank. You take right. Sam, get out of the vents if you stop hearing the flow of air. Clint has mastered the vents. It’s his terrain.” Steve smirked.
After Sam was gone, Steve and Natasha split up too. Steve creeped through the corridors for a while, checking up with his team every few minutes before hearing Sam hiss, “I see Bruce in the kitchen! Nat, he’s on your side.”
Even Bruce laughed at that.
“I’ll be coming for you, Sammy.” A voice sounded through the vents. There was a slight echo that made it just a little too creepy for Sam.
Guess Clint was a good match-maker after all.
“They're just foam and rubber bullets. We’ll be alright. No goggles.” Natasha decided.
“Are you alright?” Thor asked.
“Steve will go right then. Okay. Clint? You’re in the vents, I’m assuming.” Tony said.
Bruce gulped at the last rule. Natasha sighed.
Tony checked the schematics, pointing at a few hallways, “Sam is gonna get into the vents because he’s a bird, like you.” Tony smirked, poking Clint’s bicep.
“What’s our plan?” Bruce asked.
“He’s got a point.” Bruce muttered, happy he wore glasses, which decreased the change of losing an eye exponentially.
Steve hated him.
“Yes! Finally!” Clint exclaimed, bouncing up and down while holding a box, hugging it like a child.
“I gotta have some of that.” Clint said, making grabby hands at Thor.
“Clint, get your ass out of the vents. We need to make a plan.” Tony hissed into his comm.
Natasha immediately felt two taps to the back. Shot. Twice. In the back. By Clint.
“Fuck that.” He sighed before kicking out a raster and finally feeling ground beneath his feet. Time to go hunting.
“Well, Clint is not one for lying.” Steve responded, hoping Tony would get the hint that Steve did have a crush, but wasn’t sure about admitting it just yet.
“I’m in the kitchen.”
“But only after I’ve let love flow through the blood of my friends!” He smiled.
“Hey, I’m still on the comms. At least mourn my death. And take revenge!” Steve butted in.
Bruce sighed, “Well, you can use me as bait… I know the others won’t expect me to be too good of a spy or soldier, since I’m neither. So dangle me like one does a worm and don’t let them shoot me before you shoot them.”
“Yes! Done!” Tony exclaimed.
Clint sang-sung “Love for you, and love for you!” While shifting the arrow from Steve towards Tony.
“Okay.” Clint responded.
“Clint, all that’s gonna flow is just blood. Nothing else.”
“This is gonna end badly..” Bruce muttered. Apprehensively eyeing the other boxes that were splayed out on the table.
“Bruce, you best get out.” Tony whispered, nudging him towards the kitchen.
Russians.
“I really hadn’t thought about that...”
“He didn’t say explicitly, so no.” Natasha smirked before grabbing herself and her teammates comms, “I say that we divide and conquer.”
“I’m doubting if we should be a real team anymore.” Steve deadpanned.
“So, I need to show you something, ehm, somewhere else. Come on.” Sam told Thor, winking at Steve, not even trying to be inconspicuous.
“Bitch, I’m immortal!” Clint belted out before starting on the song he was hearing.
“Jeez Clint. Please don’t die on us.” Steve sighed.
Tony nodded wisely at that, “See? Nothing to wo-“
“Good. It’s a date. See ya tomorrow, Steve.” Tony kissed Steve’s cheek before heading towards his bedroom.
“Ha!” Sam jumped around the corner, having heard footsteps. He went for a headshot but instead got tackled by Tony, full force.
Clint interrupted, “Are the vents allowed?” He smirked.
Natasha snorted at Bruce’s reasoning.
“He was ranting about lamps. Where did he go next?” Natasha continued.
“Guys!” Came a voice from the hallway, “Look what I found!” Clint came stumbling into the room, holding his bow and a quiver full of arrows.
Natasha, in the meanwhile, had tapped into the communication devices and had heard them planning to meet up in the kitchen. She excited the vents and figured she’d scare the living daylights out of both of them when she was waiting for them around the corner.
Natasha summersaulted into the room, taking out Bruce and immediately finding cover from Tony before he could even pull the trigger.
“Let’s not shoot anyone, Clint. Put the bow down.”
He swivelled around in the kitchen after hearing someone clear their throat before being shot in the gut.
Tony raised an eyebrow, but nodded, “Well, how about we go out to dinner tomorrow, to celebrate that I wasn’t killed by cupid?”
“But you didn’t get him.” Tony smirked.
Steve sighed in relief, but he was too early.
“Definitely not.”
“Yeah, sure, Clint. Keep telling yourself that.” Tony winked.
“How hasn’t she found you?” Tony wondered.
“I'm just watching out for our eyes!” Steve reasoned.
“Nothin- oh! Shit!” Steve suddenly shouted. Clint was hanging upside down from the vents shooting with two handguns at Steve, who leapt over a table in the corridor and fled into the kitchen.
“Tony! Where’s Barton?” Natasha asked.
A silence stretched before Tony spoke up again, “So, eh, Clint was pretty out of it, hmm? Think he knows what he implied?”
Clint continued, “It means that I am cupid!” He slurred and spun a circle on the balls of his feet like a ballerina. Just less graceful. A lot less.
“But Tony! I’m doing this for him!” Clint reasoned, pointing the arrow in the general direction of Steve.
"Body slam!" Tony shouted. His shoulder driving into Sam's stomach.
“I’m sorry I tackled you.” Steve rubbed his neck, knowing Tony would be black and blue.
Tony found Clint on top of the fridge once again. This time he was eating pop tarts. Loudly.
“Movement on your right, Bruce.” Tony hissed.
When Tony could finally breathe again he looked up at the bundle of muscle on top of him, “What the hell, Rogers?” He whispered. Tony was trying very hard to ignore the taut muscles that were Steve’s arms currently cornering his head.
“Only Tony and Clint are left. Steve’s dead.” Sam murmurred into the comm.
“You didn’t think you’d shoot me that easily, did you?” Natasha grinned.
“I don’t know. He was ranting on about how great lamps were to Tony for a bit.” Steve answered, shrugging, “Tony actually seemed interested.”
"Hey honeycrisp, what can I do for you?"
"Tony is the same," Natasha speaks up. "I haven't talked to him much about it, but Rhodey has. And Tony is just as scared to get involved with Steve, for his own reasons."
The following day, Natasha sends him a text informing him that Tony is planning on picking Casey up from school that afternoon. Perfect. Time to put the plan into action. Right around the time that school is scheduled to let out, Bucky excuses himself from the shop and casually wanders next door. Not surprisingly, Tony is already there even though school doesn't technically let out for another ten minutes. Tony is nothing if not predictable when it comes to Casey. It's actually kind of adorable in a weird 'Tony' way. Bucky can see why Steve digs it so much.
"I don't – shit, I might have condoms in a drawer somewhere but they're at least six years old," Tony says, realizing. Fuck, of all the things to not buy. He's got lube because he's not a big fan of chafing, but he doesn't have condoms.
She shakes her head quickly.
“Mr. Stark. Before you go in, there are some things you should know.”
Tony doesn't glance at the cash he pulls out of his wallet, putting it down on the counter and taking his cannoli and coffee to sit at a table by the window. It's a complete coincidence that he sits facing the front counter, able to keep his eyes on Steve.
In the days after the accident, everything shifts, and it's absolutely not for the better. It's driving Bucky completely insane. He and Clint had ignored Steve's insistence that he was fine, and didn't need any help, and found excuses to work from the Manhattan shop for a few days.
But he has to do it, because Rumiko had cared about Stark Resilient so much. Her dream had been for the company to revolutionize the world's energy industry, putting an end to carbon emissions, non-renewable resources, all of it.
"I hate everything," Tony whines as he reluctantly climbs out of bed and stretches. "Tonight. You, me, dinner date. And clear schedules tomorrow."
"Steve? Are you alright?" Tony scrambles to his side, heedless of the fact that he is kneeling in the snow and it's soaking through his jeans.
"Steve's magic coffee won him over," Clint adds from where he's now climbed up onto the counter to pull down spare bags.
"Pretty sure no one plans to get caught in a blizzard," Steve replies, feeling light despite the pain and the mess they're in. "It came on damned quick though."
He probably shouldn't be this dependent on the kid, he knows. But Casey is his
"Oh?" Tony hands her the napkin with his 'paparazzi' smile – all flashing teeth and dead eyes.
He's already familiar with available commercial real estate in the neighbourhood, so it's blessedly easy for him to pull up a shortlist of viable locations. One of them even already has a half kitchen built into it, so renovating would be easy. He keeps half an eye on all of his incoming e-mails as he throws together a portfolio of proposal overviews, highlighting the pros of each place. He can conduct multi million dollar business negotiations in his sleep, surely he should be able to sell a coffee shop owner on the benefits of one of these alternate locations.
to be flirty. This is different. You only do
Only to have everything shatter when they wake.
"It was nice to meet you, miss," he says, opting to shed the idea of subtlety.
the outrage – the burning fury – at Hammer for having touched a hair on his head.
"Before we go any further with this, I need to know something very, very important," Tony says.
Steve nods and turns to follow T'Challa out of the room, but before he does, he looks back at Tony. Their eyes meet, and Steve's are full of pain, confusion, sadness, and a thousand other emotions Tony wishes that he didn't see. The other Tony could just kiss it all away. This Tony can't.
A whole night trying to sleep beside the human perfection that is Steve Rogers.
"I don't think I'm gonna be able to walk right for a week," Tony says, lips a little uncooperative. "You proud of yourself?"
that meeting."
After Steve had recovered, which thankfully took only a few days with his healing speeds, he didn’t really have any place to go. He couldn’t go home - his apartment was still a crime scene. He couldn’t go back to work - SHIELD had gone more or less under on account of a cephalopod infestation.
"Yup!" Tony grins. "Polyethylene glycol."
Tony had been so happy to see them, especially Bruce. It had been years, and he'd missed his friends. He'd been so tired of missing his friends.
"Hey," he says gently, resting his cheek on the top of Steve's head, "it's alright, Stevie. We're gonna get through this." Steve sags against him, and a little of the tension fades from his shoulders. It's a small victory, but Bucky will take it.
It feels like an eternity ago, but Steve knows it's less than 48 hours since he had gone to bed with this man. Since he had kissed him and held him and made love with him, then fallen asleep beside him in his bed.
Tony takes a deep, fortifying breath. He's emotionally drained, probably compromised, but he can't
you're doing," Bucky snaps.
"Even still, you could have seen that he was into you," Natasha tells him. "I saw it within minutes of meeting both of you. It was adorable, really."
"And Thanos?" Vision asks warily.
"She sounds incredible," Steve says. "Thank you. For telling me about her."
In the last fraction of a second, he lets himself mourn for what he never had with Steve. Maybe it could have been different, but now he'll never know for sure.
Tony runs a hand through his hair, then scrubs it over his face tiredly. It's only 7:30, he shouldn't be this tired. But he's got seven nanny resumes to go through and a full day's worth of Stark Resilient work to finish. He
Steve's face pales, and whatever's going on, it isn't good. "I'll send you our coordinates," he says, and ends the call. All eyes turn to Steve and they wait, breaths held.
"I don't want you to stop staring at him," Rhodey corrects him. "I want you to stop
It starts with a grunt from Rhodey, and then Natasha is on the comms, breathless. "It's an ambush," she says, sounding like she's running. "I've got four hostiles on me."
"Excuse me?" Rogers' eyes take on a sparking, stormy blue.
Steve stares directly into Tony's eyes, not blinking, and reaches between them to guide himself to Tony's hole.
That's good. Smart.
But there's nothing easy about the horror dawning on him as he blinks himself to full consciousness.
Steve wants to argue, but there isn't anything he can say that won't sound like a lie. So he just takes another spoonful of stew and puts it in his mouth.
Vision smiles softly, and wraps Tony in a gentle hug. "Perhaps you have both been a positive influence on me." He pulls back after a moment, and adds, "For whatever it is worth to you, you were a good father."
“Right. Well I know you don’t know me that well right now. But trust me. As soon as you remember me, you’ll realise how ridiculous that it.”
He's still got bruises and cuts on his face from their run in with Ares (because of course, yes, let's have more gods come to earth hell bent on destruction), but he's healing well. They sit together in silence while Tony eats his cannoli and Steve browse's the day's news.
"Sorry," Julie says with an apologetic shake of her head. "Didn't even have a name on it."
Tony groans, then does as he's told, shifting around until he and Steve are laying side by side on the bed, facing one another but head to toe. He keeps his lips wrapped around Steve's cock the whole time, and the second his own groin is within reach, Steve takes Tony into his mouth and sucks him in deep.
loves this kid.
“Excuse you, I’m charming and charismatic. And people love me,” Tony protests.
It's a short lived victory, because with both Steve's hands occupied, Thanos swings a hook with his free hand that catches Steve across the ribs and sends him flying, crashing hard into the ground with a grunt as all the wind gets knocked out of him. "Steve!" he yells, unable to stop himself. But from the corner of his eye, he sees Steve push himself up. That's enough, for now.
And yet, despite all that, Steve knows deep in his heart that the love he'd fallen into in the Haven is just as real today. Had been real before they'd gone, even. Before the Accords, before all of it, Steve had loved him. He hadn't always known it, but he does now.
"She is brilliant," Tony agrees. "So, the vibranium bonded to it and created a body. The consciousness is a fusion of JARVIS, and the uncorrupted version of what Ultron should have been. All held together and made possible by the mind stone. Which, full confession, I realise now that Bruce an I had absolutely no idea what we were dealing with. We were so far out of our league, and we had no idea. That's ego for you."
Her eyes widen, and it's like she can't quite believe what she's hearing. Tony grins and taps her shoulder lightly. "Your slime beasts are making a mess, doing some damage, but last check, they hadn't hurt anyone. And, you're all out here desperately trying to fix what went wrong.”
Sam raises an eyebrow. "By magic coffee, you mean –"
"And, I made a painting today!" Casey says excitedly. "But I can't show you because it's still drying at school. I like drawing, and I like math."
Then, as much as he doesn't want to, he slips those awful, cold, wet wool slacks up his legs and does up the button and zipper. His shirt is still draped on the counter from earlier, so he slips it back over his shoulders and does up a couple buttons in the middle. Then he runs his fingers through his hair to work out some of the tangles, and turns the door knob to head out to his fate.
"You're amazing Tony, thank you."

interested. He'd just
Clint is dozing in the next bed roll, full of painkillers, and Bucky is sitting beside him, one hand resting comfortingly on Clint's thigh. Steve still can't get over how easily they seem to have fallen into the relationship they'd found in the Haven.
“It’s not like I
!" And Rhodey's tone is creeping into "crowing" territory, which means Tony has got to nip this line of thought in the bud before Rhodey really gets going.
"You know, I'm proud of all of you," Sam tells him. "Honestly. All three of you, you're doing incredibly, especially given everything you were dealing with."
"No, I'm retiring today, let me sleep."
"Tell me about her?" Steve asks. He can hear the smile in Tony's voice as he responds.
“You mean, if you gave Tony some space,” she corrects. Steve doesn’t say anything, he didn’t have to. “Come on Steve, don’t you think you’re overreacting a little?”
They stop for take out on the way home and bring it back to the tower where they can sit around in their pyjamas eating a late dinner. Steve looks more than a little tired around the edges, and his being awake in the middle of the night watching team training was all the proof that Tony needed to know that he hadn't been sleeping well while away. They sit, they eat, they talk. It feels nice – normal – like his life is in balance again.
Steve stares up at him, and in that instant he thinks that Stark might actually be his favourite person that he’s met since waking up. Granted, he hasn’t met many people, but Stark is different from all of them. Stark’s the first to actually treat him as Steve Rogers. As a human being, not an icon to be raised on a pedestal or an asset to be handled. When he grins, Steve sees something that reminds him of Dugan’s playful nature, and Stark can hold his own around him as well as any of the Howlies could, and he looks gorgeous doing it. The thought of the past stings like it always does, but Steve pushes it aside for the time being as he takes Stark’s proffered hand and pulls himself to his feet.
He is surprised when, on the fourth morning the new shop is open, Tony saunters back in looking far more composed than he had the last time that Steve had seen him. Less like a frazzled parent, more like a suave entrepreneur. It's a good look on him. Not quite as good as Tony in full dad mode with his son, but it's still a good look.
"Steve, I don't know this man beside me, but if he orders a real coffee instead of a minivan-mom version, his name will be James Rhodes and he will be a friend of mine who also
'advanced' before Hammer had started bleating.
"That's
Somehow, they manage to get there without Tony embarrassing himself with either a poorly-timed erection or by dropping to his knees and begging to suck Steve off. Steve takes a seat on the toilet while Tony kneels beside the tub and starts running the water, fiddling with the taps until he finds the perfect temperature. Once he's happy with it, he perches himself on the edge of the tub, facing Steve. Absently, Steve runs a hand through his hair, but halfway through he jerks his hand away as though he'd burned himself. Something passes over his face, but he takes a steadying breath, grabs a towel, and lays it across his lap. "There's still glass in my hair," he says quietly, and runs his fingers through his hair again, methodically shaking out the tiny bits of windshield onto the towel. It's safety glass, designed to shatter on impact into edgeless shards that don't cut, but it still sucks.
"You make that threat a lot," Steve comments as he pours a large cup of fresh brew and slides it over to Tony. "Fortunately for me, I know how to stay in your good graces." His point is proven as Tony takes a sip and sighs happily. Steve smirks to himself. He makes a damned good cup of coffee, and he knows it.
Buried deeply by grief, Tony had wanted to die, too. He'd wanted the earth to swallow him whole, wanted to trade the infant for his wife, had blamed himself for carelessly getting her pregnant in the first place. He'd been angry, so angry, and then he'd seen the baby,, and he had looked down into the face of his son,
"I'm not an alien," Quill said. "Mostly."
Tony doesn't look back as Strange quietly steps out of the room. There is a battle on the horizon, and Tony really should be doing something to help prepare for it, but he can't. When Vision wakes up, Tony wants there to be someone he recognises at his side. Vision isn't Casey, he knows that, and Vision isn't JARVIS either – not really. But he's elements of them both, as well as being something uniquely himself. Tony can give himself a few minutes down here to watch over Vision, his friend. He can watch, and wait, and quietly grieve for the little boy he never was.
He hauls Tony up to a standing position, heart pounding as Tony is suddenly close, so close Steve can feel a puff of breath on his jawline, and time stops entirely for just a second while they stare into each other's eyes.
let Bucky and Clint know about this.
“Escape? From who?” Tony looked up long enough to see Steve’s forehead scrunch up in confusion.
"That's better," Rhodey sniffs.
Natasha wants to tear her apart, suddenly – to rend her limb from limb, for daring to talk about Casey at all, let alone for spouting lies. Her carefully maintained calm shatters, and she's got her hand at Hammer's throat, manicured fingers wrapped around it. She doesn't squeeze, not yet. She lets all her anger, all her malice show in her usually impassive face, and Hammer rears back, panicked for a moment before her eyes widen comically further.
No matter where he hid in the mansion, they would find him. He lived with a team of sneaky stabby types — a mistake, he was beginning to realise (good job, past Tony, opening your home to these people) — and
“Well it’s not like we have anything better to do,” Tony snaps. “But you’re right, if you want to leave, I won’t stop you. Have fun and don’t let the door hit you on your way out.”
Steve raises an eyebrow.
"You've been – we've all been through a lot," Steve starts, trying to find a way to backtrack without making Tony feel as though Steve doesn't want him. "I don't want to – to put any pressure on you. You shouldn't have to think about that, about me, right now."
"But the way you loved him?" Steve continues. "That was all you. And that's what I want to see again."
He knows what will happen. He's sure
"No. I sent Loki to hide it. I had no other choice."
Across the table something close to relief flickers across Tony’s face, as thought he’d been prepared for something worse. Steve frowns, but doesn’t question it.
Steve and Bucky hang back for a long moment, watching Rhodey hold Tony while Tony shudders and shakes.
"If he thought something had happened to you?" Steve murmurs. "I think he might go with anyone. He loves you as much as you love him, Tony."
“Explain to me again why I have to be the one to do this?” Steve huffs, looking back over the information that Natasha had dropped in front of him. It’s solid, convincing, well documented. It always is from her.
"I assume Tony has been –"
"Right. Uh, thanks then," Steve says and shuts the door. He immediately slumps against it, and barely manages to resist the urge to thump his head against the door repeatedly. He wishes this were still a dream, and not one of the single most awkward mornings of his life.
"Oh, god. That's why – he's
"What did you do before?" he asks curiously.
"Nothing happened," Steve snapped, gripping the pen he's holding hard enough that Bucky thinks he might break it in half. "Tony just has more important things to do than worry about hanging around here. Just leave it."
Steve blinks at him, and then the smile that blooms across his face eclipses all the other smiles Tony has seen from him.
He doesn't take the time to do that as much as he should, Tony decides. It's not like he's going to have a partner any time soon, but that doesn't mean he can't do a little something for himself from time to time.
"Bath might be easier, you won't have to stand," Tony points out as he crouches next to the chair and helps Steve wiggle out of his pants. The Universe really must hate him, because this is definitely not the scenario he'd pictured himself getting Steve out of his clothes. The ones he'd entertained in his fantasies – quiet moments in the dark when he was alone – involved a lot more kissing, a lot more hands on both sides, and a lot more pushing up against walls and grinding of hips together.
"I knew you were going to say that," Steve says.
Steve turns to him and cocks his head. "A refund on the weather?"
That, Steve can agree with.
"Oh my god," Steve murmurs. "Oh, god, it works."
have their meetings at Brewed Awakening.
It takes an incredible amount of restraint to not run over before the ground crew give him the all clear. The steps lower, and there, standing at the top just inside the plane is his Steve, tall and strong and perfect. It takes only half a second for Steve to notice him standing there on the tarmac, and Tony watches his expression flicker to surprise, and then pure joy.
Natasha raised one lightened eyebrow. "I think Thanos might be more than willing to take that trade, if you ask him nice. You might wanna try swearing on something a little more valuable to him."
They finish up their sandwiches in silence, but it's comfortable – like the quiet moments of the car ride had been that morning. Once done, Tony takes the plates and sets them aside on the dresser, and then excuses himself to take a much needed shower.

Tony half nods, half shrugs. "I mean, it's not unreasonable. Kids get scooped from busy places all the time. I just. Look, I don't care if it
"I know you will."
The slime monsters are approaching the restaurant now, still flinging droplets of gunk as they move. Somehow, that doesn't seem to be diminishing their mass at all. Tony doesn't even want to think about how that's working. Beside him, Steve is studying the one closest to them as it slides around, and then, in lieu of his shield – which is safely tucked up at home – he takes an empty plate he snagged from the restaurant and flings it at the creature like a Frisbee. He doesn't even look fazed when the creature just absorbs it and keeps on glopping around.
"Ice on the highway happened."
He gets up and goes to the refrigerator, finding himself a few bottles of water. He drains one immediately, then takes the other and sips at it while he leans against the counter and thinks.
is not the same as actually seeing you okay," Bucky tells him, relaxing ever so slightly.
noticed any of those things, Steve probably would consider the fact that he doesn't think he's seen a rear end on a fella like that his whole life, and he wonders how plump and firm and – nope, he didn't notice at all because the guy has a
“J, where is Cap right now?” Tony asks, sitting himself down at his work station and pulling up his displays.
Tony steps back and plugs the monstrosity back in, then flicks the button and turns the dial.
“I can see you’ve been catching up on all the quality news,” Stark mutters. Steve laughs at that, but it’s hollow and brittle, like the brief moment of comraderie they’d managed to establish had just shattered. Stark winces. “Sorry. I just kicked another landmine.”
Steve stands, keeping his back straight. Her eyes light around the room, barely glancing at him before they catch on Tony's prone form, his pale skin. The heart monitor is still beeping quietly in the background, and the ventilator is still gently pumping air in and out of Tony's lungs.
“That’s Dummy,” Tony says, smiling in spite of himself at his bot’s joyous welcoming back of his friend. “Beside you on the table, Cap. There’s a little ball. Toss it, would you?”
. He's the only link Tony has to Rumiko, and he's the most important thing in Tony's entire world. He
"So, any ideas?" Tony asks as the things draw nearer, dropping and flinging globs of slime all the while.
He smells it, first. The heavenly scent of coffee in the air, reaching him through the heavy down blankets he's piled under.
An hour passes without incident and Steve begins to think that the intel they have might be false — or at least that nothing’s going to go down tonight and he’ll have to come back another time — when the woman who’s been bringing him drinks all night comes back again, sly smile on her face. At this point, the volume of the music and the din of voices have risen to the point where conversation is nearly impossible. She sidles up into his space, resting her hands on his shoulders and running them down his arms. She raises an eyebrow and nods over her shoulder towards the private rooms, and takes his hands, pulling him to his feet. Steve swallows hard, but doesn’t resist. Natasha had told him to go with whatever happened, and this woman looks and acts like she knows her way around this place. With any lucky, she might have information, maybe heard something, rumours or gossip.  Anything that could help him.
All Steve wants is to go home and hide, but Rhodey won’t let them leave until they’ve at least filed an initial statement, reports to follow. By the time they’re done, Steve feels worn down and wrung right out, and he’s pretty sure he’s going to lose it on the next person who tries to talk to him about something that isn’t leaving. Which is of course, when Tony decides to march back into his line of sight.
Fumbling, he pulls the little device out of his pocket, hands shaking. There on the screen is a notification that he has a message. From Tony Stark.
Steve's stomach twists up a little at the mention of Rhodey and the blunt reminder of the place that he has in Casey and Tony's life. He shouldn't be jealous, Tony and Casey aren't
nothing.
"Do you have – mm – do you have lube?" Steve asks into his mouth between kisses.
"Peter Parker," Steve acknowledges, standing to shake Peter's hand. "Good to meet you, son."
Natasha lingers behind a moment, looking from Clint over to Bucky. "Don't worry, alright?" She says to Bucky in a low voice, and nods over to Clint. "He's going to be my new best friend, nothing more. Besides, he very clearly has eyes for someone who
When he reaches Tony's side, he's started seizing, his whole body convulsing. Thor is there, too, and he tears the glove off of Tony's hand. The convulsing stops, and Tony is eerily still. He's in the armour, so Steve can't see his face or check his vitals, but he won't let that stop him.
"Jim," Rhodey offers, smiling. "Good to meet you, Steve. Heard a lot about you."
"Alright, then, sir, what's this about?" he says.
"Thanks, Rhodey," Tony says a little softer. "I owe you."
"You always were a sucker," Bucky agrees, and Steve basks in the wave of relief that Bucky hadn't been offended or hurt by the joke.
“Is it stable?” Steve asked.
It was too much. There was literally four inches of table separating their hands. He could see the curve of his eyelashes, the quirk of his lips. God, he could really notice the
“What do you mean ‘uh-oh’?” Steve exclaimed.
That year, Tony planned to get some (semi-illegal) fireworks for Steve’s birthday. Clint and some random dude in Texas may or may not have been involved.
“So, what am I supposed to do in the meantime?” he demanded.
Nah. He needed to be honest.
Seeing no point in staying where they were and increasing the chance of someone finding them, especially when their ride was so close, they headed to the parapet that made up the 73rd floor.
But as soon as everything stopped getting thrown around and the dust settled, Tony swooped in and convinced Bruce to stay where Ross couldn’t touch him.
Oh shit. Tony felt himself pale.
That made Tony smile. Peter deserved to have vindication for all the work he put into studying and doing his assignments, even when his own brain seemed to work against him. He hated that grades were so important in their society, but as long as that was the focus of their education system, he hoped they would be a positive aspect of his school years.
“Quiet,” he hissed, grabbing the back Tony’s shirt and pulling them back against a wall.
? And then was he Team Kirk or Team Picard?
Tony tried to focus, he did, but when the body calls a quit, it
“Yes?” Steve drawled, looking a little unsure.
She gave him a smile and came into the kitchen specifically to pat him on the shoulder. “Don’t worry, you’re only obvious to everyone who knows you. I approve, unless I find some dirt on him. But most importantly, you have a good head on your shoulders. Whatever you decide, or whatever happens, we’re here for you.”
“Not that I would ever,” Peter quipped. “Not in your class at least.”
Their arguments became legendary. Somehow, no one affiliated with the news or paparazzi got wind of the semi-regular meetings, but their friends all did. There was endless teasing and sometimes even larger arguments around cups of coffee and muffins.
“Quite,” Steven replied. “It appears that Miss Alice, the younger girl here, here was practicing with some magic that was a little out of her current capabilities. Miss Lorna, her older sister, discovered the mischief.”
He thanked every deity out there that he didn’t cough up the spines, just the flowers of a cactus. It was a little rougher than other flowers, but still, god, that was close.
Steve watched Tony and Peter out of the corner of his eye. They seemed to be discussing something serious; their moods changed completely from the bubbly happiness a few moments ago to something with more eye rolls and obvious annoyance. He couldn’t hear, as he was focusing on other students and their parents, but he was still curious.
“Tony,” Pepper hissed, her heels clicking on the polished tiles of Stark Industries.
pretty sure about was that no one was looking this far up for anyone. Emergency response teams were focusing on the people who managed to come down and putting out any fires there might be. Police might catch one or two suspicious people, but as far as he knew, no one was looking for him here either. He was still a high-profile missing person. The people who did know where he was, well, why would they alert local authorities?
“What about Natasha?”
“Noon?!”
“Ah,” he replied, picking up the flower. “I owe you an apology. This is a native to my homeland. The name does not translate well, so calling it the heart-shaped herb is easier.”
He didn’t mention how there were all sorts of other little signs, going back to when they first met. The slang from the 1940s, how he’d had to catch up on so many books and movies. A lot of his world views, from politics to veterans to climate change. Telling him all those details was a little too much right now. He could see this conversation going in all sorts of ways: anger, resignation, denial. The breaking of whatever this relationship was.
That was better than what was currently attached to his sternum.
“Oh, no. You don’t realize how mad Pep can get. She runs the company like clockwork and hates it when I throw a wrench in the machine.”
“He does,” Natasha confirmed. “You’ve been through ruts yourself. You know how instincts can mess with your head. This is just hitting him harder than usual.”
She gave him an even look. “Like you ever order anything else.”
Maybe that was why he ended up on Steve’s doorstep. He was heading there anyways and it was close by. He knew it was somewhere safe too.
Tony and Clint were brothers in disappointment.
And if he snuggled into it, JARVIS wouldn’t betray him.
“Fine,” he grumbled, pulling away. “But if you do anything …”
“Got anything with caffeine in it?”
