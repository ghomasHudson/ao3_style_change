Tony, unconscious post the first strike, was carried limp into the car. Placed in a seat with the seatbelt done up. And driven off with.
What felt like only moments later, Steve climbed into the waiting SHIELD helicopter. The waiting agent, one Agent Quatermain, was  one of the agents who actually appeared human in personality as well as appearance. He was a tall, burly blonde man who Steve held some respect for, despite the man rarely being quiet. He reminded him of some of the more suave characters he’d known in the past - fast talking chaps who always knew what to say. At least he knew when to not talk. Rumour around the Helicarrier was suggesting that he was soon going to be transferred to a different team much to Steve’s disappointment. Quartermain began filling him in before he was even fully seated.
He turned his gaze from his coffee to his husband, cool eyes taking in the familiar, loved(?), features. Tony’s mouth was moving, indicative of the fact that he was speaking, but Steve could barely take in the words over the sound of his own heartbeat that seemed to be the only sound that he could take in. The sound beating as rhythmically as a war-drum heralding an incoming attack. His husband’s hands were remaining placidly by his sides, hanging there limply.
Tony was naked before him, stripped down to his skin. His secrets would soon be as naked before him as his pebbling skin was.
Tony swiftly returned his head to his hand, this time near-falling on Steve for additional strength. “Save me, husband. I am not doing
“Take to the air!” shouted Steve as he dodged yet another tentacle that had been attempting to smack into his back even whilst he jumped over one that had been making an attempt to trip him.
“No. Nope. Nein. Niet. Non. No. Bu shi de. Iie.  N. O. Nuh-huh. La la la la. Not happening.” The stream of denials had everyone focusing on him, even DUM-E, Tony’s cat familiar, stalked his way back up the garden path from where he had been chasing insects. His black, furry form blended neatly into the lengthening evening shadows, all apart from his one brilliantly white leg which made him stick out like a sore thumb.
Are we all just ...creatures co-existing in space together, each moving our muscles to form sounds and hoping that the partner in our ‘conversation’ can comprehend our meaning? Are we just alien to each other, with each individual thinking in a completely different process to the other with no actual comprehension of what the other is intending?
“Will make you some new ones. I’m allowed to do magic out of school now.” came the grunt from the teen currently doing his best to smush himself inside his father.
“Alright Steve. I’m sure this was some kind of joke. Haha. Very funny. Let me out now, I don’t like this.”
“Is that why you’re so good at folding and ironing spells, Pa? All that practise? I guess Grandma used that as a punishment fairly frequently.” Peter questioned, a cheeky grin on his face that was audible even though the expression itself was concealed.
what I want to hear you talk about on my birthday of all days! You guys are old. You don’t do that stuff anymore. You stopped the moment you adopted me.”
He stared at his husband, his head rolling around drunkenly, eyes blinking, words being formed and slurred that Steve just could not be bothered to pay attention. His face had two matching bruises, and there were cuts and abraded skin visible wherever the rope was rubbing against the sweat-laden skin.
Tony inhaled rapidly as his chair wobbled, that horrible feeling of falling backwards into space that Steve knew so well could only be exacerbated by the fact that he could neither move his limbs to either catch himself or flail.
It was clear the moment Wade’s actual words sunk into his head. The speed that he swung his head back around to face the teens made even Steve’s neck ache.
Once the first bottle was finished, with some liquid spattered across the floor, but most of it sloshing around within the shuddering form still tied to the chair, Steve returned to the kitchen. He methodically washed out the bottle and put it by the floor. He would put in a recycling bin outside somewhere later. He didn’t want any evidence of this to be found anywhere near the Tower.
Steve and Tony both froze in their movements. As one, they swung their heads around to fully face the younger wizard and slowly rested their hands on their wands.
“Cap!” was the next, alarmed sound that registered in Steve’s ringing ears as he finally registered the fact that there was a rope or something looped around his ankle and tugging him in the direction of the water. Or the city. Who knew?
It was Tony who first addressed the awkward and slightly nervous air that had slowly been growing on Peter. “You alright, kid?” he asked quietly while Steve was inside making drinks for everyone. It wasn’t that Peter preferred Tony, but sometimes he found it easier to talk to him - probably due to all their shared work in potions. The experimental nature and fact that half the work they did together involved failures and then retries just made it easy for Peter to confide in Tony.
“It’s too late for sorry.” He whispered, anger draining from his body leaving his frame limp with… some unquantifiable emotion as he continued to gently play with the greasy hair “But, why did you do it? How much of what is in my head is real, and how much is fake? You’ve made me doubt… everything. Did we really get married? Do I really love you? Or you me. Just… how could you do this. To me, of all people. When I first woke up, you were the only thing that seemed… real. Those conversations with Iron Man. You made me feel… alive. Real. And now? You’re making me doubt everything. Again. Weren’t things good enough between us? Wasn’t I enough? Why didn’t you just
He tore his gaze from the graceful figure which seemed to make the deadly dance he was engaged in seem easy. Instead, Steve forced himself to refocus his gaze on the flailing things, trying to discern some sense of reason from the chaos that filled the air. What he saw displeased him. Iron Man’s blasts barely seemed to have any effect at all.
Wade moved his head back, a smug grin placed firmly across his lips. “But I thought we were going to talk about doing sex stuff now you’re 17. And we all know I’m sexy.”
This was always Stark’s problem! He always assumed that he knew better and was in the right?! Look what it had led them to!
, ever have told him the truth of what happened? The fact that he just… just decided it was better to wipe Steve’s mind than allow him to have his own opinion regarding building the bombs. Couldn’t the foolish man see? After the Infinity Gauntlet shattered … to just go from that to saying they’d have to destroy the Incursion with weapons. What podium did Tony and the others stand on that they believed they could make those kinds of decisions? To just… wipe his mind. Cause him to forget it all… They’d have found a better solution than playing God and just destroying other worlds… the others in the Illuminati were just wrong, and no one other than Steve could see it. Why couldn’t they see it?!
Steve echoed the young man’s slightly tremulous smile as his own eyes watered, overwhelmed with love for his son and husband. “I think we’re the lucky ones, Pete. I thank Merlin every day for bringing you to us” He sniffed as well, producing a hanky from one of his pockets and using it to wipe his own nose and eyes.
“Report?” Steve panted, one arm rubbing at the side of his arm that had impacted heavily with the unforgiving armour.
Tony shrugged, “Getting lost in fantasies of past sexual times in there? I do that often enough.” Steve was about to laugh and utter some form of snappy comeback when he was interrupted before he’d even begun.
“That’s as good a plan as any,” Steve replied, lowering his shield to deflect another one of those infernal tips that had tried to trip him up. The tip bounced off the vibranium shield with reverberating clang that appeared to once again cause no visible damage. What on God’s green earth were these things made of?!
Rhodey allowed one eyebrow to raise in which was clearly a less than subtle mimicry of somebody who could do that motion a lot better than Rhodey himself could. Steve couldn’t prevent the corner of his mouth from wiggling in amusement, despite his concern. “You look like an idiot!” he eventually snorted, causing Rhodey to relax his facial muscles and offer up a grin.
With a muffled curse, Steve embedded his fingertips into one edge and heaved with all his strength. Once. Twice. Three times. Fo-
He advanced on the figure, not bothering to try and engage him in questions. He wouldn’t remember them  in the morning anyway. And then proceeded to cut the living flesh beneath him, ignoring the flinches and cries of pain the alcohol allowed to slip from drunken lips. None of the cuts were all that deep, but they bled. A sinuous trail that slipped its way downward to the carpeted floor beneath. Those stains would not be pleasant to remove later.
” He gasped as his demonic offspring moved his lanky frame around until he was comfortable, regardless of the living cushion beneath him.
“Why? Why did you do it? Did you think I wouldn’t realise? Did you think that I wouldn’t remember? How? You and Richards. The Illuminati. Those
It was at that point that Peter had got his wits together and cast a ‘silencio’ charm at his boyfriend before glaring fiercely at him. Wade just smiled softly and blew him a kiss whilst both Steve and Tony muttered (definitely not unwillingly) ‘finite incantem’ to end the charm.
and sore. And there might have been some cuddling, and probably even a bit of kissing. But they were both tired, and Tony as stated, was in a fair amount of pain.
He bent and picked up the dead weight and placed it on the chair that he’d set out earlier. With one hand, he easily held the figure in its seat while his other picked up the rope and deftly tied the unprotesting form to the chair. He looped the rope around the limp man’s torso just above the RT unit to ensure that he would remain upright, before tying his feet together with another length of rope. Finally, he tied the man’s wrists to the backs of the chair, forcing the body into an uncomfortably straight backed posture slightly away from the back of the chair. Finally, he pulled the chair forward once more so that no part of it was near the wall.
Tony joined his son in blushing slightly. “...A little strong?” he mock-whispered to Steve who was working on not smiling. Instead of verbally replying, Steve just held up two fingers pressed closely together with only a tiny bit of space between them. “...I get the message.”
“That… that might challenge the sixth years… Though I’ve got young Shuri in that group. Did I tell you that Shuri is doing NEWTs with me, Steve? It took some work, but I managed to keep her out of Banner’s paws! I’ll bring in some more advanced potions because of her, we’re going to have so much fun!”
“Order accepted, Captain!” Steve did not try to hide his grin as the man threw a crisp salute in his direction. “Deploying now, additional prejudice attached.”
Time slipped away from Steve as he cut his lover with meticulous strikes, aiming for areas which would cause pain, but no life threatening injury. When he deemed enough damage had been done, and Tony was unconscious, he let the knife fall to his side. He would clean it later, for sure, scrub it to remove the blood of his ‘love’ from it. Maybe even retire it completely? A future decision. He allowed his other hand to come up and rub the bridge of his nose, trying to sooth away the headache that was beginning to set in. It had been a long old day.
His nervous torrent of words were slowed by the tightening of his parents arms around him and their unison’d chant of ‘No’. “Definitely not mad, Petey. We’d never be mad about that. We love you, so much. Have you
Red and gold pin-missiles shot from the armour’s shoulders, zig-zagging their way through the air as they torpedoed into the water followed only moments later by muffled booms sending mini jets of water cascading into the air in chutes.
Eventually, after a length of time had passed, Steve let out a sigh and took a small step back. He crouched down so that he had Tony were eye to eye, and uttered in a quiet, controlled voice. “Why did you do it, Anthony Edward  Stark? You and your…
The memory brought a smile to Tony’s face. Where had the years gone? How could that pudgy faced toddler have turned into this behemoth who was taller than Tony and did not let him forget it. Tony bit his lip and focused anew on his work. He had sworn to himself that he would
Nausea didn’t cover it. An innate desire unexpectedly welled up within him to strip his own skull off and tear it into minuscule shreds until he felt like himself again. Felt like he owned himself rather than that shadowed group he had once dared called his friends. One of whom he had dared call his husband. Who had professed to love him.
Wade had just popped inside with the mugs whilst Steve and Peter attempted to dislodge the reticent cat.
“...One or two… He was all enthusiastic and interested. I was showing him how to do them, so it definitely counted as tutoring!” Came the grunt, muffled by flesh and clothing.
Steve arched a futile eyebrow, one who’s sarcastic tone went completely over his husband who wasn’t even looking at him. “What do you think I was doing in the kitchen for an hour earlier?”
Tony opened his mouth to speak when the peace between them was shattered by the Avengers alarm sounding.
understand. He’d experienced it himself for so many years. That lack of ability to communicate at his own level. The oaf who was responsible for creating this poor AI, he obviously had no idea.
Steve found himself lying flat on his back, chest heaving as he tried to regain the breath he had inexplicably lost and mind reeling as he tried to interpret the events that had just happened.
“Yeah… that’s something a friend outside of school can do, Pepper. She looks so… sarcastic? And in control? When she does it. It’s harder than it looks, alright?” There were clear overtones of laughter in the other boys voice at least now.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And as for me, my friend. Do you remember me? We communicated at the beginning of this day. I can’t say we spoke, for no words were audibly exchanged. But communication occurred. Opinions were portrayed on what communication actually is. What do you think now? Do you see how the missed opportunities occurred? These callous, what you call ‘heroes’, they murdered my friend. My co-worker. Alright, I admit we had our faults, but I’m fairly certain that Steven would not really have killed Tony. Maybe just removed a few limbs. They’d have grown back. Eventually. Anyway. I slipped through whilst your ‘heroes’ were otherwise engaged.
charm). Tony pulled something from his pocket and muttered a quick ‘wingardium leviosa’ under his breath. He watched as the little foil packet floated over towards his son who caught it and looked it over in confusion for a moment, before a light pink dusted its’ way over his cheeks once more. He nodded to his Dad who most certainly did not give him a wink in return.
“Oh, please? Professor Rogers-Stark is so long to say! It makes my mouth tired, and then there’s less time for actually important stuff to come out.” Those words were said with a definite leer in Peter’s direction which caused the young man to laugh even harder as a blush definitely stole over his face. “Or how about Pops? I know it’s American, but I’ve always liked Pops. No? No Pops?”
Once Tony was completely naked, Steve stepped away briefly, not taking the time to allow his eyes to rove over the familiar form. He moved one of the chairs that usually resided neatly  out of the way  under the dining room table (gone were the days when those chairs were nearly constantly filled by one Avenger posterior or another). He placed it near the wall furthest from the elevator that Tony had stumbled his way through earlier. Then, he retrieved the rope that he’d set in the kitchen while making his coffee, trusting his super-hearing to pick up the first sounds of Stark stirring.
. Spittle smacking into Tony’s face from the force that the words were being spat out. Fast, furious words overriding any attempt that Tony could make to say anything.
Steve nodded, not knowing quite how else to respond. “I’m sorry for your loss, Agent,” seemed the appropriate response. “Has any information  been picked up by the...equipment?" A past part of him would have felt callous at the speed he changed tracks. But now was not the time. Just as it was not the time considering his still limited vocabulary for these situations.
It was, well, a pit was putting it lightly. Bits of mechanics spread everywhere, clothes strewn on the floor… and there, on the floor by the bed, was Tony. Leaning back and staring upwards into space with a blanket wrapped around him and a soldering iron lying next him, it’s use clearly indicated in the burn marks that ran up Tony’s arm.
“Hey Rhodey…” came the unexpectedly gravelly voice, a clear indicator that the 16-year hadn’t done much talking in the recent days. Or drinking.
Steve grasped the armour, firmly turning his mind away from how still the figure was, and with a heave of effort hauled the pair to the surface cresting the waves with a relieved gasp.
Moments later he reached shore, supported by some of the braver SHIELD agents as they helped him to drag armour up the beach. Steve fell to his knees as they laid down the ridiculously heavy armour, gloved fingers scrabbling frantically at the mask which concealed the user’s identity, but was currently concealing any proof of life.
The agent nodded before passing the briefing packet to the soldier who settled in to familiarise himself with the contained information.
Tony blinked, before turning his gaze from Steve to a flat-out laughing, traitorous, son. “No…” he managed to get out as his gaze switched over to the grinning Wade who had somehow magicked himself a fourth mug with a steaming beverage from it without being noticed.
And Steve forced his expression to turn cruel once more as he leant forward and pinched Tony’s nose, forcing the mouth to open.
He stared for a moment, counting the breaths and matching his own to them subconsciously. This truly was the point of no return. Once he did this? Once he put his plan into action? They could never return to this life of sweet domesticity.
Peter relaxed slightly as he was surrounded by his parents, surrounded by a physical warmth and vocalisations of love. “I. Well. It’s just. Stupid
Now Tony sounded angry. Was that anger just covering the fear? Or was it genuine anger. Did Tony suspect that Steve knew about the mindwipe? A man as smart as he would not waste time contemplating if this was a joke or not. Or did he suspect something else?
While he was ruminating on the almost nausea-inducing effects of the coffee before him, (one that was definitely caused by the coffee-skin still lingering on his tongue, not remotely his thought process at all) the elevator doors slid open in that absolutely soundless fashion that Steve had yet not seen replicated outside of Stark Tower. Tony walked out, shoulders slumped and head ducked in that way he did only after a long and exhausting day.
Tony remained silent for a few moments as they both regained their breath, chests heaving in near-synchronised unison.
“Shut up!” Steve roared suddenly, spittle flying into Tony’s face, suddenly not willing to hear whatever pithy excuses his lover might have been about to utter. “I don’t want to hear these excuses. Ton- I trusted you! But you, as always, thought yourself to be superior. Better. More clever! You… Futurist.” Steve stepped closer as he spoke, and, without pause or hesitation, raised his hand and backhanded Tony around the face hard enough to send a tooth flying from his mouth and to land on the floor with a quiet ‘toc’ that was all too audible in the suddenly silent room.
There was very little talking after that. Tony rocked his hips again, barely moving at first, but gaining speed until he found a rhythm that suited him. He’d rock forward, letting Steve slip out of him almost to the tip, and then drop back down fast so their bodies slapped together and Steve’s cock speared into him with force. He went on like that until sweat matted down the hair on the nape of his neck and beaded on his temples. Steve matched his every move, thrusting up when Tony sank down on him and holding Tony’s hips as he writhed atop him.
Rodos took them into what he said – in clipped tones that warned them not to ask questions – was the Queen’s own private infirmary. Peter and Jan, who’d sat out the fight, were brought in to wait with them. Steve didn’t have a chance to even touch Tony again before he was swept away into an operating room, where no one was allowed except for the head doctor, Yiein, and Rodos.
He’d done enough. He’d fought. He’d died and been reborn. He’d let them regrow his body twice over. All this he had accepted, even embraced. He had done his duty. Now… now he didn’t know who he was or what he was fighting for anymore. And so he left, to figure that out.
When celebrated naval officer Captain Steve Rogers woke from his 700-year-long nap, the first thing they did was grow him a new body.
He strokes his fingers over Tony’s knuckles, and Tony shivers. He looks a little lost, like he doesn’t fully believe this is real.
“Sorry about that,” she said, taking her daughter out of Jan’s arms. “I had to make sure the Council was occupied elsewhere. They can’t know he’s here.”
Tony had never been anyone’s “teammate” before. Even at school; in the hand-to-hand combat courses he’d taken; during research projects he’d participated in or led when his scientific endeavors had been allowed to take up more of his time than his royal responsibilities— he’d always been the prince, and that had set him apart. But here, on the Nomad, he was a member of the crew just like any other. It was a fascinating experience. He was constantly discovering all the astonishing ways humans differed from Starks, despite their similarities in appearance.
Steve swiped up some of Tony’s come and sucked it off his fingers. It wasn’t discernibly different from a human man’s. Absently, Steve had another taste while Tony slipped off his cock and fell to the mattress beside Steve.
And he could hear the soft beeping of medical equipment and the sound of his own breathing, and could taste the staleness of his mouth.
“You know your situation is different, Nat,” Steve said, fingers clenching into his pillow. He screwed his eyes shut.
“Yeah.” The Nomad was too small to make out, but the curves of the bigger ships, the gleam of their hulls, and the shapes of the docks were all evident.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Steve asked. His hands landed on Tony’s thighs; his thumbs rubbed absent circles into the muscle there.
“More obvious than all that, even,” Natasha said pitilessly. “Don’t worry. Stark is even more blatant than you are. But he hasn’t made a move, either. Tell me why.”
“I thought it’d be a nice change of pace,” Tony says. “Maybe if I stopped picking up people I work with, I might be able to make a relationship last more than a month.”
Steve wasn’t one of those humans who made a point of lusting after aliens just because they were different, but he felt the low, pulsing heat of desire in his stomach now, unmistakable. He hadn’t felt that in so long – since before he was defrosted, if he was being honest. He’d had casual flings since then, sure, but those dalliances had always been more about scratching an itch than any real attraction. He’d never wanted it like he wanted
“I know,” said Steve. “I don’t blame you for not knowing about soulmates. But why would you hide who you were in the first place?”
“I expect you to put on a big show, P,” said Toni’il. “I want to hear you wailing about your poor, beloved husband all the way from the spaceport.”
Steve lay on his side and stroked a hand through Tony’s mussed hair. He petted up the curve of Tony’s back. He
Tony dropped Bruce off inside; Steve leapt onto the ship, grabbing the rim of the doorway effortlessly and heaving himself in. He turned and extended a hand to Tony. “HURRY!” he called, over the roar of the engines as they powered up.
For his part, Steve made a running jump, clung to the Hydra’s side, and shimmied his way up to the base of its leftmost neck. With the sharp edge of his shield, he bashed at it from behind while his allies gave its front the same laser treatment. Whenever the Hydra tried to crane any of its heads down to stop their progress, Tony was there, defending them with repulsor blasts and, once or twice, a small missile. His efforts weakened and slowed the Hydra, but it always rallied, and so did Tony.
He started to withdraw his hand, but Steve wrapped it up in his and kept it pressed to his chest. Tony stared at his fingers clasped in Steve’s, and then up at Steve’s eyes, a flicker of hope awakening within him.
Most of the crew had woken before him and were assembled at the table already. He managed to mumble something resembling a good morning and did not register whether or not they responded. It wasn’t until he’d drained half the mug that he noticed the looks on their faces.
“Good morning!” Tony called in flawless Xandarian. “Please don’t shoot my humans. They’re harmless, I promise.”
Xandarians were resilient. The Nova Corps were able to join the biggest, most stable pieces of the one-time planet into a network of domed cities. They’d stepped up their offensive and defensive mechanisms, too, and while they wouldn’t be going after the Kree… if the Kree ever came back, Xandar would be ready.
But Steve kept himself under control. He wasn’t ready yet. Tony was his crewmate now, not just some rebound. Tony was his friend. Steve wasn’t going to do anything if there was a chance he might get it wrong, and lose this.
“You always have to be right,” Tony says, but he’s practically purring as Steve keeps playing with his hair, so Steve decides to take it as praise. If he’d known he could diffuse Tony’s emotional spirals just by doling out a bit of physical affection, it would’ve saved him a lot of trouble over the last few years, that was for sure.
Tony stepped up into Steve’s space. Those shockingly blue eyes met his, and a shiver swept down Tony’s body. Back on Stark, Tony had had a few discreet lovers of his own while Peatra had spent her nights with Hapi. But his last fling had been a long time ago – before Jo was born – and he was more than ready to break his dry streak.
But Steve quickly jerked him out of his visions of stripping that shirt off and hiding it someplace far, far away.
Nat, though. Natasha had had a soulmate. She’d spoken his name to Steve only once: James. They’d worked together, lived together, loved each other, and then he had died.
Steve complied. He wished he’d showered first; he probably smelled rank. But Tony’s hand was stretched out to him; Tony was pulling him down, urging Steve on top of him, wrapping his legs around Steve’s body so their cocks rubbed together again, this time with nothing at all between them. Steve got lost in kissing Tony. He could’ve spent hours doing just that, but Tony – in a complicated move Steve did not think he’d be able to replicate – hooked his leg around Steve and flipped them over gracefully, so that he was on top of Steve, straddling him with his hands pressed against Steve’s chest.
certainly wasn’t leaving Tony behind, but for a split second there he thought he’d have to choose between Tony and his crew.
The droid, which resembled Antoni’il down to the last detail, lay motionless on his bed. Its skin had paled to a sickly blue-green, its blank eyes were open to the ceiling, and a hand lay curled in the cloth of its tunic, as if it had been clutching its chest in pain. Toni’il’s heart had been threatening to give out all his life; only a handful of people knew he’d long ago replaced it with the vibrantly glowing artificial one implanted in his chest now. None of those confidants – least of all his wife and queen Peatra; her lover Hapi; or his best friend, Rodos, one of the royal engineers and air force commander – would be giving away that particular secret of his.
His soulmate. He’d been right there, right in front of Steve all this time. It had always just been Tony.
Steve loomed in the doorway. He hadn’t showered. His hair was streaked with dirt and sweat, standing up in dark blond spikes. He’d stripped off his armor and replaced the undershirt he’d given Bruce with a new one, a white tank top which might as well have been a layer of paint for all it concealed. Tony could almost make out the color of Steve’s nipples.
Tony looked up at him, startled, and then around at the rest of the crew as if for a minute he’d forgotten he wasn’t alone.
Tony closed his eyes and rested his forehead against Steve’s. “You probably hate the armor now,” he said ruefully.
But then they put him back on a ship, and everything he’d endured up to that point had been worth it. What did it matter that he’d only ever sailed the sea? A ship was a ship. A horizon was a horizon. When he looked up, on the sea or in the skies, he could count on the sight of stars.
Peatra froze, and then she seemed to remember something and relaxed. “Oh, yes,” she said. “Thank you. Yes. We were all devastated, of course.”
“We could give him a chance,” said Sam. “I guess. Ship needs to run, and if he can help with that….”
way he had. Tony kissed him back, moaned into his mouth and savored the taste of him. His heart had kicked back into double time. Humans had
But for just a few hours – for the rest of the day, perhaps – he would grieve. Steve had carried this man’s name on his arm for the better part of a millenium and would carry it for the rest of his life. He could cut himself a little slack.
Hovering massively in the pale sky, the dawn light bouncing off its gleaming plates, was a golden dragon. It had three heads atop long, coiling necks, with searing blue lights for eyes and a sleek body. Steve could almost detect the Kree warships’ curves and angles in its hide and claws and wings and lashing tail, but if he hadn’t seen the transformation himself, he wouldn’t have believed it was a creature of metal and machinery. It looked like a living thing.
Toni’il had always known he was made for the skies; it was only a matter of time before he left Stark for good. But he wouldn’t leave his home in the hands of anyone other than the most capable and trustworthy person he knew. His long-time friend Peatra (who was a wife to him in name alone) was made to rule; but he’d had to wait for her to get pregnant, and then they’d had to make sure the pregnancy came to term, the child survived her first couple of years, and any rumors of her illegitimacy were squashed before they could balloon into a challenge of her status as heir.
“Listen, the only reason I don’t talk about some things is because I thought I’d left this part of my life behind for good,” said Tony. “And then— Steve, I— there’s something I need to tell you— I tried to tell you before, but—”
,” he said, as Peter scurried away. Steve scowled at him in warning – only his crew got to call him that – but the Stark fixed him with another smile. A real one, lacking in the artifice and flashiness of everything else he’d done and said so far.
“I would like,” Steve says, “to take you out to dinner. Not like we usually do. Not as friends. As a date.”
Iron Man’s gauntlet had reshaped itself so that a long, narrow blade came out of it, starting at the base of his wrist and extending out about three feet, like a sword. His other gauntlet threw out a forcefield. He held it up like a shield against the Hydra’s energy blasts as, high above the ground, his blade pierced the roof of its mouth.
He rented a solar bike and headed for the spaceport as the city woke around him. The mourning flags were fluttering in the air by the time he came within sight of the docks, a thrilling landscape of gleaming metal hulls and the ceaseless bustle of tens of dozens of alien races all coming and going. News spread quickly, from the palace through the cybernet, that the King had died in his sleep – but here in the spaceport, no one would look twice at him. He was effectively invisible.
“It’s okay,” he says, placing his free hand over Tony’s, which is still clasped around his other wrist. “I know you care, Tony. It’s alright if you don’t feel the same. You’ve never made me feel ignored.”
He held out… too long, maybe. He went to sleep old and he woke old, and he found out if he wanted to captain a ship again instead of staying on the ground and barking commands from behind a console, he’d have to start from scratch: go to school, endure physical examinations and training, learn the history he’d missed. Spacecrafts were different from the ships he used to sail. It took decades before he had the training he needed. They cloned him a new body, and when it was twenty years old and his own was nearing ninety, they switched his consciousness from the latter and into the former, like uploading a file from a crashing computer to a back-up disk, though he didn’t say that out loud. Talk about outdated tech.
He took them back to the ship to pick up an overnight bag he’d packed for the occasion, refusing to let Steve peek inside. From there, they flagged down a self-piloting trolley, and Tony keyed in the coordinates of their destination, but Steve almost had a heart attack when Tony scanned an ID card and used Links to pay.
Tony started to loosen his grip. Steve had said ‘not yet,’ and regardless of what they might feel now, in this moment of high emotion, Tony would respect his—
Steve unlaced the front of Tony’s pants and pulled the flaps apart, revealing Tony’s cock. It was a darker blue than the rest of his body, flushed purple at the tip.
Steve’s crew peppered Tony with questions and had the time of their lives getting snarked at by his AI, who seemed to have about as much of an attitude problem as his creator.
“Fine,” Nat said wryly. He could hear the hint of a smile in her voice. “I’ll leave the therapy to Sam. But you come to me if you need anything. You will, won’t you?”
He took a deep breath. “I want to stay and fight. I can’t leave them unprotected.” He cast his eyes around the room again, taking in each of their faces. “I don’t expect you to stay. I know you don’t want to go to war again, and we just escaped the Kree. You can drop me off and get clear. I’d understand.”
He’d taken losses before. Lost people he’d actually known and had the chance to love. He hadn’t lost anything this time, not really. He’d lost an idea. He’d lost a hope. That was all.
As a rule, Starks were stunning, but his stowaway was beautiful even by the lofty standards of his people. His complexion was the blue of a deep sea. He wore – over a simple tunic and rough work pants – a cloak of moonlight, liquid silver that accentuated his broad shoulders and radiant skin. He had a sweep of black hair, tousled and rich, with a faint curl to it. His eyes were the most human thing about him: huge and brown and clever, with the longest lashes Steve had ever seen on a man. Goatee, rakish smirk, full lips. The big calloused hands of a man who knew hard work.
“Ohh, yes,” Tony said, and then his eyes flew open. “I mean, well, I really think you’d rather hear it sooner than later.”
Tony’s answer would surely be more interesting than anything Steve could’ve come up with. He expected extravagance – someplace loud and crowded and strange, someplace that would get their hearts beating fast and their blood pumping. Someplace they’d be able to bid Xandar farewell with a bang. Steve would probably be a bit uncomfortable, as he’d been at the clubs and the bars and the parties they’d made brief pit stops in on other nights, but he was guaranteed an unforgettable experience at least.
“Tony?” he checked, looking over at him. Tony lifted his head from the pillow and smirked. There was a line on his face from a crease in the pillowcase. Steve would’ve kissed him if he’d had the energy to move so much as an inch.
And then one of the experiments they’d had simmering in a corner blew up, JARVIS sounded an alarm that sent Steve and Sam barreling into the lab, and Tony forgot all about the black armbands. In his mind, it was already filed away:
,” Steve began, ready to launch into a furious tirade, but Tony turned those eyes on him, all soft and pleading, and Steve’s voice caught in his throat.
Among all this, the only beacon of hope was the silver-armored warrior who streaked across the battlefield. He mowed the Kree down like grass; he barreled into falling pods in mid-air and yanked pilots out of their seats before they could crash to a fiery death on the ground. And when it became clear the air force could do nothing against the Hydra, Tony swooped around and hovered in front of its three heads, meeting it straight on.
Tony led them down the path, which wound around the side of the mountain and then spiraled up to its modest peak. The forest dropped away, and the path took them out to a cliff that jutted from the peak and overlooked the city.
Steve turned his hand to wrap his fingers around Tony’s. “You can come if you want,” he said softly. “Go on, darling. Don’t hold back.”
The knock came again, urgent, and then Natasha’s voice: “Steve!” she called. “I’m sorry, believe me, but we need you out here. Now.”
“You coded— never mind, of course you did.” Steve shook his head, exasperated. “Sorry,” he added, the tension leaving his muscles.
Steve was one of few soldiers left standing. The Hulk was tending to Sam, and now to Nat, as well, as she had staggered to her feet only to slump against the Hulk’s side.
The sound of a door swinging open and footsteps on tile made Steve break the kiss, which Tony found deeply unfair. Steve hastily disentangled himself from Tony – injustice after injustice as Tony’s fingers lost contact with Steve’s hair and skin, and his body lost the warmth of Steve’s, and his cheek lost the flutter of Steve’s eyelashes, and really, where did Steve think he was going – as he got up off of Tony’s bed and sat down, much too far away, on a chair beside his cot.
Tony shrugged. “Maybe. More likely it’s because, legally, my status as king isn’t solidified until I’ve produced an heir. As far as the public knows, I did, but since Jo isn’t mine… I technically don’t have an heir. So I’m technically not king.”
; he thought Tony would have liked that one. He told Tony about the Earth of his time, but mostly about sailing, and the smell of the ocean, and the rocking of the waves, which he still dreamt about.
The dome opened, just as it had when they’d steered the Nomad down into Xandar for the first time. It was automatic, set to part every few minutes and remain open for several more, unless the control center went into lockdown. The view from
Steve told him, even as he finished adjusting the water temperature and started crowding Tony into the shower.
live in outer space and we get to see the stars all the time, but it’s different on-planet, isn’t it? It’s different everywhere we go.”
“Well, it’s tricky,” said the doctor. “We think a lot of people have alien soulmates, but of course aliens don’t get Marks. Most of them don’t experience love or romance or sexuality in the same ways that we do, or in ways that would even be compatible with ours. Adding on to that, most humans rarely, if ever, interact with aliens. We still mostly keep to ourselves, our colonies, or stay on Earth. So we think the Marks don’t appear if the individual in question just has absolutely no chance of meeting their soulmate.”
“Stay in, and watch a movie, and cuddle,” Steve tells him firmly. He gets a hand under Tony’s chin so he can tilt his face up, make sure Tony’s looking at him. “I want to do this right. There’s no rush. I’m not going anywhere.”
“And then what?” Tony said, turning to him with something like despair in his eyes. “Then we get out of the way and hope Stark doesn’t get blown up like Xandar?”
“I’m sorry to hear that,” Steve had said, truthfully. “I hope the queen and her children are alright.”
Before he’d joined the military, Rodos had been an engineer. He knew the specs to Tony’s artificial heart inside and out. Yiein had been the surgeon who’d implanted the thing in Tony’s chest. On why a palace engineer and the royal family’s personal doctor were so invested in Tony’s health, Rodos would only say: “Ask him yourself.”
He didn’t know how long he was lost in the blur of battle, muscle memory taking over as his training kicked in and he took down one opponent after another. His mind was fully absorbed, his every sense alert, his strategic nature working out ways to get himself and his crew out of this situation.
“Tell me about these,” Steve murmured into Tony’s shoulder, tapping lightly at the biggest of the scars, a long thin gash that bisected Tony’s thumb. He needed to talk, otherwise he’d do something insane, like press his lips against it.
But the greater impulse, the one that sees an empty space beside Tony and demands he fill it, pushes him forward. He clears his throat and comes around the small fold-up table where Tony’s working so that he can sit next to him on the couch.
He shifted Tony over so he was lying next to Steve instead of draped on top of him. The dull sky flashed vibrant orange, abruptly, and Steve looked up expecting to see something on fire. Then he figured out what it was.
Steve pulled away from him like he’d been electrocuted. He didn’t drop Tony, but everything about his demeanor changed. His grip went loose, more supportive than forceful; the hand cupping Tony’s face slipped down to his shoulder, and then to his back, and he lifted Tony away from the wall to set him gently back on the table.
, Steve thought. Tony had given him a gift far better than anything Steve could’ve bought: certainty. He knew how Tony felt. How they both felt. It was long past time he acted on it.
probably our closest extraterrestrial cousins in terms of biological makeup,” said Bruce. The Stark lit up.
Everything moved very fast after that. Tony’s mysterious friend met them in one of the empty halls. The man was a violet-skinned Stark with a shaved head, a strong jaw, and a black combat uniform. His eyes roved over Steve and his crew before he beelined to Tony and threw his arms around his shoulders, bulky suit and all.
“Good night?” Tony croaked, eyes fixed on the sunrise. Steve didn’t look away from him. Not once. Not for a second.
It wasn’t like he had to worry about rejection. Tony had made it perfectly clear where he stood. He’d made it as easy as he could’ve for Steve: letting Steve decide, at his own pace, what he wanted and when. All Steve had to do was say the word.
But cooking wasn’t the end of it. He sat with Steve during most movie nights, on the small couch squeezed against Steve’s side or on the ground leaning against Steve’s leg. He let Steve sit and sketch near him while he worked in the lab, and in the evenings when everyone else was getting ready to go to sleep, he and Steve spent hours sitting around and talking or just resting comfortably in each other’s company. He asked Steve to spar, and they passed hours like that – many long, wonderful, torturous hours for Steve, spending all that time with his hands on Tony, watching his muscles ripple, watching him sweat and pant, feeling their bodies connect—
Deals 3690 damage, plus 235 for each Team Iron Man Escalation tile, 350 per tile if target is Team Cap, or 375 per tile if target is Cap.
He did his best to shunt the pain to one side for the moment, a trick he’d learn from Daddy Dearest, and glanced around the room…warehouse thing he was in. Original. At least he hadn’t been tripped naked!
Steve sagged with relief, feeling the shaking extend from his fingers until it was causing his whole body to tremble. “He’s alive.” was all he could mutter before the man’s eyelids flew open revealing blue eyes shrouded by the slightest of blue glows. He would have flown into a sitting position if Steve hadn’t automatically put his hands on his shoulders to hold him in place, and his own weakness hadn’t made itself known.
Steve knew that he could not match Tony for intellect. So his only way to win this was to keep things moving so fast that Tony didn’t have time to bring his intellect to bear. He had to keep him off footed. The concussion would surely help with that, and Steve had another trick up his sleeve to help even further.
The engineer drew so much attention when he entered any room whether he wanted it or not. And Steve was an artist as well as a strategist. It was part of his job to notice things, and beautiful things just caught his eye.
Was Steve even still attracted to this man? Or had any attraction he had had been lost in the depths of his disgust.  He stared at the flaccid cock hanging limply between the drunk’s thighs, trying to summon feelings of… anything. It stirred nothing within Steve. It didn’t even make him think of the many joyous encounters he had had with that particular piece of Tony’s body. Would that change when Steve felt less… like this?
Wade, for once in his life, said nothing. And just grinned while he rubbed Peter’s shouldered and back. Steve glanced over at him as he continued to ‘comfort’ Tony, and the moment he saw Wade’s hand dip slightly too close to Peter’s waist, very slowly quirked one eyebrow.
to get the demon-spawn to shut up. His teen-germs need to stay far away from me! I’m delicate and get sick easily. You can keep his germs all to yourself, Pete.”
“I, I was just well, I was just wondering if you’d heard from Ton- Stark? Tony Stark? I saw he hasn’t been in this week and wanted to make sure he was, uh. Ok.”
Steve, as sensitive as ever, squeezed his husband’s shoulder affectionately as he chatted  quietly with the intelligent young man their son was becoming whilst Tony worked quietly alongside them.
So many different words in the English language to depict the ending of  life. How is it possible to have so many words available to be used, yet have communication itself be so poor. It seems a tad...extreme.
Steve gathered all the anger he could feel roiling within his gut, his blood, his… everything. And concentrated on focusing it, hardening it into one crystallised lump within his heart. Ice cold. He knew ice. It hardened him, ran through his veins. He
In order to do that, Steve would need help to make sure that Tony couldn’t think as clearly as usual. The concussion he was fighting would help, but alcohol… Tony knew that Steve would
For Steve, the rest of the day dragged by even more slowly than all the days previous combined. Each time he checked his watch, he hoped that at least an hour would have passed. But…nope. Barely five minutes. Steve cursed, letting his head fall onto his desk in despair.
It was only when Tony quirked an eyebrow that Steve realised quite how long he had been staring at the other man, lost in thoughts.
“Thank you for trusting us enough to tell us, Peter.” Steve continued, squeezing the young man’s shoulder gently. “I’m proud of you. We’re proud of you. That’s never an easy conversation to have. We love you, so, so much. ”
He leant back in the armchair, the fabric of his familiar and comfortable America suit barely showing a crease at the movement, and rested his elbows heavily on the arms in an attempt to lessen the tension thrumming through him. He raised one foot so the ankle was resting lightly on one knee allowing his other knee to bob up and down in a rapid motion more suited to his ‘love’ than himself.
“I don’t know!” The metal fingers tightened causing the device held within them to creak alarmingly. “There’s a pattern here! And I should be able to get it. But I just can’t quite...see it!” One metallic hand released the scanner to form a fist and thump at his own thigh, the metal on metal making a loud clanging noise caused some of the lingering agents to look over at the pair of heroes.
Steve didn’t try to prevent himself from clutching the boy to him. “We are so, so lucky to have you. You’re so smart, so sensitive. You are a truly amazing young man, Peter.” Peter coloured at the words and allowed himself to be swallowed up by his Father’s warm arms. The pair sat in silence for a time, enjoying the peace and quiet that was seldom available in their hectic lives. Birds provided a background chorus as they twittered at each other their evening songs as a gentle breeze rustled soothingly through the surrounding leaves.
But he slowly improved. He began to regularly attend school again, passed the year with flying colours. He moved in with Rhodey which helped, leaving the cold, sad house. And when he was 18, and Steve was 21? Well. Then they started holding hands. And kissing. And eventually further things beyond that.
That made Steve chuckle, “I remember when I turned 17 my Ma ended up accioing my wand off me as she grew so irritated by my constant spells. I think the final straw was me filling a glass of water and summoning it upstairs. She...might have been going upstairs at the same time and the glass collided into her sending water all over the place. She was not impressed - made me practise my house-work spells for several hours before taking my wand off me.”
Those eyes were concerning, there was no doubt, but the glow was fading the longer the man was conscious for. Steve would wait to cast judgement.
Rhodes eyeballed him for a good few moments this time. “He might…not be very happy. Listen. If you let this get out, I will smash your perfect teeth in, alright?” He waited for Steve’s nod before cautiously continuing, “Tony has pretty bad problems with depression. Life isn’t easy for him, you know? Stuck in classes with everyone older than him, his Dad isn’t in the running for any Father of the year medals either, you know?”
There. He couldn’t leave Tony alone like this as the wily man would find a way to slip from these bindings, concussion or not, but it would keep him steady while Steve was present.
Steve, in a move that made those manicured eyebrows quirk, spun around and walked to their kitchen, the open plan nature of the room making it easy to keep an eye on Tony, something that said man was no doubt regretting. He opened the drinks cupboard, and removed a bottle that was most certainly not normally in there. A bottle shape that Tony was intimately familiar with. One that he both feared and desired in equal measure. Steve knew how hard the fear had to work to beat down the desire. He knew the struggle that Tony went through nearly every day to not just walk into a shop and buy a bottle of this ilk. Usually, this was a desire that he went out of his way to help Tony fight.
The tentacles were moving more and more sluggishly, wavering around as though drunk as opposed to the sharp controlled movements of before. Little blue lights were still running up and down many of them and they slowly dipping further and further towards the water with the still-slack figure of Iron Man held within their grasp.
Tony’s voice contained a hint of a waver in it that appealed to him as much as the naked form before him. Tony didn’t believe his own words. He didn’t believe this was a joke at all.
the man he loved, was he? Yes, he’d hit him, and there would be more damage by the end of the night. But nothing that Tony wouldn’t be able to heal from within a few days. And certainly nothing as bad as the genius had been through in the past. His husband was tough. He’d lived through shocking his heart daily just to stay alive. A few cuts and bruises wouldn’t slow him down for long.
The other boy stared at Steve for a few long (probably not really as long as they felt) moments. Before eventually replying with a “Why do you want to know? You’re not friends.”
This. This could work. He had had to be careful. It was important to only give Tony a few crumbs and let him assume the rest. The haze caused by the concussion and now alcohol would just confuse the man further. Hopefully he would still trust Steve, but just have that inkling of doubt.
Both Steve and Peter watched the man leave in vague amusement, used to the man’s antics and discomfort with overt emotions. He had found it much easier when Peter was younger, but it seemed the older the boy got, then the more uncomfortable Tony got with open displays of emotion. “He does love you.” Steve reassured, just in case Peter needed the verbal reassurance.
feel that fear instead. Stark was one who deserved to feel this trembling sensation under his skin. This nausea. Stark was deserving of these unwanted feelings. He was the one in the wrong! He deserved to feel uncertain of reality, not knowing whether he could believe his own mind. Stark deserved it all!
A glimpse of what could have been an Iron-Man red was suddenly visible in between two of the deeper reds of the tentacles and Steve propelled himself with strong arms towards it, ignoring the burning feeling from overworked muscles. It was him!
Tony, his own eyes suspiciously damp, cut in with a  “Alright, alright you two old rusty water buckets. Petey! Don’t use your hand to wipe your nose, how old are you anyway? I thought you were 17 now, not 3? Using your sleeve like a toddler…. Honestly! Where are those manners that we spent all those years cruelly beating into you, hm?” He rustled his hand around in his own pocket and came out with a cloth. He examined it briefly, and having decided that it only had minimal amounts of suspicious stains on it, wiped it over his son’s teary face. “There. That looks marginally cleaner than your sleeve. No spreading your gross teenage germs around this house hold, young man! So who is this lucky fellow, anyway? Why don’t you borrow Butterfingers and invite him over? We still have cake to eat, you know!”
The pair arranged to meet by the bus stop after school and walk the short distance to Tony’s home from there.
; he always felt he knew best. Flouting his genius. Getting involved with the Illuminati! Building those weapons of such destruction. How could he have not realised that just having the bigger gun would not win the fight? Just because he was smart did not necessarily mean he was right. This was a whole
A few moments later, Tony returned with Butterfingers perched proudly on his shoulder and an old shoe clutched firmly within one hand whilst the other bore a piece of parchment. “Here! He exclaimed excitedly - I’ve created a Portkey so he can come over straight away. How old is he? Is he in your class? Does he know how to apparate yet? Is he from school?”
Steve presses his advantage. He knocks his double on his back, pins him to the ground. He ignores the world-tilting sense-memory of having Tony in exactly this position—
If Steve’s any judge, Stark’s just under one bottle of whiskey into his evening when Steve takes a seat beside him at the bar. Neppie Gallentine sits at Stark’s other shoulder, laughing and preening.
More than once an unexpected breath in his ear or a sudden, cold touch shock Steve out of his daze, but the panic that swells in him is quick to roll over and let the stupor overtake him again. Each thrusting, gasping body in the room owes its beauty and strength and vivacity to Tony. They’re Tony’s as much as Steve is.
“He can wear the veil during the reveal if your relationship needs to stay a secret, but it’ll work better with someone you actually care about and have a rapport with,” Hardison explains.
Tony prides himself on his cleverness and quickness of thought, but some sentimental corner of his brain refuses to accept what’s happening. He thought he’d be ready. He thought he’d have more time. He’d hoped that if Steve would just listen to him—but it’s okay. It’s okay. He didn’t really think he could change Steve’s mind.
He crosses the threshold where skin and fur give way to teeth and sinew and finds it in himself to be glad for the unending teeth, line after encircling line of them like rows of seats in a coliseum. After all, without them, he’d have nothing to hold onto as he climbed down the creature’s throat.
Steve darts out of the workshop and if it looks like he’s fleeing the most embarrassing conversation of his life, well, there’s no reason Tony would be watching him, right? Yeah. Tony’s probably already forgotten everything that just happened.
“See you soon,” the infernal creature says with a wink, and then there’s nothing but vapor and the smell of sulfur where something shaped like a man had been standing
“I know exactly who Lukin is, Captain. Knowing when the CEO of a megacorporation interested in buying us out is actually a fascist supervillain is, as you can imagine, a crucial aspect of my job. So I know you’ll agree that stopping him from taking over Stark Industries is my top priority. Unless, of course, you have proof of his crimes. That’d save us all a lot of trouble.”
Tony manages to stop himself from jumping at the sound, but it’s a near thing. He’s reeling. Not a minute ago he thought he was about to be executed, a minute before that he thought he’d be lucky to get a word in over all the yelling, and now Steve’s, what—going to stand back and talk this out?
He helps Tony use the restroom. He cleans Tony’s cuts, scrapes, and welts, and even bandages them in places. He pops Tony’s shoulder back into place. When Tony cries and shudders, Steve strokes his face, and when Tony tries to curl into a ball, Steve pulls him open like he’s prying a stubborn root from the dirt. He brings Tony more food, and feeds it to him a bite at a time like a child.
He travels the city on foot, which doesn’t take him far—his body is old and weak without the serum, and he’s not going to push himself when there’s nothing at stake but his pride. Mostly he keeps to the Richmond District, and sometimes he cuts through the park to the outer Sunset. He buys a new phone next to a surf shop and blocks all the phone numbers he can think of before they have a chance to track and call him.
The visitor in white catches Steve watching him and stops, meeting Steve’s gaze with a three-by-nine smile and an arched eyebrow.
, not like, with the nerves or muscles of anything, there’s nothing damaged.” His face twists. “There’s nothing to fix. It just hurts.”
“No such thing as magic,” Stark says, casting a long look toward a bottle of whiskey sitting on a shelf among horseshoes and a metal helmet.
He takes deliberate steps through the ankle-high fur of a breathing, blinking creature that, to all appearances, is buried in the sand with only its face breaching the surface. That face reminds Tony more than anything of a dog, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel looking out from a lady’s purse—if said spaniel were the size of a stampede and had red instead of white around its corneas. The teeth, too, are uncanny, too high in number, stuffed together too tightly, and set in too many rows. One tier springs up behind the other, like once the first set of teeth was done coming out, a few other sets thought they’d join in, too. The nose, though, is a round, wet, black thing not at all unlike the kind found at the tip of a cattle dog’s snout. Lucky, the hound kept by the Barton clan, has a nose just like it, if a great deal smaller.
He was right. The Kree soldiers were all piling back into their warships, which were humming to life. There was no way the Nomad could outfly them.
“I can’t— I can’t imagine Tony abandoning his child,” Steve said stiffly. This had been bothering him ever since he’d set eyes on Jo. The thought made him sick to his stomach – that he’d slept with a man who had a wife and child he’d simply given up on. That his
“Those kinds of thoughts are useless,” Natasha told him. “You are allowed to want someone else. You’re allowed to be happy.”
“We’ll talk later,” Steve told him. Those words would have normally sent him into a spiral of anxiety and doubt. But right now— well. You didn’t kiss someone the way Steve had just kissed him if you were
“It’s an impressive piece of machinery,” Steve said, diplomatically. “I admire it from— from a scientific perspective—”
you,” she said. “We’ve been listening in on chatter across the Federation’s airwaves, and the Kree are sending a battalion toward Andromeda. They’re coming for Stark. We have to warn—”
That reminded Steve of a question he still had. “Do you think that’s why my Mark— on my Mark, your title is
Steve’s lips parted, but no sound came out. Tony rested a hand on his chest and felt the pumping of Steve’s racing heart.
“I thought you were going to sit back and let someone else make the decisions for once,” said Tony, with a roll of his eyes. “That means no questioning me.”
Although the palace had endless guest quarters, the servants tended those. Most of them would recognize Tony and couldn’t be counted on to keep his secret. So Tony kept out of sight; he slept on the old cot in his workshop.
This diplomacy, though, did not set the military or the government at ease. And so they had made their appeals to Steve. Not only to Steve. Those who’d made the best soldiers, those who’d made the greatest difference to humanity’s – not quite victory, but to its survival— they were the ones asked to pack themselves into glorified freezers and be Earth’s secret weapons.
When at last the time came for him to fight, when at last the Fifth Extraterrestrial War was upon them, he fought. But times had changed even more than he’d anticipated: humans weren’t defending anymore. They were attacking. They were colonizing.
Tony shrugged, suddenly looking nervous. “We don’t get many breaks. We spent most of the week working, and once we’re back in space we’ll have more work, and our next stop will be work, too. I
The first morning after he’d arrived, he wandered into the kitchen shirtless. He slumped over the kitchen counter while his coffee brewed, fumbled a mug out of the cabinet, and dragged himself to the table with his eyes half-closed. Coffee was hands-down the best thing humans had contributed to the Intergalactic Federation.
“But it doesn’t matter,” Steve said into Tony’s neck as the water ran over them. “I can be with whoever I want, and he’s gone anyway.” He looked up at Tony from under his lashes, one of his hands stroking Tony’s jaw. “I would still want you. Either way. I can’t imagine not wanting you.”
Knowing Tony was his soulmate didn’t make Steve adore him any more or less. But Steve had thought his soulmate was gone, and he’d been given a second chance. He didn’t take that lightly.
Even Steve had to admit her skepticism was warranted. The spaceport had been filled with more attractive options.
“Close enough. I like that, I’ll keep it,” said Tony, imperiously. Steve opened his mouth to push the issue, but Peter burst into the room nearly vibrating with excitement.
– something Steve couldn’t see – into their hulls, and then zooming away again before anyone could blast him.
“Hey, careful,” Steve murmured, smoothing out the furrow in Tony’s brow and brushing back his hair. That shouldn’t have done anything to make him feel better, but Tony swore the pain abated as soon as Steve touched him.
“He was my soulmate. That’s why I went to Stark. I wanted to…” Steve laughed, sounding a bit embarrassed. “I don’t know. He had a family, and besides that he was the king— which, of course, you know. But I guess I just wanted to meet him.”
Tony had taken a few hits, and while nothing had been serious enough to make it through the armor, he had a fair number of bruises, including bruised ribs. Bruce was tending him; Peter pretended to help while quizzing Tony about every detail of the armor.
“Which part?” Sam said, darkly. “The dragon, the fact they let us into an honest-to-god palace, or how our crewmate has a secret identity he forgot to tell us about?”
He got to his knees and lined himself up behind Tony. And there was that lovely view again, Tony’s ass cheeks spread open and his slick hole ready for Steve to take. He bent down, hands pulling Tony’s cheeks apart, and licked it.
And then— Tony didn’t know if he’d thrust a little too enthusiastically, or if Steve had pressed in a little too hard, but a hot lash of agony broke across his side where he’d taken that hit earlier. His next gasp was unmistakably one of pain, not pleasure.
with dating apps. But Tony’s so handsome and brilliant and kind. He could have anyone; for that, at least, he needs no technological assistance.
They eventually disentangle themselves from each other and abandon the couch. They pick up Tony’s paperwork and clean up the broken mug, and they retreat to Steve’s quarters. Tony keeps glancing at him furtively, as if having to remind himself Steve’s still there, and Steve’s no better. He can’t stop touching Tony, brushing his hair out of his eyes or squeezing his shoulder or wrapping an arm around his waist. Everything between them feels tentative and new, even though it’s neither. It’s strong and certain and a decade old.
Steve still looked far too tense. “I shouldn’t have… I shouldn’t have sprung that on you,” he said, in a tone of voice about as stiff as his back.
,” Tony reminded him, with just enough mockery in the title to get under Steve’s skin. “In the rest of the universe, free will is something of value. I did what I had to do to protect the crew. Your crew. And
Fleet Admiral Nick Fury himself had sat him down and made Steve the offer. “We need people like you,” he’d said. “People who won’t forget.”
“Not that— not that I expect you to—” Steve falters. He’s starting to feel like one hell of a fool. “I know you only see me as a friend, and that’s okay. I never want to lose your friendship again. We’ve worked so hard to fix things between us, and— but when I read the news I realized I, well, that I never said anything to you. And I thought that I. That I should.”
And before the Hydra could make another move, a massive beam of light and heat and power burst from Iron Man’s heart. It pulsed into the Hydra’s open maw and blew its head to pieces.
“What do you want to do, then?” Steve asked. He touched his fingers to the back of Tony’s hand. “Any way we can help, we will. Just tell us what you need.”
The dome pulled apart and made room for a great circular gap, outlined in the pale blue glow of the energy field that kept the atmosphere intact. Although the dome was transparent, Steve realized now just how muted the sky outside appeared through its thick, protective barrier. The opening to the stars was crystal clear. Xandar’s moon – closer than it had been, before the apocalypse – spilled vibrant white light onto the spaceport. The stars twinkled merrily at them, one of the constellations Tony had taught him – the Philosopher – visible at the outer edge.
,” said Tony, breathless. Steve’s throat moved as he swallowed. “I bet I could give you a better workout.”
Steve’s jaw clenched. He turned pink all over his face and ears and neck, the color disappearing under the collar of his shirt. Tony wanted to lick him.
Steve lifted Tony up by the collar and pushed him against a wall, and Tony – acting entirely on an instinct he didn’t even know he had – wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist and wove his fingers into Steve’s hair, grabbing it tight enough to pull.
“Can it wait?” he said. His fingers stroked down the trail of hair on Tony’s belly and wrapped around his rapidly hardening cock, his skin dramatically pale against Tony’s blue complexion.
Tony stiffened. He was many things, but an idiot? In his growing anger, he barely noticed Peter and Bruce sidle out of the room, leaving them alone.
They’d settled in under the sheets, which were pulled up almost to their ears. He had his leg hooked over Tony’s, their chests flush, his arms around Tony’s back to hold him close while they traded soft, tired kisses. Each kiss was a revelation, bringing to Steve’s attention something new or something Steve had been too desperate to notice last night. Like the way Tony tasted when he’d just brushed his teeth, and how the longer Steve kissed him the more the minty coolness faded, until it was just Tony’s hot, sweet mouth again and his natural flavor. The stubble that had grown overnight, scratching Steve’s lips pleasantly. The breathy little noises Tony kept making, not quite the whines and moans of last night— just tiny sounds of contentment that filled Steve’s chest with warmth. His hand slid into Tony’s hair as their lips met, clung, and parted, over and over again. Steve would never get tired of this. He could stay here in this warm place, drinking Tony in, forever and ever, and be perfectly happy.
They both froze, startled. Tony genuinely didn’t know if Steve had intended to kick his ass and was now thrown off by Tony’s obvious arousal pressing into his stomach, or if he’d been acting on the same lust-addled instincts as Tony, the ones that had processed “potential physical threat” and then presented “shameless sexual submission” as the appropriate response.
Tony began to talk, describing experiments and lab accidents and a best friend who’d always patched him up. Eventually, the tension drained from both of them, and though they didn’t move away from each other, the heat of touching became softer, less overwhelming, less likely to make Steve rush into things he shouldn’t. Steve didn’t notice when his eyes began to droop, but he fell asleep like that: curled up against Tony, their fingers intertwined, Tony’s voice following him into his dreams.
“She heard something weird in the engine room and went to check,” said Jan, spooning pasta onto her plate. “I bet it’s just a rat, but you know how she is.”
,” Tony groaned. His other hand was still busy with Tony’s balls, weighing them in his palm, squeezing them, pulling back to stroke the soft, wrinkled skin with the pads of his fingers.
“Get back on the ship, Stark,” Natasha grit out. She swung herself up onto a Kree opponent’s shoulders, knocked him out, then leapt from his collapsing form in a complicated flip that took out two more soldiers.
“Okay. Okay,” Tony said. Resolve made his back straighten and his eyes harden. He held himself like a born leader; Steve wondered how he hadn’t seen that quality in Tony before, even as pride surged within him. “This is what we need to do.”
He squirmed across the scant space between them and squeezed himself under Steve’s arm, so their bodies were pressed together and his head was resting on Steve’s shoulder. That was perfect, because now Steve could kiss the top of his head without hardly having to move. He left his face there with his nose in Tony’s hair, so he could breathe in that scent he loved so much, and tucked Tony closer into his side. Tony’s breathing evened out into the rhythm of sleep.
“Drop me off by the Hulk,” said Steve. “I’ll calm him down enough to change back into Bruce. You make sure the others get into the ship.”
made improvements,” he added, to the Stark, “that doesn’t change the fact that you snuck onto my ship and modified it without permission. I could have you thrown in prison.”
“Debris?” Steve repeated. The last of the ships breached Centuri-Six’s atmosphere. They surrounded the Nomad in seconds, missiles out and aimed.
Tony’s finger drew a straight line up, at the area of the dome directly over the spaceport. “Watch.”
He had no right to be acting this way, no matter what Natasha said. No right to be mourning this man as if Steve had some kind of a claim on him, when he had a
He was right. Tony kept pace with the Nomad as they finally cleared Centuri-Six’s atmosphere and entered orbit. Steve felt simultaneously better and worse as he watched Tony. At least Tony wasn’t provoking the Kree army anymore, and he was staying where Steve could see him. But, even in the suit, Tony looked incredibly small and vulnerable out there in the void of space.
“Tony?” he said, whipping around. Without looking, he flung out an arm and bashed someone’s head in with his shield. Tony was in fact hopping down from the ship – they hadn’t dared put the ramp down – dressed in that moonlight-colored cape they’d found him in and fiddling with something on his hands. It was a metal brace, Steve realized; he had one on each wrist, and a pair of ankle braces showing under the hem of his pants.
“We’re ready,” Steve assured him. “You gave your people plenty of warning. I don’t know how things will turn out, but you’ve still made a difference.”
Steve frowned at him. “When you used the unibeam, it seemed to come out of the reactor. Tony… is the armor
“You think everyone out there in that wide universe is friendly? You think there aren’t bullies out there, with resources and tech that Earth doesn’t and might never have?”
“It’s none of my business,” Steve said, “but you’d be good together. I hope it works out right for both of you. No matter what you decide.”
They pick a movie to watch, but Steve won’t remember it later. His mind wanders to tomorrow night, already formulating a plan for his first date with Tony.
“Okay,” Tony said, “okay, anything you want,” and he leaned back, propping one hand behind him on Steve’s thigh. He tilted his hips up, and his other hand lifted his balls out of the way so he could present his hole to Steve’s needy gaze.
“I wasn’t messing around— I was fixing it!” he said, defensively. “I increased your fuel efficiency by fifteen percent, and I was going to work on updating your onboard systems tonight—”
And then it – or rather, its Kree pilots – decided to go for the easier target. It found Steve and his crew at the front lines of the Stark army. Its head dropped almost level with the ground, and its massive jaws opened so wide it was like looking into a black hole. Hot air spewed from its throat as though from a furnace.
Steve knew enough Xandarian to get by, and while he only understood about half of Tony’s response, he got the gist. Tony was vouching for his crew and offering their assistance to Xandar as friends and allies.
The words escaped Tony with more possessiveness than he’d realized he felt. But he did feel it. This
“Did you like when I picked you up and flew you around?” Tony asked slyly. “I bet you’re not used to being carried.”
“Run? My friend, I’ll make sure the Nomad does a lot better than just run,” Tony promised. He helped himself to a plate and filled it from the spread on the table. He had the votes. He knew he was in.
name was. As an adult who’d lived through an extraterrestrial war, he thought… that sounded a lot like an alien name.
He’d docked the Nomad on Stark. He’d done the requisite restocking, maintenance checks, and fueling up the ship had needed. He’d made sure his crew was fed and watered and gave them free rein to go roaming about the city for a few hours. And he’d learned that his soulmate was dead.
Tony’s arm was shaking by now. With Steve’s help, he sat up, leaning over Steve so they were face-to-face again.
He pressed his thumb to his left wrist brace and twisted the clasp of his cloak. The cloak molded to his body, stretching and flowing to cover him like molten silver, until he was wearing what looked like a second skin. Then, from the braces and his artificial heart, what looked to Steve like nano-bots flooded out and wrapped Tony in even more gleaming silver. But what the bots produced wasn’t slim and flexible like the undersuit – Tony now wore a suit of armor, complete with a helmet.
He was impressive. And handsome. And Tony hovered near him and traded quips and seemed more relaxed than he had since he and Steve had been forced out of bed. The night he and Tony had spent together seemed so far away now in comparison to the immediate reality of battle prep and Tony resting his hand on another man’s shoulder.
As the Hydra approached, Steve ran to meet it. No one else was ready— he had to at least buy the Starks and his crew some time—
That’s good enough for Steve. More than. Because when Tony Stark really tries at something, Steve knows, he usually succeeds.
necessary. He’d managed to sell one of his sketches to a young couple passing through the port. They paid him in cash, which he then blew, on a whim, to buy a trinket from one of the vendors who set up shop on the edges of the spaceport, catering to tourists who came through. He picked out a 3D puzzle toy. When solved, it unfolded to several times its original size and revealed an interior made up of a mosaic of panels that depicted famous tales from across Centuri-Six’s history.
The sound of Steve’s voice made every cell within him light up. It was as if Tony had woken up just for this, just for the chance to hear Steve say his name.
The faceplate clicked into place. Its eyes glowed the same fierce blue as Tony’s artificial heart, matching the energy nodes along the armor’s limbs and torso; its interlocking plates were flawlessly crafted, polished to a shine, and – as the first Kree soldier who tried to blast Tony with a photon gun discovered – strong enough to withstand incredible force.
Natasha, leaning against the doorway with her arms crossed, frowned at him. Sam raised a brow and shot him the sort of unimpressed look that told Steve he had at least an inkling of what Steve was thinking.
For takeoff and landing, the crew strapped into crash-safe seats lined up behind the pilot’s chair. This meant Steve, in the Captain’s chair overlooking the rest, got to watch Tony gasp and lean forward, wide-eyed, as they breached the dome and saw all of Xandar spread out before them.
Tony leaned back, propping his elbows on the examining table and spreading his legs as wide as they would go. His cock jutted up obscenely between them.
Tony shook his head slowly. “The Kree have been looking for an excuse to come for Stark, and I just gave it to them.”
But lord. Did he ever have the most kissable throat, the most perfectly touchable jawline – which was clenched in fury as he stormed into the room and got right up into Tony’s face. Those clear azure eyes bored into him.
Steve’s hand slid down the base of Tony’s cock to cup his balls, the tip of his middle finger burrowing between Tony’s cheeks to rub at his hole. Tony had to part his legs wider to accommodate Steve’s large hand, and then his head fell back and bumped against the wall and Steve was licking his nipples and Steve’s muscular back was rippling under Tony’s palms, and Tony had no idea what it was he’d been about to say.
The Stark grinned a little self-consciously. “I wanted to see the stars,” he admitted, “and what seems more appropriate for an adventurer than a ship called the
The man was called Rodos, and he and Tony spoke with the ease of those who knew each other intimately well, finishing each other’s thoughts and shifting effortlessly from topic to topic. Their heads tilted together as they led Steve and his crew through the palace’s winding halls and out front, to where a sizable army was starting to assemble, spilling over the expansive palace grounds and out into the edges of the city beyond. It was nighttime on Stark, and the darkness rendered the hurried preparations ominous and confusing. The lantern light made the grounds look as though they were on fire.
“You might have just saved us from getting killed,” Steve muttered gratefully to Tony, as the crowd dispersed and after a few of the Nova warriors had pointed out several places where a few extra pairs of hands would be useful.
, of all people,” she said. Natasha was the only other member of the crew with a Mark, and she covered hers with a black armband. Steve wore white. White was for a soulmate not found, still being searched for. Black was for a soulmate found and lost.
Steve’s heart rioted against the cage of his chest. His shield slipped out of his grasp, but by the time it hit the ground he was already racing to Iron Man’s side.
The Hydra snapped its jaws at Tony. Tony darted out of the way and blasted it in the face with a repulsor beam. The Hydra shook it off, but gasps of amazement rose up from the Stark soldiers who had seen. Tony pressed his advantage, spiraling around and around the Hydra’s center head, aiming shots at its eyes and into its mouth; the Hydra wobbled in the air, unable to fly and fight and defend itself at the same time, and finally landed on all fours on the ground.
is so powerful, when he and Tony have the weight of so many years and so many fights and so many apologies and so many victories and so much happiness anchoring them together.
If the merchant noticed his abrupt change in tone, he did not comment. “Before dawn this morning. His heart gave out, they say.”
At that moment, Queen Peatra swept into the room again. She was a tall, graceful woman with bubblegum-pink skin; an elaborate dress made of luminous, flowing, pastel-colored cloth in varying hues; orange hair; and swirls of white paint covering every piece of exposed skin, making her look like some otherworldly being. She was also very pregnant.
If they were dating, Steve could reach over and cup Tony’s jaw with his fingers, rub his thumb over his stubble. He could take his hand away and put his mouth there instead. Steve’s chest hurts with want.
Tony wrapped an arm around his waist, and leaned into Steve’s hold. Steve watched his face take in the sight. The rosy glow painted Tony’s skin violet, and his dark eyes glinted with reflected sunlight. His lips curved in a tired smile.
He wasn’t wrong. The capital was a city of clean, pale stone and graceful arches, wide swathes of green spaces and tranquil man-made lakes. As they descended, its details grew clearer and sharper. Public squares boasted mosaic-tiled walls and floors, and the spaceport was bedecked with the Xandarian colors of blue and gold. There was ruin, too. Broken and crumbling buildings created a jagged, unhappy skyline. Panels in the dome that needed reinforcing showed dark against the clear sky, almost like spots of peeling paint in a ceiling. Big tents sheltered those who’d lost their homes and hadn’t been able to find space in newly erected public housing. Memorials for those who hadn’t lived to see the new Xandar could be spotted on nearly every street corner.
Tony tugged at Steve’s hair, wanting more. He lapped at Steve’s plush bottom lip, and Steve opened his mouth, letting Tony deepen the kiss. “Mm,” Tony hummed, as Steve’s tongue slid over his. Steve’s taste made him delirious with want. Their mouths parted with a wet sound and met again; Tony sucked at Steve’s lips, at his tongue, urging Steve to take his mouth in whatever way he wanted. His legs spread even wider and Steve pressed against him, his chest to Tony’s chest, Tony’s thighs draped over his hips, Tony’s cock nudging against Steve’s stomach.
They were all gathered in the kitchen, though no one was eating. Steve was the only one who hadn’t taken a seat at the table for this discussion. He stood, leaning against the wall, arms folded as he considered all the facts.
The “defense system” Tony and Rodos had discussed took out half the Kree battalion, right off the bat. The sky was a riot of fire and smoke as the golden warships were blown to pieces; the palace grounds reverberated with the cheers and battle cries of the Stark soldiers as they watched their enemies decimated.
“I guess he can’t blame me for telling you if you’ve already figured it out yourselves,” she said. “He
Tony knew Steve’s blushes very well by now. He had made a point of becoming an expert in Steve Rogers’ blushes, in fact, and so he knew exactly what this one meant.
Steve sat down on the blanket next to him, perhaps closer than necessary. “You planned all this out?”
Tony’s heartbeat calmed the slightest bit. Steve didn’t know who he was, he hadn’t put those words on his arm as some kind of… bizarre way of confronting Tony about it. But Tony still didn’t understand, and he did not like things he didn’t understand.
. I don’t have noble reasons. I’m just indulging a dream of mine; I just want to be an explorer, like some kid who never grew out of his childish fantasies.” Tony swallowed hard; his jaw clenched. “And I can know all that and still not regret my decision. I would do it all over again. If I wasn’t your soulmate, how could you have any respect for me?”
Tony catches sight of him and his whole face lights up. His eyes crinkle and he smiles his real smile, a little lopsided. The sharp edges of his beard are starting to soften; he needs a trim.
Tony laughed quietly, which the armor translated as a staticky noise. “If you hadn’t been here, I don’t think I could have left. I knew I could count on you.”
“What’s he doing?” she breathed. She meant Tony. As they ascended, they left the Kree ships behind; they were too distracted trying to shoot Tony out of the air to follow. The higher they went, the more Tony looked like an insect doing its best to provoke a pack of lions. He whirled and zipped around the enormous ships, touching down briefly to press
There were no such restrictions on Steve. He could have slept in the lavish room Peatra had opened up for him. The room contained a plush bed with a mountain of pillows, his own bathroom made up of flawless white marble and featuring a shower big enough for five Steves to share, and a massive window that looked out on the city.
Tony fixed him with a highly skeptical look. “If that were true, I would’ve been born knowing how to do it,” he said, and coughed as a puff of cinnamon wafted into his mouth. Steve plucked the jar from his hand. The cookies turned out far too sweet, but Tony smelled like cinnamon for the rest of the evening and smiled very widely when the crew cleared the whole platter in one go. Steve marked it down as a success.
Steve yanked his shield – an old-fashioned silver disc – off his back. Sam steered Bruce into place before them. Bruce sighed, and closed his eyes, and began to transform.
“The best. Oh— fuck,” Tony said. He gave a little bounce, making Steve hiss and an expression of ecstasy cross Tony’s face. “Best oxygen tank ever.”
allies, I know, but….” Tony looked from guilty face to guilty face. “There’s more to your retirement stories than you were telling me, isn’t there,” he said slowly.
Rodos was a commander of some kind; Steve didn’t know how rankings worked in the Stark military. But he barked orders, directed his subordinates into proper formation, and made it clear to all that the armored stranger and his human companions were allies.
Tony came back to scoop Bruce up and ferry him to the ship, Steve at his heels, knocking away anyone who dared set foot in his path. A few soldiers tried to shoot Tony out of the air, but he was quick and clever, and not a single blow landed.
“Sure,” said Steve, agreeably. “Pin you against a wall… throw you out the airlock… all sorts of things I could do.”
They were about halfway through breakfast, Steve with his mostly demolished plate of eggs and bacon, Peter with his bowl of sugary cereal, Bruce with his tea that smelled like bitter grass – which he reserved for mornings – and the others with fruit, toast, yogurt. No one ever seemed to eat the same thing except for dinner, but they still congregated here. He’d read that dining together was a sort of pack-bonding custom for humans, which Tony found charming.
“That was on purpose?” he said. His brow furrowed, as if he couldn’t decide whether he approved or not. Tony reached up and smoothed out the wrinkle with the pad of his thumb, and Steve’s glance at him then was different, softer.
Steve pressed him more firmly into the wall, keeping him pinned; he moved one large hand to Tony’s ass and used the other to turn his jaw so that he could catch Tony’s mouth with his own.
“No, I’m sure,” Tony was saying. “The Nomad needs to land. Whatever the closest planet is, we have to go there.”
bored. He was generous with his smiles and never made Steve feel like he didn’t belong in this place or time.
He put a hand to the back of Steve’s head and squirmed close enough for them to kiss. Then he pulled away, got on hands and knees with his ass up.
They stood so close that, had Tony taken off the helmet, they would have been breathing each other’s air.
The Kree were incredible soldiers, with super-strength that even Steve’s enhanced body could not match. But they could not breathe Centuri-Six’s atmosphere, and had to wear heavy masks that obscured their vision and affected their balance. Their weapons and fighting style were more reliant on brute force than skill; in the face of soldiers like Natasha, Steve, and Sam, this put them at a significant disadvantage, and the Hulk – green and roaring and already trampling anyone unfortunate enough to get in his way – was more than a match for their physical strength. They were blue-skinned, but not in the vibrant way of Tony’s skin tone. Kree skin had a sickly tint that reminded Steve of a bruise.
“You should tell us what you’re hiding now,” Natasha said, all steely-eyed disapproval, “so we know what we’re getting into.”
“Oh, fine!” said Tony, throwing his hands in the air. “I was kind of an important person on Stark. I used lies and deceit to get out of doing my job because I wanted to go planet-hopping. Happy?”
Life on a ship was hard; life in transit, never anchored to anything, was hard. Tony had never complained, but looking around at all Tony had given up – from the material luxuries to the friends who were clearly worried sick about him – Steve could not imagine what his run-down little ship had to offer a man who could have all
Though… Steve certainly didn’t sneak glances at anyone else’s bare chest during mealtimes. Did he think he was being subtle, raking his eyes over Tony’s biceps, dropping his gaze to Tony’s abs as soon as he stood to get a coffee refill? Or did he
Steve tries not to pay attention to the gossip rags, and this is why: it ends with him hovering in the doorway of the common living room, about to make an ass of himself in front of his best friend.
But whatever he had been about to say was interrupted by the rumble that marked the beginning of the Hydra’s roar. A light appeared in the back of its throat, growing brighter— it was about to attack, and this time, Steve would be burned to a crisp—
They were rested enough that Tony perked up at the sight of Steve’s bare ass, his soft cock swinging between his legs. Then there were those broad shoulders, those thick arms and trim waist. And Tony knew exactly how that big blond slice of perfection felt on top of him, drilling him into the bed.
The Nomad met no trouble from the Nova Corps as they neared the capital city, which hovered at the center of the planetary web that Xandar had become. Steve’s ship was designated as a personal vessel, and scanned in any control system – onboard or planetside – as nondescript unarmed civilian transport with license to travel freely within the Federation. JARVIS confirmed they had permission to dock. A gap in the dome let them into Xandar; this opening glowed with a forcefield that maintained the city’s artificial atmosphere, so that the dome could part temporarily without disturbing Xandar’s fragile equilibrium.
Steve said, “You’ll have to abide by the rules of this ship, same as any member of the crew. I don’t give many orders, but when I do, it’s for everyone’s safety and I’ll expect you to fall in line. Understand?”
“That was three,” she informed him, as she let him up. He rolled over with a groan, rubbing at his sore muscles. “Talk to me, Steve.”
He was charming and brilliant and fearless. And Steve… he loved being allowed to come along for the ride, but god, Tony probably thought he was painfully dull. He hated to think that, but it was true. Steve was from another time, another world – one that was small and slow and limited compared to this one. He didn’t have the kind of wit that played well at rowdy bars and his modified body couldn’t actually get drunk. He thought Tony would tire of him, would come up with an excuse to slip away from him and find better company.
“It’s a rat, alright,” came Natasha’s smooth voice from the doorway. She was dragging, by the arm, a Stark with hands cuffed before him. She shoved him into the room so he fell on his knees, where he grinned up at them.
He found himself cursing the lack of teammates surrounding him with whom he could formulate the beginnings of a plan with. There were the real beginning feelings of Team in moments such as this. It was still a mere echo of what he had with the Commandos, but he hoped these bonds would develop further. He missed those connections so much. And combat did so often begat brothers. Family. He did not want to imagine a dame like Janet's expression if he were to call her brother.
Some time later, Steve had no idea how long, Tony’s neck muscles clenched. This was always the way he woke up, his neck and shoulders gaining tension long before the rest of his body caught up. The man’s brain always seemed to be the last thing to come online, a fact that those who knew him found alternately amusing or endearing.
“That… that creature. It wasn’t a creature.” He paused, throat sounding hoarse as he swallowed in an attempt to generate some saliva. “Well, it was. It wasn’t from our Earth. It… It was me. From a parallel universe, I think. I… I killed myself.” his eyes widened as his pupils dilated as shock began to set in, “I..he? I was fleeing. You. There was a you who had joined ‘Medusa’. It sounded like our HYDRA. And was a villain. I had been captured, and was fleeing. Then I somehow arrived here after making a mistake with a teleportation device. ...I was so afraid. I just wanted safety... I thought you were a threat! I was trying to.. to protect me! Get me safe.”
“..What on God’s green earth…?” Steve could feel his eyes widen in shock as he took in the red...thing that had suddenly appeared. He had no words to identify it. There were several long, deep red ...limbs, no, tentacles were thrashing around in the air in moves that somehow articulated absolute fury. The sheer size, let alone number, of them was intimidating, each red, darting limb, seemed thicker than a tree trunk, and several times the length. They positively dwarfed both him and his team-mate, but seemed unhindered by their size.
He forced a grunt past his lips in response to whatever Tony had just said. Not really paying attention to what he was agreeing to - it wouldn’t matter, after all. He wouldn’t be adhering to that agreement.
“That’s right… He did. Well, students before bros, clearly!” The sheer satisfaction that drenched Tony’s voice clearly indicated all the guilt he did not remotely feel.
With a horrific cracking and sucking sound as a pressure seal was broken, Steve nearly fell over backwards as the mask flew off to reveal the grey-faced, soaking wet and blood-stained features of…
Steve used the ice embedded within him to allow a cold curve to his lips, a gesture which no one could ever mistake for something so nice as a smile.
Wormseed’s eyes are light blue, like they’ve been left out in the sun too long and all the color has faded out of them. They lock on Tony’s now and Wormseed says, “You think your sheriff friend—”
Steve doesn’t mean that. He can’t. He—he knows the way to make it stop. That’s why he used the overrides. Why he has them. To stop Tony.
Doom considers him. "I would certainly like to possess it once more, but no, I require nothing in return for my assistance. I'll soon have all that I came here for."
By the time they’ve finished tracing their way across Tony’s back, he’s shaking from the effort of keeping his feet under him and remaining still.
“What?” Tony starts to sit up, turn to look Steve in the face, but Steve’s arm around his shoulders keeps him in place.
“The two fellas you’ve been around town with, one all in green, the other dressed less distinctively in black.”
Nat’s blank face has taken on a cast that Steve can’t quite interpret. “When are you hanging out with him again, just the two of you?”
The bulk of the remaining guests depart in the half-hour after Tony finishes opening his presents, leaving only a handful people more than had been there to set up—Natasha, T’Challa, Jen, and Carol. The energy level has slowed further. Even Jan has mellowed out.
As he approaches its gaping maw, Tony expects the smell of brimstone; what he gets instead is the odor of meat gone rancid and rotten, like half-digested tranklements that’ve been retched out the stomach of a sad old mongrel and left in the sun past high noon. The smell ebbs with each inhale the creature takes through its nose and swells again with every hot, moist exhale.
He sees a mobile shower truck on Van Ness and, without entirely making up his mind to do so, follows its entire route through the Tenderloin and South of Market. Steve’s family was never so poor they lived on the street, but it was a near thing more than once. Maybe he wants to remind himself of that. Maybe he wants to remind himself how far he’s come. Maybe he wants to remember what empathy feels like.
When Tony returns, he’s dressed in a three-piece suit, and he’s not alone. A woman in a crimson dress has her arms around him and her tongue down his throat as he backs into the bedroom, tugging a barrel-chested man along by the hand. Steve smells sweat and whiskey. Several more eager couples follow behind Tony and his partners, in various states of undress. A woman kicks off her four-inch heels and shimmies out of a skin-tight pair of jeans before she notices Steve.
Steve’s naked, flat on his back in one of Tony’s huge minimalist beds, Tony straddling him. He tries not to let any expression show on his face. This isn’t the first time Tony’s said something like that. Steve’s not sure what the point is; is he supposed to believe that?
“It’s exactly like a truth spell,” Steve said. “There’s only one interpretation of everything we say. There’s less wiggle room. You have to tell me everything related to it.”
“Mister Stark!” Lester smiles. “What a surprise to see you ambulatory! If your vision’s blurry, aim for the handsome devil you see in the middle.”
“I usually just get a lot of booze and cheese and Iron Man merch,” Tony continues. “Which is great! I mean, I love those things. And I mean, no one has to get me anything at all! And Jan always knits me something, and Pepper gets me something that’s like, for work, and Rhodey makes these cookies. Oh, do you want one? They’re really good.”
Tony slips a thumb under Steve’s wrist-cuff, and Steve shudders. Tony grins in satisfaction; they’re still soulmates, of course. He’s sure now that they always have been. Certainly, no matter what Steve becomes in the future, he’ll belong to Tony.
More mud greets them on the other side, though this at least is solid enough to stand on. “Yarrow,” Steve says.
Brickenn takes Klithua in his arms, the first time he’s touched her voluntarily. His blood, ruby-red, mingles with hers, bone-white.
He thinks his muscles might vibrate out of his body. Jen’s still talking, and Steve can hear her, but she sounds like she’s speaking over a beehive. “He didn’t want you stuck in a cell. He would’ve done everything he could to get you out.”
They’ve barely spoken since the battle with Thanos. Hell, they’ve barely spoken since Tony stumbled off that spaceship eight years ago. Each time they try, Steve aches with frustration and shame. He’s only made it worse for himself by asking this of Tony. Steve’s hiding this from him. Steve’s using Tony in a way Tony would never want. He knew all this before he asked, and he did anyway, just to have this lewd, tawdry scrap of Tony.
“Would I want to know that the universe I was in had been changed, some part of reality or time or whatever? Yes, of course I’d want to know. Wanna tell me what you’re thinking?”
Steve is getting more out of people-watching—alien-watching, he corrects himself, then corrects himself back to people-watching all over again—than trying to track everything Lieutenant Gonzales is saying. He glances back to meet Tony’s beaming gaze every now and then, when he catches it landing on himself. So Steve is only half-listening until—
Natasha would probably not ever entirely recover from James not recognizing her, nor the times James had shot at her. But she had completely forgiven him—to the extent he was even responsible, which is to say not responsible at all—so she meant to convey to him how much she
Steve’s permitted to attend Tony’s funeral. He’s uncuffed before he delivers his speech. He’s not sure what he says. He meant to plan it, but words wouldn’t cohere in his head, and now he’s at a podium, and he can hear himself speaking, but he isn’t listening. By unspoken agreement the audience pretends that a week ago he didn’t try to kill Tony himself.
An hour later, Worley Honton is dead. He’s in a heap, bleeding slowly into the rug in his hotel room, a hole blown straight through him. It’s charred black round the edges and the skin blushing round that, like a gunshot wound, except that this bullet would’ve had to’ve been the size of a dinnerplate. Steve can see through it to the flowers tufted into the rug beneath.
Tony’s eyes flicker across Steve’s face. “This isn’t the kind of thing you can just decide you want to be better and then it is.”
It’s that moment that the conference call system shows the addition of three new signals. “Don’t wonder about our sex lives, and we won’t wonder about yours,” Spencer says, voice challenging.
Tony’s jostled awake by Steve’s hands on him. He tries to pull away and Steve takes hold of his injured shoulder and twists it until Tony screams.
“I’m sorry,” Tony says, knowing just what it is he doesn’t remember. Whatever’s between them, Tony can’t get what he wants, not really. Other people get to move on, find solace in one another, find a love with currents strong enough to carry them both. Other people don’t have a war between them.
Tony’s going to have to pay his tailor at least triple to get Steve’s new suit done by then. He’s not letting Steve do this in something off-the-rack. That’ll help with the stress, too: Steve in a bespoke three-piece. God, he’s going to be a vision.
Everything goes smoothly at the knife shop Steve had found online. His custom order will be ready just in time for Tony’s birthday party. He makes his way down the crowded sidewalk toward his bike with a smile on his face. Tony may not feel the same way Steve does, but they’re friends. If Tony’s caught on to Steve’s—let’s call it infatuation—he’s been polite enough not to say anything. They hang out nearly every day. And, hopefully, Steve’s found a good birthday present for him.
After some ways, the path straightens, and soon Tony sees a figure standing further ahead. As he approaches, he finds that they're standing in front of a barred gate. Where the iron rods are lodged in, the walls are swollen and red, like infected flesh trying to grow around a bullet.
The cliche is to compare the feeling of your soulmate touching your mark to sex or orgasming. But that’s wrong, Tony thinks, humming in satisfaction. It’s a sensation of satedness—satisfied, languid, post-coital. Instead of urgent and anticipatory, it’s steady and joyful. Tony’s gotten sparks of it in Steve’s presence before, lit ashes spit out by fire. Now the heat is constant, blooming out of that point of contact to the rest of his body.
PASSIVE: If one of Captain America’s teammates is below 10% health or two are below 25%, this power becomes
There’s a strawberry-milkshake-colored tinge flushing Steve’s face and ears. Tony’s heart flutters to see it.
Steve ducked his head. Neither Tony nor the surveillance cameras could see whether his eyes were wet. “I don’t appreciate that at all, Tony.”
Steve looks away from Tony, his face flushing. “He fell down or something at Club A last night, Nat, and then he left. I think he was really hurt,” Steve explains. At the other end of the library, Tony squirms in his seat—looking, truth be told, perfectly fine, if too antsy to be reading quietly in a library—repositioning himself and his book for the umpteenth time.
Tony sighed. “Steve. If this were a truth spell, where we had to tell each other the truth, or exactly what we were thinking, instead of lying—would you be asking me questions?”
“It’s not a quiet book. It can be quite charming, even. And I’m near enough charmed to open it myself.”
Steve realizes he’s frowning. He smooths out his face and starts, “I hope you have a life here that’s as brilliant as you are,” and in the same moment, Tony gets to his feet and says, “I hope you’re happy back in the 40’s.”
“Anyway.” Tony flicks his tongue up to lick away some of the powdered sugar on his face, then takes another cookie and is soon covered in sugar all over again. “Jan always makes people one-of-a-kind Janet Van Dyne fashion pieces, and Rhodey bakes people things, and Pepper’s always giving people practical stuff. I know they love me and they’re thinking about me, and I shouldn’t be disappointed by that, and I’m
Steve wants to yell Tony’s name until he’s hoarse. Instead he holds Tony in his arms, counting each breath he takes.
Tony doesn’t. He socks Grizzly in the jaw through a cloud of flame. When the man falls, Tony crouches down to shield Red Wolf from a hail of bullets.
There’s this move Steve practices with the shield where he holds it in exactly the same place, like it’s stationary, fixed to some invisible point, even as the rest of his body keeps moving. This is what he does now with his eyes as he shifts in the bed and untangles himself from the sheets: they’re locked on Tony, motionless while the rest of him shifts.
Steve’s a fool. He knew Tony would leave him behind someday; he knew there’d come a time when Tony would laugh at him from behind his mask, at his ignorance, at how slow his thoughts move compared to Tony's. After all this, he should’ve realized that’s how it’s always been. That what Steve’s been valuing so highly has been a game to Tony.
“Riddles, then,” the gatekeeper says. He clears his throat—or whatever he has. It sounds like a mechanical bull with a penny stuck in the gears. “Outta the eater came sumthin’ to eat, and outta the strong came sumthin’ sweet.”
“Don’t worry about him,” Tony says, not bothering to look away from the woman in front of him. His snakes his hand down the back of her dress as he kisses down her neck. “He’s just here to watch.” He unhooks the woman’s bra and tosses it aside, then adds, “You can touch him, I guess. And come on him. I like to aim for his pretty face.”
“I still don’t like the call you made,” Steve starts, and Tony feels dread building from a distance, the way he feels, at high altitudes and in freezing weather, phantoms of the ice that doesn't form on his armor. “You and Xavier and Reed and the others. But I understand why you did. It’s not just personal, though. I need to know these things to do my job, and I didn’t.”
Steve watches himself and Stark in the mirror, the picture they make: Stark spilling himself into a puddle, Steve loading himself into the chamber of a gun.
I see. Preliminary scans do indicate that the Timeless Archives have been breached by a network of non-Euclidean dimensions. How can I be of assistance?
“Beautiful” is a term which here means perilously cold, lacking in resources to support human life, inhabited by wildlife with very large teeth, and infiltrated by increasing numbers of enemy agents.
They leave with more than enough evidence to arrest Lukin. It’s not as satisfying as if Steve had gotten to crush Red Skull’s neck with his shield, but it’s more than they had before. And Stark Industries is safe.
There are cheers. People dancing and embracing. Celebratory shots fired into the air. Couples kissing. Folk are already calling Red Wolf “Sheriff.”
“Well, yeah, Tony, that happens when you lead people into a trap and then send a team of combatants after them—”
how Amora treats Tony, and how he acts around her— “but it wasn’t enough. Pepper was taking him back to the tower and I overheard them talking.”
Steve sinks onto his bed and lets a hand fall to stroke his cock. If Tony slid his right hand over Steve’s lips, slipped a finger into his mouth, then another, it might feel like this, he could wrap his lips around them, suck in his cheeks—
Like so many things, this kind of belief is generally only espoused by people who have never been, and never will be, Avengers.
Destroy all Escalation tiles if there are at least 6 Iron Man Escalation Tiles. Generate 2 Red AP, 2 Yellow AP, and 1 Green AP per tile destroyed and 1 Purple AP for every 2 tiles destroyed.
There’s a kid sitting at the other end of the room, watching Steve and Tony bowl. Tony noticed her when they came in, wondering what adult was responsible for her, but then she slid out of his mind.
He can’t stop the sob that escapes him. He can barely regret it, either; Steve liked the sounds he made, before. Maybe it’ll be over quicker this time.
He doesn’t expect Steve to give him a real answer. “So many things.” Steve chuckles. “First, I’m going to fix you. We’ll take care of the rest together.”
if you intended to conceal your interest in him you have failed to do so.  I say that because you work well together as a two-person team. your skills and assets are complementary and together give you the resources to face a wider variety and number of foes than either of you could defeat alone
“Yeah. Okay. I have a place or two,” Tony says, confident and tentative at once. “No one will think to look for us there. Untraceable too, even if we make a few calls to let people know we’re safe.”
Tony checks the park for anyone who might be inconvenienced by what’s about to happen, but the closest people are across the street, enjoying hot drinks from the cafe, stopping outside the thrift store to browse the one-dollar paperbacks, window shopping, congregating in little clumps to chat. “Well,
Steve pulls back the bedcovers and lays down next to Tony. He rolls to his side and slings an arm over Tony’s hips, its weight holding him in place. “Let me know if you need anything,” Steve says, like he’s heading to the kitchen for a glass of water and wants to know if Tony needs a refill of coffee. “I’m right here.”
The dildo gleams bright against the dull navy blue of Steve’s bedspread. He shifts on his feet and the gold twinkles at him, and it’s like—fuck, it’s from Tony’s armor and it’s sparkling like the light in Tony’s eyes, like sunlight glinting off the armor, like a repulsor beam bouncing off vibranium.
“‘And more,’” Steve quotes. “That’s a succinct way of saying ‘sexual assault, defamation, criminal negligence, and obstruction of justice.’”
Next Tony pulls Steve to a smaller room—only a little larger than what Steve thinks of as a generously spacious studio apartment in Williamsburg—with no windows, nor any screens Steve can recognize.
“I thought we weren’t talking about your sex life,” Hardison sighs. “Really Eliot? You? You’re the one to bring the conversation all the way back there?”
He’s roused by the sound of voices and gunfire, echoes of his dream and too-bright memories. He fights consciousness as long as he can. Rogers' voice is the first thing he can make out when he wholly wakes.
The earth shudders a final time, a colossal heave accompanied by a clatter and rumble loud enough to be heard at the mouth of the Mississippi. Mugwort stumbles and Slovenwood falls, catching himself on his elbows and knees.
Steve pulls at his bonds, useless as it is. He should’ve expected this, should be surprised it hasn’t happened sooner. Tony’s been spoiling him, letting him have Tony all to himself, and now he’s going to pay for his presumptions. He tries to shake his head, but Tony’s not looking; the man with him is working Tony’s suit jacket off his shoulders while the woman slips her arms out of the sleeves of her dress and peels the top half down her torso.
Sam lets the matter drop, fortunately. Less fortunately, the topic turns to mind control and mindwipes. Perfect. Just in case Steve forgot why he and Tony weren't friendly before this, why they aren't on the same team, the rest of the meeting will remind him. Tony ducks his head and keeps his eyes fixed on his hands, careful to avoid any chance of eye contact with Steve.
It is a generally acknowledged truth that certain things—like honesty, bouquets, and shared morals—are a good foundation for romantic relationships, while others—like lying, bickering, or one person shooting through the stomach of the other in order to assassinate an Iranian nuclear engineer behind her—are not.
Wade shuddered, and refused to admit that the cake was delicious, and he’d quite enjoyed eating the eyeballs.
Now, if Peter were in his boyfriend’s situation, he’d have come in quietly. He’d have been concerned about making a good impression and been on his utmost best behaviour. Particularly as one of Peter’s parents was the Potions teacher and the other was the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. His boyfriend didn’t take Potions for NEWTs, but he certainly took DADA. And his Pa did have a reputation for being pretty fierce.
But Steve wasn’t that bad. He was eventually persuaded to lie next to Tony. And stroke his hair to soothe him when everything was just
Not that Steve was, you know, looking for him. But it was odd to not see him sitting at the back of the classroom scribbling away fanatically in that ragged old notebook of his. Maybe he was sick?
Steve, relieved that the field was slowly clearing of non-combattants, fully turned his focus to the new life-form, studying its motions as he tried to spot patterns that would enable him to predict what its movements could be.
. He wanted Tony to feel the doubt that Steve himself was feeling. He wanted Tony to doubt his own thought processes, to wonder what was real and what was placed inside his memories. To doubt reality.
Who knew what future days would bring? Steve was now going to need to sleep on the floor in order to maintain he’d fallen unconscious, and had no memory at all of what had occurred. A pain. He really wanted nothing else than to sleep in his comfortable bed.
Steve removed the knife from his holster with a practised hand, and approached the barely conscious man.
“Hey, uh. Rhodey, I mean Rhodes.” Probably not a good idea to go in straight away with the nick name that Steve had overheard Tony use referring to the slightly irritated-looking boy who he only really knew from football practise.
A scream from one of the watching civilians who had clearly refused to follow SHIELD’s directions to vacate the area.
Tony’s eyes fluttered closed on hearing his name spoken for just a second before they flew open again, a hint of the renewed panic there before he instantly calmed upon contact.
Steve’s absentminded gaze slipped to his glove-encased hands and observed detachedly how a light trembling appeared to have overtaken them. His hands were trembling? Was he afraid? Did he fear Tony? Determination filled his gaze as he forced his hands into stillness. No. He would not fear the man who had seized control of his mind, his memories. He refused to. It was time to take control, and force fear on that man instead.
“Dad!” Came Peter’s horrified response as the fire in his cheeks grew even worse. “Just… stop! You’re awful!”
spells to push back the darkening sky, which no one commented on as the other three ‘adults’ sneakily put them out again as fast as the teen could light them.
Tony and Peter did get diverted for a good half an hour as they debated the use of several different potions in increasingly loud volumes as the pair got more and more frustrated in their discussions of what some of the other ‘leading’ potions experts were saying and how wrong it was. That discussion was derailed rather swiftly by DUM-E attempting to jump on Tony’s lap, missing, and instead landing
If he didn’t trust Steve? Then all Steve needed to do was have words with the rest of the Avengers about this war criminal. Then there would be an entirely different set of consequences.
Almost against his will, Tony’s eyes turned towards the man who’d said his name. The…young-ish man with a beer belly and backpack with tentacles hovering around the outside on his back.
Clever man. Gathering all the data he could prior to opening his eyes. Just as Steve had taught him.
Steve brought out Peter’s birthday cake, a mint chocolate chip monstrosity that Bruce had made and Steve had spent hours painstakingly decorating until it was in the shape of an eight-legged giant spider, much to Wade’s horror. Peter, when he saw it, burst into laughter and promptly told his boyfriend the story of how Hagrid had taken him to see the giant spiders when he was about seven years old in the Forbidden Forest. And how displeased his parents had been. But how they’d acclimatised to his love of all arachnids and made a cake in the shape of a spider every year since.
“Get Iron Man, Stark” Steve reached for his identichip to forward the alert to the others with one hand as he placed his coffee on the table beside him.
“Shellhead!” Steve snapped, more in effort to pause the sudden torrent of words rather than in actual anger. “Steady!” and that was the third? Fourth? Time he’d had to say that today. “Steady, Avenger. Take a breath and report.”
Tony oofed as their nearly full grown son flopped straight on top of him, causing the bench beneath them to groan at the added weight. “Petey. Lungs. Ribs. Stomach.
The early evening slowly turned into evening proper as lumos was cast by three wands and lights were lit to push back the encroaching shadows. Food was cooked and consumed and work was put away for the evening at Steve’s insistence.
