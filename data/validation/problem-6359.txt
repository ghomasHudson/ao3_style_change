. He’d known Joe for years, they went to the same elementary school and middle school together after all, and now they’re in the same high school. For years they have been coexisting separately, like two planets with different orbits, destined to never intersect each other but somehow something changed and now they were on a collision course.
JARVIS’ response was lost when the elevator dinged signaling their arrival at the Penthouse. Sam, Bucky, Bruce and Thor were all gathered in the living room, they look distraught and afraid, something Tony never thought he would see on them what with their default attitude of “laughing in the face of death”. Sam seemed to be in the middle of a striding to the kitchen when he stopped and spotted Tony and the boys exiting the elevator.
Tony was a genius. He’s a certifiable genius, graduated MIT at age 17, took over Stark Industries at age 21, revolutionized the weapons industry, perfected the arc reactor technology bla di bla. At age 12, he corrected a published paper that led to the retraction of said paper. Come on, they were using a linear regression when they clearly should have been using a Pearson’s correlation. Never ever use a linear regression. It’s appalling that not everybody knew that.
, turned down a kiss from him. “That so? Well, I suppose I can just flip open the mask with my superstrength to see your sweet face inside that armor, can’t I?”
“Maybe. Or it’s possible that the “X” marks another objective. The only thing left is…” Natasha trailed off, knowing Tony would follow her train of thought.
And so they went to Stockholm in December. Tony got his gold medal while Steve watched on with pride and uncontrollable happiness. He must have grinned the entire time from how sore his cheeks felt later that night. Tony donated the prize money to the New York Public Schools system to advance their STEM programs and made good on his promise to fix Steve’s motorcycle and let Steve pay for date nights once in awhile and to not buy anymore giant stuffed animals for him.
Steve walked forward, pulled Tony to him and kissed the living daylights out of him. Tony gasped in surprise at the sudden kiss into his mouth before yielding sweetly to Steve’s questing mouth. Steve poured all the love and all the desperation he felt to keep Tony by his side into his kisses and into his touches.
After settling Peter in his bedroom, dressing him up in one of his nerdy t-shirts and flannel pajama pants, they went out to the living room. Leaving Jamie in the living room, Joe excused himself for a bit to call Ulysses, updating his big brother on what just happened with Peter and bracing himself for the inevitable fallout and to persuade Ulysses not to panic drive to New York. To say Ulysses tended to overreact would be an understatement. And people said that Omegas were the hysterical ones.
A few moments later, they were all stood before the altar. Bucky and Rhodey, as Ulysses’ godparents stood before the priest, Rhodey holding Ulysses in his arms. The rest of them stood by the pews, witness to the ritual unfolding before them.
Ulysses’ happy squeals and gurgles warmed his heart. He flashed a warm smile at the little boy slowly coming into his own, his features slowly resembling Steve in the post-serum days. He would be the cutest thing ever, Tony mused.
“Let’s just say I went in the front and Alexander slipped in the back. We got it covered.” was all Nick had to offer for an explanation.
“Steve! Steve! Steve!” the man started shouting, “Okay, I know this is hard for you to understand right now,” he held his hand out imploring Steve to calm down, “but we’ve actually been seeing each other. We’ve been seeing each other for awhile now.”
Pierce was silent for a moment, as if contemplating something. It was a while before he finally spoke again, “Everyone serves somebody. Something your-- your mate refuses to accept.”
“I see how it is. I guess we’ve run our course then after eighteen years,” despite his words, Steve was smiling. He placed his arms on either side of Tony and leaned down, his face inches away from Tony’s smiling one. The love between them was palpable.
Tony took a moment to revel in the high that he always got after his hypothesis was proven correct. He did it! Not only did he manage to improve the arc reactor design, he also finally solved one of mankind’s greatest problem: energy scarcity. Nothing was gonna bring him down today.
“At this point, it’s all notches and no more belts,” Tony grinned. Natasha serenely stared at him with her bottomless green eyes.
Steve sighed. He should have known something like this would happen. Tony didn’t seem perturbed when they were all discussing college options, even seemingly encouraging Ulysses to apply to school out of New York so he could explore the world and see what was out there. He should have known that it was all a front, Tony was just starting to realize that one of his sons were leaving soon, becoming an adult that wouldn’t depend on him for every little thing.
because Hawkeye, expert marksman, loves watching brides-to-be search for a dress for their mating ceremony. Thor seemed to be invested in it too, exclaiming in outrage whenever he saw a dress he thought was overpriced or looked unflattering on the bride.
“Did I say head over heels? I meant head over feet. Although technically that would have been the same thing, but--”
Dr. Rosenberg chuckled at their eagerness, “Well then, congrats Dads. You’re going to have another little boy.”
“From now on,” Nick increased his vocal volume to bring the cacophonous arguments to a stop, “none of you will answer questions you weren’t asked! Did I make myself clear enough for you motherfuckers?”
“See, I’m not exactly sure about the poofing part. Because I’m not a good poofer. Would you two care to demonstrate that for me?”
“Steve, I got a nuke coming. It’s gonna blow in less than a minute. And I know just where to put it.” Tony wrenched the nuclear warhead from the missile with great effort, holding it aloft over his head as he flow towards the portal.
“Sure, keep telling yourself that, Steve. We all know I won that last round.” Thor declared jovially, helping himself to a large bottle of gatorade from the fridge.
They worked so beautifully together, all six of them, it was giving Steve flashbacks to his days with the Commandos. If Steve wasn’t busy decapitating these ugly looking lizards, he would have cheered for joy. It was similar, yet on another level it was different. Because back then, he never had the chance to fight alongside the person he loved, Natasha didn’t go out in the field. But today, right now, he and Tony…
Steve came back from breakfast feeling out of sorts. His breakfast was interrupted by some pervert who came up to him talking about rubbing his “engine” and his greasy hands. A diner ain’t no disco. Nobody wanted to get hit on while eating their breakfast. Sure, the guy was handsome and cute, with his soft disheveled brown hair and earnest brown eyes. Steve was not opposed to being hit on every once in awhile. He knew he was attractive, and people liked to look at the muscles. And if the person approaching him was as cute as the guy from the diner, he might be open to talk to him. But really, at a diner when Steve just wanted to to eat his breakfast and re-read a Maya Angelou classic was not the right place. Thankfully the rain stopped midway through the day, and Steve had high hopes for pineapple-picking with his Dad.
So they’re having another boy. Two boys that would further complete their family and their lives. The best of Tony and Steve, now there would be two of them.
“I noticed lately that you’ve been irrationally hating on stuff, Stark.” Clint spoke up. Tony had kinda forgotten he was there, to be honest. Clint was looking at him introspectively, which was odd for him. He usually saved his introspective looks for watching
Bruce chuckled, “It’s an expression, Thor. Tony’s upset that you didn’t extend the lunch invitation to him too.”
As always, comments and kudos are really appreciated. I cherish and adore every single comments I got. Reading them brings a smile to my face every time without fail.
“Sorry, Papa. We got carried away,” Joe apologized. His sharp blue eyes taking in the peculiar fact that Tony was in bed in the middle of the day and not working in the workshop. It was odd to say the least. He exchanged a bewildered look with Peter, clearly his little brother also came to the same conclusion he did.
“Glad to hear it, Pete. And how are you this morning?” he asked Joe, beaming like a lovesick idiot, though Joe suspected he looked much the same right now.
“You seem pretty sure this is the way it played out.” Steve remarked to him. Thor was silent for a moment, weighing whether or not he should tell Steve this new information.
“Steve, join us! We’ve got green beer!” Thor looped his burly arms around his neck, beckoning him to their side of the room where they were drinking green beer and Guinness.
” Joe’s voice filtered in through the darkness. Distantly, he knew Joe wasn’t speaking loudly at all, but his splitting headache made him feel like Joe was using a loudspeaker pointed right in his ears to speak to him. Peter could only whimper pitifully.
“Well, you’d know better than me.” Tony acknowledged, “Yup, she’s gone. Had a good time in Hawai’i and now back to the ole humdrum of the corporate life.”
“Nothing, Papa.” Peter answered quickly, hopefully assuaging his parent’s concern, “just a little bit of headache, no biggie.” he shrugged.
Clint immediately shielding Ulysses with his body and preparing to leave the room; Mjolnir flew in from Thor’s room, smashing through layers of concrete and steel (which means Tony now had to repair the floors. Again.) to land seamlessly in Thor’s hand and startling Ulysses who started crying in Clint’s arms; Natasha pulled out a gun from God knew where and just to make sure she’s completely armed, unsheathed one of the kitchen knives from its place on the counter; Sam and Bruce stiffened up in defense, with Bruce looking unsure and nervous in his place by the stove; Tony was busy trying to calm down and soothe his son with Steve covering his mate and son with his body in a protective stance.
“Stark, it’s been two days and you haven’t left the workshop.” Natasha’s voice pierced through the cacophony of bass and drums that filled Tony’s workshop.
“No.” Tony petulantly wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist. Steve chuckled and Tony felt a large hand ran through his hair and lips pressed to his forehead before he was moved to the side of his bed to continue his slumber. Steve took a look at the alarm clock on his bedside table, noting that it was only 15 minutes to 7. That meant Tony had only been sleeping for a little over one hour from the time he got home. His mate deserved some rest.
“Peter, Peter, focus!” Jamie grabbed him by the shoulders to still the younger boy’s frantic, jerky movement, “Peter, listen to me. Joe said that he liked me?” Jamie asked again, a little timid and hesitant as to what Peter’s answer would be.
“Don’t forget about us, okay Uncle Tony?” Lila peered at him sadly, her brothers at her side. Cooper looked despondent and Nate’s eyes were misty.
“What about-- the anesthetics? You have to tell them, Bruce. You have to--” Tony didn’t want Steve to be pulled under again. Not like what happened after the fall of SHIELD.
The three Alphas shrugged, “You know how it is, Tony. Sometimes you just get caught up in the stakeout or something. I’m sure they’ll radio in soon. ‘Sides they’re supposed to be going in all sneaky and shit, right? Make sense for them to go dark for a bit.” Bucky told him.
“My father used to say “peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy”. Guess that’s how he justified being in this business. He’s keeping the peace by developing bigger and better guns that the other guy. War deterrent, he said. I used to think the lack of war confused him.” Tony said, once again wishing he could go back in time and ask Howard if he really wanted for SI to be the leading weapons manufacturer. What would he think of Tony’s decision to fire Obadiah and devoted SI completely to green energy technologies.
“A man! And a damaged one at that. I’m-- too old and too damaged for you now. You’re still so-- still so handsome and brave and noble as you were seventy years ago. But me...I’m nothing but a former weapons manufacturer complicit in the genocide of many. Why would you want me, Steve?”
“You would kill for me, I know that. But whoever did this knocked him out, then went and got my coat before executing him in cold blood.” Tony explained. Steve was hurriedly rummaging through the desk for a bottle of whiskey he knew Tony kept there. “You would never do that.” Steve got the whiskey, opened it and drank straight from the bottle, “Bucky is different.”
“Never. Your people are lying to me.” Steve let out a long suffering sigh at Sharon's replies, “And until I find out why, you can’t have your tech guys or anybody else I can scoop up.”
“I always wanna kiss you, Tony, regardless of the presence of a baby in your arms.” Steve responded, aware he must be making the dopey lovey dovey face, as Clint coined it, at Tony.
He single handedly revolutionized the face of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Little by little, he’s paving the way for a better life, a better future, using science. Though the press and the media were more prone to broadcast details of his party lifestyle and his exploits as a playboy billionaire, rather than his achievements and contributions to the scientific community.
He had Tony laid down on their bed, his mouth kissing and sucking its way down from Tony’s lips to the juncture where his neck met shoulder, sucking a hickey to mark his mate. Tony’s moans encouraging him to go further down, to where he could make Tony strung out on pleasure. His growing abdomen proof of how strong their bond was, and how suited to each other they were. He felt Tony’s calloused engineer hands caressed his back, moving towards his chest then caressing his abdomen. His mate’s touches felt so good. Steve let out a groan as Tony’s hand started to stroke his cock. It felt so good, the warmth of Tony’s hands, he could feel the knot at the base of his cock started to flare. Steve blindly sought Tony’s mouth, kissing him deeply, taking everything Tony had to offer him. He could feel the pleasure spiking, the heat from Tony’s mouth, the wetness of his entrance, ready for the taking, until suddenly everything stopped.
Tony would be troubled by the fact that his ass has gotten bigger, if not for the fact that Steve liked them so much. Whenever they were alone, he would always be touching or fondling it. Apparently Steve was an ass man. Oh well, as long as Steve liked it. No one’s opinions on his body should matter more than his Alpha’s. Steve didn’t seem to mind that Tony’s body was not the same as it once was, whispering to his ears when they were in bed that it’s proof that Tony has given him the greatest treasure of his life, and that Tony would always be beautiful to him no matter what. And that was enough to make Tony shed a tear, and not give a damn about what anyone else in the world thought.
Clint looked smug as he settled back down to watch his show, the lady on TV finally said yes to a Vera Wang dress. Steve placed the picture on the coffee table next to the sofa and moved closer to Tony.
Joe shrugged in acknowledgement. One of the most prevailing stereotypes of an Omega was how nurturing and maternal they all were. But as Joe witnessed first hand, when provoked an Omega could be even more vicious than an Alpha or Beta. A couple of years back, there was a kidnapping attempt on him and Peter. When the Avengers finally rescued them, it took Uncle Sam, Uncle Clint and Uncle Bucky to hold Babbo back to stop him from repulsoring the shit out of their kidnappers. At least the ones that escaped Papa’s wrath.
“I know! What if you and Tony join us? A double date of sorts. That way, Jane won’t pick a fight with me. Plus, when’s the last time you and Tony go out on a date? He’s been cooped up here since Young Joseph’s birth, I’m sure he would appreciate a night out on the town.”
“So, lemme get this straight,” Rhodey took a swig of his Johnny Walker, “Dude doesn’t remember what happened past a certain day, and everyday you have to get him to fall in love with you again?”
“You lovebirds have fun now!” Tony called out to them. Next to him, Bruce looked at the leaving couple wistfully. Tony was pretty sure there was a sigh going on over there too. Tony ducked back down to the tablet in front of him, opening up the latest schematic of the newest BARF prototype, hiding the small mischievous smile on his face. What a bizarre love triangle…
“Got it in one.” Tony agreed, “it’s just easier on both of us, if we never have to see each other again.”
Tony couldn’t believe how easy being with Steve was. He and Steve have been sitting in this booth at the Hukilau Cafe for god knows how long and they’ve yet to run out of things to talk about. Steve talked about his childhood, being uprooted from Brooklyn to Hawai’i because of his father’s job in the Marine Corps. He talked about at first, how much he hated being here, feeling like an outsider with no friend and no one else to rely on but his parents. But then slowly he made friends. There was the friend he met when he started elementary school, fellow Marine Corp brat, James Buchanan Barnes, who once they passed puberty refused to answer to anything other than “Bucky”. Then as he grew older he gained more friends: Jim Morita, lifelong Hawai’ian; Sam Wilson, whom he met as an undergrad at UH and now as a therapist for the VA, and many more.
“Kid, your parents are crazy.” Rhodey whispered down at his godson, “but don’t worry you have Uncle Rhodey to keep you sane.”
“Come upstairs?” Steve asked him again, “we can get pizza and watch that terrible romance movie about us that got everything, except our name, wrong? You can mock them and throw as much popcorn at the screen as you want.”
“Thank you, DUM-E. You’re taking really good care of Tony when I’m not here. Thanks, buddy.” Steve gently patted DUM-E’s strut as he took in Tony’s sleeping form. Steve stroked his still thick brown hair, now streaked with greys, but it didn’t diminish Tony’s beauty in Steve’s eyes.
Tony has just emerged from a twenty-five hour bender in the workshop, working on the latest update for the StarkPhone, StarkPad and debugging the B.A.R.F code. The rest of the Avengers have long started their daily activities: Bruce should be in his lab with Thor, Natasha and Bucky are out exploring Manhattan in an attempt to get Bucky caught up in the 21st century (although Tony suspects those two are actually going on a date) and Steve would be in his studio or still out running with Sam. Only Clint was still in the Penthouse’s common floor when he arrived, sprawled out on the couch eating a bowl of cereal and watching CBS.
Jamie felt his heartbeat speed up as he listened to Peter expounding the details on Joe’s feelings for him. It wasn’t unrequited after all! Or at least not as unrequited as he thought it was before. There might be a chance for him to ask Joe out, to be close to the only Omega he’d ever fallen for.
“Always know what to say to cheer a man up, don’t you doc? Isn’t bedside manners still required to be a good doctor?”
Steve had long ago resigned himself to be the leader of one of those packs that were obnoxiously large, loud and where everyone in it was involved in everybody’s business. Aside from him, Tony and Ulysses, there was no blood relation, but he would be damned if their relationship wasn’t as thick as blood. The fact that they chose each other as families, as opposed to being born into it, might have played a big role in how they relate to each other. Going through several life-or-death situation might also play a role in forging that bond deeper.  They were always there for each other, they always had each other’s backs.
“Guess so.” Tony grinned mischievously before pulling Steve further in until they’re kissing deeply. Steve felt the warmth of Tony’s mouth against his, eliciting a groan of pleasure from him. He felt Tony moaned sweetly against his lips. Even after all these years it still filled Steve with a sense of awe that this amazing, beautiful omega chose him to be his mate, to be his life partner, to be the bearer of Steve’s children. They parted after awhile and while Tony looked more awake now, there was still that softness from sleep on his face.
“Of course, Steve. How could I not? Another kid for you and the team to spoil, a sibling for Ulysses and a chance for our family to grow bigger. This time, maybe they’d look like me. Also, you promised I get to name this one Citizen Kane
Tony averted his eyes and started looking shifty like Peter did when he tried to keep a duck he found in Central Park as a pet and would have gotten away with it if the duck hadn’t laid eggs in Sam’s underwear drawers.
A visit to one of the loves of his life done, he sought to visit the other one. Steve started to walk towards the staircase sequestered in one corner of the living room leading to Tony’s workshop. Through the glass doors, he saw Tony sitting on his work desk. He didn’t seem to be working, the only thing that the holodeck was projecting was the picture Clint took of the three of them in the living room. Steve entered his passcode and entered the workshop, stepping up behind Tony. Tony didn’t seem to notice his presence, what with the cacophonous sound of his music.
“You guess?” Sue countered, putting her free hand on her hips. Tony thought this was what a mother would look like before scolding their unruly children, not that Tony would know. His mom was never the “scolding their unruly children” type. Or the “paying attention to their children” type. “What did you have for breakfast, honey?”
The older boy seemed to accept this and grinned at Tony. The girl, holding her youngest brother’s hand, looked at Tony as if he was their saving grace.
Ellie gasped and looked around for Brianna, wanting to show her the painting. Lucky for her, at the same time Brianna walked to her, finding her friend in front of the most crowded painting in the lobby.
Tony’s soft breathing gently caressed his cheek as he shifted from his position on top of Steve to tuck his face into Steve’s neck. Steve chuckled softly, careful so as not to wake Tony up, and kissed his forehead affectionately. He could feel the arc reactor’s vibration along his side, a reassuring sign that the device was working, was keeping Tony alive, and below that he could feel the beat of Tony’s heart, slowed down by slumber but still there. Steve settled back down to fall back to sleep once again, it was still dark outside and despite his fondness for morning jogs today he felt like he could stand to spend a few extra hours in bed with Tony. Just because.
“Yeah, I’m fine. Thank you so much, Spiderman,” the lady said, “I was so afraid of what would happen. He had a knife and I left my pepper spray in my other purse. Thank God for you, Spiderman.”
Pepper decided to come visit him a couple of weeks later. She said she was there on SI business, but the bikini, sundresses and wide rimmed fancy hats she packed told a different story. Pepper went to the SI offices in Honolulu for three days and spent the remainder of her two weeks stay at Tony’s mansion, dragging him all over the island. Rhodey arrived a couple of days after her and Tony was so happy to see him, he glommed onto Rhodey, and didn’t let go of his best friend for five minutes straight.
“If you say so.” Natasha finished tying his tie, and Bucky flashed her a charming smile in gratitude that she brushed off with a flick of her fingers. “She wants me.” he said to Steve, as soon as Natasha was out of earshot.
“Because if I show it to Steve, his pretty little blond head would explode. You’re more level-headed than he is.” Natasha admitted.
“Hmm, yeah that’s true.” Tony conceded. Steve was competitive like no one Tony had ever met before and was a surprisingly sore loser when it came to stupid, meaningless competitions like Mario kart or Wii fit. It was amusing to say the least.
“How’s my head looking, Doc?” Tony asked, “Am I gonna have any short term memory problems?” The doctor peered closely at Tony’s face. He took out a penlight and told Tony to follow its movement with his eyes.
“I’m just messing around with DUM-E’s code, trying to make him stop making motor oil smoothies. I almost drank one yesterday before I realized that’s not how Kale was supposed to taste like.”
Sarah would have a better solution, he was sure of that. Sarah would have buckled down, Joe’s not strong enough to see the pain and sadness in his son’s eyes every single day. He’d rather pull a Groundhog Day, keeping Steve well and happy, doing the same thing day after day, unchanging.
“Do you mind, Detective Carter? I’m trying to confer with my clients.” Nick interjected, his tone annoyed. Sharon rolled her eyes, but left them all the same.
“Aah!” Tony shouted, chest heaving as a jolt of electric pleasure coursed through his body. His hands lost its grip on the pillow and he gripped Steve’s biceps as Steve prodded again at his prostate. Tony could feel that rising wave of pleasure within him and knew that he was close to coming. But he wants to feel his mate deep inside of him first before he comes. Tony moved his grip to Steve’s wrist and squeezed signaling his mate to stop his ministration.
Anthony stared up at Steven intently for a moment, “I take it you’re not a big believer in the Olympians then?” he said flippantly, his tone might be light but his gaze was solemn and heavy on Steven’s face.
“Uh-huh.” was all Anthony said, he was looking at Steven disbelievingly. He was silent for a couple moments taking in Steven’s words before speaking again, “Not the craziest thing anybody has ever said to me. If I wasn’t chained to a rock to be fed to an actual sea monster to appease Poseidon, I wouldn’t have believed you.”
“Uh-huh. I believe that when I see it,” Tony quirked his eyebrow up suspiciously, “what’s going on, Steve? Where are they?”
“It was me who shut off the security cameras!” Clint confessed, “I wanted some privacy with my girlfriend, whom I will not name.”
“In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.” Father Vincent continued, making the sign of the cross over Ulysses’ head. “Ulysses Rogers, go in peace. And may the Lord be with you. Amen.”
Tony maintained that the fetus was female, an Omega just knew these things. Plus since before 10 weeks there was no gender assignment yet, he felt it was within his right to decide that the fetus would be female. He and Steve decided to name her Sarah Marie Stark Rogers, after both of their mothers, and made a flower wreath with a metal plaque containing her name and the date she was conceived and the date Tony miscarried. Steve, Tony, Ulysses, Joe and Peter placed the wreath in the river and watched it float alongside the small boat.
There was nobody else in this world like Joe Rogers, Jamie Wilde had always thought so. Granted, he hadn’t met everybody in the world but Jamie’s pretty confident in his assertion of the fact. If anybody could point him in the direction of another Omega that could easily and flawlessly dress down a misogynistic football player, Jamie would eat his football cleats. Joe was the smartest boy in their class, there was no doubt about it. One of the sons of Tony Stark, genius billionaire who built the Iron Man armor from scraps in a cave, there was no way that Joe wasn’t smart. If he was so inclined, Jamie was sure that he could have taught all the science classes at school and probably do a better job at it than their actual teachers.
“Oh, God, Tony, no. Nothing of the sort. It’s most likely a combination of being pregnant at an older age and your pre existing heart condition. Pre-eclampsia is common in geriatric pregnancies. We were lucky we caught it early, Tony, Steve. We can manage it better when we pinpoint the problem sooner.”
“I swear to God, this is the last time, you hear? Getting my tubes tied…” Tony groaned again as he pushed once more. Around them, people were watching, some were blatantly videotaping the whole thing and taking pictures. In the distance he heard the elevator dinged and the rest of his family spilled out of the elevator, looking harried and concerned. Bucky and Clint each had Ulysses and Joe in their arms. Natasha carrying the go bag filled with the labor essentials, Bruce, Thor and Sam bringing up the rear and carrying other essentials.
Stacy pursed her lips, seeming to come to a decision, “Well can I at least contact you when you get out?”
Anthony chuckled, “Steven, you remember what I ask of you after our first kiss? Yes, I very much want to. I want you take me away.” Anthony scooted closer to him, bringing them closer together.
It was the usual bright and sunny Hawai’ian day when Tony met them. He and Happy has just came back from the North Shore, surveying the possible site for arc reactor installation when they got hungry and decided to stop by Rainbow Drive-In on their way back home to Kahala. Ready to get his loco moco plate and Happy’s Mix plate, he noticed the person in front of him in the line was forlornly looking inside his wallet. With him were three kids, two boys and a girl, all wearing confused expression and clutching at styrofoam boxes containing the boxed lunches.
“I will.” Father Vincent then pour holy water on Ulysses’ head, prompting the boy whined and squirmed away from the water on his head, cuddling closer to Rhodey, who made a soothing noise to placate him.
“Congratulations, brother. And good to meet you, Anthony. Welcome to the family.” Natasha, the more calm and placid of the twins, a small smile on her face.
After the fall of SHIELD, the superhero community, which was mostly the Avengers, had needed some good press to bolster its reputation, to make the people feel that the Avengers were there to protect them, have their best interests in mind and that the Avengers were the last line of defense between Earth and any intergalactic threats that has been proven to exist. So the Maria Stark Foundation, on behalf of Tony Stark, commissioned a sculpture piece of all the six original Avengers to be displayed in the lobby of the newly christened Avengers Tower.
So it was completely unexpected when his heart started to beat faster at a glimpse of blonde head, sitting at the same spot as he was yesterday, in the same shirt he wore yesterday and this time in the middle of building what seems to be a house out of his waffles.
Steve quirked his brow, knowing his father was hinting at something else. They walked to the workshop together and the combination of the white walls and the fluorescent white lights Joe installed in the workshop made for one amazing headache.
Bucky still had a hard time wrapping his head around the fact that he now shared a roof with an Alien that had power to control thunder. He never would have imagined this in his wildest dreams. He wondered what the Commando boys would say if they saw how he and Steve were living now.
“Let’s go, please, Happy.” Steve implored as he placed Tony securely in the backseat of the Rolls and getting in.
“Where were you really last night? Who were you with?” Sharon asked again, unclipping her gun holster to store her weapon in the designated drawer.
It was a standoff and they both knew it. Sharon was firm in her beliefs that Tony was lying about his alibi. Based on the circumstantial evidence accumulated so far, it looked very likely that Tony was the murderer. Sharon was a professional and a damn good detective. She didn’t become one of homicide’s rising star without being nice. She did it by being relentless in the pursuit of truth. And if she had to alienate and make enemies with a few people on her way there, that’s no sweat of her back. Stark was lying, and she would discover what that was sooner or later.
Tony looked at his boys, his heart swelling up in size with the love he felt for them. Tony still couldn’t believe he got to have it. A family, a mate who loved him unconditionally, two boys he adored and who adored him in return, and another child on the way. If he went back in time and told his younger self that in the future he would be mated to their childhood hero/crush, Captain America, and bore three children for said Captain, his younger self would laughed himself to death and told him to fuck off.
“You know, everyone that works here is a suspect.” Phil continued, ignoring Loki’s ridiculous Irish accent, “I’m working with a murderer.”
They leaned closer to each other. Finally, finally, Tony thought, I’ve dreamed about this since I was sixteen years old. Steve’s lips were so close to his, soft and delicate, and they leaned closer Tony could feel his warm breath on his face. Just an inch more and he would feel Steve’s kiss on his lips, he remembered how amazing and how loved it made him feel whenever Steve would kiss him and he ached for it. Craved for his kisses. Steve kisses was probably the only thing he needed to stay alive other than the arc reactor.
Steve’s fears were proven unfounded when he saw both Bruce and Maria waiting for them at the front of the bar. Maria was still in her chefs uniform, sitting on one of the bar stools, a frown lodged firmly on her face. Bruce was nervously wringing his hands together, looking uncomfortable and ready to be anywhere but here. Bruce looked relieved when they saw them walked in though, and greeted them hastily.
“Hush, darling. You were scared for my life, your actions are understandable. And Ulysses wasn’t alone, Bucky came for him. Nothing would have happened to him because we have a strong support system.” Tony assured him, leaning back further into him and placing one of Steve’s hand on top of the slight bump of his stomach, “we’re all still here, Steve. We’re still together. And I know how hungry you are, you haven’t eaten anything the entire time you were here. Your muscles must be screaming for food right now.”
“Okay...not what I was expecting, but okay.” Tony rubbed his hands up and down his arms in a soothing gesture, “Why so sudden?”
“The super soldier serum is amazing. On a normal person a wound of this caliber would take at least six months to recover. You did it in less than 3 months, Captain.” the doctor said again.
Tony observed it with minute surprise. Seemed like he and Steve weren’t the only ones with a secret to share.
“Very good, Sir. Someone will contact you in the near future with more information on the itinerary. Once again, congratulations, Sir.” then the line cut off. There was a few moments of silence where Tony just sat there on their bed
“Uh, Thor,” Steve cleared his throat, “I couldn’t help but overhear you on the phone with Jane, uh earlier. Is everything alright?” Steve asked.
Steve nodded, “I understand. I don’t expect you to readily forgive him, Tony, of course not. Just knowing that you’ll give him a chance is enough for now.”
Steve finished adding finishing touches on the mural of the New York City skyline he painted in his Dad’s garage. He stepped back to gaze upon his artwork. It took him six months to complete this mural, not because he was uninspired or have no time. He just kept forgetting that he was supposed to be painting it. At least it didn’t took him four years to complete this painting, like that Lithuanian psychiatrist whose the namesake of Steve’s condition. He was glad to finally complete this piece. He meant it as a farewell gift to his father and Bucky. Steve had decided that he would move out the house and live at the Institute for Traumatic Brain Injury instead. It was high time he did this.
“It’s my Dad’s birthday. Every year we’d go up to the Dole plantation to pick a pineapple for his birthday. Him and Ma used to do it when she was still alive, and I’d like to keep the tradition alive.”
“You do now, Tony. Two months ago your blood pressure was 135 over 80, but now you’re well over 140/90. We checked your blood pressure when you were admitted and earlier this morning. Both showed the same measurements. We checked the protein content in your urine and we found elevated levels of protein being secreted. All signs point to pre-eclampsia. I’m so sorry, Tony.”
“Fine, last one this season. Then you can start pimping yourself out instead of me. Nat tried to talk to me about feelings this morning, and you don’t know how awkward it was until you see a compassionate Nat instead of murderous Nat.”
“I’ve been by your side since I was fourteen years old, Tony. I never complained even when you pulled the most outrageous shit in the history of the world. I deserve to have that baby named after me.”
“I don’t think so,” the TSA agent insisted, “the partial prints came back as his. And this picture more than proves it.” He placed a mug shot of a man that looked almost like Bucky. If he didn’t shave and let his hair grow again like he used to do when he was younger.
“Peter honey, ready for din...ner…” Papa trailed off in the middle of his question. Next to him, Babbo’s mouth hung open, speechless and shocked at what he was seeing.
The baby was still crying, his eyes were closed and he was still covered in mucus, blood and other bodily fluids, but he was still a beautiful sight in Tony and Steve’s eyes. “You’re so beautiful,”
That afternoon, Tony and Steve went to the precinct to get an update on his employees’ interviews and to see whether there was anything he could do to persuade Bucky to open the bar back up. Tony had hoped Steve could appeal to his brother’s sentimentality. Bucky was fond of Sarah, the woman who was as good as a second mother to him. Surely, he wouldn’t let Sarah’s legacy be closed, and turn away profit. Since Steve went to meet up with his brother, that left Tony saddled alone with Sharon. As the only other person-in-charge of their case, he was relegated to her care. And it’s not going well, so far.
Nodding, Steve released his hold of Tony and ushered them towards the master bedroom. He quietly asked Clint if he could please clean up the broken glass and spilled coffee left in Tony’s wake. Clint nodded his assent and Steve thanked him. They passed by Sam on the way, Tony’s face firmly hidden in the crook of Steve’s neck. Sam gave him a concerned, questioning look at the couple but Steve shook his head as a signal to not ask questions.
“I’m probably just too tired from the workshop. Nothing a quick nap can’t fix,” Tony said, his eyes wet with unshed tears and eager to not talk about his episode.
“Who are you?” Steve asks him. Those ice blue eyes that usually gaze at Tony with affection and fondness now stare uncomprehendingly at him.
“You know me so well,” Tony kissed Steve chastely on his lips, “just need to go home and I can implement it.”
As he moved closer, he noticed that Tony was holding something in his hand, a stick of some sort, and seemed to be preoccupied by it. There were two red stripes on the stick, which now that Steve thought about again, looked familiar. Just like the stick Tony showed him two years ago after that night he told Steve he was---
As if answering Steve’s prayers, Widow’s voice on the comm line told him, “I can close it! Can anybody hear me? I can shut the portal down!”
At first, he wanted to go back to the Malibu estate. The California sun would do him good. Plus, he hadn’t been there in forever and he quite missed the cliffside estate with its floor-to-ceiling glass walls that let in natural lights. His workshop in Malibu was also stocked with everything he needed to tinker and invent new techs for SI. After his health scare, he saw how arcane the field of biomedical engineering was and how sub par medical devices that are currently on the market are. Once again the world needed Tony Stark to show them the way. So it looked like he had a new task to revolutionize the field of medical technology. This hiatus from the corporate world would also hopefully give him a chance to work on his magnum opus: the arc reactor technology.
“It’s like you forgot we’re parents,” Tony scoffed, “our vacation time ceases to be the moment they’re born, Steve. We’re going to be at defcon one the moment we step into that hotel.”
“I’m glad,” Steven smiled and brought Anthony’s hand in his hold up to his lips to kiss his knuckles, much to Anthony’s delight, “I only ask because I will do what you wish in a heartbeat, but I need you to know the situation I will be bringing you in if you do come away with me.”
Their dad looked conflicted between accepting charity from a stranger and feeding his children. After a moment, he seemed to decide that pride be damned and feeding his children was more important. “Okay,” he said, “Thanks, man. I promise I’ll pay you back,”
“I love you,” he told Tony, his hands cupping Tony’s neck, with his thumb gently caressing his cheek. Tony’s answering smile and the way he leaned in to Steve’s touch was gratifying in its own way and sent a swell of affection blooming in Steve’s chest.
Hawai’i was not Tony’s first choice for recuperation. After the accident and open heart surgery to fix his heart defect and install a new pacemaker (which he designed himself, thanks very much doubting SI board members), the crisis of conscience and faith that lead to shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of SI, combating the injunction Obie filed against him and gaining back his share of the controlling interests, his well was tapped out. Pepper persuaded him to take a couple of weeks off and relaxed somewhere far away from the hustle and bustle of New York City.
“You have, actually, excellent bone structure, there. I'm kind of having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?” Tony angled for a joke, and it worked. The other soldiers started laughing and chuckling at his joke, “Come on, it's okay, laugh.”
“Whoa, whoa. What? Steve, I don’t want to kick him out. Barnes is more than welcome to stay here. God knows, we have more than enough room. And being alone wouldn’t be the best thing for someone recovering.”
After Phil’s death, Clint decided to stay in Hawai’i because the kids have grown up here and uprooting them after their father’s death would be detrimental to their mental state. He also decided to stay because Phil was interned here at the Punchbowl cemetery, and Clint couldn’t bear to be far away. Clint knew that staying in Hawai’i would be tough for a single parent with 3 kids but was determined to make it. From that lunch, an unlikely friendship formed between the two men. Clint would often leave the kids at the mansion if he worked overtime at the aquarium, and in return Tony would have company in addition to his boys when he was working at the workshop.
” Ulysses chided his little brother, who was still cluelessly waving around a piece of cheese cracker in his hand. “
“Why is it so hard for your mate to see the way the world works?” Pierce directed his question at Tony, who has silently let them continue their acts of Alpha male posturing, while he continued to enjoy his breakfast.
“I have to make a new journal that doesn’t have you in it. But before I do, I would really like for you to read what I wrote about you.” Steve continued.
“I’m sure there are a lot of vegans out there who would disagree with you and tell you all about it condescendingly and loudly. Enough of this moping, come on,” Tony urged him to his feet, “Let’s go to the upstate facility. The three of us can beat the hell out of each other in the forest, just like we did when we first met. Doesn’t that sound like fun to you?”
“Okay,” Steve sat back down again, receiving Aurora from Bruce’s arms and settling the little girl in the crook of his arms and shooting his niece a soft smile, “I can take her, Bruce.”
At midnight, The Wrecking Crew started the show. With the bar sufficiently packed, even more so than during the usual weekday night, the bar floor had turned to a makeshift mosh pit. Thor and Natasha was in the audience, rocking out along with the band and the audience. Thor was headbanging along to the music, screaming out the lyrics to the song and Natasha was standing sedately next to him, hands folded in front of her chest, head nodding along to the beat. Clint was playing air drums behind the bar, much to Maria’s exasperation and Coulson’s amusement. Jarvis was sitting at the bar, staring begrudgingly at the stage, still upset that his spot as DJ was replaced by a live band. Loki was sitting next to him on the bar, eyebrows raised as he realized the lyrics were about drug dealing. Bruce was in the crowd trying to count the amount of beer bottles that have been broken during the show, while Sam Wilson amongst his entourage and proteges held his drink up high.
When Tony looked back around, he saw Sue coming his way with a plate of spam and eggs that smelled amazing. Tony tucked into his breakfast, all thoughts of the Adonis pushed aside temporarily in favor of delicious meal in front of him.
Tony rushed to meet the gurney, wanting to see and talk to Steve. Tony opened his mouth to chide and tease Steve only to stop in his tracks when he saw what was laid up on the gurney. If it wasn’t for the silver star on his chest, Tony wouldn’t have recognized him. It was Steve, he was sure of it, but it was only half of Steve. The left side of his face and his body was covered in blood, red, it was red everywhere. There were no more skin covering his body to speak of.  Steve was suffering from third degree burns on his face, his chest, all the way down to his leg. For lack of a better word, he looked like Harvey Dent after the explosion that turned him into Two-Face.
“So, who’s the godfather for the little squirt?” Sam’s voice broke through his musings. Tony blearily looked up from his position nestled under Steve’s face.
And Thor looked so exuberant and hopeful, so different that how he looked previously that Steve folded like a cheap suit.
“Jimmy, stay with Stark!” the other soldier bellowed to the young man, Jimmy, sitting next to Tony before he got out of the vehicle.
Jane fixed him with a look full of annoyance, “I don’t eat shellfish, Thor. I’m vegan.” she said contemptuously, shutting down his attempts at a conversation.
“Okay, Tony, okay, let’s go to them. Thor, can you please?” Steve gestured at Clint who was still stumbling around drunkenly on the bar counter.
“So Tony, the boys told me that you’re planning to build a second arc reactor on the other islands once the one here is completed?” the doctor asked Tony, interested in finding out more about the progress of Stark Industries’ green energy initiative.
Turning his attention back to his phone to check whether any work emails needed his attention, he settled back on his seat at the counter. For awhile he immersed himself in quarterly reports, the results from the latest arc reactor simulation using the new parameters he specified, an email from Pepper reminding him to sign off on the sale of the Howard’s old storage facility in New York. Then something shiny hit his eyes.
“Well, you took care of me for the last two. Time for a change of pace, don’t you think?” Tony spooned some broth to Steve’s mouth, and his mate obediently opened his mouth to accept the food Tony offered.
“Good.” Steve kissed him again, his lips firm and solid against Tony’s own. He slipped his hands around Tony’s waist and pulled him closer to his body. So close that Tony could feel the hard muscles of his torso and moaned at how good it felt to have his mate touching him again. It had been a hard couple of weeks not having Steve by his side when he went to bed. Finally, everything seemed to be going back to normal now. He got to have his mate back, he got to have his touches, kisses and caresses back.
From Tony’s office, Steve and Tony watched the crowd and their family having fun along with them. They have everyone back together again, back where they belonged. Their little family was happy, safe and complete, for now.
Jane Foster arrived at the Tower two days later. Thor looked happy to see her, and if Tony didn’t see him moping in the living room two days earlier he would be amazed at how amazing Thor’s acting skills were. The man deserved an Oscar. Thor was all smiles and gentlemanly conduct around Jane, acting for all the world like a smitten man.
“Bruce did. He screamed. I can hear him from the kitchen.” Maria answered, looking unimpressed at Bruce’s direction.
This chapter is for everyone who have subscribed, commented, left kudos on this work. Thank you so much, everyone! You're the reason I keep writing even when I have zero work-life balance.
Steve placed his uninjured hand behind Tony’s neck, pulling him closer and prolonging their kiss. “I love you. I love you so much. I wouldn’t be able to do this without you,”
And that was all it took to start them talking about each other's’ lives. Anthony told him everything about his childhood. How his talents for the sciences and his love for engineering and inventing brought him so much joy and how he saw it as a way to finally help his people, to make their lives better. How his father, once considered the brightest minds in the sciences and technology, saw that Anthony’s talents surpassed his and what was once a normal relationship between father and son turned into one filled with jealousy and hatred with Howard resenting his only son for being able to improve his old inventions and fixed Howard’s failed ideas to the point of realization. Anthony also told Steven about how Howard and his closest advisor Obadiah only ever wanted him to focus on weapons, on strengthening the country’s economy by making better weapons to sell to neighboring countries, under the guise of helping keep the peace in the Grecian peninsula. Over the years, Anthony grew weary and disillusioned with his role in the war mongering efforts of his father and advisor. He started to ask his father and Obadiah if he could work on other things for the people, on improving sanitation in the cities, improving the irrigation system for the farmers but they told him to stay in his lane. To keep filling the treasury’s coffers and the noble families’ coffers by making better weapons to sell to their neighbors.
But Steve stood by his decision. You couldn’t build a house on shoddy foundation, and you couldn’t build a relationship based on lies. If Tony couldn’t forgive him after this, then…
“A body was found at your bar.” Detective Carter announced, drawing both Steve and Tony’s attention to her.
“T’ny…” he rasped out, “wha’s goin’ on…” why can’t he talk? His throat hurt like a thousand needles were piercing it at the same time.
They didn’t call Tony “The Futurist” for nothing. Just as he predicted, the dinner was a disaster of epic proportion. None of them looked like they wanted to be here. After the maitre’d sat them down at their table, there was an awkward moment when nobody dared to talk and just silently perused the menu. After ordering their meals, the conversation started to flow with Steve first talking about the event at DSA earlier today, everybody listening attentively and laughing when Steve told them he got asked for umpteenth time as to when he would be running for office. Then Tony and Jane started talking science and Thor and Steve discussing the latest season of Lucifer.
“Okay, I admit I was expecting a bit of a fight and a continuation of our “discussion” about how organized religion was a control system designed to suppress humanities’ ability to be free-thinkers.”
“Hey, there you are,” Steve smiled as he walked to his lover, pressing a gentle kiss to the armor’s forehead. Boy, if Bucky could see him now, kissing a robot all domestic-like.
“Sorry, Steve. We can’t take the boys after all. This one,” she gestured to Bucky still heaving into the toilet bowl, “would need constant supervision.”
“I heard you the first two thousand times, Tony,” Tony stuck his tongue out at him like the mature Omega that he was. Steve was putting on his cologne in the bathroom. He wasn’t sure what kind of place they were going to, but just to be on the safe side he wore a grey henley that might be a tad tight around his pectorals and dark wash jeans. And if he knew that this was Tony’s favorite outfit on him, then that just showed how well Steve knew his mate.
Okay, third time’s the charm. It had to be. That’s what everyone said. But of course nothing in Steve’s life would ever be that easy. Steve must have used up all his luck for surviving the super serum infusion, that was it. Because nobody was this bad at proposing to someone.
Steve cuddled closer to Tony, placing his hand on Tony’s back and pulling his omega closer to him. Tony instinctively nuzzled closer putting his head in the crook of Steve’s neck where their mated scent, intermingled and combined together after years of mating, was strongest.
They walked around for a bit, looking at the different artworks, oohing and aahing at the beautiful artworks. There were paintings and drawings of different New York landscapes. A painting resembling Seurat’s
“Neither one of us was on the floor much last night,” Steve elaborated. Tony kept taking a peek at the dead body in the bathroom stall. Probably trying to see if he recognized the man if he took a longer look at him. Bucky and Sharon kept looking at the both of them. Their eyeballs flicking back and forth from Steve’s to Tony’s.
He stepped inside the mansion with JARVIS greeting him, “Welcome home, Captain Rogers. I trust the mission went well.”
The trip to the garage where Happy was waiting for them was full of panicked shouts and various Avengers rushing around like a chicken with its head cut off. Steve was carrying Tony to the car, with Bruce on their heels carrying their go-bag along with Natasha and Thor. happy was there waiting for them in one of Tony’s Rolls Royce, wringing his hands in nervousness.
But before he could accept the lunches back, Tony piped up, “It’s okay, just put in on my tab. I’ll pay for it.”
“You were great, Shellhead, so great,” Steve complemented, voice low and reverent as he pressed a soft kiss to Tony’s hair.
“Maybe he’s still in the middle of saving the day. Another cat was stuck up a tree or something. Or maybe she found another nice grandma to buy him a churro.” Jamie tried to reassure him. But Joe just had a hunch that it was none of those things.
Eighteen years. Eighteen years of blissful mating with Tony. Even after all these years, some days he still woke up amazed and had to pinch himself to make sure he wasn’t dreaming, wasn’t trapped in the dreamscape he saw all those years ago where he and Tony were bar owners and the rest of the Avengers were their employees. Waking up and seeing Tony’s face next to him, the beloved face that looked so peaceful in sleep, beautiful and so full of life and warmth upon waking, was one of the greatest pleasures of his life. Raising a family and growing old with him was another.
Tony shrugged, though inside he was happy at seeing Steve’s excitement for his work. No one had ever showed as much enthusiasm for his work as Steve did. Rhodey got excited when he would show him new weapons design or specs, but that was probably to do with his job as DoD liaison for Stark Industries. Pepper didn’t really care for the technical details and the codes and algorithms he would write for SI products and the bots didn’t really have expressions to convey their excitement. But Tony had been taking their chirps and whirrings as signs of excitement and happiness whenever he finished an upgrade or a project. So to see someone clearly very excited just by seeing what he had done was not an unwanted boost of confidence.
“You should realize that everything they do to help us is actually making us look guilty in front of the police.” Tony sat down on the bed and started to take off his shirt, facing away from his mate, “especially you.”
“Well I’m an engineer, an inventor and a mechanic. Building and fixing stuff is kinda my thing.” Tony said, giving Steve a very
Thor sighed, big heaving sigh that signaled resignation, “Yes. No. Maybe?” he sighed again, “I’ve never encountered such a problem before. Guess they were wrong when they said ‘absence makes the heart grow fonder’. It only makes the heart grow colder in this case.”
But that was this afternoon. Right now, he was sweating profusely in his bed even after he asked JARVIS to lower the temperature in his room. He felt a fever coming on, his eyes felt heavy, his ears were ringing and everything just felt too much right now. Peter whimpered as he snuggled further down into his bed, sluggishly pulling the covers up over his head in the hopes that everything would feel less intense, less bright, less loud and less smelly if he was surrounded by darkness.
At the reminder that he was still on decaf, Tony grimaced, “Ugh decaf. When can I go back to the real stuff? This is getting unbearable.”
Unbeknownst to them, Steve was listening to their conversation from his perch on top of the stairs. He had been going down after finishing the video and reading his journal intending to apologize to Tony, who was telling the truth when he said they were seeing each other. Seeing the video and reading about all the things he and Tony have done together were very touching and Steve thought he owe Tony an apology for the way he treated his boyfriend after a night spent together.
ugh writing this chapter was like pulling teeth. i have such terrible writers block. but here you go enjoy 5K+ words of utter nonsense
Whatever the man said next was lost on Tony because he woke up. In the morning haze, he couldn’t differentiate whether that was a dream or something that happened to him before. It felt so vivid, he could still hear the man’s deep, soothing baritone. The exact features of his face was lost on Tony, but he still remembered the man’s short stature and his skinny body. Despite that, Tony still felt connected to the man, he could feel his conviction to serve and enlist. To just do what was right. Tony wondered what a man like that would have to do with him. How they came to be walking side by side, enjoying each other’s company. The way he was right now, he wouldn’t even be fit to lick the dirt off the man’s shoes.
“Oh, Steve, don’t be too hard on yourself. I know you love me, I can feel it deep in my bones. Some days, or rather most days, it’s the only thing I’m certain of. I’m in this for the long haul, soldier. A little grouchiness from you isn’t going to deter me.” Tony bumped their foreheads softly together. “If death can’t even keep us apart, I don’t think anything could.”
Natasha couldn’t have children of her own. She was happy for Tony and Steve, but a small-very very small-part of her was jealous of them to be able to have what she could never have. So to see her here, in the midst of their celebration, was humbling for Tony.
Just as he was heading downstairs though, he heard Dr. Erskine asked Tony about his plans with the arc reactors he’s planning to build in Hawaii. Steve knew about Stark Industries’ clean and sustainable energy initiative, he read about it after Tony announced the shut down of the weapons manufacturing division of SI. What he didn’t know was that Tony had basically sidelined the whole project because his whole day was now preoccupied with making Steve fall in love with him. Unknowingly, Steve had ruined his life. Steve had stifled his potential, his ability to change the world, his power to create and change people’s lives for the better because of his condition. He had selfishly kept this amazing and incredible person away from having his most fulfilled life because of his condition.
He slowly began to notice the presence of the other Avengers. His family had driven down to be with them, to offer their support. Ulysses was still in Bucky’s arms. His baby looked like he had been crying-- his face was red, eyes still watery and he was sniffing and hiccuping into Bucky’s shoulder.
“Congratulations, Sir. You have achieved the first recorded controlled thermonuclear fission in modern history.”
“You’re exaggerating,” Jamie smiled indulgently at Peter, “but I do want to ask, Peter, for your permission to date your brother. I-- well, I guess there’s no other word for it, but I love your brother. I know it might sound trite and corny, we’re still in high school, what do we know about love, right? But I know deep down in my heart of hearts that he’s it for me.”
“No?” Tony felt his heart dropped to his stomach though it was anatomically impossible, “that sucks.”
“I don’t know if I can forgive him…” Tony whispered brokenly to Lincoln’s statue, putting into words what he feared the most: the end before the beginning.
Tony chuckled, his voice sounded tremulous in Steve’s ears, “I wanted to kiss you too. I dreamed about you every single night, Steve. I want to be with you so much. And if we had more time, I want to spend the rest of my life loving you, being with you. I don’t ever wanna be without you ever again. I--” static started to break up their conversation, “--love--
“That doesn’t sound ominous at all.” he replied, “I’m assuming it’s something you think I would totally freak out over. That’s why you have a pastrami sandwich from my favorite deli in your hand right now.”
“No, you can’t…” his eyes and facial expression were probably shifty as fuck right now, conveying zero confidence.
“Because he wants me to be proud of him.” Tony smiled and turned to kiss Steve’s cheek, reaching his arm out to rub Steve’s tense shoulders.
Dr. Rosenberg came over to the Tower to check up on Tony. At this point, he already became part of the family after taking care of Tony and delivering the boys. The news of Tony’s third pregnancy came as a surprise to him, but the doctor seemed to be taking it all in stride.
“No, you intimidate them.” the soldier driving the vehicle answered his question. And she was a woman. Kudos to her, being stationed in a battle zone.
“But how is that going to work? I didn’t even remember you asking in the first place, Tony. What’s gonna happen down the line? I’m gonna wake up every morning with a ring on my finger and no memory of what happened?”
“Alexander Pierce likes to say he works for the Grave Digger,” Sharon elaborated, “Makes him look scary.”
Steven chuckled, “Clint wouldn’t mind. He and Natasha are the ones who told me all the sordid stories and tales from Mount Olympus. They think as highly of them as they do a pebble in their boots.”
Tony gladly relinquished breakfast duty to his mate and sat down at the breakfast counter, savoring his only cup of coffee for the day per Steve’s mandate. Steve took out the warmed up puree for Ulysses and started to feed the boy. Seeing Steve being so domestic and tender and loving towards their son never fail to bring a smile to his face. Soon, they would have another child to shower their love and affection to. Tony couldn’t wait.
, was what they actually meant. Tony spent his whole life fighting against the stereotypes of his subgender. He proved them wrong time and time again, by sticking it out as the first Omega to be a Fortune 500 company CEO, revolutionizing SI, making smarter weapons to protect American troops, perfecting the arc reactor technology and being a superhero.
Steve sighed. Unbelievable, both Tony and Clint making his son a mini gambler, “Just promise me you’re not taking him anywhere near Atlantic City or Las Vegas, please.”
So the Winter Soldier was free to do as he pleased. And what he wanted was to understand what had happened to him and determine what he needed to do after that. Once he tied up all of the loose ends, he headed to the one place that he thought would be a safe haven for a wayward assassin like him, the Avengers Tower.
“It just means that you need to remember that old adage about one hand washing the other.” Pierce offered back. The beeping sound coming from Tony’s phone indicated that Nick or Pierce have disconnected their conversation. Tony raised his eyebrow, pocketing his phone back in his pocket.
The boys followed Tony around the house like a newly imprinted baby duckling for a couple of days, skipping school to stay at home and wait on Tony hand and foot. It was cute until they wanted to come to the hospital for Tony’s dilatation which was when Tony put his foot down and sent them to school instead. The boys couldn’t afford to miss anymore classes no matter how smart they think they were and Tony didn’t need an entourage to escort him to the hospital.
“Let the record show that my client is indicating with his head that he does not recognize the man. Just like all my other clients. Next question.” Fury announced to the detectives who looked like they would rather be anywhere else than interviewing Thor. Nick had to admit that Thor made a pretty impressive sight. The sight of the man with his huge arms crossed in front of him, austere face and piercing blue eyes was enough to intimidate even the bravest of men. The bar’s doorman had let his blond hair down from its usual bun, and he looked like a great big lion staring down an antelope who was about to become his lunch.
“Why isn’t he crying? Steve, Steve, why isn’t he crying?” Tony asked frantically. He tried to sit up, but was prevented from doing so by the pain in his abdomen. Steve tried to comfort him making hushing noises and he felt Natasha behind him, propping him up to see better.
Chuckling, Nick went back to the kitchen while muttering “Peanut butter cups,” and looking at Tony funny.
“Hey!” Tony saw Joe and Bucky behind Quill, “what the hell are you guys doing here?” Tony moved towards them, heart beating faster because if they’re here, then wouldn’t he be here too?
He didn’t know how long he’s been sitting in the living room of their suite. After Tony left, Steve felt an onset of what he quickly recognized as shell-shock. He became hyper focused, blocking out everything that wasn’t his thoughts. His vision cleared again and he came to still staring at the half empty plates of food that they ordered for dinner earlier. A glance at the clock showed that it’s been about three hours since Tony walked out and leave and Steve was starting to get worried. Tony might hate him now but there’s nothing he could say or do that could make Steve stop caring about him, nothing that could make Steve stop loving him.
“Should I be upset that our friends think we’re murderers, or just happy that everyone’s trying to help us get away with it?”
“No can do. My identity would have been changed by then. The man you see before would be no more,” Tony interjected, starting to fidget and anxious to leave.
“Yeah…” Tony acknowledged, “I never thought this day would come. But it’s here now and I don’t-- I don’t even know what to do or how to feel.”
“Oh, baby,” Steve reached for him and Bucky knowing what he wanted, handed over his son to him. Ulysses immediately snuggled up against him, tucking his face into the crook of his neck, seeking comfort in his father’s scent. “Hush, now
“Ah, I’m okay. All good now. Joe said I have you to thank for getting back home in one piece. So thanks for that!”
“Coffee…” Clint was bleary eyed and mumbling. Natasha wordlessly held up a steaming mug of coffee for him to grab and drink, or more appropriately, chugged.
Steve tried to open his eyes, but could only successfully open his right eye. His left eye remained stubbornly closed, no matter what he tried. Steve started to panic. The frantic beeping sounds he heard suited his own erratic heart beats. A beautiful voice, a beloved sound, filtered through his chaotic thoughts, soothing him, trying to settle him down.
Tony laughed at his antics, “Yeah they’re extra greasy now. All that spam grease mixed in there with the motor oil.”
Natasha placed her hand on his shoulder, rubbing it in a gesture of comfort. “Your fears are unfounded, Tony. The two of you need to spend some time together, and you will realize that not only does Steve not feel the way you described but that Barnes’ presence here does nothing to diminish his love for you and Ulysses. It increases that love.”
Tony looked to Steve. To be honest, Tony hasn’t thought of a name for this newest baby. They have talked about it, discussing it back and forth, but somehow they couldn’t seem to find a name they both liked. Steve felt like he had no inspiration for a name, which made it hard. But now, sitting on the floor of The Avengers Tower lobby against the marble statue that supported Tony as he gave birth to their son, the name came clearly to him. “Peter.”
It was a good start to another journey for their family and so far, four months in, Tony was going strong. He passed the three month mark safely, so the chances of spontaneous miscarriage has been substantially lowered. There was no irrational hatred of spherical objects like previously, and there was a significant increase in his affinity for corned beef and pastrami sandwiches from Second Avenue Deli, and only from Second Avenue Deli. Sandwiches from any other place would not do.
“What are they doing now?” Tony asked as Bruce wheeled him into the room. Everyone’s head whipped around at the sound of his voice and started throwing out questions at him.
“I’m fine. Some tourist who doesn’t know how to drive cut me off this morning,” Tony nodded, still not entirely convinced Natasha was telling the truth.
Tony had to begrudgingly admit that Steve was right when he said Tony didn’t have time to do anything else but make Steve fall in love with him every single day. After they broke up he realized how much free time he had, now that he didn’t have to go to the Hukilau for breakfast and spend all day and night with Steve trying to win his love’s heart before the day came to a close. Now he had time to work on upgrades Pepper requested for SI gadgets, he managed to review and revise projects coming out of R&D and actually earning his paycheck as CTO. Post breakup, Tony spent 80% of his time in the workshop, only able to be coaxed out of his workshop on the occasion when the Barton spawns visit the mansion to swim or play on the beach.
“Steve, honey, pudding plum, love of my life, what was that?” Tony asked, once Ulysses and Thor were out of earshot, referring to his ‘talk’ with Thor.
Steve walked into the kitchen not long after. When he saw Tony pouring a cup of coffee, he stopped short and fixed him a look. Tony immediately corrected his assumption, “It’s decaf, for God’s sakes. I can have decaf.”
“Secondly,” Aaron interrupted, “Lover boy over there is looking back at you. And I gotta tell you, he is looking fine today. The Black Sabbath shirt totally brings out the blue in his eyes.”
Should he meet Bucky and let him into his house? And would this be at the expense of his mate and child? Over the short one year after the fall of SHIELD and the establishment of the independent Avengers, Steve’s priorities have shifted. No longer did he held on blindly to the past, but he had embraced the future. Bucky, as his sole connection to the past, was no longer the object of his myopic focus in an attempt to stay connected with the past. Not to say that Bucky no longer mattered for him, but these days Bucky’s absence was more tolerable than before. Now, Tony and Ulysses were his number one priority, followed by the Avengers as a close second.
Tony grinned triumphantly. Yes! One more thing he succeeded, one more invention started by Howard that he finished! Suck on that, Dad!
“We will discuss it. Since we are partners.” Tony said, directing his words to Steve who smiled back at him.
“Going to Oscorp gave you a fever? Wow, Peebee you’re such a Stark.” Joe joked, trying to lighten up the mood.
“But I think it’ll be healthy for you, Tones,” Clint interjected, “you haven’t allowed yourself to connect with another human being in a long time.”
Sharon paused in her steps and turned to look closer at Tony Stark. This omega was the one who managed to capture the heart of Steve Rogers, Brooklyn’s favorite son, war hero, recipient of the Medal of Honor and countless other commendations. This heartless Omega who cared more about the profits for his bar than solving the murder of another human being.
“Look, our first job is to find out who killed Rumlow. Finding out who sent him is secondary.” Sharon reiterated to all the parties involved.
“Don’t worry about it, Jarvis. I’ll bail you out.” Steve assured him. From behind him Tony cleared his throat and started massaging his shoulder, “and of course, you too Bruce.” Steve finished, smiling disarmingly.
Steve touched his face gently. Tony’s eyes were closed, his face sporting bruises and wounds from the fight. Yet he looked no less precious and beautiful to Steve laid up on the concrete road. Steve placed his hand on the extinguished arc reactor light, willing Tony to wake up. “Tony. Wake up, sweetheart, please,”
Ulysses slept soundly in his bassinet, swaddled in soft warm cloths. He was so precious, Tony could hardly be blamed for barely glancing up at the newcomers in the room other than to notice Clint’s disaster balloon and the bouquet of daffodils and carnations in Natasha’s hand. Steve seemed to have the same problem too, Tony thought he hasn’t kept his eyes off his son the entire time they’ve been here.
After Ulysses was finally held in Natasha’s arms, busily being cooed at by his uncles and aunt, Steve sat back down at Tony’s bedside, pulling Tony closer to him so he could lean his body on Steve’s. Tony slotted his face in the crook of Steve’s neck, closing his eyes and breathing in the scent of contentment and happiness from his mate.
He keyed in the passcode to Tony’s workshop (it was his birthday, and didn’t that gesture just make Steve want to swoon) and when he stepped in to the shop what he saw stopped him short in his tracks. Tony was in the middle of the workshop, bathed in the blue light of the many holograph projections he was manipulating and he looked impossibly beautiful and ethereal, like something from Steve’s wildest dreams that Steve felt his heart beat faster at the sight of him and in that moment he knew that he would gladly go through everything again, all the hea just for the chance to see Tony like this again.
Steve knew he always wanted to serve. As far as he could remember all he wanted was to be useful for his fellow citizens and for his country. To be able to contribute and chip in for the progress and the betterment of his country. That’s why he was so determined to serve. Not for the glory, not for the fame, but to help. He told Erskine he didn’t like bullies, and while that was true what he wanted to with his newly bestowed abilities was to help people. Be it people in Nineteenth century Europe suffering under the tyranny of the Third Reich, or people in the twenty first century suffering under the clandestine threats of terrorism around the world. So in this new century he served again, this time for SHIELD in Peggy’s honor. After his trip around the country (or as Tony would call it Americana trip) him and Tony were coming together slowly. Misunderstandings resolved, they found that while they contrast each other in some aspects, they have more in common than not. Steve always found himself drawn to strong-willed Omegas, case in point Peggy, and Tony drew him in like a moth to a flame. Tony was like a lighthouse to Steve’s lost ship, leading him back to the shore, like Orpheus leading Eurydice out of the darkness.
“Tony, calm down,” Steve said calmly, always the voice of reason, “I’m sure the boys have a good reason for their actions. Reasons that they’ll be telling us right now.” Steve’s tone implied that if they did anything to the contrary, heads would roll.
So Tony’s morning sickness was gone, Steve was with him every step of the way and his pack was there too. Tony felt invincible. Well as invincible as a pregnant omega could be. He should have known that nothing in his life would be that easy.
Because Jamie had no doubt who was behind that mask. And he was going to confront him tomorrow at school. Peter Rogers had some explaining to do.
Happy Veterans Day to my American readers, and Happy Armistice Day to my European readers. If there are any veterans reading this story, thank you for your service! We really appreciate all of your sacrifice and service to the country :)
As Steve continued his exploration of Tony’s mouth, he trailed his hands down Tony’s body. His hand found Tony’s hard and leaking omega cock and started stroking it. Tony broke their kiss and gasped as he felt Steve’s big warm hands envelop his cock.
“Aww, come on Joe, we’re just being friendly. Plus, Jamie and Aaron here have some really cool suggestions about what we should do for our next Robo deathmatch.”
Pierce continued as if Steve hadn’t interrupted him, “Maybe if you had remembered to reimburse the people who went out of their way to get you that zoning change--”
The family picture on the mantle had been updated several times over. Where before there was only them and Ulysses, now they had five children in the pack to love and fuss over. It was perfect.
“A man matching Sergeant Barnes’ biometrics have been spotted in the lobby of the Tower.” JARVIS announced much to everyone’s surprise.
“YES!!” Tony cheered. From the peanut gallery, the bots were chirping and whirring in excitement taking his cue.
Steve paused from feeding Joe his breakfast of baby biscuits and milk to tune in to his son’s question. “Oh. Why’s that, bud?”
“Please don’t call it a Robo Deathmatch. You make us sound like we’re in a cult and you’ll upset the bots.” Joe said as he sat down in the only available chair in the whole table, next to Jamie and close enough to smell Jamie’s deep, comforting musky scent that sometimes followed Joe to his dreams.
“Platypus, Steve and I-- we have something to discuss with you. About Ulysses.” Tony trailed off, “we were wondering if you would be willing to be Uly’s godfather.”
Balking at the thought of having to share another wet and sticky kiss courtesy of overzealous lip gloss application on Stacy’s part, Tony immediately looked around for an exit strategy. Seeing a guy on a Jet Ski passing by, he immediately jumped at the chance to leave. Literally.
“Well, Steve’s alright, though a little shook up. He’s still watching the tape as we speak.” Dr Erskine announced as he made his way to the living room where the family gathered.
“So how long will they close the bar for?” Tony asked his mate as they dig in to their morning’s breakfast: a bowl of oatmeal with fruits for Steve and scrambled eggs with pancake and bacon for Tony.
They were still at the Avengers facility, because it was still too risky to move and expose Steve to the outside world where pathogens and bacteria were aplenty. So the Avengers moved upstate for the remainder of Steve’s recovery, going to the Tower only to grab the necessities.
” Tony complimented him. His heart feeling like it’s growing in size as he saw how sweet and caring Ulysses was towards his little brother. He glanced down surreptitiously at his still flat stomach, where the boys’ newest sibling was growing at the moment. Tony couldn’t wait to welcome this newest member of their family and how much he was looking forward to see how his boys would react to having a new baby brother or sister.
At Steven’s behest Groot landed them on one of the cliffs overlooking the sea. Steven dismounted and helped Anthony off the horse and safely back onto his feet on the ground. “Stay here, please, for your safety. I shall return.” Steven beckoned Anthony, holding the prince’s hand in his. Anthony’s hands fit perfectly in his, it was callous, so different than how he expected a royalty’s hand would be, more fitting to be a working man’s hand, yet now Steven started to find that he liked the unexpected more than the traditional. After all, he wouldn’t have been able to meet this beautiful creature if it weren’t for Alexander’s ludicrous request to slay the Gorgon’s head.
Two planets would never intersect the same orbit. But when it came to him and Jamie, they just might.
And sitting there on the floor with his mate and his three children, his family cooing at their newest addition, the sounds of people chatting among themselves, taking pictures and videos of them, the siren of the ambulance they called what seemed like years ago approaching the Tower, Steve was complete.
Joe shook his head fondly. One thing he discovered about Jamie was that he was funny and witty. His sense of humor took a bit of getting used to, a self-deprecating and high brow humor that Joe found fascinating.
That’s it? He’d been caught up in a blast before, but it never left him feeling like he just got back to the mortal world after fighting Cerberus down in Tartarus. “And?”
There was a quiet moment in the nursery as the three men sat in silence, regarding each other. Rhodey was still standing by the bassinet, which was now motionless, staring at them and blinking creepily.
“You called me ‘My Love’. Is that what I am to you now?” Steven whispered in Anthony’s ears, intimately caressing Anthony’s ears with the cadence of his voice. Steven felt Anthony shivered minutely in his arms and found himself delighting in that response.
Through it all, father and son stuck close together. Steve didn’t see a reason to move out of his family home, preferring to stay close to his Dad. And with the addition of James (Joe wasn’t gonna call that kid anything but the name his mama gave him, alright) fresh out of the service, still shell-shocked and missing a limb, Joe’s house was full. While they’re not the perfect nuclear family people saw on TV, it’s pretty damn perfect in Joe’s world.
“Hi,” Steve returned his smile then turn his attention to Ulysses who was hiding his face in the crook of Tony’s neck, “Hi, baby boy. Good morning.”
Steve expected it, but hearing it all the same didn’t make it any easier. His hopes and dreams of having his best friend and the love of his life getting along were dashed. This was the price to pay. Steve couldn’t have it both ways.
“When we were there I sorta kinda got bitten by one of the radioactive spiders they were working on in the transgenic facilities and now I have spider-like qualities…” Peter trailed off.
“Hungry?” he asked. Steve gingerly transferred him to Tony. Tony positioned him in his arms, then pulled away the loose button up shirt he was wearing for Ulysses to start feeding. As soon as he got a nipple exposed, Ulysses seemed to instinctively knew what to do and just latched on start sucking. Tony winced a little bit as the force of the suction pinched his nipple. The first suction was always the worst. At least they have slowly graduated from the fiasco of the first day when both Tony and Ulysses couldn’t stop crying because one of them couldn’t latch on and the other didn’t know how to make the baby latch on. It was a nerve wracking experience for everyone involved.
“Son of a bitch!” Jimmy exclaimed. He started to get out of the vehicle too, Tony scrambling to follow him, asking him to give Tony a gun.
“Uh, he might laugh at the dumb jock who thinks that he’s good enough for someone as smart and amazing like him, and then I will have to quit school which will lead to me losing my football scholarship and then I’ll end up living in my parents’ basement for the rest of my life, selling Herbalife supplements and going into massive debt because that will be the only thing I’m good at in life.”
.” Babbo pressed a kiss to his forehead, “tell you what, this weekend we have nothing planned, so why don’t we drive up to Cambridge, surprise Ulysses and spend the whole weekend together, just the five of us?”
“It took me all day yesterday and the rest of the morning today. Didn’t even do my Calc homework ‘cause I was so caught up.” Jamie grinned impishly at him, purple eyes twinkling mischievously.
Time flew by. When Tony blinked again, it was March 17th again, Saint Patrick’s Day and more importantly Ulysses’ first birthday. They had a simple celebration, just for the family, and Ulysses seemed to have fun, if the amount of green frosting that ended up on his face was any indication.
Tony took a sip of his coffee and said, “Well, after this nomination, no matter what happens with his presidency next we’ll feel the effects for years.”
“Well, there you go. Spend some time together, get to know each other again. Ending things seem a bit hasty, don’t you think?” Steve turned towards Tony who was eating his lunch, avoiding Steve trying to make eye contact with him and for once in his life, absent of witty quips, commentaries and things to say. Thanks a lot, Tony.
They found Peter lying in a pool of his own blood. Joe scrambling frantically to his little brother’s side, his blood ran cold and his heart seemed to be beating at a thousand beats per minute with how scared he was for him.
.” Tony chuckled, letting Ulysses gnaw on one of his fingers. With one of his hands preoccupied with being a toy for his son, Tony had to use only one hand to manipulate the blueprint holograph of a new design for Sam’s wings that he had JARVIS project to him. He had been making headway in improving the aerodynamics of them, until something stumped him and he couldn’t figure out how to solve it. Something in the design was bugging him and he couldn’t figure out what it was. Tony swore under his breath, turning the 3D projections in full motion, hoping that maybe seeing it in full would help him.
He showered earlier at the facility, thinking it would be nice to just be ready to fall into bed with Tony. And if they ended up doing things that warranted another round of showering, Steve would be more than happy to take another one with Tony. He got home around midnight, JARVIS greeting him after he parked his bike in the Tower’s underground garage.
Steve, on the other hand, is on a completely different spectrum. Tony’s husband seem to embody the adage “the personal is political”. Once he readjusted to waking up 70 years in the future and have caught up to the current sociopolitical situation of his country, Steve is one of the most outspoken public figures in current time. After coming out as bisexual and being in a relationship, and subsequently marrying a man, it seems as if Steve have a "no holds barred attitude" towards his opinions. He openly proclaims being pro-choice; He endorsed candidates running for the House or Senate, the most recent being a 28 year old Democratic socialist Latina from Queens who is poised to become the youngest person elected to Congress; he openly criticized the Catholic church’s stance on gay rights and their handling of the sex abuse scandals; he would go to rallies urging for stronger gun controls and his biggest achievement to date is to enter a Twitter war with Donald Trump and blocked by the President on Twitter.
Jameson Wilde. Jamie. The heir to Ulysses’ legacy at Midtown High School and the bane of Joe’s existence. Joe was still deciding whether that was a good thing or bad thing.
Later, much later, after they’ve called Dr. Rosenberg and explained the situation, received a prescription of misoprostol and painkillers for Tony, called Happy and asked him if he would be so kind as to send one of his men to pick the boys up from school, they lied in bed together, exhausted after the whole ordeal.
“So what else have you been working on aside the prosthetics?” Steve asked walking them towards a beautiful, vintage 1942 Harley Davidson WLA Liberator that made Tony salivate.
This is a story about two people who found each other despite all of the odds that are stacked against them. And how they stay together through everything, come hail, rain or sunshine.
Tony sobbed harder, moaning and crying. He distantly register the man standing up and leaving their booth. Quill then turned to him in bewilderment, “Dude, what the hell? What’s going on?”
Then she walked to the baby area to play with Ulysses, sitting on the floor with him and quietly stacking blocks with him, murmuring Russian endearments whenever Ulysses did something silly and cute. At first, seeing Nat interacted with Ulysses was bizzare since the spy wasn’t very fond of sharing her inner thoughts and emotions, instead relying on a facade of cold calculation and indifference. But now they knew better. Natasha “love is for children” Romanov adored her nephew and just like everyone else, she would be the first line of defense should anything threatened the little boy.
Steve stopped short at that. Was that what Tony thought all this time? Steve naively thought that they were going to relax, get to spend some time together and hopefully Steve could pop the question and they could renew their vows.
Per Dr. Rosenberg’s order Tony was to remain on bedrest until the bleeding stops, at which point he would need to come to the hospital for dilation and curretage to clean any placenta that might be left behind. They managed to present a calm and collected front in front of Dr. Rosenberg, which they abandoned the moment Steve saw the doctor off at the elevator.
“I’m your councilman. Maybe I can help.” a new voice interrupted them. They turned to see Alexander Pierce, their city councilman and all around crooked politician, approached their diner booth. Alexander Pierce was a career politician and someone who had a firm grasp on what political maneuvers were needed to be successful in the dirty business of politics. Steve thought if he ever saw a more pragmatic and smooth talking man than this one, he would eat his boots. Pierce had helped them get rezoned with the city council so they could offer live entertainments to their patrons. Steve and Tony never actually promised him they’d pay the facilitator’s fee, and they did everything above board. Just at an expedited timeline. Steve refused to pay the man a cent, fearing that it would forever make their business beholden to a politician. And the last thing Steve wanted was to have his family bar become a place for shady business deals.
Bucky, Rhodey, Sam, Clint and Happy completed the picture, with Clint and Sam standing side by side behind Natasha and Bucky and Rhodey, who was wearing his dress blues, in the middle of the picture. Happy stood behind Pepper, a hand on her shoulder.
, because people have been covering up the true circumstances surrounding his parents’ death and that it was a cold blooded murder, not an accident like Tony and the masses have been led to believe.
Steve walked into the bar. It was still early in the night, that the patrons were still few and far in between. He spotted Natasha at her usual station, making notes on the tables and the patrons on the counter. She looked up as he saw him approached and greeted him.
Sharon remained silent, recognizing a bait when she heard one. Tony knew that Sharon was attracted to Steve, and hey, he wouldn’t blame her. Anyone who met Steve would be attracted to him. Steve basically redefined what it meant to be an Alpha. He was kind, courageous, courteous, and respectful of people’s personal boundaries and never used his status as an Alpha male to push people of other subgenders around. He was a natural born leader and all-around good person. When Tony first met him, he fell in love (or more appropriately lust) at first sight with Steve. But after getting to know him better, it was hard not to be enamored by him. Steve treated him as a human being first, an omega second. Tony was always going to fall for him. The only people who wouldn’t be attracted to Steve were people who were deceased or just plain evil.
.” Steve patiently answered his son, stroking his son’s messy brown hair. He had Ulysses occupying his lap and Joe in his arms. When Tony sat next to him his world felt complete.
“This is exactly where I didn’t want this conversation to go.” Fury spoke up, effectively de escalating the situation.
Natasha placidly placed her hands over her plastic cup, obscuring the little orbs of tapioca away from Tony’s view. “Thanks. Now I can eat.” he said jovially, tucking in to the spicy noodle with gusto with Steve standing next to him, speechless at what just happened.
Tony walked to the kitchen to retrieve some dried fruit for Ulysses and himself. He heard voices from the living room, those of Steve’s and Thor’s. Looked like the Asgardian’s back from his lunch date with Jane.
“You know, Babbo, it’s still really early in the relationship. Don’t you think exposing him to the entire family could wait until a couple of months of dating?” Joe tried to plead.
They stood there, facing each other, waiting for the other one to break the standstill and make the first move. FInally, Steve couldn’t take the silence anymore and spoke up, “Tony, I--”
He was lying down on the couch, face up, with a heating pad situated at his lower back groaning in pain from the cramps. The other Avengers were milling around the living room. Apparently it was a slow day, and no one seemed to have an appointment that would take them outside of the Tower. Bruce was somewhere, probably puttering around in his lab. Natasha was reading Page Six on the couch with Tony’s feet propped up on her lap. Clint was sitting on the floor, watching
Anthony was rooted to the spot as he watched the whole battle unfold. It was amazing, it was glorious. He had never seen such a fight before. Steven’s moves were economical, fast-paced and simple, yet each strike of a fist, each blow he landed seemed to exert maximum damage at its intended target. Anthony could see that Cetus was getting overwhelmed by the assault Steven levied upon him. It was only a matter of time before the monster succumbed to its injuries. But before that could happen, Steven decided to end the fight when Cetus misguidedly decided to try and eat Steven again. Anticipating the move, the man grabbed the beast’s broad jaw in both hands, stopping its advances. There was a struggle when the monster tried to escape from Steven’s firm grip of its mouth and Steven managed to kept it in close proximity. Anthony could feel his own pulse thundering in his own ears, anxious and eager to see what happened next, and fervently hoping for Steven’s victory. Steven shifted his hold on the monster, holding it up vertically with each sides of its mouth trapped in Steven’s hands and quick as a lightning strike, tore open the beast from mouth to belly, resulting in its demise.
Steve cornered him in the precinct’s break room, in the process of trying to fuel up on more crappy coffee for the day. Well, caffeine’s caffeine, can’t really complain much. Bucky knew what Steve and Tony were here to ask for. At least, he knew that Tony would be trying his damnedest to get his partner to let him reopen the bar. Bucky’s brother-in-law was as relentless as a dog with a bone, just like Steve. Maybe that’s why they fit together so well.
Tony sighed and stretched in his seat. It had been four days. Four days of Steve lying motionless on the hospital bed, hooked up to machines monitoring his vitals. They had to operate on the Alpha after he was found on the banks of the Potomac, riddled with bullet holes and suffering from contusions and broken bones. Tony guessed the anesthesiologists was unsure of the dosage to use, since Steve’s metabolism will effectively cleared it out. So they had used too much. On the bright side, they managed to extract all the bullets that the HYDRA operative, Winter Soldier, left on him. But on the downside, it leaves Tony playing the waiting game on when the Alpha will wake up.
“Oh God…” Natasha whispered, calling out for a God she didn’t believe in but helpless not to, “Steve…”
“So, did the police tried to convince you I was having an affair with Killian?” Tony asked, taking a sip of his water. Steve scoffed, picking up Tony’s free hand to hold in his, “It’s what they do, y’know? Drive wedges.”
“That was a good way to spend the day,” Tony sighed, resting his head on Steve’s shoulder as they walked around the resort’s courtyard, Tony’s arms wound around Steve’s biceps.
Tony paused at his question, he looked up and down at Steve’s body then steeled himself to answer, “You suffered from third degree burns, Steve. The left side of your body, there’s basically no more skin left. The medical team had to graft new skin to your left side. You’re still healing, baby, that’s why you can’t move your arms and your left eye. We didn’t think you would wake up until after the regeneration process was complete. But of course, you always had to prove us wrong, don’t you?” Tony chuckled and pressed a light kiss to his forehead.
Steve thought he would be ready for when Bucky ever came back to him. But right now, he had no idea what to do or say.
“What?!” Jarvis turned around to face his friend. At the same time, Bruce turned around while holding the gun by the handle, “Oh, oh, oh! I’m English. We don’t use guns. We use our foreheads. What you’ve just picked up is most likely the murder weapon.”
“That’s a damn good question, brother.” Bucky remarked. The two brothers lapsed into silence, poignantly emphasized by the unflinching eye staring contest the two were involved in. Tony decided to defuse the situation by sharing an information of his own. He reached into the pocket of his blazer to take out the napkin Natasha gave to him earlier in the day and placed it on the table for everyone to see.
“Of course I’m winning. It’s like taking candy from a baby. You don’t have to be mean. And if you have to give away my inheritance, please give it to the ACLU,” Ulysses grumbled, “Anyway, what is going on? Why’d you told JARVIS to call me?”
When JARVIS ran the simulation again, the energy output of the reactor simulation was higher than his existing prototypes. What was surprising was as Tony run through the time-course of the reactor simulation while there were still neutron damage and loss of hydrogen mass from the fission reaction, this new scenario lasted longer than five years. And most importantly Tony didn’t blew up the planet by generating an accidental hydrogen bomb. Tony smiled, eyes glittering with pride and the euphoria of discovery. Eureka!
“Yes! Yes, you won’t be disappointed.” Clint cheered and pointed at Tony, then rushed off to get ready for his audition.
Tony exhaled heavily, slumping back in his chair. Steve walked up to him and gently placed his hands on either side of Tony’s face, tilting that beloved face back up at him. Tony looked exhausted, there were dark circles under his eyes that belied the fact that he hadn’t slept in seventy two hours. Steve’s heart clenched at the sight of his beloved clearly suffering and mentally he berated himself for not noticing sooner. Tony placed his own hands on top of Steve’s, gripping them desperately as if he was afraid Steve would leave at the first sign of trouble.
Bucky made a face at the prospect and the presence of decaf coffee. He poured some coffee from the carafe on the right and settled down on the counter to enjoy his coffee. One by one, the Avengers started appearing in the kitchen. First was Dr. Banner. After he made some tea, he started helping Steve with the breakfast, cracking open all two dozen eggs to make scrambled eggs for the whole team. Next came Thor, the God of Thunder. He quickly made a beeline for the pantry, returning with a box of toaster strudel that he popped in the oven despite Bruce’s chastisement that he would ruin his appetite.
“GPS puts you in this building at the time of the murder. Lose the weapon, Detective.” Sharon instructed. There was a tense moment in which nobody moved. Bucky shook his head slightly in disagreement.
The footage was proof positive that Bucky was here in the Tower, just fifty stories below. Why has he come back? Steve wondered. What did he want after a year of no contact, no visuals? Does this mean he remembered everything now?
,” Tony said, making his presence known. Tony started carding his hand through Ulysses’ messy brown mop, the boy was still wearing his tuxedo from last night. It was rumpled to hell, it seemed Ulysses slept in it. His bow tie was missing and the shirt was untucked. He looked so different from the smiling and happy young man who last night was gearing up to take his girlfriend to prom, “
“The usual,” Tony said, “something something good of the company, bla bla bla profits this quarter. Something useless like that. Although I did notice an increase in people questioning my ability to make decisions. Did they think being pregnant somehow affect the way my brain functions?”
“Don’t worry, Peter, your secret’s safe with me.” Jamie solemnly promised him, “the apple doesn’t fall far from the trees, does it?”
Movie night has since become a tradition in their household. Sometimes they gathered and watched a movie, and there were times where they just gathered in the penthouse’s living room and hang out, catching up and joking with each other. That night was one of the nights where they were gathered together, no specific movie in mind that they intended to watch. But then as Bruce was flicking the channel, he stumbled on a channel playing
The Avengers pack was stronger than ever. They saved the world a couple of times over the years, defeating an invading Alien army led by a psychopathic Titan a couple of years back, and over the years, they’ve actually added more people to their pack. Natasha and Bucky finally got off their asses and got their act together. They mated about four years ago in a small ceremony held at Tony’s fifth avenue mansion. The ceremony was interrupted by former KGB agents who held a grudge against Natasha and Bucky from back in the days where they worked for the other side. The buffet table was torched to hell, but at least the wedding cake was safe and that was all they cared about. Thor and Bruce being in a relationship was weird and made sense at the same time. No one other than Bruce could handle Thor’s eccentricities with aplomb, and only Thor would be able to handle Hulk’s tantrum if it ever came down to that. They left for Asgard after Thor kept getting dreams about Ragnarok and the destruction of Asgard, and returned with news that Asgard and the Tesseract was destroyed. Also Bruce was pregnant now.
“I know, Steve. Believe me, I know. I’ve been thinking about this for awhile now. About how we’re going to raise Ulysses. I’m not opposed to you wanting to raise him in the Church, so long as you give him the freedom to choose later on in his life when he finally formed his own set of beliefs. If I want him to be able to make his own decisions, forbidding him from being baptized would be a bit hypocritical, I think.” Tony shrugged, “plus, I think my mother would have liked to see her grandbaby baptized in the Church.”
.” he finished firmly, eyes boring into Sharon knowing what the beta was implying he was doing on the hours when he was alone. There was a tense moment between them, until Steve placed his free hand on Tony’s hands that were clutching his biceps tightly. “Come on. Let’s go, honey.” Steve pulled and maneuvered Tony towards the door. “Thanks, Detectives. Thanks a lot.” He said in parting, directing the last part mainly at Bucky.
“Oh, I must have missed that,” Steve acknowledged, “Well I’ll take you up on that. Maybe we can grab some dinner while we’re at it.”
Omg, guys, I'm so sorry for disappearing for so long. RL has been kicking my ass. In addition to research, I have to teach this quarter as well. But the quarter's almost over, and I have more free time now! Yay! Hopefully I can write more now.
“He’s still alive, Mr. Stark. But we have to get him to the operating room stat.” the emergency med crew told him not unkindly.
Steve dutifully helped Tony to the Avengers tower, flashing uncomfortable silence to the people around him who were looking with wide eyes and disbelief on their faces.
“JARVIS, show us the footage.” Tony said. JARVIS dutifully projected a hologram of the Tower lobby’s footage, showing an unshaven Bucky Barnes standing in the lobby, wearing an old jacket, a baseball cap and combat boots.
“Yeah, I’m happy, Buck. The happiest I’ve ever been. And I know you could be happy too, Buck. You’ve spent so long punishing yourself for what happened, it’s high time you try to forgive yourself.”
“Pardon?” Peter squeaked, only highlighting just how young he was, “I mean, pardon?" Peter purposefully deepened his voice.
“Well, I don’t believe that. I believe this vacation is for us to relax, decompress and spend time together. Mark my words, Tony, one of these nights I am going to romance you, woo you,” Steve whispered in his ears, “make love to you,” he felt Tony shivered in his arms, his breath hitching in Steve’s ears. Steve grinned in satisfaction, “I’ll make you forget about everything except my name.”
“Sounds good, Bubbles.” Peter answered, referencing the Powerpuff Girls nickname the Stark-Rogers boys had for each other.
“Will you two let me do some of the crime solving, please?” Sharon said. With her pen, she reached in to the speaker to hook the gun by the trigger and pulled it out. “Saturday Night Special. Totally disposable.”
Tony nodded, “I heard his name being mentioned on tv and I just froze. God, I can’t believe it’s been 34 years and I still become that stupid, scared 14 year old whenever I hear his name.”
“You know how what I always wanted to do was interior decorating right? I mean, I have a knack for it.” Natasha continued, “And he told me he owned a nightclub and that he wanted to hire me. And I figured he was probably hitting on me. But then James showed up and asked me out for the thousandth time.”
Jamie was looking at him with wide eyes, speechless at Peter’s exclamation. “Wait, Joe is-- he said that? Peter, did he say that?”
At first, they were tense and unsure of what to do with him. Nobody had ever been put in a situation where a recently deprogrammed assassin walked into their house to seek asylum. Then Maria Hill and Nick Fury showed up to extract intelligence from him, and the interrogation was somewhat comforting if only because this was what he expected.
“Of course, darling.” Steve kissed him, sweetly and softly, warmth starting to suffuse him. He and Tony were going to be parents again and Ulysses was going to be a big brother. Their family was growing and nothing could be more perfect.
“Oh, Apollo. The Gods have different names that we use among each other than the ones they are known for to the mortals. A kind of nickname if you will.”
“You’re too close to the project. It happens sometimes, the most obvious solutions become unthinkable when emotions are involved.” Tony grinned, thrilled at having the chance to have a conversation.
“Okay, okay, I get it. I’m not heartless.” Tony cut Steve off, his face blushing faintly. After all these years, he still wasn’t used to getting praises from his Alpha. “And don’t think I didn’t notice that you used logic on me, soldier.” Tony smiled sweetly as he placed his hand to run his caress Steve’s cheeks with his thumb. Steve shamelessly leaned in to his Omega’s touch, eager to feel his comforting touch after a long day.
But perhaps, this tragedy was what he and Tony needed to see just how blessed they already were. Three beautiful boys, the most perfect sons any father could ask for. Steve swore he would do whatever was in his power to make them feel his and Tony’s loves.
“Great!” Tony clapped, then noticing his mistake when he heard a whine from the bassinet. “Oops. Great,” he lowered his voice, “now you’re in charge of making sure he goes to MIT if anything happens to me and Steve.”
“You look so beautiful when you come, Tony. My Tony…” he said, then started moving again. Tony could feel Steve was chasing after his own pleasure now. His hips started rutting against Tony’s, no rhythm, no finesse, just an Alpha chasing after his own pleasure in his Omega’s body. It’s the most primal form of bonding and Tony lost himself in it. In letting himself be used as a vessel to provide pleasure for his Alpha, the way Omegas were created to be. One, two, three thrusts then Steve was coming. Tony felt that hot gush of Alpha seed flood his opening, warming him up from the inside. Steve’s body was taut as he chased his pleasure, then his body seemed tense. Tony knew Steve was going to knot him soon from the burgeoning feeling inside him. Steve grunted at groaned again as his knot swelled up and catch inside of Tony. Tony gasped at feeling of his mate’s knot pushing him to the brim, completing him even more.
It’s been awhile since Steve felt hopelessness. When his Ma passed, he felt hopeless as he realized that he was now alone in the world. Though it didn’t last long with Bucky by his side until he left for the war. He felt hopeless again when he realized there was no other choice but to put the plane in the water. It was his life for the lives of the civilians of New York and that was a sacrifice Steve was prepared to make back then. When he saw Bucky behind the Winter Soldier mask he didn’t feel helpless, only determination. A grim determination to bring his friend back, and in hindsight a longing to take back a piece of his past. Before Bucky, the only thing that tied him to the past was Peggy. With Peggy’s health being the way it was and her lucid days becoming ever rarer as the months pass by, Steve knew he would lose her, and by extension, a connection to the past sooner rather than later. He told himself to the accept that inevitability and that moving on, trying to make the best of the hand he had been dealt with. He had slowly but surely adapted to this new world he was thrust into.
“Whoa, hang on there, cowboy. Let’s see how we do with this one first before we get to a second one. If we don’t mess him up too badly, then we can talk about a second kid.” Tony looked up from his salad in alarm at Steve, but his mate just winked.
Peter made quick work on the mugger, snatching the knife from his hand with his web and pinning the guy to the side wall of the alley and strung him up with his web. “Are you alright, Ma’am?” Peter asked her afterwards.
“Whoa!” Jamie exclaimed, looking at Peter askance and in awe, “okay, you just proved my point. How strong
Bruce nodded in understanding and placed his hand on Tony’s. “He’ll be okay, Tony. The serum will do its job.”
“You, along with two other physicists whose name I cannot disclose at the moment, have been selected as the Nobel Laureates in Physics for 2012. Congratulations, Sir.”
“Steve and I have sex, Barnes. Get over it. Where do you think your nephew comes from, a stork dropped him off on the roof?”
Once the song ended, everyone who was in the audience clapped, with Thor’s whistles being the loudest form of accolade in the room. Tony was clapping, beaming proudly like a father at his son, “That was wonderful!” Steve side eyed his mate, rolling his eyes at Tony’s complete change of heart on Clint’s band, knowing all along this would happen.
But tonight, the river bank was populated with people. The Avengers pack stood on the banks of the Hudson River, all dressed in funeral garb, facing a small viking-style boat carrying a small mason jar filled with the placenta and fetus Tony carried not even 12 weeks ago. The boat also carried in it flowers and unlit tealight candles.
“No, Tones. It’s more than that. I think deep down inside, way way down inside he remembers you,” Rhodey pointed to him, “You. That’s why it’s so easy to fall in love you every single day.”
“I still can’t believe he ever became President. He was never that good of an actor.” Steve shook his head, “You would be sad if I ever say no to you, Tony. You’d be able to get away with more crazy stunts in the field than ever before.”
