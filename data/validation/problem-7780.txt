“Always,” Steve replies.  This time, Tony kisses him.
.  The thought doesn’t feel like his.
“We have missiles still, right?” Tony calls out, trying to calculate on the targets approaching from the front of him.  “Take care of it Fry.”
Steve looks faintly surprised at the question. “I wanted to,” he responds. “Why?”
Clint meets Steve’s eyes across the room, where Steve is settled with a tired Tony on his lap, dozing quietly.
sound wrecked. He couldn't even get that right.  How could he build something right when he’s laying here, on the edge, about to fall off.
Steve, who had been carefully putting away the plate from earlier, looks up, startled.  "Um," he starts and it hangs, awkward like it hasn't been for a while.  Not between them.  "Uh."
He moves towards the wet bar, looking for the scotch and then redirecting once he finds it.  Now isn’t the time.  “But me?  I sit here and try and keep my R&D department from crashing while making the pretty little weapons you guys so nicely request.”
The suit still lays in pieces across the table.  He’s got his glasses on for the finer work, half eye safety, half using the program he has installed to help zoom in and do the finer work on the watch gauntlet.  There is a hologram of the suit lazily rotating across from him, different pieces of the suit, shifting and adapting as FRIDAY runs various stress tests on the MARK 48.
Thirty ninth.
Steve puts down his pad and pencil.  “I’m always hungry,” he admits, like it’s something he’s ashamed of.  “It’s part of the,” he waves at himself. “Whole thing.”
(He looks at Steve like he’s cautiously beginning to trust the other man. Like maybe he isn’t immediately seeing Howard in a different face.
I’m going to die here, he thinks.  “I’ve never liked the easy way.”
She takes a step closer to him, and Michael pulls her back, arm firm against her protests.  “Tony,” she yells. “Tony what is going on?”
“Why tell?” she asks, wicked grin spreading across her face.  “When I can show you?”
Tony blinks at him, dumbfounded.
Mr. Stark,
"I still think you need back up, but if you aren't comfortable, it doesn't have to be me," Steve offers into the silence that hangs.
She stares at him for a moment, eyes heavy because Tony thinks she knows him better than he knows himself.  He still feels at sea sometimes, running from one project to another without any real plan.  Always in a hurry, heart in his throat like he won't be able to balance it.
“Just a small skirmish downtown with the wrecking crew.  You’d think we could get them to just stop.”
"Oh so that's where Thaddy disappeared so quickly to. Also shame on you for breaking up this flow we had going. Well, I think it's safe to say I didn't know since you just informed me, but I would not condone any attack on a nation supporting the Accords. But if they were simply being held at the RAFT awaiting transport, I'm surprised the UN was not willing to share the information with the Avengers at this point in time."
See you there kiddo
The next portal opens in the middle of New York and it’s suddenly a battlefield, and Steve’s thankful he never takes off his suit for long these days.  He has the weapons Shuri made for him, and looks to his right and catches Bucky’s eye with a grin, adrenaline pumping before he remembers that Tony doesn’t have his bracelets on, or a suitcase, so he’s potentially suitless, and Steve needs to cover him.
He looks up to yell at the person who nearly hit him with an armored whale when he sees War Machine hovering as he gazes downwards.  Tony spins, and looks across the ground. Peter is still fighting, somersaulting in the air actually. Natasha and Clint are looking to the right, before someone yells and they both refocus on the fight.
“You always give up a little too easily,” a voice speaks, softly as though it’s something the wind carries with them.
He catches Bruce grabbing the tip of one of the dangling pens and yanking. It gives easily this time.  “Wouldn’t that mean you would be susceptible to gases, liquid or gels that could get through the suit?”
Steve goes on his first weeklong trip while Tony has been occupying his space three months in.  He is quiet during dinner, not keeping up his usual commentary of his day while they eat until Tony finally says, “I’ll be fine you know.”
Shuri stares him down, before Tony gives finally.  “It still happens, but it’s not painful.  Just surprising.  Or at least not what I was dealing with before, when I…,” he pauses.  “It’s not like before.”
“One is in play.”  Tony pulls up the directory called DREXLER  “I need some things working first.”
Tony had had to laugh at that.  A sudden and sharp laughter that rang hollowly between them.  “Be an optimist Lightening Boy,” he had said to Thor’s solemn face.  “Maybe only a quarter really.”
(He thinks it reminds Tony too.)
Steve turns until they are looking at each other across their pillows, in his home that Tony hopes feels as much like one to Steve.
“Honestly?” Tony questions.
Draft reply to 54985-466-8653
Tony would burn the world down.
if he’s honest.  It’s more physical than it was when Steve died, but Tony’s barely holding onto everything in his two hands right now - metaphorical or real.
Now he doesn’t have to.)
Tony leans and falls back a little and then dips until he lands at the back of his original pack he brought to Wakanda plus Wanda.  They pause as he the helmet snap back before walking with them. It’s silent for a moment before Tony says, “So I’m guessing you were talking about me before I landed.”
We completed Phase 1.  Security has dealt with the logistics of the situation, but it has been achieved.
And Steve keeps moving, keeps build until he stills for a second and just sucks. Sucks like he would on a lollipop, takes him all in and sucks and suck and sucks until Tony cannot hold on, cannot stop. He comes, and Steve still sucks, taking in the cum through the cotton, drinking it in until Tony is boneless and slumped in the bed, barely able to keep his eyes open.
The scene turns from the newsroom to the a bustling city.  There are screams, and Wanda is manipulating energy in waves.  She has a barrier around a man, and Tony can see the vest even on the grainy footage.  The young man looks younger than Peter, screams something, and Wanda moves her hands faster, trying to stop him as he presses the button.
"Your house is wired with cameras, of course it's recorded," Natasha replies dryly.  Tony just keeps laughing, a little too high, but no one calls him on it.
One of his greatest sins is that he is selfish.  Tony knows that about himself.
Steve looks relieved.  “Thanks Tony.”
“You realize your first date is going to be insane, right?” Tony replies.  “You’ve got a team of superheroes who are quickly adopting you.”
“It’s a pleasure to meet you Dr. Banner.  I am Mr. Stark’s AI.  Please let me know if there is anything you need,” FRIDAY announces, scottish brogue showing a bit more than usual.
Hand to god, this portion has been around since chapter 3 but never made it in.  If I have some version of it somewhere, it's because I have been staring at this godforsaken memory for YEARS.
Tony is silent, watching the replay of the footage.  “She’s lost some of her control.”  He glances back and sees Vision nod hesitantly in agreement. “The collar from the RAFT must have set her back.”
It looked all too similar to his face when Hulk had roared him back to life.  Frenzied and harried, like he didn’t know where he was, maybe even who he was.  But he was alive, and he wasn't sure if he regretted it or not.
“FRIDAY,” he says.  “Assemble Mark 49.”
A hand cradles his cheek. “I like you to Tony Stark, even if you are impossible to understand sometimes.”
Last chapter is in progress.  I just needed to type up some ragged ends around the lawyers and Steve to set it up.  It all ties together.  May not be a bow, but it’s something.
He turns some tales, exaggerating some points that make Rhodey look ridiculous because this will be retold and create some saga that ends in more stories or a prank war and honestly that is what they all need now as Steve starts on dinner.
So killing a fake Steve won’t even be the worst thing he’s done all year.
"That's better," Steve insists. "Better than knowing and waiting."

Thanos twists his wrist and the green stone, glows and everyone is stilled in an echoing green glow. Tony struggles and is unable to do anything while the gauntlet glows with an unholy light, too bright, and it causes half there figures to dance across his vision.  Thanos’ grin, the first smile they have seen this entire fight, sends a shiver down his spine. Everyone is slowing down and the fight is coming to still, whether it’s because of the gauntlet or in sheer fear of what comes next is negotiable.
Maybe she doesn't have to imagine.  She saw it take 4 times.
Because he’s disappointed her enough in his lifetime, and she doesn’t deserve anymore hurt.
His nightmares ease. His dreams don't.
Tony thinks sadly, softly.
I swear on my soul or something.  Please never again.
There is something in the other man’s eyes.  “You’re always watching out for us, aren’t you?”
Steve stays.
He pushes back memories and continues on, “My father had a man he employed named Edwin Jarvis, which is a much longer story, but he and his wife Ana were the babysitters and honestly raised me for years.  I ate dinner more with them than I did with my parents alone.  You've met my bots, Pepper, Rhodey, Happy.  You know where this is going.”
Steve turns his head and when they meet his, Tony's breath catches for a moment.  He looks so tired and grateful, blue eyes dark with so many things.
“Yeah,” Tony replies.  “How are you holding up?”
But instead he keeps his mouth shut in the moment.  Intent to make the most of this. “How did he and MJ turn out?  Did they wind up having a billion redheaded babies? Because they seem like the sort to have a billion babies and be disgustingly happy.”
There aren’t full reports on her experimentation.  They had gone back and looked, but the paper had gaps, and the electronic reports were wiped.  As they went through more and more Hyrda bases, they hadn’t found any more information on the experimentation on the Maximoffs.  There had been less.
thanks.
One of the three is getting up, so Steve drops the guy in his arms carelessly and slams a knee into guy's jaw.  He collapses, and the other two upright guys look at each other and the one guy moaning about the bullet that his his bulletproof vest.  They grab the guy and start dragging him out.
"How long?" Tony asks.
He goes under the water 72 more times before he is shown the stores his weapons, and says, “Yes.”
“You’re half Italian,” she grins, like this is a secret between them.  “It means you have love and pasta in your blood, and everyone loves pasta.”  She winks and they both laugh until there there are tears in his eyes.
Tony is helpless to do anything but smile at him for a moment before a floating tray nearly bumps into him.  Tony down the rest of the glass before putting it down, even though all it does is wet his suddenly dry mouth.  Steve looks over his way and catches his eye.
Tony begins to ramble, updating on the treadmill situation he has been tinkering with, because this is what happens when he doesn't sleep and doesn't have Steve around to bully him into keeping normal hours
Natasha watches as he moves back to the chair, a half slide he gracefully incorporates into his movements when Tony has been drinking for a while. She tightens her grip on the cushion of the chair, and thinks about the briefings she has been a part of. The Soviet Union of her childhood, with the fear rank in the air and the hunted look in everyone’s eyes.
Under the suit, Tony huffs a laugh.  Instead he just says, “Really? That’s what you are going with?”
Tony rolls his eyes.  “Oh my god, you are the worst Aunt Peg,” he utters before taking a gulp.  “Absolute worst.”
Steve isn't back for weeks.
“You know,” Peggy pauses.  “She always -”
“Your eminence,” the no nosed creature utters and bows to Thanos.  “How may we serve you?”
Still Tony looks across the battlefield and meets Steve’s eyes.  He smiles softly, and something drops in Steve’s face.  He turns back to his fight and pushes harder faster until he takes down the Chitauri overrunning him and starts running towards him.
“How can you lose me?” Tony scoffs, incredulous as he waves his arm.  The blood splatters around him. “When I never really was here? Because me?  I’m not the Tony Stark from 2009. I’m not. I’m half of him. Maybe even less than that.”
Spock is green eyed and female and has a looseness in her gestures Tony never saw in the Quinto version but something Nimoy deployed in those same movies.  She puts her hand up in the Vulcan salute. Kirk puts their hand up against the wall as well. “Live long and prosper Spock,” they say in a raspy low voice.
He brushes past Steve, out of the kitchen, and almost heads down the lab, but he knows a version of his shaking, and knows it’s a bad idea. JARVIS has probably already initiated a 24 hour lockdown protocol based on his erratic heart rate. He goes to his room, palm print to get in and locks it all down before sitting down on the bed.
Tony is completely at ease with the situation, and that’s when Steve realizes he hasn’t seen Tony without his gloves or a long sleeve shirt or jacket since he arrived in New York.
It takes a moment before Thanos stands, and roars, “Where is it?”  He swings his gaze across the stilled battlefield, eyes bouncing from each person.  “Where have you hidden the rest of the Time Gem?”
From 54985-466-8653
The murmurs grow louder at that, and Tony can see more than a few smirks in the crowd. Ulrich has a wince across his face, so Tony's on the mark there. "So really, Ben Ulrich of the Daily Bugle, what are you dying to ask me?"
"I will let you know if Colonel Rhodes needs your help boss," FRIDAY responds, patience clear in her tone. "I have also begun the process of opening the Tower apartments back up to the usual personnel."
Bruce finds him, hours later, tinkering in the lab.  Not the one they used to share, but the other one that Tony claimed as his own when he had moved back in a few days ago.  The bots whistle when he enters, but Tony ignores it.  He finishes soldering the circuit, movements delicate as he connects the microprocessor to the miniature ARC sphere.  It’s smaller than a ring now, and Tony can’t help but smile at the fact that he got it
“Her neck snapped from the recoil, of course it’s my fault,” Peter bites out.  He’s grief stricken in such a familiar way that Tony can barely breathe.  “She looked at me like I was going to save her and I killed her.  Someday I’m going to do that again, and you won’t be able to look me in the eyes when it happens, and I’ll have to get used to being back on my own again."
“I’m not,” he insists and waits for a moment, letting the words sink in. “This is the only place,” he admits, words sounding and feeling too small, but it’s all he can get out. “This is the only place I feel like I can be me. Steve. Not Captain America, Cap or an Avenger. Just Steve.”
, he thinks.
I don’t think I ever really knew you well enough to miss you when you left
No one says anything for a long time.  All of it hangs between them as they realize just how badly this could have gone.  Just how close they were to be held down an experimented on.  Natasha fists her hands to hide how bad she is shaking.  All she can hear is the squeaking wheel of the gurney during her graduation ceremony.
Tony is four, and he has all these ideas in his head, and he can’t sketch them out.  It’s like his brain and his hand can’t communicate, and it just makes him so mad.  When he tries to explain what he is doing, he doesn’t know all the words.  He pauses and when his Dad, Mom or even Jarvis try to help fill in the gaps, they are always wrong.
Talking helps. It lets the words he stuffs down come easier, slip past the block in his throat until that goes away too.
He’s everywhere, every when, and it’s seared into his brain, into this being - everything and nothing.  It’s eating him alive and keeping him standing,
Tony does.
"No," Tony replies. "No. It's not that. If it was that…" Tony needs a drink or five. He scans the room for Scotch and sees none. "If I was worried you were a threat, you would never be around Rhodey."
Tony turns back to the program on the screen. "Okay J. Have we gotten the security parameters beyond the initial, 'oh shit don't let anyone die so Fury can't kill me' level we talked about?"
She works for hours.
“Okay,” he mutters when he comes into the kitchen to the waiting Vision, Rhodey, and Bruce.
Spiderman barrels through the open window in the lab while Tony and Bruce are pouring over the nanotech prototype hologram.  He rolls to a stop in front of them on and stares, both of his lenses wide.  Bruce lets the pen in his hand drop onto the table with a dull thud.  Tony takes in the scene with a small smile on his lips.
They sit there for a long moment, quiet as Tony tries to calm his too quick breathing.  Steve lets him head his head against his shoulder, quietly saying things Tony can’t parse out over the rushing in his ears as he counts 4 breaths in, 4 to hold, and 4 out.
You should have told me years ago.
Bruce’s hand rests on his back as they shake and laugh for a good five minutes, until it almost turns into a chokes sob that Tony bites back last minute.  He pulls back when he can breathe normally and the ache in his stomach isn’t debilitating any more.
Tony chuckles, nodding.  "I'm pretty good at talking my way into trouble.  Always have been."
A week later, he tries again with the 3D printing.
Tony nods. "JARVIS, allow Cap access to all items under level Justice League security level."
Later - if there is a later, he’s going to ask.
“Tony,” Tony says, even though it won’t matter.  Steve will forget him.
"Either is falling in love with a partner who has their eye on someone else," Steve snaps.
Steve nods before straightening.  “Good night Tony.”
Tony waves around the tower, “I literally have labs all over New York you can pop in and call for Friday to come do the hard work for you.  It is absolutely not useful to learn it by hand and you’ll ruin your eyesight.”
“I don’t,” Steve stumbles, trying to pull his thoughts together. He’s not taking the bait, not now, not here. “I’m not.”
He sighs.  “That is on me.  It will always be on me.  I just wanted to make sure no one else had to live with that.”
He shuts the parts closed and reveals a small car.  He places it down on the table. “Start her up J.”
we needed rules so we could color inside the line instead of outside of it. we needed to figure this shit out so it wouldn't be enforced on us and I tried
She lets him turn the topic back to the next meeting with the board and the impending regulation on the horizon.  Tony focuses on that and not the tracker blinking out of the corner of his eye, showing Steve in the kitchen.  Doesn't touch the keyboard to pull up the video.
You owe them nothing.
When he looks at her, she is evaluating him. "Can I take this?" She queries, hand hovering over the painting.
He captures Tony’s lips again, and they don’t speak in coherent sentences for quite a few more hours.
And fall,
“Tony?” he asks, staring at the mess.
"Stay," Tony says and Steve looks back to him. Tony is looking at the painting on the easel. It's of Clint looking to Natasha, eating popcorn with her tablet in hand. It's the closest Steve has gotten to thinking too much about that moment. Out of everything he thinks about, that discussion with Clint is something he has locked down.
"Not you Viz," Tony responds, as sincere as he gets. "All me."
Nat probably knew too." Tony spits out.
I want to tell you I’m sorry to your face.  One day maybe I will be able to but until then.  I’m sorry Tony.  I should have talked to you. I should have trusted you.  I should have been your teammate.
FRIDAY is still talking in his ear, but Tony feels fuzzy, tired down to his bones, and he just drifts away - dreaming.
.  “Just giving some encouragement and cleaning up other people’s mess.  It’s my job.”
It takes a few steps, and Tony’s feet drag against the snow, before they don’t, and he knows he’s dangling over something.  He sees a crevice in the ice out of the corner of his eyes, and before he can even comprehend what that means, the Skrull shakes him a bit.  He pulls at the grip around his throat. It’s like iron and everything in Tony is screaming right now. It feels like broken fingers that throb as he pulls fruitlessly.
Tony breathes through his nose quickly.  “Okay first off, I was hooked up to a car battery and I needed to move around. Also, prisoner in the middle of Afghanistan, so I kind of had to work with I had, which was palladium.  AND, once I got out, I worked on fixing the issue.”
Tony nods and goes back to his work. Steve looks at his painting and decides that is enough for the day. He cleans up, puts things away and grabs his sketchbook before Tony cuts in with, "You don't have to leave every time I come in."
(He goes down after the call ends though.  Steve greets him with his steady sort of joy, familiar, like a well worn path in a forest.
Tony would laugh if he wasn't insulted that Steve had to ask.  "You think I don't own them already?  Really?  I thought you knew me, Steve."
His memory.  It hits Tony really hard in that moment.  He won’t ever see Jarvis again, or Carol, or even Peter.  It’s just him now. Him and Steve.
Later - Tony watches the Peter video more often than he would like to admit to.  It’s a reminder of his mistakes, he tells himself, FRIDAY, Rhodes.  He has to be aware to keep himself from slipping.
, Steve wants to say, but he doesn't get that right. Not here. Not now.
“I did,” Steve states, eyes firm.  “Tony you were my best friend.”
He pauses, looking down at his hands and sees them shake.  “Sometimes I think I died down there.”
From 54985-466-8653
He wants to cry. He wants to rage. He wants to scream. He wants to beg for them back. There is a hand on his shoulder, and Jarvis, white haired and looking ancient, stands there beside him steady. “Yeah,” he says, voice even. “That’s Maria Stark.”)
“Tony,” Steve says low and quickly, like he is tripping over himself to get the words out.  “Tony you can stay here as long as you want. I told you that when you woke up. You don’t have to just leave.”
She probably did.
The second his fingers touch the armor, he knows it’s wrong.  He taps it, and feels the metal give a little, like it’s softer metal, maybe even aluminium.  He reaches in the arc reactor hole, looking for the manual switch and finds none. It’s actually smooth inside, no wires or circuitry.
The sound of a gunshot has Cap ducking behind the wall of the abandoned stand.  He’s crouched near the group on the group.  Some twitch, but no one moves.  There are five more rapid fire shots, and Cap works on locating the sniper in the metal gleaming from the bright wind chime like items hanging from the roof.
But sometimes, Steve imagines what it could be like, if Tony was in love with him.
Steve turns away from them and scoops up the shield.  Tony keeps an eye out, and one guy looks back and lines up a shot at Steve's head.  "Behind," Tony barks, and Steve throws the shield up, and the shot pings loudly off the vibranium.
Tony gaps.  “I’m a mother?  And I didn’t get anything for Mother’s Day?  For shame son of mine.  For shame!”
Tony doesn't want to disappoint her, so he keeps his mouth shut.  He can't understand why her eyes start welling up too. "I'll be the best, so I can prove everyone wrong."
Steve scoffs and rolls his eyes, like he is saying, you already buy everything around here, but whatever.  Tony doesn’t call him on it, just grins back.
I don’t control my robots
He shifts back, getting ready to stand.  “Sorry to crash the insomnia party Steve.  But I should get back to the grind.”
"What is this holodeck you speak of?" Thor booms even as a grin spreads across his face.
Tony sighs.  “What have you found girl?”
Avenger’s eyes slide for side to side, and everyone knows, but is careful to look away from Tony.  Wanda’s eyes light up, and she begins twitching her fingers. Steve nods to Barnes and takes off running at Thanos.  Thanos bats him away with the almost finishes gauntlet, and Steve goes flying, skin rippling colors before Wanda catches him.
Bucky knows his habits and moods, and while he's still recovering, he still knows Steve well enough to hum again.
, Tony mouths.  He thinks of all the unsaid things, all the tangled memories and dreams.  He doesn’t know what is real any more.  What is him versus the stone.
And anyways, he always said his pre-serum memory was like Swiss cheese.  “I’ve got to get back to work.”
Tony watches Rhodey out of the corner of his eye, see the struggles Rhodey has as he adjusts the level of support the skeleton gives him. He expands out the design, focusing on moving the support module higher up and easier to grip but still sleek enough to not look clunky. He adjusts some of the lines, thins the metal used. Maybe there is light weight solution that doesn't look as alien as the current version.
“No boss.”
There is a sharp intake from beside him. "
The bomb doesn’t explode.  The wires look to be disconnected. The boy is yelling out and furiously clicking the useless button.  Wanda lets the wall of red down, “Get rid of the explosives Wanda,” Tony mutters.  “They are still live.”
"I won't," Tony promises, like Daniel would have promised.  Daniel's promises were always kept.
He remembers her holding his hand, fierce and bright in that hospital room, even in a bloodstained dress.  The way she had looked at him like he had already gone too far from her.
Tony carefully looks to his right and sees the gap there, what is missing, and repeats, “I can still feel it.”
Looks like you’re in Vienna on the 18th.  I can meet you there. - Tony
Tony laughs.  “You think the best of people, and it’s part of my job to expect the worst, so of course we’re never going to agree.  I still am surprised we get along most of the time.”
Never.
Something inside of him had always balked at becoming that obsessed with a single creation that it being gone would be like carving a piece of himself out, so he had turned away from the super soldier prompts.
There is an ease in this sort of dynamic, the push and the pull, that they have grown comfortable in the more time they spend around each other in the Tower or on missions together. The give and take of being coworkers and companions and finding your place in a team. He just finished settling into his place by Tony’s side, a year into this. Comfortable when Tony presses too hard with pushing back just as much.
The words resound down to Tony’s bones, and something rattles in the back of his mind.  Like a sense of deja vu.
There are moments before all of this, where they were all almost friends.  Comrades in arms definitely.  Friendly but almost friends.  After, he deluded himself thinking it would all be the same eventually.  With some measures and a few more socially things, things could go back to really friendly.
"Thanks for not holding him against me," Tony tacks on when the silence hangs too long, looking down to the scraps of paper with a treadmill sketched out on it.  Something a super soldier could maybe use.
It’s easier this way Tony knows.  It doesn’t wipe away the gross cling of the knowledge he is using someone he likes, he respects, like that.
Reaching out, he takes the handy water bottle in hand and takes a sip before continuing. "At this time, I have had no contact with any Avenger that is not Colonel Rhodes or the being named Vision. Also lay off Spidey. He's a decent guy who just wants to help."
Tony blinks slowly before looking down.  He comes to himself in phases, awareness sorting itself through his system one limb at a time.  But Bruce is used to the routine.  It's normal for them.  "Yeah," Tony mutters.  "I should."
You and I both know I do.
Tony can hear Rhodey's chair creak he turns. He scrubs a stain on the table left over from the "we will never allow Tony to cook again" incident from 3 months ago. It won't come out.
“I can't love you like that," Pepper tells him, when he finally tells her
"It's over," Strange calls and Thanos falls to his knees.
It lingers for a moment before shifting into a face, hair curling around the sides, and Tony startles at the face, knows it.  “FRIDAY?” he whispers.
"The Joint Counter Terrorism Centre will be splitting out with a new division called S.W.O.R.D. It has been deemed by the UN that current Deputy Task Force Commander Everett Ross will be taking charge of this new group. They will be the man power behind the additional investigation into all the enhanced individuals during and after the Vienna bombings." He nods to the shorter man who slid into Ross' place beside him moments earlier. "In addition, Commander Ross and his team will be the enforcement behind any decisions the UN makes at this time."
Tony drags out the next roll of his eyes, but he can’t help the fond smile from spreading on his face.  “Unfortunately, not everyone is as idealistic as you Steve. And two generations would not change that.”
When they talk these days, it's rambling stories of some design or project or just anything.  Their initial tensions are gone, but Tony isn’t easy with him.  Tony isn’t easy with anyone, really.  He teases Steve mercilessly.  He doesn’t escalate any more, with his reactions to the jabs. Tony's wide mouth grin takes the bite of his words even before they come out.
“Maria Foundation?” she whispers.  Tony nods as he stands.
Steve will act hesitant, but he’s secretly relieved. They always are.
There is a purple giant standing back, watching as one by one his armored soldier things throw themselves against the forcefield and get flung backwards.  “Is that?” Clint murmurs, hands absently twitching before he grabs onto both of his arms and clings tight enough the skin dimples under his grip.
He pulls back and smiles.  “Go, bring home the bacon. I’ll be here waiting.”
“Oh,” Steve replies, distantly, his shoulders falling in defeat, and fuck
okay?” He pushes, moving closer, letting Friday spend a little more time scanning him.
or even,
I won’t come looking for the Cap squad.  But if we meet again, I can’t help you Nat.  You need to make sure they know that.  I can’t help
look Bruce’s face tends to default to when he gets around Tony.  Something in Tony tightens at the thought.
Carol leads the Avengers in his stead.  She dies in battle thirty years after him.  Kamala Khan takes on her legacy and shoulders it for another fifty years after before she goes down too.
When Steve finally takes it, she adds, "I talk to him too." Steve meets her gaze, again, and there is something vulnerable about her nonchalance.
Tony has a million questions.  How being the foremost and his hands itch to get on the tech.  Figure it out. He misses his lab, tries not to think too hard about the fact he is 300 years in the future and he doesn’t have a lab any more
“Really,” Steve returns.  He’s still surprised he was let into the lab, but maybe Tony didn’t want this one argument out between everyone.  Not again.  “I never hated you.  I didn’t get what you saw.”  He shrugs.  “Now?  Now I see what you saw, but I still don’t agree with it.  I don’t think all humans are terrible.”
The sunlight from the open windows gleams off Vision on the unnatural way Tony has adjusted to over time. It took some time, after the relief and childish glee that it worked, that they were alive, wore off, but Tony adjusted. He's good at iterative development, adjusting as the requirements change.
even. “Why Natasha, I never would have thought you would have cared.”
"Fry shut down the simulation," Tony breathes in, and it rattles around in his chest.  He can still feel Ana’s warm on his skin and the smell of her rose petal perfume in the air, even as the simulation fades.
Bucky rolls his eyes.  “Stop being an asshole then and do something before someone accuses  you of trying to find a way to off Tony.”
, he thinks firmly.  He’s been here for three years, and he can’t still call it the future.  It makes the therapists take too many notes.
Tony’s head snaps up immediately.  “I’ll handle it,” he says, looking up from the gauntlets he’s been working on.  Or attempting to work on. His hands are vibrating like they did back in his party phase, and he took a little too much meth.  He can’t make them stop.
“They were worthy changes,” T’Challa admits.  “I wanted many of the same things.”
“You really don’t.” Tony pitches his voice loud enough that the rest can track the conversation.  “You’ve got the gun to strip away the shape shifting. You’ve got the people to take out the Skrulls here.  I’ve barely been useful the entire time.”
, he thinks, pushing himself a little bit faster.
“Take them down girl?” Tony asks lightly.
He gets into the bed and pulls the blanket over his head, counting breaths until he can’t think about anything except for the next number in the order.
Tony finds himself telling T’Challa stories of Rhodey, walking and retiring from the military.  Vision who has decided to try and cook through the entirety of the Joy of Cooking to some’s horror and other’s delight.  Bruce and their quiet work on nanobots, and Spidey who they both agree with either be mortal enemies or best friends with Shuri and they must never meet.
Steve looks back up to him, grin wicked for a moment.  “Wouldn’t you like to know?” He asks.
So he had taken his legos and replicated the design one day.  He had slowly narrowed it, using smaller and smaller blocks until he had taken the size down from his arm to his fist.
“FRIDAY,” Tony says in lieu of an answer.
“Two men can marry?”  His tone is wondering, and Tony wonders for a moment about that before pushing the thought down.
His heart stutters sometimes, but Steve doesn't dwell on it.  Just asks Tony another question to set him off racing again.
Rhodey shifts, like he is about to do something and Tony takes a deep breath until he can feel his lungs pressing against his ribs, too full and ready to burst. "Okay Tones," Rhodey sighs instead. He slips off the chair and goes towards the stairs.
“Hello Vision,” T’Challa says.  The being looks up from his artful arrangement of strawberry slices and returns the greeting.
He picks up the next piece, the new ARC reactor that he was thinking about installing in the suit under a layer of Starkium.  Vibranium had been a something he had thought about for a second, but Tony remembers the video from the Siberian facility FRIDAY had shown him after the bruises had turned green.  It glows vibrantly, and the glasses list output numbers in the corner of his vision.  It could power the suit even in the event of his death, but could cause a nuclear explosion with the right combination in case Tony needs that option.  He inspects the locking mechanism, twisting it left and right to make sure it wouldn’t engage.  Tony is pressing his thumb against the edge at 7 o’clock when the reporter busts out, “It looks like we have footage of Captain America himself in battle.  Be warned, this footage is graphic and should not be viewed by anyone under the age of 18.”
She thins her lips but nods. Steve turns on his heel and goes.
“We search for things we love,” Steve replies.  Tony meets his gaze and neither says anything. It’s like they are in a standoff, two sides fighting.
I believe you and I should have a conversation about the Sokovia Accords.  Your legal team has engaged the United Nations about the wording around the accords and are preparing for negotiations for more rigorous contacts.  Since this would impact myself as well, I would like to ascertain if our viewpoints align on this topic.
Steven's taken the second guy out viciously and is running across the room to the man on the table, panicked.  "it's not him.  It's not him," Tony repeats as Steve comes to a stop and reaches out.
T’Challa is covering Tony’s font, like a final defense, Wanda hovers over his right, one hand trained on him and keeping up a forcefield and the other throwing balls of energy at anyone she can catch.  Vision is phasing in and out of the enemy and calmly pushing the rest back on his left.
We’re working on it
They survive the battle in the Savage Lands.
He’s in the middle of a familiar yet unfamiliar lab.  He’s seen this mess in pictures, his dad’s arm around another man, older, stooped in a way that is familiar to Tony now.  It’s the look of someone who has seen his creation turned against him and the world. Something that was supposed to be good has turned evil.
“The Winter Soldier,” Steve snorts before shaking his head.  “Buck hated winter. Loved Spring, always made jokes about women blooming out of their winter jackets and other nonsense like that.  God, he would hate it. Hate the title. Hate who he’s become.”
“Thank you,” Tony says to T’Challa, at the end of the final day.  “I didn’t think you were going to help.”
He stands a head taller than Spidey side by side.  “How?” He waves to encompass all of Spideman.
After that, the latest SI phone.
They win, in the end.
"Oh, you're just using his an excuse to get around the grocery bill huh?" Tony's voice carries mild sarcasm, his media voice.  "I see what you're doing here. Just using me for my bank account."
Steve always forgets him.
They continue to laugh and tell more ridiculously crazy adventures a time traveler could get up to.  Eventually, Peggy and Maria return and add taller tales, everyone giggling before Howard comes in, listens for a few minutes before raising his eyebrows higher and higher until Maria has to rescue him and explain exactly how they got on the discussion of taking dinosaurs to the Louve for a party.
Tony spends his days reading history, watching movies.  Spending time with Steve for longer than he can remember.
boss?" she retorts, and Tony curses the fact that he once thought he liked personality in his AIs.
They stay down there, spitting ideas back and forth as FRIDAY records them, until Vision drifts through the ceiling causing a bark of fright from Bruce.  “Colonel Rhodes has asked both of you to come upstairs for dinner.  He says, and quote, ‘I’m not fixing dinner to get stood up.  Tell Tony to drag his butt up down before I come down there and do it for him.”  His voice is a perfect mimicry of Rhodey’s.  Tony isn’t sure if it’s a recording or something of his own creation.
He’s pulled up, noise rushing into his ears.  None of it makes sense.  Tony makes a garbled noise as he sucks in air, coughing out water as he chokes on it.  He is shaken, and all Tony can do is try to breathe while noise echoes around him.
Steve deepens the kiss, like he knows Tony is thinking too hard.  Tony grins into it as his heart skips a beat, and under his fingers, he feels Steve’s do the same.
We have our strategy for getting project aftermath ready. Shall we proceed?
Tony scans the room and doesn't see the other nearby.
He sighs and sits down, head in his hands and brain jumbled.
He doesn't have time to check on Tony because Thanos is pressing his advantage, and Steve won't let him get to the body that had slumped, like all of his strings were cut, in front of him.
When they enter the simulation room, the rest of the team is playing with the goodies Tony has been working on. JARVIS must have shown them the armory next door.
In the middle of the room is a glass container.  Most of it is covered in frost, but the face is clear.
He goes up and the younger version goes low. They continually switch directions, relentless as they push Thanos who can't get a break, can't use the stones because he's reacting to Steve throwing the shield or the other version boomeranging back.
Silence spreads between them.  Loud and deafening.“Do I need to be concerned?” the king says, finally getting to the real reason behind everything.
didn’t you know i already own that?
Tony thinks longly of the coffee he came up for, before settling down the couch beside the captain.  “Too loud in your own head?” Tony offers.  Steve puts down his pad and pencil before nodding.  “Yeah, I usually blast some AC/DC until I can’t hear it any more.  Bruce swims when it all gets too much.  I think it’s the lack of oxygen for that scenario.  Natasha and Clint go at each other until they are sweaty piles of mush.  You sketch.”
Jarvis had been the same, always on their other side.  A secret smile and a small sweet in his pocket. They had said spoken novels in their actions.  They didn’t need to hear him say it again.
“Perfectly.”
The sun is shining and in the distance, they can see the shimmer of the barrier, but not the monsters on the other side.  T’Challa is marching with different contingents of warriors, suit and mask in place already as he speaks with a larger man with a monkey pelt over his shoulder.
“I wear the gloves to keep people from freaking out, and it keeps the hand warm, but the inside is heated.  Shuri knew what she was doing,” Tony replies as he leans back against the railing, hand still on Steve’s pulse point.
Steve always says yes.
"Some days," Steve replies, shrugging inelegantly as Tony studies him. "But I feel comfortable in other places too."
He thinks about the lonely man he was before.  Holding himself hostage as he built the knot of his own personality and thought larger and tighter.  Thinks about himself now, the unease that only finds him in moments and doesn’t hang over his shoulders like a cloak.
“Put a shield around the entire world,” Tony says, barely loud enough to be heard.
Between the latest Hawkeye and Captain Marvel, Tony is able to figure out that Steve is the senior Avengers leader.  He has taken a step back in the last six months since Tony was found. He’s back up and team trainer. They commiserate over Steve’s relentless style.
“Looks like the Falcon is alright,” the anchor says, relief clear in her voice as the view minimizes,  “It also looks like the Black Widow is on the scene.  One has to wonder if she will be sanctioned by the UN, since she signed the Sokovia Accords and is fighting in what is clearly a non UN mission.”
(Parker is there and Steve sees the full body freeze Tony has when he sees the kid before he shakes it off.
He looks at Steve wordlessly searching for something while Steve feels like he's in that conference room, sneaking glances at Tony, listening to himself and Clint talk and knows where this sends up.
Tony had looked at him, uncertain and that had made Steve even more worried.  “I honestly don’t know.”)
"I can't keep doing this," Pepper says quietly, fiercely.  She refuses to meet his eyes.  "Not if you are going to keep chasing death."
He takes a deep breath in and thinks,
"Are you helping other vigilantes who have not signed the Accords like Spiderman? Maybe Captain America?"
OMG PLEAse STOP
Tony catches it later, the machine hooked up to the IV cord to the man on the table pushes something into the IV.  The man starts writhing, but when he looks up, his brown eyes are wide and dilated.  It's not Barnes, but it's still horrifying to watch as he begins to age, veins pulsing like he is screaming but no sound coming out.  He dies quickly.
“It sounds like the camps,” Steve finally utters past numb lips. “The ones in Germany.”
Tony lifts the case.  “You asked me if I knew anything about brainwashing.  I know how to cure it.”
Almost done guys.  Honest.
Yay, here is a chapter.  Yes it took me a year because I had to write a sex scene.  No that isn't a joke.  Excuse me while I die now.  (Also, the weird characterizations have a reasoning now!!!!  It's not just my terrible ability to write!!!!0
There are rooms in that compound of disrupted lives.  Of hopes and dreams and visions of the future scattered around, like forgotten mines for him to stumble across.  There are entire wings he can’t bring himself to look into.
There are days Steve is a stranger in his own skin. Head lost in what if and scenarios where he could have been better, should have been better. But more days than not, when he is creating something, he feels settled. Feels like there is a hope, maybe.
He thinks about the way she had looked at him, so tired.  Exhausted by his very existence.
But now that he’s looking, he sees the differences in Tony too.  The way he holds himself a little too tightly, the way he looks a little ragged around the edges (more so than he used to).  The way he doesn’t carry a glass of something amber.  The way Bruce keeps eying him, the way Spider-Man only touches his left side.  Tony looks older than Steve remembers him, worn down to the bone and holding back some pain.
Rhodey eyes him for a moment before reaching out. Tony grips his hand and hauls Rhodey up. "I'm cooking this time though. You burn water."
He grins at Steve, hand open in front of him, arc reactor glowing dimly on it.  “Do you remember what you said?”
"138 missions is a lot of time to think," Tony muses, quietly.
“Oh,” he looks at Peggy, eyes wide.  She tilts her head, and it’s like he’s twelve again and she’s reminding him how to work through a tough problem.
But that means Tony's been here since at least midnight, and the way he wears the layers of the suit is telling. Tony's always worn around the edges Bruce has begun to notice.  Ragged like the edges of his t-shirts, lines of his face deeper, shadows under his eyes darker.  He's been that way for longer than Bruce can remember.
He thinks later,
Her hand traces the curve of his face, “Do you know what I did in the face of such American ideals?”
I'll be there in 3 days. Tower?
Tony carefully doesn’t say anything that would say too much about his childhood.  “So it’s 1974 then?” The pulling begins to hurt a little, reminding him he only has so much time before he has to move on.

“How?” he asks when he can say words again.
He adds the last semicolon before leaning back from the table.  “Yeah,” Tony agrees.  “I think we got it finally.  We just need to do some human testing at some point.”
No.  That’s exactly what I needed to hear.
This Peggy is sharp, like the woman Steve sketches from time to time with fondness and ease.  She is jagged around the edge, still working on being tempered by her recent tragedies and anger with how the world works outside the war for her.  But in this moment, she’s relaxed, shoes off and jacket across a chair as she leans back and reads.
Bucky hums.
Tony shrugs, the yanking threatening to throw him to the floor, so he needs tiny Steve gone
But Steve’s dead.  And it’s Tony’s fault.
Steve looks at him, really looks at Tony, and whispers, broken hearted, “Why do I have to?”
“Why tell when you can show and experiment?” Tony mocks, and Shuri prods something in the wiring of the arm that makes Tony yelp.  They both laugh outrageously, before Shuri pulls backs the instrument and asks how his pain levels are.
“We have them built.  We just need to test it.”
“Business meetings happen everywhere,” Tony utters as he takes a seat.  “You gotta be prepared.”
Because he needs to be alone with this, wants to be alone with this. Doesn’t need Steve for this. Doesn’t
Steve’s taken to sitting in the chair by Tony’s bedside when Rhodey or Pepper or anyone else isn’t there. It’s usually during the night time hours, while Tony is sleeping. Steve sits with a sketchbook and just draws.
He’s wrong.
“What?” Tony yelps over Rhodey’s grumbling  “Tell me everything Brucie.”
He watches Tony breathe, counts the beats. "Was it so bad, the future?" Bucky asks as they await the medics for Tony. The people around him move, but Steve only has one thing on his mind.
“Tony,” Steve says, firm.  “Take the compliment for once.”
“You did good Tony,” Steve says softly.
When he opens his eyes again, Tony’s hand is raised, reaching for the amulet, and he doesn’t even remember beginning to reach for it.  “I’m…” Tony starts and stops, taking stock of himself and his stance. “I’m missing time,” he admits. It feels like something that has to be ripped from him to admit it.
“We had a deal about the name thing,” Tony replies as he throws 3 more pens.  Spidey twists until he is facing Tony head on and snatches all 3 out of the air about a foot in front of his face.
The other guy is roaring distantly in his own head.  The tone isn't angry, just significant, reminding.  Like there is something just out of reach for them both a tickle at the edge of their memory.  "Oh," he said, before following it with a bit more feeling.  "
Tony sneers a little. “Why are you even here Cap? I thought I locked the doors.”
Tony laughs, low and tired. “You don’t understand. You never understand.”
Steve huffs a laugh and waits a beat before he takes off for the doors.  Tony watches the camera with half an eye as the 3D model of the building and surrounding area tracks Steve's movements (blue for his tracker, always blue) against the bright red glow of the other heat signatures.
Why indeed.
For Tony, teetering on the edge of something, the sense of balance is lacking.  The fearful edge of what comes next nips at his heels, keeping him running - sprinting - to the next ledge as he climbs, hoping desperately he doesn’t fall.  It’s been like this for a long time, he is realizing.
“Now,” Tony pulls his hands out of his pockets and holds them in front of him, running the flat palms against each other.  “I didn’t mean to say something and run…” he trails off. He meets Steve’s eyes and lets his lips kick up, sincere. “But I’ve never been great at being honest and sentiment.”
He sits for scans.  He answers questions and tests with machine’s scanning his brain.  His answers are stuttering, and he has to reach for some when he knows they used to be easy before.  Steve holds his hand every single time, and Tony’s knuckles are white as he grips it. His mind is racing with different scenarios, each one worst than the next.
Ana’s voice is weak and thready, “Oh love, we already know.”  She catches Tony’s gaze as he stares at her from the doorway, wide eyed.  Her smile gentles.
“A little of everything,” Natasha retorts.  “You know how well I don’t like choosing just one thing.”
Steve leaning on the island, watching for the moment to step in, a mug of something warm in his hands.  Eyes sometimes turning back to Tony.
Tony’s sitting in the dark of the living room, the only light in the room is the one coming from the window.  He’s leaning with his head against the glass, staring blindly out into the nothingness.
Rhodey hands Tony his mug. He takes it and puts it in the sink, carefully washing the ceramic before leaving it on the drying rack. He goes back for the cloth he was using for drying when he catches Rhodey still watching him.
There is an awkward silence for a moment before Bruce breezes past Tony.  “It’s a pleasure to meet you, your majesty.  Your country always produces some of the most amazing medical journals.”
"I know I don't get this," he says to the floor, and then realizes Tony deserves to see his face, and deserves to see that this is sincere. "I've accepted that. A long long time ago. I know I can't make up for what I've done. I'm sorry you found out."
They laugh. They live.  And Tony feels like he can breathe for the first time in a long time.  Like something isn't hanging over him.
There is no one there, just him, and as he looks down at his hand, he can see he’s out of the suit.  Just himself, wearing nothing.
“The Chitauri?” Natasha finishes as she steps closer into her partner’s space.  Their shoulders are basically touching. “Yeah, they look pretty familiar.” Natasha tilts her neck, a casual stretch that leans her closer to Clint, and she murmurs something in his ear before tilting the other way.  Wanda watches them with a curiosity and a sheen of red still in her eyes, and Vision watches her.
trusted
This feels like one of those latter moments.
Rhodey rolls his shoulders before continuing, "You gotta stop punishing Vision for this you know. It's no one's fault."
They learn how to avoid each other’s sharp edges in the weeks that come.  How to be people again and not just broken.
Tony ends a call as Steve strolls in, still sweaty and a towel being rubbed against his head.  He looks at Tony fondly.  "You've been talking to Pepper more," he offers because Steve always notices.
Tony laughs, bitter.  “You are the only one out of the two of us.”
He smiles when he says, "yeah", a rueful sort of thing. He really means it.
"Oh yeah. Favorite story was the day Aunt Peg shot at your shield. Said he had never met a more firey dame or a more noble man." He leads the way out of the room and down towards the stairs. Steve trailed beside him.
Something inside of Tony just breaks, shatters, fucking falls to pieces on the floor and leaves him with his gaping hole in his chest that he can’t fill. That he needs to fill. Needs to get something inside of it, make it stop dripping blood and spilling his guts on the floor, but all he can do is stare, stare at the floor, stare at the things that are just broken and fucked up and so completely him that Tony doesn’t know what else to do.
“I want to punch you or ask you to fuck me,” Tony replies. “I can’t figure out which, so you make the first move, and I’ll follow.”
He stands there and watches her play, listening as she sings “
Steve laughs, purely to keep from crawling out from his skin.  “Yeah.  Just a few.”
He stands there and watches as Rhodey disappears into the next room. Something in him crumbles and rebuilds in the moments it takes to catch his breath. Something ever so small but vital. He stands there, rumpled suit, aching feet, and wet face until Rhodey yells, "You coming Tony? I need an audience for all this awesome."
Tony runs a ran across his bare chin before shrugging.  “And you look like shit.”
"Bruce is optimistic."
“You’re not supposed to admit it!” Peter cries before turning back to Tony, shoulders slumping, “Yeah we were.”
“Okay, I’ll shut up,” he says to his tablet more than Rhodey.
Steve swallows down a lot of his words around Tony these days.
“Hey pretty,” Tony croakes out.  Rhodey’s head snaps up and he looks exhausted, like at the edge of a four day binge of all nighters - like back at MIT.  He goes to reach out for Rhodey, and that’s when it all snaps back into focus, the sharp pain that overrides everything he can see, hear, feel, even taste.
Then he wakes up, alone in his room, door locked, panting too hard to ignore the dream.
“Howard?” She wonders for a moment, easing her her grip.  But then her eyes go to his goatee and they narrow. “Howard doesn’t have facial hair like that.”
I got a the work cell you sent me. If you ever need anything I'll be there.
A proximity alarm tells him about the hand Steve puts on his arm. He has the face plate pull back as he faces him. "Yes Cap?"
Tony catches his eye, serious when he replies, “Oh, I remember everything about that day.  We started something that mattered. Because of you, the world change.
“I used to know how to break something down and put it back together,” Tony says.  He has the replicator like food thing broken down into pieces in front of him. Some are twisted and bent, others are carefully ordered and organized.  He feels the glass all around him, and when he shifts, he feels it underneath his feet as well. Cutting in.
“We good Fry?” He asks before she affirms, and Tony watches the countdown go to 20 feet, 15, 10, 5, and throws his arms out repulsors crackling as he braces for impact.
If he’s honest, meeting Steve’s gaze will be the hardest thing he’ll ever do - if he does.
Bruce glances over his shoulder at Tony, who shrugs.  “You always think I am joking when I call you the light of my life.”  Bruce grimaces at the familiar phrase.
Steve’s face twists into what Tony learns later is an incredulous look, like he can’t believe how dumb Tony is being.  The points the genius is missing to connect. “You appreciate?” Steve repeats. “Are you kidding?”
Bruce nods as he ambles over.  “A better version of your suitcase suit.”
He sighs. "No. You're a reminder of the good times. The Avengers. The dreams we shared, the idea that we could save the planet instead of tearing it apart. The chance that we could right our wrongs."
Steve's brow furrows as he looks at Tony.  "Tony," he says voice, low.
"Actually sir, yes. We did."
You shouldn't contact me again on this phone.  All Avenger digital channels are being monitored by the UN.
“Do you think about burning it all down sometimes?” Tony asks, drink in hand staring out at the skyline. Natasha’s barely in the room, but she knows it’s meant for her.
“We’re going to save you,” Maria’s voice rings out, steady but angry.  Tony spins on his heels to catch her staring at him from the otherside of the room.  Peggy and Jarvis flank her, but Daniel sits adjacent to them, watching him.
Draft reply to 54985-466-8653
He heads to the library, following the music to where he knows she is.  Knows it deep in his soul, and it feels like his heart is beating out of his chest, and Tony just wants to ignore the heaviness in his belly that will turn to tugging and yanking and stay here in this moment forever.
And it sounds like Steve, but it can’t be.
Tony stills and observes how the suit handles the movement as the two interact.  "Pepper did."
Tony's eyes widen.
Natasha doesn’t know how to say,
"Any time Steve," he returns, surprised to find he means it.
Steve leans on the kitchen counter, and Tony watches it light up.  The display shows off different household systems, waiting to be tapped and opened for more details than the simple dashboard views.
The silence drags between them. The quiet of the air conditioning, the sounds of the others way off in the distance, the city down below, the clink of the ice in his glass is all there and not. Natasha can see it weighing down on him. Lines building upon each other, the patchwork of his face that can’t be smoothed away with the alcohol. His face is a map that she still can’t read. He’s half translated, but in a language that is ever evolving.
Always my friend
Tony leans back into the hallway.  “Come on, I’ll buy you a coffee.”
No one had needed to know, Tony had told himself.  No one needed to worry.  He just needed to get these regulations downgraded, then bring them up. It was his role in the Avengers to deal with the political and PR BS.  He could do this, take care of this, and move on.
From 54985-466-8654
"People leave eventually," Peter bites out.  His eyes meet Tony'w but these are the lessons of someone who has lost everything before, and then again and again.  It's written down to Peter's very marrow.  "By death, by choice, or even driven to it.  People leave, you know that."
So, he narrows his focus on what he can understand.  He’s in the future. Steve’s older, but alive. So is he.  Technology has changed. But he’ll figure it out. He always does,
Steve just fucking stands there, helmet off this time, and grins from ear to ear.
She tunes out the others as she tries to find the missing pieces in this map. Clint settles besides her, watching her work. She knows there is a group growing, watching as she strings together different events, ordering them. She runs a search on Tony Stark and slowly begins mapping his tabloid articles in the timeline as well, placing similar locations in same sections, before moving on. Natasha then goes to scientific research, white papers, and pulls up as many as she can on the Chitauri invasion and impacts to the government, culture, war and propaganda. The Ultron incident. She circles back to recent department secretaries and pulls up profiles on each, taking special care to look at the Department of Labor’s secretary, highlighting some of his opinions on Stark Industries before spiderwebbing his circle of influence and then following the path of a senator on the Homeland defense committee.
He watches as Steve sets himself in front of Tony, watchful. “You okay?”
Pause.
“Oh,” someone says suddenly, and very abruptly. And Tony has to fight the urge to close his eyes to push back the sentiment that comes from the accent on the vowels.  “This is unexpected Howard.”
don’t call me old
The room is torn apart, a rage has left the person, or people, but Tony knows his father’s temper and has his suspicions on the culprit.  Everything was strewn around the room, but the chalkboard was left alone. A trailing equation was written across it, unanswered.
Fry says Friday.  Ha.
"Is there a question in there?" Tony asks idly. His gaze swings around the room. "I know you have one straight from Jameson's mouth, because let's be honest, that's where this is coming from. Triple J over there. I'll make this short. Yes, I am helping Spidey because he needed an upgrade if he was going to stand with me, because seriously, you can't stand with me and not look cool. It's a requirement."
They can't be further from each other.
Once he would have been interested in how it worked, breaking down the solution until he could simplify it for his own curiosity and knowledge before locking all of that down and never picking it up again. Now he’s seen Steve trail a broken man across the globe.
You think I could trust Bruce, Rhodes and Vision with my identity?
Steve knows Tony knows. It’s written in the frown between his brows.
, and Tony is
He laughs, loud and honest and unlike him. Unlike him with her. Natasha’s grin widens, and she hopes this is them getting better. Evolving. Becoming a new them. An honest version of themselves, and she’s okay with that.
Bruce took the pen from behind his ear and threw it at Tony, who dodged it with a laugh.  That had been the first time they had both laughed like it was before.  When it was just them.  No one else mediating them.
It’s quiet enough in the place, deep in the behind the scenes area of the exhibit that the sound of other people is nearly silent, that Steve’s sincerity is disconcerting.  Too honest. Too real. Tony ducks his head for a moment, takes in a deep breath, before meeting Steve’s eyes.
i need the money to feed my alcoholism
He sits there for minutes, ages, until his breathing is normal - in
Steve looks to the camera before he gets into the car with the "really Maria, what are we calling this division because if you don't name it soon I will and you will
He puts that project aside and picks the paperwork on the latest SI patents and tries to break down the white papers, the concepts and equations the teams are using to improve detection of anomalies in space from beyond Jupiter.  He writes on the windows, breaking down the equations, step by step. He goes back to window one twenty times before Steve comes back in the door.
Thanos scrambles away, and Thor curses loudly before No-Nose brings a shit-ton of bodies streaming at him.  He ducks, and then calls down a lightning strike again.
And he's falling for a moment, for
“Sure,” Tony replied.  “Show me what you got kiddo.”
He pushes down the bitter feeling and makes sure to smile too brightly at Steve when he comes back.
lelkem = my soul in Hungarian
She laughed her delighted laugh. The one she gives Jarvis when he picks her up and spins her around. "Oh
Tony spends a week more in the hospital, quiet without Steve there.  He prods the machines and the displays around him. Clearly older technology because it’s what he’s comfortable with, because it’s similar to what they used on Steve and the doctors are cautious to change anything when Tony was revived without the serum in his bloodstream.
The move into the Tower had been quiet, unassuming, and not picked up by the press really.  Tony has been a bit impressed with how he was being left alone.  After almost a month, he was losing the first place on Google to Finding Dory. Tony couldn’t be more relieved.
(Steve’s struggling in his sleep when he opens the door, and for a second Tony feels bad before he hears Steve muttering while moving roughly in his bed.
“My mother hated it you know,” he continues.  “I used to take things apart and put them back together, but she would walk in on me dismantling the microwave or toaster or anything I could get my hands on.”  He looks up, and Steve is trying to make it closer. “Jarvis thought it was hysterical. He loved it in his own way.”
“Wake up, old man,” he calls, pushing the door open a little more so the light helps Steve wake up.  “I know it’s late.”
"He knew.
His chest is moving too fast, like he can’t breathe.  Tony’s trembling, and he wants to reach out, but he can’t do this again.  Can’t live with him hallucinating Steve - not again.
Tony closes his eyes and thinks, thinks about what it was like before, when the threat of something coming for them didn’t hunt his every step.  When the world’s only threat was small corruption and trade wars and not the extinction of their entire race at the hands of a purple mad being.
He lurches away from the table, grabs his glass and goes back to the bottle of whiskey. "FRIDAY, show me Mark 15 of the exoskeleton." He says as he pours himself another drink.
Hands promptly appear in the air, and Tony leans around glancing at the faces in the crowd. His lips press together briefly, before pointing, "You. Jennifer is that you? Still with CNN?"
and surges forward. He kisses Tony deeply, pushing every ounce of himself into the kiss and trying to say things like
He knows that look now.  Tony saw it enough time on faces that weren’t just his father’s.  Tiberius Stone.  Justin Hammer.  Obie.  It’s like Obie always said. He has the stamina of an Olympic swimmer when it came to software and hardware.  Howard could swim decently enough, but it was a struggle some days.
"It's a bit too large here," Rhodey muses. "Feels like I am rattling around your old mansion." He takes another sip of coffee.
"You said this was one of the only places where you could be Steve," Tony finishes, palms flat on the table. "Is that still true?"
Tony smiles, "I love you too."
,” she murmurs into his hair, and Tony feels his heart falter for a moment.  “Oh how we have failed you dearest.”
Vision watches him, and sometimes Tony can see the code behind his eyes. The way Vision is running through if/else statements, trying to find the correct action based on the parameters given to him. The databases he is scouring. The code that Tony originally built, high off sleep deprivation and other things.
"What's more complicated than friends?" Bruce had asked, curious.
"He'll forgive you," she says, knowingly after she had studied the picture for a long time.
Tony reaches out, brushes his fingers against Steve's.  Leaves them there.
"My dad was an asshole," he offers one night.  The sun has long set, but Tony lingered after dinner and washing up, just talking with Steve, who kept going, like he had no where else to be as they migrated to one of the many sitting areas in the compound.
Steve is starting to realize exactly why they look at Tony that way.
Tony had grown up in a family who held secrets close to their chests.  He still looks back and wonders if they hadn't been spies, former soldiers, and wartime inventors, maybe they would have taught him to be honest.
(He’s right.  Tony hates it.
Don't let the fear of yourself keep you from loving or be loved.  We all deserve it, even if it doesn't feel like it.
He tries to borrow some of that calm, that balance, that T’Challa exudes.  The same calm he finds from time to time when he feels like he is bobbing above the water that is the onslaught of the last five years.  The moments have gotten fainter, he knows, since the moment Wanda waved her hands around his head, but that isn’t when it began.
The place where the arc reactor used to rest in his chest aches so fiercely for a moment that Tony can’t breathe.
"A little."
“No sir, you know I have no contact with my former teammates.  You have access to all my communications if you would like to check.”
Tony puts on the billionaire persona and feels Steve’s steady hand on his lower back as he chats. The heroes have questions about the early 2000’s and Tony tries to answer them the best he can while looking for the lab.  He can feel Steve’s eyes on him from time to time. He just smiles at the other man.
Tony's not sure who he is talking to, but whoever it is, they probably are.
Tony makes a joke, at least Steve thinks it's a joke.  It's careless, just falls from his lips like he isn't thinking about it.
Thank you
“Do you know what was one of the first things I did when I got back?”  Steve asks. And Tony watches him, jaw firm and strong. “I went looking for you.  I fought the idea that you were dead. You had thought I was dead, and I was just lost in time.  I wasn’t dead, so you couldn’t be. I looked for five years before I had to admit you were dead.”
“It’s time for dinner,” FRIDAY announces.  “Should I inform Colonel Rhodes you are not attending?”
“It’s an unconventional beginning.”  Steve utters.  “You almost died, and I can’t stand by and, how did you put it?  Be a creepy stalker after that.”
But now, with these people around him, Tony doesn’t think it’s the same.  They are worried, frightened. The alarms are blaring, and he’s just another in a long list of apocalyptic signs that the end is coming, and he’s one of the oldest here.  He knows most of them.
Steve's eyes are heavy with confusion, and Tony hates talking about it so he just places a hand on his chest, over the arc reactor.
we’re moving into the tower.  this is your friendly fyi.  ffyi.
He can fill the air rush out of his lungs, the water rushing in.  He thrashed, shakes, pleads in his head.  The water muffles any other noise.  It’s silent, he barely can keep a thought in his head.  There comes a moment where he watches the bubbles as they rise from his mouth.  They move so slowly.  He’s going to die here, he already knows.  He’s going to die here, and it’s going to be in this moment.
“This is how we show we care,” Bruce returns.  “We take care of you too.  You can’t just take care of us, and not think we’re going to try to take care of you.”
"I started painting again," he adds, leaning on Bucky.
He’s lived this once before. He shouldn’t have to again.
She hums, and activates the missile launchers on his shoulder, creating and building things out of the nanobots in milliseconds before sending them at the Chitauri nearly on his back.  They go flying, and Tony uses the momentum to bowling down to the ground, turning his arm into a long blade and taking out the group in front of him before spinning. They freeze before the 15 soldiers slowly fall.
Tony is struck by a reminder about how much the Tower never changed after Ultron.  He had been working on the compound, and it had been ready shortly after Sokovia, and the team had moved in mass to leave the bad memories behind.  Widow, he remembers, had been one of the first to make the move.
Tony shoots him a quicksilver grin over his shoulder before he turns back to the gauntlet.  “Whatever makes you feel Captain.”
Tony turns back. "Nah. Aunt Peg would have shot him in the family jewels and then I would never have been here," Tony says with a smile makes up for what it lacks in authenticity with wattage. "He met Mom while she worked in the early days of SHIELD. Fell in love, had me, died in a crash crash."
Keep your eyes on the most dangerous person in the room and get out the second you feel your life is in danger.
He doesn’t say, at the hand of his dead brainwashed ally, friend, whatever Howard and Barnes had been.  He doesn’t say, suffocating after listening to your husband die, weak and slowly feeling the air leave your lungs and sharp squeaks as you try to get oxygen and can’t.  He doesn’t say, drowning in a pool of water, battery sparking at your chest as people scream, trying to break you down into something they can use. But it’s a close thing.
"I should have just stayed dead that last time.  Life would be so much easier."
“But,” Steve says, desperation clear in his voice. “He wanted the restrictions.”
he says or something similar, but Steve burns with wanting to apologize. Speaking aloud, for once.
Rhodey chimes in, “Why are you saying that?  Where are you?” There is some grunting on his line for a second, and across the bottom of the screen, a miniature of War Machine’s armor blinks red sharply, then yellow and then eases into a soft green.
Steve can see the moment Tony looks past Natasha’s shoulder and makes him out.  He doesn’t look surprised.  He just looks tired.  Like some lines have been chiseled into his face.  Steve yeans for his sketchbook to capture this moment.  Tries to memorize the way Tony looks at him, everything that is different and the same.  This is a moment he doesn’t want forget.
Steve smiles filthily at him. “I think I know a few. Like the Avengers compound you think you have been hiding from me.”
He clears his throat and continues, “And now I’ve lost you too.  Maybe,” he pause and takes in a deep breath. “Maybe there was a reason you had to be on the other side of every argument.  How could you be my runner steering me when others couldn’t…”
“You good Cap?” He asks, and Steve shakes himself before answering.
we’re going to name this new safety protocol the Parker Rule
Thor looks at them, and Steve sees the way Tony has his back up, none of his carefree posture.  The way Natasha is watching him like he's a live grenade.
Her hand tightens on his bicep and she just says, "I've missed you."
Dragging himself upwards, back to the conversation, Tony clears his throat.  “It looks like he has an army trying to get through the border,” he mentions, eyes narrowing as he takes in the sea of bobbing forces just behind the giant - Thanos, probably.  “They were pretty feral back in New York but not too bright. Mostly trying to overrun us in sheer numbers.” He looks to Steve, ignoring the emotions across the other man’s face.  “What else do you remember?”
It’s three days post-op when he starts mainlining morphine again.
Still it’s a good moment.  A second of normalcy in the middle of it all.)
The few times Steve had talked about being under the ice, he had mentioned something like this.  It had been after a nightmare, and Steve had had to push out the words between chattering teeth. “It’s like I can’t get warm,” he had admitted.  “Like the ice has gone down to his bones.”)
How is he handling it
[7] (Russian) There was a Russian reimagining of the Wizard of Oz in 1939 called the Wizard of the Emerald City by Alexander Volkov. The translation for the name used for Tin Man is Iron Lumberjack.  Dorothy Gale was renamed Ellie Smith, which is something you will need to know for the next chapter.
“Judging my alcohol choices, are we Captain?” Tony queries, taking Bucky’s seat beside him on the couch.
"Yes boss," she affirms.
Another doctor in the back shakes her head no.  “We can’t interface with Extremis. It’s too old, out of date, and it’s warped when he was in the ice.  We just can’t. Your friend is how he is. There is nothing we can do.”
“You sound like you are mad at me about that,” Tony muses.  “Why are you mad at me about that? It was all the kid, not me!”
, he thinks.  And that hurts less.  It says something, but he pushes the thought away.
Thanos goes flying from the explosions, and Tony follows him, skimming the ground and keeping low as hit after hit lands.  Thanos bounces, once, twice, and then stops. His eyes are closed, and Tony comes in, laser trying to cut off the hand with the gauntlet.  Thanos’ eyes snap open, and he tightens his fist.
Reed levels him with a heavy, knowing look, and Tony meets his gaze evenly replying before Reed can say anything too loud like,
Thank you Tony
"Tony?" She asks, because Pepper always knew when he was lost.
Steve laughs at Tony's jokes.  Is able to pull details about his past out of him, but never asks why he is at the compound and not the tower.
“When I came home,” Tony repeats, and it hangs between them.  JARVIS carefully does not respond, and for an AI with the tendency to ask Tony multiple times a day to clarify or explain something, it’s telling.
Then, Johnny kills Hank.
Just because you are angry about Rhodey doesn’t mean you should take it out on me.
Tony. Are you there?
Yeah, I know the feeling
She laughs, and leaves her hand on his cheek.  “I did a few things before I ran, but yes, exactly.  But I saw what my country was becoming, what my world was going to become, so I reached back out.  I saved as many people as I could.”
Tony doesn’t respond for a while until he finishes soldering the two wires in his hands together.  “You ought to have a nice place to contemplate the universe in here.”
They don’t really talk about it. Never really talked about it. Sometimes it all hangs heavy between them, but Tony is good at ignoring when he really needs to be talking through his issues.
“No,” Rhodey replies.  “That’s because of that one fight with the Vulture you had kid.  You know, the one where there were a metric ton of arc reactors that could have broken in the fall and you could have
“And?”
“He wouldn’t actually do any of the work,” Sam states, and everyone looks to him. He standing straight, fingers resting in a light hold of the couch. “Stark’s a lot of things, but he wouldn’t do anything to provide the government assholes anything that would hurt anyone.”
And he continues to systematically destroy his room piece by piece. The lamp goes, and then the other pillow, a magazine is torn. He kicks, punches and breaks everything around him, yearning for something more, something that could, would, might, fill this ache inside. Make sense after all this shit. Something that he can focus on.
He calls three weeks later while Steve is in the air, flying commercial to stay under the radar even though Tony tried to get him on the jet.
“Let’s get to work,” Tony says evenly.
“Don’t make me get Steve to tackle you.  You know he can do it faster than you can get to that window you are eyeing,” Tony states.  Peter freezes, because they all remember the training session when Peter got plastered by Steve when both weren’t paying attention.  Steve had apologized for months to the point Peter rabbited out of a room when he saw Steve coming so he didn’t have to hear apologies.  Tony had had to broker a peace deal at both parties’ request.
“This,” Tony says, “is quite literally one of the worst conversations I have ever been in.  And I have to deal with crazy models.”
He smiles at the look on her face in the final piece.  Fierce, fearless. He misses her, but it hurts less these days.  A dull ache instead of a sharp pain he used to push down every morning.
“Really?” Tony replies as he continues to work on a gauntlet.
This is hell, so this illusion is going to break soon.  Something is going to go sideways.
Shuri reads it in his eyes, Peter in his stance, and he loathes himself for a moment for making these children carry his pain with them.  Making them grow up a second sooner because of his own problems.  It’s nothing new - nothing unfamiliar, but he counts his breaths before letting the thought go.
"Tony, you weren't imaging multiple scenarios where I didn't come back whole, were you?" Rhodey's voice...all Tony can remember is the time when he called Rhodey after the whole Obie situation was over. The tone is the same as when Tony had said, Obie was the one who had me kidnapped and then I killed him and he had said, Tony, it's me. It's okay. You had to. If it's ever you versus anyone, I need you to make it out, okay?
Bruce takes in a deep, steadying breath before he stands.  Quiet in his perusal of the room, takes a few steps until he is standing behind the chair he had been sitting in moments ago.  Tony, nervous for more reasons than he can even think of, grabs his phone to have something in his hands.
Later, he’ll feel.)
Always.  You too.
Dr. Perez is awesome! He has this project he is working on to be able to create a robotic prosthetics that works with a microchip to allow people to walk again after losing a limb.
“What’s this Fry?  You monitoring me?”
They take a self driving pod that flies to Steve’s place in the city.  It gleams in a minimalist and white way; something that looks like the tower back in the day.  Steve’s modest about the place, quiet even as he shows Tony around before they settle in the kitchen.
“Why?” Tony asks.  Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Steve stop drawing, but watching them both.
Tony takes it all in, remembering the mind control and the way Hawkeye had been in and out of the tower as it rebuilt, always close to Natasha’s side.  He had initially thought it was for familiarity until he noticed that Natasha always kept her bites on her, even when in casual clothes. Then he looked in Hawkeye’s eyes and had seen Clint, miserable, unable to trust himself and constantly asking, hesitantly, if
So he tucks his head down and goes to work in the compound, all the whole searching, taking leaves to follow up one more lead.
Tony blinks and tries to focus on the field and everyone, and not the churning power under his skin that he can feel is drying up.
"Thank you," Steve says, still looking at his hands. He stands and moves to leave the room.
Steve laughs and laughs and pulls him closer.  “I know you well enough to know you won’t like it.”
“You don’t need me Reed,” Tony mutters, low enough the less enhanced in the audience can’t hear it.  Logan, well Tony knows not to try to get around him if he wants to listen. “The more I am around, the harder it will be to get anyone on your side.  You need me gone. It’ll be fine. I just need to work separate for a while.”
“Can we be open and honest?” Steve asks.  He stands there in grey sweatpants, hair wet and long enough to curl around the edges, and at one point, Tony would tease him about that.  He doesn’t have that right any more.
He has nothing else.
Rhodey is calm, a lighthouse in a churning storm. Always has been and always will be. "Who knew what?"
Tony turns his gaze to the table. “I’m the one who keeps fucking up, so it’s more for me than them.”. He laughs.  It’s sharp and short.  “Stark Accords.”
Howard squeezes him again before stepping back.  His eyes are dark and serious, and this is the man Vanko had spoken about.  The ruthless businessman the generals had always spoken fondly about. “I’ll take care of it.”
Aunt Peg would shake me if she could.  Her ghost is probably bitching me out right now.
“You continue to make needless modifications to the prosthetic,” Shuri scolds him, and Tony laughs.
“I consider you a friend,” T’Challa says softly.  “I do not have many people in my life who see me as an equal.  I believe we could be great friends.”
Watch your feet.  You have a tendency to forget about the ground when you are in the air and leave your legs wide open to an attack.
“Be safe,” Tony says instead of continuing the discussion.
Natasha had been laughing with Bruce from their seats at the end of the conference table as they discussed travels in India. Hers had been highly edited, but Bruce hadn't seemed to care that day. There had been something there in both their faces, just a second of something that Tony sees now, and he mourns the loss for both of them. The steadiness and comfort they had wanted for a long time.
Steve squeezes Tony’s hands, “It’s okay.  I’m willing to stick around and convince you.”
It's a familiar sort of noise, and Steve grins to his painting, finally planted on solid ground again.
“Captain America is alive,” Coulson croaks out, and he looks like he is about to have a fanboy level of a heart attack or pass out like a character in a black and white film.  Tony wishes Agent Agent was alive so he could rub this in his face after everything.
I hate you for asking me
the kids are crazy.  We don’t do buts anymore.”
Neither move in the stand off, and Tony half knows how this conversation will go.
Steve is back for a week before he begins to look edgy without anything to do.  It's not like it used to be, and Tony almost feels like Steve's prepping to run out on a mission again, chase a ghost.  But there aren't any leads right now, and Wanda needs Steve's calm patience to balance out Natasha's relentless pace.
She places the gun down on the table.  “Why are you,” Peggy’s face twists with distaste. “Time traveling?”
He watches Tony turn, blinking stray thoughts away so he can pay attention.  "Hey," Tony responds, wary like he always sounds at the beginning of a conversation these days.
Steve grabs his hand and pulls the warped metal from him, but it’s too late, and he laughs and laugh as he slumps against Steve.  He’s going home now.
“How about a burger instead?” Steve asks.
She settled as the room filled, and watched as Tony entertained. His low mood forgotten by all except her. Once they settled in, popcorn bowls passed around and movie beginning, she caught his eye and smiled. He returned it back.
When they show Widow, she’s a blur of red and black.  She’s not in her suit, simple red top, jeans and boots, but just as deadly.  She has her thighs around the head of a sniper, the bomber is already handcuffed to a car door, vest missing.  The man collapses underneath her, and she drops from him, lands on a caricature of a handstand before springing into a standing position.  She puts hands to her ear, makes a face, and Falcon drops in and grabs her around the waist and keeps moving.
Tony hums as a stuttering college kid begins his presentation again about the project estimation system he is building for the effort planning group.  He explains the macros in the excel sheet in a bit too much detail, but the contingent from that department has wide smiles.  Those guys always lived in excel.
“Okay,” he relents.  “Okay Uncle Daniel.” He slumps a little in his grip and hopes for a moment that he will actually fix it.  That all his childhood faith will stick with him for a few more moments.
But Tony can’t focus.  His mind is still scattered. It’s all coming together piece by piece, the memories, the lack of data. There is one clear shot haunting him - it’s Peggy’s face, terrified of him as he said a simple hello in the midst of something that had felt like the a memory. Maybe it wasn’t.  Maybe it never was.
"That's fast work for a month since I got out of recovery Tony," Rhodey muses after a moment.
We’re okay Tony. I know it looks like we’re not but we’re okay.
don’t worry kid.  we add like five billion new rules every year.
He thinks about discussions, the way Tony has always reached out and clapped him on the shoulder, always knew his favorites at restaurants. He thinks about the way his throat would close up sometimes as he watched Tony talk, but Tony would carry the conversation onwards in a one sided manner after a steady look for a long moment. Like he knew Steve couldn't push anything real past his lips
“You are missing part of your tribute,” it says, and it sounds like music when the being speaks. And something in Tony knows the siren’s song for what it is and keeps him rooted to his spot.
"I'm sorry Tony," Steve murmurs and they continue with their descent.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Uh,” Tony stutters, feeling out of his depth.  “We’re going to need the hellcat who took your eye and saved the world in about,” he looks around the room.  “When are we? Oh no matter. On May 15th 2019. We need all the back up we can get. Thanos is here and trying to court Death -”
“Snipers eyes,” Clint utters softly, like he knows he just shifted Steve’s entire world. He watches the scene in front of them as Natasha, without looking up from the tablet, says something and both Bruce and Tony stop in shock before Tony starts squawking loudly, and Bruce presses her to elaborate.
"Or maybe not sleeping at all," Rhodey adds, wonder in his voice. "Buddy, you have to get some sleep."
He turns the comms off, leaves the tracking program running and the camera's trailing the car to the airfield, but he turns, already sketching ideas in the air to FRIDAY who begins to shape them into something that looks like an in ear comms system, rattling off facts about what's on the market.
(He wouldn’t believe her.)
T’Challa grasps the suitcase and settles in a position that is a mirror of the one Tony has.  “Why the sudden visit, my friend?” he queries.
She steps away and holds his face in her hands.  “Oh darling,” she whispers. “How I’ve prayed for you.”
Tony was always part of the plan, but Wanda looks at Steve's blank mask and sees in a way she shouldn't. Then Strange appears in a portal out of no where, with the rest of the Tony's group from the earlier fight.
Forcing air out through her nose, evening it out, she lets that regret fall away. She can’t hold them in. Natasha would drown in them if she did.
Peter's have been bleeding this entire time, and Tony is grieved to know he missed it.
Tony can't wait as Rhodey contemplates him and the question. He grabs the washcloth and begins scrubbing down the counter. There is a knick in the quartz from when Natasha slammed a knife to keep Bruce from stealing vegetables as she made salsa, eyes smiling enough to match Bruce's actual one on his face. He turns and flips the dish washer on, running his fingers across the ding in the door from when Thor bumped into it.
There is a science behind breaking a person, he knows. Tony’s attended lectures, watched Ted Talks, read medical journals on the subject after the first time Steve left. It’s an art - stripping someone down down until they are something else all together. Nothing Hydra did, from what Tony knows, would be considered an elegant a solution as what he would have done. Hydra threw everything including the kitchen sink at breaking the strongest man Steve Rogers knows, destroying a man and then trying to duct tape and chewing gum him back together. And then they had to repeat the process because Bucky Barnes was
The look of wonder on Bruce’s face stays with Tony the rest of the night, even when his smile doesn’t.
The next time he peeks around Thor, Tony is gone.
He wonders, watching Tony over the rim of his glasses, blurry around the edges, if this is
"Being a friend isn't a challenge," Jarvis says. "You simply are."
Tony shrugs.  “Nah, JARVIS makes the observations, and I just help him piece together correlations in the data.  He’s made all of you, since you guys are guests here once a month, part of his mother hen protocol.  That’s like 20% my fault.  Rhodey gets the rest of the fault, because he influenced J when he was just a baby AI.”
Tony snorts before tightening the screw on the treadmill prototype, of course it's Barnes.
He unscrews the lid and downs the whole thing before coming up for air. Vision is still staring at him when he looks back. "You're a reminder," Tony admits. He spreads his arms, indicating to the room at large. "Rhodey. Rhodey's been around for ages. And yes, the legs, those sting. But you're a reminder of everything."
Tony’s nostrils flair.  “Okay so I fucked that part up.  But look at me now, all grown up!  I’m working with a partner and FRIDAY runs simulations for everything, and we can’t act like Vision isn’t keeping an eye on my every move.”
Instead Natasha puts her left arm out and Tony smirks but doesn’t move.  Instead the Spider kid leans in closer on his right and glares the best he can in a mask.  The surprising thing is Shuri.  Steve remembers her as the self confident, joyful 16 year old, but in at 18, there’s more to her hint of steel as she stands there evaluating the scene.  She watches and waits just past Tony’s shoulder, taller than either of them. Natasha drops her hand.
Tony whose eyes are heavily lidded but open. A smile softly blossoms before he takes Steve’s hand in his and Steve helplessly smiles back.
“Where should I set up?” he asks T’Challa.
He takes in a breath before adding, “Because I really want to fuck you to make sure we’re both still here.”  It’s not the whole truth, but Tony’s not ready for that.  Not yet.
The Skrull’s smirk grows bigger.  “Don’t you know? We’ve already taken New York.  The rest of the planet will follow.” It squeezes harder, and Tony chokes for a moment.  “But you won’t be here to see it.”
From:
His emotions flash before fading away. He doesn't even pause in his performance.
He wonders, still, if she regreted him like Dad did, and how he stole her away from the life she loved.  She had played the piano a little when he was younger, but not much.
“We’re going to make this a home.”
Steve’s face softens into a small smile.  “Okay.”
Tony laughs for real that time, until he is bent in half and holding onto his knees gasping for hair.  He straightens after a while and utters, sincerely, “You are going to make it just fine in this era.”
Tony looks at it for a long time when he shares it. "How could you ever miss that I had fallen for you?" He laughs suddenly.
He glances at Tony a few times as he sips another cup of coffee.  Everything about Steve is bland like he knows Tony is buzzing apart, repeating,
“Or I could get to that other thing you were asking for earlier,” Steve replies softly before helping Tony wriggles out of the dirty underwear, using it to swipe up some of the mess. Tony feels useless, letting Steve take control, but there is an emptiness in his head that hasn’t been there in a while, pleasant without any errant thoughts rolling around.
However Rhodes just parts with a nod and a quick,
Bruce had studied the magenta being whose eyes were focused on the distant horizon. "I've read your profile.  You could check it out if you wanted to."
Thor’s hair is shorter, and he has new scars and a single eye.  There is a familiar weariness carved into his skin. “You all look to be handling it pretty well without me.”  He picks up the weapon that came flying out with him, an ax hammer thing. “And I was distracted by my planet blowing up and Ragnarok.”
When the stone speaks again, it sounds like him at eight, voice high pitched and overly enunciating the vowels,
T’Challa is studying him, and the urge to stand has Tony out of his seat in a moment.  “I don’t apologize for taking them in and helping with the escape,” the king says.
He looks up and sees Steve watching him, hand steadily continuing on with his sketch with only a portion of his attention.  “Anything I would be interested in?” He asks, tilting his head to the pad when he receives a blank look.
When Tony opens his eyes, he’s further in the past than he has been yet.  Peggy is sitting in an office, pen tucked behind an ear and studying reports.  It takes him a minute to place the room front the picture and his father’s scribbles on the back of them. It’s the LA office of the SSR.  Daniel Sousa’s office from the early 1950’s if he’s got it right
There is red swirling around Vision’s collapsed body, and her eyes blazing brighter with her power than he has ever seen.  It reminds him, actually, of the video of her after Pietro had fallen. The never ending scream and echo of power that erupted from her in waves.
He starts to realize that things are 3D printed more now instead of assembled.
The horror, as it dawns on Thanos in the weird slow motion world they are in, is worth it as he snaps his fingers.
“How fortunate,” T’Challa returns, drolly, almost as if is almost bored and has aliens at his door every day.  “That Wakanda is filled with warrior clans who will stand to defend their home when called.”
He carefully curls his fingers, palms still up until the suit curls back into the reactor he has stuck on his chest.  They all watch it, with varying degrees of interest and horror until he is left in his jeans and T-shirt. His tennis shoes are worn, and he looks out of place in the office.  Coulson and Fury’s faces twist a little at the perceived disrespect.
Steve has seen the way Tony looks at Rhodey, the way he looks at Pepper, at all of them, and knows, deep in his gut, that Clint is wrong.
(He deserves more. Deserves better than his best friend who took him into a fight and got him paralyzed, but Tony has never been able to get him to see it before, so he doesn't even try now.
," he cries.  "Steven, I thought we were friends!  You know I have a compulsive need to fix terrible technology."
He just wants to live in the now, for once.
Tony sighs.  “I should have known you would have noticed with your always planning Captain face, but yeah you’re right.”
Steve comes up and captures both of Tony’s hands.  “I don’t do drunk, remember?” he jokes, trying for humor, but Tony still isn’t looking at him.  “Hey,” he says.  “You asked for honesty, right?”
Leave me alone now.
That's not them - Tony and Howard.  Those are other people, and he needs to stop trying to rose color glasses this.
Tony hasn’t felt this ripped open in decades.
He’s trying to weaken them, Tony knows, and then pick them off when they are exhausted.  But Thanos doesn’t know them. Doesn’t know they don’t get tired. They can keep doing this all day.  This is
"Running away isn't a good look Cap," Clint chides. "I would know."
“What is he doing?” Wanda questions. “What has he been doing the entire time?”
“A home,” Tony shrugs. “For all of us. Even Bucky.”
It feels like a thousand steps backwards from those days he sat in Tony's lab, and the world is changing, but why can't he?
Steve's voice echoes through the comms oddly, and Tony scribbles a note to look into that.  "You'll tell me if you want to." On camera, Steve makes a run for it, and then leaps over the edge of a fence, easily clearing the barbed wire.
Tony ends up having to spend a week in Vienna to discuss the changes with the UN.  The ambassadors are interested in the changes, and in the wake of the news breaking that Zemo was the one to cause the attack, not the Winter Soldier, they are more than willing to listen to him.
But he doesn’t want to give Steve any sort of permanency in his life.  Not right now. Not where he is, clutching a tiny wrench and with Nat’s words still ringing in his head.  Obies’ have been there since before Afghanistan, casual in his small cutting remarks in a way Tony recognizes as calculated moves now.  (He doesn’t know which is worse. Knowing this or not.). And even thirty years later, when Tony catches Steve in Cap mode, mouth curled down and eyes sad, like he is disappointed in everything Tony chooses to be, he sometimes hears his father's disappointed tone in the distance.
“I know this is a bad position, but think of it this way, Kurdistan is a country that is not affiliated with the United Nations, so their movements within the country is perfectly legal.”
(Tony’s older now, had enough therapy, read enough to know that maybe his dad didn’t know how to be a father.  He remembers the brightest around his father's eyes and knows the books at the SI tells a story of up and down finances, and he has to wonder how he didn't know how much the company struggled when he was young.  One bad design after another.  A few bad investments.  A scandal or two.
Steve shakes his head. "She's known, you know," Tony continues. "She's known the entire time, because she knows what everyone knows. She knows because she let him know, and he's never breathed a word. She's waiting for him. Been waiting for him."
He stands up to walk away as Steve yells over his shoulder, “It’s just a shitty IPA that does nothing for you.”  Bucky flicks him off without looking back.
There is a distinct lack of buzz in the back of his mind, and it makes Tony nauseous if he thinks about it too hard.  The disconnection from everything, the way his suit reacts too slow - it’s frustrating, mortifying even, with how slow he’s allowed himself.  How reliant he is on the shiny tricks.
Tony listens and listens as the sun goes down, and the moon climbs across the night sky.  The light that filters in through the windows paints him pale, paler than usual.  He almost looks like a ghost.
Tony waves a hand in the air and settles back against Steve’s side, passing him the tablet.  Steve hums and taps around, probably working on the new logo he owes Pepper.  Peter bounds over the couch and takes a seat on the coffee table.  Tony’s long since given up on telling the kid to sit like a normal human being, so he just huffs a sigh.
“Good,” she voices.  “Have you been going to meetings?”  And Tony laughs, before she rolls her eyes.  “You at least have a sponsor?”
DO IT!
Steve's head snaps up from where he's testing the pace on the latest SI treadmill.  The Board loves that they are getting into fitness equipment.  Pepper just leveled a glance across the table at him.
“With bells on,” Fury replies, and Tony give his a grin that quickly turns to a grimace as he says, “I think I have to g-”
These stones, these gems, they aren’t final. They are magic and bound to rules and something. Wanda has said as much before, in the rare moments when she was willing to discuss her powers.
He is a footnote in Tony Stark’s story, a chapter at most, but he is not a volume, he does not hold anything more than a few words in the story of who Tony is. He is the villain of the week, if he grants himself anything. Nothing better than the Mandrian, someone who tried to kill Tony and failed.
"Don't sound so smug," Tony bites back as he ducks. He throws an arm out before an arrow strikes the bot and it blows up in his face. "Little close there Katniss."
(He says,
Tony shrugs, flips the phone from one hand to another.  “This is me happy,” he defends, feeling the rising anger in his tone.  He winces at the sound.  It’s sharp and rings hollow, enough that it feel obvious, like everyone knows.
Steve clamps down the thought, locks it away as he remembers the panic on Tony's face.
“You want to come to work?” Steve asks four months in in the middle of the morning, coffee at his elbow across from Tony.  He’s got a holo version of the news in front of him. Steve says it casually, like it doesn’t mean anything either way.
He’s good at that.  Being his own worst enemy.
"I don't," Tony starts before stopping like he can't find the words.  Steve holds himself very still.  Tony can always find the words.  More than Steve has ever been able to find in either of his lifetimes.
He makes his eyes meet Peter’s and holds them.  “My family, you see, has never been by blood.  It's always been based on whomever I've opened my heart to."
Tony smiles, a little fondly, at the other man.  They had spoken about his country during the long days working on the accords.  T’Challa had spoken about how Wakanda was not just some barbarians fighting each other for dominance.  There was honor is being a warrior, being part of a clan. And how the clans helped each other, lending a hand, an ecosystem working in near perfect harmony.  Building each other up, moving forward towards progress and peace.
, he doesn't say. But Tony hears it, like he hears all of the words Steve doesn't say and grips him tightly.
She glances over her shoulder to the lean man steadily covering them with fire.  “It’s a long family secret and a longer story, but you didn't exactly paradox everything with the time travel and spilling all your secrets to the old folks.  It’s just gave the rest of us enough time to prepare.” She levels him with a determined look, “You thought our family would take the warnings and do nothing?”
Almost there
Maybe Steve sits up, blanket slipping.  “Hey Tony,” he replies, soft, like he is welcoming an old friend, and they aren’t, they
you don’t want to know
But Bruce has been different.  He had been a friend.
so is Rhodey.
Tony opens his mouth and then shuts it for a moment. Steve can feel the brush begin to give under his hands so he sets it down. "It's pretty untested. It could tear us apart at an atomic level."
He sleeps less now.)
Steve can’t hear anything through the glass, but he can watch them in the gleaming room.  There isn’t a prototype anywhere, and Tony keeps speaking before looking to Shuri who keeps her head down and drawing another version.  They make quite a pair, the two of them, sitting together, yet not - working together, yet not.
Tony’s on edge, half out of his mind with pain, drifting as conversations go on around him.  He’s barely aware of he’s on the plane because he’s still reeling. Extremis is gone. There are Skrulls walking around in the skins of his friends.  Jessica Drew isn’t Jessica.
Re the shiny new Steve Rogers/Tony Stark tag.  I honestly didn't mean to go there until I hit 20K.  But the story feels like we are leaning there and I would rather be safe than sorry.
"Peter," he reaches out with his hand until he can tip the younger man's face upwards.  "You can't do anything to stop me from being there for you."
Peter comes barrelling in through an open window, takes one look at them, frozen on their way to a kiss, and yells, “Dads are making out in the living room again” before sprinting out of the room.
He holds his arms open, carefully choreographing his movement for a hug.  Tony steps into it, and he can feel Steve’s pull on his sweater, the tight grip.  He still smells like paint, like he did in the old days. Tony takes in a deep breath, nose buried in Steve’s neck and quiets his thoughts for a moment.  Doesn’t add weight to the moment, just exists in it.
He misses you.
The grin grows, and Tony can feel one growing on his own face in a strange echo as hope thumps heavily in his chest.  The other reaches out a hand, and says, “Want to cause some chaos Tony?”
Steve nods solemnly, “I know.”
Tony has to take a deep breath in, remembering that Rhodey can't walk without the exoskeleton - trying to ground himself in this moment.  He needs to sit here. Needs to watch. FRIDAY’s notes are getting sparse, and Tony needs to see the issues up close and personal, so he can fix it.
Natasha hadn’t wanted to admit it but Bruce leaving had been a wound to her as much as Tony.  Her steadily increasing mission time has been enough of a sign for even Tony to notice.  Thor had been gone, but he won’t have understood, and Sam was too new for Tony to even get beyond “hello”.
"Never," he promises.
Comments, kudos and bookmarks are love.   Thanks for reading and sorry this isn't a chapter, but I think it's something pretty neat!  :)
He's had a lot of practice.
FRIDAY counsels him to take deep breathes, and he bends until he has his head between his legs, no matter how much his ribs creak and protest. He stays there for a while, trying to count the beats between this breath and the next one. When Tony can actually count to four beats and feel his lungs inflate until they feel tight, he sits back up.
Ross is not happy about your amendments
He doesn't say thank you at the end, just mentions going to bed, and Steve smiles at him, a lopsided tiny thing.  "Sounds good Tony."
waves, one after another.  Tony still feels like a mess of emotions on a good day, so he wonders sometimes what Steve feels back, the few times he’s asked, hesitantly, “Can I?” before putting a hand on his chest.
“Don’t you
“Thanks is what he means,” Natasha rolls her eyes.  “He’s missing socialization.”
He sees himself with Peter and feels the swell of
"You deserve better than what I've done to myself," Clint replies evenly. "Tony deserves better than what I did to Nat."
“SHIELD had a version of the plans you filed with them. You’re building us a clubhouse?” Steve retorts.
"Ready sir."
I used to be.
That’s when he’s dropped - beacon still blaring in ear, and the rushing coldness making his teeth shiver as he
But he can’t.  Tony can’t do that.  Not now. Not here with the alarms screaming and the enemy at the gate.  Not with Thor’s eyes dark and staring into his soul if he closes his eyes even for a moment.
She crosses the distance on the dirt road between her and the young man when there is a crack of a shot as the boy blows up.  Wanda is a few feet away, eyes bright as she waves her hands in a desperate bid to control the flames.  They spiral into a column of fire, and Tony holds his breath, remembering Lagos.  She continues rotating the explosion until it burns itself out.  Nothing explodes.  No one is injured. The entire scene is over in five minutes.
She adds, just loudly enough for T’Challa, and by accident (or not) Tony, to hear, “You need to stop collecting broken men.”  She, then, smiles at Tony as she pronounces, “Not that he isn’t my favorite of them. He just needs some educating.”
The rings on her hand dig into the flesh of his arm.  He remembers Uncle Daniel being lowered into the ground, Peggy holding herself too straight as she clutched the United States flag in her arms.  Her family all around her.  Tony had stood across the sea of people and watched her from a distance.
Instead, Tony’s silent as he stares out the window as they sit on a balcony in the hospital’s rooftop garden before saying, “Sure.”)
She looks at him long and hard.  "I love you," she says, and something twists in his stomachs because he knows the steel in her eyes.
Rhodey sees the text from his perch at the bar, coffee mug in hand. "It's Nat," he says, voice even.
I trust them with my life.
Natasha catches it and is about to call him on it when Tony yells, "Let's get this show on the road Cap!"
Tony looks out the window at the second half of the statement. He can't lie to Rhodey. Can't do it.
She stands and goes to the drink cart before opening up the sniffles and pouring more scotch.  Tony glances back to Ana who is carefully taking this all in. Jarvis goes to Maria’s side and murmurs, “Madam, maybe you shouldn’t…”
he adds, higher pitched for a second before Steve chuckles as he makes his way back to the extraction location.  They debate about treadmills and stationary bikes before Steve finally admits that he's the one who broke the last three treadmills in the compound before he's given up and just started running outside.
Again.
“Spiderman has entered the building,” Friday announces, a little belatedly.
Another yell is in the air, and Thor somehow summons lightning inside the building to take down one of the water wielding robots and an electrical flavored one. Both burst.
There is an echoed like screaming that makes everyone still before the whole battlefield goes silent.  The air before Thanos ripples, like it is trying to stretch side to side, then up and down, before it cracks open, like a yawn, to show inky darkness behind it.
Team Cap busts out of the RAFT a month after Siberia while Tony is holding a press conference about the future of the Sokvoia Accords. Thaddeus Ross is at his side for the first twenty minutes before he stalks out. Tony grins and says, "He is already on the case, tracking down every vigilante who hasn't signed yet" to the twittering crowd. The door slams behind the secretary of state.
falls for
He looks down at his hands. "I'm sorry," he says to them. "For not saying anything, Siberia, all of it."
Tony smiles slightly.  “Okay your pantherness.  I’ll let you know when to set up our playdate.”
Natasha checks in on him, often. She's manipulating government aid, on the phone with Pepper, trying to make sure the right things go to the right places. That displaced children are taken care of, that the world keeps turning, even in the middle.
The man straightens. His suit is generic and a little worn around the edges. Tony has to keep his thoughts straight because his brown hair is windblown and the whole picture looks too familiar. "Ben Ulrich, Mr. Stark, Daily Bugle. Spiderman has been spotted wearing a new uniform that has some technological upgrades. It looks, frankly, like something out of your wheelhouse."
Death laughs and laughs before thrusting it’s scythe in the ground.  The land shudders as from one moment to the next it is gone. The unnatural silence continues for a moment more before a cheer begins to take up in the distance from the Wakandan warriors.  It edges into a chant as the superheroes, the Avengers, Tony realizes with a faint thought, no other adjective, just the Avengers, take stock of the other rest of the team members.
“I am too,” Tony admits, quietly.  “And that was before the whole performance earlier today.  I know what it looks like if we lose, and we can’t. But I don’t want to lose anyone.”  He smiles, a little weakly at Peter. “I asked this of you three years ago. You didn’t ask for this fight.  You didn’t know what you were getting into. A job doesn’t cover what I’m asking you to do here, so if something happens, and you need to go.  I want you too.” He tightens his grip on Peter. “You don’t end here kid. I need you for the next one, and the one after that. You don’t die here, okay?”
“Yes,” a higher pitched voice says from the foot of his bed. “But thankfully, I like getting to fix broken little white boys.”
It feels like something.  He’s not sure.
Steve thinks of the trees in Wakanda, how it felt to let the words loose into the world. How he had wondered if the wind could carry them all the way to where Tony was now. If he could know somehow.
when an alarm goes screaming.  Tony turns and that’s when he’s hit with a severed whale head.
on repeat.
“Don’t die,” Peter says.  “Amendment one is that if you do it, please don’t do it on Stark property because there is a lot of paperwork, and Tony doesn’t like paperwork.”
The camera follows him, and the suits too dark to see if he’s bleeding or not, but Steve’s face says it all.  His face screams pain as he moves until he is hidden behind the stall again. Wanda wraps the first sniper in metal before rushing in Steve’s direction.
"Boss. Colonel Rhodes is asking for you. He says you have to be doing something stupid. Should I patch him in?"
Tony's hands are shaking and all Steve can think of is the way his mother's had shook in those long nights, her fingers encircled around his wrist.
Thank you
They stay like that for a long moment, before Tony pulls back as he starts shaking as the tugging begins again, a soft reminder.
, but instead he turns back to Fury, “You got the date?  You’ll call her? She’ll be there?” Because he doesn’t want to see the heartbreak in her face when he replies,
He indulges every once in a while, of surrounding himself in the quiet steady crash of
Draft reply to 54985-466-8653
Someone coughs
Tony clears his throat and takes another swig from his flask.  “No.  I wasn’t - I’m not…  I
“Boss?” FRIDAY asks.
Howard looks up, briefly, at Tony and nods before turning back to his paper.  Tony removes the iron and quickly unplugs it.  He dunks the board in his water glass Mom had set aside for him before peeling back the paper.  The dark marks on the board aren’t as dark has he had expected, so he grabs the sharpie he had gathered from his father’s desk a few weeks previous and colors in the lines.
Steve remembers barely being able to breathe some days, how it felt like the world was darkening around the edges when he stood up. The way the humidity made it hard to exist sometimes.  The way his mother had looked at him, so worried.  The way Bucky had looked at him, like he was holding his breath until he saw Steve take in another one.
Tony shrugs, eyes listing down. “We don’t kiss usually,” he states. “We actually kind of avoid doing that.”
Tony gives him a wan smile. "I'm not the popular one these days."  They've talked about Ultron a little, but Tony can still see the look in Wanda's eyes.  The pile of bodies.  His mistakes haunting his every step, even years later.
Water crests over the edge, and it gets on his reactor.  He shakes and shudders, and the hands on him pull back.  His vision is blurry as they hand him back his battery and hustle him back to the room.
Steve pauses and looks at Tony, really looks. Tries to see if there is a hint of anything in Tony's eyes. But he's just standing there, waiting.
“Leave Steve out of this,” Howard had roared, nearly shaking with rage.
an’t tiny Steve hide a single emotion in his entire body?  He understands why Barnes followed him to the end of Siberia. “I’ll go back to the barracks.  I was just wanting to ask about the procedure for tomorrow.”
Reed holds his gaze for a long moment before saying, “Okay.  But the second you take out the three Skrulls down there, you head back to New York and help us finish this.”
"You can love people in different ways," Tony shrugs. "I love her, but…"
“At least tell me SI is still on top,” Tony says.  “I’ll die if my succession plan was all for shit.”
Tony pauses for a long moment before he adds, “The fact that your body can betray you at any moment.”
“The moons and the stars,” he says faintly, and watches as her eyes brighten before narrowing.  She straightens, pulls out her gun and takes one of the enemy soldiers out who broke through the defensive line.
,” he sighs out loudly as he then puts them stylus portion on top to his palm and dangles them down to Bruce. Tony picks up a tablet and thumbs through the data FRIDAY relays from the suit in the last five times.  The length of time it took for the proximity alarm to register the pens, the display on the HUD in the suit (Spidey had decided he wanted projected trajectory and a countdown to impact in the lower right hand side of the screen), and how long until the man inside the suit actually reacted.
“Where is it?” Thanos shouts as he waves his arm, an orange arc of energy throws him and Thor back.
He’s a liability, has been since the electricity shorted out his brain, and he nearly shook apart. Tony’s trying to pull himself all together, but he’s barely got it back to the tenuous hold he’s been white knuckling the last few weeks.  He keeps forgetting things, his mind drifting at inopportune times. It’s like he’s just woken up, brain blank.
“What was Steve like before I came here?
“No,” Howard replies, after a long pause.  “I haven’t been home in a while.”
Tony tilts his head back to her.  “You always need someone to make sure you’re not becoming a supervillian.”
Steve lives in the middle of that day dream sometimes, wraps himself in what could have been, if he had opened his mouth weeks, months, years ago and said the words he told the trees.
He gets comfortable (in the routines, in looking for Steve and finding him looking at him already, in so many small things) over the months that slowly down the line, and then gets uncomfortable with that.
She turns to Steve and adds, *Thanks for the coffee and keeping me company while I was waiting for Tony."
Thank you everyone for reading this so far.  Comments, kudos and bookmarks are love.
He waits for a moment, thinks of honesty and the careful way everyone had always looked to Howard and Maria when they had called Tony
Both times were within the initial ranges they had tested, briefly, back before Germany.  The system hadn’t slowed down yet.  He selects the tab about the version 2 of the suit schematics and double taps before putting the tablet back down.
They stumble across each other a lot, their own routines intersecting until they settle into this thing where Tony will stroll into the kitchen for dinner on the days Steve isn't on a mission.  Steve will cook for them both, and they will chat about their days, new ideas Tony has had, just little things.
Tony takes a breath, lungs expanding until it hurts, holds it in for a moment longer than he should before letting it out in a rush. “You don’t need to babysit me.”
Tony smiles as he looks around the room and sees the detailed moments of Iron Man suits of old captured, the planes of the different marks.  The figures of Pepper, Happy, Peter and MJ standing side by side, caught in time before the Civil War. Hawkeye and Bobby are side by side on one side of the room.
They take a side door that leads them down a hallway until they reach a large lab.  There are a few people in the room, but at T’Challa’s nod, they quickly finish up what they are doing before wandering away.
Below all of that, the SI logo dimly glows.   Tony reaches out to touch it but pulls back at the last second.
Bruce hides his smile behind his hand.
“Tony,” Steve says.
Steve had, has, and he feels himself flayed open. Tony is still working and Steve hopes he is tuning this all out, but Tony is never so focused he doesn't pay distant attention to his surroundings.
“But,” it says, with that secret smile that feels alien to see on his face.  “I’m more adaptable. And I’m only half a stone. Half a stone is a limited thing.  Only so much power before I disappear into nothing.”
Tony rolls his eyes.  “I can never hate Star Trek.”
Tony.
It still lays there, heavy in the air between them.  Like Steve is small again, and the weather is too warm, too humid and his heart is beating too hard to try and pump blood.
“I’m being honest with you,” Steve insists.  “Just ask, and I’ll confirm.”
“Well,” Tony says, and stands.  “It’s about time we fixed that thing.
Instead, he stays huddled in the back.  He is careful to keep his head down, eyes low as the others move around him.  People he used to call allies, friends even, are carefully studying him for long moments before looking elsewhere.  Tony’s used to the uneasy roll in his stomach. He accepted this long ago.
Tony shrugs, "We've got some road bumps coming up and are trying to strategize how to handle it." Steve looks at him concerned and Tony waves his hands, "It's the ebbs and flow of business.  Do too well and people try to target you.  We're pushing the timelines on publicizing some community projects we have been working on, announcing a new compliance subgroup, boring stuff."
Steve comes home to Tony taste testing a bolognese and leans against the kitchen wall.  When Tony looks up, Steve’s soft smile falls. “You looked,” Steve notes.
Rule Number One
“Captain!” Thor booms and pulls him into a hug.  Steve laughs, open and honest and relieved at the jubilant greeting.  Over Thor’s shoulder, his eyes meet Tony’s, and the laughter lines in the corner of his eyes, reminds Steve of the old times.  When he would ask outrageous questions and make incorrect assumptions about pop culture that he’s already read about to irk Tony into throwing up his hands and making him watch the movie or a version of the concert, and the rest of the Avengers in the tower would settle in together until it became an assumed thing they did every Thursday and Saturday night.
When he collects himself, Steve is ushered out of the room by a blank faced doctor who explains Tony was pulled out of the ice 6 months ago - frozen and unexpectedly breathing.  Extremis has been repairing his cellular levels over the last few months as they slowly defrosted him. He’s been the last six weeks in a coma until they had someone interface with  Extremis and program some wake up protocols.
Tony is startled at the flash of happiness that burns through him at the offer.  “I would like that.  I have few friends these days.”
"Go back to sleep," Tony whispers.  "I'll be here when you wake up."
Steve looks away, and Tony slings a hand over his shoulder pulling them together.  “See the best ideas are always the simplest, and the last week when we were talking about how things keep escalating how the world is more dangerous, how threats are more frequent...how our enemies are seemingly endless.  Well, Steve, that; a complex problem, but you had a pretty simple answer.”
“Okay
The sunlight from the open windows gleams off Vision on the unnatural way Tony has adjusted to over time. It took some time, after the relief and childish glee that it worked, that they were alive, wore off, but Tony adjusted.
he thinks.  “I’ve never liked the easy way.”
“Gotta check in no matter what,” Tony replies as he disengages the gauntlet mode.   The plain watch is left, the Hello from SI, UI booting up in the tiny screen.  “We play nice with others now, remember?”
“I love you too Aunt Peg,” he echoes the childhood rhyme faintly.  “More than the sun loves the moon.”
"Awww, is the star spangled man scared of his emotions?"
They had (Tony had and Bruce had trailed behind, poking holes in Tony’s theories) come up from the lab searching for Rhodey to beg (Tony, not Bruce) for snacks.  Vision has informed them “Colonel Rhodes is meeting with the brass to see about the future of his career with them” and that he could handle snacks.
Thanks honey bear.
“Boss,” FRIDAY calls.
Steve stops and turns to him.  “You know this is really good. This isn’t people just humoring you.  It’s been open for months. I heard they want another exhibit from you.”
Vision inclines his head.  “I will take this into account for future scenarios.”  He turns back to Bruce.  “It’s a pleasure to finally meet you Dr. Banner.  I have a few queries that hopefully you can resolve.”
Tony shakes his head again, this time a chuckle busts loose.  “I’ve had shitty dreams since I was 19.  How is this any different?”
Steve wakes up, once, twice, a million times, aching in a thousand ways and thinks,
Tony meets Bruce’s eyes, and very firmly nods.  “Yes. Yes I am. You even have the grey hairs to prove it.”
What he means to say is this: they slide into each other’s lives like Tony never went missing.
Tony shifts and catches Steve’s face, soft and slightly pink. “Yeah?”
"Yeah," Tony replies. His voice comes out weak and reedy. He clears his throat before continuing. "Pack up what you want. We all have rooms at the Tower. I can have movers come whenever you are ready."
If he is remembering it correctly, this was about when Tony had started on the first version of the nanobots.
It’s the third picture that shows Steve wandering around with a bewildered looking Winter Soldier who is missing an arm.  The fourth picture shows the Winter Soldier picking a flower, and every inch of Steve’s face overjoyed.  Tony leaves that one up.
The window is cold, Tony aches inside and out, and all he can see when he closes the eyelid of that grainy footage. But he smiles. "Yeah. Tell me Rhodey."
