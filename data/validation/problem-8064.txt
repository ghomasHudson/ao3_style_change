Armed with a fresh cup of coffee, Tony found himself outside the door to Steve’s bedroom. He was about to knock on the door when it opened suddenly, almost causing him to lose his balance, but he recovered quickly without spilling a single drop of precious coffee.
Tony sighed. “Yeah, it’s just a movie, don’t worry about it.”
“Yeah, well, you know.” Tony waved his hand vaguely at everything spread out on the table in front of him.
His lips were soft and pliant, and Tony lost himself in the gentle press of Steve’s lips against his own. It started tender, as if Steve wasn’t sure if Tony truly wanted this, and oh, he
before going poof?”
“Rough night?” Tony offered.
Thank you so much for reading! I'd love to hear what you thought of it :3c
“Ms. Potts called me, concerned about your well-being because you told her there was an intruder, and then hung up after there was a loud crash. She was about to call the police, but I assured her that the situation was under control.” Tony was really questioning Pepper’s definition of “lovely” as Coulson explained.
“Mmmm, it didn’t.”
“You drew this…” Steve quickly nodded at him, looking like he was about to overflow with giddiness. “This is incredible, Steve.”
Hoping to find something— absolutely anything— that he may have overlooked before, Tony started to sort through the newspapers again, combing over the articles carefully for any trace of something that might have been related to Steve. He’d honestly lost track of time when Steve surprised him by gently taking the paper out of his hand and setting it on the table.
But after the whole thing with the ice and then the sketchbooks, Tony was starting to want to just spend more with Steve. He knew it was probably a bit selfish of him, but he couldn’t help it. With every little bit that he learned about the man, Tony wanted to know more. And hey, maybe getting to know him could be a way to break the curse? Like some Dr. Phil emotional journey or something. At that point it probably wouldn’t hurt to try, at least.
“...he’s got one of those, too. Better than the worthless junk vets use. For all his whining that he’s ‘not that kind of doctor,’ Bruce helped with it.”
“Damn, now I want a burger. Do you know if there’s anywhere in this backwards ass town that sells them?”
“Yeah, I used to go on morning runs a lot, but it’s a little harder with all the snow.” Steve chuckled. Apparently Tony had said some of that out loud.
“Hm, you know what? I will, under one condition.” Tony locked eyes with Steve’s. “Join me?”
“Yeah, that’s her. It was always hard to get her to sit still long enough to do a decent portrait, but she let me do more after she got sick.” Steve’s voice was doing that faraway thing it did sometimes, but when Tony looked up at Steve, he didn’t have that lost look in his eyes. There was adoration there instead as the man smiled down at his mother on the paper.
. He had just started punching in the code again when he saw movement in his peripheral. He whipped around to face the large shadow at the end of the hallway, bumping into a bookshelf as he turned, jostling the contents of its shelves.
When Tony sat down at the table across from Steve, the man looked up and shot him a grin. “Did you clean my stuff? I found it in the study earlier.”
Tony whipped back around to face Steve. “
“Sitting room,” Tony huffed out, scrambling to reposition his hold on the trunk of the tree as they squeezed it through the doorway.
That seemed to have caught Steve off guard a bit, his eyes went a little wide and the red on his cheeks reached his ears now. “You don’t have to take your clothes off for this.”
Steve ignored his attempted interruption. “Everything you’ve done… you’ve given me back more than I could ever have imagined. I know you’re worried about me.” He swallowed thickly before continuing, obviously pushing down emotions threatening to spill over. “I’ll be able to manage.”
Tony sighed as he turned away from his project, motioning for JARVIS to turn his music down, and fully faced Orion where he practically had his adorable face plastered to the door, getting little kitty noseprints all over the glass.
“Jarvis, our butler, was always the one who put up a tree, but I went to boarding school, so most of the time I wasn’t there when he did it.” Wow, that sounded sad. Steve was definitely frowning now, and Tony thought it was endearing that the man seemed to be upset for him. “Don’t worry, Coulson swung by earlier and helped me pick out the tree. There was no way that was gonna fit on top of the Audi.”
“It’s… hard, isn’t it?” There was more emotion in Steve’s eyes than when he had slipped into his memories of loss earlier.
“He’s grown on me a bit,” Tony answered with an air of nonchalance that Steve knew now was fake.
“You’re the best,” he couldn’t help but smile fondly. Pepper always had his back.
After they finished with the clean up, Steve stopped Tony as they were about to part for the night at the bottom of the stairs. He shifted back and forth on his feet as he seemed to be looking for the right words.
It was just a chaste kiss, nothing like Tony was used to sharing, and it was better than he could have ever imagined. All traces of the frigid cold that had once surrounded Steve like an impenetrable shield were gone, and instead he was very faintly warm, not quite like a living body, but not quite as ghostly as he had felt before.
“He’s allergic to them. It’s quite tragic.”
“Sure you can, Cap.” Tony clapped his shoulder as he turned to leave the floor. “Well, looks like Barton’s already attached, so you might have to fight him for the cat.”
Then there was a hard crack against his head, and everything went black.
But he decided to just enjoy the moment and not question it. As Steve let himself lean into Tony, he thought he heard a tiny sigh of contentment come from the other man. His eyelids were drooping shut, and he looked like he was about to drift off to sleep at any moment now that he was wrapped up like a burrito in the blanket. Steve gently rested his head against the top of Tony’s and returned his focus back to whatever stupid movie was playing on TV.
He was rediscovering the things that he loved that he hadn’t had time for back during the war, and also discovering new things that he loved in the present. New… people who he loved, too. Steve was grateful that their cat had given him a reason to spend more time with Tony and see sides of him that were usually hidden under layers of self-preservation.
“Huh? My what?” He cocked his head questioningly at Steve, but then he realized what the man had meant. “Oh! Pepper. Oh, no. No, she’s not my girlfriend. I mean, she’s the most amazing woman I know, and I love her, but she’s one of my best friends. And my personal assistant, though I keep telling her that she should be CEO instead of me.”
“Did he... have a home before us?” Clint’s tone was uncharacteristically serious, his usual nonchalance nowhere to be found.
What a pair the two of them were. Steve’s memories could practically be something straight out of
, a loving family that had nothing but each other, meanwhile Tony’s childhood had everything
Well, wasn’t that just
Coulson, to his credit, looked very tired suddenly. “He’s telling the truth, Steve.”
Steve seems so at peace as he gazes out into the vastness of space. Tony would be lying if he said it isn’t the reason he’s been able to keep his calm in the face of certain death (it
“What about me, Cap?”
He grumbled and tried to free the sheets from Carol’s grasp, to no avail. “Are you just going to stand there and watch while I’m under attack, platypus?”
Before he could bask in whatever it was that had developed, curiosity overtook all other thoughts going through Tony’s mind, and he carefully reached for the sketchpad, trying to not wake Steve in the process. He quietly and delicately flipped through the pages, the first few were sketches of Dum-E and the other bots, and different pieces of equipment around the workshop… then it was just… pages and pages of Tony working, hair mused and face streaked with grease. Tony pouring over blueprints. Tony laughing. He wasn’t aware he could still smile like that after he and Pepper had broken up.
Rhodey quietly closed the door to Tony’s room before pulling over a nearby chair next to Tony’s bed and sitting in it. “So… what happened in there, Tones?”
For some reason, he actually scrambled after the guy, grabbing his coat from the hook by the door and jamming his feet into his shoes before following him outside. Steve led him through the snow-covered yard to the gate at the edge of the property line. Once they got to the gate itself, Steve turned around to face Tony with a smirk before he stepped backwards and vanished into thin air.
He stayed there for a moment, trying to remember how the hell he wound up there when it finally started coming back to him. Last night, an intruder… and heavy objects falling off a bookshelf... Okay, no, too much thinking with this bad of a headache and no caffeine. Tony slowly got up off the couch, feeling a bit like he just got off a Tilt-a-Whirl, and pulled the blanket around himself like a warm cocoon before shuffling towards the kitchen in search of coffee.
1954.”
“Big hulking shadow in the hallway? Can’t really say I’d want to be his neighbor,” Tony answered through a mouthful of food. “Is that the guy you mentioned steering clear of yesterd—“
“Hey Marley,” Tony called out to him as he entered the room. “Do you brood by the fire often? Is this a habit I just haven’t noticed?”
“I swear I didn’t do anything to him,” Tony filled the silence, raising his hands defensively.
to stop either, but he’d only admit that to himself.)
After half-heartedly making himself something for dinner, Tony retreated back to the guest room he was staying in and decided he should probably check in with Pepper and let her know he was still alive.
“Every thirteenth of December he shows up,” Coulson began explaining as Tony just stared at him, disbelieving. “When I first started working here, we still booked guests during those days, but with the number of complaints and the strain it put on him, it clearly wasn’t worth it, even for the holiday traffic. A few years ago I started blocking off the thirteenth through the twenty-fourth to give Mr. Rogers some privacy.”
“I’ve gotta tell Fury,” Tony headed towards the door, but he paused in front of it and whirled to face Steve again, stopping him with a hand on his chest.
At least he wouldn’t have to wander into town to get anything. The town looked like it had crawled out of a Hallmark movie where it was Christmas year round. It made Tony kinda twitchy just to drive through it. He certainly couldn’t imagine Howard here, but he might vaguely remember his mom mentioning it once or twice. Maria had been enamored with the idea of celebrating Christmas in a quaint town away from the bustle of the city, but Tony wasn’t sure if his parents had ever even stepped foot in this godforsaken town.
Before he can get a glimpse of the face of the man wrapped up in an American flag, Tony saw the face of the figure on the ground and stopped dead in his tracks. It was…
“At first it annoyed him, ya know, brought up bad memories, but he’s come to begrudgingly accept it.”
Eventually he couldn’t take the silence any longer. “Oh look, they used the photo of you from the hallway. Handsome.”
“You know, they say after you drift with someone, that you feel like there’s nothing to talk about,” he started. “But I think I deserve an explanation after… whatever the hell that was.”
There wasn’t anything to look over for S.I., so Tony wasted an indeterminate amount of time looking at cat memes to cheer himself up. He sent a few of his favorites to Rhodey, who replied with the classic “hang in there” motivational cat. Briefly, he considered calling his best friend, but thought better of it, not wanting to get all emotional on Rhodey. He’d save that call for tomorrow when he’d really need it.
Steve left the room without answering him, and a few moments later, Tony heard a door slam down the hallway. Well, that was probably enough of an answer for now.
“Oh, thank god.” Tony sighed in relief. “I was really about to do whatever the hell you wanted there.”
“Just some bare minimum Wikipedia browsing and maybe perusing some government files.” Tony lied, waving his hand dismissively. “This isn’t about me.”
“Steve, what the hell made you think this was a good idea?” Tony asked, covered in flour.
“Funny thing is, well, not really so funny, but my dad’s gone, too. Actually...” He stopped to scoff. “He was the one behind the wheel. There was uh… a car accident. Howard always acted like he was invincible, even more so after knocking back a bottle of scotch. They both died on impact.”
Considering how much Tony hated being told not to do things, Steve had basically just asked him to open up the case, pretty please. He gingerly lifted open the lid to the case, and in his peripheral he saw Steve halt to a stop.
“Are you hungry, angel?” Steve asked, even though the answer was obvious by the way the cat was pacing the kitchen.
Steve narrowed his eyes at the cat innocently eating what was probably his second or third meal of the day. “Because his Auntie Nat taught him how to lie.”
“There isn’t anything to solve. We tried before, and it didn’t work.” Rogers deflated a bit, his anger subsiding before he shuttered his emotions off entirely. “You should just leave.”
Rhodey laughed it off. “Man, just try not to get in too deep, alright? I worry about you.”
“What’s the big deal?” Steve scoffed incredulously at Tony. He closed the distance between them and quickly reached past him to close the case, but his hand just passed right through it.
Steve scrunched up his face at the last bit, obviously not feeling the imagery there. It was kinda adorable in that Steve sorta way, but Tony wasn’t about to let himself get distracted.
“Just don’t push yourself so hard. You’re not alone anymore, and I’ll be damned if we’re going anywhere.”
It was much easier to sort through the attic since Steve was actually able to touch the boxes and their contents, unlike the newspaper Coulson had brought them. Tony wasn’t sure what kind of small talk to make while they worked, so he took his chances and asked about Steve’s best friend.
What? This… nothing like this had ever happened. Tony would have remembered it, if not whatever destruction had been wrought upon the city, then definitely Steve’s Uncle Sam get-up.
“You’re a regular Sherlock Holmes, aren’t you?” Steve commented with a warm laugh that had Tony beaming in response.
Steve’s friendship and respect, but the man is too good to actually think any less of him if Tony’s feelings are unrequited. He likely wouldn’t say anything even if he felt differently; that’s the kind of person Steve is.
“Speaking of the future…” Steve’s expression changed, becoming more reserved, as if he were actually going to be cautious with his next words. Of course, because they couldn’t get through a single conversation without one of them ruining the mood, Steve’s next words were: “Why are you selling the inn? Surely you of all people don’t need the money.”
“Thanks,” Steve mumbled as he sat back down on the couch next to Tony.
“Not really.” The blond made that cute scrunchy face at Tony, and he had to physically resist the urge to pinch his cheeks or something. Tony flicked some flour at him instead, a light dusting of it stuck to Steve’s shirt.
“Really?” Steve gasped in mock surprise as he crossed the kitchen to the cat’s bowls. “Well, don’t worry, cutie pie, I’ve got your food right here.”
He leaned back against the pillows, heart sinking as the loss settled in. It didn’t feel like Steve was gone to whatever awful place he was cursed to while he wasn’t haunting the halls of the inn; it was more like he was completely
No, this wasn’t real.
Honestly, the whole thing couldn’t possibly be good for Tony’s health with all the pounding his heart kept doing around Steve. He felt like he was going to develop arrhythmia.
“It wasn’t in your file.” Natasha added.
, but they’re… us, in a way.”
Orion looked up at Tony as he continued to talk to him, slowly blinking as he appeared to actually be listening.
“You? Surely not.” Steve shot him a sly grin, and Tony felt his cheeks heat a little at that. Oh boy, this had the potential to be dangerous.
“It’s…” Tony started, with a tired sigh. “It’s a little frightening when something so small and… defenseless depends on you for safety.”
“Tony,” Pepper started. “I know you say you want to help him break whatever this— this curse is, but… are
He hoped the use of the man’s first name would help settle him somehow, and Tony saw the last of the wariness fade from his eyes as the determined glint he was used to seeing during training took over. Steve nodded back as the crew began the process of connecting their suits to the Jaeger.
is he here? The hell kind of unfinished business does he have? That’s usually their deal in stories.”
He wondered if the Hulk would like the cat, too.
“I mean, we pilot giant fucking robots to fight alien monsters that come through a portal at the bottom of the ocean, so. The existence of other universes? Not quite so far-fetched in the grand scheme of things.” And really, he’d be lying if he said the idea wasn’t a bit exciting.
A self-deprecating grimace twisted Steve’s handsome features. “I’ve been told they’re hallucinations. Likely brought on by the trauma of… piloting alone after Bucky was unconscious.”
Then there was a brilliant flash of light as a beam emanated from the armor’s chest and blew off the Winter Soldier’s arm, causing him to collapse to the ground.
She pretended to ponder it for a moment. “No, heels don’t go too well with cobblestone streets,” Pepper joked, a bit of mirth shining in her eyes.
“Yep, I believe that’s what I said.”
His steps faltered at the sound of his own voice.
“It… didn’t,” Pepper repeated, dully.
He noticed that Steve seemed a little hesitant, he hadn’t made any sort of movement like he was going to reach out for the sketchbook. “Have you tried touching them recently?”
He froze as he felt Steve stirring behind him, but Steve just pulled Tony closer to his body before he proceeded to bury his face between Tony’s shoulder blades. Huh. Captain America is a cuddler. Tony filed that tidbit of information away for future use.
“Well, he was kind of an asshole at first, but I think there might be some Casper in there under the scowl,” Tony explained, a bit of affection somehow finding its way into his voice at the thought of Steve.
“Tony.”
Tony rolled his eyes exaggeratedly. “Yeah, sorry. Next time you come back from the dead, I’ll try to remember to put some clothes o— oomph!” His sentence was cut off by Steve scooping him up out of the snow, hoisting him up with strong hands under his thighs.
...It took a minute for what Thor said to truly sink in. Apparently Clint caught it, too.
Tony couldn’t stand the silence any longer, so he poked at Steve again. “Hey, you gonna let me see what you’ve got there?”
And that was when another man walked soundlessly into the kitchen, scaring the shit out of Tony, which resulted in him choking a bit on his food. “Jesus, shit! I have a potential head injury, don’t startle me like that.” He noticed Coulson politely hiding a laugh with his hand.
There was a sharp series of knocks at the door that disrupted Tony’s thoughts, and he groaned and rolled over, pulling the sheets over his head in preparation for what he knew was coming next.
When they separated after a while, Steve murmured something about going to his room, so Tony went back to his own and immediately grabbed his phone to call Pepper. He worried about leaving Steve by himself after what had happened, but there was something important he had to take care of immediately.
It was like time had frozen as they stared at each other across the yard, both at a loss for words. A sudden gust of wind not so gently reminded Tony that he had ran outside without his coat on, so he slowly made his way back across the yard. Steve hadn’t so much as moved from his spot in the doorway, and Tony hesitantly reached out to him, overwhelmingly grateful when he found he could still touch him. Gently, Tony pulled the taller man down into a hug, whispering an apology as Steve buried his face in the crook of Tony’s neck.
He entered his code to get inside the workshop, and inside he found… Tony chatting away with Orion just like he did with his bots as the cat was stretched out across his table, watching as he worked on something small.
“I think I can manage,” Steve interrupted, giving Tony a challenging stare. He wasn’t sure why the man was getting quite so worked up about a little cat.
“Thought I’d find you here.” The man was leaning against the doorway, watching him.
Steve’s nervous shuffling caught Tony’s attention, and he realized he should probably say something at least.
Even despite the withdrawal of government support, Stark Industries continued to pour all its resources into the Jaeger Program. Tony refused to be standing at the end of the world without having done everything he possibly could have, though it took a few years to convince Marshal Fury that Tony himself should be the one piloting. Reluctant to let their best engineer put his life on the line, Fury had refused his repeated requests to join the Ranger program, but it seemed desperation had changed the man’s tune as fewer and fewer recruits were entering the program.
So close Tony could just… lean in to close the gap and kiss Steve.
“You’re here. It’s Christmas Day, and you’re
Steve peered at Tony over the top of the book he was holding and arched a questioning eyebrow at him. “You don’t know how to quit, do you, Stark?”
As Thor pushes the escape pod into Earth’s atmosphere, Tony turns to Steve and tries to will himself into ignoring that their godly teammate can probably hear their entire conversation now.
“Sooo,” Tony started, poking at the eggs on his plate. “If we’ve eliminated your death as the source of your lingering regrets, maybe there’s something else around here that we’ve missed.”
“I should have been in that unit with him.”
“What… what the
He tossed and turned as he attempted to find some sort of relatively comfortable way to lay as he stayed in bed way past the acceptable time at the Shatterdome. Tony had hardly slept at all that night, plagued by nightmares that weren’t his, of Kaiju coming through portals from
“The curse, I— I can’t fix this, Pepper. I’ve tried everything I can think of, and he’s still...” Tony trailed off.
“I prefer to give him his privacy,” was the innkeeper’s cryptic response as he walked out the front door.
That was when Tony interjected. “Steve, if he died in the war, that had to have been seventy years ago. All this time and you haven’t kept looking for a solution…?”
Coulson had the audacity to look amused. “That was Steve Rogers… the spirit who haunts the inn every year around Christmastime.”
The man nodded, though he seemed bashful about taking credit. Judging by the set-up, Tony supposed he hadn’t been imagining the whole flirting thing.
Thor just smiled at that.
They eventually parted, mostly because Tony still needed to breathe, unlike certain people who weren’t held back by humanly restraints like needing oxygen. The second he was able to catch his breath, he clung tightly to Steve, gripping onto the man’s arms as if he would disappear if Tony let go for even a moment. There wasn’t a clock nearby to check, but he knew midnight was drawing ever closer.
That afternoon, he and Clint teamed up to take their fluffy friend to get a check-up at a nearby vet and see if he was microchipped. Since they didn’t have a carrier or even a harness, Steve had to carry the cat the entire time, but to his surprise, he just settled in like he belonged there.
It was Steve’s turn to roll his eyes at Tony. “I finally came back from the dead only for my boyfriend to get hypothermia running out in the snow to kiss me.”
“Right, okay. I’m just gonna—“ Tony left the room before he said anything weirder than he already had.
complaints.” Tony raised an eyebrow at the last part.
keep a roof over our heads, so there wasn’t really much choice. Da died in the war.”
After a few hours, Tony finally had separated possible leads into a pile and began to look through the papers more closely for any articles that might hold a clue to the mystery of Steve’s death. He had narrowed it down to any papers printed during December in the year Steve had died and January of the following year. They made small talk while Tony gently flipped through the pages that had been “archived” in plastic protector sleeves that were probably purchased at the nearest scrapbooking store. Occasionally Steve made a comment here or there whenever something caught his eye. It was almost… pleasant, if not for how tedious it was and how Tony’s eyes were beginning to hurt after straining to read the faded text.
“You should be used to that, Stevie,” his best friend teased him.
Tony finally gave up and let go of the sheet, knowing he wasn’t going to win against Carol Danvers in any contest of strength or bullheaded-ness. “I’m not moping,” he muttered.
“It appears to have snuck in while Captain Rogers was entering the garage,” came JARVIS’ unbothered response.
It was quiet after that, and Tony didn’t attempt to make more conversation in case he shoved his other foot in his mouth. He returned his focus to the search and was about to chalk it up as a lost cause since they hadn’t found anything of note yet. There were boxes upon boxes of stuff that looked like it had maybe belonged to Steve’s aunt, and the rest looked like it belonged to the inn. They had yet to uncover anything that belonged to Steve himself, or anything that even related to him in any sort of personal way.
He thought back to the attic, remembering how Steve’s hand had gone straight through the case of his art supplies, and was hit with the overwhelming sense that maybe he’d been going about everything completely wrong.
“Hey, bud,” Tony reached out and gently poked the cat’s exposed (and extremely soft) belly in a halfhearted attempt to wake him up. “Naptime’s over.”
He chanced a look in Steve’s direction, and he had that damn pencil between his damn pouty lips again as he furrowed his brow and erased whatever line had offended him so deeply. How dare it not be as perfect as the man drawing it.
Steve burst out laughing at that. “And what makes you think so?”
That night, instead of hearing from Pepper again, Rhodey called him.
“You’ve never done this before, have you?” Steve mused, looking strangely fond at Tony considering his current state of… lack of clothing.
“What? No, don’t send him to this winter wonderland hellscape, Pepper. I swear I’m fine, scout’s honor.”
“No, but I do charge by the hour,” Tony smirked playfully.
dark bags under his eyes and his hair mussed and sticking up in ways that Tony was trying desperately to not find endearing. And there was an oppressive wave of exhaustion coming off of the way the man was holding himself.
“I fucked up,” Tony confessed as he slumped into a chair. Instead of commenting, Phil waited for him to continue.
Tony blinked against the sudden and harsh brightness of a sunny sky, and as things came into focus, he realized he was standing in the middle of a destroyed city street, dust and rubble and mangled cars making it look like some sort of… war zone. He took in his surroundings, and if he had to make a guess judging by what remained of the buildings, he’d say it was New York City. This couldn’t be the aftermath of a Kaiju attack; they’d never made it that far from the breach.
“Is that so...” Tony continued on. “You come down here for more than the bots?”
“But he never found out about the accident?”
As Phil was grabbing his own things to leave, Tony attempted to make small talk. “Why are you heading out so quickly? Hot date?”
Steve didn’t respond, but when he looked up at Tony, his eyes looked so lost and so
Steve watched silently from his spot by the door as Tony gently removed the cat’s collar to add the little orb attachment he had been working on. After it was secure, he put Orion’s collar back on him and started scratching the cat’s chin. He had a soft smile on his face, entirely unlike the one he wore for the press, and Steve couldn’t tear his eyes away.
“Natasha was right, I do like cats. But I honestly didn’t think you were going to keep the little guy.” Tony’s voice sounded distant, and the ‘I didn’t want to get attached in case’ was unspoken, but Steve could feel it. “Attachment isn’t something I deal with well, if you haven’t caught on by now, let alone when the attachment is to something… squishy.”
Did ghost clothes even get wrinkled? Or was he wearing stuff that existed in the real world? Cursed ghost physics were weird.
Steve scoots back in his seat and turns around to address Thor properly, and Tony has to bite back a whine at the loss of contact.
Thankfully, he was in the kitchen the next morning.
before clattering to the floor. The man was staring at him with a rather impressive deadpan, and Coulson was ignoring both of them with an even more impressive amount of professionalism.
Steve definitely couldn’t help the way he heart always sped up every time Tony said anything remotely possessive in regards to him, even if it was just a joke.
“He really is going to turn into Garfield,” Tony sighed and rolled his eyes. “JARVIS, start a feeding chart so this glutton doesn’t swindle every person in the tower with that face.”
Natasha chimed in, primly, but with a pointed stare in Tony’s direction, “I thought you liked cats.”
was that?!”
“Steve?” There wasn’t an answer that time, so Tony quickly knelt by Steve’s side, concern flooding his thoughts.
…had he really been that obvious?
“Pepper.”
It felt like the world around the two of them had slowed to a stop…
. This couldn’t be happening. He could have never believed that Steve would lie to him, that
And Tony missed this, missed Steve and how easy being around him used to be. Part of him hated how lately he constantly locked himself away in the workshop, but he had kinda committed to being an asshole about the cat, hadn’t he?
“You know I just can’t help myself,” Steve replied dryly as Bucky plopped down on the couch next to him and offered his hand out for Orion to sniff. Without hesitation, the cat uncurled himself from Steve’s side to investigate this New Person. There was a soft smile on Bucky’s face as the cat headbutted his hand, demanding to be pet, and Steve couldn’t help but feel the usual swell of happiness and relief at having his best friend back.
“Who knew cats made good insomnia buddies?” He commented as he reached out to Orion to scratch his chin. The cat leaned heavily into his hand and closed his eyes in contentment.
“What?”
“Okay, slow down.” She interrupted him. “What happened?”
Tony’s brain skidded to a halt. He honestly hadn’t thought of what to say if Steve brought up the fact that he had cleaned the cases and easel.  When it started moving again, he decided to attempt nonchalance. “Me? Nah, I wouldn’t know what to do with cleaning shit— had a butler growing up.”
There was a group of oddly dressed people worriedly gathered around a motionless figure in some sort of mechanical suit on the dusty street. Tony squinted as he took in their appearances; a man with a flowing cape, another man in a form-fitting suit that was a bit… patriotic and star-spangly, and a creature that looked like Frankenstein’s monster on steroids.
“Hm, maybe Coulson would know, he seems like the type. I’ll give him a call in a bit.”
Coulson didn’t answer, just smiled at Tony and gave a short wave as he got into his truck. “Good luck, Mr. Stark. I’d keep my distance if I were you.” He drove off without providing any further explanation.
“...of course he’s a cat. What the fuck else would he be?” Tony retorted, but Fury just gave him a dubious look.
seen that one.” He seemed to ponder something. “Most of it, at least. I might’ve fallen asleep before the ending, but it’s not like l didn’t already know how it’d end.”
He didn’t seem to know what to do with that. In front of him was the true Tony Stark, caught slightly off guard with his masks down, looking at Steve like he was some sort of puzzle he’d been trying to solve.
Pilots brought a lot into the drift with them; Tony wasn’t going to let whatever feelings he had developed for Rogers make him naively hopeful about the whole thing. They were going to see everything: the good, the bad, and the really fucking awful. There was no hiding from each other, and no point in attempting to either, as it would just make their connection unstable.
Tony tried to channel the confidence and nonchalance he had whenever he was charming a room of socialites, but somehow it was so much harder with just Steve. Throwing caution to the wind, he pulled his t-shirt off over his head and tossed it over the side of the couch.
Something wasn’t settling well with Tony, so he had to ask, “...Did Bucky know about this?”
Tony nodded. “Your mom, was she, uh…?”
Quietly, Tony slipped into the kitchen and was steadfastly trying to ignore Steve and the cat, but he didn’t manage to escape with his coffee before Steve greeted him, thankfully without passing any judgement for Tony clearly not having slept yet.
But Steve Rogers was a smartass and incredibly stubborn to the extent that he constantly gave Tony a run for his money in that regard. He was a dork who actually enjoyed the terribly cheesy movies Clint forced the team to watch, and sometimes he’d come down to draw in Tony’s workshop for god only knows what reason. Steve wasn’t anything like Tony had assumed from their confrontation on the helicarrier, and it was possible he might like him more than he did Captain America.
“Worth it, to be honest. Also, ‘boyfriend?’” Tony paused, pretending to mull it over. “I think I like the sound of that.”
And that just… really fucking sucked. Tony wished they could have met under different circumstances somehow. Maybe then they would have had a chance to be together.
“Is that a reference to something?”
“I feel like there’s some irony there.”
When Tony commented on how much Steve had been drawing lately, he’d replied wryly, “Trying to make up for lost time.”
Tony grabbed onto the blanket, hoping it would act as some sort of buffer so that he could actually touch Steve, and thankfully, unexplainable ghost physics were on his side in that moment. He pulled Steve against his chest, resting his cheek on top of the blanket pulled over Steve’s head. The iciness felt like it was seeping through the blanket, like that first morning when Steve walked through him, but a million times worse.
They stared at each other in silence for a moment before Steve moved like he was about to close the door without a word.
Tony was staring down those blue eyes that were so full of fury, like a gathering storm, when something seemed to snap in them. Tony barely had time to curse his own foolishness when the man surged forward, and Tony braced himself for whatever kind of punch was likely heading his way, only for an intense iciness to rush right through him instead, leaving him shivering and standing alone in the room with Coulson.
That’s the person Tony fell in love with.
“I feel like I should apologize for my hand in that,” Tony offered, heart sinking at the idea that he had somehow pushed Steve to that point.
Finally, Tony caught a glimpse of the worn book’s title. Oh, Steve was reading
“Well,” Steve got his laughter under control, and his brilliant grin was replaced by a teasing smile, though his face was tinged with red from laughing. “You gonna show me what you’ve got in mind?”
Once he was up, Tony noticed that Steve had apparently at some point taken off his pants and was only in his boxers and that sinfully tight t-shirt. Holy
“We’re the Avengers, honestly the math points to it being highly likely at some point.”
The silence returned after that.
Steve had already been fond of Tony. The man was not only his closest friend after waking up from the ice, but he was also his perfect partner on the field. Somehow though, hearing him talk about protecting the cat and the team endeared their resident genius to him even more.
ready for him to move on?”
He was about to walk up the snow-dusted front steps when the front door flew open and a very harried-looking man in a suit (almost as drab as the SUV) rushed out of the house as if he couldn’t get out of there fast enough. Tony watched as the man stumbled through the snow and seemed to shout out a jumbled mess of an apology as he realized who he had just darted past. Tony just raised an eyebrow at the chaos as the man leapt into his SUV and peeled down the driveway, stirring up a flurry of snow in his wake.
They took the elevator up to the communal floor, and Steve watched as the cat sniffed around the couch for a moment before climbing up on it to find a place to curl up. Steve made his way over to the kitchen to make some hot chocolate to warm himself up faster, and Tony happened to be in there getting some coffee.
“Oh, uh, I’m from Brooklyn.” There was a small smile on Steve’s face as he started to explain. “Ma and I hadta move out here to live with her sister when she got sick. I couldn’t manage to take care of her by myself
“Ready for the Vulcan mind meld?” Tony asked, wiggling his fingers at Rogers to try to ease the tension.
Quietly, he poked around the house until he found a cleaning rag and some furniture polish in the hall closet, then he headed up to the attic. Everything was the same as they’d left it when Steve had stormed out the day before.
And that was when it hit him like a ton of Kaiju shit.
“Uh, wow, okay. I’m hurt by that accusation, Steve. One, false. Two, what happened to all those nice things you were saying about me earlier? You think I’m the kind to
Tony set down his coffee on a nearby table and started to sort through the ornaments. Then, he grabbed one and suddenly tossed it at Steve, who thankfully was able to catch it, though it earned him a stern look from the ghost. For some reason, Tony found poking fun at Steve to be incredibly enjoyable.
“You don’t have to ask me; it’s my decision to make,” Tony started to argue with him, tears threatening to spill over. “Don’t start making decisions for m—“
As they separated, Steve leaned his forehead against Tony’s, still gently cupping his face with one hand. Tony tried to remember what words were.
Tony actually had to think about it. “...Probably not since I was a little kid. My parents weren’t really big on the whole Christmas thing. Usually it was just company parties and wining and dining clients and whatnot.”
Steve opened his mouth, about to say something, but in that moment, the Kaiju siren started blaring. The two men both froze for a split second, eyes going impossibly wide as they stared at each other before they launched into action.
“It’s not much…” Steve started after Tony had been quiet for a moment.
Tony’s heart plummeted.
“Oh!” He snapped his fingers as it suddenly dawned on him. “We haven’t checked out the attic yet. What if there’s something up there that’ll trigger something for you?”
On the last used page is a finished drawing; it was Tony, sound asleep on the couch, looking more peaceful than he had felt in years. The fondness was clear in the soft lines on the paper, and Tony’s heart felt like it was catching in his throat.
Nice Shoulders Guy from the Photograph looked up at Tony, beautiful blue eyes staring directly at him for a moment before he focused on his food, which was only kinda unnerving, really. “Why are you here? There aren’t supposed to be any guests after the twelfth.”
Steve started slamming the shield against the armor’s helmet, cracking it open and ripping it off. He raised the shield again, obviously winding up for the final blow. Tony raised his hands in self-defense, the unfamiliar red of his gauntlets a stark contrast to Steve’s blue uniform.
In his peripheral vision, there’s an extraordinarily bright flash of lights, and Tony breaks away from Steve’s kiss to reluctantly check it out. When the light dies down, there’s nothing but Norse god in the pod’s viewport.
Tony attempted to work on some stuff Pepper emailed him about, but he just couldn’t focus on any of it because his mind kept wandering. The thought of how horrible it must feel to be cut-off from something one loved like that. Imagining not being able to interact with Dum-E and the other bots, not being able to work on his cars or any of his work projects felt like… well, it felt like cutting apart his soul and losing a piece of himself. So yeah, Steve’s reaction was pretty reasonable after Tony had spent the day dwelling on it.
“You know what, that is one question that I’m okay with not having the answer to,” he replied, giving Steve a quick peck of a kiss.
Tony finally looked back to him. “What’s that dopey smile for?”
When they finally part, Steve pulls away just far enough to be able to look into Tony’s eyes again.
A couple days after walking in on Steve feeding the cat, Tony was deep in his thoughts in the workshop. He was trying to devise handholds on the suit that his less aerially-inclined teammates could use (and enemies couldn’t) for stability while getting a lift.
“Well, it’s a little hard to dismiss something you’ve experienced firsthand,” he said with a nonchalant shrug. “Besides, stranger things have happened.” Steve cocked his head curiously, and Tony had to bite his lip and try to ignore how much the action made the blond look like a golden retriever.
“What even are these supposedly horrid complaints anyway?” He asked after a moment.
Well, time to address the frozen wooly mammoth in the room.
“When I got here, he was running out the door looking like, well... like he’d seen a ghost,” Tony explained wryly. He heard Pepper sigh heavily on the other line.
“So Captain America is a smartass now? And sadistic, too.” Tony went on. “The American public will be heartbroken if they find out.”
“Why didn’t you just show me that to begin with?”
“You would know, Carebear,” Tony shot back, though the bite was missing from his voice.
“...who tragically fell through the ice after rescuing the children. Judging by the descriptions given by the children of the man who pulled them from the water, authorities believe the mysterious hero to be a Steven G. Rogers, who was reported missing three days later by his family. A body was never found to confirm the hero’s identity.”
The man had immediately caught Tony’s attention when he had been transferred from a Shatterdome that had been taken out of commission. Granted, Tony had heard of him well before then; he’d always kept up with the various Jaeger pilots across the world, their success rates, what equipment and tactics worked in battle and what didn’t. Steve Rogers had somehow managed to get his Jaeger back to shore after a particularly awful Kaiju battle that had left his copilot, James Barnes, unconscious when the beast had ripped through the conn-pod. Barnes lost his arm from the injuries, but as Tony had seen for years and years, it could have been so much worse. As it was, he could no longer pilot with Rogers, and the duo’s Jaeger had been decommissioned.
against the door and sighed heavily before giving up and turning away.
“Don’t mention it.” Tony brushed it off, even as he could feel his heart lodging itself in his throat.
“Might be hard, but I think you can probably stick to it,” commented Coulson, the corner of his mouth ticked up in a small smile. Tony groaned when the pun dawned on him. “It’s been a while since we’ve had a tree at the inn. I’ll go get the boxes of ornaments; they’re probably buried so deep in the attic it’d take you all day to find them yourself.”
“There’s other books?!” Steve repeated his question, his voice tinged with something that sounded like a mix of excitement and urgency.
Surprisingly, after that Natasha developed a habit of gently murmuring to the cat in Russian, and Steve briefly wondered if she was trying to teach him secret code words like how some people trained their dogs in foreign languages. There was also something terrifying about the way Natasha perched on the couch with the cat in her lap like some sort of movie villain, but Steve tried not to dwell on it.
He saved his work and flicked the monitors closed before awkwardly walking over to the side of the workshop where Steve was sitting with his sketchpad.
“This isn’t real, Tony.”
“They almost feel like… visions, sometimes. As if they’re of things that could have happened, or maybe have happened someplace else. Either way, they feel like memories that don’t belong to me, like seeing the lives of other people wearing my face.”
“Now that you’re here, actually, I was on my way out, too. I’ll show you to your room first, Mr. Stark.” He motioned for Tony to follow him back into the hallway and led him up the stairs, pointing out various rooms and tossing out tidbits of information about the history. Tony wasn’t really listening, but he did tune in when Coulson mentioned the pantry and fridge had been freshly stocked.
When they reached the gate at the property line, Steve took a step in front of Tony and turned to face him, mere inches away from the invisible boundary the curse had created. There was so much hope in his eyes, and Tony’s heart felt like it was going to pound straight out of his chest. Finally, he released Steve’s wrist, and the man took the final step backwards.
“Come on, it’s almost Christmas, and I’m pretty sure I can finally touch the cookie sheet now.”
The joyous scene in front of him was shattered by the chilling sound of metal clashing against metal, the happiness and warmth melted away as the clanging rang in his ears.
Steve shook his head. “Not that I can recall.”
“I hardly think they’ll deploy us after yesterday,” Steve countered as he opened the door, the blaring of the siren became impossibly louder as the noise from the hallway flooded into the room.
“Hate to break it to you, Rogers.” Tony grinned at the man before continuing. “But I love a good puzzle. There’s no way I’m leaving now.”
“What? There’s no way. That had to be at least like, five minutes, pushing seven probably.” There was a pause as something dawned on him. “You were timing me.”
“I’m not eating that one— he’s too cute.”
“No, it’s okay. I know I’m a stubborn ass, and I let my emotions get the best of me that day,” Steve waved it off easily, as if somehow reliving his death wasn’t that big of a deal. “Don’t blame yourself for it. It wasn’t nearly as bad as it can get.”
Tony began to summarize the main points of the article out loud. “A few days before this was printed there was an accident with two children on the lake out front, it sounds like they had fallen through the ice while playing on it. Thankfully, they were saved by an unidentified man…” His voice trailed off as he read the rest of the passage, and he cleared his throat before resuming.
“What?”
Then the heavy, metal door opened, and Tony was rooted to the spot, staring at an uncharacteristically disheveled Steve Rogers. He was a
“I’m sure you’d much rather be at home doing this with your girl,” he threw in at the end, looking away from Tony to instead fixate on an ornament that didn’t even need repositioning. Wait, what?
“Sure you are,” Steve teased him, but Tony could tell he was enjoying the attention from the was he was practically preening.
“Why aren’t you wearing shoes,” he said flatly. “Oh my god,
As he was about to round a corner into what appeared to be the kitchen, a man stepped into the room and Tony nearly jumped a foot in the air at the sudden entrance.
“Get your own, Wilson. He’s ours.” Tony added.
, haven’t you?” The archer added with a sly grin. “No more weird referring to the little guy like he’s some sort of object.”
Gently, Tony sat down on the bed next to him, leaving as much space between them as he could, trying to not crowd the other man on the narrow mattress. “What do you think they are?”
) launch themselves into space to look for him after such a massive explosion. Though maybe there’s a chance they would come looking for the supposed inhumans he had come to save...
Before Tony could even begin to parse what he had seen, a massive cloud of dust blew in, causing him to reflexively shield his eyes even though he knew it wasn’t real. There was so much more dust than there had been before. The buildings around him are suddenly much smaller, and it dawned on him that it looked like he was in some sort of wild west town. He was standing in what seemed to be the middle of the desert, dry earth crunching underneath his heavy boots as he took a few curious steps towards the closest building.
Tony looked at Steve and was met with the whirl of emotions flickering in his blue eyes. “Promise me you’ll try again before you leave?”
“J, how’d the cat get down here?”
Steve gave him an amused look. “Are you jealous of your own bot?”
Steve stared him straight in the eye, his blue gaze practically frozen over with contempt now. “More than you could ever know.”
shoulders, wow, he really had been tiny). After taking a moment to appreciate Steve’s bright smile in the photo, he turned back to Actual Steve, who was giving him a questioning look.
“But—“
One morning Tony had wearily trudged himself up to the common floor to get himself from coffee. He hadn’t even checked what time it was, but the light coming through the windows looked suspiciously like the sun rising. Of course, who else would be awake at this ungodly hour other than the good Captain getting ready for his morning run?
was released. “...Oh my
There was another harsh jolt, and an indistinct voice shouting about alignment again, but Tony wasn’t given a chance to focus on it as overwhelming anguish and betrayal threatened to drown out the rest of his senses. As he was trying to orient himself, suddenly he was grabbed from behind and lifted off his feet. Tony tried to gain control and break away using his boot thrusters (he definitely didn’t recall the drivesuits having
He put a bit of polish on the rag, careful to not use too much, thinking back to a time Jarvis had shown him when he was a kid. The dust was incredibly thick on the wooden cases, but after a few goes on each one, Tony had them looking almost good as new again. He used the other side of the rag to clean the cobwebs off the easel, and while he was working on it, he noticed that the screws needed a bit of oil. Recalling that he had noticed some in the hall closet while getting the rag, Tony went back and got it, applying just enough for the screws to turn smoothly again.
“So, what? Do I need to be looking for an exorcist instead of an appraiser? Natasha probably knows someone, actually.”
“How do you not get noticed being all… orange and everything? Still don’t know how you got past Cap that first day.”
He scratched the cat’s ears for a bit before he stood up and headed for the elevator… only for the cat to follow him inside like he knew exactly where he was going.
Well. The odds say they’re going to die here, so Tony is spending every moment he can memorizing Steve’s face.
When Tony woke up the next morning, his heart felt a bit heavier knowing it was almost the end. Or kind of the end, at least. The feeling of loss was already beginning to creep into his chest, so he quickly got out of bed and padded down the stairs to look for Steve.
“Bet I could do one better,” Tony challenged, work all but forgotten at this point.
Pepper sighed again. “Just keep me updated then. I’ll let you know if I find an appraiser brave enough to face this terrifying... ‘hot ghost.’”
After that, Steve couldn’t stop watching how Tony would interact with the cat. He didn’t think he was imagining that Tony was interacting more with Orion when the team was together. He noticed Tony giving the cat a little head pat here and there, or sometimes he’d find Tony feeding him, which had been really unexpected, honestly.
“So when was the last time you decorated a tree? The forties? Did they still use actual burning candles back then?” Tony asked jokingly as he handed another ornament to Steve carefully. The man didn’t get annoyed by Tony’s jokes as much anymore, instead just smiling at him exasperatedly, and it was doing funny things to Tony’s heart.
Steve gaped at Tony. “Wow… I never thought that was something that could ever happen.” There was an awed smile on the man’s face, but an underlying sadness in his eyes. Tony wondered if Steve had ever loved anyone… Sometimes he forgot that the person in front of him had died so young, deceived by the weariness with which he usually carried himself.
He had chased the rabbit.
Part of him was almost afraid to let go, but it seemed like Steve didn’t want him to either.
Tony slowly made his way down the stairs, brandishing the fireplace poker in front of him with one hand, his phone in the other with Pepper still on the line. He made it all the way to the security system in the dark hallway and hadn’t seen or heard anything else.
“Looks are just a bonus. Nice packaging. They don’t matter if you unwrap it and find a pile of shit inside.” He saw Steve laugh at that and couldn’t help but smile, too. “Anyway, I’ve seen the old photos. You may have hit a growth spurt, but it didn’t magically make you handsome overnight or something. That was already there.”
“Is knocking not a thing anymore?” Steve joked as he looked over his shoulder (oh god, his glorious, completely bare shoulder), and Tony thought he caught Steve smirking at him. To be fair, Tony was stopped dead in his tracks, probably with his mouth hanging open. He should close that, maybe. Or try to say something at least.
He had even found that he didn’t mind the little band of misfits outside of missions, too. In a more sentimental mood, Tony might even say they were close friends. Even the new kids Steve had recruited weren’t so bad; his miracuously not-so-dead best friend James Buchanan Barnes and a former pararescue airman by the name of Sam Wilson.
The following morning, Coulson stopped by with some boxes of archived newspapers from the town’s library, so Tony and Steve spent the day sorting through the papers and looking for anything remotely useful. Well, Tony sorted, and Steve supervised because his hand phased right through the first newspaper he tried to pick up.
Steve couldn’t help but tease him for earlier to lighten the mood a bit. “So, you call the cat ‘honeybuns?’”
He caught a glimpse of a bashful smile before Steve ducked to hide it, but he definitely couldn’t hide the blush that was spreading up his neck. Oooh, boy.
Steve took a step closer, and Tony’s back connected with the door as the man ducked his head closer. “You think?”
“What the
The space was small, even more so with the dozens and dozens of boxes towering along the sides of the attic. He noticed Steve was having to duck down to avoid smacking his head on the rafters, and it was honestly kind of cute. Lots of things that Steve did were cute, and it was starting to be a problem for Tony.
For a moment, he was almost self-conscious about the scars on his chest surrounding the arc reactor, and the damn reactor itself, but he knew there was no way in hell that Steve of all people would judge him for it. Too much all-American goodness and that stuff. And it wasn’t anything he hadn’t seen before, modesty was a thing of the past after SHIELD’s decontamination chamber.
There was another one of those armor suits like he had seen in the first of Steve’s memories, though this time the person inside appeared to be a dark-haired woman. He supposed that was a bit less jarring than seeing his own face. A glimpse at a wedding program in one of the guest’s hand made Tony freeze in place.
Steve had rolled his eyes at that one. “Witches don’t exist.”
They’re going to die here. Well, probably. The chances of any of their teammates being able to reach them are slim to none, even by Avengers standards. The team doesn’t even know Steve is alive, and honestly Tony doesn’t think they would (
“Ah, Mr. Stark.” The man greeted calmly, clearly not surprised by Tony’s presence at least. “Ms. Potts told me you’d be arriving sometime today.” He held out a hand for Tony to shake. “Phil Coulson, I’m the manager of the inn. It’s nice to meet you.”
But everyone knew that side of Rogers, the hero with the near perfect kill rate until that final mission several months ago. After the initial commotion at his arrival on base, not many people paid attention to the man behind that story, the one who had stepped foot out of that helicopter looking like he was carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.
“Your threats are hollow, Danvers,” Tony called out as the door clicked closed behind his friends. With a sigh, he untangled himself from the sheets and kicked them off to get up and make an attempt at looking like a somewhat presentable human, lest he face the wrath of Carol Danvers busting down his door again.
The man nodded silently at Coulson but hardly acknowledged Tony’s presence as he went about the kitchen, making himself a plate of food to eat. It was a bit difficult for Tony to tear his eyes away from the man, he was very err,
“I closed down the weapons division of the company, decided to focus on green energy and biotech— prosthetics, that kinda stuff, but we’re taking a massive hit for it. Much bigger than Pepper and I had calculated, so we’re trimming down any and all excess things to try to prevent layoffs. Ya know, liquidate anything unnecessary to help cushion the blow. For some reason, this is actually a Stark Industries property.”
Who… no, that was Barnes. Who the hell was the Winter Soldier?
After Tony falls quiet, Steve gently breaks the silence.
“Posed mostly nude for someone? Surprisingly, no, the opportunity has not presented itself before.” He shifted his weight back and forth, waiting for Steve to maybe tell him what to do with himself.
“Look, it was wrong of him to just leave you like that without any explanation, but sometimes he’s just not… great with people, or dealing with… things.” Tony raised his eyebrows as the former pilot started rambling a bit. “Stark, just go talk to him. He’s holed up in our room being all mopey, and you’re both being stubborn.”
Steve tried not to overthink Clint’s comment because it was just a joke, right?
“Don’t ‘Tony’ me with that look on your face. I can’t be held responsible for any promises I might make under pressure.”
“Alright,” Tony clapped his hands together and frowned when a puff of dust erupted from where he had already touched a few of the boxes. “I say we divide and conquer, you take the left side, and I’ll sort through what’s here on the right.”
He wondered if the others had any idea what Tony Stark was really like when his masks were down.
Wanting to no longer be the subject of conversation, Tony directed a question towards Steve. “Did you have anyone before…?” He trailed off, finding himself a bit uncomfortable with acknowledging Steve’s death the closer he became with the man.
“So when the clock strikes midnight on Christmas, do you just pull a Terminator and say
“Truly an honor,” Tony drawled sarcastically.
“The inn hasn’t shown any profit in the past several years due to a decline in visitors and a noticeable increase in…
Granted, that didn’t mean that Tony had managed to squash the tiny voice in the back of his head that reminded him that it didn’t matter. Over the years, he had developed a habit of defensively retreating into himself to avoid getting too attached because, eventually, everyone left Tony Stark. Really, the only exceptions to that were Rhodey and Pepper, and well… Pepper was still the CEO of his company and they were working on getting back to the whole “being friends” thing, but she hadn’t been able to handle his new superhero gig even after sticking around through some of the literal worst years of his life.
Time, that wasn’t something that they had much of. Tomorrow could very well be his last day with Steve… unless he came back to the inn the next year.
To that, Barnes rolled his eyes. “I know.”
love. It would have been nice if they’d both had experiences somewhere in the middle of those extremes… maybe there was something Tony could do about that this year, at least.
“—but you’re not going to get any real answers until you talk to Rogers about this,” he finished. Tony rolled his eyes and slumped further into bed.
Barnes.
He wasn’t exactly warm, but Steve no longer had the slight chill emanating from him like Tony had come to expect. He felt like he needed to pinch himself in case he was still dreaming, or maybe pinch Steve instead. The man furrowed his brow and looked annoyed when he did it.
“Pep could do way better than me anyway. I’m kind of a piping hot mess a lot of the time.” He shrugged.
“Barton, there’s like, hardly half an inch of snow.”
Tony couldn’t help but grumble about how convenient it was that Steve couldn’t help with the physical work of sorting through the hundreds of papers. His complaining got a small laugh out of Steve, though, so maybe it was worth it.
He went back to piddling around, waiting for Steve to be done with whatever the hell he was doing, and eventually Tony found himself in the study again. He had the feeling that he should really be doing something better with his time, so he settled in and started on a last ditch effort to find answers of any kind, even though he’d read any articles about Steve or his family enough times to have them memorized now.
What he had seen in the drift, the memories of him and Steve… it just couldn’t be them. He racked his mind all through the night, but he couldn’t remember meeting Steve before a few weeks ago when he arrived at the base. Though, it felt as if he had known the man for an entire lifetime.
Coulson shook his head as he finally sat down at the table with his breakfast, too. “Unfortunately, I don’t think I’d be capable of making this one up.”
“Currently, Orion is in the workshop with Sir.”
“I was your favorite?” He ignored the way he heart thudded in his chest. “Who do I have to challenge to win back the title?”
He murmured a thanks as Coulson left the room. For a moment, Tony just laid there on the couch, but then the chilly dampness of his wet socks became too much to ignore any longer. On his way to his room, Tony kicked his wet shoes off by the door and trudged up the stairs, frowning at the wetness around the ankles of his pants. Damn town and its damn North Pole weather. The second Tony had stepped out of the car, his feet had sank straight through like six inches of snow.
“Well, see, I’m not really a guest. Technically the owner, but hopefully not for much longer. Just gotta find an appraiser around here who won’t hightail it outta here at the first creak of a floorboard.” The guy had stopped shoveling food into his mouth, and his full attention was on Tony. Now it was definitely unnerving. “Normally there are people who take care of this stuff, but I think my PA is exacting revenge on me for accidentally almost subjecting her to an allergy attack.”
“Steve, no, you deserve so much more than just
“He’s not here year-round? What, is this some sort of Ghost of Christmas Past bullshit?”
When Rogers stepped into the conn-pod, he seemed a bit... nervous? There was tension in the way he was holding himself, and it looked like he was clenching his jaw hard enough to grind rocks into dust. Tony had thought they had both been anticipating this moment, but now a sliver of doubt was creeping into Tony’s mind at seeing his soon-to-be copilot looking apprehensive.
Hesitantly, Steve reached out and cradled Tony’s face in his hand, gently brushing his thumb over his cheek. When Tony looked back at him, tears were starting to form in those beautiful blue eyes.
“Steve, I swear to you, we will figure this out. I’ll keep looking for answers while you’re not here, and when you get back, we’ll figure it out.” The words were just pouring out of him, promises that Tony would do anything to keep. “Even if… even if we never figure it out, I’ll keep coming back to you. I’m not going to leave you here alone, I promise.”
Tony channeled his shock into pure determination to create his own Steve gingerbread man. Thankfully, they’d mixed up some yellow icing to use for the star-shaped cookies, so Tony carefully squeezed some onto a cookie, trying to replicate Steve’s swoopy hairstyle. He had just finished the gingerbread man’s pants when he felt Steve rest his chin on his shoulder to watch.
And that hit a little too close to the truth.
“My mother died, too. Shortly before Christmas,” Tony explained, a bit hesitant.
“He made quite a ruckus on his way out,” Coulson commented. Did everything he said have to sound so… weirdly contemplative? “Though, that tends to be how most of them leave,” he added with something of a chuckle.
Tony wasn’t entirely sure why he was sharing this bit of information with Steve, but it just felt like he needed to, like out of all of the people out there, he would understand. And he did.
“Anyway. I think I know how Fury lost his eye.”
Steve rolled his eyes again in fond exasperation, and Tony’s heart was pounding as they raced down the hallway together towards the command center.
“But… those two that were kissing. They might have been onto something there.”
Eventually, almost the entire team slowly found their way to the living room throughout the movies, as it seemed word of the tower’s newest resident spread.
Open mouth, insert foot.
He pushed forward and landed a massive glob of bright blue icing across Steve’s chin and bottom lip. Immediately, Steve let go of Tony and jolted a step backwards.
“...shit.” Clearly, his little demonstration had the opposite effect he had hoped for, and Steve slammed the door shut as Tony scrambled back up the porch steps.
“From what I’ve seen… I think they’re the ones who got it right.” There was color creeping up Steve’s neck and his cheeks, and Tony was mesmerized by it.
He was desperately clinging to Steve with everything he had, like if he held on tightly enough that the curse couldn’t take him. But darkness was slowly creeping into the edges of Tony’s consciousness, almost like he was falling asleep. Steve’s touches became more gentle as the drifting off became harder for Tony to resist…
The cat gave a “mrrr” in response as he easily hopped onto the table, taking the same spot he had the previous time, settling down to watch the bright screens as Tony worked on something for SI.
“You know, I’m just going to talk even more now if that’s the reward I get,” Tony playfully grins at him, and Steve’s eyes crinkle as he returns the smile.
. Of course he was a nerd, too.
“Do you think…?” He asked, searching Steve’s eyes like the answer would somehow be in their clear blue depths.
“Okay, yeah, leaky Kaiju, kinda gross, but anyway— the breach could be causing a ripple effect with nearby quantum universes, and that’s why your horribly close encounter triggered these memories, most likely from the proximity to the Kaiju so soon after it had crossed through the breach.”
He said it to reassure Rhodey, even though part of him already knew it was too late.
After cleaning up the mess he’d made while making his sandwich, Tony set the security system Coulson had shown him in the hallway. It was some archaic, store-bought system, and he couldn’t help but miss JARVIS as he punched the numbers into the worn out keypad.
“I’ll take it.”
“She’s terrifying in the best kind of way, but no, an exorcist is entirely unnecessary. I’ve got this.”
And that was when Tony finally emerged from his workshop and found them sprawled about the living room. He stopped dead in his tracks on the way to the kitchen when he spotted the orange ball of fluff curled up asleep on Bruce’s lap.
“Mm, nope. I definitely do not have a cat.” Tony gave him a puzzled look, as he leaned against the counter to watch Steve. “What makes you think I have a cat?”
After Tony had found Steve in that cryopod, he hadn’t wanted to let go. He would have been perfectly fine with holding onto Steve forever. Tony had brushed it off as making sure Steve didn’t fall because of his unsteady legs, but he wasn’t even sure which of them had truly needed the support to stay upright.
Tony could hear the cat “mrrr” in response as he darted to his food bowl ahead of Steve, and he had to choke back laughter at the scene. He wasn’t sure who was being cuter, but Steve was definitely giving Orion a run for his money in Tony’s opinion.
Tony noticed Steve tense for a moment, but it only lasted a moment before he nodded again. “Yeah, that’s fine.”
“Yeah, yeah. I’m a slave driver, I get it. No fun allowed.” Tony feigned annoyance at his bot while Steve burst into laughter at the whole scene. “I get no respect here, from my bots or from you.”
“Holy shit, Steve. I don’t really know much about art, but I can recognize skill when I see it.” The man ducked his head shyly at Tony’s praise, and god
The cat squirmed slightly in his arms while they rode up in the elevator, but Tony couldn’t really tell if he was actually asleep or just pretending to be so he could hitch a free ride. It was fine. He’d just drop the little guy off on the common floor and then maybe go take a nap of his own. There was a stiffness settled in his back, and he was starting to feel like hell after pulling all-nighters these days. Maybe he really was getting too old for this shit.
Oh, ho. Definitely not. “Gonna kick me out of my own house?”
“I don’t… have anything for you though… I couldn’t even manage to break the damn curse.” He carefully put the drawing down on the table, sensing he couldn’t keep down the negative feelings that were rising up. “I couldn’t even do
That night, Tony just couldn’t manage to fall asleep, tossing and turning until he finally gave up. With a huff, he threw back the blankets and fumbled his way out of bed, cursing when his bare feet touched the chilly wooden floor. He found socks that he’d carelessly left on the floor at some point and wiggled them on before he headed downstairs for a glass of water or something.
“It’s not your fault that people just didn’t care or notice, or whatever their fucking excuse was. Dumbasses, all of them. They have no clue what they missed.”
Tony gripped Steve’s hand back, thankful for at least being able to do that. “Can’t say I quite understand your reasoning, but yeah, sure.”
“Barnes, don’t sneak up on me until
“Well, alright. I suppose that’s as good a starting point as any.” His voice sounded way too loud in the silent study. “So, is there anything useful on these shelves? Some sort of Crossing Over for Dummies, or maybe a teenage diary full of your darkest secrets?”
Tony had to replay that last part a few times. “You’re about to disappear back into some frozen hell purgatory thing, and instead of trying to stop it, you just want to spend time with…
“That sure is a tree.” Steve’s eyes went wide when he entered the room finally.
“I’ve got some good news, Tony.” Her voice was way too chipper for this hour of the day. Thankfully, she took his incoherent garble as a response.
Ah, the cat.
“Are you planning on him being kidnapped?”
“Then why did he tell me otherwise?”
He’d been working on Jaegers for years, designing them, building them, getting them back in working order after pilots dragged his beautiful machines back from nasty encounters with Kaiju. Stark Industries had been on the forefront of the war against the Kaiju since the initial invasion, and were still in the thick of it now even with governments worldwide pulling their funding from the Jaeger Program and putting it towards building
“He’s a smart boy, he knows I’m talking to him.”
“Shut up, Rogers, we’re having a moment,” Tony’s voice was slightly muffled by his shoulder.
Tony could swear he heard a stifled snort as he wiped the liquid off his hand with a napkin he grabbed from nearby.
” Steve’s cheeks were turning a bright red as he understood what Tony meant. “Oh, that’s… not illegal anymore? That’s great.”
for Steve. He’d been alive all this time, and Tony had failed him.
your life? How do you feel about verb tenses?”
Tony fondly rolled his eyes at his friend, but he couldn’t help but respond with a crude joke about wanting the ghost to bust him, which earned a suffering groan from Rhodey.
Before Tony’s sleep-deprived brain could parse what Bruce had said, the door opened again, and Bruce left without another word. The cat wiggled down out of Tony’s arms to follow him, trotting behind the scientist with his tail straight in the air, leaving Tony alone with his thoughts.
While he and Steve were starting to argue about whatever the hell was going on, of course Clint showed up out of nowhere and started petting the cat and fussing over it. The cat was leaning into the archer’s hand and looking absolutely
“You would have been absolutely worth it.” He found that he truly meant it.
“I’ve seen you cook! I didn’t think you’d be this bad.” Steve hid a laugh with the back of his hand. “It’s not even that hard.”
“Alright,” with another sigh, Tony motioned for JARVIS to allow the cat in. The little guy beelined for Tony and began rubbing against his shins for attention then jumped up on the table to get a better look at what Tony was fiddling with. Quickly, Tony moved anything sharp away from Orion’s too curious paws just to be safe.
“Oh, I’m fairly certain those belong to Mr. Rogers.” Coulson gestured towards the rest of the house. “I’ve never asked him, but a few pieces of artwork around the house have his signature on them. They’re quite lovely, aren’t they?”
rough.”
“Well, it worked,” Steve chuckles. Tony can’t help but laugh too, even if the entire moment feels a bit surreal. Surely he’s just having some sort of near-death hallucination or something… though Steve still hasn’t moved away entirely.
“Yes, that will be all, Ms. Potts.” Before hanging up, he added, “Give Nat my regards.”
“If you knew they never found you, why didn’t you mention it?”
before), but the assailant used his momentum to slam him against a concrete beam, the impact knocking the air out of his lungs.
“Sure, come on in, Tony. Make yourself at home,” he drawled sarcastically, but Tony could see the hint of a smile hiding under Steve’s mock annoyance. Briefly, he wondered what it might take to get him to smile like he had in that photograph again.
“I have no idea, honestly.” He could feel his brain going into overdrive from the proximity to Tony. He was sharing a blanket. With Tony. Also, it just so happened to be Valentine’s Day.
Judging by the looks of it, the building was the town’s jailhouse, and it sounded like... someone was drunkenly singing
). A deep blush quickly spread across Steve’s cheeks, and his mouth fell open just the slightest. Then, Tony licked the icing off his thumb with what he hoped was a seductive look, and he was absolutely thrilled when he could
“Well, look who it is. Am I always—” Thor stops and takes in their current state. “Am I interrupting?”
gonna have trouble getting rid of
A call from Pepper woke Tony up much earlier than he planned to be awake considering the kind of night he’d had. He fumbled around on the bedside table, struggling to find his phone as the ringtone was making his head pound.
They managed to maneuver the tree through the hallway with little to no collateral damage (no one was going to miss that potted plant) and quickly set the tree in the awaiting stand in the corner of the sitting room. Coulson untied it and started fluffing out the branches, needles scattering across the wooden floor.
He brushed his hands off on his pajama pants, just in case there was anything on them, before he reached up and pulled one off the shelf, handling it with the utmost care since the sketchbooks were so old. The pages weren’t as yellowed as Tony had expected, so someone must have kept them in storage, maybe bringing them out whenever it was time for Steve to show up in December every year. Probably Coulson, Tony suspected.
Of course Steve has the magnanimity to
“This looks a lot like moping to me,” Carol joked as she gestured to Tony wrapped up in his bedsheets like a burrito, hair sticking out in random directions from rolling around for so many hours.
“Unfortunately, my name is on the deed, but not for long. I’m sure some developer would love a property like this. That stupid lake would be a great parking lot once it’s filled in.” Suddenly Tony was standing, too, and walking around the side of the table to stand toe to toe with Steve. He wasn’t quite sure why he was picking a fight like this, but it felt way more tempting than backing down.
“Okay, Marley. Yesterday’s little game of twenty questions wasn’t all that productive, so I think we should start researching your past a bit.”
Tony looked over to where Steve had been sitting while he drew, and the other man was nowhere to be seen, his sketchpad laying abandoned on the chair instead. It belatedly occurred to Tony that he wasn’t chilling anymore because a rather warm blanket had been tucked around him.
Sketchpad forgotten for the moment, Steve was outright beaming at him now, and Tony was finding it hard to even be jokingly irritated with that face.
Once Tony had changed out of his damp clothes, he gave himself a once-over in the mirror to make sure he’d gotten all the pine needles out of his hair— absolutely not because he wanted to look good in front of Steve. He picked out the last few stragglers and deemed himself presentable.
“Hey, Tones,” he started when Tony answered the phone, a hint of mischief in his voice. “Pepper told me you’ve got a bit of a Casper the Friendly Ghost situation going on. Do we need to call in the Ghostbusters?”
Tony after he left the man in space for five goddamn years while he tried to drown in his own self pity. It’s too much. He hadn’t even been
“All that worrying will make you age early, honeybear. You’ve seen what it’s done to Obama,” Tony tried to lighten the mood. “I’ll be fine.”
“Where’s his shirt?”
His self-consciousness seemed to kick back in after that, and he cleared his throat awkwardly, trying to look anywhere but at Steve. “Okay. Tony Stark Oversharing Hour is over.”
Steve had apparently decided it was his duty to retrieve Tony from the workshop whenever he was down there for an amount of time normal people deemed excessive. Of course, Tony gave into him every single time because he could never say no to Steve’s stupid beautiful blue eyes or his stupid honest face and the way he acted like he actually cared if Tony withered away from overworking himself.
“That’s a bit pot and kettle coming from the man who flew a nuke into a portal to space,” Steve added, his own voice coming out softer than he expected.
“We could test it.” Steve nodded in the general direction of the gate.
“Tony…” Steve started, his voice and gaze going soft. “This was very thoughtful of you. It’s been… a really long time since I’ve been able to do anything like this.”
Not for the first time, Tony wished he could reach out and touch the man in front of him.
Right. No ghosts, just eerily calm innkeepers. Tony shook his hand then gestured vaguely in the direction of the front door. “I think that was the appraiser I was supposed to be meeting.”
Oh, Steve. Beautiful Steve. Wait, why did he think Tony had a cat? He’d lived here for like a year already, hadn’t he? That was definitely something that would have come up in conversation within that time, probably.
“Poetic,” Steve said dryly.
Steve, who apparently had a talent for putting Tony at a loss for words, chimed in again. “To be honest, I don’t really have much of a personal connection to this place.” Tony couldn’t hold back a laugh at that, considering the man was literally tied to the inn through a curse. Steve gave him a small smile. “I mean it. All I did was help out my aunt around the place for the few years Ma and I lived here. It’s not like I grew up here or anything sentimental like that.”
As luck would have it, the elevator doors opened on Bruce’s floor, and the scientist raised his eyebrow in an unimpressed look at Tony.
“Oh no, I know that voice.” Rhodey let out a long-suffering sigh. “Am I going to be giving a dead man the shovel talk?”
Steve reached behind him to pull the blanket off the back of the couch and then stretched it out across them. Orion grumbled in discontent at being jostled during the process, but he quickly fell back asleep once Steve stopped moving. “I thought you had some sort of gala or fundraiser thing to go to tonight?”
And that, somehow, was the final straw for Steve.
“No, I’m just being respectful.” It was Tony’s turn to roll his eyes, but Steve noted it lacked his usual conviction. “Remind me again, why the fuck do we have a cat?”
Eventually, Tony felt Steve shift and lean away from him, so he let go. Steve peeked out from under the blanket, eyes locking onto Tony’s, and the emotion he found in them was overwhelming.
fair. Tony could feel his mind grinding to a halt. Was he
The next time Orion ventured downstairs to the workshop, JARVIS automatically opened the door for him and turned down the volume on Tony’s music. Dum-E beeped excitedly as he went to retrieve the cat toy Tony had given him to see if the bot would be able to play with Orion (for science, of course).
“Might’ve been.” Steve’s lips quirked as if he was holding back more laughter.
It felt like Tony was constantly coming across Steve being sickeningly cute with the cat. He was starting to run out of words to describe how goddamn cute it was to see 6-feet of super soldier all bent over and talking in a baby voice to a cat, having full conversations when no one else was around. And it was
“Thank you, JARVIS,” Steve answered before quickly heading down to Tony’s workshop to see what in the world could possibly be going on.
The man in the form-fitting suit caught Tony’s attention more than the others. He was knelt next to the man in the suit, clearly at a loss as to what he should do. His movements, his shoulders… the man reminded him so much of Steve that Tony started taking steps forward without even realizing it.
, Rogers? First Barnes and Wilson, and now a literal stray cat.”
She rolled her eyes at him and continued, placing a file of papers on his desk. “As I was saying, we’ve been working on trimming down assets to even out some of the losses from the big switch, but there’s one upstate I’ve been having issues with getting it sold. It’s an old inn located in some quiet town, overlooks a small lake, lots of snow this time of year.”
“I tried prying info from Coulson about it, but he won’t confirm. Just said ‘It’s classified. Director Fury had an encounter with a highly dangerous lifeform.’” Tony mocked Coulson’s tone perfectly and then nodded in Orion’s direction, which just made Steve laugh more.
...and then disappeared.
Without another word, Tony rushed out of the kitchen, coffee now forgotten, dragging Steve by the wrist. He managed to wiggle into his shoes without letting go of Steve but thought ‘screw it’ when he looked at his coat.
“Is this some sort of game to you?” He demanded, nostrils flaring and jaw clenched tightly enough that the sight of it made Tony’s teeth hurt.
Sometime that week, a really nice cat tree mysteriously appeared on the communal floor out of the blue, and Clint whined that he was a bit jealous.
And then there was a quick gesture drawing of the stupid pose Tony had attempted earlier. There wasn’t much detail to it; Steve had clearly had other things on his mind aside from capturing it on paper. There was even a damn time written down next to it. 2:47. Damn it, he really was being generous with the three minutes.
“Tony,” he starts again, scooting closer on the edge of his seat. He reaches up to hold Tony’s face as best as he can given the armor. His thumb gently caresses Tony’s cheek, wiping away a tear streak left behind. “I love you, too.”
There wasn’t a purple human-sized cat tower, but later that week Tony did give Clint some new arrows, including an improved boomerang arrow.
Clint had sounded over the moon.)
And then there was a harsh jolt and a flash of deep blues as a scream ripped through his head.
. Can you
“What about your family?” Steve asked him.
“You’ve got the whole country fooled with this wholesome image of yours. But I know the truth.” Tony punctuated his sentence with a half-hearted point in Steve’s direction. “You, are a little shit, Steve Rogers.”
When Tony saw Steve again that night, he very pointedly did not bring up what had happened at the gate earlier. Whatever it was that he was feeling right then, he’d bottled it up and wasn’t sharing a drop of it with Tony.
“Don’t sell yourself so short.” Steve’s smile was so
It was never any use trying to lie to Pepper. “A little,” he confessed with a sniffle. “I just… I thought we’d made a lot of progress, and we
“It might be a little too late for that,” he admitted, worrying his bottom lip with his teeth. He knew she was right, but there wasn’t a whole lot he could do about it now.
Dum-E quickly returned, cat toy in claw, and gently waved the fuzzy, jingly rope on a stick in Orion’s direction, beeping curiously as the cat’s attention immediately locked onto the toy. Orion leapt down off the table to start swatting at the toy as Dum-E kept it
as he spoke to the cat circling his ankles as he prepared food for the little fluffbutt. Orion’s eyes are huge and adorable as he watched Steve mix warm water into the food and mashed it all up (someone’s spoiled as fuck), and he kept meowing at the super soldier, who was making a conversation of it.
He could feel Steve move to get up, and he tried not to whine at the loss of contact and warmth once the other man was upright.
“Anyway… I wanna bake some cookies.” Steve gave Tony’s hand one last squeeze before letting go.
He could have sworn he heard Steve snort at him, but when Tony tried to make eye contact with him, Steve was already sketching away. The playful retort he had ready to fire at the other man died on his lips, and he diverted his attention to maintaining the, frankly, ridiculous pose he had put himself in.
“If you shut that in my face, I’ll just go get the Terminator to bust it down for me.” Quickly, Tony reached out to put a hand on the door, though he didn’t try to force it the rest of the way open. “I know what that arm is capable of, I made it.”
He woke up the next morning after tossing and turning all night feeling like utter shit with a splitting headache. He supposed he deserved it, though, so he shuffled down the stairs to the kitchen to drown his pain in coffee.
“How’d the meeting with the appraiser go?”
“The breach,” he breathed.
“Mm, Pepper woke me up for some business stuff.” Tony vaguely waved his hand through the air as he invited himself into the room.
He didn’t think Steve noticed the way Tony’s jaw dropped at that remark.
Well, that was definitely going on the list of things to interrogate Rogers about.
” Tony exclaimed, clutching his chest. “We’ve gotta put a bell on you or something.”
“This could entirely change how we should be going about trying to close the damned breach.” He hastily ran a hand through his hair. “We’ve been going about it the wrong way this whole time.”
He’d probably checked the clock a good fifteen times while getting ready, nervousness setting in knowing their time was almost out. Figuring it’d be fine to head down a few minutes early, Tony hustled down to the dining room, not wanting to waste another moment that he could spend with Steve.
There were about a million issues running through his mind at once, security issues and Steve slowly growing more irate with him, because really, Tony was too good at carelessly pushing the man’s buttons. Wondering if any of the emotionally-stunted misfits who lived with him were even capable of taking care of a small fluffy creature, or if this would become a regrettable one-off and they’d end up taking the poor thing to a shelter after he became fond of it.
It felt wrong to leave Steve’s belongings in the attic just to gather dust again, so Tony carefully brought them downstairs to the study, arranging the easel near the window.
“Coffee,” Steve grumbled, voice still tinged with sleep as he wiggled past Tony to get off the couch.
The last thing he could remember was kissing Steve in the dining room, and— oh… Steve. The man must have carried Tony up to his bedroom, and he tried not to dwell too long on the images that line of thought provided. He rubbed at his eyes wearily to chase away the last of the sleepiness, and then he saw the drawing from Steve laid neatly on his bedside table.
“I sure hope not.” Steve has the audacity to
And then Steve directed his attention to the living room couch, where there was a fluffy orange cat draped across the arm of the couch, looking incredibly comfortable and very much like it lived there.
The bot gave a sad beep as it rolled away from Steve to get back to work.
“I just didn’t think they’d be quite so… vivid in the drift,” Steve said apologetically, running a hand through his hair like it might be a nervous habit. “But I don’t know what I expected, some sort of epiphany maybe. It seems that we’re together in all of those other worlds, or whatever they are.”
Steve cuts him off again with another kiss, and Tony can feel his smile against his lips. Steve isn’t cold from his second stint as a Capsicle anymore, and he wishes he could rip off these damned gauntlets and touch Steve with his bare hands.
a sight on so many different levels.
Tony went to his room to freshen up, and he actually changed into some nicer clothes because why the hell not? He was pretty sure Steve had been flirting with him the past few days, and after the whole… Icing Incident, what was the harm in digging his own grave a little deeper?
His team had become a family right before his very eyes, but somehow he hadn’t even realized it until that moment.
half). Anyway, he felt like it said a lot about the kind of person Steve truly was that he refused to allow the system to abandon his friend after Barnes had given so much to the cause. But then again, the bond that Jaeger pilots shared… was something truly indescribable.
to stop doing that, it’s bad for my heart. Wait, you just said ‘it’s a curse’ and actually meant it.”
because the color made Steve’s clear blue eyes stand out in the most beautiful way.
Tony had been waiting for this moment for too long.
Around lunchtime, Tony tried to get into the kitchen, but Steve met him in the doorway, handed him a sandwich, and then turned him away. Not one to look a gift sandwich in the mouth (or crust, or… whatever), Tony ignored his curiosity to respect whatever Steve’s surprise was. The kitchen was clearly off-limits until further notice, as was the dining room that they never actually ate in.
Natasha leaned down and gave Orion a kiss on top of his head, and the cat closed his eyes in contentment as he leaned into her gentle touch. Steve heard her whisper, “We’re glad you found us.”
“Good morning, Mr. Stark, how are you feeling?” Coulson was in front of the stove, cooking some bacon that smelled mouth-wateringly delicious, and maybe some other food, too.
Eventually, they decided to call it quits for the evening, as apparently even ghosts have a regular appetite. Dinner started off as a quiet affair, each of them cooked their own food and didn’t really talk much as they sat across from one another at the table in the kitchen.
And because Pepper was a damn saint, she actually agreed to find a way to prolong the process.
“You’re up early,” Steve commented with a raised eyebrow. He was already dressed for the day, and Tony suddenly felt a bit inadequate in his pajamas. Or wait, ghosts don’t sleep, right? Does Steve even bother changing into pajamas then?
“Though I’m not even good with the more durable ones, like gods or super soldiers, especially not when the super soldier has a habit of jumping from buildings or planes without a parachute. Or using themselves as a human shield.”
“Wouldn’t a tracking microchip have worked better for that?” Steve asked.
cat, Steve repeated internally.)
Tony parked his car next to what he assumed was the drab SUV that belonged to the appraiser he was supposed to be meeting. He supposed he was a little bit late, but only by like half an hour or so. The Audi had
Barnes gave him a smile that didn’t quite meet his eyes, and an uneasy feeling was beginning to creep up Tony’s throat as he recalled what he had seen and heard, the all-consuming anger he had felt towards the man in front of him in that memory.
At that, Steve burst into laughter again, throwing his head against the back of the couch. “I was wondering how long you’d last like that,” he finally got out between laughs.
“Pepper, I know I say this all the time, occasionally facetiously but most of the time genuinely, but you are the absolute best.” He let out a breath of air in relief. “Get yourself something nice from me for Christmas.”
now that their doom isn’t quite so imminent.
Steve nodded, something that looked a lot like determination finding its way to the surface. “I promise.”
For a moment, Tony thought Steve was going to continue to argue with him, but instead his anger deflated a bit, his shoulders dropping. Neither of them pushed the subject further, but they didn’t return to the easygoing atmosphere that had been between them before.
Apparently Clint posted the picture he took of Bucky holding Orion to the Avengers’ twitter account, and by the end of the week it had several hundred thousand retweets or something. Clint told Steve it had become a “meme,” and Steve guessed that must’ve been a good thing.
Then the realization truly hit him. That was
“Depends,” he tried to joke, but it was hard to put the humor into it.
“Wait,” Tony paused in his search to stare at Steve. “Is that photo downstairs of that frail kid actually you?”
The man’s posture had gone rigid, so Tony chanced a look in his direction and was met with an icy cold glare.
The other man sighed in defeat and set down his book. “Alright then, what do you have in mind?”
“And it’s cute and stylish,” he finished with, smiling at the cat again.
Eventually, the conversation wound down after a few hours, and Steve pushed his chair back from the table and got up, “I made you something.”
“I’ve always been a smartass if you ask...” Steve trailed off and there was a distant look to his eyes, as if he was in another time. Well, that wouldn’t be inaccurate, would it? There was a heaviness to his smile, and things grew quiet between them for a moment.
The winter sun blinded him for a moment, but when his eyes adjusted to the brightness, Tony could see a familiar form trudging through the snow towards the house. He had to blink a few times and maybe pinch himself just to be sure, but—
“It’s not yours.”
The man gave the little cat the strangest look, as if he was almost wary of him. “That’s a cat, right?”
Steve just toyed with the corner of his book, a wry smile on his face. “Don’t really think I’ve got much of a say in it.”
He loved watching how Tony interacted with Orion, loved watching him get completely engrossed in his work to the point of tuning out the rest of the world. Steve wasn’t exactly sure what to even call whatever was happening between between the two of them, but he had hope that maybe someday it could be something more.
Like they had broken the curse.
The next morning, Tony was very groggily standing in front of the coffee maker, waiting for it to dispense the nectar of the gods that would help him get through another day when Steve surprised him by suddenly appearing by his side. Well, he didn’t really just
Finally his mind booted up and caught up with the conversation. And then promptly screeched to a stop.
He can’t even begin to parse all the emotions he’s experiencing in that moment; everything was all mixed up in one awful jumble that he couldn’t even begin to untangle. Grief and loss mixed in with the relief that maybe Steve was somewhere much better now, with something like love tying all of the pain and happiness together.
“You know,” Tony said, getting Steve’s attention. “If I came back from the dead, I’d be eating something a lot more exciting than a grilled cheese.”
Bucky gave the archer a wary look but complied with his request anyway. Clint grabbed him by the shoulder and told him to stand still, then he started maneuvering him into a pose where he was holding Orion close to his chest in a defensive stance.
And because Tony had truly excellent people skills, as he was frequently reminded by Pepper, he ruined the mood entirely with his next question.
Steve took a moment to just watch as Clint was taking to his new role as Ear Scratcher with much delight as the cat repeatedly pushed his head into the archer’s hand, wanting more attention. The little guy sure was affectionate for a stray, and Steve couldn’t help the fondness he was already developing.
On the way to Steve’s quarters, Tony nervously chugged the bland, cold coffee until he found himself standing outside of the door, fiddling with the empty cup and trying to build up the nerve to knock. Finally, he just reached out and knocked before he could psyche himself out. In the twenty-something seconds it took for Steve to open the door, Tony considered abandoning the attempt at reaching out at least five times.
. Steve wasn’t able to use his drawing stuff and now he
When they were disconnected from the system, Tony took a shaky breath and sank to his knees on the metal floor of the conn-pod, unable to remain standing from the weight of everything he just saw crashing down on him. He chanced a look up at his copilot to his side, but Steve averted his eyes and rushed out of the conn-pod the moment the door opened.
It was something he hadn’t accounted for when he asked them all to move in to the Tower: the Avengers actually becoming more than a team… something more like a family. But here they were, and the Tower had begun to feel more like a home than it ever had before, and it almost terrified Tony more than what kept him up at night.
“She passed a coupla weeks before Christmas.”
“Like an intruder bashed me over the head,” he grumbled as he poured himself a cup of coffee before taking a seat at the kitchen table.
Her laughter brought a grin to his face. “Oh, I already have, don’t worry.”
When Steve answered, the light had returned to his eyes and his smile was amused again. “Maybe sometime.”
“Oh,” he says dazedly.
“No.” He pondered for a moment. “Besides, he’s slacking on the job. Dum-E, look at that mess over there. I thought I programmed you to help me around here, not try to launch a new career as a model.”
out of nowhere; he probably walked in like a normal person, but Tony was just not capable of processing his surroundings yet.
“Touché.”
“Phil? He seemed lovely over the phone.”
This time he waited until Steve was finished helping with the dishes and turned around. He chucked the phone directly at Steve’s chest, only for the phone to simply pass through him and hit the cabinet with a
And Steve was making that face he always did whenever they argued, where his jaw went tight and he switched into
“Here, can you make a face like this?” Clint showed him an image on his phone of a… samurai holding a cat.
Just before the worst of his regret could hit him, Tony reeled his emotions back in and tried to push it all to the back of his mind and focus on the Jaeger. The voice of the officer in mission control became clearer as Tony channeled his focus and got his emotions in check.
He was kinda out of ideas, aside from calling in an “expert,” and that really… really was not something Tony wanted to do. He didn’t want anyone poking and prodding at Steve and his life recklessly (he had already seen what his own slight carelessness had done). Steve had managed to come out of it that time, but Tony didn't want to take any chances as their deadline loomed.
He was in the kitchen on the communal floor when Steve came in, his cheeks were slightly red, so Tony figured he must have just taken his motorcycle out for a spin despite the fact that it was absolutely frigid outside.
“That… honestly sounds absolutely fucking miserable, sorry,” Tony commented with a heavy sigh.
“I think I’ve earned myself a permanent position on Steve’s shit list,” he began explaining, though he wasn’t sure why. The guy just had one of those faces that made a person spill their guts. “I made the grave mistake of asking about some art supplies in the attic, though it probably didn’t help any that I had yelled at him about his dead best friend right before that.”
He gracefully stretched his lithe body further across the couch and draped his arm over the side of the couch. “Rogers, paint me like one of your French girls.” He hesitated. “You’ve seen that one, right?”
“Don’t mind if I do.” Tony took a seat in an armchair that was near a small table in the corner of the room.
“Don’t touch those.” His voice was oddly unsteady.
, of the people he cared about dying because of his failures.
And so, Steve leaned in and pulled Tony into a tight hug.
He got a bashful smile from Steve in response to that, but then Steve waved it off. “A guy like you wouldn’t have given me a second look back then.”
“Come to join the land of the insomniacs again, O’Malley?” Tony held out a treat for the cat as he hopped up on the table as was now routine and gave him some pets once the treat was eaten.
He used his foot to kick open the front door of the inn, hands too busy helping to wrangle the tree across the snowy yard. His shoes were soaked through, he was covered in prickly, little pine needles, and he was starting to deeply regret picking out such a large tree at the lot in town.
Which really somehow made things worse. ‘Things’ as in really inconvenient childhood crushes on national icons. Really, Steve had some nerve being so absolutely perfect, and caring, and attractive, and everything Tony should never want because he knew he could never have it. He was kind and selfless, and he even brought home stray cats and brainwashed assassins for crying out loud. Tony didn’t even come close to deserving him, but knowing that didn’t make him
After getting off the phone with Pepper, Tony dragged himself out of bed and headed downstairs with the goal of injecting caffeine into his veins. Oh, and maybe finding Steve, too. He poked his head into the kitchen, but no one was in the room. He started to turn to go check Steve’s room but decided he should probably have some caffeine to prepare himself for whatever kind of conversation they were about to have.
They had dinner together again that night. It wasn’t like Tony specifically planned to be in the kitchen around the same time that he had noticed Steve liked to eat. It was completely and entirely coincidental.
One day Steve and Clint were watching television in the living room, and Clint spotted Bucky carrying Orion around and started cackling with glee.
“What can I say, I sympathize with strays.” Clint nonchalantly provided. “We can have shared custody, Steve.”
“Is there a time limit?” Steve hoped he sounded casual rather than embarrassed at being caught staring.
“Hey, JARVIS, make a note to get some food and water for him down here. Just because I forget to eat doesn’t mean he needs to follow my example.”
“Yup, like five minutes ago,” Tony answered after downing nearly half the cup of coffee.
Helping him move on… that had supposedly been the goal all along, right? Only at some point, Tony had started wishing that it wasn’t going to happen; that he could tell Pepper to call off the sale and just spend every Christmas with Steve at this stupid inn.
Once they reached each other, Tony threw his arms around Steve’s neck, and strong arms scooped him up, spinning Tony around in a crushing hug. When Steve set him back down, Tony grabbed him by the face, squishing his cheeks as the blond continued to smile adorably.
“Did you get the biggest one on the lot?”
“So, does that mean we can do that again?” Tony starts, words coming out in a rush. “Because it’s probably the best use of whatever oxygen we have left and—”
“Hey Tony,” Steve had greeted him while getting out what looked like ingredients to make hot chocolate. Because Steve, for all that he had quickly caught up with the modern world, was still adorably old fashioned. “I didn’t know you had a cat.”
“Had you not noticed? There’s one right in the hallway, actually.”
“Thank you for finding me.”
“Coffee might also help,” Rhodey added with a playful smirk as he put the chair back from where he’d pulled it.
It was the night of Valentine’s Day, and most of the other Avengers were out or just doing their own thing for the evening. Meanwhile, Steve was lounging on the couch in the living room with Orion asleep on his lap, watching whatever ridiculous romcom movie he’d come across while flipping through the channels.
“What the hell, Rogers? I’m just trying to help!”
“Is that one me?” he asked, deep voice sending vibrations through Tony in a way that had him suppressing a shiver.
Steve was watching amusedly as Clint was attempting to teach Orion a few tricks, and it was going surprisingly well. According to Clint, the success was in thanks to his circus background.
“I don’t know how long it’d been, maybe a year or so after I died. Ma’s family moved away, so no one had found out about my… situation. But for some reason, my pal Buck came by during Christmastime and found me here, ya know, like this.” He vaguely gestured to himself. “We looked for some way to fix whatever had happened, but nothing we found worked…”
would betray him like this. It couldn’t end like this. It just couldn’t—
“When was the last time
any less.
“Not a fucking word of this to anyone,” he (somewhat lamely) threatened Bruce as he stepped into the elevator and reached out to pet the cat, who magically woke up immediately upon contact. He totally had been feigning sleep for Tony. Devious, little bastard.
“You can stop now,” Steve told him as he took Tony’s hand in his. “You’ve done more than enough for me.”
Yeah, Tony definitely could see why the team fussed over the cat so much.
That look was now a weird mix of sternness and puppy dog eyes that made Tony almost feel guilty.
Except the main source of that warmth wasn’t the blanket, but perhaps the body heat radiating off of the super soldier who had somehow squeezed himself onto the couch behind Tony and had an arm draped sleepily around Tony’s waist.
“Chill, guys, I won’t catnap your baby.” Sam raised his hands in surrender and rolled his eyes at their antics.
“Thank you... for this.” Steve vaguely gestured, probably trying to convey that he meant more than just looking through his old artwork. “Even after I’ve been a complete ass, you’ve kept reaching out to me.”
Subconsciously, Tony’s tongue darted out to wet his lips. “I’d be willing to give it a try, you know, if you are, too. For science.”
Pepper gave him a look that shut him up pretty quickly.
So he takes his shot.
“I was plannin’ on going to art school before Ma got sick,” Steve continued explaining. “But even if she hadn’t, the war woulda kept me from going anyway. I think Ma blamed herself a bit, but I never held it against her.”
He hesitated to answer her, listening for more noises from downstairs. Which apparently worried her more.
“But part of me is almost relieved that I haven’t seen him since then… because I don’t want him to be stuck like this. I don’t want him to be stuck here, and especially not over there.” His eyes were glazed over, like he was lost somewhere else in that moment.
“Wow.” That was always a good start. “...You did all of this?”
“Et tu, Brucie?” Tony gasped with an exaggerated look of betrayal on his face.
They slipped into casual, quiet conversation after that, and the couch was beginning to real absolutely way too comfortable. The exhaustion of the day was hitting him, but Tony willed his eyes to stay open and was doing an excellent job of it.
“You’ve warmed up to
“I think…” It took Steve a second to find his words. “It still is my life. Sometimes it doesn’t feel like I died, but then something will happen that reminds me, and I don’t always react too well.”
Meanwhile, Tony couldn’t stop trying to piece together why the hell they hadn’t been able to break the curse yet. Steve was a bit quiet the rest of the day, but he kept drawing and somehow didn’t seem to be as weighed down by everything anymore. He couldn’t tell if Steve had just given up, or if this was his way of coping with it. He didn’t seem as tense and quick to anger as he had in those first few days, and he’d come to terms with his (needless) guilt over his best friend’s death… so what the hell was keeping him here?
They shared stories while they were eating, joking and laughing through all of them. Steve told him about his adventures growing up in Brooklyn with Bucky, and Tony couldn’t believe that stick of a boy in the old photos used to get into alley fights like it was going out of style.
He’s almost afraid to look away. Afraid that if he does, it’ll all turn out to be just another dream, and Steve won’t be at his side when he looks again.
“Oh my god,” he whispered.
Tony had almost finished his first mug when Coulson appeared out of nowhere, nearly causing him to spill the rest when he jumped. “Good morning, Mr. Stark. How is everything?”
“JARVIS?” He still couldn’t help but look up at the ceiling when he spoke to the AI.
After half-heartedly poking around on some business documents for a few hours, Tony decided there was something more important he needed to do.
“Mhm, yeah, no, baking and cooking are definitely two entirely different things.”
“But I did before I left!” Steve defended.
The little guy didn’t seem to mind the whole ordeal and eagerly gobbled up the treats Nat gave him for being such a good boy. Maybe Tony would warm up to the cat now that he wasn’t a potential fluffball of destruction. Steve had assumed that was perhaps the issue, or maybe it was just that Tony probably didn’t have any pets growing up. Howard didn’t seem like the type, and Tony’s childhood hadn’t sounded very warm or loving from the offhand comments he sometimes disguised as jokes.
Tony let out a derisive snort as he thought back to his childhood Christmases, or lack thereof. “We uh… we never really did much as a family when I was growing up. Howard was always busy with the company, and Mom always seemed to have a reason to be out of the house.”
.” Something else dawned on him, and Tony raised an eyebrow at Steve. “You’re… warm. Like really warm.”
It seemed like they had pretty much run out of things to investigate, though Tony figured later he might look over the newspapers again, just in case he had missed anything. There was only a handful of days remaining until Christmas Eve, and it felt like they were quickly running out of time to break the curse on Steve.
So he decided to take a chance, “Maybe we can get it right, too.” The smile he earned from Steve left him awestruck and blinded as if he were staring directly into the sun. Suddenly, the room seemed a lot warmer than it had been before. And Steve was so much closer than he had been before…
Thor in particular loved to play with Orion using the little mouse shaped laser pointer, loudly declaring the cat a “most valiant warrior” as he darted around, smacking at the little dot as it zoomed around on the floor. A time or two, Thor had tried pointing the laser at someone’s feet to see if Orion would still smack at it. The one time he had been brazen enough to try with Natasha only resulted in the most blank expression on her face, as if she were daring Thor to do it. His warm laughter quickly faded as he directed the laser pointer away from her.
“More than this?” Tony gave him a questioning look and gestured to the table. “You didn’t have to…”
Tony gently poked at Orion’s soft tummy as he sat down on the couch right next to Steve. “Hey, sharing is caring. He’s my furnace, too.”
That was… odd.
Soon after, Steve returned with two cups of coffee. Forget super soldier, this man was some kind of super angel.
He just about had something figured out when he felt an uneasy sensation creep across his shoulders, as if he was being watched. Which was a ridiculous notion because only Steve ever bothered him while he was working, and the Tower was probably the safest building in the city if you didn’t count the feline infiltration.
“What room are we taking it to, Mr. Stark?” Coulson’s voice was steady. Clearly someone else wasn’t having as much trouble as Tony was.
“Yeah, well, even if you can be a bit of an ass, you’re at least self-aware about it.” Tony’s mouth suddenly felt very dry, and he closed the sketchbook before setting it down on the desk. “But you don’t deserve whatever this is— being stuck here.”
“You sound like you think it’s about as great as the time I surprised you with a board meeting.” She always could see right through him, even when she wasn’t even looking at him. “Did something happen?”
...Which of course didn’t actually fix any of the issues, but hiding from them always made Tony feel better. Sort of. Well, that was what he tried to convince himself, anyway.
Steve leans closer, and suddenly lips are gently pressing against Tony’s, and the rush of guilt ebbs away. It takes a second before he realizes he should probably kiss Steve back. His lips are a little bit chapped, but the softness and warmth are heavenly in the chill of the escape pod.
of all things. As if a wall could ever stop the force of a Kaiju hellbent on eradicating humanity.
“Well good morning, little buddy!” Steve cooed at Orion, who was just barely tall enough to rest his chin on the table while he sniffed, his eyes wide and doe-like in what he’d heard Clint describe as his Puss in Boots face. “You want some eggs, cutie?”
“What? But Steve, what if this is it? What if this is the thing that’s holding you back?” Tony protested, unable to fully rein in his emotions.
Memories that just couldn’t be his started flashing through Tony’s mind, almost like some sort of discordant newsreel of a life he didn’t remember living. They all felt so real, so visceral. The overwhelming force of it all caused Tony to lose his balance, his head throbbing painfully from the onslaught.
There was a pause before Steve spoke again. “Right now, breaking the curse honestly isn’t the most important thing to me.” He smiled shyly before saying, “If you don’t mind, I’d much rather just enjoy the rest of my time here… with you.”
There were less than forty-eight hours remaining until the curse would whisk Steve away until next year, and quite frankly, it was stressing Tony the fuck out. He’d found the man drawing in the study, nestled in an armchair near the window with his sketchbook propped on his knee.
“He always looked out for me, and when it came down to it, I couldn’t do the same for him. I wasn’t there when he needed me.” There was so much pain and grief laced through Steve’s words.
“If I didn’t want you to look, I wouldn’t have left it within reaching distance.” Oh, the grogginess in Steve’s voice was really doing something to him.
The ghost stormed out of the attic without another word, leaving Tony at a loss for whatever the fuck just happened. Suddenly feeling drained, Tony slumped against the nearest stack of cardboard boxes, not caring that he was getting covered in dust.
“We’ve formed a truce,” Clint answered. “But if he ever turns coat, I can seek higher ground than he can reach.”
“Boriiing,” Tony complained as he flipped open the file.
“Do you think it could be guilt?”
“You’re just a big softie.”
They spent the rest of the day sorting through the various books in the study, looking for anything that might be even remotely important to Steve and his life, but they kept coming up short. Ironically enough, most of the information they found about the town and its happenings were from even before Steve’s time. As they worked, Tony kept thinking back to the moment from earlier when Steve had bared so much about the pain and guilt he carried with him regarding his best friend. Tony wasn’t sure what he had done to earn the man’s trust that quickly, but he was amazed at the truthfulness of that moment. That surly exterior Steve donned seemed to be his only defense against everything he’d been through. He couldn’t imagine what it must be like to go through this for seventy years, how incredibly lonely the man must be after so long. Maybe he shouldn’t poke at him as much, though something about having Steve’s attention on him, furious or not, was strangely thrilling.
Well, shit.
Tossing back the sheets, he slid out of bed to wander through the house searching for Steve, just in case he was secretly waiting somewhere to jump out and yell surprise like some sort of extremely attractive and sweet jumpscare. The first place he headed to was Steve’s bedroom. When Tony quietly opened the door, he was greeted by the sight of Steve’s belongings neatly packed and setting on the bed, waiting to be put back into storage. Of course Steve was the type to be overly considerate of others when he was the one who was cursed. He fought back the urge the reach out and touch the boxes, knowing they were the only signs of Steve that were left.
Steve found himself... relieved that this was the direction his life was going now. When he had woken up from the ice, he had felt so lost and alone. The Avengers had given him something to latch onto when Tony invited them all to live in his tower after the Chitauri invasion. Finding and saving Bucky had been nothing short of a miracle, but there was no way he would have been able to do it without his team supporting him. He didn’t long for the past anymore. He had for months after the ice, but now that the only piece of his past that had him still looking back was at his side, Steve felt like the only way to go was forward.
“I guess after Pepper left… I just assumed you guys would be next. But you’re still here, God only knows why, and there’s even more of you now. Just judging by my own track record, I should’ve bolted like months ago. But I guess I’ve come to terms with the idea that you all are actually sticking around, so now I’ve gotta make sure you don’t up and die after I’ve finally decided I kinda sorta am fond of you.”
Things had been going well, much better than Tony had admittedly expected. Their teamwork had been fantastic even when they had been tossed together in the middle of a world-threatening crisis, but now that the Avengers had lived together for a little over a year, their teamwork was, dare he say, flawless.
“Alright, then.” He sighed and scooped the extremely asleep cat to carry him out of the workshop. “You’re lucky you’re so damn cute.”
“You know, he likes to ride around on Dum-E’s base like he’s some sort of Roomba,” Tony laughed, eyes full of warmth when he looked over at his bot playing with the cat. (After that Steve had googled ‘cats and roomba’ and had not been disappointed by the results.)
, though it wasn’t nearly as severe as the kind of looks he shot Tony’s way on the first day.
Bright, blue eyes met his own, and he was overwhelmed by the emotion in them. “You’ve given me more than enough. I’ve been miserable and angry for so long that I had lost myself to it. You pulled me out of that, that abyss… and I’m so thankful that you may be the one person out there that’s as stubborn as I am.”
“We’ve always known the breach is some sort of portal the Kaiju use, but we’ve always assumed that they were coming from somewhere in space, right? But what if they’re not? What if the portal connects with a different universe entirely? And your visions, our dreams, they’re just some sort of leaky by-product of the invasion.”
Tony continued to look through Steve’s sketchpad while he was making coffee, and now that he didn’t feel as if he was sneaking around, he could take the time to fully appreciate the details. Somehow, Steve had managed to capture the soft glow of the arc reactor in his chest, and Tony’s heart swelled with fondness.
“Contrary to popular belief, my life hasn’t exactly been sunshine and rainbows either,” Tony felt the need to counter with, then gave a firm nod as he added, “We’ll be fine, Steve.”
It was suddenly so cold.
Steve didn’t come to the kitchen for dinner that night, either.
“Yes, Captain Rogers?”
“So… you can touch pretty much everything else in this house, that’s older than me at least, except for the things that matter to you the most? That’s pretty fucked, honestly,” commented Tony, a grimace screwing up his face.
“Noted, sir.”
He wasn’t sure how much time had passed when Steve’s voice interrupted his thoughts suddenly.
“That was one time,” protested Tony.
It wasn’t often that all of the Avengers had breakfast together, but it did happen occasionally, and today was apparently one of those days. When Steve had returned from his morning run, he found Clint perched on top of the refrigerator, eating cereal. He nodded in greeting at the archer as he got a carton of orange juice out of the fridge.
After a moment of getting lost in each other’s eyes, Steve was the one who broke contact, much to Tony’s disappointment. “To be honest, I was actually worried you’d never want to speak to me again after yesterday, but you really seem to be taking all of this in stride.”
Steve paused before going up the steps, staring up at the house. “You gonna keep this place?”
Finally, they found something. A report about an accident at the lake in front of the house dated  December the seventeenth.
The innkeeper just gave him that annoyingly calm, yet amused smile. “Rough night?”
“Tony? Is everything okay over there?” There was a worried tone to Pepper’s voice.
“Right now?” Steve nodded, maintaining eye contact, and boy, that was
“Good, ‘cuz now
He was already out the door by the time Tony called out, “I definitely would not be opposed to that.”
The cat circled around the table a couple of times before finding an agreeable spot to plop down and watch as Tony got back to work on his project. Occasionally he reached out to give Orion some ear scritches because it was pretty hard to resist all that soft fluffiness so close-by. There was something relaxing about the cat’s presence; Clint might’ve been right about the whole “serotonin machine” thing.
And gradually he slipped under entirely.
Steve became a little less nervous over the course of dinner, which tasted just as good as it had smelled, though Tony guessed it made sense that he would be a decent cook after taking care of his mother.
“Orion’s Belt.”
He lost track of how long they sat like that on the floor, Steve pulled tightly to his chest. At some point, the fire had faded to mere embers, but Tony stayed there, holding Steve until the shivering subsided and the color returned to his face.
Steve looked downright nervous, even though Tony had literally admitted his own sexuality just minutes before. Tony hated that the world had ever made Steve have to hide that part of himself.
“...You got a tree,” Steve repeated slowly, as if it’d make more sense.
“Okay, it’s finished. Come here, honeybuns.” Tony wiggled his fingers at the cat to motion him closer so he could attach what he was working on to Orion’s collar.
The answer he received was the warmest smile he thought he’d ever seen directed at himself before Steve pulled him close and brought their lips together in a tender kiss.
“You don’t believe me,” Steve gave him a challenging look. “Fine, follow me.”
There was a small, yet brief smile on Steve’s face as he turned to Tony. “So you did your research?”
Steve was drawing him that day.
There was a long pause before Steve answered him. “It’s… cold.” His voice was so quiet, so… distant. Something wasn’t right.
“What? No.” Bucky answered, sounding perplexed.
And that was how the Avengers got a cat.
He hadn’t actually been inside this room yet, so he took a second to take it all in. It was fairly spartan with only a few personal effects here and there: a few sketchbooks among the books on a shelf, some framed photographs sitting on the desk. Presumably, the handsome, smirking brunet with his arm thrown around Steve’s shoulders in one of the photos must be Bucky (Steve’s
stop paying attention to the man (and he really didn’t
But he had to admit, the Tower somehow felt… warmer since the cat wandered in a couple weeks ago. Sure, the Avengers had already been well on their way to becoming really good… roommates before then, but it seemed like the fluffiest resident had become a sort of rallying point for them, giving them something else in common besides punching bad guys and having a shit ton of emotional baggage. Tony even thought he caught Natasha smiling the other day, and he wasn’t sure if he should run for his life or not.
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve said, his blue eyes bright with sincerity. The door softly clicked shut behind him as he left Tony in the study, at a complete loss as to what just happened.
“What did you and your mother used to do for Christmas?” Tony asked, hoping it would work.
When he didn’t answer her, she continued. “I’ll see what I can do about things here on my end, but can you do me a favor?”
“Don’t let yourself fall for someone who can’t love you back the way you deserve.”
The ghost shrugged. “This isn’t something I decide myself. I don’t… I’m not even sure where I am when I’m not here. I just wake up here, and it’s December thirteenth all over again.”
“What would you like the title to be, sir?”
“Okay, yeah, that was nice. They were onto something for sure, but I might need to test it again.”
And then he found himself blinking awake. Shit. He’d completely fallen asleep.
“Tony, no, I can’t ask that of you,” Steve protested, reaching up to gently hold Tony’s face with his hands. “You deserve so much more than just twelve days a year. Please don’t throw away your chance at happiness just for me. Don’t let this curse take your future, too.”
Steve nodded, then turned and met Tony’s eyes, his gaze full of certainty. “I… knew I had to meet you somehow. That it was the only way I was going to find any answers about what I was seeing.”
Tony rocketed off the front porch and ran as well as he could through the snow to meet him halfway. When Steve saw him, his face lit up with a smile almost as blinding as the winter sun.
“You just wanted to shut me up,” Tony pouts, sticking out his bottom lip. He definitely notices how Steve’s eyes quickly flick down to his mouth.
Steve didn’t come down for dinner that night.
Tony didn’t look up when he spoke, “How long are you going to stand there and stare, Rogers?”
“Sorry it took so long,” Tony smiled gently as he leaned his forehead against Steve’s.
Tony leaned against the bannister of the stairs and smiled warmly at Steve. “Dinner sounds fantastic.”
. Tony surged forward, threading his fingers through Steve’s hair and deepening the kiss, licking into Steve’s mouth and capturing the taller man’s soft gasp.
“Wow.” Clint looked somewhat impressed at the sight of the cat peacefully curled up in Steve’s arms. “He sure likes it there, but I don’t think anyone would blame him for that.” Clint wiggled his eyebrows at him, but Steve steadfastly ignored his teasing.
“You do, but for some reason they’ve completely muddled this whole process. Can you just do this one thing for me? Meet with the appraiser and get everything sorted out. I’m sure you’ll have it taken care of in just a day or two.”
When he turned to meet eyes with the former pilot, the expression on his face wasn’t exactly the friendliest, but Barnes also didn’t look like he had come to kick Tony’s ass, at least. There was an awkward beat of silence between them.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve rolled his eyes at Tony and wow, did he just get sassed by a ghost? You know, if they even did exist.
Afterwards, they called shelters and other vets in the area, but no one had reported a cat by his description missing. Which pretty much meant this was happening for real.
Steve? abruptly stood up from the table, chair screeching across the floor at the sudden movement. His surliness had turned to outright anger, and it was directed right at Tony, who did well to resist squirming in his seat.
Steve gestured over to the cat, who was now stretched across the arm of the couch as if he owned the entire tower.
“His Puss in Boots face?”
“Actually… you’ve given me something better,” Steve said so softly that Tony could barely hear the words.
“Wait, oh my god. You
The man didn’t let any details about his plans for dinner slip while they were eating breakfast, despite Tony’s many attempts at prying for information. Afterwards, he shooed Tony out of the kitchen, leaving him to his own devices while Steve worked on... whatever he was plotting.
“When we moved here, my aunt always had a tree decorated for any guests that stayed around Christmastime. Ma and I had never gotten one to decorate after Da passed, but I helped with the one here.”
Steve’s attention immediately shifted to Tony, and he felt heat start to crawl up the back of his neck when those beautiful blue eyes considered him. This crush was getting way out of hand.
Oh. That’s…
“That better?” He asked, giving Steve a sly smirk.
Time to kick some Kaiju ass.
“I need you to head there to settle everything.”
His little shoulders drooped, and his face looked sad as he meowed to be let inside the workshop. It reminded Tony way too much of Dum-E whenever he yelled at the bot for messing up smoothies.
He opened his mouth to object again, but Steve stood up from the table and quietly walked towards the door. He stopped in front of the doorway and looked back over his shoulder at Tony, making eye contact with him.
“How long did I last?”
“It’s just some art stuff. What’s the big deal?” was definitely the wrong thing to say.
“No, you can’t stay in here by yourself.” Tony told him as ran his fingers through the soft fur on the cat’s belly, which still didn’t wake him up.
“The cat, of course. You’re sweetcakes,” he answered with an eye roll loaded with fondness.
“I probably haven’t been going about things the best way either. This isn’t some sort of equation to solve, or some sort of treasure hunt with a chest of gold or some shit to find at the end, it’s your life.” He stopped for a moment, thinking. “
The man with the metal arm got the upper hand somehow and had the person in the red armor pinned against the wall of the bunker. As the man was desperately clawing into the glowing circle in the chest of the armor, Tony caught a glimpse of his face... A face that he knew.
The ghost stood up and crossed the room to look out the window overlooking the front yard. Ooh, dramatic.
Steve looked up from the page, eyes wide. “There’s other books?”
Orion and Fury had a weird staring contest of sorts before Fury gave in and cautiously pet him, having determined there was no threat. Life at the Tower was generally weird all the time, but seeing Director Fury hesitant around a small housecat of all things really took the cake that week.
The smile disappeared from Steve’s face as he slowly looked down at Tony’s hand on his wrist. Oops. Maybe he wasn’t much of a touchy-feely kind of person, and admittedly sometimes Tony was a bit too touchy. Tony was about to apologize when it registered in his caffeine-deprived brain that he was holding Steve’s wrist.
Sometimes Orion would be in the workshop with Tony, and Steve would take up residency on the couch and observe their interactions while he drew. Even Tony’s bots seemed to be taken with the little cat. When Dum-E wasn’t making questionable smoothies for Tony, the bot would dangle a toy from his claw for Orion to jump up and smack around.
“Oh! That’s— okay, yeah, no, that’s as nice as I thought it would be. Maybe nicer.” Steve felt Tony’s arms wrap around him as the shorter man buried his face into Steve’s shoulder. “Definitely nicer.”
He made an attempt to explain it anyway, the mysterious memories he had seen in the drift, the subsequent nightmares, and the few theories he had been tossing around at that point. Rhodey and Carol listened intently, not offering any words of doubt despite the whole thing being (quite frankly) absolutely unbelievable. But that was just how the pair was, and Tony was forever grateful to have them in his life.
“What? Why not?” Tony gave him a questioning look and reached out to flick open the latch on the top case anyway.
Steve stood up, and immediately Tony was worried he had overstepped some sort of boundary, but then he pulled up another chair facing the couch and sat down with his sketchpad.
Before Carol opened the door, she pointed in mock-threat at Tony. “You’ve got five minutes to look presentable or else I’m dragging you down to the mess hall in your sheets.”
Tony jolted upright in bed with a gasp, blinking the fuzziness out of his vision as he looked around his room.
“Me?” Tony added.
“Look at that,” Tony motioned to the cat absolutely sound asleep on top of Steve. “You’re like his personal kitty furnace.”
Thank you to everyone who commented and left kudos on the first chapter! <3
While Steve was fixing his own breakfast, Bruce and Tony wandered in, having a fast-paced discussion about some theory they were going to test. Judging by Tony’s already empty coffee mug, the genius was emerging to refuel rather than actually waking up that early in the morning.
“In the fifteen years that I’ve worked at this inn, I’ve only seen him during the twelve days leading up to Christmas.”
liked pizza.” Oh god, did Coulson just tell a joke? Forget ghosts, Tony had somehow entered into the Twilight Zone when he stepped foot into this godforsaken place.
