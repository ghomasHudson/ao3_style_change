The water is streaming down his back and he’s lost in his thoughts, which is why he doesn’t hear anyone come in until the stall next to him starts running.
“So you want this. That’s—what in the fuck.” If Steve is being honest, he is curious about omegas. Before his serum, he had been an omega himself, but Erskine had rightfully fixed that. Steve had never acted like an omega in his life. The serum only validated what had been true all along, that Steve was meant to be an alpha. He’d been so sickly that he’d never even had a heat, nor a strong desire to nest and mate. Steve figured that his body had somehow turned omega in the womb as a defense mechanism for his failing health.
“Yeah, yeah I think I will. What’s the point of hiding it anymore?” Steve’s brows are furrowed, and there’s raw hunger in his eyes. Tony knows what it looks like because he sees it in the mirror every time he thinks of Steve. It looks ugly on Tony, and on Steve, it’s like the beauty of a predator. He half thinks that Steve wants something other than to end him.
And yes, Tony was aware of the contradiction that, if he believes Steve is a part of him, Steve telling Tony it’s over is as good as confirmation that Tony is either crazy, or that Steve only lives inside Tony. Now, and forever.
“Fine. I’ve got a room.” Normally Tony takes payment first, but this is the very last thing they need in order to make warp speed. The very last thing they need to get home to earth. Fuck it; if this is a scam, it’s the very last scam that he’s ever going to experience. Besides, Andorians are cool customers, not usually super demanding in bed. And the guy looks legit.
“How long?” The HUD is a shaky mess, its targeting accurate while the cameras blur the features of the Chitauri who are firing directly into his face as he lays on the concrete.
“Tony.” Steve had turned around now, taking a step across his invisible line. If he could just get Cap to come the entire way–
Steve sips at his drink to hide the curling of his lips at Tony’s stunned face. The symbiote starts to reach for Steve, tentatively, and Steve sticks out his other hand to receive the cool metal touch. Tony’s eyes are fixed on the interaction, his jaw slightly dropped and his tongue frozen in his mouth. Steve twines his fingers around the liquid metal, caressing the soft surface. It’s not cold like the ice. It’s smooth, as sleek as sheets on a cool autumn night. It glances along his skin, silky and sly.
Tony, and get him fat with Steve’s children. Right now though, he could easily crush Tony. He’s already bruised Tony’s hips with how hard he’d pummeled him, he knows, and he wants to see the petal-shaped bruises of his fingers on Tony.
Another shriek, and it tears off a panel on their arm, as well as one that covers the joint on their leg.
chitters, low and curling, its sleek body whipping through the storm with a lazy sway that belied the danger therein. Rain comes down in torrents, and even through their helmets they could hear the pat-pat of it battering the cold steel that sat between them and their enemy.
“Sounds good.” That was a dismissal if he ever heard one. He did as Tony said and found the credit card, but he didn’t know where to go or what to buy. Taking a risk, he dialed Natasha, who had been programmed into his phone.
“Want to see you cry, baby. Come for me?” Tony’s so sensitive, each time he cums, tears streak down his face. Steve likes to lap at them when he’s knotted inside Tony, and it feels like everything he is is being consumed. Steve sucks hard at his cock now, and presses his fingers into Tony, the squelching indecently loud.
“I’m Edith by the by. I always get ahead of myself and forget the niceties, and I certainly know better than that by now. Maybe someday I’ll learn.”
He wonders too what happened to Brenna and Colleen. He thinks it’s time he goes back to the church. Maybe they know more about the omegas that lived in the area at the time. Nat didn’t ask him about his homework to find three omegas he admired either, so he assumes that next time they’ll go over it. Steve hasn’t had much time to really think about it, but he thinks Edith is on his list. He’s never met someone so strong, except for maybe Tony. Is it wrong to put Tony on the list? Tony still has a laundry list of flaws, mostly related to his sleeping around.
“It’s no trouble at all. Not a lot of people remember the past and who was in it these days. I’d like to think they’d be thankful someone took the time to care what became of them.” The priest leads him to the sacristy then, dropping the cloths in a waiting laundry basket before gesturing at him to follow him down some stairs. The ceiling on the way down is low, and Steve has to duck to make it through. And when they get down there, his head is almost at the ceiling. It’s cramped and smells faintly of sewage.
“You can’t afford me.” Tony’s decision to lead an Alpha-free life was not a choice of health, and it was kind of Fury to frame it that way. The truth was that he couldn’t tolerate anyone in his space after Afghanistan. Not without remembering Yinsen. The careful way he’d handled Tony, shielding him from inspection by their captors so that Tony could build their way out. His intimacy had been lost somewhere in the tunnels, with Yinsen’s body. He’d thought he could try again with Pepper, with someone who wasn’t obligated to like him for his designation or ability to make money.
They go down to the parking garage, though it’s not the same floor that Natasha had used. This one looks private, and Steve can see all sorts of different cars lined up. They’re flashy, curved lines and futuristic angles.
Of course, Fury spots him and disengages with Hill, making his way over to Tony. He darts around to look for his honey bear, only to see him hamming it up with some Air Force bros in the corner. Longingly, he searches for Pepper, and sees her engaged with Sunset Bain. And he’s too kind to spoil that kind of fun for her.
Justin-fucking-Hammer and Anton Vanko. It’s not unlikely so much as too plausible. Even as the drones chase after Iron Man, it’s like they’re cheap knockoffs from alibaba.  Which, these drones are more annoying than a condom full of fire ants.
“Maybe you wouldn’t mind checking for me. I’m not so great with computers myself, honestly, and I don’t want to break anything.” Steve hasn’t used a computer more than a few times.
“Yeah, you. I’ve had a crush on you since I used training wheels. And then I met you, and it’s only gotten more involved from there. I would have you any time, any place, any single way. God, Steve. Have you seen you? Do you even know you? You’re like the best person I’ll ever know. I will never deserve you, but that doesn’t stop me from wanting.” He pauses for a second and then flaps his jaw a few times in shock. “Shit, I—I can’t say I didn’t mean all that, but we can totally forget it ever came up. Please. Pretty please?” Tony makes to get up but realizes at the last second that he’s got a raging boner that will belay his sincerity. He’s so horny now that his balls and dick ache painfully, the need to orgasm pressing at the seams of his sanity. And then there’s Steve. Perfect, gorgeous Steve. Who isn’t running away or punching him in the face.
“So that’s what I’m left with? An alpha who has good intentions, but flawed execution? I think I deserve more than that.”
Rhodes levels him with a look that could melt vibranium, and Pepper turns her hollowed-out eyes towards Steve.
What they couldn’t do, is reverse engineer the code or the reactor, especially. Except Vanko. He probably could have.
“—or wreck the whole company.” She gestures at the empty air, eyes blinking rapidly. He thinks she’s holding back more tears, or perhaps anger at Tony’s failure.
“I’d say I was disappointed with you lying Tony, but we both know that wouldn’t be true.” Tony didn’t have to move his head to see Steve through the viewscreen. The man’s every muscle was taut, spring-loaded for action.
“Has he hurt you?” Bucky is in his face then, nostrils flaring as he scents Tony. Tony smacks him on the shoulder, shoving him away.
“Bucky,” Steve snaps. “Knock it off. It’s not your time and he’s not your toy. Or have you told him how you’re the kind of alpha who leaves an omega right after he’s had his way? Tony doesn’t want that. He deserves commitment, and all you offer is debasement.”
“You’ll tell me when you’re stressed next time, right Tony? I’d like to be there for you and do this for you.” Steve looks so sincere from what Tony can see through his sweaty bangs that are plastered to his forehead.
Tony comes after a time and lays down, curling up next to Steve. Steve puts his arms around the omega, tucks his bottom up against Steve’s groin, and settles in. This is where he should be. His sense of completeness is resolute, immovable.
Steve’s cock is hanging hard against Tony’s bare thigh, and it twitches now, his need becoming insistent that he makes a valiant attempt at conquest of Tony’s body. He tries to ignore it for a time, giving Tony slow, languorous kisses that soak up Tony’s wordless pleas. Tony’s hands reach for him, dragging down the sides of Steve’s body, his arms.
He’s anything but angry about it. Shouldn’t he be angry? He can’t think anymore. Groaning, he presses back again against Steve. The Alpha unhooks his legs from Tony’s, and kneels back. Tony twists his head around to get a better look and almost whines again with how lovely the Captain looks like this.
him. Steve can tell that Tony wants him to fill Tony up with his big alpha cock, that’s so thick and hard, there’s no room for any thought that isn’t
“Seems like that’s not much of a question.” Steve is peering down at photos of the omega man he’s been given. There’s a certain vanity in the man’s eyes, a bit of rebelliousness that Steve just knows he’s going to have to curb, if he can’t get out of this. He has to believe that his friend, Howard, would have never betrothed his son to Steve if he had known what Anthony Stark was going to turn into.
There were treatments for it, but the quickest way to resolve it was spending time with an Omega. And with Captain America, well, Tony didn’t know what the serum would do.
Steve feels his pants tighten as his cock takes a firm interest in the proceedings. Steve gently rests his wrist over the lump in his pants and tries to not breathe. Every time he does, he feels his dick expand a little more.
Bucky doesn’t keep them waiting, and as he enters the room he takes his cue from Steve, sitting on a separate couch, but not near Tony. Trust the Winter Soldier to have a good idea of when it’s not the time to be a boundary-pressing flirt. Not that it would have changed Tony’s decision.
There’s a little smile swimming on Bucky’s lips and the distinct outline of his cock pressed against the towel he’s wearing. Tony looks down in askance, but Bucky holds a hand out to stop him from moving closer.
Bucky remained silent, but kept trying to make eye contact with Steve. Steve, in his embarrassment for the previous week’s conversation, avoided meeting Bucky’s eyes. But he can see that Bucky is riled, unhappy about Pepper’s treatment.
But he doesn’t have to admit to that today. Today he did one good thing in a long line of bad things he’s always done, and that’s a reprieve before he’s once again told he’s not good enough. He’ll take it.
The second letter is to James Rhodes, who he suspects may never forgive him. If Steve didn’t find his need so painful, he might have cared more about someone Tony loves hating him indefinitely. But no matter what they think of Steve, Tony needs his friends. He needs his life to stay relatively the same. Steve’s going to do everything possible to ensure that. SI will be in Pepper’s hands, Tony will do R&D for the company as always, though at a less frenetic pace. He’ll be Iron Man, and fight next to Steve in the field. Rhodey and Pepper will still be in his life, as will the Avengers.
Tony, who takes him so well each time, babbling endearments while Steve pummels him. He’s brilliant and whip-smart in a way that Steve can’t compare himself to. Even if Steve’s blood hadn’t helped solve this crisis, he thinks that Tony would have figured out a way on his own at some point.
The doctors pack up and leave then, not a single one of them pays Steve any mind as they go, but he can hear them talking amongst themselves and a few of them look back at him with eyes like flint and lips set in a rigid line.
“Gonna take such good care of you. You’ll never go unfucked. I’ll have you day and night until you’re begging me to stop when you’re not pleading for my knot.” Bucky slams his hips hard into Tony’s, and Tony yelps. He’s fully hard now, his cock aching for more release. Release that Bucky will surely grant him. He’s been so generous otherwise.
“I surely wouldn’t know what you’re talking about, ma’am,” Steve says, bashful. He lets his Brooklyn accent slip out as well. He was definitely one of those boys she’s referring to.
Steve realizes he’s stumbled into a well-oiled unit much like the Howling Commandos. Iron Man is just that kind of guy, Steve realizes, and it’s not a big deal.
“Tony is a unique omega, a unique person. All of what they say about him, that’s not the whole story.” Her gaze is alert, and she gives him direct eye contact, daring him to say more.
“We’ll talk. I’ll handle cleanup.” She stepped closer again, and he swooped her up into a hug. He couldn’t feel her hand rise to hold his shoulder, or rub her thumb meagerly against his armor, but it meant the world to him that she still cared when he saw it.
Nonetheless, he cooperates for the blood tests, letting Bruce’s gentle hands slide a needle under his skin and draw several vials of blood each time.
Straddling Tony, he shuffles up to press his knees into the slots of Tony’s armpits. Taking his hand, he wipes off the rest of the drool and slicks himself up. It’s unnecessary, but it feels fantastic, sordid. He breaches Tony’s hot mouth with a single thrust, hand fisted in his Omega’s hair. Mumbling, Tony’s teeth gently scrape over Steve’s cock, but the minor amount of pain is nothing compared to the magnificent depths of Tony’s mouth.
Like a beautiful flame, Steve draws him inside, Tony stumbling and falling over himself to follow. He’s never been so klutzy, but something about this moment makes his limbs feel like they don’t belong to him, like he’s floating around without anchors to this world.
“You are so close, yet so far. You almost get it, but that’s worse than not getting it at all. See, people like me, we make you. Without someone like me, you’re nothing. And if I wanted? I could probably figure you out and make a dozen more. That’s how unique you are. And with all that, not even you could stop what happened to Coulson.” It’s low, reminding Cap of who he couldn’t help. The man has a savior complex the size of his ego.
Steve thinks it’s sweet. But Tony knows that his wings are horny for the man and not on the down-low about it. Worse, everyone seems to know the truth but Steve. Admitting his wings are a barometer for his feelings was all but shouting that he has a big, fat, unrequited crush on Rogers.
Tony felt a single digit, wet with lubricant that he has no idea how Steve got ahold of, penetrate him. Roughly, he jerks himself back on it, embedding the finger up to the last knuckle.
“Afraid? Is that what you think this is? God, I know I can’t make you like me, but just once I’d love for you to shut up about not liking me.”
Tony wakes to a loud bellowing, the sun bright in his eyes while ashes play in the light. It stinks horrendously, burning rubber and other even less pleasant scents fill his nostrils.
Otherwise the man is nigh untouchable. If he didn’t want to be taken, why did he make his walls so high? Set Steve an impossible task, and he will manage to do it. It was inevitable that the immovable wall that is Tony would come head to head with Steve, who was as implacable as the wind rushing over boulders.
Bucky grunts and thrusts, his irritation at Steve’s words wrapped inside his movements. Slowly, harshly, he starts fucking into Tony, every rough movement a sucking sound of fluid in Tony’s ass. Tony is so open and loose that he can barely feel his muscles clench at Bucky’s cock, but he knows when he comes, he’ll lock down on Bucky’s knot hard enough to keep it inside.
“Steve.” Tony pulls his head away from Steve’s chest, looking up with his absolutely bewitching eyes. “Steve, you didn’t have anything to do with this, right?”
“No, ha, nothing like that. It’s to do with my omega. My priest said I should talk to a friend, which is you, since you’re the only one that’s still speaking to me. I just wanted to get your advice.”
It’s a Vendorian wearing an Andorian suit, and not very well by this point. A red tentacle works its way into Tony’s ass, bright and shining with lubricant. Tony activates the gauntlet for his wrist, nanotech cascading down his arm to form metal around his hand.
“What my body wants has nothing to do with me Steve. I’m saying yes, but this doesn’t mean I’ll be your obedient little wind up toy on the field.” Tony’s words come out sounding desperate, so much so he knows that Steve can hear it. Steve presses down harder, the rigid plane of his body over Tony’s back. It makes Tony shudder again in want, vibrating against Steve, and his anger spikes just as he bucks back and tries to wriggle out from underneath the unfairly large Alpha.
“You’ll find that I can. Legally.” Steve ruffles his hands through Tony’s hair, fondly tugging at the dark locks that Tony hasn’t cut recently. When Tony is good, he’ll let Steve take care of that, of him.
“What happens after this?” Steve is languid as Tony asks his question, his furnace of a body behind Tony, encapsulating him.
Instead he takes a swig of the newly designed shake that JARVIS had researched to help with the poison. It’s a variant of something called the “master cleanse,” and it tastes worse than Dum-E’s usual as he holds it in from spraying the faces of the people around him while he begrudgingly swallows.
He’s dressed by the time the suit arrives, and Tony steps into the suit like a babe in his mother’s embrace. The familiar hum of the suit lights him up, and Tony smiles, closing his eyes as JARVIS takes him to his next destination.
It’s for the best. Rogers is never going to think differently of him, not with Tony’s father haunting them.
“I would do it myself, Sam. I don’t need your threats to remind me how important Steve is. It’s a part of my DNA.”
“They’re not so bad. Maybe a little clumsy, but they look kind of like they belong there in a weird way.” Bruce tried to make things normal, and Tony usually appreciated that, but he’s about ready to tear out all his feathers and leave whatever was left looking like a plucked chicken.
Steve breathes deep and lets his chest fall deeper into himself. His cock starts to take an interest in the proceedings, and he can feel it perk up, the sensation hot as sparks. He doesn’t dare look however, not with Tony here in front of him, breathing and breathing out his nervousness and anxiety. Tony’s eyes are maddeningly close, the heat having wicked color from his eyes, what’s left of the brown bleeding into the black, leaving pinpricks of light in their wake. It’s utterly captivating.
There’s a desperate moment where he thinks he won’t reach her in time, and the thought of that failure almost crushes him but for the anguished hope that he’s not too late.
The Quinjet lands at the SHIELD building and they all disembark. Steve hits the showers before he heads home, feeling wrung out and still so confused. He’s so tired. Tired of being the center of everyone’s scorn. Including Tony’s, still. Even after all the compromises he’s made.
Creating the new Reactor that would go into his chest was a thing never before seen on this earth, a leviathan event of such breadth and complexity, that when Tony finally shoved it into its socket, the Arc Reactor could only respond like Carrie White at the prom, rotating and spewing out energy. Tony thinks it’s the best school dance he’s ever been to.
The studies were limited by the very fact that there were so few Omegas, that Tony didn’t know if his personality was subtly projecting his designation.
“Hanging in there Tony?” Bruce stumbled into the kitchen, pajama pants slung low on his hips and congealing at the ankles, empty mug tilted precariously in his hand.
from what he’s done. It’s almost unforgivable but for the fact he’s done it before with perfect strangers. Let himself use and be used in turn. But this is Captain America, Steve Rogers who is now pounding in and out of him with a fury that encapsulates his designation, Alpha. It renders him inarticulate with feeling.
“Yes, yes, yes, please, I can’t, Bucky!” Babbling, Tony smacks his palms against the wall and braces as Bucky curls his fingers just so. It tears a loud shout from his throat.
“I’m sorry, he seemed like a good man.” Of course he was. He was steadfast, and while Tony didn’t believe the same things as the other man, the conviction with which Coulson did his job was a trait he was well-familiar with. Even if Tony kept his dedication to atonement close to the chest. In a twisted way it’s still selfish, because although he can say he doesn’t put on the suit for himself, the very act of doing so in order to right a wrong is a form of arrogance. And he’s well practiced at playing that.
“Oh? You want to get between a cat and his hunt? Brave wolf. Let’s skip the pleasantries and get to the part where you hand me my letter from Steve.”
Clint just keeps on walking. Steve turns and looks behind him to see the other man stride away with determination.
“Hmm. Evasive answer, but fine. Let’s get this nest settled, shall we?” Tony hefts up a bag of pillows and drags another to his room. Steve grabs the pad, which is a lot heavier and follows behind.
“Tony.” The voice is in his head as much as it’s said aloud. Tony grips his skull with digging fingers.
“Anyone in your life treating you nice, Tony?” Bucky whispers in his ear, the breath from his mouth moist and warm.
“I went out to dinner.” Tony looks at the floor, unwilling to meet Steve’s eyes. Even if he’s repentant, this can’t happen again.
“They were mediocre, of all the -ocres, they were the medi-est.” Yesterday had been a hassle with the meeting. A waste of time, when he had so little. The space between each pill of the suppressants he needed to take was ever-shrinking. In testing the new suppressants he’d been working on when his arc reactor research hit a brick wall, Tony had given himself another month or two before he would have to dose high enough to permanently damage his uterus. Maybe he could take the damn thing out, but even without the uterus, that still left him with heats. Unlike beta biology, removing reproductive organs of Omegas didn’t stop their heats. They dampened them, but Omegas were doomed to have to spend at least a heat a year with an alpha to maintain adequate health.
No, he can’t fall into the false belief that Fury is doing him a kindness. They’ll hold it over him. That was what SHIELD did. But it was something he understood, and could handle.
Tony can’t stop insulting Steve, because if he does, he’ll do more than obey. He’ll be whatever is closest to happy.
“But mom, dad.” Tony grins as he manhandles the undershirt on. He almost mangles the pants until Pepper steadies him, and the undershirt gets buttoned incorrectly at first, which Pepper also fixes.
Steve is unraveled, and he suspects that he’s brought Tony with him. It’s devastating, this closeness and vulnerability. Tony is his now, in every way that matters. The mark stands bloodied on his neck, and his cock makes a valiant twitch inside Tony.
With Iron Man, they start to make much quicker work of the bots. Parts are strewn everywhere and cleanup is going to be a disaster. It also turns out that the power for each bot is decentralized, leading to crawling limbs and kicking legs unattached to anything else. Steve slams his shield again and again, destroying what he can.
“You are evil. You’re just as evil as the Red Skull, except he wouldn’t have cared enough to rape someone.” That hits low on Steve, and he has a brief flicker of doubt. Erskine asked him to be a good man. And he knows he is. If he wasn’t good, he wouldn’t have done this for Tony. With an Alpha, Tony will stabilize, drink less, be able to destress when he’s wound up, and otherwise be an overall happier person. That’s the benefit of a bond. And Tony has a bond with Steve, who would do anything for Tony. Underneath everything, Tony wants him too.
“Ah! Oh yes, ok, um, well, is right here ok? I’d do the booth but we’re already talking face to face, unless you’d like the booth?”
“Ok, I’ve never actually been spanked in my life. Slapped, sure. But this is a new one for me.” Tony scrapes his hand through his hair as he stares down at Steve’s legs like they’re a spider he’s found crawling on the floor.
He runs and runs, scraping himself on tree branches and almost slamming into a tree more than a few times. The moonlight helps him see and he skids between trees as best he can, trying to run in a bit of a zig-zag instead of a straight line. His heart is screaming at him, his lungs scrunched tight to his ribs and aching for breath. Tony’s mouth is dry, debris crusted at the corners of his lips.
“I had neighbors. I saw the difference in the demeanors of the ones who had a firm hand versus the ones who didn’t. I know exactly how omegas are.”
“What can’t you do Tony? Tell me.” He’s gazing into his beloved’s eyes now, noticing that the meat of Tony’s lower lip is red from his teeth pulling at it. He wants to hear Tony whimper as he sucks it into his mouth, but it’s more important to garner Tony’s participation in this.
There’s also the fact that there’s at least ten of them wandering about, knocking over trash cans and breaking into stores. He almost laughs seeing a pig bust into a coffee shop straight through the windows and go for the pastries.
“Nngh– Hypocrite–” Steve chuckled into his pussy, vibrations setting off tingling all the way up to his needy cock.
“—well that’s fine, because I love to be handed things, so let’s trade?” Pepper attempts to hand him the binder and he dodges.
That’s a lot. And everything they have is Kree. The exchange rate alone will gut them of a grand of it.
When he enters the room, the person at the desk is Natasha Romanov. She has a book and packets of paperwork in front of her that she’s holding down with her palms with a closed-off expression.
“I didn’t want to hurt you.” Steve’s eyes are boring into him, the blood on his face accentuating the hollowed-out stare that he’s giving Tony.
So he suppresses, like he’s good at, and flattens his front against the couch, stilling his reflexive urge to rut against it. It takes a good ten minutes, but then Tony drifts off, waking up with a blanket over his back and the automatic lights of the shop dim from lack of movement.
Time has lost some meaning, but Tony knows it’s late. No one will be wandering the halls like he is. He’ll have the best chance of getting to the practice room if he hurries along.
“I always hurt you, don’t I?” Steve asks. He’s panting, exhaustion lining his features, as well as something that looks like regret.
But his mental preparation doesn’t seem to matter when he hears the voices that are in Tony’s room from down the hallway as he makes his way towards the kitchen. His hearing is only just better than Bucky’s, which is good, because the two people speaking are Bucky and Tony.
“So the moral of the story is that I won’t ever do something like that again, and you won’t keep it from me when you find Steve the next time a giant monster tears him out of our suit.”
This is what leads him to Fury’s office on a Sunday, because the guy doesn’t seem to exist outside of SHIELD. Tony thinks he has a perch where he sleeps like an overgrown bat.
Tony’s body is wound up like a spring ready to burst into motion. Steve has to ride it out, match the frantic need of Tony’s heat that’s burning under his skin. Tony’s nipples are straining, little points through the fabric of his shirt, and his cock is slapped flat to his stomach, almost an angry red. Steve pulls his eyes back up to Tony, and the omega’s face is ravenous and hungry with desire.
He’s not sure exactly what that is yet. But as he watches the good Captain trail after Maria with his shield, he thinks maybe he can bring the Captain to him.
“This isn’t about personality profiles anymore.” Fuck that noise, it’s always about who is the most pliable tool while still having enough brains to make their own decisions in combat. He knew the initiative had been scrapped because there’d been no major threats that required cooperative superhero types to solve. Which meant that the first chance Fury got, he would revitalize the Avengers.
“You’re not wrong. You’ve been a terror on my life since you’ve shown up. But you are mine. And I don’t let go of my things that easily. I deserve to have you make it up to me. I want you to grovel, and then I want you to make me feel as good as I need, because it’s justified after your behavior. You don’t get to get away from me. You don’t get to leave me behind.” Tony’s voice is a growl, and he’s taking steps forward, one after another, to stand tall in front of Steve.
As for Tony, he’s so beautiful when he’s filled with sorrow that Steve knows he’s going to draw that expression later. It’s heartfelt and pure, Tony’s crumbling face sluiced with pent-up desire.
When the music cuts out he knows that Pepper or Rhodey are trying to get him out of the shower, so he acquiesces and hops out, toweling off in front of the mirror. He looks lean, almost anemic, but his hips are still Ganymede-narrow and his skin is olive toned, the bones of his clavicle jutting out at appealing angles. It’s not much, he’s never been much, but he isn’t un-fuckable. Sighing, he throws on a pair of boxers and picks up a robe, strolling out into his bedroom.
“Damnit.” Steve paces around the side of the bed, remembering what it was like to be sick to the point of fever. But this is something else.
“You are precious, to be taken care of. I’m taking care of you, and I know you don’t see that right now, but I need you to understand that this is going to be hard at first, but when we’re done, you’ll be much happier.”
“Hmm, I suppose that’s something. Now try not to buy everything.” The sales rep comes back with a stack of fabrics in her arms. Steve reflexively reaches out to touch them.
“Kiss me,” Tony whispers again, and Steve surges up to meet him, taking Tony’s mouth in a sweet kiss, pressing his tongue inside with a tenderness that he’s never felt before. He brings his hand up, gentle and warm on the side of Tony’s neck, and he can feel Tony’s pulse throbbing under it. It makes his own race, and Steve rubs at it, against his neck, trying to keep a rhythm with it. He kisses Tony again and again, lapping up every press of the other man’s lips. They’re warm, soft, and tremulous like the wings of a moth.
and he looks down to see swollen bite marks and scratches. He’d thought that when he punched he felt weaker. Guess he was right. Though the serum has always taken care of his injuries more quickly than this before.
“Steve,” Tony says, and Steve focuses on every facet of Tony then, using his spoken name to draw him into Tony’s curves, the divots of his spine where sweat has collected, the heart shaped frame where Tony’s ass meets Steve’s body. Giving it one last glimpse, he rolls them over to their sides, Tony tucked in front of him, a treasure.
Tony’s pleasure curdles into despair. He’s a werewolf, and he knows in his heart he’s been mated to the wolf that’s on top of him. He’ll track Tony anywhere he goes, for the rest of Tony’s life.
So unlike a slow-motion film, one moment their arms are loose about their captive, and the next they’re holding onto the Kaiju for dear life as it bellows out its pain. The unibeam releases a torrent of pure, unadulterated energy, slamming into the scaly skin of the Kaiju and shredding it like tissue paper. Gleaming blue blood saturates the window in front of them while
On their next mission out, Iron Man behaves perfectly, agreeing to every command on the field. It’s so smooth that Steve thinks something is missing. He realizes it’s their arguments, and he mourns the sass he gets from Tony even as he marvels at the efficiency of their movements. Nat is contemplating him with a savageness that Steve would normally be wary of, if he thought she was any genuine threat. Once again, she can’t say that this isn’t better. Tony is improved, though Steve is worried now about Tony losing himself to some of his Omega instincts.
Steve settles in to read while watching the clock to make sure Tony comes up as he said. It’s hard to concentrate. He’s not used to these modern lines of furniture, the steel, and simplicity of the design in the tower. While he’s been preoccupied with Tony, he hasn’t had time to think about the past. What he should really do, is reach out to Peggy. She would know what to do in this scenario. But he also knows that when he sees her, he’ll see all of his desire for the life he would have had with her in her eyes. The thought of it passing him by derails him.
“And what happens to Anthony at that point?” He flips to the next page, the writing bleeding together as he tries to parse the terms of divorce.
The heat is dying down, and with it Steve’s rut. Steve is petting him, and it feels so good, so very good, that Tony starts to hate it. It’s slow at first, the roiling anger that follows every time Steve’s hands glide down Tony’s skin, but it begins to lap at his conscious mind.
“This is only to get away from my parents. I’m miserable at home, and you guys are the only thing that keeps me sane. I’m here for you, not any other reason.” He makes grabby hands at the flask and Pepper passes it over.
“I want us to talk. Like we always do.” Tony grins widely at the invitation and Steve waits calmly for Tony to launch into whatever sensuous and fascinating speech he has prepared.
The door opens and Steve appears, as though he might not have been the one behind the door all along, or so Tony’s mind tells him.
Tony’s eyes shoot open at some undetermined point in the night and he reflexively tosses his hand to his left, thinking to gently hit Steve’s warm body. But the bed is empty and cold.
He rushes to get ready, tossing on a t-shirt and shorts, grabbing the bundle of pillows and blanket, and rushes over to Tony’s closed door.
As his strength wanes, he starts to pray. Mostly for the souls of these poor creatures, but also that if he should fall, that it’s swift. Painless is too much to ask for at this point.
“I don’t make enough there. And I haven’t lost money in years. I’m a genius, I know how to play the game.” Tony’s hands settle on the counter and his fingers scrunch up momentarily before he removes them again.
Tony is staring at the stove, wearing thin sweatpants and a holey shirt. He rubs the sleep out of his eyes and keeps staring. Steve moves to bring a pan down from the hanging rack and places it on the stove, gesturing for Tony to step up.
This is just–no, Steve’s not done anything wrong, he knows he hasn’t. But it feels like it. It feels like there’s a breeze block sitting atop his chest. He swallows, and his own spittle tastes foreign in his throat, like he’s been crying.
Steve sends the lawyer away and spends the rest of his time researching Tony, determined to get this right.
“And my experience says otherwise.” Steve knows that omegas are the furthest thing from an object. They’re precious, to be cared for, and guided to make good decisions. They have delicate constitutions and they’re not always capable of making the right choices.
“No you’re not.” Steve loops his arms around Tony’s waist and lifts him. Tony whines and writhes in his arms, and Steve plops him back into the center of the bed. He picks up the covers and tosses them back on Tony, who is glaring at him as if he can light Steve on fire with the power of his gaze alone. Tony goes slack then, defeated.
“Don’t thank me yet. The first is that I’m going to say a lot of things I don’t mean during heat. You are not under any circumstances to assume I mean them when I’m done with heat. Is that clear?”
“It’s not nothing. Tell me.” Steve’s voice feels like a pry bar, and Tony wants so badly to just let Steve in on his thoughts.
Floor 37 goes off without a hitch in execution, but the results are savage. Most of the people are already dying of secondary infections, which leaves Bruce synthesizing antibiotics at accelerated rates with limited supplies. Some of them crash to the ground after and don’t wake up again. Others wake and proceed to scream and claw at themselves and everything else in fear.
But when the animal fully leaves the shelter of the leaves, he can see that it’s much bigger than a coyote, and he knows full well from the guide that wolves shouldn't be here.
“Right. Army.” They are so fucked. Out from the hole comes humanoid figures armed to the teeth with alien technology. Tony doesn’t know what their guns or other weapons do, and while he’s not eager to find out from personal experience, he knows he’s here to save as much of New York as he can. It’s what he wants to do; he steels himself before charging at the incoming soldiers, Loki be damned.
When a morning comes where Tony isn’t in the kitchen, Steve waits for an hour before going to look for the omega. He finds himself in front of the closed door to Tony’s room. Steeling himself for it to be locked, he attempts to open it. Surprisingly, it swings open, and Steve sees a lump of blankets on the bed.
Like Brad’s search history, or the fact that Daredevil just destroyed one of his drones for no discernable reason. That man is a pain in his ass.
The walk over to the garage isn’t tense, but it’s not comfortable, either. Tony has always existed in a unique middle ground when it comes to Sam. Tony’s inability to be at Steve’s side when SHIELD has been revealed as HYDRA had soured Sam’s view of Tony. Only years of exposure has led to the two of them falling into this special limbo where they respect each other, trade innocent small talk, and generally have a tentative understanding.
Okay, he can admit he wants Tony. But he won’t take advantage of him or otherwise let the omega know any more than he already thinks he does. Steve has a sinking feeling that Tony’s keen powers of observation are in play here, and that he knows Steve’s sick mind as well as Steve does. God, Tony offered to
“Sir, I have no information on Mr. Rogers’ whereabouts.” Tony’s body roils with tension then, thinking through every possible avenue of where Steve is, and coming up with nothing. Steve has left their home undefended. It’s unlike him.
Finally, he strides towards an oblivious Tony, finding himself standing behind the man’s chair, looking at a computer screen with endless numbers and letters in wild configurations. Steve snaps the hacking device to the back of the chair. It’s close enough.
“Layover my legs, brace yourself with your arms on the floor.” Tony tentatively does that, draping himself across Steve. The omega is barely able to make eye contact, lashes hiding most of his eyes as he stares at the floor. Tony is in the pants of his suit from the ceremony and the wife-beater underneath, still. The shirt is thick, almost too much so, but it looks modest on Tony and Steve approves of that. When Tony is finally laid out over Steve’s legs, his chest tilted towards the ground and the juncture of his hips seated comfortably over Steve’s leg, exposing his ass to the air, Steve is satisfied.
Truly, he thought he’d flown the coop on evolution. Designations didn’t, shouldn’t, matter, and even then the worst offenders were muzzled by political correctness. Discrimination happened institutionally, but not to people like Tony. It made his decision to not tell everyone he was Iron Man that much more difficult. Yet he couldn’t deny that while the people who had attempted to bend Tony to their will were either incapable, or dead, if the military put their mind to it, Tony was certain they’d find a way. They’d find out about his little situation with heats through basic sleuthing. And if they did, Tony wouldn’t put it past them to regulate their way into his bed. He could take suppressants for only so long, and the timing for publicly and privately available suppressants were well documented. Frankly he wasn’t sure exactly what they would do, but he didn’t want to find out before getting the rest of his house in order.
“JARVIS, find me a way into that ooey gooey center.” Tony’s decided to take one of the big dogs—whales—on. It’s teeth look like sharpened dinner plates in its narrow, reptilian head. If he could catch it in the eye, that would be a major win. But as he gets close, he realizes he doesn’t see any.
Steve was almost interested in seeing how Anthony would react now that Steve was in charge of his life.
It’s then that Steve grabs his shoulder with a hand, hauling him back to press Tony’s back to his chest, the other hand a perfect slot into the juncture of his leg and hip, pulling tight. The thrusts are short, shocking, no less re-making than they were before, and Steve uses the opportunity to tell him so.
“Yes, I know who you are; the Omega who wants to be a warrior. All out of place. What do you think your team will say when they find out what you really are?” Now, Fury may not have a problem with Tony being Omega, but he won’t be helping him deal with the public in a meaningful way for Tony. Anything to cover SHIELD’s ass will be the order of the day.
“Thank you.” Then she steals his champagne, which is most definitely his security blanket. He’s going to have to have a
He’s gotten his Arc Reactor for the tower online, however. It’s party time for Pepper and him, which is so not how he used to get down, but these days he’s practically domesticated. So of course, Agent Coulson shows up to crash his party.
“Sorry buddy. Unless you’ve seen a 5’8” mouthy human brunet, you can scram.” He tries not to imagine this wolf gnawing on his friend, but it’s the thought of it that makes him feel irrationally angry, and he grabs another stick, tossing it at the wolf harder. It hits the wolf on his side, which causes it to whine sadly before it dips back into the bushes.
You know that’s what I love about living now, in this time though? I can tell you all of this. Back then, it was shameful. Us omega women stuck together as best we could, and we tried to get some of the male omegas into our clutches too, but some of their mothers wouldn’t have it. Thought they were protecting their children from the worst of it, I think. And maybe they were, what with male omegas being allowed in the army at the time. A lot of us were going through it together. Brenna and Colleen had it the worst. I always wondered what happened to them. We all did our best, smiled pretty outside, but inside, things weren’t right.”
“It’s the lack of effort on that last insult that really gets me, Cap. There’s nothing wrong with being an Omega in arms manufacturing, even if I don’t personally want to do it. Oh look, you’re going to make the face again. Jaw all tight with your eyes boring holes through me. Sorry cupcake, you’ll never get the satisfaction of my guilt.” They’re left glaring at each other, Tony rolling his eyes even though he wants to stride right up to Rogers and show him how much more creative he can be with his words.
“Um, yes, well, I have a brochure for you, if you ever need to call, or you can give it to your omega.”
This is just one of the many things that SHIELD won’t be getting. Tony is suspicious of the now-cancelled Avenger’s initiative being a play to get him off the team when Fury had agreed to let him join.
His options limited, he figures he can outrun or otherwise dodge whoever is outside until he makes it to higher ground. He’s got to try, anyway. Shoving a few of the creatures away from him, their grasping hands sliding off his skin, he makes it through the doorway. And ends up in a warzone.
“But I’ve been horrible to him. He couldn’t possibly want to spend it with me. And besides, I’ve never, well, I’ve never been with anyone. I wouldn’t know what to do!”
Tony makes adorable, sensuous little noises: little mewls, low moans, high-pitched little cries. Tony is taking Steve
Things are going so well that he has time to imagine other pursuits. He taps into the cameras around SHIELD and looks for a particular blond as he slips from stream to stream. There’s good reasons for this, he knows. Captain America could put a damper on his plans, and he doesn’t want that. But the even better reason is that maybe it’s time to do something about his crush.
“Oh, I’m sure you’re the best of men. Got yourself an omega you’re trying to do right by? I can see their mark on your neck.” She points one gnarled finger at it.
“I’ll have what he’s having.” It’s not the greatest beginning to picking up a human, but Tony has long since discovered that many races may not grasp sarcasm or innuendo, but they do understand the base language of exchanging goods and services. Which means all of Tony’s charm is for naught. He always runs in cold and tries to come out hot.
Tony is as competent with sandwiches as he said, and he makes a half one for himself, gobbling it down, before scurrying back to the lab. Steve could have asked that he make a full sandwich, or clean up, but so far he’s satisfied with the progress they’re making.
With Steve on his back as they take off, Tony worries it’s the Omega in him that wants Steve. He’s the perfect specimen of a man. Like the world decided this is what an Alpha ought to look like and poured charisma and goodness into a mold, and out popped Steve Rogers, last bastion of the American dream.
“You’re mine, sweet thing. I’ll take care of you, I promise.” It’s so, so validating to hear that from Steve. God, Tony loves the man.
Steve’s hand slides down Tony’s ribcage, fingers digging into his sides. Steve has all of his back panels off, including the ones covering his ass. Testing, Tony moves a leg, trying to gain some leverage to get out from under Steve. Instead, Steve responds by hooking his feet over Tony’s ankles.
“Nah it’s not surprising, I get it, you don’t have to make any excuses.” Her face transforms at his words, and she moves forward to contradict him.
He trudges off away from his guide and walks through the trees, which are mostly pine. He doesn’t even recognize any of it, though this is exactly where they had camped last time. He’ll never go dispersed camping again. Hell, he’s not even sure if he’ll camp ever again. Pepper hasn’t forgiven him, and he hasn’t forgiven himself.
Steve tentatively enters the room, allowing the door to open slowly. He’s greeted with the sight of Tony in boxers and a t-shirt cuddled up amidst his nest. Tony added all the blankets from his bed too, it seems. He’s in a swirl of fabric, and he looks breathtakingly adorable. His hair is mussed in every direction and he looks at Steve, wide-eyed.
Tony falters, and Steve thinks that maybe the fact that Tony could go into heat disturbs him. Steve should leave before a negative emotion latches itself onto Steve’s presence. The last thing he wants is for Tony to associate the fear of becoming Omega with Steve. Because if Tony even attempts to pick another Alpha besides Steve, he may lose his cool and challenge someone to a dominance fight. Tony is his now. These three practically blissful weeks of taking care of Tony’s needs have shown that. The path in front of him burns brighter than ever with rightness and impending satisfaction.
He palms the front of his sweatpants, willing his erection to subside. He thinks of Tony when he was sick, and his mind helpfully supplies that sweet-scented smell of heat for his efforts. He tries thinking of church, of his prayers, but instead, his mind shows him, Tony, kneeling in the confessional with him, mouth sloppy and open, his eyes half-lidded, the shadows of the screen playing across his face. It’s at that point his palm turns into a sure grip, and he’s halfway to jacking himself through his pants.
He won’t mention the mutual funds for now. Whether Tony is knowledgeable or not, it’s better to be conservative in investing. It still boggles his mind that Tony can even afford to play on the market at all.
The door doesn’t open and she can hear voices inside. Impatient, she uses the codes she stole one time from Maria, and forces the door open.
Days go by and Clint is still unresponsive to stimuli. But his wounds are healing slowly, the swelling retreating back into his skin.
“Make your move, Reindeer games.” Captain comes to stand next to him, agitated. Tony thinks the Captain could handle a little more tossing around. Maybe straight into Tony’s unoccupied fantasies. He curbs that impulse as soon as it crops up. The time for a pubescent boy’s indulgences is not while there’s a genuine super villain on his knees in front of them.
“Let’s not talk about it. It was good, wasn’t it? You enjoyed it?” Does it matter that he enjoyed it?
“Let me in, Steve. I know how hot you run. JARVIS told me.” Tony graces Steve with his back, pushing on his arms with it so that Steve is forced to open them. He does so, letting them fall around Tony’s smaller frame. He tucks the omega back to his chest and breathes in the scent of Tony. It’s sweeter, like ripening fruit, and with the hint of metal and something that is Tony’s exclusively. There’s no cologne today, but the whisper of it on Tony’s skin is still there. He latches his chin over Tony’s shoulder and presses the rest of his chest against Tony, careful to avoid his hips so that he doesn’t alert Tony to his body’s aroused state.
“Talk to Tony, ok?” He smacks the bottle on the table in front of him, and Steve makes to swipe it away before Bucky can change his mind. Bucky grabs tighter to the bottle as Steve closes his fingers around Bucky’s fist.
“Good, because we’re leaving him with you to monitor the situation, given that your actions lately have been more than questionable. However, we’re still taking the Teen Abomination into custody.”
When Steve wakes up in the morning, he wraps the sheets around his prone form, trying to get the last of his scent rubbed off onto them. It’s the day of the gala, Saturday, and he’s got his suit ready in the shower for steaming. It’s 0600 hours, his usual wakeup time, and for once he doesn’t feel like going on a run. He doesn’t want to leave Tony that unprotected for that long.
They fire from behind him as he weaves and dodges, managing to take out a few. Rhodey is in his ear, frozen in the suit, but he can’t think about that right now with the repulsor blasts being aimed at his head.
The letter shakes in his hand. Tony breathes, controlled huffs of air, in, out, in, until he feels stable again.
Steve turns the shower back on hot and closes the door to the bathroom to let his suit unwrinkle. He stares at his room and feels emptiness threaten to swallow him whole.
When he pulls away, there’s something fathomless in Tony’s dark eyes as he stares at Steve. His expression is blank, devoid of happiness or anger. It’s unnerving, but it doesn’t last long because Tony moves in, reaching up to Steve’s open gland with his mouth.
“I understand.” Omegas being with omegas were common when he was young. Some omegas wanted to spend heat with their kind. It was allowed and encouraged when an alpha couldn’t get time off work. It looks like that hasn’t changed much.
“Love to hear you beg for it. Omega.” He whispers against Tony’s spine, fingers scissoring into Tony, who can feel how sloppy-loose he is. Tony doesn’t need Steve’s fingers. He wants Steve to impale him on his cock already, and proceeds to keen again, high and needy.
He goes to look in on Tony and he’s met with the hard faces of medical personnel who usher him away from the room. His chest clenches with a feeling that he doesn’t have a name for.
Tony is aware that if Steve is with him, inside of him, he shouldn’t feel any sense of concern or fear. But it’s been 72 hours. Steve hasn’t turned up in any hospitals. No body has been found. The last time he saw him, the last time he saw Steve, it was on the battlefield. The moment sits in his mind with crystal clarity, the very moment that he failed to save Steve, to protect him.
Tony pulls the needles out after he’s given a couple of pints, which would make a normal man dizzy, but only moderately inconveniences him. Clint is now breathing normally, and his wounds have puffed up as Steve’s did. Bruce takes a sample of Clint’s blood and finds that Steve’s antibodies are going to work on the virus inside of Clint. He just needs time and rest.
“Um, yes, but many have starved. They won’t eat each other until there’s nothing else to consume. There’s no reason I can tell why they turn on one of their own kind, but eventually, they do. It’s—it’s hard to remember they’re people. My employees.” Tony’s eyes focus on some distant point across the room, and Steve can’t imagine what that must be like. He had one interaction with the woman in the room he’d been placed in, and that was enough. Even though he didn’t know her, he thinks he’ll see her in his nightmares.
“You’ll be making dinner tonight.” Tony is digging in the fridge, and he pulls out a smoothie that’s already pre-made for him.
“Well, the first heat’s too painful without your alpha. It’s meant to bring you closer. Bet you must be wondering then how come I didn’t have children. Weren’t for lack of Conall’s tryin’.” Tony is strong. He’ll want to do it alone, his heat.
Tony starts hardening even more in Steve’s mouth, and he knows that Tony is getting close. He sucks more forcefully, not breathing in anything but Tony. Tony whimpers, a little broken sound, and Steve can see his head fall back, hair sweat-slicked to his forehead, the elegant outline of his beard tracing a well-groomed path along his chin.
The strings in Tony’s heart pull taut, the power and certainty behind Sam’s threat evident. But Tony isn’t a pushover, and never has been, even with this weird moment existing between them.
“Maybe—maybe I should have let us order in every so often just to make sure he was eating. But also it undermined his learning.”
“You really have got a lid on it, haven’t you? What’s your secret? Drum circle? Capoeira? A big bag of weed?” He ignores the Captain and refers to Bruce for the sake of agitating the man. Steve has such confidence; he wants to
“Steve. I have had a hard, lonely, miserable life, and the only thing that makes it worthwhile is wearing this suit. You can’t ask me to stop, Steve. No matter what.”
Tony’s body twists up and bends forward as he comes, his ass leaking around Steve as his cock spurts onto Steve’s chest. Letting go is easy, and Steve knots Tony right there at the climax of Tony’s orgasm, burying himself as deep as he can go and releasing streams of come.
“Uh, sorry Steve, I–” Steve strokes a hand down Tony’s hair, letting it rest on the other man’s neck, heavy. It’s so good that he has Tony in his arms that he wants to forget there’s one more week to wait before Tony will be begging for him. He’s going to have to hold out until then.
“But well, let’s get down to business here, shall we? You want to know how it was for us omegas in the past. Well, it wasn’t all peaches and cream living in the heart of the Apple, let me tell you. I was a real looker those days though. All my sisters said so. I was a cat looking to be a canary when I met Conall. He had this way of talking that made me feel like he saw every part of me.
“And the ceremony will take place a week from now?” Steve is still getting used to being out of the ice, and the cold of the conference room nips at his skin. He wants out of here as soon as possible and away from this problem that won’t seem to go away. What he wants is to see what’s left of his home in Brooklyn. To walk the streets and see if he can capture some of the life he had before. He knows it will be a pale imitation, but he can’t stop himself from wanting.
“I don’t like being handed things.” The wrong scent from an Alpha on his skin could trigger a heat. It’s an uncommon, but documented side effect of long term suppressant use. He doesn’t shake hands either, though Omegas are never expected to for scenting reasons. Tony is very careful with what he touches.
“And I don’t do kind, Shellhead.” With that, he brutally shoves in both fingers at the same time, wrenching open Tony at the rim. And Tony, he just gives way, bearing down and opening on Steve’s fingers as he fucks them in and out ruthlessly. He spits on his moving hand, watching the gob of saliva work its way into Tony’s dusky entrance. No more than a cursory amount of time is spent opening Tony up before Steve is reaching into the swirling mass of the symbiote and undoing his pants, pulling his fully erect cock out. He gets up, crouching over Tony.
No, Tony Stark can’t be left to his own devices, it seems. That’s when SHIELD shows up on his private property, finally.
all his life with the use of hormones. It was why he and Steve constantly fought for dominance over the team, their decisions split down the middlemost missions. It was why they were here. Because Tony couldn’t listen.
He hears it as well as feels it in the warm breath that’s in his ear. The other wolf goes for his nape then, and it feels so good to be bitten there, that Tony immediately droops into compliance.
Loki puts his hands up and it’s all over, though it shouldn’t be. Tony thinks that Loki must have something else up his sleeve, and he wants to insult the man by grabbing him by the horns to see if he does anything about it.
“It’s because I care for Tony that I did this.” He spreads his arms to drive home his point. He has nothing to hide. There is no ulterior motive than the one he’s given.
Tony is as pliant as he’ll get before he takes Steve’s knot. He can’t do anything to genuinely hurt Steve anymore, and he knows it. It’s enough to make Steve let him go, and Tony, his achingly beautiful Tony, doesn’t take up hitting him again.
Steve feels a sudden rush of too much similarity between himself and Angela’s husband. No, Steve never intended nor intends to make Tony bear his children, but the idea that Angela, who seemed to be a hardworking omega with a good head on her shoulders, had her money and job taken upsets him. Tony makes more than he does, he knows that, but Steve controls his birth control. He remembers signing the sheets that allowed it when he signed the contract, but he hasn’t thought about it since. There’s something wrong with how these laws put Steve in charge of Tony’s body. Steve has decided to stop controlling so much of what Tony does, but it hadn’t occurred to him that an alpha could choose to keep doing that, no matter what the results were. And that feels as wrong as spanking Tony had been.
“Here, let me help.” Nat starts going through the pile, rapid-fire, pulling fabric left and right. She makes three piles, most of which go into the first pile. “Ok, none of these.” She shoves the first pile away.
Bucky is writhing on the floor now, his metal arm barely attached at the seams. Tony has a vicious sense of satisfaction at the thought that the metal hand would no longer be an option for the Winter Soldier. Nothing should be an option for him, if Tony can help it.
“And what if your serum eradicates the memory block, and you remember? I still won’t, Stevie. And won’t that just be awkward for you?” Tony says. Tony figures if he could just get a leg free, he could make a break for the door. Sure it was locked, but that was a very near future Tony’s problem. Screw Steve’s rut, but not literally.
And then there’s Steve. What would Steve think of Tony taking advantage of his friend? They’re not getting along, but that doesn’t mean you stop being friends. Steve would be so mad. He’s already gone out of his way to do Tony favors. He’ll think that Tony is greedy and that his lust can’t be contained. That’s too close to the truth, given his thoughts about the both of them.
Tony thinks it’s nothing less than soulmates. To believe otherwise is to court the idea that there’s no good place in this world for them. No use for their state of being besides being jaeger pilots. And if that’s all they are, Tony isn’t sure he wants to exist like that.
“Yes. Tony does a lot of things.” Natasha taps her fingers on the desk in front of her and shifts in her seat.
After they land on the carrier, Tony tries to discreetly make off so he can remove the suit and be on time for whatever meeting they’re having about Loki. He’s also having trouble keeping his mouth shut around Cap. This is a strategic retreat, or so he tells himself.
“Yes, yes fine, now if you’re done speaking, don’t you have a job to do?” Tony is vicious with his words. He wants Cap to know. It feels like walking into a minefield when he says it. He doesn’t know what comes next.
The bag stayed pressed to his face moments too long; Nick gently reached out to take the package from Tony’s clawed hand, his single eye knowing. Tony watched the bag move away from him in slow motion, a wistful future spiraling down and away.
Even as Fury used Coulson’s death to try and bind them, Tony resented it. He wasn’t made for this. He lied as needed, fought and bit out insults as a default. There was no way he was equipped for this.
“For this month, yes. We’re a little short-staffed. We’ll be seeing a new priest soon. An omega! I’m very excited. As a beta, I always have trouble reaching them, even though we’ve been helping omegas for years. They have reason to be scared though, I suppose. But! It’ll be good to have an omega around to help guide the flock.”
He was ok. Tony was ok with it. He’d never spent a heat with someone, and while he knew in concept what he was missing, it didn’t matter. He wanted it not to matter.
“You promised never to do it again!” Tony whines at his AI, captivating Steve with his already burgeoning sweetness. Alpha Tony sasses JARVIS with some amount of aggression. This halfway Tony is already more openly affectionate. Sweet, even. Steve sits down on the couch before Tony can see the swelling outline of his pants.
“Only if I agree to divorce or otherwise annul the marriage, which I don’t.” Steve has made a lot of spur of the moment decisions in his life. So far so good on that, and he’s not stopping now. Anthony needs him. He needs someone to bring him in line. It’s the least he can do for Howard’s memory. It may be a shadow of a life, but it is a task that will take up his time.
It’s only in Tony that he can lose himself, lose the past. Inside Tony, there is no loss, no drifting, or feelings of inadequacy. He’s sure he’s with the right person, doing the right thing, living the right life when Tony is in his arms.
“Four. Thank you.” When Steve does it again, this time Tony presses hard on his leg with his hips, and through the fabric, Steve can feel that the omega is becoming erect.
“And you’ll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss.” Tony pokes and prods before spinning the screen to face Fury. “What’s phase 2?” Which is when Steve walks in and steals his thunder by slamming a bizarre looking assault rifle on the table. He looks pissed, and Tony has to give the man some credit for doing work to find out on his own that Tony was right, although he’s not likely to give Tony the satisfaction of having been right in the first place. Alphas. Can’t be shown up by Omegas, no siree.
No one drifts alone and ends up okay. They should have stopped Tony’s delusions a lot sooner. Should have seen what was coming. But there was something so inspiring and pure about the two of them that Tony’s belief in their combined soul had never been a detriment to a mission before. It’s what made them good. It made them the best.
It hits him then that wolves are dangerous predators, and he probably shouldn’t be encouraging this behavior. He very carefully leans down and picks up a stick before tossing it at the wolf, who stops in his tracks.
“He’s my AI butler. I wasn’t going to introduce you because you’ve been a total asshole, but it seems like you’re losing a bit of that with all the efforts that SHIELD has been making.”
Really, Tony should get over it. It was an earlier hurt than Sunset. It was small and stupid, like they had been.
Tony isn’t unsympathetic to those who want Extremis full-time. Well, he is lacking in empathy, but he knows how to play a crowd. They want more free Extremis. Tony wants more addicts for his product so they spend more money. He can make it happen, easily.
He thanks Thor and makes his way back to medical, hoping that Tony will tell him he can give more blood for the cure.
“He’s my friend.” Cap is on the ground now, and he looks up at Tony with imploring eyes, a warning that what comes next will be the end of things. Tony doesn’t heed it.
They both go at each other, almost competitive in their movements. Steve twists his head as he pulls up and twists it back as he goes down. Tony opts for tightening his mouth as he squeezes the base of Steve’s cock with it. It makes him want to feel what it would be like to be inside Tony in another way. They both start to thrust minutely, keeping in time with one another’s movements. Steve doesn’t want it to end, but he’s eager to nail Tony to this bed with his cock, make the man feel it for days.
“He’s a businessman, and I tend to interact with them fairly regularly. It should be fine. Just… don’t do it again.”
“I think it’s almost time. Come to the nest with me?” Tony asks him like Steve is going to say no. He could never say no to Tony.
“Come on Steve, Tony’s a jerk, but he’s not wrong. Tell me this doesn’t smell a little funky to you?” Oh it’s Steve is it? He has a momentary flare of judgment for Banner, but he reasons that the other scientist is on his side and is just doing his best to relieve the tension.
Bucky litters more kisses on Tony’s neck, suckling and kneading the flesh between his teeth. It’s so close to his mating gland that he can’t resist, and instead whimpers pitifully while Bucky dominates him. The alpha’s hands are everywhere: trailing at his waistline, caressing his ass, and digging into his thighs.
“Yes, Father. But if you have any advice at all on how to get him to see that he should be the kind of omega people look up to, I’d appreciate it.”
“So beautiful. You’ve always been a looker, even when you weren’t hiding how sweet you are.” Steve cracked a smile, before settling back into his heated, possessive gaze.
At this point, he consciously knows the odds. Knows there’s no chance if it were anyone but Steve and they were anyone but them. But it is them. They’ve been through worse.
“Tony, this is enough. It’s enough to get you taken out of the jaeger program until you prove you have the mental capacity to endure it. This needs to stop. I’m trying to help you.”
Steve’s eyes widen and his military parade rest crumbles. Steve brushes her aside and leaps towards the training centers.
. Want me to get on my knees, show you my neck. You marked it, it’s yours. You could take me now right here, on this floor. I’m such a whore you know I couldn’t deny you what’s yours by right. I mean, I’ve probably taken loads of knots, right? You want yours to be the one I remember.” Tony finishes his rant with his breath puffing up into Steve’s face. Every word has his hair standing on end. The scent alone will haunt his dreams. His breathing is shallow and he’s ungodly hard in his underwear, which is thankfully tight enough to keep most of his mass hidden from Tony. But it’s not enough. Tony looks down and a sly smile crosses his face.
“You had better tell me what this is all about before I make you regret it. Or should I make Bucky regret helping you?” The mug hits the counter as she steps forward into his space, red hair cascading down her back as she pitches her head back to look up at him. There’s a promise in her eyes, one that’s destructive. One that she can make good on against both Bucky and Steve.
“I’m not sure you know how honest I’m going to be. But I think—I think I look forward to showing you.” Honest to god, Tony doesn’t really know what they’re talking about. He thinks that Steve is going to bash his head in, pull out the shield, and just do it. Make sure that Tony can never harm Barnes ever again. He’s going to die here, alone in the cold with a bunch of dead super soldiers. FRIDAY is gone, and there’s no one else here.
“I won’t lie to you. But I’m not able to talk about it either.” Steve is ensconced on the couch, a pencil and sketch book in hand. He’s been drawing a rather obscene image of a nude Tony laying on Steve’s bed, legs tucked up to his chest. Some parts of it he has to leave to his imagination, but so very soon he’ll know Tony in entirety. He can hardly wait.
He presses into his lover’s slick heat then, head popping inside as he pulls in more of Tony’s slick around his dry cock with a spare hand. Tony groans and tries to push himself up and off, but Steve sinks deeper, reveling in the hot glove of Tony’s channel.
Steve chuckled and manhandled Tony to the bed, forcing him flat on his stomach. Tugging at Tony’s pants, Tony got with the program and unbuttoned and unzipped himself, letting the legs slide over his skin until he’s down to his boxers and a shirt. Steve made short work of the former, leaving Tony exposed. His wings flap once, twice, before settling out on either side of him.
“Enough with the nicknames.” The goodwill drifts away from Steve’s face, and Tony forlornly remembers a time when he didn’t have to deal with people.
There was a conscious disconnect between the idea of his wings being erogenous zones, enough to screw with his sense of what’s a sexual touch, but the thought was now percolating to the surface of his mind and sending waves of frisson to every part of his body that craved Steve’s touch. His nipples, cock, ass, even innocuous spots like the back of his neck or the interior of his thighs are now hunted with phantom sensation.
“I’ll see you for dinner tonight?” Tony asks, his arms slung around Steve’s shoulders like he belongs there. Tony’s body is pressed tight to the back of his, and Steve relishes the closeness. He’s stunned that he’s receiving any affection at all after he’s certain that Nat and Bucky have told Tony what Steve has done.
to play it, of course, to demonstrate, and Steve had become somewhat fond of the soundtrack, downloading parts of it to the Starkpod that Tony had given him.
learn to cook for yourself. You also haven’t done laundry since we’ve been married. It’s been more than two weeks. You’ll work on that tomorrow until it’s done.”
“All water under the bridge Caperoni and cheese.” He waves his hand and takes a tentative step forward. God, Steve is beautiful. In all his avoidance, he’d somehow forgotten that the man was flawless.
How fair was it that something that meant so much to him was just another Omega for Steve? He’s probably one Omega in a line of them who have been serviced by the man. Steve was only saying what his idiot Omega side wanted to hear. That he was wanted, unique, adored. That he was accepted.
He’s not hiding in the containment area now, per se, but he’s not interested in company either. Which is of course where the Captain finds him.
His morose thoughts are interrupted by the beeping of their homemade, All-American Tesseract finder. As the majority of the group follows Bruce over to the terminal, Tony makes to leave, hoping to get to his suit.
“So this is about money?! What about the creation of an underclass of people that don’t have access to Extremis?”
“Steve, Steve please,” Tony mumbles. Steve instinctively lifts Tony up and off him and places him on his hands and knees. “Steve, please, I’ve been so good,” Tony cries.
“We can’t become paralyzed in our decision making when the call is not ours to make. You have to extend trust to him, that he knows what he’s doing. You give that fear, that unknowable element, over to him, as his partner, his lover.” He shudders, his body going molten thinking about being Tony’s lover and sliding down between those olive-toned thighs into a kind of heaven he’s only read about. But he’s not Tony’s. Though maybe if Tony wants him to be, he could.
“No, it’s not. You don’t know anything about us! We’re not these automatons who only do housework and cooking! Some of us can’t. Why can’t you see that?” Tony’s eyes look watery as he speaks, and he’s hugging himself, perched on the edge of a couch. Steve’s chest feels tight with stress. His alpha side doesn’t like seeing an omega like this, but he represses it.
“Lay on your front, please,” Steve says, soft. A spasm of heat moves through Tony at the request, and as he rolls himself into position, the warmth hits every joint and tendon before flaring through his chest. With his chest pressed to the cushions, he finally stills and waits.
“You call it compromise, but I don’t have a choice.” Steve resents that Tony’s defeat is his victory. There’s something disturbing about how the man folds in on himself during these conversations.
it on you. You want to knot me? I’ll fight you every step of the way. You can beat me, starve me, ruin my finances, and even my company. But I will never give you the satisfaction of having me.” Tony’s eyes are glowing in the well-lit entryway, and they look even more backlit with the fervor Tony’s words. Steve can’t help but settle his gaze on the omega, even as he keeps his arms crossed and his body taut with tension. Tony is borderline feral, his lips curved into a sharp enough sneer to cut glass. God help him, but his body is responding to Tony’s threats, his cock stiffening in his pants. It’s taking so much of his thought process to not push Tony down to the floor, grab his neck in a vice grip, and pin him for the taking.
“This is how it’s going to go. You’re both going to date me, exclusively, and you’re going to be at least cordial with each other, or neither of you are going to date me.”
Confusion and anger battle inside of him for the briefest of moments as his eyes rove over the unoccupied space before he spots it: an innocent piece of paper where Steve’s head should be on the pillow. Of all the things that definite Tony, curiosity sits at the top of the list. He’s a cat, after all. His tail swishes back and forth, the reflex automatic as he sits up on the bed, tired eyes searching for something to pounce on. Tony pulls the folded paper apart with his claws and comes face-to-face with Steve’s perfect, early 1900s penmanship.
“Tony.” It’s in a place like this that Steve suddenly feels insecure. Like he doesn’t belong. He is admittedly impressed that Tony does feel comfortable here, and seems to know what he’s doing. He wonders who taught him all of this. Maybe it was Howard, though it doesn’t seem like technology would have progressed that much during Howard’s time. Not if the history books he’s been reading are to be believed.
He’s so sorry. Sorry that he ever laid a hand on Tony. That he ever tried to control his habits, his clothing, his money. Speaking of, he has to tell Tony to do whatever he wants with
It’s faultless; Tony doesn’t flinch or otherwise turn on Steve with a harsh and grating insult. Tony lets Steve’s groin pass unhindered near his ass, the front of Steve’s zipper just barely brushing the back of Tony’s jeans as he slinks by with the bowl in hand.
“But you said—” Tony said that he had always loved Steve. Which in retrospect is interesting in that Tony has never acted as though he loved Steve and their marriage is only a few months old.
Tony showers in the bathroom that’s in the shop and throws on a spare set of clothes he keeps for when he crawls out of his workshop after these benders.
It’s dark when Steve wakes up. Tony is a tangled pile of limbs next to him that’s shaking and shuddering. The cloying smell of slick rises up from the bed and permeates Steve’s senses. Steve feels unmoored, a lost ship floating, ghostlike over the water.
“Tell me to fuck you. Tell me where you want me.” Steve is running his hands over Tony, his ass, thighs, back. Wherever the man can reach as he has Tony pinned to the bed. It’s compulsive, reverent with need. Now, it doesn’t seem like so much of a battle over Tony’s body, but a protracted siege.
At first, he loved my singing. I would serenade him sunup to sundown. But when I started trying my hand at the speakeasy, oh boy he sure didn’t like that much at all. I loved him though, so I stopped. Though I’d always wanted to be a singer, and I was darn good at it too! Used to sing in the choir at mass.” Steve remembers. Edith’s voice was clear and beautiful, ringing out over the parishioners like a clarion bell. He thinks he agrees with Conall though. A speakeasy is no place for a lady.
“Just a– I’ll fucking kill him.” Nat stood at attention then, eyes glued to the door that was still jiggling as Tony tossed himself bodily against it. The room inside would be destroyed by the end, bedding clawed up and clothes torn to shreds. This was a particularly bad one by Steve’s estimates. He usually didn’t get violent with Pepper.
“Hey big guy.” Now he knows he shouldn’t feed it, but it’s rather cute, and doesn’t seem to be afraid of him. It also looks like it’s alone, which is odd in and of itself. Wolves run in packs, but this guy doesn’t have anyone with him.
“You are already good, Tony. Shh, sweetheart.” Steve latches back on once more and moves his hand around to touch the front of Tony’s pants. He’s met with Tony’s hard cock, which isn’t sized like he is, but is firm and warm with arousal. He rubs at it and is rewarded with sweet little keening noises from Tony. His omega is so gorgeous, so beautiful. How could he ever hurt him?
This is the hardest thing he’ll ever do. He doesn’t know what is going to happen, and if Tony agrees to what he’s proposing, where he’ll end up. Knowing the right thing to do and acting on it is beyond difficult; it seizes his body up in paroxysms of fear and want. He wants to turn back, leave, pretend as if he’s not going to do this. He wants to unravel history, go back to the first moment he saw Tony and stick out his hand in greeting instead of what he’s done.
“Enough of this. You’re not to leave the tower unless it’s on SI business, and you’re done having unsupervised time in the workshop. No more sandwiches either. You
Steve is rubbing Tony’s head and shoulders, reminding him not to forget the other man as Bucky pounds into him with vicious abandon.
It’s almost good that they hate each other because that keeps them from seeing what’s probably obviously written on Tony’s face: he likes them both.
The heat was searing now, burning his nerves into waves of hot need. He crawled towards Steve, one hand in front of the other on the dirty cement floor. Steve waited with fraught patience, arms crossed tightly across his chest. He looked as though if he moved, he would jump Tony. It made him preen; he was beautiful for his alpha. Somewhere inside, another part of him howled in despair.
Those words run through him like refrigerant in his veins. He’s always said that Tony was cherished. That Tony needed minding. But instead, he’s thinking of himself as Alex and he’s revolted. Alex said he loved his omega, but he so easily gave her up when she became inconvenient. And there was no protection for her to ensure that didn’t happen.
“Steve look at this! I’m so stressed my body is producing Omgesterone. Pretty wild, yeah?” Tony’s face is pink and he’s clutching his hair in his hand as he rubs his fingers through the strands. His muscles are tense and he’s tapping his fingers on the counter to the side of him. Steve is reassured that Tony isn’t suspicious, but that doesn’t mean he won’t figure it out. He isn’t sure if synthetic hormones show up the same way as regular ones do. He’d ask Bucky, but he doesn’t think that his friend would be pleased to find out that Steve hadn’t talked to Tony, at all, about this plan.
“In my experience, it’s generally best to listen to the person in question about what it is they want and need. Just forget that he’s an omega, and treat him like he’s your equal.”
It’s just his luck that the guy gets up again, and when the lighting hits, he’s sure he’s a goner. The beam heats the armor to maximum, the burn inside the suit immediately causing him to sweat and overheat. It’s like drinking out of a fire hose. But when it stops, JARVIS kindly informs him that he’s overpowered by, like, a lot. The repulsor blast that comes out is ridiculously powerful, smashing into the man at top speed and bringing him to his knees.
“Steve, yes, please, please, please.” Tony is chanting now, his words coming out in soft little mewls. As Steve positions himself behind Tony, he can’t resist looking down between their bodies. Steve groans when he sees Tony’s wet hole dripping spend and slick between his perfectly curved cheeks. He reaches out to touch the pucker of Tony’s hole as Tony tries to back into it, moaning and looking for friction.
“It’s never too late to try Nat. You did the best you could.” Bruce’s voice was soft, and it made Steve lurch into awareness that this shouldn’t have happened.
“Pancakes?” Steve tries. Lips pressed flat, Tony sets his mug down in a punctuated motion, his jaw set in that usual stubborn way of his, his eyes boring into Steve’s.
And he’s huge, like, Tony is doing eyeball measurements and it’s like the head alone is over a foot long. Wait, can the heads be that big? Because this guy is big. He probably stands up to Tony’s torso. Which, all of those thoughts are not the ones he should be having right now. He should be getting out of here. Maybe he can toss a stick or something ridiculous like that.
“You should have seen Stern’s face when he had to give Rhodey and me that medal. There weren’t any cameras facing that direction when he shook each of our hands, which was a grievous error on my part.” Tony’s face is lit up, his joy in the story infectious but for the malaise that’s laying over Steve.
“I hate seeing you like this.” Is all Steve says. He looks defeated, shoulders slumped and his face screwed up tightly, lips pursed with what is likely disgust.
Steve surges forward and kisses Tony roughly, mouthing at his lips, then chin, and throat. He moves down in a wave, taking first one nipple, then the other into his mouth and plucking at them with his wet lips. Tony never said he couldn’t do it through the shirt, so he hopes he’s not crossing a line.
“Fuck.” His gut suddenly churns with pain and he takes a stumbling step forward. It roils again, rumbling from his stomach up to his ribs and down to his groin. He falls to the ground, curling in on himself. Looking up at the path to escape, he sees that the wolf has come to stand before him, stock still and watching.
It crowds itself over Tony’s body, the heat from its belly drifting over Tony’s back. He feels something wet slip down onto his pinned legs and his blood runs cold.
“Aww babe, you look so good taking a cock. I’m going to love taking your ass right after, when it’s all wet and used for me. Steve thinks you’re this innocent thing, but we know better, don’t we?” Bucky’s lips are right at Tony’s ear, and as he whispers, Tony shudders at the tingling sensation.
When the car is brought to them, they both settle in their respective seats and let a blanket of quiet come over the car. All Steve can hear is the roar of the engines, Tony’s and his breathing, and the sounds of the city.
“You like that Tony? Gonna fuck my children into you. Breed you so full.” His words make Tony shiver. Carrying their pups would be a joy. Something his body is made for and he wants with a fierceness that surprises him. He’s never considered himself a family man or deeply contemplated what it would be like to be a mother. He never thought he’d get the chance.
His focus narrows, and he concentrates on making his orgasm small, to not give the Alpha the satisfaction of the rippling contractions of his channel. Hold out as much of himself as he can.
“A lot of things have changed Tony, but we’ll get to that.” Steve nods at Tony’s Resident Annoyance.
He trods down to the workshop, where sure enough, Tony is still there in the same clothes as yesterday. He’s not quite at 24 hours without sleep, but he’s getting close. Steve decides to order food in for them, and he calls a pizza place nearby, using his SHIELD issued card over the phone to pay for the order.
“Not at all.” The Father leads him out of the sacristy further into the church, where it opens up into a small courtyard.
“JARVIS, where is Steve?” The bathroom door is dark and cracked open, so wherever Steve is, he’s not in their room. It’s silly, being afraid of a little darkness, but Tony doesn’t like leaving the bed at night. He puts up with Steve needing a midnight snack, because it’s
“There, just click that, and then type the last name. Now click this,” she points, “And type the first name. And lastly right here, the omega’s original surname.”
“For now, we want you on standby with our other operatives. You’ll be working primarily with the Black Widow and Hawkeye, our operatives, as well as Iron Man on a contingency basis. Given your current association with Tony Stark, we’re of a mind to keep you at home more often than not,,” Hill continues.
Once in front of it, he knocks carefully, as if anything more forceful will send Tony a message that Steve doesn’t deserve to be with him.
Maybe it’s not so bad that alphas can do that for their omegas sometimes. Perhaps he should cook for Tony, and that will help him see that it’s not as difficult as he’s made it out to be.
“You’re being serious right now. I can hear the serious face in your voice. This is, god, this is the worst thing to have happened, ever. Worse than finding out Santa isn’t real, maybe Hitler even.” He wanted to tell Pepper, he really did, but her steadfast determination to help him through this part of his life held him back. He wanted to give her this, even if it was an abhorrently bad idea to plan for something that was never going to happen.
“It’s good of you to offer to help. But we’re covered here.” As he releases Ty’s hand, the other man whips it down to his side, grabbing at it and rubbing with his other hand.
“All this time you knew how to cook, and you just let me suffer?” Tony snorts. “Rogers, I don’t want to cook. I will not cook. Get it through your head.”
Cap scents nothing but beta suppressants, of course, and he pulls back, nose crinkling, eyes locked on Tony’s.
“There won’t be an Alpha in sight. It’s in the rather extensive contract I had them sign just to step through our doors. There’ll be more contracts if you have any success with the scents.” Pepper bypassed his joke completely, which was speaking to how serious she thought this whole thing was.
The next push causes Tony to sputter, head twisting left and right in an attempt to escape the sensation. Steve gives no quarter, slowly, but methodically, thrusting in and out of his sweet Omega.
It does not help in the slightest that Steve is staring at him over the table. Natasha is huddled in on herself by Clint, who isn’t looking away from his basket. Bruce is lost in some world as he chews mindlessly on his gyro. And Thor isn’t paying attention to anything more than the food in front of him as he double fists his falafel. It’s just Tony, jumpy from the battle, and Steve, a silent observer who won’t stop looking.
at him. It pulls out all of the suffering that throbs inside him, that he lashed Tony with. And there’s this moment, this little prickle of awareness, as he’s entwined with Tony through their mutual gaze, that he can no longer bear it. Tony is gutting him with those brown eyes, scooping out his tender insides with them, and Steve cannot, cannot stop him.
Tony weaves through the crowd. It’s the color of dusk inside the bubble of the space station, and there’s a humming murmur of grunts, growls, chirps, and other noises all around him. He’s tried to get used to it, the smells, sights, sounds, even the taste of the air, but it’s alien, every time. None of that dissuades him from what he’s here to do.
“Take this and plant it within five feet of his main computer terminal. It’ll give you anywhere from ten to thirty minutes, but if it were me? I’d lean towards the lower end. We’re not more advanced than Stark, you’d just have the element of surprise and proximity. What is this for anyway?” The tech is distracted, but too curious. Steve is going to need discretion. He considers, only for a moment, killing this man. But Fury wouldn’t like that, and he has to trust that the head of SHIELD would only give this task to someone trustworthy.
“It is a lie when both parties don’t know why.” Nat is delicate with her words. And maybe she’s right that someday Steve should tell Tony. But to destroy what he’s worked for now? To make Tony miserable? He can’t do it. He can’t take their future and dash it on the rocks.
“He needs help.” Nat looked at Steve, and he could feel his lips twitch involuntarily at the grimace on her face. Steve turned to Bucky then, pleading on his face. He had to try.
“None taken, sir.” Not that JARVIS didn’t have his own Opinions. For every harridan’s origin story, there was a haranguing mother-type lurking in their past. His just happened to be the person in charge of his life and an AI. JARVIS was forbidden from saying anything about Tony’s situation to anyone else, but he gave an earful to Tony when he could. At least until Tony threatened to mix him with concrete and render him inert.
“You win Stevie. I never thought I’d hear Tony defend you, but there he is, swearing up and down this wasn’t you.” Bucky looks beaten, the kind of resigned he was when Steve used to get into fights with bullies much bigger than himself. It’s charming, and it lets Steve know that things are going to be ok.
“You won’t! Tell me, Steve.” Tony clenches the blankets around him tighter, his heart chilled like a stone in a running creek. Steve steps in the room then, shadowed body blocking out the light from the hallway. He lumbers over, still wearing his pajamas, as Tony watches with belated fear. He can’t lose Steve. He needs Steve.
The kind of necessity that made him enemy number one of SHIELD. Steve had slowly fallen into Tony’s orbit, from one clash to another, until Tony had settled inside the empty space of Steve’s life like he belonged there. With Tony, there was a future, a place where he was insulated from his cold and broken past.
“More. Deeper.” Tony is not above begging. He loves Steve to the very depths of his being, and through him, he feels the ghost of Sunset’s neck, of Ty’s broken body, and the empty hunger of Killian broken beneath him. He stands atop those feelings, striding like a giant. With him throughout is Steve, pulsing inside of him with a steady throbbing. Steve, who is the better half of his soul, his dark north star.
Tony is not athletic. This is not what he planned to have happen on his first time camping. He doesn’t think anyone would plan something like this.
“Come on Steve. Come on baby.” Tony dives in, the sting from his cock in Steve’s ass a background sensation to Tony’s pleas. Steve can’t give in. If he does, he feels as though there might be nothing left.
Carefully, Steve reaches between Tony’s legs, his fingers trailing between plush thighs to reach Tony’s entrance. He finds it, hot, wet, and grasping at Steve’s fingers, the taut rim of his ass trying to suck Steve in already.
“I’ll carry you.” Steve starts to reach around Tony’s body, fingers wedging themselves under his ribs. Just this simple touch sends paroxysms of need through Tony. It races down his limbs and coils itself right around his erect cock, which is grinding against the hard surface of the floor now. Tony
tight, the only sound between them the creaking and buckling of the suit as it brings the enemy closer, closer.
“If she were alive, I’d tell her that this ass is mine. Your body is mine, and that I use it however I want. Whenever I want. I’d want her to know how debased you are, how humiliating your fall.” Tony’s voice is casual, as thought he’s talking about the weather, but Steve can feel the bite of possession underlying it. Tony is not as distant as he makes himself seem. Steve knows he has a part of Tony as well. It’s in the way he’s tender after. The way he always lets Steve go. The way he gives Steve a choice.
His shame spiraling down the drain, he goes back out to pick up the dishes before heading back to bed.
“All that matters now, is what Tony wants–” He knew Natasha would make the best of an uncomfortable situation, and he’s grateful for her discretion in the matter. It’ll go a long way towards bringing Bruce around, who, besides Pepper and Rhodes, is the one member of the team he feared alienating most. Bruce is a beta, but the Hulk is an Alpha.
“I need one shot for America, and one for the rest of them. And if it gets really bad, keep me away from the tequila, will you?” Tony’s tone is easy, but Rhodey understands the implication that Tony needs to be on his toes tonight.
now. Clenching and squeezing as if he wants every drop of Steve’s come and he’s determined to have it as deep as possible.
“Bruce.” Tony hails their resident doctor on the coms. His friend is probably going to just send him to a doctor somewhere in this shit hole anyway, but they have a protocol. If Tony thinks he’s been compromised with some kind of potential illness or injury, he goes to Bruce.
“I know what you think of me. Tony Stark, slut extraordinaire. Tony Stark, incompetent omega that can’t cook anything to save his life. Who spends money like water flows.”
Steve reaches for another, a raspberry this time, and offers it up. Tony licks the tips of Steve’s fingers and sucks the tender flesh of the fruit from them once more. Steve feeds Tony like that, piece after piece, making his way through the cheeses and fruits. When Tony finishes, he hands him the juice to drink, which Tony obediently swallows.
Not sentient, which would be a whole different problem to deal with, but smart enough that the police aren’t cutting it.
He sits up just as the handle to the door starts to jiggle, back and forth, as if a child is trying to open the door. There’s a tension in the air, and he thinks that he’s not in Kansas anymore. Wherever this is, the decor is disjointed, the atmosphere wrong. Like someone has tossed together the pieces of a life but gave no thought as to the utility of it all.
“You’re serious.” Tony jumps off the stool and walks over, peering at the plate. He snatches a piece of bacon off of it and starts chewing, mouth open as he stuffs the entire thing in.
Tony slaps the last sheet of metal over the gears and gives Bucky a winsome smile. Bucky returns it and then reaches out to ruffle Tony’s hair with familiarity.
“He, and yes, he’s… infuriating. And I think I’ve done him wrong.” Steve sniffles and wipes roughly at his face.
It doesn’t matter what manifestation that takes, though Tony thinks he knows where he’ll go if he can’t physically find Steve anymore. It doesn’t scare him as much as it should.
“Not yet, you aren’t.” Tony shoves out his hand, as if he already knows that Steve isn’t going to shake it, and holds it there for a beat before returning it to his side, wiping it on his leg as if he’s touched something disgusting. Steve feels the heat of indignity at his back, the sudden desire to see this through, and he knows now that he’s hooked. Steve’s never backed down from a challenge, and there is no problem too big.
He’s moving back and forth above them, firing at will against the Chitauri speeders that keep attempting to interrupt their conversation.
The tower is an absolute disaster, which he noticed the first time when they came to get Loki, but he really gets the idea upon second viewing. He sends the rest of the Avengers up the regular elevators, which are amazingly still working, as he boards his private elevator headed for the penthouse.
“Just some of the good scotch, JARVIS. I’m not a hobo.” Would his— this alpha, distract him from drinking? He glanced at Rhodey, taking a sip of his drink. The other man grinned at him and Tony thought about what it would look like to replace the person in the chair with his alpha. His, and only his. With eyes for him and the whole nine yards. It could have been the scotch, but he felt warmed, hopeful.
. He hopes against hope that he’s Tony’s biggest, that if he couldn’t be first, he would be last and best. It’s an ugly feeling, jealousy, and Steve wishes he was above it, but when it comes to Tony, he’s not. He’s as low as any animal, and it shames him even as it drives his desires higher.
It doesn’t seem to matter, as Steve grunts on top of him, his hands stretching Tony’s cheeks wide apart, the seams of his rim pricking with painful sensation. He doesn’t know how much more of this he can take.
and it forces them to bare their bodies, their entire beings to one another. The heat from Steve’s skin is like an inferno, and Tony wants to burn up, to be ash in the air that Steve breathes in.
“They’re working overtime right now,” Steve said. “Oh god, Tony. What you’ve done– what you’ve done is
If it was only Tony, he might have been able to walk away. But a rut is as dangerous to an Alpha’s mind as not going into heat is to an Omega’s body. Without suppressants, or an Omega, an Alpha could get easily locked into a feral state.
Bucky steps back, seeming to admire his handiwork, leaving Tony a panting mess. Tony gazes at him warily, despite the endorphins that make Tony want to slouch into Bucky.
“Don’t waste your time, Steve. And get working. Tony needs it.” Bucky pulls Tony’s head to the side and resituates himself so that his head is on Bucky’s lap, with Bucky’s hard cock peeking out of his pants and pointed just slightly away from Tony’s lips. Steve starts to move then, pulling back and entering Tony with a smooth and controlled thrust. It barely taps Tony’s prostate, and he groans at the sensation, wishing it was more.
. Like Steve’s mother did. Tony is a good person. Steve wants all of that surrounding him again and again, like drowning in syrup, the air bubbles of his breath unable to find their way to the surface. His heart had beaten against his rib cage like a trapped bird during Tony’s heat, just wanting to be free to love Tony like he deserved. His brave, strong omega, to have endured all of what Steve has done and still come out like this.
He snatches the bottle of lube from next to Tony and coats his fingers in it, maintaining eye contact with Tony the entire time. When he sees Tony’s breath hitch, he moves behind him, fingers tracing up and down Tony’s crack. Every time he moves past Tony’s hole, the man gives a slight, sharp inhale.
“You might be a better man than expected, Steve. Keep this up, and Clint won’t even try to shoot you anymore.” Natasha glances at him, her red hair brushing her shoulder as she shakes her head.
Finally it eases up, and he watches Tony slump onto him. It’s euphoria now, his mind floating up into the atmosphere where he can barely breathe and the roaring of blood in his head is an endless river. He’s never known a feeling like this in his life. Never knew that loving Tony would be like this. There’s a hole inside him that’s slowly filling itself, a leaking faucet of comfort that drips into him with warmth and depth.
“Just remember,” is all Tony says before he deftly unbuttons his pants and pulls his zipper down, pants sliding off with a soft shucking sound. Steve reaches for the waistband of Tony’s underwear and pulls, Tony stepping out of his garments, the pads of his bare feet smacking the ground. The omega is already beautifully hard, and Steve can smell slick leaking, scenting the air with arousal. Tony’s cock bobs once, and Steve seizes it in a soft but firm grip, milking it so a bead of precum surfaces on the slit, which he laps up to the sound of Tony’s groan.
Tony reaches behind himself once more, grasping Steve’s filthy wet cock and lining it up at his entrance before sliding down, down, down, taking Steve all the way into him in one full glide. It’s like Tony is being poured over him and then everything in Tony constricts all at once, and Steve is gazing at Tony as the omega’s head is tilted back, his mouth slack with effort and pleasure and something like pain. Tony’s ass flutters helplessly around Steve, and it’s overwhelming.
“There’s a few more rules. And I wanted to remind you of rule one.” Tony pulls his jacket off and lays it on his bed. He untucks his shirt and throws it down next to the jacket. Steve watches him with hooded eyes.
Steve takes Tony on his hands and knees again, fast and hard, brutally fucking into Tony’s ass, making it red with hard use. It’s just what Tony needs, as the omega comes with a howl, clawing the bedding underneath his fingers as Steve knots him.
“I’m Steve Rogers, your alpha.” He doesn’t put out his hand, because it’s rude to touch unbound omegas.
“I quit, I’m resigning. That's it.” And while that broke his heart, he wasn’t taken aback. Selfishly though, he needed her. Somewhere inside, he thought, maybe after their shared trauma from the fight, he could have her in his life. He would. He would do anything to keep her around.
“He deserves to die.” Tony’s not even sure he believes that anymore, but he’s too invested in this outcome to let it go. They’re both too bloody, too sure in their positions to do anything less.
“Wow. That’s– wow. Stevie…” His friend is picking at his food, his mouth opening and closing like he wants to say more, but can’t. Steve can’t say that Bucky would never judge him, but at the very least Bucky would keep his secrets. It makes him sag against the back of the booth in relief.
“Distract me. Just, anything, please.” Steve sits down on the floor next to Tony, cross-legged. From there Tony gets a direct view of those tight pants spanning over the bulge of Steve’s dick. His ridiculous and intoxicated brain thinks this is ungodly hot. Tony shudders and turns his head away. He’s got to maintain control.
“Steve, I need you so bad– Always wanted you, needed you, please–” Tony would beg. Then maybe Steve would touch him.
“Tony, you know what I think already. You need to take breaks. Here, let me give you a shoulder rub. Come to the couch.” Steve gestures at Tony, hands curving in to pull him forward.Tony goes to Steve, tethered to Steve’s request like a balloon, floating forward, reeled in.
“Tony, it’s ok. I know you’re stressed. You always give so much of yourself to everyone. It’s what I like the most about you, but it’s also the most frustrating thing. Have you thought about taking time for yourself lately?”
Steve backs him to the bed, each shin pushing at his until the backs of his knees strike mattress, and he falls easily into the sheets. Tony turns over, and crawls towards his nest, his baser urges telling him to settle into it, show Steve he’d be good at providing, good at taking it so many times that there’s no possible way he’s not pregnant. Even if that won’t be happening due to his birth control pill that he took before arriving, his body is unconvinced by reality.
“Good, let’s get to it then.” Steve pulls up a chair to the counter and gestures at Tony to sit down. Tony does, slamming his smoothie on the counter as he settles in.
.” Tony squirms and tries to get away, the knot tugging at his body as he twists and claws at the bedding around him. Steve clutches him tight, willing his omega to be calm, to know that Steve isn’t mad at him at all.
“Well, I don’t have much of a life outside of this myself, so it’s good to hear about other people’s problems.”
“Sir, we have more incoming.” JARVIS’s warning is highly redundant, but he appreciates the effort as the HUD lights up with arrows directing him towards the portal once more.
This time it’s Tony on his knees, like he said he would never do for Steve. In his mind, Tony is at the foot of his bed, knees on the plush carpet there with his open mouth waiting. Those doe-brown eyes are heavy with intent and flash out from under his lashes. Steve takes the offering, cupping Tony’s jaw to bring him closer and feed him Steve’s cock. The Tony in his mind moans when his tongue touches precum, and Tony then takes Steve about halfway in, sucking needily at the tip of Steve’s cock.
“No, no, you watch, and you come when you need. If that’s now, I’ll knot you tight like you deserve.” Steve reaches and pulls Tony back to him, and Tony makes a garbled sound as he tries to hold it in. He’s rock hard, every slap of his cock onto his belly making it that much more difficult for him to hold it in.
Steve had him on his back now, fingers tracing gently up Tony’s slit, over to his cock, the blunt fingernails dragging over velvety skin. The red head of his cock was drooling precum, and Tony watched in slow motion as Steve leaned down and ever so gently stuck his pink tongue out to taste. He groaned when he swiped some of the liquid away from Tony, and without compunction, shoved his tongue into Tony’s waiting cunt as he sucked Tony down and into his throat.
“I know, you’re right. But the way you are is enough to have made me unable to reconcile not having you for myself.” And Steve loves him. That’s the crux of it right there. Tony knows it now. How Steve couldn’t keep himself back.
“So you’re concerned.” There’s a knot in Steve’s belly, and the sensation ratchets higher with each breath he takes. Having super soldier senses gives him a fine-tuned control over his body, but Nat has always been a reader of body language, even when there’s no body language to read . He’s too still. He can’t move as he normally would, so he stays in this frozen position, hoping she doesn’t see how terrified he is. She knows something is up.
Steve tidies up the kitchen and sets the dirty dishes he used to the side. There’s no time to clean them all off now. He sets the pot to soaking, and by the time he’s done, he figures he should go wait in the lobby.
“Are you going to disrespect my wishes now? Isn’t that what you always do?” Steve freezes, torn in pieces over what he’s supposed to do and what he wants to do. He hears all the advice he’s gotten in his head from the doctor, Natasha, the priest, and more.
The truth is more complex, in that Steve’s Alpha nature is not something Tony knows at all. Steve hasn’t shown him. Usually his morality would stop him, but he’s wanted for so long now, and he knows, knows that Tony would be happy with him, that it’s easy to be selfish, just this once.
Hulk smashes the front of the whale, causing a chain reaction along the animal’s spine as its head stays anchored to where the Hulk’s fist is impaled into it. It flips up, slowly, all the momentum it had running through its body flowing through it, and like a tree, begins to fall towards the Avengers.
“Ok, Steve.” Tony pulls away at last before turning around and making his way to his workbench. He throws a cautious look behind his shoulder, giving Steve a megawatt smile.
“Colonel Rhodes is his guardian, and I’ve already gotten his permission to court Tony, which is legally binding as an approval for stealing him away.”
He leaves the church feeling even more off balance. Everywhere he’s gone, he’s met resistance for what he’s done to Tony. The whole world is telling him that he needs to move. But Steve has planted himself like a tree beside the river of truth, and has told the world “No, you move.” And the world, in its way, has borne down further on him.
He lays there, planked over Tony, not pressing his body down hard on Tony’s slighter one, trying not to think about how awe inspiring it would be to
“Yes,” he breathes out. And so much more. There’s everything that Steve wants to give Tony. His fingers, his cock, everything that Steve is wants to pour inside of Tony until he’s so full of Steve that Tony chokes and takes him in deeper. Lets Steve settle into all the private places Tony keeps for himself. Steve wants it all.
. Their place should smell like the both of them, scented together as an almost-bonded and married pair. Tony, in his secret moments, hopes that someday it could be as much as all that between them. According to Steve, Tony is worth it, and Tony is starting to believe that as best he can.
There’s no possible way that this army couldn’t find their way to earth at some other place and time. This isn’t the kind of army that you use to conquer a city; this is a planetary invasion.
“Inside, inside.” Tony grasps his hand and helps guide his fingers under Tony’s elastic waistband. Underneath, there’s warm curly hair, and Tony’s even warmer cock resting up against it. Steve reaches down and grips at the hardness, twisting his fingers around it. Tony cries out and Steve sucks harder at the gland, wanting him to enjoy this as much as possible. His omega is so pretty, writhing up against him. Steve wants this forever, his sweet pliant omega giving it up to his alpha. To think he had never wanted one for himself before. He’s engulfed with desire for Tony, and it sears into his skin, red hot and burning.
On the Quinjet, Steve echoes Tony’s concerns about Loki’s capture, and Tony reigns in a smart comment. Tony is a real actor. Fuck Broadway; pretending to not be a superhero was the real qualifier for theatre.
Steve steels himself and agrees to admit to his crimes. Even if Trevor can’t find it inside of him to be forgiving.
“Is there anything else I can get you, Tony?” There has to be something that Tony wants that Steve can acquire. Maybe Tony will let him into the nest again. Maybe he can give Tony another toe-curling orgasm. The sweet little moans and keens from Tony still haunt his waking hours. He’s been half hard in his pants for most of the day, just ready to please Tony.
“You should get lost. Eavesdropping is for children and the government.” He waved his arm at his best friend who had watched him get shot down.
“Yeah? Well, it’s what I want. And I’ve waited long enough to take it.” Tony’s heart stutters. Steve is a sadist. All the times Steve has hurt Tony, he’s wanted to. It’s been a long road of not understanding why Steve treats Tony the way he does, when Tony wears his pain on his sleeve. All along it’s been a game to Steve. It stings worse than the pain of Steve pummeling his ass.
They’ve done this before, as taboo as it’s apparently supposed to be, and Steve works him with the familiarity he has of his own body. One finger and then two, twisting and spreading, and soon enough Steve is inside, moving with every slide of Tony’s body across the bed. Their fingers entwine and Steve ripples, every end of his sinuous undulation ending in a sharp jolt inside Tony.
“Steve, please.” His love casts distraught eyes at him, the brown swallowed by black pupils. Slack jawed, Tony starts to crawl towards Steve, and it breaks whatever spell has been cast over him. Steve moves, arms coming to link under Tony’s and scoop up his bottom.
“There’s not a lot I don’t know, Steve. Did you enjoy your time in church? I don’t know what you confessed to the priest. That’s just a step too far for my privacy invasions.” Tony smiles, and it’s more unguarded than Steve’s seen in the past.
“Look, I feel genuine anxiety when someone asks me what I want to eat. This is ranked a 6 on a scale of sweaty workmen to Tiberius Stone. Do I have to?” Maybe she’s forgotten about how he prefers these things wiped down, since he doesn’t know whose hands it has passed through.
“Well, we got its attention. What the hell was step two?” He pauses to watch it lumber through the air before realizing he should probably regroup with the Avengers. It takes no time at all to find Cap, Hawkeye and Widow duking it out with an endless stream of Chitauri foot soldiers. He watches as Thor lands next to them. Tony zips by, playing air control over their little group. Most of what he hears is over the coms.
“Oh, gimme gimme.” He trots over to Steve, making his grabby hands, which is unfairly adorable and makes Steve want to pet his soft-looking hair. Steve watches avidly as Tony demolishes the carbonara, noodles disappearing so fast that Steve can’t believe he’s even tasting the food.
Heading down in the elevator, he clutches the bag close, hands sweating on and fingers crinkling the brown paper. He likes to think this is the turning point, but he knows that he’s committed as soon as he realized that Tony will be healthier and happier this way. The future has an inevitability about it that makes him feel confident, content.
Steve had stayed silent and patient throughout Angela’s story, but the idea that an alpha had stolen her hard-earned funds, had coerced her into a pregnancy, something about it got to him. He’d controlled Tony’s finances. What if he had been coercing Tony and he had also taken away Tony’s money? He wasn’t as bad as David. He’d never tried to force Tony into a pregnancy, but something niggled at him that Tony should have the right to try and get away if he felt he needed to.
He smoothly presses between people to get to where Tony is, brushing shoulders and forcing a path open for himself. His hearing is sharp, and he catches the drift of the conversation before he arrives.
He remembers Tony’s squirming, and the deepest shame comes over him. He’s thought about Tony like that. Wanted it. Just like Conall. He can hardly stomach himself. What kind of man is he? What kind of alpha?
“You’re done doing that, too.” She grabs him and drags. Tony tumbles out of the bed, not opting to get on his feet. Natasha doesn’t let up, continuing to pull at him as Tony sprawls out on the floor.
“Ah, damn, SHIELD didn’t even brief you? Well, welcome to 2011 Cap. It’s been a wild ride, which you’ve missed out on the beginnings of, being frozen in the arctic for 70 years, give or take. So yup, yadda yadda, it’s the future, and we’re in the midst of a zombie tragedy in my tower, which is locked up tighter than a nun’s knickers.”
“Tony refuses to learn how to cook. And I shouldn’t have let him starve to make a point, that was wrong. Though I didn’t realize that’s what was happening.”
“A warm light for all mankind… Loki made that jab at Fury about the cube.” Banner interrupts their bickering to bring them actual useful information, and Tony tries to back off emotionally from thinking about Rogers so much. Granted the man is likely going to piss him off in a couple minutes, but it’s worth a try.
Everything here is smooth and sleek. He wonders when he stopped hating it. When he stopped hating everything about Tony. Now he sees just how powerful Tony is to have made it in this world, with alphas like him trying to pull and push him into what they wanted. Tony has never once given into Steve. The strength that has taken astounds him. Before, it was the source of his anger at Tony. Now he can see Tony’s defiance in a new light. Edith showed him.
“I know I’m nothing compared to you two, and I know that I shouldn’t have much pride left, but this is beyond the pale, what you’re doing. Just stop.”
“Then show me.” Steve turns around and marches out of the workshop, expecting Tony to follow. He hears the man’s footsteps behind him, and he breathes a sigh of relief that he doesn’t have to drag Tony up the stairs.
Nat laughs, the sound crystalline and bold. It’s all Alpha, and Steve feels rankled, like he’s been smacked upside his head.
“Pepper is the CEO, not Tony!” Steve wouldn’t have rushed into this without knowing the consequences. He looked. Tony can be CEO if the board approves of his alpha. Steve has never needed the persona of Captain America before, but if there’s one thing he has no problem using it for, it’s his soon to be mate.
Steve grasps Tony by the hips, flips him around, and pushes the head of his cock against Tony’s hole, gasping as the muscles flutter under the pressure. Tony gives a breathy little growl, and the sound of it causes Steve to lose control completely. He thrusts forward, feeling Tony’s body give way and let him be seated at the root of him. Tony cries out, ecstatic, and Steve seizes the omega’s hips to pull his cock nearly all the way out before plunging it back in again. Steve grasps Tony’s hair and leans forward towards his neck, savaging his throat with kisses.
Steve comes hard, fluid warm and hot in Tony’s channel as he fucks in and out of the tight heat of it. Watches as it turns frothy when Steve continues sliding through the mess he’s making of Tony’s ass.
“Then you don’t have to.” The words are like pulling teeth. Steve cooked this meal for them, and it’s already getting cold. Tony should be grateful. Yet here he is, throwing Steve’s courtesy back in his face.
“I know this is hard for you, Tony. I know you and Steve had something special, meaningful. You were our best pilots.” Fury is so unflappable. The man’s hands are crossed in front of him as if this is just another day, Just one more meeting he has to be done and over with.
“Yet you’re confused about why they don’t want you around?” Ouch. The Captain’s lip twitches with what could be impatience or passive aggressive hostility.
He doesn’t know why he keeps coming here. He knows he isn’t going to find anything. With a sigh, he makes his way back to the guide, promising himself that this is the last time.
. His own cock is rock hard, and he’s certain when he gets inside Tony, he’s going to explode. So he makes it good for Tony, moving his arm so that his palm faces downward and his two fingers brush directly against Tony’s prostate. He pumps them in just so, tilting his arm up so he can slam them down onto Tony’s hot button. Tony is bucking wildly now, pressing his hips back onto Steve’s ministrations.
“Yeah, Omega with a suit of armor he can’t even pilot.” It’s like a punch to the chest, the fact that he can’t openly be Iron Man. That he won’t. His eyes flick to Fury and Natasha, who keep their faces closed. Good. Tony is never going to show how he feels about what Cap has said on his face. Nope, he’s going to bury those feelings as deep as he can. Scrunch them into a little ball and just—grow a couple of ulcers to mark the spot, but otherwise, insult the man back and pretend it’s all fine.
Tony feels like a fucking slut, slamming his cock greedily into Bucky’s fist. He whines unevenly, ashamed, and Bucky steps forward to lick at Tony’s parted lips. His mouth almost snaps shut, but it’s too late; Bucky is inside, tongue tracing teeth and flesh. It’s impossible to keep silent, his pathetic little groans sneaking past the seal of Bucky’s lips.
“We won’t stop looking until we find something. But you have to accept the fact that he might be gone. And with that, we’ll be looking at new drift compatible candidates for you. Your mind is malleable and we can work with that.”
The thing is, all of these missions and general Avengers things would be fine if Tony’s heat weren’t a factor. He’s orchestrating his coming out as Iron Man to the public soon, the Avengers are all settled, his company’s stock is recovered from his cessation of weapons production, they’re the heroes of New York, and that social cache means something. The only thing is his heat. Which normally he’d drag his feet on, but he’s run out of suppressants, and he knows Fury isn’t going to give him more. So he’s resolved, -ish. He’s going to make a play for suppressants, but settle for a mediocre alpha-fuck. Everyone is happy, Tony can forget all about it, and life goes back to normal.
“Smart. But you come to me, for what?” Arms crossed, Fury looks like he’s on a throne, and Steve a small petitioner for a favor, or judgment.
“With pleasure.” Tony steps forward and Steve places his feet on Tony’s as they rise up into the air, Tony’s arms wrapped around Steve as though he’ll never let go.
“I just went out for a second.” Fear flits across Tony’s face. Steve’s anger softens a little at it. When did Tony have any reason to fear him? It twists uncomfortably in his gut. It’s not a look he ever expected to see. He doesn’t know what he’s done to earn Tony’s fear, but he wants it gone.
“And sometimes there’s no coming back from that. But the thing is, it’s not your decision to make. It’s his. I’d ask you if you told him any of this, but it sounds like you’re having a revelation right now. So just level with him. Ask him to forgive you. The worst he can say is no. And if he doesn’t, you still have to work on forgiving yourself.”
“Tony, what’s wrong? Are you hurt? Let me see–” Steve kept coming forward, hands out in supplication.
“It’s ok, it’s just, ok, well, heat prevention was restraint during heat, so omegas couldn’t do anything to—well. Anything. And gland rubbing is normally a thing that alphas do with their omegas to solidify pair bonds, but it’s also something that feels pleasurable to omegas, so to do it as a way to keep them—keep them docile, is repugnant. I mean, aren’t you an alpha? You’re like mid-twenties. You should know some of these things.”
“I stay. If I lose him, it doesn’t matter anyway.” With that, Tony doesn’t argue, though he tosses Steve a careful expression that Steve thinks says ‘don’t let my friend die.’ He won’t.
The suit twirls through the air as each repulsor blast hits its target, all while dodging blue balls of energy and the flowing crowd of more soldiers. He’s not enough, and as more pour through, one finally clips the suit.
to damage the structural integrity, didn’t you? Thousands of tons of concrete for our team to dig through, and demolishing the building was the only option Tony?”
Thor promises to meet them at the shawarma place in a few, after he secures his brother. Thankfully Loki is done putting up a fight.
“I think I might have you anyway.” Steve leans down and over Tony, covering Tony’s cold body with his incredible warmth. Tony is stunned at the admission, and as flattering as it is to be wanted, he can’t help but think about what he would have done if he wasn’t hopelessly in love with Steve. As it stands, he thinks he might be about to get fucked by the man who lied to him, who beat him.
It’s kind of the end of the world though. And there’s no police here or other authority figures to stop them if they want to spend it with each other.
Fury had tried to create a team out of the husks of people who had already sustained too much damage from the world at large. If Tony could have connected with people, he would have. He didn’t hold out hope for the disgruntled old man at the table working well with Tony Stark. It burned in his gut that Iron Man and Captain America might be a different story.
Tony wishes he could claim he’s never been dense, but it took him a long time to figure this one out.
“I’ll– I’ll try to make you happy Tony. You’ll say yes if I agree to those terms?” Tony’s head ached, his body trembling and sweating. To be frank, he’d agree to anything at this point if Steve could fill the yawning emptiness inside him. It hurt, the clenching of his cunt around nothing. He was slick now, his slit drooling down his legs. Tony bet Steve could smell it.
Tony would grumble and whine, but acquiesce like the darling Omega he is. And then Steve will placate him with a knot. It’s the perfect vision.
Which is right when Tony seized. His back arched off the bed they’d placed him on, his breath coming in quick pants as his left shoulder jerked and his eyes fluttered. Steve went to hold him down, but Bruce smacked away his hands.
He most certainly is. He’s utterly perfect. Steve wants. Like nothing he’s ever needed to possess before. The Alpha inside him rises like a shadow over his brain and whispers about how Tony would look with a mating mark on his neck, how sweet the lines of his body would be if they were glistening with sweat as he was worked over by Steve. The tears that would slide down the crinkles of his face when Steve stuffed his mouth full with his cock.
“It’s not ok! What are you thinking?” This has to stop. He wants to say he’s not a toy, but he fears that’s the impression he’s made. And being called ‘baby’ just hurts. He would kill to be Steve’s ‘baby.’
“Don’t. Just don’t Steve. Do not go there. I said you can’t take anything I said during heat seriously. Are you going to renege because you don’t like the consequences?”
“And omega is practically a swear word in your book. Tell me, do you get put over my leg every time you say omega?” Neck tightly corded, Tony’s shoulders are tight, and Steve can hear how rapid his heartbeat is. He thinks that Tony isn’t aroused anymore, but whatever he’s feeling, it’s affecting him physically.
, spiraling so very close before it lets loose in a torrent of groans and spend. Steve hauls Tony tight, his knot popping in over Tony’s quivering rim as Tony paints himself, stripes hitting his stomach and chest as his cock bobs and sways.
Tony slides to the floor, knees scraping the wall as he does so, and Bucky goes with him, the two fingers he has shoved in never ceasing at their movement. He shoves his hips out and back, pressing into Bucky’s hand, and Bucky presses right back, wiggling a third finger in without warning.
Tony grasps himself in hand, timing his strokes to Bucky’s, wanting with a desperation bordering on profound to come together with him. The other man smiles down at him in acknowledgement, looking so pleased and connected with Tony’s pleasure. If it could always be like this, Tony could just die with happiness.
“So what is it that I won’t be getting the privilege of, Cap? Since you seem to think everything you do is by god’s command himself.” A little snarkiness he can ignore. Things will start in earnest when they get home. Routine and structure will cure Tony of these urges to sass and otherwise cause trouble.
“And isn’t SHIELD secret, as in shut the fuck up? Also your secretive purpose is for homeland security. Do I look like Captain fucking America over here? You cannot Enforce and Logistics my identity out of me, Fury.” The Director stared him down with hands clasped as if waiting for Tony’s attitude to abate. The Mark V has an air filtration system for its air filtration system. Which was great, because he could both not smell his own panic and knew Director Fury couldn’t as well.
There are no handholds inside this monotonous breakdown that he can grab hold onto. Instead, he physically loops his arm around Steve’s elbow, grasping on for dear life. Steve, who knows the taste of Tony’s fear, leans in and becomes the only thing propping Tony up as Sunset drones on about her successes, some of them old iterations of ideas she stole from him. He thinks she takes secret delight in trotting out her crimes. Her accomplishments.
“And I got it! I met Edgar late in life. My fifties if you would believe! But he pursued me like I was a fresh plucked spring chicken, and if that didn’t do wonders for my ego. Oh, Edgar was a good alpha. Never a hand raised to me, and he cooked a mean meatloaf. He used to help me make the best nests, if I may be so bold as to say. He used to get me the softest pillows.” Nesting was something that omegas did before heats. Never had Steve realized that an alpha could possibly participate. The idea takes him by surprise with how much he imagines providing Tony with soft, warm blankets and silky pillows. Would Tony like that? He can’t give in to taking Tony during his heat, but he can give him whatever he needs for the nest. That’s what he’ll do.
“Ok, you got me. What is it this time?” Tony sighs and turns around, setting his tool down on the counter.
Almost as if he’s a mind reader, Steve rubs his hand over Tony’s belly, smearing cum under his hand as he caresses the skin there.
“Ah, I see your value to Fury now. Are you always his mouthpiece or do you take breaks to eat? Yeah, so, following is not really my style. I’ll let you take that one Captain Sparkles.” Tony has had it with this guy. His body still wants him, inexplicably. But that’s overwhelmed by the sheer amount of desire he has to punch the man in his beautiful fucking face. The man is logical to the point of irrationality, in that he can’t even think for himself. He’s been sucking on SHIELD’s tit for far too long.
“No, yes, no. I don’t know. I can’t imagine him differently, but part of me still thinks that he could come to enjoy some of the softer side of things.” Steve rubs at his neck, ruffling the hair on the back of his head.
Tony rubbed gently at his chest, the dark veins he’d seen in the mirror firm and ribbed under his touch, but moved his hand away quickly. If he didn’t watch out, it’d become a habit.
“Hi, sweetheart. Killian was just leaving.” Killian gets up and siddles alongside his chair over to Steve, ignoring Tony’s dismissal.
Omega, no. Replays again and again. Tony shivers and endures it, forming a callus against the intrusion. There’s no way to tell if it will hold up in person, but there aren’t any other options. He’s got to have his shit together by the time Steve returns.
“This was for you. You were such a good boy.” The words cause Tony to shudder. He’s never been a good boy, not like that, and he
“You mean I don’t smell fucked. I sprayed some beta cologne before we came, and that will have to do,” Tony says before he takes a large sip of his glass, tilting it back quickly before smacking his lips. “Ok, to battle.”
Tony’s cock is a firm weight in his mouth, resting solidly on his tongue as he slides his mouth up and down. Tony is mumbling, his words indiscernible but for begging and Steve’s name, his jaw slack with pleasure. Tilting his head down, Tony’s eyes widen at the sight of Steve, and he lays a gentle hand on Steve’s head. Steve looks up at him, his brilliant omega, the one person who he’ll always regret hurting and will do anything to bridge that pained gap between them.
“Yup, I was Iron Man all along, oops. But hey, we did it. All right, yay! Hurray. Good job, guys. Let’s just not come in tomorrow. Let’s just take a day. Have you ever tried Shawarma? There’s a Shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don’t know what it is, but I want to try it.” Putting on a mask is what Tony does best. Fake happiness beats genuine misery any day. So when Steve smiles ruefully at him, Tony thinks that maybe, just maybe, he’ll escape unscathed. Even if in the end, shrapnel is shrapnel, and he’s going to end up alone with the things he’s done wrong.
“Shh, darling, I’ve got you.” Tony is free of his jeans now, his boxers with them, and when the cold air hits his hole, he knows he’s gaping and leaking everywhere. Does Steve like the way he looks? Does he want him?
“You can go, Captain. Please take care of sir.” Steve manages to pull Tony’s jeans off of him, leaving him ass-naked in a lover’s carry. He has to trust that JARVIS can take care of this, because Steve is not having his first time with Tony on the floor of the workshop or its ratty couch.
He sways a bit while standing, feeling the surreal reality of what just happened. It might not even be over either.
Tony scoffs, crosses his legs, tucks them up under his chin, and stares out into the military labs that put together the largest technological advancements of the modern age.
Steve couldn’t hold himself back if he wanted to, and Tony can’t wait any longer. Steve takes what is offered.
Steve now realizes that Tony doesn’t fit the normal mold of an omega, but he’s still not given up hope that he can alter some of Tony’s behavior so that he is at least acceptable.
“Nothing much, just thinking.” Tony is chastened by his behavior. He’s always so reckless. With the team, with his life, with his stuff, with other people’s hearts. That’s why he’ll never have someone like Steve. Bucky seems like he could handle Tony. Steve does too, but Steve doesn’t deserve to be hurt. Tony isn’t sure he
been omega. And if Erskine hadn’t come along… He’d be an omega, and likely dead. He never would have gone to war with Bucky, met Peggy, met
When he feels Steve’s cockhead pressing at his entrance, he whines from behind Steve’s hand. It nudges at him, again and again, and Steve once more spits on the rim of his ass, rubbing it up his dick and down around Tony’s entrance. It gives him an inch or so in, but it burns. No effort was made to prep him.
“I don’t know, Bucky. I don’t even know.” He rubs his face into his hands before clearing his throat. Blowing out his breath, he looks off at a point behind Bucky. He feels wrung out from thinking about Tony. He doesn’t know exactly how this is going to come together. It’s all by the seat of his pants, his hopes pinned on Bucky helping him out.
Finally the swelling allays enough to slip out, and Steve feels his cum leak out onto his belly. Tony sighs with relief and rolls off of Steve, falling to Steve’s side in a huff.
Something topples into him and he keels over, hitting the ground roughly, yelping as his hands scrape across debris and his knees bloom with pain.
“Steve.” Bucky sounds agitated and firm in his warning. And with a sigh, Steve listens, pulling his cock out with a wet slurp, and Tony can
He ends up leaving SHIELD feeling wrung out and lost. Edith had a strict schedule, and her caretakers had shown up quick as can be to get her loaded into the van. Nat had come back, tilted her head at him with those cold, cold eyes, and dismissed him without asking about any of it, including his red-rimmed eyes.
“So while you were starving your husband, did you eat off of his dime? I mean, I just want to know if you’re like every other asshole who tries to take advantage of Stark.”
“Mm, good alpha.” And holy mother of God, that should not do it for him, but it does. He swells with pride that he’s taken care of his mate, his husband. He wants to tackle Tony down onto the mattress, press his body up against the omega’s, and rut into him. Instead, he goes for another blanket to cover his thickening erection.
The armor is pounding at him, metal panels slapping deep onto his cheeks as the metal cock plunges hard into his ass. He’s tearing, he knows it, but it’s no matter. It will heal.
“You making dinner tonight? I don’t really want to cook.” The omega gives her alpha an exaggerated frown.
This all happened because Howard gave his omega son too long of a leash. Anthony wasn’t an alpha. He wasn’t capable of the kind of resilience and focus that alphas were. And it showed.
Why couldn’t they have stayed out of it? His limbs are shaking now and his chest is a knot of pain. The urge to hide, to flee is so strong and it competes with his inner Alpha, which tells him to fight both Nat and Bucky until they are done.
“For now, I’m going to ask you to contain yourself and get back to the ceremony. I will explain after.”
He’s Tony Stark, the man, he reminds himself. Not the Omega. He’s not an animal. This was a mistake. Steve doesn’t want him; he wants what any Alpha wants and will do anything to attain. An Omega fuck. This is not for keeps. Nothing in this world is. No matter what Steve has said, has promised.
“Okay. Okay, Tony.” He glances his fingers off Tony now, methodically memorizing him as best he can with the limitations presented. His hands glide over Tony’s back, up and center to meet his spine, and then down to press the tips of his fingers to the divots of flesh above Tony’s ass. He makes his touch firm, unhesitating. He wants Tony to know what he’s seeking and knowing.
They talk for a while more, Pepper insisting it’s going to be ok. And not surprisingly, it helps. She’s always been soothing. Tony’s body is still tense with frenetic energy, however. The only way to excise it is to invent. So he lets Pepper go so she can do the work that he detests doing.
After it’s over, the justice leaves the room, and the certificate of their marriage is laying on the table. Tony looks at it, impassive, as Steve waits for him to turn and pay attention.
“It’s ok if you’re not comfortable. They just look so—so soft.” Steve reached a hand out, and Tony’s wings closed the distance, the very largest feather brushing his fingers. Tony has given up on trying to stop them from doing whatever it was they want to do when Steve was close. What’s one more thing?
“Open wide, yeah that’s good.” Bucky pinches at Tony’s jaw as Tony obediently parts his lips. It’s not a perfect alignment, but Bucky makes do as he bends his cock just so and slides the tip of it into Tony’s open mouth. As gentle as he can be, Tony suckles at the head, moaning at the taste, the now poignant thrusts of Steve, and the overall feeling of being
Tony hops into the driver’s side of some kind of sleek sports car as Steve gets into the passenger seat. A month ago, he would have insisted on driving, and probably killed them or ruined the car itself.
His orgasm hits him like waves crashing again and again, roiling forward and back out to sea. Tony is lost there, and he’s as found as he can be while he’s with Steve. And Steve, amazing, devoted Steve, drinks all there is from Tony’s deflating cock, licks his fingers that were inside Tony as he stalks up on all fours to give him a searing kiss.
When the day arrives, Tony showers and puts on some loose fitting clothes. He usually shows up in style to this sort of thing. But no, SHIELD, Pepper, and even Rhodey suggested he park a Subaru just out of town and have Happy take him there, whilst shaking the paparazzi.
He can hold his breath for quite some time, and he uses it now. Tony’s little groans and moans fill his ears as he works Tony over. His lips are caressing the base of Tony’s cock, pressing down on the layer of fat as the wiry texture of Tony’s hair tickles at his lips.
“I’m your alpha. You should be informing me of your whereabouts. I realize I never made that clear, but I thought you wouldn’t be so foolish.”
“So good for me. You’re taking my knot so well. I’m proud of you. I’ll take care of you Tony. I’ll always take care of you.” Once Steve starts whispering these endearments, he can’t stop. Tony hitches a sob and Steve’s mind blanks with concern, rising up to clutch at Tony.
Steve is relentless on Tony’s lips, as sweet as a reprieve. Their kiss is hot, and delicious, a push-pull that he’s never experienced. Tony’s arms come up to rest his elbows over Steve’s shoulders, and he feels Tony gently hold him, crossing his arms behind Steve’s neck. Steve takes his hands, leaving Tony’s face, and drags them down to Tony’s ribs, feeling Tony shudder as he does so.
“Sir, may I suggest that this isn’t the best use of your time? Lay people do precisely ten things with their computer, and none of those are streaming ten copies of a HD movie at once.” JARVIS makes Steve smile. That sass is all Tony’s doing.
“This is a domestic violence shelter for omegas. They have special visiting days for alphas, but you’ll need to make yourself as non-threatening as possible. A lot of omegas here have been hurt by their alphas, and some don’t feel comfortable around alphas. The omegas you meet today are willing to share their stories. Do you understand?” Steve curls his shoulders inward, preparing to make himself smaller.
“Nonetheless, we’re going to do this my way. And I promise at the end of it, things will be better.”
Things get better after that. It’s inexplicable how Steve can get Tony to live again after he’s gone through a slump. But that’s one of the many magical parts of Steve.
“Omega.” The command is just steps away from overwhelming, which he is almost hysterically grateful for.
“I do feel bad Nat, I do. And I want help in figuring out how to get it right. Tony has to be able to take care of himself.”
“I think we thought that there was only room for one of us. But since that’s not the case…” Steve trails off.
, independent of its torn off lower half, and strikes once, twice, again at the window in front of them.
It pleases him to no end watching Tony devour his kung pow chicken laced with pill four, and he hums, contented, as Tony finishes off a few boxes of lo mein and orange beef.
Steve, lovely, amazing Steve, stroked down his scapular and drug his fingers right down to Tony’s hole, his perineum, balls, and his hanging cock, stopping to swirl the head with precision.
The very thought of damaging Tony has his heart staggering. He’s done all of this against what would be any reasonable person’s wishes. Yes, the evidence suggests that it’s the right decision, but Steve can’t help but think that maybe it wasn’t. That Tony was better off staying as an Alpha and figuring out his rut problems on his own.
“I hate you,” Tony says it like the words surprise him as they come out, like it’s a question, not a statement.
And that was his reason right there; he owed it to Howard to rein Anthony in. He doubted that Howard would have arranged this entire thing if he knew what his son would get up to when he was gone.
“When my decryption finishes, we’ll know!” Tony claps his hands delightedly before striding back over to Bruce.
Tony kisses the way he fights, fast, brutal, efficient, giving no quarter and taking no prisoners. It’s like falling, flying, and floating in zero-G all at the same time. The way Tony moves should be banned in several countries, and it feels like Tony is examining the real estate of his mouth to settle indefinitely.
He’s been holding himself up for so long that it’s easy to fall to his elbows, chest pressing down onto Tony. He feels something between them, something hard, but Tony pushes him back up and away before he can get a handle on what it is.
Tony doesn’t bother to hide the smile and the tears trailing tracks down his face as he finishes reading. He fans his face with the paper, biting his lip as he does so, trying to stop more tears from escaping him. For all that Tony is capable of having anything he could want, for all that his life is rich—after all, he has more money that he could ever spend in his life, cars abundant, an entire Tower filled with enough technology to satisfy him for years to come, the Avengers, his suit,
“You say that now, but the act of parting alphas from their money involves having a facade. You don’t like my game face. It’s what you saw in that file SHIELD gave you. That’s the Tony Stark you’ll be going with.”
“So good to meet you. Do I call you Mr. Stark? Mr. America? Or just Captain?” Ty holds out his hand, his oily smile still lingering at the corners of his lips. Steve looks at it and realizes he has to shake it. He grips at it hard, not hard enough to break bones, but close. Using his strength, he yanks Ty closer, the man’s face showing evident strain under the handshake.
When he sees it, he’s thrown back to the time he visited the Royal Tyrell museum as a boy. They’d closed it down just for him. An ichthyosaur skeleton had been embedded in the floor, 75 feet long. The tines of the spinal column were locked in an eternal wave, the long dead creature making its final swim before having been encased in silt.
He only cared on the pettiest level that the government had the suit. What were they going to do? Attach pistols to its legs like that grindhouse movie?
“You’re usually a better negotiator than that.” Loki’s observation sounds offhanded, indifferent. But Tony knows better. The teams all think that Tony needs to soldier on. To try and wait it out or be there so that if things do turn out badly, they can find someone else who is drift compatible with him.
“I should leave. Or the big green angry guy is going to come out. But honestly I’m thinking it might not be that bad of an idea.” Bruce’s response was expected. Being science buddies was going to win out in the end, Steve knew. Tony’s friend wouldn’t leave him when he needed him most, and Steve respected that.
“If I had known you wanted me– I would have,” Tony pauses, his face twisting. “I would have let you have me.”
“I wouldn’t need to, likely. You handle that sort of thing well enough on your own.” Steve sets down his glass and he moves his hand to wrap around the glass in Tony’s and gently lifts it to his face, pressing the edge of the glass to Tony’s lips before tilting ever so slowly towards Tony’s mouth. He pulls it away after Tony takes a single swig, and raises it to his own mouth, hand still clutching Tony’s. He watches Tony’s eyelashes flutter as he traces the path up to Steve’s face. It’s a hungry look, cheekbones shadowed by the dimming light of the sunset, eyes lit from within like a supernova.
Rhodey walked at his side, uniform crisp and gorgeous in the navy blue suit that Tony had not-so-secretly altered and made just a bit better. The fabric looked exactly the same as the standard-issue, but the quality was all in the texture and malleability of the fabric. Pride surged through him to have such a friend as Rhodey. Throughout all these years they’d been together, he’d always shown up for Tony. Been there.
“I respect your brevity. It’s almost threatening, Fury. Put on your running shoes and get to the point.”
Looking wrecked, Rhodes starts to cry, and Steve wants to turn away from the other man’s emotions, but he’s not able to let Tony out of his sight with another Alpha in their midst.
“Yeah, you’re right, but old habits die hard.” He can feel his skin heat and he tastes shame like a hot fragment of metal on his tongue. He swallows, the action loud in the quiet of the room.
His shoulder is steadily aching now from where the wolf is clamped down. The sting of it grounds him and helps him remember not to move. Tony finds that he’s losing himself in the rhythmic sensation of having his thighs fucked.
“And what did you think of the scents?” Besides Cereal-man, they were mind-numbingly boring. He could smell how milquetoast all of the Alphas were. Eau de bourgeois.
Steve doesn’t know what to do at that point. It’s not late in the evening, but it is past dinner time. He decides to go for a walk and a subway ride, maybe towards his old neighborhood. It’ll take about an hour to get there, but it’s worth it. As he boards the train, he watches people. He’s always looking for things to sketch, but today it feels like he has a different reason for looking. Steve is supposed to find the names of three successful omegas. There’s a part of Steve that can acknowledge that things aren’t like they were, which is why it was more important than ever to ensure that omegas have proper deportment. There were more temptations.
“Or unsuit myself.” Lame. Very lame. He runs off before he can hear whether the Cap laughed at his dumb joke or not.
“I don’t know why I’m here, but I think listening to your stories has helped,” Steve murmurs, trying not to incite further censure.
But he’s good. He’s— he’s the best of men. Tony can tell. He can always tell when someone has ulterior motivations, even if he doesn’t know what they are. So the calm and expectant look on Rogers’s face when he then asks if he can hitch a ride to the carrier, well, Tony can’t say no. Tony would follow this man wherever he might want to take him, which means he’ll take him all the way to where he wants to go.
Daredevil to deal with. The first thing he does is fix Daredevil up with a cocktail of Extremis designed to give the man his sight back. Teen Abomination makes himself known by
“Time to look beautiful for me, San Francisco.” The air is cool, crisp, and glides around him like water. The world is his, and it sings it with every whip of the wind on his face.
Steve makes his blow job filthy, saliva dripping everywhere, coating Tony’s balls in cool liquid. Tony engorges more while he’s seated in Steve’s mouth, and Steve swallows every bit of his length down. Tony is rough in his throat, and it feels good to force his muscles to open up for the assault. He can feel the outline of the glans on his tongue, the velvet slide of skin over Tony’s cock.
It’s these moments that Tony knows with a certainty that while the Kaiju themselves don’t care about their lives, they’re too petty to be lacking in sentience.
. He needs Steve. The realization sends him spinning because while he knows he’s always had a crush, this isn’t like that. It’s a desire that feels like his brain is manacled to it, pulling him to grab Steve into his arms and press as close as he can get. To try and get under his skin and make a home there.
He makes it through a few of her unconsciously tossed barbs and what amounts for small talk with a solidity he doesn’t feel. His core is shaking, disassembling, and cracking with every smile he gives her. It melts inside him like soft wax, and he can feel his insides losing their shape. He’s becoming formless. Fear doesn’t know its own shape, because it lives in darkness. He can only feel the walls of his anxiety as they clench down on him and press, slippery on his carefully architected facade.
Tony grabs the letter and the lockbox. The lockbox holds a fingerprint scanner and Tony presses his finger against it, waiting half a second before the box beeps and unlocks, revealing a key.
“Want to smell me alpha? Want to make sure I’ve been fucking faithful to you?” Tony stalks over, body sinuously graceful as he inserts himself into the space in front of Steve. The scent is so strong and it coils in Steve’s nostrils like a snake. He fights to think above it, his mind clouded with want for what his body is telling him is on offer.
Tony tuts behind him and drags a cold metal finger along his crevice, causing Steve to shudder. The hand pulls away with a slight breeze over his cheeks, and it’s replaced with the metal head of the suit’s cock pressed against his entrance. Tony doesn’t hesitate before starting to push in. Each scale on the cock ripples into him, the ridges catching even with the copious amount of spit.
“Hey!” Tony puts a finger up for silence at his big green puberty problem after the kid snaps at him.
The package comes while he’s working with Rhodey on his braces. It’s gotten better now; his friend can walk and stand on his own with support. The new muscles he’s been using are beginning to strengthen.
The helmet peels apart under the onslaught, and Tony feels every drop of sweat and blood on his face, a warm brand that’s his only comfort as Steve brings the shield down, down, down onto his reactor. It slices his power supply in half, and Tony wants to scream at the unfairness of it, the helplessness he feels coursing through his body.
“I’m working on it Tony.” Steve suppresses a laugh and takes a bite of his food, thinking of all the future nights ahead of him with Tony that will be just like this. Besides when they’re fighting as a team, the only other time that Tony is amenable towards Steve is when he’s eating.
“Because—because they need alphas. Or I thought they did. I don’t—it’s that they’re weak, they’re not capable of—no that’s not right. It doesn’t feel right to say anymore, but I thought they were weak.”
“Yes. Well, um. I’ve had some trouble adjusting. And I got married. I guess, I guess that’s why I’m here.”
“Respectfully, fuck off. Look, if I am a genius asshole, I invent the uninventable—genius—, while I repeatedly verbally assault people in my personal space, and sometimes not in my personal space—asshole. I am a genius asshole. That is my way. And I may be misunderstood by polite society, but as a genius asshole, my dramatic tensions respect the standard semantics for adjectives and nouns. And I’m proud of it.” Talking was a way of avoiding the conversation that Steve wanted to have, which was one Tony did not need to hear.
As they lay together on the bed, Tony relishes the newfound closeness he has with his husband. These hands he’s holding have killed for him. He imagines he can feel the tremor of the lives taken with them on Steve’s skin.
“I held Sunset’s hand to her own neck and choked her with it. She recorded everything, Tony. I took it for you.” Tony groans and presses himself up against Steve, hard. The long planes of their bodies rub together like a washboard, each lean piece playing a tune of love as the muscles roll and shift together like a bow and its violin.
But maybe he wasn’t those things. Perhaps he was exactly what Steve said. Steve, who couldn’t lie, or misrepresent the truth. Steve said he was good, and sweet. And Tony thought, well, he thought maybe Steve meant it.
“Mr. Rogers.” The smooth British voice flows out from everywhere and nowhere at once. How elegant Tony’s technological marvels were just as elegant as he was.
“Like what you see?” The question is a little aggressive, but he wants Tony to want him too. He dreams about the man, even if sometimes it’s only in sensations and the wistful shadows of touch that he imagines.
Next was a brine-y flavor with a tinge of dead fish; the Alpha probably thought he smelled like the ocean. Then rotting wood in the forest. Fruit Loops. My god, an Alpha was out there, right now, walking around smelling like a cereal box.
Now it’s dark, and he looks around. There, through the trees, is the fire, its flames dancing merrily along, taunting him. Fuck. His head hurts. He touches his fingers to his forehead and they come away sticky. He’s certain that’s not pine sap.
“As long as you think omegas, including Tony, can’t handle their own lives, I think we have nothing more to discuss.” Pepper seems like a brilliant beta, so there could be merit to her views. But he thinks that maybe Tony has hidden a lot of his choices from her. Or somehow fooled her into thinking that it’s not as bad as it is.
“I think we can stimulate the blood we have already collected to grow more antibodies, but yes, we’ll need more at some point. I think we should test aerosol delivery. Tony, are the lower floors still filled with zombies?”
“Did that matter when Steve raped him? Did Tony get a choice?” Images of Tony spark in his mind, how much it took out of his mate to admit to his attraction. To wanting Steve. Tony made his choice when he chose to play chicken on the helicarrier. If he’d submitted without a fight, Steve wouldn’t have been interested. Tony had to have known what he was getting himself into, getting into it with an Alpha like Steve.
Finally, Steve can sense that they’re on the tail end of Tony’s heat, the smell lessening and the slick that Tony produces drying up.
“Say it with a little more enthusiasm this time. Don’t you love being mine Steve? Don’t you love me?”
He wakes up with a shout, body aching as if he’d just gone into the ice. Visions of swirling dark water flow over his mind, and he clenches up, shuddering.
“I tried to apologize to my omega, for spanking him. I didn’t realize how bad it is to do that. He’s… He’s honestly really amazing. I never realized all he does for other omegas. And I broke that trust with him, if I ever had it. And I don’t know how to get it back, if I ever will.”
Tony checks the thermostat from the wrist-band key that the hotel provided, and notes that the temperature should be normal. So why is he so hot? He throws his underwear back on so he doesn’t scare Steve and puts a hand to his head.
“And why would I give up your sweet, tight ass? I have everything I want.” Fuck. It hurts, and Tony wants to cry. But he also doesn’t want to give Steve the satisfaction.
“Yours, Steve, fucking yours.” At that, Steve collapses on Tony, and Steve rolls them over, carefully arranging Tony in front of him.
“I need ten hours of uninterrupted lab time today,” Tony blurts as he watches the cheese melt on top of the eggs.
“What’s the point, you still believe the same things you believed yesterday and the day before. I already don’t like that particular Steve. Do you already have a new Steve to show me?”
“Please, don’t fight?” Tony begs. Bucky and Steve both are clenching him tightly enough to bruise, and Steve is pressing his cock hard into Tony’s body as he growls at Bucky. They’re close to a dominance fight, their pheromones coalescing in the air, thick with animosity, and Tony doesn’t think he would make it out from in between them if they decide to turn their anger into a physical altercation.
“If I… cooperate, remember, you stay the fuck away from me when we’re on the field. Nothing changes, got it?”
Steve doesn’t expect Tony to renege on his word, not at all. But he knows how other alphas can be, now. He doesn’t trust anyone else.
“Well, yes, I was trying to get him to cook by having him cook all the meals. But he’s a terrible cook, so he just wasn’t eating. But I don’t know how to balance getting him to behave with his health! Am I supposed to just let him eat out every night?”
“Steve, I…” Tony trails off. This was nothing and everything like he imagined it. He doesn’t know what to say, what to impart to Steve to let the other man know how much this meant to Tony. Because it does mean something. He felt the sheer outpouring of Steve’s desire, his love for Tony, and it humbles him to know that Steve feels so deeply for him.
coffee Steve has learned to make. Yes, he’s forced to eat things like toast, eggs, bacon, bagels, donuts—if it’s a typical breakfast food, you could name it and Steve would make it for Tony. In order to acquire said coffee, Tony has to eat, Steve says—but all in all, that’s a fair trade to make.
Tony comes grumbling up the stairs of his own accord at around four pm, and Steve lets him fiddle with things in the kitchen before he approaches.
“I need to talk to you after that.” The Captain’s brow is furrowed as he gazes down at Tony. No way and no how is that ever going to happen.
“Fine. You’re sorry. You’re always sorry, you know that? It’s just for once I’d like to be in a situation where you don’t have to apologize and instead do the right thing. Is it too much to ask?”
Now that Tony is in his life, he’s lost to thinking about Tony standing next to him, holding onto his bag, not letting Steve carry it. The brightness of Tony’s eyes that he imagines is something he’s only seen in pictures, and he wonders when Tony stopped smiling, stopped wanting to be happy. He knows that it’s related to the hard time Tony is having with everything, but surely at the end of it, Tony will recover?
“Ok. I guess I have to trust you on that too.” She nods and then turns around, going back the way she came on the elevator. Steve is left alone with a ton of blankets and pillows.
“Yeah, it’s hard when two people who have an otherwise perfect relationship fucking hate each other. Though I guess I didn’t tell you about the helicarrier, did I?” He proceeds to do so while Pepper listens sympathetically.
“I was fourteen, in a school with mixed genders. Ty was older by a few years, and we used to makeout behind the football field shed. He gave me a few handjobs. Somehow my dad found out. Pulled me out of school and put me into an omega finishing school. I learned later that Ty was just angling to get into my house over the summer and steal research from my dad. That was the last time I was foolish with an alpha.”
is here. He can’t just be getting himself aroused with Steve around. Steve will smell it, and what will he think of Tony then?
He pushes his hips back to meet Steve’s thrusts, whimpering and crying, unabashed. A single twirl around the length of his cock, and he implodes. Hot, white-out pleasure races from the tip of his head down to the base of his scrotum, tightening up into his ass as it spasms around Steve’s hands. Cum shoots out of his jerking cock in fine, thready ropes that paint his belly and the bed below.
“Mr. Stark.” Agent Coulson looks harried as he strolls over. Which the man is unflappable, so Tony’s instinct is to suss out what’s wrong. But since SHIELD is coming to him, he’s got to play hard to get, regardless of where he stands with the intelligence agency.
