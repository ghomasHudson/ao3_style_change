Franklin also insisted I spritzed the letter with a scent he bought me a few years ago. I never really use it myself, though, as it tends to set off my lungs. But he said that it is a smell that suits me, whatever that means, and that you might like it. I hope you do. I also sketched my favorite view of the Island; I thought you might like that too.
And yeah, because of Cary Grant. I do not even know what the movie is about, but I have to see my man. Hopefully, it is at least decent. Or less traumatizing than Angel Street.
“Must be something fancy. Felt like a book to me,” Bucky mused. “I’ll try to get this dropped off in the morning before my shift, though. So it’s sure to arrive before his birthday.”
Do you want any references? I haven’t actually taken a picture of Jarvis for you, have I? I’m having everyone by since Rhodey is getting some time off at last. I think he and Pepper will probably end up being the shutterbugs this time. He’s been busting his ass so much. The letters from him aren’t as often as I would like.
… I also do not know what to do with the mental image of you nibbling on my ear. Got me feeling hot under the collar. Almost enough to make me forget October is almost here.
Just like part of him didn’t want to trust this idea that Ty was actually going to try for something steady between them; that they agreed to something mostly monogamous. They both had to have a few dates now and then with some women to put the effort to seem straight. But nothing serious and no sex with other people. Even with all of that, though, the brunet was still going to insist on protection. Jarvis had drilled that into his head very young the utter importance of it; he had lost numerous friends to the HIV/AIDS crisis. Tony could hope things would work with Ty.
I can only imagine Franklin tripping over himself. Gypsy Lee Rose truly is something else. And every minute I imagine the place, it sounds more and more dreamlike. They wouldn’t bat an eyelash at all at any little affections. Imagine dancing somewhere like that. With whatever music suited the whims of whoever was around. That would be great.
To be very honest, there were even more questions that went through his mind. Just how would a hickey look if he were to suck one right below one of the blond’s back dimples? And things along that vein. “You are just going to be trouble aren’t you,” he murmured towards his dick, glancing down at his lap. Tony wrote a fast note.
Steve snorted. “Liberate'' is one word for it. But. Better it’s being used to fix things than the alternative.” Moving out into the hallway, he effortlessly scanned for any change. “Where in the West you from?”
What I do is I’m an engineer. I design many things and try to build them myself. So my build tends to be fairly sturdy. I think you sound lovely. You must have long fingers that might be a little thin, tend to be smudged with lead or ink. Do you ever have to wash the lead from your face after a drawing because you’ve wiped your face by mistake? I have. Tell me more detail, does your hair tend to be more ashy or warmer? Does it lie straight or curl?
They didn’t reflect a home in the country. They didn’t reflect the, probably, seven dogs and twelve cats that would inhabit a large place they’d share. They reflected the fight in him, sure. But, they didn’t reflect his home. They would remember Captain America. They weren’t going to remember Steve. They wouldn’t know anything about Grant. And he wasn’t going to be able to shout back at him. Be able to shout about how much he loved this son of a bitch. This fucking ballsy man that was proclaiming his love on a piece of art that echoed to him now. Tony was still seated staring at the mural every moment wanting that hand on his shoulders.
The blond thought about it for a moment. “If you go to New York, there’s a couple of my pieces around. I worked for the Public Arts Project for a few years,” he explained. “A couple of murals.”
Maybe a movie or something can help us forget about the month if it’s in your budget. Just let me know okay and we can figure out something else to share or do.  I’ve got a library pretty close whatever is easier Grant.
Also, I get where you come from, in wanting to off Hitler preemptively. Makes you wonder just how much evil in the world would be averted if you had. A woman on the first floor of our building stopped receiving letters from her sister in Bulgaria a couple of weeks ago. They are real worried. Last she heard from her sister, the Jews were being gathered up for something. Franklin’s Ma says that it is never good when a government starts gathering up a single group of people, but especially not anybody associated with Hitler’s government. With each month that passes, I cannot help wondering what sort of evil we simply are unaware of behind enemy lines. Who is paying the price while we sit here, claiming this is not our war to get into? It seems like the whole world is at war, begging for our help, and all we do is wait around for something to go wrong. And I bet it will. The Japanese and Germans and Italians will not just let America sit back and do nothing; that would be a strategic error. Better to strike us while we are complacent and unready. If I were the president, I would already have prepared our defenses and started training troops. Make sure every needful thing was in place so we could be successful.
“Just an observation. There is more to life than what your doctor suggests. Also because I craved muesli, and I had to settle for Special K with a ton of fruit instead,” Demi answered with a frown as she took a deep inhale and pushed herself into a full handstand.
“Yeah.” Steve resisted the urge to hold the flowers even tighter, worried he might crush them. “Sent along enough for us to get some lunch too. Wants me to try to take care of myself today.”
“Feeding a super-soldier isn’t exactly easy,” he shrugged. “I get enough to get by. Resources get a bit thin on some of our missions.”
I’m working on a wireless phone that would hopefully be sturdy enough to survive yours and Franklin’s adventures into vigilantism. Or at least make a battery that can be recharged and handle that type of thing. It’s going okay at best. Trying to keep costs down is a nightmare. Might have to scrap it and try from another angle.
Tony smiled a little to himself looking over at Steve again. And then spied himself again. While this wasn’t the exact intimacy of the kiss in the park. The literal love letter on a wall. There they were, leaned in close Tony clearly more focused on watching Steve since he had seen Ella Fitzgerald and the setlist of this tour. Tony smiled to himself a moment before he watched Serena and Demi move to look closer.
A few moments later, he felt the warmth of a hand on his shoulder. Bucky had moved to crouch down beside Stevie. “I think you’d approve of this fella, Mrs. Rogers,” he said, his voice far steadier than Steve’s. “The way he makes your boy glow is like nothin’ else. And I know you always wanted Stevie to be happy, whatever that looked like. We just wish you were here to tell him that yourself.”
Do you need any inspiration? Because I think there are some musicians heading your way that are amazing.  All you have to do is ask. And you are going to make Rhodey’s year.
If he could just make it upstairs, Tony thought, he would be able to get coffee. Fresh, delicious coffee. Yes, that sounded nice. As he made it upstairs, Jarvis peered at him from over the edge of his newspaper. Two fresh mugs were waiting on the counter, one of which the elderly man pushed slightly forward. “Good morning,” he drawled, amusement making his green eyes twinkle. Tony grumbled a half coherent answer before burying himself in the caffeinated offering.
And … I might need more than just a couple weeks for the book. I love stories a lot, but there is a reason Franklin tends to read books to me. I do alright with short things, mostly, but books can be a bit of a challenge. As long as you are willing to go slowly, though, we should be just fine. So maybe one letter for the movie? And I can send you Pendragon’s drawing. Then over the weeks leading to our birthdays, maybe we can write a bit about the book. Or, if you would rather go faster, I can see if Franklin or one of his sisters can read to me. I do not know why I have so much trouble reading; the teachers thought I was something of an imbecile. The letters just sometimes dance or rearrange as I am looking at the page. Maybe there is something broken in my head.
And then there was Jarvis’s gift. It was wrapped in a paper decorated with a subtle lavender floral pattern - something Tony remembered Ana picking. She had said it reminded her of lilacs in the garden. Even now, her favourite flowers were growing thick and lovely in the garden, surrounding the bench she had liked to sit on in the afternoon sunshine. Seeing the paper was like receiving a kiss on the cheek from her memory; a gentle reminder that she was still so special to them, even years after her passing.
“Make it hard to focus when you keep moving,” Morita grumbled then looked at the huddled masses. “Guess it’s time to raid the supplies that were meant for their soldiers.”
Captain America and the Howling Commandos were the epitome of a pack. The alpha super soldier and his beta best friend led the team efficiently as they took down Hydra and helped push the Nazis back.
Bucky gave the flowers a careful glance. “I take it your engineer friend wanted to pay his respects?” he guessed.
There are a number of choices in this chapter and many places coming up that are very intentional. Especially when it comes to numbers. It'll make me very happy if any are guessed. -Pyrone
“You too, Tony,”  Pepper demurred before hanging up. Tony set the painting beside the mailbox and then finally saw fit to read Grant’s letter. Tony burst out with a laugh within moments and uncapped one of his ballpoint pens.
And I would pay money to see you dancing in your garage. It would be real fun to draw you dancing around or working on your cars. I bet you smile a lot while doing either, and that would be … real fine.
“That’s because they are the most fun and lead to you seeing your guy sooner.” Demi scrunched her face before shoving her mat back inside a bag he’d hadn’t noticed before now.
Ducking his head, he rubbed at the back of his neck. “That’s, um, very kind of you to say. Especially given how, uh, pretty you are?”
Just a heads up: there are mentions of and references to infidelity in this chapter, plus grieving Steve dealing with his mother's death
Franklin’s ma is fine with us using his room for self-defense lessons on one condition. We have also been teaching his sisters, too. His ma figures they need to be able to lay a fella flat if he gets any kind of untoward ideas. Honestly, the eldest is better at fighting than Franklin or I. Kind of funny, honestly, watching a girl my size just make a complete fool of her brother. She and Maria would be quite the pair. Probably take over the world.
"So suggestions then, Maria?" Tony asked as he toed around a tractor. He hoped it would provide cover so he could get a better vantage; he just needed to get to the door.
Adjusting his sketchpad on his lap, Steve quickly began to capture the bird on the page. He played a bit with the shape and scale of the image: making the chain longer so it could curl aesthetically around the bird, and he changed the engravings on the watch to better mimic what he knew of Edward’s aesthetic. And if he snuck his own initials into the drawing, well… who was going to tell? He then playfully wrote “is this you?” along the bottom of the page, mimicking the series of comics Edward had created in his attempts to figure out what Steve looked like. If nothing else, the drawing was a good start for a gift, especially as it was a combination of a special place and one of their inside jokes.
I’m trying not to make it that long for you to wait for me. Responsibility is a mean, mean thing and I’m trying to be responsible. I’m really stubborn too so we’re going to have to watch for that. I mean Obie isn’t young but he’s still sturdy and annoyingly healthy.
The basic premise of the movie was one Steve was familiar with: A woman was murdered, and her killer escaped. Years later, a married couple moved into the house and weird things began to happen. But it was far more sinister than he had ever expected. In the opening scenes of the film, barely on the heels of the credits, the old woman was strangled to death while staring right at the audience. A couple seats down from Steve, a woman actually fainted at the sight of such shocking violence.
As the summer began to bleed into fall, the pair continued to exchange what letters they could. Some letters were simply responses to chapters from The Hobbit while others were stories to fill the gaps - the sorts of things that Edward could write while on the plane or away on business. Steve loved the little anecdotes for what they were, but he could not help missing the easy conversation they had fallen into.
I have to leave town sometimes for work. I visit different factories or manufacturers in other parts of the country.  What I am thinking of doing is getting a friend to send a couple letters while I am away. Maybe you can tell me about your week. Also when your birthday is!
Expression softening into a smile, Steve played with the edges of the unopened letter. “Me too. He makes me so happy.”
He crawled to sleep finally in the garage, careful not to drop too heavily on top of Rhodey.  The Black man barely stirred on the couch, merely shifting to accept Tony’s weight as they drifted to sleep. Tony’s last thought before dreams claimed him was that he couldn’t even be sure if he’d left a date on the letter, but that was fine.
You want to drag me time travelling, huh? Sounds like a lot of commitment, if you ask me. Usually, a fella at least buys me dinner before he takes me through time and space. Plus, how are you expecting to pluck me out of Brooklyn if you do not actually know where I live? The borough is pretty big, after all. A guy could hunt around for a long time before he found me. You do not even know my name. Or what I look like. If you went asking after a short, skinny, blonde guy, people around here would give you funny looks.
Just in case that doesn't come through,  I am teasing.  So I can just imagine whatever brows. Alright, how have I failed in rendering what must be a fine jaw, Grant? An even sharper angle?
Tony sent the letter just before Maria strode down the stairs.  There's a message from Rhodey on his phone that must have come while he changed, Tony nodded and decided he'll check it later.
And if you do not like honey, I can always call you something else. Sweetheart, sugar, bird, darling, doll, dear, or even angel face. Or I can call you what I call Franklin: jerk or punk. Your pick.
when the man reached a conclusion. “Grant would love this movie,” Tony stated as he looked at the screen, on which was displayed a window box filled with roses. As the cheerful “The End” faded from sight, the brunet sighed.
On a day-to-day basis, he had loved his job. He loved inventing, problem-solving, showing ideas off and fix-its. He wanted Obie out of his life so he could do that again; to be able to move forward finally. Once home, Tony started a bath, shoved his dirty clothes into a basket, and dumped bubble bath into the water. He could feel the way every muscle in his back was wound tighter than a spring and needed to do something about that before even trying to train with Maria the next day. Tony nodded to himself as he made a plan to do some brainstorming after his soak.
Waking up 24, not in a fight with your extremely long-distance boyfriend, and surrounded by a group of women piled on a couch nest was amazing. Tony looked around to find a few of them playing on their phones, and he spied Demi on the raised floor going into a yoga pose that he had absolutely no idea what the name of was. Tony watched the front of her t-shirt slide down as she moved into a headstand. The way the long braid of blonde hair hit the mat and how straight and tightly she held her core and legs was some kind of art.
If it weren’t a conflict of interest, considering she was teaching him to fight and could kick his ass seven ways to Sunday, Tony would want to take Maria Hill for a drink. But, asking her out in any capacity would be something of a moot point, as she had been discharged for having a relationship with another woman. Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell was a nightmare, but at least it gave Tony an excellent teacher. She went to work quickly training him in a wide variety of combat techniques: drilling him in urban conflict, tactical thinking, and how to find spaces to hide in. Her taking his aim from pretty good to amazing was a great benefit too.
“I don’t know how to write with this. I’m going to break it,” Tony said around the lump forming in his throat. Tony ran his fingers along the body of the pen as if it would shatter under his fingers. Rising from their place on the loveseat, Pepper and Rhodey moved to wrap Tony in a hug. Leaning into their warmth, the brunet tried to blink away the tears that had begun to gather in his eyes.
After finishing his breakfast, because it never did to waste food, Steve retreated to his apartment to change into his Sunday best. Admittedly the shirt was too big - one of Bucky’s hand me downs - and the pants were wearing thin in the knees. But, the blond knew his ma would appreciate the effort for what it was. He then slung on his winter coat, ignoring the way it overwhelmed his figure, before going to collect Bucky.
February was still brutal for Steve, especially when letters from Tony were just a little sparse. He understood the man had to keep up with his work, especially as Obie’s behaviour became even more suspect. But, it was still hard. Steve still missed him and worried about him. Sometimes he felt so helpless - unable to do anything to keep his boyfriend safe. So, all he could do was try to be cheerful in their letters, encouraging him as best the blond could from so far away.
If you want something to design, how about a way to keep bath water warm? It seems like the water always gets cold before I have a chance to get real clean. Or maybe something to make the air cleaner. Seems like I cannot walk through the city without choking a little on all the smoke. Though, if you want something more nonsensical, how about a way for a person to fly without being in a plane? A jetpack maybe. Franklin would be in awe of you if you managed that one.
in a theatre that sizzled with a heady combination of dread and excitement. “Why’d ya wanna see this?” Bucky asked as they waited for the reels to start.
Because, I will be serious with you, honey. I just want to be yours. Whatever form that takes, I want to be yours. The way I feel about you has only grown the more we have written, and it survived the awfulness of last year. I would wait a hundred lifetimes if it meant I got to be with you, Eddie. You have become my northern star.
It runs in the family. I was taking things apart and putting them back together since I was four. It’s also something that keeps me calm. I like seeing how things work, I like knowing how they work. The last time I had talked to my dad, he’d been yelling at me because I accidentally broke a couple things because the vibrations from what I was fiddling with were knocking things off the shelf. My parents died in their vehicle that night while I was at home with Jarvis cleaning up the mess. The last thing my dad told me was ‘The only thing you’re good for is breaking things.’
Moving through the hall, Steve stood next to the omega as he tinkered on a broken radio. “Want to patrol with me?” he asked in a gentle murmur. “Get some fresh air.”
I wish so many things. In fact, it almost feels like all I do anymore is wish. I wish I could see the way a smile moves onto your face; I wish I could hear the sound of your laughter; I wish I could show you the places I love best in the city. But the thing about dreaming is that eventually you have to wake up. You have to accept that they might never come true. And sometimes I wonder … how long will it be before you and me have to wake up and face reality. The world you live in is so different from mine. We would get strange looks for walking around together, since you seem to be a posh celebrity and I am little more than a starving artist.
My safety has been a mixed bag for a lot of my life. But yes I agree: it is awful. The place is successful so he could afford any number of things I’m keeping busy to try to maintain my head. And well the next easiest option would be Manhattan for my work, I figure. But that is where he stays. I stay here because it’s the farthest I can be from Manhattan while staying in the States. Nothing good happens in Manhattan.
“It was left-over from my nephew’s gifts,” Rhodey said firmly. Tony bit his lip; like Tony, would be able to stop himself from buying fighter jet wrapping paper if he were to be in a place that sold such a thing. And use it on every gift he would give Rhodey while the roll lasted.
I could talk for ages about my friends; Grant, are you sure we want to go into this? Rhonda’s cooking has made me rethink my stance on faith. And interesting you bring up your friend being Jewish. My grandfather was Jewish. My father had a complicated relationship with it, and I wasn’t raised into it. My birth parents died while I was young. I guess here is where I’ll answer about what lead me to being an engineer.
Tucking the money into his pocket, Steve hemmed and hawed for a moment before also pulling out the dollar Eddie had sent him a few weeks back. The letter that had accompanied it had asked if the blond would be willing to take a photo at one of those new booths. Steve wasn’t so sure he would send the photo to the other man, but it would be nice to have one. In case he ever changed his mind. And, if he remembered right, Coney Island had one that had been installed after the World Fair. If not that, then they certainly had photographers for any tourists that wandered there or young couples taking a holiday. He would make it work.
Steve knew his mother would not approve of him getting drunk, but it was all he could do when faced with the emptiness of the night. Every other day of the year, he handled it just fine. But not on October 15th. Bucky was good enough to stay with Steve, making sure he did not get too sick or find his way into any trouble. If it were not for the potent sorrow of the day, it might even be fun - like old times, when they were mere children sharing a bed while Sarah was working the graveyard shift.
Tony could not hack his own company systems. He should not hack his own company systems. He was capable of it, but doing so would prove nothing because the evidence would not be admissible in any court. Which meant that Tony could not be the source of the information. And the situation with Obie was nowhere near that dire…. he thought.
Crouching down, Steve carefully cleaned off her headstone before setting the flowers across the top. His bottom lip wobbled as his spindly fingers traced over her name. “Hey Ma,” he croaked. “Brought you a real nice bouquet this time. I remembered how much you liked peonies. Always telling me about how you wanted a garden to plant some in one day, when I was a famous artist.” He rubbed his thumb at a bit of dirt stuck in the middle of one of the numbers on the headstone. “A friend of mine helped me get ‘em for you. I think you’d like him, Ma. He’s … he’s real smart. And he makes me happy.” Taking a shuddering breath, Steve tried to blink the tears out of his eyes. “Would you be happy for me? Would you still … still love me, Ma, if …” He could not even manage to choke out the words. Instead, he sat down hard on the ground and cradled his head in his hands, full-bodied sobs overtaking him.
“How best can I make sure Obie gets nothing in a will, Jarvis?” Tony asked in December with screens surrounding him as Jarvis watched the Dr. Who Christmas special. He’d managed to leave the Christmas gift unopened from Steve until after they ate.
Pendragon says you are welcome. I am paying him back for it by doing a portrait of him and Mark like they are fancy aristocrats. They plan to hang it up in their bedroom, once they manage to get an apartment together. And yeah, Mark is his muse and probably the best thing that ever happened to him. If they could, I think they would get married at the drop of a hat. They will probably have a small get together at one point, where they celebrate their love and all that. A wedding in everything but name and legal paperwork. I know Mark wears a token Pendragon made for him; it is a really pretty necklace with their initials and some lovebirds on it. Pendragon clearly put a lot of time into it, and you can see how much he loves Mark in how much attention he crafted into every last detail.
Steve drew his knees up a little further and balanced a hardcover book against their thin tops. He checked his pencil, making certain it was sharp, before turning his attention to the blank page.
Tony stared a moment, “So you’re telling me, this is like a precursor to those magazines with the coded phrases and abbreviations for gay guys,” Tony looked down at the little black mailbox and grinned. “That. Is. Incredible. I love it.”
Tony eventually woke up fully dressed on top of Rhodey; the smell of coffee tickling his nose as he gained some awareness of the world around him. He stumbled the stumble of the hungover and dehydrated, nearly tripping over a perfectly flat mat on the ground as he went. From behind him, Tony could hear Rhodey grumble something about pointy elbows before drifting back to sleep.
Jarvis hasn’t really moved on from his wife either. We haven’t talked much about it. But he really is my father in all the ways that count.
“Hallie figures you think you might get blackmailed. Or think someone would hurt them.” She paused. “I have some questions for you that have nothing to do with this. You inherited a ton of both merch and things that might have belonged to Captain America. Do you have anything fun that you know about? Or even just fun stuff from the ‘40s,” Demi asked, cuddling her pillow.
“Oh, you are going to love this,” Rhodey said, rubbing his hands together and leaning in conspiratorially. “Back in the 30s and 40s, being homosexual was illegal. So, they had to get creative in how to keep in contact, right? These types of boxes were a thing in the gay underground that would help you send letters and get letters from other like-minded guys. Y’know, secret meetups and love letters. A friend of a friend who works at the museum talked about how they got this in but they couldn’t put it in any of the exhibits properly. So basically I bought it off them, and now it’s yours,” Rhodey explained with a grin.
On one hand, I think I could see Obie being just like Paul. But if that is the situation, I need more than manipulation to prove he’s doing something. I need to find more evidence. I need to convince the people around me or find a way to. I think the police would need to be involved before I try to even get him away from my inventions.
I have seen a platypus and that is one of the nicknames I have for Rhodey. He has way too many nicknames and I am probably going to have far more for you. Sometimes I wonder if whatever’s up there has a sick sense of humour sometimes.  But well I’ve made it out of everything so far right?
You know how you have trouble with your dad? How he made you feel and that sort of thing? I, uh, do not have any good memories of my father. I was born not long after he left for war, so I never got to meet him before. Ma always said the war changed him - that it made him sick. All I know is that the man who came home was a wild drunk who would take his temper out on anyone at the drop of a hat. All my memories of him were tiptoeing around, trying to escape his notice. Hiding under the mattress in my room when he started screaming at my ma. The bruises and welts from when he would catch me.
Tony had heard a story from his aunt Peggy about how Howard had once met Carole Lombard. How it was during a New York premiere, and they went for drinks after. Peggy had said something about, “He’d found her quite lovely. This was prior to meeting your Grandmother, you know, and he’d meant to take Carole for a proper date. But that never quite happened. They had chatted and planned, but it never happened. It always bothered him.” Later Howard learned Carole had died in a plane crash. The Starks had awful luck when it came to love and vehicles.
That startled a little laugh out of the blond. “I guess. But I ain’t even sure how to ask him. Or what to say to him.”
Steve’s heart ached for the mysterious brunet. Losing your parents was bad enough, but to lose them under such circumstances? And it honestly sounded like Edward’s father was a real piece of work - the type of person Steve would get into all kinds of arguments with. Reading the obvious pain in Edward’s words made Steve wish he could gather him close into a hug. But, that was one of the difficulties of their communication: they could not even share a secret smile across a room. The Brooklynite wondered if they would even meet or if letters would be all they ever had between them. His heart ached a little at the thought of feeling so alone for the rest of his life.
“Your cereal selection sucks by the way,” Demi muttered, opening her eyes. Tony looked up and offered a small smile as he rested his arms on the back of the couch.
Hopefully maybe something that might make things a little lighter for you. It’s a reimagining of Jarvis. If he were to be something at least partially robotic.
George asked me to bring some of my art past his office. I might get to do some work for Harper’s Bazaar! Can you believe that? My art, in full color, in something like that. He said if my stuff is good enough, he might be able to get me in with some other places. I almost could have kissed Pendragon for introducing me to these people.
I never got to know my mom enough to know whether she would have been able to move on. I haven’t been able to forgive my dad for probably driving them drunk into whatever accident it was. Or even whatever happened that night. So I can see Valentines’ being ruined.
“Yes ma’am. I’ll uh, I’ll do that. We’ll plan more tomorrow. But yes, I think he’ll like it,” Tony nodded as he shivered a bit. Maria left the moment he started emerging from the tub and waved a short goodbye.
Steve was not entirely sure how spending so much time in February House became part of his life, but he was happy to feel like he belonged somewhere. He and Peter got on like a house on fire, and Lee started referring to Carson and Steve as her “little chickadees.” She did not baby the pair, per se, but she did fuss over them – since they were both so prone to getting sick.
And thank you again for the book. Franklin and I have been practicing from it when we can. I even managed to knock Franklin on his back the other day. It felt amazing. Though, it has not helped my luck in fights with bigger fellas. The day Pendragon drew me, I had a split lip and banged up knuckles from a guy who was flipping girls’ skirts. Next time I will be better prepared.
I know it has not been very long since my last letter, but Franklin said my first effort was ‘a piece of work.’ So, I thought I would try again. Just in case the first one maybe did not convince you I was worth writing back to.
Typically, my resolution is to survive a little longer. Mostly because Franklin tells me that is my job. We have had too many close calls for his comfort, I guess. Not all of which were the fault of illness and my remarkable ability to find a fight. But this year… maybe I will try for something beyond survival. Maybe this year I will try to get more jobs doing art. It is what I truly love, and I think I am pretty decent at it. I am sure there is some way to make it work.
"Well... if you are offering it with a kiss," Tony frowned a small moment. Before letting Ty swap spit and pill.
“How about I put myself to use while you’re doing that. Sergeant, can I see your rifle? I’m just going to give it a quick clean and reassemble if you loan me your kit.” Tony asked with a small bit of discomfort as another scratch was promptly cleaned.
“Yeah, I guess you’re right.” Steve slowly opened the envelope and slid the sheaf of paper out. “Buck... I dunno if I can read this. What if he’s a greaseball? Or if he wrote back only to tell me to shove off because my letters were awful?”
Stooping, Steve carefully pulled out the photo and gazed down at his likeness. His hair was a bit feathery as it swept over to the side of his face, and the stark shadows of the booth made his eyes stand out - even in black and white. The shot was surprisingly good. Almost like Steve was offering the viewer the flowers, hiding shyly behind them in a bout of nerves. It was cute. And definitely not platonic. Slipping it into his coat pocket, Steve went back into the booth and sat down once more. Another coin, and another photo. This time, though, Steve gazed into the lens with a soft smile. Sure, the photo wasn’t as pretty as the first one, but it was definitely safer. With a nod, he slipped the second photo into his pocket before leaving the flowers in the booth, hoping someone would find them and enjoy them before they wilted too badly.
“Not sure why I got put on medic duty today but here we are. There’s nothing wrong with your legs right?” he drawled inspecting Tony’s arms and neck. He did poke at the healing scratch on Tony’s forehead and examined it with a small squint.
I just hope you get to see them, Eddie. Maybe I will have to paint some of your friends into it, just to give you extra good reason to come see them.
Walking into the cemetery, Steve easily navigated through the lines of headstones to the considerably less grand corner where his mother was buried. It always struck him as a bit funny that even in death how much money you had in your pocket determined how much people valued you. His ma had deserved the finest headstone and a lot with a beautiful view, but all he had been able to afford was a small plaque tucked into the most obscure corner. At least her grave was easy to find, as it was right near the gardener’s shack and the wall.
Also the movie they refer to as Angel Street is known as Gaslight to the rest of the world. The version they watch is the 1940 movie. Which studios in America marketed as Angel Street to make sure it wouldn't be confused with the movie they were making with the same title and based on the play of the same name.
Tony finally exhaled as he read about Grant wanting to hear about Rhodey’s family. He’d happily talk Grant’s ears off about the Rhodes family and Jarvis. Tony started making his notes into something more coherent as he thought about how to answer Grant’s last question. How was he going to explain Steve Rogers, Captain America, to Grant? Obviously not using any of those names. He’d figure it out in his draft.
It was a golden time for the two men, as Tony travelled for business and Steve worked on the Carlyle mural. Their letters were soft exchanges of affection mixed with anecdotes from their childhoods. Tony, for instance, learned that Steve actually spoke Gaelic, but he had such a terrible Brooklyn accent that it had made Sarah despair of him ever being fit for Ireland. And Steve got to hear about the first time Jarvis tried to teach Tony to cook. Genius though he may be, the brunet had still somehow managed to swap the sugar for salt, resulting in cookies that made Jarvis gag the moment he placed one in his mouth. The young man had been devastated when the Brit had immediately thrown all the cookies away, but it had become a point of amusement between the pair. Jarvis, sassy as ever, had carefully labelled all of the ingredient jars for “safety’s sake” from then on.
And when March finally bloomed like a breath of fresh air, the Brooklynite had hopes that things would take a turn for the better. Until Arnie came to deliver some difficult news. After the redhead left, Steve sat down on the windowsill and stared blankly out the window for unfeeling hours. Then, unbending his body with a crack, he moved to grab a piece of paper.
The Irish-American’s thin lips pulled into a decided pout. “Buck, come on. It’s my letter. You can’t keep it from me.”
Tony watched Maria come in with a briefcase in addition to her gym bag. Tony had a feeling there were changes coming.
She always said she could never love another man the way she loved my father, because when he left he took her heart with him. I do not think I can ever forgive him for hurting her like that.
“Ready for Jarvis and I to school your friend?” Maria grinned as Jarvis followed with a smile. Maria waved her fingers ominously and Tony couldn't help but grin.
I don’t think loving those we do is a sin. Love is a decisive motion that is guided by faith and trust in people. Something like that. If we were put here to love then I don’t think there’s a sin in following through on any actions of trust. We should not be guilty of thoughts, only actions. And if they are actions born from kindness, of something good. Then there is no sin to them. The action of loving someone romantically, the decision of deciding, yes, yes this is the person I want, is something that is between themself and the person in question. God and the church have no damn business getting in there.
If it’s someone you are in a relationship, where you’ve already been kissing them and are close with, it’s building on those feelings - just taking it further. You watch and listen, and see what feels good to your partner. Just, you aren’t limited to shoulders up.
I don’t trust Obie further than I can spit either. To keep Obie distracted, my goal is to date a couple of women Pepper knows - models. Maybe all of them, if I can swing it. Hopefully, keep him off the scent of what I'm actually doing, which is trying to find something dirty enough I can kick him off the board. I’m not really looking for a relationship with any of the women, though.  I’m telling all of them something like that too. You know, bait the press, make it seem more like what didn’t happen, happened. Maintain a certain reputation. Because that is what Obie expects: that all I am good for is fooling around with drugs and sex.
Looking back, Steve could see it all so plainly. The way Edward had casually flirted and kept his distance. And then the way it slowly bled into something better, more honest, as the letters continued. Steve knew his feelings for the other man were simply not going away, not even after the entire situation with Ty. Maybe they never would. Holding the letters to his chest, Steve closed his eyes. “I hope it’s okay,” he murmured to himself, “if I love you for just a little while, Eddie. I promise I won’t tell.”
I think it would be a blast to hang out with Franklin and you. Franklin and I could talk about the sciences and science fantasy until we actually make it to the moon. All else fails I design more impossible things and draw more Robot Women. Just who would we be menacing Grant?
“You’re just fine,” Arnie said with a laugh. “Means you look real relaxed in the drawings, so it works out swell.” Taking them off the board, the redhead passed the sketches over. “Figured you might like a couple to pick between. Plus it was good practice for me.”
After his breakfast (or lunch, more accurately), Tony made his way down to the lab and blinked at his many projects. Rather than even attempt to work, he simply collapsed on the couch to ride out the rest of the trip. When he awoke much later in the day, he at least felt vaguely human. If a human had been run through a blender a few times before being poured back into its casing. Head throbbing, he sat up and squinted at the lab. At least everything was in focus, which was a big improvement.
October 15th was not a pleasant day for the Rogers-Barnes contingent. Winifred Barnes did her best to soften the start of the day for Steve by making his favorite breakfast, though without his ma’s famously crispy bacon. The lack of it on the plate, however slight it seemed, served as a sharp reminder that life was a bleaker place without Sarah to brighten it. And boy did he feel ridiculous for tearing up over bacon of all things.
I think about you a lot. And imagine you lounging sometimes sketching away while I tinker around.  It makes the place feel less empty when Jarvis is working on his family affairs. I am about to work on the writing portion of the gift and once that dries it's with you.  I can't shake my excitement about seeing you. Even if it's not your face. It is something.
“Just what would you have added?” Tony asked, watching Demi sit. She crossed her arms and looked up at the ceiling.
“You and me both,” Steve said with a laugh. “Not sure how many more disasters I can take before I just give up on social interaction.”
Friday scanned the latest letter from Grant just before Tony left for his flight. It would be a few days before he would be home, so the company in addition to Pepper would be nice. He laid back in his seat working on the reply.
"No, not at all. I am calling it a missed connection which just shows how much I should work on networking.  And I mean they should at least know me by some reputation Ty." Tony grinned and tried to wave the situation off - trying to remain calm.
All that from walking into an active experiment room at NYU. And then waking up in a field near a hydra base in 1944.
Losing her had been like finding out summer would never come again. Four years later and he still felt the ache of her absence. And he wondered, cruelly, if she ever regretted having him. If she ever regretted taking the job at the hospital in an attempt to keep her boy alive. Deep down he knew she would never regret it, and she most certainly would never regret him. Even on her deathbed she had only expressed love and gratitude for her son. But the shadows in his mind made him doubt that love; or, rather, doubt his worthiness for that love.
As for getting enough. Well, we do the best we can. Lately Franklin and I have been lucky to pull some steady work. I am painting watch faces of all things. It is tedious, but it does give my mind time to wander a bit. And being able to pay the rent is always a good thing. If we get another week like this, I may even be able to go see a few pictures! I have been hoping to see Angel Street when it comes out, but it will really depend on me not getting sick. So far so good, though.
Vegas is usually pretty great, I liked China and Japan when I was roaming them more. I like prefer being on coasts more - being near the ocean instead of landlocked. But with the shows out there it is worth adding to the bucket list. I like gambling once in a while, only because probability is fun math when it’s dice.
Bu- But. Frankling says Ma would like you. Like the fact you make me smile. Apparently I’m a real stick in the mud a lot of the time. But you make me happy. And that’s a good thing. You’re a good thing. Eddie… I want you to have good things. Are you happy? I want you to be happy. If you’re not happy, you should just… fix that. Because you should.
Steve chuckled at the way Edward jumped to match his level of weirdness. It boded well for their ability to be friends. After all, what was life without the chance to laugh together? Acting on a whim, the blond grabbed a sheet of paper and did a stylized drawing of himself as a knight, drawn to scale. His armor was dulled and the finery on his horse tattered with wear. The tiny knight leaned into the bulk of the animal as though its black body was the only comfort he had in the world. Around them Steve filled in the background with what looked like a particularly awful swamp. He was, however, also very careful to leave the knight’s helm firmly on so his features could not be seen.
“It’ll look better that way! Trust me. He’ll love it.” Arnie carefully went about selecting the pencil he wanted first. “Come on, Stevie. Light’s a-wasting.”
“If it goes as you said, I might be able to get you Julie’s personal number. She could use the boost,” Hallie added as Tony finally set a date.
I wish you didn’t go through that. Neither of us deserved that shit. Neither of our moms deserved it. Been trying not to fall back on the bottle as much. It might be a family curse. Nothing you or your ma could have done would fix it. The same goes for me and my mom. So October and February are bullshit. Throw in December for me and we will have a quarter of the year written off for bullshit. Sounds good.
“Yeah, from your secret club.” Bucky narrowed his eyes at Steve. “But I ain’t givin’ it to you until you get scrubbed up and eat somethin’. I’d be willing to bet Becca’s new shoes you have barely eaten so much as a crust’a bread since the last time I was around. I didn’t know you could get any skinnier, Stevie, but somehow you’ve done it.”
Tony laughed as she did some kind of leg routine before lowering herself again. “Did I miss any other dietary requirements?”
“That’s fair, captain,” Tony nodded. He knew for a fact there was nothing ever mentioned of any omegas with them so he would have to be discreet. “Even if they did, it would be easier to keep me unmentioned.”
Nodding, the brunet tipped his head back in a pretense of checking the weather. “Seems reasonable to me. Kind of him, too.”
Grant, I want you to flourish. And I am sure you will find a way to do it. I’ve made something of a small gallery of your work in my garage. I’m thinking of moving my preferred writing seat closer to where I have it set up. But I would need to do some heavy rearranging. And I could probably write down what my friend Pepper says about your pieces.  She likes them for starters.
He had to cool his jets. And then get on some jets and make some calls. But first, he had to finish penning in some additional advice before sending his letter.
I did most of my celebrating before the week of Christmas because I can’t sleep that week. I usually drink a lot to try to sleep, but I was trying to avoid that this year. Safety. So what I did was attend some parties and make sure all of my group got their gifts early. I sometimes decorate for the holidays, but only if I’m hosting. So this year was pretty quiet, honestly.
Tony sent the letter with a couple pictures Pepper had snapped of him and Rhodey working on the Ford in November. December was not a good month for projects, so he’d have to call Rhodey in soon to get that going again. Tony then walked back into the dark room and reluctantly started on the pictures that he must have taken in December. As he worked on them, a slightly embarrassing fact became clear: drunk him was a damn hussy for the camera. Especially if it was for pictures for Grant. Also his ass had gone from nice to
What if I were to help you out that day? Make a day of it for yourself and Franklin if he joins you. If she had a place she liked to eat, go there if it’s still open. Write to me, tell me what you see there, do a drawing if you have the paper. Go to mass and get those flowers. I think having less sun does something to people in the winter. Think about all the ghost stories people make up in the fall and winter.
“Gooseberries, black currants, I think that would have had me covered,” Demi grinned as she watched Tony make a mental note. She moved off her mat and started rolling it. “How is your tech disaster friend?”
“I forget sometimes that you only help curate the art portion of things on my walls,” Tony quipped as he brought the certificate down from near the door. He worked quickly to get the certificate free.
I am in California in a position that makes me really anxious about going anywhere near New York. I’m now in a bizarre position where I’ve befriended 13 women who are willing to lie and try to help me cover up our relationship to make sure we stay as safe as possible. But I know there is always some kind of danger in regards to Obie until I get him locked out and down. I want you to be safe. At least as safe as I have any measure of control over.
Because I also don’t have any solutions for our predicament yet. I haven’t had time to dedicate properly to that. There is so much math involved, Sunshine. And figuring out work over there. A lot of things. But I have daydreamed about it. My question is. Until I figure it out, would you be content with our correspondence? Or is there more you want? I don’t know any solutions yet but I won’t know that until you ask.
Tony read the letter and grabbed the nearby notepad, scribbling out his reactions as he went. Tony took a few pauses as he read to go over sentences again. ‘Flustered and enthralled’; Tony nibbled at the pen cap of a handy ballpoint to keep from giggling like some school girl. And he made the guy blush. God. And then there was that amazing sketch of someone’s hands.
At least I am reassured by the fact you like it. Franklin and his family mean the world to me. Part of me hopes one day you could meet them, though I think you and Franklin spending time together might give me gray hairs. You are both absolute menaces.
I’m a bit anxious if I were to ever become a father. I keep thinking I would mess up somehow or become as messed up as the other guys in my family. Good ol’ family curses you know?
Wandering over to it, Steve traced a finger over the R that curled its way across the heavy paper. Did he feel up to reading a letter? Going back over to the stove, he carefully put his pot of water to boil and prepped his cup. All the while keeping one eye on the envelope.
Michael hummed thoughtfully. “Well, that’s where communication with your partner is important. Being intimate might mean different things to you than it does to him. And if he’s an experienced lover, he might have ideas for things you could do that wouldn’t be harmful to your health. A good partner would want you to be healthy and happy and comfortable.”
By the time the end of January rolled around, the mural at the Carlyle was nearly done. Steve managed to get a photo taken of the section behind the bar, where Ella was clearly singing with her entire soul. The blond had been so pleased with his work that he had told his boyfriend that it might even be his masterpiece. Of course, that probably had more to do with the fact it was the biggest piece he had ever done rather than the quality of it. Because, while it was very good, it lacked the same level of warmth and intimacy usually found in Steve’s work. He had captured the magic of the concert, certainly, but he knew his own feelings from the experience - those of intense longing and love - had no place in the setting. So, he had carefully crafted a piece without those things, leaving it a bit more empty than it otherwise would have been.
He wrote and stayed in for the rest of the night. The nightlife wasn’t calling out to him. It was maybe a glass of Wine with his late-night snack. Tony attended the meetings only a little tired. He presented everything he had planned.  He avoided Obie. Tony made his way back to the second mural alone.
“Yes. Want to know what helped lead to him getting all these murals?” Tony asked with his phone at the ready. Ready to show off the magazine covers he’d had Friday dig up.
Steve nodded slowly to himself. “Funny thing? He mentioned being adopted by friends’ families. And the way they feed ya and take care of you.”
“Part of the effort, one of them is going to the Navy. Or actually, I think he is part of it by now. Maybe coffee? I just worry something weird would happen to it.” Tony slowly rolled himself off the couch not putting any weight against his shoulder, then moved to follow and help.
“Processing a new command I popped into his programming last week. There he goes.” Tony grinned as the bot finally made his way toward the brunet with the letter in his claw. Tony watched him with a grin and then yelped as the bot nearly dropped the letter into the tub; catching it in just time. “Okay, close enough for now, thank you. That was nearly a disaster.”
Have my efforts on the shape of your face now given me anything closer to your face? I think I might start nicknaming the different faces I have drawn now. Because that being said. I have come a long way with that. Are you still annoyed with the facial hair on what I have nicknamed the Grant Musketeer?
Throughout it all, Steve did his best to keep his boyfriend up to date on his artistic endeavours. He often sent sketches of pieces he was working on, including a rather detailed portrait of Louis Armstrong wailing on his trumpet that was set to greet visitors as they entered the bar. There was also an entire wall filled with dancing couples, pressed cheek to cheek as they moved to the imaginary music. True to form, Steve snuck Jarvis and Ana into the group of dancers. And he painted his own ma seated with Winifred and George at a table in the room. He was also sure to include the many amazing Black performers and artists he had seen in the clubs he and Buck had ventured to. The owner of the Carlyle had been quite fidgety when he had noticed, but Steve had explained that it simply could not be a true jazz mural without them. Plus, Steve thought to himself, jazz simply would not exist without Black people, so why shouldn’t they be featured? If he could have gotten away with it, the entire audience would be filled with the Black Americans who made Harlem what it was.
“Took the better part of three months. I think he’s hiding out behind you watching Ella Fitzgerald.” Tony explained watching Demi frown before tilting her head, then shifting her entire body.
Spinning to face them, Arnie planted his hands on his hips. “Michael Bech, don’t you sass me. I could get inspired. And what would I do if I was inspired and didn’t have what I needed?”
Tony stared at the new letter in his hand, this time not even bothering to run it through Friday. He opened the envelope after sitting himself down on a stool, diving right into reading the impossible letter addressed to him. Well, technically for Edward who didn’t exist, but still him; this was his letter getting responded to. This is a thing that was actually happening. Tony Stark was corresponding with a Brooklyn artist from the forties. A probably cute, gay as hell artist, that must have been heckling his friend to no end.
Grant,  St. Grant patron saint to those tired, scrappy, creative, good souls who are in over their heads. First of all, I am both sorry for your friends and for you. But you have to keep your head on your shoulders.
Inside of the house was every inch as eclectic as the outside hinted at. They stepped into an entryway, where a rather intense-looking man with piercing dark eyes took their coats. “Arnie, glad you could make it! And who are these fine chaps?”
"You are the one with the flight, I am also going to work on some drafts and can block the light from you better here," Tony explained with a grin. There was also the text from Rhodey to read and reply to.
Franklin would think it is a hoot and a half that you think my honesty is refreshing. I think he curses it a blue streak at least once a week if not more. Says my mouth gets me into more trouble than I have any right to. But, honestly, it is not my fault that bigger men do not bother to take a stand for what is right. Just means a little guy like me has to do it for them. Of course, that did lead to me getting my knuckles scraped up real bad last week. But they have healed over real good; my ma taught me all about how to dress a wound so it should not scar over or anything. But maybe a suit of armor or a shield would be a good idea. Might actually give me a shot at winning against those big fellas.
, could see them. George had shared a secretive smile with Steve and simply said, “Might as well see that our artwork comes from someone in the family. Got to look out for each other.” Bucky meanwhile was practically sat at Lee’s feet, listening with rapt attention as she talked about her performances. It was funny to see a woman utterly immune to Bucky’s charms. If the smile on Lee’s face was anything to go by, it seemed much more like Bucky was the one being toyed with than the other way around.
Tony sent the letter with a small assortment of drawings of Grant with different sets of brows. Sometimes growling about weird torture with tweezers. One of the drawings was with the Groucho Marx Brow with an angry “No!”
The cologne did not smell stale, as Tony had expected. Instead, it smelled soft, nice, like some flowery smell, and a little fruity. Maybe a little vanilla. Definitely not like it was sprayed several decades ago. On the outside of the envelope was the same writing as before, and Tony was even more confused as he opened the letter.
When they arrived at the hotel, Serena gaped up at it. She knew of the Carlyle, sure, but going inside with Tony Stark at her side was pretty much the last thing she ever thought would happen in her life. And then Tony’s coat was swept away for cleaning while her coat was simply checked. “Anybody ever tell you you’re hella rich?” she murmured under her breath. Clinging to her bag like a lifeline, she walked along with Tony into the bar.
“I apologize, Sir,” Steve said with a nervous tone in his voice that only Tony could pick up on. Steve knew he could because his hand was squeezed a few times.
“I’m very eager to get to know him more, he’s got potential in more ways than one,” Tony added on with a small wink as he looked over towards his husband.
Needless to say, the guys were terrified. They quietly filed into the line that was leaving their sector and heading towards the main hall, having quickly squeezed each other’s hands in reassurance, each of them trying to stay strong for the other two.
By the time it was Bucky’s turn to run the course it was damn near downpouring, but again no one, not even Bucky dared to complain. As he reached the end of the course his left arm was starting to freeze up at random intervals. Bucky cursed to himself but completed the course without protest. Just passing it off as sore muscles to the few people who actually noticed and asked.
They moved back over to their bed and after a few minutes of silent contemplation, Steve spoke up, “I didn’t mean to freak him out, I was just trying to say how you have some cute nicknames for those you love and he was going to get to learn some more.”
“It’s a long story, we can discuss it later, right now I’m gonna see if you were telling the truth about leaving enough hot water for the rest of us.” Bucky chuckled, closing the door behind him, hoping the other two didn’t notice he tensed up as the question was asked.
“There’s definitely more to that story, I could hear it in his voice, and I don’t want to force him to talk if he isn’t ready, but I have a feeling this is going to come back again tonight. I’m intimately familiar with the after-effects of a flashback.”
It was there he was given almost the same monologue on how his punishment was going to set him onto the path of “redemption” in the eyes of Hydra. He then was forced to watch as his arm was efficiently, in a morbid sense of the work, cut off by the commander of the Cell.
“I bet you are all curious as to why I’ve called you in here this morning. Especially considering you are just our beginning computer workers. Well, we want you to become more than just our little computer minions, to be an effective soldier of Hydra, one must have multiple skills they can give in service of the greater good. So today you are all being sent out on the basic training course.”
“It’s not as bad as it sounds, but maybe I’ve just gotten used to it, you can decide for yourselves starting tomorrow. For now, we should probably find something to eat and get some rest, we’ll have to get up early to get into disguises, you two have some pretty recognizable faces.” Bucky chuckled towards the end.
“Ah, safehouse, shitty safehouse. How I have not missed you.” Tony said as they entered, plopping his bag down on the ground.
Bucky then handed a bowl to Steve and then grabbed one for himself. They all sat down around the small plastic folding table and ate in comfortable silence.
Bucky didn’t remember much after that because he passed out from blood loss, but when he woke up he was sitting in the base’s small medical area with a metal arm in the place where he had his flesh one that morning.
And just as it did last night, a pang of emotions hit Bucky like a pile of bricks but then disappeared as soon as it came. Though this time it wasn’t jealousy that was mixing in with the longing, it was something else, a feeling deep inside him that Bucky couldn’t quite pinpoint, but it made him feel like he just wanted to protect the small man standing in front of him with every part of his being.
“Where did you get such fancy tech? I've never seen it in SHIELD before, and I sure as hell didn’t make it. Was it Hammer, oh god I hope not you can’t trust anything that man makes.” Tony continued rambling on to himself.
The memories flooding back into Bucky’s head caused him to zone out yet still completely absorb Tyler’s punishment taking place in front of him, it was almost an exact recreation of his own punishment, except Tyler would be receiving a new leg instead.
The whole facility cried “Hail Hydra” back so loudly that the echo ran throughout the tunnels for a few seconds.
There was a moment of silence before Tony cleared his throat and words came back to him, “I’m Tony Stark-Rogers and this is my husband Steve Rogers-Stark. It’s nice to meet you Bucky.”
This also captured Steve’s attention, his expression immediately melting into one of concern and care.
“I’ll be ready to get up when that happens. We’re going to make sure he knows he isn’t alone anymore.” A caring smile coming back across Steve’s face.
“I think I’ll start by fixing up his arm, I’ve got a set of precision tools in my bag, rain shouldn’t cause that thing to break so easily. Though this will just be a temporary fix, as soon as we get home I’m making him a brand new arm with the best technology around.”
The three men continued talking while carrying their bags to the bedroom and beginning to try to make a home out of this place.
But when he got back out to the bedroom, Tony and Steve were fast asleep, nearly entangled in each other’s limbs. A quick pang of what could be described as something between jealousy and longing hit Bucky, but then it left as soon as it appeared.
They led him out of the base and into the car. Tony nearly flew out of the parking lot and was speeding the whole way back towards the safehouse, determined to get Bucky as far away from the cause of the flashback as possible.
The couple stared at each other and then back to Fury, Steve finally breaking the silence, “Not that we know of sir.”
As soon as he found a comfortable position the other two men scooted closer and enveloped him in a protective cocoon of a hug.
“Let me guess, no coffee?” Steve said with mild amusement in his voice, “We’ll get some when we go to the store today, okay hon?”
The basic training course was pretty much a run of the mill course that could be found on an army base, except this one was painted black and red with Hydra symbols on anything and everything in the course.
Tonight Steve took the spot on their bed that was closer to Bucky so he would be able to get up and over to their boyfriend quickly and without having to climb over Tony.
“I agree.” Steve said with a small nod, “I also quite like him, at least from the little we’ve seen so far.”
If you had told Bucky at the beginning of that month the end of the mission he was going to have finally discovered the loves of his life, he would have never believed it. After all, he never expected more out of life than work because he thought there was no one out there for him. And if you had told Steve and Tony that their hearts would grow to both love the same man so deeply that it would be now impossible to imagine life without him, they would have said that wasn’t ever going to be a possibility.
The Quinjet landed silently outside a small safe house in what seemed like the middle of nowhere. It’s a small unassuming building on the outskirts of a tiny town, everything seemed so calm, it was hard to believe there was a Hydra base anywhere near here.
The three men walked off the ramp and through the building's front door. The inside housed a small kitchen, a common room with a couch, a bedroom with 2 beds, and a decent-sized bathroom, all SHIELD safe house quality aka like a sketchy roadside motel.
“That sounds like a great plan hon.” Steve smiled. “I might show him some of the drawings I’ve made since we’ve been here. He’s a very good subject.”
“Lasă-Mă în pace! asta doare, Te rog opreștete!” (Leave me alone! It hurts, please stop!) Bucky kept repeating with a pained and fearful expression twisting onto his face.
Silence fell over the crowd as the commander began to talk again, “This man joined our ranks as the scientist, Mark Lewis. But it was recently found out that a majority of the research done here has been copied to outside servers or even disappeared completely under Mark’s login. And today we found out that this man is not Mark Lewis, he is actually Tyler Jones one of the head scientists of the AIM base in Wyoming, and he has been funneling our research for the glorious advancement of Hydra right into the hands of the enemy. This extreme level of betrayal calls for an extreme punishment to change this traitor’s loyalty and put him on the path towards redemption.”
The three were slowly starting to get closer and the plan was beginning to take shape. Bucky was beyond grateful for the repairs Tony made to his arm, he got it waterproofed to the point where he didn’t even have to take it off for showers, which provided a sense of ease that Bucky hadn’t had since he lost his arm all those years ago.
But before he could think much longer, the alarm from the security system went quiet, a tense and uncomfortable silence filling the entire base in its absence. Then a loud robotic voice came over the intercom: “A traitor has been located, everyone must report to the main hall for the traitor’s punishment delivery. Hail Hydra.”
Both Tony and Steve were taking turns with Bucky with preparing the meals, and whenever Tony was the one cooking, Steve sat at the table with Bucky showing off the different drawings and doodles he had made of the three of them, showcasing all of the moments they shared during this month, of all the moments of joy in this little life they had gotten used to.
Tony, Steve, and Bucky all stood in place, holding their breaths, waiting for the inevitable to occur.
“I hope I didn’t overstep the line Steve, the tech was just interesting to me, I didn’t mean to make Bucky uncomfortable,” Tony said with a sad tinge to his voice.
Tony and Steve tightened their hug around the shaking man and continued to whisper assurances that he was safe and that he wasn’t alone anymore. Steve grabbed Bucky’s flesh arm and placed it on his chest, instructing him to follow his breaths. After what felt like forever, Bucky’s breaths evened out, still skipping occasionally but indicating he was coming down from the attack. Helping him stand up slowly as he was still shaking, the couple led him over to their bed so he wouldn’t have to try to go back to sleep on sweaty, tangled sheets and to surround him in comfort.
“This is required to become a true soldier of Hydra, to refuse training is to be a traitor to everything we stand for. Train today and be closer to being the soldier you were born to be, refuse training, and face the punishment of being a traitor to the Hydra name.”
Steve didn’t know exactly what Bucky had said, but with the fact he said their names, it was a cry for help. He immediately kneeled on the ground next to Bucky’s bed, gently shaking his shoulder, “It’s okay dear, we’re both here and you are safe with us. We love you, come back to us.”
They found some canned vegetables and beans and were able to turn it into a small soup. It wasn’t much but it would do until they could get more food in town tomorrow.
Bucky immediately froze in place, fearful memories overtaking his thought process. These words were almost the exact same to the ones that were said to him before his arm was cut off to prove his own loyalty to another Hydra cell.
The other two soon joined Steve at the table presenting the mismatched spread they made, all of the men sitting and eating with big smiles on their faces in between bites. Bucky eventually did speak up with the question that was on his mind, “So if you don’t mind me asking, since you two are already married, what does that make us?”
He managed to sneak out of the facility because there was little to no security in the medical area and as soon as he made it to the safe house he called Shield and was extracted from the mission immediately. He was forced to take a few months off, both for getting used to working with the new arm and to deal with the traumatic loss.
“What the hell, why does Fury keep it so damn dark in here?” Tony questioned as the doors the director’s office closed behind the couple, “I can’t see anything in here!”
“This thing is see-through, that doesn’t exactly scream stealthy disguise to me,” Tony said, holding his cloth up to his face and intensely staring at it, trying to figure out what it is.
Tony gave a small whimper, but before Bucky could answer Steve walked in and gave his husband a hug from behind.
Steve was the one to speak up first, “I think for now you are our boyfriend, we don’t want to rush you, but when you would be ready I’m pretty sure that Shield can pull some strings so we can all be married.”
Bucky’s eyes widened and his body froze in place. Standing up quickly Bucky stuttered out “I’m just going to go take a shower now,” and nearly ran into the bathroom.
Multiple pairs of footsteps could be heard coming from a hallway behind the commander’s podium. Soon two guards came into view leading a younger-looking man in a lab coat onto the stage.
It took about 15 minutes before Bucky was able to slow down the tears and look up into the loving faces that were protecting him, “I guess I owe you both an explanation.”
The trio was immediately stopped at the base of the hidden staircase. A guard in uniform with a gun sling on his back stood in front of them, “Names.” he said in his gruff and intimidating voice.
They both walked towards Bucky’s bed, Steve sitting on his right side, and Tony picking up the arm and sitting on his left. They just sat there, not wanting to invade his space, but at least try to help comfort him.
The two men stood up and walked up to Bucky who seemed to be frozen in place. As he opened his mouth to speak, the tears that had been resting on the rims of his eyes spilled over and followed the tracks down.
But the trap part was they wouldn’t be locked out of the system, there wasn’t even an alarm that would sound. The “traitor” would just continue working as normal until two armed guards would come and force them to the holding cell until their punishment was decided by the commanders.
“Sir, they get sent out on their own all the time, I’m not following why this concerns us.” Steve butted it.
“Stark. Rogers. Have a seat.” Fury said emerging from one of the multiple shadowed corners of the office.
The pair followed Bucky as he unscrewed the top of the cylinder and pulled out what looked like a transparent cloth with blue light pulsing throughout it.
This was the most important part because they would have to avoid their coworkers, supervisors, and even parts of the system itself to make sure the bug would be uploaded without anything being triggered that could blow their cover in an instant.
Eventually, they did have to all get up to finish getting packed so they would be ready to go when the Quinjet arrived to take them back to New York.
Steve was already getting up from the bed when one of the things that came out of Bucky’s mouth stopped him in his tracks.
“As I was saying, since Romanoff and Barton were sent out on their own, I want both of you placed on another mission. But I brought you both in because it’s going to be a long-term mission and you won’t be working alone.”
After gaining some form of composure and standing back up he had thoughts about giving at least a small part of the truth to them like he heard Tony say, the only reason he asked in the first place was the tech interested him. He didn’t know the trauma it came with, hell, Fury doesn’t even fully know the trauma that Bucky had gained on that fateful mission.
“That means you must have picked up on it as well, I was afraid I was being a bit too subtle.” Tony chuckled.
As soon as they were out of the sight of anyone, Steve lightly squeezed Tony’s hand and whispered, “You okay hun?” A mild concern built into his serious face.
“I know. Get some breakfast in you, it’s not the same as coffee but it should wake you up at least a little.”
Steve had to balance using enough of his super strength to do good on the course, but not enough that it would raise any suspicions as to why he could finish with such ease. Luckily his strength did come in handy because as he was doing his run through the course it began to lightly rain.
And just as Steve had predicted, at about 1 am, Bucky began to twitch and mumble in his sleep, but that very quickly turned to tossing and turning and desperate whispers.
The man just gave a small sigh and a smile, he then turned off the light and climbed into his massively empty bed for the night.
“If you are all done staring at each other, I would like to get to the details of the mission.” Fury said with an annoyed tone to his voice.
“Okay,” Tony said, and then as soon as he turned around, Bucky was standing there with a bowl of the leftover stew. “Thank you” he added with an adorable, still sleepy smile on his face.
“Steve… Tony… Ajutaţi-Mă, Vă rog.” (Help me, please) At this point, there was a constant stream of tears coming from Bucky’s eyes.
“You’re the best, thank you,” Tony said turning around and burying himself into Steve’s chest as he hugged him back.
After showing the pair how to use the disguise cloths, Bucky handed them some wigs that were paired to the cloth and made it look like real hair.
Steve and Tony were back on their floor at the tower getting their bags packed up for the month-long mission.
Bucky trapped inside of his memories, eyes glazed over, and breathing becoming slightly erratic. But somehow even though his brain was in hell, his body stayed at attention, like it knew that if it gave in and broke down that the hell in his head would become reality yet again.
They got back to the safe house for the night and the damn thing still wouldn’t move, and that was the last straw for Bucky. He took off the arm and slammed it down on his bed, yelling “Acest braț stupid se rupe mereu!” (this stupid arm always breaks!) and then he hung his head pressing it into his one remaining hand.
Something sharp flashed across the woman’s face, but she hid it behind a wan expression. “Explains why he’s such a little thing, don’t it?”
The next day Tony meandered down to the garage after signing off on the documents Pepper dropped off. And he’d made good progress on an engine that just needed the right power source. Jarvis was on his phone pacing as he spoke to a lawyer, which meant progress regarding Aunt Peggy.  A good day so far.
Indeed it has, foul knight! Now from the jaws of thine defeat, I wish for you to draw out something most unique. Hope. For your craft has brought joy to many of the friends that passed through my halls. My own adoptive father has remarked upon the skill and loving attention of both the family and the menorah. The composition of thy craftsmanship has led to him standing before it and looking upon it for many a minute at a time. May your exile lead you to somewhere new where you can hone thy craft. The wilderness is an inspiration for many a wanderer and painter. I hope you come out of your woes victorious, former black knight.
Sitting up on the bench, Steve reached into his satchel and pulled out his sketchbook. He began by sketching the fountain, doing his best to capture the movement of the water and the dancing of the light. Then came the sketch of a mother and daughter: the baby’s hands tightly wrapped around the woman’s fingers as she practiced the motions of walking, each step wobbly and uncertain. Steve poured particular attention into the sense of motion as the little girl’s curls bounced with every little wobble.
I would happily let you steal off my plate; just be prepared for me to raid your plate if that’s how you’re playing. Hey, have you convinced Pendragon to do his thing? Especially since I think you described the proportions I give you as 'Tragic?' And your jaw! What sacrilege.  What have I gotten right Grant? Can you tell me that?
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen you approve of anyone I had ever dated before,” Tony let out a short soft laugh, “He likes you too. Believe it or not, he’s never had a meet the parents’ situation. Grant lost his own parents pretty young so I guess I dodged that one. So he asks about you sometimes,” Tony explained draping his arms over the couch arm and watching Jarvis settle back with the episode done.
Steve went to the zoo one afternoon, sketching the various animals and people he saw walking around. Tony took his camera with him to Paris, London, and Iceland. It had been tricky to manage photos that looked timeless enough to blend with a 1940s eye, especially given that Steve’s time was at war, but the engineer managed somehow. He had even twisted stories of his actual business meetings to better fit the events of World War II, which in turn led to him doing a great deal of reading about the time period. Tony had the feeling that, by the time Steve Rogers went into the ice, he would be an expert on the conflict and its historical impact.
Maria is applying for a new job because she's trained me to the best extent she can in her opinion.  She's going to be out there as best she can. We are working on getting me someone who will keep me in fighting shape. But she did get the means to contact Pepper whether she knows it or not. I put Pepper's number as a reference for her resume.
“That’s why you barter and hunt?” Tony said stiffly. “Things like cigs and coffee are gold and you and each of your soldiers get the cancer sticks,” Tony replied blandly.
“Don’t worry, dearest. You are my heart and soul.” The pair shared a soft kiss. And no one in the room, aside from Steve and Bucky, seemed to so much as bat an eyelash at the display. “We can admire their fine figures together.”
And … that. Does help. I like reading comics, so it makes sense that it would be easier to read writing like that. How did you know that would help?
I think your man is going to be amazing in it. I’m looking forward to the movie. So how do we want to do this, two letters one a reaction to the Hobbit and the other to the movie we’re seeing or one big letter. What works for you, Grant?
“Not mad since it’s not the real one that is at the Stark Tower building and it was your idea to put it up anyway?” Pepper mused, possibly stirring her tea; he could hear the spoon hitting the cup.
Posting this as a slightly late birthday gift for Myself. Not this Sunday but the next we should be back to our regular posting schedule. - Py
PS: How about by the next letter or the one after have chapter one read of the Hobbit? Is that enough time?”
“I accept that proposal.” They shared another quick kiss before Benjamin turned his gaze back towards them. “I’m Ben and this is my companion Peter. Why don’t you two sit down? Make yourselves at home.”
“Got it, boss,” she answered as Tony dried his hands and started towelling himself off. He then carefully grabbed the letter and opened it as he leaned back. Tony read his letter as he turned over and slowly stretched on the couch. The garage was warm enough that his shorts had dried off already, and it was doing wonders in lulling him and helping him wind down.
What if Pendragon does not come home? What if Mark has to go all his life, knowing he had love in his hands and it slipped away too soon?
And Eddie… The way they were all so comfortable and intimate. I have never seen anything like it in my life. It was a place where I could imagine myself cuddling up to my fella while we talked about politics and life and art, sneaking kisses whenever we felt like it. And nobody would care. The conversation would just continue, as normal as anything. Never thought it could be like that. And I have never wanted something so much in my entire life. It was … beautiful.
Tony’s thoughts, which had drawn his attention away from the latest missile he had been designing, were interrupted as he heard the flag lift on the mailbox. Perhaps it was a good time for a break. The brunet sat down the stylus and swiped the keyboard away.  Turning on his stool, he then watched Dum-e do his job by pulling the letter from the mailbox and carrying it over to the basket the engineer had placed at the edge of one of the worktables. Standing, he crossed over to stand beside Dum-e and patted the robot’s arm before he grabbed the envelope.
A sad smile drew across Bucky’s lips. “Yeah. Almost.” Reaching over, he slung an arm around Steve’s shoulders. “You still wanna get boozy tonight?”
I look forward to hearing from you again soon. Watching the sunrise this morning, I kept thinking about you.
. It was good. Very. very good. Cary could definitely have won awards for that. And yet, somehow the film still infuriated the brunet. But first Tony had a letter to write while everything was still fresh. There was also dinner to order with Jarvis
Coney Island was a sort of sacred space in the borough. It was one of the few places where no matter the color of your wallet or the language you spoke, you could come and escape the worries of reality. It was bright and loud and vivacious; another world compared to the stoic stone of the city. And sure, it was a bit early for the big crowds, since school was still in session, but there were still enough people present to make it feel overflowing. Everywhere he looked, Steve saw a scene he wanted to paint, and it made a wide smile turn his lips, making his cheeks ache from the force of it.
“Oh! Keep on going down towards where the freak shows and blue tents are. You’ll find the booths right over there,” the stranger explained helpfully. “If you hit the rides, you’ve gone too far.”
“It’s because I can’t just hop in any old day and grab him. I need to figure out how to set Chronos for a certain day and place,” Tony said, then wiped at his face then looked at the screen. “Because out of all of time and space I get a guy with a specific expiry date that is super important.”
The scene you paint is so pretty. I am sure we are going to have moments like that, someday. And, if nothing else, I will have some good daydreams in the meantime. Because I can picture it – the weight of you at my side and the way you would casually drape your arm across the back of my chair. The feel of your laughter against my ear, and the way your eyes would shine so bright. Of course, I can picture it so well it even snuck into one of my sketches for the bar. It will be painted in the back corner: you and me sitting watching Ella, with Franklin, Pendragon, and Mark at the table with us.
Nah, see, it does not count if you are not there to share the meal. You would specifically have to take me out for food for it to be valid. Since you only sent me money to get food, it does not count. Them is the rules.
“Boss, this paper is from the thirties. It’s from an old paper mill in the Bronx that closed in 1958 called Abbott Brothers. There is nothing that will harm you in there.” Friday recited from the speakers.
Serena finally tore her gaze away from Demi in order to stare at Tony. “February House?” She was practically vibrating with excitement. “That meant he must’ve met George Oliver! Wait, did he know Carson McCullers? Peter Pears?” She drew in a slow inhale before breathing out, “Gypsy Rose Lee?”
“They must. Especially with how you been fixing things up.” Steve glanced over at the shorter man. “But still. It’s impressive.”
The pair walked in silence through the streets of Brooklyn. It was noisy in the early morning way, with the rumble of cars and the clatter of shops opening serving as the soundtrack to their journey. Steve barely noticed it.  As the part of Brooklyn they lived in did not have much of an Irish population, getting to his ma’s church took them a while,. Each step reminded the artist of early morning walks with Sarah, who would always be in one of two dresses, her hair neatly pinned, and a hat carefully perched on her head. And her gloves, white lace that had begun to fade into ecru from age. If he thought hard enough, he could almost feel the light pressure of her hand resting in the curve of his elbow - almost hear the gentle tinkle of her laughter in response to his dry humor.
Also, thanks again to Anna for being our reader. <3 Sorry for the delay in chapters. Py and I have had a rough couple of weeks, but we are back on track for our weekly updates. And oh boy, we can't wait for you to see what's coming. :)
“Yeah, no. Now that you called me James, you’ve gotta take a bath, eat some food, and watch me clean your dishes before you get the letter. That’s the law of the land now.” And just to emphasize how utterly immovable he was on the matter, Bucky crossed his arms across his chest and affixed Steve with his best disappointed stare.
“Thanks, Friday,” Tony said, a befuddled smile working its way onto his face. “Who would put a letter from the thirties in my mailbox?” He pondered that as he sat down on the stool next to where the envelope sat on the table. Jarvis? Maybe Jarvis went to an antique shop and found a few old letters. Fun things for Tony to read; possibly World War II era stuff for his collection. Or maybe Rhodey had snuck it in there before he had left, just to play. Tony leaned forward, bracing his elbows on the table as he took a cursory glance at the envelope. The old fashioned writing and steady hand were nice to look at. Pulling the envelope free, he jammed a finger under the lip of the envelope and tore it open. He slid the contents out into his hand, finding what seemed to be just an ordinary letter. Reading it, he fought back a smile.
“I needed someone to believe me. You think something else killed them. Someone else, maybe,” Tony confirmed slowly. He watched Jarvis nod. “I uh. I need to finish something. I'll talk with you more in a bit.”
Tony watched Demi blink rapidly and momentarily sway. “That’s me yes, you’re the historian Tony’s been speaking to. It’s, it’s my pleasure to meet you. And Steve mural 3? Is this a Steve that I have theories about Tony?” Demi raised an eyebrow. Tony could tell right away Demi was more content to look at Serena and fought back a laugh. Here he was in the impossible position of loving a man he hadn't even found a method of speaking to and nearly everyone else around him was finding love. What the fuck was this shit?
“Thank you,” Tony nodded, finally managing a proper breath. “The research Steve did for the bar was fantastic. The concerts he listed making his way to see were amazing. I can’t wait to see them knowing what I do now,” Tony said with only a little tremble in his voice.
Tony paused in his writing  a few times as he looked at his couch. Yeah, affection between two men wouldn’t be out of place in the February House. None of them would look twice as he’d pull Grant close and wrap him in a blanket. There might be a laugh as Grant would probably grumble and shift them around so he was the big spoon. A little man with the fire and spirit of a man of at least six feet was how Grant had been described by friends. But Tony tried to shake himself from the daydreams of holding that gorgeous spitfire close. What was it with Tony and impossibilities?
“I’ve still got a couple hours left on my watch, but you look dead on your feet.” He knocked on the door to the office before moving in. Morita kept on snoring, but Gabe opened an eye. “Tony is going to bunk in here. We are going to be transporting him to Agent Carter.” Moving over to his pack, Steve pulled out his bedroll and passed it over to the omega. “Get some sleep.”
The knock on the door, when it finally came, nearly startled Steve to death. Clutching his chest, he willed his heart to steady. “Honestly,” he grumbled at himself before moving to the door. Pulling it open, he smiled widely at the couple. “Hey. Come on in.”
Tony started up a playlist Friday made of musicians that were playing around in Malibu during 1941. Yawning, Tony sent the letter after a rewrite. In it was also a small doodle of Sir Grant napping on his helmet. The brunet was getting better at both designing and drawing armour of all kinds, which, at least to him, was pretty cool. He’d even managed to do a decent tree the knight was curled up under.
Stopping at the edge of the table, Tony looked at the Grant folder he’d made after the Ty-proving-to-be-an-asshole thing. The lists and files of things he was going to show Grant and introduce him to the new world. His tour guide to the future. Then there was the folder of enquiries he had meant to get Friday to answer. Things he had yet to research but thought would interest his boyfriend. Things that felt a little hopeless once he knew who was on the other side of the mailbox.
Grant, you just said the wire, but, well, I somehow doubted you had all of the tools of your own for this hobby. Forgive me if I’m wrong. Happy birthday. Also if you could apologize to Franklin about how heavy this is for me, I’d be grateful. I hope you’re doing well. Also, I love your gift, and I think someone pulled some strings to make sure I got it sooner so I could make sure to tell you more of my thoughts.
And then Steve stopped short, his eyes going wide. There, written as plain as day, were the words he had hoped for but never expected. Usually his expressions of love were met with things like “ditto” or “I’m real fond of you too, honey.” But there it was. “Love you.” It was the first time Eddie had ever clearly reciprocated the feelings that had only blossomed more bright and fierce with each passing day. A sort of breathless giggle slipped past Steve’s lips even as a blush burned high on his cheeks. His fella loved him. He wanted to scream it for the entire world to hear, but settled for wiggling in place as best he could without disturbing the now sleeping Bucky.
I want to see Maria and Rhodey spar. He’s finally getting a break that will let me see him. He’s been busting his ass trying for a promotion. I think I’ll grab some pictures of them sparring if I can. And you will be better prepared to teach any perverts a lesson. Prepared is the best we can ask for.
Comments, questions and emotional outbursts are always appreciated in the comments. We hunger for them.
Thank Pendragon for doing this a lot. And you are not allowed to talk shit about your body unless it’s your asthma and or your circulation again. You are stunning.
Tony’s eyes definitely nearly fell out of their sockets reading the question in the letter. It arrived early enough he hadn’t even fallen asleep yet.
“You take care of yourself, chickadee.” She hesitated. “And don’t be a stranger. George will be sore for a while, but I’ll have words with him if I need to. You belong here as much as any of us do.”
He really didn’t want to use the word delicate, not in relation to the firecracker he knew was under there. But the way Grant’s body curved, the way his mussed hair kissed along a thick, well-formed brow, and how he could see how goddamn pretty the man’s eyelashes were. There were such delicate details about him. “Sunshine, you aren’t allowed to talk shit about your body anymore, I don’t make the rules. Unless it’s about your asthma and circulation, then complain all day,” Tony murmured to himself as he looked at all of the sketches in turns. Then came the questions.
Grant, I feel like you’d be the one to reach for me in your sleep and as long as you don’t dig any elbows into me I would like that. I can nap nearly anywhere though. I should probably sleep after I get this sent. Wonder if my dreams have a better image of you than I do when I’m awake.
I hope you get to see the murals soon. If only because that would mean I would get to see you soon. Sure you cannot just hit Obie with a 2x4 and be done with it? I would not tell anyone that you had done it. Promise. It is probably selfish of me to want him dead, but I worry so much for you, sugar. And if he were dead, the biggest threat in your life would be gone. Ma would frown at me for saying that. She always thought every life had value, even the scum. We got into a few spats about that, believe you me.
Sitting down at the kitchen table, he skimmed over the letter - pen and paper beside him on the table. He was getting a bit low on paper; soon he would have to stop past to get some more. It was perhaps a bit frivolous to buy paper, especially with how much it ate out of his monthly budget, but Edward was worth it. Or maybe, if Steve were very lucky, he could trade artwork for some paper. The lady who ran the stationery shop was very charmed by Steve - Bucky claimed it was not charmed by so much as interested in - and sometimes she would be willing to make deals. It would be worth an attempt if nothing else. He gave the pen a little twirl around his finger, already planning how to fit a visit to the shop into his uneven work schedule.
“So you’re going to write him again as a reward for surviving getting your ass kicked, aren’t you?” Maria predicted tilting her head. Tony watched Maria squint and then slowly get up from her chair. “I can arrange a couple of joint sessions with both of us training you if you go with Happy. It would give you a good transition for it. Just make sure to schedule in some firearms time, and you should be good,” Maria nodded making her way to the front door. “I’ve got some training courses to do, so I have to cut it short today. Have fun with your artist.” She waved and let Friday engage the door lock.
The blond glanced over at him, a frown on his lips. “Alcohol makes monsters out of men,” he said in an undertone. “Hated what my dad became when he drank. Never was sorry to see the back of him.”
… I understand you need to do some things to keep yourself safe. Even if I do not get exactly why, I trust you to do what is best. Just try not to forget to write me?
Stopping short, the artist stumbled back into the doorjamb. “That’s kind of you to say. I don’t think I’m much to look at if you ask me.”
I am serious that I can just get Franklin or someone to read it out to me, if you do want to go faster. The last thing I want to be is a burden to you. I wish I could read fast or there was another way to read. Listening to radio programs is something I really enjoy because I can sit and listen while I draw. Sometimes I even draw comics for the stories, because I like them so much.
“I need to do this or I won’t be able to help them out,” Tony said quietly. “It’s really hard to focus with all of that,” Tony admitted. Too many bad memories associated with the stink of distress.
The blond hesitated. “I don’t know how to be intimate with someone. And with my health being what it is, I ain’t even sure that I could give him much. I can’t even sleep through the night.”
“Yeah that happened, and it’s so complicated. But, right now, I am really happy with it,” Tony answered, sprawled out in his chair like a wet rag. Tony watched Maria try to parse him out, and, eventually, she shook her head.
“I think her picture was part of a coverup actually. It was so deliberately placed in the frame and given so much emphasis. And with Steve’s Murals and his life in Brooklyn so skimmed over. This is the first time I’m hearing about any kind of mural or artwork Steve did,” Demi added in.
April bled into May with the continuing lack of usable evidence Tony could use against Stane. There were weapons and money moving around for sure, but such things in companies did that - they moved. He was pretty sure they were going to be explained as bugs in the system. Not even he was invulnerable to programming developing bugs.
At Steve’s side, Bucky had gone completely still. Looking over at the brunet, Steve nearly vibrated with emotion. “Do you think we’ll join the war soon?” he murmured, trying to keep his voice low as the newsreel moved on to the next subject.
Grant, religion is a mess. People are always going to make bullshit out of translations. They are going to make bullshit about the testament and everything. It’s the most corrupt bunch of people in the world that are looking to make sure people higher up aren’t encouraged to look after the ones they should properly. Anyway.
Once he (and a very belated Rhodey) finished breakfast, the billionaire drifted back down to his lab. From there Tony let the time drift: designing and studying and tinkering. Until, of all things, he noticed the flag was up on his mailbox. The mailbox inside a lab that shouldn’t have anyone touching it. Approaching it, he carefully opened the top and peered down into it. Inside was an envelope. The paper was strange - thicker and with more obvious pulp in it than Tony was used to seeing. Using a pair of tongs, he pulled the object free and slid it into a sterile bag. He carried it over to one of his work tables and ran a cotton swab over the surface of the paper. Once finished, he closed the bag and dropped the swab in a tube. He slid the tube into one of his many machines and began to punch in the codes needed to run tests on the gathered fibres. “Alright Friday, can you tell me just what is going on here?”
“Nothing beyond the usual. Are you expecting something?” Jarvis asked, raising an eyebrow over his mug of tea. Tony shook his head slowly, being careful with his body.
I’m sorry if I don’t make mcuh sense. Apparently I cannot hold my liquor well. Least that’s what some people say. People who are currently snoring in my bed. He’s so loud I can barely hear myself think, Grant. Wait.. I’m Grant. Sorry, Eddie. I should probably go to sleep.
This week I am going to see the movie, as promised. You will have to let me know what you make of it. I am sure excited. Even Franklin is excited, though he was a bit dubious of letting me pick what we were seeing. I had to reassure him that it was your choice and not mine. He said he could trust you better, since the both of you have similar tastes. I was right; you would be menaces together. Specifically, you would team up against me and make me regret introducing you. I would probably laugh so much I would need another asthma treatment. It would be amazing.
Tony delicately put down the first sketch and shut his eyes as he carefully felt for the next sketch. He took a steadying breath before finally opening his eyes to look. This was Grant. This was the man that he has been writing to for months, and it was only then that the brunet was getting a soft and intimate look at him.
They made stricter litter laws since pedestrians kept getting hit by junk. And yes that is Stark industries. The building was not my idea, I think it looks weird against the skyline.
Shaking his head, the blond turned to follow the stranger’s directions. They were at least easy to follow, and he soon found himself scurrying past the blue tents with their pinup girls and provocative posters.
Steve was out for one of his walks in the city when he decided to detour through Central Park. Sure, it was quite a ways out of his normal path, but it had become a special place after one of their long-distance dates. Whenever he missed Tony particularly fierce, he would go sit in the park and sketch; trying to capture the moments he wanted to share with the other man.
Smothering a yawn, the blond shook his head. “Nah. I should be fine sleeping in my shorts and undershirt. As long as I got enough blankets, I am pretty easy to please. Poor circulation makes it a bit rough to stay warm at night.”
“Just heard about another family event I wasn’t invited to. You’d think adults would be better than petty teenagers, but here we are.” Jarvis mused as he sat up. “So how is your artist this week?”
I’m working on a draft of my letter to you waiting for a company meeting to start. So far Obie isn’t in yet but I’d love to imagine it’s because you miraculously intercepted him on the way to his plane and beat him with a 2x4 piece of lumber. I know you didn’t you rogue vigilante. But it’s great to think about.
Easy Sunshine. You suggested ‘Penny Serenade’ without looking at any summaries. That said it was very good so I am not actually that mad about it.  I think they were on their way to start to solve their problems, but it was running long or else I think they would have talked more before adopting their boy. For our next movie, I was thinking of either ‘Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde’ because I loved the book. ‘The Wolfman’ because monster movies are fun to figure out how they achieved effects. Or ‘Citizen Kane’. Though I am not expecting any of them to be joyous; Abbott and Costello are usually good too, and they have been doing well if we want a laugh.
Steve nodded and began moving through the building to the small office his pack had taken over. “Is there anything else you might need? You can borrow my bedroll if you need to.”
“For some buff Amazon, sure. You are only in there for five more minutes, Tony. Don’t get too comfy,” Maria muttered as she started pulling on a shirt and hoodie over her top. Tony set the letter aside on a nearby table in a maneuver that would have made him swear like a sailor a few minutes before.
Later, with some editing, Tony rewrote the letter with a smile. He threw in a sketch of Grant frowning as he chewed on the end of a pencil; going all out for a single sketch with his hands and shoulders.
Steve shrugged. “I sketch when I can. One of the agents does her best to keep me stocked with paper and pencils, at least.”
I’m sure there’d be adventures with Franklin too; he might sometimes galavant with off with a woman. Might get chased out of town. Might get his heart broken. But yes, the time travel adventures are something I like too. We’d go back and grab him before he got in too much trouble.
I wish both of us had better childhoods. Imagine if we were just a little bit less screwy; what a novel idea. But, it is what it is. I guess all either of us can do is to be better fathers to our own children. And by God I mean to. Because, I do want children. I may not want a wife, but I do want a family. I think I could at least do better than my father, though that is a fairly low bar. Maybe I could even be a real swell dad, someone who is able to make their kids’ lives amazing, you know? Teaching a daughter how to properly throw a punch, teaching a son how to shave, watching them as they slept – knowing that I helped keep them safe and happy every day. That is the real dream. Honestly, though, it seems even more of an impossibility than marrying a man does.
I wish you had an easier way to reach me too. But, it makes sense that you would be busy. After all, you are a genius, playboy, engineer with a reputation to upkeep and a job to do. Besides, a little silence between our letters has not killed us yet. Just gives me longer to anticipate what you will tell me about next. As long as the letters aren’t about any conquests you have. I do not think I have the stomach for that, honestly.
Tony paused in his writing to read the last sentence of the prior letter again. It might just be the fact that these are letters that they are sending, but if the guy is half as sweet in the letters as he is in person. Okay, with maybe a healthy dose of being a scrappy son of a bitch, but still, if the guy is even half as good as the letters made him seem, he was probably too good for Tony. Not to mention in the damn past.
You are going to kill me. Are you sure we are looking at the same face of mine? I’ve been called a devious looking son of a bitch a fair bit. But I am just horrifically amused by this and love it. Angel Face. Grant, that’s more likely you than me.
. Tony bit his lip unfurling the first sketch, and he felt his jaw drop. The view was like he was coming back to bed. It was his first glimpse of Grant’s little apartment, where he chose to decorate the wall near his bed with the damn comics Tony drew. God, he was beautiful. His hair was a mess - a mussed beautiful disaster. For all that he sculpted, Pendragon had a great sense of light and shadow.
Tony examined the respective gifts with a critical eye. He could see each of his loved ones reflected in the packaging. Pepper had used an understated matte blue paper, which was deceiving in its simplicity. Only the presence of the silver ribbon managed to belie that the gift was likely far more intricate a gift than it seemed. Tony’s eyes then fell on the box Rhodey had brought, which was wrapped in goofy-looking wrapping paper with rocket ships and stars. The brunet wasn’t going to say a word about it.
I think my mom would have loved you too. She was passionate about the arts and music according to what I have heard and read. And Ana, she would probably rant about the quality of education and teaching between classes and how things like reading and fostering a love for books are so important.  But also finding someone's passions and encouraging them.  She would love you.
“There’s already been a lot documented about him, Serena. You’ll see in a moment if this is the one I think it is,” Tony explained taking a deep breath. “People forget he was an artist first.”
“Got to admit, Tones,” Rhodey proclaimed, all but swanning into the kitchen, “this is way more my speed than that noise from last year.” He dropped his gift to Tony on the counter, causing the contents to make a muffled clang.
But that was not the reason for the blond’s petulance. Oh no, if it had been that simple Bucky could have found a way to cheer him up. It had been days since Steven had written his second letter, and each day Bucky had to remind him that it would take time for his recipient to get the mail. After all, the Wilde Society had to sort the mail and deliver it, then the other man had to have time to write back. But with each day, Steve became more and more confident that he had managed to chase the recipient away. (Buck was fairly certain the blond’s morose mood had more to do with being sick than thinking the letter would go unanswered.)
, another Steve pick that got him in trouble. It featured one of the up-and-coming leading men of Hollywood, Humphry Bogart, playing a gambler who got caught up in trying to dismantle a Nazi conspiracy. The mention of Dachau made Bucky particularly grim for the rest of the day; word about the concentration camps had caused a terrible ripple of fear throughout their neighbourhood. Some Jewish families had even stopped going to the synagogue, just in case antisemitism began to boil over in the country once again.
And I always need more inspiration for art. I love going to the record store and listening to things on the Victrola. But going to live performances is always a world of difference. You got any recommendations, sugar?
Tony offered a wave and glanced at them all. This was his best bet at getting home. The only thing that could produce enough power was potentially the tesseract.  And these were the ones who helped bring down Schmidt so they were his ticket. "See now that sounds kind of misleading, I am that. But you could also go into the fact you found me halfway to disassembling the bed and ready to shiv the next Hydra asshole that came through the door.” Tony chuckled a moment rubbing the back of his neck.
Besides that things are the same. Now isn't the time to quit making weapons. There's a driver I am thinking of hiring as a personal driver rather than just for the company.  He used to be a boxer and Maria thinks he might be a good fit.
Sitting in the club was … nice. Loud. Smokey. But nice. It was one of the few places he felt free to look around at men and really admire them. Nobody would punch him for staring at their shapely rear or pick a fight for being “unnatural.” Instead, he could just ogle and enjoy himself. The scenery would be better with Eddie in it, some traitorous corner of his mind added. But Eddie was not there. And, if Steve were completely honest, would never be there. Sometimes he wondered if Obadiah were real at all or if he was a cover Eddie had invented to keep Steve at bay. Sighing, he sipped at his drink.
The brunet took a steadying breath. He loved Stevie - he really did - but sometimes the kid was as thick as bricks. “Won’t know until you read it,” he said finally. “What’s worse? Not knowing or having an answer?”
Franklin says I am not allowed to hum any of the songs from the concert - claims I would ruin them. He is probably right. I used to have a real swell singing voice - I was even a choirboy when I was younger - but scarlet fever when I was fifteen made me deaf in one ear. Honestly, I am probably lucky it did not end up worse.
“He’s got a mural from the Public Works. Want to help me pick some good reference shots? I am thinking of sending pictures of you, Ana, Maria, Rhodey and Pepper.”
Pepper then snagged her gift off the table and gave it a tempting wiggle. “Mine next?” she said, smiling softly. Tony carefully sat Ana’s writing set back on the coffee table before accepting the package from Pepper.  Tugging off the ribbon, he draped it over Dum-E’s arm, making the robot beep enthusiastically at the new decoration. Then, feeling a bit more energized, Tony ripped through the blue paper to reveal the contents of the gift. He grinned widely at the multitude of boxes and toys stacked neatly inside. “Thank you. This is going to actually make phone meetings doable,” Tony grins as he pulls out the puzzle box, giving it a wiggle as he looked at all the other desk toys.
