didn’t ask anything the whole ride.
a voice somewhere in the back off his mind supplied. Steve knew the brunette was not afraid to get what he wants but when it comes to actual feelings the man was literally hopeless so he asked Tony if he tried telling the person about his predicament.
Bucky looked taken aback for a second at the blatant confession and then his smirk only got wider “Gotta tell ya he’s a bit annoying most of the time but somehow Sam thinks he’s a good one but I don’t for the record”
Remember the freight train; yeah that’s how he felt walking down the aisle until Steve held out a hand to help Tony up the stairs. For a second he just stared at Steve with an eyebrow raised but took it anyway holding in a breath and searching for the other man’s expression when their hands touched one last time before they sealed the deal. He was met with that all too familiar smile if only a bit more dopey which was the assurance Tony was looking for.
Thank you guys for the support as always.
He kept up the façade right until his best friend reached out to touch him. He felt so bad for Bucky but Steve just couldn’t bear touching anyone other than Tony then. The last thing he remembered before drifting off was Tony placing him on his bed.
“You know I’ve never seen Ironman up close” He suddenly broke the silence.
He was in no state to put the suit on manually and despite whatever he ordered JARVIS refused to follow which only made him even more frustrated. In a fit of rage he threw the bottle which shattered across the wall.
To Steve’s abundant displeasure, the Grand Prix was a much publicized event and so his wardrobe was provided courtesy of SI stylists. For once he was happy to trail behind Tony and Pepper among snotty billionaires who had too much money to throw around.
“What happened to my music JARVIS?”  Tony reeled his head back from inside a part of the Ironman suit that he was going to present in at the expo.
Jesus, were these people angry at him for what happened to Steve. Even though a part of him did blame himself it would be devastating to hear it from the two people Steve loved the most.
again!-his heart within him dies-
Tony decided that driving around, drinking and being miserable in general was not going to do anything for him so he took the suit and flew to his house in Malibu. Even though the place never felt like home (none of the places he owned ever did) this was where his bots were so he liked it more and walking into the lab did put a smile on his face.
“I don’t think Steve would appreciate ridiculously expensive free things, Sir”
"Tony" she was glaring now. He let out a long sigh and steeled himself.
The red head stood up and walked in with all the confidence Steve could only hope to possess on a good day. He was absolutely convinced that the job would go to her. Even if Miss Potts didn’t find her fitting Mr. Stark certainly would if what everyone says about him is even half true.
He was having breakfast in bed at nine in the morning watching Tony Stark lampoon around a bunch of senators.
There was no denying now, he was attracted to the blond and that there was dangerous territory. Not now he thought, he had a dinner to prepare for and maybe a few hours of rest would help as well.
“Not at all……please go ahead”
She strode confidently in with her beautiful wings almost on display, true to the statement everyone in the room was staring appreciatively at her, even pepper.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah, whatever. Why don’t you prep the suit so I can go out and get that bread” he said with a self -deprecating chuckle.
“How was the flight Steve?”
Men that remote in sorrows live,
“umm…..yeah sure” Steve replied unsure.
The man stood up and walked over “I have my ways” He stood directly in front of Steve with a stern look and continued “I’m a busy man Mr. Rogers so let me get straight to the point. Are you willing?”
She followed him all the way to the apartment and both of them were greeted by a mildly worried Bucky and Sam. Even though he was barely functioning he noticed Sam freeze up the moment he laid eyes on the person behind him.
“Okay”
Steve promised himself that he would not cry. Some promises are meant to be broken anyway.
“Your prosthetics. Buck has them on one side, he’s always complaining”
The bliss came to an abrupt halt when Tony gasped and snapped back. The face plate slammed shut and the external speakers were off which made Steve realize that something was extremely wrong.
“What are you doing here?” Sam asked in a dangerous tone that Steve had never heard before and was about to answer but realized it wasn’t aimed at him.
"Let her in J"
Tony was already half drunk by the time he stumbled out of the car into another dingy bar downtown because he got kicked out of the last one.
He was anxiously waiting for Nat to come back so he could ask her and get a sense of what happened or go down and talk to tony, himself. When she finally came back after an eternity or a few minutes; whatever, he jumped up and cornered her.
“I told you we were going to celebrate didn’t I and Sam picked me up from work” Bucky motioned with a hand that was holding a bottle of something that looked expensive.
Tony’s face bloomed into a brilliant smile at the sight of Steve stepping in and Steve couldn’t help but fall a little bit more in love.
“Don’t flatter yourself Rogers, it’s just nerve damage happens when I’m tired” He defiantly crossed his arms over his chest and added “You’re not half as attractive as the people I’ve had in this house alone”
Steve’s hands were the stuff of nightmares for him. They were too soft, too unnatural, not even a single scar or flaw. Not that he never got injured, they were aplenty during battles, the serum would heal them even before his brain could register the pain. When the weather got chilly his hands would be cold and smooth like porcelain and they felt alien to him. That was why he loved the comfort of Tony’s hands. They were calloused and rough a sign of being used too much but the man they belonged to had lived and survived. They were always warm and grounded Steve in a way nothing else ever could, so he started to seek Tony out every time he had a nightmare about the ice.
Tony just stared incredulously. The bots were the only things as close to babies he was gonna get, so someone treating them like something more than mild inconveniences was really really nice to see.
“Tony Stark?” the blond asked.
“Nick Fury, director of SHIELD” the man said standing up in attention directly in front of Steve.
All of them stilled the moment they saw Steve. He really wanted to roll his eyes but decided against it and walked into the little kitchen instead.
his pulse is stopped, his breath is lost,
That o'er thy brow are shed;
“Steve, go back and get some rest. We can take it from here” Nat said with an uncharacteristically gentle tone.
She gave him some of the things that needed to be signed by Tony because she knew that the assistant was somehow able to coax his employer into complying.
The spy didn’t dignify his question with an answer and instead tilted her head and narrowed her eyes in a look that said ‘really?’
“You guys ready?” Tony asked as to both of them. Steve stopped talking and stared at him for a brief moment and then nodded his head slightly. Tony couldn’t help but smirk, pleased that he had
“How many ounces of this gobbledegook am I supposed to drink?” he asked gulping down the green goop, trying not to grimace.
“Never been better” came the reply accompanied by a grin just as Steve expected.
Steve muttered a quick sorry and tried to slide past Greg. The other man just caught his hands yanked hard, grabbed a hold of Steve’s collar and yelled right in his face.
Someone led him to the room where the other candidates were waiting. He sat down at the far end smiling at them. Some of them politely smiled back. As his eyes roamed across the room he realized that most of the people had something wrong with their wings, most were veterans, he could guess from their posture.
He went into the bed room to get one last look in the mirror. The shirt and trousers did belong to Steve but the jacket was Bucky’s. Everything about him screamed desperate fresher but Steve Rogers never backed down without a fight so he steadied himself by taking a deep breath and walked out the door.
They started on their journey once again this time the roof was up as the cold never agreed well with Steve’s asthma.  Tony switched on the stereo and a song he didn’t recognize started playing. Steve leaned on the window hugging his small frame and closed his eyes. He wasn’t planning on sleeping; he had a lot to think about anyway.
Steve could swear she was finding this all very amusing from that little glint in her eyes. He huffed half amused himself half annoyed and just let it go for now.
“Fine” He held up both his hands in defeat “I’ll see you tomorrow Rogers”
she would think and simply smile at the other man when he says Stark’s name in that peculiar fond tone he always uses only reserved for the genius. It was all very amusing really.
Your eyes are like the oceans and I'm drowning.
I will be taking a break from MCU after finishing this story and will be focusing on MDZS/the untamed. If anyone has not seen it yet i urge you to please go watch, it's really good.
He hesitated in front of the workshop doors up until he heard what sounded like someone dying from a coughing fit. That’s strange the work shop was supposed to be soundproof, unless.
Alright whenever he sees Steve with Natalie okay!
The artwork for Take my Heart and TAke my Hand
Steve might sound like a love struck fool sometimes but he was an honest judge of character and Natasha had decided to believe him, which brings her to her current predicament. Tony Stark has serious issues and doesn’t know jack shit on what to do about them.
“Nat what are you still doing here?” he tried to force a smile.
“Have a good day Mr. Rogers” she said with a wink and got in the car.
My dumb ass finally figured out how to post pictures on AO3....
Steve sat down on a couch and let out a large shuddering breath through his mouth. He knew he wouldn’t get much information from JARVIS or its creator.
yet it is only love
Swaying on his feet Tony walked into the workshop to put the suit on himself. It was too late anyway why not go out with a bang.
“Fancy meeting you here Rogers”
“None of your business Rogers” Tony sounded angry now and he just stomped off without even looking back.
One thing great about the future was that you were free to love whoever you wanted and it would be lying if he said that he wasn’t a little relieved at that news. He never thought he could even be attracted to someone from the future let alone fall in love. So he ignored that slight discomfort in his throat whenever he spoke dismissing it as everything else but the obvious. He knew he couldn’t get sick since the Serum but this particular disease with a penchant for flowers had managed to sneak its way into his lungs. It wasn’t that bad, hell it wasn’t bad at all; he rarely had a coughing fit, only when the object of his affections was close by and doing something insanely adorable. He always managed to slip away without anyone else noticing so he thought all things considered he was doing okay other than a constant soreness to his throat. But what’s not so okay about the whole ordeal was the person he managed to fall in love with.
He knew he couldn't hide it for long. There were two super spies currently living with him for gods sake. Nat is already onto him, it won't be long till she figures it out and confronts him.
over and over in his head. In between long gasps for breath and a blurred vision tony could see Steve smiling. Okay that's a better final image.
The three assistant’s pepper had send his way before one after the other were all crippled in a way, their wings damaged in some accident one way or the other. Tony chew them up at spat them out in a matter of days.
The first thought that came to his mind was that
“Yup” she still wasn’t looking at him.
“What?”
“Hey Buck”
Sorry for the mistakes if any and i love hearing from you guys.
"Does that have anything to do with me?" What's with these people and confrontations these days.
“He doesn’t like to be handed things” which was something Steve deduced through his superior observational skills and an awkward conversation with JARVIS.
Enjoy.
Even Happy could sense the tension between them when he came around to fetch Tony for boxing. There was also no mistaking Pepper noticing it as well, it was evident from her little frown whenever she looked at either of them. She had already asked what was wrong quite a few times as well. As the reason was too embarrassing to reveal Steve just blurted out some ridiculous excuse and strategically made an exit (by that he means ran away).
Steve smiled and then bit his lip as if in contemplation “Why now?” “Why hand over the company now?” he added to avoid confusion.
“oh okay, so no one else?” Tony asked while handing over the food.
“Tony?” He absolutely forgot that there was someone else beside him.
“Yeah it was, was in an orphanage for two years and then Buck got drafted and then discharged early……yeah things were a little tough” Steve had a haunted look in his eyes that somehow made him look older than he was.
What she didn’t even expect was to lose the opportunity to an under qualified civilian. Hawkass laughed for two days when they found who she lost the position to, well for two days until she decked him in the jaw (semantics). The point is; being the highly experienced professional she was Natasha knew something was going on with Stark from that moment itself.
so now there is zero chance no his chances were in the negatives. Steve is never afraid to speak his mind or that's what Tony believes.
The first order of setting his life straight was to give Stark Industries over to someone more capable and  no one was more capable than the woman strutting into the lab with wings flaring and anger written all over her face. He must’ve done something while being drunk yesterday.
He threw all the petals into a trash can
Steve was reluctant to speak up as he knew Tony was still upset. The brunette must have noticed and spoke up instead.
The two men looked up, one with tear stained eyes and the other with empathy.
Steve sighed and continued in a softer tone “What I meant was, Greg really has it out for me. You deal with people like him every day and I don’t want to add to that and besides there is enough videos of Tony Stark on the internet”
He knew he was going to be stuck in a car with his assistant for five hours. This was not his first rodeo of doing obnoxious things on a whim. He used to whisk away people ten times attractive than Steve to places he fancied. Why was he nervous now? Tony was sweating in a car with the top down going one eighty miles an hour. How was that even possible?
“Doubt they would want to arrest me” the man replied with a ghost of a smirk which sounded more like a challenge.
The next thing that happened was something that Steve wouldn’t even dream of, never in a million years. Camellias, Tony was coughing out petals upon petals of beautiful camellias. He froze in horror when he saw the blood spotting the edges of the petals, realization hit a second later, Tony was in love but whoever that lucky little shit was, didn’t love him back. Steve’s momentary distraction allowed tony to pick up all the petals and turn, but before he could, Steve caught him. He had to know.
Maybe he should apologize tomorrow and try to rein his heart in when it comes to Steve. He was already putting everything in order, he should put something for Steve in the will as well, and there weren’t much people in his life anyway.
“I’m sorry but Steve is waiting outside to meet you sir”
“Oh okay” Steve just nodded, not sure what to think about it. She left after that leaving a confused Steve to wander around the, what he could only describe as a mansion. It was decorated just like the penthouse and gave him the similar feeling of something missing.
“No, since my mom it was just Bucky and me”
“wha-…..…Excuse me?” the ability of speech seems to have eluded him and he just stared up at her dumb struck.
“Okay that’s fine I’m here whenever you want me. You know that right Stevie” the other man uttered in a fond tone.
There was what looked like a basket full of fresh fruits wrapped in plastic and topped with a pretty red and gold bow. A garment bag with a suit was draped next to it. It screamed expensive and he assumed it would cost more than what he made in two months. There were various other shopping bags with shoes and more shirts and what not.
Hope you enjoy this chapter.
It was still early morning; the sun was just above the horizon bathing everything in an ethereal yellow-orange light. Tony slowly inched closer towards the kitchen with the coffee cup in hand.
Steve was curious from the beginning about how Tony managed to walk around with his fake wings all day. Bucky was always whining about dragging around the weight and sometimes the pain would be unbearable. Tony had it on both his wings but it must be a hundred times better than what Buck had so he asked Tony about them.
This is very short and please don't hate me after reading this.
Steve’s mind just short circuited for a minute until everything clicked into place. The agent the eye patch guy mentioned, it must be her. He took another minute to think back on the last two weeks.
No one except Steve noticed the sudden flash of panic that crossed the brunette’s face.
Pepper interrupted them before either Steve or Tony could reply and Steve excused himself before he did something rash.
“I think I’m in love with him Buck” he was able to make do without stuttering.
Wrong.
Tony’s reply was actually a surprise, it was a man. Steve knew, from the S.H.I.E.L.D files and the countless news reports that Tony dated both men and women but what surprised him was that this person who was probably going to be permanent if Tony gets his head out of his ass, was a man and not some beautiful woman as he pictured in his mind.
“Not everything is about you cap” it sounded bitter to Steve’s ears, deliberately hostile. He couldn’t help but be a little hurt at that.
The first time Steve held Tony’s hands, it was to pick him up from the gym floor where he had unceremoniously fallen butt first. He hesitated to take Steve’s hand first but was curious to see how the blond would react. Unsure of how he would feel if Steve actually winced, he grabbed the one held out to him. To his surprise all he saw was an unwavering smile and Tony was a goner.
Tony laughs, and that sets Peter on a giggling spree. “Oh wow, someone is wide awake.”
Micro-expressions play across Steve’s face. Confusion flickers in his eyes that bounce around Tony’s face, lines form and dip at the corner of his mouth, wrinkle his nose. “You thought that this was a date? How?”
“He’s probably already had the sex talk, yeah? I don’t have to put the two of us through that? That’s been covered?” Tony asks, dramatically put-upon, once Peter has shuffled out.
“Talk about your prehistoric.” Tony nabs dim sum off Steve’s plate and pops it in his mouth. “Not that we have to get married but it is easily doable. C’mon, you’re looking at a well-connected man. What do you want, Sparklers? Dealer’s choice. We could jet off to a private villa, jump in line at the courthouse downtown, or get vodka-soaked in Vegas.”
Steve wrinkles his nose at that exact articulation but insists, “You and anything does it for me, if I’m honest.”
“The balls on you.” Tony makes an unimpressed noise and takes another sip from his cup of water. “I have half a mind to throw this right in your face.”
Tony shrugs, toeing out of his shoes and socks. He tilts his head to the right and left as he answers, conveying
—is a collection of brandy-colored eyes that glint like firelight, clever hands with tidy nails and blue collar calluses, and a mouth with edges distractingly familiar but shoots off in a way that’s unlike anything else Steve’s ever heard before. At twenty-four, Steve is a coat-hanger frame riddled with ailments and draped in hand-me-downs, a pair of knobby knees that get pins on the hike up to his fifth-floor walk-up, and a type of mouthy that only attracts a bully’s fist. Steve could have stood a haircut two weeks ago. So he can’t fathom what Tony sees, has no idea why he would bother looking at Steve twice, but he had. In the sparse O’Grady’s—its usual crowd long thinned out by the war—Tony had found Steve tucked away in his preferred dimly lit corner, staring out at a silent street that had more tin cans traveling it than pedestrians and keeping a warm, unspilled beer in a slow rotation between his fingers.
“You’re such a cheeky asshole,” Tony murmurs, half-chiding.
“He fits right in.”
Tony knows--he
“Well, that’s an idea or. I mean, if you’re free anyway—”
His side hitched on the passenger side door, Tony explains the seats that are the color of a coffee with two creams, and Steve would bet are as soft as butter. “Here we have a subtle homage to that delicious jacket you don’t wear nearly enough.”
“To be completely transparent, I was under the influence of an orgasm at the time.”
“Nurse at the front desk told me you were already waiting. I know it’s shit but thought you could use something, you know?”
penthouse, though.” Tony’s response is thinned out by uncertainty.
“That is such a turn-off,” Tony says, a shitty lie-slash-groan that shades over into something far less dignified. “Not to mention, it makes it harder to avoid them when you know that. How
“Only if it matches what you want. That's what matters most of all, Peter. What's best for you. He won’t do this if it makes you uncomfortable. He’ll do whatever you want. What do you want?”
“Not you.”
“I mean it.”
Warm like a furnace, Tony laughs and wraps his arms around Steve’s middle, hands under his armpits; he tucks a number of kisses between Steve’s neck and ear. “I need lube. Do you keep oil around or something like that?”
Tony opens his legs to accommodate him, happily welcomes the settling of sleep-warm skin against skin. He braces on his elbows, dampens his lips and reaches out to touch Steve’s chin for no reason beyond the fact that he’s very attached to it, to all of him. He bends to snatch a quick kiss. “You have something in mind?”
“Doesn’t matter. I was thinking that a shower would be nice but if you’ve got your heart set on getting to the bottom of this…”
It’s Friday night and Tony is two jack and cokes deep. It’s a good night. He can’t decide if it becomes better or worse when he spots Rogers at a till, stuffing a few bills into the sad tip jar while handling a carryout bag, but Tony makes up his mind to follow him out all the same. Over the din of the bar and a top 40 hit, he promises his table that he’ll be right back. Maybe.
“What makes you think that you get to decide that?”
“Touch me,” Steve answers.
“I’m right here,” Tony breathes into his mouth, licking and biting, so present and alive. A pulse inside of Steve and tight all around him. “I’m not leaving. Just let it go. Come for me, Steve. C’mon, baby.”
Steve hadn’t known her well but he hopes that May would’ve liked it.
“Dunno. Feels like forever,” Steve says, sounds like he’s either elsewhere or too lust-laden for articulation before taking Tony’s cock between his lips and over his tongue. He goes and goes, gets Tony gasping and his hips stuttering.
Tony watches in horror, feels like there’s oil, sick and heavy, in his stomach when a second bullet catches Rogers in the shoulder and knocks him sideways with its impact. He barely catches himself on the base of the catwalk he’s climbing, feet tripping on its ridges.
He still insists on knocking whenever he enters Tony’s workshop. Even though Tony has told him it’s unnecessary more times than he can count. If Tony wants him out, he won’t get in.
And that right there is more than Steve can handle, catches him off-guard and has him keening, high and lost. His orgasm tears out of him and hot white stripes spill all over Tony’s fingers.
Tony rubs his eyes because he doesn’t want to talk about this but it looks like it can’t be avoided. “I was getting out of the way, Steve. You’ve just always struck me as a one person at a time type.”
With the hand that isn’t splaying heat near Steve’s sternum, Tony pulls him off. His fist isn’t loose enough for Steve to shove into; he can’t do anything but take it, the punishing strokes that work him syncing up to the ones coming from behind.
Tony thanks him and slugs down about half of it, deciding he’s definitely had worse. The coffee is hot and makes him feel human. That’s more than enough at this point.
The light winks out and takes Tony with it.
A fury of alerts and banners flash across the screen, automatically shrinking the video to the side as new information comes in. Tony reads through headlines from various news outlets that there’s been a lockdown and subsequent leak at SHIELD. His eyes keep catching on an acronym that’s been dead for decades littered throughout. He swipes to another alert and sees that the backdoor he left on the helicarriers when installing the repulsors has been triggered. Tony is just about to ask JARVIS to give him a rundown, because that’s a high-level threat detection, but he’s cut off by a shot that rings out and is so present and loud from the workshop’s audio system that Tony actually flinches. It takes him an unnerving moment to realize that the shot was made hundreds of miles away. That Rogers has been shot.
“It sounds embarrassingly naive but I was hoping that we’d find him in time,” Tony confesses because while he’s glad that Steve enjoys his present, it feels so damn small and inadequate, and he doesn’t know how to care for someone without that in tow. That he just can’t get it right. He wants Steve to know he’s trying. “I wanted to find Barnes for you. Be able to hand you a progress report with actual progress at any rate. Place it in a Hallmark card or something.”
Tony hisses, chooses to go default and makes light of it. “See the thing is that I’m fond of keeping my head attached to the rest of my body and I’m terrified Natasha will rip it right off. She told me that I need to let you out on Saturdays, and I haven’t really made good on my promise.”
Tony cracks up, eyes crinkling. “An hour of marriage and you’re already bleeding me dry. Okay fine. I’ll buy you a new house.”
“It’s
“And while he’s out running around the city, literally, with his best friend, I decided that I’d take the time to call mine since I’m nothing if not an opportunist. So I need you to give me one of your epic lectures. Please.”
A deep groan erupts from Tony and the bed creaks when he gets back on and hurries behind Steve once more, molding to him with ease. He leans over Steve’s shoulder to kiss him hard and deep, and Steve can’t taste anything but the want that coats his mouth. Tony starts, “That image,” he reaches around and briefly tightens his hand on Steve’s cock that’s welling messily at the slit, has been smearing the bedsheets, “this is so, so much better, baby.”
A quiet settles between them and even if were tensionless and easy, it’s still a luxury that Steve can’t afford. The team gave him time to watch over Tony but he can’t steal much more than he already has. He’s memorized the edges of Tony--the new lines and shift of paper-skin and the rise and fall of his chest washed under the warm light--fully intent on keeping the picture until it branded the back of his eyelids. That way he could take it with him into the dark.
When he’s done, Tony doesn’t give out platitudes or offer up ways on how to fix Steve. Free of judgment or pity, he takes Steve’s hand and presses a steady kiss to the map of lines in its center.
It’s clear as day how much Tony loves Peter.
Steve rockets out of his armchair. “Sheesh, Tony, you shouldn’t. Give it here. Sit down.”
“Wilson, how is that possible?”
He wakes up exhausted and heartsick. Still feeling his Ma’s strong phantom grip on his fingers—so afraid to let him go—Steve laces them through Tony’s sleep-slackened hand.
Steve is happy that he was at least able to give Tony something in wartime. It’s the least he could have done.
“Sorry,” stumbles out of the curve of the stranger’s sheepish smile that just about flips Tony’s heart inside-out.
Like he’s giving it some thought, Peter’s brown eyes are inquisitive, and when he’s done deliberating, he says simply, “Nope, sleep.”
Tony comes back carrying the capped ice bucket in hand before setting it on the nightstand and it clicks together for Steve, the sharp clarity of realization cutting through the fog of his mind with a crystalline-type edge.
sleep,” Steve tells him with a sigh. “And I know it’s my turn, but I’ve gotta fly out to DC first thing tomorrow morning and I still have those reports on last week’s mission to put together and Peter keeps talking to me about bananas—”
“Okay, okay. Gotcha.” Tony heeds the warnings but prioritizes caution over speed and is careful as he hefts Rogers’ unconscious, water-sodden weight, and settles him against his chest. “It’s gonna be alright. I’ve got you, Steve. Just hang on for me, huh? I’ve hardly filled my quota for annoying the fuck out of you. Trust me. Still a lot to do.”
“It's really what he wants? Adopting me?”
Steve trembles in a fit, scrabbling his fingers over Tony’s shoulders, and his nails must bite because Tony grinds particularly hard with a sharp hiss and the angle shifts deeper. It feels achingly right. It always does, and Steve realizes that he wants this forever. He wants it more than he ever missed the past, he wants it more than having victory over evil, he wants it more desperately than he wished for the dead to come back to life.
It’s so stupid.”
“What’s on your artificial hippocampus, buddy?”
“I did,” Tony says, extracting Steve’s fears out of his head and giving them validation. After a beat that curves a divot between his brows, he continues in an apologetic and stricken tone, “Steve, I had to see to some stuff. I couldn’t just—
“Yeah, kinda. I—it’s okay. It’s really okay. I just thought. Nevermind. Forget it.”
“Bossy.” Tony waves a hand dismissively. “Party on. I can’t stop you. Do what you will, Cap.”
Steve’s inexperienced but he’s a quick study, a flashfire of enthusiasm that bucks under Tony’s fingers and whimpers under his tongue. Steve’s demands dissolve into hitching gasps when Tony gets three fingers into his ass and Tony can’t get enough of the way he twists like a corkscrew, spilling the sticky mess that fills the heaving hollow of his abdomen.
“And I’ve got the resources so,” Tony says, gestures vaguely, “whatever I can do to make it easier, I’ll do. Just ask.”
Heedless of the guilt and against his better judgement, Steve stays. In no time, the erection caught in his sweatpants goes from half-hard to full-on and leaking, stroked and handled viciously by the sound of Tony’s filthy moans, the unapologetic bliss that lights his face, and the length of his throat as his head falls back on an invisible, graceful curve. They’re details that unpeel like precious secrets, and Steve ravenously drinks in each one as if they can be swallowed. He presses his hand to his tented crotch, and when he’s thinking about freeing the needy, hard flesh, and taking himself in hand, Tony suddenly tells the armor to stop in a stream of pants, his breath hoarse and labored.
, hits send, and turns his attention back to DUM-E’s code, swallowing around whatever just leaped up to his throat.
“I’m all nerves, Tony,” Steve admits, feeling foolish.
“I—I can’t,” Steve thinks he says—whimpers—after a herculean effort of
Alarmingly, the only color in Tony’s face is the rough-red of his already chafing nose. Under hair that’s succumbing to sweat and has limped to its natural curl, his eyes are bleary and struggling to stay at more than half-mast.
“Oh that’s neat,” Steve responds.
Tony doesn’t mind being outfoxed in a sparring session when it ends with him on his back, Steve solid, broad, and rutting on top of him. It’s nice to pivot his hips under the welcomed weight, to feel them fit together perfectly before they trade handjobs, their fists furious and elastic waistbands cut across their thighs. It’s a literal thrill ride to be lifted from his office desk and fucked practically boneless against the wall, Steve’s strength infallible and unfaltering.
Steve tried to start over in the twenty-first century with SHIELD, placed all of his faith and purpose in what was familiar to him in a strange world. Tony might be at his most arrogant in thinking this—or his most vulnerably hopeful—but he thinks that maybe, just maybe, he gave Steve a real second home.
“Yeah, you’ve said,” Tony cuts him off again, clipped. It’s whiplash to have not long ago been so moved by that loving tenor and now, now it’s infuriating to hear—a firebrand coil tight around his spine. “So if there’s nothing new, I’m gonna go upstairs, and I’d really appreciate it if you made yourself absent. It would be extremely considerate of you, Steve. I mean, you are invested in my best interests, right?”
why can’t Rogers just stay in one place? He sighs expel a bit of his frustration, unwrap it from his next words. “Alright, J. What’s the location you have on Rogers?”
Tony whistles low. “Talk about an incentive.” He shoos at Steve. “Alright, go store up your energy or whatever. I’ve got the baby.”
“Think I’ve heard that one.” Steve traces the sheen that lines the cut of Tony’s brow before carding through the damp curls of Tony’s hair, absently spiraling their ends on his fingers.
The projection expands to the appropriate dimensions.
A party celebrating the vanquishment of Hydra clears out, and only the Avengers remain.
They’re squabbling over whether or not go for a best out of seven when Steve jingles through the door, keys and what looks like half of the market in his arms. He stops in blatant surprise, mouth open, and now that Tony’s kissed him, it’s pretty much all he wants to do. “Oh. Hey. Um.”
“I’ve seen worse. Much worse,” Tony says generously, like he means it, and knows better than to mind Steve’s self-deprecation. He says it like there’s nothing that Steve could do to frighten him away. It’s a wonderful thought. “You’re doing fine. But we can slow it down if you’d like.”
“Yeah, I think so. I mean, I still don’t think you need a piece of paper to keep tied and true,” Tony says. “We’ve been doing pretty alright for ourselves. But a little more never hurts, right?”
"Ten gray hairs, Steve. I feel them." Tony knocks his head into Steve’s warm chest and listens to the rapid heartbeat there. It's reassuring. He breathes in the comforting scent of Steve’s aftershave, akin to cloves. Tony resurfaces. "I motion we don’t invite the kid,” he says.
Here, Tony is hesitant. Not until he’s brushed his thumb along the hinge of Steve’s jaw and leaned in with a kiss, does he say, “Well, it’s significantly better than it was but I’m primarily used in the scientific division anyway so, you know, I just create toys that go boom.” His hands explode open and, again, there’s that familiarity that’s evading Steve. He demures, “Try to ensure that our guys are protected. It’s not that much.”
“Can’t help wanting to protect the people you care about, Cap,” Tony responds wryly, shrugging. “Not that hard to understand. Especially when you get lucky enough to even have people in your life to give a shit about. What makes things—people,
“You kept visiting and you were so kind and helpful and I didn’t know how to break that because it felt so good.” The pull of his lips trembles, like rocked water, makes a set with blue eyes that are beginning to swim. “It was the best thing I’d felt, every moment with you has been like that. Things either hurt less or they don’t hurt at all, and I didn’t want to hurt you. I still don’t. But I can’t do this with you, care about you this way and keep this secret. They can’t both fit in my heart.”
“And now they’ve all pretty much decided they want to push our study session a day back,” Tony says, editing on his laptop with one tab dedicated to google docs and another open with a draft of stern email that borders on passive aggressive, telling the Circuit Analysis class to be sure to bring in the study guide he’ll be attaching
“You’re drunk,” Steve says after a deep inhale and steadier exhale.
“Okay,” Steve says again, touching Tony’s elbow. “I said okay. It’s a good idea, and I miss New York. I want to go back home, Tony.”
And Steve doesn’t pretend to be alright, shakes his head ‘no.’ “Crap day,” is what he manages in a humorless huff.
—Tony slicks up his fingers and pushes knuckle-deep into Steve. He’s worked open with his legs hooked high over Tony’s shoulders.
The expression that animates Tony’s face immediately tells Steve he won’t like what's coming next. “I kind of have a history with this hotel, and maintenance doesn’t really trust me around their toys,” Tony says.
“Cute,” Steve mutters, amused and resigned, snapping on his watch.
After a stretch of silence, Rhodey’s voice is non-judgemental and calming, and Tony takes it back; he needed to make this call.
“Fantastic. You’re fantastic. You’ll handle it in the morning, though, right? Sleep now? Unless you do have something else to tell me.”
And Tony wouldn’t have said anything had he known it’d make Steve ask stupid questions. “Good?” He teases, follows the fashion of his fingers that course Tony’s neck to arrive at his mouth, beg at the seam, and groans when Tony sucks in three of them. “You don’t play fair.”
Steve makes a face but, proving Tony right, he slips seamlessly into the role of aficionado. He explains how the Cubist lines emphasize the two-dimensional, flatten the portrayal of moon divination—
“Could be worse,” Tony says agreeably. He leans down and kisses Steve with purpose, tremoring where he’s touching Steve. He presses their foreheads together. “We’ve faced the end of the world twice. I did it once without you and once with. One was empirically better than the other. I don’t want to do anything without you by my side again.”
“We’re not even married,” Steve points out when they’re having lunch downtown days later and he's somewhat absorbed Tony's revelation.
, but he doesn’t think he’s owed answers so instead he says:
“Oh yeah?” Tony asks quietly, his gaze flitting over Steve in wonder.
“I’m okay with not,” Tony manages, seconds late and rough around the fierce love and need to protect brimming under his skin. He nods. “You?”
“I’m not one hundred percent in love with your tone right now. Since when is practical our priority? Babe, I thought we agreed that sexiness would be the dominating factor in all of our choices. Okay nevermind, you’re approaching the ‘I’m humoring you’ face. Let’s get to the best parts, shall we? C’mon, climb in.”
“Yep. We’re the cat’s pajamas, Cap.”
“A history,” Steve repeats flatly. “Meaning?”
“No. No.” Steve shakes his head, and all Tony can see are the bruises that haven’t faded. “If Bucky wanted to kill me, I’d be dead.”
Satellite footage pops up before Tony’s eyes and shows the ships hovering almost three-thousand feet in the sky just outside of the Triskelion, cannons engaged.
Tony is mostly definitely flirting but Rogers is better than that because not only is he undoubtedly a knockout, intelligent, and in possession of a sense of humor that metaphorically charms the pants off Tony; he’s honest-to-god good. The sort of good that always struck Tony as a myth, presiding by morals and code—a compass that doesn’t waver past true north. Of course Rogers is excellent at what he does—the captivating leader who sparks inspiration and work ethic in their students, even the ones like Tony who are only taking the class as an elective—but more than that, it’s palpable how teaching is a religion to him. For all intents and purposes, his path in life. It’s a faith that he wouldn’t undermine easily, not for something as frivolous as a crush, not for someone like Tony. He’s just too good but damn if that goodness doesn’t make Tony want him all the more.
And then it’s just Steve and Tony left to set up in the kitchen.
Tony still hasn’t made up his mind when he strides over to Steve’s position at the bar where he’s nursing a club soda of all things. His tie is crooked and affection steals a few heartbeats from Tony.
“We’ll keep at it,” Tony says. He scrubs the heels of his hands into his eyes because they’ve been at this for a stretch of days that feels like forever, and whatever’s going down in Washington isn’t kosher, and dear
“Morning, Cap,” Tony greets, and Steve’s head pops up out of his paperback at the severe vocal fry.
“Yeah, Peter?”
“So cranky. I had no idea,” Tony murmurs, far from jilted; it’s curiosity in his hum, like he’s contemplating an equation that’s stolen all of his attention.
He doesn’t finish; he can’t. He doesn’t want to arrive at the other side or think about the way Steve talks about Barnes sometimes, the longing Tony catches in his eyes on occasion, what getting Barnes back might mean to Steve.
“Um, Steve.”
And yeah, Tony isn’t going to last much longer. He kind of feels like it’s good luck he’s made it this far. He practically vaults off the bed, in search of supplies. At his nightstand, he considers its contents.
“Yeah but I won’t. Going without for three weeks might’ve lended some perspective.”
In Wakanda, they rebuild each day. Each night, Steve curls a calloused and rough grip around his cock, stripping at it with punishing jerks, and for weeks straight, Steve strings together pathetic noises that are all for naught.
Weeks later, the smell of smoke won’t leave Tony and neither will the sight of Steve, his lips stained with blood and the extent of internal damage so critical he’d been kept in the hospital for several days.
His phone chimes again.
The moment exists in the details and it feels normal.
Smirking when he draws back, Tony quips with a wink, “I always did appreciate a fast learner. That’s just the tip of the iceberg. I’m so punny, right?”
Tony pokes hard at his tablet. “I’m working on a project.”
“Dada,” he mumbles and strings together a few more, unnervingly more awake with each one. Peter raises his head and nearly glances Tony’s chin, only nearly because since parenthood, Tony’s developed a learned response from a few eye-stinging hits that made his molars rattle. This time it’s Peter’s most precious, heart-squeezing stare that causes him to wince hard.
Tony and Peter in the workshop is fast becoming a familiar scene but even so, the familiarity doesn’t blunt the effect the two of them together has on Steve, the sharp and nearly overwhelming fondness. Through the plate glass, he watches them tinker around for a self-indulgent string of minutes. They’re animatedly making gestures at a projected interface when Steve makes his presence known, rapping against the glass.
Every bit of Steve’s senses collapse to the fever pitch of Tony’s hand on him, the quick rise of a very present and undeniable heat. Dexterous fingers curl around his cock and stroke him sure and slow, slick with sweat.
“Yeah? And where do you think I’m at? You make me feel like a fucking piñata, Cap.” Tony says.
Peter glowers at him and is
“I don't.”
“Yeah," Tony murmurs, rueful and fond. "Imagine if we’d waited a few months to get hitched, he could be the drunk one instead of you." He smirks, gently knocking Steve on the shoulder.
old. Go get your paper, Rip Van Winkle. You’re making me sad.” Tony had said. “Shoo, shoo.”
Steve can’t decide whether or not it’s for the best but it’s sustainable for now. If their history is anything to be informed by, attempts at constructive dialogue have a tendency to bring them three steps back. That’s not something they can afford any longer so Steve hems in practiced apologies and declarations and pretends it isn’t cowardice.
Tony closes the little space left between them and the kiss is a sequence of drag-pulls, fighting to breathe each other in. Nearly stupid with want that has nowhere to go and a groan brimming his tongue, he staggers out of it. Steve’s hands keep him upright.
Taking a seat on Tony’s bed feels like some serious overstepping and borderline precarious. However, it’s a wonder that Tony can even breathe with his face covered on top of the congestion, and preventing Tony’s suffocation is a good enough reason to get within an arm’s reach, no matter how intimate. Steve tugs down the comforter to reveal more than the bird's nest atop Tony’s head, and even with how sick he is, Tony’s still the sort of handsome that makes Steve’s thoughts give up. He swallows before speaking. “You sound miserable.”
“This is your world, birthday boy. I’m only living in it,” Tony says, extends a hand. “Lead the way.”
“Honestly, I can barely remember not loving you. There’s the past, the ice, and then you. I think it was happening before I had any idea what it was. You’re so--but there was always some form of distance between us. Miles. That or we couldn’t stand each other. And you were with Pepper and I couldn’t. Not matter how much I wanted to.” And Steve probably won’t ever think back on that without shame or hurt. It burns from his eyes all the way down to his guts. He helplessly shrugs. “I thought it best that you didn’t know.”
Tony runs a hand down his slick back, trails down and over Steve’s ass and up again. He rests his forehead at Steve’s temple, kisses his cheekbone and the slope to his shoulder which he then lightly bites into, gets a shiver.
“You say the sweetest things.” In an octave that causes something inside of Tony to stretch and purr, Steve adds, “You know, you and I haven’t acted anything out in a while. I could come back with the suit on. It’s mine for the three days.”
“I’ll keep it to myself. How about if I kiss you? I can’t think of anything better than kissing you again.”
“You flew me here. You said you had me. I remember that pretty well,” Rogers counters, visibly pleased.
“C’mere. It’s okay. It’s good. You’re gorgeous. Christ, you’re gorgeous everywhere,” Tony murmurs and in the next heartbeat, his tongue soothes over the Steve’s sensitive rim in a gentle coax, moaning shamelessly.
“Myeah.”
“ah, Tony. Please.” Steve keened, when Tony gently nosed his cock.
“What do you need, honey?” Tony asked sweetly.
Steve bit his lip and pulled his shirt up in front of the mirror. His pants rode low on his hips, showing his Adonis belt and treasure trail under his chiselled abs. He angled the camera so his face wouldn’t be visible.
The next morning, Steve went for a shower and then went to the art gallery he worked at. He greeted his colleagues and went to the back, where the painters worked.
“It was great, I went parasailing, you know how I wanted to be a pilot for all my life.” Sam said, Steve did indeed know.
“Turns out I had the wrong number.” Steve said.
“Oh thank god.” He was close to tears. “How is he? Is he okay?”
“Thank you for being honest. Do you need me to dial it down for a bit?”Steve asked.
Never to part

“oh my god. That was so funny.” He chuckled. Steve glared at him and Tony kissed Steve’s thigh.
"Beautiful, honey, give me more." He carefully started moving his finger when Tony had sagged back into the cushions, watching the brunette trash and whrite around. Fighting against his bounds.
When he woke up again, Tony was still fast asleep in his arms. The smell of fresh buns and omelettes came wafting towards them from the bedroom door.
“I like it too, and I like your voice as well. We'll text later?”
“hey, if you’re offering...”
“Hey handsome.” Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck. A large hand trailing up his thigh and squeezing at that pert ass.
“Oh no... Oh no, no, no, no.” Tony sat up Immediately, taking in his surroundings. A gaunt basement in concrete with moist walls and one tiny lamp hanging from the ceiling. A heavy metal door in one of the walls. Tony started taking conclusions, he was obviously drugged to be brought here, most likely with cloroform. He had put up a fight, but he had been outnumbered.  He was so deep in thought he hadn’t even heard the door  open and a masked man coming in.
“Woah tiger.” He chuckled breathlessly. “not that I’m complaining, but what’s got you so hot and bothered?”
“You’d come see me?”
Steve chuckled and pulled the covers over them, kissing Tony on his temple.
“Oh.  Yes..” Tony moaned. “God, wanted to do this since I was sucking your cock. Feels so good.”
“Tell me I’m good.” The other man whimpered.
“It was kind of funny, you still sure you want to do this? She could be back any minute.” Steve anxiously eyed the door.
‘That’s impressive.’ Steve told him.
“What?! No!”
Their food arrived , then, and the waitress shot Steve a worried glance. He just asked for a glass of water, which she instantly brought. Steve took big gulps as Tony still snickered and the waitress hurried away to fetch their food. He gave Tony a look.
Steve chuckled and grabbed his second sandwich, chatting with Sam.  He had another session with Thor planned for the afternoon, some rich lady was willing to pay big bucks for a good painting of Thor’s golden locks and electric blue eyes. Steve was happy to provide the goods.
“Yeah?”
‘Morning. Are you up yet?’
They met again in a tiny diner, and started their lunch with milkshakes.  They had scrambled eggs and bacon with toast and Steve texted Tony about it.
“Are you aware we have all the contacts in your phone Mr stark? There seems to be one number that calls you a lot. What if we pay them a visit?”
“Ah, Mr stark. You are awake. Welcome.” He chuckled.
‘You were the one who wanted to see , remember?’ he pretended to be innocent.
Tony knows his guy better than anyone. So when Steve comes home different, he knows something is up
"I've got the feeling you're about to tell me." The brunet said,  looking at Steve.
“Mine.” he decided, before planting his lips on Tony’s again. His hands started wandering over the naked body of the other and he kneaded at that perfect ass.
Steve flushed and Tony  smiled.
Tony was wrapped around him like a koala , and Steve would enjoy it immensely handn’t his boyfriend (?) been in obvious distress.
“They will find him, Steve. I’m sure. “she said softly.
_____
“Sounds great.” Sam smiled.” By the way I saw your latest piece, it’s stunning.”
“Honey, are you... Are you okay with this?” he asked, Tony nodded, whiskey eyes flashing with lust.
“So much can still happen.” Steve agreed, cupping Tony’s cheek and gazing into his eyes tenderly. Then the car arrived and Tony waved Steve into the car with a big smile.
Steve got up from the couch, another shower it was. He felt light headed and as if he was floating. The gorgeous brunet had once again blown his mind, and he wanted to know the person behind the perfect body and soothing voice better.
Tony ground his hips again, breath hitching with how good it felt. He kept this up for a bit more, and then uncuffed Steve.
“Yeah, since yesterday. He’s doing okay, we video called before bed. “ Steve told his friends while they stopped to drink a bit of water.
“I'm sorry I didn’t mean to...” he stammered
“In a few hours. Just relax Steve, he’s coming home.”
“I get to take you on a date first?” Tony asked. “we can do the talking stuff while having good food and then get to the extra good stuff?”
“Good morning friend steven!” Thor’s voice sounded, and Steve soon located Thor with his  arms around Bucky and Natasha.“Bucky and Natasha told me they’re considering dancing classes. As Natasha used to do ballet.”
“have them wrap it up for later.” He breathed against Tony’s lips.
“I’m so sorry about lunch, sweetheart.” He said, bummed that the press had ruined his romantic lunch plan.
“Hmmhmm.” Tony wriggled his butt and Steve couldn’t hold back on the little moan that escaped him. Then Tony started working, but from time to time he would clench his ass which made Steve’s cock throb with want.
“I’m going to ride you, and then we’re taking a hot shower.” Tony promised Steve, licking the blond’s neck and eliciting another shudder from the blonde.
“Yeah, you like?” Steve smiled. Tony didn’t answer, but instead bent over and pulled  the ring lightly with his teeth. Steve moaned and arched into the touch.
“sleep now.” Steve agreed. “goodnight honey.”
“To be gay? Well I’m not, I’m bisexual. Educate yourself.” Tony said, glowering at them. Another board member laughed breathlessly.
He came with Tony’s name on his lips, hands tightening in Tony’s hair and keeping Tony down there. His ears were ringing and he saw white, it was intense. And then he was floating, just feeling warm and fuzzy and like nothing could hurt him. He could hear Tony chuckle , and that just made him even more at ease. He happily surrendered to the feeling.
https://twitter.com/eriotafterdark/status/1384890374326521859?s=20
“Are you sure you’re up for it?” Steve asked, worry in his voice.
“Would you... Have you considered ....”Tony started, a finger tracing figures on Steve’s pecs. He swallowed, eyes downcast.
“My ma always thought it’d help put meat on my bones,” Steve recalls. He shrugs. “Not so much, but it was always hot and filling. It was good. Mostly, because of how much effort she’d put into it. She could be coming off a graveyard shift at the hospital and it wouldn’t make a difference to her. She somehow always found time for me, and I was always sick more than I wasn’t. She’d make it for me, and I’d do the same for her because she didn’t think of herself nearly enough. You remind me of her in that way.”
“Hey,” Steve whispers. He pads into Tony’s room quietly, not wanting to wake him if he’s asleep, but the mound answers back with a comforter-muffled groan.
Something flickers around Tony’s mouth before it’s replaced by an easy grin. But Steve can’t decipher it, can’t read Tony as well as Tony’s been reading him all evening. Shrugging he says, “Why would I be surprised that the guy brave enough to kiss me in his living room is also brave enough to head off to war? Nevermind that we need all the help we can get.”
Tony sighs and sets Steve’s fake beard in place. “We can’t. You should get out of here and my plane’s already smoking on the tarmac.”
. Way too much. Steve squirrels away and apologizes. “You’re too close,” he explains with a rueful smile. He feels a little guilty but it’s better on the other side of the California King and, not for the first time, he’s glad for Tony’s opulent taste.
“Sir, Mr. Ramirez has asked me to inform you that breakfast is served.”
'okay that previous text was a lie, but even that can’t get you to answer me back? Wow...'
Smuuuuuuutttt
“Tonight?” he asked hopefully. Steve chuckled and pecked Tony’s lips.
“Your Tony? As in the Tony stark you accidently wrong numbered? He’s home again?”
‘Lunch with best friends.  Good times, but looking forward to seeing you tomorrow. If you’re still up to it, that is.’
“Well, what do you want us to be, sweetheart?”Steve asked, throat tight and  heart clenching at the possibility of losing Tony because he had told him he loved him.
https://twitter.com/eriotafterdark/status/1384890374326521859?s=20
“We could make that happen.”
He grinned when the cuffs rattled as Steve fought against them.
“Well, I was a very sickly kid, so I don’t remember much of my childhood.” Steve admitted.”my mum documented a lot of it for me.”
“When will they get there?”
“Shit... Oh...” he tossed his head and his hands abandoned their spot at his nipples to bury themselves in Tony’s hair, and tony went deeper, and deeper. Steve was going crazy. Tony hummed around his cock. Seemingly happy with the cock stuffed down his throat.
“You’re going to love this restaurant.”
“Those damn tabloids, they’re having a field day with this.” The lady at the other side of the line swore. “I hope you’re not one of them .”
Baby mine, dry your eyes
Do you play with them?’
“dunno if I can wait either. Should we skip desert?”  Tony proposed.  Steve nodded.
Oh, this was going to be good.
“So, I know we should probably talk about the whole sexting and wrong number, then me getting abducted thing. But have been waiting to kiss you for forever now, and I… Can I?” he asked, unsure.
Steve nodded, still unable to believe all this. Then he looked at Tony.
Natasha looked at Steve in concern and Steve sighed.
'Hey handsome, what are you doing?’
Keep an eye out for bonus chapters in the future!
“Tony!” Steve said quickly, red as a tomato. Tony chuckled and leaned back in, sipping his wine as he admired the flushed cheeks and bright blue eyes of his date.
“Good because I’m feeling like ice cream and waffles, and I know just the place. I also need to take you to the best restaurant I know.” Tony beamed. Steve smiled and held him for a minute longer.
He settled into the couch and turned on the TV.
“Right, the run.” He yawned. He stretched and slipped out of bed. “I have something to tell you guys.”
“I’ll take that as a yes.” Tony said breathlessly. Steve smiled and cupped Tony’s cheek, gently caressing him with his thumb. He felt Tony lean into the touch.
“I really wish I could kiss you right now.”
Steve was out like a light before he knew it.
“Oh oh... Please let’s make that happen. Tell me you live close by.”
That made Tony smile, and he leaned in to kiss Steve.
“Hey there.” Steve smiled. “You’re still beautiful, darling.”
“I’d like that.”  He said, pumping the artificial cock in and out in the rythm Steve had in mind. “What’d you do next?”
Steve woke up by Tony jerking upright, breath heavy and panicked.
“close your eyes!” Tony said happily, as soon as Steve stepped out of the Heli.
“Feels good, Steve.” He whimpered. Steve licked his lips.
“Hey there.”
“I don’t know, like I’m the most beautiful thing you've ever seen?” Tony said, unsure.
Hope to see you all there ;)
‘Feeling a bit lonely. Why don’t you entertain me, honey, what are you up to?’
Art by the amazing eriot, if someone can show me how to add it to the chapters I'd be extremely grateful
He took a spoon of a bright pink one.
He felt giddy all of the sudden, and a giggle escaped him, a goofy smile on his face.
Tony woke up on a hard floor, his head feeling as if it was stuffed with clouds. He made to rub his temples, only to discover that his hands were bound. He frowned and opened his eyes, memories coming back to him. The fight in the dark, a few harsh blows and then a smell going straight to his brain, making him black out.
‘I think I’d like that’
“ Is it something we can play with, sugar? Is it a toy?” he asked eagerly, and God, Tony was so in love with this man. He was sure that , had Steve been a puppy, his tail would be wagging now.
“Oh… Oh Jeffrey.”he moaned as he too found completion. It was quiet for a moment.
“Can’t wait.”
“Iced tea, please.” Steve ordered. The girl nodded and left them alone, leaving them to choose between all de dishes on the menu.
“Hello?” he asked, breathing hard. Could it be? Had they found him?
Steve gave him an adoring smile.
“Ah, Steve!” Tony moaned. Steve started dotting kisses on Tony’s body while the engineers eyes rolled wildly behind his eyelids, sounds of pleasure escaping his mouth, until.
“I don’t even get a kiss first?” Steve smiled, and of course Tony dove into his arms, kissing him hard before repeating his request.
‘Give me two minutes, in the elevator to my room.’
“Morning Steve!” Sam, one of their best salesmen, greeted them.
“Ah, yes. Big, blushing and blond. But I still don’t see it, what are you saying exactly?” Loki asked, sipping his latte and looking at Tony from over his sunglasses.
Jarvis announced the arrival of the elevator to the penthouse and Tony happily skipped over to welcome Steve home from work. He was in no means prepared for the searing kiss and wandering hands that were laid upon him as soon as that elevator opened.
“I want it. Please, can I?” Tony asked after a few minutes.
“Oh my darling.” Steve said, hand threading through Tony’s hair. He started to hum a lullaby his mom used to sing to him when he was little, and to his surprise Tony slowly relaxed.
It takes another twenty minutes to find Rogers after they lose the feed from the helicarrier that’s been carved out with cannon fire and had its fiery husk plunged into the Potomac. JARVIS detects Rogers’ heat signature near the riverbank, and Tony has no idea how he got there, but he isn’t about to question a small mercy.
“Nothing. Everything’s good,” Peter says, typing furiously.
“I know. However, I also now know that you had no intention of actually modifying his suit with repulsors.”
“Sam was here earlier. He had to head over to the VA for a little while,” Tony tells him, and it's not unlike an apology. “He’ll be back.”
--do you have any idea what you do to me?”
“Sure. I’ll take good care of you, baby. Make it amazing for you,” Tony promises, his tone and the following kiss rough and sweet. With a quick, parting squeeze to Steve’s cock, Tony fluidly rolls them onto their sides and spoons close. Intimately, knees tuck behind his. “There we go. Can you keep your legs together for me? Nice and tight?”
“Alert the masses!” Rhodey proclaims. “Anthony Edward Stark has cracked the code to life model decoys. Hey, LMD—version one-point-oh?—take me to your creator.”
“Can’t exactly do it one-handed.”
“Wearing a leather jacket in the summer isn’t exactly practical.”
A throat clears from the outside of the room before he can finish. Steve doesn’t know who it is. Frankly, he doesn’t care. He can only see Tony because time isn’t about seeking more, it’s about what he has right now in his hands and doing something with it. He won’t break away until the very second that he has to.
“You gotta go,” Tony says after a moment.
"Ignoring you," Tony sing-songs. "Point is, I’m a futurist. Five years, ten years, I’m always looking ahead and you’re always there.”
“Yeah. That would be great but I was never counting on that to happen.” Steve shrugs, conveys a grudging acceptance. “This is just as good. Tony, you’re my friend. Same as Buck.”
It’s so openingly honest, and raw affection climbs up Steve’s ribs. It savagely mugs his heart. Steve has to kiss him, take advantage of every moment that he can. Like he can make up for lost time--the time they won’t get to see--with the press of lips and indulgent hands.
Steve husks, pulling his fingers out. “You can’t just
“Hmm,
“You’re earlier than I thought you’d be,” Sam says when he opens the door.
“Kinda want to get you off first.” The nip of Tony’s teeth scrapes against Steve’s bottom lip before he’s licking in, tongue honey-languid and scavenging. Pooling heat low in Steve’s belly, Tony breathes hot and rough into another kiss, says, “Relax you a smidgen.”
