Tony muttered before his tone turned more serious,
It happened to be one of those days as Tony was working in his lab and his mind chose to relive finding Steve’s belongings gone. Continuing with his welding, he reached for his glass of gin and quickly downed it. He’d been working nearly non-stop on various upgrades and new parts for the Iron Man suit, but so far none of them had produced the desired effect.
“Is that him?” Steve asked, staring through the hospital window. The social worker nodded and followed his gaze, “Yes, it is.”
“I really…screwed up didn’t I?”
Tony could not resist any longer as he cupped Steve’s chin and pulled him to face him, kissing him hard. Steve moaned in happy surprise and bit down on Tony’s lower lip, eliciting a moan from the genius. Steve’s hand found it’s way to Tony’s hip and he yanked roughly on it, pressing their hardening erections together. Tony did not object in the slightest and ground against Steve, feeling all-to-restricted by his clothing. He did not object either when Steve effortlessly picked him up without breaking the kiss and Tony obliged the other man by wrapping his legs around his waist so as not to lose contact.
“I love you.”
Tony nodded and closed his eyes, falling against Steve, who smiled gently. He slipped his arms underneath Tony and lifted him as he stood, carrying him bridal style. For once, Tony did not object, and let his weight fall into Cap’s strong arms and began to slip into sleep. As Tony listened to Steve’s heartbeat and his slow steps, Steve whispered, “I love you Tony…”
Cap sighed and looked at Tony pointedly. “Asleep, huh?”
Steve nodded even though he knew he couldn’t see it. “Yeah.”
Steve figured that his son would fall asleep not long after calming down, so, believing it to be safe, he nodded and motioned to the couch. Steve settled first, stretching out with his back against the armrest and Peter quickly clambered up on top of him and snuggled close, resting his head on Steve’s chest.
Steve ignored the voice and focused solely on the breathing of his husband coming through the earpiece. His throat was tight and thick with emotion but he willed himself to stay as together as possible.
“Oh no, no no no no no no no no no…”
Steve’s heart melted at the boy’s sweetness and concern. He wrapped his arms tight around his son.
Peter’s voice was weak and he seemed out of breath. The husbands froze when they heard the pain and exhaustion clearly in his voice.
They lay there for a long while, listening for the sound of reindeer on the roof, when Peter spoke in a sleep-filled voice: “Papa?”
“Maybe you’re not good enough for Captain America,” he said quietly, looking down and fingering the golden circle around his left ring-finger, “but I thought you were more than enough for Steve Rogers.” He slowly slipped the ring off and let it fall at Tony’s feet.
Tony huffed an amused breath out of her nose. “Uh huh.” She pet Stevie’s back and stared up at the ceiling. “Shit, I really don’t want to go to this party now.” This was comfortable and she didn’t want to get up. Especially not if it meant she had to leave Stevie behind.
"Steve."
Steve sighed as though put upon and picked himself up. He was slouching now that he was standing and Tony tutted. "Stand up straight, honey, you'll have a hunch when you're old."
There was no hesitation to get back to it, and Tony let herself fall back against the pillows, hands gripping at the sheets and enjoying Stevie’s enthusiasm. She was so fucking good at this and it was practically unfair, because she pulled her tongue away and Tony jolted in surprise as two fingers came to replace it.
"I just—" how does he even explain this? It feels so stupid now that it's over. He ruined the scene for nothing. Of course he did, because he ruins everything. Goddamnit. He dug his heels in deeper as tears threatened to fall. He'd be damned before he cried. Maybe he was already damned? There was the whole billionaire weapons manufacturer era of his life. Oh God, it's getting worse. "When I slapped you and dragged you off it was starting to feel like super unsexy domestic abuse, and then I started thinking about Howard and now it's getting worse."
"Then put it on, because I'm not wearing that."
Steve hummed and Tony knew he'd be alright for a quick minute, so he made short work of cleaning himself up and got some ointment out of the cabinet. He dampened a washcloth to clean him up with and once he had what he needed, he climbed back into bed. He wiped gently at Steve's wrists, dabbed some ointment onto them and made sure he was thorough before moving down his body.
Tony raised her eyebrows. “I should be eating
When he was finished, Tony tossed the rag aside and cuddled up next to him. He clapped to turn the lights off and pressed more kisses to Steve's neck, coaxing him into being affectionate and smiling wide when Steve wrapped his arms around him.
"That's absolutely right. Please what, though? Specificity is important, sweetheart."
Tony turned and led her friend into her room with her, not bothering to wait and stripping as soon as she made it through the threshold of her room. She pulled off her t-shirt and tossed it into the chair, unbuttoning her jeans and stepping out of them to toss them along with it. Now in her bra and underwear, she reached for the dress on her bed and stepped into it, pulling it sensually over her hips and up to where she could put her arms through the straps.
Steve nodded, gaze transfixed on his treat.
“Good?” She looked down at her cleavage and ran her hands down her sides, past her waist and over her hips. Stevie’s eyes followed the length of the motion and settled back on her breasts as she nodded. “I would say thank you for your help, but I think I can do better than that.” She took Stevie’s hands in her own and brought them to the hem of her dress.
He was quiet for a moment, struggling to find the words and the motivation to actually get them out. Steve's fingers found their way into his hair and he pulled him close in that stupidly effortless way he was capable of.
What better time than that to milk a quick one and force a second orgasm out of him later? None. Exactly. Tony is a genius in the streets and in the sheets, all to Steve's benefit.
And didn't that just get Tony going.
Steve glared but stood up straight.
Steve was flushed and wrecked, eyes fluttering shut at the compliment. His hips rolled forward again and Tony stopped them in their tracks. "Mm-mm, come on. Off my lap." Steve obeyed, rolling languidly off of Tony's lap and onto the bed beside him.
"Please, sir?"
“Me, then. Let it be me.”
Tony was studying his face, and he could tell that the promise of a treat was softening Steve up.
“Tony.” Her voice was tight, pleading almost.
Stevie’s smile in response was adorable and Tony kissed her lips before sitting up. “Alright then. Time to get you dressed. I’m thinking a Yin and Yang thing, touch of white for me, white for you and a touch of black? Very apt, I think, what with the whole Iron Woman and Captain America thing.”
Steve side-eyed him. He was quiet for a long moment before he asked, "What did you get?"
She was so wet that they entered easily and she had to stop herself from clenching down around them so that Stevie could get them as deep as possible inside her. “I never realized how long your fingers are but those are good. Good hands.
Now it was beyond late. Now it was never, because at least, before the counterstrike, Steve could have had admitted it to Tony, and maybe he could have had closure. But even that opportunity, Steve would never have.
Steve mentioned a waitress wanting to date him, prompting a wide smile and a clap on his shoulder from Tony. The encouragement was received with a downcast gaze and a negation. Tony rolled his eyes.
Tony could not be more thankful that Steve knew what he needed.
Watching Tony with Peter was like witnessing an estranged father dote on his son after years of separation.
Fury allowed them a moment to get a bearing on what he was saying. “Simply put, once Thanos set his eyes on the Infinity Stones, the universe entered a period of quantum instability and cycled between two parallel realities. The cycle only ends with Thanos dying, which is the point of time where we are.”
“They’re clueless.”
Peter entered the room clad in a plump, yellow suit that looked suspiciously like a mutated mouse. “It’s heavy,” he murmured shyly.
Tony smiled and joined him on the couch.
Looking back, sitting on the bench with Bucky giving him all the quiet time he needed, Steve wondered if it was right, if Tony and Natasha really did deserve what they had been given. They had both done
Steve remembered to take care of Tony the way Howard did not.
“Falling down a cliff isn’t funny at all, Steve.”
—the only one who would openly contradict Steve, who would argue to the ends of the earth with him and even smirk at it like he’s having fun, who could draw out the inner Steve and be judgmental and still make Steve feel like he could be himself, which was a mystery in and of itself—had sacrificed himself to end the monster that was Thanos, to right the universe back to what it was meant to be. He had done it without a second thought.
Tony shuffled out of the laboratory in the direction of the kitchen. He was surprised by the mop of dirty blond hair sitting at the island. “Steve?”
The funeral had been brief and small, but all the same, its weight and significance were as palpable as the placid waters over which the wreath floated to a destination unknown to any of the participants. Nobody uttered a word from the moment Happy had turned on Tony’s last holographic message up until the token—Tony’s heart—had disappeared in the distance.
What Steve didn’t expect was Fury taking the initiative. “As I understand it, you went back in time to retrieve the stones and undo what Thanos did.”
“Had that since I woke up from the ice.”
Steve smiled knowingly at him. “Clint told me you had a Captain America portrait in your office.”
While Tony and Steve conversed quietly on the Chitauri incident last month, Clint sat drinking with Natasha. “You think they’ve got something going on?”
Tony huffed, detouring for the couch. “Everybody admires the great Captain America!” Not what he expected was the hand that clapped on his head, ruffling his hair.
“Three days after Chitauri.”
With a strong but consoling grip on Steve’s arm, he led him to that room he wanted him to see. Now where was Captain America’s statue?
Because now, Tony was gone.
“Are you blushing? That’s cute.”
“It’s adorable that Tony spoils Peter, isn't it?”
, and yet, much to Steve’s despair, they still had to
“Steve won this round.” A grunt sounded in her ear.
He flushed and quickly turned around, grabbing a glass from the cabinet and pouring Tony half a cup. He set it onto the counter a little too roughly and Tony raised his eyebrows in silent judgement. Steve hunched his shoulders and looked away, "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to set it down so hard."
This just happened to be the perfect time to go bother him, though. See, Steve over there was halfway done and for most of his chore, he'd had his arms out in front of him. That pressed his pecs together between him and Tony had some ideas about that. Or rather, one specific chain of ideas.
When he comes back into the kitchen, Steve is crying and sullen, back to cleaning dishes at the leisurely pace he was before, only now with a much more disheartened air.
Steve's arms were wrapped around his neck and his fingers were idly playing with the hair at the nape of his neck while Tony's hands found his hips again, thumbs rubbing against his stomach. Tony smiled into the kiss as Steve playfully nipped at his lip, opening his mouth to let the other suck on his tongue for a moment.
Steve is quiet in response, cleaning the last dish and unplugging the drain. The water made a sucking noise as it swirled down and then it gurgled as it emptied. He kept facing forward, even after he'd placed the dish in the drainer to dry.
Stevie shook her head and gave a breathy laugh. “You’re terrible. Come on, I need help with my zipper too.”
“‘A few times’, huh?”
There were two rules when they played with food, one for each of them: Steve was allowed to be as greedy and messy and slutty as he wanted and Tony wasn't allowed to shame him for it. Not that he wanted to, not really. It was really just a rule for the sake of letting Steve know he was safe. Tony had spent far too much time cultivating a lack of guilt where Steve's gluttony was concerned to shoot them both in the foot by making him feel bad about it.
Steve swallowed, “No, no son not at all…” His voice cracked slightly.
“I...um...I had a really good time toni--
It was a while later when Tony emerged from the bedroom, having drifted off while waiting for Steve—he was more tired than he thought. He came out to the living room to find both his son and husband sound asleep on the couch. Tony grinned affectionately and grabbed a blanket from a nearby chair to gently lay over them.
“Tony…you…”
Steve felt his throat tighten and knew that he wouldn’t be able to hold back the tears for much longer. He rested his arm above his head against the wall, the only solid support he had.
A soft click was heard as Pepper Potts opened the door and entered the lab.
Steve, meanwhile, grasped the back of Tony’s head and supported him so he wouldn’t have to lean down as far. His free hand roamed down Tony’s bare chest and pinched a nipple which, much to his delight, caused a brief groan to slip from Tony’s lips.
They stayed there in silence for a long time, Steve resting his head on Tony’s shoulder and not even slightly relinquishing his tight grip, shaking violently all the while. Tony was still somewhat in a state of shock, and being in Steve’s arms again did not help. He let himself be held and lay his forehead on Steve’s chest, listening to the faint but erratic beating of his heart. He sighed softly; it was a sound he missed all too much.
“Daddy! Papa!”
All Pepper could do was look sorrowfully at the broken man and sigh softly before leaving him in what little peace he had.
Steve took a shaky breath and ran a hand through his blonde hair, “He said…he said that while Peter’s condition is stable, they don’t know when he’ll come out of the coma and they don’t have any way to bring him out of it.”
“How could you?”
They broke apart, both breathless and staring at the other. Finally, Steve ran a hand through Tony’s tousled black hair and placed a chaste kiss on his forehead.
“He won’t eat, huh?”
Not wanting to waste any time, the impatient woman cleared her throat, gaining both men’s attention. It was the first time since they’d arrived at the hospital that they actually looked at the social worker.
Tony contemplated waking Steve and carrying the sleeping child to bed, but seeing how peaceful they were, he couldn’t bring himself to do it. Instead, he placed a kiss to the top of each of their heads.
He heard a sad sigh at the other end.
Steve did a mental sweep of his body, wincing slightly when he tried moving his limbs but thankfully found that they all worked.
“Papa!!!” Peter screamed, but no matter how much he struggled he could not break free nor distract the Other.
Peter motioned weakly with his head, “Her.”
Tony sighed. “I suppose we should get cleaned up then,” he grinned and placed a kiss to Steve’s cheek, but suddenly, eyeing one jar left, swiped it and dumped its contents on Steve before he had time to react. Steve started to make sounds of protest, but Tony was already bolting down the hall calling “PAYBACK!” over his shoulder and cackling madly. Steve couldn’t contain his smile as he wiped baby food off of his brow. Sighing, he stood and went after his husband—presumably the shower—and tried to guess how long it would take them to make themselves presentable and also how long it would be until Natasha took them seriously again.
Tony’s protests and indignation were heard faintly in the background and Steve laughed. This was what he missed. The banter, the small moments and the big ones, making dinner, chasing monsters out of the closet, laughing together, movie nights, he missed all of it. It was his family and he had been gone from it for far too long.
“You won’t know if you don’t try.”
Tony watched them drive away before launching himself into the air and in the direction of the hospital.
As he lifted a particularly large block, he heard very faint coughing. Quickly pushing aside more loose rubble, Tony beheld the shredded mask of his son and beneath it he could see one closed eye and a mouth.
His thoughts were interrupted by the harsh ringing of his cell phone. Sighing, Steve rummaged through his bag until he found it and pressed the green ‘talk’ button.
“Rogers!”
Tony sighed heavily as he closed the door behind him. Really, he didn’t understand why Pepper needed him to go to all of these Stark Industries meetings; she
But the Captain had already snatched the papers and pen from her and was pressing them against the window, signing like mad. Stark couldn’t help but chuckle and shake his head. He hadn’t seen Steve this excited and determined since, well he’d never seen him like this, only imagined it when Cap would tell him about trying to enlist in the army back in the forties.
“Oh yeah, we were going to go out to dinner tonight, weren’t we?” Steve mumbled, a faint blush dusting his cheeks as he realized what he must look like. He released his grip on Tony, allowing the other man to stand.
“Merry Christmas, my boys.”
The small voice of the child was dwarfed amid the surrounding chaos and destruction in the Rogers-Stark house, but Steve and Tony heard it all too clearly. Tony blasted away another masked goon and rushed toward his son’s cry. His faceplate had been ripped away, however, and a well-aimed punch had him suddenly staggering. He shook his head and made to strike back when something that resembled a high-tech cattle prod jammed itself into the chest plate, just below the arc reactor.
Steve was frozen during the entire speech and it took him a while to find his voice. When he finally spoke, it was with trembling words.
“You seem to be handling things well, I think you can manage for a little while longer,” Steve teased.
Tony stiffened slightly, but only just.
“Sorry,” Tony murmured, “just thinking.”
The infant squirmed in the high chair, attempting to get as far away from the presented spoon as possible.
The sounds of fists hitting burlap resonated throughout the small gym. Sweat dripped down the man’s face as he continued to beat the sack of sand with controlled but powerful strikes. The blue eyes of Steve Rogers glistened dully, not completely focused on the task at hand. With one final punch, he knocked the bag off of its hook and burst it. It did not faze him in the slightest as he picked up another bag and put it in the last one’s place and then proceeded to attack it. This was how the super-soldier had been spending most of his evenings lately; it may not be everyone’s favourite form of stress-relief, but it worked for Steve. He looked at it practically: constantly exercising kept him in shape for his role as Captain America, and it kept his mind off of things he’d rather forget. He hadn’t done this much since…well since he woke up in the future. Since he realized that most of his friends and family were long dead. Since he realized he’d never see Peggy again.
. You’re the complete opposite of antisocial.”
“Shhh…it’s okay son, it’ll be all right. We’re here.” He leaned over and stroked Peter’s face.
Steve rolled his eyes, not trying to suppress the grin that seemed to be permanently etched on his face since the date began. Tony smiled along with him before clearing his throat.
Tony was snapped out of his reverie by the gentle feeling of water on his hand and it took him a moment to realize that he had started to cry. He hastily wiped away the few tears that had formed and in doing so inadvertently brought the suit nearer to his face where he caught the faint scent of Steve’s cologne. Tony was surprised that it had lasted that long on the clothing, but nonetheless he brought it closer, closed his eyes, and inhaled. It’s funny how many emotions and memories can be incited by a single object or smell, and right then Tony was experiencing all of them, every second he’d ever spent with Steve. All of the missions they’d been on together, the fights they’d had when they first met, the feelings he had when he first realized that he saw Steve as more than a teammate, that first kiss they’d shared, their playful banter, meals cooked together when Tony-the-genius would manage to burn almost everything, those long nights of passion when the world simply melted away, and the simple comfort from being in one another’s arms.
“What’re you going to do with that?” He said, in between coughs and clearly in pain, “Gonna charge me up?”
“I can’t take it anymore Tony!" Rogers' hands were balled into fists at his sides and he was shaking. "I’m tired of long nights alone, waiting up for you to come home drunk out of your mind. Tired of going to stop you before you get your ass hauled to jail.” By this point the tears were slowly trailing down Steve's face, “I’m tired of wondering if there’s some gorgeous girl sitting at the bar that you’re just dying to take home. And now, when you actually do…” Steve turned and rested his elbow above his head and against the wall, his left hand placed on his hip. He ran his right through his blonde hair and faced Tony.
He ran a hand through his hair and sighed, reaching for the bottle of gin. He was about to pour another glass but stopped himself and gently set it back down. He slumped into his chair and rested his head in his hands. A soft whirring and a nudge at his side alerted him to DUM-E's presence. The bot chirped quietly and poked at his master's hand. Tony looked over and placed a gentle hand on him.
All of a sudden, the kitchen turned into a warzone.  A messy, mushy, warzone. The two men were using spoons and their hands to fire projectiles of food and Tony even resorted to trying to fling the mush from directly from the jar itself. Peter just laughed hysterically in the way that babies do and clapped his hands as he was splattered as well.
The heart monitor beeped monotonously in the dim, sterile room, accompanied only by slightly laboured breathing. The smell of disinfectant pervaded the air but was briefly relieved by the faint scent of the coffee held between two calloused hands. Not a word escaped the lips of Tony Stark as he gazed sightlessly across the room, focused on nothing and thinking of everything. He took a slow sip of his coffee but made a slight face and stared in confusion at his now ice-cold drink. Deciding against it, he set the cup on the table next to his chair, where his gaze wandered to the sleeping patient. Tony’s eyes filled with pain as he looked at the young man lying there: his son, Peter.
Tony stared into those blue eyes, expecting to see maybe some form of resentment or hesitation but there was none, only love. Tony sighed and closed his eyes, leaning into the hand.
Tony was taken aback at his husband’s sudden outburst. He was hurt, though not nearly as much as he knew Steve was hurting.
“You’re sure you want him?” she asked.
“You know as well as I do that I wouldn’t be out here if I didn’t care at least a little. Tony…just come off of there a-and we can talk, or you can yell at me, punch me, whatever you want. So please Tony…” He had turned to pleading, he was desperate. He was offering Tony anything he could think of at the moment.
“I…I was right there…I had him Tony, I had him!” He looked up at the other man, tears flowing freely down both their faces. “I had him and he just…he just took him from me…”
When the shaking subsided and the tears were slowing, Steve pulled back from Tony. Slowly, cautiously, he gently tipped Tony’s chin up and placed a soft kiss on his chapped lips. Tony froze momentarily but soon kissed back, matching Steve’s tenderness at first but desperation quickly took over. He was afraid that at any moment Steve would melt away, that maybe this was simply another one of the twisted dreams that woke him so often in the middle of the night. Their hands roamed, running along muscle, beneath shirts, over familiar scars, not in a fit of pleasure, but to reassure themselves that the other was there, that this was
“Were you that worried about him not coming to our house? I mean, I know your father can get up to tricks sometimes but…”
“Y-yeah, it’s me. Hold on, I’m gonna get you out of here.” He gently held his son’s face, noticing the flow of blood stemming from underneath his mask. He began to move the rest of the rock off of Peter.
"You present yourself to me the moment I get home and you perform so well for me…surely you didn’t expect me to leave you unattended?”
“Do you have the papers with you now?”
“You know Tony, we should probably get some sleep,” Steve murmured between kisses, “Peter will have us up bright and early to open presents.”
to. All of those things you said, they’re not even remotely true. We can work on things, work it out, Tony, we can. I just…I can’t bear the thought of not having you…”
, was at the other end of the line.
Finally Tony spoke up quietly, “You know, we still need to decide what to name him.”
“Hmm…” Tony leaned back and raised his eyes to the ceiling, poorly feigning pensiveness. “I think I’d rather sacrifice a few hours sleep to enjoy an early Christmas present.”
“Spider-man!” he shouted as he continued to dig, “Kid! Come on where are you?!”
For an AI, the voice in Tony’s ear sounded worried. Before he had a chance to think, the device was ripped out of him, leaving a gaping hole in the armour, which began to crumple slightly without its power. A switch was flipped on the device and all of a sudden Tony felt himself being flung through the air from a blast fueled by the energy of the suit. He struck a wall and fell hard, knocked nearly into the realm of unconsciousness. He tried to get up, to move, to do anything to go after his son, but he was weakened by the whole ordeal and his own personal life support had faltered. He couldn’t move, no matter how much he pushed himself to, and all Tony could do was pray that Steve would reach Peter in time…
Tony kicked them off and spread her legs, mildly embarrassed herself when Stevie took a moment to tease at the labia with her thumb and apparently appreciate her pussy. Nobody had ever stopped to appreciate it before. Why did that feel so intimate? She almost wanted to ask her to stop, but it was over before she could really begin to consider it, because Stevie had ducked down to lick around her clit.
It matters. It matters a lot, but sometimes it's better to pretend not to give a fuck.
Tony smirked behind him, "You don't mean that. Besides, I wouldn't call 'em tits if they weren't tits, now would I? You
"Mmm, that's the ticket." He pinched harder, abandoning the plug to go two-for-two on Steve's tits. Steve cursed and clenched his fists, making the pain worse by moving side to side and worsening the pull on both of his sensitive buds. "So sensitive, huh? Is that good, sweetheart?"
Stevie was quiet for a moment. “I liked it.”
"Don't throw a fit, now. You can earn back your treats."
Steve smiled as Tony worked their go phrase into his response and then let himself slip back into the headspace of their scene. "Please, sir, will you be rough with me? I'll be good."
Steve's lack of refractory period meant he was raring for a second one not long after Tony had started using him, so all he had to do was give him a little bit of rough treatment and he was spilling over himself once more. He whimpered distantly and Tony shushed him, pressing kisses to his face.
Steve sighed. “Memories. You?” Tony shrugged.
“Captain.”
“Not so soon. I’m looking after someone with self-destructive tendencies.”
with their lives, in his perspective, still so
Fury was ascending the few steps into the ledge when Steve finally acknowledged the call. He stood up and nodded in return. “Fury. I thought you left.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Malibu should work.”
That also meant an overdrive one time too often.
“‘We’?”
The revelation was unexpected, helping Tony realize where his ordeal was coming from. He had never had it before Afghanistan.
Steve contented himself with a glass of bourbon despite its lack of effect on him. He supposed that, at least, he would even take his chance at the mere taste of alcohol in an attempt to lighten the numbness gnawing him from inside. Nowadays, there were not many things that could relieve him of his thoughts. He used to derive much of it from doodling and painting and talking.
And Tony…
Tony laughed. “Charming.”
The passenger door opened. First to step out was Natasha, her hair bright red, her eyebrow quirked like a challenge. Following her, wearing his trademark expensive sunglasses and smirking like nothing had happened, was Tony.
“I can’t miss Grey’s Anatomy!” Steve whined.
Natasha, his best friend of sorts, the one who had willingly substituted as leader when he himself had been compromised, had died to retrieve the Soul Stone, because of course, she couldn’t take it if Laura’s children lost their father. When she had
“Tony.”
Tony scoffed when he saw the look on Steve’s face. “Shush, you. This is for the Medical Foundation. We’re visiting children’s hospitals.”
“Should we tell them about customized scheduling?”
(Bruce had virtually refused any conversation pertaining to her, because that was one of those rare times they would see the old Hulk resurface.)
“Also, that the Thanos who died was a Thanos that was not of this time.”
“They’re idiots.”
“Sounds good.” Steve was grinning. The agents sighed.
“Only for my favorite fan.”
To say that Steve was tired was the understatement of the century. Maybe it was because the Avengers had been like a family that he didn’t find himself yearning much for the past until they crumbled from within. And then he had never felt so alone, just like when he had first woken up from the ice.
Natasha watched this contest of wills continue for ten minutes. Steve was winning, what with him having the remote and Tony not being as physically competent. When Tony slumped in defeat, Steve laughed and gave him a one-arm hug.
Tony was in a bright pink rabbit outfit complete with a set of white floppy ears and cotton tail. If there was a day Steve could say the earth was doomed, it would be now.
“Tony!”
“Over my dead body, Clint.”
“We have two realities behind us. One of them was affected positively by the other reality. That reality, Thanos dies early on and the effects you had when you went back in time caused a butterfly effect. I’m telling you this because sooner or later, the world will again be in disarray. The world will be confused. Questions will be asked.”
“Tony had one who didn’t feel like it.”
“Why don’t the both of you retire, live together, and paint each other’s nails?” Natasha cut in as she entered. They looked at her then at each other. It was Tony who spoke.
Seeing a puppy in the center of the common room had Tony frozen for a full minute. Understandably, the invader was blissfully ignorant of his growing apprehension while it hungrily suckled on Steve’s fingers with quiet, eager whines. Few seconds passed; his mind ran through all the possible complications of keeping a canine under their roof. Before he could voice out what he thought seemed to be the most urgent problem, Steve greeted him with a warm, sleepy grin and an equally relaxed, “Tony.”
A four-legged friend might not be so bad.
Natasha was peeking at his sketch over his head. Steve tilted it back to examine it more.
“Yeah. That was her name. Is there a problem?”
Steve was staring at him strangely, so when he voiced this out, the former’s understanding smile was a relief.
“No. Not yet.” Fury shook his head with a frown. “I have an important matter to discuss with you.” His eye briefly took note of Bucky’s presence before going back to Steve. “He can come, too.”
But now, those people with whom Steve could be open with were gone.
Steve watched from his spot at the ledge as their comrades gradually dispersed while the sun sank lower into the horizon. Few words were shared. Guarantees of meeting again were given, though most could have done with brighter tones. Soon, with the sky a hue of dark orange blending into a vivid red, the only ones left were him and Bucky, with Pepper somewhere in the house getting Morgan ready for bed with Happy’s help.
Steve realized that he was biting the inside of his lower lip. “Fury, what is this all about?”
Tony sat on the seat across from Steve. “Nightmares?”
A lengthy few seconds passed before Natasha answered and Steve realized his mistake.
“It’s a new episode of CSI!” Tony growled.
“How was my funeral, darling?”
Familiar?
He expertly cleaned and dressed the wound, careful not to hurt it any more than it already stung. Then he helped him up the bed, after which Steve laughed, irking him a bit.
“Any chance you’ll retire?”
Fury stopped just a few paces from the car. “Tell me you don’t have conflicting memories right now.”
“What?” He swiveled his chair. Steve had a burger in hand, complete with a frown.
“I like Iron Man,” Steve chuckled. “Can you get me his autograph?”
Steve snorted.
And Steve could only hold back his tears in the background as the ones who had been by Tony’s side all this time, for better or for worse, essentially granted him a release from the guilt he could never really let go.
“Tony?”
But it had been late, for Tony was already married with a kid.
Having an IQ above 200 had many perks, one of which was the ability to solve the most difficult problems in an hour.
Natasha quirked an eyebrow at him. He grunted. “How long?”
“What…are you wearing?”
Steve opened his mouth to say that no, his memories were clear and bright as day, but then he realized that Fury was right. He turned to Bucky, whose eyes had widened in evident surprise.
The brightness was gone from the soldier’s face and his shoulders seemed heavy. “Tony,” he nodded, his voice hard.
“A common saying is that the universe works in mysterious ways.” Fury didn’t seem to hear the question. “Recent developments have made it much more complicated that probably none of us can ever comprehend. I personally consulted Doctor Strange about it. He claims he expected how things have turned out.”
, when her only chance at a happy ending had pushed her away and sought a solution by himself, almost forgetting what they had had.
Tony clicked his tongue upon seeing the large gash running down Steve’s side. The captain’s hiss made his stomach lurch.
“So that means…” Steve breathed, and as he racked his brains for the set of memories he had never had until now, a sense of great hope and relief overwhelmed him.
Watching their leaders bond was the best part of the day.
Ugh, but that's a terrible question. He pressed his face into Steve's chest and didn't respond. He shouldn't hold it in but talking is so hard and this sucks. He pulled back, "Thought of a figure of speech and then took it too literal. Remembered I'm actually a shitty person."
“Sorry they’re not sexier, but I was dressed for comfort. You get it, right?” Her hands cupped Stevie’s unsupported breasts through her shirt, pinching softly at her nipples and relishing in the way that goosebumps broke out over her arms at the sensation. Stevie’s knees were threatening to buckle and Tony backed her up towards the bed, pushing her so that she was back far enough to straddle without the risk of falling off the edge.
Steve nodded slowly, blissed out and clearly on the edge of subspace now that he was nonverbal. Still, he had attitude—that rarely went away. He swirled his hips, an obvious sign that Tony should be taking care of him in other ways as well, and Tony smacked his thigh.
"I went to your favorite bakery."
He pulled them on and got to work, thoroughly scrubbing every inch of the first plate with the sponge and flipping it over to clean the back as well. He was tense when he started, overly scrutinized and pissed at Tony for being an asshole, but as Tony kept his comments to himself and watched quietly as Steve cleaned cups and forks and bowls, he gradually started relaxing.
He sort of felt bad, but seeing Steve frantically begging was almost enough to have him blowing his load on his pants. Steve is so hot when he forgets himself and follows his impulses and desires, but more often than not he's too hyper-aware and insecure. It fucks Tony up to see all of his barriers crumble, and to be the one to take him apart like this.
She checked her email while she waited for her friend’s response, ignoring the end of the current one as soon as she got the text notification.
It was nice to be able to make up for where he felt he'd messed up by taking care of Steve, running a hand up under his apron and over his thigh as Steve savored his bite. When Steve opened his eyes and his mouth, Tony prepped another bite and let him take it, repeating the process until the second cupcake was gone.
“No, yeah, of course, please continue.”
“... I could come with you? We could get something to eat after and maybe go for round two if you’re up for it.”
He'd been vague when he'd asked Steve to wear an apron because he knew that if he tried to give them what they both wanted, Steve would reject it. Getting him to agree to the scene for today was a chore all its own, so ruining all his hard work by mentioning the pièce de résistance just wouldn't have been worth it. Anyhow, the way Tony sees it, it's easier to ask for forgiveness than for permission.
"Shoulda thought about that before you talked back. I would have made an exception, but you couldn't even do the one thing I asked of you. All you had to do was eat and wash the dishes." He was playing up his disappointment and it was paying off.
Deciding that was enough, he started to really jerk him off, going for gold as he waited out Steve's ridiculous ability to hold his breath. If he pulled his hand away too soon, he wouldn't feel the effects of Tony's hand around his throat. That was no fun. So, there was a lot of time to kill as he waited him out.
The kiss ended too soon for Tony's liking, but it was worth it to see Steve flushed, eyes wide and pleading as he asked, "How are you, Tony? Checking in."
He cursed as was fully seated, a hand coming up to keep messing with the clothespins and then he started fucking Steve in earnest. His grip was bruising and he was so, so looking forward to seeing Steve all bruised up and tender after this. He's always so gorgeous after a good fuck. Always gorgeous, but Tony is obsessed with all the different packages that it manages to come in.
With the straps perched delicately over her shoulders, Tony turned around. “Stevie?”
He wasn't going to last long, hard as he was before this and now that Steve's tight, wet heat has him surrounded. Steve was pliant and quiet under him, nails digging into his palms as Tony's cock split him open. He was rough and fast and pushing Steve's body up the bed with the force of his thrusts, which Steve would be vocally enjoying any other time, but now he was just a glorified cocksleeve. God, he's so hot.
"Could you get me some lemonade, please? It's in the picture." Steve didn't look amused, so Tony added, "You're such a sight I'm just parched, doll."
Just like the rest of you."
Tony waved a hand, “I get what you mean. This is more fun.” She got up off the bed, made her way to the restroom to wipe herself and then came back to grab her panties off the floor and pull them back on. Stevie did the same—grabbing her shirt on her way in—as Tony slipped on black metallic bracelets and stilettos. When she came back, Tony held up two necklaces. “The white diamond or pearls?”
Untying the apron, he threw it onto the floor without a care and continued on with his methodical aftercare, taking care of him and making sure that Steve was alright. He was, which was a relief, and for all the ways he wasn't, he would be. That was the name of the game.
Tony smiled, proud of him. "I would
Steve was furiously scrubbing now, hands shaking as Tony continued to feed him and talk dirty. The cupcake was gone in two more bites and Tony tossed the wrapper aside to grab both of Steve's precs. He pressed them together to admire the cleavage he could spot under the collar of the apron.
Steve nodded frantically, desperate for friction on his cock or to have something going to town on his ass, so Tony took mercy on him.
“It’s up to you, Stevie. I can do this either way you want it to be done.”
"And you said it was cream filled?"
"Hey, no, you're not a shitty person, Tony. You turned things around and that means something. You're not like Howard and I'll keep reminding you until you believe it." Again, Tony didn't say anything, and when the silence dragged on for a longer time than it had the other two times, Steve added, "I really liked it, though. If I didn't I would have safeworded out, you know that."
“How did you know?”
Stevie moaned above her and Tony could tell she was getting worked up, which seemed to have easily reached its peak when she grabbed Tony by the hips and rolled them over. With Tony now on her back, Stevie was looking down at her with a hungry and desperate expression. “Let me eat you out?”
He let go and Steve slumped forward, hips trying to find relief against the doors of the cabinet in front of him. Painslut that he is, he could probably make it work, too, so Tony had to move his hands to his hips to still him.
Tony peeled off more of the wrapper to give Steve another bite, and once he was completely disarmed, he used his left hand to reach around and grab Steve's pec. "These'll go right to your tits, y'know. I haven't made good on my promise to buy you a bra, have I?"
Tony grabbed for the plug and Steve's whole body tensed up. He waited and when Steve relaxed, he pulled it out halfway and thrust it back in.
“Fuck, oh my God,” she raised herself up with her elbows, “Have you done this before?”
"It's a surprise." Steve's pout was back with a vengeance. "But," Tony started, relishing the way his lover quirked a brow and turned his head just slightly—body language betraying how amenable he was to whatever Tony would suggest, "if you get up off the floor, maybe I'll give you a hint, hm?"
“Go on. I want this. I want
Stevie flushed. “Uh, Google. And lots of practice.”
Thankfully it didn't take long since Tony had purposefully neglected to order more food, leaving the fridge fairly barebones. To compliment it, though, he'd kept the cleaning staff from doing the dishes the past few days so that he would actually have something for Steve to do. Once he closed the fridge, Steve was headed to the sink when he saw the counter. He frowned and grabbed a rag from the drawer, wet it under the faucet and then wiped down the entire thing.
He was so thorough and determined to make sure that it was clean that Tony felt something hot settle in his stomach. The words
He pressed a desperate kiss to Steve's stomach and rode out the wave of his orgasm, curled around him and tiredness seeping in now that adrenaline of the fuck had left him.
to." He pressed his front along the back of Steve's body and watched from over his shoulder as he held the cupcake to Steve's mouth. Steve was rigid against him. "Bite. This is the only time I'll instruct you to do so. If there isn't enough for you to bite because the paper is in the way, I'll peel off more. You know I like you greedy, but you still have dishes to wash and I expect them to get done."
out. This is a thank you.”
Steve flushed even brighter and ducked his head, "Thank you."
“Okay… maybe more than a few.”
Stevie stood up and Tony preened as her eyes immediately found their way to all of the cleavage that was made visible by the deep scoop of her dress. She flushed even brighter and her gaze flicked up to meet Tony’s, the guilt obvious on her face.
When they broke apart to let Tony breathe, she looked down at Stevie’s tits. Her nipples were sore, presumably from where they had hung down against the sheets while she was eating Tony out, and she gave them an experimental pinch. Stevie whimpered, frotting harder, and when Tony lifted one up to bite at her, she cried out with stuttering hips and slumped against her.
He pulled the plug out, lubed up his cock and thrust in all at once, hands braced on Steve's waist.
flitted through his mind, and when Steve stepped back with a satisfied smile at his hard work, Tony was just a little bit wrecked.
"You don't wanna start with the fridge?" He asked, inquisitive. He'd said Steve's chores in a specific order, after all.
She only lingered there for a moment before tonguing her way down and into the folds of Tony’s pussy, tongue teasing a circle around her labia minora before dipping into her vagina. Tony moaned and gripped at Stevie’s short-cropped hair for purchase, grinding her hips forward to get her tongue deeper. Stevie was all too happy to let her keep going, using her tongue to fuck into her.
He spent a few good minutes changing his pace and pressure and with Steve so far gone, his orgasm almost came as a surprise. The only warning he got was a quick twitch before come shot out across his apron and covered Tony's hand.
Tony had to hold back a chuckle. "Then prove it." He smacked Steve's ass in full and goaded, "Prove to daddy you're more than just a pretty face, huh, doll?"
She glanced over at Stevie who was sitting on the other side of the bed and politely averting her gaze, blush high on her cheeks. What a waste. Tony was performing and Stevie wasn’t even paying attention.
It was a tight fit, purposefully a size too small but worth the effort that went into zipping it up every time she wore it. Stevie always made things like this easy, because while Pepper or Rhodey might struggle with it, Stevie had her super soldier strength to make it work.
Stevie whimpered at the praise and nuzzled into Tony’s neck, her fingers pulling her long brown hair aside for better access. She ran them through it cupped the back of her head with part of her hair as a cushion in her palm. Tony melted at the touch and settled back against the pillows to hold Stevie who had dismounted and shoved her own pillow away to get closer to Tony.
Steve whined, shaking his head. "No, no, no. I want my treats, please. I'll be good, I promise. Please, sir."
Tony held his throat, squeezing with a practiced efficiency as his free hand worked over Steve's cock. He pumped him once and teased his way back up with the webbing between his thumb and pointer fingers; a lazy glide until just up under the head when he teased it some more and then pinched the tip. He played with the precome, swearing it across the head and then gave Steve's balls a rough grip just for the heck of it.
"I'm not gonna ask again. You put the apron on like you said you would or I'll put it on for you. Either way, you're wearing it."
"Steve, turn around."
Nothing.
"Of course I can do that for you." He sounded offended by Tony's condescendingly sweet way of talking.
And that did the trick, he was back to being hard at work.
Then, he let him go. Steve heaved in a breath, chest rising and falling as he tried to make up for the deficit of air in his lungs, and Tony moved on.
"More, please, fuck,
When they were clean, she wiped the spit off on her sweatpants and Tony was weak. She grabbed one of the pillows on her bed and threw it longways over her thigh. “Up. Ride it.”
"Goor job, Steve. You were perfect for me. Just like you always are."
Tony pulled them out a bit, watching as Steve moved forward to keep them there but backed away to let Tony fuck his mouth a bit. And then he shoved his fingers in hard, choking Steve on them and watching him gag. He clutched his stomach and pretty tears welled in his eyes, the blue of them shining as the light caught them.
He reached up above Steve's head and grabbed the clothespins, smirking as Steve's eyes squeezed shut and he moaned lightly with anticipation. Happy to give him what he wanted, Tony let one bite down on his nipple, opening and closing it on a whim just to see how much it wrecked Steve before repeating the process on his other one.
“You got it.”
Steve agreed to wear an apron. Tony simply took that to mean any old apron would do, and his apron of choice was a vintage with bows decorating the hips and frills to really seal the deal. The red, white and blue thing was cheesy, so Tony had cut the red and stuck to white and blue. He was shirtless so the white contrasted nicely against the pale peach of his skin tone, the blue made his eyes stand out nicely, and hell… he was already blushing a gorgeous shade of red.
Steve moaned and squirmed, trying to fuck himself on it as best as he could, but Tony held it in place until he got the hint and stopped, letting his dom set the pace. He was leisurely, taking the time to admire Steve's nipples. "I'm definitely ordering you a bra after this. Look at these, Steve. They're obscene." He cupped one of Steve's pecs with his free hand and thumbed at his nipple.
He considered him for a moment and then decided that asphyxiation would definitely get Steve there. Tony let his hand rest on Steve's throat and he was met with no reaction other than his already huge pupils getting that much bigger. Oh, yeah, this was the way to go.
“Me?” Her hands were making a steady path up Tony’s thighs. “What about you?” She gripped Tony’s ass and pulled her just the slightest bit forward, since that was all the space there was left between them. Her thumb was massaging circles and it made Tony antsy for more sensation, trying to shift her hips for more.
Peter laughed quietly with Steve before becoming serious again.
For a moment, Steve did not react, but then he stuck his fingers in the jar he was still holding and flicked the food at Tony, who barely had time to react.
Steve had barely slipped off of Tony’s cock before the genius sat up, grabbed him roughly and pulled him into his lap, planting his lips firmly on the blond’s. He licked at Steve’s lower lip, his own taste mixing with Steve’s.
Tony murmured.
Tony huffed and Steve laughed softly at him again. “So how are things back home?”
“I’m sorry Steve…” he murmured, “I’m so sorry…for everything that I’ve done…I’m sorry…” Tears slowly began to slip from his eyes as he shook his head and repeated the words over and over. Steve rested his forehead against Tony’s, wiping away a few tears with his thumb and held the other man gently as he cried.
“Who Peter?”
Steve finally spoke, his voice unsteady from his breathing that was just beginning to slow down, “Tony…I-I won’t lie and say that I wasn’t hurt. I won’t tell you that it didn’t almost kill me when you came home that night. I won't say that everything is going to be okay and we'll act like nothing happened. But Tony…” His arms tightened around the other man and he breathed deep, taking in the smell of oil, grease, and sweat, but he didn’t care. Tony was here,
After Steve had stormed out that morning, Tony ordered JARVIS to let him know if he called or came back while the billionaire was out, something he was going to avoid doing as much as possible. The only word he’d ever heard from Cap was when he came home a few days later and JARVIS plainly said,
Steve was silent for a bit, gazing at the small child he held in his arms. “How about…Peter?”
Steve shuddered at Tony’s words, breath quickening as Tony’s grip tightened and his pace increased. He buried his head in Tony’s shoulder.
“Thursday. 7 o’clock. My plans this time.”
“Peter! Don’t worry we’ll be right there!” Rogers tugged his suit on.
Steve took a few more steps forward so he was at the very edge of the building.
Tony continued to work until he accidentally mixed the wrong wires together, causing a great flurry of sparks to erupt from his project. He jumped back in surprise and shook the hand he burned, which he proceeded to angrily slam on the table.
Concerned, he rushed over and knelt by his son. “What is it? What’s wrong?”
She nodded briskly, ignoring Tony’s comment. “Very well then. The paperwork is mostly done, I just need you both to sign a couple of things-“
Steve snorted, shook his head and entered the elevator, Tony just behind him and quickly pressing the button for Steve’s floor. At the soldier’s raised eyebrow, Tony stood taller and said, nonchalantly, “A gentleman always drops his date off at the end of the night.”
Tony sighed irritably, “And of course he lets her in.”
Steve chuckled quietly, “Yeah, you do.”
-----
“I came to see how you were doing,” she said walking to his side, “You haven’t been to any of the company’s press conferences or meetings. I feel like I haven’t seen you in forever and I was just concerned.”
Steve took a deep breath and, reluctantly, hung up the phone. He took a moment to just breathe and savor the last few minutes and embed them into his memory before clearing his head for the mission ahead. He straightened, roughly rubbed his face, and turned to the still-waiting agent. He put on his best Captain America face and strode towards the door, pausing only to nod briefly at the waiting man, and stepped out.
to go on anothe--”
Pepper laughed humorlessly, “You’re
Tony moved to pick Peter up, but Steve stopped him, “I know it would be faster if you took him, but we don’t want to move him too much with the state he’s in. The ambulance will be fine.”
"What am I doing with myself, boy?"
At that moment, a team of paramedics finally showed up with a stretcher. Tony glanced at Steve and nodded reluctantly as the medics gently moved Peter onto the stretcher and carried him to the waiting vehicle.
Tony’s brain short-circuited completely as Steve did not hesitate and took Tony’s entire length into his mouth. He moved up and down painfully slowly, massaging with his tongue as he did so. When he pulled up and swirled his tongue around the head, Tony let out a long moan and grasped Steve’s hair in one hand. He forced himself to sit up slightly and, propped up on one elbow, he took in the spectacular sight.
“Don’t even try coming after the boy,” he hissed menacingly, “Or next time I’ll make sure your back breaks. I’ll rip that precious machine heart out of Stark, and there will be nothing you can do to stop me.”
"You're so pretty when you cry for me, sweetheart." He pulled his fingers out and licked them, holding eye contact the entire time. When he pulled them away from his face, he wiped them off on the sheets making a pointedly considerate noise as he said, "Well, look at that. You are what you eat after all."
With one last thrust from the fingers inside of her, she was coming, head thrown back and eyes rolling back with it. Stevie wasn’t stopping though, her fingers still thrusting. She’d pulled back to watch Tony lose herself and she smiled down at her, far too wholesome for debauching her in her own bed like this. She whined, oversensitive and Stevie pulled her fingers out. She looked around for a second but then shrugged and just shoved them into her mouth, cleaning them off with her tongue.
She shoved her face into Stevie’s tits and started sucking, enjoying the weight of them in her palms and bouncing them slightly to really appreciate it. Biting down just enough to really work a hickey into place, she moved down to where her nipple was so that she could suck on it, laving her tongue around the areola and over the bud itself.
"Yes, sir." Steve bit into the cupcake and moaned, going limp against the edge of the sink. His hands were limp in the water as he chewed and that just wasn't going to work.
Stevie shushed her and felt along the top, looking for her g-spot. She knew she found it when Tony moaned out loud and tensed up, melting into the sheets. Stevie massaged it with her fingers and pulled them out. She thrust them back in and stuck the landing, having memorized where it was. God bless America for the super serum and the eidetic memory it had given her.
Tony shrugged. “Shot in the dark. You had a vibe.”
Oh well, that wouldn’t be the case for long.
“You’re not dressed already?”
to wear bras, don't you Steve? You'd look so pretty and they'd be bras that I buy for you. Don't you like that idea? My bras for your tits because they're
She circled her hips to try to get some friction from Stevie’s stomach against her clit and reached for her shirt to pull it off. Her arms went up easily to accommodate its removal and then her tits were huge in front of Tony. “Fuck, Stevie. You’re gorgeous, y’know that?”
"Okay, honey. I'll hurt you. Suck on my fingers, huh?" He pressed two fingers to Steve's lips and he opened his mouth eagerly, sucking on them like they were one of the best things he'd ever had in his mouth. And maybe they were. Steve was a simple man, he liked cock, fingers and sweets, though not necessarily in that order.
"Steve." He smirked at Steve's embarrassed look and reminded him, "Put your back into it, baby. If I don't see a little elbow grease, you're not gonna see a lick of icing."
“I’m glad.” Tony pressed a kiss to the top of her head. “You eat pussy like a champ, by the way. Where did you learn that?”
Steve looked up, his smile falling a bit. Oh well, he was a brat. Nothing was going to change that.
When Tony snapped the vibranium cuffs into place, Steve whimpered and shut his eyes tight, forcing more tears down his face. He was already purposefully fighting against them because Tony had put on the pair without the soft lining and he wanted to feel the metal dig into his wrists. He was content to let him do so, if he wanted to fret he'd do it during aftercare. Steve rarely liked when he made a big deal about it unless he was in a mushy mood, otherwise having Tony fuss at his injuries usually just irritates him, if it just didn't affect him at all. He heals, what does it matter, right?
He tapped Steve's hip to get him to lift and situated a pillow under them, reaching for the drawer of his nightstand to get the vibranium cuffs out. Steve was watching him the entire time and he had a pathetic look on his face, more tears welling up and spilling over, but he didn't protest.
“Ooh, look at you. Everyone’s going to either want to be us or fuck us but we’re the only ones doing either of those things. What a powermove.”
Tony looked down. “Oops. It’s fine. Come with me.”
Stevie pulled away, “Uh, yeah, a few times. Can we talk about this later? I really—” her gaze was locked on Tony’s cunt and Tony felt disgustingly wet.
That was part of the reason Tony liked things like this. Steve needed more reasons to relax, he just often needed to be forced into it. Not entirely unlike Tony, if he was being honest, but that's why they have each other.
Tony hummed an affirmative, pulling open the delicate bow and lifting the lid to reveal 4 beautiful cupcakes. The cake was pink, topped with white frosting and garnished with a whole strawberry sans the calyx. The fruit shone with a candied coating Tony picked one up, holding it gently between his fingertips.
He uncuffed him and set them aside, checking his wrists to see how bad they were this time. Far from the worst, he noted, and they were already starting to heal. He unpinched the clothespins and clipped them back into place on the headboard. "I'm gonna clean you up, okay? I'll be right back, sweetie."
Steve looked around to see if they were in plain sight, and then he opened the drawer to his left. Inside were a pair of yellow gloves that Tony had put in there especially for him. He was planning on fucking Steve within an inch of his life after this, and personally he wasn't into being touched with soggy hands. Plus it really added to the whole vibe, so what the hell. Two birds, one stone.
“Okay, okay.” She kissed Tony like she was starving for it as her fingers worked under the edge to pull the fabric back over her hips. Stevie broke away to watch as she switched methods and pushed it up with her thumbs, slowly revealing Tony’s conservative black silk panties.
He liked the cuffs, he was probably just in the mood to be touchy and Tony was happy to take that privilege from him. Besides, he gets a little squirmy when Tony plays with his nipples, so he has to wrangle him in somehow.
So pretty when he's shy, fuck.
She shot Stevie a text.
Back at the sink, Steve had the choice of using a scrub brush or a sponge, and bless his heart, he went for the classic green and yellow sponge. He went to reach for a dish and Tony admonished, "Ah, ah. Use the gloves. We don't want your pretty hands getting all pruny, do we?"
"Yep." He popped the P, pulling down the edge of the cupcake tin, "With strawberry bits inside to boot. Isn't that sweet?"
"Aren't ya s'posed to be makin' me not hold back? Sounds like more of a reason to shut my mouth to me."
Steve hummed, pleased, and he was asleep not too long later, Tony close behind once he was sure his job was done.
“White diamond. I have an onyx necklace that looks a bit like that.”
Tony went to get the little box the bakery had packaged Steve's desserts in and brought it with him as he joined Steve at the sink. Steve looked over at him and he looked weak, "Already?"
Steve nodded, half-wrecked just from having to ask. "I'll be good! No more being bratty, only good, I just—" he squirmed in Tony's lap like an anxious puppy, "I want it. To hurt." He turned his face in Tony's hands and nipped at the side of his finger, checking his face to see if he was into it.
After twenty minutes of ignoring the fact that she needed to get dressed, Tony finally stood in front of her closet and shifted through her dresses to decide what to wear.
Comfortably pacing her fingerwork, Stevie worked her tongue around her fingers and licked upwards until she got back to Tony’s clit, laving her tongue over it and taking it between her lips to suck on it. Tony’s hips bucked and she let out a broken moan. One of Stevie’s hands came to her hips and held her down, the show of strength enough to have Tony weak and so turned on that it actually hurt.
Stevie’s eyes fluttered shut and her lips found Tony’s thigh, peppering it with kisses that started trailing upwards and between her legs. She pressed the tip of her nose against Tony’s clit and it took a lot of self-control not to frot against it. She shuddered as she inhaled and then she was cursing, lifting Tony’s hips as preamble to pulling her underwear down and to her ankles.
Still, Steve got off on shame. He liked being held down and talked down on and teased when it came to things he wasn't actually sensitive about. It made for a good weapon. Especially in times like this, when Tony's oh-so-capable Captain found himself not-so-capable at the hands of his sugary addiction.
Steve's voice was rough as he specified, "Please, sir. Feed it to me?"
"Steve."
Tony raised her thigh to get Stevie into gear and then she was desperately rutting against the pillow and kissing Tony like her life depended on it. Tony sucked her tongue into her mouth and she could taste herself, whimpering slightly and trying to pull Stevie closer so she could feel her tits against her chest.
"I'm golden, sweetie," he reassured.
Tony gave her a lascivious smile and let Stevie take her hand to lead her to the elevator.
"Dearest," Tony called out.
They pulled apart and Tony shook his head, "Alright, you brat. Let me get some cake in your mouth before you try to eat
Tony kissed over the bite and held up Stevie’s weight. “Good girl. You were so good for me.”
It was hot as hell, and Tony was almost achingly hard against his backside, but that just wouldn't do at all.
Shame blossomed across Steve's face and he crumpled, "Please. Please," he watched as Tony closed the box and took it away, his eyes growing wide and his tone frantic, "No! I can wash them, please!" He was cleaning the plate in his hand as fast as he was capable of, "I don't want to be punished, I want to be good! Tony!" But Tony wasn't listening anymore, walking off with the box to hide in their bedroom.
He reached for the box and worked it open awkwardly with one hand before reaching inside to grab one. He peeled away the decorative wrapper and held it to Steve's lips, similar to earlier, but this time it was better because he had a lapful of his lover. He watched fondly as Steve's eyes fell shut during his bite. He always luxuriated in the taste and the texture against his tongue, appreciative in a way Tony couldn't relate to. But he could appreciate Steve's appreciation. He liked Steve bratty, but he also liked him sweet and pliant and sugary when he fucked his tongue into mouth—that was Tony's treat.
Steve squirmed again and Tony fucked the plug in and out to soothe him, pinching at his nipple at the same time to give Steve some dual sensation. He gasped as it hit his prostate and the pain coincided, moaning out loud and going slack against the bed.
Steve's fingers were steady in his hair, nails scratching against his scalp, and Tony almost wanted to melt. "Worse how?"
Shit. Tony cupped his face, thumb caressing his cheeks, "You want me to be rough with you, sweetheart?"
starting with the fridge," he responded, petulant. "I just want to let 'em soak while I do. Makes 'em easier to wash."
Tony thought about it. "Yeah, uh, let me just go get your cupcakes." He rolled out of bed and grabbed the box off of the shelf in the wardrobe so he could set it on the nightstand on his side of the bed. He crawled back in as Steve shucked his jeans onto the floor and when Tony laid back against the pillows, Steve straddled his hips to kiss him.
She gripped the sides of the dress firmly from the top and worked the zipper up, slow but steady. Tony closed her eyes at the sensation of Stevie’s fingers against her nape and sighed contentedly as she slid it to the top. She took her hand away and Tony turned around before she could back away.
Since it was a black and white formal event, Tony quickly narrowed it down to one of two options: a form-fitting black dress with lace sleeves and a deep collar, or a white dress with an open back and dainty-looking collar to hold up her breasts. Frankly, she couldn’t decide.
“That sounds nice. I’ve always wanted to do a coordinated outfit with someone.” She had a far off look for a second and then said, “I guess that was pretty much the entire war, but that’s less…”
