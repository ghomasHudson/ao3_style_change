Natasha and Wilson came up together, sweaty and out of breath (in Wilson’s case) and immaculate with not a hair out of place (also looking very much like something out of his wildest dreams) in Natasha’s case. Apparently they were in the gym together and had sparred.
Pouring himself a cup of freshly brewed coffee, courtesy of Steve, Tony walked over to the couch and sat next to Clint, deciding he might as well take a break from coding and inventing for awhile. Plus, if he stayed topside for a little bit he’ll be able to see Steve coming in from his morning run, sweaty and delectable with his shirt clinging to his torso. Yeah, he’ll stay awhile, Tony thinks.
“Why did they even invent piano?” Maria sullenly commented from the bar.
Pierce stared at them a moment longer before deciding to leave the couple to their own devices. As he left Steve remarked, “That’s not gonna be the last we see of him.”
And so it was that Steve found himself that evening in Tony’s recovery room, a recovery room that was crowded and noisy that he had to apologize several times to the nurses who were on duty. Somehow, someone (Steve was pretty sure it was Clint) had smuggled in Tony’s favorite pastrami sandwich, which he was eating on the bed right now with Ulysses snuggled up in his lap. The boy refused to budge from his Babbo’s side ever since they were allowed to see him. Thor had brought sleeping bags and air mattresses, because apparently everyone intended to stay overnight with him and Tony. After Steve explained to them that no one but him was staying overnight, Thor shrugged and used the sleeping bags as carpets to spread out on the floor and now he, Sam, Bucky and Clint were playing poker on it. The air mattresses have been blown up to be makeshift couches for Natasha and Bruce to sit on.
Steve pressed a soft kiss to his forehead, smiling down at Tony. He knew Tony hasn’t been feeling his best lately, that he was self-conscious of his body postpartum but to Steve, he had never looked more beautiful than he was right now. It was proof that Tony had just given them the greatest gift of all, their son. And damn, if Steve couldn’t make him see that he desired Tony just as much now as he did before Ulysses came. They might not be able to do much now, on account of the afterbirth discharge, but once that was done all bets were off.
“Shut up, punk. Look, I can prove it’s not me. Here’s my ID, you can check yourself.” Bucky took out his drivers license and placed it on the table for TSA officer to see.
“It’s why I own this place and you never will, okay? So, drink? Or are you gonna leave?”
“Their names are so...ordinary. Just like us mortals.” Anthony concluded.
“Maybe we should get rid of it.”
Steve looked to Natasha in question, asking her whether Barton was on the up and up. Natasha answered him definitively, “He’s good.”
“Hello, JARVIS. It’s good to be back. How is everyone?”
“Yup. Plus there’s a cafe and free wifi inside, we can get warmed up for a bit. I hate walking around in these wet boots.” Ellie made a face at the soaked boots she was wearing. She should’ve spent that extra money to buy waterproof boots.
“Boy, you better stop lying to me and your Papa or I will fly up there and tan your hide.” Tony told him.
by James Joyce. When it first came out as a serial novel, it was banned and later censored in the US because of the sexual contents and later, Joyce’s literary style that sharply diverged from the conventions made the book controversial. Steve had been lucky enough to found a copy of the complete novel in a bombed out library they were taking refuge in when he was stationed in Europe along with the Howling Commandos. He read the book from cover to cover under HYDRA bombardment, laughing like a loon at the high and low brow humor Joyce liberally peppered his writing with, and becoming solemn and introspective at passages in which Leopold Bloom contemplated his life and his unfaithful mate. The vivid and descriptive languages Joyce used was fascinating to Steve. As an artist, he always had a good imagination. Reading
“Well, you took care of me for the last two. Time for a change of pace, don’t you think?” Tony spooned some broth to Steve’s mouth, and his mate obediently opened his mouth to accept the food Tony offered.
“Tony, if you were really heartless then you wouldn’t care about Bruce’s anxiety problems, or that time our insurance wouldn’t cover Clint’s hearing aids and you paid for them out of pocket. Tony, you’re the most caring, kind and selfless man I know. Heartless isn’t an accurate word to describe you. Passionate is what you are.”
“Tony, baby, what’s wrong? Why are you crying?”
“Estimations of error rate?”
“Yeah, I’m happy, Buck. The happiest I’ve ever been. And I know you could be happy too, Buck. You’ve spent so long punishing yourself for what happened, it’s high time you try to forgive yourself.”
“Hey, Avengers Tower is close by. Wanna go there next?” Ellie suggested to her friend.
Washington DC at night was loud and busy. Tony never noticed before but his wandering mind couldn’t help but take in the cacophony of cars and pedestrians, all hurrying to get through the hustle and bustle of the DC metro area. Even at this hour of the night, the streets were still packed, tourists and college students were everywhere, spilling to the streets in search of the fun and release offered by DC’s nightlife scene. Tony listlessly walked along the streets with his head down, something he never remembered doing in all his life. Tony Stark has always held his head up high. They told him that it was unbecoming for the heir of a multibillion dollar company to project self-defeat and submission. It was unbecoming for the heir of a multibillion dollar company to be an
For standing in front of Anthony, as he made a fool of himself straining for a thin metal strip in the sand while chained to damned rock, was a perfect specimen of a human being. He was blonde haired and had eyes as blue as the sky. He was tall, taller than Anthony, and built handsomely with strong arms and legs. His face was a work of art to say the least, with a sharp jawline that looked like it was carved from marble by Apollo himself along with his patrician nose and eyebrow. The dark blue chiton and silver brooch he was wearing complemented his alabaster skin well, bringing out the blues of his eyes and accentuating an ethereal glow about his person. He looked like every single one of Anthony’s dreams personified.
Tony was silent as Steve relayed the stories of his father’s life, the only sign that he was listening was his slow stroking of Steve’s cheekbones as he talked. “He sounded like a one man warrior.”
“Fine, last one this season. Then you can start pimping yourself out instead of me. Nat tried to talk to me about feelings this morning, and you don’t know how awkward it was until you see a compassionate Nat instead of murderous Nat.”
“Pun absolutely intended.” Anthony snickered at him. Steven leveled him with a flat, unimpressed look which didn’t deter Anthony from laughing at him. “Oh, come on Steven. This is amusing. This statue is one of a kind. Not what I expected from the God of Poetry and the Arts, but I have to admit I like it better this way.”
“I’m a trained chef. Finest culinary schools in Europe, I’m a James Beard nominated Chef and I interned with freaking Wolfgang Puck
“I love you,” Tony whispered to Steve. He moved closer to his family, wrapping his arms around Steve and the boys, he kissed Steve once more. Then for his boys’ benefits kissed each of them on the cheek, “And I love you, my boys.”
“You lovebirds about done here?” Barton’s voice broke through their haze.
I don't mind
Tony had to nip that shit in the bud. He wasn’t about to invite General Hospital and Wendy Williams in to his Tower, okay? It would be detrimental to Ulysses’ early growth and development. So as soon as Dr. Rosenberg cleared him and Ulysses, he (made Steve) packed up his shit and booked it out of the hospital. Now he was home, back in his tower with his baby, his mate and his family around him. Pepper finally came and visit after weeks of overseas travel to SI subsidiaries. As predicted, she fell immediately in love with her new nephew. Ulysses was awake when she visited and she cooed endlessly at his gummy smile, his blue eyes, even the spit bubble he blew in her face.
“Hmm,” Tony hummed, Steve’s gentle massage on his lower back felt good, “we should go visit sometime. If you want.”
“Thank you, Tony.” Steve kissed him gently. “Now, I have to tell Buck that he has to be ready for a baptism. Should be fun explaining to him that everything is now in English.”
“We won.” Steve told him after they broke apart, faces still inches away from each other. Tony’s amber eyes hazy and trained on his lips, “Alright…” he said faintly, “Hey, alright. Good job team. Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's just take a day. Steve, baby, have you ever tried shawarma? I saw a shawarma joint about two blocks from here. I don't know what it is, but I wanna try it.” then he started rambling in the most adorable way possible and Steve was helpless to do anything but smile indulgently at him.
“Well if we didn’t do it, then why do we need a lawyer?” Natasha Romanov, the bar’s hostess asked, “Unless one of us did do it?” she tilted her head sideways.
“I’d be delighted to,” Thor stood up and followed the scientist to the kitchen, smiling at him the whole time. Tony and Steve watched the exchange silently from the couch, before they glanced at each other with a knowing smile. Tony settled back down in Steve’s embrace only to hear Steve said, in his terrible Bogart impression that never failed to amuse Tony, “Tony, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.”
“They were badgering me so much I had to cut the meeting short otherwise I won’t be held accountable for blasting a repulsor in their faces.” Tony heaved himself up unto one of the stools. The added baby weight was making it more difficult than usual to sit by the kitchen counter, but he’ll manage. In a couple more weeks, he’d probably need Steve to put him in a wheelbarrow and push him wherever he went. Hah, wouldn’t that be a sight.
“Nothing’s wrong, Steve. How was Barnes?” Tony futilely tried to change the subject.
Evening dawned, and with it Steve’s plans for a romantic dinner for two with Tony. He had confirmed everything with their guest ambassador, Kiani, that everything Steve ordered was all set for tonight. Once the sun set, Steve was ready for the night to start, room service should be arriving with their food soon. Tony, Peter and Joe were playing the Wii in the living room and Ulysses was down in the lobby. He had spotted a grand piano there and when he asked the staff if guests were allowed to play it and they said yes, he immediately leapt on the chance to play. Steve watched him play for a couple minutes, he was still amazed at how skilled his son was with the piano. Gentle lilting melody or fast paced jazz tunes, any type of compositions Ulysses would play Steve enjoyed them all.
“Because if I show it to Steve, his pretty little blond head would explode. You’re more level-headed than he is.” Natasha admitted.
“Peter.”
All the Avengers assembled to the lobby where a panicked Bruce, looking green around the gills, and a horrified Thor who was failing miserably in calming his mate down, was pacing the lobby, babbling about how Aurora was taken from them and they had to call SHIELD and Heimdall to find her immediately.
“Ma was a nurse, you know. Sometimes we got patients in the middle of the night. Patients who couldn’t afford to go anywhere else, if you get what I mean.”
Tony moved to follow the med crew, but a sharp pain in his abdomen stopped him in his tracks. Tony hissed in pain, clutching at his stomach as the pain intensified. Natasha and Clint rushed to him, holding him up and he clutched at them.
JR: they’re protective to say the least
, like he was in the presence of a similar blue glow a long time ago, longer than he would be able to remember. The arc reactor hummed with energy, the chemical reactions happening within fueling the energy production, infinite and sustained. Right now, it only provided partial power to the factory, with the other half of the energy source a conventional fossil fuel powered plant. It made Tony’s skin itch just thinking about it.
“Speaking of special, I met this blonde bombshell tax attorney down at Starbucks this morning. I told her you the kahuna if she wants to have fun on this island.” Clint waggled his eyebrows outrageously and took out a slip of paper from the front pocket of his work shirt, “You want her number? I got right here.”
So here he was, two weeks later, finally gathering up the courage to venture up to the common room for breakfast with the Avengers. Steve was already at the stove, cooking a stack of pancakes. He smiled and nodded in greeting as he spotted Bucky entering the room.
In the earliest hours of the night, if he was alone or if the person he was having a one-night stand with was finally asleep, he would snuck out to the workshop where he would stay for the rest of the night leaving Pepper to deal with the enviable task of sending them packing, and pondered on the path he was taking. Dad’s untimely death and the distance between them meant that they never had a chance to have a serious conversation about the future of Stark Industries. How did he envision this company to be like in the future? Would Dad have been okay with the direction SI was going under Tony’s leadership? Tony had nothing to rely on but the anecdotes Obie would tell him about his father’s beliefs, his convictions. Tony might as well have learned about his own father from reading one of the many biographical books written on Howard Stark by some military historian.
“Mahalo, Joe.”
“Get some rest, Buttercup.”
“Oops. Busted.” Tony said lamely.
“When did this happen? Where was I during all of this?” Steve was trying hard not to raise his voice, but he was starting to get upset by Tony’s duplicity.
Tony smiled at him, “

The maintenance crew finally announced that the jet had finished refueling and the engine had passed inspection for the next leg of journey. The Avengers then proceeded to board the plane. Steve carrying Tony over his shoulder and Joe wrapped around his torso like a spider monkey. Peter carried his Papa’s art portfolio case that contained the shield, feeling proud that he was entrusted with such an important task. As they all piled in on to the jet, nobody seemed to be noticing that they were missing two of their family members. Both of whom were still held for questioning by the TSA.
“Are you aware of a city councilman named Alexander Pierce?” Bucky asked their newest interviewee, one Phil Coulson, one of the bartenders at Sarah’s.
Tony rolled his eyes and lifting Ulysses up from his high chair and set him on his hips, “What are you, five? I’m not pregnant. And once I prove it to you losers, what am I gonna win?”
“Totally slipped by me, Stevie.”
Just as he was heading downstairs though, he heard Dr. Erskine asked Tony about his plans with the arc reactors he’s planning to build in Hawaii. Steve knew about Stark Industries’ clean and sustainable energy initiative, he read about it after Tony announced the shut down of the weapons manufacturing division of SI. What he didn’t know was that Tony had basically sidelined the whole project because his whole day was now preoccupied with making Steve fall in love with him. Unknowingly, Steve had ruined his life. Steve had stifled his potential, his ability to change the world, his power to create and change people’s lives for the better because of his condition. He had selfishly kept this amazing and incredible person away from having his most fulfilled life because of his condition.
“Have you guys thought of having a funeral?” Clint asked after everyone settled down in their spots.
“You should see the other guy.” Steve joked deprecatingly, his lips quirked up in a grin that Tony was helpless to reciprocate.
“Tasha, what’s awkward? You and Bucky trying to date? I told you so.”
The conversation came to a halt when Jarvis rushed over to them, a panicked and wild eyed expression on his face. He came to a stop in front of Tony, focused on his childhood friend slash boss as he said, “Look, I know whatever you’re discussing is very important right now,” then noticing someone from his periphery he turned around to see DJ Falcon on the center stage, “It’s-- Falcon! Falcon!” Jarvis’ voice pitch went higher, “Hey. What’s up?” as they bumped fists.
“Why didn’t you?” he asked, wiping the brownie crumbs away from the animal. It wouldn’t do any good if the walrus somehow got baked because of his brownie.
“Fine, Tony. But just one cup, and I’ll know if you try and sneak in another cup, JARVIS is monitoring your intake.”
It felt like Tony just closed his eyes when he heard the insistent pounding on the door that jarred him from his sleep. He felt Steve’s broad chest below him moved as he too was woken up by the nuisance that was the door.
Then he launched into a long winded explanation on his plans to ultimately make Hawai’i fossil fuel independent; how his company was working with the state government to invest more in solar panels and wind turbines and arc reactor technology (although he kinda glossed over that particular technology for a bit since that would totally give away his identity to Steve); how he wanted to set up a fellowship to incentivize more young Hawai’ians to study science and engineering and his recent endowment to UH to build a research institute for renewable energy and biomedical devices.
“Tony, stop trying to climb the stool, and just sit on the couch. You’re scaring me.” Steve chastised him, his hand was pressed to the small of Tony’s back helping him up to the stool.
“Sorry,” he said sheepishly, “that’s one of my bad traits. My brain works faster than my mouth, so I compensate with talking too much. And not letting anyone getting a word in.”
“Anthony, please don’t take my silence as rejection. I’m just trying to...to think of the best response to your proposal.” Steven finally said, his tone reassuring to the prince still in his arms. Anthony’s hands moved from its place around Steven’s neck to his chest. Steven’s words seemed to assuage him for the Prince’s face regained its mischievous countenance from previously. Anthony’s smile was so bright and infectious that Steven was helpless not to return it with a smile of his own.
“I can’t do this. I’m sorry, guys. I have to go…” Tony scrambled to sit up and left the booth. Throwing a couple of bills on the table enough to cover the tips and if Clint and Quill decided to stay longer. As he left, he managed to caught a snatch of the song’s last verse.
“Uncle Buck!”
And to tell Tony now, when they finally --
So they’re having another boy. Two boys that would further complete their family and their lives. The best of Tony and Steve, now there would be two of them.
“I heard Falcon shouting from all the way back from the coat check. He was pissed, lemme tell you.” Clint told them.
“Oh, I know Jamie. Good football player, but I don’t know if he’s good enough for you, Jujubee.” Ulysses looked pensive on the screen, while Joe just exasperatedly facepalmed as he felt a headache coming on.
Perplexed by the question, Tony answered hesitantly, “Uh yeah…”
The trip to the garage where Happy was waiting for them was full of panicked shouts and various Avengers rushing around like a chicken with its head cut off. Steve was carrying Tony to the car, with Bruce on their heels carrying their go-bag along with Natasha and Thor. happy was there waiting for them in one of Tony’s Rolls Royce, wringing his hands in nervousness.
“Yeah, right. And James’ left arm is flesh and blood.”
“So who do you want to arrest?” Bucky asked Sharon, who was surveying the whole scene with disapproval evident on her face.
Steve came in the room with Ulysses in his arms. He had took the baby back to the nursery to change his diaper. Ulysses look bright eyed and happy. His blue, blue eyes so much like Steve’s and the curious expression on his face as he scanned the room looking at his aunt and uncles. He lit up when he spotted Tony on the couch, letting out a cooing sound and reaching out his pudgy hands towards his father.
” Tony shot a warm smile at his youngest son, “
“No, you’re a Midgardian?” Thor answered, looking unsure at the complete non-sequitur Tony threw at him.
Steve was a gorgeous, handsome man who loves his family, and probably little kids and puppies too. And Tony met him in some out of the way diner because one of his cars just happen to break down near the diner Steve happen to frequent. If this wasn’t serendipity then Tony didn’t know the meaning of the word.
“With great power comes great responsibility,” Joe smiled sadly, repeating what Peter once told him as his reason for going out to patrol the neighborhood.
“Sure.” Steve agreed, “from the stories Ma would tell, he sounded like a hero. He wanted to serve his country. It was hard for Irish people back then, you know. It’s hard for him to get a job on account of being Irish, so he saw the army as a way to proof to society that he was more than a drunken Irish. Ma always said that Da had no patience for intolerant people and bigots. Ma said he once got in a fight with a diner owner who refused to serve Black customers. Needless to say both he and the people he stood up for was thrown out and banned from that diner for life.”
Last update for awhile. Imma go get high with my friends
That’s not to say that they never had problems. Tony still had years of trust issues to overcome. And for someone so seemingly over confident and self-assured in public, Tony was mired in insecurities and always felt inadequate, at times questioning whether Steve being with him was a good thing. Steve would always shoot down his self-doubts and his self-hate with assurances of unequivocal love, telling Tony that if not even death could separate them, then nothing would. And that Steve loved him not despite of his perceived weaknesses but with full awareness of it. It wasn’t as if Steve was perfect himself. He was stubborn as all get out, there were days when he would wake up and just hated everything in this new world. Hated how different it was from everything he knew back then. Hated how for this world to exist, the one he knew and grew up in had to be torn down and remade. And on those days, he was an asshole to everyone, even to the person he claimed to be his
Steve examined the baby in his arms with a solemn face, stroking the baby’s face, wiping away the mucus and afterbirth, before he put his mouth over the baby nose and mouth and inhaled over it. Steve spat out something Tony couldn’t see to the floor and lo and behold, their son took his first breath and started crying his lungs out. Everyone around them broke out in applause and cheering, it seemed that everyone was as invested in the labor as Tony and Steve was.
“Promise me, Tony. Promise me we’re not ever going to have anything to do with SeaWorld.” Steve impassionately told him, his fist still smarting from punching the coffee table, splitting it right down the middle. The boys were sleeping peacefully on his lap, undisturbed by the amount of crying and painful moaning their uncles were exhibiting.
“At once, Sir.”
“That’s a pretty good. How did you get so smart, Rogers?”
high blood pressure. I don’t!” Tony insisted.
“They never get anything right.” Sharon remarked, placing her hands on her hips.
“Better?”
“Steve, oh my God! Are you okay?” Tony started fussing over him, touching him to make sure he was okay.
“Spoke to Sue yesterday. She said you’re heading back to New York today.” Joe explained.
“Blackfish.” Bruce answered from his position on the loveseat, sitting next to Thor.
The boys followed Tony around the house like a newly imprinted baby duckling for a couple of days, skipping school to stay at home and wait on Tony hand and foot. It was cute until they wanted to come to the hospital for Tony’s dilatation which was when Tony put his foot down and sent them to school instead. The boys couldn’t afford to miss anymore classes no matter how smart they think they were and Tony didn’t need an entourage to escort him to the hospital.
“Look I’ve been here before. Okay? The place becomes a gang hangout. East Coast meets West Coast. Somebody gets popped.”
“He can be petty AF and holds grudges,” Peter dismissed it, “He still harps on Uly for breaking his homemade telescope, and that happened twelve years ago.”
Pierce was silent for a moment, as if contemplating something. It was a while before he finally spoke again, “Everyone serves somebody. Something your-- your mate refuses to accept.”
Tony walked to the kitchen to retrieve some dried fruit for Ulysses and himself. He heard voices from the living room, those of Steve’s and Thor’s. Looked like the Asgardian’s back from his lunch date with Jane.
“Yeah, I know.” Tony coughed into his fist to hide his embarrassment. His left hand still in Steve’s hold, “I love you too.” he said quietly.
“This double date is going to end in tears. And at this point it’s a toss up as to where the tears would be coming from,” Tony told him, deft hands fastening a blue tie decorated with white stars around his neck, “most likely from Thor. But it could be coming from me too. I’m still hormonal from the birth two months ago. And I’m still shedding uterine walls as we speak. Really, really unfit for polite society. I really should stay home, don’t you think so?”
“Tony, dude. You dropped your coffee.” Clint said, gesturing at the floor. But Tony remained motionless, and upon closer inspection his face was white as sheet. His brown eyes were open wide, but unseeing. It’s as if he was seeing something that only Tony could see. The hand that was still holding the StarkPad was trembling minutely and cold sweat started to appear at his temple.
But tonight, the river bank was populated with people. The Avengers pack stood on the banks of the Hudson River, all dressed in funeral garb, facing a small viking-style boat carrying a small mason jar filled with the placenta and fetus Tony carried not even 12 weeks ago. The boat also carried in it flowers and unlit tealight candles.
“Please. He cheats at poker more than any one of us ever do in a single game.”
“Consider it done, Sir.”
They found Peter lying in a pool of his own blood. Joe scrambling frantically to his little brother’s side, his blood ran cold and his heart seemed to be beating at a thousand beats per minute with how scared he was for him.
“Somebody turned off the security cameras.” Sharon announced to the gathering of employees.
That evening, the rest of the pack returned from their respective trips and Steve and Tony sat them down for a family meeting and told them all what happened. Hugs and consolations were exchanged and Sam brought out their whole catalog of ice creams and the Avengers proceeded to have an ice cream party, while watching Star Wars Episode IV.
“I have instructed an intern to run to the pharmacy and fetch some home pregnancy testing kits for you, Sir.”
“Just because I’m shorter than you doesn’t mean I’m little,” Peter protested.
“Why would a crooked politician tell you his grudges?” Sharon asked.
“Consider me your top suspect,” Chef Maria Hill said confidently to the two detectives currently interviewing her in the interrogation room.
“Sweetheart, stop. I wanna come with you inside me,” Tony whispered, his voice sounded hoarse and wrecked. All that gasping and moaning Steve elicited from him was wreaking havoc on his vocal chords.
In line behind her, Tony sighed longsufferingly. Peter fidgeted behind him, impatient because he had to pee and he didn’t listen to Tony telling him to go on the plane before they landed.
“Uh, JARVIS, is there any structural integrity issues that I’m unaware of? That occured overnight?”
“And if you have good taste, you will book me first. And then after that, each one of my proteges. You dig?” he addressed Tony.
Tony looked at him exasperatedly as if to say, “Really, Steve? That’s all you could say?”
Steve wouldn’t have agreed with arms proliferation. He would have backed Tony’s agenda and not pushed him aside like Obie did. A soldier he might be, but he didn’t seem to be the type of man who would go out looking for a fight.
“Sorry, Papa. We got carried away,” Joe apologized. His sharp blue eyes taking in the peculiar fact that Tony was in bed in the middle of the day and not working in the workshop. It was odd to say the least. He exchanged a bewildered look with Peter, clearly his little brother also came to the same conclusion he did.
“What? That Alpha fine, okay. But my devotion for Tony Stark and my disdain for infidelity wouldn’t let me do it.”
“What’s going on?” Tony asked, wide eyed and bewildered.
“I know! What if you and Tony join us? A double date of sorts. That way, Jane won’t pick a fight with me. Plus, when’s the last time you and Tony go out on a date? He’s been cooped up here since Young Joseph’s birth, I’m sure he would appreciate a night out on the town.”
“Hey,” Tony softly stroked his cheekbone, “don’t you be thinking that you’re being a burden on us. We’re a family, Steve, a team. And we support each other, no matter what. You won’t think I was a burden if I were the one who was hurt, would you?”
They walked towards the far side of the open floor art studio towards a door that Steve opened to reveal a large room with ample natural light filtering through, perfect for an art studio.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ooooohhh.” Clint intoned and winced at what Steve just said.
“But I don’t
It was Bruce. Of course, it was Bruce. He was the only one, other than Steve, who could handle his eccentricities and his outlandish behavior when something bad occurred.
Steve needs to wake up. They are so close to starting something together. Something wonderful, and something bigger than themselves. As Tony sees it, they are the pin that brings the Avengers together. The way they seamlessly worked together during the invasion of Manhattan, despite never working together before, is more than enough evidence to know that they could be great together. He and Steve are the key. Tony has opened himself up to Steve, makes himself vulnerable as they gradually build their friendship, this friendship that is slowly morphing into love. All he needs is for Steve to wake up.
Well, that-- that was not what Steve expected.
“Where is he, Tony? This time you can’t stop me from beating him within an inch of his life. Hell, I’ll get Clint and Sam help me. They will ask no questions.”
As the movie was played on one of the channels that still allow commercials, they had to suffer through ads every twenty minutes. Which prompted the Avengers to start pelting the TV with popcorn anytime a commercial was aired. Honestly, they were more like a bunch of toddlers than superheroes, Steve thought ruefully. He would die for them and wouldn’t trade them for the world, though.
Unlike other school children who went to DC as part of the school trip, his unusual childhood and schooling ensured that Tony never got to have that experience. When children his age get to have fun on school trips, Tony was already shipped to boarding school, trying and failing to make friends with peers that shunned him for his intelligence and looked down on his gender. On the occasions that he visited DC for Senate testimonies and that one time he and Rhodey got honored by Senator Assclown, he didn’t find the time to take in the many monuments gracing DC’s facade. Might be hard to believe for an American, but this was the first time he stepped foot in one of the Nation’s most revered dedication sites. The Lincoln Memorial was spacious inside and built in the Greek doric temple style. In the evening, the yellow light illuminating Lincoln’s statue in the main chamber added to the gravity and majesty of it, making the figure more imposing and lifelike. Murals were painted on the adjoining chambers that were separated from the main chamber by Ionic columns. In the north chamber, Tony saw a carved inscription of Lincoln’s second inaugural address, and in the south chamber the Gettysburg address was carved in to the marble wall.
They stood on opposite sides of the shed where they burned the journal entries. The Hawaiian weather was, for once, indicative of their state of minds as it has been raining buckets the entire afternoon. How apt, Tony thought. Nature was mourning the sad state of my life with me.
“Ugh, put it through, J. Just get this over with.” Tony rolled over to his back, showing his adorable face scrunched up in annoyance to Steve, which he was powerless to resist bestowing a light smooch on his lips. “Mmm, morning handsome,” Tony hummed.
“Um, you know-- it’s an endearment. You know, people use endearments to people they...love.” Anthony’s blush was fetching and Steven vowed he would dedicate each day of his life to elicit that blush on his face.
“No, Babbo. There was no trace of radioactivity in Peter’s bloodstream. We checked already. His DNA, however, was altered. There were some sequences in there that don’t align with the human genome but align with the arachnid genome.” Joe explained, “Also, some of the biomarkers on Peter’s blood match the superserum in Papa’s blood. Which makes sense since Peter now has enhanced strength, senses and also healing.”
Jamie shrugged, “Just wanted a change in scenery. I was talking to Peter earlier in the hallways, and he told me something interesting, something that I very much want to pursue now.” Jamie’s violet eyes twinkled mischievously under the bright fluorescent lights of the cafeteria, locking with his own glacier blue eyes. His charming smile directed at Joe, and he realized that all this time he had been missing out on the full effect of what that smile would make him feel.
“He said that Bucky works for him too.” And Tony knew his mate well, so he knew that Steve would be mad, to say the least. Honestly, the Audi getting away with a dented steering wheel was good enough in Tony’s books.
. And today as he reread
Tony grinned triumphantly. Yes! One more thing he succeeded, one more invention started by Howard that he finished! Suck on that, Dad!
“Babbo, is the new baby gonna be a boy baby or a girl baby?” it was breakfast time at the Tower. Tony was making the usual blueberry waffles for Ulysses and Joe, when Ulysses asked his question. Ulysses had been ecstatic to have another sibling, telling everyone all the games that he and Joe could teach the new baby when they arrived.
“No, Tony. That’s what you want to believe. It’s what we all want to believe,” Dr. Erskine gestured to himself, Joe and Bucky, “but it’s never gonna happen.”
“What did you eat, sweetheart?”
Steve chuckled nervously, his eyes flickered around the room as he took a deep breath to say what he needed to say next, “No, I’m nervous because...because I’ve come here to break up with you.”
“JARVIS, who’s up?” Tony asked.
“Me? I’m just the messenger.” Pierce said. Steve scoffed at the obvious ploy to lowball himself, “I don’t know how you got Bucky to believe that crap, but I know you’re nobody’s messenger.”
JW: glad it worked out. I was so worried
Tony averted his eyes and started looking shifty like Peter did when he tried to keep a duck he found in Central Park as a pet and would have gotten away with it if the duck hadn’t laid eggs in Sam’s underwear drawers.
He had just texted Joe that he was on his way home when he heard the scream. In an instant, Peter shot his web to the nearest building, swinging his way to the direction of the scream, arriving just in time to witness a mugging in progress. The would be mugging victim, a blonde lady in scrubs clutched at her purse and stared defiantly at the mugger. Peter inwardly slow-clapped and saluted the lady for not showing an ounce of fear in the midst of a harrowing situation.
“I got a meeting with an angry gangbanger in the alley. Why?”
“How’d you convince the Crew to come back and play tonight? I thought they were on tour until next year.” Tony chuckled at his mate.
In hindsight, Peter should have known that his sudden reversal of myopia, super strength and huge increase in appetite was a harbinger of something more to come. Now, he discovered the hard way that he could stick to things. Walls, floors, ceiling and on one momentous occasion, the side of Avengers Tower. Additionally, he now had something resembling a sixth sense, except he couldn’t see dead people, just that he had a feeling whenever something bad would happen. On more than one occasion he knew something bad was going to happen even before the Avengers alarm sounded off.
No, nevermind. Natasha scared him, he’s not gonna do anything to her.
“I love you. I love you so much. Thank you, Tony. Thank you for making my dreams come true.”
Which didn’t explain why fifteen minutes later, he was playing the CD on blast, chugging champagne straight from the bottle, singing and crying to Wouldn’t it be nice.
Tony seemed to take it all in stride. In a complete reversal to what occurred when Tony was pregnant with Joe, Steve was the one on bedrest now while Tony was allowed to work and go about his days as usual. Other than the miscarriage scare at the beginning of the pregnancy, everything was going swimmingly with the third (and
“Indeed,” Thor sighed again, eyes trained religiously up at the gym’s ceiling. Tony shot Steve a beseeching look telling him to say something to Thor because Tony was emotionally stunted and all of his words of wisdom was exhausted from speaking to Thor. Steve cleared his throat awkwardly, “It’s probably for the best, right, Thor?”
“Tony? Sweetheart, I’m home,” Steve started walking to the living room, calling out to the seemingly empty mansion, “Sorry, I was a bit late. The STRIKE team had a bit of a confusion when I told them to drop me off in Malibu, I didn’t mean for them to literally to drop me off the plane above Malibu, but here we are. Where is he, JARVIS?”
Ulysses finally let go of Tony after a couple of minutes, his eyes started to get the hooded look that signified he was sleepy. Tony smiled down at his son, he looked so cute. So far, Ulysses seemed to be taking after Steve more than him, with the blue eyes, his high brow and the sharp nose. Tony’s main contribution at this point seemed to be his dark, fluffy hair, a contrast to Steve’s blonde hair. “Looks like he’s getting sleepy.” Tony held him up for Steve to pat his back. He readily positioned Ulysses over the towel and gently patted his back until they heard a gentle burping sound.
“What part of skip ahead do you not understand, Barton?” Tony asked him.
Movie night has since become a tradition in their household. Sometimes they gathered and watched a movie, and there were times where they just gathered in the penthouse’s living room and hang out, catching up and joking with each other. That night was one of the nights where they were gathered together, no specific movie in mind that they intended to watch. But then as Bruce was flicking the channel, he stumbled on a channel playing
“How’s my head looking, Doc?” Tony asked, “Am I gonna have any short term memory problems?” The doctor peered closely at Tony’s face. He took out a penlight and told Tony to follow its movement with his eyes.
Tony grinned. Maybe this time they’d finally get a girl.
“You’re part spider now?” Jamie repeated warily.
“Excuse me Sharon, but this napkin proves that Rumlow was sent to hurt my mate.” Steve interjected strongly, moving forward as if to shield Tony from Sharon’s accusations.
The older boy seemed to accept this and grinned at Tony. The girl, holding her youngest brother’s hand, looked at Tony as if he was their saving grace.
“Really, Nat?” Tony sighed, putting Ulysses in his high chair next to her.
“You got one. Without me,” Steve remarked disappointingly. His father looked down at the pineapple in his hand.
“Much.” Steve tentatively moved back towards Tony, reaching his hand out for Tony to grasp. Tony did, and they settled back down to their previous position. In this dim light, it was easy to think that they were the only two people in this world.
“It really
Jamie’s brow furrowed in confusion when he heard his name came out of Spiderman’s mouth, “Wait, Spiderman? How do you know my name?”
“Tony. I want to show you something. Will you come with me?” Steve gestured at Tony to follow him.
“I’m afraid your bar will remain closed for the foreseeable future, Mr. Stark,” Sharon informed the man as they walked out of the archive room towards her office.
“Well, aliens invade the city on a daily basis so I guess you being sorta kinda part spider isn’t that weird.” Jamie shrugged.
Steve sighed, “Great. Just when I thought we could keep our hands clean…” the cost of doing business in New York was starting to be more than Steve was willing to bear. Maybe Tony had the right idea about moving West.
By the time Tony sent the fabrication command to JARVIS and Steve and Bruce cooked all of the bacon, Clint and Thor managed to drag themselves out of their quarters and joined the rest of them for breakfast.
“Wha--”
Steve reached their bedroom, bypassing the mattress and going straight to their ensuite bathroom so they could start cleaning up. Steve turned on the faucets on their ridiculously large bathtub, filling it with warm water for Tony to soak in.
“Oh my God, are you actually giving birth here? In the lobby? Little James, don’t look,” Barnes asked, horrified, placing his hand over Ulysses’ eyes to cover it.
“So what was he doing at our place?” Steve questioned the detectives.
“Yeah…” Steve whispered reverently, “you feel so good on my fingers, baby. So hot and slick, so eager for me.” Steve angled his fingers, looking for that spot he knew will bring Tony more pleasure. He found it and started insistently prodding it, Tony’s hole immediately started spasming and tightening at his fingers.
“I will fix up that eyesore of a motorcycle you love so much and I’ll give up trying to make you buy tight jeans. And no more giant stuffed animals randomly showing up at your studio.” Tony said, referring to the last time he gave Steve a giant teddy bear with a heart shaped pillow.  “What do I get then if I win?”
“Thank you, Tony. But I’m not hungry,” the God of Thunder answered him. He shot Tony and Steve a small muted smile.
The man seemed taken aback. He looked down at himself, his
Tony smiled softly at him and pressed another kiss to his lips, “I know.”
in Maui and everyone you know and presumably, love, are here. ”
“So that’s where the smell of grease and motor oil was coming from,” Steve teased.
“I decided to douse it with pure grain alcohol and burn it.” Coulson explained to him.
The old adage was that “parents are always right”, but Peter wasn’t gonna give Babbo the satisfaction of saying “I told you so!”. It was enough that by being a genius, Babbo was right about things 90% of the time (Peter and Joe did the math on one boring afternoon. Papa was right about 92% of the time), if Peter told him he was right about the Oscorp field trip, he would be insufferable, saying things like “this is why you should always listen to your Babbo”, or “Babbo knows best”, nevermind the fact that he and Papa actively encouraged them to always think critically. Peter surmised that nobody was immune from paradoxes for a reason.
“Well if it makes you feel better, I think the only reason I figured you out is because you squeaked out my name last night. Just be careful not to do that with anyone else though,” Jamie chuckled at Peter.
“Oh, uh,” Thor stammered, eyes widening imperceptibly, “I thought you’d be having lunch with Steve today. Like you always do,” he said charmingly.
They had been going to the lobby from their room, taking the elevator and apparently arguing about how Bruce thought Thor enjoyed the Big Guy’s company better than his own, which devolved to Bruce saying Thor was more attracted to the Big Guy than to him, at which point they stepped out of the elevator, leaving behind their baby, still in her stroller, at the elevator.
“From midnight until 4 AM, I was in my office.” Tony talked slowly, like he was explaining something to a small child. “Then I went home.
“Yeah. I drew it.” Natasha said, “for the murder victim last night.”
“We’re going up there this weekend to ground you, so be ready,” Tony said to his oldest son, his tone grouchy but the smile on his face belied that.
“So, we’re definitely pregnant, then?”
“Your office is marked.” Bucky remarked.
“I’m telling you, Steve, this is a bad idea,” Tony said for the thousandth time after they retreated to their rooms to get ready for their double date that night. Tony emerged from their walk-in closet that Steve still insisted was a sitting room (it had a couch and a window, the definition fit alright), wearing a blue jacket and maroon pants, his hair styled expertly and looking all kinds of delectable. If the night ended in disaster, at the very least Steve got to see Tony all spruced up for the first time in four months. That was enough to make up for the inevitable disaster of the night.
Tony rolled his eyes so hard he’s surprised his orbital muscles weren’t sprained.
Steve placed a plate filled with eggs, bacon and pancakes in front of Tony, “Eat, Tony. Your last meal was at lunch yesterday.”
“Don’t worry, Tones, we’ll get you another one.” Clint chimed in from the floor.
“Ain’t no way you’re over a hundred years old, buddy. You don’t look a day over forty.”
“Hmm,” Steve rubbed his chin in contemplation, “I’m not sure how I feel about that.”
“Oh. So, we having some doubts?” Steve asked, sounding a little hesitant and timid to Tony’s ears. And if there’s anything Tony couldn’t stand, it’s Steve doubting Tony’s love or resolve for their bond. Tony walked over to where Steve was standing and took over the task of tying his tie around his neck.
“Like what? Alive and right in front of me?”
“Hi,” he softly said, Tony moved from his side of the bed to trap Steve under him. Steve’s mate still looks amazing even after a long night of work. Steve could see the signs of exhaustion on his face, the dark shadows under his eyes that he would get when working too hard.
They were gone in a flash, leaving their family behind for duty’s sake.
Anthony felt his eyes bulged out of his skull at the mention of the Gorgon Medusa. Like everyone else, he knew of her and what she was capable of. He knew that no one had ever survive an encounter with the monster since they would be petrified the moment they gazed into her eyes, and yet Steven, Steven managed to kill her. Just how strong was this man? Anthony was in awe of Steven’s courage, “You slayed the Gorgon Medusa?”
,” Natasha teased him. Tony rolled his eyes at the words. He wasn’t responsible for the words that came out of his mouth sometimes. It just happened, like word vomit.
with. Pepper wouldn’t understand, she’s a civilian and anyway, she has more than enough on her plate. She was now CEO of Stark Industries and she and Happy had just started dating. Pepper’s life was finally not one giant circus-show courtesy of Tony and Tony wasn’t about to rain on her parade by talking to her about his stupid problems.
“No, you intimidate them.” the soldier driving the vehicle answered his question. And she was a woman. Kudos to her, being stationed in a battle zone.
They sat in silence then. Clint having finished his cereal was now dozing on the couch, and Tony drinking his coffee while fiddling with the StarkPad he brought from the workshop to catch up on some emails from R&D and Pepper. The anchor on the television was talking about how the Vice President has met with front runners to fill the Supreme Court vacancy. The screen then changed to display the pictures of the nominees: one female judge and two male judges.
“I can’t believe you just quoted Frozen.” Clint said. He sounded annoyed, but the mirth in his eyes were back, so Tony counted that as a win.
“Uh, hello?” Ulysses said once more from the telephone, “Can we address the other elephant in the room here? You know the part about Joe having a boyfriend. Who is he and when do we get to intimidate him?” Ulysses grabbed their attention again from the video call.
“You’re not gonna tell anyone, are you?” Peter looked at him with such a hangdog expression that Jamie was helpless not to assure and comfort the younger boy.
They bought another television to install in the bedroom, and somehow Steve and Tony’s bedroom now became the common room during the daytime. All of the Avengers seemed to gravitate towards their bedroom when they didn’t have any prior engagements, or out on a mission. They would take turns accompanying Tony, especially if Steve had to head upstate for some urgent business at the headquarters.
“It wasn’t real, Steve.” Tony tells him, reassuringly, not knowing what Steve is referring to.
Steve smiled at Tony indulgently, “Kids are growin’ up, Tony. They can take care of themselves. God forbid they start keeping track of their stuff by themselves,”
“I love you,” he told Tony, his hands cupping Tony’s neck, with his thumb gently caressing his cheek. Tony’s answering smile and the way he leaned in to Steve’s touch was gratifying in its own way and sent a swell of affection blooming in Steve’s chest.
“That would be a good idea. You can’t have a relationship without communication. Or maybe you can, if you’re one of those couples who thrive on dysfunction, or if you’re both mute. Nothing wrong with that, to each their own, you know?”
“What?!” Bucky and Ulysses yelped.
“Yes.” they immediately answered.
“Steve, what is all this?” Tony asked, wide eyed in astonishment at the set up in front of them. And there were their families. Clint was standing under the wooden gate, a lei around his neck and wearing a garish Hawaiian shirt of koi fishes and plumerias. Natasha was standing by the chairs, in a beautiful red sundress, her hair braided with fresh flowers, hand in hand with Bucky, who was also wearing a Hawaiian shirt and lei. Bruce and Thor stood on the other side of the aisle, across from Natasha and Bucky. Aurora in their arms, looking like the prettiest baby in the universe with her dress and the flowers in her hair. Sam and Rhodey (oh, my God Rhodey was here!) were also there with them, and completing the picture was Tony’s sons, Ulysses, Joe and Peter standing at the very end of the aisle, bright smiles on their faces and Joe carrying a bouquet of white peonies, pink roses and succulents, fidgeting exuberantly in his place.
Tony explained to him.
“Tony…”
“Stark not putting out?” Bucky offered.
“Dunno,” Joe shrugged, “He’s probably at a bookstore somewhere, buying more books and snacks.”
“Why isn’t he crying? Steve, Steve, why isn’t he crying?” Tony asked frantically. He tried to sit up, but was prevented from doing so by the pain in his abdomen. Steve tried to comfort him making hushing noises and he felt Natasha behind him, propping him up to see better.
Steve just hugged Tony closer to him, smiling in amusement and kissed his forehead softly. His family was crazy, but at the end of the day, it was his and he couldn’t wait for their family to grow bigger.
Steve didn’t shirk his fatherly duties, he would never do that. He still made Ulysses’ bottle, he still sang him to sleep most nights, but during the day he would mostly be downstairs with Barnes, reminiscing about the good old days. Whenever it was just the two of them downstairs, talking and Steve started to say “Remember when…” Tony immediately cut off the live feed, afraid of what he might see or hear. For some reason, it felt wrong to spy on that. Spying on Fury and Hill extract Intel from Barnes, that was no big deal. But watching Steve and his BFF talked about how the past was better was a line he wasn’t willing to cross.
“I asked you to marry me last night, and you said yes.”
“This says that your date of birth is April 26th nineteen seventeen.”
He slowly began to notice the presence of the other Avengers. His family had driven down to be with them, to offer their support. Ulysses was still in Bucky’s arms. His baby looked like he had been crying-- his face was red, eyes still watery and he was sniffing and hiccuping into Bucky’s shoulder.
“Hey, come here.” Steve pulled Tony aside by his waist, letting the hotel employees finish unloading their bags. They stood to the side, Steve rubbed his hands up and down Tony’s back in a comforting gesture and leaned his forehead close to Tony’s, “what’s the matter, huh? The kids are fine. Everyone’s fine. We turned around and got Bucky and Ulysses back.”
“Maybe a week, buddy. I’ll try to be back sooner, though. I’d miss you too much.” Steve knelt down and stroke his fingers through Ulysses’ messy brown curls.
“Take care,” they shook hands, and Steve lifted his hand up to his nose again and inhaled, “One for the road.”
“More like break your hand,” Tony grinned teasingly at him.
“Maybe he’s still in the middle of saving the day. Another cat was stuck up a tree or something. Or maybe she found another nice grandma to buy him a churro.” Jamie tried to reassure him. But Joe just had a hunch that it was none of those things.
“Bruce did.” Steve answered for him. Fury could only sigh exasperatedly, and hoped that the aneurysm he could feel building at the back of his head didn’t explode while he dealt with these idiots.
“Hey, you remembered when he was a baby and Steve was so into bonding and he wanted to do skin-on-skin contact with him, and Ulysses shit all over him?”
But before Steve could stand up from his seat to start looking for Tony, Bruce stopped him, “Steve, Steve, could you watch over Aurora please? I think I left my wallet at security. I’m gonna go there and check.”
“Of course. My apologies, Commander Rogers.” Steve conceded, a smile on his face indicating his amusement at his son’s antics. Tony laughed again at Ulysses’ self-proclamation as the leader.
After the fall of SHIELD, the superhero community, which was mostly the Avengers, had needed some good press to bolster its reputation, to make the people feel that the Avengers were there to protect them, have their best interests in mind and that the Avengers were the last line of defense between Earth and any intergalactic threats that has been proven to exist. So the Maria Stark Foundation, on behalf of Tony Stark, commissioned a sculpture piece of all the six original Avengers to be displayed in the lobby of the newly christened Avengers Tower.
“This song…” Tony sobbed, hiccuping once, “This one time this song came on the radio, and Steve started dancing…” he cried louder, “It was so bad...he looked like squiggly worm on a fishing hook.”
“Thank you, JARVIS.” Tony sighed in relief. He blinked his eyes again, adjusting to the dim lights JARVIS must have put on to alleviate Tony’s fear (no, not fear. Aversion) of the darkness. It was Winter in California, or whatever passed as Winter in a state like California, the skies were still dark outside, dark enough for Tony to make out some faint twinkles of the stars. Tony’s hand fell on the other side of the bed, untouched and tidy as the person who usually occupied it was away on a mission in South America.
The stress and turmoil of the day caught up with them. In the early hours of the morning, they finally went to bed. The large king-sized bed in their suite was wide and spacious, but neither of them were inclined to be separated from each other even by an inch. They lay down side by side, facing each other and keeping their eyes on the other. Steve stroke his hand down Tony’s side, ensuring himself that Tony’s here with him, he came back and they had another chance to be together and to build a life together. Tony looked pensive, eyes roaming around Steve’s face.
“Yum. Perfect. Cuisines from the Motherland. Gotta introduce it to ‘em young, am I right?” Tony sat on the counter with Joe in his lap.
“You’re pimping me out to tourists again, Clint?” Tony sighed, but reached out for the number anyway.
“JARVIS, safe and shut everything down.” he commanded the AI who promptly launched his command.
“Tasha,” he started again, “I promise you someday we’ll get that life. I won’t rest until we do.”
Tony gently placed his hand on his flat stomach, aware that the new baby was still a clump of rapidly dividing cells somewhere in his fallopian tube, yet he swore he could feel something changing within him. Something he felt when he was pregnant with the boys all those years ago.
“As long as he doesn’t get to name the baby, we’re good.”
“It’s Tony. I think he’s having a panic attack.”
“Hmm? About what?”
Steven cleared his throat before answering, “Anthony, it would be an honor and the greatest pleasure of my life to be your husband,” Anthony’s answering smile and the kiss he bestowed on Steven’s cheek indicated that Steven’s words were the right answer, “but we barely know each other. And while I find myself falling for you, don’t you think it’s for our benefit if we take the time to get to know each other?”
“Guys, guys, guys,” Tony held up his hand, trying to placate them, “I’m fine. Just a little bit of a scare back there. I’m okay, now. And yes, I’m pregnant. Again. And we didn’t tell you because we haven’t passed the first trimester yet, okay?”
Tony chuckled softly, “That’s not why.” and he left it at that for Steve to piece all the information together. There was a moment of silence where Tony lifted his head up from its place on Steve’s shoulder, gazing at his mate’s face. Steve looked flabbergasted, mouth gaping open, but his blue eyes were shining with happiness and elation.
“Well, uh,” Steve, God bless him, tried to come up with something to say, eyes flickering back and forth from Thor’s pleading face and Tony’s incredulous one, “have you considered that maybe the distance is what’s making you and Jane have problems?”
Adonis looked at the chains firmly binding Anthony to the rock, studying it. He took a step forward, putting his face closer to Anthony and this way he could see the lushness of the eyelashes framing his blue, blue eyes. Anthony was entranced, this man was unlike anyone he’d ever met before and that was a compliment. He smiled softly at Anthony and placed his big hands on the chains and said, “May I?”
“Yes, someone smashed the victim’s head against the wall. Knocked him out.” Jarvis replied absentmindedly. He was preoccupied with the numerous cables and plugs he needed to sort out for the stage. “And then came back, finished him off with a shot to the chest. Very cold blooded execution, that.” He turned to face Bruce. His friend’s mouth was gaping open, not unlike a goldfish as Jarvis recalled the information.
“That is a ridiculous urban legend.” Tony countered.
Tony grinned impishly and shot Rhodey a look that said “Told you so!” Rhodey sighed and shook his head. “You two dorks belong together.”
“Oh, Apollo. The Gods have different names that we use among each other than the ones they are known for to the mortals. A kind of nickname if you will.”
“There was so much blood, Steve.” Tony whispered hoarsely, “Why was there so much blood?”
Tony and Clint were at one of the bars that were already opened at the gate because it was 5 PM somewhere. Tony needed a drink after the debacle that was the Avengers trying to get through airport security. He was pretty sure there were phone cameras recording what happened and any moment now the Avengers would be trending on social media and Pepper would send him strongly worded messages about what happened. Awesome…
Silence.
“Anthony, listen to me. I want to, I really do. I just--” Steven sighed and ran a hand through his hair in frustration. How was he supposed to explain everything to Anthony? His whole life had been one bewilderment after another. Would Anthony still accept him if Steven told him everything? “I’m no royalty, Anthony. I’m the son of a fisherman from a small island
“Don’t be sorry. I like hearing you talk. It’s great to hear how passionate you are about educating the future generation. We need more people like you.” Steve beamed at him.
“That is one of our theories, yes.”
“Yeah.” Tony nodded, absently. Admittedly, he wasn’t expecting this. He knew of Steve’s faith but he wasn’t expecting Steve to be pro-choice. But hearing how the issue was perceived at the time Steve was growing up and who Steve had as a mother, it was not too surprising for him to be more understanding on the issue than most Alphas and Betas were. Tony should have known better, Steve lived to surprise him after all.
“Well yeah, but you’re you.”
producers come up with when high on DMT”, but watched and frequently snapchatted Tony’s lunches and dinners to his followers, much to Tony’s annoyance.
Sam let them go, but not without a look that promised Steve better come talk to him, if he needed to later.
Steve wryly shook his head at Tony’s antics. His love had an odd way of showing his affection that was for sure, but Steve couldn’t deny that he found it endearing. Tony showed his affections through his actions and through his words, rare as they were. One would need to read between the lines to decipher what he meant, but Steve never doubted the sincerity of his love and affection for Steve. Every time Tony looked at him or smiled at him, Steve could feel it as surely as he could feel the beat of his own heart.
In the dream, Tony saw himself at some kind of fair. People were milling about around him. It was night, but the fluorescent lights strewn about at the fair lend an artificial sense of brightness, obscuring the fact that the sun had set long ago. Tony was not alone in his dreams, there was another man walking next to him, they were talking and enjoying each other’s company. It was such a novelty for him because for once in his life, Tony was the one who towered over the man. His features were obscured in his dream, but Tony could see that the man wore a suit. It looked baggy on him since he was a skinny man, but for some reason it made him looked so precious in Tony’s eyes. In the back of his mind, Tony felt like he was abandoning his main purpose for being at this fair in the first place, but couldn’t find it in himself to care at all. He had never enjoyed another person’s company as much as he enjoyed this man’s, and that was something new for him.
“That’s the plan.” Steve smiled at Tony, relishing in how peaceful Tony looked with their newest son in his arms. He knew how scared Tony had been with this pregnancy, how much he blamed himself, irrationally so, for Joe being born premature and the spectre of health problems that followed the boy early on in his life. There were sleepless nights where he and Tony would stay awake in the nursery, gazing at their baby boy, relieved that he was here with them despite everything.
Steve, explained.
“Uh, okay. Are you all ready, sirs and madams?” the nervous photographer asked them.
“Of course you’re weird, Steve. Nobody in their right mind would have volunteered for human experimentation
“Because it would be the last time Ulysses would be spending his summer with us. After he’s off to college who knows if he would even have time to go back to New York.”
Sometimes, the choices that you make define the rest of your life. You might not know how or when the consequences of those choices appear, but they appear all the same. Of course, some decisions weigh more than others; some choices impact your life more than most. For example, if you choose to skip your usual morning coffee today because you were running late, it probably won’t impact what you do ten or twenty years from now. But if you choose not to drink coffee for the rest of your life, that might have a bigger impact on your kidney and heart function in the long term. Same goes for the matters of the heart. Some people say that “the heart wants what it wants.” But that particular epithet implied that you can’t help feeling a certain way for someone and takes all the personal responsibility for falling in love. It implies that you can’t help falling in love with someone.
“We can have that ‘discussion’” Tony used air quotes on the discussion, because it was more of an argument than anything else when they talked about it before, “some other time. Also, do you really want me to pick a fight about this?”
“This is awkward.” She declared as she closed the door behind her.
“Like Heaven.”
Again, silence answered him. Tony stared resolutely at the statue of a man so revered for leading his country through its greatest crisis, silently begging it for any form of reprieve.
Thor hemmed and hawed for a bit, but his decision was made for him when Steve dragged him up to his feet, slinging Thor’s beefy arm around his shoulders and dragged him out of the gym, Tony chattering to them endlessly about the new modifications to the Iron Man armor. Thor might have lost his girlfriend, but his family was still here and they would have his back no matter what.
“Did anybody touch it?” was the first words that came out of Fury’s mouth after he was summoned to look at the latest situation unfolding at Sarah’s.
Steve walked forward, pulled Tony to him and kissed the living daylights out of him. Tony gasped in surprise at the sudden kiss into his mouth before yielding sweetly to Steve’s questing mouth. Steve poured all the love and all the desperation he felt to keep Tony by his side into his kisses and into his touches.
Four days ago, he received a text from Steve. The text only said:
“Good.” Steve kissed him again, his lips firm and solid against Tony’s own. He slipped his hands around Tony’s waist and pulled him closer to his body. So close that Tony could feel the hard muscles of his torso and moaned at how good it felt to have his mate touching him again. It had been a hard couple of weeks not having Steve by his side when he went to bed. Finally, everything seemed to be going back to normal now. He got to have his mate back, he got to have his touches, kisses and caresses back.
“What?”
“God, he loved this song so much. His taste in music was so bad…” Tony reminisced, “so blue-collar…”
“From now on,” Nick increased his vocal volume to bring the cacophonous arguments to a stop, “none of you will answer questions you weren’t asked! Did I make myself clear enough for you motherfuckers?”
“You’re right, Steve. Jane never was fond of my attachments here with the Avengers. I don’t think she ever accepted my decision to move to New York to live with you all. She never understood that you are all my family, not just a group of people I fought with.”
Steve talked to him. A lot. He told him everything that happened ever since he woke up from the ice. How he felt overwhelmed by the changes and unfamiliar things that surround him on a daily basis, that he sometimes wished they never found him in the ice. Steve also told him that slowly things got better for him. He met and fought with Tony Stark (and that was anther doozy, Howard has a son...Bucky always thought Howard would be a forever bachelor, but then again what did he know) and was now bonded to him. They have a son together.
.” Tony pressed a chaste kiss to the corner of his lips, taking care not to disturb the graft on the other side, “I was so scared. When I saw on the gurney. I-- I’ve never seen you so still and silent before, Steve. I thought you’ve left me.”
“Hey guys,” Bruce greeted them, “guess they told you, huh?” he nodded towards Bucky and Sharon who was walking at the direction of the restrooms.
, his body had finished healing and he could go back to the Tower.
“I want to baptize Ulysses in the Catholic church.”
Since its reconstruction after the Chitauri invasion, Avengers Tower has become something of a tourist attraction. Anyone who came to New York City for a vacation would always stop by the tower and take pictures, whether it was the outside view or the lobby.
“So what are we gonna do, Cap?”
“I have no doubt about that.” Tony smiled softly in agreement, “Steve, I want to name our son after your father. I want to name him Joseph.”
“Mm-mm.” They shook their heads again.
“If anybody other than me ever say that to you, they’re getting their ass kicked.” Steve told him and Tony laughed heartily.
“Listen Tony, you take care of yourself, okay? We’ll miss you, even if James would deny it to kingdom come.” Joe shook his hand, grinning cheekily at Bucky’s direction.
“Oh my God,” Papa sat down heavily on the couch next to Joe, he looked dumbfounded by the onslaught of information he and Peter were spilling to him.
“Oh no, the video is wonderful. I love it.” Steve clarified, not wanting Tony to feel offended.  “It’s just that sometimes when I watched the video I feel like I’m being told about my life by someone else. But reading my journal...it feels like I’m telling myself the story.”
“Steve’s the best for you. But I’ll take second place gracefully.” Bruce smiled softly before he went to fetch said wheelchair.
“I don’t know why you kids make such a big deal about that. Isn’t it nice to have proof that your parents still love each other?” Thor asked, “Loki and I walked in on my parents lots of times. We were the better for it.”
“Yes! Yes, you won’t be disappointed.” Clint cheered and pointed at Tony, then rushed off to get ready for his audition.
“I read about what you did after you closed down the weapons manufacturing division. You’ve been doing so much good, Tony.” Steve cleared his throat, “My best friend, Bucky, came home from Iraq missing an arm. He was so despondent, I had to put him on suicide watch. But then he got a call from Stark Resilient, offering him to be part of the new clinical trial for a new prosthetic available for free for veterans. Without you, I would have a lost my best friend, Tony. That’s what you’ve done, Tony, to people you’ve never even met. ‘Anyone’ wouldn’t do just that.”
“How the fuck did this happen?!” Tony demanded for the thousandth time as they waited in the medical bay of the Avengers facility for Natasha, Clint and Steve to finally arrive. No one would tell him the extent of Steve’s injuries only that he was in need of emergency medical assistance, which was few and far in between for Steve. His accelerated healing meant that he rarely needed medical assistance, much less an emergency one. And Steve would always want to avoid a visit to Medical, preferring to let his body heal itself as opposed to letting people poke and prod him.
“Hi sweetheart,” he greeted, standing up to meet Tony, “how was the meeting?”
“Good morning,” a soft voice pierced through his morning haze.
, of being hurt by the person you love. Of suffering. And when it happens, it will affect you more than being hurt by a random person on the street, because you’re being hurt by the person who is at the center of your whole universe, the person you gave your whole being to.
Time flew by. When Tony blinked again, it was March 17th again, Saint Patrick’s Day and more importantly Ulysses’ first birthday. They had a simple celebration, just for the family, and Ulysses seemed to have fun, if the amount of green frosting that ended up on his face was any indication.
JR: incensed
Tony, sensing his mate’s presence, turned around and spotted Steve stocking the bar with a frown on his face. Ah, he must have seen Killian talking to Tony and was now sulking. Tony smiled softly, walking to the bar hoping his proximity would calm his mate a little. “Hey, Killian. How you doing?” Steve said.
“You have, actually, excellent bone structure, there. I'm kind of having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?” Tony angled for a joke, and it worked. The other soldiers started laughing and chuckling at his joke, “Come on, it's okay, laugh.”
Joe and Bucky could only stare in horrified silence at the sight of an unconscious man on Steve’s bedroom floor.
Joe thought absently.
“Well, I had a great time celebrating your birthday, Dad.” Steve hugged Joe, “happy birthday again, Dad. “Good night, Buck. See you guys in the morning.” He said as he climbed the stairs up to where his room was located.
Bruce came back a few minutes later, brandishing the wallet he thought he lost and thanking Steve for watching over his daughter. Joe and Peter came back with a bag of food, between them and sat next to Natasha who was reading a Vogue magazine. A few seats away, Thor was engaged in a rather heated debate with a teenage girl, trying to convince her that Harry Styles was the Justin Timberlake of One Direction, but the girl wasn’t buying it, insisting that it was Zayn instead and that Harry was the JC Chasez. It was only slightly ridiculous than the other debates Thor usually get himself into (re: the waffle fry v. french fry debate with Ulysses).
“Sweetheart, sweetheart, you’re rambling. Okay, let’s try this again. Tony?”
After settling Peter in his bedroom, dressing him up in one of his nerdy t-shirts and flannel pajama pants, they went out to the living room. Leaving Jamie in the living room, Joe excused himself for a bit to call Ulysses, updating his big brother on what just happened with Peter and bracing himself for the inevitable fallout and to persuade Ulysses not to panic drive to New York. To say Ulysses tended to overreact would be an understatement. And people said that Omegas were the hysterical ones.
“You mean a
“Never mind that, Tony. Is that a pregnancy test?”
He tried again the next day. But before he could even suggest to Tony that they spend the day together at the beach, Peter ran up to them telling them Ulysses was fighting with another boy who was harassing Joe. They managed to separate them but not before Ulysses got a pretty amazing shiner on his left eye. They ended up spending the rest of the day at the Maui Memorial’s emergency room and Tony spending the rest of the day and night fawning over his eldest son and threatening to sue the other boy and his parents for punching Ulysses and having an omega-to-omega talk with Joe who was rightfully feeling some discomfort for being treated like less than human for his secondary gender. Steve had half a mind of finding that boy and tossing him straight into the ocean. Nobody messed with his baby.
“Planning to storm Olympus and revolutionizing the system, General?”
“No!” Ulysses cheerfully answered before Bucky could say anything, prompting a loud burst of shocked laughter from Tony and snickers and chuckles from everyone else. Steve rubbed his forehead, feeling a headache coming in.
“Oh my God...such a fangirl.” Brianna shook her head exasperatedly.
“Good. Now come here, gimme a hug.” They all rushed to him, and Tony had his arms full with his niece and nephews. “Love you, guys.” he murmured, kissing their heads one by one.
“Not gonna disagree with that.” Tony said and picked up the chicken feet and started devouring it. After a moment, he felt Steve nudged his feet and tilted his head towards where Rhodey was slowly oscillating Ulysses’ bassinet back and forth to lull the baby to sleep. The couple exchanged few meaningful glances in silent communication before Tony cleared his throat to get Rhodey’s attention.
It probably said something about Steve that the only other time he felt alive in two years, aside from rediscovering Tony, was when he was fighting for his life against a horde of Loki’s alien army. Yes, there actually was an army from space. Turned out, Steve’s life could get weirder. Hey, if the love of his life could be reborn and they would meet again seventy years in the future after Steve just happened to be frozen in ice, then the appearance of an alien army in downtown Manhattan was just another day in the park.
They were still trying to figure out how Steve managed to break into a church and kidnapped all of them at the same time. Although ‘kidnap’ might be too strong a word, because Steve tricked them into boarding the shuttle by telling them they were going for brunch. The Avengers were suckers for brunches. They should have known it was a trap, Steve wouldn’t be going anywhere voluntarily without Tony anymore.
“I’m an Airman,” she said simply, brushing off his words.
“Oh, right. You’re the goddess of the hunt. Not much to hunt in this empty floating island here, huh?”
“Oh really?” Tony stopped, “I wish I could make it, but uh, yes I will be there.” Tony smiled charmingly, thrilled to be getting another chance to meet Steve.
“Awesome, it’s the Crew!” Thor exclaimed, contrasting Jarvis’ lamentation, “I’ve been banked by a rock band.”
Tony sighed, “That’s gonna hurt us financially.”
“Where are you? Are you at a frat party? You said you have midterms!” Tony demanded, squinting at the scenery behind his son.
“Okay, Tony. I’ll get you a wheelchair. And that’s non-negotiable, okay?”
“Handsome, war hero, living legend, and talented artist. If he wasn’t happily mated to Tony Stark, who is my role model and everything I want to be when I grow up, I would be offering myself up to him on a silver platter.”
“Okay, Tony. We’ll name him Joseph.” Steve choked up a little, “Thank you, Tony. I’ve never even thought about it. Mostly because I didn’t think we would even have a second chance at having a son.”
Tony mouthed at Steve. Steve surreptitiously shook his head.
Steve was in the hospital for three months. The whole time he was there, Joe and James had to watch the light drained away from Steve’s eyes when he realized that he would never have a normal life, as they tell them again and again what had happened to him. When they took him home, Joe came up with a crazy idea to let Steve believe that it was still Saturday three months ago. He enlisted James’ help to keep up the ruse, sequestering Steve away from his friends, his life before the accident, his students and anyone that wasn’t in Steve’s life on October 13th.
“Ugh, please stop eyefucking in front of the family. My eyes are too pure for that.” Clint whined as he walked to where they were all assembled in front of the fireplace.
Steve lived and thrived under their care despite his health troubles. He was small compared to his peers, and his ailments made him unable to be as carefree as a toddler should be. He stayed at home more than he ventured outside, and as a result he was exceptionally close to his parents. When his contract was almost up, Joe decided to asked for an extension so he could remain in the Marines. Steve may not be at death’s door, like he was a few years ago, but the Marine took care of their own and Steve’s medicines was one of the things they would take care.
But of course, when it came to his life after Steve nothing ever went according to plan. So there Tony was, in his workshop, trying to wrap his head around the fact that he was pregnant for the fourth time in his life and at such an old age too.
“Steve, honey, pudding plum, love of my life, what was that?” Tony asked, once Ulysses and Thor were out of earshot, referring to his ‘talk’ with Thor.
“Hey, Cap, Tony. Heard about Jarvis being arrested. Can my band audition?”
“Walked to Lincoln Memorial. Never been.” Tony tonelessly answered. His tone was flat, devoid of emotion.
“Of course, Steve. How could I not? Another kid for you and the team to spoil, a sibling for Ulysses and a chance for our family to grow bigger. This time, maybe they’d look like me. Also, you promised I get to name this one Citizen Kane
” Thor scooped Ulysses up in his arms as he stood up and headed to the elevator.
Steve dipped his head and pecked him softly on the lips, “I love you, Tony.”
Tony’s lips underneath his went slack and his hand stopped stroking Steve’s cock. Concerned, Steve opened his eyes to look down at his mate. Tony’s eyes were scrunched closed tightly, lips slightly open. He didn’t look like a man who was enjoying himself in bed with his Alpha. He look troubled.
This chapter is for everyone who have subscribed, commented, left kudos on this work. Thank you so much, everyone! You're the reason I keep writing even when I have zero work-life balance.
And for the second time in his life, Tony was rendered speechless. Steve’s studio was filled with hundreds of sketches of his likeness. There were black and white pencil and charcoal sketches of Tony in myriad of poses. There were watercolor portraits of him hanging on the wall, and on the lines running across the room, fastened there by clothespins, waiting to dry. He saw an unfinished oil painting of himself in profile displayed prominently in the center of the room where Steve had set up his easel. On the far side of a room was an unfinished bust that closely resembled him. “Wow…” Steve’s studio was in essence a shrine to Tony.
“Is he--” she couldn’t say the words, couldn’t even bring herself to think it.
“God,” Jamie rasped out from next to him, “Is he okay?”
“What?! I’ve never seen you before in my life! You’re lying!” Steve shouted back, hurling his bucket of paint brushes at the man.
“Don’t let her hear you say that.” Steve said in response.
“Peter, why do you have the Spiderman suit on? Please tell me that’s going to be your halloween costume and not what I think it is.” Babbo said faintly.
” Peter complained from his position glommed on to Tony’s back.
“Good, that’s good.” Steve said, relieved that he hasn’t done anything too damaging Tony’s person.
“Yes, nobody can see you, brother.” Natasha appeared next to Clint, her face impassive but her eyes betrayed her, “we have no idea what happened to you after you entered the cave.”
“But he-- he’s--” Tony felt a lump in his throat, there was something blocking his windpipe. He reached out to touch Steve’s intact hand, needing to ground himself with his mate’s touch, but the med crew stopped him.
Tony scooted closer to him, slotting his head in the space under Steve’s neck. Steve felt him sigh deeply and pressed a kiss to his collarbone.
Joe looked on curiously at the fish shaped cracker on his hand, then closed his fist around it and gleefully waved it around.
“And what do you propose we should spend the day doing then, hmm, without kids to run around after?” Tony asked him, shooting Steve what he hoped was a sultry smile.
“Oscorp?” Tony hissed in disgust, “
For awhile, Tony didn’t believe it either. His previous life was all about SI, parties and inventing new weaponry or equipments for SI’s bottom line. That shrapnel to the chest was a massive wake up call to him. It showed him just how he didn’t want his legacy to be. It showed him that he was meant more than creating something destructive. Though late, Tony did turn his life around. Then Steve and the Avengers entered his life, and any chances of him going back to his old life after these weird, loud, obnoxious but amazing people became his family became nonexistent.
“I’m mad because I don’t find it hard to believe at all. Alright? Did Pierce give you the napkin?” Steve countered.
“What?!” Jarvis turned around to face his friend. At the same time, Bruce turned around while holding the gun by the handle, “Oh, oh, oh! I’m English. We don’t use guns. We use our foreheads. What you’ve just picked up is most likely the murder weapon.”
“The dead guy-- chats me up last night.” he finally said. Steve furrowed his brow at Thor’s confession. “Okay...why didn’t you tell the police?”
Next hint that something was different was when he totally busted down his door just by trying to open in. Peter stared in disbelief at the door in his hand, which he was holding as if it weighed no more than a piece of paper instead of a reinforced wood and gingerly placed it on the side, propped up on the wall.
The driver then stepped out of the vehicle, weapons at the ready, only to be shot down the moment she stepped out of the vehicle. Tony jolted in his seat at the violent sight. That was the first time he ever witnessed death at such a close range. His heartbeat ratcheted up rapidly.
Steve quirked his brow, knowing his father was hinting at something else. They walked to the workshop together and the combination of the white walls and the fluorescent white lights Joe installed in the workshop made for one amazing headache.
“I’m saaadddd....” Tony pouted and nuzzled his face into Steve’s neck, “Uly’s leaving soon,”
Steve laughed with relief. He’s gonna be meeting this charmingly handsome man again tomorrow. And if Steve’s lucky maybe these breakfasts can turn into dinner dates.
“I ain’t going to prison.” Bucky said.
Peter had been Spiderman for a few months now, and honestly he was amazed by how well he had been keeping this secret. He tried to steer clear of the Avengers’ way, trying not to bring too much attention to himself. Although there was a few close calls when he was helping out the Avengers aka his parents and aunts and uncles, and he almost slipped by calling Captain America Papa and almost talked in Italian with Babbo.
“Why did you say that, Tony?” Steve fixed him with a piercing look, his blue eyes were a hurricane of emotions. Sadness, pain, grief, and dare Tony say hope, which confused him to no end, “Why?”
“Honest Abe, huh?” Tony stopped his wandering of the Memorial in front of the statue. Lincoln’s solemn face gave him no answer. “Have you really never told a lie? Not even a white lie? A lie of omission? Not even when comforting Mary Todd about the carriage accident that might have been an assassination plot on you? Even national icons lie, you know. Found that out pretty recently myself.”
Eight months in and thankfully the spherical object aversion was over. Tony moved past that phase of the pregnancy and moved into the weird food combination cravings. Clint dubbed Tony’s food pairings as “something that
The fact that Steve was a sickly child was widely known by his family. What they might not know was that he was an avid reader, because when stuck in bed for days on end reading and later drawing became Steve’s only reprieve from boredom. So he read voraciously. By the time he was twelve years old, he had read all of the books in the Brooklyn public library’s collection. Granted, it wasn’t that big of a collection in the first place, so sometimes Steve read the same books three or four times. He read biographies of presidents and world leaders, works of fictions, short stories, Shakespearean screenplays, works by Euripides, Sophocles, Homer, Virgil, Dante and others. Steve read a lot back then, and he continued that hobby even today.
“Sir, it is now six AM in the morning. You are currently in Malibu, California. The weather today is a balmy seventy-three degrees Fahrenheit and it is predicted to be a sunny day today.”
“Hey, guys,” Steve warmly greeted them, “thanks for coming.”
“In jail?” Steve was aware he sounded very done for, “What the fuck for?”
“What do you mean?”
“Stark Tower.”
To be perfectly frank, Tony had never cared much for Captain America. To him, he was just a figurehead. But Steve Rogers, him Tony idolized. His courage and bravery, his willingness to sacrifice his life for the greater good, Tony hoped he could be half as good as him when he grew up. This fixation with Steve Rogers wasn’t something he could explain. His bravery and his
“That was golden. Look at Stevie’s eyes!” Bucky grinned, looking at the picture he took of Steve and Ulysses. He tilted his phone to the side for Tony to see. Bucky managed to capture the moment Ulysses planted one on Steve, lips puckering up cutely and Steve was wide eyed and surprised.
“Good luck, guys! We’ll come by later.” Bruce’s voice send them off as they drove away to the hospital.
“GPS puts you in this building at the time of the murder. Lose the weapon, Detective.” Sharon instructed. There was a tense moment in which nobody moved. Bucky shook his head slightly in disagreement.
JR: but peter worked his magic puppy dog eyes at them and they melted like brown butter
“Okay.” he simply said.
“It’s not your fault, you know,” Tony started, “it’s nobody’s fault but whoever detonated the bomb. Steve wouldn’t want you to blame yourselves. Let it go.”
“I got it, sweetheart,” Steve knelt in front of him, gently rubbing his hands up and down Tony’s arms in an attempt to comfort him, “I’ll help you clean up. I’ve run a warm bath for you. Why don’t you hop in while I clean everything up, okay?”
Because Jamie had no doubt who was behind that mask. And he was going to confront him tomorrow at school. Peter Rogers had some explaining to do.
Peaceful mornings like these were what Steve lived for, what he fought for. These peaceful, serene moments with his family, just enjoying their presence and how these moments complete him. He had his mate sitting next to him, eating the food he made for them, his son was happy and would grow up feeling loved and knowing that there would always be people who protected him, had his back and supported him no matter what. Steve’s life was pretty much perfect at this point.
“Steve? Babe, what’s going on? Are you okay?” Tony must have noticed his presence and seen how he was gaping like a fish out of water at the corner of his workshop. Tony tentatively took  a step towards him, unsure if his touch was welcomed and Steve-- Steve couldn’t stand the thought of Tony thinking Steve would ever deny him his touches.
At the mention of a ring, Tony’s heart jolted painfully. What would Steve do or say if he knew that Tony already have such a ring completed and ready for him? Would Steve just threw it back at his face, breaking his heart and ruining their chance for happiness together, like what he’s doing now?
“Speaking of life-saving and secrets…”Jamie glanced discreetly at Peter who was gesticulating wildly at Ned and Aaron, “I found out last night that the apple doesn’t fall far from the Superhuman trees.”
“What!” Jamie could feel the back of his neck starting to heat up, “lead with that, you asshole! Is he-- is he still looking this way? Yeah, the Sabbath shirt looks good on him, but I kinda like the Tool shirts better.” Jamie rubbed the back of his neck subconsciously, his eyes taking on that dreamy look on them again.
And Tony wasn’t about to ruin it with a sob story about how he wasn’t able to sleep because had a nightmare. Or nightmares and panic attacks, to be exact. He’s not going to be the one who destroyed Steve’s happiness. He was going to be the one who guarded it.
------
Steve embraced him, letting Tony rest his weary head on his firm, comforting chest. “It’s okay. Like Dr. Rosenberg said, we caught it early. Now we know the risks and what to do to prevent it. And don’t tell me you’re not already working on an algorithm to allow JARVIS to constantly surveil the baby’s heart rate.”
“What do you mean?”
“He’s a leader of a gang. A gang that is known to kill people, and he hates your guts. I ain’t no mathematician but that adds up bad.”
Tony shrugged. “That’s why I fell for him. But rewind that, why would his head explode?”
“It has come to our attention that Peter is apparently Spiderman and Joe has a boyfriend.” Steve told his oldest son, watching him closely for his reaction and he did not disappoint.
Next, he turned his attention to the arc reactor project. Truthfully it’s been awhile since he was able to buckled down and really work on a solution for the melting core problems. His brief conversation with Bucky this morning sparked an Einstein a-ha moment that he now would like to test. With JARVIS’ help, he set out to create a simulation using the holographics deck of the current input, projected outputs and the efficiency of the current palladium core of the existing arc reactors. As always, when he fast forward the simulation, the same problem emerged with the depleted core and melted neutrino casing.
Steve quirked his lips slightly at the compliment as if just discovering that Tony was just as amusing as he’d seemed in the video. He stepped inside the workshop and looked around. Right, Tony thought, he was seeing it for the first time again. “Wow, Tony. These all look amazing. These holographs are so neat!”
------
Steve finished adding finishing touches on the mural of the New York City skyline he painted in his Dad’s garage. He stepped back to gaze upon his artwork. It took him six months to complete this mural, not because he was uninspired or have no time. He just kept forgetting that he was supposed to be painting it. At least it didn’t took him four years to complete this painting, like that Lithuanian psychiatrist whose the namesake of Steve’s condition. He was glad to finally complete this piece. He meant it as a farewell gift to his father and Bucky. Steve had decided that he would move out the house and live at the Institute for Traumatic Brain Injury instead. It was high time he did this.
“It’s evil.”
Tony grinned. Sometimes he thought JARVIS was all the company he needed in life.
Sharon cleared her throat, “have you witnessed any altercations, any differences in opinion in the bar lately?”
“Yeah. There was some internal bleeding, but thankfully the embryo survived.” Bruce sighed. He took of his glasses and rubbed his eyes, “Why didn’t you tell us?”
Now, though, everything was more streamlined. Steve was waiting with a towel draped over his shoulder, like a good Alpha should, ready to pat Ulysses’ back after he fed. Tony breastfeeding in the living room was a common occurrence that nobody took issue with. They understood that breastfeeding was a natural act, and that there was nothing wrong or weird with Tony doing it in the common room.
“Morning, family. Studmuffin here will be joining us for breakfast this morning.” he announced to the room. Rhodes just rolled his eyes at the nickname Stark threw at him and grabbed a plate to start piling up some pancakes and scrambled eggs in it.
“Man, I still can’t get over the fact that Thor feeds babies like a pro.” Sam remarked, his phone was up and pointing at the direction where Thor was gently bouncing Ulysses up and down as the baby sucked on the bottle. Tony’s pretty sure he was live streaming the whole thing.
“Tony? Baby, what is it?”
Bucky seemed placated with Bruce’s explanation. Tony kept his gaze trained on the operating room below them. The surgeons have started rolling out a sheet of clear membrane, almost like plastic, and wrapped them around Steve’s rehydrated torso. The blood and sinew that were covering Steve had been flushed away, leaving his flesh exposed to the environment. Someone had shaved his head, his intact blond hair on the other side of his head gone to match the other side where all the hair was burned off in the explosion. Tony watched as they slowly covered Steve’s body with the skin grafts. Little by little, Steve’s exposed flesh was covered by the graft. Tony didn’t know he was holding his breath as he watched the surgeons finalized the graft placement. Only when they declared that the graft has been absorbed and incorporated by the serum as part of foundation to reconstruct Steve’s new skin did they breathed a collective sigh of relief.
“Tony was the only one inside the club.” Steve said. The two Alphas then became silent as the meaning of their discussions and what it implied hit them. Thor stared steadily at his boss. He knew Steve was processing the facts and what he knew so far about the situation. In the army, Steve had gained a reputation of being a master tactician. His ability to formulate plans and strategies was second to none. Steve was a natural born leader, and Thor knew this when he first started working for Tony and Steve. As another Alpha, Thor also knew that the instinct to protect and keep one’s mate were ones that couldn’t be ignored. In Thor’s mind, everything seemed to suggest that Tony had done something with the guy and Steve had murdered the man for getting too close to or threatening Tony. Thor wouldn’t blame him, if he were put in the same position as Steve, he would probably do the same thing.
“Okay, here we are, Captain Rogers.” the doctor declared after he finished unwrapping all of the bandages that were covering Steve’s left eye. It had been the last thing to recover and regenerate after the blast that took out most of the skin on the left side of his body. It has been two months since the accident now, and finally,
(See the end of the chapter for
“Children.” Tony scoffed at their retreating backs.
Steve pressed a chaste kiss on Tony’s lips. “There’s nowhere else I’d rather be, Tony. If I have to go through everything again, I wouldn’t hesitate if I get to have you and our family in the end.”
Natasha just smiled sweetly and condescendingly at him.
“Ma’am, please empty everything out of your pockets,” the disgruntled TSA agent told Natasha through gritted teeth after the metal detector beeped for nth time.
Thor and Bruce lost Aurora. They fucking lost their baby. In a hotel.
“Very good.” Tony pinched his chubby cheek,  “And the first law of thermodynamics is basically a paraphrasing of what other law?”
Mission accomplished, Steve.
‘We’ve been over this, Nat.” Tony sighed, “It’s just easier on both parties if all we had was just some no-strings-attached fun. No fuss, no muss.” Tony got up and went over to where a prototype of the newest version of a dialysis machine that will revolutionize renal disease treatment was located. If he had to have this conversation again, might as well do it with his hands occupied with something.
“I didn’t catch him. But I appreciate your loyalty.” Steve answered firmly, though inside he was still reeling at the realization that Thor thought he murdered the guy and was willing to cover it up for him.
“What did you just say? You better not be talking shit about me to the kid, Tony!”
Joe laughed at their banter. If this was what the rest of high school, and dare he say, life would be, Joe was more than happy to live with it.
“Hey, guys!” Clint greeted the audience, which consisted of him and Steve along with the other bar employees and some patrons who had a firmly held belief of it being 5 PM somewhere.
“What’s up?”
“Dionysius?”
“Can’t wait to hear what that would be,” Tony muttered, crossing his arms in front of his chest.
“We’re supposed to go out for dinner tonight. I’ve made reservations and everything, but just the thought of spending another two or more hours with her fill me with dread.” Thor said again, his voice deep and gravelly with exhaustion. Then he looked at Steve and his blue eyes lit up. Steve felt his hackles rose because the last time Thor looked like that he managed to successfully convinced Tony to let Thor electrocute him to “test” the arc reactor’s capabilities of incorporating Thor’s thunder as an energy source. Tony chose that moment to walk into the living room with Ulysses in his arms.
The next day, Tony and Steve went down to the gym for a sparring session only to find Thor in lying down on the bench under the heaviest set of weight, looking as miserable as a kicked puppy.
“Tony! I was just telling Steve that we should have a double date tonight. What say you? A night out on the town, make the others babysit for you. You and Steve in your best suits, showing the world what a good-looking couple you both are.”
“Hey that statue is a work of art,” Clint insisted, pointing his finger at his sister in emphasis.
“Working on that, Barnes. The problem isn’t just the hardware, it’s also the chemical reaction produced by the core that caused the heat exchanges melting the casing. I’m trying to find elemental substitute to the Palladium core we’ve been using. Tried every combination and every permutation of all the elements on the Periodic Table and nothing works so far.” Tony finished. His mind wandered, maybe the key wasn’t nuclear fission of radioactive element. Tony had been thinking of playing around with the possibility of mimicking nuclear fusion in the reactor. Would he get better efficiency harvesting the energy produced by slamming two elemental nuclei at really really high speed? Tony’s thinking maybe at speed approximating the speed of light  Hmm, finally a hypothesis worth testing.
“Oh honey,” Tony stroked his hair, “you have bad days, all of us do. Don’t blame yourself.”
“Sorry about that, brah. I swear I’d forget my head if it wasn’t attached to my neck,” he said sheepishly, handing over the boxed lunches back to the cashier attendant.
“Tony, we need to talk.” was all Steve said when he came down to the workshop with a pastrami sandwich from Katz’s deli in hand.
“Why me?”
“That’s not an excuse, Tony. You’re the most important person in my life and I got no right treating you that way even if it is a bad day.”
Aloha: Hello; Goodbye
I know I skipped over the majority of IM1, but my aim was to look deeper into the events that made Tony turned his life around and the majority of that occurred during his captivity, that's why I spent most of the story with Tony as a captive.
Clint nodded in assent and reached for the thankfully intact communicator, connecting them to the Avengers facility and calling for a quinjet to airlift them out, telling them to bring an emergency medical crew with them because Captain America was in critical condition.
“Hey, sweetheart,” Steve murmured, “time to wake up, unless you want a crick in your neck from sleeping here the whole night.”
A few minutes later, the raucous footsteps that signalled the arrival of the buffalo herd Steve and Tony had for sons could be heard approaching the master bedroom. The bedroom door slammed open and Steve winced as the boys were apparently caught up in an argument about who would win a fight, Godzilla or King Ghidorah, if Godzilla didn’t have humans helping him.
They decided to call Maria Hill and Nick Fury from the depth from whence they came to deal with Barnes. From their initial interview, it looked like he was no longer under HYDRA’s influence and seemed to have broke through the brainwashing. They were, however, still cautious about the possibility of him being triggered and snapping back to the Winter Soldier persona.
It’s almost worth the heartache to know that he had the unconditional love and support from his family.
Yet some people choose to fall in love. Choosing to accept that by falling in love, you’re also accepting the possibility, or worse the
“Yes. And then she died from injuries sustained from HYDRA attack and trying to heal everyone on base. Seventy years later, I saw you do the same thing. Do you think it’s a coincidence, Tony?” Steve asked him rhetorically, already knowing what Tony would say in response. Tony had hoped that it wouldn’t come to this. He hoped that he would have more time to slowly ease Steve into it, or never tell him about any of it. But of course, life had to fuck him up once again by making him show his little secret in front of Steve.
It’s a miracle that he had been able to hide these episodes from Steve. He had always sleep better when Steve was with him. Making love with Steve was a mind blowing, passionate, love-fest that always left Tony boneless and sated to the point where he would fall into a dreamless sleep. If they didn’t have some fun before falling asleep, he would always be comforted by Steve’s arms around him, or by wrapping himself around Steve like an insanely codependent octopus. That’s usually enough to keep the nightmares at bay. Having Steve’s presence permeated his every sense did wonders for Tony’s trauma.
Also, shout out to the one person who subscribed to me! I have more stories planned but it might be awhile before I can complete and publish it, since I'm trying to publish a paper for my research. But stick with me, babes! I will come through for you.
“Peter!” he belatedly realized that he just gave Spiderman’s secret identity away, but at the moment it was the last thing on his mind, “
Steve found Tony sitting towards the back of the bar, commandeering a table with a tall glass of tonic and lime in front of him. As he approached his mate, Steve felt a sense of contentment washing over him. Steve knew in his guts that Tony wouldn’t have done what Bucky seemed so certain of. He and Tony were a solid couple, two parts of a whole. And while they may have their disagreements and differences of opinions, Steve believed with a fervor of a religious man that he and Tony were meant for each other.  And he knew Tony would never even think of jeopardizing their relationship.
“Yes, it’s very cool.” The soldier grinned happily and took out his instant camera out of his jacket pocket and gave it to the soldier sitting in the front seat. “I don't want to see this on your MySpace page.” Tony told him. The soldier then put up a peace sign as he leaned in for a picture with Tony. “Please, no gang signs.” The young man looked crestfallen at Tony’s words, “No, throw it up. I'm kidding. Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job with peace.”
“I will read about it tomorrow, after you forget about all this breaking up stuff,okay?”
“Thanks, Joe. I really appreciate it.” Tony conveyed his gratitude. And just to satisfy his curiosity, he asked, “how’s, uh, how’s Steve?”
his date of birth, officer. This isn’t a fake driver’s license. You can check,” Ulysses suggested.
, what’s the matter?” Papa asked, brow furrowing in concern.
“What’s for lunch, babe?” Tony started walking around the kitchen counter, poking at the cold cuts Steve pulled out of the fridge earlier.
“When did you start this up?”
Finally getting up from his perch by the pool, he picked up the portable ultrasound and addressed Candice the Walrus, “Okay let’s what we got here, mommy,” he angled the ultrasound sensor in the vicinity of the walrus’ womb and finally stopping when a cute little walrus facial features appeared on the screen, “There’s the little guy. Congratulations, mommy!”
Steve smiled proudly. At this point, his life was pretty much perfect. In about four months, he and Tony would be welcoming a new person to their lives, a person who would be the center of their universe. This brand new life that he and Tony created together, who would be the best of Tony and him.
They reached the Tower soon enough, traffic was blessedly empty. Tony expertly unbuckled both kids and ushered Ulysses to the waiting elevator, courtesy of JARVIS.
“That’s it, baby. Let it go, let go, Tony. Come for me. Let me see you lose yourself, beautiful.” Steve encouraged, his hips still maintaining their steady rhythm. Tony’s eyes slammed shut as he reached his climax, his heartbeat skyrocketed, he felt his back arched and his cock released a burst of cum signaling his completion. As Tony comes down, he felt Steve still and unmoving inside him.
“You’re pregnant, aren’t you?”
When Tony woke up again, he was laying down on a hospital bed. The sound of machines beeping, keeping track of his pulse was the only sound in the room. Tony allowed a few moments to collect himself, trying to remember the chain of events that led him to this hospital bed.
A couple of flashes emanated from the camera and the whole affair was over.
Nick spotted him as he sat down on the booth and approached him, “Hey, Mr. Peanut butter cups!”
“Of course, Sir.”
But wait, what was his point, again? Oh right, Jane and Thor.
“Soon.” he whispered back, then urged Groot to take to the sky and whisk them away from the beach and the carcass of the monster that Steven slayed in Anthony’s name.
“Hey. You okay?”
“So you’re just brazenly racist?”
” then Tony walked out of the living room to the kitchen.
“You need to grow up, Steve!” was the last thing he heard Bucky said to him. Which was probably the only truth he said to Steve that night.
Joe walked back to the house, entering through the kitchen to find James doing reps on the kitchen counter. “What’s for dinner tonight, James?”
So they were all going to Maui and would be there for two weeks. Tony (or rather his PA Joshua) had booked them at the Four Seasons at Wailea. Everyone who had kids were getting a residential suite. Sam and Clint both insisted on getting an oceanview room, while Bucky and Natasha didn’t much care for the oceanview, just as long as they had rooms far enough from the rest of them so they could do unspeakable things to each other. Everyone shuddered at the thought of what they did behind closed doors. If it was anything like the way they fought, it was acrobatic, to say the least.
Really, unrealistic beauty standards would be the downfall of modern civilization.
“Why does he look like E.T.? Is he an alien, Papa?” Ulysses scrunched up his nose in curiosity.
Yikes, that didn’t sound like a smooth conversation.
“When I was pregnant with Pete. And you had just been blown up by AIM and was working on regrowing 75% of the skin on the left side of your body, Steve. So forgive me if I made the executive decision not to tell you about something that wasn’t relevant anymore since Bruce had cleared me of any complications by that point. What was the point in worrying with something inconsequential?”
Steve walked down the steps leading to Tony’s workshop intending to fetch his mate for the night. Tony had been working since they’ve finished dinner. It was now almost midnight and Steve thought it was time to take a break because lately Tony seemed to be putting more hours in the workshop and in the offices down stairs. Whatever cutting edge, earth shattering, groundbreaking invention he was working could wait until tomorrow.
“Maybe,” Joe sighed, “but I just have this hunch that something else is going on here.” Joe tapped his phone to unlock it, swiping to the app he had made in the event something like this happened. He tapped a few things to activate it, the phone screen switched to display the interface for the tracking device that he had placed in Peter’s suit.
“Happy to be of service, Winghead.” Tony answered, “And now a little evening stroll to finish the day. Perfect,”
“Aw, Thor, I’m sorry to hear that, buddy.” Tony knelt down to sit next to him, “breakups are always hard, even though you knew it was inevitable.”
“I can do that,” Steve smiled softly at Tony, “I can give you all the time in the world.”
Thor nodded, then he knelt down to inspect the door, “there’s nothing tacky on the bolt here. So it wasn’t taped. That means either the dead guy hid in the club after closing, or Tony let him in after my sweep.”
Behind them, Sharon looked around as she took in the lively atmosphere of the bar. It’s as if nothing terrible ever happened here. As she started to walk towards the bar for a drink, Pierce approached her to whisper something in her ear. At his words, all of the pieces came together. She knew who killed Rumlow.
“Did she know that you didn’t mean to upset her, that it was a mistake?”
Save the prince, save the world.
“If it’s in the bar, we’ll eventually find it, so--”
“Sure…”
“Certainly, Captain.”
“Yes, dim sum!” Clint cheered, “I’ll go wake everyone up!” then he rushed out of the kitchen to wake everyone up.
Steve chuckled again, “Congratulations, honey. I’m so proud of you. God, it’s not even my achievement but I’m so proud and happy for you. You’ve wanted this for so long but back then the chances of you ever winning a Prize was slim to none on account of all your work considered  ‘Classified’.”
Ulysses huffed longsufferingly, putting up with Tony’s antics, “
Peter didn’t tell Joe or Uly about the close call on his identity being revealed last night. Uly was in the middle of midterms at Harvard and Joe was already asleep by the time Peter got home. And anyway, Peter handled it just fine. He left before he could blabbed some more about who he was behind the mask. No need to make his big brothers worry over nothing.
A courting of some sort.
“See you around.” Tony turned to leave. He was halfway to his car when Steve called out to him.
That afternoon, Tony and Steve went to the precinct to get an update on his employees’ interviews and to see whether there was anything he could do to persuade Bucky to open the bar back up. Tony had hoped Steve could appeal to his brother’s sentimentality. Bucky was fond of Sarah, the woman who was as good as a second mother to him. Surely, he wouldn’t let Sarah’s legacy be closed, and turn away profit. Since Steve went to meet up with his brother, that left Tony saddled alone with Sharon. As the only other person-in-charge of their case, he was relegated to her care. And it’s not going well, so far.
“That’s it?”
But Tony couldn’t deny that he wanted to know more about him. He wanted to know more about this dream, something inside him was telling him that it was an important moment in his life. The moment everything changed. Which was weird, because Tony had never been to a fair like that before, and never even meet the man before.
, because he was relieved that he wasn’t in the car with them and got to stay alive. More
To further bolster its status as a tourist attraction, Tony provided free high speed internet for anyone who visited. And lately there was another reason why Avengers Tower’s popularity as a tourist attraction increased.
And just like that, the Avengers knew that Tony was expecting. They were ecstatic. Clint has been pestering him and Steve to name him the baby’s godfather; Natasha has been silently but persistently pushing old timey Russian remedies that were known to be good for pregnant omegas and their babies, like chicken feet soup that according to her would boost the baby’s intelligence (please, Tony’s gonna be this kid’s parent, there’s no way the kid was gonna turn out any way other than a genius) or some green leafy vegetables that she said would boost Tony’s milk production during lactation (and that was just...Tony had no words for that. He’d cross that bridge when he got to it).
“Jimmy, stay with Stark!” the other soldier bellowed to the young man, Jimmy, sitting next to Tony before he got out of the vehicle.
“According to all six of the pregnancy tests I peed on, yes we are definitely pregnant. One of them even spelled out the word “pregnant” on the thing as if there could be a possibility of someone being vaguely pregnant. Or halfway between pregnant and not.”
Okay, that might be pushing it a little. He was a somewhat sore loser, but that’s just because he very rarely lost any competition he ever entered, okay? It had more to do with not knowing how to handle losses and being raised with the mindset that he was the best there was. But he was getting better, he was getting less competitive and starting to understand that a little humility never hurt anyone.
“So Steve was right about the gangbangers?”
“Steve wouldn’t go for what?” Steve walked in to the nursery, carrying tray filled with bowl of Natasha’s lactation soup, spinach and kale salad and some braised dim sum chicken feet. If he weren’t so hungry all the time and actually needed the food to breastfeed Ulysses, Tony would feel like such a fatass for eating so much so often.
Steve rolled his eyes, “How does Ulysses know how to count cards?”
“Please make sure he at least ate something nutritious before the ice cream.” Tony called out to them, eliciting groans of “Okay, Babbo…”
“Yes, so uh, Clint, sorry but it’s just not bar material, you know. You understand.” Steve tried to get in a word edgewise in the face of Clint and Coulson making goo goo eyes at each other, and failing to do so.
, because his parents’ death was still something that he hadn’t gotten over despite happening more than 20 years ago.
“You can’t, Tony. They’re still operating on him, cleaning his wounds then putting on skin grafts on him.”
“Me too. He has the same blood on his hands as Loki does. But we can’t let Loki get away with this. He’s made it personal and it’s time to hit back.”
“No.” Tony emphatically denied.
“His name is Ulysses.” Steve showed a picture of smiling baby surrounded by small alphabet blocks. The baby was looking at the camera with big blue eyes that looked exactly like Steve’s. “Ulysses James.”
Tony started the walk to his car when Steve’s voice stopped him in his tracks, “Actually Tony, would you like to have breakfast again tomorrow morning? Same time? Because I have to go to mass at 10. ”
Tony’s not an idiot, okay. He may be emotionally stunted, but he’s not an idiot. He knows there’s an undercurrent of attraction and affection that underlies all of his interactions with Steve. At first, he chalks it up to hero worship of the Alpha since Tony did grew up with Steve being heralded as the pinnacle of goodness and bravery. But after getting to know Steve better as his friend, Tony can’t help but fall for him. His bravery, his innate need to do the right thing, his stubbornness, his protectiveness, his ability to make Tony feel loved and happy. Basically, he fell for everything about Steve. And Tony thinks Steve feels the same way, if the way he sometimes catch Steve looking at him is any indication.
“Anybody touch it?” he asked. Jarvis angled his head at Bruce’s direction as the man in question timidly raised his hand.
Joe just wished there was a way to get an answer from the Alpha. But short of just asking him point blank, he didn’t know how else to go about it. What if it was all in his head, and he was making something out of nothing?
“Well, it’s talk like that that makes me sure just how proud we are of you.” Babbo said again, smiling at Peter, “But from now on, you update us on what’s going on with your double life as Spiderman. I see that suit you’re wearing to swing around town and I gotta tell you, kid, you’re giving me a heart attack. You and me are redesigning that suit
“How nice of that man to give me a CD of music that would remind me of all the wonderful times I shared with his son…” he said sarcastically, “What an ASSHOLE!”
It was a good start to another journey for their family and so far, four months in, Tony was going strong. He passed the three month mark safely, so the chances of spontaneous miscarriage has been substantially lowered. There was no irrational hatred of spherical objects like previously, and there was a significant increase in his affinity for corned beef and pastrami sandwiches from Second Avenue Deli, and only from Second Avenue Deli. Sandwiches from any other place would not do.
Steve flipped through some pages in the journal at an alarmingly fast paced, “We can skip that part,” he shrugged.
“You guess?” Sue countered, putting her free hand on her hips. Tony thought this was what a mother would look like before scolding their unruly children, not that Tony would know. His mom was never the “scolding their unruly children” type. Or the “paying attention to their children” type. “What did you have for breakfast, honey?”
Joe shook his head fondly. One thing he discovered about Jamie was that he was funny and witty. His sense of humor took a bit of getting used to, a self-deprecating and high brow humor that Joe found fascinating.
Hope you like the latest installment!
“You knew that when you mated me.” Tony grinned cheekily. As he settled in, he took in the spread that was on the counter. It looked like Steve, Natasha and Sam went to Chinatown and got pan fried dumplings, Taiwanese beef noodle soup, the spicy cold noodle dish Tony liked and boba milk teas, because Natasha Romanov, badass spy/assassin, was obsessed with them. In fact, she was sitting across from Tony slurping away on a large cup of Boba tea. Other than the Chinese food and cups of Boba tea, the ever present fruit bowl was there, filled to the brim with apples, oranges and bananas.
“Traitor,” Tony muttered under his breath.
Tony brightened up at the mention of his new car, “Well yeah. But I don’t think she’s ready for the road. I still need to replace the master cylinder, the clutch gear and the windows still don’t have automatic gears. I have to move it using manual cranks, for god’s sakes.”
Tony sighed and ran his hands through his hair roughly in desperation. He hated not knowing, and most of all he hated not knowing whether Steve was okay or not. He had put the boys down for the night, JARVIS watching over them and rushed to the med bay and for the last two hours had been waiting with Bruce, Thor, Bucky, Sam and Maria for Steve, Clint and Natasha’s arrival.
And (another) baby makes five.
“Tomatoes.” Steve then said, prompting Tony to take all the tomatoes garnishing Steve’s dish because of Steve’s aversion to tomatoes on the grounds of them making his food soggy, never mind that what he was eating was a seafood stew, “You missed one.” Steve said again and Tony obligingly took a piece of tomato from Steve’s food, leaving the stew tomato free.
Bucky still had a hard time wrapping his head around the fact that he now shared a roof with an Alien that had power to control thunder. He never would have imagined this in his wildest dreams. He wondered what the Commando boys would say if they saw how he and Steve were living now.
“No, of course not. Maybe, I’m just scared. Scared that now he had the one thing that connects him to the past back, he wouldn’t want his future anymore. I know, it’s illogical but fears and doubts aren’t known to be rational.”
“Sir, are you alright?” Adonis opened his mouth again, brow furrowing in concern as Anthony remained silent in the face of his question.
Just as he was debating on whether or not he should call Steve and inform him about Tony’s situation, the elevator opened and from it, Steve and Sam emerged. Sam immediately made a beeline to the fridge for a drink of water, while Steve, looking for all the world as if hasn’t  ran 10 miles, spotted his husband and Clint at the living room and walked over to join them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thanks, Thor.” Steve closed the office door and walked towards where his mate was sitting behind his desk, catching up on paperwork. “You know, I think you’re right. We should sell out.”
“Shall we?” Ulysses said, holding his elbow out for Tony to wound his arm around. His other hand was holding Steve’s who was arm in arm with Peter, Joe at Ulysses’ other side. And together they walked down the aisle to where Clint was officiating their mating ceremony.
“One cup per day, Tony,” Steve cautioned, “I’ll know if you cheat. Now, sit down please. I’ll take care of Ulysses’ breakfast.”
“So, fellas, I’m very satisfied with what I’m seeing so far. Tony’s blood pressure is under control, and it looks like the fetal heart rate is doing well. A bit slower than we normally expect but it is within normal range. So now, we’re at the point where we can start to tell what the sex is. Would you like to know?”
Bucky was waiting for them in front of one of the stalls. His face set in of those frowns Steve recognized from when they were young. It was a frown Bucky wore when Steve did something wrong, like pick a fight he knew he couldn’t win no matter what the reasoning behind it was. Steve looked curiously at him but couldn’t spare too much of a thought as he was too focused on comforting Tony. Tony had a death grip on his arm, his left hand clutching at Steve’s leather jacket. Bucky opened the stall and there in all its hideous glory was the dead body of a man. He had a gunshot wound to his chest. By the blood spatter on the back wall of the stall, it looked like he was shot here. He had a trauma wound on his head along with the gunshot to the chest. Steve guessed the guy was hit on the head first then shot to death.
The boys were sad, to say the least. Though it seemed they were less sad about the absence of new sibling and more for the fact that their Babbo was sad and hurting. Peter immediately hugged Tony and refused to leave his side, attaching himself to his father like a limpet. Ulysses took over making dinner for them, a simple pasta carbonara that he knew Tony’s mother used to make him as a kid. Joe told Tony amusing stories about band practice which brought a smile to Tony’s face. The warm fuzziness in his chest and the overwhelming love Steve felt for his children at seeing how kind, how thoughtful and how compassionate they were being warm the dark recesses of his soul where grief still reside.
“Please don’t call it a Robo Deathmatch. You make us sound like we’re in a cult and you’ll upset the bots.” Joe said as he sat down in the only available chair in the whole table, next to Jamie and close enough to smell Jamie’s deep, comforting musky scent that sometimes followed Joe to his dreams.
“Please, I would never invent something plebeian like a potato gun,” Joe retorted back, “when I was your age, I already made my first telescope.”
“I may have been a little bit, a minuscule amount, a teeny tiny bit jealous of Barnes.” Tony managed to mumble out, his face smushed to Steve’s chest to hide his embarrassment.
“Okay, Barton and I have a thing,” Maria admitted, “But it’s not a boyfriend-girlfriend thing, okay? It’s a thing. Just a-- a thing.”
“That’s the six million dollar question right there.” Tony said, taking a sip from his tumbler. What, indeed, would he do? Stop going to the diner so he doesn’t have to see Steve? Pros: heartbreak and rejection avoided. Cons: not seeing Steve. Not seeing his smile, or hear his laughter or see him furrow his brow in that really cute way of his when Tony told him an inappropriate joke. Or would he go to the diner, do what Clint and Quill suggested, ensnare Steve under false pretenses, have fun with him for a day then leave him at the end, no commitments, no strings attached. Pros: Seeing Steve again, even without Steve remembering that one amazing morning they shared. Cons: unethically taking advantage of a trauma patient.
“I always wanna kiss you, Tony, regardless of the presence of a baby in your arms.” Steve responded, aware he must be making the dopey lovey dovey face, as Clint coined it, at Tony.
Later, Joe was dozing on the couch while Steve watched attentively at the movie that he unknowingly had at least 100 times in the past year alone. Bucky picked at his pineapple cake on the couch next to Steve, with no intention to eat another piece of it. On screen, Donnie Wahlberg and Bruce Willis argued about their mortality, and when Donnie’s character shot off a gun Steve jolted on the couch, not expecting the scene to end the way it was. Joe smiled softly at his son. Some days, it was easy to fool themselves that they’re normal, that Steve was living a normal life. But then little things, like not knowing that Bruce Willis was a ghost the whole time or the way a football game would end, would remind them that they’re playing a ruse on Steve.
Chuckling, Nick went back to the kitchen while muttering “Peanut butter cups,” and looking at Tony funny.
.” Joe grumbled, irrationally annoyed with himself for being so.
Once the song ended, everyone who was in the audience clapped, with Thor’s whistles being the loudest form of accolade in the room. Tony was clapping, beaming proudly like a father at his son, “That was wonderful!” Steve side eyed his mate, rolling his eyes at Tony’s complete change of heart on Clint’s band, knowing all along this would happen.
Peter had patrol that afternoon, though he cut it short because he still wasn’t feeling too good after what happened yesterday. He arrived home that evening before the sun went down, expertly dropping down into his room and finding Joe lounging on his bed. He was on his phone texting, a dopey smile on his face which meant he saw texting Jamie. Peter rolled his eyes fondly. He was glad Jamie and Joe finally got his act together. Joe always acted like he didn’t need anyone and that it wasn’t bothering him to see the guy he liked dating other people. But Joe looked happy now, like a burden had been lifted off his shoulders and he could breathe and live easier.
Tony slid the drawn napkin forward to Pierce, “Why didn’t you show this to the police?” the older man questioned him.
At the reminder that he was still on decaf, Tony grimaced, “Ugh decaf. When can I go back to the real stuff? This is getting unbearable.”
Barton came in next, he looked like he was still sleeping judging by the closed eyes. But he managed to find the fridge with great accuracy, not once tripping or bumping other furnitures in his way, and took out a box of orange juice and drank it straight from the carton.
At Steven’s behest Groot landed them on one of the cliffs overlooking the sea. Steven dismounted and helped Anthony off the horse and safely back onto his feet on the ground. “Stay here, please, for your safety. I shall return.” Steven beckoned Anthony, holding the prince’s hand in his. Anthony’s hands fit perfectly in his, it was callous, so different than how he expected a royalty’s hand would be, more fitting to be a working man’s hand, yet now Steven started to find that he liked the unexpected more than the traditional. After all, he wouldn’t have been able to meet this beautiful creature if it weren’t for Alexander’s ludicrous request to slay the Gorgon’s head.
The fallout...
Wilson’s brother scoffed, “Man, Sam barely talks to me. You dig?”
“What’s his name, then?” Ulysses asked again.
“Why?” Tony implored his mate.
Tony smiled back at him, eyes full with unshed tears. “I love you, too.”
“That’s good, Tony. You’re getting back to the world, back to what you’re doing best. By the way, I got a little something for you,” Joe handed him a wrapped package. It looks like a CD from the shape of it, “from one mechanic to another.” he said.
“So this guy Killian,” he asked his brother, “how bad does he want your place?” Bucky asked, handing Steve a styrofoam cup of hot coffee.
It was not what Tony deserved their mating ceremony to be though. Tony deserved everything. He deserved the best. He deserved a mating ceremony where all their friends and family were there, celebrating with them and sharing in the joy. Tony deserved a party, a celebration. Not a shotgun mating ceremony at a DC courthouse with two city clerks who was disgruntled because they had a lot of paperwork to go through but was forced to volunteer as mating witnesses. And it still rankled at Steve even eighteen years later that he didn’t give Tony the mating ceremony he deserved. Eighteen years and three sons later, and the shotgun mating ceremony was still on Steve’s mind as something unresolved.
So yes, Steve could deal with Tony’s aversion of spherical objects. It wasn’t that big of a deal. Steve was getting good at getting rid or concealing spherical shaped objects from their shared living space. Except when those objects were attached to his person.
In his dreams that night Peter dreamed of his family. Papa, Babbo, Uly, Joe and himself having a picnic and the time of their lives. Maybe it was just him, but Peter swore he could feel the bone-deep contentment he felt when he was with them well after he woke up the next morning. He couldn’t wait for the weekend to come.
He was aware later on of Papa coming in to his room, stroking his head and murmuring some words. Irish words, Peter thought. Peter didn’t know what they meant but the way Papa said it elicited such warmth in Peter. Peter felt Papa kissed his forehead, Papa’s scent enveloping him and fell back to sleep. Then he felt Babbo, crooning the lullaby he always sang to them when they were little and swapping the now-warm cloth on Peter’s forehead with a colder one. Peter felt Babbo settled in next to him, curling around him and Peter snuggled closer to his Babbo. Minutes later, he smelled Papa’s scent in his room again. Peter knew from experience that his parents would be spending the night camped out in his room, they always did so every time he or any of his siblings were sick. Peter relaxed into his bed and fell back asleep, comforted by the knowledge that his parents were here with him, protecting him and comforting him.
“I’m sure he’ll have mastered it by the time I get back from this mission.”
“It’s uncanny. I don’t know how we’ve missed it before.”
“We probably should stop bad mouthing them while we’re here, though. I don’t think your brother would take it too kindly.”
I wrote this when I was waiting for my plane to board at LAX, so I wasn't really at 100%.
Anthony blanched at that, “Truly?”
“Because he’s a cop?”
Clint immediately shielding Ulysses with his body and preparing to leave the room; Mjolnir flew in from Thor’s room, smashing through layers of concrete and steel (which means Tony now had to repair the floors. Again.) to land seamlessly in Thor’s hand and startling Ulysses who started crying in Clint’s arms; Natasha pulled out a gun from God knew where and just to make sure she’s completely armed, unsheathed one of the kitchen knives from its place on the counter; Sam and Bruce stiffened up in defense, with Bruce looking unsure and nervous in his place by the stove; Tony was busy trying to calm down and soothe his son with Steve covering his mate and son with his body in a protective stance.
“Son of a bitch!” Jimmy exclaimed. He started to get out of the vehicle too, Tony scrambling to follow him, asking him to give Tony a gun.
“This place is under a cloud.” Killian interjected, “things like this occur when people are not...reasonable.” he said. His last words were directly addressed to Steve.
Steve shook his head in annoyance and dejection. The SI board members weren’t really known for their progressive stance toward gender roles. Some of them still maintained that an omega’s place was at home. After news of his and Steve’s mating broke, many of the board members tried to give Steve power of attorney over Tony, stating that as the Alpha he would be better equipped to make decisions logically. This move was quickly and efficiently squashed by Steve, with Steve making it clear once and for all that Stark Industries was Tony’s, not his, and as such Tony should be the only one making decisions about the company’s trajectory and future directions, not anybody else.
Bruce left after giving Steve all of Aurora’s items, from the diaper bags to the Baby Einstein picture book that she was currently fixated on. Steve propped her up on his lap and decided to entertain her a little bit by going through the picture book with her. Aurora’s sharp intelligent eyes moved through the pages with him. Once in a while she would point at a picture, and glanced up at Steve asking him with her gaze what the item would be called. They played the pointing game, as Steve dubbed it in his mind, for awhile until Joe and Peter came up to them.
“Maybe because we have good taste.” Steve piped in.
“How bad? The kind of bad that won’t take no for an answer. Why?” Steve asked, remembering all the times the man came to their bar, talking to Tony and under the guise of discussing a deal, always tried to subtly seduce his mate.
“Can we get dim sum for breakfast?” Ulysses asked. He was an emotional eater, just like Steve. If he was upset or stressed, he would eat to make himself feel better. Peter was still latched on to his back as he walked to the fridge, to fetch a glass of orange juice for himself and Peter, when his little brother indicated he wanted one too.
“The ambulance is coming soon, sweetheart.” Steve said, wiping away the sweat off his mate’s forehead, “just hold on a little longer.”
“I laugh in the face of danger, Sir.”
“Uh yeah. I live over in Kahala now.” Tony said, tilting his head curiously because the news of his relocation from the mainland made headline news awhile back.
They would be going on a family vacation to Maui for the summer, at Tony’s insistence. It would be the last summer Ulysses would spend with them before going to college in the fall. He had been accepted to Harvard, much to Tony’s dismay (he blamed Rhodey and Bucky for not doing their godfatherly duties well), to study history and political science. Ulysses wanted to be a lawyer. He became fixated on the crusading lawyer archetype ever since he saw ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ on one of the family’s movie nights. He wanted to be just like Atticus Finch, helping people who were victimized by the system, or who were wrongly accused and couldn’t defend themselves. Steve was proud of his son for having such aspirations. His family’s legacy of service would continue on with Ulysses. Tony was just glad Ulysses didn’t want to run off to join the military to serve his country. He appreciated Steve, Bucky, Rhodey and Sam for their services, but there’s still something inside him that rebelled at the thought of his baby being in the line of fire, even though said baby was old enough to enlist. Ulysses was still bummed out by his break up with Amy, but spending time with his little brothers, helping Peter with his chemistry experiments or playing the piano while Joe played his cello or having a coding tournament with his little brothers to see who could improve DUM-E (Ulysses), Butterfingers (Joe) or U (Peter) the best seemed to cheer him up significantly. Bucky and Rhodey took him out to play paintball one weekend, and they were gone for the whole day, but when they came back Ulysses looked pleased as punch. Beating his godfathers, who were both military men, at paintballing might have something to do with that.
“No can do. My identity would have been changed by then. The man you see before would be no more,” Tony interjected, starting to fidget and anxious to leave.
“Bring me back an “I heart NYC” t-shirt. My size is men’s medium.” Clint said seriously.
“Why, uh, why do you say that, Point Break?” He and Steve were the last two people on Earth who should be giving out relationship advice because between the two of them they had a grand total of ONE relationship working out: the one they were currently in. Their first relationship was also their last relationship. Ain’t that something?
She continued on her way to the kitchen, and Tony continued to surreptitiously spied on Steve. He seemed to be on the verge of completing his waffle house, but was having trouble with the last piece that would be the door. Seeing an obvious solution to the construction problem, Tony took a chance and impulsively pick up a toothpick and approached Steve.
“No, Babbo, of course not. I trust you and Papa both. I wanted to tell you, but later. Much, much later when I’ve already established a name for myself, a reputation so to speak. I was gonna tell you when--” Peter trailed off, unsure of how his parents would react to what he would say.
Tony had somehow unearthed more of Steve’s old stuff from God knows where. That morning they had gotten a call from Pepper about a Stark Industries warehouse in upstate New York. And Howard, despite Steve’s displeasure in how he treated Tony as he was growing up, was an excellent hoarder who happened to keep Steve’s belongings from his time in the European war theater. Which happened to include his battered copy of
“Come here, you wanna drool on Uncle Clint? Let’s drool on Uncle Clint.” He reached for Ulysses and Tony readily relinquished his hold on the baby, glad to have a little reprieve.
“Oh, I think that’s my son,” Nice Blond Lady said excitedly, “Sweetheart, sweetheart over here!” she called out. Moments later, the owner of said voice bounded in to the alleyway where they were standing. Peter absently noted that the thick brown hair and the handsome face looked familiar, but then again the guy did have one of those ridiculously proportional faces you would see on TV. But hey, those purple eyes were something you didn’t see everywhere. In fact, only one person Peter knew had eyes like that. And it was...
“People know the best way to hurt him is to hurt me.” Tony sighed.
Steve expected it, but hearing it all the same didn’t make it any easier. His hopes and dreams of having his best friend and the love of his life getting along were dashed. This was the price to pay. Steve couldn’t have it both ways.
And Steve, well he was only an Alpha, okay? How could anyone ever resist the gift and temptation that was Tony Stark. He wound his arm around Tony’s waist, soft and trim; his scent still bore some of that milky sweetness he would have when lactating, it was an intoxicating scent that awaken something primal within Steve. This omega was his, down to the very core of his being, and they have created a life together. Steve brought his head down to kiss Tony but before he could taste those sweet, sweet lips, a pudgy hand grabbed his and Tony’s cheek and squeezed, halting his movement.
would look better if he used you as the model’, and that’s a direct quote. He will kill me when he finds out I tell you this but whatever, I’m dead anyway for letting you know my secret identity.”
“This whole time I’ve known you and I never how beautiful your voice sounds when you sing,” Steve’s voice startled him out of his reverie. He spotted his Alpha standing at the doorjamb of the nursery, a smile on his face as he looked at them.
The officer took one look at Bucky’s drivers license and shot them an incredulous look, “Are you kidding me?”
He had Tony laid down on their bed, his mouth kissing and sucking its way down from Tony’s lips to the juncture where his neck met shoulder, sucking a hickey to mark his mate. Tony’s moans encouraging him to go further down, to where he could make Tony strung out on pleasure. His growing abdomen proof of how strong their bond was, and how suited to each other they were. He felt Tony’s calloused engineer hands caressed his back, moving towards his chest then caressing his abdomen. His mate’s touches felt so good. Steve let out a groan as Tony’s hand started to stroke his cock. It felt so good, the warmth of Tony’s hands, he could feel the knot at the base of his cock started to flare. Steve blindly sought Tony’s mouth, kissing him deeply, taking everything Tony had to offer him. He could feel the pleasure spiking, the heat from Tony’s mouth, the wetness of his entrance, ready for the taking, until suddenly everything stopped.
“Is it cool if I take a picture with you?”
At that moment, he was complete and he knew without a doubt that they were simply meant to be.
“Morning Clint, Tony. Have you guys had breakfast yet?” he addressed them, rounding the way to the front of the couch.
“Wouldn’t miss it for the world, Steve.” Bruce said, “congratulations, guys.” he placed the bunny on the nightstand by Tony’s bed.
“You bought six pregnancy tests?” Steve laughed. Of course Tony did, he never do anything by halves.
“Perhaps I shouldn’t be too upset about what happened since it brought me to you,” Steven chuckled, eliciting a small smile from Anthony, “I was out at sea, fishing as I usually do everyday. Clint and Natasha was accompanying me as they sometimes did. We were chatting, conversing about things that had happened, when Clint suddenly told me that I needed to go back home. When I got back, the Seriphos king, Alexander, was there along with his legions of sadistic army, in the process of forcefully taking my mother away, to forcefully marry her. They’ve beaten my father, he was laid up on the ground, bloodied and bruised, helpless to fight the violence they wrought upon him. So I stepped in, told Alexander that I was to be my mother’s champion and he challenged me to slay the Gorgon Medusa and bring her severed head to him. Only then would he release his claim on my mother and leave our family alone. I know he meant to kill me by sending me on such a fool’s errand, but I had help from some of my siblings. So I killed the Gorgon.”
“This is Anthony of the House of Stark, crown prince of Aethiopia and my betrothed.” Steven proudly declared.
“I want to thank you for last night, for saving my mom. I was worried when she didn’t come home when she was supposed to.”
“No, she didn’t. She hasn’t said my name.”
“And I’ll keep fighting beside you, Steve. Together.”
JARVIS took a couple minutes to perform all the necessary calculation. When he finished, the displayed results floated in front of Tony, lines of mathematical equations that are as familiar to Tony as every breath he took.
Somehow, Thor managed to look even prouder than Steve for Tony’s pregnancy. Which was a feat in and of itself, considering Steve was the one who actually put the bun in the oven, so to speak. Thor kept insisting that his presence in the Tower was what made it possible for Tony to conceive as he was also known as the God of Fertility. Thor giving himself credit for a pregnancy not of his own making was only slightly weirder than Natasha giving him lactation soup.
“Flatterer,” Joe murmured out, his body warm with affection for the boy in front of him. They must have stared at each other like love sick idiots for awhile before Joe remembered why he was still here in the first place, “Um, so, I’m just waiting for Peter. He’s on patrol today,” Joe lowered his voice, cautious of prying ears and eyes though it didn’t seem he should be worried about it since they were the only two people left in the hallway, “But I’m worried. He should have been done by now. I’ve called him but he’s not answering.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Uh, he might laugh at the dumb jock who thinks that he’s good enough for someone as smart and amazing like him, and then I will have to quit school which will lead to me losing my football scholarship and then I’ll end up living in my parents’ basement for the rest of my life, selling Herbalife supplements and going into massive debt because that will be the only thing I’m good at in life.”
“Really, Stark? You just met him today.” Natasha fixed him with a dry look as she observed the way their bodies were angled towards each other.
” Joe replied, fingers tapping at the StarkPad in his lap. Peter had asked him for his input on his spider web formula. It’s a fascinating project to be sure, but Joe was finding it hard to concentrate. Now that Peter pointed it out to him, the weight of those violet eyes on him, so rarely seen on a person, made Joe hyper aware of everything around him.
Just as he was starting to shook his thoughts off Steve to actually started paying attention to what Blond guy said, a song came blaring through the sound system of the club. It was a shitty Club remix version of Springsteen’s Dancing In The Dark. And Tony, well Tony promptly burst into tears.
Clint shuddered. “Ugh, better you than me. I swear to you she didn’t even break a sweat when she gave birth to Nate, and now she’s all wonky because she thinks you’re filling an emotional hole by having meaningless sex with strangers.”
Peter's a little shit. But he's the cutest, most adorkable lil' shit ;)
“I know, darling,” Thor said again. Ah, he must be talking to Jane then, Steve thought. “I never said that you didn’t care, just that you have more important things in your mind to worry about.”
“Maria, for the last time, I didn’t scream. I yelped. There’s a difference.” Bruce indignantly corrected her. Maria remained silent, crossing her arms in front of and rolling her eyes.
you?”
“Please, like you could exchange Steve for anything. He’s one of a kind, obviously.” Tony sauntered in to the living room, Ulysses on his heels carrying a small bowl of popcorn.
“Then what’s stopping you, soldier?” Tony huskily prompted.
Alas I have succumbed to the flu, friends. The epilogue is gonna be a little delayed. Sorry...
“Let’s try this again. Your name is James Barnes, correct?”
“Well, that’s unacceptable. Where can I appeal this decision?” Tony asked the blond beta detective, rushing to keep up with the flurry of movement accompanying her.
“Then why the hesitance? Do you doubt Steve’s love and devotion for you and Ulysses?”
The Avengers were all gathered in a small Catholic church in Westchester County. The priest, Father Vincent, was apparently a good friend of Steve’s that he made acquaintance with during his Americana trip. They stayed in touch and when Steve contacted him about baptizing his son, the father was more than happy to accommodate.
Joe wasn’t book smart, not like that genius fella Howard Stark that started his company with $50 and a garage full of scraps. Joe knew he ain’t getting any fancy scholarship to Columbia or NYU anytime soon. And with no scholarship, there’s no way he’d be going to college anytime soon even if he took out loans. So his only way out was to serve. He joined the Marine Corps right out of high school. The recruiting sergeant told him if he finished up his contract, then upon honorable discharge he’d be entitled to collect his G.I Bill benefits, which includes the Corps footing the bill for any tuition at any university he chose to go to.
“Well, you probably thought I couldn’t live up to the hype. But joke’s on you, it’s the hype that couldn’t live up to me.” Tony joked.
“Pierce? What are you doing on Nick’s phone?” Steve asked.
Tony chuckled and looked over to him, a smile on his face. Steve always knew what to say to alleviate his fears and his doubts. For so long, Tony had to wear a mask, an armor to a world that would swallow him up whole and throw him back up for daring to be an omega that defy societal norms. For being an omega who stood up for his rights, for demanding to be seen as a human, not a mere vessel for Alphas and Betas to procreate with, for wanting more than what was prescribed to him.
Steve looked shocked, his mouth was hanging open agape like someone just socked him in the face. Then a smile lit up his face as he pulled Tony back in to his embrace ad just for good measure kissed the living daylights out of Tony.
As Tony and Steve sped away from the Hukilau’s parking lot, the old man that sassed Tony on his first day at the Hukilau muttered, “Look at those two shitheads,” before walking off.
“Exactly. So forget HYDRA.” Bucky stated forcefully.
“That’s right, babe. Here with you, Ulysses and our loud, obnoxious and rowdy family.”
“She did. She would tell me stories about how they met and how they got married. Dad’s family settled in Boston, you see. He had a little sister, I think. I might still have some cousins up there, or maybe second cousins.” Steve told Tony.
“Get revenge. Ain’t we supposed to be the Avengers?” Steve grinned roguishly at him, and Tony was helpless not to do the same. Natasha looked at them with bewilderment. They were just fighting and sniping at each other just a few hours ago and now they were acting like the best of friends. Tony cleared his throat when he noticed that he and Steve had been staring at each other for longer than was necessary.
Translation for the Hawai'ian words:
“Really? You’re pregnant.” Steve laughed joyously.
Steve thought as he tightened his hold around Anthony’s waist, keeping the man secure in his arms as Groot flew downward towards the floating island.
“He’s my brother. And your bar is on my block. Do the math, man.”
“I almost like it better when you guys were still staring at each other from across your lockers,” Aaron said from behind Peter, “they’re gonna be insufferable like this, trust me.”
“Nothing, Papa.” Peter answered quickly, hopefully assuaging his parent’s concern, “just a little bit of headache, no biggie.” he shrugged.
Tony saw Natasha in the kitchen, already seated on one of the stools on the counter sipping on her morning tea, “Are you seeing this disaster?” Tony asked her.
“Get the guy to smack the tambourine-- you maybe get a shot. Finally.”
“No?” Tony felt his heart dropped to his stomach though it was anatomically impossible, “that sucks.”
Before going home, they spotted a photo booth and decided to take some pictures. It was a riot and a half trying to fit that many buff and muscled men into a photo booth. They managed with just fitting Steve, Thor, Sam and Ulysses’ heads inside the booth, the little ones like Peter and Aurora at the front so only their foreheads and eyes were part of the picture. Natasha and Joe sitting on the floor with Tony and Bruce, while Clint and Bucky stood at the back. It was ridiculous and out of this world, but as they posed for each shot, they were happy. And they would remember this moment forever.
He spied a package of corned beef in the fridge and decided to make some corned beef sandwich for lunch. The leftovers, he could make as a stew for dinner tonight. As Steve took out ingredients to start lunch, his enhanced hearing still picked up on the conversation from the living room, despite Steve trying hard not to eavesdrop.
From Tony’s office, Steve and Tony watched the crowd and their family having fun along with them. They have everyone back together again, back where they belonged. Their little family was happy, safe and complete, for now.
“There’s no head injury. I think he passed out from the blood loss,” Joe sighed, “which is even more frightening because it meant that he lost enough blood to cause him to faint, even with his enhanced healing.” He felt the pinpricks of tears starting at the edges of his eyes. It just dawned on him now that he was inches close to losing his little brother. It was now that he realized just how in over their heads Ulysses, him and Peter were.
“The super soldier serum is amazing. On a normal person a wound of this caliber would take at least six months to recover. You did it in less than 3 months, Captain.” the doctor said again.
“I mean,” Steve stammered, “this way you’ll be able to find someone new, someone who fit you better?”
“Welcome back, Captain Rogers.”
Tony stole a look from his perch on the counter at Steve. Steve, a perfect name to go with the perfect man. Adonis did look like a Steve. He seemed to exude that wholesome, boy-next-door, old-fashioned gentlemanly vibe about him. Now if he’s at least bi, then all of Tony’s dreams would come true.
Oooh relationship issues. Yeah, Tony wasn’t gonna be touching that with a ten-foot pole. He surreptitiously tried to scoot away from the couch but Steve caught him. Big, warm hands clamped down on his thighs keeping him seated on the couch. Steve’s glare broadcasted ‘
“Wow, your infatuation is worse than I thought. I’ve never seen you like this before and I was around for the beginnings of your puberty and when you discovered Astronomy. No, he’s talking to Peter again now. But I saw his eyes flickered up for like, 0.05 microseconds. So he must have thought your sorry ass was worth peeling his eyes away from his StarkPad.”
“Not a ‘no’, Anthony. Just, not yet. You don’t know anything about me, and neither I you. What if our initial connection and attraction to each other aren’t enough to sustain a lifelong commitment like marriage?”
“Mmm, that was so good.” Tony hummed. His body was sweaty and the sheets were starting to stick to his back, not that Tony cares. Steve was still trying to catch his breath and slowly lifted his face from where it was hidden in the crook of Tony’s neck to gaze into Tony’s eyes.
“You have two middle names? How come I never knew about this?” Steve asked.
Steve paused from feeding Joe his breakfast of baby biscuits and milk to tune in to his son’s question. “Oh. Why’s that, bud?”
“Of course I don’t mean Thor. You don’t stand a chance with Thor. I meant our esteemed bartender Phil Coulson.” Loki gestured to where Phil was stocking the liquor cabinet at the far side of the counter. Clint followed his line of sight, taking in the sight of Phil. He had always admired the older man, but knew he would have better chance at shacking up with Thor than with him. But maybe Loki was right. Time to seize the moment. Just then, a new person joined them at the bar. The man was dressed immaculately in a grey three piece suit, his medium length blond hair was slicked back and tied in a pony tail. It was Aldrich Killian, coming to once again making an offer on the bar.
“I love you,” he said as he and Tony pulled away from the kiss.
A figure clad in red and gold.
“Loki just made it one, Tony. When he killed one of our own, he declared war on us. And rest assured, he’s not gonna get away with this.” Steve stated gravely. His deep baritone and the conviction in Steve’s voice sent waves of reassurance and comfort to Tony. It was weird and a bit twisted that hearing Steve promised certain death and punishment on someone, but it worked for him.
“JARVIS, call Ulysses now!” Tony bellowed out his command as he frogmarched his two sons into the living room, Steve following sedately behind him. His poor mate looked shell shocked, this was the most unnerved Tony has ever seen him and Tony saw him in the aftermath of Thanos’ attempted invasion of Earth a couple of years back.
“Neither one of us was on the floor much last night,” Steve elaborated. Tony kept taking a peek at the dead body in the bathroom stall. Probably trying to see if he recognized the man if he took a longer look at him. Bucky and Sharon kept looking at the both of them. Their eyeballs flicking back and forth from Steve’s to Tony’s.
“Everything?”
“Will you do me the honor of being my mate, once again? For me to have and to hold, to cherish and to honor from now and until death do us part?”
.” he finished firmly, eyes boring into Sharon knowing what the beta was implying he was doing on the hours when he was alone. There was a tense moment between them, until Steve placed his free hand on Tony’s hands that were clutching his biceps tightly. “Come on. Let’s go, honey.” Steve pulled and maneuvered Tony towards the door. “Thanks, Detectives. Thanks a lot.” He said in parting, directing the last part mainly at Bucky.
“Don’t forget about us, okay Uncle Tony?” Lila peered at him sadly, her brothers at her side. Cooper looked despondent and Nate’s eyes were misty.
Tony sighed and stretched in his seat. It had been four days. Four days of Steve lying motionless on the hospital bed, hooked up to machines monitoring his vitals. They had to operate on the Alpha after he was found on the banks of the Potomac, riddled with bullet holes and suffering from contusions and broken bones. Tony guessed the anesthesiologists was unsure of the dosage to use, since Steve’s metabolism will effectively cleared it out. So they had used too much. On the bright side, they managed to extract all the bullets that the HYDRA operative, Winter Soldier, left on him. But on the downside, it leaves Tony playing the waiting game on when the Alpha will wake up.
Steve leaned his head forlornly at the banister. He thought of his Dad and Bucky’s life. They sacrificed so much of their free time and their lives just to help Steve navigate his way through his memory impairment. He has become a burden on his father and his brother, and he’s not going to be a burden and ruin Tony’s life. Not on his watch. Steve knew this status quo couldn’t continue. The four of them couldn’t keep pretending like Steve was normal and that watching a video in the morning would fix everything. Steve knew what he needed to do, and it was something he should have done a long time ago.
“A tracking app. I’ve placed a tracking chip in the lining of Peter’s suit without him knowing it, I’m activating it now. Sort of like lo-jacking a car to figure out where it went.”
“Perfect. Come on, let’s make out some more.”
“Fury is an officer of the court. He has to report it, right?” Tony said.
“Why are you so adamant with having one-night stands?” she asked.
Should he meet Bucky and let him into his house? And would this be at the expense of his mate and child? Over the short one year after the fall of SHIELD and the establishment of the independent Avengers, Steve’s priorities have shifted. No longer did he held on blindly to the past, but he had embraced the future. Bucky, as his sole connection to the past, was no longer the object of his myopic focus in an attempt to stay connected with the past. Not to say that Bucky no longer mattered for him, but these days Bucky’s absence was more tolerable than before. Now, Tony and Ulysses were his number one priority, followed by the Avengers as a close second.
“Whatever you say, boss.” Quill put his joint back in his pocket. Tony rolled his eyes at the man when Clint asked him “What are you gonna do then?”
The Avengers took the news of his pregnancy complication like it was a threat that needed to be vanquished. Bruce, along with JARVIS, took up the mantle of Tony’s personal round the clock in-house physician, doing everything he could to make sure that Tony and baby were doing fine. The rest of the Avengers were on Tony sitting duty, ensuring he took his medicine and remained on bedrest for the remainder of his pregnancy.
“No, Tones. It’s more than that. I think deep down inside, way way down inside he remembers you,” Rhodey pointed to him, “You. That’s why it’s so easy to fall in love you every single day.”
Enjoy this chapter! Hope it makes up for the heartbreak from the last one :D
Until that one fateful school field trip to Oscorp where everything changed.
When he got to the mansion, the sight that greeted him was peculiar to say the least. There was a giant stuffed pink bunny wearing a Captain America costume on the front yard. Around its neck was a heart shaped pendant that proclaimed ‘Merry Christmas Steve’. Steve gingerly parked his motorcycle next to one of Tony’s numerous Audis and dismounted, looking at the giant stuffed animal in amusement.
“Tony,” Steve sighed longsufferingly, a small smile gracing his lips, “Bonding with you is the greatest pleasure in my life.”
“Nonsense. The baby ups my flirting game and desirability. Don’t tell me you don’t wanna kiss me when I carry him around?” Tony jostled Joe up and down in his arms, eliciting a giggle and a toothless smile from the baby. And damn if Steve wasn’t a sucker for those
“They found Loki. Stark and Banner’s algorithm managed to track him down.” Steve looked back at Tony. Their eyes met in silent conversation on what they were going to do about this.
Releasing his hold of Steve’s face, Tony continued, “Sharon also said the reason I didn’t hear the gunshot was because I was cheating on you.” Steve shrugged, not really surprised that Sharon would tell Tony blatantly about him being unfaithful after her forceful implications at the crime scene earlier this morning. “Well, Bucky thinks that I’m the killer. And he’s helping me get away with it.”
“I told you I’d come back.”
Despite their best efforts, the Chitauri just kept pouring down from the portal. Steve could feel himself starting to tire, and he couldn’t imagine how the rest of his teammates were faring now. He was on the ground, Thor next to him, taking down the Chitauri with their hammer and shield when one of them let off a shot that managed to catch Steve in his abdomen.
Steven chuckled, “Clint wouldn’t mind. He and Natasha are the ones who told me all the sordid stories and tales from Mount Olympus. They think as highly of them as they do a pebble in their boots.”
Well, if that wasn’t the nicest thing anybody had ever said to Anthony.
“Tony…”
Natasha placidly placed her hands over her plastic cup, obscuring the little orbs of tapioca away from Tony’s view. “Thanks. Now I can eat.” he said jovially, tucking in to the spicy noodle with gusto with Steve standing next to him, speechless at what just happened.
“When we were there I sorta kinda got bitten by one of the radioactive spiders they were working on in the transgenic facilities and now I have spider-like qualities…” Peter trailed off.
“Steven, it wouldn’t be a hard life if you’re there with me. Living like a commoner would be of no concern to me, since money and the trapping of wealth are just that: traps and cages. I would be free to be who I am, free to do what my heart desires and free to be with the man I love. It would be the best life I could ever live.” Anthony fervently said. His earnestness embolden Steven’s fervor, and he swooped down to capture Anthony’s soft, red lips in a passionate kiss, catching the prince off-guard before he responded to Steven’s kisses with equal passion, and they lost themselves in the atmosphere.
“We’re not soldiers!” Tony vehemently said. “This isn’t a war!”
“Kid, your parents are crazy.” Rhodey whispered down at his godson, “but don’t worry you have Uncle Rhodey to keep you sane.”
What?
Steve clearly didn’t buy his excuse from the way he looked at him as Tony tried to avoid his gaze. “What you did to Coulson, or tried to do,” he started, “I’ve seen it before.”
“Look, man. My brother don’t sag, slang or bang.” Wilson’s brother broke the silence.
“Can’t imagine why. Ain’t much of a hero if he couldn’t even save the most important person in his life, right?”
Anthony looked at him puzzled. What was he asking? Was he asking for a kiss from him? Well in that case, “Please.” Anthony answered, tilting his head up, eyes closing and lips puckering up to receive the kiss of a lifetime from Adonis when a wrecking sound reached his ears and the heaviness of the chain around his torso disappeared. When Anthony opened his eyes, it was to the sight of his metal chains in disarray, pieces of metal laid on the sand for Adonis had shred them to pieces with his bare hand. “Oh my Zeus, who are you?” Anthony gasped out.
“Wh-- my name-- uh my name is ---”
------
Tony, through the years.
“You ready for another bout?” the god asked.
Steve smiled down at Tony and his new son, his heart swelling with uncontainable love and affection. He beckoned Clint and Bucky to bring Ulysses and Joe to them, to let them meet their newest brother. Ulysses ran toward them immediately, cuddling up to Tony to see his new little brother closer. Clint gave Joe to Steve, the boy now held in Steve’s free arm, as his other one was curled around Tony. Joe’s baby blue eyes took in the sight in front of him, the boy cooing in curiosity at the newcomer.
“You know me too well, platypus.”
“What?” Tony patted his hands down his pants, before realizing that he left his phone in the workshop in his haste to pick up Ulysses from school, “I left my phone down at the workshop. Sorry, guys. What is it? Why does everyone looked like they just found out that they have zero chance of being Nat’s mate?” Tony laughed at his own joke. It’s funny ‘cause it’s true.
Okay, I lied. I have one more chapter as the epilogue :D
“All of you would look very cute as the Powerpuff Girls, Uly.” Tony told him, pinching one of his chubby cheeks. “But I’m afraid it’s not up to me and Papa whether we get a boy or a girl.”
“Oh, yeah.” Steve winced as he recalled the tragedy that was their kids walking in on them when they were having morning sex. Ulysses, Joe and Peter had the bright idea of bringing them breakfast in bed for their anniversary, not knowing that Babbo and Papa were engaged in their own celebration in bed. Without any fanfare, the boys barged into their parents’ bedroom, only to see their parents making like the monster with two backs and promptly screamed in fear, dropping the tray full of breakfast that they cooked, Ulysses scooping up Peter in his arms and grabbing Joe’s arms as they ran away and hid for the rest of the day in their uncles Thor and Bruce’s floor. It was an awkward day for everyone involved. Steve and Tony didn’t dare to look at their sons during dinner that night.
“Uh…” Peter was blanking out on an excuse, “Didn’t she? I thought she did. You know what, maybe it was the adrenaline, the urgency of the situation making everything seem more intense than it actually was-- you know what, now that you’re here I think it’s safe to say that your mom is in safe hands, right? So I’m gonna go, you guys have a good night and don’t forget to move the pepper spray to your new purse, Mrs. Wilde. I mean-- I don’t know your name! Or your last name! Oh my God, I’m outta here!” with that Peter shot a web upwards, the web picking him up immediately and he left the two confused and flabbergasted civilians.
His baby boy was waiting on the sidewalk with the chaperone and his fellow classmates, all waiting to be picked up by their own parents. Ulysses was holding a pile of papers, looking very adorable in his Hulk t-shirt and baby jeans. His face brightened up as he spotted his Babbo’s car. Ulysses bounded up to the passenger door and waited obediently for Tony to open the sliding door.
