“No,” Natasha said simply. “We are done with that now. The slate is wiped clean, you have nothing to apologize for.”
“You want to kneel for a bit while we do that, Phil? You seem like you’re wound pretty tight.” Agent actually blushed, darting a glance over to Tony and then back at Natasha.
“Everyone. Every employee we’ve got.”
If he hadn’t been headed somewhere he adored, Tony definitely would have been late for lunch. He’d split his morning between SI and SHIELD. The former was well on its way to implementing the basics of the mission he and Pepper had drawn up with feverish hope (and hyper-caffeinated blood) weeks ago. The place suddenly felt like it had the energy of a young startup instead of a multi-billion dollar corporation; he hadn’t fully realized how suffocating the place had felt before, even in his own universe, until these past few weeks as it started to teem with life and energy and, yes, the occasional explosion from the general direction of the R&D Department. (Tony would go to the mat for those wonderful nerds any day; explosions were basically a requirement of innovation as far as he was concerned.) For the first time, it really felt like Tony’s company rather than an ill-fitting hand-me-down from his Dad.
She’d stolen it from the Red Room shortly before her graduation. She’d always admired the firebird’s ambiguous role in mythology, had sought to emulate the way its glowing, majestic plumage served both as a blessing and a warning, lighting the way for some while bringing about the destruction of the unworthy. The form of the vase had spoken to Natasha as well; it was painted in the Khokhloma style, a lacquered gold background featuring the firebird, as well as berries, flowers, and leaves in vivid reds and greens. It had felt so inappropriately decadent in the sparse, brutal architecture of the Red Room, and it had been the very first thing Natasha could ever remember really
(See the end of the chapter for
“Nope.” He had popped the ‘p,’ just to be obnoxious, and Bruce gave him what was undoubtedly a pity-smile.
“Why, though?” Tony wanted to know. “Steve would go with you, he’d be way more of a challenge for someone like you. Sir.”
“Bucky? I thought we were—”
“I thought you weren't that kind of doctor.” Bruce arched a brow and made a sweeping gesture at the room around them.
“Yo, Dummy, you wanna argue with the refs or you wanna line up for another round? That is,” Tony added, glancing at Barnes as casually as he could managed, “if you’re up for it.” Barnes beamed, a wide and toothy smile that Tony could never have even imagined on his own version. For a few seconds, the throbbing of his head felt very far away.
Phil was not a man who made promises. If love, as Natasha so often claimed, was for children, then promises were for the kinds of adults who were practically begging to be manipulated, who valued the illusion of assurance over accuracy and truth. They weren’t in the business of promises. He had only ever made one before that day, when he’d recklessly sworn to a young Clint Barton who had been bleeding out in a forest after a mission gone horribly wrong that Phil would bring him home safely. Natasha was the only other person in the Tower who knew that story, who was aware what a promise from Phil Coulson meant.
“You know, I think we might be able to thin it out enough to add it to your web fluid.”
Steve spanked with precision and calculation. Tony had felt it before, with the crop during their first scene, but where that had been delicate licks of pain akin to touching a finger to the flame of a candle, this was as consuming and encompassing as a wildifire. It pushed everything else out of his mind, left him helpless against the grunts and whimpers that escaped his mouth. He couldn’t even manage to count; by the time Steve stopped, Tony would have been equally surprised to learn the set had been three or three-dozen blows long.
“I…can I keep looking at this while you do…whatever it is?” Bruce spared a brief glance toward the holoscreen and smiled.
Bruce stared at the words ‘Infinity War’ and ‘Submission’ for several long moments. Then he gestured to the first, a jerky, imprecise movement that suggested perhaps the Hulk was closer to the forefront than Coulson had realized.
When Steve started to chuckle, Tony halted mid-rant to stare at him, his mouth falling open in wordless indignation, and his already huge brown eyes widening past what seemed like it should be physiologically possible. The cartoonish expression brought Steve to full-on cackles that he could barely manage to breathe in between. Tony just watched him until he could finally manage to stop the spasms of laughter from rocking his whole body.
Steve woke with his hand out, reaching for Tony. For several glorious seconds he kept reaching, wanting to reassure himself with Tony’s sleep-warm skin that that night hadn’t been the end, but the beginning. And then he remembered, recoiling and feeling irrationally, viciously angry. He still dreamed of Tony all the time, but it had been months since he’d woken up and managed to forget, even for a couple of semi-conscious seconds that his lover was gone. (Natasha had been right. It was a damn good thing he wasn’t in the Tower right now, because right this second he hated the other version of Tony for bringing all this up again and threatening the very minimal progress Steve had actually managed to make.)
“It’s too quiet. In the city I could hear it when a neighbour four floors away sang in the shower.”
“You don’t have to be anything right now but mine,” she whispered, like she was reading Tony’s thoughts, like she was inside his very skin. Things went slightly fuzzy around the edges after that; before his brain really caught up, they were out of the tub and making their way into his room. On top of the bed, she had laid out several items; he recognized some of them from his research. The multi-tailed whip was a flogger, followed on its left by a leather paddle. Neither looked particularly harsh compared to some of what he’d seen online. He was a little less clear on what was lying beside it; it was made of bright purple silicone, and looked on first glance like a standard dildo. The cock was flattened and curved on the top in a specific way, though, which seemed to have something to do with the hole that sat atop the base, covered by a pair of…were those supposed to look like rabbit ears?
Bucky squeezed Tony's hand, as gentle and cautious in his touch now as he’d been brutal and unyielding that night on the road when the same metal hand ended the lives of Tony’s parents.
A memory of a bright laugh and dishevelled, surfer-blonde hair sticking up like a porcupine after swimming brought Clint to mind, and Rhodey nodded to himself. Barton had his own issues just as they all did, but he felt a lot more accessible and plain-spoken than most of the others. He sent the message before he could let himself dither about it any longer.
“But he was already more,” Peter protests, the anger that’s been smoldering inside for months not willing to give up so easily. “He had you, he had me and Harley—”
“Sorry. I’ll—sorry.” Steve stood there for several seconds, disheveled and groggy and possibly slightly drunk, then turned around with slightly jerky movements as if preparing to depart the penthouse. Exasperated, Tony grabbed his arm.
“You’re fine, Tony. Your body knows what to do, you don’t have to think about it or do anything to make this happen. Just stay nice and still for me. We’re almost there.” It didn’t feel like they were almost anywhere. It felt like the same pleasurable, painful monotony that it had been the whole time, but sure enough, it was probably under a minute later that come began to dribble from between Tony’s legs.
Eventually, though, there simply wasn’t any other option. Once he’d stopped swigging Asgard’s finest by the mouthful, Peter’s vomiting had eventually slowed, though never fully stopped. But then she started noticing the other effects. His skin was typically absurdly pale, so the hives that were developing were easy to spot. While she noted them with some concern, the real problem came when Peter started struggling to breathe.
“You can touch ‘em if you want.”
“I was thinking about blowing Rhodes’ cover first,” Phil murmured, gesturing to the digital scaffolding on the screen.
“Steve…”
ready to enter into a new relationship with a different version of the man you just started to grieve.”
Someone mentioned last chapter that it felt like the team had been apart for ages, and I kind of agree! I hope their reunion felt good to you all.
“Good. Bruce, don’t bother about information-gathering tonight, you hear me? There are things you’ll need to know from Tony eventually, but don’t let that get in the way of providing adequate care for him now.” Bruce was on his feet before Steve finished speaking, slamming his whole palm against the call button for the elevator even as JARVIS was already opening the doors. With Bruce, and therefore Tony, attended to, Steve focused his attention on the rest of the team. “And it looks like it’s about time the rest of you have a conversation about what it is you’re looking for from Tony, sub or not. If…if he is a sub, though, I’d suggest maybe building on what Bruce did today. Continue to teach him the things he needs to know, but also make that a space to let him experiment, figure out what he wants. And for the love of God do
“When the Princess learned that I was dining with you, she insisted on planning the meal. She wished you to be comfortable, and claimed you would prefer something from your own nation. She would not be talked down.” Steve finally gave in to the urge to snicker, and after several beats of silence, Masdee joined him.
Steve reconnects with his partners while Tony attempts to do paperwork.
. It was the first time since his carefully constructed and heavily fortified mental dams had shattered that he’d felt much of anything beyond the haze of grief and regret and pain. Boredom wasn’t exactly the feeling he would have chosen to take their place, but pretty much anything was preferable to how he’d spent the past couple of weeks.
Natasha was up next, and in true Black Widow fashion she had no concerns about things like honour or fairness. She attempted to come at Tony from behind, her Widow’s Bites sparking menacingly at her wrists. Without ever turning to face her, Tony sent her flying backwards into Thor with two repulsor blasts that emerged from near the shoulders of the suit.
(See the end of the chapter for
Instead of reacting with just anger or jealousy, though, Tony’s mind had offered up the uncharacteristically hopeful thought of not just staying in this universe, but somehow coming to belong here, too. So when his side had twinged a while later, he hadn’t swallowed the involuntary sound of pain down. He’d even told Rogers what had happened, trusted him with the knowledge of another of Tony’s mistakes. And Cap’s response… (Rogers had gone to his knees in front of Tony. This time not as the result of some tragically bad inter-universe miscommunication, but simply because he wanted to help. Wanted it badly enough that easing Tony’s pain had seemed to soothe Cap on a visceral level, far more than anything else Tony had asked of him. For just a few minutes, with Rogers’ hands gentle on Tony’s side, it hadn’t even mattered that this wasn’t really the version of Tony that Cap wanted to save.)
To the team’s credit, they gave him his space. JARVIS would have alerted them to Tony’s arrival, but no one magically appeared by his side or sent him increasingly anxious texts or anything. (Someone, he thought, was probably holding Steve’s phone hostage to make this happen. He wondered if it was Bucky or Rhodey, to whom Steve seemed surprisingly inclined to listen to.)
He tried to edge his way out of the kitchen. It shouldn’t have been hard with so many people, really, but Rhodey had always been good at noticing precisely the things Tony wished he wouldn’t, and he wasted no time in wrapping a lazy but firm hand around Tony’s wrist.
(See the end of the chapter for
The point was, what Tony Stark was doing was decent and all. Peter certainly appreciated his help with the mounting pile of medical bills that had been threatening to swallow May and him whole. He’d also used the rather flimsy excuse of the internship to get them both on SI’s benefits plan, which meant that any future Spider-Man mishaps would be covered. The idea of being able to just walk into an emergency room and get treated when he needed it, rather than waiting with growing desperation to see if his injuries would become manageable without any external interventions, felt like an almost unfathomable luxury. Unfortunately Peter couldn’t rid himself of the suspicion that this was all happening too late. Too late for him to catch up in school. Too late to repair the relationships he’d strained and in some cases broken. And definitely too late to be building something new, some kind of makeshift family, with the Avengers. Sometimes it was enough to make him resent Stark. Why couldn’t he have just stayed forever fixed in Peter’s memory as the larger-than-life hero who had saved his life at the Stark Expo and then flown away, all while letting kid!Peter believe he had been the one to do the saving? Why did Stark have to make Peter hope, when its absence had been the one constant these past few years?
“And you? You’re damn good at your job, Steve. I wouldn’t want to take something from you just because I’m feeling a little unsettled.”
Tony should have thanked her, he knew that. She was as good as promising to keep his secret, to stop the carefully constructed web of lies they’d built from crashing down around them, and he wanted to be grateful. He wanted to feel anything but numb. Rhodey handled that for him though, and asked the follow-up questions Tony’s brain was too staggered to ask.
In the wake of what felt like a shattering of himself, time became a distant, abstracted concept. Tony was vaguely aware of the soiled towel being removed, and Bruce bracing him around the waist to slow his face-first collapse onto the bench. He knew Bruce was speaking, too, but as he didn’t seem particularly surprised or upset by Tony’s general lack of responsiveness. So Tony let himself drift.
intrigued by the results of his bloodwork. I suspect he shall never trust me enough to allow me access to any medical information not made public, and I do try to limit my use of the Time Stone for snooping purposes, but it is particularly tempting in this case. I do think the tie to the Soul Stone is critical in this respect; I suspect that bond is also what made the Soul Stone choose this particular universe to send Stark to.
“You know why he always pushes up against you hardest.” It was a reminder Natasha given him countless times before, but never about this version of Tony Stark. Steve glared.
“Woah, woah, Brown, take a breath and have a seat. You want a drink? Old fashioned, right?” She waved away the offer impatiently.
“Excellent timing, I feared they may not make the call until morning. I thank you greatly, ceiling voice!” Like his own version, Tony had come to realize that Thor was trolling at least half the time when he pretended to be unaware of what was going on around him. This address of JARVIS, to whom Tony had personally heard the man speak on numerous other occasions with easy familiarity, was definitely one of them. Before Tony could tease either of them, Thor had thrown on his cloak and was holding out a hand to Tony. “Shall we?”
“Headspace and endorphins can work in multiple, and sometimes conflicting, ways when it comes to pain. For someone really into pain, or extremely deep into headspace, they might not feel the full extent of the damage until after they’re back down. For others, or sometimes for those less inclined toward pain for its own sake, the body can register it as far more severe than it really is during the scene.” While Tony pondered this, Bruce dipped into his bag and came up with a set of gloves and a small packet of lubricant. “I’m going to give you a quick internal exam, Tony, is that alright?”

“I uh…I guess I thought from what you said that the first scene would be more, I don’t know, involved?” Clint hummed thoughtfully in his ear.
“This is a trap.” He could fear the smirk in Coulson’s voice even as the other man turned his back and began to walk down the hallway, apparently entirely confident Tony would follow.
They find Steve on his feet, holding the shield. Given the violence of their entrance, this is probably unsurprising. He can’t meet anyone’s eyes, though. That’s when Peter knows for sure that what—who—he heard.
He, Peter, had done that. He’d made Ned look like someone seeing the sun for the first time after years spent in darkness. For several short but intense seconds, Peter was combing through every recess in his mind in search of other ways to make Ned smile that way, to keep him
Two weeks after the events of the previous chapter, Talia begins to test boundaries in Wakanda while Tony makes several surprising discoveries in the Tower.
The worst part was that Tony could see all of these machinations as plain as day and they were somehow still painfully effective.
“You don’t have to—”
When he stepped into the living room, JARVIS immediately commenced his usual morning updates; he had always appreciated J’s grounding presence, but particularly after losing the AI in his own universe, and then all sense of normalcy after Thanos, it still brought about a special kind of contentment to hear routine words about the weather and surf conditions. Tony sighed happily and went through through the once-familiar routine of making a French press. It had been ages since he’d had time to indulge himself by preparing coffee this way, and he savoured every mundane second: the quiet hum of the bean grinder, the measuring of the coffee, the increasingly strong, earthy scent as it percolated in the glass pot, it all felt like reclaiming something he thought he’d lost forever. It came, as he suspected most pleasures always would, with a hefty dose of guilt, but even that felt just a little more bearable this morning.
“The Bleeding Edge armour is as close to indestructible as it gets. The nano-machines self-replicate, so as long as their connection to a power source isn’t interrupted or disconnected, they can transform or heal most damage. Everything you see that I haven’t been able to fix yet took actual universe-ending conditions to bring about. So don’t for one second think that because I’m a little more tired and old and banged up than the other me was that I can’t handle what’s coming for us.”

need, what will make you as happy and fulfilled as you can be here. I can’t think of anyone here who wouldn’t give you just about anything.” And there was very little Tony could possibly say to that, but thankfully Bruce didn’t seem to expect a reply. He reached out and touched Tony for the first time since his brief exam, just a clasp of the shoulder, long fingers lingering over the slightly jutting bones there, a small frown pulling at his lips. (Always the Doctor, Bruce.) “I think we both have a lot to think about. I’ll see you later Tony, alright?”
“Yeah. He…they wouldn’t just
Then a flash of memory hit from the night prior (or maybe it had been early this morning, who the hell knew.) Steve had been sitting in the same chair he was now, but he’d been gripping Peter’s hand. All around him it was chaos. Sam had had Bruce on speakerphone and followed his instructions as best he could. Bucky (and maybe MJ, though maybe that was just wishful thinking) were fetching supplies and offering what reassurances they could to Peter. And through it all, Steve sat there, solid and unmoving even when Peter had to cry or vomit again or when he yelled at them all to go.
Video. “The Ethical Robot.” Available
Many of these are areas I have touched on in a previous response, so it may be worth reviewing that material. You can find it here under Chapter Six here on the collected replies (the second answer down.)
Which brought him back to the door in front of him, which had just opened without him ever knocking on it, because Stephen Strange would always be a dick no matter what universe he was in. Tony took one longing look back, still unsure even now if he truly wanted the answers he was seeking, and then stepped into the house.
“They’re so precise,” Tony muttered appreciatively. Clint tightened his grip on Tony’s hand.
“That’s exactly right. That’s exactly why punishments and rewards are so important in a lot of relationships. They’re about reinforcing and maintaining boundaries, but they’re also there to ensure that the submissive doesn’t take punishment into their own hands, and keep extending it past what is fair or reasonable. You trust us to know what’s appropriate when you break the rules we’ve made together, and you also trust us to tell you when that price is paid.” Steve paused a few beats to let that sink in, then got up and made his way around the long couch until he stood directly in front of Tony. “It wasn’t possible, for a lot of reasons, for us to deal with what happened between us all earlier. And if you think it’s been long enough that a punishment won’t be helpful, then I promise you that’s something we will hear and respect. But if you’re still feeling twisted up inside in a way that just talking about might not solve, then I think that’s something you need to put into our hands. What do you think, sweetheart?”
“Oh yeah?”
Steve didn’t have time to take in Natasha’s cryptic news before his own phone was sounding an alert. When he was on holiday, almost all of his notifications were turned off; it took what was classified at SHIELD as a major or significant event to override the revised chain of communication and push a message through.
“It’s not that. I…Tony, I’m not a particularly easy Dominant.”
“What’s that?”
When Tony stepped into his office at Stark Industries, his chair was already occupied by a harassed-looking Pepper. There was a massive paper cup of coffee in her left hand, and with her right she was impatiently pulling the knot she’d twisted her hair into apart. (Headache, probably. The other Pepper had always let her hair down the second she’d started to feel one creeping up.) She gave him a quick evaluative stare and sighed.
This was when something…odd happened. This simple permission to linger, to just take his time with Coulson, it was nothing but words, but it hit Tony with profound, staggering force. Like a puppet with its strings cut, the tension drained from him at once. He leaned forward, resting his forehead against Phil’s groin and lower stomach. He let the heavy weight of Coulson’s cock press against his tongue, his previously focused technique devolving into a slow and aimless exploration. At times Tony was pretty sure what he was doing didn’t even constitute a blowjob anymore, but Phil didn’t complain, or try to direct him otherwise. Every once in a while he murmured soft words, or stroked Tony’s hair. Otherwise he just let Tony do exactly as he pleased.
“He’s aware, yes, if somewhat in denial,” Steve sighed. “Tony’s not quite as viciously opposed to bloodwork now that he's told us about the whole soul stone thing, but it still makes him extremely uncomfortable. But he also recognizes that his feelings on the topic might be clouding his judgement. So he's given me permission to speak with you. We would both value your input. And regardless,” he added spontaneously, “I think you should move fully into the Tower until this is all over. The board has already demonstrated that they're not above threatening anyone’s life, and it’s easiest for us to protect you here.”
That left Coulson. Which…maybe not the worst idea. Coulson’s role as handler for the Avengers had been a mostly abstract thing in Tony’s own world, a taunting reminder of another way the team had gone wrong almost from the very start. Here, though, it hadn’t taken long to realize that Coulson had fulfilled all that promise and then some. Tony had witnessed first-hand how the man’s mere presence was sometimes enough to impact the team, drawing Clint out when he otherwise seemed inclined to retreat, and soothing the more brutal outbursts of Thor’s rage.
“Oh fuck you, I know it’s safe. I made it. Well not me, but, whatever. I think if I call him Mark 2 to you, the way I do in my head, you’ll probably be offended. Hold on…I said that out loud. Damn.” Steve tried not to roll his eyes. It wasn’t that he was against alcohol; when Tony drank safely, and for the right reasons, he was just as funny and charming as ever. But drinking like this made him clumsy and foolish and
The thought of Tony in any kind of altercation with Natasha was an alarming one, but before Rhodey could panic about it for too long, another message popped up.
Davide Valeriani, “Humans and Machines Can Improve Accuracy When They Work Together.”
“Yeah, we were just about to text you that there was a submissive puppy pile going on that you were gonna be super pissed you missed. So fucking cute, right?”
. Because every time I get near you I can’t stop thinking about how with all the things that are different across our universes, in both of ‘em I’m the Winter Soldier, the guy who killed your parents and murdered dozens of others. How can I ask you to trust me like that when I’m really starting to think there’s something just, just wrong with me, at my core.”
“Yeah I know you don’t. What I like best about that part of you is that it’s not just building, what you do, it’s creation. Beings like JARVIS and Dummy, even that ridiculous robot llama you and Clint made to torment the rest of us, they exist and they’re remarkable because you don’t treat building anything like it’s just the sum of its parts. You put yourself—your mind, your energy, your spirit—into the process of making, you give at least as much as you take. I’ve seen a lot in all my time with SHIELD, and that…that’s exceedingly rare.”
“Steve. Steve.”
“Jay, are you…I mean, don’t trigger any kind of alert if I’m not supposed to know or even ask—”
“What happened?” he demanded. She paused. And Natasha…she never hesitated. Not in the field, not in her personal life. The woman considered things carefully, she sought out more intel if she felt she needed it, but she didn’t ever just not answer. He sat up, all remnants of sleep vanished by the surge of adrenaline that coursed through him. “Natasha.”
“You’re already late for Clint. He’s waiting on your floor.” Though the gears of his mind were turning far too slowly, Steve still attempted to search out an acceptable reason to cancel. He’d used injuries from battle last time, and given that he’d barely gotten a scratch in their scuffle with Doom today, that would have been even less convincing now. (He resented the serum more than he was grateful for it these days.) All other threats were currently below even Ultron’s super-sensitive notice. He could have tried insisting he needed to train, but Steve regularly logged more time in the tower’s gym than anyone, and that was on top of his morning runs.
She set the vase down quietly on one of the delicate little side tables, and for a moment it almost looked like she might get away with it. Most of the others were busy painting, or arguing about light fixtures, or, in Clint’s case, gleefully sorting the toys Natasha had bought into piles. (She’d never seen Clint so excited by an organizational task before.)
. He attributed the complexity of the text, which was moving constantly in and out of places and perspectives at a dizzying rate, as well as Gwen’s continued and inexplicable stealthiness, to the way he jumped about a foot in the air when she tapped the cover of the novel.
The extent to which it is likely that Stark will, as you put it, overindulge in his headspace is likely going to be tied to how quickly and how far the subtonin in his system goes on to rise. Currently, he takes a full day off from the submission on Thursdays, and this would be exceedingly rare for a ‘true’ submissive. However, we are already seeing some ways in which his needs as submissive are not quite as intensive. Stark himself noted, for instance, that the aftercare the team provided didn’t feel as urgent as the way it has in the past.
, baked pastries full of cabbage and cheese, accompanied by a borsht soup that she appeared to be trying to teach Clint to make;
Even the distant threat of losing Tony finally seemed to do it for Natasha. Her feet came back to the floor and she sat up straighter in her chair, looking Steve directly in the eye with the kind of intensity he usually only saw during SHIELD and Avengers missions.
He smiled widely and sincerely, though, when his eyes fell upon Peter, who was in the middle of an argument with Butterfingers about whether or not the bot needed oiling. Peter was acutely conscious of what it probably looked like--like he was stepping right into Tony’s shoes, inhabiting his favourite space and caring for his bots, practically just an extension of the man himself. The thought made everything inside Peter seize with cold fury, and he threw the oil can he’d found in Bruce’s lab next door to the floor with a loud clatter.
inspired.) Sometimes, that guy was really alright.
like to critique the way the media talks about True orientations, but this press conference isn’t the time. We don’t want people asking why he’s so much more concerned with mocking the veneration of Trues than enjoying being back with Steve.” Phil didn’t challenge the idea that it was only Cap to whom Tony had been returned. None of them did.
“Rescue Mark I requesting immediate entry, Sir.”
“You’re tanned. I hate you a lot right now.”
Steve watched Sam interact with the team with warmth in his heart —Sam had never been a full Avenger, hadn’t wanted to be, but that didn’t make the shared affection between them all any less real. He’d spent hours joking with Clint and Nat, had had late-night philosophical discussions with Phil and Bruce, and especially back in the beginning, he’d been endlessly patient with Steve’s near-constant confusion about the modern world. Sam fit right back into the rhythms of life with the team as if he’d never been gone.
“I guess you already know who I am and why I’m here. So can we skip to the part where you just tell me what I do?” It was a rather brilliant ploy, in Tony’s opinion. Another version of Strange had kept the fact of his impending death from him, the least this one could do was use his Harry Potter crap to eliminate some of the painful deliberation. So of course, the guy refused.
However, I am also happy to have the opportunity to return to this topic, because I also suspect that in some ways orientation at times is more of an interpretive lens for sexuality than it is a determining force for how such interactions look or feel. Here’s what I mean: take Captain Rogers and Agent Romanov’s scene in the most recent chapter. Aside from a hefty dose of body worship, which is a go-to kink of Rogers’ when he is distressed, there was very little in that reaction that would need to be defined as orientation-based. Even in the MCU Tony’s universe, it would have easily been classified as a fairly vanilla encounter. The main thing making it a scene, then, was that the participants both framed it that way to themselves. Dominants who partake of sex as part of their orientation are used to understanding most expressions of care, including sex, as a part of their Domination, and submissives similarly experience receiving such care as an aspect of their submission. In short, most sex is scene-based not because it necessarily has to be, or even because there are heavy kink elements involved, but simply because that the is the lens through which most people in this universe are socialized to understand most human interactions.
“And now?”
“It usually is,” Sam said, just a trace of his usual wry humour in his tone.
“Right,” Steve asserted.
There had always been an edge to Clint, something slightly wild and unpredictable about the push-pull that was his style as a Dominant. But with everything going on lately he’d been a little softer, gentling his pointier edges and avoiding the kind of tactics that always made Tony feel like he was standing right on the edge of a cliff, unsure if Clint would halt his fall or push him off. He hadn’t realized how much he’d missed this version of his lover until now.
“Contracts, not unlike the ones we have here for non-workplace power exchanges. T’Challa sent over some samples.”
“Colonel Rhodes has indicated that you are not to consume more coffee until you have eaten a full meal and drank a litre of water, Sir. He has used his override commands and if you attempt to turn on the pot I will be forced to shut down power to the outlet.” Rhodey, Tony decided, was an interfering snoop. When he went back to the bedroom, which he’d be doing as soon as was damn possible, he was gonna—
Tony tried, he did. Phil was being just oppositional enough to push all of Tony’s authority-defying buttons; he clearly expected Tony to be unable to do this simple thing, and Tony was nothing if not a man who enjoyed upsetting other people’s expectations. And it was, he knew, a simple thing. What Coulson had said that night had been kind, but it hadn’t been overly effusive or hyperbolic. Somehow, that made it worse. The man staring back at Tony in the mirror, what the hell had he ever done to earn that kind of praise from a man like Coulson? His very existence in this universe was predicated on his own failure in his own. His life now was built on his inability to get the team to listen about Thanos sooner, to prepare. He’d failed to do that, and he'd lost everyone one way or another: Pepper, the team, Pete—
Excellent. I deeply enjoyed this particular vision.
“You’re just somehow the most and least predictable person I’ve ever met. It’s infuriating.”
His cock fucking dripped this time, and his hips shoved upward again. Not a coincidence, then. Tony pressed a second finger in alongside the first, shuddering and turning his head to muffle a moan into his pillow.
. Oh god, he’d…)
“You can do this, Tony. Just close your eyes and lay back against me for a second, okay?” Tony did as instructed, moaning low in his throat when Steve’s hands combed through his hair. “What’s something you want to make, just for the sake of it?”
“Oh for…FRIDAY, can you ask Peter to join us, please?”
“Course we do. Only you and Bruce are allowed to use the particle accelerator without supervision. C’mon, fire it up so we can get going on some more arc reactors, yeah?” Clint was rubbing his hands together and talking about Tony’s particle accelerator with the same unrestrained glee he usually displayed with the arrival of new arrows or pranks against his teammates.
Which was good news, really, and definitely shouldn’t have felt somewhat like being handed a life sentence. And it didn’t stop there. Dr. Chimva glanced at Rhodey, who edged several steps closer to Tony. (Good news never started with a medical professional wanting their patient supported by their loved ones.)
“Together?”
Natasha had all but dragged Steve to bed after he’d wondered aloud how long he should wait before trying to reason with Tony again. She’d been, as usual, entirely right; there had been no real place for orientational dynamics with Tony these last few days, but having his submissive so close by and in such pain without any way of helping him had been torturous. Natasha had allowed him to focus all of that pent-up Dominance on her instead; she’d permitted a far gentler scene than was usually to her taste, and she’d let Steve hold her for hours afterward, and even if it was selfish because Natasha really wasn’t one for cuddling from the submissive side of things, Steve felt dizzy with gratitude to have her small and yielding in his arms.
Yeah, the check-ins were going to kill Tony, one way or another.
Steve was silent for several seconds. Peter braced himself for the well-meaning but largely empty platitudes that would come. Then he almost laughed aloud as he pictured the Captain America from the videos at school sighing heavily and sitting down on a backwards chair.
“And the arc reactor. I know you said it’s just a housing unit now, but whatever you did to get rid of the other one…do you still have some of the same side effects from the original surgery that the other Tony did? Reduced lung capacity? Heart and circulation complications?”
“Yes that
It had taken the team practically no time to notice and accommodate this preference. Tony had cuffs in nearly every colour of the rainbow now, and in various widths and patterns. The case the held them all sat open on top of the penthouse playroom’s dresser. (Yes, Tony had been horribly embarrassed to learn, there had been a playroom like the one in the Malibu house right here under his nose the whole time. It wasn’t quite as comforting as that one, since this one remained unchanged since the previous Tony’s death; the team wanted Tony to help with this particular remodel.) The pair which currently encircled his wrists were bright purple with black hardware, an unsurprising colour scheme given the man who had purchased them, and who was currently sucking Tony’s cock with a skill that Tony’s brain was struggling to conceive of.
“You’re dead on your feet. Whatever you’re doing can wait. And no, to answer your question. Tony is currently doing the worst impression of a sleeping person I’ve ever seen in my life. Even Dummy isn’t fooled. But I’m going to give him the dignity of pretending to believe him for at least twenty minutes before I go check on him.” Pepper nodded, her head falling back against the back of the sofa. “Maybe I should put you in next to him,” Rhodey teased, stealing a swig from her beer. “It makes me tired just lookin’ at you, maybe it would rub off on him.”
The awkward, weighty silence that followed was only broken when Rhodey began a slow descent onto a large, flat expanse of land punctuated by large warning signs bearing US military symbols and several large, nondescript crates
“Oh good, you’re here! I broke a thing. It’s a small thing, really, nothing to worry about. Personally I wouldn’t have even mentioned it, but Masdee has a real thing about honesty. She once made me go back in and change my time card when I had clocked in at work because she caught me playing that TsumTsum game on my phone.”
“Brucie Bear? That you in War Machine? For real?”
“I…yes, I am capable of interfacing with Peter’s AI.” Steve waited a beat, because none of Tony’s exceptionally advanced systems typically needed to be led step by painful step through a process. If anything, they tended to be a bit too intuitive. But FRIDAY was apparently a little on the slow side tonight. (Perhaps Steve’s initial theory of some kind of glitch was not as far off as it had seemed?)
Which was, to be fair, rather the point of the damn daily check-ins. Bruce had explained it the first day they’d done it, calm even as Tony was practically vibrating off the exam bench with nerves.
For how frequently his own Natasha had talked about wiping red from her ledger, the way she’d given her own life to right the series of wrongs that had led to the Snap, he supposed it was unsurprising that this version would take such deep pleasure in her adaptability rather than a set of specific kinks or tools. Part of that range seemed to also mean she could recognize when talking just wasn’t necessary; when Tony didn’t say more beyond a thoughtful grunt, they lapsed into a silence broken only by her quiet instructions about how to move his body, and the gentle ripples and splashes of the water enveloping them.
“Generally speaking, the softer, heavier tails will cause more of a thudding sensation, while those which are hard or narrow provoke more of a sting. Many Dominants will work with both during the course of a scene, because it can be hard to keep enough control over a heavy flogger for longer periods. However, that isn’t a concern of mine, and as I’m quite certain you’ll prefer this style to the other, we’ll start with the heavy flogger and keep with it as long as you need it.”
“Hey now, I was just waiting to see how many variations you would go through before stumbling upon the existence of my first name. After the last coupla days I sorta think we’re there, Talia, don’t you?” Talia flushes again; this time it stains not just the tips of her cheekbones, but also the tips of her ear and in splotches down the side of her neck. But by far the prettiest and most noticeable thing about her expression is the smile that she doesn’t bother trying to conceal. Steve’s chest aches with something that is almost equal parts jealousy and joy, which is the best ratio he thinks could be expected of him right now. (And if the most wounded and tender parts of him also want to warn them, want to beg both Talia and Masdee to jealously guard every second they have together…well, if nothing else it’s proof that Bucky is wrong. Steve doesn’t
MJ’s sense of adventure, it turned out, did not extend to extra-planetary liquor. She poured herself a shot of the vodka she had liberated from her parent’s house instead, hissing at the burn. Peter’s drink went down much smoother by comparison, and he smugly sat upon the coat he’d laid out on the concrete floor like it was a throne. While MJ searched for what she deemed suitable music on her phone, Peter took another two swigs right from the bottle in rapid succession.
“I. Uh.” He wanted to say no, because really the only thing he could think of was so small, but Steve had told Tony he was good, that he was perfect, and he wanted to always be those things even when it was embarrassing. “I wanted to clean you, with my mouth, when it was over.”
It warmed something in Steve to see how willing both of them were to essentially interrupt their date for his sake and turn it into something at least semi-platonic. And God but it was tempting to agree; even the jealousy of watching Tony and Natasha’s flirtatious back-and-forth could end up being very much worth this opportunity to just spend time with them both, cocooned in the warmth and comfort of the Tower and the people he cared for.
“’s goin’ on, JARVIS?”
Tony came almost embarrassingly quickly. The orgasm helped, he could at least feel some of his higher brain functions starting to slowly come back online. But when he fell asleep shortly thereafter, it was with a lingering sense of vague unease.
’ as clear in front of him for several seconds as if it had been burned into his eyelids. Recalling one of his panic-attack exercises (identify objects in the room around you), he cast his eyes about Natasha’s bedroom. Towel on the floor from after their bath; a sweater hanging on a chair that looked too big to belong to Natasha herself; the paddle and flogger on the dresser. Once his eyes found those he couldn’t stop staring, remembering the way Bucky never seemed so peaceful as when he came up covered in marks from a beating, how Phil’s smile was almost incandescent even when his eyes were still red-rimmed with recent tears from a scene.
He wanted so desperately to be good for them, for there to be good memories for them all to cling to if things went south, that he ended up taking it a little farther than he intended. It started with one small lie, a fib really. He couldn’t think of a damn thing to say to fulfill Coulson’s homework, so he googled a list of affirmations, made a couple of quick changes, and sent it off. And Phil was so proud, he kissed Tony breathless when he saw him and he stole all the leftover coffee cake to feed him for dessert. The anxiety was making food damn near impossible to handle, but they were always so happy to hand-feed Tony that he let them do it pretty much constantly, even though it felt like a rock in his gut when the meals were over. Bruce commented happily on the uptake in his food consumption at check-ins, and the knot of guilt and shame drew a little tighter around Tony.
Beyond those tests, which are difficult to predict given by own regrettable ignorance of the intricacies of Wakandan medicine, the most likely variation between the two samples if the MCU version of Stark has not taken on any of the biochemical components of submission will be that his blood will lack the hormones related to orientation (those being subtonin and Dominin, as outlined by Dr. Banner in Chapter 6.) Because, as Banner notes in that chapter, those hormones have a so-called Domino effect on other hormones, their presence or absence in Stark’s blood could conceivably cause other irregularities.
Tony had almost managed to forget about the debacle that had been that morning’s breakfast; Rhodey trying to murder him by making him run with gods and soldiers had turned out to be, if nothing else, extremely distracting. Even moreso had been Rhodey’s praise afterward. He’d been so comfortable claiming Tony as his own, and he’d turned Tony’s grudging participation in their run into a gift he’d given himself and his partners. He tried very hard not to grin on the walk back into the house, because Rhodey’s commitment to exercise should not be encouraged, but he’d had to fight his traitorously twitching lips more than once.
It didn’t even hurt, not now, the memory of another Steve and Bucky attacking Tony, leaving him stranded and hurt in Siberia. Maybe it was the last remnants off sub-high, but he liked to think it was more than that, like maybe when his recent goodbyes hadn’t just been to the people he missed and loved most in his own world, but to the worst of the pain he’d suffered there too.
tell Steve if he forced the issue.
My apologies again if this chapter is particularly iffy editing-wise. Midterm season is rough on instructors too!
“Yessir.”
whole thing?” Peter was trying to sit up in his bed, glaring in frustration at his casted leg, which hung suspended above him by straps. (With Peter’s healing factor, he rarely needed to be in a cast longer than a day. He wondered if Tesfaye didn’t quite believe Tony about the extent of the kid’s powers yet, or if she was using the cast and the kid’s presumption of her ignorance about said enhancements as a way to keep him immobilized. He suspected the latter; she was tricky like that.)
“Yeeah that’s not the way to sell me on not doing something, Romanov.”
“What—why—”
“Sam’s coming today isn’t he?”
“What, like SHIELD agents? That’s so not fair! You said you weren’t going to try to force me to join, or use them to interfere—”
“I know.”
Every simple action on either of their parts caused the exhilarated thrumming of Tony’s system to intensity tenfold. By the time Steve was fucking him, helping Tony ride his cock by physically lifting him up and down on it (Tony was never going to snark on super soldier strength again holy fuck he wasn’t he wasn’t), they didn’t even need anything so base as language. Words would have gotten in the way of how Tony’s entire system seemed to have rewired itself to predict just what would make Steve gasp and thrash and surge with Dominance so intense that it should have been terrifying.
He expected to be taken to the penthouse; Natasha’s updates, while relatively sparse on specifics, had made it clear enough that the team had taken to treating the floor as a common space the same way they had when Tony—their Tony—had been alive. And while seeing the new version of Tony didn’t exactly fill Steve with warm, fuzzy feelings, the dep was bad enough by now that it felt worth a few minutes of discomfort to seek out his team and find someone able to help him through this.
“Breathe, Tony, you need to breathe,” Bruce entreated. He sucked in a breath with blind obedience, willing to do anything to work past this first part, to get to that place where he knew from seeing the others that pain could take a person. He kept his eyes on Bruce, watched Bruce watching him, eyes keen and focused and intensely Dominant in a way Tony had never seen before. “Nat, speed up a little bit. You’re giving him too long to anticipate the next blow and he tenses up all over again every time.” Tony sobbed even as the thumps of the paddle was already increasing in frequency.  When Natasha landed two particularly close together on the crease between ass and thigh, he wailed, the fight going out of his body all at once. There was no need for Natasha to hold him down now, he was lax against her legs, accepting the pain, pulling it in close, inviting it to linger in his deepest places. It could have been minutes or hours that he laid there, the paddle’s brutal dance echoing through the room. When Bruce spoke again, he sounded very far away. “If Natasha has to keep going she’s going to go at your thighs, Tony. It’s going to hurt like hell. Is that what you need?” He nodded, groaned something wordless and primal. His face was almost stuck to the bed from a combination of sweat and snot and tears, but he didn’t care, couldn’t care about anything except getting where he needed to be. Natasha’s hand settled on his back again, joined by one of Bruce’s larger ones, and the paddle connected with his right thigh. He opened his mouth in a silent scream, which became an actual scream when the paddle landed a second, then a third time so close together he barely had time to suck in a breath in between.
Thor’s tongue in his mouth brought Tony’s blurted attempts at some kind of vow to a halt, for which he should probably be grateful. He tasted like processed sugar and more of Bruce’s lemonade (seriously, there was something weird in that stuff, there had to be) and Tony wished that he had a single ounce of energy left to turn it into anything more than a quiet promise. When they broke, Thor smiled and touched his cheek.
Tony stood up. As he straightened his spine, the black gouge the shield had left behind in the suit began to repair itself, infinitesimally tiny pieces of metal weaving and suturing their way across the damaged portion.
May was babbling, and Tony absolutely hated it. May Parker was one of a very select group of people who had never been afraid or in awe of Tony Stark, the mask or the reality . Across two universes she had yelled at him the first time they’d met, and he had always treasured the unique blend of fear and affection her presence provoked in him. Now she was rushing to reassure and apologize, which meant she knew two things: that Peter wasn’t coming, and that it hurt Tony a lot more than he was willing to admit. Avoiding her gaze, his eyes wandered over to the dining room table. The Avengers rarely used it, preferring to eat in front of the television or in the kitchen, but today it had been carefully set with gleaming china and silver cutlery. Tony had dug the stuff out of storage; it wasn’t the fanciest or most expensive set in the Tower, not by far. Tony’s own parents never would have gone for the colourful splashes of painted wildflowers, or the thin gold leaf encircling the borders. But for Edwin and Anna Jarvis, who had saved for months for this particular set after their wedding, it had been perfect. (And yet Jarvis still hadn’t yelled at Tony in his old universe when he’d chipped one of the small dessert plates. He would bet that the crack in one of the tea cups here spoke to a similar lesson about mistakes and forgiveness that Howard Stark, with all his power and privilege, had never managed to convey as gracefully or lovingly as his butler.)
Several members of the team booed Steve for this one; Bucky threw a slipper at his head. Phil just took another swig of his own drink (a martini made with some of Natasha’s stash of Russian vodka) and sighed. Tomorrow was going to be another rough morning.
“How does it feel to be back after such an extended, uh, absence?”
“Tony.” Bucky’s voice again, this time with more of that Dominant command than he’d ever allowed into it before. He dragged his eyes back to Bucky, finding a smirk that was both gentle and cruel. He knew what was going to happen about a second before it did, and he shook his head frantically, because only a few seconds ago he would have said it was impossible, but he knew now that it would work. “Tony,
Steve…Steve felt like he was reacting as two people at once. The first was a Cat-10 Dominant aware of a submissive in crisis. The instinctual response alone would have been enough to raise the tiny hairs on the back of Steve’s neck and curl his hands into fists, even if he knew nothing more than that. And he did, of course, know plenty more than that; he didn’t know much about this particular version of Tony, but it was still, well, Tony. He was alone and hurt and afraid, and if he really was some version of a submissive then Steve had the capability to make those things better. He was
“No,” Steve said simply. He didn’t explain, didn’t apologize or justify his apparent desire to have Tony naked while Steve himself was draped all over by sumptuous, clinging fabrics; whatever hesitation he’d had left had vanished the moment Tony had consented to this, and the thought made Tony’s toes curl and his gut clench. Still, maybe because Tony was a contrary bastard, or maybe because he’d always made a habit of pushing every version of Steve he'd ever known, some part of him didn’t want to go down too easily.
“No, she’s right.” He heard Pepper inhale sharply from where she stood at his left. It was one of the only noises in the room. “I’m not a Dom, or a switch. Or a sub, for that matter. I mean, I’ve fooled around a bit with—listen, the point is, I’m not any of those things in the way I think you mean them.”
Content Notes: Okay, there's a few for this chapter so bear with me. The big one: Steve talks at some length in this chapter about the day that D/s Tony died. While there are no detailed or graphic depictions of violence, it's obviously a depiction of a deeply traumatic event. If you're doing your best to read around the descriptions of loss in this story, I would skip all of Steve's sections in this particular chapter.
“Well of all the spectacularly stupid things I’ve ever seen you do that one probably cracks the top ten. And that’s really sayin’ somethin,’ Stevie.” Bucky didn’t even sound angry. That, Steve had learned over the decades that he’d known and loved this man, was when Bucky was at his most dangerous. Anger hindered him, make him prone to rushing and making mistakes (much like Steve himself.) But when he came at you like this? This was Bucky-the-sniper. Patient, calm, entirely capable of waiting it out, for hours if necessary, just to unerringly locate and exploit a target’s most vulnerable point. Steve had never once come close to beating this version of Bucky; to the best of his knowledge, no one ever had. So he elected to say nothing, making a valiant attempt at reviewing a memo from Natasha about a peacekeeping mission the UN was requesting SHIELD support on. (They could send in Thomas, maybe, he had a strong relationship with the head of the peace-keeping task force. Maybe he could even take Talia in with him. Some experience in diplomatic work with a branch that tended to attract highly-qualified submissives might be good for her…)
These are both excellent queries that I must unfortunately not answer at this time; you may anticipate receiving the information you request quite shortly in the main branch of the narrative.(In other words, you are asking precisely the right questions at exactly the right moment.)
“I just kept thinking if I made enough of them, if they were fast enough, modular enough, powerful enough, then maybe I’d finally be able to sleep, you know?” Tony added. There was a genuine pleading note in his voice, as if he was truly afraid the team might not understand or sympathize. (Maybe even more than when he’d learned of his counterpart’s brutality toward Tony, Steve hated the other version of the team then. Tony had
Before I sit down to write individual chapters, I then outline those to give myself a sense of what the major pieces of those are going to be. So for this most recent chapter, for instance, I knew I wanted to intercut the Steve/Sam Tony/Peter stuff; I also had a general sense of Peter’s background and what to expect from him in terms of the tone of the conversation.
“God, Clint,
Tony considered this for a long time, weighing his desire for honesty against his urge to stay close to Steve, and to not contradict his Dominant. The fact that the former won out was, he supposed, a good indicator that he might be closer to baseline than he’d realized.
Bruce offered this with the air of someone proposing an experiment they have little but academic curiosity invested in, but Bruce had also never been a particularly good liar. Even without the Hulk as a rather dramatic indicator of any strong feelings, Bruce had never learned to affect the polished, smooth shows of disinterest that had been some of Tony’s earliest lessons, nor was he trained in out-and-out deception the way Clint, Natasha and Phil all had been. He wanted this, and badly.
“I…I don’t know what to say to any of that,” Tony mumbled into Bruce’s shirt. He liked orgasms, damn it, and it wasn’t as if he was short on jerk-off material, surrounded as he constantly was by gorgeous people who were somehow just as interested in him as he was in them. The thought that his brain, the part of him he could always count on, would just up and delete information that didn’t mesh with its perception of what counted as ‘good’ submissive behaviour…yeah, that was terrifying.
First, my apologies for taking a while to get this chapter to you. As some of you know I was dealing with some health issues, and I needed to be sure that such a big, important chapter was perfect before I posted it.
In the D/s universe, Dr. Banner and the Hulk have had more time to slowly build a relationship. They are each conscious of one another and remember their actions when in the other’s form, and Dr. Banner willingly transforms into the Hulk with some regularity. The Hulk is considered a member of the team’s relationship, hence his desire to read to Tony as a form of aftercare, for instance, However, Dr. Banner and the Hulk have not and likely will not make moves to combine into a single form or psyche.
“Pretty positive I’m the one who should be thanking you, Clint.” The archer ducked his head, just close enough to the remnants of his submissive headspace to allow shyness to overcome his natural displays of bravado. And Steve could appreciate how beautiful a picture that made, even if his appreciation felt more akin to the distant admiration a viewer might have toward an art object than the visceral attraction he should feel toward a man he’d just spent a very pleasurable evening with. “You were beautiful and perfect for me. Are you sure you had enough to eat? Is there anything else you need?” Clint grinned and knocked their shoulders together.
“That sounds nice. At least you’ll have a couple hours where you’re unlikely to get soaked to the bone because of baby scientists run amok.”
“Yeah, I can sort of get that, I guess. More than I would have even a week or so ago, anyway. Except that before I could ever really get too swept up in that, that gratification, I also kept getting that feeling, you know like I was reading someone else's lines? And I have not a single damn clue if that’s just nerves or if I really screwed something up last night, but I still feel kind of wrong. So to answer your original question…yeah, I don’t know what i need from you right now. I’d love it if maybe just this once you could just give me the answer.”
Stucturally, the scenes alternate between the press conference and the four days prior to them. I have only tagged which is which the first time that shift happens (it felt really clanky to do it every time since some of the scenes are quite short) but let me know if that gets too confusing and you'd prefer it the other way.
“Fine.” Bruce arched a brow and jabbed his pen toward a chart on the wall beside them. It listed pain rankings from 0-10, and had definitely been custom made for the Avengers. Ten listed items like ‘a building fell on me’ and ‘I lost count of the gunshots.’ Five included ‘I’m pretty sure just the one bone is broken’ and, with no other explanation or framing, the name ‘Loki.’ “Look, that’s not fair though. Chronic stuff is different. Like even if something is an eight for me, if it’s always or often at eight then that’s not cause for alarm the same way as it is for something acute.”
Bruce waited a couple of seconds, long enough to see that Tony didn’t plan to argue the matter further. Then he mercifully re-positioned Tony in a seated pose, his legs dangling over the edge of the table.
Another strong, fact-based question. The weeks where I am able to avoid inquiries about Stark’s emotional state remain by far my favourites.
“Sup, Brucie Bear?”
“I’m not upset at all. I’m thrilled, actually. It’s occurred to me more than once over the years of knowing Talia how much she would like both versions of you. I’m glad she’s getting the chance—oh god, Clint found more gumballs somewhere. JARVIS, maybe just write a blank cheque to his dentist would you?”
When Clint had returned without Natasha and they’d seen the hollow, shattered look on his face, Steve had welcomed grief like an old friend. He hadn’t tried to convince the team her sacrifice had been worth it, or that now more than ever they needed to commit to this fight to honour her memory. Natasha had been young and smart and vital and strong and now they didn’t even have a body to bury with dignity. Steve didn’t want to find any comfort in that no matter how courageous her actions had been. He was sick of seeking comfort in the cold, empty arms of loss.
“Say what now?”
“What is the most common texture heard in Quaranic recitations?”
Like all forms of submission, it was a gift that he was offering Steve, one made even more precious for its relative rarity. Certainly any other member of the team would be thrilled to have Clint like this; they definitely wouldn’t be fighting the urge to slip away into their own heads even while working a thick dildo into Clint’s ass the way Steve was.
“He—it’s fine.”
“Ladies and gentlemen of the press, we stand before you today with news we never thought we would be fortunate enough to share.” Dr. Domen was seated in her usual chair. Her back, which faced Steve, was poker-straight, and though he couldn’t see her ever-present tablet from this angle, he was certain that was what she was using to view the footage from the press conference. (He’d known this was likely to be a bit of a rough session, but clearly he hadn’t anticipated exactly how high her level of frustration with him was going to be.) He made a quick stop in the kitchen to pick up a bag of lemon squares he’d bought on his way back from his morning run and set them on the coffee table between them. Domen’s only response was to increase her tablet’s volume.
“Uh oh, even the other weirdo doesn’t want to be paired with you, Penis. Do you think it was the smell that finally got to her, or did she realize that you’ve been getting by mainly on luck so far?”
They spent the rest of the day together. Tony drifted in and out of sleep a couple of times, and they watched some goofy television while Clint put a heated shoulder pad on Tony’s upper back and shoulders to ward off any potential strain. They were in the middle of a debate over what to order for dinner when JARVIS’s voice cut through the room like a blade.
“How is the hospital responding to the new orientational labour laws?” Rhodey asked as he spooned himself another helping of beets. “It’s definitely been a challenge for some branches of the military.”
“The Howard in this universe manipulated the Soul Stone too.” At once, the relieved jovial air was sucked from the room. Steve’s hand stiffened in Tony’s to the point of near pain, and then it dropped away altogether. “It wasn’t…he wasn’t like me. From what I can tell Howard and Maria Stark had no problems conceiving. But Howard’s feelings about orientation, I think they were way more intense than anyone realized. He considered the very idea of orientation, especially really intense Dom/sub bonds, repugnant—in his notes he called it the ‘triumph of base childish dependence over reason and strength.’ He found the stone when Maria was pregnant, but he didn’t seem to understand it half as well as the other version did, and he tried to use it to manipulate your—the other Tony’s orientation. From the very little I could dig up about what this means—Thor, buddy, I could probably use your help, I think most of what your Tony had on this came from you or your resources—his soul was damaged by the attempt. That’s why….that’s at least part of why his orientation was so hard for him to come to terms with, and it was probably the source of a lot of his emotional instability.”
“Go. Give him a kiss for us. And try not to let him stay up
Everyone else reacted with the overtrained instincts typical of them; Clint, Natasha, Thor and Bucky all drew weapons (a chopstick, a gun, mjolnir, and another gun respectively); Bruce stood and backed up several feet, trying to keep the Hulk at bay while the others ascertained the nature and threat-level of the sudden intruder. While temporarily pinned down by the body on top of his own, Phil made a valiant effort to grab for the gun holstered to his ankle. Steve was the only one who didn’t, couldn’t, move. Because he knew that face, the lines of that body, would know them anywhere.
“You’re leaving? I heard Barnes telling Wilson last night—Tony did all this to save the world, to save your fucking friend for you, and you’re just LEAVING him and everyone else? Fucking off to the forties to live happily ever after?” If Peter kept landing blows against Steve’s arms and chest with this kind of force, there was a not improbable chance he’d end up hurting himself; reluctant though he was to use his own strength, he rolled them over and pinned the boy’s arms to the floor above his head. “He would have done anything for you, you fucking asshole! You left him half dead in Siberia and he still would have done anything!”
“Is it bad? To be a sub like Marnie?” For a long time Howard didn’t answer. And he did have a tendency to ignore questions he thought were beneath him, so Tony had already accepted it and moved on to thinking about something else when Howard sighed and put down the soldering iron he was using.
“We should print that one.”
“Yes.”
Phil had returned to the penthouse with all of the items Natasha had requested. In seconds he’d been kneeling on the pillow, a warm brown collar wrapped around his throat. Then Natasha had opened the ornately carved wooden box she’d asked for and retrieved a handful of what looked to be metal spheres. They were just slightly smaller in circumference than a standard watch face, but Natasha’s hand dipped under their weight in such a way that suggested they were quite heavy. (That ruled out silver and steel, then, unless the latter was heavily reinforced with something. Maybe adamantium?) She had looked at Coulson in askance.
“The Maria Stark Foundation benefit,” Steve read aloud. “What about it?”
As always, thank you so much for your comments and kudos! <3
“I’m the reason your Dominant has a perpetual headache,” she volunteered cheerfully, which startled a reluctant laugh out of Tony. The easy way she claimed Steve as Tony’s also made the knot it in his gut relax just slightly. Then one of the beads at her wrist flashed, and Tony was reminded of an almost unreal tech he’d only managed to catch glimpses of during the final battle in his previous universe.
“Green!” Phil gasped, ever a sucker for just a glancing reminder that the man topping him was also Captain America. It was something they had to be careful with; in headspace, Phil was incredibly sensitive to anything that could be construed as critique when it came from his childhood idol, so no shades of Cap could enter their play if punishment was involved. And Steve himself honestly had little interest in bringing that part of himself into orientation-based play very often. For him, it was mostly a joy to leave Cap behind during scenes. But ‘old-fashioned’ had come to be a kink of Phil’s, a nod to everything he loved and valued about Captain America, and he also adored simple implements that would have been available to Steve in the 40s.
When he took a long inhalation, it felt easier to draw in a full, complete breath of air than it had since before Siberia. He eyed the spot at Coulson’s feet again.
“Mmm that’s better. Stay with me, sweetheart. Now I realized that even when you’re a good, perfect boy during a scene, there’s one point where you almost always start to fight your Dom a little bit. Know what it is?” The idea that he hadn’t been good, that he’d been disobeying his Dominants without even realizing it, was enough to make Tony’s eyes sting. He shook his head. “It’s right when you’re about to come. Now, people say all kinds of things when they’re near orgasm so I wasn’t inclined to read that much into it at first. But the more I thought about it—not just the way you fight coming, but the way you were denying yourself orgasms long before it was even something we would have considered asking of you as your Dominants—the more I started to feel like something else was going on.”
Your second is a complex but extremely important question. The first thing we need to do to answer it is tease apart sex and orientation. While they often go together, it is also very possible for orientational needs to be met in non-sexual ways, and vice-versa; indeed, just like in our own universe, some in the D/s universe prefer sex never enter into their interactions, orientational or otherwise. As to what those without the resources to hire professional Doms or subs do, most workplaces and government agencies have funding available for such instances; because orientational wellness is recognized as a fundamental component of health (and because, as noted above, sexuality and orientation are to some degree able to be treated separately), such practices do not carry the stigma often associated with sex work in the senses that are more familiar to us. (This is not of course to say that these stigmas an associated prejudicial violences are appropriate, of course!)
Sam was silent for a few agonizing seconds where Steve wondered if he'd managed to overstep. Then he brushed the sand off the seashell and slid it into his pocket.
He distantly heard JARVIS say something to Tony. Tony fired back a barrage of questions fast enough that Steve might not have been able to keep up even had he not been dropping. Oddly enough, though, feeling a bit foolish in comparison to Tony and JARVIS’s rapid exchange of ideas brought the first real sense of relief. (This was still Tony, still the beautiful, brilliant man he loved. Steve hadn’t broken him.) The next distraction came when Tony spoke to him, and this time Steve was aware enough to really listen.
“Tony has asked to spend at least part of the day gagged,” she explained, as if there was nothing remarkable or even particularly noteworthy about that request. “He is exhausted in every possible way, and he has asked me to provide him with the opportunity to be silent. We both realize there is a lot to discuss, but as we have the luxury of spending a significant amount of time together in the coming weeks, there is no reason to rush those conversations. If you don’t think you’ll be able to stop yourself from pressing him for information today, then I’m going to ask one time and one time only that you excuse yourself.” No one moved or spoke, and after making eye-contact with each of them, Natasha seemed satisfied that her instructions wouldn’t be ignored. She turned her attention back to Tony. “Do you want to be naked or clothed?”
Since arriving here Tony had rarely had cause to feel jealous, at least not of the D/s stuff.  Mostly it sounded like an incredible amount of work, not to mention the unfathomable level of trust something like that would require to function properly. But there was nothing but complete admiration and love in Natasha’s voice as she spoke about Phil. No judgement, no superiority, no condescension. Not even that air of secrecy that he had always figured was just a permanent aspect of her voice. For just a moment he couldn’t stop the surge of jealousy that accompanied the realization that maybe they’d truly felt that way about the other version of him, too.
The whole thing felt silly, like middle-school level shenanigans that were supposed to end in a pillow fight or a long talk about crushes and Frenching. But he marched obediently to his room anyway, dumping the entire box unceremoniously onto the bed. It wasn’t until he was removing the almost perfectly-tailored suit and trading it in for a pair of soft jeans and a long-sleeved green v-neck that the relief of so literally stripping away the Mark II facade and replacing it with something he himself had chosen really hit. With her usual sense of unnervingly perfect timing, Natasha knocked on the door several seconds later, bearing an open box of watches much as she had the night of Tony's birthday party. The price tags were still on all of them, probably to reassure him that they were new. There were seven in the box, a number that didn’t seem like a coincidence. (One from each member of the team.)
“Peter? The hell?”
“I thought…” He trailed off, unable to bring himself to demand to be made helpless. Clint shook his head.
“No.”
“Her name is Rescue,” Tony insisted with more energy than Steve even assumed he had left. When no one disputed the title, he gave a command sequence and the blue and gold suit abandoned its post and marched its way towards the elevator. Pepper sighed in relief, smiling tiredly at Phil as he made his way over to her, saying something about helping ensure the guest rooms were prepared.
been on the agenda.
Tony outlined the whole harebrained scheme, the dating and the subbing lessons and how they intended to try to keep things separate. He didn’t mention the kneeling, or the…whatever had happened with Bruce the other day, but Rhodey had always been good at reading into the edges of Tony’s pauses; he got as much from silences as he did from Tony's most rambling sentences, and if anything the emphasis on communication in this universe only seemed to heighten that particular superpower. Before he got himself (or Bruce, because he had a feeling Rhodey would not be pleased about how that whole thing had initially gone down) in trouble, Tony switched gears.
The prospect of coming a second time was downright alarming. He could already feel this one building, knew from the force of his thighs shaking and the breath punching its way out of his lungs that it would be shattering. He shook his head, tugging fruitlessly at his bonds and whining out wordless protests, but Clint didn’t stop, wouldn’t even slow down and let Tony catch a breath. When he did come Tony screamed, which he had never done outside of feigned displays during encounters he suspected were being recorded. Clint kissed him, swallowed the sound with totalizing possession, like even that noise was his to consume.
making major, life altering decisions directly relevant to his care,’ she also didn’t belabour the point once she’d made it. Instead, they moved on to discussing Steve’s progress, and how he intended to maintain focus on his recovery even while his time with Tony would greatly increase.
“I was hired on a nine month contract, Steve. This is standard for grief counselling, and it is something we discussed in our first meeting. I’m not entirely surprised you don’t remember, you were quite occupied with trying to pretend you weren't falling apart at the seams.”
I originate from the so-called MCU. I cannot yet share how I have come to access information from Stark’s new home universe, but suffice to say for now that my counterpart and I have come to an understanding of sorts.
The armour took two steps passed the workshop door and then opened. Pepper stepped out of it, an avenging angel in a flawless Armani suit, and even though she stumbled slightly as her heel caught the edge of the boot it was still going to go down as one of the top ten entrances Tony had ever seen.
“James is here, Tony, remember? That’s fine with me if it’s okay with the two of you, but I just want to be clear since we haven’t had much of a chance for an in-depth conversation about his role yet.”
“So, um, Phil’s punishment is finishing the homework and other writing stuff under his supervision. What’s yours, Bruce? I don’t  do so well with anticipation.” Bruce smiled and knelt down, too, so that Tony was bracketed on both sides.
tonight! And the data Jane was pulling up, what you can do to wind and precipitation, and that’s not even to mention the Bifrost! I mean sure, seeing it in person would be cool and all, but tonight it talked to me in my own damn language. I’ve seen the science of it now, and Jane’s going to show me more, and—and I’m babbling,” he concluded. For his part, Thor seemed neither bored nor annoyed as he removed his red cape and set Mjolnir down on the floor next to the coffee table.
“Exactly. He’s given us permission to help him explore and a few places to start. He makes no promises about where that exploration will lead, and if any of you require more solid information before deciding to proceed with a relationship with Tony then that’s fine, but you need to tell me now.” The room was silent, except for the sound of Thor taking a poorly timed bite of an apple that made several of them laugh nervously.
Content Notes: This chapter involves Tony dealing with both Bruce and Phil's non-physical punishments. Neither are easy for him take, but are well within the limits they've all established.
Tony hadn’t seen Bruce put a towel down, but when he wrenched his eyes open he found it, thick heavy and white and situated directly underneath Tony’s groin. He made a wordless yowling sound, a release of humiliation and arousal and primal, encompassing need. Bruce just kept up that same, steady even as Tony’s legs and arms began to shake, threatening to buckle.
“You can,” Steve vowed, tightening his hold on Tony’s dick and starting to work it, focusing on the head with ruinous twists of fingers. “You can give this to me, Tony. Give me everything. I’ll catch you, I promise I will. Just let go.”
‘True’ in my writing—see my bio and/or published work for more information) prior to his death. While sympathetic toward this violation of his privacy, many (including myself) were inclined to read his having concealed the information in the first place as a sign of shame or other orientational ill-health.
“If you’re done glaring at me, Tones, I can tell you my plan for the day?” Tony rather thought the whole point of this was that the planning was up to him, and he was too tired and heartsick to not say so directly. Rhodey leaned back in his chair and sighed heavily. “Yeah, I know you need time to yourself to figure shit out, but Banner was right. We gotta balance that against the things your body and your head need to stay right. Since sex ain’t an option for us,” Tony wrinkled his nose, and Rhodey laughed in agreement, “I gotta do the things I can to help keep the submissive parts of you happy. So your mornings are gonna belong to me. We’ll eat breakfast, we’ll get some exercise—don’t bitch, you got cortisol wreaking all kinds of havoc on your system and exercise
Pepper sighed, cycling through the other open holoscreens so fast it made Steve dizzy. She finally landed on the team calendar. There was, as far as he could see, nothing particularly interesting about it. Steve’s therapy sessions were marked down, as were everyone’s days at SHIELD, as well as some key deadlines for Tony’s various projects. She pointed a perfectly manicured finger at a date just over a week away.
“No way. I mean, he does have some pretty cool chairs. There’s this one that’s hooked up to a gaming system that he modified for Hawkeye, it’s so cool, but he’s still an adult, you know? Not to mention the big boss guy of SHIELD. There’s only so much he’s willing to let me in on. I still need—”
“Not a but. More of an or. Or you could stick it out for Peter just a little longer, help us get him settled back in here with minimal anxiety adding to whatever else that Asgardian stuff—”
“No,” he said, as if speaking it out loud might make his refusal to let his mind go down that particular avenue might make it more powerful. “I can’t. No.”
The Doctor might be a little put out, but I’m absolutely thrilled to get more questions!
Bruce started the same way he always did, stretching his hand out flat across Tony’s back. Without even a verbal cue, Tony’s breathing slowed and started to deepen in response to the touch. He felt his spine lengthen and his hips sink into a more natural arch.
“Got that right,” Bucky agrees. He pauses a few feet from the door, super-soldier hearing picking up something. Peter hears it too. A voice, one he knows is familiar but which his brain absolutely refuses to acknowledge. (It can’t be.)
“Well if it’s such a goddamn
“It became less of a habit once the connections were established,” Phil added, “but I think it might really help in this case. So that we can keep getting to know you apart from whatever preconceived ideas we have about who you might be. And vice versa. We’d obviously be confined to the Tower for now, but that won’t always be the case.”
“Peter, I am not discussing this now! Get the hell out of there and to the Tower or I’ll send a suit to retrieve you.”
“I don’t know,” Rhodey cuts in. “Tones got really fuckin’ rambling and anxious whenever we stayed on that topic for too long. But he gave me the broad strokes; guy got the stones, snapped his fingers and half of everything living was just…gone." The silence that filled the room at that news spoke volumes; whatever else the Avengers were, they were rarely a quiet bunch. But what was there to say to the idea of death on such a horrendous scale? It dwarfed even the worst of Steve's experiences, both in the War and the future. "Whatever he—well, they, I guess, the team was with him—whatever they did that he ended up here, it was part of a bigger plan. He seemed positive it was the only way to change it back, make things right again.” For the first time, Steve felt an odd rush of sympathy for the other version of themselves. No world with Tony absent from it could ever be considered
“Bit impatient,” he observed. Tony had no response to that other than to think ‘of fucking course,’ but he quickly realized the remark hadn’t been intended for him. Bruce was speaking almost like Tony wasn’t there at all, or at least didn’t need to be addressed directly. And fuck if that didn’t
Tony, while tactile as all hell, was not usually a hand-holding guy. It was challenging to keep his hands still at the best of times, and hands that held could so easily and quickly turn restraining or even violent. But hearing Steve allude to the work he’d willingly done to make space for Tony in his life and his mind and his heart, it made Tony a little more willing to be the one looking back a little. He let himself fantasize for a moment that they were back in Steve’s time, that Tony was just a fella out for a burger and a malt with his best guy. He threaded his fingers with Steve’s and Steve beamed, something sweet and guileless and maybe even a little shy. When he glanced down at their joined hands and noted the watch at Tony’s wrist (buttery, warm brown leather and a clean, simple face), the only one in the box Tony had never worn before tonight, that smile grew even wider and toothier.
Bucky and Sam sprang into action pretty much immediately after that. Steve was halfheartedly participating in their extremely thorough search of the compound, still somewhat in denial that any of this was happening. Then he stopped mid-stride and slapped his own forehead.
“I was not in direct contact with Stark, but my counterpart was. He is, by all accounts, as well and healthy as one could expect.”
He hadn’t counted on Pepper being the first to do so, although he should have. She showed up to a meeting that was supposed to be about wardrobe for the press conference and declared,
“Oh, Ca—Steve, hey!” he called in a far different tone once he noted Steve’s awkward presence. “Wanna be the tiebreaker? Natasha has no appreciation for the finer things—”
“You know, I don’t think it was,” Steve opined. “I’ve let the lot of you sit like this basically non-stop since we agreed to take a break with Tony. And look, I get that it’s awful, alright? Waiting is not any of our strong suits, and waiting without having any sense at all of what’s coming is a special kind of agony. But enough is enough. Sitting here pining isn’t going to bring him back, as you all reminded me not so very long ago.”
“But those hormones, I mean, what do they actually do?”
her.” Had it started as early as that? Even Steve hadn’t realized. But increased empathy, bordering on fixation about ensuring the happiness and wellbeing of all familiar submissive was one of the earlier signs of Dom-dep. “I am unclear about the exact extent of your relationship with her, however, so I was not sure I was correct until today, when Captain Angzata told me he appeared to have woken you when he delivered your lunch trays.”
“I’m way too turned on to think strategically,” he declared, though Steve suspected it had a lot a more to do with knowing that his alternate self had played a role in bringing genuine harm to Tony. Bruce agreed to Hulk out, but his green counterpart had zero interest in sparring with Tony.
“Hey Pete?” The kid stopped in his tracks, allowing Steve to catch sight of the fraying backpack he wore. The mask to the Spiderman costume was stuck in the zipper. “Tell your aunt soon, okay? If you accept it, the job is going to start after the holiday break and I don’t want to lose a perfectly good intern because of any drama coming out of that.” Peter didn’t speak or even turn back around, but Tony nodded as if he his words had been acknowledged and then watched until the elevator doors glided smoothly closed.
For a guy so frequently reminded that he was out of time, Steve felt like he was swimming in the stuff these days. The future he’d fought so hard to preserve was here, laid out before Steve in an endless expanse of unsoiled promise. (He hated it. Hated everything about the idea of a future that didn’t include Tony Stark.)
“You’s braking process covered the least amount of total distance,” Butterfingers and Dummy both made a near-hissing noise Tony had never programmed into his own versions, “but taking into account their respective speeds when the halt was called, I would declare Butterfingers’ braking the most comprehensively efficient.”
“That’s not…I made my choice,” Tony said as he laid a hand on Thor’s bicep. It felt unbelievably good to touch someone after days of pulling away from everyone around him. “I love the kid, but he was really one of the only things I had back in that world. Now that I know what it was to lose him, I couldn’t…if I’d gone home I would have been terrified every time Peter stepped outside his door. I definitely couldn’t have handled him being Spiderman. I would have made his world smaller and smaller for the sake of my own comfort, and eventually he would have resented the hell out of me for it and he would have been right.” Thor’s head bowed, his long hair curtaining his face. “I mean it. Whatever else happens here, I’m not—I am in this for the long haul. You’re mine, all of you, and I’m yours if you’ll keep having me, and —mmf.”
The team moved around them with perfect coordination. Some of the circumstances might be glaringly different, but the general dance of coaxing an overextended Tony into allowing them to provide his basic needs was far from a new one. While Steve steered Tony into the nearest kitchen chair, Bruce and Clint got to work on food. There were no leftovers from the beef barley soup of earlier (probably for the best, soup could be a challenge when Tony was clumsy from exhaustion), so they began assembling and toasting a simple grilled cheese sandwich on gluten free bread and a bowl of Greek yogurt with honey. With quiet directions from JARVIS, Thor was putting together a smoothie to accompany the meal; Steve was relieved to note the hefty spoonful of protein powder that went into it. Natasha had disappeared into the penthouse bedroom, probably to make preparations that would streamline getting Tony clean and in bed.
Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad? Liz was always kind to Peter, even after his already poor reputation had started to plummet. Sure, his chances of getting the date he’d once dreamed of were nonexistent. Not only would she never look twice at him that way, but Peter could never be with her when he couldn’t tell her that he knew that her Dad’s sudden absence from school events was not due to business travel, but because he was awaiting trial for stealing and distributing alien weaponry. But that didn’t mean they couldn’t be friends, right?
“That’s not for me to decide, Tony. None of the options I believe you would select cause universe-ending devastation, and beyond that kind of threat I have no desire to shape the course of your destiny.”
His agent was, however, visibly flourishing in Masdee’s company. Steve had seen hints of this side of Talia—dilligent, eager to please, respectful—but usually only for minutes or even seconds at a time, buried as those traits tended to be under displays of defensive posturing. Masdee, though, drew these things from Talia seemingly without effort or thought. Even in the face of legitimate temptation to do otherwise, Talia had respected Masdee’s authority over how matters would proceed in Wakanda. She’d been visibly pleased, twice now, to receive verbal or non-verbal praise. And unlike at SHIELD, where such behaviours often accompanied by a visible internal struggle on Talia’s part, she appeared utterly at ease with herself. She may, Steve realized, have even been smiling slightly as she thumbed through what he knew to be a thoroughly depressing account of Kaikara and Ochen’s childhoods.
“But that’s the thing, man. He isn’t yours. Tony Stark is my best and closest friend, in this universe but more importantly in his. Same with Pep. He’s working hard to learn how to be here, to play the part, but he deserves to have his own history and experiences respected, especially in a moment of crisis. He doesn’t want you right now. He won’t let himself grieve and feel openly if you are. So if you care for him at all as a person apart from his resemblance to the man you used to love, for now you gotta let him be.” There was a thud that Tony initially feared meant Clint and Rhodey had come to blows, but there were no follow up noises beyond Rhodey calling Clint a ‘fucking idiot,’ so the archer punching the wall seemed the more likely source.
Specific notes for the sex itself: Tony has a strong emotional response to tantric massage. This is actually pretty common, and is not a sign of any emotional distress on his part, but if you want to avoid it, skip from when Phil and Thor enter until the send of that section.
“Bit of carpal tunnel? Or just jumpy?” How had it never occurred to Tony how intimately someone like Clint, or Natasha too, would have to know the human body in order to do what they did for a living? Why did thinking about how many ways Clint could bring about both harm and pleasure make Tony’s gut tighten?
“Gonna try to ignore me, punk? I can do this all day, ya know. I mean, would I rather find our sub and—”
“Six—no, maybe five.” If Tony was using the same scale they all did then there was no reason at all for Bruce to look so pleased as he recorded this answer. But Steve had learned his lesson about unwanted interruptions during Bucky’s check-ins; Bruce had zero compunction about kicking any one of them out for interfering with the process. Check-ins, he’d told a furious and protective Steve more than once, were the submissive’s time. They were an opportunity for the sub to make sense of and process anything they were working through, whether it be a health problem or a scene that had left them feeling confused or conflicted; beyond the questions Bruce needed to ask to keep them healthy, the sessions weren’t supposed to be about any Dominant and their needs at all.
Dr. Strange replied:
“Shut the feed down, Jay.”
“She’s right, people are going to expect it.” The words sounded like they were being wrenched from Cap…from Steve. Like they cost him everything he had left, and Tony was not going to be the one to ever make any of them sound like that ever again.
As for Stark’s food issues (CW for disordered eating, forced overeating and starvation), I shall share this directly since I doubt he will ever be able to spell it out clearly for the Avengers. Life as the child of a wealthy, popular family in the 70s and 80s meant that Tony Stark was frequently provided with multi-course meals too rich and plentiful for a child. However, ‘politeness' dictated that he clear his plate. Since that point, Stark developed a disdain for large, sit-down meals, preferring to ‘graze’ or avoid eating altogether, particularly during periods of high stress or emotional turmoil.
Steve reacts angrily to Tony near the end of the chapter. Tony is in no danger, but obviously doesn't have the best history with angry Steve, so he's on his guard.
…she drew him out into an industrial area. Alone. The rest of us had our own fights going, and he had called Rhodes for backup but he was still twenty minutes out. She had hacked the comms so we could hear the child screaming, crying, begging for help. Tony went in, he had eyes on the kid on the ground floor of this abandoned warehouse. He flew in, tried to pick her up. She faded to nothing in his hands.”
“The sooner you quit with that, the sooner we can really start, sweetheart. You tell me when you’re ready.” Steve didn’t sound angry, or even particularly surprised. Tony could see the outline of his cock, more than half hard, in his slacks, but Steve spoke with patience and understanding, like he knew why Tony couldn’t just go down without a fight and didn’t fault him for it, even though he clearly had no intention of losing. That tone made him feel way more naked than his lack of clothes did, and he glared up at Steve.
“I’m going to need one or both of you to explain. Quickly. Simply. With minimal snark and maximal clarity.”
Steve was very, very screwed.
He did turn it, and things got so much worse. There was a different sketch, this one of a circular orange object. Underneath, in printing so messy it took Tony close to two minutes to decipher, Howard had written ‘The God Stone.’ The next page elaborated on this rather melodramatic title, which turned out to perhaps not be nearly dramatic enough.
“The thing is, his cortisol is high enough that I don’t think four days with no headspace at all is a good idea.” Steve gestured to the two men next to him, already regretting what he knew he needed to say.
“I know we have to talk. I know there’s a million things, I have to…I have to tell them about Peter, and we have to figure out where we all go from here,  and I just—Nat, I can’t. It’s possible I’ve cried more in the past few week than I have for the rest of my life. I don’t want to have to feel anything or say anything more,” he confessed, sure he was in for yet another well-deserved lecture about the value of open communication. Instead, Natasha nodded.
“I’m really okay,” Tony informed them for at least the fifth time in thirty minutes, hunting for his spot welder. By this point he normally would have employed one of the bots in his search, but all three of them were aiding other members of the team. “I’m not gonna…drop, or whatever.”
You know, one of the things I swore I would never do was end a story with a wedding. Nothing against marriage, it's just not really my jam. But I ended up falling in love with the idea that while superhero stuff so often falls into tragic tropes and archetypes, that this particular narrative would end the way all classical comedies do: with a wedding.
The Avengers did, occasionally, still manage to surprise Phil. Like when Clint managed to get through a mission without declaring that something ‘looks bad,’ or Natasha allowed herself to baldly demonstrate kindness in a way she doesn’t typically outside of scenes.
Tony set a second mug down next to his own, filled them both, and slid one across the island to Clint before climbing up to sit next to him. (It still came as a shock, sometimes, to realize how deeply they all missed their Tony. Steve wore his own pain with such naked constancy that it was comparatively easy to forget that the loss had been more than just Cap’s.)
“Nonononononno,” he sobbed, frantically scrabbling for the very last semblance of control he had left. The strap connected again, dead centre. “I’m sorry, pleaseplease I’m sorry.”
Didn’t mean Steve had any interest in following them, though.
“J, what the fuck? I thought you said I had credentials to keep the team out of here until the medical protocols kick in at hour thirty. We’re nowhere near—”
Peter finally gets to experience the usual pains of teenage life in the form of romantic confusion. Tony struggles with allowing his partners to be involved in his relationship with Peter.
Natasha and Tony date and scene, to the confusion of the media and general public. Steve faces the wrath (but not really) of Dr. Domen, and reconnects with an old hobby.
One character (not Tony) also makes use of a safeword and leaves the scene. This happens for their own reasons, not anything to do with the scene itself going wrong, but still might be worth giving a miss if any of these are trigger areas for you.
“…well, the girl at the front desk asked me out the other day, and I promptly proceeded to walk into the door.”
“Masdee—”
Likewise, the hyper stimulation of a Dominant’s amygdala means that if they feel they have failed to provide adequately for a submissive, they are prone to depressive episodes and other severe emotional responses.
He clung to those words like a mantra as he knelt on the padded mat Bruce had pulled out and set on the workshop floor. And, as an added bonus, Bruce even let the Hulk out to play once Tony was settled. The big guy practiced his reading with Tony again; he appeared to be working his way through the literary canon, and was in a big Jane Austen phase. Occasionally a bit of unfamiliar, dated English tripped him up, but Hulk’s was still an oddly soothing reading voice, and it was nearly impossible for Tony to feel self-conscious about his own embodiment when Bruce was willfully displaying a part of himself he had once despised.
His clumsy, aborted attempts to sit up and escape the wonderful pleasure that was Natasha’s grip on his cock were met with Natasha’s other hand planting itself on his chest. Once she had Tony on his back again, she was on top of him in seconds. This time Natasha took him into her with an almost painful gentleness, the loud slaps of their hips replaced with the quiet slide of bodies and sheets and the occasional gasp or murmur from one or both of them.
“You—” Peter gaped
“Yeah, look. I did some gross and overreaching kind of stuff over the last few…well, weeks, to be honest, and I’m going to issue a blanket apology for all of it now.”
And if his convictions needed any strengthening, the only message that hadn’t made him want to throw the entire computer out the highest window at HQ had come from Talia. The agent was as insolent and irreverent as ever, calling Steve ‘old man’ and cracking jokes about all the ways she was going to be able to best him the next time they sparred, but the words had none of the bite and snap that used to be Talia’s baseline for all communication. He saved the picture she’d attached, a grinning Talia and a scowling Masdee surrounded by a herd of goats, and turned the monitor.
“It was nice of you to stay with me. You didn’t have to.” Steve sighed explosively, displaying for the first time the kind of anger Peter had expected to be encountering first thing.
Tony was casually leaning over to refill wine glasses, and he was smiling, but something made Peter suspect the question was not quite as nonchalant as it sounded.
“You ain’t broken,” Bucky protested, but he finally dropped dragging his heels and started actually keeping pace with Tony, so he counted it as a win. Enough to actually consider answering when there were follow-up questions. “What’d you mean in the kitchen, anyway, about not being fixed?”
“Take the dildo out,” he rasped, and Tony hurried to comply. He eyed the fifth and six toys in the line with a mix of excitement and unease, but Steve shook his head. “Not tonight. I need you now, and you’ve been so good for me.” He settled himself at last on the bed, not beside Tony but underneath him. Tony wasn’t remotely sure that he had the muscle control left to ride Steve as their positions suggested he was expected to, but he still lubed Steve up when he was told and straddled his huge frame the best he could.
“It’s been really bad, hasn’t it? Ever since the press conference?” She sighed and took another long sip from her coffee cup, which on closer inspection had at least three different shades of lipstick on the lid. (Had she been refilling the same disposable coffee cup for days now? Ew, Pepper, no.)
“I’m sure Cap and I can avoid each other until everyone else gets back, Jay. Nothing to worry about. Rhodey, on the other hand, does he really think he’s going to make it between those two buildings? His shoulder artillery is way too broad. JARVIS patch me thr—”
In terms of being flexible with myself, I find this happens mostly with pacing. I used to try to keep myself pretty strictly confined to the chapter outlines I made; if something was supposed to happen in a single scene, then it stayed that way no matter what. Now I try to listen to the characters a bit more as I write, and stay a little more flexible. If something was supposed to be a chapter but it need more time to let it breathe, I let it go longer (the non-sexual submission stuff is a good example of this); if something was supposed to be a multi-chapter arc but suddenly it feels like it would be fine to cover in a scene, then I don’t try to stretch it out just for the sake of sticking to the outline.
“You don’t give me orders here, Tones. And don’t think for one second that I’m so afraid of you bein’ pissed at me that I won’t do what I need to do to make sure you stay safe and well.” There was a couple of silent minutes where Rhodey just built up a painful, precise rhythm to his swats, but he seemed entirely aware that staying silent for too long would let Tony retreat into his head. “I know this is new, and weird, and that you got a lot of shit going down. I also know that you’re struggling with a lot of guilt about how this all happened with your team; it’s them you want a punishment from, really, not me. And just to be clear I won’t be punishing you for anything to do with them, but you don’t talk to me like you just did Tony. You don’t go back on everything we agreed on. No matter what you go on to decide about your future, right now you’re in
And thanks to you, too, wonderful readers! I never stop looking forward to your comments, kudos, and questions, which are always generous and thoughtful. You’re the best!
“That why you hate him?” Bucky volleyed this accusation back at him with the airy tone anyone else might use to ask if Steve had used the last of the sugar or changed the television channel without asking. That only made it hit harder, knocking Steve in the gut and nearly doubling him over.
“So if I wanted to know how the others are doing, maybe see the, through your—collective eyes? That makes you sound like a spider. Fuck I hate magic. Look, you know what I mean.”
Natasha was already back on her feet. She charged not at Tony but at the deflector shields, managing to hook one of them with her baton and send it careening toward the other side of the room. Rather than leaping out of its way, Bucky used his metal arm to grab hold of the thing. Steve considered calling out an order, or at least a suggestion, that attempting to hijack unfamiliar, advanced tech made by Tony himself was a bad idea, but ultimately he decided not to waste his breath. Bucky had ever once listened to Steve, or to anyone else, when he didn’t want to.
“Strip.” Tony scrambled to obey, leaving his own clothes in a messy heap in the corner of the room that made Coulson smirk. Tony got back down onto his knees without invitation and practically dove at Phil’s groin, at least until a restraining hand in his hair stopped him. “Slow down, now. I know you’re eager, and I like that a lot, Tony, that’s really sweet, but I like to start off a little slower. Just kiss and suck at the head for a while, hmm?”
Of course, as sweet as submission could occasionally render Tony, that didn’t mean he’d lost the brilliance, or stubbornness, that made him, well, Tony. Case in point: he, Pepper, and the Rescue armour were currently moving through the penthouse like an awkward dance, Tony using the armour to block Pepper’s repeated attempts to slap him on the back of the head or throw items at him.
“Who would you put Rhodes with? Of all of them he’s the one I don’t have as much of a read on, so I would appreciate any insights you have.”
Tony considered this as he gave another halfhearted poke at the onions. Their quiet hissing, he had been assured, was entirely normal, but it still both felt and looked like he was prodding at a basket full off snakes. (Cooking was weird and nothing like chemistry, no matter what sacrilegious claims Rhodey had tried to make.) Not that long ago, it would have bordered on humiliating to be reminded that the team felt it necessary to leave snacks out for Tony the way one would for a child. But here Rhodey was on his other side, trying to fulfill this doomed mission of teaching Tony to cook, and even if something would undoubtedly be on fire soon, that meant something, didn’t it? The team wanted Tony to have options, multiple ways of getting the things that he needed including alternatives that would make it easier for Tony to help himself.
Tony whined and bucked backward in an attempt to meet the intrusion.
“Why do you do it then?” he asked. “Stay here, with mortals I mean. Isn’t it—doesn’t that just make it harder? We must be like the blink of an eye to you.”
“Yes,” she said simply. “But we are still doing the fashion show first.”
their headspaces, moreso than anyone else, and ideally they need partners classified at the same level. Most Trues partner off together and spent all or most of their time in their headspaces.
“The first thing I should say is that he told me something in confidence, and I won’t be sharing that until he gives me permission to do so.” And if that wasn’t enough to make the intense curiosity that made Phil so good at his job go haywire…but what else could he do but agree?
“What the hell did you do?” This was Clint as Tony remembered him from his own universe: thrumming with impatient, angry energy that so perfectly mirrored the tension in a drawn bowstring. Except this version of Clint was somehow not directing that rage at Tony, but rather on his behalf. “Things went so well today! And then you spend two minutes alone with him and—”
“I mean if you want the wedding to be more formal I’m happy to wait as long as you need to plan it, sweetheart. But there’s food we actually like at all these carts, and Rhodey is on leave for a couple more weeks, and since I know you already have most of the paperwork filled out, I’m betting we could have someone out here in half an hour. Maybe less depending on traffic.”
He’d known, he supposed, that the fact that the team played together had to mean they would have rooms like this, offering the space and tools they needed to pick and choose from the wide array of kinky practices that made up their collective interests. Whenever he’d dared to imagine such a space, though, it had been nothing like this: it had been full of intimidating, advanced equipment and brutal, dungeon-esque architecture, not…not aftercare nooks and homey furniture and pink paint (and who the hell had even picked up on Tony’s undying affection for pink anyway?)
“Peter—”
“Did I now?” Clint’s hand found its way to the small of Tony’s back, steering him as Tony continued to mutter accusations and threats.
“I think I’m getting a bit of a headache. Might go lay down for a bit.”
“Anything.” Thor’s voice was a shattered whisper, a mere echo of his typical booming tones. But like everything Thor ever said and did, the vow rang with painful sincerity. Steve blinked back the tears that rose to his eyes in response; for once, he didn’t want to be anywhere other than right where he was, and with who he was with, and the gratitude that provoked was an ache beneath his ribs that threatened to pull him apart and put him back together all in the same instant.
“I want to. It was never that I didn’t want, well, pretty much anything you want to give me.” Tony couldn’t quite help but snort, which lead to Bruce reaching out to touch him for the first time in the conversation. It was a hand pressed to the small of Tony’s back, nothing in the grand scheme of things, but it felt like sucking in the first deep breath after nearly suffocating. “It’s true, Tony. I panicked because of my issues, which we can talk about later and at length if you want, but which are mostly about the fact that I’m still grieving too, and moving on is different in the abstract than it is in the material. I was scared and a little bit sad, and guilty because I never would have done something like that if I’d known the effect it would have on us both, not without talking about it first. But none of those reasons mean I don’t care for you, or want you, and none of them should have lead me to leave you alone after you’d just hit subspace for what I’m guessing was the first time. I am truly and deeply sorry.”
Then had come the extended argument over which designer to use. Rhodey, who had teleconferenced in to every one of the conversations he hadn’t been able to be personally present for, had noted that Tony’s appreciation for both quality and showmanship might mean he’d like one made by one of the major brands. And certainly there was no shortage of options to choose from; every major jewelry and accessory designer in the world had a line of collars. None of the ones they had reached out to, however, were willing to guarantee that Tony’s collar would not be the only one of its kind, and that was a deal-breaker for the entire team. They were more than used to having everything from their superhero garb to their most random daily clothing noted and copied; an ancient sweater Clint had worn a few months prior had garnered so much interest that the company had started making it again after retiring the design nearly a decade prior. But this was different; they were all determined that this one thing would belong to Tony and Tony alone.
Ah yes, an excellent question. Their orientations are classified as follows:
“Jay, bring the contract up please. Skip the first few pages and go to the checklist please.”
“You can exchange any of them that you don’t like, but we wanted to do…well, something.”
“Okay. I know you’re not up for answering a lot of my questions this morning. And that’s fine, but can I tell you some of what I’m seeing and observing, and then we can decide together what sounds like it’ll be the best way to proceed?”
“No, you’re not.” Natasha had her hair in the thick, tight curls that she’d worn as Natalie; they had been Tony’s favourite in his own world, and it was too much of a coincidence for that decision to not be deliberate here, too. (Natasha had dressed up for him, just as Bruce had.) She, too, had finished eating, and was staring intently at Tony from her seat across the table. “No one’s going to lie to you and say that some of the attraction won’t always be the resemblance between you two. I’m sure the reverse is true for you as well.”
Now, though, I’m inclined to think that Tony was simply ahead of his time. Since his return, he has been repeatedly vocal in his critiques of the coverage of so-called ‘True’ orientations, and particularly the frequent erasure of the other partners in his relationship. He also spoke out against the regressive politics of groups like CNOW, which seek among other things to roll-back the limited protections and recognition that trans-oriented and un-oriented peoples have made in favour of a return to ‘traditional’ models.
“It was fine.”
together could and would be.”
“What happened?”
“The fact that you’re not sure you’re right is what makes me confident that you probably are, or at least that you’re asking questions that are worth asking,” Tony replied. “What? You do have a tendency to dig your heels in.”
Things went a little haywire after that. Steve was, apparently, at least aware enough to take over command of the SHIELD agents onsite. He immediately demanded a communications blackout between that team and the Tower. Phil bowed his head.
“Nossir thank you sir.” Tony was
“Please. Please. Clint, I need…”
The first thing Sam notices, with a mixture of guilt and relief, is how much more smoothly the man moves now. The improvements the Wakandans made to Tony’s design must be doing the trick. It isn’t just the bracers, either. Oh he looks older, and tired, just as they all do. But where Sam has found that a lot of folks who hadn’t been Snapped somehow now feel like they’re the ones disappearing in the face of the lingering trauma, there’s something…vital about Rhodey now. An intense and reassuring present-ness. For the first time in days, Sam feels calm.
“It’s fine. Don’t do me any favours.”
Even this morning, the entire team felt like they were keeping an overly close eye on Tony during breakfast. It was sweet, of course, but also unnerving to go from feeling like he needed to scream for attention in his own universe to having people analyzing his every muscle twitch.
However, there were still distinctions, some of which were more meaningful than they seemed in hindsight. Allow me to show you what I mean:
late!” he added, unable to stop himself. He rolled his eyes and tried to ignore it the best he could while the team cackled about his complete inability to turn off his Dominant instincts.
The whole aftercare thing didn’t really seem like Natasha, but she nodded in decisive agreement with everything Bruce said, and when Tony opened his mouth to offer at least a token protest, her hand drifted lightly over his sore ass in silent reminder. And truthfully, Tony had very little interest in fighting them on this. The aftercare was always embarrassing to think about in the light of day, but in the moment he was sore and exhausted and wanted nothing more than to be coddled and pet and told there was one thing, at least, that he'd gotten right.
Content Warnings for this chapter: Nothing major that I can think of. Tony contemplates his scars at one point, so allusions to canon-typical (and indeed MCU canon-compliant) violence. He also responds positively and with relief to the fact that the Rhodey in this universe is not wearing bracers. This is not intended as an expression of any form of ableism on Tony's part; he's just happy Rhodey wasn't injured and doesn't struggle with chronic pain issues.
With most of the team, the submission had felt like a way to solidify what they’d built during their dates. It was why Tony had ended up insisting on dating and scening with the same person despite the team’s initial suggestions. The thought still held some appeal when it came to Thor, but even more assuring was the consideration and care behind the suggestion that they wait. Thor wasn’t angry or disappointed that Tony maybe couldn’t submit to him quite yet.
