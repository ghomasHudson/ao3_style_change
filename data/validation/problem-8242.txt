! I’m freaking barely held together as it is! I need my head together if I’m going to save Pepper!”
"I'm only telling you this, so you'll know what happened if I don't return. I know it's stupid and it probably won't work. But I gotta try. You'd do the same, Steve. I woulda called you an idiot, but I would support you all the same..."
“Gabe’ll want you to check in with him,” Bucky suggested and Tony silently nodded.
, was Peter’s immediate thought. He wanted to work with his shield again. The dark mass was practically calling to him.
“We’ll find you a girlfriend,” Tony replied. “We got to change the story about you. You masturbating into a sock is not a good image but you, using a condom, being in a consensual relationship with someone you love is! Also you haven’t publicly dated anyone since you were defrosted and now that it’s out that you are dating is huge. Everyone is going to want to know about the lucky lady who finally captured your heart!”
Peter turned to his boyfriend and said, “I guess you didn’t wait for the rest of the team and rushed ahead instead of listening to Steve’s plan.”
“Hear, hear,” Steve agreed. He lightly squeezed Tony’s hand and smiled teasingly at him.
Mary inclined her head in thanks and said, “Thank you, sir.”
“Yeah, but I can’t believe this is happening! Who would attack the
Steve felt his cheeks turn red but he smiled through it and said, “Yes, I do.”
Guilt churned inside Tony as he stood back up and looked to Steve.
Bruce scoffed, “I doubt it. I walked in on you and Steve countless times. It can’t get any worse than that.”
Bucky broke their embrace and grumbled, “Fucking Hydra happened…They – They made me the Winter Soldier…”
Steve whispered, “It’s not your fault. The fault lies with the people who created Venom, not you. If anyone is to be blamed it’s the Goblin.
It was during this, he discovered his father had accidentally slid a few confidential files where they weren’t supposed to be and now Tony wanted more. Tony continued, “I know he left a lot with you guys, especially all the material on Project Rebirth…Most of it is still in the paper files and I am sad to say I can’t plead the fifth with any of it.”
,] one of the voices viciously reminded him.
He looked to his soulmate and saw Bucky had bent Tony’s arm back at an odd angle. He only released him once Steve looked at him.
Steve was the first to move and cautiously stepped forward while keeping a hand on Tony’s arm. Tony was glad for the anchor as Steve was probably the only thing keeping him upright as Tony looked upon their future.
“You and the others, you’re all wrong,” Bruce stated and Peter’s eyes widened in shock. Bruce smiled sadly and reached out and lightly touched one of Peter’s hands. The tense appendage relaxed slightly beneath his touch. He stated, “We’re both innocent and guilty.”
Steve felt sick and dropped Norman. His statement about not hurting Peter sounded sincere but the rest of it did not. For a moment, Steve imagined Peter in the hands of the Red Skull or the Mandarin and he felt like he would throw up. He stumbled back into Tony and his husband grasped him tightly.
Tony shook his head and tapped quickly at one of the holograms. He stated, “After Loki’s attack, I reinforced the tower. I got the best of everything, including the best glass money could buy. The pentagon is actually installing it in their windows next year…no normal bullet can go through that ten inches of reinforced glass! And what are the chances, out of the hundreds of windows, that it would hit the same room we were in?!”
“Blah, blah, blah,” Tony interrupted the AI. “He’s my husband. I am going to him.”
“Ohhh, true, my virtuous Captain…Hmmm, Jarvis?”
Harry sighed and said, “Yes…Yes, I would…”
Steve shook his head again and whispered, “I won’t let you do that to yourself.”
“It’s alright, buddy,” Tony murmured and flashed Peter a small smile to try to comfort him.
All the media knew was that Tony’s mate was a blond, blue-eyed, and well-muscled man.
Tony glanced at the Winter Soldier and saw the man was watching Natasha like a predator about to pounce.
The doctor’s face lost its professional parlor for a second and revealed shock from Steve’s statement.
“…His shield?” Coulson questioned, sounding genuinely perplexed. “Why on Earth would you want his shield?”
and settle down.
Tony stated, “Coulson didn’t notice anything – he just saw your shoes. It’s not going to create this grand conspiracy that Captain America’s hiding out at my place.
Steve didn’t know how long the wall remained up. He knew Tony’s birthday passed at least…it’d been the first time he had not celebrated Tony’s birthday with him…
The black sky was already beginning to bleed into the landscape, eroding away all the color and life no matter how hard Steve tried to concentrate and keep it back.
“Hydra kept their deaths a secret. If you have been watching the news lately then you know they had infiltrated SHIELD?” Tony said and Ben and May nodded. Natasha had leaked all of SHIELD and Hydra’s secrets onto the internet and it had been all over the news. She and Steve were blamed for the leak. It was common knowledge now but he had to be sure. Tony continued, “With Hydra’s downfall we have been uncovering a lot of things we did not know…”
Eddie shrugged, not wanting to argue it anymore.
Long before he even met Steve, he had accepted no one could ever truly love him.
Peter nodded and wordlessly got to his feet. Eddie also stood and then followed him across the room. Some of the interns called for his help at the pool table but Peter waved it off, wanting to escort Eddie to where he could nap.
“We need to stop the Goblin before he gets anywhere near Tony or his reactor,” Steve hissed.
- don't stop that!”
Bucky took a quick shower and then they all went into the elevator that took them down to the cove beneath his house. They strolled out onto the warm sands and a cool, salty breeze ruffled their clothes as they walked toward the waves. Bucky led the way and seemed to forget they were there as he went straight to the water.
Steve quickly got his legs under Bucky and kicked him away.
“Did you hear about Uncle Tony?” Steve asked with fake enthusiasm. He was exhilarated that he was alive but was angry that he was going after the Mandarin alone. “He’s not gone! He’s going to come back once he arrests the mean Mandarin.”
He didn't want to leave. He wanted to keep kissing Wade and exploring these new feelings growing within him...but he knew his father was already worrying and it'd be a matter of time before he started looking for Peter. Peter was not ready for Wade to meet the parents just yet.
Next Time, Ch. 12: "Shot through the Heart and You're to Blame. You give Love a Bad Name."
“Let’s go, Steve,” Tony grumbled and placed his hand on Steve’s back to guide him away. Steve went compliantly, with his head drooped.
Enjoy the chapter! It's a little shorter than usual!
?” Tony hissed and Norman’s grin grew.
What he had not been expecting was Venom staying on Peter.
“Steve!”
Steve followed Tony’s lead and pretended like everything was alright…but, on the inside, his newly broken heart foolishly yearned for life beyond the dreamscape.
“And I used the override codes you gave me!” Pepper countered with a stomp. “You told me just yesterday that you two were just friends and this morning you two could barely look at each other!
…And hadn’t he fallen asleep at the Tower in
Steve’s grip tightened on Peter so much that his son looked up at him in concern.
“When he gonna be back?” Peter asked with a small frown. His facial muscles moved slightly underneath Steve’s fingertips. Only a few days had passed but both Peter and Steve felt Tony’s absence. Steve missed hearing his voice and even missed his maddening sarcasm. Peter seemed lost and it broke Steve to see Peter so confused.
Do. That,” Bucky warned in his most menacing voice.
“Yes, thank you, Jarvis,” Tony replied.
Ben and May were taken aback by his proclamation. Out of everyone, Steve feared old fashioned predigests from them. Yet they surprised him. May had hugged him and Ben had grasped his arm during her embrace. Ben whispered hoarsely, “You were born to a difficult era for men like you. I’m glad you are here now, Steve. Now you have a chance to be yourself.”
is to leave the premises.” He turned to Tony and said, “Stark, you are not to leave my side and you are not allowed to touch
In the back of him mind, Tony’s words reverberated the rest of the night. The lab could easily be repaired but loosing either Peter or Tony would have destroyed Steve. Both of them unknowingly possessed a piece of his very soul.
“A-Are you..?”
Tony nodded to Steve and then to Wade and tilted his head to him as well and then he took off.
Tony lightly ran his fingers down the hem of Steve’s robe until he reached the belt where it was knotted. Steve heart raced inexplicitly faster from Tony’s caress. Tony grasped the knot and pulled Steve toward him with a light jerk.
She ran her fingers through his hair and promised, “We are fine. You broke through it just in time.”
Peter swallowed his first bite and determined, “It’s pretty good.”
“We finished the suit. Yensen and I will be free soon,” Tony whispered into his lips and then drew him into another kiss.
Steve was used to being able to think up a plan at the drop of a dime but…as he stared at the glove on the demon’s hand, he felt his mind grow blank and fear tighten his throat.
Steve turned to Tony and said, “Thanks, Tony, but you did not have to do this. The old couch was fine.”
Steve took the toy with a smile then, inspired by Peter, removed his spare dog-tag. The chain for the spare was made to go on his big toe in the event of his death and was just large enough to fit around Peter’s wrist. Peter let him put it on with a curious expression and ran his tiny fingers over the contours of his engraved name.
Hello! I live! Thank you for your patience! It's been over a month since my last posting! (This is literally the longest I have ever gone between posting chapters! O_o)
Tony glanced at Steve and Steve stared back, waiting for Tony's response.
“We’ll be fine, Buck, we know how this all ends…” Steve assured him.
“Hello Mr. Stark, Captain Rogers,” Marcel said with a nod.
Bucky’s brows pinched together and he slowly repeated, “Bucky…?”
Bucky puffed up his chest with pride but Steve smiled gratefully at Sneaky and whispered, “Thank you for telling us. The rest of the team would love to hear that.”
Steve would bring it up again later and be adorably nervous about it because they had never discussed marriage before but Steve was right. They
Friday wordlessly cut the connection and Tony leaned into Steve’s side flirtatiously murmuring, “
He cautiously looked to Steve and saw him staring at him.
The sound of her voice roused him. He woke in an instant with his dark blue eyes snapping open to their fullest. His eyes focused on her and they widened slightly with recognition. She laughed wetly and uncovered her mouth to smile at him.
“I'm sorry,” Steve stated, finally breaking the silence growing between them.
As Steve's head cleared, a new guilt washed over him. He had fallen asleep and spent the night. Everyone must have been worried sick about him, Peter especially. His stomach clenched painfully as he thought about his son. Peter must have been distraught. By trying to get better for him, he may have hurt him more than he meant to. His only conciliation was that it had worked, his best friend's presence brought him comfort and Bucky took all his grief without complaint and shouldered the burden with him. Steve knew he could face the world now.
{We’re too late.}
The Soldier did not listen in to their conversation as he had a sudden intense headache.
Peter shot Steve a grateful look and smiled at him. The jealousy monster immediately reared its ugly horns within Tony. He wished Peter would look at him with such trust.
It all would be so much easier to understand if the Captain could explain it but the man was barely breathing. He wouldn’t be able to help the Soldier.
Tony struggled to sit up and his entire body was shaking just by pushing himself up to his elbows. Steve got up and stopped him by grabbing his shoulders before he could hurt himself.
He knew Mary’s exploding would be quick but his entire being was rejecting the notion of his life coming to an end. He thought of Tony, of Peter, and the rest of his family. His heart constricted painfully in his chest and he wanted to hold all of them at once and never let them go.
His soulmate giggled excitedly and then pressed his body into Tony. Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist and his mouth found its way back to Steve’s.
(See the end of the chapter for
Natasha drove through the tape and went straight to where the mass of bodies hovered. The people scattered and Natasha leapt from the bike.
He raised his hands, his repulsors whining with a charge as he did.
Tony leaned in and kissed him, drawing a happy hum from the larger man as he enfolded Tony into his warm embrace.
“It would be safer for you if I am in the same vicinity as you to better watch over you,” Bucky stated.
But, most importantly, why did it want Peter?
“I don't need to get to know Deadpool more,” Tony stated, childishly proving his stubbornness. “I know who he is and he is not the one for my son.”
“I’ll tell you
Yes, that confirmed it. He laughed at the loverboy reference yesterday. Something definitely happened.
Steve smiled at his question coupled with his eyes being big and round behind those lenses he could not help it. He replied, “No, you are doing great…I haven’t had a chance to thank you yet, so thank you for doing this.”
When he woke out of his stupor, Pep and Sam were the only other ones in the room. Pepper grabbed his hand as soon as he was awake and whispered, “Hey, how are you feeling?”
Peter stared back freezing in Bucky’s hold, and trying and failing to look brave.
Dum Dum’s unconventional way nearly got him to go back.
Wade squawked and fell over when he couldn’t free his limbs to catch himself.
Tony leaned over the counter and flirtatiously said, “You’ve been looking, huh?”
Steve pressed him onto the ground and Tony wound his arms around the back of his neck.
Next chapter we meet Mary and find out what happened!
the machine.
Tony smiled warmly at him and whispered, “Welcome back, Cap.”
“I’ve had a bit of a dry spell,” Tony shrugged glancing down at his mug.
When the boy had been born she actually had the gall to ask to see him. Norman shot her in the head himself and let Hydra dispose of the body.
Tony returned to the embrace and pressed his face into Steve’s back to hide his ridiculously happy smile. Steve held onto his hands until he was done at the stove and his thumb lightly caressed the top of his hands. How he cooked onehanded Tony could only speculate but… his mind wasn’t on Steve’s cooking abilities.
Peter cleared his throat and said, “So, since five years passed, according to my birth certificate, I’m over 18 now…”
!” Tony was the first to reply. His voice resonated over all of their communicators and he sounded so wrecked and relieved all at once. Tony demanded, “How are you?! Are you hurt?!”
Peter shrugged in reply but his stormy eyes spoke well enough what he was thinking.
“Before people notice…” Steve whispered breathlessly, so desperately wanting to touch Tony.
“Awesome, target Big Bird and fire away,” Tony said, looking up to his opponent with a smirk. The missile fired and the Vulture tried to scramble away but he got only a few flaps in before the missile hit one of his wing turbines, totally destroying the wing. The man plummeted to the ground and probably only survived thanks to the second wing slowing him down…a little. He doubted he was going to be getting up anytime soon.
Venom let go of his throat and Peter inhaled deeply through his nose as Venom still hadn’t let go of his mouth. He felt dizzy from lack of oxygen.
“Okay, first history lesson about the future. The meaning to the term ‘gay’ has changed a little in my era…”
“I’ll look into options for you,” Gabe promised. “Right now, though, I think the Penicillin is your best bet…”
happy…because I knew I could finally be true to myself without any fear. Maybe a week later I met your father and he flirted with me. That enigmatic, beautiful man was interested in me and I was in him…so I flirted back. I was still scared. I knew there were some people who still thought like they did back in the 40s and, I, myself, still felt a need to guard the secret because of my upbringing. But here we are now…” Steve chuckled and smiled happily at Peter. “So, sorry for giving you my whole life story but…yes, I knew I was gay from a young age but I couldn’t really embrace it until I met your father and he helped me learn to be a ‘modern’ gay man until we finally came out.”
Tony held Steve tightly as he guided him into the kiss. His facial hair scratched at Steve’s skin and his lips had a hint of whiskey on them. But they were warm and soft and so gently that Steve barely noticed. Steve followed every tilt Tony’s head, chased every stolen breath, and loved every moment of their intimate contact.
“Yeah,” Steve sighed, answering Thor and leaning heavily into Tony. “But you guys could have gotten here a little sooner.”
“A flirt as always,” Peggy said, rolling her eyes as she came in and closed the door behind her.
“Shut him up,” the Red Skull hissed and Bucky put a hand over Tony’s mouth.
Ultron jolted upright while Peter chuckled to himself.
Tony sent Jarvis to work searching the city’s cameras for Steve’s uniform or the Winter Soldier’s metal arm. It was reminiscent of the time Tony had fruitlessly searched for the shield.
Mary was waiting for them on the same stool she sat on as she sat on as she spoke with Ben. She was wearing the same lab coat and was frowning as soon as they walked in.
They were both fugitives and were being hunted by the government but, at that moment, Steve never felt happier in his life.
“I need to be alone, Aunt May,” he whispered. She did not say another word and he went upstairs. He locked his bedroom door then put Steve Roger’s crumbled business card on his desk.
Bucky fell into the seat next to him and asked, “What’s your beef?”
DUM-E took their moment as one to crash and came zooming over. It grabbed Steve’s outstretched hand and vigorously shook it.
?” Peter gasped. Captain America was gay?! Oh sweet land of Liberty, that kind of news would catch the world by storm!
He wanted to see Tony's face as they made love. It... just did not seem right not being able to see his pleasure as they were together.
Steve sat up slowly, trying not to wake the others up. Natasha simply rolled to her side and freed his one arm but Tony grumbled and buried his face deeper into Steve’s side. Steve carefully unlocked Tony’s arms and placed him on the pillow Steve had been laying on. He ran his fingers through his hair once and then slipped into the kitchen.
Tony solved the Pepper and Steve problem by staying at the Tower and gifting Steve with a two day trip to Los Angeles to go to Dodgers’ Stadium and watch a game. In the 1940s, the team had belonged to Brooklyn and had been Steve’s team. Steve ecstatically accepted the gift (a rarity when it came to Steve who usually hated lavish gifts) but he was not too happy to hear that Tony would not be joining him.
Clint pursed his lips unhappily but he made no move to stop Steve as he pushed himself out of Clint’s hold.
“Wh-Where’s Peter?” Wade gasped to Tony. Tony felt his emotions seesaw right there. His husband was dying right in front of him but what about his son??
“I won’t let him,” Natasha swore. She grasped his arm and promised, “I won’t let him touch either of us again.”
for me to deny you,” Tony grumbled through his grin. He ran his hands quickly over the remaining suds all over his body to get rid of them. Tony continued, “I am supposed to be the irresponsible one with orders from authority, not you.”
“G-Get away from me,” Peter gasped but not a moment later Venom emerged and Peter was embraced in the darkness again.
There was a small pinch on the back of his arm and his entire body jolted to a stop.
He’d never had to deal with the press like Peter did. He never cared what they printed and he didn’t have a persona he wanted to keep untarnished. He was Wade Wilson, the infamous Deadpool, the Merc with a Mouth, and the Regenerating Degenerate…
Tony’s heart skipped a beat and he felt like he wanted to clap, laugh, and kiss Steve all at once. Caressing his lips lightly against Steve’s mouth, he whispered, “Me too. I’d be a wreck without you so don’t you dare go cliché on me.”
Coulson put a hand on top of Clint’s and murmured, “I’m glad to see you too, Barton.”
“Hey, Cap.” Tony walked up to him, wiping his wet hair out of his face. He was soaking wet and his face was flushed from doing a number a cannonballs into the water. He wore bright red swim trunks that were so small and tight they might as well have been speedos. Steve tried to look anywhere but the swim trunks as his friend took up position beside him.
“We’re going to get you out of there,” Steve promised. “We’ll just go a little slower so you don’t get hurt, okay?”
His third August 20
Steve smiled that dazzling smile of his and whispered, “Yes, Tony, I will marry you, my ridiculous time traveler.”
grade photo album and was thoroughly embarrassing him. He was a hotdog for Halloween that year apparently…”
“See,” Tony hissed. “
As he expected, Howard nearly had an aneurysm and screamed some more before demanding to see the time machine. Bucky volunteered to take him and Howard demanded more information on the robot. Bucky started to describe a robot Steve knew to not be Sneaky but from an Action Comic he and Bucky traded as children. Steve chuckled silently to himself at Howard’s expense.
Firstly, for her new instructor to find her. He was a senior agent who had no idea of her identity and he was supposed to locate her as a part of her training. Her task was to stay hidden as long as possible. Once he found her, and she had no doubt he would, he would begin training her in long-distance surveillance, sniping, and tactical maneuvering.
He pulled the flute out of Steve’s grasp, lightly caressing his fingers as he did. Steve's eyes darkened a shade and Tony hurriedly turned around so Steve would not see his blush.
Steve instantly left the balcony and ran inside, calling out to the AI inside the buliding, “Jarvis??”
Under her winter coat, were various weapons hidden but close at hand. She currently had one hand resting on her lap but the other in her pocket, holding a small pistol. She watched the park paths for activity. She surmised it was where her mate would most likely appear.
Harry smirked and said, “We will see!”
Tony grinned again and replied, “I’ve slept in worse places.”
Natasha reached over and pressed the power button on the remote, turning off the television. She murmured, “Perhaps it would be best to not watch TV for a while.”
Steve opted to run to the nutrition supply truck instead of replying. His heart raced faster than it ever did before and he prayed devoutly to God:
He needed to unleash the emotional response all at once and had felt semi-cleansed from it but…but now he felt it building up again especially as his mind wandered back to Tony.
That is why, twenty years later, frozen in the ice in a comatose state, Steve’s implant beeped and began its countdown as it finally found a connection with a newly inserted implant on one Antony Edward Stark.
“Steve,” Tony moaned with need. It wasn’t a moan of lust however…it was of an actual need, like he couldn’t go on without him. In response, Steve kissed him more deeply to physically show him how much he needed him too. This would be the last time he would kiss Tony, embrace his warmth, or feel his heartbeat. He tried to get as much of it as he could before he was forced to go.
Steve and Peter were morning people and sitting next to each other so they were happily chatting away about what they planned to do for the day (sneaking out to the zoo). Gone were the days of hiding behind glasses and baseball caps, Tony had made them facial holograms, better than the ones SHIELD had so they could go out without fearing being recognized.
One shot and he’d be dead. He probably wouldn’t even dodge it. Her heart was beating faster as he continued to stare at her with those dark blue eyes.
“Alright, kid, go! Will you be coming back tonight?”
Steve continued in a light whisper, “I know things have been bad since Bucky came into the picture. I know I messed up when I kissed him. I did not know who I loved more until I thought I had lost you. But, Tony, you have been one of the only constants in my life since I woke from the ice. Until that moment, I had not realized how important you are to me. I may have glanced Bucky’s way but you will always be a part of me. I don’t need Bucky. I lived without him for years but you…I need you. The world is a darker place without you in it…”
Peter cringed when he took a closer look at it. Before that moment, he hadn't seen the Facebook invitation his father and Pepper had created. There was the general info for the party (when, where, etc) but there was a gif of the Tower with a tiny Iron Man flying around holding a cake.
Bucky ducked his head a little and fell silent, his eyes contemplative.
Peter looked down at him only to find him smiling at Peter. Peter choked out a pained laugh and gasped, “Of course you like the idea of this thing liking you.”
“No, he needs as much peaceful sleep as he can get,” Tony argued.
“Island getaway, hm?” Marcel murmured, packing up his papers.
They were in limbo.
Peter would be safer without him. He could grow up with Ben and May and no would have to know he was Steve's son. He would have an ordinary, safe childhood. Steve could not give that to him. It sickened him to think it but horrified him more with the truthfulness to it. Peter really would be better off without him. If he had been Richard's son instead of Steve's he would have never been experimented on by Hydra, he would have never been terrorized by Loki or General Ross, he would have grown up knowing his mother, and he would never have to worry about avoiding the paparazzi or a villain bent on revenge against Steve.
Wade shrugged and continued to wallow. Peter rolled his eyes but still persisted, “And I think my dad doesn’t hate your guts anymore.”
??” Bruce clarified. He put down his spoon and paused in eating his oatmeal. “What have you three been doing?”
Tears started to fall from Steve’s eyes and the words failed Tony at seeing him cry. Steve gently ran his thumb over Tony’s cheek, catching the tear Tony hadn’t felt escape from his own eyes. Steve then pressed his forehead to Tony’s and, in a hushed whisper, said, “I love you too, Tony. You are my everything and more.”
The agents were suffering under the moral dilemma of Eddie’s innocence coupled with the weight of Venom’s danger. What were they going to do with him?
Seeing the love of your life for possibly the last time was far from “simple.” He could barely breathe as he walked toward Tony’s slumbering form.
They broke their kiss, gasping for breath, and, just as it was caught, they both dived back in and smothered each other with another.
Opposite the door to the study, there was another door which Steve pushed open hesitantly, afraid of what lavish things might lay behind it. While the bathroom was extremely decadent, to the point that Steve was a little concerned, the bedroom, though huge was simply furnished and a single box sat on the bed.
“He likes to read,” Clint said sparing him from further babbling “And there are, like, 70 years of books he’s missed out on. Definitely get him Harry Potter.
He wasn’t looking at Steve or the images anymore but at his feet.  “And this is what you will be associating yourself with if our relationship is the platform you use to come out.” He set the tablet down, but the image stayed floating in the middle of the room.
“I am certain Sir.  He appears to be having a night terror and he is not waking up.” Jarvis said.  Tony had never programmed the A.I. to convey tone but it managed to anyway.  Tony was already in the elevator by the time Jarvis had finished speaking.
’ Steve hurled the shield at Tony’s shoulder missing his neck by inches. It had the intended effect though one of the rockets flared up from inside its slot it the suit knocking Tony forward and the boy backwards at the same time.  Clint rushed forward and aimed his bow at the kid.
“Science doesn’t seem to apply Jarvis.  We are taking a more… liberal approach.”  And by a more liberal approach Tony meant drunkenly staring at the wave of colors the display was producing while he let his mind wander where it wanted.  The theory was that some other intoxicated conversation from his year as a theoretical physics grad student would float to the surface and suddenly give meaning to the senseless data. His mind instead took the liberty of playing over the file Steve had handed him.
Steve’s jaw clinched and his teeth ground.  Tony stood over him and watched for just a second before he put a hand on Steve’s shoulder. His muscled tensed at Tony’s touch.  Steve woke up gasping for air as if he was drowning. His eyes darted around confused. His breathing was still heavy.  He finally seemed to find Tony amongst the shadows.  Their eyes met for a split second and then to Tony’s shock Steve burst into tears.  He gripped Tony’s shirt and his shoulder rocked against Tony’s torso.  The only noises he made were gasps for breath in between silent sobs.  Tony didn’t know when it had happened but he didn’t feel like he was witnessing something he shouldn’t.  He felt life a confidant not an intruder.   After brief hesitation he placed his hand on Steve’s head and slipped his fingers through his hair.  Tony made his breaths large enough to move his abdomen and breathed as slowly as possible.  Steve’s breathing slowly set pace with his.
“If you don’t mind my saying so Sir, this doesn’t seem very scientific.” Jarvis said.  Tony could almost feel the A.I. looking disapprovingly at the scotch.  He was trying to do better.  He’d finally patched the whole in his chest and had promised Pepper that he was done with everything that had come with it.  She’d almost walked out on him when he’d built Mark XLIII but he had talked her down; promised it was the only one, for emergencies only.  He meant it.  The problem was the alcohol had been there before Afghanistan and the need for it had stayed with him like a limb.
“Disturbance in Chinatown. High population density, Citizens at risk. Avengers Presence requested.  Hawkeye is en route.” Steve stood up and pushed his plate of eggs toward Bruce.
Tony walked over to Steve and placed his hands on his arms.  “Steve, I haven’t even heard you say the words come out yet, you blush and look embarrassed every time someone mentions it. If you aren’t ready the media will eat you alive, they will try to anyway.  If you aren’t sure don’t do it because you can’t take that back.”
“Umm?” Steve said watching the exchange with confusion.  They stopped and both turned their attention to him.  He contemplated telling them for a moment but decided against it.
, 2012.”
Thor’s laughter seemed to echo off the walls. “Indeed.”
“Jarvis, go ahead and activate the press blitz protocol,” Tony said.  Patch me through if I need to make any calls in person.”
Clint had plopped down on the couch with a first aid kit tucked under one arm and pulled out a needle and thread and began to stitch up a deep gash on his hand.
“You have exceeded you limit of seven cups for the day Master Stark, I overrode you request as per prior instructions.” Jarvis said. Tony groaned and pressed his forehead against the workbench.
Steve reached in to his duffel bag and pulled out a manila folder. In black print on the front cover were the words STEVE ROGERS: REEDUCATION a large red stamp under it marked it as S.H.E.I.L.D. classified level four.
Tony stepped up to Clint and raised his hands suddenly grateful for the few self defense lessons Happy had given him.
“Here” Steve said. “It didn’t look like your, um, friend made enough this morning.”  Tony took the coffee cup and sighed.
Tony ordered a bottle of wine for the table.
“I brought you breakfast,” Steve said. He set down the plate and mug and the noise finally drew Tony’s attention from, well, the rest of it.
“Pray away the gay?” Steve asked again clearly no less confused.
“What does that mean?” Steve asked.
“That hardly looks like a breakthrough Tony.” She said. “More like a plate of spaghetti.”  Tony threw up his hands in exasperation.  Pepper was right of course.  He was at least several weeks away from isolating the Chitauri control frequency… mostly because it didn’t conform to the human definition of frequency… as in waves. Yeah, it might take him more than several weeks. At this point however he was perfectly happy to be overly optimistic about his prospects if it got him more coffee.
“Thank you Jarvis.”  Pepper smiled at the ceiling.  Tony smashed his head against the table again and flicked off the nearest of Jarvis’s optical sensors.
“You move an’ I’ll nail your dick to the ground with an arrow” he said lowering his aim to the boy’s crotch.  Steve remembered what Natasha said about the car incident and grimaced.
Steve frowned.  It was a stern frown; the kind disappointed fathers gave their genius sons when they brought home a B in chemistry because they couldn’t be bothered to the homework.
“What’s his body temperature?” Tony asked.
“Is this gonna be some wax on wax off shit here. Cus I don’t have time for that.” Tony said.
“None of your business” Steve kept eating his sandwich with fierce determination.
“Ninety three point four, heart rate one thirty five”
“Stop being a whiny bitch and get over here.” Clint shouted.  “I promise I won’t break any bones.”
“How’d things go?” He tossed a bottle to Steve. Natasha was hunched over her tea cup inhaling the fumes.
The war began, and friends went off to fight, and that was when Steve learned the bad side of the soul mark arrangement.   Just because you had a date didn’t mean you were guaranteed to meet your soul make.  Men went to war and soul marks disappeared from the arms of people they hadn’t even met yet. People posted ads in the paper wanting to know who they had lost.  Hoping the family member would recognize the description of the matching mark and reach out.  Sometimes the ads ran in the paper before the letters made it home to the families.  Every day he checked his holding his breath hoping it hadn’t vanished overnight.
Steve grabbed him by the collar of his shirt and crashed their lips back together. Tony let him keep up the brutally quick pace for a minute or two before pulling back.  He slowed down to the point that it was nearly unbearable simply to see what Steve would do.  He gently pulled Steve’s lower lip between his teeth and rubbed the tip of his nose gently against Steve’s. Steve rested his hand on Tony’s chest and he barely noticed how numb the scar tissue felt.
“It was nothing.”
“Likely Sir”
Tony nodded, “Anything else?” He asked hopefully.
“Stop calling it the future and I might just believe you.”
After that night Tony disappeared into his lab for two days.  Steve saw him once raiding the fridge but he pretended not to notice him and let him skitter away.
“Because he doesn’t know anyone there Tony.  He has nothing to do but beat punching bags to a pulp all day.”
He looked up to see Steve looking very concerned and realized that all that was holding him up was Steve’s hands on both of his shoulders.
When Steve met Peggy, his heart hurt from knowing that she was not the one, she was seventy years too early, and her soul day less than five years away. He loved her dearly and couldn’t understand how she couldn’t be the one, but it was there inked on both their wrists clear as day.
“You don’t have to.” Tony said.
“g’night” he pecked Tony’s cheek and began clumsily weaving his way through the mess of the lab.
“So…” Pepper said as he trudged his way through endless lines requiring his initials. “I had a meeting with Fury this morning.”
Exactly one week after he and Tony had initially discussed making their relationship public, and thusly his coming out, Steve made his way down to Tony’s lab.  He didn’t flinch when Jarvis asked him what floor he wanted to go to in the elevator and was a little bit proud about that.
“I donno Cap.” Natasha said.  She was smiling and already lacing up her shoes.  “You really going to hit a girl?” Steve stammered a little bit and Natasha laughed. They headed to the center mat.  Out of the corner of his eye Steve could see bets being placed and money exchanging hands.  He did not appear to be the crowd favorite to win.
“Hey, so for the comms I was thinking of adding a vitals sensor in case…” Tony stopped talking.  He was accustomed to being listened to and Steve was not listening, he continued to pound away at the bag.  Upon moving closer he saw that the canvas, Kevlar reinforced, was streaked with blood.
“Well… um I was wondering if you wanted to go to church with me tomorrow.” Steve asked.
“Boxing? Really?” Clint voice was half sarcastically half udder despair.
“I’m kind of um… new to this part of town.” Steve said with a wince and a Brooklyn accent that was on the tolerable side of noticeable.
“You’re adorable!” she said as he handed her the drink.  Steve blushed. “And I’ve gotta run I have a meeting.  Thanks Steve!” She said before heading to the door and Steve was left wondering when they had gotten on a first name basis.
Tony had chucked a tablet at Steve and told him it was time to catch up on pop culture.  He had then rambled something about dinner with Pepper and left Steve to watch movies.  He had filled several pages of his notebook an in the process decided he understood less about the future than he thought.  He felt like he was in a wind tunnel trying to pick up people whispering to him.  There was just so much and every answer came with new questions.  He wandered through the kitchen looking back through the little notebook. Thus far his list included the words: face book, selfie, mp3, Survivor, X-box, hipster, sharknado, Dodgers not in New York?!?!?!?!?!, and Kardashians.  He also had jotted down a few recommendations Clint had thrown at him upon seeing the list while gulping down the eggs and sausage that had been abandoned on the table hours previously.
“Sleep. I’ll be in the kitchen if you need me.” Steve said.  He headed to the kitchen. “Jarvis let me know when he falls asleep.”
“The Captain is in his room but has requested to be left alone.”  Jarvis said. Tony thunked his head against a work bench. This was going to have to wait till morning.
“Yeah Jarv?”
“You were out late last night,” he said
Tony smiled and moved closer to Steve. He put his arm around him and began pointing at different icons on the screen and explaining what they do.
He pulled in to the garage under the tower and found Tony there waiting for him.
The elevator dinged and opened.  Steve considered hitting the button to go back upstairs but Natasha was up there, and she had made it explicitly clear that he wasn’t allowed back up until he had ‘dealt with his shit.’  He paused by the doorway to decide exactly what he was going to say.   His hands shook as he pushed the door open.
Tony: Tell me what you like, I’m going shopping for you. Do you like to read? Do you like Music? Are you too good for the material world?
Worse than the changing though was that there was no way of knowing who his soul mate was except to ask every single person he met on his soul day if it was theirs as well.  And if he didn’t realize when he met them there was little to do about it.
Tony tossed the keys at the valet and wrapped an arm around Steve’s waist as they entered the restaurant.  It was fancier than anything Steve had ever seen.  A hostess led them to the back corner table. Steve looked around nervously.  There was more silverware on the table setting than he knew what to do with.
“What’s Instagram?” Both Steve and Thor said at the same time. Tony saw a smile of understanding pass between them.
They walked out of the restaurant in to the mid-afternoon sun.  Steve’s hair glistened in the light that reflected off the buildings.  It was mildly ridiculous, offensive even.  They wandered their way toward a nearby park.  Tony’s phone gave a buzz in his pocket.  He flipped it open.
“Yeah, I guess,” Tony said.  “Thanks.”
“Hey” Tony scooted over so that Steve could sit down next to him and patted the couch cushion.
“Jarvis, I’m going to have to be the mature one in this situation aren’t I?”  Tony asked.  The alcohol sang to him from across the room.
“You know I can’t get drunk.” Steve said after the waiter had left.
“I was thinking…. That…well maybe..”  Suddenly he found himself unable to speak because Steve was kissing him.
“I’ve never really considered it.”
Tony swung at Clint again and managed to jump out of the way of the first leg sweep.  Clint vaulted off his hands and wrapped both his legs around Tony’s shoulders taking him to the ground.
“What!?” he asked. “Why can’t he just stay at Shield?”
He walked into the room just in time to see Clint take a swing, and Natasha break several laws of physics while taking him to the ground.  Natasha had her hair up in a sloppy ponytail and was barefoot,  Her arms were bare and Tony couldn’t help but glance at her wrists, an ingrained habit. Where her soul mark should have been a dark rectangle was instead. He looked away quickly but he suspected she noticed.
Steve’s phone buzzed.  When he opened it two new apps sat on his main screen which before had only had the weather app and online cribbage. Steve clicked in and saw his profile all set up.
“You sure he’s not just masturbating Jarvis?” Tony flipped the page to find a photo of him and Steve kneeling next to each other shoulders touching in the pew.
“Oh, and movie night is at 7 if you want to come.” He said as he was walking out.
“Hey, what are you writing?” Tony peered over Steve’s shoulder.  The text read: A wild Stark on the hunt for coffee.  “you’re hilarious Barton” He said.
Every few days a postcard would arrive, sometimes prompting Tony into some form of self-care, sometimes asking how he and the rest of the team was.  Always signed Best, Steve.
Busted.  Tony just wiggled his eyebrows and took another sip of Scotch.  There was no sense saving face.  He had a lost this round.
Tony wandered down to the training rooms playing with a new communicator design. Clint had been complaining that it had been interfacing with his hearing aid poorly. Three prototypes and several shocks to Clint’s ear later, he wanted to clear the final design with Steve before he put it in to production.
“I don’t know.” Uncertainty plagued Steve’s face again. Tony realized Steve likely did know what he wanted but didn’t know if he could ask for it.  Tony didn’t exactly have a reputation for fidelity.
“Yeah, Thanks for that one.” Tony walked in to the room. He had finally managed to negotiate his was out of the mangled armor with the help of several robotic arms.
The afternoon had been wonderful.  Tony had made him laugh more than he had since before the war.  For an hour or two he hadn’t felt out of place.
Tony ordered what he thought to be too much food and watched in amazement as Steve put away two quarter pounders, two orders of fries, a basket of onion rings, and an extra large milkshake.
Natasha half led half pushed Bruce over to one corner of the mats.  She began showing him how to punch.  “Not like that, align your wrist.  If you go in with it bent you’ll break it; if you break it you’ll hulk out.”
“Best idea I’ve heard all week.” Tony said.  He leaned in slowly giving Steve every opportunity to pull away. When Steve didn’t Tony brought their lips together with a feather-light touch.  He ran a finger down Steve’s cheekbone and kissed the corner of Steve’s mouth.
It was raining the next morning, so Steve swam laps instead of running.  When he finished, he headed back up to his room for a shower and had to pop back into the living room to ask Jarvis how exactly the thing worked. After a mild struggle with the control panel, he managed to get just one of the three shower heads to turn on, no need to be wasteful after all.
“Thanks.” Tony just waved him off as he headed for the elevator.
“Just one more cup?” he asked. “I could be one espresso from a breakthrough.  Your tyrannical rule of the coffee pot and treacherous seduction of my A.I. could be depriving the word of my ultimate contribution to science.” He said again gesturing to the chart.  Pepper gave another pointed look to the tangle of wires before she dropped a substantial pile of papers of the nearest clear surface.  Tony let out a huff and began to sign.
“He does, but this time he ran over the target with an SUV screaming ‘DIE FUCKERS DIE’ at the top of his lungs… in the middle of the town square.  It made the city’s local news.  Thus paperwork... also a psych eval. ” She must have seen the look of mild horror on Steve’s face because she quickly said “Don’t worry.  They deserved it.”  If anything that made him feel more concerned.
“Hey Cap?”
“You betcha.” Tony tipped back in his chair till it was balanced on two legs. “I figured Bruce was probably more qualified to solve this one.”
“Well it’s not working.”
“Eh,” Tony shrugged. “It guarantees I get at least a few calories in every hour.” He drank deeply and Steve gave him a concerned almost fatherly look that was turned humorous by the eggs in his mouth. He gestured to the skillet
The sound of rushing water increased in volume.  Steve could see it coming up through the grate in the floor.  He pulled himself slowly up the slanted floor toward the front of the plane.  Each motion sent a burning pain through his leg and up his spine. He didn’t start screaming until the water hit him. Everything it touched felt raw.  He could feel his bones freezing in his body.  The water made it up to his waist before the cockpit gave a final groan and sunk beneath the dark choppy waves.  Even above the water the temperature was dropping fast.  Steve could no longer feel his fingers where they clung to the dashboard.  The water stopped rising and the room got darker and darker as the ship sunk leaving Steve half submersed in a pitch black air pocket every nerve in his body shrieking.
Steve: Sometimes it's nice to take the time to do something by hand for someone. It shows appreciation.
“Thanks, Tony.” Steve said he rested his hand on Tony’s shoulder for a second before leaving the lab.  Tony was already engrossed in whatever he was doing on his tablet by the time the door shut.
“I look ridiculous” Clint tried to erase the photo, but Thor held the phone out of his reach.
“Not what I asked, Cap.”  He said.  The edge of the folder pressed in to Steve’s arm.
“Supposed to be cutting back.” Tony slurred before taking a long swig. He looked everywhere but Steve. “Been fucking up a lot of supposed tos lately.”
Steve looked around for anything that would help him disarm the boy.
By the time he returned to the living room Clint had already lost all his territory and was sitting on the couch grumpily looking at his smartphone.
“Floor?” Steve asked a little bit in disbelief.
“He mentioned Steve needing a place to stay, so I volunteered the tower.” Tony’s head snapped up.
“No.” She said simply. “I have some papers I need you to sign before you ‘forget’ about the board meeting this afternoon.” She grabbed his hand and held it up between them.  He tried to hold it still but his fingers gave involuntary squirms and twitches. “You can’t sign things if your hand has shaken off you wrist.”
“Jarvis, put all the numbers and shit back up.” Tony said.  Many years of experience had taught him that the only bad time for showmanship was funerals, the best time being first, or in this case second impressions.  Steve walked in with his hands tucked in his high waisted pants, or trousers rather, Tony thought. Any pants that looked like that had to be given their own distinguishment that made clear the lack of modernism they possessed.
Tony tired to take a deep breath subtly.  Five floors to go.  Now or never.  “So, um tell me if I’m reading this wrong but…”
“I have come up with a five-step plan.” Tony grabbed his phone out of his pocket. “First we must make social media accounts and build a decent following. I had Jarvis make you an Instagram and Twitter. Barton and Thor have agreed to tag us in welcome posts on both platforms.” “Jarvis, log Steve in on his phone, will you?”
He found a bike abandoned on the street still mostly intact—one of the handles was a little bent and began a trip across town to the location.  The blocks blurred by as he pedaled the bike beyond any speed it was meant to go. At some point, as he felt tears begin to roll down his cheeks, he had made it all this way, all this time, just to miss it. He knew he couldn’t have done anything differently, the world had needed him; he had saved the world. They had won. So why did it feel like he had lost?
“The Towers visual display systems are a combination of Vector based projection and nano-fiber optics; resulting in a comprehensive and interactive 3d display system, Captain.”  At Jarvis’s voice ringing through the room Steve jumped and firmly grabbed his shield.  He looked around trying to find the source of the voice. Tony had to admit that it amused him a little bit.
He had just finished a match when Natasha sat down next to him.  She was out of uniform but even in sweatpants and a T-shirt every eye in the room seemed to be on her.
“I’m sorry.”
Steve watched Tony carefully and despite his size he looked small and frightened.
“Master Stark left the charity gala four hours ago, at which time he had his driver drive him to five separate pizza placed because the first four did not possess his desired cheese to sauce ratio. As you might be able to infer he was drinking all the while.”
Happy was waiting for them when the service let out.  Tony could see a few smart phones emerging to document their presence.  Steve must have noticed as well because he moved quickly to the car without question.
“No way. No one beats me at marksmanship.” Clint bragged.
“I’ll be ninety-six,” Steve said to spare him from doing the math.  They went to the library that afternoon and after some confusion, figured you that Bucky’s mark wasn’t much better. January 16
Happy pulled up to the curb just as it started to get dark.  Tony’s stomach hurt so much from laughing that he was sure he’d have a six pack in the morning.  Steve seemed content to watch the city pass by from the car window. He couldn’t recall a more enjoyable afternoon.  He was already looking forward to doing it again. His brain was going weird places, places that involved holding hands and ice cream Sundays, places that Tony Stark didn’t do.  Tony watched him peer up at the sky scrapers to the tune of ‘shit...shit...shit” running through his head as he slowly talked himself into a terrifying corner. He wanted to say corny horrible things like ‘pretty amazing isn’t it?’ but there were rules he lived by, the first of which was ABC (always be cool).  The second was no attachments, but he’d been breaking that one a lot as of late.
Tony was reading the tabloid headline A Stark Contrast: Aliens Cause Heroes to Find Religion when Jarvis spoke up despite having been put on mute for the night.
“Just think about it.” Tony said.  “No time limit on the offer.”  He turned to leave.
“You seemed perfectly willing at the time sir.” Tony stuck his tongue out and reached for his drink. “And Sir, may I suggest that you not show up intoxicated for your first religious experience in at least 30 years.”
Steve sighed and rolled Tony on his side. He went to the kitchen and got a glass of water and a bottle of Advil from the cupboard and set it on the table next to Tony.  He then gently shook Tony’s shoulder until the man began to grumble and wake up.
An hour later, six a.m., god he had woken up early, he had managed to pull himself together and had a shower he headed downstairs to the kitchen of his upstate mansion he was putting everyone up at till all the debriefing and paperwork was done. He wasn’t totally surprised to find Steve up and puttering around the kitchen, gloriously sweaty, presumably from an early morning run. He was wearing a hoodie and gym shorts his sleeves rolled up but tony noticed he too wore a cuff around his wrist obscuring his soul mark.  It looked like old worn leather and Tony wondered how he had come upon something so aged in the few months he had been back in the world. Tony scuffed his feet at the doorway and Steve quickly yanked his sleeves down over the cuff.
“Do you want some eggs?” Steve asked.  He sounded exhausted defeated, dead.
“I did he said he didn’t want anything.” Tony said, “I don’t think he understands how much money I have and how not a big deal it is.”
“Your request is noted sir.” The disembodied voice said. Tony stuck his tongue out at the wall and Steve decided that even though he was brilliant he was definitely not sane, even by the superhero standard.
“Have fun boys.” Natasha said a little louder than was entirely necessary.  As they walked into the elevator Steve heard Clint say “Wait! What?”
“Back again, Sweetheart?” Steve stopped his licking to give him a kiss.
“Forgive me. I’ll keep in mind to show affection for the elderly when I come face to face with one.”
, the fur around his neck. Tony couldn’t resist exposing more of the area. His tail actually wagging.
The omega must have done something outlandish to have caused all the shifters to furiously pretend he didn't exist. Tony was curious to find out what. Besides, the other omega looked around Tony’s age, so if not for the sake of finding out the truth, at least he had someone who was in the same predicament as him to talk to. If Tony was going to live the rest of his life pack-less the least he could do was make companions and keep them until they left him behind for their new pack and a new home.
As tempting as food was a bath seemed more preferable instead, especially when he felt another string of Steve’s seed flood within him. No way was he going to walk down to the kitchen without evidence of their mating trickling down his leg. No matter how thoroughly he’d try to wipe.
Tony had to pause at that and think it over. “I know you mean ten as a compliment in cockatoo years, but to us two legs ten is still a child. I don't know how I feel about looking like a kid.”
Tony gently grabbed his alpha’s face and pulled him down to kiss him fiercely on his lips. “I won’t,” another kiss, “I won’t. I love you, too. I love you.”
“And what does he desire, Sir?” Jarvis prompted. “His pack is his family. He’s already acquired the family he wants.”
“That is not your fault,” Sam stressed, giving Loki a dirty look. “The snake over there is blunt, but he isn’t blaming you.”
Tony searched for answers at the mention of ‘distress’ coming from the alpha. What had happened for Steve to come rushing down? What sent him in the panicked state Thor had stated? Were they in danger?
“Please, Steve… look at me.”
Loki read over the letter, no doubt thinking of the similarities between this one and Tony’s previous. “What are you thinking?”
“When do you want to take it?”
Peter goes down with a grumble. Tony knew his boy loved the height and usually fought tooth and nail to stay but Tony figured the present will more than make up for it. He was excited for the child.
All the avengers were falling for it, all except for one. Natasha didn’t wince and she didn’t appear to accept the explanation. She was searching again, just like before, and Tony really hoped she wouldn’t find whatever she was looking for.
of his ability to manipulate magic. Panic clawed in his chest and breathing became difficult. Only, instead of grinning madly or demanding something of him like Tony expected Loki rolled his eyes, muttered words and tapped his forehead. All at once the panic and the fear melted away and breathing continued as if never interrupted.
Tony could smell more in the scent, his nose having been heightened thanks to the adrenaline fear had created, but the alpha hugging him was making it difficult to focus enough to distinguish them. The alpha was shaking him, no, not shaking him, the alpha was trembling and in turn was vibrating Tony.
“I feel so loved. See what I put up with?” Clint asked Tony. “You'll love me, right?”
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make you feel you couldn’t talk to your family. I’ll learn to control my jealousy, I promise. Please, don’t leave me.”
.” Hammer stopped right in front of him. His eyes slowly lowered from his face down to his legs and back up. The alpha was rapt by his body.
to the second floor. He was crawling his way up, jumped to latch onto the edge of a window, somehow was able to unlock it and slid inside.
“Thanks,” Bucky deadpanned.
Tony jumped to his feet and put his gauntlets on. The hum of magic radiating from them, and the faint glows of the runes lighting his fingers were like home. He slammed his palms together for the two white runes in the middle to meet and the pair lit up with power, activating each other. Charged up and ready to fire, Tony held his hands out and aimed his palm to the direction Rhodey was facing.
“That’s great, Tony.” Steve sounded genuinely happy for him. His tail even wagged with excitement. “I’m sure Ben will give you reasonable work. May keeps him level headed so there’s no unfair treatment there.”
Steve released another whine. “Tony?”
an animal,” Winter hisses. “This is Steve and he’s protecting his omega, who can die at any second if we don’t
“I do. If you allow me.”
“We’re not going to bury you, Tony,” Steve’s chest rose and sunk in quick succession from the alpha’s silent laughter.
If he could glare he would have. Tony didn’t hold any hope that Hammer had ordered his betas to keep their hands off.
Then one year… no letter came. Tony dug through and scoured the thousands of letters, but not a single one was from Steve.
“Oh? You don’t know?” Hammer’s smile grew wider. “Anthony Edward Hammer, are you unaware of what you’re carrying?” He laughed. Cruel and rotten. “What kind of bearer
“No, I don’t,” Bruce agreed, “but I want to. What do you say?”
Rhodey shook his head. “I didn’t mean now, Captain. He’s not getting near pliers for at least a year.”
“What happened?” Tony said as low as he could, hoping Thor was the only one to hear. He didn’t want to appear rude.
Tony snorted but none the less curled himself a bit more to have his inner thigh wrap slightly around the little machine. Then Jarvis decided he didn’t want to get left behind and abandoned his usual spot on Tony’s shoulder and casually walked to where Vision had disappeared and entered the coat without another sound.
Steve placed a soft kiss on his forehead while he chewed. “That’s good. Good. Perfect, Sweetheart.”
Hope you enjoyed!
Rhodey gave him a wolfish grin. “Just making sure you're actually real.”
He… had been spoiled, he realized. His pack,
Tony had curled around Vision and Jarvis had nested on his shoulders and were seconds away from sleep when Tony heard shuffling to his side, inches away. When Tony lifted his head to turn and see he found Bruce had placed his coat right next to him, close, as if sleeping with a pack. It was trust now. Bruce still looked to hesitate but he wanted it and so Tony reached out to lick his hand in acceptance and inched closer as he curled again.
“Tony,” Jan appeared remorseful. She held her head and ears down. “What happened back there, I’m sorry.”
“And you?” Bucky said to Rhodey.
From above Jarvis was flying and trying to claw what he could reach. He was aiming for the attacker’s face, scratching and pecking and screeching in anger. Vision was struggling to release himself from the bag he was in, shouting obscenities that the attacker didn’t understand.
“It doesn’t because I left my old pack. Call it retirement if you want, but the leave they gave me wasn’t enough time. I needed more to scour every road and every stone and every forest and every inch of land to look for you.”
Bruce and Loki, having their conclusion proven correct, nodded approvingly, but didn’t look completely satisfied. Probably had something to do with the fact that he still hadn’t revealed to their packmates everything.
Tony felt the knot begin to grow and get caught by his walls, keeping them locked together and pushing Steve further inside him. The burning cum that his alpha released was sucked in eagerly by his body, every drop milked and welcomed.
Tony made a sharp turn around a tree and in a clearing that appeared to be place solely for the purpose of a battle he found his pack all gathered on one side and a lone shifter on the other. His eyes took in every detail, every speck of figure, the intense black coat, the dark eyes, the size and the sharp shape. The new shifter was very much an alpha wolf and exactly who Tony thought it was.
“We’ll have to hunt then and find a spot to settle.” On cue, every bit of the alpha leader Steve was had appeared. He refused to move away from Tony as he barked orders for them to move. “Those who can, go on the hunt. Those who can’t, grab all the equipment. Jarvis, Redwing, can you find us a secured spot to rest for the night? Near a source of water is preferred.”
They hadn’t before and they wouldn’t start now, but the possibility of eyes, even if not from his packmates, made him shiver in disgust.
He stopped running long after the sight of his pack disappeared behind the brush of the forest and the familiar scents vanished under unfamiliar odors. The panic had slowly lessened and logic and common sense finally decided to make an appearance and aid his train of thoughts. He had run away from the consequences of his choices, from his pack and from his mate. There was no denying that. A cowardly omega seemed a more fitting image than the great Iron Man as the locals of Hattan had referred to him as.
All the approval and respect Tony could’ve asked for.
show off was almost too strong to resist. The urge to make the alpha - to make
Tony hadn’t realized his voice was getting louder and that Bruce, Jarvis and Natasha were now looking his way. His attention was aimed at Steve who was shocked and had his lower lip wobbling. Tony paid it no mind. He had to finish what he was saying to finally get the alpha to stop. “If this is your way of getting back at me, I get it. I’ll never bother you or your pack again. Just please stop whatever it is you’re doing. I’m not -” he cleared his throat and looked down.
The omega hesitated before reaching out to carefully grasp the hand. “Bruce Banner.”
And seeing Bruce clear his throat while turning away in an attempt to hide his coloring cheeks was well worth it.
Now he guessed it was time to start learning. He was among the betas and omegas without a place to be. He was now the one to be pitied.
Tony followed the voice. His family turned a corner.
“I was so worried,” he said when he pulled back, taking a sharp inhale. “When Pepper told us what happened I feared the worse. You were taken from right under me. From our home. Where you were meant to be safe in my protection. You were all taken just like that and I couldn’t do anything to stop it.”
“Exactly,” Steve stopped rumbling but was still glaring. “That question was disrespectful, and if Tony had been Peggy you’d be on the ground right now. There’s teasing and then there’s being rude. You crossed the line, Buck.”
“Yeah, yeah. Work me to the bone why don’t you.”
Tony, for the most part, watched the pack go back and forth, blushing at Thor’s choice of wordings. Feeling a little lost he turned to Bruce, who raised an eyebrow at him and said, “Don't look at me. I'm not getting on the Captain's bad side.”
It was - it was almost suffocating how many times Steve was always present and near him. His scent was everywhere. Tony wasn’t able to escape it. Every intake he took of his alpha musk always left him warm and content and he loved every second of it. The protective suffocation included. All the touches the alpha gave, all the kisses, the hand holding, the grooming, Tony cherished every moment of it. It was everything he had always imagined for himself, all brought forth by the Captain, leader of the Avengers, by Steve Rogers. The alpha was slowly winning his old, tired, and broken heart. What little of it was left.
The sun was fading, the travel had been long and, according to Clint and Sam, who have been talking nonstop about wanting to bathe the moment they made it home, the Avengers’ house was minutes away and all Tony wanted to do was find something soft and just lie down on it. Didn’t matter if it was a bed or a rug, so long as it was softer than the ground Tony was going to get knocked out on it.
“Who are you to demand that?” Steve growled.
It was no secret he had sex. It was also no secret the Avengers lived with him. It was also-also no secret when Tony returned after an impromptu night out. Back to his home. Where the Avengers also resided. Using the same living space.
“I’m calm,” the alpha confirmed for him. Their packmates waited carefully.
“Surprise, I hope you like it,” Steve’s eyes were brighter than the sky.
Clint backed off. “I get it, sheesh. Tony is off limits.”
, Tony still couldn’t understand. If one had the option to pick between an old omega with scars and issues and a young and beautiful beta that knew what she wanted and was not afraid to get it, he’d imagine a lot would pick the beta. Confidence was a very attractive feature and Tony… didn’t carry a lot of confidence. Not when it came to getting what he wanted.
“I keep telling you not in public, Tony.”
Tony grinned at her. “Pepper, you’re wearing Van Dyne footwear. Those are the highest in demand.”
“Come on, share with the rest of us,” Clint whined.
It would have been better if Steve hadn’t remembered anything, as opposed to being given so little and have his mind trying to fill in the gaps of what could’ve happened. Taunted by imagery that could’ve been and couldn’t, until his sanity would eventually snap.
The praise sent a spark of pleasure down his spine, the approval filling his chest with joy. How long had it been since someone complimented him? The last time he remembered approval for something was when he made the gauntlets and presented them to Hammer and Stane and even then it was only a “Finally, I’m getting what I was promised.”
“If you were so sick that they thought you dead before growing out of infancy, how were you always fighting?” Tony didn’t understand. How was a sickly child even fighting in the first place?
Tony sniffed around the shack to make sure it was truly empty. Besides the scent of an inhabitant that had recently used the shack, it smelled earthy with a mix of rust and rotten wood. Satisfied no other shifter was sleeping and would pounce him the moment he placed a paw inside he pushed the door open and circled the shack a couple of times. He dropped the wolf-bag he was carrying that had his clothes and gauntlets and a few coins on the center of the floor before curling up around it. When it came to traveling and sleeping in the outdoors or in shacks, being in wolf form was easier and comfier than being in human form. Especially when the ground was used as a bed. Easier on his bones.
“This is your room for the duration of your cycle,” she said with a required kind smile down to them. “You’ll find everything you need next to the bed. Water and some food will be placed outside your door shortly. When you’re done place the plate upward if you want more or place it upside down if you don’t. Please remember to keep your door locked and secure for both your safety and the safety of our other patrons. If you need anything else I’ll be downstairs.” With a final nod, she turned and headed back to the stairs and disappeared, leaving them to it.
“And you’re hunting again.”
oblivious!”
Pepper landed in front of them with a bit of a tumble. Her breathing hard and erratic. “No signs of any statues. There is nothing for miles. All dirt and stone.”
Sam was kind of like Natasha and Clint. He was a grown man. He knew about the birds and the bees. He didn’t care, but he was thoughtful enough to remind Tony that “it’s not love without a glove, man,” and made sure he didn’t go off and accidentally create the next generation of Stark. So far, there hadn’t been a sign of it happening, and Tony planned on keeping it that way. While he may be a playboy, he was also a careful one. Protection, lubrication, the works. Always in his pocket. No exceptions. He made it to his forties with a clean bill of sexual health for a reason. He planned on keeping that record secured.
“No,” Tony quickly cut in, “nothing like that. The exact opposite, actually.”
“Stop,” for lack of where to place his hands, he settled for Steve’s biceps just to have contact, “don’t hurt yourself.”
, not just an individual. No matter how much his instincts fought to do so.
The area smelled of mold, rotten wood, and rusted metal. It was horrid. This wasn’t a warm welcome. It wasn’t anything close to the warm welcome the mansion had greeted him with the first time the Avengers brought him in. This place Hammer dragged him to. It wasn’t home.
“How about we stay here and use big words to throw any eavesdroppers off? I can be very creative,” Tony offered. “Jarvis can keep an eye out and warn us when someone is getting too close.”
The workshop was incredible to look at and Tony couldn’t get enough. He ran, he prodded, he asked all the questions. He smiled and he laughed. As bright as a child could. He loved it so much he practically ran circles around Thor and Loki all day, wanting to know everything, wanting to create.
Then the most peculiar thing happened. Before Tony could voice his concern Natasha faced Bruce with the most expressionless face possible and held out her hand that had a fish for him to take. This would have been fine and normal had she just given it without a second thought or second glance. Doing so would’ve meant she was giving the fish as a friendly gesture, but Natasha was staring right at him and held out her hand with purpose, waiting for him to either accept or reject the fish. For human form this was the equivalent of a canine sharing their meal with interest to another canine, almost similarly to a leader eating first with their mate.
He ran a finger over the surface, collecting the small amount of dust it managed to gather. A feeling grew within him. One he hadn’t felt in so long with the looming dread hanging over him at Hammer’s and Stane’s presence.
, that they were there, what were the odds that they would travel near the territory of his pack, somehow end up meeting his pack and finding him? And from the way Rhodey demanded the location of someone he was pretty sure was meant to be him, he could take a guess and figure out it wasn’t all a huge coincidence.
“I was… I -” he took a deep breath, inhaling Steve’s alpha scent and gaining courage. “I went to ask for work at… at the blacksmith.”
“No, I - I…” this wasn’t Hammer or Obie, this wasn’t Hammer or Obie, this wasn’t Hammer or… or
This was his. This entire collection of smithy tools were his. They were giving this to him. All of them. Their entire pack helped set it up. Steve had been busy putting all this together.
The very ground shook as they paraded down the road. Bystanders watched as they disappeared, gazes trailing, before wisely returning indoors. Even when out of the village Tony still felt eyes on them, and probably for good reason. They were currently the main center of attention. It wasn’t every day that a war pack off to battle marched the very roads used by packs of all varieties, and even less for shifters to be lucky enough to see them. When the opportunity came they would grab it with both hands and take in as much as they could, telling the tale of seeing the war pack with their own eyes to friends and family and strangers.
“Are you serious?” Tony blurted out. His eyes narrowing. “Do you both genuinely want a relationship, or are you just playing around?”
Steve padded the ground in order to get their attention. “We’ll help if that’s the case. It’s our fault for keeping you so long.” He gestured to Natasha with his snout.
A rumbling noise from Steve and his slow breathing signalled him still asleep so Tony dared bury his face even closer, almost cuddling the alpha. Tony released a satisfied sigh and believed he could happily lie there forever. The thought that he was taking advantage of Steve was far away from his mind. It didn’t matter so long as none of the Avengers were awake to see him.
At least he mastered his skills of hiding behind his mask. He refused to give Hammer the satisfaction of a reaction. The alpha received plenty of those during their beginning years together and got too much enjoyment from it. Tony wasn’t going to let him enjoy it for all of twenty years.
Jarvis nipped Tony’s ear affectionately. “I approve of them, Sir.”
They didn’t need to see it in order to know what he and Steve had been up to just moments ago. The smell was enough.
,” Steve stretched out the word and bopped him on his nose, “are enough for me, sweetheart. I don’t know if you’ve noticed but we’ve been intimate more times than the average shifter, and I may be young but even I can’t do the impossible in the span of a day. You bring that out of me.”
“Well behaved, huh? Oh sure, I remember your well behaved ass jumping over old man Harold's fence after running over his garden. You are the epitome of the perfect child.”
“My childhood pack wasn’t made up of blacksmiths, more like it was led by one well-known blacksmith that made a fortune with it. I grew up with the title expected of me.”
Well, this one took longer than I originally thought. Gotta love family. They always want your attention.
Peter pouted. “Why?”
At least Rhodey, Bruce, Pepper and Happy had a pack they deserved after all their hardship, and if he’s able to he could possibly convince Rhodey to take in Jarvis and Vision as well. Keep them happy, healthy and safe while he lived amongst the shacks again until the end of his days.
So here they were. The carriage was customized to allow Peter to reach the reins properly. Of course, the reins were really superficial since Tony would be in charge in all manner of speaking, but it gave Peter the official feeling he wanted.
a father?
“She’s not joking,” Sam confirmed. “First few days he’s going to want to stay close. Did so with every one of us, but I get the feeling since he wants you as more than just a friend it’s going to be worse.”
That was an opportunity if Tony ever saw one. It was his chance. “Is there a reason for that? For everyone avoiding you, I mean,” he asked as he sat in front of the other omega.
Since Halloween is right around the corner I just wanna say be safe if you're gonna trick or treat. Them clowns worry me. Don't go alone, bring friends or family! And share you're candy with me.
Oh, all right, that was unexpected. Tony kneeled down to be somewhat at eye level with the child. “You didn’t have to get into a fight for me. I’m not worth getting into a fight for, trust me, but thanks for defending my honor,” Tony poked the tip of the child's nose playfully.
For now all Tony had was time. While his situation was far from ideal, his saving grace was the circumstance in which Hammer was acting out his plan. The carriage was both his shelter and his prison. Hammer couldn’t act so long as the carriage was still in motion. He couldn’t risk slowing it down for a second and he had to stay on top of the situation, lest a wrench get thrown in and ruin everything. He hardly gave Tony more than a glance. Even if the alpha felt safe by their distance and progress, safe wasn’t enough to stop the Avengers.
“I don’t want to know,” Sam mumbled, wary.
Tony settled against his alpha’s side happily, listening to his pack. Relishing in the fact he could do this again after believing otherwise. Not having to worry. Not carrying any fear for himself or his pups. Just peace and rest, followed shortly with a quick wash in the pond when Steve finished his meal.
“I’m not leaving you alone.”
Tony breathed out and gently, “All right.” More emotions in those two words than what was possible.
hurting you I’m going to hunt him down and chop off his pride.”
at the confidence Steve showed for Sharon. He knew his worries were irrational. Steve and Sharon had history long before Tony had arrived, but what Tony would do for Steve to show that same confidence in him to others. To be proud. Probably not equal to Sharon and her leading skills, but perhaps be proud of Tony’s skill in smithing. To let others know to trust his mate with their tools and have faith he’d improve upon them.
He looked away, not daring to run and earn Steve’s attention faster. He smelled and heard the fight continue. The whines of his attackers and the cries of pain they created and Steve’s snarling and growling. The noises didn’t last long. Soon, they died down to nothing but quiet whimpers that eventually was joined by rushed and uneven footsteps that slowly disappeared. Tony steeled himself for what was to come next, ready to endure and ready to do what he could to give Jarvis and Vision a running chance.
“Tony, what is this?” Pepper asked while gawking as gracefully as she could. Her sharp eyes taking in every single detail.
It’s obvious what he’s capable of. What will stop him from rampaging?
The alpha tucked his hands behind his back and his shoulders swayed with every step taken. A big smile on his face. For one reason or another, he appeared overjoyed from just strolling through the forest. Perhaps he really enjoyed walks or the smell of green and water, or maybe it had been a long time since he walked through a forest for the relaxation of it without the worry of getting attacked. Who knew? Steve must have been thinking of something wonderful in order to be smiling that big.
“I’m sorry, Sweetheart, I’m sorry.”
Steve took notice how the dirt sticking together created a tunnel wide enough to drive a truck through and many agents were carefully avoiding coming into contact with the dirt. He also noticed the deeper they went in the tunnel the more agents were wearing twice as much clothing in an attempt to stay warm. Puffs of smoke released from his mouth as the temperature dropped and he made a mental note to complain to Peggy about secrecy preventing a forewarning to bring something warm to a freezing location.
Another turn around the area and Vision neared the edge again, causing Tony to kneel on one leg and prepare himself to sprint and get the machine. His movement made the Avengers still sitting down straighten up and look to the machine for any visible dangers. Steve had a hand up and was reaching out to grasp his shoulder when the giant lion took a sharp turn to pounce on Vision, but instead of pinning him down like he would with prey, the circular body of the machine prevented him from getting a hold and sent him rolling forward and over the edge of the river. With a splash, Vision began a strand of panicked sounds as he tried with all his might to roll back on land. Even if the Avengers didn’t understand Vision’s language the sounds of hysterics was all too recognizable for them to mistake it for anything else.
almost killed yourself in the process,” Tony said with a heavy sigh.
Peter inhaled sharply and, in the distance, the Goblin laughed.
He knew the feel of Venom’s jabs and the damage they wrought. Hell, he was still recovering from the latest punctures but, never in a million years, did he think the symbiote to turn on Peter like that! Hyperventilating, Wade fell forward, just catching himself with his hands and gasped, “Baby boy?!” Could he hear him?? Venom had torn apart Wade’s insides, had he not had his advanced healing ability, he’d be dead right now.
He’d see Peter again later that night and that was good enough.
She was an older woman with white hair cut short in a fluffy pixie style. She wore the traditional black robes and dark square glasses. She met Steve’s gaze and held it as he walked into the room. He was led to his lawyers, the handcuffs were removed, and he was seated in a plush chair. The lawyers murmured something to him but he did not hear them. All of his attention was focused on this woman as their gazes were still locked.
Steve shrugged and murmured, “It was just something Natasha and Bucky said.”
Steve heart twisted within his chest, wishing what Tony’s fevered mind believed to be true. He knew Tony had told the suit to stay in France until it was May, a few weeks away… As it was, he wouldn’t have been able to do it without risking the future.
“What do you mean?”
“Wait –!”
Tony’s eyes flashed with pain and he whispered, “This is wrong.”
“You’re going to have to go through a little fanfare before you can get home,” Natasha informed him as he sat down across from her. They were in a limo. Steve had never been in one before so he inspected the lavish interior with a curious eye.
“So next time I get to see her right?” Peter asked excitedly.
Steve lightly tapped his forehead to Tony’s and smiled at him as his eyes glistened.
Steve saw them first and greeted, “Good Afternoon, guys! Sleep in?”
“Sorry,” he whispered. He turned toward the elevator and asked Peter, “So Animal Crackers? Which animal is the tastiest?”
Tony wouldn’t do it. It was an empty threat. He knew Steve wanted to avoid more attention from the media. It was bad enough when they found out one of the Avengers had a child. The Tower had been surrounded by reporters and none of them could leave the building without getting accosted by the media. Now that they knew Peter was his, he knew all their attentions will be focused on Steve and only Steve. He could not imagine what would happen if they found out he was gay too. He could see their numbers tripling, maybe even quadrupling...Then again, it might be too late to prevent that detail about himself from getting out.
” Steve gasped madly. He barely noticed the pain. He just imagined Tony worriedly looking over holograms, looking for Steve, and then hearing his implant reset. He’d think Steve was dead.
“I know you, Stevie,” Bucky murmured.
But he was doing all of this for Steve. He
He locked his phone and tossed it on the bed beside him. Wade pouted, “What did you write?”
“Captain!” The judge called out to him, “Please face forward and stop interacting with the witness.”
He did not want Tony to touch him. He was uncomfortable.
Peter reached out to grab Steve’s dog-tags, forgetting he was in Tony’s arms, and found only Tony’s reactor. He did not grab the dog-tag still hanging on his wrist but clamped onto the reactor through the fabric of Tony’s shirt. Peter murmured, “Wha’s happening?”
He was trying to do everything within his power to not think about tonight.
Steve tensed as he recognized the voice and Thor’s expression grew serious.
He drove fast and wild, making it near impossible to be shot as he traveled. Eventually, he reached his destination, the street he and Bucky grew up on in Brooklyn. It had changed drastically since he last saw it. The old brownstones, which used to house dozens of families in small apartments, were now mostly storefronts. Some of the larger buildings still had apartments on the upper levels but there seemed to be only young couples living there now. The only families who were on the street were the ones who were shopping at the quaint stores.
His uncle smiled sadly at him and replied, “She would have to be crazy if she didn’t, Peter.”
Tony looked down at Steve as the man remained unmoved by the commotion and took his phone out of his pocket as he asked, “J, what was that?”
“I'm fine,” Steve grimaced. “But Peter – Friday, did he really leave?”
Bucky hugged him back, his entire form shaking, probably with the same happy tears streaming from Tony’s eyes.
In Peter’s bedroom, Steve moved more slowly. He made sure to grab everything his son would need for a long stay away from the Tower. Clothes, toys, and other essentials were needed and he packed them all away in a second duffel. He huffed the bag, plus the bag filled with his own clothes, over his shoulder and was making his way out of the room when he paused by Peter’s bed.
In the last five minutes on his tablet, Tony had seen at least ten different versions of his and Steve’s parting in pictures, video, and gifs. Their kiss was examined, grieved, and pitied by the masses.
“Or you two can just not go,” Coulson interceded.
Steve tightened his arms around him and kissed his forehead again. They all should have done things differently... He didn’t want to linger on the hurt. He just wanted to simply…be.
When Tony later reflected on it, he’d swear he was only meaning to comfort Steve. What was going through his mind at the time, Tony could not tell. All he knew was Steve was upset and he wanted to do
“O-Only Bucky knows the entire truth…” Steve stated.
Steve’s breathing had evened out and Tony took it as a sign that he’d fallen asleep and was waiting for him in their dreams. Tony smiled and willed his body to do the same.
nothing.
Bucky started to come out of his shell too. He talked more, expressed his opinion, and let that old Brooklyn accent slip through a few times. His smiles were still too far in between but Tony was working on that.
Tony reached out and grasped his shoulder reassuringly. He whispered, “Hey, don’t worry. I’ll get him the best representation money could buy!”
The rest of the Avengers watched this exchange from the couch. Clint had a bowl of popcorn sitting on his lap and was busy adding hot Tapatio sauce to it. Leaning into Clint, Natasha had Peter sitting on her lap and was bouncing him gently on her knee. Sitting on Natasha’s other side, sat Tony with a tablet on his lap. He watched the exchange between Thor and Steve with amusement. Bruce sat next to Tony and had been looking over something on Tony’s tablet with him but he too was watching Steve and Thor with a small smile.
“Bucky,” Steve hissed. “It’s me, Steve, remember?”
He stared at her outstretched hand as she spoke. His gaze was unreadable. For all she knew, he was calculating the best way to kill her.
Steve reached over the board and ran his hand over Tony’s soft hair. He smiled warmly at the boy in front of him and Tony returned the smile.
Tony eventually determined his soulmate was not using his program.
Bucky leaned into his chin and thoughtfully stared ahead at the line of soldiers marching. Tony was definitely shell-shocked and his ailing health may be affecting his judgement but…
“What?”
Steve bowed his head until his forehead was pressed to the hand he held and whispered, “I know…but…”
“Wha-What the hell is in your chest?” Bucky demanded.
Tony clenched his teeth and tore his hands out of Steve’s hands. Tony wrapped his arms around his head and buried Steve’s face into his chest. Steve quickly wound his arms around Tony’s back and drew him closer, breathing deeply as he tried to calm down.
Steve excitedly dove into the food as he finished his account. Tony ordered pizzas and, just as Steve was wrapping up his story, they arrived.
Peter was hovering over him a second later and then Steve was next to Peter and grasping Tony’s face, demanding, “Are you alright??”
Tony’s eyes widened as he realized his mistake and he looked to Steve for confirmation. Steve minutely nodded to him and his mind raced trying to come up with a way to explain away Tony’s slip.
“I’ll do it in a couple hours. I just want to lay down for a bit before I have to deal with them again,” Peter sighed.
The older couple nodded and with a heavy sigh Steve sat across from the couple. He explained, “Hydra had taken… pieces of me when I was still unconscious from being frozen. With it they tried to recreate a super solider…They were successful on only one account….They had taken my,
One was a video from his high school graduation, someone who had bought the graduation on DVD probably recorded his part and posted it. Peter bitterly bit his lip and did not click it. The video icon was of him and Gwen embracing. The faded memory of kissing Gwen on the stage made a pulse of grief thrum through him.
Steve handed him the tablet. The files were already open and Tony swiped through them. There were dozens of pictures. Some were rough sketches but others were fully detailed and colored images. Most were images from the workshop and, yes, the majority revolved around Tony in various states of work.
“To make you vomit maybe,” she replied. “I will suffer the headache and nausea for another hour or so. You, on the other hand, shall enjoy being sick the rest of the day.”
hard.
“And maybe if they spend some time together they’ll realize how much they care for each other,” Pepper murmured with exacerbation.
Tony was going to survive.
Steve smiled sadly at him and replied in a hushed tone, “Everything about this is wrong.”
“You don’t think I didn’t notice?” Steve teased but Wade didn’t hear it because his heart was beating against his rib cage so powerfully that he could only hear the drumming of his body. He flushed, imagining Peter talk about him in such a way and his stomach tightened with either elation or indigestion…maybe both.
He was shaking slightly so Tony knew the super solider needed a moment to regain his composure. He wound his arms around Steve and rested his head on top of his. He closed his eyes and was forced to consider the other implications the palladium poisoning meant, namely what it meant for his future.
They grabbed all four of his limbs and lifted him up with loud grunts of exertion. They moved quickly to one of the large tents. They were speaking urgently to him but he still could not understand them. More orange clad bodies were running toward them as the raised voices drew in the rest of the camp.
“Yeah,” Tony whispered, carding his fingers into Steve’s. “Just like his dad...”
“No, I’m not,” Steve protested as soon as the words left her lips.
Peter leaned in, with his ear right next to Thor’s communicator, and heard his dad reply, “No.”
The sun slowly drifted down to the skyline and it took him a few hours to realize that it was not dipping below the horizon.
“You’re going to be a great hero, Peter,” Pops whispered into his ear. Peter grinned and looked past Pops’ shoulder to his other father.
“Hey! Death Ray!” Tony yelled to get the man’s attention. The man’s head snapped over in Tony’s direction but he couldn’t tell if he understood his sarcastic call due to the oxygen mask covering his face. The man clearly noted Tony being on the enemy force as he fired at Tony almost instantly. Tony jumped behind an upturned Jeep and then lifted his ray gun and fired back.
Tony finally broke eye contact with Steve to meet the gaze of the approaching Commando. The others jogged over to see how Tony was doing. Tony grinned at all of them and replied, “I’m good! A little banged up but Dr. Jones here fixed me up!”
James bit down on his lip and drew blood. The hot metallic taste of it ran thickly over his tongue. The tremors grew worse and Steve held him tighter. He whispered into James’s ear, “I’ve got you, Buck.
His vision dipped into darkness for a second and, in that moment, he remembered the first time his son smiled at him. It had been tentative and uncertain but it had been directed solely at Tony. It was the first sign to him that Peter was willing to make a connection and place his cautious trust in his birthfather.
Peter bit down on his lip and Wade’s smile got a fraction smaller. He breathlessly asked, “Baby boy?”
“And what is SHIELD?” Steve demanded, trying to stay calm but he was nervously clutching his fists.
They mapped out their fake relationship the rest of the night. Deciding on what the milestones of their relationship would be and crafting it to be believable and, as Tony quoted, “boring enough” that even the skeptics would have trouble finding faults.
Steve let it happen.
“My birth?” Peter asked, raising a single brow in confusion. “I’m sorry, I don’t know what you are talking about…Was I born under a symbolic heroic eclipse or something?”
I hear we had an eventful day,” Clint said with a grin.
When the video ended, Tony tipped his head back into Steve’s chest so he could meet Steve’s gaze and grinned at him. Tony excitedly stated, “We’re not too late!”
happened in that little patch of time…
. They betrayed us, killed Richard, tortured me, and tried to kill me too! And Steve Rogers works for them!”
Venom was a beast now. He could influence it like a trainer would do a lion. Use human victims to lead him where he would do the most damage to SHIELD.
He killed Tony.
Tony laughed and said, “Nah! Nope! That ship sailed a long time ago! We're both big kids now, practically adults! I think we got it covered.”
“I – I killed your parents,” Bucky gasped.
,” Steve gasped suddenly, partially sitting up.
Tony came to a stop in secluded area that would give them the privacy they required. Steve’s emotions were at war with themselves as he stared down at the shorter man. He couldn’t help but think him handsome, even now as he was frowning unhappily at Steve.
“You’re one tough punk,” the boy beside him in the trash moaned.
“How’d it go?” Bruce asked.
“What was that, lovely?” Tony whispered, his eyes were so dark that Steve could no longer tell they were hazel. Tony cupped himself through his jeans and began to lazily stroke himself. Steve’s own dick throbbed as if Tony’s phantom fingers brushed against him. He bit down on his bottom lip and focused on Tony’s eyes, hoping to escape the feeling of his phantom fingers but his eyes were worse than watching him stroke his cock. In his eyes, he could see Tony’s desire. He see Tony taking in his body, he could see his want, he could see his fantasies, and he could see the sexual prowess that promised to consume Steve whole.
“Our Enigma is being elusive,” Tony retorted with a chuckle. His eyes flickered to a news story playing in the background and it caught his attention when he saw his name on it in connection to a gala he hosted annually. Was it that time of year already?...Why hadn’t anyone told him about it?
Steve snorted, remembering not ten minutes ago Tony making a similar exclamation about them not being married.
Tony caressed his cheek, staring at him lovingly, then whispered, “Give me your hand.”
Tony chuckled. He wrapped his arms behind Steve’s neck and kissed him in a way that made his toes tingle.
Howard nodded and started ordering the Commandos to various stations. He went up to the time machine and carefully removed the tesseract from its case and placed it into the one hole that seemed designed for it. Months prior, Tony had thrown Howard and his team out of the time machine in fear of him breaking it, luckily, his glimpse of its inner working gave him a vague idea of what connected to what but…operating the damn thing well…that was another story…
right now!”
“Do you see how tight these pants are?” Steve countered and turned around, so Tony could marvel at the tailorship that went into the perfect cupping of Steve’s ass.
Steve was.
“Let’s make it a family adventure,” Steve said and Tony bumped playfully into his side.
Steve’s eyes returned to his and he said, “I wanted to say I was sorry.”
finished turning into a black tee as he stated, “Funny story…It sort of is mine…I forgot to tell you…”
After the meal, however, Peter knew he needed to go.
“Oh! Of course! I’ll show you the way out! Where is your time machine? Are you using the one in France again?”
The rest of the Avengers quickly joined them.
Peter relaxed into Wade’s hold. His nerves melted away. He knew he could trust Wade’s words. He broke from the embrace and said, “I am
Steve hissed in disbelief, grasping Bucky tightly. With a strangled voice, he gasped, "You can't -!"
“My name is Tony Stark and I'm not afraid of you. I know you're a coward, so I decided... that
Tony wore a mocking shocked expression and sarcastically gasped, “No! Name one instance!”
Many were using biology to find a way to fight cancer or other deadly microorganisms, but, barely anyone was using it to defend people from larger, outside attacks. Most relied on mechanical or computer science for that…but, Peter and Eddie, they were going to change all of that.
The elevator doors opened and Tony tore his eyes from the bar in time to see T’Challa arrive. The team called out greetings and he nodded to them in turn. T’Challa called out to Peter as he walked over to him and Peter stepped away from his game to meet the Wakandan King halfway.
,” Howard groaned.
Peter dropped his package and grasped his shirt as forcefully as he could, pulling it tightly across the back of his neck. He broke himself from the man’s hold and slammed himself into the glass to escape. He heard it crack behind him but he didn’t notice as he was too busy staring at the man in horror.
Peter grasped his hand and leaned it on Wade’s thigh as he whispered, “You’re making a very serious face right now. You should be laughing at my Pops’ lame-ass jokes.”
“But he thinks he can help?” Peggy pressed.
May shook her head and mumbled something about teenagers under her breath. Peter smirked but said no more. He pulled out some cereal and, in no time, was eating at the table. He watched his aunt’s back as she finished her cleaning then asked her, “What are you doing today?”
Bucky turned to Tony and asked, “So what are we like in the future? Do all of us still hang out or did we all split up after the War? Does Gabe go back to school? Does Steve go back to drawing?? Come on future man, tell us!”
“…In my future, that Bucky died on that train just like yours did today,” Tony whispered. Steve’s breath hitched as he imagined the timeline. Was Bucky fated to die no matter what? The thought crushed Steve further. Tony struggled as he tried to continue, “…It – It…” Tony paused again and then quietly stated more slowly, “The same day I decided to save his life was the day that the future changed and, it may have been because of our relationship but…but I think it was mostly because of my resolute decision on
“Okay,” she said and pushed him toward the door.
“Captain?” Coulson questioned when his silence stretched.
With his adrenaline rushing, Tony pushed open the door and stepped into the other room.
This future was different than Tony’s.
Steve glared at him and the Red Skull chuckled.
Thor grinned and asked, “What vexes you?”
Steve brushed back Peter’s hair and said, “Nothing. Do you want down?”
Tony half expected both men to have another hug out but Steve surprised him by retorting to Bucky, “You’ll get used to it.”
He opened his arms and Steve stepped into them. Embracing Iron Man was a whole lot different than Tony. His hold was cold, hard, and strong but beneath it all was the man Steve was coming to love. He lay his cheek against the warm arch reactor in Tony’s chest and closed his eyes. Iron Man took off with a sudden jolt and Steve tightened his hold on his fellow Avenger.
Tony chuckled and laid out the blanket as he replied, “I might take you up on that offer.”
Steve walked over the Bucky and picked up his son. He sat next to Bucky, placing Peter on his lap and said, “You can’t deny that you never saved my life.”
men and hear their dreams, not of glory…but of a normal future...
Tony had done nothing wrong. Everything he did –
It was not how Steve had ever imagined a confession of love to go over…
Steve turned back to the man and Wade added, “Please?”
He did not need to come out to Natasha but he did inform her that he was telling everyone else. Natasha smirked smugly and told him she was proud of him.
Bucky frowned and dropped his gaze as he replied, “No, no I don’t remember that…”
“Don’t talk like that –
He had to tell Tony the truth. Steve was dead. That was why he was always there and never awake. That was why he did not age…but…
Peter glanced over to Wade and MJ and replied, “It's great, dad.”
“Then she has to have gotten it,” Steve reasoned.
The robot’s glowing eyes focused on Steve and stated, “My father told me that you were the most honest and genuine man he had ever met. That you were true to your word, no matter the circumstances and, I was hoping you’d place your trust in me as I will do in you…”
“They just keep coming, I don’t know where they’re getting all these guys,” Tony grumbled.
And then Gwen’s death.
It was night and the room was awash in shadows. Bucky’s eyes gleamed in the darkness, reflecting off the streetlamp from outside. In his hands, Steve could make out his fingers running over the barrel of a gun.
From the corner of his eye, Steve noted a small smirk grace the lawyer’s mouth and Marcel murmured, “You are welcome to try either way.”
“Please don’t start patronizing me,” Tony groaned, leaning back into the bed. No, this wasn’t a bed it was a piece of seventh heaven. Howard was
“Mac’s project!” Eddie gasped.
“…Please don’t tell me there is a twelve-year-old kid waiting in the car that I’ve never met,” Tony asked whoever was at the door and Steve narrowed his eyes.
What did this mean??
It was one last bite from the dead beast and Tony had gotten to close. He should have listened to his father.
Another bout of tears threatened to spill from his eyes and he strangled Peter’s comforter in his hands. He forced himself to breathe and, after a number of gulps, he was able to prevent himself from any crying more. His limbs began to shake and he drew Peter’s blanket to his chest and pretended it was his son he was holding.
“Also a billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, and superhero,” Tony added with a cocky grin.
Cable clapped his shoulder and assured him, “Then we will complete this without incident and you’ll return to a future with Stark alive and well in it.”
When Steve was questioned, they asked him how his day was, how he was adjusting to the new century, or they were generally just nice to him. He somehow became a symbol of perfection and all the media outlets seemed to team up together to keep this glowing holy image of their Captain.
…what was he going to do now?
Upon Steve’s appearance, he’d completely forgotten she was here. He sheepishly grinned at her but she did not seem to take offense.
Steve leaned into him but his eyes had the blank gaze of someone more preoccupied with dark internal thoughts than what was going on in front of him.
“Beta Jarvis Engaged.”
Peter leaned back into his chair and stared at Rogers for a moment. He stated, “I don’t trust you. I don’t trust America’s Poster Boy.”
Anyways, thanks for reading my rant!
And he was going to survive with Steve at his side.
“He mush be stopped!” Peter said, raising the Iron Man toy.
Wade was not in the know and was prattling on about what he thought Tony was going to unveil. All of his guesses were obviously wrong but Peter did not spoil his fun as he described the outlandish Iron Man suits he came up with that contained upgrades like a pancake launcher.
The idiom flew over Steve’s head and he looked at the woman questionably. Ms. Potts noticed and she stated, “It can’t get out that he’s gay…or I guess the more appropriate term would be bisexual…Either way, our investors will flip.”
Coulson’s heart rose to his throat and for a moment he feared he would not be able to reply. He swallowed thickly and adjusted his grip on the phone as he stated, “Good. Forward me and the retrieval team the coordinates immediately.”
“…Needless to say, you'll also have to put a hold on that honeymoon,” Pepper murmured.
“By the time we are done here, this place is going to be crawling with reporters,” Tony murmured to Steve.
“That is why we are here,” Howard said. A small trail of smoke was coming out of the reactor’s seam. Howard ordered, “Jacques get me a light. Steve, Bucky, get ready to hold him down in case this gets painful. The rest of you stay out of my way.”
His words gutted Tony. He crumpled in on himself and choked on the words as if they caused him pain, “It’s all I’ve been thinking about ever since arriving in this era. I…I had to consider everything, Steve.
!” Peter gasped, his voice aghast.
The school year stretched out and seemed to last forever but eventually summer came and Steve no longer had to sulk while his boy was gone. Peter would still have playdates with the children from school but Ben set them up with Steve.
As soon as Natasha took over in Steve’s first aide, Bucky leapt up and hugged Steve again. This time they both unabashedly wept into each other’s shoulder.
last night,” Bucky retorted, sarcastically.
Jarvis did not reply but Peter could feel hundreds of Jarvis’s cameras focus on him.
Steve watched Tony from the corner of his eye, repressing a smile.
He did not move but his eyes slowly spanned the room and then focused back on her face. He asked, “Schmidt?”
“You could be an Avenger if you only work with us!” Steve argued and grasped Tony’s shoulder, forcing him to look back at him.
“Don’t move,” Peter said. “And Pops, please stop looking at me like that.”
Thanks again for reading!
Indecision was warring within the super soldier.
Hmmm, is the next chapter a chance to reveal my love of classic rock or does it contain a literal or figurative clue? Hehehehehe
“Get down, Mr. President!” The agent opposite him jumped over the desk and shoved him underneath. Steve removed his shield and stepped in front of the desk. The gunshots grew louder as the intruder came closer. Steve waited, peeking over his shield, his body tensed and ready to fight.
‘Glad to be of service,’ Peter texted back.
“I know!” Steve hissed. His eyes focused on Tony’s and he glared. His eyes were red and Tony knew it was not because of the suds. Steve repeated, his voice layered with betrayal,
“Tony,” Steve whispered in question. He reached out to touch his face, but Tony flinched back.
“If it means saving Peter –,” Steve began and Bucky’s parlor became grey.
“Get your own food,” he whispered with a grin and Bucky made a face at him.
“…You mean about Mary blaming me,” Steve whispered in reply. He half buried his face into Tony’s chest as his heart slowed down to a sluggish beat as if it was being dragged down by his growing fear.
With that, he left and set a course for Los Angeles.
-!” Tony yelled, his voice growing tighter from his grief. Tony ripped his arm from Natasha’s hold and stepped away from Barnes, facing the one wall with no one to see him break. Tony slammed the wall with both of his fists and fell into the wall with a cry. Almost like a toddler having a tantrum, he repeatedly hit the wall. He embraced his anger and kept hitting the wall because, he knew if he embraced the despair, he’d curl into a ball and cry for days on end. As it was, he already felt like a hand had plunged into his heart to tear it out of his chest and all that was left behind was a bleeding crater.
Steve didn’t want the night to end, lying next to Tony and whispering about the stars.
Tony gripped the table tightly and his throat constricted with Steve’s words.
Peter cupped Wade’s face and reminded him, “Just your baby boy, my prince.”
Steve slipped off the stool and buried his fists in his pockets as he walked away from Bruce.
Cable was livid.
tl:dr - I had to rewrite this dang chapter a lot!
There was a murmur down the hall and Tony pressed one last quick kiss onto his mouth and then pulled him back into the hall before anyone saw them pushed together so intimately. Steve grabbed his basket and returned to Tony’s side. Tony smiled warmly at him and they began to walk toward the coal pile like nothing had happened.
,” Peter intoned in a deeper voice.
“Mostly uneventful,” Steve replied, with a twinkle in his eye.
They slowly pulled their faces away from each other’s necks, wary that it wasn’t safe. Steve went to look at Tony to make sure he was okay but Tony did the same, bringing his face much closer than Steve thought it would be.
And Peter suddenly found the draw to his amazing shield lessened as he imagined Wade in his underwear, rocking against Peter, and panting heavily.
. It is tarantula sized in spider proportions,” Wade stated, moving his hips with Peter’s so that they were lightly humping each other. Peter flushed from the obviously overt sex act but he kept moving his hips and the flushed settled into his cheeks with his growing arousal.
Venom crawled uneasily over his skin.
To his relief, he quickly discovered that the majority of the streets still had the same names and he was able to tell he was close to Coney Island.
It wasn’t the crazy mad though, it was the pissed off mad.
Tony jumped back in his suit and the armor sealed around him. He held his arms open to Steve and he jumped into his husband’s arms. They flew down to the others as Tony relayed what Steve just told him.
The doctor ignored him and went back to his colleague. They exchanged a few words then they both went into action. Collecting supplies and a large machine on wheels. They pushed it all towards Steve and Dr. Pavlov finally replied, “I need to scan you to make sure your brain was undamaged.”
“We're all good, Cap,” Tony said, as if reading his mind. “She’s on our side and wants to bring down Fury’s assassin whether it is SHIELD or not. She even has information on the guy who shot Fury.”
He had so many questions and no answers…he still hadn’t noted any changes to the future but…
Coulson’s eyes widened just a fraction and his mouth fell slightly agape but he did not display anything more other emotion other than the calm, relaxed expression he always wore. He quickly recovered and reiterated, “So you have not had any kind of contact with Sergeant Barnes at all?”
“I…I will try…”
Tony smiled happily at Steve and Steve smiled back. They both leaned forward and shared a needed kiss, pouring all their joy and love into it.
dad was!”
Clint was right behind Steve and hit them with enough force to make both of them stager. Clint wrapped his arms around both of them and buried his face into Coulson’s shoulder.
When Tony Stark says he’s getting an island,
Steve collected him into his embrace automatically. It was second nature to him now. This time they didn’t spoon but faced each other. Tony tucked his face into the crook of his shoulder and breathed warm air onto his chest. Steve sighed again as his muscles relaxed into Tony’s familiar form and their collected warmth chased away the chill under the blankets.
“You read my mind,” Tony murmured.
“…Schmidt doesn’t need the words,” he added with emphasis. She nodded as she remembered how easily James had fallen under Schmidt’s command.
Steve flushed and glanced at Tony. His fiancé was already looking at him and was smiling excitedly. Steve grinned at him and only him. He reached out for his hand and Tony grasped it tightly. Not looking away from his lover, Steve said, “You know him very well, Marston.”
,” Steve gasped into his mouth.
He rubbed their hips together and both of them hissed from the contact. Pleasure was practically vibrating throughout Tony’s body. They needed to be having sex yesterday. He couldn’t wait anymore.
Wade and Steve sat on either side of Peter and, as they scooted their chairs in, May carried over the two platters of toast and scrambled eggs she made. It was a smaller breakfast than what Peter had been eating at the Tower, both he and Steve needed to eat more to fed their high metabolisms and Aunt May was still none the wiser to this fact. They all praised her for her cooking either way and split the portions equally between the four of them.
Lastly, he secured Peter’s toy under Tony’s hand so it would not fall if he shifted.
Tony leaned into Steve and commanded, “Jarvis, schedule an appointment with my doctor.”
birthday?”
Ross raised the gun and pointed it at Steve’s head. He said, “To save the world, I am willing to do anything, even kill an American Icon.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are you okay??” They both asked at the same time. They chuckled and separated, both smiling widely.
Most were just getting up and packing up their gear before heading to check in with their commanders or grab breakfast so the halls were relatively empty. Steve made sure to walk fast so most wouldn't note his disheveled appearance.
“SHIELD?” Rogers asked taken aback. “What about them?”
“Coffee shop, down the street,” Steve replied.
“I thought it best that the son of Captain America possess at least one reputable article of his father’s memorabilia,” Coulson stated, nodding his head forward to accept his thanks.
“Who?”
“I love you so much,” Tony stated, a smile clear in Iron Man’s filtered voice.
“Captain? Is there something wrong?” Coulson asked, stepping closer to him.
Coulson nodded them out and picked up his phone as they closed the door behind them. He dialed the number he knew by heart and only had to wait until the second ring until Fury picked up.
Steve tried to ignore the questions thrown at him but he could not help but hear things like:
“I give it fifteen,” Natasha replied, looping her arm through Clint’s. She wore a long black gown with matching elbow length gloves.
But Steve’s chest was bare, exposing numerous wounds and abrasions. Tony was sickened by the damage. They were hurting him badly and he wasn’t healing. Tony gasped to the hologram, “…
The rest of the team was on their way, each member would be arriving separately from their various locations and Tony, in his speed suit with supersonic thrusters, was going to be the first to arrive.
Steve took a steadying breath and closed his eyes, he remembered his last moments with Tony and imagined him there with him, only centimeters away.
Steve placed his shield on Coulson’s desk and stated, “I cannot fight this battle.”
"Only one piece of bacon..." Tony grumbled.
Joy swelled in his chest. He’d been nervous about Peter’s reaction. He knew he was upset by all of this attention and didn’t know how’d he react to an interview where he was the main focus.
“You were amazing,” Steve told him with a light squeeze. Steve blushed and dropped his eyes. He whispered, “I wish I could have done more for you…”
“You shouldn’t put your faith in me so blindly…” He murmured, no looking at her. “My failing to defeat the trigger words just once can be an irreversible,
He just didn’t seem to remember that in the darkness.
Staring at his friend’s smiling face in the photo, Tony found courage and whispered, “I love you.”
As he got closer, Steve was able touch the bottom of the pool so he strode the rest of the way to Tony. The water parted around him in robust ripples and dripped down body his body, tracing all the places Tony wanted his tongue to explore. His hair was damp and clung to his scalp closely and Tony wanted to muss the usually perfectly styled hair.
Tony buried his face into Steve’s chest and clung onto him as he added in a soft voice, “Yensen didn’t make it.”
“Thank you, for your advice, Captain. I think I shall invest 100 percent. Now what is Rogers’ policy on making out in the elevator?”
His soulmate giggled madly and kicked out his legs madly to escape Steve’s touch.
As he was removing the pillow cases from the pillows, Tony called out to him, “Are you going to help me scrub my back or keep napping?”
Tony pointed at his chest and said, “We’ve got a glowingly obvious problem here.”
As soon as Steve woke, he knew he needed to eat but it was a daunting task. How was he supposed to choose who to eat?
Tony leaned back in his chair and collected himself. He needed to appear cool and calm and not like the scared child he felt like he was moments prior. He was Tony Stark after all, and Tony Stark was not afraid of little things like the dark or death.
For the first day, the Avengers testified. One by one they were called up and testified to Steve’s character. Each had a story to tell that illuminated his virtues. They also testified to Steve not knowing Tyler and his stable and happy relationship with Tony. Clint even grumbled about walking in on them and drew a chuckle from the jury box.
Steve ran his fingers through Tony’s hair and lightly pressed a kiss onto the top of his forehead. He replied, “Love you too…”
“Our future son’s crazy, wannabe samurai boyfriend cockblocked us, before kidnapping us to the future. I have the right to be turned on by you in your future Commando pants,” Tony said. He grinned slyly and murmured saucily, “Pun intended.”
Bruce knew he woke by the way he tensed. Peter’s fingers dug into Tony and Tony winced from the pressure. Peter relaxed a moment later as he remembered where he was and he looked questionably at Bruce.
Alone, Peter couldn’t get rid of the symbiote but with Wade and the others…
What opened before him was a hologram of an old, grainy black and white security footage of a road.
“Whatever you think is best, sweetheart,” Steve said with a smirk, lightly tracing Tony’s arm. He no longer feeling as tired as he did when he first entered the bed. His chest was tight with anxiety as he remembered everything he almost lost…again.
This chapter is the darkest out of them all and there are trigger warnings for depression and loss...
Venom had evolved. It could not change its color before. What else could it do?
Agent Steven Edwards.
“Captain,” Natasha called over the communicator. “Cap, do you copy?”
Tony, meanwhile, kept his promise but Steve had forgotten about it until Tony brought it up again.
“I…I don’t need it anymore,” Tony breathlessly whispered.
“You are adorable,” Tony commented, drawing his gaze. “I can’t wait to see you fuss about the actual wedding.”
Steve yawned again and lay his head on Tony’s shoulder. He whispered, “I’ll never leave you like that again.”
They landed on one of the smaller balconies and Wade instantly recognized it as the same balcony he had shared the brief disaster of a dinner with Peter’s family. Wade nervously peered inside, wondering where his parents were…specifically Stark…
New York was being devastated by the Chitauri and the council elected to destroy the city with a nuclear missile to save the rest of the planet.
Sneaky lived up to his name and snuck up on him while he was sitting down with one of these soldiers.
It was so sudden and normal that Peter actually laughed aloud. Hanging out and playing video games sounded like something he used to do on the weekends with his friends. A quick glance at the TV console told him Wade had only the best and was probably an avid gamer.
Tony eventually returned to the dreamworld and Steve was the same, suffering in his agony.
Peter looked up from the shield’s dark mass and saw Eddie enter the lab.
Peter nodded, the move could be felt by both men and they separated.
“Homecoming.”
Peter glanced down at himself and didn’t note a difference. Now that he thought about it, when had he last eaten? The last few hours had been spent as Spidey but he didn’t remember grabbing a bite to eat…with all the excitement over Venom, Peter had been skipping out on meals while he was out swinging…but that couldn’t affect him so drastically and so soon!
“Apparently, we time traveling astronauts,” Tony replied ironically. “And, I need to know, do both of us get grey hair? And who had the clone??”
They did not stop until the sun was beginning to set. The men jumped into action preparing their tents for the night and searching the area for enemy troops. Tony stood aside, not knowing what to do. He was supposed to be playing the part of an army man but he had no idea where his tent was nonetheless how to pitch it. With Steve still weighing heavily on his mind, Tony decided to search for him to have something to do and to not stand out.
“Wait!”
Bucky dropped his head and his face became shadowed and unreadable. He got off the chair and walked away from the bed. He stood in front of the window and peered outside with a hard expression.
Steve looked over his shoulder, praying it was not Kilian. It was one of Tony’s suits. What he saw was actually a relief until he heard Tony.
Was this really happening?
“When we get back to our era I am going to ravish you,” Steve promised, walking ahead so Tony could watch him go.
Marcel smiled and turned back to the juror box presenting the photo of the floral dress. Staring at the twelve people, whose eyes were focused on the image of the dress with looks of shock equal to that of the witness, Marcel stated, “No more questions. We are done with this witness.”
made it??”
! He always made Wade laugh. And don’t get Wade started on that tight bod…
The only thing that assured him was, if they succeeded, then he’d be back in Tony’s arms and they’d be going on that date they talked about like nothing had ever happened.
Howard blinked a few times as if clearing his eyes and then stared at him with wide eyes. It was 1970 so Howard had aged since the late 40s but it was no mistaking it was his father.
Tony rounded the frame and leaned into his husband’s side to peer down at the photo too.
Yes, that was perfect. He would cripple the Captain by using that humanity he possessed. The Captain and Erskine thought the Captain better than the Red Skull because the Captain had “heart.”
Mary sighed heavily then sat down on the nearby lab stool. She motioned for him to sit on the other and Ben did so stiffly.
Steve continued to stare at his friend and did not have the strength to reply to his name. The emotional turnover of having Peter in his arms then torn away was so draining that he barely had the strength to move.
“And both of you are sneaking around my workshop!! How did you get in without a code??” Tony demanded.
That was Peter.
Bucky would be the easiest. Using the suit’s stealth technology, Tony could catch the man before he plummeted to his death without anyone noticing.
Peter wound his arms around Wade’s neck and pressed his face into the side of Wade’s face. Again, he whispered, “I’m so sorry…”
They may have made grandiose statements about dying together but actually doing so broke her heart. She wanted to grow old with James and die sleeping comfortably in her bed…not like this.
Wade’s smile widened and lightly sang, “
Peter dragged Harry over to the couch and excitedly exclaimed, “Look! You’re on our wall!”
Steve looked incredulously at his husband and then snorted.
Peter perked up in his uncle’s hold and looked to the archer.
When she did, she jolted to a stop when her eyes fell on him. She dropped her bag with a sigh and crossed the room. She stood in front of him and demanded, “How did you deflect from the Americans? Does the Academy know? Do the Americans know of you?”
The last words they exchanged were harsh and that was how his son was going to remember him…
The world was spinning but he was grinning stupidly in the direction of his best friend.
“The ‘
“Oh thank God,” Tony moaned with delight. He snuggled against Steve and the lights dimmed. He asked with a yawn, “Why did I clear it? Is it National Pancake day or something?”
Coulson’s eyes spanned the room looking for more clues. He garnered the most from the couple. Potts and Stark were tense and they traded uneasy glances when they thought he wasn’t looking.
! You haven’t missed it ever since
“Think of it as a tip of my hat to you old guys,” Tony said with a grin and snapped his goggles back on. The lens magnified his hazel eyes to a comical size and Steve stifled a smile behind his hand. Tony bent over a piece of his helmet lifting a miniscule pick with a tip that glowed orange and sizzled as he worked on the more sensitive chips in the machine.
Hidden behind all of that was a bottle of vodka.
Internally, Natasha felt sick. Her soulmate had been erased. It was the worst thing that could happen to an agent of the Academy. His mannerisms made so much sense now. The Academy had taken away his mind, his will, his memories…everything.
Peter glanced over his shoulder to where Pops was leaning against the counter and smiling happily at Peter. Dad leaned into Pops’ side with an arm draped behind him on his waist. He met Dad’s eyes for a second and his father nodded him on encouragingly.
Natasha ignored the pain in her hand and ripped the gun out of James’s lax grip and pointed it at the monster that was his master. Using monster as a descriptor was perfect for the man, and not just for the horrors he put James through, but also because of his appearance. He had no face – no skin. His head was just a skull, a blood red skull that was grinning manically at them.
Because…Steve was gone.
Tony tightened his hold on his briefcase and said, “There is still one nonviolent way to subdue the symbiote.”
The General’s eyes narrowed and, for a second, Steve saw unease filter across his features. Then the General’s eyes flickered back to Tony’s retreating form and he smirked.
The blurry world shifted as he was raised into the air and then it all began to bounce as he was carried away.
“Ton –.”
“We don’t have to let the horror continue,” Tony stated. “I know you don’t trust us but we are willing to do anything you want to gain that trust!”
“There’s an exhibit on Steve at the Smithsonian. You’re in it. Maybe you should check it out in your two weeks of freedom?” She suggested.
different. Wade leaned into it sucking on Peter’s bottom lip and then moving to his top while their tongues met in the changeover. They both grinned and Peter whispered, “Let’s go before somebody sees us.”
“Tony, Thor is coming. Hold on!” Steve stepped closer to the television screen trying to find any sign of Tony in the disintegrating house. Steve hissed, “Answer me, baby!”
“Wanted to surprise you,” Tony replied, his eyes flickering between Steve and the other.
“Hey, J,” Tony whispered. “Play some of the music from my cool down tracks.”
He ran back to his room but was careful enough that the water didn't slosh as he moved.
“The sunshine state hasn’t banned Steve from crossing its borders, Jarvis,” Tony chipped, an annoyed edge to his voice as he did not understand why the AI was trying to stop Steve.
“…I do not want to diverge too much information,” Sneaky replied slowly. “My other name will…reveal things about the future. I fear if I reveal too much, the future might change and I like the way the future is right now so I don’t want to do that.”
“Master Parker has had all A’s in all subject since Elementary School. He has above average intelligence and excels in the sciences. He graduated from Midtown High last year, would you like to see his graduation photo?”
“You can’t be serious,” Steve retorted. Clint and Coulson?
Wade blocked out the voices before they started making out and returned his focus to the man in his arms. He gulped. It was now or never. He couldn't have had a more opportune moment...Wade clasped Peter's hips and nervously stared into his gaze as he whispered, "And I...I well I, yes, I do. I MEAN, I - I - I - Dios mio..." Wade took a steadying breath and stated as fast as he could,
Tony dropped his head and cursed, “I feel so useless.”
Steve leaned down and pressed his forehead to Tony’s. He asked, “What do you think the future holds now?”
But that moment ended, Steve picked up his head and murmured to Tony, “We’ll get you right as rain in no time.”
“I want to make things right with my dad but…I…I just don’t see how it’s possible because I'm still so upset with him,” Peter whispered softly into his shirt.
“But, the question is…will it work?” Peter murmured.
“I know…” Steve murmured, placing an arm over Tony's shoulders. “But there is such a thing as being
Steve’s brows knit together and he growled, “
“Did he leave a name??”
"If I keep trying, Peter will get annoyed with me and will hate me more," he replied smartly and, internally, it hurt to think his own son would hate him so. His thoughts strayed to his own father and their rocky relationship and Tony grew more depressed. He never wanted this. He had wanted to do better than Howard and now he was doing
“Breathe, Brock,” Bruce counciled and then breathed smoothly by example.
“So you’re going to let Bucky stay with be as long as we bunk up with a cover model? Sold. Bucky you good?” One of Bucky’s eyebrows rose, and he looked at Tony like he was crazy. Tony grinned and said, “That means yes!”
“Right away, Sir,” Jarvis replied and a ringing echoed over Jarvis’s speakers.
Gasping and panting in each other’s air. They were staring at each other like they had never really seen each other until that moment.
Steve ran his fingers through Tony’s hair and gently kissed his forehead.
“You are one of the founding members.”
Tony’s heart leapt into his throat. This was it. He instantly felt tongue-tied.
Mary’s lip trembled and she gasped, “This can’t possibly be real. I know it lived but-but it-he looks so-so
“Till the end of the line,” he monotoned, his eyes hazy.
Steve nodded in agreement and pressed his leg back into Tony’s with a smile.
The shower turned off and Steve practically tripped over his feet to get away.
“Is it really so bad that I know that?” Howard teased, obviously trying to defuse the tension between him and Steve.
He couldn’t go racing to the desert to find him.
sorry this happened…”
He was going to help him despite the consequences...
Tony flew for another hour, reviewing all the information SHIELD was posting about the situation. Apparently, Steve had gotten help from a local clergyman of the area and he was taken in for questioning but was invoking his right as a priest to keep what was said between him and Steve private.
Tony must be being operated on and was given drugs because he was out of it the entire time he was with Steve.
Stark read between the lines and his anger returned with unrestricted ferocity. Stark’s body was still bond by the weight of his suit but he screamed with all of his might, “HE’S A HUMAN BEING! He does not deserved to be locked away just because he’s a little different! I swear if you hurt him I will drag down your organization down until even its foundation is dust!”
in, do you?” Tony whispered, his voice came through their personal comm link.
As he thought on it, he realized months had passed since they’d move into the Tower. Peter’s third birthday would be in another two months. His boy was growing up.
He had hoped nothing credible would pop up. Instead, millions of search results came up, along with just as many photos. The first thing he saw were five photos at the top of the page, with the option to view more, the first and largest of them were a picture of his father and a younger Tony Stark standing together in tuxes.
Wade tried pulling away, apprehension suddenly building within him.
Whenever Tony bought his dates some fancy jewelry, many times they’d tell him they felt ‘touched’ by the gesture. It had all been empty conjecture but…at that moment, Tony felt the true meaning behind the metaphor. He felt his heart palpitate from the feeling.
It was an absolute relief when Tony finally passed out.
Steve instinctly reached out and grasped Peter. Peter rarely spoke of his time with Hydra but when he did he called them the “mean people.”
Years passed and Steve’s wishes and imaginings dwindled.
A gunshot sounded down that hall, clear and distinct. It was immediately followed by five more and then only silence reverberated down the hall.
But, on the other hand, was Tony. A man out of time whose future was now tied with theirs in more ways than one. Steve had been so obviously attracted to the man that, when Tony showed interest, Bucky practically shoved Steve in his direction because his best friend deserved to love and be loved in return at least once in his life.
Speaking out did not deter the men and women around them but encouraged them. They pressed in tighter and started yelling out more questions, growing more vulgar with every new declaration.
Steve reached out and grasped Bucky’s arm. He whispered, “And you feel horrible about it. You aren’t the monster you think you are, Buck. A monster wouldn’t care about those lives he took, you do.”
He grabbed her arm and hissed, “We need to get out of here!”
“J, get a fresh pot brewing for me in the kitchen,” Tony asked. He could have used the coffee machine in the lab but he wanted to see how Steve was doing.
Peter kissed him again, his eyes remaining open in tiny slits as he watched Wade and Wade did the same, mesmerized by the look in his lover’s eyes.
“Ok, mom, jeez Steve, you’re worse than a mother hen…” Tony retorted with a laugh.
Tony crossed his arms over his chest and murmured, “That was before…” Before Tony confessed his true feelings and Steve did the same. It was before what they shared became personal and no longer fake…Before Tony wished for some privacy with Steve instead of public exposure…
Fury cursed colorfully and then grumbled, “Pass the phone back to Coulson, Summers.”
His heart beat was slow but it was
“As well as one can be still recovering from several stab wounds…” Peter retorted dryly. He looked to Tony and teased, “Next year, I think we’ll forgo the alien abduction for my birthday, sound good?”
“All of them.”
When Steve felt they were far enough away, he asked, “Well?
Steve inhaled sharply and watched with abated breath as he tapped at his phone and brought it to his ear.
“There is no good or evil, only weak minded men.” there was pure deviousness in Natasha’s voice. “Clint’s the loser so he gets to make breakfast.”
“Here is your brief on the assignment from director Fury.” He said and held it out to Tony. Tony took it and casually opened it.  Steve was beginning to think Tony did everything casually.  He watched as Tony skimmed over the first few lines.  Suddenly he stopped and looked up.
“It’s affecting team dynamics and I would prefer to survive our next fight. That makes it my business.  Did something happen between the two of you.”  The way she said 'happen' made it very clear what she was implying.
“Captain Rogers is showing elevated heart rate as well as other signs of distress.”
Tony huffed out a breath. “That’s always going to be a tall order Cap. Most would say you’ve done more than your fair share of time.”
“That’s not why I’m here.”  Steve sat down on an empty stool and pulled out the little notebook Tony had given him. “I’m here because you needed more coffee and I need to figure out what the hell a hipster is.”
Steve wandered out to the balcony and watched as the sun set over the city. He could hear laughter and Tony’s loud protests of cheating in the background. Steve swirled his beer, still the first one of the night it had long ago grown warm. Thor walked out to join him.
“Oh. Um, Hi.” Steve froze and turned around. His face was flushed and Tony knew it wasn’t from the exercise. He stepped away from the bag and wrung his hands. “Look Tony, I’m sorry… I really… I know...” Steve was stumbling over and mincing his words. He had a whole lot he didn’t know how to say.
“Hmmm.” Tony said not concerned.  After the events in New York meetings with Fury had become common place.
In the back of his head he knew this was his first charity gala since the incident since he missed his soul day, and the first time he had drank since then, and he was sure Pepper was aware of it too with how closely she was watching him.  He was sure she was trying to be subtle but he noticed all the same.  At his fifth,
Yeah, Ca—Steve?
“Friends, Rogers?”
“Yeah.” Tony’s thumb rubbed circles on the back of his hand.  He gave Steve his full attention. Steve had spent the week choosing how he was going to word what he was about to say.
She rolled her eyes. “Barton killed someone on our most recent recon mission so I get to fill out paperwork about it.” She said.
Step one had been easy.  As they ate Thai food and Tony laughed as Steve’s still developing ability to use chopsticks Tony laid out the other four. Steve felt as though his stomach was trying to tie every grain of rice he had eaten into its own knot, but at the end of the meal when Tony asked him when if he was ready he nodded and was a little surprised that it felt true.
Steve declared an official team training session necessary, which was fine, theoretically.  What was not fine was that he scheduled it for six in the morning.  Tony had been willing to forgive him for that even, until Steve had mentioned that it was going to be all hand to hand combat. No suits, no weapons allowed.
Jarvis had dimmed the lights during the encounter. Tony watched Steve trace the wrinkles on his shirt for a while.  Steve’s eyelids began to hover half closed.  Each time he blinked his eyelashes rested against his cheek a little longer. They stayed closed for a little while before Steve jolted himself awake.
Steve slipped his jacket off and then unsnapped the cuff around his mark. He was starting to get a tan line which made the ink stand out all the more. The marks that once filled him with hope now made him feel nauseous, he told himself he covered it so that he didn't have to look at it. That it would help him forget, but it had weighed on his mind every second of his trip.  He knew that why he really wore it was he didn't want everyone to know that he was alone, incomplete, and always would be.
The whole essence of missing things is that they are gone… Steve thought but he smiled and nodded anyway.
Tony walked in to the living room after pulling an all-nighter in the lab.  He hadn’t meant to stay up all night, but he owed Stark Industries R&D a new concept on an electric car.  Normally such a simple design would have only taken an hour or two, but Tony had been too busy acting like an idiot high schooler, pining and daydreaming, to get anything useful done.  Steve was engrossed in a game of Risk with Natasha and Clint and seemed to be giving serious contemplation to how to best take Canada.  All other eyes in the room seemed to be on him.  He rolled his eyes.  He should just give up on keeping secrets in his life between the paparazzi and living with spies it was a lost cause.   Tony grabbed coffee and retreated to his room to change clothes.
“I’m sorry, I went off today.” Steve poked a stray pickle around with a fry. “I know I’m pretty rotten at the whole adjusting thing.”
Natasha looked up from what she was reading and quirked an eyebrow at him.  Steve smiled sheepishly.
“Natasha, take Bruce through the basics. Clint, try not to kill Stark.”  Steve stretched and twisted from side to side.  Tony spent a moment contemplating the impossibility of Steve’s waste line.
“Why couldn’t I have just died?” he mumbled.
“No worse than normal.”  She said.  “I only had to threaten to break Rumlow’s nose this time.”
Clint, despite threats, did not burn the bacon.  Steve was clearing the dishes when a voice he didn’t recognize spoke up from the door.
Bruce showed up a few minutes later and tried not to look too put upon when Thor made his request.  They barely managed to all squeeze into the frame.  Thor snapped the photo and they all leaned in to observe.
Steve began to calm down.  He separated himself from Tony and sat against the headboard of the bed arms wrapped around his knees head tipped back so that he was looking at the ceiling.
Tony showed him to his room last.
Steve led Tony over to the couch. And leaned against him.
“Yeah, floor, everyone has a floor.” Tony said as if it was the most normal thing in the world. The elevator accelerated upwards without prompting and numbers flew by on the control panel. It stopped at floor 60 “My labs on 59 if you ever need to find me.” Tony said. He ushered Steve out of the elevator.
Steve lowered his lips to a point just above the collar of Tony’s shirt and placed his lips there.  He hesitated for a moment before opening his lips and sucking.  Tony moaned into Steve’s hair.  He was going to have one hell of a mark tomorrow.
“No but it’d be funny.  Nothing like a good prank.”They bumped shoulders as they walked.  The first time it was an accident but Tony then jokingly nudged Steve with his elbow.  Steve nudged Tony back and Tony pretended to stumble.  Steve looked concerned for a second before he realized that Tony was joking.
“Tony?” Steve sounded really worried.
“Ack.” Tony screamed. “That’s a lot sexier when Natasha does it.”
The more Tony thought about what had happened in the elevator the more it made sense.  He and Steve had really hit it off in recent weeks in their own weird way.  If they were any two other people they would have gotten together by now; but Steve was from the forties and Tony was an emotionally constipated wreck who had failed to commit to a relationship, or anything really, till the age of thirty eight.  Tony wanted a drink but he knew that with the way the sensations of the too short kiss were burning his lips he would go do something stupid and well and truly fuck something up.
“A good fight captain.” Thor said helping him up again.
“Combat training room two, sir.”  Tony tucked the letter into his back pocket and headed to the elevators.
“But she’ll beat me.” Clint whined.
Steve looked up at that comment and Thor lifted him at the waist and threw him to the ground.
“Bend your knees more.” Steve said.  Then he swung at Tony’s shoulder. “Freeze.” He said as soon as Tony moved to block. “Look at your body. You’re flinching away you want to meet it not run from it.” He set back up and motioned for Tony to do the same.  “Again.”
Steve knew it must be something serious when Nick fury came to personally invite him on a mission.  Steve grabbed his things and boarded the transport provided for him. In the back of his mind, a little voice nagged that today was his soul day, but he shut it down.  Duty came first he told himself.  He read the mission file an watched the security video, he felt more confident, this was more familiar, this was something he could do, this was something he felt comfortable in unlike so much of the future.
“Go right ahead.” Natasha said. “Stark is just bitter because I already put him to shame once tonight.”
“Home of fire and brimstone, institutionalized guilt and pray away the gay. Unfortunately common.” Tony said scrunching up his face.
Steve was again at the punching bag stringing together hit after hit.  Tony took a moment to sip at his steaming drink and admire the view.  Steve was wearing a tank top that left every twitch of his shoulder muscles visible.
