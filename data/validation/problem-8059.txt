As promised here is the moment when they finally mate. They're growing closer and Steve is finally starting to feel loved. Poor thing has suffered enough as it is. Anyway, thank you so much for being patient with me and for being so supportive. I love you all!
For a moment Peter believes Flash will call him a name or maybe hit him. But instead he walks by, and purposely bumps into Peter.
“I should’ve done something!” Peter snaps and shrugs his uncle off. “He’s dead! He’s dead and it’s all my fault! If I would’ve just done something right...he’d...he’d be here. I screwed up.”
What he didn’t know was that the man leading the session would be an alpha.
“How is she?” Tony asks when he notices how content Morgan is in Steve’s arms. “Not fussy anymore?”
He was still stubborn as hell. He refuses to go to the doctor when his stomach continues to give him issues. Tony grows frustrated; Steve doesn’t blame him. It’s not until the stomach problem goes away and Steve begins to feel like himself does Tony drop it.
“Okay,” Tony nods. “But what do you want right now?”
“Hey, dad?” Peter’s voice cuts through Tony’s thoughts. “It’s almost 6.”
He wants to cry all over again, but he holds back, not wanting to do it in front of her.
It’s just another excuse he likes to tell himself whenever Steve starts hinting. First, Steve suggested they move out of the city and find a little place out in the country. Tony had brushed it off. He loved the city. It was home.
“Thanks,” he eventually says and leans his head back against the wall. “This sucks. And it’s only what, day two?”
“I just want to help you and...your kid. You don’t deserve to go back to him or be left on the streets. But you have to tell me more so I know how I can help. You said we met. How?”
His papa would still be alive if he had done something right.
Steve brings Morgan close and places a kiss to her forehead. He allows his lips to linger against her soft skin, almost as if he’s afraid he’d never get a chance to kiss her again. His body is wracked with sobs again, the sound heartbreaking to hear.
“I got it,” Steve brings Morgan closer, turning away when Tony gets too close. “Dammit, Tony I got it!”
Steve stares up at him, his blue eyes full of confusion. Tony wonders if the poor guy has ever had a positive human interaction in his life.
Steve forces himself not to think about the possibility of marriage. He had other things to occupy his already noisy mind. Peter was of course one of them. His son was getting bigger and smarter every day, never failing to captivate Steve with all of the new changes.
Steve follows Tony out of the room and down the hall toward the large master bedroom. It’s been too long since he’s stepped foot in here. Everything was still the same. The only difference was the bassinet set up beside Tony’s bed.
I know it wasn’t Pierce who ruined the party, but it’s still bad. Don’t worry I have plans for that guy 😉
“When I was kid I would watch you on TV. I always told papa that he didn’t have to go on missions anymore. I said you could take care of the world and let him be with me instead. I didn’t know who you really were then.”
“I don’t blame him. I’m gonna check on the other kiddos. Make sure they’re still dreaming.”
Steve’s heart flutters and the sound of his second name. His children were getting bigger and bigger everyday, and pretty soon they might consider themselves to be too old to be calling him ‘mama’ or ‘mommy’. They may even get embarrassed over all the hugs and kisses he loves to give them. Just thinking about them growing up has Steve growing sad. He’d cherish every second with them.
Peter keeps his gaze on Tony’s face, listening to the familiar voice. He only whimpers when Tony makes the mistake of pulling the bottle away too soon.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, you eat,” Natasha tells him and she adjusts Morgan in her arms. “I got it, Steve.”
“Do you? Or did you claim me because it benefited you? I’m sure you being spotted with a pregnant and unbonded omega wouldn’t look good for your image.”
“Yeah. Let’s go with that.”
“I know.” Pepper rubs his shoulder again before turning and walking away to mingle with more of the guests.
“Okay…” Steve says unsurly. “I’m here if you need anything.”
“He jumped in front of me.” Happy narrows his eyes.
She slams her bedroom door hard behind her, not caring if it gets her in trouble. At least then she would be getting some form of attention.
“Yeah. I guess things are different now, huh?”
“I had to do it. My weapons were in the wrong hands. It was easier to just destroy everything.”
Harley nods again.
“No,” Tony shakes his head. “I’ll do it. And if anything happens JARVIS can alert security. Um I have to deal with that now so... can we reschedule everything later?”
“Then go do that.”
Steve steps further into the room and lowers himself down in the chair beside Tony’s bed. He reaches out for Tony’s hand and takes it in his own. Tony doesn’t stir when Steve soothingly rubs Tony’s bruised knuckles with his thumb.
His papa’s special day was everything but special. It had its sad moments, but there had been good ones. It wasn’t supposed to be a perfect party, it never could be without his papa, but Peter wanted it to be happy.
“Jesus,” Tony pulls his hands off Steve and moves away.
“Nick’s gonna kill me.”
Steve chuckles and shakes his head. “You’re not Spider-Man yet
Defeated, Tony has no choice but to follow the command. Usually omega’s weren’t the ones to give orders, but this was a new world and omega’s were free to make their own choices. Steve had been deprived of that freedom for so long, and now he was gaining it. He called the shots now.
“I don’t want to think about that day.”
“Right on time for what?” Steve questions, a look of confusion forming over his face. It’s gone in an instant at the sight of his son. “Hey, Petey.” He smiles brightly for a moment, then his face shifts again, this time a look of concern crossing his features. “Is everything okay?”
Steve takes Morgan to the nursery to put her down for her nap and Tony heads in the direction of their bedroom. He paces the floor, an internal battle going on inside him. He needs to talk to Steve, but he’s afraid. Honestly, he’s not sure what he’s even afraid of. Was he afraid that he would upset his husband? Was he afraid that Steve would actually come clean and confess that in fact he wasn’t okay and that he needed help? Tony wasn’t sure.
“I’m sure you’ll still check in.”
“Something like that,” Peter replies nervously. He shifts from foot to foot, his fingers fiddling with the strings of his hoodie.
Natasha nods and digs into the cold dessert. “It still helps.”
He’s just about ready to give up and actually go to school, but then a flashy car pulls up to the front of the building. Peter’s heart beats rapidly, pounding so hard he’s sure it’s going to burst right out of his chest. His palms have grown sweaty and he quickly takes them out of his pockets to wipe them along the front of his jeans.
“You lied to us, went behind our backs, snuck out,” Sam counts each reason on his fingers. “Am I missing anything?”
Steve shuts his eyes when his cheek is softly caressed. Alpha leans in closer now, the smell of the alcohol on his breath makes Steve’s stomach churn. Every fiber of his being is screaming at him to pull away, but he knows if he were to act on that urge, that he would be punished.
Peter is up before the sun. He had never been this way before-if he could sleep in late than he would-but ever since his papa had started allowing him on his morning runs, Peter’s grown accustomed to the early schedule.
“Sir-”
She smiles. “It’s okay.”
“I have an idea,” Tony starts. The reaction he receives is one he’s seen countless times before. It was a well known fact that a lot of his ideas were shitty. Happy and Pepper have both been witnesses and sometimes victims to them.
“I know. I’m sorry, Pete.”
And God does he wish he was.
“It’s okay. The good thing is your son is healthy. Now I want you to go home and bond with your sons. If you need me for anything please don’t hesitate to call me.”
“It’s not your fault,” Sam says, fighting back his own tears. He’s lost count of how many times Bucky has blamed himself for their loss. It just wasn’t their time to be parents and he assured him that they’d get that chance. He was still convinced that they would.
“Hey,” Steve says soothingly and finds a place on the floor. “It’s okay. Maybe you need a break.”
Steve sighs loudly. “I don't know. Something shifted between them.”
“Then why do I have a feeling you want to add something?”
Peter smiles. “These are awesome. But maybe I can make a few suggestions?”
“Really.”
Peter frowns. “Why?”
Steve doesn’t announce his pregnancy right away. His plan...okay, maybe he doesn’t have a plan, but if he did, it would be to wait to say anything. He has no clue how he’s supposed to break the news to his teammates. Getting the words out to Tony had already been a bust.
The second Peter finds Ned in the hall, his friend is glancing at his sweatshirt, then gasping and looking up at him with wide eyes. It takes Peter a second to realize why his friend was getting so excited. Peter rolls his eyes and turns to get into his locker.
It’s Tony who moans this time. He grinds against Steve’s hand, chasing after more of the friction. Steve’s hand keeps going, playing with the belt Tony regrets wearing, and unbuckling it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I do.”
“Thank you.”
He doesn’t know if he can do it again, and he hates himself for even considering it. Saving his pups was his biggest goal. His attempts had failed. All but one.
“Shh.” Tony shushes him with a kiss. They break apart. “You deserve it. You went out of your way to do something nice for me...of course I fucked it up but…”
Finding the time to sit down and talk with his mate wasn’t an easy task. Their youngest pup was constantly begging for their attention, throwing tantrums when he didn’t get his way. Harley could still be a handful, and it was obvious Peter was learning by his brother’s example.
At the sound is his name, Tony’s eyes shoot open and he glances over his shoulder, expecting to find his husband still curled up around him. But Steve is sitting up, a pained expression on his face and arms wrapped around his middle.
They eat in silence, the uncomfortable feeling only growing more intense with each passing second. Steve’s starving, but he holds off, taking small unsure bites. Alpha watches him closely.
Tony is quick to pick up the hints Steve was leaving for him. The pink hue that was decorating Steve’s face was a giveaway, but it was the change in his scent that Tony picked up first.
The pain is gone, almost like it had never been there in the first place. All Steve can focus on is his son.
“Yep! I told you it’d be a long labor. Might as well come prepared. You packed my favorite snacks too right?” Tony peeks into the bag, smiling when he pulls out a ziplock bag with blueberries. “Now I’m wanting chocolate. No chips. No maybe salsa.”
“You never gave me that distraction I wanted,” Bucky murmurs against Sam’s lips. He slides his tongue along Sam’s bottom lip, begging for access.
“What was I supposed to do, Pep! He was cold and alone and-and I couldn’t just leave him. He also said he knew me and now there’s a baby involved.”
This is the chapter where Tony finds out! 😬
Peter smiles brightly. “Come on. I’ll take you upstairs.”
“And what about Iron Man? You giving up on that, too?” Steve asks.
“This is your room,” Steve points out and he sends Tony a confused look. “I can’t take this away from you.”
“I’ll explain everything. But first…I think your son needs to see you.”
But now the press needed to learn about Tony’s new mate and their four pups. That’s where things became difficult.
“I know.”
That had been three years ago and Steve could proudly say that it was one of the best decisions he’s ever made. Landing the Valkyrie in the middle of the ocean seemed good at the time...he realizes now that that wasn’t his greatest moment. But getting together with Tony was hands down his best decision.
But they do it for Peter. It had been his idea to throw a party in the first place. At first they had been uncertain if Peter would even want to do anything. But Peter’s love for Steve outweighed the heavy loss, and instead of letting his mood get dampened, he pushed on and was willing to bring everyone’s spirits up.
The changes had been subtle at first. No one would notice them if they weren’t looking. But Steve was looking. He was always waiting for the signs to show up, even after Tony would tell him it was probably too soon to tell. You could say it turned into a bit of an obsession. Most days he found it difficult to focus on the team and his duties as Captain. All he could think about was Tony and their future baby.
A knock on the bathroom door startles him and Peter nearly falls over.
“Then what’s going on with you?” Steve reaches across the counter for Tony’s hand. “Talk to me, Tony. You’re different.”
Steve whimpers and tugs a little harder. Tony frowns and softly runs a hand over the inside of Steve’s thigh.
Steve sniffs and pulls back so that their eyes can meet. “I’m sorry. I overreacted and-”
“It’s okay,” Tony assures, his soft voice snapping Steve’s open. Tony smiles warmly at him, taking his hand and removing it from his chest.
“Dad?” Morgan decides to speak up. She pauses for a moment, waiting for one of her brothers to interrupt. When they don’t, she continues. “My project isn’t too complicated. I thought we could create a-”
“Pete,” comes the sound of his papa’s voice from the other side of the door. Another knock follows. “Come on, bud, let me in. I just want to talk.”
“I mean I get it. It took us what, a year to finally get pregnant?”
Peter was already dressed in his costume and this time didn’t end up with a scribbled mess on his face. Tony had stepped in this time to help with the fake goatee and adjust the tie around his son’s neck.
Tony scoffs. “Yeah. No kidding.”
Tony allows Steve to lead him toward their bedroom. He’s reminded of their daughter that needed to be picked up, but Natasha had assured them to take as long as they wanted. She had meant their lunch date but Tony wasn’t about to pass up this opportunity. There was no telling when he’d get Steve like this again.
“Yeah, well, I’m busy. I need to...I have to go.” Tony jumps up from his seat and quickly grabs his belongings.
Another finger is added, increasing the burn. Tony curses and squeezes his eyes shut. His fingers find purchase in the sheets beneath him, gripping them tightly until his knuckles are turning white. Steve continues to stroke him with one hand and finger him with the other. The mixture of pain and pleasure is confusing. A part of Tony likes it.
Tony is ready to protest, but he decides against it, not wanting to upset his husband anymore. He gets up and leaves the room, slowly pulling the door closed. He pauses before it shuts completely, his ears filling with soft sniffles. He peers through the crack of the door, his heart breaking at the sight of Steve crying.
“Hey, you okay?” Ned asks and Peter wants to kick himself for ruining his friend's story. He enjoyed listening to Ned talk about his new Lego sets or the weird movies he found on Netflix. He didn’t want to rain on his parade all because he couldn’t keep himself in check.
“Pete, that’s enough,” Sam says calmly.
“I got him, honey,” Tony assures when he catches Steve’s eyes drooping again.
“I’m down. I swear I love our son but sometimes I just want you alone,” Tony says.
“It’s not.”
Now he’s regretting coming so early. He feels awkward lingering around the hallway as he waits for the room currently filled with other omegas to clear out. Apparently Sam taught multiple sessions, and Steve had just caught the end of one.
The pups are in bed no later than eight. It’s a struggle to get them tucked in, especially when it came to Harley and Peter. Harley refused to sleep, whining about how unfair it was. Tony has to take over and read him another story until Harley falls asleep. Peter only wants Steve when it comes to...well, anything. He was close with Tony, but it was Steve he wanted ninety nine percent of the time.
Peter replies with a whimper. Brown, glistening eyes open to meet those of his father’s. Tony smiles down at his son, hoping he’d get one in return. Peter loved to smile at Steve whenever they were around each other. It was one of Tony’s favorite things to witness.
It makes Tony’s blood boil. Steve was supposed to belong to him. They were supposed to be happy.
“Yeah? So when you say anything…”
Steve shakes his head. Tony sighs.
“What?”
He finds the strength to open his eyes and glance down, mesmerized by the sight of Steve’s bobbing head. Tony moans, the sound snapping Steve’s eyes up in his direction. Just the look in his husband’s eyes brings Tony closer to his release.
Peter doesn’t budge, turning his face when Steve offers him his nipple. Steve switches positions, wondering if Peter would prefer the other side. The reaction is the same.
“I need to go. Have Happy get the jet ready.”
Poor baby 😭 Unfortunately it’s going to hurt for a while. But at least Peter still has the rest of his family to help him.
“I know. I thought it was adorable.” Steve smiles.
“He’s not, Uncle Bucky! I don’t know why you don’t like him. Yeah he’s made mistakes, but haven’t we all? You’re not innocent.”
“That looked pretty bad.” Tony frowns and comes over to join his mate on the bed. “Don’t tell me it gets worse.”
And they were going to make amazing big brothers.
“Guess someone is protective,” Tony comments.
It’s Sam who comforts him when Bucky releases a sob. He pulls him into his arms, whispering something Peter can’t quite hear from where he’s standing. Peter eventually turns away, his gaze straight ahead on the wooden casket and American flag spread out neatly over the top. He can’t look for long and he turns away.
The cycle continues and Steve is once again forced out of bed to care for his son. He doesn’t rush toward the nursery anymore; his steps are slow and unhurried. He knows how this next part works, but he can’t bring himself to go any faster. He just wants to sleep.
Tony nods and presses a kiss to Steve’s head. “Get some sleep, honey. I can stay up with him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve might not have his mother to be there to comfort him or Bucky to rush in and save him from the bullies, but he had Tony and that was more than he could ever need. He had his mate, his alpha.
At the sound of his name, Tony is snapping himself out of it and glancing up, finding Steve staring at him, that confused look back on his face. How many times did he say his name?
Happy is the one who cups her head and he huffs out a small laugh. He peers up at Steve. “She’s almost here. Come on, just a little more.”
“Tony,” Steve says, a little too quickly.
“Why hello to you, too.”
James does the same. “Like that?”
“I’m telling her right now that it’s your fault,” Tony chuckles and types out a reply to Pepper.
“I will if you keep doing that. You know how much I love this part. I mean, the sex was great, not gonna lie,” Tony says.
The three of them make their way back to the elevator and ride it up in silence. Pepper gets off on one floor, making sure to silently threaten Tony before leaving the car.
They were all dealing with their own shit, some maybe dealing with worse. Peter didn’t want to say that his issues were harder than anyone else’s. There was always someone who had it harder.
“We can talk for hours about...everything! There’s so much I want to know. How did you guys meet? How did you become an Avenger? Are you still Iron Man? Do you really like cheeseburgers?”
“I’m so tired,” Steve mumbles and scrubs a hand over his face.
Peter’s head whips in Steve’s direction at that last part. Steve chuckles.
“Morning,” Peter mumbles out a reply and sits down at the table where his plate of scrambled eggs and toast are waiting for him. Peter picks up at his fork to move the eggs around.
Tony sighs and scrubs a hand over his face. How could he have been so stupid? Of course it would all be a lie. He didn’t know anything about Steve or how they even met. Steve didn’t give him any details and Tony had no recollection of them meeting. None of it made sense.
“I’ll go get checked out,” Steve finishes and moves around the counter to kiss Tony softly on the lips. “I’m okay,” he assures once they break apart. “You know how this part is.”
“Hurry up.” The alpha orders and pulls out his gun, aiming it for the beta’s head. “Don’t make me blow your brains out. The boss wants this quick.”
“Uneventful,” Tony replies and he slips the photos back into the envelope. “You still up for breakfast?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Quit bickering, lovebirds,” Natasha teases and makes herself comfortable in the chair next to Steve. She lays one hand over the small bump. “How’s little Natasha doing?”
“Then perhaps moving away is the best option, sir.”
Steve nods. “Thanks, Sam. You’re a good friend.”
“Boo!” Comes a familiar voice behind him and Steve turns in his chair, smiling at the sight of his son. Peter is dressed in his Captain America helmet and in his hands is a small, plastic replica of the famous shield.
“Go back to sleep. I got her. Wait-did she eat at all?” Tony asks, sighing when Steve shakes his head. “It’s okay. Maybe you should try pumping in the morning. At least that way I can give her a bottle when you’re resting.”
“It’s just this quick meeting tomorrow-”
“Okay. I’ll start if it makes you uncomfortable. I’m Tony.” Tony holds out his hand. He feels awkward leaving it in the air for too long and pulls back. “Listen, I just thought since you’re in my car that maybe I could get your name.”
They’re such a cute family. Maybe Tony should propose 🤔
Peter’s phone dings, and with furrowed brows he takes it out of his back pocket.
“And your pups? Did they deserve it too?”
The day Steve comes home, Tony’s world lights up again. The darkness was gone and in its place, a vibrant, warm light appeared. The missing piece was finally put in place, completing the picture that had been broken for months.
“Aw.” Natasha smiles. “That’s cute. I was hoping you would’ve had a girl but maybe next time.”
“I’ll live,” Peter sighs and sags in his seat. He glances down at the lunch, the food still unappealing and he pushes it away. “Do you want to come over?” He asks, turning toward his friend. “I need to tell you something.”
“I thought that was for our wedding night?”
“Guess Jarvis wanted you to be reminded of home,” Tony chuckles as he places two large slices on a plate for Steve and then for himself. They stay seated on the sofa; it’s more comfortable this way.
Bruce moves on to look over the youngest pup, quietly shushing Peter when he begins to fuss. “Shh, I know, little guy. This isn’t fun.”
“Thanks, Buck.” Steve accepts the gift, studying the stuffed animal for a moment before gently placing it down in his lap.
“We won’t touch it right now if you don’t want to,” Natasha says softly.
Tony hums and cups Steve's face. “I love you, too. Even if you are in better shape than me. But I guess that’s nothing new.”
Steve rips the page from his book and neatly folds the piece of paper, and puts it securely in his belt.
“Shut up,” Peter mumbles and makes his way over to his desk, plopping down onto the chair. He watches as Flash eyes the bed. “Just sit down.”
“And how is that your problem? Take him to a shelter or something!”
Steve chuckles softly and leans in to close the bit of space between them. Tony kisses back, smiling against Steve’s lips when he feels his husband physically relax. Then the previous tension returns and Steve is pulling away.
“Tony, you can’t protect me forever.”
It grows silent between them. Tony is contemplating taking Bruce’s advice and talking to Steve, but he’s hesitant. He doesn’t want to set him off.
“Our space, sweetheart.” Tony corrects. “And I don’t care. Have you seen my lab? It’s not that great at the moment.”
Tony keeps his hand on him, letting him know he’s still there. He trails his hand down the omega’s chest, getting lower and lower to where he really wants to touch.
“Oh.” Steve takes the shirt handed to him and frowns down at it. “I didn’t know you still…”
“A kiss?”
Bruce is the one who leads Tony over to the sofas and does his best to make sure he’s comfortable. Tony can’t help but feel like their roles should be switched. He was the one who abandoned everyone. The least he could do now that he’s returned was make sure they were okay. Financially he supported them, but he wonders if they even knew that.
“Nah,” Sam shakes his head. “It’s a girl.”
“I can’t say I’m not disappointed,” Alpha says. “You still have issues with complying. You’re lucky you have that pup in your belly or I’d be forced to issue another training session.”
“Yeah. The baby is fine and Steve is…” Bruce sighs.
“I’m fine. Keep going,” Tony encourages.
Oh wait...he can.
“Pepper?”
“Bind him!” Brock calls out an order.
The door opens and all eyes fall on the red-haired alpha. She keeps her distance to avoid frightening the small pups.
He’s not the only one. Steve is snuggled up against the large pillow he’s been sleeping with for the past few months. Tony is careful not to wake him when he gently rubs small circles over Steve’s belly.
Harley has decided that he wanted to be a part of this conversation and he steps toward the new alpha, sniffing him and trying to decide if he was a threat. James does the same, and much to the relief of his parents, he doesn’t growl at the stranger.
He was extremely good looking. Tony didn’t know such a person could even exist until he met Steve Rogers. Steve’s eyes were Tony’s favorite feature. Sure his Adonis body didn’t go ignored, but his eyes were addicting. It was easy for Tony to get lost in them.
“I love you,” Tony takes another shot at saying those three words.
“You guys couldn’t behave for like ten minutes?” Peter raises a questioning brow at his parents. When both remain silent, he rolls his eyes and makes his way toward the stairs, only to stop when he’s called back to the dining room.
“It was nothing. He’s actually not a bad guy.”
“It’s not a big deal. I know you’re trying to get home. How are things by the way?” Sam asks.
With the party winding down, Tony expects the tension between him and the Avengers to dissipate. But he’s never been so wrong. It’s not Natasha or Sam or even Bucky who decide to pick a fight with him; Clint decides he wasn’t done asking questions.
“Miss Potts,” the older man greets with a smile and he steps into the room. The other man with an arrow follows, piercing blue eyes scanning the area. “I’m Agent Coulson and this is Agent Barton and-” he waves a hand in Natalie’s direction. “-you’ve met Agent Romanoff.”
“Tony, if you truly believed that, then you wouldn’t be here telling me how worried you are about him being alone with Morgan.”
“How many times?” Tony asks and Steve peers up at him with glistening eyes. “It’s okay. We don’t have to talk about it.”
“I love you so much. I’m going to get better, I promise.”
Anyway, he loved Halloween. The dressing up, the parties, the delicious goodies. All of it was what made the holiday so exciting.
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispers.
Steve decides to take the plunge and go first.
“Why are you up?” Peter asks, plopping down beside her and reaching for the remote. He begins skimming through the channels. “Oh yeah. That thing with dad.”
“Not today. We have a science project to do. Come on.”
It’s difficult to carry most of his weight, but she tries, not ready to give up. It wasn’t her style to forfeit, especially when the lives of her friends were on the line. Natasha grits her teeth and pushes forward, holding onto Steve as hard as she can.
“I think we’ll be okay,” Steve assures. “You want to hold him? He’s clean now.”
“Yeah? Who do you want him to be?”
“It is simple,” Tony defends and steps further into the room to grab the bear. He turns around and holds it out for Steve. “His name is Teddy. Yes it’s not original but he’s adorable so whatever. And he has something for you.”
“Uncle Bucky’s cat.”
Steve can’t help but wince. It was going to take some getting used to.
“Honey?” Tony pulls himself to his feet and rushes over to console his husband. “Steve, darling, what’s wrong. Why are you crying?”
Steve sighs again. “Yeah, you’re right. But what about Harley? He needs a part to play.”
Steve, being the polite one that he is, smiles and slips the vial back into the bag. “Thank you, Thor. I’ll um...keep it for a rainy day.”
“I’m only suggesting that you promote him. Make him head of security. You know he’s the perfect person for it,” Pepper says.
“I get it. I’ll watch her. It’s okay.”
“I’m okay now. I need to think about something else.”
Tony does the same and raises his hands up. “It’s me. It’s just me.”
Maybe he just needed more time. Maybe he needed a confirmation. He needed proof that Steve was being honest.
Tony rereads over the document again, needing to make sure that his mind wasn’t playing an awful trick on him. The results are the same. He was having a baby.
There was a large bed-maybe it was too big now that Steve thought about it- a dresser, nightstand and a connected bathroom. A couple of paintings decorated the walls, but other than that the room was bare.
“It’s a lot.”
Steve was dead.
“It’s not just about our powers that make us special. You have a good heart, Pete, and that’s what makes you enough. You’ll never be a perfect hero, but a good man.”
“Then I had another boy. He kind of resembled me a little bit, or at least the parts of him I could see. His name was Harley. He-he wasn’t the one either.”
Tony smiles. “I love you, too.”
Bucky huffs out a small laugh, then his smile is faltering. “Steve won’t be there to see it.”
“Wait, Mr. Stark!” Peter calls after and rushes to keep up, only to be held back by security. “My name is Peter Rogers and-”
“I’m no hero. And I suck at affection.”
Peter lunges at her first, fists raised. But his aunt is faster and she dodges the attack, blocking each punch he issues. Peter tries to be sneaky and surprise his aunt with the same trick he used on his papa, but he’s not quick enough and his aunt has him flipped and on his back in seconds.
“That’s it! Fuck!” Tony cries and buries his face deeper into Steve’s chest. “Shit, this hurts. This really fucking hurts.”
Steve smiles and waves him off. “I appreciate it, Dr. Banner. On the bright side, you won’t have to do it for long.”
For now, someone else would have to take the shield. Steve had always envisioned Sam taking his place until Peter was ready to lead the team. He hadn’t had a chance to sit down with his teammates and discuss what would happen once he stepped down. They knew that day was coming; Steve made it clear that he wanted to be a father first.
Then it clicks. This was Morgan's time with Steve. Sure Tony had taken over feedings every now and then but it wasn’t the same when Steve would feed her. It was their bonding time.
“I know it’s hard but one day it won’t be. I still miss my mom too.”
The first time Tony heard the voicemails, Tony had to shut them off and never listen to them again. He had done that a couple of times actually. Hearing Steve’s voice ached. It felt like his heart was being squeezed tightly until it was close to bursting.
Steve shakes his head and leans down to kiss Tony again. Tony quickly takes control of the kiss, pulling Steve closer and flipping them over until Steve is on his back and he’s hovering over him. Dodger barks again, and Tony groans.
Tony was known for staying up for hours and avoiding sleep. Steve has scolded him more times than he can count. So one night when Tony is found passed out on the sofa in the communal living room during movie night, it doesn’t go unnoticed by Steve or their teammates. Tony was quick to defend himself, blaming his lack of caffeine as the issue. But Steve didn’t buy it.
“Dad, stop!” Peter begs, his face growing red. “Why are you even home?”
Steve is aware of the agonizing screams he’s producing, but he can’t bring himself to stop. Bucky is doing everything he can to comfort him, but his attempts aren’t working anymore.
“Bruce is here, too,” Pepper says, trying to change the subject.
“Hush! You want this!” Pierce continues to roughly thrust inside the crying omega. He looks over his shoulder to meet the other alpha’s eyes. “Don’t be fooled. He enjoys this. Did he fight with you too?”
The morning sickness is worse and the fatigue isn’t any better, but Steve still manages to wear a smile on his face. He’s careful with what he does and what he eats, not wanting to risk bringing any harm to their unborn child.
Why did Peter get to go and not her? Why was he so special? Because he had powers? Because he could save the world? Morgan always thought the powers didn’t make the person. At least that’s what she had been told.
He stops running to catch his breath. The cool temperature brings relief to his heated skin and if he’d have it his way he’d spend the rest of the morning outside, but that was just an excuse to avoid his husband a little longer.
Steve laughs. “That’s not meeting in the middle.”
“Tempting, but I wanted to do this for you. Sorry if it’s too much.”
“Yeah! Good job, buddy. Now look at this.” Tony applies the color his son chose to his secret project. Harley squeals in excitement. “Cool, huh? Hmm, maybe it’s too much red. Let’s add another.”
“Hmm…” Steve hums and reads the name over in his head, then announces it out loud. “Peter? Huh. That’s cute, right?”
“Yes but let’s say Steve does call him again-”
With his son fed and dozing off, and his boyfriend out on a morning run, Tony takes advantage of the quiet and works on his latest project. A few of his teammates were in dire need of an upgrade, and he had promised a week ago that it would be completed. But taking care of a baby and checking up on SI left him little time for anything else.
“Tony, please,” Steve begs, applying more pressure. Tony only smirks, emitting a whine from Steve.
He passes by his father’s room, grateful that the door is still closed. Sooner or later it was going to be opened and all of the belongings nestled inside were going to come out and sorted. Peter hopes that’s a task saved for later.
“That’s why.” Sam points and Tony’s eyes land on Peter. “That kid meant more to him than anything else. He wanted him to know you and not miss out on having a relationship with you. Steve did miss out, but Peter doesn’t deserve the same treatment.”
He doesn’t want to think about that now so instead he changes the subject.
“Did it?”
“No, Daddy! You won’t fit.”
“It is the end of the world! His world! He’s a kid, Steve!”
“N-no! Don’t touch it!” The omega pleads when Tony tries to rip the collar off. As if to distract Tony, he clenches down, stimulating the alpha’s knot.
Someone is touching him, and his eyes shoot open, a few tears escaping now that they’ve been given an opportunity. He turns toward the figure standing beside him, meeting the soft green eyes of his aunt. She wraps her arm around his shoulder, and he clings tightly to her.
His belly tightens again and for the first time, he wonders if maybe he should start paying attention to himself.
“Again, sir?” Jarvis asks.
Steve takes a shaky breath. His eyes burn with fresh tears. He wants to confess how he feels and the thoughts he’s been having, but he can’t bring himself to do it. He doesn’t want to be a burden anymore. They don’t deserve to suffer because he’s a failure.
Tony reaches out for Steve’s hand, only for the omega to pull away.
“Do you want me to get Pete?” Tony’s question snaps Steve from his thoughts and he nods his head in response. Tony presses another kiss to his head then he’s leaving the room to get their oldest son.
“I...I can’t. I’m not allowed.”
“If you don’t want to tell me then that’s fine, but I just want you to know that you don’t need him for this. If he doesn’t want to take responsibility then that’s on him. You still have me, your father and Ned.”
“Shh.” Steve shushes soothingly, not wanting to wake his friends. He felt bad enough that they were here with him and missing out on sleep. “It’s okay, Pete. Shh, it’s okay.”
Tony ignores the voice. “Let’s try again.”
Tony smirks. “You guys buddies now?”
“I know. Let’s be quick then.”
“You’re not going to hurt him. If anyone’s going to screw up it’s me.”
Enough was enough. He can’t do this anymore. He can’t continue to hurt Steve in the most horrific way. He can’t continue to end these innocent lives. He was the one who was fucked up. Steve didn’t deserve this kind of abuse. Steve deserved so much better.
“It’s tempting.” Sam pretends to think it over. “But I’ll pass. It’s just not possible for you to slow down.”
“I know what you’re thinking.” Pepper’s voice is back in his ears and Steve peers up at her, not realizing that he had glanced down again. “Tony loves you. I can see it; everyone can.”
Tony sighs. “Yeah.”
“Maybe you still can.” Pepper reaches for the letter again and the wallet size photo that was attached to it. She shows him the smiling face of a little boy with brown eyes. “He’s your second chance. You can still make things right for him.”
“Stark’s weapons popped up. There’s some trade going on and we need to shut it down.”
“Okay. Text me if you feel bad. I’ll pick you up.”
“Hold her?” Tony questions and Peter nods his head in response. “You don’t have to ask. You’ll be holding her most of the night anyway.”
“Yeah.” There’s a hint of a smile on Steve’s lips. He can’t wait to bring his baby home. But at the same time he’s scared. He never thought he’d have to care for a baby before. “You’ll be here, right?”
Steve rereads the words he wrote over and over again, before deciding it was enough and putting the letter away. He doesn’t know why he’s even bothered to write to Tony again when he was supposed to be moving on, but the letter isn’t just for Tony. It’s for Peter too.
“Nope. I’m surprised he’s even letting me feed him now. He fought all day with the bottle. Guess he misses being fed from the source.”
Peter smiles and hugs his uncles again. “Thank you. I’ll never leave again. I promise.”
“Yeah. It was nice. I’m glad you enjoyed yourself. It was about you, remember?”
From where he’s sitting he can still hear the soft music playing in the background and the laughter and voices from the team. He wishes he could be a part of them, but the voice in his head reminds him that he never will be. He chose to walk away from everyone and leave behind the only family he had.
Steve sighs and takes Tony’s hand again. “I was so scared. When Nat told me-Tony, I didn’t know what to do. I thought you were…”
“Auntie!” Steve rushes to his aunt, giggling when she picks him up and starts placing kisses along his face.
“Hmm…” Steve pretends to think it over. “No. You’ve never been great with words.”
“Relax, Omega. I have a good feeling about this one. The alpha chosen for the conception is extraordinary. His genes are exactly what we’ve been looking for.”
Oh Tony now you’re in trouble 😩
The SUV parks near the back entrance, the same one Tony had used all those months ago when he first found Steve alone on the busy streets of New York. It’s incredible how far they’ve come since then.
“You are not a burden. You are the best thing that ever happened to me, and I’ll never regret having you.”
“But you didn’t have to yell. Oh and then you got mad over the laundry, and the living room being a mess, and the conference call I had to take.”
Steve’s vision blurs with tears and he grips the knife tightly. He finds himself moving toward the bedroom, only to stop. He can’t do it. Every ounce of him wants to hurt the alpha like the way he’s been hurt, but he can’t bring himself to do it.
Steve swallows hard and lets out a shaky breath. He doesn’t lift his head when he continues, almost as if he’s ashamed to look Tony in the eye. “It’s part of the plan. You were chosen to...to mate...with me.”
It happens a few more times, along with the cramping. He brushes it off to avoid working himself up over nothing. He couldn’t be stressed and worried now, not when his son was going to arrive at any time. He needed to be there for Tony.
Tony turns away from Steve, settling his eyes on the baby. He’s frozen from both shock and fear. The baby should be moving, crying; but it remains lifeless in his arms. The worst comes to mind.
Steve slumps back, his body going lax. He’s drained and the overwhelming urge to sleep washes over him, but he forces himself to fight the exhaustion. He wants his son.
“You’re hilarious.” Tony rolls his eyes and turns to leave. He calls over his shoulder, “you’re just jealous because I’d make a cool dad.”
With the man down, Steve takes a moment to collect himself. His breathing is labored and the pain in his stomach continues to worsen. He wonders if the kick he received plays a part in that.
Tony smiles and leans in slowly. Steve follows him until their lips are meeting for the first time. The kiss is short, gentle, a little unsure. Tony pulls away first.
Tony scoffs and Peter’s sure if he wasn’t wearing sunglasses he’d be able to see his dad roll his eyes.
“But, Papa-”
“We are,” Tony assures and he gently pulls Steve forward. Steve follows and Tony wraps him in his arms. “I love you so much. And Morgan loves you. Don’t ever think that for a second that we don’t.”
Steve smiles. “Sounds fun.”
“Watch out,” Flash sneers. “I’ll get you later.”
Tony sighs. “I don’t know why I did this.”
Tony purses his lips. He doesn’t want to respond because he’s lost count of how many times Steve has come back looking like he got the beating of a lifetime. This wasn’t the first time and it sure as hell wasn’t going to be the last. Steve of course walked all of those instances off. He’d probably do it all again.
“That’s okay.”
“Some of us are obviously still in training,” Steve gestures to his costume and Peter giggles.
Tony finds a bottle he missed and drinks from it, but the pain was still there. It would forever haunt him.
“Yeah. Don’t tell anyone.”
“I think so. I mean, we’ve kinda done it before. We can still save the world together. Just not…” Tony trails off. He knew breakups could be hard, but theirs was like nothing he’s ever experienced. It didn’t compare to the countless others he’s gone through in the past.
“It’s nice to meet you,” Steve says politely.
“Look, it’s just better if I go,” Tony says. “Besides, what do I even contribute here? Just the stuff,” he waves his hands around the room. “This place?”
“What he did wasn’t your fault. I don’t….I don’t blame you for that night.”
“Is fine! I can do this. I have to.”
It’s Steve’s turn to laugh. “That’s my line. But in this case you can have it. I don’t want to do this all day.”
“You’re going to make me go back, aren’t you?”
“Wait, you’re taking me back? But it’s not 6 yet.”
Flash’s grip loosens now that he has Peter’s attention and he drops his hand to his side. Peter eyes him suspiciously, waiting for him to say something mean or hit him. Maybe even both.
“I love you, too.”
Tony scoffs. “You don’t think he’d try? Just because my mark is on Steve’s neck doesn’t mean he’s free. That asshole would challenge me if given the chance.”
Tony doesn’t say anything else. He honestly doesn’t know what he’s supposed to say to cheer his husband up.
“What happened?” Tony asks Bruce, his eyes never leaving Peter.
“Weren’t you?”
Steve smiles at the praise. “Thank you, Doctor Banner.”
Tony joins them, smiling when James moves over so that the older alpha can take the middle seat.
Peter glances down at his lap. “N-no Avenger life for me.”
There’s some part of him that regrets letting the dog stay, but then he sees the way Steve brightens up at the sight of the dog, and he’d hate to be the one to crush his boyfriend’s happiness. So whatever feelings he has toward the dog, he pushes them all aside for Steve.
”I’d be careful with him hanging around the building by himself,” Happy says, “you don’t want people getting the wrong idea.”
Even if they were in a fight.
Steve leaves and slams the door hard behind him.
“Tony!” Steve calls out for him and this time the alpha looks up, revealing his broken, tear filled eyes. “Tony, please! I’m sorry!”
“I know,” Tony agrees. “But I want another chance to prove I can be a better father. I don’t have this all figured out yet, and to be honest it’s going to take some time for me to fully grasp this whole parenting thing. But I need another shot.
It was a lie of course. He wasn’t fine. His stomach was acting up again and he was sure the second he saw Flash he’d vomit all over again. Hopefully not on him.
Steve moans and grips Tony’s hair harder, causing the alpha to wince from the sting. He ignores the discomfort and continues to pleasure his mate, enjoying the sounds Steve makes. He adds another finger and increases his pace.
“You’re overthinking again. I already told Steve not to worry. Do I need to have that talk with you, too?”
“I do.”
“Thank you, gentlemen,” he addresses the other alpha’s first and waves them away.
Tony moves past his bodyguard to get closer to the trembling omega. The guy was massive, standing at least a few inches taller than Tony. He didn’t fit the description of an omega at all. But the times were different now. Tony wasn’t about to judge and make assumptions.
“I’m a little busy.”
Sorry this chapter is a little on the short side. I wanted to get this one updated before focusing on other works that need my attention. Thank you so much for all the love and support! You guys are amazing and I love each and every one of you 😊 ❤️❤️❤️
“I doubt it.”
“Uh-oh. Someone’s gonna sleep on the couch tonight,” Natasha chuckles.
Peter holds out his pinkie. Tony eyes it for a moment, and with a roll of his eyes, wraps his own pinkie around the one offered to him.
“Pete, you didn’t screw up. Well, maybe being a stowaway wasn’t your best move, but what happened isn’t because of you. He just...he…”
“I meant with your son. Peter needs you-”
It took him a while to realize that he wasn’t at fault for their loss, and during that time he made the decision to stop trying. He didn’t want to lose another and deal with the pain he still struggled with. It was a pain he couldn’t describe even if he wanted to. He wished it on no one. Not even his greatest enemies.
“You did everything you could. Steve-” Tony quickly takes his husband's hands. “-you did everything right. It’s not your fault. And don’t think for a second that I blame you because I don’t. These things happen. But God does it hurt. It hurts so fucking much.”
"You're 35 weeks pregnant, Captain."
“Hurry up, squirt.” Tony gestures hurriedly. “I know how much you wanted to get this done.”
With Peter calm and distracted, Tony steps away to assist his mate. “What do you need me to do?” He asks, clasping his hands together. His eyes land on the bag of chocolate chips and he helps himself to a handful.
Regardless of what the man’s secondary gender was, Steve coils back and growls at him. He didn’t know these people or what their agenda was. For all he knew they could be another threat.
“Two years. I guess I thought it couldn’t happen. Even when strange things began to happen...I didn’t want to get my hopes up.”
Omega’s were the loving and caring ones of the pack, nurturing the pups and supporting the alpha. Steve had never wanted to be the stereotypical omega. He had the freedom to be his own person and have a life outside of raising pups. The times were different now, but Steve still felt he needed to be a good omega for his family.
“That wasn’t five minutes.”
“What’s his ETA?”
“I do!” Peter tries to defend.
Tony sighs harshly. “I’m still trying to figure that out. I thought I could hide out here with you until we both could go back but...it’s not looking that way. I won’t leave you alone. If I have to go then...then Happy can be here and of course Jarvis. Lord knows he loves you.”
“Oh. Yeah don’t make her way. Get out of here, Pete.”
“Peter’s asleep so good luck getting anything out of him,” Tony says.
Hope everyone is doing well! Thank you so much for reading!
Steve’s brows furrow and he picks up the wadded up tissues. He unfolds the tissues and gasps audibly at what he finds. He picks up the pregnancy test and stares at the two pink lines.
“I know. I guess I just thought…” Steve trails off.
“Kind of hard not to. He’s growing up.”
Steve glances around the familiar space before gingerly lowering himself down on Tony’s sofa. With one of them calming down, Tony works on getting the other to do the same.
“I can help you if you want,” Steve says. It wasn’t like he was going to get any sleep anyway.
Tony complies with the order and works quickly on shedding his clothing. Steve isn’t too far behind and his clothes soon meet Tony’s in a piled mess on the floor.
Bruce approaches Peter’s side and smiles warmly. “I need you to unbutton your jeans and lift your shirt.”
“Thank you.” Steve peers up at Tony. “I don’t know what I’m doing.”
Someone is touching his shoulder and for a second Peter forgets he’s with Ned. One glance around shows students heading toward their classes.
“What do I do?”
Oh! I was also thinking of doing a prequel of sorts. Nothing too long but maybe showing what happened to Steve during his time with Hydra and Pierce. It's just an idea.
“Cap?”
“Yeah.” Steve winces again. “I think Dodger figured it out before I did.”
He couldn’t do this. He shouldn’t even be here. His father should still be alive and together they’d be back at the compound. It was a cloudy day, perfect for cuddling up on the sofa and watching movies. It’s something they always did on days like this. But instead of watching a movie, Peter is watching his father be buried.
Steve pushes aside those thoughts, not wanting to upset himself over the past. That was behind them now. They were free and moving forward.
“Yeah,” is all Peter can say.
“I saw how you were with him. I haven’t seen you like that in a while.”
They fall into a silence. It’s slightly uncomfortable, especially when the quiet continues to go on and no one appears to make the first move to end it. Steve finds it worrisome. He wonders what he did wrong.
Tony isn’t alone. Dodger is lying near his feet while Tony stocks the wooden dresser with baby clothes. Steve had meant to do that earlier, but with his due date just around the corner, he had been too exhausted to do much of anything.
“Morning, Petey,” Steve greets followed by a yawn. Peter was always the first one up, demanding someone-that someone being Steve-play with him.
“So no Avenger life for you? He didn’t approve?”
“JARVIS?” Steve repeats and he glances around the room again. “Where is he-”
“Oh that’s...cool. Drives are fun.”
And he doesn’t want to think about the baby either. But it’s all he can think about. Nothing could fully capture his attention. He tried during Chemistry and again with his math test, but even that did nothing to distract him from his current predicament.
Bucky grumbles and tries to push Sam away, only to be brought back and squeezed a little harder.
Peter yawns and stretches again. Tony smiles and adjusts the blanket he’s wrapped in, making sure his son is comfortable for the long night ahead.
It’s not until he talks about waking up nearly 70 years later does he start to grow uncomfortable. Tony senses the change in his mate’s scent and brings their connected hands up to his lips, kissing Steve’s knuckles, assuring him that everything was okay now.
“Her?” Bucky shakes his head. “It’s a boy. I already called it.”
“Look good!” Harley agrees with an enthusiastic nod of his head.
“Hurry, Daddy!” Peter gently pushes Tony toward the stairs. “We need to go show everyone our costumes!”
They both run toward Tony, crawling onto the bed to be close to the alpha that’s supposed to protect them. Even James searches for the comfort.
“All I know is they wanted a perfect alpha.”
Peter nods and smiles. “Thanks, Papa. For everything.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“He struggled.”
With a sigh, Steve slips the letter in an envelope and tucks it away in the drawer of his desk. Maybe one day he’d have the courage to mail it off. And maybe this would be the letter Tony responded to.
“Happy?” Tony’s voice is laced with concern. “What’s going on? Is he okay?”
Harley tries to take the bag the second Tony calls his little family into the living room. Tony holds the bag out of reach, ignoring the way his pup huffs and crosses his arms over his chest.
Bucky was usually the one ready to fight, but his nephew needed him. And a break from avenging didn’t hurt every now and then.
For a moment, Steve hesitates. It would be easy to walk away now that the alpha was contained and without aid. Steve could walk out right now with his mate and son. He would be free.
Pepper is silent for a moment and Steve wonders if she already knew. Judging by her silence she probably didn’t. Tony never did say if he told his-their-friends anything. Steve wasn’t honestly sure if he wanted them to know just yet. His baggage wasn’t like most.
But now he had a chance to raise one of his children and though it was exciting to finally be a mother, it was also the most terrifying thing in the world. He didn’t have a clue about being a parent. He was thankful he at least had Tony by his side.
The discomfort in his stomach quickly becomes something he forgets about. Whenever it tightens again, it doesn’t last very long and soon it’s ebbing away. Jarvis doesn’t bring up a visit to the medbay, probably giving up. Steve was stubborn. It was something everyone knew and found annoying.
Steve shakes his head and reaches out to brush away the brown curls in his son’s face. “The baby stopped growing because it...died.”
“I won’t go after him. I just want to keep you and our baby safe. That’s it.”
Peter nods and nibbles at his toast. He can still feel his papa’s eyes on him but is relieved when he’s not questioned again.
“Okay.” Steve smiles and pecks Tony on the cheek, then he’s rising to his feet. “I’m going to pack her a bag.”
“At 3 A.M.! They’re not even open.”
“I know. Sorry.”
“Tony, did I-”
“Don’t be. I’ve got him,” Tony assures, flashing Steve one of his confident grins.
“Not even a little.”
It was easier said than done.
Steve nods his head. “Yeah. I think so.”
“Yep. Sure takeout sounds nice but I want to take you out.”
“I’m pregnant,” Peter says, his voice so low that he’s almost sure Ned didn’t hear him. But then he’s glancing at his friend again and by the look on his face alone, Peter is positive Ned had heard.
A sad smile appears over Natasha’s face. For a moment Peter feels he’s upset her by saying those famous words, but then her smile is gone and Peter knows he’s in trouble. He groans when he hits the mat again.
His eyes squeeze shut when the muscles tighten underneath his fingertips. He bites back the groan that builds in his throat, not wanting to draw unwanted attention to himself. They wouldn’t check on him. Keeping him isolated was what he deserved.
Steve wrestles with the men holding him down, desperate to break the chains around his wrists, but he’s bound tight and his efforts to get free prove futile. He doesn’t give up, not when his son needs him now more than ever. The shackles around his wrists dig deep into his skin the more he struggles, but the stinging pain is the least of his concern. He needed to get his son back.
“I didn’t want to tell you,” Tony says, “I didn’t want you to know what I did.”
Steve goes limp and Natasha has no choice but to set him down. She curses and props him up against one of the walls that’s still standing. She’s able to get a good look at him now. Steve’s skin is white, all of the color draining from his face. He’s panting heavily, his chest rising and falling with each intake of air he takes. One glance down shows how hard he’s holding himself, his glove and surrounding material of his suit drenched in crimson.
“Stop. He beat himself up already and I don’t want you to do the same.”
“Steve and the pups-” Tony begins to say.
“A few times. Come on, hurry up. Your dad’s waiting.”
Steve takes a shaky breath. “This is fine,” he tries to convince himself. “Everything’s okay. I’m fine.”
“Shield will deal with them. Steve-” Tony takes his original seat and sets the water bottle down on the glass surface of the conference table so that he can take Steve’s hand again. “-they won’t find you. No one will. You’re safe now. I know you’re scared and unsure, but I won’t let anyone hurt you anymore. I screwed up the first time but I won’t do it again.”
He doesn’t know how long he sits in the rain and cries. It feels like hours have passed, but it could only have been a few minutes. He doesn’t care that he’s soaked from head to toe or that his teeth are beginning to chatter. All he cares about is being near his papa.
“This is-this is crazy. Whatever the fuck you’re saying is crazy! What do I have to do with any of this? Who are you really? What the hell is going on?”
Clint scoffs. “You love parties. I hate to break it to you but there’s no one you can hit and run here.”
“I can hear you. I’m right here.”
“Tony?”
Tony peers up at his mate and winks, then he licks a stripe along Steve’s hole. Steve curses and throws his head back, his fingers tugging harshly at Tony’s hair.
“Go,” Tony urges and lies back down. “I need a minute anyway. I don’t heal like you do.”
Before he can even think of something to cover up his mistake, Tony is reaching out and cupping his face, forcing him to turn and meet the eyes he can’t get enough of.
She places a hand over his shoulder, causing him to flinch and peer up at her with red-rimmed eyes. She has never seen him so broken before. But he had every right to be distraught. Tony was his friend too.
“Fine. It’s a date.”
The armchair is the only empty spot. And probably always will be. It was Steve’s spot.
Taking down the first two men goes smoothly, but when the next three are coming for him, Steve is caught off guard when the pain in his stomach returns. It’s stronger this time.
“It’s okay,” Tony assures. “I got him.”
“Hey, hey, it’s okay. We can do this. It’s going to suck, believe me, but he deserves to know.”
Peter is perfect.
Sam and Bucky share a look, then Sam turns to Peter and says, “Are you sure?”
“You look nice,” Tony compliments with a smile. Steve flushes at the remark. He’s hoping the room is dark enough to hide his blush. Tony notices and slides a hand across the table, reaching for Steve’s. “I mean it. You’re so beautiful.”
“Do you?”
I’ll update soon! ❤️
“Fine,” Pepper says with a sigh of defeat. “And if you ignore me like that again I’m quitting.”
Steve peers up at him, brows drawing together in confusion. “Why are you helping me?”
Tony curses to himself when Steve refuses to pick up the phone. He’s ready to dial the number again, only to stop when Morgan needs him. He uses her as a distraction, and soon he has her fed and calm in his arms.
Now that he’s refreshed, it’s tempting to go downstairs and find Tony, but he holds off. They didn’t exactly get off on the right foot, not that Steve was really expecting them to. He had revealed his life story and then some to a man he doesn’t know. It didn’t help that that same man was also the father of his baby.
He lowers himself down to the floor, a shiver running up his spine from the cold surface. It wasn’t an ideal place to give birth. He’d rather be somewhere warm and safe to deliver his pup. But he was forced to give birth on the cold floor like some kind of animal.
“But you want another baby.”
“What happened?” Sam immediately fears the worst.
It’s just another lie.
Thank you for reading! 🥰
“In a moment. I’ll have a nurse wheel you in once you’re ready.”
“What!”
“You sure? Pete, you seem-”
I was on my lunch break and forced myself to finish this chapter. It’s on the short side and I guess more of a filler, but the next one will have more angst 😈
“Oh shit. That’s today?”
“You’re almost there.” Steve pecks Tony on the cheek. “I love you.”
“Sweetheart, it’s okay. You go back to bed and I’ll deal with this. Please? Just go to bed.”
He wasn’t expecting to feel any kind of significance when he agreed to join Nick Fury’s group of unlikely heroes. And to be honest, the first day he met the team members, he didn’t feel like he belonged at all.
Steve props himself up on his elbows and Tony crawls between his legs again, their lips meeting in another passionate kiss. Steve sits up to quickly discard his shirt, a pink hue spreading across his upper half and even higher until even the tips of his ears are bright red.
“The one I-that was the first one. After that there was another, but he didn’t make it. I don’t know what happened but the pup was sick and came early. Alpha blamed me.”
The drinking has gone from bad to worse. The day divorce papers arrived at his residence was when he picked up the bottle and never put it back down. Steve was gone for good.
Tony’s eyes fall shut. An internal battle rages on within him. A part of him wants to give in to his needs and properly mate with Steve, but the other half screams at him to back off. The omega had been through enough. Tony had already hurt him once, and he didn’t want to do it again. He’d never forgive himself.
“Hey, it’s okay,” Tony quickly assures. “I get it. Steve was gone and you just needed someone. I’m sorry I couldn’t be the someone you needed.”
Tony steps in to intervene, only to pause when Peter stops crying. Both parents watch in amazement as Dodger calms the fussy newborn.
“Yeah,” Steve agrees. A name was something that had slipped his mind. “I guess Baby Stark doesn’t work.”
James nods.
No. God no. He loves her. I just...sometimes he gets upset. You’ve seen it. I guess I was just worried that if he were to get overwhelmed again that maybe…”
“You can blame me,” Sam says. “I never should have let you go on that mission, Cap. I knew something was wrong-”
“I have a son,” Tony cuts her off and he glances down at the letter he hasn’t stopped reading. There’s a few opened ones around him, but it’s the one in his hand that Pepper takes. “For years he tried to tell me and I...and I did this.” Tony gestures to his lab and the drink in his hand. “I ran away. I’m just a coward.”
Peter releases another sob. He couldn’t do this. He couldn’t have a baby.
“You’re an idiot.” Tony huffs and curls up beside Steve.
“Kinda hope it’s sooner. Not that I don’t like being pregnant but I really want to meet him and hold him.”
“Oh. From family-”
“I want to go home. Buck, I want to go home. Please let me go home,” Steve begs.
Before he can even consider giving in to his son’s wants, a familiar scent wafts through the air and Steve knows he’s saved.
“You too. I mean with…” Tony makes a gesture toward Peter. It’s awkward between them and he can’t help but feel like he’s making it worse. It never used to be this way. If one of them was leaving for a mission, the other was always there to wish them luck and make time for a goodbye kiss. Even before they dated, a friendly pat on the back or a hug was still exchanged. Now there’s none of that.
“I’m so sorry.”
“We’re almost there,” Peter tells the toddler, getting a much brighter smile in response.
“I have a cat,” Bucky corrects. “Her name’s Alpine.”
“Pete, please? Did we really come this far just to throw it away? He wanted us to meet and be a family. You promised to give that to him.”
“Yeah. It’s crazy, huh?”
Tears fill his eyes and Tony angrily wipes them away. He wasn’t going to break anymore. He had to rise up from the ashes and start new. He wasn’t just getting his life back together for his son, but for himself. He needed care too.
“I don’t know,” Steve replies softly. He plays with the plastic ring around the bottleneck. “I do...but...I’m scared.”
But life had to issue the hardest punch of all and take the person he loved most away from him.
“Well...yeah…”
Bucky smiles and brings Sam’s hand to rest over his belly. “We’re having a baby.”
“That have a baby?”
Planning for a new baby was a lot harder than Steve had thought it was going to be. All he could think about was his son and what was still needed for him. They could cross out naming their son off their list of things to do, but there was still more that needed to be crossed off.
“He’s not eating,” Tony explains in a hushed tone. Happy directs his gaze on the omega then he’s turning back to Tony.
“He didn’t know,” Bucky defends his friend, just like he used to do.
Morgan’s eyes flutter and the nipple from the bottle loosens around her lips. Tony tries to remove it from her mouth, only for her to whimper and try to suck it back in. Tony smiles and let’s her nurse some more until her tummy’s full and she’s dozing off. He lays her down for the night and places a gentle kiss to the top of her head. He makes sure to leave the door open in case she needs him sometime during the night.
“Yeah. Why did we break up again?” Tony lifts his head so that their eyes meet. “I was an idiot and I’m sorry.”
“Wait, Bruce,” Steve immediately stops the doctor. “There’s...something else.”
“I...I guess. It’s your call, Cap.”
“Tony,” Happy takes control over the conversation. He presses down a little harder on the accelerator. “This baby’s coming now.”
“I’m...trying…” Steve says through gritted teeth. The contraction intensifies and he cries out again. “Go faster!”
He recognizes the signs almost immediately. He woke up that morning with the urge to be near Steve and hold him close. His mornings usually involved waking up to the omega beside him and curled up in his arms, but there had never been the need to mate with Steve. It was a huge step for them and they’ve only talked briefly about the idea. They were taking it slow.
Getting to the clinic was easy enough. Taking the bus wasn’t anything new; there were times when he’d prefer public transportation over Happy driving him around. This time Peter couldn’t risk asking Happy to drive him. His secret would be out, and that was the last thing he wanted.
“I’m sorry.”
So when the day of the appointment arrives, Steve can’t seem to keep his nerves under control. He’s worried about the baby’s health and he hopes everything is going smoothly. He’s also excited about finding out the gender. He crosses his fingers that the baby cooperates.
“Yeah. How’s everyone?”
“Pete, I did help.”
Tony takes a deep breath to calm himself. This draws Peter’s attention and he turns toward him.
Tony moves to leave and Steve’s hand flies out to stop him. “Tony, wait! The baby isn’t-”
“More like years.”
“I guess I forgot that’s an option now.”
“But you do have to talk to me. If you feel safer doing it here then that’s fine.”
“Yeah. I guess I just got a little overwhelmed. This is…a lot.” Steve can’t help but glance around the new items and the ones Tony had set up days before.
“But you’re done now right?” Steve asks and he lifts Peter off his chest to hand to Tony.
Natasha rushes toward him. “Steve, it’s okay. It’s me,” she says.
“So…” Bucky is the first to start, rocking nervously on the balls of his feet. His eyes flicker in the direction of the newborns, brows drawing together when he frowns. “Two babies?”
“No. I mean...no. He’s just...adjusting. And believe me I get it. I’m trying to figure this out too.”
“Hey, kiddo!” Tony greets, doing his best to hide any sadness from his tone. Peter mumbles some kind of response and sluggishly moves toward the island, pulling back one of the stools and plopping down in it. Tony chuckles at his son’s behavior. Peter was never a morning person. “How’d you sleep?” Tony asks and he comes over to properly greet his son with a kiss.
Alexander nods, appearing pleased that his event was suiting the billionaire. “It’s all for you, Mr. Stark.”
His phone dings and he quickly takes it out of his pocket, finding a text from Ned. Peter’s fingers hover over the keyboard, unable to form a proper response. He gives up and slips his phone back into his pocket, then quickly freshens up and makes his way back to the cafeteria.
Peter rolls his eyes. “That’s not why I’m telling you this. I don’t want to be with you. You’re an asshole.”
“Tony, I don’t mean to bother you...again. I apologize for all the calls and texts, but I need to tell you something. I haven’t left a voicemail before because I had wanted us to talk over the phone or in person. But it’s clear that isn’t going to happen.”
Tony hates it. He hates all of it.
“I know, I know. I just...I can’t stop thinking about him. I thought if I distracted myself with this then he wouldn’t be on my mind so much. I realize now that was stupid because this project only reminds me of him.”
“That’s exactly right!”
“I’m glad you’re safe,” Steve whispers to his son. He was glad all of his children were safe. They weren’t locked away somewhere, scared and alone. Wondering when the bad guys would come back to issue more harm.
Not needing to be told twice, Tony drags his cock out until just the tip remains inside, then he thrusts his hips forward and pushes back into Steve’s wet heat. Steve whimpers and holds onto Tony tightly, burying his face in the crook of the alpha’s neck and inhaling the scent. He lets go immediately, remembering that his arms need to remain by his side. He can’t touch.
