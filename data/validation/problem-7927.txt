Words, then.
Slowly, Steve turned, walking towards what he assumed was the former master bedroom. Once standing in the doorway, he froze, not quite grasping what lay right in front of him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve smiled. Tony’s goatee couldn’t really be called a goatee anymore, by now he had stubble all over his lower face.
Steve smiled against his neck. “But I have to admit, I never imagined Tony Stark would say my name like that.” He kissed his exposed throat, then kept an eye on Tony’s face.
told you. There’s no excuse for keeping it from you.”
His blue eyes were so close, Tony could have counted his lashes. It took him a moment to remember that there was something he’d meant to tell Steve as the two of them had a moment of quiet.
Rhodey sighed, rubbing his forehead. “After you suggested for Car to come along, I thought it wasn’t a big deal to—”
“My face doesn’t talk.” Steve paused, his brows bunching together contemplatively. “All right, it does, but—”
“Counting on it,” Tony grunted and his eyes fell shut as Steve’s thrusts grew harder. He’d never even softened, not for a second. Instead, he was really pumping himself into Tony now. His chest was pressed against Tony’s chest and his mouth was slotted against Tony’s neck, probably decorating him with a handful of hickeys.
It really didn’t.
,” Steve breathed, grinding his hips against Tony’s with a desperate movement.
Steve was in no hurry to get either of them off. He was enjoying the moment. Tony's warmth, his slightly sweaty skin, the smell of lube and latex and sex, and the sound of Tony's voice as he moved in a steady, slow pace, all contributed to this sense of rightness that Steve was feeling. The hand at Tony's stomach moved to allow his fingers to trace along Tony's dick.
By the time he was put down on some sort of surface, he did not feel it.
“Well, you should’ve stayed home!”
“Literally?” Sam asked with a wince.
Tony hooked his chin over Steve’s shoulder and inhaled deeply. “Are you sore?”
There was nothing in reply. Steve sat in silence. Seemingly satisfied to watch his friend, for now.
“So the plan is to sit this out,” Wanda concluded.
A deep sigh, and that was answer enough. Steve shook his head anyway. “I think he knows I’m here, but… he ignores me.” He took a deep, shaky breath, staring down on the tabled. “Any more news on SHIELD?” he asked after a moment.
Steve blinked. “
“Tony and I will check your implants again tomorrow,” Bruce offered. “It’s… Maybe they’re still sending off signals, but there’s gotta be a way to turn them off for good.”
The Detective’s eyes shone upon him with surprise and something very close to… sadness. But there was no fight. There was no fight in him at all. He let the crowbar sink, then fall to the ground.
“Long time since I got to see you with one of those,” Steve mused, nodded at the tablet, and quietly closed the bedroom door behind him.
Steve smirked. “Don’t
Clint winced. “Let’s not get crude or anything.”
Tony didn’t know how long he stayed like that, lying on the empty hotel bed and staring at Steve’s sleeping form, until exhaustion finally worked its way through him.
TS 11:56 A.M.>N8, Steve
Obi raised a brow as he regarded him. “I told you I’ve made an appointment with the board. You have to show up at least once.”
“I’m right here,” Steve told him quietly and only just refrained from taking his hand.
Perhaps that was all that love had ever taught him. How to hurt someone before they had a chance of hurting him.
“No sandwich, no coffee,” Rhodey told him. “Steve wouldn’t want that.”
Reaching his hands down to rest at Tony's waist, Steve guided him away from the curb and towards the outer wall of the club. "What am I going to do with you…" he mumbled, not sure if it was a question or a complaint or what, but he knew, as soon as he had Tony pinned, that he couldn't turn back now.
. “And you have every right not to want me back, I won’t make a big deal out of it, and you’re all getting along just fine without me, I get it, just…” He took a deep breath, exhaled it.
“Well, I’m not drunk, if that’s what you wanna know,” Tony snapped and whirled around. Too late, he realized that Steve actually
“Yes, me, whatever,” Tony placed his hands on Steve’s hips and pulled him in until their lower bodies came into contact.
years. Twenty years from Tony’s time. He could only guess how much had changed in such a long time.
Bucky hummed, quiet while he chopped another wood log.
"Come on, let’s see if we can..." Bucky just started saying, paused, looking at Steve, then following his gaze, which was still fixed on Tony. A beat of silence passed. "So that's—"
He had all but accepted the fact that he might never talk to his best friend again. And now this. A road trip. In a RV. A ridiculously large and luxurious RV, sure (this was the Stark family, after all), but a RV nevertheless. He and Tony would spend every waking hour together, cook together, visit cities together, hell, they would probably sleep in the same room.
This Steve was still his friend. And Tony
throat. As soon as that fact registered, Steve pulled his hands back like he'd been burnt, rolling off him and sitting up, staring at him with no small amount of bewilderment.
He frowned, then cleared his throat. Right. Pepper had said something about the room having no phones and he’d be contacted via the speakers, instead. Stepping up to the monitor that was installed next to the workshop’s exit doors, Tony activated the camera, then looked up at the face of one of the tower’s receptionists. “Yeah?”
know your standpoint,” Natasha murmured, earning herself one of Steve’s rare glares.
Tony walked across the room, ignoring his question. “I’ll probably dream of you for decades after this is over. I’m in too fucking deep. And this is so goddamn
“Steve?” Bucky prompted quietly and his gaze was far too insightful.
“You were frozen and defrozen for over seventy years,” Tony replied lowly. “That’s a whole lifetime. ‘Course you need some time to process all of that.”
“Sure,” Tony replied, and he felt so much lighter already. Only Steve managed to do that. “Soda?”
Steve blinked, turning around and looking at her, and then at Clint. He wasn’t paying them any attention. Instead he was sorting through his arrows, quietly talking to Rumlow. “Our mission is to rescue hostages.”
* * *
Tony asked.
Steve blinked, and looked at him for a long, dumbfound moment. Then he cleared his throat, shifting a little to get more comfortable. “What?”
With one last look towards Tony, Howard made to leave.
Stark hummed, satisfied. “See, Frosty? You might actually walk away from all the shit they put in your brain.”
At that, Pepper smiled, and it even turned a little brighter when she greeted Steve with a nod. “I’m sure. You doing alright there?”
“But Tony’s running the company together with me,” Stane went on. “He has done so for many years. And I am warning you, boy, not to meddle with something that is none of your business. We should both stick to what Tony wants us to do for him, shouldn’t we? Tony asked me for exactly two things for your shared rooms.” He pointed towards the desk. “Some place with good lighting where you can draw and…” He smiled crookedly as he nodded towards the rather large bed that stood in the adjoining room.
That was easier said than done. His breaths were coming in gasps. After all, his partner was the devil. The devil worked as a civilian consultant for the LAPD, because apparently, that was a thing that happened. God, heaven, demons, angels—it was all real. He’d been… he’d kissed an angel. He’d… he’d fallen in love with an angel.
Big-Ant-Guy, however, proved frustratingly strong. There was no way he was relying on natural strength—his suit had to be a marvel in itself and Tony had some vague memory that he’d seen blueprints of this, but he couldn’t put his finger on it. The process of size alteration had to generate huge amounts of physical force and momentum, which would be scaled beyond that of normal humans. In any case, he paid Tony back every punch. Every kick. Every anything Tony threw at him to finally get to Steve. It was damned irritating, and had T’Challa and Rhodey not swept in and taken him by surprise Tony might have been a puddle on the ground by now.
“I don’t,” Steve said. “I know he’ll know.”
Grimacing as Steve pushed himself forward, he was relieved to see Pietro sprinting towards Rumlow. He ducked as a fist swiped at him, landing a sharp kick to Rumlow’s ribs. Straightening once more, Pietro was about to hit the man again when Rumlow landed a powerful blow to his jaw, rendering him unconscious as he fell to the ground.
TS 10:21 A.M.>FUCK
“I didn’t do it because of Steve.” Not
“Alright, off you go,” Tony said, albeit a bit reluctantly. “Withering away for sex is a noble cause but I prefer to keep you healthy and well nourished.”
"Gym," he said then, grabbing Tony's hand and leading him under the staircase towards the large doors that led to the training area.
He let two of his fingers trail artless patterns across Steve’s chest, memorizing every inch of skin, because he had a feeling this conversation might just put an end to all of this.
Pietro stepped up next to his sister. Steve took a moment to glower at him before he cradled Tony’s head against him.
, and what we do, it’s worth it.”
be, but… he... didn’t,” Tony said slowly, taking a few steps to the side so he was standing right behind Steve. “DUM-E?” he called, and sure enough, the claw was raised right above Steve’s head, its angle perfectly directed at Tony.
“I made an interpretation based on my information that most people seem to be attracted to a more forward approach.”
Tony smiled, turning around and grabbing for Steve’s hand. He pulled it to his mouth and kissed his palm. “I’m not some embittered housewife, darling. I can deal with being neglected for a while." It was a lie. In the past days, he had been

overdressed.
Steve stared at Tony in confusion.

“Maybe we could get the pool table from Thor’s floor,” Sam mused, looking around. “And oh, darts, we definitely need darts. Entertainment, people, entertainment.”
“Home?” Steve asked, and maybe he was overanalyzing things, but it looked as if Tony startled at the sound of his voice.
Steve stilled at those words, unable to truly grasp the weight behind them.
Bucky exhaled an annoyed breath as the door to his room opened with a
Obi chuckled, his fingers digging into his shoulder just a tad too hard. “It sure does.”
Steve smiled back. “We’ll love this baby a lot.”
Cleanup went quietly between them, and Steve waited out that quiet again. He could tell, from the energy in Tony's movements, his concentrated look, that his mind was racing again. Amazing that it could come back online so soon after orgasm, he thought absently, but didn't say anything in comment. Tony would speak his mind sooner or later. That’s how the guy operated.
“And you’re back early,” Tony countered.
Steve’s eyes dropped somewhat. “Only me?”
worked for Fury himself, after all, and he knew about the duo’s obligations.
Ross clearly didn’t approve, but nodded anyway. “Fine,” he said and with a deep breath, he stood back up from his chair. One of his companions handed him a remote control, and Ross turned on the monitor behind him as he took stance in front of the team. “Gentlemen, the world owes the Avengers an unpayable debt,” he told them, and sounded honest enough. “You’ve fought for us. Protected us. Risked your lives. While a great many people see you as heroes. There are some… who would prefer the word ‘vigilantes’.”
“You’re not,” he said, as he reached for the hem of Tony’s shirt. He’d seen the arc reactor up close already, when he and Tony had slipped into bed a few days ago. Nothing had happened—they were both too tired right after the fight, and the destruction and violence of the battle too close—but Tony had told him about the last sixteen years. Not in great detail, but he had told him about Afghanistan, and Obadiah, and the Palladium. It had Steve want to wrap him into his arms protectively, but it also brought forth a fierce rush of pride that Tony had made it through all that—all by himself.
And if Steve was really honest with himself, he sometimes wished he… wouldn’t be.
Tony pursed his lips, sighing. “I really am sorry. I didn’t want to make this harder on you. I just… I can’t let them think for so much as a
not sitting in the driver’s seat, it was one of those more serious quirks Tony hadn’t managed to get rid of. Yet, with Steve, he at least allowed to give it a try from time to time.
Moments that had become meaningless in the face of their hate.
“I do,” Steve hurried to say.
"It's amazing," he said, getting a little light headed, like he was having a deja vu, and the next words out of his mouth came as though from another world.
Next to him, Tony jerked bolt upright. They’d been sleeping in the shelter, or not-sleeping, in Steve’s case. It was a bit pathetic, the endless minutes Steve had been staring at the wall in front of him as he listened to Tony’s breathing.
Tony grimaced. “I don’t believe in fate.”
Steve rolled his eyes. He looked down at Ian, and pressed a kiss on his forehead.
"Your roommate always such a charmer?" she asked.
The irony of it all was that he had known this. Signing the Sokovia Accords, he’d known that at the end of it all, there might be still Rhodey at his side, there might still be Vision, but most of the team would leave.
Tony cast him a lopsided grin, before he opened his eyes. For a moment, there was nothing. His gaze was blank. Then he blinked and breathed, clearly a little overwhelmed, “Oh, baby.”
When Tony finally did hit the ocean’s surface, it was with less of an impact than he’d been expecting, although it was still enough to knock the wind out of him. He hit feet first, going deep very fast. Water rushed all around him, and he rolled, hitting his head within the suit and scraping both of his hands. When he stopped, Tony floated in the ocean for a moment, blood trickling down his face. He looked up—and didn’t see any sign of the water surface, but instead a silhouette coming closer. On the next beat, there were arms wrapping around him, pulling him flush against a sturdy chest, and then he was going upwards.
Steve clenched his teeth and thrust harder. The deeper he burrowed himself, the more he wanted to stay there. Tony had started clenching his muscles and at the first contraction, Steve’s eyes went wide with shock.
Tony had his phone in his hands in a heartbeat, scrolling through some pages, before he typed in a few lines of code to probably get some of the not-yet-official information.
“You should’ve
Ant-Man had been on the news before, but it hadn’t been clear whether or not Scott was a good guy. Sam, however, was clearly rooting for him, and in Steve’s book, that was enough.
“It’s… it’s only hypothetical.”

That night, it took forever to fall asleep.
“Coward,” Tony murmured against those lips, pouring all of his outrage and despair into the kiss, while Steve was pressing himself against Tony furiously. It

the AI answered.
When Steve walked back to the mansion, stepping into the great entrance hall, a hushed conversation drifted through the air. Steve recognized the deep timber of Stane’s voice immediately, but there was someone else with him. Someone Steve
. Tony let his head fall back on the pillow, one hand flying to his throat as he pulled in a huge breath. He probably shouldn’t have done this while leaning right over Steve, he thought belatedly, inwardly scolding himself for being so stupid.
Steve stepped forward, doing that thing with his shoulders that made him five inches larger. “Diving in head-first without a plan is still better than only reacting when it's too late.”
Steve frowned slightly. Did Tony really think they wouldn’t be seeing each other after this? He would be lying if that didn’t sting at least a little. College was a busy time, sure. They’d meet a lot of new people, but of course they’d be seeing each other again. What made Tony think Steve would just drop him because they weren’t on the same school anymore?
,” Steve replied. “And I didn’t plead for anything. If anything,
“Have you worked here long?” Tony asked, as he walked out of the conference room. The first board meeting had lasted for a whole of three hours. It was late evening already, and there had been minor debates on Tony’s role in the company, some back and forth, but in the end, Tony figured he could probably work with those people. And maybe, he thought,
And yet, he couldn’t do it.
“Dead on time,” he said.
To know that he’d lost all of this hurt more than his broken wings ever could.
Natasha arched a brow. “How bad are we talking?”
They fell silent for long moments. “We will,” Steve agreed eventually, because he really wasn’t gonna force Bucky into this fight if it meant he’d be in danger of losing himself.
Had he truly lost Steve?
“I’m beginning to see that,” Steve admitted, and he hated this, because he knew that without HYDRA, those people might’ve had a chance. But Tony was right—they couldn’t afford to keep their morals in check right now.
Steve silently agreed, feeling how his heart was suddenly too full of something very momentous.
“No,” Clint said as he stared at Howard’s face, frowning a little. “Just thinking.”
This wasn’t what he’d wanted to create. This hadn’t been his vision. Ultron literally juggled the weight of chaos and order in his hands, and rejoiced in it.
“He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room. The police also found a wig and facial prosthesis approximating the appearance of one James Buchanan Barnes.”
He knew that Scott did have a little daughter he cared dearly for, and Steve refused to bring him into a situation he hadn’t willingly agreed to.
“Hell if I know.” he said. “Why don’t you go ask him? Preferably before he wakes up the entire tower.”
He couldn’t… he couldn’t believe the nerve of that guy. The way he’d just expected him to do what he asked of him, like it was perfectly normal… like he was
Bucky snorted and clapped his metal hand on Steve’s back as they made their way to the living room. “And here I thought I was done watching you pine for Tony Stark, but of course I ignored the possibility of time travel.”
“We’re making friends everywhere we go,” Natasha muttered. As soon as they had raised their heads, Steve spotted a crying man on the floor in the middle of the room, and two things were perfectly clear.
“I have a… thing in DC,” Natasha said, while putting her empty plate in the dishwasher. “Minor issue, no need to call in the whole team, but I thought I’d head out early, just in case.” She looked down at her wristwatch and cast them a crooked smile. “Speaking of which—see you later. Oh and Tony…” As she walked around the counter, she came to a stop directly next to Tony, putting a hand on his shoulder. “Glad to have you back.”
He sat up on the creeper, smiling when he noticed the food and drinks in Steve’s hands. That was… unexpected. And nice. And something that only Pepper and Rhodey did for him.
At some point last day, they had neared the border towards Germany. Vaguely, Steve remembered that Tony had stationed a Quinjet there, in some smaller airport near Leipzig. In a few hours, they’d make it there, and then they’d fly to Siberia. At least, that was the plan.
Steve opened his mouth to say something, but in that moment, there were steps right behind them, and someone raised his voice over the muffled sounds of people talking.
“What is it?”
Tony had wanted him to believe it then—
He tossed Steve a coy smile, deftly undoing the top button of Steve’s pants before turning to his zipper. If he hadn’t the one to design the whole thing, he’d probably be having a harder time figuring out how to do this, but as it was, Steve’s cock sprang into his hand only a second later.
TS 3:02 A.M.>Your star spangled dick ruined me for everyone else
Steve refrained from rolling his eyes as he leaned his hip against the desk. “Try me.”
Steve pulled a face. Reeds was probably the least pleasant person on campus; not vicious or evil but just… insensitive. "So you think he's hiding."
A shake of his head. “I don’t think that’s possible. Right now, we’re kinda it. Wanda’s under surveillance, Tony’s gotta take care of Ross.”
“Whatever you say, sweetheart,” Steve said and pointedly ignored the death-glare Tony shot him.
TS 6:33 P.M.>Don't mention it. How’s your head?
Tony blinked. What about that, Barnes was actually talking to him. And not just telling him to do something anatomically impossible to himself, but
Tony chuckled. “I didn’t build a time machine. We met someone called Doctor Strange. Giant asshole. I’m sure he’ll love to tell you more about it, but… It was a one-man-show, sorry.”
Steve snorted. “Yeah?”
“Mmm,” he hummed, slipped his hand between them and quickly shoved two fingers into her core. She cried out and he chuckled. “Oh baby, how wet you are…”
. Of course. Hadn’t their nanny once said this was about the age when babies started getting teeth? He’d read that some infants were notoriously fussy during that stage. Perhaps what Ian needed was simply something that would soothe the savage beast.
Pepper grinned. “I’m sure he was. Quite a character, isn’t he? We owe him for helping out in the last year, but… don’t let him get under your skin, Steve. He has a habit of doing so, especially to you, since he adored Indries.”
“Could you save it for when I’m not around?” Bucky asked next to them. “I don’t, I… It’s giving me a headache.”
Stark hummed, but didn’t say anything further. As they walked away, he opened his eyes after all and got a last glimpse of Steve pulling Stark against his side before they rounded the next corner.
And it wasn’t just one thing that bothered Steve. It was the sum-up of a thousand things. He had lost count of the number of times he had arranged a meeting with Fury to discuss SHIELD’s information policy with the Avengers only to feel very tired and decidedly not wiser afterwards.
Inside his earpiece, there was white static, then he heard one of the marines’ team leaders ordering everyone to get ready for action.
Something was different this time, with the vision, and Steve only took a moment to grasp it. He stared at Tony and pushed himself up as well. His memories had been completely unlocked, and if Tony's gaze was anything to go by, so did Tony's. It was all there, from the moment they'd met, through all their little encounters and Steve's—Stephanus'—concerns.
Steve still had a hold on Tony’s hand, his other arm wrapped around his waist, and even though Steve could obviously barely contain his amusement, Tony found himself slumping against him fully.
,” Pepper said, grinning broadly. “I kept trying to pry information from Tony, but he insisted that I come up and meet you myself.”
"You didn't have to." Steve knew he was agitated, and not just because of Bucky. The kiss was still on his mind despite it all. He was still questioning his course of action with Tony. "We both got enlisted and you got the short end of it. It was my fault and I couldn't—" He hitched a breath. "Couldn't face it. Couldn't face you."
Truth was, he hadn’t done this in a
“—beautiful,” he finished. “You’re perfectly beautiful.” He raised a brow when he felt Steve tremble. “This is new for you, isn’t it?”
Tony had a moment to stare into Steve’s horrified eyes, and he knew something was different before he felt it. Then, he cried out in pain, clutching at his own head that felt like imploding in on itself. His vision came and went, and he felt himself shaking on the floor and scream out his pain. Somewhere inside him, Extremis switched to autopilot, pulling up every firewall that protected him of whatever Ultron tried to unleash upon him, as the rest of him bowed under some of the worst pain he had ever thought to encounter.
Tony nodded, and as Steve fired up his bike and turned on the main road, Tony gazed up into the early evening sun near the horizon. And somewhere in the deep recesses of his mind, a small part of his conscious was still expecting the sun to go crescent in a perfect second of totality.
“You know I expect to get it back.”
. Not really enough time to have an honest conversation.
Steve’s mouth slid along Tony’s collarbone from the hollow of his throat to the point of bone on his shoulder. Tony was all taut, supple muscle and fine, strong bone with olive satin skin. Steve reached out a hand and ran it over his chest and stomach. Tony shivered and the way he was looking at Steve turned his bones to water—as if he were the only thing that mattered in the whole world.
“C’mon, squeeze me.” He flicked Tony’s erection, grinding into him as if to emphasize his words.
“We should get moving,” Steve said.
He let his thumb brush along Steve’s wet cheeks. “I’m sorry about Barnes,” he said. “I am. I would’ve never…”
“I don’t want to talk about me,” he said, then bit his lower lip contemplatively. “Let’s talk about you instead.”
Tony smiled, feeling lighter than he had in months. “I know… and I wish I would’ve let you.”
Together, they walked back into the bedroom, and Steve’s eyes followed Bucky’s gaze, as he inspected the space.
After adoption had been out of the picture, Tony’s mind had toyed with the various forms of surrogacy, but when they’d talked about it, it was clear as day that Steve was uncomfortable with the idea of paying someone to carry their child. He’d
He felt so far removed from the man who’d once stepped into the Iron Man suit and decided to take on the world on his own. There were too many doubts rooted in his blood now.
They didn’t need to talk in that moment; his thoughts were all over Tony’s eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s testing you. You’ll need to channel your mind to power your purpose!”
They stood like that for a long moment, and Bucky rubbed circles on his back with his hand. “I’m okay,” Steve said. He wasn’t, but he felt that Bucky needed to hear it.
Steve hardened. He had to. He caught the shield in midair, throwing it into Ultron’s side and pushing him off the truck’s roof. He rushed at Ultron, pushing him down on the asphalt, allowing the momentum to carry him right on top of him. He grunted silently with the impact, but held his shield down on Ultron’s throat, even though the robot was pressing up against it with all he had.
“What’s a… TVA?” he asked.
“It worked,” a serene voice said, far far away. “I can’t find any traces. Ultron’s gone.”
Steve’s brows furrowed. “What is it?”
Bruce hesitated. “Do we at least know where they are now?” he asked. “If we have a location…”
Next to them, Clint raised the vial in front of his face, and with a sceptical look, uncorked it. “Bottoms up,” he told the room in general, and as if bracing himself for a shot of tequila, he knocked the whole content back in one go.
“All right,” Fury said then, drawing a deep breath. “Mister Stane… obviously you have some thoughts as to what this letter means. Please enlighten us.”
The other voice belonged to Stark.

“Then explain it!” Steve all but yelled, slamming a hand on the table next to Tony, instantly drawing his attention back to him. “I cannot believe you did this behind our back!
It had been two days ago, when Tony had—not so legally—gotten notice of the document. Ever since, he had researched every law paragraph, every draft, every e-mail he could locate in an effort to understand what was going to happen.
for you.”
The images of Tony had plagued him, afterwards. His perfect bronzed body. His soft curves. His strong thighs. His firm ass. And his cock—god, he’d thought about Tony’s cock so often. He’d just thought it had been the shock but, in hindsight, his mind had most definitely taken a different turn here and then.
Both Tony and the woman ended up on the floor, after she’d grabbed his foot; Tony on his back, the woman on her side. Tony recovered first. He grabbed the monitor that still ran the video of his parent’s death from the pedestal and began beating the woman with it. She was able to dodge rapidly enough to avoid the blows, and though Tony delivered several good hits, she eventually managed to hook a leg around the back of Tony’s foot and jerk him back down to the floor.
Steve visibly swallowed as he took in the shield, its new paint-job—blue and red and very shiny. New and untainted.
something the two of them did, and he started to draw his hand back.
She held up a hand in a placating gesture. “I’m not asking for details, I just wanted you to know that whatever happened between the two of you… it’s your life. I think you should finally start thinking about yourselves. Put yourselves first, that’s all.”
Tony looked annoyed with that, but remained serene.
“Having a family changes people. And our little guy needs his parents.” A determined breath sounded through his lips as his gaze locked on Tony. “It was you who made me realize that I’m still
“I want to come home.”
Tony,” Tony clarified. “Not that I don’t want to, trust me, I do, but… I don’t want to spoil your first time with each other.”
“He almost killed you.”
Chuckling at Tony's admission, Steve looked down to where they were connected, meeting Tony’s motions whenever he pressed back. There was something wonderfully attractive about how Tony let him take over. Just the knowledge that he could do what he wanted… and that Tony would meet him thrust for thrust was making him a bit dizzy.
Holding up a huge remote control airplane with both hands, he stepped up next to Tony. He didn’t say anything, but his eyes were big and round with expectation.
“Disastrous? Catastrophic? Devastating?”
Raising his chin, Tony was ready to give Steve a piece of his mind, but was robbed of the option, when—suddenly—Steve leaned in and kissed him.
“Nothing,” Tony said, and even smiled at him for a moment. But it rang false.
Tony nodded, although he didn’t look happy about it. “So… Ultron?”
“A bit of both,” Maria and Phil said at the same time, and all of them broke into laughter.
Oh God, no.
, he was doing that thing again where he thought about Tony's looks.
Well, that plus Steve’s enthusiastic comforting later that night. A week had gone by and Tony was still tingling from that memory alone.

“Alright?” Tony asked with a slightly strangled sounding voice, as he cautiously pulled his finger out to start a slow rhythm.
Bucky stilled, then smiled a bit tensely. “Thanks.”
Damn it.
And it was just that, he told himself firmly. A nightmare. A vision. It had been the Maximoff girl messing with them, rationally speaking, he

Steve blinked.
“No,” Steve agreed. “I haven’t.” He felt Tony’s eyes piercing right through him. He squeezed his hand.
“You guys don’t actually plan to drive back tonight, do you?” Tony asked. “We have… I’m staying over at one of SI’s guest suites, the mansion needs some renovations before I move back in. Stay the night, drive back tomorrow?” He glanced at Barnes in question. “Besides, I still need to take your measurements. No data, no new arm.”
Tony’s eyes widened at the sight, as one skyscraper after the other just… vanished. And here he’d thought he’d seen it all. Giant portals, flying cities, speaking trees, but… this… it was…

Steve sighed, walking over to his own nightstand and putting the tablet down there. “What do you want me to say?”
SR 3:41 A.M.>We said we'd see where this goes. I meant that. For me that means we don't see anyone else…
“Fuck,” Tony ground out as he realized one of Clint’s EMP-arrows had hit his power transmitters. There was still plenty to keep the suit running, though. Shaking off his stupor, Tony saw Vision at the other end of the battlefield, still fighting Wanda, and it didn’t look like either of the two would be getting the upper hand soon.
of this, of Steve pretending this was something he couldn’t
For some reason, all of these supernatural beings had wormed their ways into Steve’s life. And he hadn’t even noticed.
"Mr. Stane, may I offer some painkillers? Mr. Hogan is just outside, ready to assist you in case you're still unstable on your feet. Can you stand?" She fired one question after the other, while Stane was slowly sitting himself upright and holding a hand to his forehead.
For a second, Tony considered keeping his mouth shut, relishing in the fact that they had both miraculously survived this stupid stunt, and yet, he couldn’t help but go for the dig. “Of course, you shouldn’t have come in here in the first place, but I guess even you got that memo, now.”
Before the others left again, Pepper had taken Steve to the side, placing a hand on his shoulder as she led him out of Tony’s hearing range.
“What?”
He leaned down to press his lips to Tony's cheek, then nudged it with the tip of his nose. He should be getting Tony a towel and his clothes. He should be taking care of things, but he couldn't bring himself to move away just yet.
“No, he does. He just doesn’t have a speech modulator. He’s understanding just fine. I figure it’s the TTS interface that’s giving him trouble, but that’s just one option out of, I don’t know, a hundred?” He let his fingers trail over the claw. “You’re just being stubborn, aren’t you, DUM-E?” When DUM-E didn’t move, Tony took a deep breath and jabbed his fingernails into his own palm.
Eventually, he started fretting again, not with the intensity of before, but it didn’t make it seem any less despaired.
“Tony,” he breathed and
“After,” Steve agreed, leaning in to steal a last, quick kiss.
They weren't fighting anymore, though, so that was good. Steve, even as he had been shouting, felt pretty awful for it. He had just been so upset that Tony would risk himself like this, even though he himself was as willing to do so… Well. They were going to have to find a way to handle this tendency they both seemed to share. He decided against saying anything, letting their contact convey what he felt.
Still, the sooner they’d arrive in Hopkinsville, the better. They could all do what they wanted for the rest of the trip, and Tony could place some much-needed space between him and Steve and get the tantalizingly delicious image of them writhing together on some bed out of his mind.
Tony smiled gently, moving to sit up.
it when Tony did that. Some things never changed.
When no answer came, the cold seeped through the glass and into Tony’s bones. He flexed his back as best as he could with the bandages holding it in position. It still hurt, his insides were still tender, but he knew, if it came down to it, he’d step into the suit and damn it all to hell if only it meant that Steve would return home safely.
[F.R.I.D.A.Y.] [chat_server:46957]
to say something and not caring if any of the others saw him crumble in the face of this… mess. “Sweetheart,” he prompted with a cautious tone, but Steve held up a hand to stop him.
With another parting kiss against his forehead, he leaned back again, taking a low breath. “And when I turn eighteen, we can… make this official, yeah?”
“Thirty-six,” Ross said, pointing at him. “And you’re going to work together with our teams, no tricks. You’ll link us to your team’s communication system, since you don’t have anything to hide from me, and you’ll share every bit of information.
Tony just looked at him pointedly. “I don’t exactly have much of a reason to trust you right now, no matter how great you claim we get along in your time.”
A bitter chuckle left Steve’s lips. “It’s not that simple.”
“That’s possible?” Steve asked, unsure.
Tony groaned, sucking Steve’s lower lip into his mouth. “
Steve breathed a long sigh. He wasn’t so sure that would be enough, but didn’t find it in himself to worry Tony even more.
No one else out there could possibly understand the loneliness and fear that came with getting out of bed every morning—none save the other people who had risked their lives at his side. Tony didn’t want to hurt anyone, but as the minutes ticked by, it was becoming more and more difficult to avoid it.
. If it’s that important to you… I’ll manage to have him around for a week, I guess.”
“Go over there,” Tony ordered Steve, and pointed to the ground in front of the stove, a few meters away. He kept one hand securely linked with Ian’s, but otherwise, Ian was standing on his own two feet.
“Fine,” Tony conceded after a moment. “We bring Barnes up here, two Avengers at his side minimum, and see what happens. Afterwards we decide if it becomes a regular thing.”
looking at
They were back, Steve realized. He stumbled a little, before sitting down on the floor. Tony did the same a few feet away from him, and when he caught his gaze—a carefully shielded, composed gaze—Steve knew that everything was going to change now.
Wondering if
A guy was kissing him.
Steve chuckled as he finished his survey of the fridge and closed the door. He turned around. “Okay, guys, here’s the plan: Bruce, Pietro, Scott, you’re making dessert. Vision, Wanda, you’re making the soup. Clint, Peter… uh, you can assist them…”
“Waiting? Tell me
Going back into the superhero business? Great idea. Great idea, indeed.
Looking up again, he met Tony’s gaze with his. “We’re going to be parents,” he said in wonder, and he knew it’d take a while before the thought would truly sink in. “You’re going to be a dad.”
He didn't regret it. Every experience had given Steve more knowledge on the activity, allowing him to be good enough for Tony when they hooked up. That didn't mean Steve would've let just anyone into his body. It had to have been someone special, truly close to Steve, and if he was completely honest with himself, he’d never thought it would actually happen.
Stane just smiled at him. “Oh, I think we both know it’s not so wild.”
Tony had systematically sewn back together Steve’s heart, piece by piece. And now he was gone.
“Business,” Barnes repeated with a puzzled frown, like the word wasn’t even part of his vocabulary.
Next to Steve, Sam threw a first aid kit and a few bottles on the floor, filling a syringe with clear fluid. He carefully pushed the needle into Dr. Cho’s arm, injecting her with what Steve hoped were some really good painkillers.
otherwise. No one deserves to carry this kind of sexual tension for so long. Besides, I was trying to get Cap laid."
Steve said nothing, instead he gently put Tony on the bed, which was a bit dusty as well. Kneeling down next to him, he smiled, taking in his form.
Steve closed his eyes, breathing in Tony’s scent. “No matter how this ends, I will never regret saying yes to you.”
“Oh… alright. And I’d love to meet him.”
He cringed inwardly as soon as the words left his mouth. That last sentence sounded too much like a demand, and he hadn’t really meant to ask for a definition, really, he just—
Tony considered this, then nodded and concentrated on the road again.
Everything… stilled.
“I don’t mind,” Steve replied, determined to keep Tony talking. “Pepper’s great.”
“Your lips are getting blue,” Steve stated.
Steve nodded. “Someday, I’ll hold him while you do it.” He sighed. “Come on… grab some plates and let’s get this party done.”
“It seems so,” Agent Romanoff said softly. “That’s why we’ll have to bring Mister Stark to our headquarters. Go through the night’s events one more time. Maybe it’ll help to identify the body.”
“Sounds good,” he said, catching Steve around the waist with one arm. “If we go early… there’s a nice little hotel on the way back to the facility. Know the owner, they’re very discreet.”
for today.” Nat gave Steve a pointed look that meant nothing to him, but seemed to mean a lot to her. Steve tried for a smile and said nothing.
Steve thought. “Good night,” he said instead.
Steve wasted no time and once more sealed the space between them, seizing Tony’s wrists with one hand, and pressing down against him. His other hand pried open Tony’s fly, and the next thing Tony knew, his cock leapt into Steve’s big, warm hand. A long, decidedly high-pitched moan tore from Tony’s lips and his head flew back against the couch cushion. While Steve’s right hand tightened around him, the other fought to shove his black dress pants down.
“Steve, if this is real…” Tony swallowed, “if
“Good, yes,” Tony said, following him towards the landing pad’s emergency-elevator that went straight down to Medical. He probably should put the suit through decontamination as well, Tony figured, and had JARVIS prepare everything inside the shop.
A low hum, then,
Tony huffed, and Steve saw his hands flexing. “Hate to break it to you, but constantly staring at me from across the conference table isn’t trying to have a conversation.”
TS 3:09 A.M.>Oh believe me, I could make you pop in a min
Tony directed the Iron Man suit north, then took the first exit into Eastern Market. He flew up Pennsylvania Ave, turning onto Capitol Hill. Smoothly, he cut a corner between two buildings and came to a stop on the next crossroad, hovering in the air.
Time was his worst enemy.
“You shut me out,” Ultron roared, throwing Tony off of him, before attacking Vision straight-on. “You think I
At that, Tony at least opened his eyes, and swiftly looked out of the tiny plastic window at the side of the tent. Clear skies. Perfect.
Tony’s flaws. He’d made a study of them when Tony’d been his mission subject, and now, in love with him as he was, Steve knew his quirks intimately. And he loved him for them. They made Tony real—made him human, despite the fact that with Extremis, he was so much more now, too. The way he—genius brain notwithstanding—still acted on emotion rather than thought, even if he refused to admit it. The way his nose scrunched up when he realized a mistake. The way his eyes were slightly pinched when he felt a bit too almighty. Tony was brilliant, clever, and so full of flaws that it made Steve realize why loving someone had never truly been real before him.
It took three sweeps of the city before Maria Hill finally sent them their current location. All the while, an hour rolled by with long conversations, all with the loom of the impending storm weighing over their heads. The uncertainty of where the future would take them… of where to search for a solution.
“It doesn’t mean I have to work with you,” Barnes said without so much as glancing up at him. “Go on missions, take orders?”
“And you?”
Oh, well.
Steve’s breathing hitched and his body warmed with elation.
* * *
you’ll talk to him. I don’t know what’s with you guys, but I won’t have Tony brooding when the eclipse starts. He has been waiting for this for all his life, so you’ll better make sure he is as happy as a toddler by then.”
That was the exact moment that Tony realized all of the others were nowhere to be seen.
TS 2:56 A.M.>Didn’t kiss anyone, jtlyk
“I just need this to be over,” he said, pointedly avoiding Peggy’s gaze.
Steve blinked. “I—”
better. Someone…
Tony sighed. “I told him why the team had fallen apart in my timeline. He didn’t take it so well.”
Several hands forced his body into the cold, fresh air. For a moment, there was nothing but light. Nothing at all for what seemed like an eternity. Then, the world appeared again in a blinding whirl of color and sound, and he was thrown, by some uncaring hand, onto some hard surface. For a moment, he could only lie there, gasping. His lungs hurt with each breath, as if they had become unaccustomed to the effort.
Not with you by my side. Not now, that my life finally makes sense.
, hoped that he’d be wrong about this. That Steve would see reason; would see that things couldn’t go on like this. But he hadn’t. And Tony had been too focused on getting his point across, that he hadn’t seen what had lay right before him.
, he thought, and only barely fought the urge to simply turn around and stalk out of the room.
Tony cleared his throat and settled back onto the sofa bed, turning his attention to the ceiling. Next to him, Sam was softly snoring, and everyone else was fast asleep, too.
SR 1:16 P.M.>Tomorrow’s New Year’s Eve. Party at your tower, remember?
“I think you’re lying about the Hot Cocoa President,” Cooper observed as he sipped from his mug.
came the highly amused reply. At least the tone of Tony’s teasing sounded the same via Extremis.
"Favunca!"
“We’re ready,” he agreed, raising his shield to indicate they were prepared to take on whatever might come out the cradle if need be. His overactive imagination kept going over what could happen, should they have to face yet another enemy instead of gaining reinforcement. He could easily see it destroying this world rather than saving it.
“I wish you could’ve said them goodbye,” Steve said. “And that Howard would’ve been a better father for you.”
Tony snorted, watching with a smile as Steve’s naked form all but
A long sigh hissed through Tony’s lips. True to his word, Steve had settled down in the stupid tent, as soon as they’d reached the campgrounds. And now, several minutes later, the lights were already out, with Steve very much not sleeping in the RV.
“Sure, ‘namesakes’,” Rhodes conceded, then leaned in to whisper into Ian’s ear: “Don’t listen to that guy. You know who you’re named after, right, little guy?”
“I am being nice. Right, dear?”
“So business as usual.”
Steve could remember the feeling well.
“Exactly. Either you leave with Hammer, stay at his side until he tires of you. Or…” Tony raised the mug to his lips again, his mouth tugging into an even wider, however mystifying grin. “Or you come home with me.”
“Steve?”
He glanced over his shoulder to find Vision standing there, eyes set on them with a sort of apathy that was at once eerie and soothing. "Uh…"
But even so, he had him. Tony shared his bed now—that would have to be enough.
.” No matter how much he’d trust Steve in the future, no matter if they had somehow become the bestest of best friends—there was absolutely no reason to give Steve access to
“Give him a break,” Natasha told Clint, eyes twinkling with mirth. “He’s happy ‘cause he got laid. Let him bask while he can.”
Standing back, Steve raised his hands in the air in a gesture of surrender. He could easily hear the anger and frustration in Tony’s voice, the hurt. Steve bit his lower lip and nodded his head to show he understood. Still, he stayed as close as Tony allowed him to be.
“Missed you,” Steve said as soon as he pulled back, brushing their noses together—the giant sap.
"Tony…" he whispered after a low moan. It was a bit of a struggle to keep from thrusting forward, but he managed. It wouldn't do to hurt Tony while he was being so good to him. "So…" He tried praising him, really, but the best word he could find was— "Good…"
“You seem tense,” Tony commented. “You alright?”
The girl didn’t care about Tony’s age, nor did she care about Tony basically just sitting there and staring into space for long minutes after Steve had stormed off.
That had the man blink and look back to him. “Nothing, sorry. Let’s do this.”
, I just… I think you’re missing a few steps there.”
, I’m sober.” He looked as if he was nearly going to weep at the thought. “Shit. What did you have to sober me up for? Now I’ve got to do it all over again.”
, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have put this on your shoulders, just like that.”
Steve shook his head. “I’m not doing this for you. I’m staying behind because my better half isn’t taking care of himself.”
Steve chuckled. “Our dream, you mean.”
“…not the same team,” Tony finished for him. “We’ll do what we can. I promise.”
Steve’s eyes went so wide it nearly was painful. Tony wanted—he really wanted to—
Steve had him in a firm grip, moving up and down relentlessly, and when Tony felt himself slipping, he clung to him with all he had, pressing a broken moan into his shoulder.
Steve rose to his knees and straddled Tony’s hips, then began to shove his pants down with impatient movements. When he had it off, he took a moment to simply watch. Tony’s body hadn’t lost any of the shiny newness Extremis had provided, but he could pinpoint the newer scars the Sokovia battle had left on him, and he knew they wouldn’t be fading any time soon.
They settled for a few minutes in companionable silence, with Bucky studying the mountains around them. Then, he cleared his throat. “So, have you seen Stark today?” Bucky asked. “Nat said he was pretty wasted. He probably doesn’t have a very pleasant morning.”
Tony groaned with irritation. It was no use. He needed to confront Steve about it. If he wanted to… whatever he wanted… Tony might as well find out about it now.
Steve had a mind to say something to that, but in the moment he walked up to where he’d seen Thor go, there was another air blast, effectively tackling Bucky and him to the ground. Steve had about a second to throw one of Klaue’s men through the air, before the boy with the white hair ran right into him again, punching him so hard that he flew to the other side of the room and into a stack of rifle crates.
Steve watched, with a great deal of confusion—but also with some dark foreboding—how Ultron’s red eyes slowly transformed into an oily black, and how a smug smile formed on his metal lips soon after.
Steve hummed, finding his smile again as he once more leaned in. “I think so, too.”
He walked closer and sniffed the air. There wasn’t much of a scent there, but something rang familiar. Inside the house, everything looked mostly as Steve had expected it to. Dusty shelves and walls, a musty smell. There was a stairway down into the cellar, and Steve could see footprints on the floor, clearly those of a man.
He could see the gears in Steve’s head turning. “In Sokovia,” he concluded, looking at Tony in question. “You arrived here the day before we went to Sokovia, didn’t you?”
Steve couldn’t remember ever having felt more hopeless in his entire life. Mister Hammer had just informed him that their time in Monte Carlo was over—and thus was his time with Tony.
“No,” Tony admitted. “Certainly not. But then I didn’t know how… life-changing… camping with you could be.” He huffed, at himself maybe, or at the whole metaphor. “Also, you know… we recently fought a warlord from outer space, we met a speaking tree, and a raccoon with an even bigger mouth than me. You’re…
“You’re just jealous,” Tony called after him, laughing when Bruce turned around and actually flipped him off.
considered Steve—seeing as how he’d been sure there was no chance in this world and the next that Steve could be thinking about him like that—he had always found him ridiculously attractive.
Not that Tony minded all that much.
She exhaled a long breath, and leaned forward, her elbows resting on her knees. “He was my mentor. He was… everyone’s mentor. At least to those who’d made it that far. He trained us—me, and the other girls—in combat training, mostly. He…” She took a deep breath. “He used to try to break us.”
Steve’s heart began to beat faster. Maybe he
The rest of the evening went by so smoothly Tony often found himself wondering if he should pinch himself in the arm and see if he was still lying in his bed, dreaming that all of this was happening.
Before he could fully comprehend how they’d gotten here, he was already stretching Tony, slicked fingers moving deep inside his body. They lay next to each other with Steve half on top of Tony, kissing along his neck and shoulder as he prepped him. And being so near him—it felt both surreal and strangely like reaching the end of a long and lonesome road. Tony was panting and muttering all kinds of words as he rocked back into the sensation and Steve was utterly entranced by the sight of him—spread out and debauched for his eyes only.

about it all the time. And no matter how much Steve ignored his advances, it just didn't seem to deter Tony at all.
“When we get home,” Steve started with a low voice. “What happens then?”
SR 3:07 A.M.>I was awake. Thinking about you. And that night. Just thinking about it gets me hot
Tony gave off a robotic huff, as soon as the faceplate shut down, and grabbed Clint around the waist. Together they sped to the stretch of rock wall, and side by side, Steve and Natasha began to climb. Once more, Steve inwardly patted his own shoulder that he always nagged all of them for sparring sessions. Their bodies were accustomed to exertion—and along with the missions, they’d never been short on action. The climb wasn’t much of a problem. Finding footholds, hands grappling for a nook to fortify, and sure enough, Natasha reached the ground a couple of seconds before him. He wasn’t surprised. Even with the serum, he couldn’t hold a candle to her when it came to agility.
"Tony," he said, forcing as much of his own worry out of his tone as he could. "You need to breathe through it. Can you do that for me?"
“Fair enough,” he said.
Steve shook his head. “I know, but—”
He’d never gotten to fully embrace the love he’d felt for Tony. Had never even acknowledged Tony’s own declaration, though he had known how hard it had been for him to admit it to himself. If Steve closed his eyes, he could still feel it. How Tony had been cuddled against his back, breathing gently into his skin. Every few minutes his mouth would dip to explore Steve’s neck or his chest or whatever he was hungry for, whispering adorations against his skin.
Bucky jumped to his feet, and without much ceremony, he ripped the robot’s head off with his metal hand. Looking around, Steve finally spotted Ultron himself inside the SUV. He was busy hammering on some console next to the cradle as two more of his minions tried moving it out of the truck.
Steve chuckled, shaking his head. “You’re crazy.”
“Condom and lube will be your best friends if you wanna have sex in this century,” Tony said. “Sorry, that’s not exactly good pillow talk, but did anyone update you on STDs?”
After that, they had dinner at some Barbeque restaurant, before walking to the Country Music Hall of Fame. The building housed all sorts of exhibits, the Hall of Fame itself, and, of course, another gift shop.
Tony exhaled a shaky breath himself. His hands rose, and after a moment of contemplation, he reached for Steve’s. “You can tell me anything,” he said, trying not to show how fast his heart was beating. “You just said it yourself. We trust each other.”
Ian was all but hanging in Steve’s arms, his arms flailing wildly as he giggled with every step Steve took. His teething pains seemed forgotten momentarily, pure unadulterated joy buzzing through his tiny limbs.
Yeah. A plan.
“Sokovia,” Steve filled in, his voice soft.
But Steve wasn't listening to what Bucky was saying. He was busy watching as the lady patted Tony and how his hands rested easily on her back. She was definitely too old for Tony.
tighten around Steve, snuggling even closer. “I do love it. Secretly. It must never know.”
you? He’s like your son! How can you do that to him?”
it,” Tony said, not quite angered, but Steve could hear the sharp undertone in his voice—the frustration. “Sokovia was on me, Steve. Lagos on Wanda. There’s no need to beat around the bush. And you
“Tony!” He walked up to them, thumping Tony on the back. “M’boy, didn’t expect you here so early after your little birthday party.”
Steve opened his mouth, but no words were forthcoming. On a second thought, Tony made to crawl into the hospital bed, and cautiously laid his head on Steve’s chest. Steve shifted a bit, stroking Tony’s hair and kissing his forehead a few times. “Thank you,” he said eventually, his voice very soft.
It was—by any means—the
He wanted nothing more than to go upstairs and curl himself up in Steve’s embrace, but there were things to do, and they couldn’t wait. Better to get it done with now. Maria expected his confirmation that Barnes was on board with the whole thing like yesterday. While he walked, Tony logged into the inbox of his cell phone via Extremis and groaned when it flashed ‘You have six messages’ at him. No doubt every last one was from some congressman. Giving in to the unavoidable, Tony hit play, closed his eyes and listened while several people ranted at him.
Tony typed.
Just as Tony had hoped, Steve gasped from where he was kneeling above him, thrusting his hips into Tony’s.
“Ready?” Steve asked and kneeled down.
* * *
“Bucky talked to me.”
“You are strong.” He landed a solid backhand on him. Batroc went flying. “I’m stronger.”
Without hesitation, she undid the buttons of his trousers, and there was nothing romantic about the fierce coupling that followed. He only pressed her against the wall and took what she offered.
In the weeks after they met at Bruce's lab, Steve suddenly spotted Tony all over the campus. The guy seemed to be everywhere. For one, the setup of Bruce’s new lab equipment had taken longer than one session, but even outside of the science division, Steve now saw Tony almost every day.
Tony was silent for a long moment—pensive, then his eyes drifted back to Steve’s. “You think I’m turning you down?” He shook his head, confused. “Don’t know if you noticed, but high school’s over, Steve. This is the end of a part of our lives, and the start of another. Who would… try to start something new when it’s already the end of it?”
But then there was the warmth of a gentle and reassuring kiss at Steve’s temple, another against his forehead and a pair of the deepest, loveliest, most wonderfully familiar brown eyes looking ever-earnestly into his own, reading Steve like a book. As always.
“Please… ‘m close,” Tony whined, eventually overcome with the need for release. He shoved both feet against Steve’s ass, his knees drawn up as far as they would go, pressing Steve harder against him on each thrust. He gave his own movements more momentum, slapping his hips against each downward stroke, and groaning whenever Steve hit his sweet spot.
“Bucky still down in the shop with him?”
Hated? Hated
to walk away. As soon as possible.
“Steve?” a voice asked tentatively.
“Want me to retire so badly, Romanoff?” Steve asked with a smile.
Steve nodded slowly. “And her husband? Is he working for your company as well?”
Waiting patiently by Tony's workstation, Steve stood, a little unsure what he could touch, so he went with 'nothing', for the time being. And when Tony exited the bathroom, he smiled at him.
,” Tony echoed, disbelieving. “He doesn’t even
Steve shook his head, and took off after Tony. Luckily, the kid was still wobbly on his feet, which meant he couldn't get far very fast. Once he reached him, Steve leaned down and sweeped him up, one arm secure under his knees and the other under his back. Tony might hate him for this, but at least he'd be in one whole piece by the time he sobered up. "Come on," he said, tone level. "It's bedtime."
“No,” Tony blurted, pushing himself off of his chair.
By all means, Steve was used to Rhodes and Pepper distrusting him. They had their reasons and that had been fine—until now.
Tony raised a brow. “You over Pegs? Sharon?”
“You said it’d be okay if I asked Carol to join us,” Rhodey pointed out, crossing his bulky arms over his chest. He was staring intently at Tony from his seat in the football stadium.
“What,” Tony blurted.
“But you don’t want me anymore…” Steve said, and pressed his eyes closed.
“Well, if
Tony’s grin dimmed at that. He raised himself to his elbows, looking down at Steve, and his wings once more cocooned them in their softness. “Forever,” he whispered and Steve felt his heart skip a beat as he nodded.
It was an outdated model, but clearly pimped somehow. He hadn’t taken a closer look at it so far, but it seemed sturdy, impact resistant, and if he had to take a wild guess, he’d say there was probably a GPS jammer in there.
“Happy?” Steve asked softly. He looked gloriously bedded, his blond hair a complete mess, his lips distinctively kiss-swollen.
Steve stared at Peggy’s photograph and tried to think of all the different expressions he’d once seen on her beautiful face. The determination, the fury, the gentleness, the devotion, the red-lipped smiles. He wanted to find consolation in that, but it wasn’t easy.
“I’d love to,” Steve replied honestly and a genuine smile stretched his lips. Perhaps today had changed things. He didn’t know, and he wasn’t about to gamble that his concerns—his worries and his jealousy over a woman whose home was now a tomb—were now issues of the past. But there was a sense of accomplishment that came with standing in Tony’s most private place he could not deny.
Tony continued to glare at him, but he started undoing his pants. “Oh, just shut up.”
, which was a small miracle in and of itself. Steve was so full of happiness he thought he might burst. He pressed his forehead to Tony's and closed his eyes, breathing slowly.
With that, Tony’s expression changed. Steve could almost see the determination forming behind his eye-lids. “Alright. If you… if you want it, I’ll talk with Pepper, first thing in the morning. We’ll find a way.”
Tony startled a little as he looked up and spotted Vision standing in front of the ceiling-high windows. For a moment, he thought about berating him of not making his presence known, but then again… JARVIS had always simply been there, too.
“Hey, man,” Steve said in a manner that was entirely too casual for anything he could begin to relate to present circumstances. He pursed his lips and looked up at Sam with an apologetic expression. “I know this is, uhm, a lot to take in, but… we need a place to lay low for a few hours.”
And that was a dead-on, if the little twitch in Tony’s face was any indication.
Heedless of how Tony might've wanted to come across, he just seemed… vulnerable. Worried, probably, that Steve might be upset about this. He wasn't—not really. Steve pressed down a little against him, rubbing their bodies together, as if to show that he was still interested and that it was okay. He leaned down to kiss him again, a light touch of lips. "Good," he said, nuzzling his cheek. "So you know how you want to do this." It wasn't a question for now, but Steve figured he'd put it out there for Tony to chew on and come to a conclusion by the time it became relevant.
“Well… Natasha’s here with me, and she said that Tony showed up at the penthouse. He threw Bucky and Sam out. And Nat, too. She said he seemed pretty shaken and I’m… worried.”
“Nuh-uh,” Tony mumbled against Steve’s lips, while pointing a finger at Bruce. “Keep rubbing, Big Green. You owe me like… eighty million dollar for Wakanda alone.”
Hell, he’d once shoved his tongue right into Tony’s mouth in the middle of an interview when some tea party bigot had declared how disgusting he found Captain America’s ‘fairy relationship’ and how he, a symbol of American masculinity, was a disgrace to the whole country. Tony probably would’ve punched him in the face for that if he hadn’t been so busy getting groped on national television.
Steve frowned. “I’m not worrying, I—”
He wished he could be in there and just
“Oh I
Banner took his glasses off his nose and looked down at some sort of chart. “Mmm,” he hummed, furrowing his brows.
"I've, uh…" Steve gestured towards the bedside table. "I didn't know when we'd meet, but I wanted to be prepared so…" He'd gotten lube, and even condoms, in case Tony preferred to avoid the mess after all.
Aside for the mass media and the thunderstorm of names they were called, there were about three hundred emails in his inbox, most of them from the military, as far as he could see, and many more from senators and other representatives of the government.
Tony flipped him off, rolling his eyes when Clint blew him a kiss in return.
“Says you,” Steve said, grinning against Tony’s lips. “Come on, we’ve waited long enough for this.”
Steve didn’t look too fazed by that. “We were aware of that, trust me. And yet, it happened. We hadn’t planned for it, it just happened. And we didn’t regret it once.”
It was dark outside, only the moon cast a soft light down on him. Once he’d heard the door to his room opening, he spotted Steve’s silhouette behind the windows and Tony’s breath caught a little when he lingered on his profile. He really was beautiful. How had he never admitted to himself how beautiful Steve was?
Bruce smiled back in that kind way of his, leaning back against the wall. “True. But for what it’s worth, I really think we’re doing the right thing.”
Tony raised his soda glass, reveling in the wide smile manifesting itself on Steve’s face, as he leaned in over his shoulder. “To a little less complicated times,” he whispered into Tony’s ear, kissing his cheek before pulling back and sipping his beer. Tony glanced at the bottle’s label and smiled to himself. It was nonalcoholic.
So yes, Steve was a bit ashamed that, when he walked into the workshop, and saw Tony bent over some small machine standing on top of a waist-high pedestal, his first thought was very much centered on their sex-life.
Natasha nodded, eyes strangely sullen. There was more to this. That much was clear. For once, Natasha’s demeanor couldn’t be any more obvious. Her expression reminded him of the looks that had always colored the expression of homecoming soldiers. Natasha was coming home from a war still embedded in her mind. It was subtle enough to remain disregarded, but there for those who looked.
Those days seemed so long ago now, nothing but a distant memory. Nowadays, his responsibilities never ceased, and it seemed the obstacles thrown their way were getting larger every time.
It didn’t make sense how much energy he poured into outsmarting her. She wasn’t his target. His target was the scientist, some famous nuclear engineer, and he’d followed him all the way from Tehran to Odessa. Thanks to her, it had taken him five whole days of observation before the scientist finally did something unexpected by wanting to drive across the city in his cabriolet.
Tony slumped back against Steve and cast him a pointed eyeroll. “Fine, party pooper,” he said, waving at the stairway next to them. “Second floor, 22 D. And the guy there isn’t my boyfriend, just so you know.”
awesome idea!”
“The stupid Secretary is only sending four?” Tony asked Ian as he walked further into the room. “I think I’m insulted.”
, but he knew that’d lead them nowhere.
Sam shrugged a little. “He was you.”
TS 6:55 P.M.>BTW I’m thinking Marea isn’t meant to be. How about that café by the tower? I know you know which one, Picasso
Bucky leaned sideways and his eyes moved across extravagant interior of the living room, as if he only just realized how high-quality everything around here was. “But it sure doesn’t hurt, huh?” he asked with a real grin. “All the things we wanted back then… all the things we always dreamed about… You’ve got them here. You have Stark, and I never thought that Nat would—” He trailed off, looking oddly bashful all of a sudden. And completely unable to go on.
“I would never hate you.”
“Go get ‘em,” Nat said, sounding proud of him in a way Steve could hardly understand.
They wandered the dark streets in silence. The girl seemed disinterested in him and in her surroundings. She seemed to have retreated inward, and the only telltale sign that she was agitated at all were her hands ever so often drawing into fists next to her thighs.
Steve nodded, expecting nothing less, and a dry smile spread across his face. “Back at ya, jerk.”
at Tony like he was doing something wrong. They’d been stranded here for almost two months. What did he expect? Of course Tony wouldn’t stop
Steve pursed his lips and nodded. “Yeah,” he agreed. “I know.”
Steve took a breath and held it, trying to calm down his fraying nerves, before lining up and pressing forward. The answering gasp was more rewarding than Steve would willingly admit. He never stopped the motion inwards until they were pressed tightly together, at which point he took a long moment just to admire the alluring sight of them connected like this.
“The good kind,” Steve offered, and the light intake of breath from Tony’s side told him immediately that he got his meaning.
, that was forever ago. Wasn’t even really true back then, not for a while. And it wouldn’t matter to me if you sucked at this, I mean… That’s the beauty of it, right?” He leaned back a bit, casting Steve a downright sinful grin. “We can try again… and again… and again…” The words were accompanied by more kisses, which had Steve’s knees going a bit weak. “This is supposed to be fun, not something you have to excel in.”
* * *
“Everybody well?” Tony asked his servants as he walked past them.
Tony smiled, pushing his damp hair back from his face. He leaned in to take a closer look at the hints of lines forming around his eyes and mouth. He touched a finger to the delicate skin under his eye.
be like them!”
“You’re the single most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen,” Steve said, willing Tony to believe him.
Natasha was throwing them glances from where she sat, and when she noticed Steve looking, she cast him a smile and nodded.
“He came by our apartment and asked me if I was allowed to play tag with him. He probably knew I didn’t go outside much and wanted to make sure he didn’t do anything wrong. I said yes, because Buck was the first one who’d ever asked me to play with him and not just consider me an invalid, so I didn’t tell him I was housebound. An hour later, I had the worst asthma attack of my life, and nearly suffocated to death. My dad gave Buck a mean beating and he didn’t speak to me for three weeks. I also lied to my ma about my chest pains and a dozen other symptoms on a daily basis, because I wanted to be normal, which always ended up making everything so much worse for her. I lied to about sixteen doctors to get into the army before I met Erskine, and I lied to Tony for over half a year when we met…”
And my best wasn’t good enough.
Steve smiled and moved to the side a bit so Tony could lie down next to him.
Taking a deep breath, Steve forced a smile to his lips. “Well, right now I’m going to take a shower, so…”
“I know.”
His heart felt as if it was going to stop out of pure, insupportable rapture and when he came back to himself he found Tony completely limp beneath him, still panting into the curve of his shoulder.
Why would Stane torment him like this? Show him Tony’s love letters? Was he really that petty? The letters had obviously been placed here, daring Steve to open them and read whatever Tony had written to his beloved wife.
Fury cast a wary gaze to the soaked bandages on Tony’s body, worry lines creasing his face. “Will the virus take care of that?” he asked.
Steve chuckled and kneeled in front of him.
Tony snorted, then laughed; he just couldn’t help himself. Usually, Steve was able to hold back his release as long as he wanted. He always, stubbornly, made sure Tony came first, without—seemingly—any strain whatsoever.
Tony sighed, thinking about Steve. Still sleeping peacefully. Still blessedly unaware of what was to come. “I have to tell Steve, prepare him for this. I waited too long as it is.”
Steve opened his mouth and shut it again a moment later. Tony was right. He wasn’t okay. “Did you call the Maria Stark Founda—”
And then everything was quiet. He didn’t hear Ross yelling commands anymore, didn’t hear his team talk, didn’t hear anything. The comm was down.
The line went dead after that, and Tony walked to his chair, picking up his suit jacket and slipping back into it. He adjusted his tie and took a glance into one of the blackened monitors in front of him.
The pitch of Steve’s moans rose and fell with every jerk of Tony’s hips, and Tony didn’t know how much longer he was going to last at that pace. He couldn’t remember ever having fucked someone this hard, and Steve loved every second of it. His upper body was slumped forward in perfect submission, his forehead pressed into the armrest. Tony watched intently as he was panting, digging his fingers into the cushion so hard his knuckles turned white.
Steve rushed over to him, putting a hand on his face. “Please, sweetheart,” he said. “We can find another way to…”
* * 4/28/18, 3:49 PM * *
And he had Tony's arms around him.
Steve rolled his eyes. “What’d I just say?”
“You once said you’d never sleep with me,” Tony said, smiling as he kissed along Steve’s neck. “When Hell freezes over, if I remember correctly.”
“Bad?” Tony shrieked. “You’re really gonna go with ‘it’s not that bad?’. One more inch and I could see your
He still didn’t think they could’ve done anything to stop the city from being destroyed. They had given their all, had tried to save everyone—had sacrificed so much. And at the end of the day, people had died, yes, but the earth was still there, and he hoped the people would see the odds and ends, once the anger had died down a little.
* * *
“I, uh, I need a bit more time,” Steve murmured after a moment. “And yeah, I know I’m not giving you the clearest indicators of needing time, right now, but I do. I… this is all so new.”
Tony moaned at that, rutting against Steve’s thigh as he stared down at him. “You’re so hard,” Tony said exultantly. “You’re so hard for me.”
Sam chuckled. "You're a terrible liar, Steve. Don't ever try to do that for a living," he jabbed, elbowing him lightly, but he didn't say anything further, despite Steve suspicion that the guy knew exactly why he hadn't said anything.
“You kissed me,” Tony pointed out, a bit dazed.
“You don’t have to. I know. Just like you’ll always know that I love you, too.”
“Come on, it’s just you and me. You know you can tell me everything.”
God, if he got any harder, his pants would melt right off. “Oh heck…”
was difficult enough, but planning a war, forming a new team, discussing tactics—it really took every ounce of concentration.
“I trust you,” Tony said, frowning at their entwined hands. “Of course it needs to be you. You’re still my…” Husband. Lover. Partner. Best friend. Soulmate. There were all these words for Steve, and none of them could hope to describe what Tony felt when he looked in those beautiful blue eyes. “You’re the most important person in my life. I know you’re angry, but… it should be you. Please. You just need to be in hearing range for audio input, saying one thing after the other, effect will be immediate. And then just, I don’t know… get me somewhere secluded so I can recover.”
“Много времени прошло,” she said, suddenly right in front of him.
Steve stared at him—and the elevator had long stopped, the doors opening, but he didn’t move one bit. Instead, he pulled his hand from Tony’s and held his face in both hands. “You’re worth it, too. I’m so glad you believed in us enough to do all of this again. I know it couldn’t have been easy for you.”
Tony dropped back on the bed, scowling at the little snort from Steve before he vanished behind the bathroom door.
Tony, for his part, was alone in Clint’s barn. He stood in the shadows, silently tinkering with the old tractor, fixing something for a change while he waited for the go to fly off. He reached into the lapels of his jacket in habitual search for his favorite red screwdriver, then leaned down and loosened the screws of the engine hood. The dark green tractor was an antique, and usually, he enjoyed working on old machines, but today, his heart wasn’t in it.
It had seemed so easy at the time, and now…
Stane regarded him for a brief moment, and Steve could pinpoint the exact moment the guy realized he may have been underestimating him. Too late. "I mean exactly what you think I mean, Mr. Rogers. I will not tolerate a
It was time then. He would get Steve out of there, and then they could deal with the aftermath. No matter what it took. No matter the cost.
“Delete all,” Tony ordered into his phone’s speakers. At Natasha’s questioning brow, he shrugged. “Wouldn’t want this in the wrong hands, would we?”
Steve huffed, giving him a crooked and entirely forced smile. The vulnerability in his expression would have floored Tony were he not already sitting. “It might be nothing. It’s just been a long day,” Steve said, and then his free hand landed on Tony’s knee, squeezing lightly. His other hand slid up Tony’s arms, fingers threading through his hair. “And I don’t really want to think about this right now…”
Steve took Tony’s hand and began tugging him towards the door. “Come on, dad. They know how to make Ian’s milk and the night’s not getting any younger.”
He tried for a smile, a thumb tracing Steve’s fingers from where the guy still held his hands up and far away from himself. “Come on, Steve,” Tony pleaded. “Plausible deniability. Here, repeat after me: ‘I really thought he was older’.”
And then, he stood awkwardly outside Tony’s room, hesitating.
Tony didn’t know how late it was. These days, he worked without realizing an hour had passed. He and Bruce had been in medical for a while, he knew, but the approximation on time was lost to him.
“Copy,” Clint intoned.
“Doesn’t matter,” Tony mumbled. “I’m used to not getting what I want.”
“But—”
The two had similarly rebellious expressions on their faces as the others trooped up the stairs. Even Hulk was giving him a grateful look.
Steve rubbed a hand over his face. “Can anyone
The words warmed Steve at first, but as soon as they settled in his head, he felt himself freeze. He pulled his hands back slightly, and stared at Tony’s face. “I never told you about Bucky.”
After all, Tony wouldn’t have any chance to slowly get used to the idea, to maybe develop those feelings in his own time. He would feel forced, and if there was one thing that would drive Tony Stark away, it was being pushed into a situation he didn’t want to be in.
Besides, the gap between them really wasn't that inconsequential, especially since Tony was underage.
you.”
“We both did.”
“I…” Tony said then, clearing his throat a little awkwardly. “I don’t think I can take you again tonight, I mean
“Let me go!” he grunted, pushing back so hard that he and Steve both tumbled off the bed and against the wall behind them.
Steve’s jaw tightened as he squared his shoulders. “Tony…”
The man in front of Steve stood with a grin and loose-limbed elegance; only his sharp eyes belied the casual pose. He was clearly anticipating Steve’s next move, but eventually, it seemed he could not wait any longer.
“Out like a light, sir.”
Steve eyed the Stones. “Then scatter them,” he said. “Send them through time and space, so no one can find them anymore. Not all of them—never again.”
Steve straightened, his hands clenching into fists. Of course Fury would think that the Avengers—especially Natasha and Clint—were still under his jurisdiction first and foremost, despite the fact that they hadn’t been his employees for over a year by now. The Avengers were self-funded and only working for SHIELD on a contractual basis. And with Steve as the team’s leader, Fury had agreed to run every single command through him.
“And the bots he built?”
There really is nothing that could go wrong with a simple walk.
“Sorry,” he hiccupped. “Sorry, just—
Tony sighed and rubbed a hand across his eyes. He really hoped Steve was right and they were able to get evacuation well underway before they had to face Ultron. The alternative was something he really didn’t want to think about.
Ross’s stance tightened. “Well, we obviously can’t clear him, Miss Romanov. The hearings confirmed evidence for twenty-three murders in the last fifty years alone. And both Mr. Stark and Dr. Cho could not confirm that the implants are effectively deactivated. He is still a threat and he must be treated as such.”
So he might as well give into it when Tony offered.
dream.”
“Make it two,” Maria said. “And look at your mails, for god’s sake. We’ll offer the Committee to make Barnes a member of the Avengers. If he’s under your roof, with your network of top lawyers at his back, he might actually have a shot.”
the punch to the chest. He hadn't told Bucky about any of this. He only saw him a handful of times after what had happened, and then he couldn't bear it and found excuses to leave, to stay far away. So of course Bucky wouldn't know.
Steve lowered his sketchpad to the ground, suddenly unable to hold its weight any longer. It was… it was a horrible thought. That Tony might be permanently broken with no way to fix him.
There was a moment of silence. The wind had finally died down until it was barely perceptible, but rain began to swirl down out of the dark sky. Most of the guests were gone now; there were still Bucky and Natasha standing together by the edge of the cemetery. A few former SHIELD agents, who may or may not be still working for Phil were also standing not far off.
came to mind, but Tony angled his face just so, fingertips digging into Steve’s skin, and then Steve didn’t think much anymore.
Before Steve knew what was happening, he was unbuttoning Tony’s jeans and Tony was unbuttoning his. Steve’s shoes were already gone, he didn’t know when. Tony’s thumbs hooked into his jeans on either side and he pulled. Jeans and his briefs both came off in one smooth movement, then Tony moved away for a moment to shove his own jeans down and kick them off.
Barnes favored him with a weary glance, before turning his eyes to the contract with undisguised confusion. “Nat signed the same thing?”
“You’re a wartime-hero, Captain,” Coulson said. “One of the biggest in living memory. The world might be very different, but this country still remembers its heroes.”
“Take it off,” Tony said, and the words were out of his mouth before he could really think them through. When his brain caught up, his eyes flickered to the ceiling where the cameras were directed at them.
Tony smiled as he looked up to him, patting the empty space on the mattress, inviting Steve to join him. “I know. It’s so 2013,” he joked weakly and motioned for Steve’s hand as soon as he was in reach. Tony put the tablet aside and entwined their fingers. Tentatively, he pulled Steve down. The second he reclined, Steve found himself with an armful of Tony. The earthy scent of his hair tickled his nostrils, the steady drum of his heart beat soundly against Steve’s chest, the warmth of his skin enveloped him, and Steve felt as close to peace as he had since the night Ultron had stepped into their living room.
Damn it.
“Oh, come on,” Bucky said, his tone serious. “Nat told me you have this whole guilt-tripping thing going for you lately. You need to stop that. What happened to me wasn’t your fault, and you know it.”
TS 6:42 P.M.>Good
They would overcome whatever the future held in store for them, and at the end of every day, they had all they needed in each other. There was still so much to do, so many promises to keep, and Steve would see them kept. They would together.
Tony chuckled. “Bet he loved that.”
Wanda didn’t answer with words, but her small smile said it all. She was right, Steve figured, there was a lot that everyone had to be thankful for on this day.
Steve cleared his throat, his mind snapping back to itself. “I’m ready,” he said. “Gonna be down in five.”
“All right, all right…”
“Otherwise what?” Steve inquired.
“Not really. We won’t take any risks,” Tony hurried to say. “There’s no chance this can go wrong. I promise.”
“We do this together,” she said. “You don’t have to go through this alone.”
that, and yet…
Tony looked… He looked awful. It looked like he was ready to collapse right in front of him, or maybe tear down the whole establishment. So much anger and hurt and… disappointment. Steve wasn't sure how to even address it.
There was a short pause. “I look like shit.”
Desperate, Steve reached into his utility belt and pulled out Tony’s small screwdriver. The one with the Hotrod-red handle he had carried around with him ever since he and Tony had met. With a kiss to the handle, he pressed it into Tony’s hand. “I’ll come back,” he promised. “And we’ll fix this.”
There was a long pause. Agonizing minutes of complete quiet. Tony’s eyes were now seemingly fixed on nothing, and when he started talking, Steve knew his thoughts were very far away. “You know, for a moment… I thought we could make it,” he whispered. “You and I. I thought it would work out. And I even thought… coming back here wouldn’t change anything. That this place held no power over me anymore. I was a fool. And now it’s too late. I destroyed what little chance of happiness we had.”
He was only human, after all.
“And anyone with resolve enough to tolerate the incessant blabbering of Justin Fucking Hammer is my sort of man,” Tony said, grinning proudly. “God, that guy was a lunatic.”
Steve certainly was the most bossy bottom Tony had ever slept with and… God, he loved every second of it.
His brothers and sisters.
Tony pulled the goggles from his head. He was silent for a beat longer, but eventually, he spoke up. Future or past—it seemed Tony was always bad with silences. “You alright?”
Somewhere between those kisses, Tony’s scarred red face had vanished. Instead, those beautiful, giant wings had decided to make an appearance again. Steve knew, because they had wrapped themselves around them both, keeping them locked together.
Before Tony could even begin to form a reply, they were interrupted.
Steve tilted his head at Natasha. It took him two or three tries before he was able to talk, and when he did, his voice sounded weak and ineffectual. “You’re sure it’s him?”
Steve froze. That seemed absolutely impossible. “He said that?”
“Okay,” Bucky said slowly, caressing his temples. “Lemme get this straight. We have how many beds?”
He wondered.
Tony swallowed, and exhaled a shaky breath, glancing at Steve with a little more color on his face. “Everything you hear these days is a throwback to a bygone era, no matter how much they try to spice it up and call it ‘modern.’ It’s all been done before. At least the bands I listen to were innovative.”
Gently, Steve let his hands wander down Tony’s arms, and Tony felt his own body shudder beneath his fingertips.
“That’s good,” Bruce said with a smile. “So you remember Thanos.”
“They got out,” she whispered close to his ear, and with those words, she ushered him inside. She turned on the television, the volume turned off, and her expression was very grave. “FRIDAY got a satellite feed. Look.”
Tony was… the perfect gentleman.
Tony’s fingers clenched into a fist, before he placed them, very carefully, on Steve’s shoulder. “Believe me, there’s nothing you have to apologize for. It’s a decision I made, alright? And you’re here, so it was all worth it.”
The guy had bolted out of the room in the blink of an eye. And now Tony was alone in his confusion, and he had decided that hate was the only reasonable way to go, here.
“Right,” Steve agreed and resumed his strokes in even motions. “No talking kids in bed.”
Still nothing. Rule or not, he
"Bucky?" he asked as he approached the step. Bucky smiled at him, but it was an unstable kind of smile, the kind that was a little lopsided, and didn't reach his eyes. Bucky didn't look like he was doing well at all. His hair was longer than Steve remembered, he had deep, dark circles around his eyes and wasn't properly shaved.
“I’m not,” Steve said with a soft tone. “We have to stop the launch. This simply is our best bet.”
So what then? Steve had no answers.
“Steve?” Tony said for the fourth time within the last minute, and his tone was getting more and more urgent. What was going on? One moment, Steve had opened his mouth to say something, and the next, he’d frozen on the spot. He’d stared into the distance, eyes wide, shaky breaths leaving his mouth.
It was a measure of how tired they both were when their only response was a series of grunts.
“Who are you,” he said, not even phrasing it as a question. His voice had dropped in a manner that made Steve wish he’d brought his shield upstairs.
“You know, I read those SSR files,” Fury said. “‘Greatest generation?’ You guys did some nasty stuff.”
Almost expecting Tony to breach him like this, Steve braced himself for the pain—but it never came. Instead, Tony leaned up to kiss him hungrily, sucking and nipping at his panting mouth.
Tony gently brushed hair away from Steve’s face. “I am.”
He tried keeping himself upright after, but it was proving difficult and entirely impossible once Tony pulled at his shoulders. He dropped down on Tony’s chest, breathing him in as he brushed his fingers across the sweaty skin.
Natasha brushed a gentle hand across his forehead. “That someone else will always be there. Trying to ignore it only makes the paranoia worse.”
what’s at stake, Stark,” Ross began, his voice exhausted. “We know he’s your husband. We know you want to be informed, but I don’t have any information yet, either. We just know that Rogers, and Barnes, and Wilson, and apparently King T’Challa from Wakanda broke off a car chase, injuring about twenty policemen, six of them badly, and a few dozen more people on the streets.”
“That’s stupid, Tony. You’re just setting up barriers for yourself to keep you from being happy. But you don’t have anything holding you back. Just yourself.”
. No matter what Zemo had done, he was
Steve bit his tongue at that comment. He wasn't sure Tony'd be happy knowing Bucky'd read his letter, but now it was out there and he had to brace for whatever reaction that would cause.
Tony scoffed. “The Eye.”
“So I gathered.” Tony swallowed, taking a deep breath. “But… how?”
“That’s great, Tony. I’m so proud of you.”
that happened while you were frozen, right?”
been married for quite some time, after all. They turned on the same note, falling into a quick stride toward the hangar—Steve running, Tony pretending to chase him and Bucky hot on their heels.
“Oh. Right,” Tony agreed, and, well, there went his brain-to-mouth-filter. Great. “’s… wha’ssat about? You… don’t lie t’me. Not tha’ I’d know if you did, ‘cause I never fuckin’ do, but… don’t. You ‘rly loved tha’ guy?”
Tony murmured something in return, but didn’t wake. His heart rate slowed down, his breaths evening out, and deep inside Steve’s mind, a decision was forming.
“I don’t know,” Steve said, still worried. “I mean, we were down in your shop, talking about the mission tomorrow and you just… collapsed. I wasn’t fast enough and you hit your head on the floor pretty badly. Are you okay?”
Steve sipped from the beer, and glanced at the armor. As always, it looked magnificent. He could never really get over how amazing it was that Tony could create such wonders with his own two hands. True genius had always impressed him, even when he and Tony hadn’t gotten along in the beginning.
That seemed to confuse Steve, if the frown on his face was any indication.
He looked down at his baby boy, who might or might not have made a vague motion with his left arm that might or might not be pointing towards the Spider-Man rompers.
okay with it, even.
No way he would actually get
And just like that, Steve was in control again. In a flash, his insecurity vanished and self-assuredness poured off his body in waves so powerful Tony was amazed he hadn’t yet drowned in it.
It felt good for the first few seconds; watching the pain on Steve’s face as he twisted the knife to see how much he could make him bleed. Anger was easy. He knew Steve’s anger now. And if he was honest with himself, the pain that followed extended to the very beginning of their relationship.
“You like that, Captain?” Tony purred. “To know how hard I am for you?”
Rhodes checked his watch. “About two point five hours ‘til total eclipse, but the moon will start darkening the sun in about one.”
It was amazing how the world had changed in only four short years. Or was it just Tony’s workshop? There were so many things Steve didn’t recognize—the displays alone looked nothing like he had seen in 2018.
What could have been if they’d taken that one step further before everything had fallen apart.
Steve set into motion, and Tony forced his suit into the air to meet Steve in the middle, wondering what he was thinking of in that moment.
God, Tony was afraid. So afraid to lose this, while knowing exactly that they didn’t have really have another option. Steve would be
"So," he said, climbing back onto the bed and advancing towards Tony again. "What's it gonna be?"
“No, I haven’t,” Tony whispered, then cleared his throat. “People die. We try to prevent it, but in the grand scheme of things, we all know it’ll keep on happening.”
Now, though, the man in front of him was as temptingly perfect as Steve could’ve ever imagined. And the more time passed, the more he yearned to keep him for always.
Bucky released a huff, clearly trying not to laugh. “If it’d been the latter, he would’ve already excused himself because he needed to ‘research’ something.”
Steve felt a great deal of trepidation as he walked through the basement of the U-GIN Genetic Research Facility. Every attempt at contacting Helen Cho on their way to Seoul had failed, confirming Bruce’s suspicions that Ultron had somehow infiltrated the facility, and it had been a last minute decision of taking the sewer entrance instead of just stepping into the building.
Tony grinned and nodded. “Or not.”
. Something clicked then. A year ago, Ultron had still weighed heavily on their mind. The battle of Sokovia had still been raging all over the news channel, and they had flown over to East-Europe almost every other week to help with rebuilding.
This was not the Tony he wanted, he reminded himself. This was Tony he would not take advantage of just because he was a horny drunk.
Bruce shook his head. “Ross will have me, it’ll make him feel victorious, trust me.”
Natasha and Sam were already sitting in his room when Steve stepped out of his bathroom after taking a shower. He’d sort of expected their visit, he just wished they’d given him a bit more time to get settled in first.
Tony held up a hand, and Bucky felt both a sense of calm appreciation as well as terribly out of place.
“You gonna yell at me now or later?” Tony asked, trying to sound unbothered, when, in reality, his heart was beating a mile per minute.
“Priority upload from Vienna’s police,” Natasha explained. “Remember that when we decided to go to Peggy’s funeral, the UN called for a psychiatrist?”
Even so, it was Tony who spoke first. No matter what else, he was even worse with silence. “You ready?”
He was doing the math wrong.
Tony sighed. “It doesn’t make you anything. It wasn’t you. It was a skewed vision, and its whole purpose was to mess with you.”
“I’m not ashamed—Sophia’s hilarious,” Steve shot back, chuckling a bit when Natasha leaned her head on his shoulder, petting his head lovingly.
Steve’s only answer was a groan. But his body communicated plenty as he pressed his whole frame against Tony’s. Tony’s hands glided up his chest and underneath his shirt to slide it off him. As it puddled on the floor, Steve grabbed him around the waist to spin them both around. Tony winced and clutched his side.
“I’ll try my best,” Steve said, and made to turn around. Only then he remembered himself, and looked at Stephen Strange. “Thanks for getting us back.”
“Oh, I’m pretty sure you’ll recognize him!” Natasha called over and cast him a smug smile before she walked through the door.
“I’m physically fine,” Tony said. “I just… can’t stop. This is my life. I go and I go and I keep on going until I figure it out. I can’t even be the friend Rhodey needs right now because I’m too busy playing solo entertainer for the rest of the world. I can’t stop. Not until it’s over.”
-liked him.
The final piece of Steve chipped away. He dissolved in pain, and forcefully jerked himself awake the next second.
Yet, after everything that had happened in New York, after Fury had sent Coulson to help them with Aldrich Killian, no questions asked, he’d thought—foolishly, maybe—that things had changed. The Avengers weren’t part of SHIELD anymore,
He knew he should be focusing on Ian. He should be able to hold a conversation with his friends—with Pepper, and Natasha, and Maria, and Rhodey—who were, after all, doing their very best to mend fences, each on their own. Instead, he found his thoughts constantly returning to Steve. Whenever he walked past the framed photo of Tony’s birthday-party, with them sharing a kiss that was more laughter than anything else and cradling a newborn Ian in their arms, something in his chest tightened with yearning.
hated this part of Extremis. “What kind of algorithm?” he asked eventually.
It wasn’t completely unreasonable to be at least a bit nervous about this, but he wouldn’t let that deter him.
News. News had to be a good thing. News meant it was over. It was over. It was over. Relief swept over him. A tidal wave of pure, unadulterated relief.
“You’re perfect. Stay.”
“Pointless,” Strange said. “Thanos took the power of the Infinity Stones with him. The Gauntlet is still linked to his essence, but by now, he took all its power with him. The only one who’s able to stop all this is Thanos himself.”
to be his erection into the space between Steve’s thighs and gently ran his hands up and down Steve’s arms.
“Damn it,” Natasha suddenly exclaimed. She had her messenger open and typed with crazily fast fingers.
His hands pressed against Tony’s chest, and he smacked his lips while Tony put him down on the floor.
A wave of need shuddered through his body, and shock had him stand perfectly still as Steve pressed his lips against Tony’s. His hands shot out to grasp something solid, which happened to be Steve’s incredibly toned sides.
“No… I suppose you won’t,” Stane mused. In the corner of his eyes, Steve saw him reaching for something. His cane. He saw him twirling the orb again, pulling at it until something silver and sharp came into view.
“Bucky,” he said urgently, trying not to hurt him too much. “This isn’t you.”
It was all… pretty great, in Tony’s opinion. They were surprisingly good together, now that the drama had subsided a little and Steve wasn’t freaking out about the age thing, anymore. He'd even come to sort-of-like Barnes and his scary girlfriend-but-not-girlfriend. They were teasing both Steve and Tony about their relationship pretty much full-time, but with every joke, it seemed Steve eased up little more, and it didn’t take much for Tony to figure out that Barnes was doing that on purpose.
There was so much about that sentiment that did not sit well with him.
“No,” Steve ventured. He
“We?” Steve called after him. “But your presentation…”
“When you said I’m already affecting my own past, then you mean that…” Steve started, glancing at Strange with a worried look.
much older, and I’m… really into you, and…” Tony trailed off, trying to find the right thing to say, because if Steve rejected him right now, this would surely be it.
It was unfair. The more Tony tried to battle himself about this thing between them, the more pliant his will seemed to become.
He fell for what seemed an eternity. The chest beam died out, and Tony thought about Steve, hoping that he’d make it out on the other side. He thought about his team, hoping they’d be able to move on with their lives, if he didn’t make it.
, Tony. I just… Don’t take advantage of him just because he’s a nice guy, okay?”
“He was? Why?”
Natasha stood up, arms folded. She looked at Tony as if she was preparing for a fierce argument. “He was back to himself in under a minute.”
Just as he’d hoped, any thought of resistance seemed to promptly melt away. A hard gasp clawed through Tony’s throat, his back bowing. After that, every swipe of Steve’s tongue seemed to have him near jolting off the bed—which was exactly what Steve had wanted to achieve. For Tony to finally let go for once, let go of his million worries and regrets and fears, and just be with him—here, right in this moment.
“It’s worth a try,” Rhodey supplied. The prosthesis around his legs were giving off a slight whirring sound as he moved, and Tony vowed to fix that as soon as he got the chance.
“No, I—”
Steve snorted, but Tony knew he was smiling when he said, “I’m a hundred years old, remember?”
Steve smiled, and Tony huffed at the probably very eager way he reached for the bottle of oil standing next to their bed.
was the first thought going through Tony’s head and he took a long, dumbfound moment to just be grateful for once, because this time, he really thought he’d lost the man for good.
Steve straightened up, determination written all over his face. “He will.”
Steve gasped at the pain—at the pleasure—, he couldn’t even be sure, completely out of his mind with the feelings.
somehow wanted this, too.
The small smile that appeared at the corners of Natasha’s mouth told him that both of those assumptions were one hundred percent right.
Stane smiled, though it was tight at the corners of his mouth. “Very well.”
“Of course.” Steve blinked at him, and Tony might be wrong about this, but Steve almost looked a bit disappointed. “But that’s not all—is it?”
The next thing Bucky knew, Tony buried his face in Steve’s chest. “I really wanted to do this for you.” Tony pulled back reluctantly, shaking his head. “But I guess that was stupid. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”
noticing Steve or anything else since he was busy being a complete and utter nervous wreck.
“You’re the best,” he replied, stretching slightly. He really only cared for the taste, the caffeine didn’t do much for him unless he’d drink a couple of canisters—and even then, the effect didn’t last much longer than thirty-two minutes. Tony had counted.
His thumb settled over his hole and began caressing the little opening softly to counteract the growing fierceness of his thrusts. He pressed in, just the tiniest bit, and Tony went perfectly still in his arms.
With potent dread, Tony suddenly realized that there was still every chance that they’d come full circle. And even if they didn’t—back then, Wanda had saved Steve’s life in Lagos. Without her, a bomb would’ve detonated right next to Steve.
In any case, he had to hand it to the guy, Tony was one persistent nugget.
Natasha shrugged in an attempt at nonchalance. “I don’t know. I know what I would’ve expected from him before, but…” A sigh rumbled through her body. “I suppose that doesn’t matter anymore, does it?”
In a way, it amazed Tony that after everything he had seen in those last days, that he still managed to be captured by the propensity in which a situation could progress from bad to worse.
Tony was more than aware that it could all end when the blanket of night no longer covered them. There was no reason to hope this morning would hold any solutions to their situation.
When he’d known all along that he’d never even see the day the war would end.
“Sir, I apologize for the late intrusion. There’s a Sergeant James Barnes for you,” she explained, smiling apologetically. “Miss Potts told me to give him access to your private elevators. Will you receive him now, or should he come back during office hours?”
about?”
There was a beat of silence. “Thank you,” Tony whispered and kissed him shortly. He walked by the place where the holographic piano had been just moments ago, looking down on it.
“I set you up with a thousand dates, a thousand,” Bucky yelled. “And you never even cared to tell me I should be finding a fella for you? Are you kidding me?!”
He and Bucky both looked up. She had a sheet of paper in her hand, and hesitated a moment before she handed it to Steve.
The first thing that hit him was a punch from the now-tiny Ant-Guy. It felt as if it sliced all the way to Tony’s spine, both knocking the metaphoric wind out of his body and rendering him momentarily dazed, and therefore unprepared for the follow-up kick. Tony had to give the newbie kudos. He really knew how to make it hurt.
Pepper’s phone chirped, and after she had hummed a few times, listening to whoever it was on the other side, she turned her serious gaze back on Tony.
“Well… we won’t leave for another half hour, and I know you’re not here for the view.” She paused meaningfully as she glanced towards the dreary landscape in front of them. A small smile grazed her red lips, and for a brief moment, Steve thought they could’ve been happy together. “And you look kinda terrible. Is it Barnes?”
“Aw, come on,” Tony complained. He’d really looked forward to seeing Pepper again. It had been far too long. “Why did I make you the boss again? Repeat: ‘So I can make other people work for me’.”
And it felt—it felt as if it was working.
Steve’s mind was in a haze. Nothing Tony said made any sense.
“They do?” Tony asked, trying to mimic Steve’s casual tone and failing miserably. “What are the odds, I think with your CV you might be just right for the job, huh?”
He watched Steve and Bucky running towards the hangar. He shot a few repulsors after them for good measure, all of them missing by a few inches. His concentration faltered only as Wanda’s magic delivered him to the laws of gravity and he was thrown to the floor below.
“I…” Tony shook his head, then huffed. “Yeah, sure, Steve, but… wow, this got very serious very fast.”
* * *
, and suddenly, he had him in his
“Babe, it wasn’t your fault.”
Steve sighed, but nodded. He knew he could be overprotective when it came to his team, but this wasn’t the time. “What’s another mission, right?”
He kneeled above Steve, his fingers kneaded his sac delicately, as though any pressure would break him—which was ridiculous of course, he was
For half a second, Steve thought Bucky might make a break for the elevator. But then, suddenly, he let out a loud snort.
“Better get cleaned up,” he said softly, kissing Steve’s forehead again, then his cheek. When Steve reluctantly let go of him, Tony carefully rolled off and grabbed for the handkerchiefs. They cleaned themselves up, before Tony settled in at Steve’s side once again. His head rested on Steve’s shoulder, both arms and legs wrapped around each other.
“How?”
Tony hummed in agreement and, after some inner consideration, put a hand on Steve’s right shoulder. “True,” he said, cautiously smiling down at him. He was aware that they were standing on shaky grounds. Hell, Tony was basically jumping up and down on the thin ice of a frozen lake, daring it to break beneath his feet. And he knew there was every chance Steve would go and either laugh at him or give him another one of his ‘I can’t, it’s not right’ speeches.
It came from the front, a leap forward with one leg extended. His metal-shod foot caught Steve in the throat and sent him crashing to the floor. He rolled away a second before Rumlow’s fist struck, and it came down next to Steve with a force that made the ground rattle.
“This was a horrible idea,” Tony commented as soon as they rounded the first corner and he nearly died of a heart attack when a loud scream echoed across the large hallway.
[TStark] [chat_server:46953]
When Ultron raced towards him, Steve skipped to his feet, taking a running start to head butt him in the stomach. Flipping his shield, he swung it like a bat, and there was a grating sound, before Ultron’s body collapsed.
“You’ll

you. It was never about whether or not
The assurance obviously did not convince Steve, his hand still at his hip, a frown marring his brow as he looked up. “That’s gonna bruise. I held you too hard, I was—”
The little Parker, however, wasn’t having the same luck with Steve. They fought right in front of the hangar, with Peter trying very hard to keep Steve from reaching the Quinjet, and Steve obviously trying very hard not to hurt Peter and still get him to back off. When Parker scrambled back to his feet following a not-that-powerful kick from Steve, Tony made a quick decision.
“What is it?” Steve asked, and once more, Tony felt his hand on him, resting on his shoulder where his fingertips were ever so lightly brushing the skin at Tony’s neck.
At the very least, he owed that woman an explanation.
people, Steve, seven, if you count Wilson, and we’re not even sure he’s in it for the long run. Even if we step up and do more regular missions, we’ll never be able to cover what SHIELD did. This could get out of hand faster than you think.”
Bucky waved him off. “Really not our biggest problem.”
He looked at the dimly lit room he lived in. Everything was exactly as he'd left it when he went to bed. Everything was very still. He was in his apartment in Mass, and it was—he glanced at the digital clock across the room—four thirty in the morning.
Pressing his forehead against Steve’s, Tony looked straight into his blue eyes. “We have to avenge them. We still have to stop him. And I need you to help me do it.”
It didn’t matter.
“Tony. Stop. It’s different now.”
Immediately, Steve felt guilty for thinking that Tony had abandoned him. Instead, he started to worry.
“My indicators imply you are trying to be more forward, sir,” FRIDAY replied.
Steve snorted. “Are we talking about it now, or not?”
Taking his cue, Steve shrugged his shoulders in an attempt at nonchalance. “Got into a fight.”
The dreams were over. Tony was gone. And a terrible thought took hold in Steve’s head: What if Tony was dead? He’d only be in his forties now, but what if something had happened?
“You’re perfectly big, Detective,” Tony muttered, so low that Steve hardly heard him.
Determination.
All for him.
Love had saved them, had saved the world, and Tony knew in his heart that, despite what the Eye had once told him, their love was a weave that could never be undone again.
If Steve thought that Scott Lang was a good guy, Tony would hopefully call him a friend one day, too.
“Ian?” Steve asked, as he approached.
He wasn't exactly sure where Tony's room was, but the dorms were all located in one building, so he figured that would be his best bet. Hopefully, by the time they got there Tony would kindly tell him where his room was.
Bucky shrugged unapologetically. “Let’s not rule that possibility out.”
“I’m Steve,” he said lamely.
* * *
“—extraordinary.”
The second the words left the robot’s modulator, Steve took hold of Tony’s arm and dragged him behind the table, pushing it over and taking cover behind it. Tony could see half a dozen Iron Legion suits suddenly swarming the air above them, shooting at everything that moved.
“How long exactly?”
“We have to find out what all of this means,” Strange said, glancing at Bruce and Tony briefly. “Best case scenario: You’ll get back to your timeline with no immediate changes whatsoever, but having two sets of memories.”
“I think he’d want you there.”
But could anyone blame him? He felt more than just a little lightheaded. Tony moved against him as he spoke, rubbing what
Maria huffed a breath. “See? We already have a Plan B.”
“Goddammit,” he muttered once it got a bit too much. He stilled his movements as he tried to get himself back under control. He felt his whole self being centered to his middle, all the blood in his body going very much south, and he was
“I thought you don’t regret it,” Steve said.
Eventually, Steve looked down at the tasteful plaque embedded inside the gravestone. It read simply,
“Good seeing you, too,” Stark continued, his voice moving forward. “Missed me?”
Steve’s smile was infectious and Tony felt the remains of his anger drain, feeling the corners of his mouth lift almost against his will instead.
Catching up to Tony's meaning was a little difficult at first, but Steve got it well enough. He didn't want any more confrontations today, least of all when he had a lap-full of eager, horny Tony, promising things that made his erection strain ever harder against the confines of his clothes. "God…" he whispered and pulled Tony in for another kiss. He wanted it so much but… Would Tony really go through with it?
Steve quirked a grin. “You’ll get there one day.”
"JARVIS,"
This was where Tony had grown up, Steve realized, and while the whole mansion was clearly equipped with a high-quality interior, it felt strangely… impersonal.
“Sir,” Steve said instead. “I’m going to have to ask you to leave.”
“If ever we came to a point where saving the world was no longer imperative, it would be because we had failed.” Steve smiled wanly. “We’re very good at what we do.”
Steve’s mouth opened in surprise, when he realized what Bucky was saying. He felt heat rising to his cheeks. “I’m not… I never even…” He sighed. “Am I that obvious?”
Huh. A blackout he hadn’t caused, that was… that was actually just what he’d needed.
“I want you,” he said hoarsely, panting when she lowered her head and attacked his throat again. “Please, baby. No more games.”
“I’ll take care of it,” Tony said with a small smile. Then, he laid a hand on Steve’s cheek, stroking the light stubble there. The corner of his mouth had turned up into a half-grin, but his brown eyes kept darting back to Steve’s injured hand in concern. “Can I get you something for that?” he asked.
It was the

The years had taught him many things—namely to trust his senses, and seeing Steve leave without him? It just felt wrong on so many levels.
. When Bruce paused, he muttered “just fucking
“Freddy’s victims and their nightmares,” Natasha whispered into Clint’s ear, grinning when he jumped a little.
pulling him in. The kiss that followed was honey and tears, Steve’s nose resting against Tony’s cheek, his fingers threaded in the hair at his neck. His lips were softer than Tony remembered. Steve melted like molasses against his skin.
. And from what the director of that SHIELD organization had told him, he’d fallen into the ice at 1945. When he’d last seen Tony, he’d said it was 1996.
“You are the man who found me,” he recalled.
Tony smiled gently. “That’s not stupid at all. I know how much you wanted him to be there for this, and since I can’t bring back the dead, I…” He shrugged. “This I could do.”
“So you left KGB, and joined SHIELD, and that was it?”
She sounded highly disbelieving and her eyes narrowed as she took in Happy’s muffled snickering.
Tony had lain down next to him, resting his cheek against Steve’s shoulder and gently running his fingers over his chest, spreading the come a little. It should probably gross him out to some degree, but he couldn’t find it in himself to care.
There was no way Tony would let Steve go there without him.
“Correct again.”
At first, he didn’t see anyone, and it was partly the blood in his eyes, and partly the daze in his head. He saw a whirl of red hair, and two men in uniform approaching. The knife at his throat was gone, and Steve blinked until the scene in front of him came together.
He knew he needed to protect his family. That always came first. Signing the Accords might just be the easiest way to do it, and a not-too-small part of him wanted to go down there and simply get it out of the way. Return home and let the government draw consequences on their own accords, and simply live his life.
Slowly, before he could doubt himself, Steve rocked his hips against Tony. A soft breath left his lips when he felt Tony’s hardness against his own.
“You gonna be at the party, right?”
“Yes, the boathouse. Tony used to go sailing a lot,” Rhodey explained.
He smiled at Steve, then, and Steve smiled back. They looked at each other with a calm understanding. All of those sacrifices they’d made since they’d met in that shabby boxing club years ago were all there, right there in the air between them. And yet… Steve knew without word that Tony would gladly do it all over again. And so would Steve.
“You do that often?” Steve asked, smile still very prominent on his face.
,” Clint agreed.
As Tony and Steve walked side by side, Tony’s mind was racing. How had they gotten to this point? Why had all those events that had seemed so singular at the time led to him and Steve being separated once more while the world was set on fire all around them?
them, but… the more time passes the more I see that it really didn’t have to be that way. And when it finally hits home that this is the way things are now… I just don’t know how to deal with everything being so… good.” Tony shook his head. “I like him, too. A lot. And that scares me.”
Eventually, Steve walked over to the balcony door, leaning against the doorframe, and cleared his throat.
After breakfast, Tony and Clint both announced it was time for a movie marathon. Steve thought about objecting for a second—they all hadn’t slept for a day, and the mission reports needed to be written—but then… they hadn’t done this in weeks, months, probably. And spending a day eating junk food while bickering about movie choices sounded awfully good.
He and Rhodey made their way towards the parking slot, driving to the club that was just a few miles outside of the MIT campus. He wouldn’t be going to any more frat parties, Tony had decided—avoiding campus life as best as he could. The chance to run into Steve was just too much, and if there was one thing Tony would gladly live without for the rest of his life, it was Steve looking at him with pity.
It was strange to see them like this. Not that Tony wasn’t an attractive guy, but… he had never been an option, had he? And even if that changed at some point… it was just completely unfathomable how two people who were so different could ever want to spend the rest of their days together.
His voice had filled Tony’s silences, and he’d welcomed it, letting the rich baritone of his voice wash through him. It didn’t matter what Steve talked about exactly, as long as Tony heard his voice, felt the accompanying whisper of breaths carry his scent across Tony’s skin.
Steve panted. “But…”
Steve thought and scanned his surroundings in an agitation.
Steve’s kiss was just as singular as Tony had always imagined it to be. And when Steve opened his hand, letting go of them in favor of spitting in his palm and taking hold again after, Tony threw his head back with another long groan. His weak heart was pounding so hard, he was sure it would break through his chest. He felt hot all over, his mind spiralling helplessly into a fog, and right now, he didn’t care if reason ever decided to come back to him.
And now, Steve was blinking, his head was tilted and his lips parted as if to speak—
“You should ask T—”
Tony was halfway through reciting every good reason not to go outside right now for the third time, when he eventually gave up, grabbed his jeans, and quietly walked to the exit door.
Tony snorted, shaking his head in disbelief. “How did he have a family the whole time and we didn’t notice?”
“You think so?”
His eyes met Steve’s just briefly before his hand came to play, reaching between them and opening the buttons of Steve’s pants.
“And that matters to you!” Tony spat, throwing the empty glass at the floor, hearing it shatter. And good God, there were tears in his eyes now and he couldn’t keep his voice steady anymore. This was a train-wreck waiting to happen, and yet, he couldn’t keep his mouth shut. “
“Excuse me,” Steve said, forgetting for a moment that he wasn’t exactly alone. “Mr. Let’s-Try-Something-I-Have-Never-Heard-About. We both knew—” He glanced sideways, stopping in mid-sentence when he took in Natasha’s devious grin.
Steve stopped laughing and cast him a surprised glance. He looked down at himself and realized for the first time how naked he truly was. For a moment Steve seemed to have some sort of inner debate whether or not he needed to be sheepish about this, then decided to soldier on. It was the same look he’d always sported back in the days, just before squaring his skinny shoulders, raising his voice, and insulting whoever had just failed his expectations of decent behavior.
Steve followed them with his eyes before waving as well. “Good night,” he murmured, smiling into the darkness.
It took Tony a moment for the meaning behind his words to sink in, but when they did, he groaned. “Too many hospitals lately,” he muttered hoarsely, then winced when he tried to move up.
Tony sighed regretfully. “Yeah, I figured. Step back please?”
"If that were the effect of the thing, we would've been in trouble by now," Steve said. He watched Tony take a seat beside him, even as Bruce stood back, and then asked the next, obvious question. "Any results on the tests, Dr. Banner?"
And now that he put his mind to it, Steve was a great kisser. The kind of ‘Oh shit, I’m hard as nails and weak in the knees’-kisser. The instant Steve’s lips touched Tony’s, he was
“It’ll get better,” he promised with a low voice, now steadily pumping his finger in and out. He felt Steve tremble around him slightly, still squeezing him a bit too tightly, but he was also gradually easing into it.
There was a dim, while not quite black sky, similar to a late twilight, with a jet-black dot in the sky, surrounding by a glowing radiance. The corona moved. Tony could see it flow in and out slightly, as if it was alive.
flickering across the sky.
Across the small path, Steve watched as the guests approached Sharon and paid their last respects. She shook each of their hands as they murmured about Peggy’s dedication and pioneering role about women as leaders, and how they looked forward to working with her in a few years. She only thanked them for coming, just as formally, in reply.
“Very well, Mister Stark.”
be saying that he’d felt bad about talking in the way he had about Barnes’ disability. He could also be saying that he was head over heels for Steve and a childish part of him had wanted him to be proud and, yeah, maybe grateful.
“Me neither,” Tony breathed before leaning in and kissing Steve square on the mouth. He brushed his tongue along Steve’s lips, a small growl clamoring through his throat.
More and more memories assaulted him: terrified faces, screams of agony. Beneath them, the ashes and the dirt of the battle vanished in the drain. And when Steve looked at Tony, he could see it in his eyes: He would offer no sweet words to make it better, and Steve was glad for it. It just proved what Tony had already promised—that no matter what, Steve would have his honesty.
“Ba-ba go?” Ian asked, demanding some attention from his father. Steve looked so startled for a moment that Tony couldn’t hold back a fond smile.
“Does it matter?” Steve asked.

Tony would’ve loved to
Steve had believed they’d never even become friends again, but they
“Buck,” Steve said with a harsh voice, earning six wary glances. He was so tired of Bucky and Tony fighting all the time. He cleared his throat and turned his gaze back to Tony. “We’re grateful that we could come along. Bucky just doesn’t know how to show his gratitude.”
“You could call it that,” Steve said, and finally moved away from his spot in the corner of this room.
"Keep looking at me. This is a bit... more, but you'll get used to it in no time," he said, then put his weight on one elbow while he rubbed himself across Steve's opening.
He used too much force at first, bumping their noses, and then he only pecked Tony like you’d peck your grandmother’s cheek. Tony exhaled a startled breath, and with both of his hands in Steve’s shirt, he kept him at a distance.
“Hawkeye and I have reached the barracks, Captain,” Thor announced. “The second blade has been placed.”
Steve rolled his eyes and moved away. “Nice try, but we gotta at least say hello properly, stay a couple of hours. I could be persuaded to leave early, though.”
Steve had to laugh. “Maybe I love seeing you squirm with need,” he said, pressing forward again. Lifting Tony’s hips slightly, he pushed himself into the tight warmth. “Here we go,” he breathed, beginning to slide in and out.
There were a few beats of silence, before Steve could find it in him to raise his voice again. “JARVIS?” he asked quietly. He made his way to the kitchen, putting the ice cream back into the freezer.
All of them said mostly the same.
Steve let his head fall back, staring at the ceiling. It really was hard to imagine that Tony—not just Tony from 2022, but
Steve stared at the man and he couldn’t believe how cruel he behaved. “Mr. Stane,” he prompted, braving himself, but Stane went on before Steve could get a word in.
"You think you're the only pervert around?" Bucky asked when Steve gave him his best offended look. "Besides, it's not like you're going after a kindergarten kid here. He's gonna be legal in a few months."
They hadn’t argued much afterwards, Steve had been too busy ensuring that Tony was alright after what the man had thrown at him. It didn’t mean they wouldn’t have to talk about it soon.
“Alright, here goes nothing…” he said, and reached for that hammer again. If he stood right next to it, chances were high that he’d be catapulted into the exact same timeframe as Steve had.
Tony, he did, and the fact that he wasn’t able to console him, to simply forgive him and move on, was breaking his heart whenever he so much as looked at him.
"I'm alright, but I think you should ask Mr. Stane there," he said, gesturing towards the stirring man on the couch. All hell would definitely break loose any minute now.
It was much more disappointing than Steve thought it would be.
“You’re a hero. It’s what you do. You fight and you fight more and then someone mucks up the works and makes you fight even harder. Just how it goes.”
Tony’s finger trailed some artless patterns on the protocols in front of him.
There was a quiet, reflective pause.
“I know,” he said. “It was stupid.”
Steve stood up, his chair screeching over the floor tiles.
It wasn’t just Tony, though. It was Pepper and Rhodey, too. Tony had always called the two of them his siblings, which meant they had to be angels, too. And Natasha… All this talk about being a demon, that she’d followed Tony out of Hell, all those knives she kept with her at all times, well…
Bucky shrugged like it didn’t bother him all that much, which, as they all knew, was a lie. “I’ll have eyes on you, won’t I?” He glanced at Tony.
He really needed to go. Now. This wasn’t right, especially not with the turmoil of feelings suddenly raging inside Steve’s mind.
Tony all but shook with anger. “Well, how can you be sure I wouldn’t make any untoward advances to him? I’m doing it all the time.”
[TStark] [chat_server:46953]
“Did you know it’d be so hard?” Tony asked quietly.
God, it would have been so much easier if he could just hate him for what had happened. But he couldn’t.
Steve’s hands kept a tight hold on him. They gauged each other, silence settling in for a moment, before they both looked down at the card again.
He didn’t remember falling asleep, but he must have, for the next thing he knew he was waking up, and it was nearly dawn. The sky above New York was slate, and Natalia was standing by the windows. She was naked, save for his dog tags nestled between her breasts. He couldn’t recall when he’d given them to her, but in any case, it seemed she’d been telling him the truth about their past relationship.
He knew Steve was holding back how little he thought of Obi, but whatever he’d heard him saying to Tony on that day in Bruce’s MIT lab, it hadn’t exactly left a positive impression.
“I’m hungry,” Natasha announced, looking at Sam. “Should we fix breakfast?”
“I don’t care, let me see it.”
“Steve, is that James?” It was Nat’s voice—and she called from somewhere in the next room. “It better be, otherwise we’re going to be late.”
“I was doing what you told me to do. I’m staying here, while I could very well be over there and just find him myself. But I’m doing this your way—and
That was the first thing Steve could even think about, his mouth going dry. The guy looked like he was taken right out of a magazine, even now, late in the evening. Steve wanted to reach for him, trace the fine fabric that hugged that body just right. He'd only seen bits of what Tony looked like naked, but the idea of undressing him
“That’s the spirit,” Rhodey confirmed, clasping a hand on Tony’s shoulder.
“Came and went,” Bucky replied. “Bruce helped.”
And that was that. Steve didn’t even have a chance to answer. Tony was grasping his shoulders, pulling him back with a fierce movement, mouth ravaging his.
Tony’s expression remained flat. “It is for me. We’re just so different. And I don’t know anymore. Everything that I did know has come apart. And that’s good. That means things changed. I’m just not sure I can get used to this new order.”
A sardonic grin overwhelmed Tony, aimed more at himself than anyone else. Of course Steve would be showing up
As Tony ended the call, Pepper took him by the hand and steered him toward the kitchen island. “Come on, you need coffee, lots and lots of coffee.” She refrained from mentioning that Tony also needed a good meal, a haircut, a shave and deodorant.
“Of course I do!” Tony thumped a fist against the wall behind him. “I just… I can’t go back. I can’t go through all of that again. And it won’t change anything, anyway.”
“Nope,” Steve said. He untangled the rope and threw a few of the fruits down to the ground.
“You want me to sit with the others?
Bucky awoke curled in warmth.
“He…” Tony started, swallowing. He didn’t like to lie to Rhodey, but then again, he couldn’t possibly tell him the truth.
“I was just as lost,” Tony admitted.
He hurried on in case Tony was going to deny it.
“Always.”
Tony was wearing a
“Let me get you a pillow,” Steve said, as if on second-thought, and leaned to the side to do just that.
Doing this with Tony’s wings still spread wide behind him gave all of this a very surreal feeling. After all, he was going to sleep with an actual angel. And yet, having Tony stare at him in the way he did, hearing his soft gasps and feeling his hand gripping Steve’s free one—made this the most intimate moment of Steve’s entire life.

“No,” Rhodes assured him. “For like, two seconds, I tried to remember if you’ve ever checked me out and I think you didn’t, which—by the way—only shows how bad your taste is, but no, it’s not weird now.”
, I just… I still feel it, in a—you know—
“And what, you fell in love with him, too?” Tony asked, feeling his hands shaking.
Tony pointed at her. “Don’t call, even if the world is ending.”
“Can I take it off?” Steve asked with a glance at Tony, and he only managed to get a nod in, before Ian had already pulled until the nano fabric came off.
He wouldn’t, though. He had long ago figured out that there was no such thing as ‘right’ and ‘wrong’. And the last thing Tony needed at present was another reminder of what they’d both lost in this war. Thus, he only held up a hand with dry indifference. “My advice, then,” he replied monotonously. “Find someone who cares for what you have to say. We had the chance to talk. You didn’t take it.”
Steve didn’t bother to hide how disconcerted he was. “I wouldn’t.”
Tony paused, then returned his smile—and for the first time since he’d realized that Steve wasn’t
“Your pants are a travesty,” Tony grumbled, fidgeting with the zipper. The look on his face was so adorably frustrated that Steve could not help but laugh. The next thing he knew, however, Tony had stripped his pants away and pushed them down Steve’s thighs.
It certainly was a nice thought. That way, he could just call the others, let them know that he was fine and that he’d meet them back in Manhattan and…
Steve grimaced and forced the words out. “I… I lost someone today.”
“No, what are you
“Not so good,” Tony finished. “Any idea why that is?”
It was something Steve had come to depend on—the promise of Tony’s presence. Because no matter how confused these nights together had him, there was solace in them as well.
He awoke in a dark, closed space. He was standing, his arms crossed over his chest, his waist restrained to the surface behind him. There was some sort of liquid around him. It was not warm and yet not altogether cold. But it was unyielding. Uncomfortable. The entire place was uncomfortable. It smelled odd, thick with antiseptic, and the odors of staleness and something else, something familiar he could not identify. Whatever it was, it was not a pleasant smell. The space around him was pitch black, and he could not see at all.
“You can tell him yourself tomorrow. And… he knows it anyway.”
Tony wrote back.
He wasn’t sure when exactly he and Steve had decided to actually talk politics during their phone calls, leaving the semi-peaceful plane of small talk, but apparently, it was a thing now.
“If we can’t, no one can,” Tony said, because he was sure it was the truth.
Tony smirked. “You’re doing an inner happy dance, aren’t you?”
“Then we’ll deal with it,” Steve said.
“I’m still me,” Steve assured him. He reached out again, and with a low breath, Tony let him squeeze his hand once.
His hands never stilled, stroking up and down the curve of Steve’s waist before smoothing over his taut belly to delve over his middle and further down. With a hard swallow, Steve raised his knees a little, giving him access. Tony, however, took his time tormenting him with soft almost-touches before he slid two fingers down and against his hole.
Steve gasped and shoved his whole body against Stane. Miraculously, it
“You realize that’s B.A.R.F. in short, right?”
Thank you all so much for your comments! They really mean so much to me. So happy you're excited about this. <3
“I want to keep you,” Tony said and Steve threw his head back and moaned when Tony’s lips pressed a series of hot, wet kisses down his throat.
Rubbing a hand across his face, Tony looked down at Steve. Both of his hands were clenched into fists, and he’d raised them defensively in front of his face. The sheets were pooled around his legs, and whatever he was dreaming about—the panic had gripped him fully.
“That was amazing,” he mumbled into Steve’s skin, laughing a bit with how light-headed he felt.
He felt Tony frown against his forehead. “For what?”
“Alive as well. He’s in Wakanda with the rest of the Avengers.”
Tony huffed. “Always the charmer,” he said, then met Steve’s gaze again challengingly. “Suppose it’s still scratchy from all the screaming.”
It was a tight fit, and Steve grimaced at the friction at first. Tony, however, only cried out in ecstasy and he gasped as he clenched around him. Steve stilled for a moment, letting Tony get used to him. He saw his eyes trailing to the ceiling, full of awe and passion behind half-dropped eyelids.
“You know why,” Steve said, breaths ghosting over Tony’s face. “You
There was a little smirk playing around the edge of his mouth. “That’d be me.”
“You’re so good,” Tony gasped rapturously. He was drowning in Steve’s scent, his senses overwhelmed with the feel of him. His thrusts grew needy; desperate. He needed to make Steve his, wholly. He needed it like he’d never needed anything before. “So good,” Tony groaned, shoving into Steve with little control now. He was mumbling a stream of words against Steve’s throat, but he was too far gone to really make sense of any of them.
“Don’t get up yet,” she said softly.
The tour itself was a laugh: slightly entertaining but all in all completely ridiculous. Harold explained the vast number of disturbances, told stories about the previous owners, made rasping noises as he explained why it was called the ‘Bloody Barn’. When the time came to take a picture of the mirror that was said to house the spirits of the ‘weeping bride’ ghost, Tony couldn’t get the camera to work and Steve spent the next ten minutes banging it against every piece of furniture he found until the tour guide snapped at him.
Steve sighed wistfully and pursed his lips. "A student kissed me."
The irony wasn’t lost on Tony. That—to make sure that the Avengers were a united force once Thanos descended upon earth—he apparently had to die.
is hypothetical?”
“Thought about camping,” Steve said, trying for another little smile.
The words had stung much more than Tony thought they would. He’d backed off, smiling at Steve brightly, telling him it had only been a random thought and
“Tony,” she prompted, her tone subdued.
He saw them all in his mind, as they stood there on the deserted airport like the opening of an overly dramatic musical show, and wondered how the hell they got here. Weeks ago most of them had lazed around at the tower, bickering over movies, giving foot rubs to random people and arguing over who took the last beer out of the fridge.
Steve sighed quietly, and squared his shoulders. “Have you ever even built a tent?”
A self-deprecating smile grazed Bucky’s lips. He shook his head. “Worse. Most of the time, I didn’t stand a chance against them.”
It wasn’t fair at all that he was deprived of that chance. And there were only so many times that Steve could sit aside and watch his friend suffer.
“Whatever is necessary to convince everyone to stick together.”
"You go ahead. I'll join you in a bit," he said, already heading in Tony's direction.
“For what?” Tony asked, his voice a little choked.
Steve wasn't sure what had put Tony off. He didn't think he'd been teasing him that harshly, but maybe he'd stumbled upon a sore spot? He was about to ask when Tony put on that smile Steve hated, the one that Tony used to hide all other emotion, and complimented him on the food.
That had a chuckle burst through Steve’s lips. “What does that even mean?”
Tony rubbed a hand over his eyes, feeling a headache rise. “Gotta go. Good night, Steve.”
Steve looked around, frantically, then his gaze fell on a manhole in the middle of the room. There wouldn’t be room for all of them. The next thing he knew, Tony had pushed him forward, while his own body was already encased in the Iron Man suit.
“There it is,” Steve announced. He picked off a few pine needles and showed them to Tony.
Tony felt himself tensing up. He knew what he sounded and looked like. Like he was terrified of Steve, of what Steve meant to him. Tony’s gaze dropped to the floor automatically, so he wouldn’t have to meet Steve’s eyes. “It’s alright,” he said. After a beat, he changed his mind and turned around again. “Just tell me one thing,” he started. “Why have we never talked like this before? Why was it always so difficult between us?”
Steve released several harsh breaths, glancing down at Tony with a frown. “What…” he said slowly, enjoying the view for a few wonderful seconds before he felt Tony’s hand trailing
Tearing his gaze from Tony was not an easy task. The guy could come off as sensual beyond measure when he wanted to, but Steve desperately needed to find an available surface for them right now. The training floor was expansive and he felt exposed, no matter the blackout. Look at all that tan skin…
“Can’t we?” Steve asked, turning around in Tony’s arms and kissing him. “Do we have to go back?”
“You know…” he started and cleared his throat, “if you want to talk about Bucky… I’d be willing to listen.”
Natasha forced a smile to her lips. “Maybe that was for the better.”
Even as he said those words, resolution settled inside him. No, he wouldn’t give up. There was no room for ifs. Steve would know their home again. Steve would sleep in their bed. He would fumble over cooking supplies in their kitchen. He would hold Ian in his arms. He would scream at Tony when they were a hall’s length apart. Kiss him clumsily in the mornings, and hungrily in the nights. It would happen. It
the guy and his giant container of principles.
"Join us upstairs?" he practically blurted out. "I need to go back, but… the meeting shouldn't be long now.”
“It’s okay,” he said, casting Steve a reassuring smile. “You were out of it, flashback, and it’s me, so it’s not the first time someone just planted one on me. Don’t sweat it.”
Below, there was a blueprint of something that looked a lot like a time machine, and even further below—a note:
He was truly beautiful.
It wouldn’t stay that way.
“It’s only been a few weeks.”
As suddenly as it had started, with the same swiftness the eclipse moved into the next phase—a bead of almost blinding light appearing at the periphery of the sun.
From their bedroom, Tony could hear Steve’s soft breathing. For once, he was sleeping in, surely a result of him ranting about the media fallout well into the night. When Tony looked back over his shoulder, he saw Steve’s sleeping figure reaching out towards Tony’s space, instinctively searching for him.
“It’s a twenty-pounder,” Wanda mused. “So four to five, yes.”
Tony remained silent, but the answer was all the same.
“What,” Tony replied with a laugh. “Is that a rhetorical question? Don’t tell me you have been hanging around Steve all this time and you don’t know how stubborn he is?”
, but don’t think I didn’t give as good as I got.”
“So you know me?” Tony urged. He’d taken a step closer, and stared at him intently. “From some file, or…?”
In moments like this, Steve felt it again. That a lot of people he had known and loved had gotten away from him too soon. Especially in cemeteries, Steve tended to have a few very dark thoughts. Surrounded by all those lonely graves he got just a little bit terrified of the idea of—well. Dying alone.
“No,” he said eventually. “It’s just… I, uh, didn’t sleep much today. Must have passed out from exhaustion, I suppose.”
It was a dangerous truth.
thinking of their need. I’m saying we need to figure out a way to keep ourselves in check.”
TS 0:13 A.M.>OK, you’re excused. A slime monster in Beijing, though. Really? That’s not remotely original
With that, the man spun around and thrust out a knife from his pocket, nearly slicing off Bucky’s human hand in the process.
Steve let those words linger, not really knowing what to say to that.
for translating the dialogue parts into Russian for me <3
… should ever care for, right?
“I remember everything,” Bucky replied, sounding terribly defeated. “I remember how she looked at me. I remember that choking her had meant nothing to me, and it… it killed me every time I looked at you. I wish I could give you his regret, but the man I was back then wasn’t able to feel anything. He didn’t care, he couldn’t. I just… I am sorry
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve sighed, rolling his eyes. “Tony.”
“What?” Rhodey asked. “But no one was sailing with her that night!”
Sorry! Thanks so much for the lovely feedback, I'm so happy you like the story so far. Final chapter will be up sometime next week.
Tony froze, fingers digging into Steve’s skin. But, to Steve’s credit, he didn’t move away from Tony one bit. On the contrary, he leaned forward, shielding Tony completely and likely giving Clint one hell of a view, what with the way he had his ass pointed straight towards the barn’s door.
to see that.”
“Idiot,” Steve said as he rested his elbows on his knees, then dropped his forehead onto his unbloodied wrists and sat there for a long time.
An hour later, Steve sank his toes deeper into the grass and watched Tony in the tree, filling the pack at his side with fruit. They were taking turns with this, not because Steve couldn’t have done it all by himself, but because Tony was always getting bored if he stood at the sidelines too long.
That brought a pained grimace to Tony’s face. He rubbed a hand over his face, looking for all the world like he was being torn in two. “I think it’s best if you leave the ball now,” he whispered, his eyes shining. “We’ll talk about this another time.”
Slowly, Steve walked back to his room—their room—Pepper’s word echoing in his mind.
Steve snorted, and he was probably grinning like a loon now. He only schooled his expression when he noticed Bucky and Sam staring from the couch in front of him. They were lounging there in sweatpants with a bowl of cereals each, and the only reminder that something was severely not right in this scenario was Bucky’s missing arm.
Steve stopped, grabbing for his shoulders. “You come first.
“I’ll try to be as monstrous as I can,” Bruce supplied with a smile. “Make for a good distraction. Then you can tell them.”
Steve stared at Tony as though he was crazy.
Like a team would do. Like
When Tony looked up, he saw Steve standing at the door. He already wore the tux that still had Tony’s knees go a little weak. He didn’t look pleased, though, despite of the small smile he cast Tony.
. Why hadn’t he realized that sooner? Why hadn’t Tony told him from the beginning?
“You saved my life,” Steve said, coming closer. His gaze still flickered towards the wings, though he very obviously tried not to look at them. “I can’t… grasp it all, yet. I keep replaying every case we had in my head, everything that happened since I’ve met you, but it’s all a mess right now. And yet I know—I
Then it hit. A wave of realization so potent, it made Steve gasp aloud.
Minutes later, as they lay wrapped in each other’s arms, Steve thought back on everything that had happened, this wondrous turn his life had taken, and closed his eyes.
“But you do trust me.”
A heartbreaking pause.
Steve grimaced. He’d often asked himself the same question, and he’d found many excuses—that he’d wanted to protect Bucky, that he’d never found the right time, that Tony hadn’t made it easy to trust him, but… at the end of the day, all of those excuses crumbled when looked at too closely.
Stay tuned for more chapters. soon.
other institution I don’t have full observation rights to.”
“Uh, Steve?” Tony suddenly asked, and when Steve looked at him in confusion, he was pointing to the distant horizon. Steve followed the line of Tony’s finger and he saw a streak of green…
Steve didn't need a talk with his best friend for that, but it was a nice distraction. They had something to eat before Steve got ready to leave for work. He'd planned to squeeze in a bit of gym time before work, but with his head still tender with post intoxication, he decided it would be best not to test his limits.
Tony tried glaring at him again, but the smile twitching at Bucky’s lips just made him raise an eyebrow and cross his arms over his chest. “You’re one to talk. You guys have more ‘moments’ than any other couple in history.”
Sharon smiled very gently at him, and then at Tony. She gave them both equally very long hugs, with a peck on the cheek each. “Thank you,” she answered. “I should say the same to you.”
A brief silence. Then, the shadowy figure gave off a curt nod. “Good evening, gentlemen.”
The screwdriver slipped through Tony’s fingers and fell down on the workshop table, clanking loudly. He glanced over his shoulders, not even bothering to school his surprise when he saw Steve standing just a few steps behind the sliding door. He looked a bit out of place there, his arms drawn tight to his body, shoulders set in a tense line.
“I asked the cashier in the last rest stop,” Steve answered easily, before his expression got pensive. “You know, if you’d make yourself a bit more approachable, you’d find out that some people may surprise you.”
Steve motioned at the tiny candle in the middle of the cupcake. On top of the meringue frosting, there was a delicately written
Bucky was white as a sheet. His eyes had gone blank—the rest of him contorted with anguish. He released a trembling breath and shook his head, sliding forward until his feet met the floor. “I’m not sure…”
The day Tony
“Not yet,” Ross offered. “We’re waiting—”
Steve chuckled, his hand gently slapping Tony’s rump. “You know how it is: Bad pennies, they keep coming back anyway.”
“Ahh,” he breathed, arching again, moving just a little harder. “Anything you want... I’ll do anything.”
Steve's step faltered briefly when Tony kissed him. He should've expected this, probably, what with Tony's shameless flirting and all, but it still surprised him. He cleared his throat, then shook his head to clear it.
When Tony woke up, Steve’s head dipped to whisper a kiss at the pulse of his throat. “Morning.”
Vision didn’t quite smile, but his mouth might’ve twitched a little. “Glad you think so, Steve.”
He was holding something in his hands, Tony realized, squinting to get a better look.
“Well, I think you ask too many questions.” Tony’s brows quirked in jest, a smile tickling his lips. “That a yes to marshmallows, Cooper-o?”
Steve didn’t want to know what he looked like when he walked towards his team’s quarters two days later. He stopped for a moment, tilting his head back as he enjoyed the icy winds. His eyes were raw, and fatigue claimed every muscle in his body. He was jittery from the horrible coffee he’d forced himself to drink over and over again and so exhausted from avoiding sleep he feared he might collapse.
Tony shrugged, and glanced at Steve. “Yeah.” His face softened slightly as he stared back at the ground. “Yeah, make it count.” He cleared his throat, calling over his shoulder as he turned around. “You two should get inside, by the way, we got a surprise visitor you might wanna see.”
Steve stopped, but made sure not to let his uncertainty show. “I’ll not let you order me around,” he retorted, crossing his arms, his body wound tighter than Steve had ever remembered.
you. He loves you, despite all your baggage, Tones. All he wants is for you to lo—”
Tony’s eyes were still shooting daggers at Steve, as he pressed the button to open the window. Still, he climbed up in the passenger seat, and with a last deep breath, stuck his bare ass out the open window. Steve could hear the repeated honks from the SUV and broke out laughing.
Steve smiled at him weakly. “Yeah. I know.”
I don’t. But I can’t fight our teammates either, no matter the cause. I can’t fight James. Look at me and tell me you’re not gonna pull your punches if you have to face Steve.”
Steve suddenly stood up and took a few steps away from Tony. He brushed a hand over his head as he stared out of the window. Then, he turned around again. “Really?”
“Will you throw us out if I say yes?”
her! An innocent woman!”
“I’ll make a few calls,” Maria supplied, slowly walking out of the room.
Pepper sighed softly, squeezing his hand in return. “It’s only temporary. He’ll be back home soon enough.”
“Uh huh.”
“Anything you need.” She leaned back in the chair. “I’ll be right there.”
Steve nodded slowly. “I didn’t think you’d remember.”
. And I don’t like that there’ll always be this version of us I can’t grasp. I know it’ll hurt. We fought each other, how could it not hurt? But before our wedding, I want to share this with you, all the good and the bad parts.”
That was it? A PhD? "But—"
“Then why did you?”
The shallow tease had been growing progressively more pleasant, as Steve relaxed into the motion of it. He felt wet inside, and invaded, but in a way that complemented the heat surging through him. Tony was jerking him off all that while, distracting, but also giving the whole experience an erotic undercurrent.
“Uhm…” Tony eventually said, frowning at the paper once again. There were all those things written down there. Things like ‘Spend the rest of my life with you’ and ‘Don’t care about you zoning out over some project’ and ‘I’ll make you breakfast in the mornings for the rest of your life’ and half of it was crossed out again but at the end of the note, there was a big fat ‘Marry me?’ and there was really no way to misunderstand that.
“I think I know why you did it,” Barnes told him after a moment, and when Tony stared up at him once again, he just shrugged. “You want to protect him, I can get behind that. But Steve never took well to being lied to. You of all people should know that by now. How could you think this was a good idea?”
He shouldn’t give a damn, but he did. This moment was Tony’s.
Stane had sounded so sure of himself, like there was no way in this world or the next that Tony would ever doubt him.
There was nothing but bliss stretching every curve of Tony’s face. And at that moment, it was all Steve knew.
“It’s time,” he announced, just as the doors to the workshop opened and the others stepped in.
“You think that now,” Tony whispered urgently. “But the only thing you’ll get is regret and hurt and a million other things you could very well live without. If you think
“But… why didn’t you just divorce her?”
Still, they needed to dash forward now, no compromises. Steve wasn’t about to allow HYDRA to keep on with their little hide and seek that had been going on for the better part of the last half year. And experience had shown that the longer they needed to ambush HYDRA’s bases, the larger were the chances of them smuggling Loki’s scepter out in time. There really was no time to back out now. Still, Steve would never forgive himself if something happened to anyone on his team, especially Tony.
, Tony’s voice resounded in Steve’s earpiece, and the suits came to a halt right above Bucky’s form.
So instead, Steve concentrated on the deep phantom ache inside him, the emptiness in the wake of being deeply fucked. He wrapped his arms around Tony and held him close for a while, waiting for whatever words Tony was thinking, until they came, and then he hummed in thought.
“Yeah,” Tony agreed, and released an airy chuckle. “Cause I’m getting too old for this.”
“Stay up here,” Steve ordered, and raised his shield in front of him.
Maria grimaced.
There was silence for a long second, and Steve couldn’t move, couldn’t say anything. Then, he heard Tony take a shaky breath and walk away.
It would be five against two, not counting Zemo himself. Not exactly a fair fight if what Bucky had told him about their strength was true, but then again, he and Bucky had fought so many battles together, that had to count for something.
, and I get it. Zemo’s playing us. You gotta go, and I’m gonna help you. You just have to tell me where you’re headed.”
“What am I looking at?”
Steve smirked. “You wouldn’t.”
Barnes had gone completely still next to him, and Tony furrowed his brows when he didn’t show any reactions even after a few seconds had passed.
In the distance, thunder roared, and blasts of energy started to illuminate their surroundings. It was as if the sky was coming apart at its seams, as if it was cracking in the middle, taking the very essence of life with it.
As expected, Tony’s eyes snapped open, and his hips lifted instinctively. “You can’t be serious,” he muttered, his voice slurred. “S-Steve?”
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve from behind. “I can’t tell you that,” he said, nuzzling the side of Steve’s neck. And—all right fine—birthdays
goddammit it, he didn’t even know what he was forgiving Steve for, anymore.
resounded.
. He couldn’t just sit around and stare at her rigid form all day.
second more, he could’ve given his foot thrusters maximum power and pushed himself upwards and into the air, but Barnes didn’t give him that second. His free hand produced a small knife seemingly out of nowhere and within the fracture of a second, he let go of the gauntlets, grabbed the knife with his metal hand, and pushed it down.
“I want you to be sure.” He took Steve’s hands in his, caressing his knuckles with his lips. “This has all happened very fast. Your life has changed so fast. Don’t think that I don’t know that. When you come to my bed, I want your heart with me.”
Well… okay.
A little bit like infinity.
Bruce hummed, unconvinced. “I’ll see if I can get JARVIS back online,” he said, sighing deeply as he shuffled out of the room. Before he left, he put a hand on Tony’s shoulder, petting him twice in consolation.
—had put every ounce of skill to portray Tony just as he always saw him… sitting right in the center of all that energy, all that rawness and passion falling into his being from every direction.
“I was in it before,” Tony pointed out. “And you seemed to be having a—”
“Know what about him?” Rhodey asked from where he stood in the doorway to the bathroom. He was already dressed, a small towel slung around his neck.
Steve swallowed down the lump forming in his throat. It wasn’t JARVIS’ intentions he was worried about. The AI had put trust in him from the very beginning, even when Steve had still been an undercover agent—pretending he was someone else only so he could get behind Tony’s secrets. He’d lied to Tony, had deceived him, and even though JARVIS had seen through Steve’s scheme, he had still put faith in him.
weaknesses," Bruce answered, exasperated. "Do we have any idea what it's looking for?"
“Don’t be a baby,” he told him. “A couple of months ago, a slime monster dumped a whole church on me and left me there to burn to death; so you can deal with a little antiseptic.”
“It’s only another half hour,” Natasha said and sat down on Steve’s other side, her head pillowed on his shoulder. “We’ll figure it out.”
He started to haul himself to his feet. “I’m just going to get a glass of water.”
, he decided then and there. It would be too much… for his own heart, and sure as hell for Steve’s fragile conscience. He could take a little shock and guilt in the morning, but if Steve looked at him in horror and self-disgust, that would just be too much.
there was anything to do. Steve met Tony’s pained eyes again; eyes that didn’t seem to belong to him, and it wasn’t just the blackness, they were unfocused and bleary, like Steve had never seen them before.
“In any case, they’re not gonna hurt anyone out here, and I have a birthday cake to bake.”
* * *
Peter gave him a dirty look.
” he said, and hugged Tony close. “I’ll accept my fate.”
“Call me Steve, please.”
“They would ask Strange for help,” Tony said, sounding more thoughtful than actually angered. “And Strange—no matter how much of an asshole he is—knows how to track the portal’s traces. It shouldn’t take this long, unless…” He sighed, glancing at Steve. “Unless they didn’t even find out we fell through the portal in the first place. In
Steve's hand ran idly up and down Tony's back in a slow line. He hummed a no and closed his eyes. Tony's weight was a comforting presence, and he didn't want it to disappear just yet. The way the man's words slurred, his complete limpness, the way he draped over Steve, he just wanted to keep all of that.
“Uh-uh, Captain Super-Secretive,” Tony commented with a frown. Steve’s smile had turned a little sheepish and that was… odd, especially now. He was about to press for an answer, when the lights inside the Quinjet switched from red to green, indicating their arrival.
, Steve. Should I get a fucking dictionary for you?”
So, I have apparently caught a flu that's planning to kill me real slow, so I'm sorry for slower updates. Hope you guys are still here for the rest of the story... This will be a dual-POV chapter.
“Cream, please, but Tony, I—I really have to go. I only came to thank you for being so kind to me. I really can’t keep Mister Hammer waiting. He—”
* * *
“Are you sure?”
“Exactly.” Clint stood up again, petting Steve’s shoulder with a smug smile. “Now do yourself a favor and judge your man by the same standards?”
“Tony—”
With every ounce of willpower his tired muscles could muster, Tony looked up a little, glancing at Steve. “‘m sorry,” he mumbled. He was kind of aware he might’ve dragged it out a little too long there. “I didn’ hurt you, did I?”
Tony reached his free hand across the table to grab hers. Then, he pulled it to his lips and pressed a quick kiss to her knuckles. “Please don’t be mad at me.” He was probably laying it on a bit thick now, jutting his lower lip out and batting his lashes to see if he could save himself from receiving the sharp end of Pepper’s heels.
Tony’s mouth was enthusiastic against Steve’s, wrestling hot, needy kisses as his hands took chart down his body. When his hand reached for the waistband of his boxers, though, Steve’s entire body froze.
Tony snorted. “I want bonus points for not having Extremis peek via camera. I’m expecting a reward, and when I say ‘reward’ I’m talking naughty things, Steven.”
, just as Tony’s eyes closed and darkness fell.
“You…” Tony shook his head, staring at him in terrible confusion. “You love me. Still.”
Steve could breathe. He hadn't realized it might've been an issue until the air burst from his lungs and was replaced by a fresh breath. Why was it so difficult to talk about these things? Was it because he was already so invested, so ridiculously in it for how little time they'd actually spent together? He shook his head once, then pulled back to look down into Tony's eyes. There was nothing but genuine sincerity there, and Steve leaned down to kiss him, chaste and gentle.
Damn it.
Pratt? Relief rolled off Tony’s shoulders. Steve could be such an
“He’s doing alright,” Steve answered. “As much as we all are.” He sighed, gently brushing his nose along Ian’s hair, inhaling his scent. God, he’d missed him, in a way he couldn’t have fathomed a year ago. “You don’t have to see him, you know,” he told Tony.
* * *
He probably looked uneasy, and Pepper’s sharp eyes noticed it immediately. “Have you been alone long?”
“How many people are you cooking for?” Natasha asked with some amusement, stepping into the kitchen and looking down at the big pot of potato soup stirring on the stove. There was spiced roast in the oven, the side dishes were well underway, and Steve had already fixed up the cake batter for Tony’s birthday cake.
room, and no one else’s.
“Da-da-da,” Ian said, as he glanced over to Tony, as if to prove Vision’s words.
“Tony designed it before the war started,” Happy explained. “It’s marvelous.”
“A bit.” Clint’s bag rustled as he pulled out his bow on the backseat. “We weren’t prepared for the UN to insert itself into the team. But, Steve, I told you the others will have to be on the move to stop us and… don’t you think it’s a little naïve to hope Tony won’t know when we steal his Quinjet?”
“Tony really got to him,” Bruce confirmed with a gentle tone. “Trust me, I could’ve done without the dramatics, but his brainwaves were fantastic.”
“’s tha’ mean you don’ wan’ me?” Tony whispered, as Steve tucked him in.

Steve nodded, but the corners of his mouth were lifting slightly. “I can kiss it better, if you like.”
“I’ve done my job,” Steve replied.
“...I think he liked you?”
“No. But I can’t risk him actually succeeding. I can’t go through that again. I’d rather die.” He raised one of his shoulders in a half-shrug. “Anyway, it’s broken now. Problem solved.”
And then, without ceremony, he walked out of the room, pointedly forcing himself not to come across too hurried.
. It’s most definitely not about Steve!”
“That’s… odd,” Tony concluded.
He’d cared for him when they’d just formed a team, and when they’d argued, and when they’d ultimately broken apart. He’d cared for Steve
Steve ignored him. “Tony, you can help me with the side dishes. Jim, Sam…” He turned around, where Sam and Rhodes were both currently following Ian across the room. Steve smiled. “Yeah, just… keep doing that.”
There shouldn’t be any reasons for nightmares.
“Among other things.”
“My friend, Rhodey, will be here tomorrow, as well,” Tony said. “It’s a coincidence, but perhaps it’s best that you meet them all at once. My family can be a little… much. They’ll likely be the people you see the most around here.”
“What?” Tony interjected, only barely refraining from screaming. “If you stayed with HYDRA? If you died? You’re here now, so I suggest you to start dealing with it. Everyone else might treat you like a delicate little flower, because you’re
They were still twenty miles from their goal, when the world began to change.
He’d been waiting to get some answers from Steve for two whole days, he wasn’t going to let him get away now. “I’m good, not too busy. I was actually hoping you’d come down here sometime, I was a bit worried after your last flashback, I… uh, Natasha talked to you, right?”
Once he’d gathered every single one of the stones, once he’d reached his goal, he’d become so powerful that he’d simply left his body behind, becoming something… else.
Steve shifted his weight from one foot to the other, as he regarded Tony. He leaned in a bit more, his mouth now close to Tony’s ear. “Just checking: We’re not talking about yesterday, are we?”
SR 5:27 P.M.>Most likely. Gotta go. Marea tomorrow at 8?
Before he completely knew what was happening, Steve was already by his side, pushing Tony towards the sink. He turned on the water and thrust Tony’s hand beneath the spray.
Tony just smiled dopily, and with a surprising amount of dexterity, he managed to put a hand on Steve’s cheek, tracing the line of his jaw with his thumb.
There was a long beat, and Tony didn’t meet his gaze anymore. “I killed my wife,” he repeated, his voice barely audible. “I’m a monster who murdered my own wife. And now you know. Now

Before he could fully grasp the meaning of Rumlow’s words, Rumlow was back on his feet. There was blood at the corner of his mouth, and his features were twisted with gleeful rage.
Strange nodded, looking at him squarely. “Then how about you don’t build him and go from there?”
Tony smiled, as he reached around Steve to turn the water off—and it was a sad little thing. “I know.”
with it, I tried to—” He offered a dry chuckle, wincing as he moved to sit up a little more. “I had it handled. I would’ve made sure they didn’t kill him. And you wouldn’t
A final, slightly longer sound ended the blackout.
Because Steve would move to New York sometime soon even if it killed him. He had to be closer to Tony, since driving out here every other weekend was wearing him out. Besides, Bucky was spending more and more of his time with Natasha, and it was getting cramped in his tiny apartment.
[TStark] [chat_server:46953]
"You know, this," Bucky said, indicating his missing arm, "this sort of thing happens when you become a soldier. It just happens, and we have to accept that it happens sometimes. I was the unlucky guy, fine. I can live with that. We both knew the risks going in." He shook his head, giving a bitter laughter. "But disappearing for three years, that's a choice." He looked directly at Steve. "Your choice."
Steve’s mouth perked, his eyes dropping to the brown liquid swirling in the ceramic mug. Never had hot chocolate seemed less appealing.
Steve frowned. “Liked what?”
Laughter fell away into passion then, Tony’s mouth greedy and demanding on Steve’s, his blunt nails raking down his back.
He couldn’t though, because the others were holding them captive with their post-party chatter and some trying-to-lift-Thor’s-hammer competition. And Tony didn’t want to be the party pooper and ask them to give his old-man-bones a break.
So no, Steve didn’t agree overnight, and not on the day after, but agree he did. And thus, Ian was, in fact, theirs. He was Steve’s, and he was Tony’s. And he was one of a kind.
