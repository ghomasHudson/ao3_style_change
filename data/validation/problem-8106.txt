Steve laughs and Tony chuckles in return.
“Graciously, he says! I won fair and square. It’s not my fault you’re so bad at rock, paper, scissors.”
“That sounds really sweet,” is what he comments.
With the hand that is still holding Tony’s Steve pulls, but not harshly enough to hurt Tony or stretch his shoulder too much, just enough to encourage Tony to move and get him to his feet.
Her voice sounds almost flat, devoid of any emotion, like it’s trying very hard to give nothing away and that’s what ends up giving her away the most.
Tony hums questioningly as he opens his eyes and sees Steve looking back at him.
Nebula nods and her face goes back to that blank look of concentration as she starts rearranging her body in a wider stance while positioning her hands in the shape Tony taught her 8 days into their trip, when boredom was getting to be too much for both of them.
It’s no small thing that Pepper and Rhodey, two people that loved Tony so whole-heartedly, think Steve would have been worthy of their best friend. It feels nice to know there are people who think of him -Steve Rogers and not Captain America- in such a high manner. He never got to truly know Tony when he was alive but the things Steve has learnt about him after his death prove that it’s an honor to be considered someone who could have matched him and deserved him.
And maybe that is also part of why they haven’t been prioritizing the issue. Both of them know there is nothing that could quite break the two of them truly apart. It’s an unspoken thing. A given promise.
Tony only pulls away once he realizes he still hasn't done the one thing he came here to do.
Steve, with his presence and his question and his not allowing Tony the chance to run away or deflect, is telling him he wants to help, that he will help.
“You need to explain your actions,” she’s said more than once.
His left hand reaches inside the broken part of the helmet and blindly feels for the button he’s searching for. It only takes a few seconds and as he presses it a blue scanner light comes from one of the eye plates, moving through Tony’s body and lightly blinking once, signaling that a recording is being made.
“What?” she asks, although by her tone of voice Tony can tell she already knows what Tony’s thinking.
He goes through the motions of getting dressed while his mind is still fixed on the words. He walks towards his office while his mind analyzes every single aspect of the words. He spends the entire video-conference distracted, a part of his brain constantly coming back to
Tony had said and yet Pepper’s story reminds him of so many women he knew around his block in the 40s, women constantly dreading that visit that would let them know their husbands, sons or brothers wouldn't be making it back to them.
Yes. No.
“You should have joined me,” Thor says, his voice gruff. He’s obviously trying to make light of the situation but Tony’s face must be so stony that the lightness of Thor’s own expression rapidly dissolves.
“I want to see Bruce.”
“It’s 5:37 AM, boss.”
There are empty cardboard containers on the table from that Chinese place Rhodey and Pepper swear by. There’s an empty beer bottle in front of Rhodey while Pepper and Steve are sipping at their wine glasses leisurely. Tony’s just been drinking water but his cheeks still look flushed and Steve knows it must be a sign of his delight. Tony’s relaxed and having fun and his face is a perfect reflection of that. Steve swears Tony’s almost shining with joy and he believes he’s never seen anyone more beautiful. It’s an honor to be one of the few to see Tony like this.
His voice is nothing more than a whisper. His face is dry but the redness and puffiness of his eyes is a telltale sign of his previous crying. He isn’t smiling but his face presents a softness that wasn't there before in the kitchen.
. You can go back to reading after the next scene divider. I don't think you miss anything crucial if you skip it.
“I know that the explanation I gave in the letter I sent you with the phone wasn’t a good one and it wasn’t enough,” Steve acknowledges. “But I hate to say that I don’t have a better one even now. It wasn’t because I didn’t trust you and it wasn’t because I didn’t care about you because I did, I swear I did.
“Thanks, J,” Tony says after clearing his throat and this time there is no doubt, he’s blushing. “Send them up.”
He forgoes taking the elevator for once and uses the stairs to get to the lower level of the main building and in just a little over a minute Tony finds himself in front of the glass walls of his workshop, a place so familiar and comfortable to him it feels like he’s never even left it each time he returns.
Bruce has taken refuge in his research of his connection with Hulk and is working harder than ever into trying to find the answer to why Hulk has seemed to go into hiding from him and he’s also searching for the perfect and permanent solution for them both -Banner and Hulk- maybe for the first time ever thinking about the both of them. All of this - the work, the researching, the experimenting- mean he’s -perhaps unconsciously- distanced himself from the rest of them for the last couple of weeks.
Exiting his text conversation with Tony and feeling a lot more content now that he knows he’ll be seeing him soon, Steve lays down on the couch to wait, clicking back to the Photo app of his phone and looking through the pictures he took of the sunset before taking his own selfies.
“It’s still pretty early,” Tony informs him after looking at the digital clock next to the television set and seeing the numbers 6:27AM reflected back at him. “Maybe we both could use a bit more sleep.”
When Tony turns back around towards Steve to give him his drink he finds him sat in one of the island chairs, his arms resting on the surface and his head laying down on them.
He knows he need not apologize but there’s something in him that compels him too, anyway. It’s not guilt, embarrassment or doubt because this is Steve in front of him. Maybe it’s habit, or some sort of learnt instinct that’s impossible to get rid of, he’s not sure.
“I’m sorr—“ Steve starts to say but Tony cuts him off.
Thanos is dead. He’s dead. Thor killed him.
Everything around them is moving quickly now, nothing like the small stroll they had been doing for the past weeks and Tony, for the first time in what feels like an eternity, starts feeling that warm ache inside him, that overwhelming grip of hope in his heart.
Tony wants to find Steve and share with him the pain he must be going through. There is no magic solution to this, no simple way and no easy moving on from what Steve has had to experience today but Tony hopes his presence will soften the blow.
Steve chuckles and shakes his head, moving to stand in front of Tony once again.
Every head turns to look at him.
Natasha’s door is still open when they make it to her room but she is nowhere to be found at first glance. Steve looks at Tony, who gestures with his head towards the wooden door. Steve understands and, with a short nod to signify it, knocks rhythmically on the frame of the door.
There’s an exhaling noise next that lasts just as long as the inhaling one had and then the noises repeat as JARVIS says, “Again.”
“I know there’ll be things we need to do if we bring him back and I promise we’ll deal with that, Rhodey. I’ll work with whoever I need to work with,” Natasha assures.
Tony’s tongue touches Steve’s bottom lip and he starts tracing it, back and forth and back and forth. His left hand finds the back of Steve’s hands and, tangling his fingers in the short strands of blond hair, he tilts Steve’s head so he can find the perfect angle to slip his tongue inside Steve’s mouth.
Thor’s always been one of them, no matter what their situations might have been like over the years and it’s about time the Avengers start taking proper care of their own.
She’s not wearing any make up, every single freckle on her face visible just as the large bags under her eyes. Tony’s heart finds a home in his throat and when he tries to swallow it hurts and he has to cough.
“Tony,” Steve’s kneeling next to him in the blink of an eye, placing his hands under his head and checking for injuries. “Tony, I’m sorry.”
Between the two of them they’ve eaten the entirety of the three pizzas Tony ordered but Steve knows it was mostly his doing.
Steve turns around, making Tony dislodge his arms from around Steve’s waist, and gently guides Tony forward with a hand on one of his shoulders. He nudges Tony closer to the railing and then positions himself behind him when Tony is facing the streets and the view of the Coliseum and is gripping the railing with his hands, their positions now reversed as Steve own hands move to grab Tony’s hips through his dress shirt.
Tony nods.
But Steve’s just so… baffled. So stunned. So happy.
Steve smiles at him but Tony can’t look at him for much longer because his eyes are drawn back to the picture frame again.
They’re partners, and when the time comes again they’ll have each other’s backs in all battles and wars.  Even the ones they fight with themselves.
Colonel Rhodes breaks his serious demeanor to chuckle ironically.
“No, Tony,” he answers slowly, making Tony feel like he’s being mocked or treated as if he was an unruly child. “It’s not about that.”
Temperature in space seems to always be dramatic too. Space during the time that coincides with when he’s awake -because it can’t exactly be called daytime- is cold and when the time comes around for him to lay down space is so hot he can feel sweat roll down his forehead as he tries to fall asleep with his jacket bundled up under his head. Well, that’s not true, space is neither hot nor cold, at least not that Tony can tell. The spaceship that Tony is traveling in
It is Tony’s turn to tease when he says, “Is it because of the whole
(It helps, hearing Rhodey speak about Tony in the way he knows Bucky would speak about him. It helps knowing that maybe in another life Tony and Bucky could be the one commiserating and remembering Rhodey and Steve.)
JARVIS ends up being an invaluable help during these nights.
“Yeah,” she agrees and stands up, folding the blanket she had been using to cover herself with and resting it on the back of the couch.
_______________________________
Lunch that day is equal parts enlightening and awkward.
He kept in touch with all of them one way or another and Steve still, at times, consulted him in certain aspects of their roles, even if in the end he mostly went with his own pre-set decisions instead of taking many of Tony’s indications into consideration.
Steve’s head shoots up from his lowered position and his eyes are wide when they settle on Tony’s form. His eyes and nose are reddened and his cheeks are wet, tears still making their way down his smooth face. His mouth is opened wide and Tony wonders if it’s because of the surprise of having been caught crying this way.
Pepper and Rhodey both accept his apologies but Steve can tell that while Pepper’s smile is completely genuine and that where they’re both concerned everything’s okay, it will take a little longer to get things back to what they were with the Colonel. Steve is fine with having to put in the work for it.
Time in space seems to move in a confusing pattern too: it’s trying to fix the ship and fear and a weirdly formed companionship with Nebula.
“Really?” Steve asks, his throat feeling constricted with emotion.
“Go on, you menaces,” Tony says as he motions the bots forward with a flick of his hand.
One of Steve’s favorite leather jackets is hanging on a hook he placed there himself a couple of months ago. Back then Steve had said Tony’s coats and jackets didn't deserve the treatment of being thrown all over the place in whatever manner so he had bought the little white sticky hooks they sell on hardware stores and had installed them in under 10 seconds.These days the hooks are mostly used by Steve for his own outerwear or for the moments he gets exasperated when  visiting Tony and tidies up his clothes from all over the workshop.
But being Iron Man has meant so many different things during the years and maybe, these days, being Iron Man isn’t so much about what he thinks he needs to do, about what he feels he owes the world, but about what won’t kill him in the process.
Before Steve can continue talking Tony asks, “What happened?”
And Natasha starts gently shaking her head, once, and then twice, and then again and again and again, looking like a little girl that’s endlessly lost.
“That almost sounds like a…” Steve trails off.
He’s still not sure they will ever be a family of sorts like the one he created with the Commandos but he’s tired of them existing in the kind of limbo they’ve been operating in -not quite together, not quite apart; not quite friends but something other than mere acquaintances-.
The sound seems to center Steve and he stops his fidgeting to focus on Tony.
It had felt right to have her by his side through everything that had happened at the time: her support through the endless reunions with diplomats and politicians that he knew couldn’t stand him, her willingness to act as the face of the group of Avengers that was in favor of the Accords, the feel of her gentle hand on her shoulder as she asked him if he was okay.
Steve’s own outburst is only met with silence.
Tony’s voice sounds soft and hesitant like Steve would ever be able to tell him no, like he would ever pass the opportunity to spend more time with Tony when the man himself is offering it.
It’s all this noise filling his head and making it seem like there immensity of the ocean is between him and Steve, so much water distorting Steve’s image and making it difficult for them to understand what the other is saying.
. And what has helped him most has been thinking of himself as who he can be in the future, allowing himself the opportunity to daydream and imagine all the possibilities of the man he can become.
He places a gentle kiss on top of Tony’s head, catching a trace of Tony’s natural scent, his cologne mostly gone after hours of walking around and gentle breezes accompanying them during their explorations.
“Barnes.”
Tony nods and something shapes itself back together inside his chest. He gives Steve a small smile and moves towards the couch, territory that is normally Steve’s but that for whatever reason feels right at the moment.
Tony’s instantly grateful as he opens the doors that Steve went to get them some heavy clothes because the night is cold and dewy, winter already making itself known in New York, greeting them with an icy breeze as soon as they step outside.
It’s the most forward explanation. It’s also the simplest one. The truest, too.
Tony has always associated cooking with home, with safety and comfort.
“Why do you have to hurt me this way, Steve? Why?” Tony dramatizes.
Steve and Tony share a short but intense look of confusion between them but neither of them say anything and they just wait for Natasha to speak.
At some point before Tony made it down to the workshop Steve unbuttoned three of the top buttons of the shirt but other than that and the roughness that still shows in his face he looks just as put together as he did earlier in the day during the memorial.
“Tony,” Steve starts. “You know you can’t—You couldn’t—“
Steve tries to smile reassuringly but he can feel how weak the smile he’s showing really is. His lips are trembling and he feels a twitch in his right cheek from the awkwardness of it. He winds up biting his bottom lip to stop it from showing his nerves.
But the one thing Steve hopes he will be forever remembered as is the love of Tony Stark’s life.
In fact, Tony thinks, if Steve won’t bring up the topic Tony will be the one starting the conversation.
Thor doesn’t actually come into his room but Tony catches a glance of him twice through the glass walls of his room.
“I think Pepper texted you!” Steve yells in the direction of the kitchen, where he can hear Tony’s voice as he talks to someone on the phone.
The tears aren’t just about that, but Tony finds that having an excuse for them is better than admitting the real deal.
. Pure, unadulterated
He exits the elevator on the communal floor and the first thing he hears is the soft hum of the television in the background. He pauses in the hallway and looking up in the direction of the ceiling -although he’s been told time and time again it isn’t necessary- he calls for JARVIS.
The only other light in the room apart from the dim shine of the Moon comes from the television screen, set on the Blu-Ray player’s home screen.
“Yeah,” he confirms. “Not going to dramatically faint on you again any time soon.”
Steve turns to look at him with his free hand already turning the knob. By the confused frown that has appeared on his face Tony knows he must have felt the way Tony’s hands has started twitching in his. Feeling awkward Tony disentangles his hand from Steve’s although Steve holds on to it a few seconds too long after Tony starts trying to pull away.
sorry. We’ve both had to apologize for many things but if there’s one apology I want you to believe it’s this one. I am sorry for not telling you how your parents died and I am sorry you had to find out that way. Please believe me.”
The President is speaking but Tony’s not paying attention to his words.
He knows what Rhodey wants to say, the issues he will remind them of: the fact that the military and the authorities will most likely call for a trial, the mental state Clint’s in, the complications they’ve already encountered while trying to locate him because it’s not like they haven’t been trying. But Tony knows that’s not what Natasha needs to hear and he knows Natasha’s already more than aware about all those things.
“Um… I guess you do,” Steve responds as he swallows forcefully, pushing the strap of the gym bag he’s carrying up his shoulder so it doesn't fall down.
“Yeah. Everything seemed to happen so fast. Time…”  Steve scoffs. “Always my worst enemy.”
As Steve had planned, Sam’s head popped from behind another parked car and his friend was closely following Bucky’s movements, most likely waiting for him to be close enough to attack.
The touch of her lips on his feels more like a whisper than an actual kiss. It’s a balm that soothes his aches but it’s also a fire that inflicts different pain onto him.
“We need a better strategy.” proposed Steve. “We’ll never have a shot if we just run towards them blindly: Natasha is too quick and slippery and Sam pushes your buttons so hard that you just charge at him indiscriminately.”
It’s on his mind when he speaks to Pepper, either on video-conferences or through the phone. He thinks of his and Steve’s relationship becoming as stilted as his and Pepper’s became at the end. He thinks of breaking Steve's heart and Steve breaking his.
“I know,” Steve chuckles. “And I think you can tell I’m not okay either. I mean, the dramatic and hysteric laughter might have given it away, maybe.”
Natasha’s turn comes exactly 24 hours after Nebula’s visit to the recovery room.
“Steve,” Tony repeats, this time more an apology.
“I guess that would be convenient,” Steve considers. “But I already told you we’re not much of a team. And how would it benefit you?”
Tony, who was looking everywhere but at Steve, suddenly directs his gaze towards him and his manic energy comes to a halt.
Tony is in his workshop when Steve asks JARVIS about him. He hasn't had the opportunity to talk to Tony since the end of the fight and he wants to see if Tony will agree to try one more time to do something together, no matter how bad of a record they’re building.
“Let’s go win this war, Buck.”
Steve rereads the last text message five times, his fingerings hovering over the touch screen but not moving. He sits up and rests his back on the austere black bedpost so he’s reclined instead of completely laid down on the bed.
Steve’s voice brings everything back to a start when he says, “You’re right.”
And then there were two.
He’s still holding it when Steve laughs softly at him, more air than sound.
Pepper’s laugh is nothing more than air leaving through her nostrils and the corners of her lips curling up but it’s the first glimmer of hope Tony has seen in weeks.
_______________________________
Steve nods, acknowledging Tony’s response, but otherwise says nothing else. His body looks tense from Tony’s position and even though the lightning in the room is subtle Tony’s appraisal must be obvious to Steve, who fidgets under the scrutiny and crosses his arms. Tony stays silent as well, both because he stills feels the grip of darkness in his chest and because he wants Steve to be the one to break the tension.
) and then I went on vacation. I promise chapter five won't take me this long to post. It'll be here in a couple of weeks or so.
“I don’t think it will hurt,” Steve says. “Right now Clint is probably the one who can understand Thor best.”
However, he knows Steve finds comfort in touch when he’s had bad episodes like this so, forgetting all about killing charged moments and ignoring dangerous paths, he moves his stool closer to Steve’s and moves his arm around Steve’s shoulders.
“And Tony, this is not the time because I love you and now I have you back, but I’m also so angry.”
“And that’s a good thing, of course it is,” Tony says, keeping his voice calm even though Steve’s own tone is rising. “We
somehow drunk.
And day by day that’s what he works on doing.
Natasha’s voice is commandeering but somehow it is also soft, affection clinging to the edge of her words.
“I don’t think there is a way we can reverse the snap,” Tony repeats for the second time that afternoon although the sentence has been rattling around in his brain a million times in the past hour.
“It is,” Tony agrees, unsure of what else to add that would do the situation justice.
For a moment Tony thinks of cracking a joke, something about his twenties, about needing to keep up with her beauty, but his heart is not in it and he knows hers wouldn’t be either.
Steve, who -by his own confession- has never been one to cook, has taken to learning from anyone and anywhere and anything he can. Bruce is of great help to him and when cooking is done by the both of them together it normally involves some kind of foreign dish that Bruce fell in love with during one of his travels. Moroccan cuisine. Indian spices. Peruvian roasts. Tony knows he’s more well-travelled than 90% of the population in the world but he’s never felt as connected with other cultures as Bruce has always made sure to be.
Steve’s t-shirt hugs his torso perfectly, perhaps
“I dreamt about Peter,” he explains.
All his friends have turned their gazes to Steve who is still drinking unaffected. Tony looks at each of their faces, trying to solve the mystery, and he can't help but gasp when he finally realizes what they’re all looking at.
the Hulk.”
“I know,” Natasha confirms. “Thanks, Rhodey.”
Natasha and Bruce are a big part of their process as well and Tony finds that the little changes that happen within him ripple out to bring changes in the group dynamic. It’s easier to understand Natasha’s need for constant movement and it’s also easier to understand that there are days she can’t move at all. His anxiety about Bruce’s obsessive work into the Hulk and other super-powered projects gets more manageable and he even achieves having a conversation about it with him to point out his concerns.
“I’m hoping to be back in a week or so and I’ve made sure Rhodey can stay here during that time so you won’t be alone,” she says. “And anyway the rest of the team is also here, so…”
It’s Steve he takes down into his workshop, Steve he wakes up next to, Steve he cuddles into when the team settles into the common floor living room, Steve he is building a life with. And while doing so, Steve has made him feel comfortable wearing anything
“Yes, you are,” Steve and Pepper say at the same time.
It’s dark out and Tony’s eyesight is still suffering terribly from lack of oxygen but he can make out the shape of the Avengers Compound in front of him, a little blurry, a little distorted, but there.
“You just practically did it for me.”
Tony walks dragging his feet slowly to one of the kitchen chairs and sits down on it, placing his mug on the table and letting his head rest on it too, his body heavy and stiff, every cell of it feeling the 42 hours he has gone without sleep. He turns his wrists one way and then the other, curling and uncurling his fingers, trying to get rid of the numbness and tingles.
to him?
“Yes,” Steve exhales. “Yes, please.”
“But Tony,” Steve turns his body so that it isn’t facing forwards anymore but instead it’s now turned towards Tony, leaving their knees almost but not quite grazing each other. “I do know that I am sorry,
This time the assessment is about him and as unsettling as it feels he knows deep in his bones how true it is, how much Natasha has understood from the little glimpses Steve’s allowed her to have.
“I think it could be a good idea.”
Natasha finds Tony as he’s preparing dinner for himself one day. Steve called just minutes before to regretfully tell him he wouldn’t make it for the meal but he’d be bringing dessert over later. As his plans for the evening had evaporated Tony had opted to make a quick salad and plant himself in front of the TV to watch some mindless reality show.
“You do look a little wrecked, Captain,” Tony teases.
Tony huffs, “We’re going to try something alright, although we don’t know what. We just…. We have to try.”
He caresses Steve’s skin with his thumb, feeling the slight stubble that must have grown on Steve’s face since he shaved in the morning. It isn't exactly soft but it isn’t prickly, either. It’s definitely a pleasant sensation against Tony’s own skin, one that Tony doesn’t want to let go of yet.
“I never know how,” Steve confesses, his eyes tightly shut.
It’s been one year since the Decimation and the country still gives no signs of completely recovering.
Space and Afghanistan couldn’t be further apart and yet Tony feels like in the past 10 years he hasn’t actually moved at all, that he’s still that irredeemable man that lived his live without having made any positive impact on anyone.
“Steve, don’t. Don’t apologize for that. It’s nothing to be sorry for.”
“I don’t know either,” Natasha comments. “So I’m going to try and help on that front too.”
“This is the party you wanted so this is the party you get.”
“Are you sure?” Steve inquires.
For days after Tony feels guilty, worried about the way he phrased things, doubtful of whether he was in the right to push Thor like that. Tony knows better than most people what addiction can do to a person, what depression can make someone’s behaviors seem like to other people. There is a difference between making someone accountable for their actions and completely disregarding the nuisances their actions really entail.
Steve smiles sadly and nods. “I’m glad to hear that.”
“Well, it’s not like we can’t make the practice fun, right?” Steve asks and he, once again, rises to his knees, pulling his body away from Tony’s.
“Miss Potts brought them to the Tower after her last trip to Malibu,” JARVIS explains. “They were getting lonely over there and at least here she can visit them every once in a while.”
angry,” Steve says.
“Don’t…” Clint whimpers as he shakes his head erratically.
Tony gives a small shrug in reply, turning his head back to look across the lake once more instead of looking at Steve.
“Of course, Tony.” The woman steps out of the elevator and nears Tony, placing a delicate kiss on his forehead like she does Clint every time the archer is being particularly oblivious. She moves back into the elevator and instructs JARVIS to take her once again to the common floor.
They’re efficient and quick about it and only five minutes have gone by since they started the clean up.
Pepper visits them pretty early in the morning and they go to have lunch together, the three of them.
He realizes then that the hand he had moved before to Steve’s forearm is stilled placed there and he moves it away from Steve’s arm. He doesn’t want the contact to cease, however, so instead of pulling away completely he moves his hand to Steve’s cheek, cupping his face gently with it.
“Wait, when did the movie finish?”
Steve nods but he doesn’t tell her that, apart from the glimpses he’s got of them throughout the funeral, he hasn’t seen or talked to any of the other Avengers since the Battle of New York.
He lets go of Steve’s hand when he turns around to open the door to his bedroom and he walks inside, hoping Steve is following him in. He turns his head a little bit to check and is relieved to find Steve only a few steps behind him. Steve stops shortly to half-close the door behind him and turn up the brightness of the room through the switch next to the door before Tony has to ask FRIDAY to do it.
He’s doing a valiant effort of petting all of them while at the same time trying to salvage his t-shirt from the firm grip U has on it, but he quickly gives up on the second task and just lets the bot stretch it as far as it will go.
Tony can now see that the pants do, indeed, drag through the floor swallowing his feet, and that the shirt nearly falls from one of his shoulders.
“You’re so overly competitive it’s scary,” Rhodey explains calmly as he raises one of his eyebrows.
Tony’s
Still, Steve knows a good deal of Tony’s complaints are valid and true and he works hard to do better, to become more understanding and flexible, less demanding and controlling of things. Knowing Tony is aware of this part of Steve, the less than stellar part, is exciting in a way. It means Tony accepts him, likes him despite the parts of him that could do with a change.
Tony wondered, at first, if he had maybe been the only one who didn’t know. If Natasha had noticed it was certain that Barton had too, either because they had talked about it or because he was perceptive with things that mattered too. Recalling previous conversations and interactions, Tony had picked up on Bruce and Thor also making sly comments about it. But the one person who had never seemed to realize something was going on was Steve. Not even Tony’s time of “investigation” made Steve aware of it. (And they did really have sex while Tony was wearing one of Steve’s shirt, but the soldier never even hinted at it being weird or uncommon, although that could have had to do with Tony practically turning him stupid with a truly magical blow job.)
“That’s what the note says. It just says: ‘I’m leaving.’ And then it’s signed with Thor’s name.”
Sometimes Steve will sit next to his body, his legs stretched out before him as he sketches on his notebook. Sometimes Steve will gently coax him out of bed and move him to the couch in the living room, where Tony proceeds to lay down once again but this times surrounded by Steve, Natasha and Bruce too.
Steve opens his eyes quickly as he shakes his head, his face open and expressing his surprise.
Thanksgiving hadn’t even been mentioned once between the four inhabitants of the Compound, and as far as Tony’s aware, it was also largely ignored by the rest of the population of the States. It had been perhaps too soon for a holiday centered around finding things to be grateful for or maybe this is a new normal in the world they live in, where Thanksgiving will never make sense again until they find a way to give the world the one thing they would feel grateful for.
Steve nods because he remembers it perfectly well. That conversation precipitated all of his revelations about his feelings for Tony and it’s accompanied him through it all.
That translates into Tony and Steve constantly strategizing how to resolve their problem, how to get Thor back home, while Bruce and Natasha are a little more free to get a little irrational about it, a little too deep into their emotions of the issue.
Once he can see the message confirming that it has sent Steve types a message quickly to send after it.
Steve’s eyebrows raise at the comment and he purses his lips, his nod almost imperceptible.
“I know how that goes, believe me.”
Tony scoffs out a rueful laugh. “Yeah.”
Pepper insists Tony should get medically checked out even when Tony reassures her firmly that he’s perfectly fine, and, in an amazing display of her resourcefulness, a team of doctors appear in the building in less than ten minutes. All their tests and checking confirm Tony’s assessment and when they finally leave the premises Steve realizes how late it has gotten and deems it appropriate to leave Tony to rest after all the excitement of the day.
“I’m not sure.” Steve answers honestly.
There’s a certain amount of intimacy in it, as well. It’s learning a complete new side of Steve, one so raw and honest. Seeing it doesn't necessarily surprise Tony but it humbles him. Steve is such a good leader and Tony has never really forgotten about that but to see it in action when they’re not in a battlefield or handling Avengers business is mesmerizing.
“And then…” Tony states.
The kiss is modest but long, a sweet drag of lips. Tony pulls back and pecks Steve’s bottom lip and then his top one.
It was cold outside and Steve looked at Tony, who looked back at him when he felt watched. Steve blushed at being caught staring but he didn’t pull his gaze away.
“Would you mind, Steve?” she enquires.
When she’s about to leave the room, door handle in her hand and door already opened, she turns around and stares quizzically at him.
He was right before, too. She is being more open with him, more approachable and real, and it’s all a response to his own disposition.
When Steve sits next to him the bed hardly bounces, the mattress too hard for that. The space between their thighs is minimal and Tony feels it in his bones.
“Drink, Tony,” she gently demands. “Sip it slowly.”
It doesn’t take long for Tony to lay down on the mattress and sigh contently, his body already unwiring and recharging. He feels fingers running through his hair and he hadn’t even noticed his eyes had closed. He feels the pull of sleep, sinking him into oblivion, claiming him. Steve murmurs something that Tony can’t make out, and the last thing he feels are Steve’s lips pressing against his nose softly.
“Nat…” Tony pronounces but Natasha interrupts him.
Carol, Bruce, Rhodey, Steve, Natasha. Even Clint, sat in the corner nursing a beer, his eyes showing what seems to be the first trace of amusement in months. Clint who has lost so much more than is possible to conceive. They’re all so much more.
The smile she gives him now reminds him so much of one of the last smiles she gave him before the team split ways, sad but fond, small but warming.
“At first I had to reinforce my lab and my space because I knew things wouldn't go perfectly well the first few times,” Bruce explains. “It’s involved a little bit of everything, to be honest. I’ve furthered my meditation, I’ve worked on serums, I’ve tried so many forms of integration therapies by myself or via video-conferences with psychologists and expert. All I knew is that I needed to do this. There couldn't be a me and a Hulk anymore. There needed to be just me, Bruce Banner
“Well, what about me?” Steve asks because he’s certainly the least busy of all of them.
“I was just coming back from my routine run around the perimeter when I found this,” he says while extending his hand.
Bruce seems to be deep in thought for a few seconds as they all look at him. He’s been the one pushing the hardest for this to happen and he seems the closest to Thor out of everyone, no matter how little Tony knows about how that happened. It seems fair to defer to him in this matter but it also means it makes everyone feel more lost when he hesitates or doubts the options they have.
Nebula has moved her gaze back to the vast space in front of them and Tony takes that as a cue to do the same.
The minute Tony finds himself alone for the first time in the day he turns on the television and starts seeking the reactions of the world to the metaphorical bomb the Avengers have just dropped on it.
Before he sits down on the couch he gently picks up the sketchbook that’s sitting there and moves it towards a low coffee table next to the sofa. He sits down leaving enough space to his right so that Steve can sit down next to him if he chooses to, but he doesn't verbalize any request or offer to him.
The second message from Tony says, fortunately with words this time,
He has a thousand band shirts and ironic, sarcastic text shirts and formal shirts, and tank tops.
Natasha sighs and she puts a hand on Steve’s shoulder and then a hand on Tony’s elbow.
Steve frowns a bit and he follows Tony’s lead, making himself more comfortable in the unfamiliar bed. He spares a thought for how they both should go clean up if they don't want to wake up sticky with their own come tomorrow but he ends up deciding against it. It won’t be the first time and it won't be the last. It’s worth it if only to spend a few more minutes talking to Tony.
“Fine, I guess,” Tony says, mockingly resigned. “I’ll see you later, then.”
It’s Steve playing video games for the first time and becoming obsessed with Mario Kart, him always choosing Princess Peach and Tony always choosing Yoshi.
Tony loses consciousness before he can ask if that apology is meant only for today or if it covers any past indiscretions.
There are a few kinks and mishaps that Steve’s made sure to take note of to work on them in their next meetings and trainings, but having Tony with them really feels like it changes the stakes completely.
That’s how they fall asleep: holding hands, Tony laying on his back, Pepper laying on her stomach.
“I get it now,” he says, sounding a little defeated.
Tony himself tries to call Valkyrie and hatch a plan with her but his attempts are just as unsuccessful as Bruce’s. She’s prickly and cold towards him but he knows it’s not because of him and it’s just a testament of her personality. It might seem like she’s not trying to do much on the Thor front but Bruce has made sure they all know how much she’s been working with him and how difficult they’re both finding things.
“How about now?” Tony inquires and Steve goes back to looking at Tony’s eyes.
“You might be well enough to be out of bed now but I don’t think you’re fit for the journey to Malibu,” she declares.
They didn’t need to hear the other say it but they treasure it just the same.
It’s incredible how this is the first time Tony has seen Steve look so still. Of the two of them no one would think of Steve as the restless and anxious one, but the truth is Steve has just as much of a problem with being motionless as Tony. His eagerness is less obvious than Tony’s and it sometimes just comes across in the micro-movements of his face.
The faceless monsters get closer and closer to him, nipping at his heels, when suddenly they vanish into thin air and Tony finds himself at the Compound. It isn’t the Compound as it is now but the Compound as it used to be: greener, livelier, brighter. Tony walks around the inside of the main Compound buildings for a while, finding that every room is completely empty, only white walls and marble or wooden floors welcoming him in.
“I don’t want it to be true. I don’t want this to be the way things are,” Steve confesses and the words sound rough and low in his voice. “I’ve accepted that it isn’t our fault, my therapist can’t quite believe it but I have.”
“This is your workshop,” Steve states. “You can come down here whenever you want.”
It’s like a switch has been flicked on and the light is now illuminating every single part of Tony’s body that is in contact with Steve.
Tony has to take a two week-long trip to California for Stark Industries business but Steve keeps him updated on most thing that go on back in New York.
Instead the talk has opened Steve up in a way Tony couldn’t have predicated. It’s like Steve’s ribcage has been forced open and Tony can see inside him without Steve’s consent.
Steve finishes the last of the wine that was on his glass and moves to take the bottle from the table to serve himself some more.
Tony doesn’t need Steve to confirm what it’s obvious to him now: he’d been feeling guilty for refusing back the shield. He’d been feeling guilty for not taking back Captain America. Steve had put
Tony wasn’t surprised when he heard Steve say I love you before, and Steve isn’t surprised to hear Tony say it now.
Tony starts taking deep breathes and prompting Steve to do the same.
Steve’s super-hearing must be letting him know that Tony is still standing there, right outside his field of vision, stuck and paralyzed making no moves to join him or walk away.
“It was kind of like when I watched you exit the plane after Afghanistan,” Pepper laughs, a humorless sound.
_______________________________
Compared to his previous erratic state watching him go back to the stiffness and the pause is jarring to Tony, that has to pay close attention to Steve’s eyelids to make sure he’s still blinking and he hasn’t just spontaneously turned into some kind of hyper-realistic statue.
Tony had been surprised, at the time, about Natasha’s siding with him, not so much because of the cause he was preaching for but because it was Steve defending the other side of it and Tony could have never predicted Natasha standing by his side and not by Steve’s.
But there are no jokes, just a closed bedroom door he needs to open and a man he needs to face.
Pepper is set to leave really early in the morning, so early in fact some people would say she’s leaving late at night.
All eyes turned to him and Bucky mouthed, “Are you okay?” at him so only he could see him do it but Steve could only focus on the man, whose eyes were now caught in Steve’s.
Everything becomes better and worse when Tony starts to feel Steve’s chest move against his back. It starts shaking and shaking and shaking. Steve’s grip is so forceful that Tony can’t turn around to look at him. It’s only when a huge burst of laughter resonates around the room that Tony understands.
The times that are the worst, though, are the times when he catches a quick glance of Steve through a window, or their paths nearly cross walking different directions in a hallway, or he encounters various things that remind him that Steve is here and yet he’s not here with Tony at all.
He doesn’t do this because he believes he needs to protect one from the other in the slightest but because he understands the difficulty and complexity of the situation. Natasha and Rhodey are friends and because of this Rhodey feels for her and empathizes with her hurt, but he’s been to the places Ronin’s been in and, no matter what, he’ll always be a military man through and through.
Steve smiles at him. “See you later, then.”
But Steve doesn't move to go. Instead, he turns his body around to face Tony again.
Holidays, birthdays, anniversaries and any and every kind of special occasion haven’t found their place yet in the world they’re all now living in.
But she’s crying, quietly but heartily, and the pressure on the left side of the bed he’s lying in tells him, without having to open his eyes, that she’s got her head and probably her arms resting on it.
“That’s what Sam used to call it,” Steve explains. “Natasha said it was just an above-average kept lumberjack beard, though.”
No one comes to his door, no one walks into his room, no one checks on him. Not even Steve.
The battle is over but he’s still a leader and it’s his duty to make sure even the people that didn’t make it get the respect they deserve.
At the same time Bruce had brought forth his deep worries about Thor and the idea to try and connect with him again to bring him to the Compound and so, even if they were concerned about Ronin, they had had to put that aside and they started developing their plan to bring Thor back to them.
Bruce ships off to India with one of the charities he used to work with for a couple of weeks.
It’s easier than his friendship with Rhodey. Easier than his one-sided conversations with the bots.  Easier than playing around with ideas for new technology. Easier than getting lost on a new project. Easier than wanting to change the world.
“That’s all I really want. I want us to try together,” Steve concludes.
I hope this chapter brings you all a little bit of much needed joy.
Taking his right hand out of his pocket Steve brings it over to the top of his head and makes a few abortive movements as if he wants to run it through his hair or touch the back of his neck or scratch at his chin, before lowering it again and putting it back into the pocket.
Other times their being together is the product of carefully organized planning: shared dinners when their schedules -mostly Natasha’s, Bruce’s and Steve’s- allow it, movie nights where none of them pay much attention to the actual movie,…
“Tony?” Steve asks. “You used to help Tony with… this?”
Bucky’s body was lost somewhere in a mountain just as Stark’s body is now lost somewhere up in space, floating aimlessly and with no way of ever being returned home.
That’s the thing with long-lasting grief you have to carry around with you for a long time: at first it feels monumental and deserving of its own days of remembrance and ceremony, but as it gets to become a part of you it stops having its own special days to instead accompany you during the mundane ones.
Steve clears his throat and brings a hand up to rub at the back of his neck.
She’s walked towards his bed and she’s leaning into him without applying too much pressure to his chest or the rest of his body. She kisses his forehead gently and brushes a lock of hair away from the corner of his eye.
Cooking was what he did when he wanted to impress Pepper, or relax her, or treat her to something special.
It is, without a doubt, the biggest and most important of his safe spaces.
“You know,” Pepper says as they’re walking back into the Tower. “I never would have believed we could grow this close if you had told me only a few months ago.”
“Don’t let Bruce know I gave you that,” she warns. “And if you feel like puking aim away from me.”
Tony stops walking when he’s standing right in front of Steve, almost right between the V that his thighs form.
“Time…” Tony murmurs.
“I just didn’t want to be butting in on something that was none of my concern,” Steve admits a little sheepishly. “But… I’m proud of you, Tony.”
“There’s just so much to do around here,” Valkyrie explains, referring to the establishment of New Asgard. “We don’t have time to take care of him. And he’s not much help either so… I think he’d be better off with you.”
This kind of moments -moments charged with some kind of meaning Tony isn’t ready to decipher yet- have been happening a lot lately between them since Tony’s birthday and Tony is elated and terrified at the same time. There’s power in their interactions and there’s fire in them too but power and fire are potentially destructive and Tony is at a point in his life where risking the things that are important to him isn’t something he’s willing to do.
And then he walks out of the room.
“Well, well, well,” Tony greets as he slices a tomato, quickly glancing Natasha’s way before focusing back on the task. “Look who graces me with her presence.”
Steve starts moving towards the couch, a little hesitantly, Tony notices. He sits down very close to to the left armrest, leaving ample space between his body and Tony’s. It feels cold and wrong to Tony but he doesn’t push the issue and he remains seated where he is.
Tony swallows under the weight of Steve’s stare.
They both lost one of their best friends and Steve wouldn’t wish that kind of grief on anyone in the world but he feels envious because, in the end, they can share their pain with each other. Meanwhile, Steve’s all alone.
“No, I think you were right,” Tony concedes. “I wasn’t in my right mind and I realize now that you weren’t either. We needed our space.”
“He’s staying,” Bruce says, speaking for the first time. He sounds placating and sure, and Tony knows he’s been waiting for an opportunity like this for over a year now.
I hope you can forgive me for how long it has been.
3AM thrusts him violently into sleep, between one breath and the next. It’s not gradual or ordered, it’s surprising and new every time. The last time he calmly went into Morpheus’ arms was back in the recovery room, when his body had no choice but to succumb to oblivion based on how tired it was. Since then it’s been like a battle between all of his neurons to see which one can knock him out in the most vigorous way possible.
The air is cool and it drizzled throughout the day so a slight dampness hangs in the air but Steve feels perfect in his long-sleeved button down, his elbows resting on the railing of the balcony, his eyes roaming around the streets as far as his eyes can see.
“You’ve been telling me all about Clint, and Thor, and the whole issue with Nat and Bruce. What’s up with you and Steve, man?” Rhodey inquires.
“Truth is I don’t really know what’s up with me and Steve,” Tony ends up confessing. He incorporates slowly on his seat again, this time resting his chin on the palms of his hands. “It’s complicated.”
“Natasha sent me to fetch you,” Steve announces. “Are you ready?”
They’re both laying down on bed, Steve’s back against the mattress and Tony perched on his lap, his thighs to both sides of Steve’s hips. Tony is still wearing his suit pants and Steve has a pair of sweatpants on, so the contact between their lower bodies is happening through four layers of clothing but it still feels magnificent.
“Yes, Tony,” Steve responds, his voice sounding mocking again. “Not everything is about you all the time.”
“I’m not sure,” Bruce admits.
“Sure he is,” he replies, sarcasm dripping from his every word. “That’s why he’s here asking the question and not you.”
Tony doesn’t need to hear the answer to know what it will be. It’s written all over Steve’s face.
A whole, entire year.
Pepper was absolutely right: Tony really was good with kids.
“You sure?” Tony asks, although every cell in his body is in flight mode already.
It gives Tony the last burst of strength and clarity he needs to sort through his mangled thoughts, even if not completely.
Tony’s reiterated Natasha’s words since then and he’s asked Steve to back down countless times since Steve decided he would speak at the memorial for the one year anniversary of the Decimation.
But the desire had still been there through it all:
They make love twice and Tony’s not sure how to explain that the first time felt like a farewell and the second time felt like coming back home.
He wakes to the sound of a spaceship’s engine turning on and for a second he wonders if he dreamt his return home, but the feeling of the mattress under his body confirms everything was real. He’s still alone and he doesn’t need to open his eyes to verify it.
“Maybe…” Bruce starts. “Maybe you’ll get back together?”
The differences in his own person.
Rhodey is the first to come by his room and although neither of them cry while talking about what happened when the rest of the group went in search of Thanos, they envelop each other in a hug that lasts so long Tony loses all sense of time. Rhodey stays there and he tries to get Tony to talk about what his own experience was like when he had to face Thanos.
Tony just nods because he, better than anyone, understands.
Immediately, Barton bursts out laughing and even though Natasha throws grapes at his head trying to get him to stop, some chuckles escape her mouth too. Bruce is wearing a sheepish grin and Thor’s own smile is one of pure delight.
Tony moans delightfully, playing it up for Rhodey and making him laugh. Tony then grabs the cookie Rhodey is still holding for him and this allows Rhodey to take sit back down across from Tony and grab his own cookie.
“Everything okay?” he asks Natasha as he’s reaching them.
Because of how hard he’s concentrating on just Steve Tony catches Steve’s eyes as soon as Steve turns his head towards him. Their gazes lock and Tony has to swallow harshly and will himself not to blush too strongly at being caught staring. Based on the heat he can feel building up on his cheeks he knows it doesn’t work.
There’s— And it was there before but— The lack of oxygen, maybe, but no there really —
_______________________________
“Well thanks, Steve,” Tony says. “That was useful.”
He doesn’t know about Happy, and Bruce, and Natasha, and Hill, and Fury. He doesn’t know if Thor ever made it to Earth alive. And what about Clint, and Sam, and Wanda? He doesn’t know about anyone in the world right now.
As Tony follows he can see his made bed and he takes notes of a couple of things around the room: one of Steve’s winter jackets thrown across an armchair, a drawer that’s only half shut, Steve’s phone left charging on his bedside table… It’s not the first time Tony’s been inside Steve’s room but they don’t tend to spend their time together on their bedrooms so it still kind of feels like novelty to be allowed here at all.
What a foreign word.
I hope you enjoy this third chapter.
Tony turns on the coffee machine as he blearily blinks and looks around the kitchen, trying to discern if anyone has already used it this morning before him or if everyone is still asleep. It’s difficult to tell for sure but Tony thinks he’s the first one up. He chuckles to himself and shakes his head at the unexpected turn of events. When he had gotten out of bed he had been cursing his years and his body for betraying him so rudely but it must say something positive about his stamina and resilience that out of everyone he shares a house with he’s still the one who picks himself up first after a mild-mannered party.
Steve is about to respond when Thor’s voice interrupts him.
But she tells them Steve and her decided to attend some of the memorials being held that night and by sharing a single glance Bruce and Tony both know neither of them are up for that much yet.
“Maybe you will but I know I won’t,” Steve corrects him, opening he cutlery drawer and grabbing two tablespoons.
“Better now,” he rasps.
“Peter was… He was an anomaly,” Tony explains.
He’s been told it’s because he inspires people, moves them to action and ignites a flame in them. Sometimes he thinks it’s because people are trying to impress him, because they think causing a good impression in Captain America will give them points in life. Other times he thinks it’s because people are maybe afraid of him, that they’re terrified if they don’t meet the standards they believe Captain America has he will retaliate against them.
He tries to find the right words to say to each of the remaining Avengers and, overall, he thinks he doesn't do too badly. Thor smiles at him. Romanoff gives him a nod -which might be an even bigger achievement-. Barton is still too in his head to even acknowledge him and Banner is lost looking into space so Steve just walks silently past where he’s sitting.
This time Steve’s laugh is complete, not just a breathe of air, but a full, booming sound.
Tony moves his left arm carefully, the one he doesn't have pressed down into the beanbag. He extends it until his hand is hovering just inches away from Steve’s face. Nothing in Steve’s expression hints at any sign of unease so Tony lowers his hand slowly until it cups the side of Steve’s face, his cheek.
“I’m glad, though,” Pepper remarks. “It’s been a good surprise.”
Because if there’s one thing Bruce and him are going to try is to solve this with science. They might have both accidentally become superheroes during their unfortunate lives but they’re still first and foremost scientists. They couldn’t win this or solve this by calling upon their powers so they might have to use their knowledge.
Feeling off-balance Tony takes a step back and drops Steve’s hand. His arm searches for a solid grip on something but his legs give out from under him before he can find support and he hits the floor hard, pain radiating from every nerve in his body.
Steve shrugs and focuses his gaze on his feet.
The dial tone goes on and on and on until the voice on the other end on the line is telling him to leave a message after the tone. He hesitates and thinks about hanging up but he takes a deep breath and starts talking as soon as the beep informs him to.
Tony furrows his brow as he walks back over to Steve and hands him his drink. As he retakes his seat next to him Steve continues explaining.
It’s been two weeks since the break up with Pepper and every day it gets easier for Tony, it really does, but Rhodey had expressed his need to check for himself, too used to Tony telling him he was fine when in fact he wasn’t.
Tony had kind of stopped asking, and even so, here was Natasha with an answer for him: No. They would fail, because what things didn't fail in life? And, moreover, what things didn’t fail in life for Tony? And in the end, he would lose a lot more than what he’d temporarily gained. He’d lose all of Steve. Or if not all then most.
“Well, it’s egocentric to think you can do this on your own. And by this I mean
Tony doesn’t blame him.
“I have to go to SHIELD now,” Steve states. “But I’ll be back for lunch. I know Rhodey’s still here and maybe… We could have lunch. You, me, Pepper and Rhodey. Together. I could apologize to them too for these past few weeks.”
Steve isn’t actually the one to tell Miss Potts or Colonel Rhodes the news about Stark’s death.
He finds himself unable to tear his eyes away from his and Tony’s hand, looking so normal as they rest on the table between the two of them. It’s not the first time Tony has grabbed Steve’s hand and held on to it for a long period of time. Steve has learned since Tony’s comeback just how touchy and affectionate he can be. But it is the first time Tony has done it in front of other people and Steve’s brain is already giving the action a thousand possible meanings.
It’s on his mind when he goes to bed but can’t fall asleep. He thinks of nights alone after fights, or nights alone after an inevitable break-up. He thinks about having to learn to tolerate the empty space next to him on the bed after having gotten to know the shape of Steve on his mattress.
“I don’t have an answer for us and I bet every single person on Earth has asked themselves this at least once,” Tony says. “We didn't choose this. No one did. And we’ve tried to remedy it but… Maybe it’s time for new questions. They’ll be even harder to answer but I think it’s time.”
“Me too, Tony,” she says. “But for what it’s worth, I’m glad you’re one of the people I still have here.”
Steve’s own hand comes up towards his chest to grasp Tony’s and the physical contact seems to relax him a bit. His shoulders unclench and he releases a big gulp of air through his mouth.
Natasha is the first one who notices because…. Well, because…. Because she is
“I never wanted the Accords. God, did I not want them, “ Tony declares. “But I needed them.
Tony brings his hand up to Steve’s cheek, who turns his head and delivers a kiss to the palm.
Finally, the two of them separate from the hug but Rhodey keeps his hands on Tony’s shoulders.
Before he can even begin to spend too much time thinking about it Christmas Eve arrives and it becomes all that Tony can actually ponder about.
Tony made a
He tries to push away all these thoughts daily, especially during the times when Tony is mentioned, alluded to or in any way somehow present in his life. Steve hadn't notice before but, without actually ever being there, Tony has been such a big part of Steve’s last for the past few months that now Steve can go a few hours without being reminded.
It happened at the Compound when Steve’s birthday came around and he, very gently but also extremely firmly, asked them to not say anything about it. The world had seemed to agree with him when a normally very festive 4th of July became a subdued event all over the country. There were certainly events trying to install hope and joy in people but they were small definitely very nostalgic. There were no fireworks that Tony saw the whole day and he was grateful for that.
Steve places his elbows over his knees and lets his head hang forward, only supported by his hands tangling in his hair.
Tony knows deflation and avoidance pretty well when he sees them, almost as though he invented them, and he hasn’t wanted to push Bruce too much, especially when he knows Natasha is the one who could be more successful than anyone at bringing Bruce out of any funk, and even she hasn't had any luck yet.
Steve extends his arms, offering the clothes to Tony.
“The only difference is that I had you next to me to get to know you personally,” Tony says. “But if you hadn’t been there? I don’t think there’s any possibility I wouldn't have fallen either way. So thank you for your honesty but it won’t be a problem for me going forward. Will it be for you?”
“Together, maybe?” Tony ventures. “I really have no idea.”
It’s nothing like practicing with Rhodey was even though Steve has taken note of all the similarities between both armors. It’s incredible how much the differences between both men account for the way the armors move and react.
“So you’ve noticed I’ve kinda been… avoiding some things, huh?”
His voice is muffled by the pillow and he’s pretty sure no human would have ever been able to understand a single thing of what he said but it’s proof of his genius that his AI makes out perfectly fine what Tony had pronounced.
“What?”
But deep down he knows Steve is right and this won’t only be good for them, but for the people who get to see them. Like it or not they’re still symbols that the world follows and though there isn’t much he can do to help nowadays maybe this one small act will calm down the relentlessness inside him, that one voice that whispers he could be doing more.
Bucky shuddered, “Oh, god, you’re right.”
Legacy. What a word.
They stay in comfortable silence together for the better part of an hour.
Through the haze of sleepiness Tony hears Steve’s voice but he’s not sure if it came from the man himself or from a dream Tony’s brain is already conjuring up.
“I’m guessing they have to do with me,” Steve says, and it isn’t a question but a total affirmation.
haunts him, eats him up inside until all he can think about is how he would gladly give up ever getting to see and hear Peter again if it just meant he was alive.
Tony can’t unsee it now, it’s everything he can focus his attention on. It’s maddeningly distracting.
“Trying to cope by drinking his weight in alcohol? Yeah, I know a thing or two about that,” Tony says.
“You… You should go check on her,” Tony tells Steve after Bruce has left, his eyes focused on the direction of Natasha’s room.
Natasha moves with determination to place herself a couple of feet away from Clint, forcing him to face her instead of the couch where Steve and Tony are seated. Her shoulders are tense and the set of jaw looks almost painful with how heard she must be clenching it.
Steve turns his head to the left to look at Tony and finds him already staring at him. Something in Tony’s eyes keeps Steve from wondering what’s happening out loud.
He stays there, in Pepper’s arms, for what feels like an eternity but is actually no time at all. His tears are dampening Pepper’s sweater’s shoulder but her tears are also dampening his t-shirt so there’s no judgement to be made.
When the TV flickers off he finds himself thrown in the middle of the darkness. The sun has disappeared from the sky in the time Tony was too transfixed by watching TV to notice anything else going on around him.
A cheerful picture or video of a dog doing something funny and sweet.
He spent an hour sitting in the low kitchen light searching for an answer. He’s spent the last few months searching for an answer, if he’s really going to be honest. It still hasn’t come to him.
But it’s difficult to not let it consume him completely when things like this nightmare happen. Tony debates getting out of bed, reaching for his phone and calling his psychologist to see if she’s available that day but his body stays in bed while his mind wanders off.
None of that means Tony makes it any easier for him, most times.
“Bucky,” Steve finishes for him.
During this time Tony has only been staring at the wall, unmoving and practically unseeing, and yet so attuned to Steve’s demeanor.
Steve has to almost carry Thor inside, the man stumbling every few feet and smelling of beer, grease and sweat. He’s mumbling uselessly all the way to the living room, where Steve drops him not too carefully on the couch.
“Tony,” Pepper pronounces again. “Can I ask you something?”
_______________________________
Fear has always made Tony bolder, more prone to spectacle to cover up his vulnerabilities in front of other people, but this time fear is making him silent, because everything where Steve is concerned has a way of surprising Tony like that.
“It isn't that,” Tony assures him. “I know how you feel about me just like you know how I feel about you.”
He sounds breathless and Steve feels a jolt of pride at the knowledge that it was his doing.
Natasha goes silent for a few seconds and then takes a deep breath, making Tony think she’s going to continue speaking, but she doesn’t. She stays next to the counter, her glass almost empty now and her gaze somewhere faraway, somewhere that Tony doesn't know if he can reach.
So he stays silent, not inciting any challenge, and he lets Steve take the lead on this because he won’t be the one giving Steve the fight he seems to be preparing for.
Steve’s voice is soft and it pulls a smile from Tony in just a second.
But he does love running them through his head frequently.
_______________________________
_______________________________
It’s been over a year since he proposed to her in what was one of their greatest periods of time together.
Her hand finds his again and although they don’t intertwine their fingers they hold on to each other, they hold on to each other tight. Maybe too tight.
“So, what is it that you’re saying?” Steve asks. “Or proposing?”
Through all of this Tony keeps quiet, watching her and grabbing bites of the salad that’s still on his plate every few seconds.
It takes Tony about 15 seconds to follow Steve and in that short time he feels a hope he had thought long gone by now, because if something like him and Steve can be salvaged and remade into something much better maybe this world- this broken shell of a world- has a chance after all.
“You know you could have asked JARVIS to tell me you were there, right?” Tony asks.
_______________________________
From the corner of his eye Tony spots Rhodey moving towards him once again but he puts a hand up to stop him.
And so is the day after.
“I was just thinking about what that would have been like,” Rhodey explains. “Tony and us.”
“No, I meant the comment, I didn’t—” Tony stops himself in the middle of the sentence, opting to move on from the explanation he was trying to give. He wishes there was something else he could do but he knows there isn’t any escaping this conversation or this situation now. The time has come to face it head on. “I’m sorry”
Bruce looks towards the direction Clint took. “You really think it will help? We don’t even know what he’s going to say.”
“Yeah,” Tony confirms with a small nod of his head. “But that’s not really what I came here to talk about.”
The first thing Steve takes notice of when his lips touch Tony’s is how soft they are. The second is how right the kiss feels.
Tony feels a shudder all the way from his neck to his toes. Hearing Steve so out of breath feels empowering, both because it’s so much more difficult to get a super-soldier like that and because it’s Steve that’s panting because Tony’s kissing him.
Tony feels restless with the need to follow Steve, to catch up with him and help in anyway he can.
“I lost the kid.”
Natasha’s eyes move from his head to his feet, one time and then another. She clicks her tongue and smirks.
And he believes her. He has always believed her.
It started out so real that Tony genuinely thought it true for the first few beats of it.
Tony wonders in amazement if there will ever come a day when this man won’t manage to surprise him anymore. He’s not perfect, Tony knows he’s nowhere near that, but he tries so hard, and he gives everything he’s got to the things he deems worthy. Tony can’t quite comprehend the luck he’s had that Steve’s decided he’s one of those worthy causes, but he won’t ever take it for granted.
Pepper finishes her wine glass and tops it off again before motioning Steve to pick up his untouched one.
Steve stays silent for a few seconds and his face is so blank Tony can’t read him at all.
The first two weeks of July move like that: slowly but surely and with no significance whatsoever. It’s life in its purest form: always happening around us and for us and with us.
Steve’s words are careful and a little ambiguous but in their circumstance there is no mistaking or misunderstanding them: he is promising the world they’ll fix the Decimation.
“So?” Tony asks, his eyebrows raised in inquiry.
“I’ll be in my office. Come get me when you finish,” Steve tells him as he looks up at him.
Steve laughed abashedly, “Yeah, before I did that.”
When his eyes clear he sees Steve take an aborted step forward, his right arm outstretched as if prepared to catch Tony before he can fall to the floor. When Steve sees Tony is steady again he resumes his previous position and his face closes-off again.
Realizing he’s been lost in thought for at least a couple of minutes and seeing Steve watching him intensely, Tony clears his throat and gestures towards the TV.
Steve stays behind a little longer to deal with the press and some civilians, all in the way Pepper, him and a team of Stark Industries’ professionals have discussed and planned for a while.
“Maybe,” Tony answers. “But not exactly. It’s more like I feel rested.”
There’s no other way to say it but by saying that Tony simply gives up. He gives up his stupid anger over being known and understood and recognized. He gives up trying to pretend he hasn’t grown to need Steve again. He gives up trying to pretend like he ever stopped needing him.
“I’m going to take Natasha out for the day,” Bruce says. “I think she needs the break.”
“I probably should have said this a while ago but better late than never right?”
Natasha is trying to hide her crying face but her proximity to Tony and the desperate grip her hands have on the back of his suit jacket mean she’s not trying to hide completely from him.
Family means more when it’s all of them together, especially. When it’s not just one or two of them that Steve and him get to be around, but when it’s all of them sharing time.
By now they’ve learnt how to perform the dance around each other perfectly and it takes them only a couple minutes to pick up the cutlery and dishes, put them in the dishwasher, store any leftovers there have been on the fridge and clean the table. They’re doing it in a comfortable silence today and Natasha grazes Tony’s elbow lightly when they finish.
“Remember that time at a charity event when Tony spent more than an hour flying kids around on the suit?” Rhodey asks, his voice sounding heavier than before. “He wouldn’t go higher than a couple inches from the ground but the kids went crazy.”
It’s somewhat ironic and completely morbid that now that Tony feels like he’s got the family he always envisioned the Avengers to be that had to come at the expense of Clint’s own family.
Tony sighs and he drops his spoon to fold his arms over the kitchen island and rest his head on them. His cheek is resting on his forearm and the position allows him to keep looking at Rhodey.
The screen of his phone goes black as Steve stares at it and when he presses the home button the image of his lock screen appears on it. It’s a picture of Tony, as it has been since the very first day they started dating. This one is relatively new, though. Steve took it a couple of weeks ago during Natasha’s birthday party at the Tower. Tony is smiling and looking at someone off-screen and he looks so radiant that every time Steve sees the picture a wave of warmth spreads from the top of his head to the tip of his toes.
_______________________________
Steve takes a deep breath.
“What time is it, FRIDAY?”
This is nothing like he could have imagined before, nothing he would have guessed even if given plenty of time to wonder about it.
Steve fills the liquid go down the wrong pipe and he starts coughing vehemently, his eyes filling up with tears of discomfort.
“I love you,” Steve says, a little breathless. Short and concise. So honest it’s almost painful. “I’ve loved you for quite some time now.”
Three weeks of just Tony and Europe for their six-month anniversary.
Steve seeks Tony out as Natasha and him are clearing the table after dinner is done.
The twenty-first century and Tony are so thoroughly intertwined in Steve’s mind that he can’t think of one without thinking of the other and it has to do in part with how so many of his new memories have Tony at the center of them and how many of the world’s new wonders have been introduced to him by Tony.
“And Peggy’s death before that,” Steve says. “Something that should have been about logic and reasoning got overshadowed by the fact that… Fuck, Tony, I was not in a good mental state.”
“It’s been twenty-three days since Thanos came to Earth,” Steve is saying, but everything sounds remote and hollow to Tony, like he’s still back in the spaceship, thousands and thousands of miles away while the remaining Avengers are having this conversation.
Mental health is complex like that, Tony knows. It doesn't absolve us of our actions, most of the time, but it can’t be ignored or taken out of a conversation because it
Tony has never been one to look for the positive side of things in the worst of situations but if there’s only one single thing that he could feel grateful for in this terrible ordeal is the fact that he now knows these people better than he probably does himself.
“I just didn’t want to leave without saying goodbye.”
Steve chuckles and Tony bites his lip even though he knows there is no way to hide the big smile that has already overtaken his face.
But as time continues to pass Tony thinks they’re all going to have to open their eyes to the reality of things: there are consequences they can’t avoid whether this gets solved or not,
“Tony.”
And they were. At least he really was.
“Yeah.”
It’s such a silly thing to love but it fills Steve with joy to carry around his cellphone in his pocket at all times knowing he could take it out of his pocket at any moment and snap thousands upon thousands of pictures of anything he wanted to commemorate. It warms him up inside to know he could capture himself with a truly breathtaking sunset behind him and send the picture to Tony to remind him he’s always thinking of him.
Steve’s had a head start but he’s going to make sure from now on he and Tony will only run side by side.
A torment.
Tony blinks slowly a few times trying to process Steve’s words correctly. “You… You want me to come in?”
He’s learnt not to blame himself for all the weeks, months and years he let pass before he fully embraced all the aspects of his existence and accepted the enveloping happiness that he now has and would never in a million years let go of.
Tony is no longer hesitating and he’s now claiming Steve’s mouth as his own. His tongue is inside Steve’s mouth and it’s tangling with Steve’s own tongue, then running through the back of Steve’s teeth, then Tony’s moving back and caressing Steve’s lips with it, making everything feel sensual and passionate.
Natasha rolled her eyes but smiled softly, “Tony, this is Steve. Steve, this is Tony.”
As his last word leaves his mouth Tony rips his arc reactor from his chest and Steve takes an abortive tiny step forward, his face twisting in an expression of complete horror as if for just a second he had forgotten that Tony didn’t need it anymore to survive.
Bruce puts the cap back on the water bottle and deposits it next to Tony. He then stands up, making Tony have to tilt his neck so he can continue to look at him. Bruce starts unbuttoning the first buttons of his shirt and once he’s undone three of them he takes his shirt off without unbuttoning the rest. He holds out his hand towards Tony, his shirt gripped loosely on his hand, and Tony moves to take it, dropping it on his lap.
And now, nearly a year after what he can consider his family moved in with him
“I would love for you to fuck me,” Tony states and Steve gasps lowly. “But I’ve seen your dick before, sweetheart, and I think I need some training for it.”
“So many times I’ve thought that we could turn this around, that we were meant to,” Steve explains. “I mean, we’re still here, Tony.”
Having Tony back has shifted a lot Steve’s perspectives and priorities, including the way he wants the Avengers to work now.
Tony drops Steve’s hands hastily and he spots the confusion and slight hurt on Steve’s face before he realizes what Tony’s doing. Tony stands up from his chair and he makes his way around the table, pushing at Steve’s shoulders when he reaches him so he’ll leave enough space between his chair and the table so Tony can sit on his lap.
“It’s okay, Pepper,” Steve mumbles, making his way towards the door. “I was just leaving.”
Steve laughs. “It’ll be my pleasure.”
Yes, the Decimation is something the whole world shares. But no, it’s not the same for everyone. It’s definitely not the same for them.
“Damn Wilson.” cursed Bucky as he hid behind the parked car again, his hair a wet, dripping mess. Steve was trying hard not to laugh at the picture his best friend painted.
The shape is a woman. The light is a woman and she smiles.
Tony doesn't think he has to remind Bruce of some of their unorthodox experiments and the problems they had brought.
He’s helped Pepper and Steve during many Avengers’ business meetings. He’s researched many pop culture phenomena to point Steve into the direction of what he believes Steve will enjoy. He’s proven himself useful time and time again reminding Steve of little and big stuff all the time.
Tony’s lived through more than forty New Year’s Eve. Some of them he can’t remember because he was too young when they happened. Some of them he can’t remember because he got too drunk and sometimes even too high. Some of them were spent surrounded by hundreds of people, some of them were spent on his own and in a few lucky ones he got to spend the night with people he truly loved and who loved him back.
Natasha, Steve and Tony. Together and thinking about their pasts, their presents and their futures.
Before Tony can start overthinking things and come to incorrect conclusions -because Steve knows him and he knows this will happen if he doesn't do something to stop it- Steve places both of his hands on Tony’s cheeks and captures Tony’s lips with his own again. The action is a little bit selfish because Steve isn't sure how Tony will react to what he’s going to tell him next.
It’s 9:35PM when Natasha, Steve, Tony and Pepper all say their goodnights and goodbyes.
“Hello, Miss Potts. It’s Steve. I mean, Captain Rogers. I… I was calling to see if we could set up that meeting that you wanted to? I know you must be very busy so I can work my schedule around your needs. I… I will be waiting for your call. Or a message. Just… Let me know. Thank you and have a good day.”
“Cap?”
It’s so easy that sometimes Tony can almost forget they were ever not dating in the first place.
“There will need to be further action about this, Natasha,” Rhodey’s hologram says during one of his meetings with the habitants of the Compound minus Clint himself. “I told you this already. I’ll try to delay it as much as I can but… It will happen.”
Steve was the one to volunteer even though Natasha told him there was no need for him to do it.
“I mean, normal things are going on. We’re close, we’ve become close, you know that. Normal close. Like best friends. Not you and I level of best friends because that’s sacred but best friends,” Tony blabbers and he curses himself silently the more he says  without meaning to.
It doesn’t take much effort to start bringing them all closer together and Tony’s presence helps a lot more than Steve could have even imagined, and he already thought Tony had been the missing piece they had been missing all along.
“That’s my business card and you’ve got my cell number in there,” she informs him. “I would love to meet to speak more in a different setting.”
“Careful,” Steve warns as he gets quickly and gracefully to his feet.
He’s been holding onto unfounded expectations and they’ve all just shattered in his hands from how tightly he was squeezing them.
Tony thinks about the question and realizes that while any other night the response would be an affirmative, this once he had just lost track of time. To tell Steve the truth would mean talking about how much his conversation with Natasha has really affected him. To tell Steve the truth would mean talking about this, whatever this is, whatever it is that it’s building between them and that can’t Tony can’t help but rethink over and over again.
Even though it’s Steve who’s in Tony’s recovery room, and even though Tony’s confined to this stupid bed, and even though he’s the one who just now woke up, he can’t help but feel like he’s intruding in an intimate moment that does not belong to him.
_______________________________
, Steve thinks.
Steve is still not looking at him but a movement rakes through his whole body and Tony realizes it was Steve letting out a deep breath. His hands shake and his lips tremble a little but when he finally looks up at Tony his eyes look clear and focused, his face bright, as if he’d just gotten rid of a torturous pain that had been clawing him up inside for so long.
“Hey, hey,” Tony interrupts her. “This is important, Pepper. So many people depend on Stark Industries and we need to know what’s the situation.”
The sight that greets him as soon as he arrives is highly familiar and very similar to the one he had been staring at only hours ago during the memorial.
Natasha brings one of her hands up to his cheeks and she feels the stubble he hasn’t shaved while caressing him gently.
“Steve?”
“JARVIS, who’s around?”
Steve’s brain conjures up a perfect rendition of the sounds Tony makes when Steve leaves any kind of semi-permanent mark on his body. Steve is not the only one who enjoys his slight possessive kink and Steve knows Tony would be bringing his head back to grant Steve an easier access to his neck. However, that’s not the part of Tony Steve would be most focused on if he had his boyfriend next to him.
He still can’t help softly crying himself back to sleep as he thinks of everything they could have been if they both had been different people.
“I thought you had a group session,” Tony says, moving his gaze away from Steve’s figure when looking at him becomes too much, but his eyes can’t find a point in the room to settle on.
Nebula’s smile leaves her face but the softness stays.
Slowly, Steve reaches over and places his right hand right on the middle of the shield, over the star.
“Tony being Iron Man wasn’t the only reason why we ended up breaking up but it did play a part in it,” Pepper confesses. “At the time I didn’t understand that not accepting Iron Man meant not accepting Tony because it wasn't just something he did, it was who he was.”
The anger and the hurt and the disappointment and the sadness that Tony has been carrying around with him for years, they all feel too heavy now. They’ve warmed him during cold nights, they’ve pushed him to do better and, only a few hours before, they were giving him the strength to stand up to this man that is now sitting in front of him.
“FRIDAY,” Tony pronounces. “Please ask Bruce to meet us here.”
“I love you,” Steve repeats, chucking a little. “I do. I know maybe it feels sudden but the thing is, Tony… I’ve been falling in love with you for a long time. When you were gone, when we thought you were dead, I got to know you. Kind of.”
“I’m sorry too,” Tony whispers.
Something must show on his face because Tony’s own expression changes quickly only by looking at Steve.
The panic is always like a wave that crashes into him suddenly and powerfully.
Has he ever called Steve by his name before? Has Steve only ever been
He showers Rhodey in stories about the Commandos, the rowdy ones and the funny ones and the hardest ones too.
She sighs and closes her eyes.
“Hey, Tony.”
Steve is mindful to shallow this time before he speaks. “That’s because it’s true. Seriously, Tony, I love it.”
Natasha stands and goes to follow him as he sets path towards Thor’s room but Steve moves quickly and blocks her path.
Natasha lets out a bitter laugh.
“It’s nice knowing you’ll be there when I’m ready. I need a little more time, that’s all.”
Tony’s attention gets pulled back to the happenings around him and he focuses his gaze on Steve’s back. He is wearing a simple black suit and Tony is having trouble associating this side of Steve with the man he’s accustomed to. It’s understandable that Steve wouldn’t show up at the White House in sweatpants and a hoodie, but Tony’s so used to watching Steve walk around the Compound like that that it feels almost surreal to see him so dressed up now.
“Why do you think you didn't notice?” Tony asks abruptly after some minutes of silence.
He’s just sitting down, not even a minute having gone by since he sent the selfie, when Tony sends back his response, two texts, one right after the other.
“I knew you would understand this dichotomy, I suppose I could call it,” Bruce says. “Feeling like you’re something more than yourself but cursing it because it isn't always something you want.”
Tony looks at him and is surprised to discover that, for the first time, he really can see only him as Steve. A blank canvas of possibilities for what he could end up meaning for Tony, no past expectations, no forced interactions or unwanted conflicts.
Rhodey’s soft snores settle something inside Tony he didn’t even know was restless before but he still sleeps fitfully, waking up intermittently and simply staring straight ahead, his mind working in circles through the same images, the same phrases, the same moments of his life.
Steve has hadn't doubts since then that JARVIS is so much more than just a simple machine. Tony created a real and incredible person in the shape of an AI and Steve wishes he could thank Tony for gifting him with the opportunity to get to know JARVIS.
And now his world is gone and it’s been replaced by a new confusing one.
Pointing in Thor’s direction Tony asks, “What’s wrong with him?”
“Just let me say this,” Steve pleads. “Please.”
“I love you, too.”
_______________________________
Exhale and open palms.
When morning comes, Rhodey leaves to take a shower after Tony has reassured him that he’ll be fine without him.
The silence lasts for a few more seconds and then Tony opens his mouth to speak.
The water is on the verge of being too hot, Tony’s skin reddening and turning more sensitive as he positions his body directly under the spray. He’s careful not to stick his head completely under the falling water, knowing his anxiety is too volatile at the moment and that it could trigger unpleasant memories he’s associated with water for years now.
“Me too,” Tony agrees. “That’s why I ordered some pizza from Nino’s.”
“Natasha…,” he says. “What are we going to do?”
This last thing is said airily but it warms something inside Tony that he can’t put a name for. Maybe a last scar fading away. Maybe the last brick of a new solid foundation sliding into place.
“I’ll be downstairs having breakfast, come down once you fully wake up.”
“You know, I didn’t plan on revealing this but I hope you know I let you win every single time at paper football.”
Tony hasn’t seen much of either of them this week and he’s both grateful and irritated that they gave Pepper and him some space to be on their own. The irritation comes from the idea that maybe if they had acted more as a buffer for them things wouldn’t have become so difficult between them. He knows it’s unfair and he also knows it’s not even true.
“I just… I knew him leaving was a possibility but I thought…I believed that he’d…” Bruce stammers. “I thought he’d come talk to me.”
Steve is a good leader even when he’s not trying to be.
and the three of them had ended the night trying to covertly wipe their tears away as they made their excuses to all go to their rooms.
In the blink of an eye Tony grabs Steve’s phone from where he was still holding it with only one of his hands. Steve pronounces a weak and not very believable protest as Tony’s hand that’s not holding Steve’s phone goes towards the back pocket of his faded blue jeans.
Tony ends up speaking once or twice. Nothing like the long and passionate narrations of Steve but he’s truthful when he does. He looks at Steve as he opens up in front of near-strangers. He uses Steve as an anchor so that others will be able to find shore in his experiences too.
He knows, objectively, that there have been other things he’s kept after the snap, Rhodey being the crucial. He even knows there are things he’s gained after the Decimation -Steve and their friendship in a way it didn’t exist before, and the same thing with Bruce and Natasha.
Finding help is sometimes not as easy as wanting to find it, but the first step is certainly one of the most important ones. Perhaps that is also why it can be one of the scariest ones.
“Show me,” Thor repeats, making his voice a little louder this time.
Tony meant for his voice to sound light but it doesn’t. It carries all the weight in the world.
Both of them note his presence and Steve catches how Rhodes stands a little taller upon seeing him. Steve salutes him almost immediately, like an instinct, even though he’s not in his own uniform and he doesn’t really feel it in his heart. Colonel Rhodes salutes him back.
Sure, he’s seen him smile, soft and small ones as well as big and bright ones, and he’s also seen him laugh, freely and fully, but that joy felt nothing like this is feeling right now.
Tony loses his mind for the entire time that Steve is eating him out and the sight of Steve enjoying it just as much as he is only serves to magnify the experience and make it even better. It’s something so intimate and passionate that Tony knows balance has just shifted between them.
Steve clears his throat but he doesn’t follow that with a question or comment. Tony keeps looking forward, his eyes now lost on the few ripples and moves of the lake water.
Tony can more or less guess where the rest of the team is right now because, for a band of heroes, gods and former assassins they are pretty reliable when it comes to routines. Steve has probably gone on his run already and is most likely taking a shower, debating the best way to get Tony out of the shop and into bed (which, no, he has to finish the upgrades to the suit and he will not rest until he can increase the intensity of the blast of the left repulser without compromising the stability of flight); Clint and Natasha must be at the gym, sparring and being generally and awesomely scary; Bruce is either in his lab or in bed after an entire night of being in his lab and Thor… Actually, Tony has no idea where Thor could be, Thor is the most unpredictable of all of them. He could as well be climbing Mount Everest or snorkeling in the Great Barrier Reef for all Tony knows. (He once disappeared for a week and came back with tales of his great backpacking experience through Europe. To this day, they still have no idea how he did it without any money or even with whom.)
Peter.
All those implicit promises, the blind encouragement, the baseless hope.
Bruce’s voice is full of wonder, but a strange one if that. He suddenly looks as if he has just realized something and he was beating himself up for not having put the pieces of the puzzle together sooner.
Steve has most definitely made his all of these things -the Decimation, the devastation, the losses, the hope, the reversal- and it has crashed and burned around him. But he won’t be able to let it go. It will just become one more layer of who Steve Rogers is and he will carry it forever.
