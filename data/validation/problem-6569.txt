He peers down at the love of his life, putting as much tenderness into the gaze as possible. Tony looks back up at him, and Steve brings a hand down to caress the side of his face, thumbing his cheek. Tony’s smile is radiant in return and he moves to kiss the palm of Steve’s hand to then nuzzle his thigh, and Steve feels his heart expand. It’s almost as if every good thing about them is clicking into place, and he wonders why this didn’t happen sooner.
“I- I just don’t know what else to do,” Steve sobs. He’s not sure when he started crying, but now the tears run fast and hard. “Sh- she’s gone- oh god Tony she’s gone, and I don’t know how to stop this ache!” Steve is crumbling now, the grief of it hitting him again, harder than he’s let it this past month. The weight of it has him sliding to the floor, hands bracing his head.
Finally, Tony takes him fully in the mouth, wrapping his lips around Steve’s throbbing dick and hand holding firm. Steve’s mouth slowly opens as he watches Tony slowly take all of him until Tony gags when it  hits the back of his throat. Steve grunts and bucks his hips up into Tony’s warm and eager mouth, his eyes squeeze shut. He’s gripping the bench so tightly, it’s a wonder it doesn’t break. Tony holds himself there for a moment, swallowing around the thickness that is Steve Rogers, and Steve thinks he passes out for a second at the feeling. Tony then pulls back, gasping for breath as his hand goes to pump Steve’s cock.
“Smells like breakfast is ready. If we get out there soon enough, maybe we can snag something before Clint steals it all.” This makes Tony chuckle, and Steve feels a small bit of triumph bloom in his chest. A small glimpse of truly warm happiness. Steve waits for the pang of guilt to hit, and it never comes.
Tony pulls back with a look of confusion. “Are you kidding me!? That was some of the best sex I’ve ever had! But I appreciate you making sure.” Tony tilts his head in consideration, and raises up to straddle Steve’s lap, “How about, whenever words get hard, we use the ‘green-yellow-red’ and the tap-out system, so we’re on the same page? That way there isn’t any confusion and no one panics that they crossed a line after the fact,” Tony wraps his arms around Steve’s shoulders so his hands can play with the wet hair at the nape of Steve’s neck, almost as if to drive home that he’s okay.
It’s not Bruce’s fault, he’s just doing his best to move forward. So Steve eats his pancakes. He can feel Tony’s eyes glance over, like he can feel the tension radiating off of Steve. But Steve just ignores it, he can’t bare to see the concern written across Tony’s features. Though no one else shows signs of noticing the shift in Steve’s demeanor, the shift in the room is palpable.
He watches Tony’s every move: The way he hooks his thumbs in the waistband of his pants to pull them down. The way his arms and shoulders shift  and flex as he pulls the soft tank top over his head, exposing his lean torso which is dusted with dark hair. Tony is certainly beautiful, scars and all. Steve’s mouth waters.
But Steve isn't asleep. Now that things have settled, he's left with that empty feeling again. No matter how much he wants Tony's presence to be enough, it can only help for so long. For a moment, the darkness was gone, extinguished by the light that Tony always seems to provide, but now it's like that light has been switched off, and the only thing Steve is left with is an all encompassing darkness. None of this is Tony's fault, he knows that. He knows Tony has tried his best to help. Which is why Steve waits until he feels Tony's breathing even out before he finally cries himself to sleep.
She sacrificed herself so that they could have this moment. Yes, in the end it was Carol Danvers who snapped her fingers for Thanos and his army to be dusted away, her linked powers to the Tesseract allowing her to do so without dying. But they wouldn't have gotten here if it wasn't for Natasha Romanoff, Black Widow, Steve's best friend.
She is — was — the ever-present friend who listened to his rants and provided a shoulder to cry on. Steve always looked forward to the movie nights they would have in whatever safe house they managed to find. Sam, without fail, would find them the next morning asleep, Natasha’s head on Steve’s shoulder, and Steve’s head on top of Nat’s. There was a lot of that actually.
Steve using sex as a coping mechanism goes on for awhile, maybe close to a month? The passage of time has been hard for Steve to follow. All he can focus on is the new pattern of his life that he desperately clings to: doing his best to pretend like he's fine, until it becomes too much and Tony helps him forget long enough to go back to pretending.
The salacious images of their first time together play through his mind and he hums in appreciation, but then it dawns on him, “I got a little rough there, was that too much? I hope I didn’t hurt you.”
"Considering that your version of good food is very different from Clint's version of good food, I'm pretty sure you're safe, babe."
“Such a dirty bastard aren’t you, babe?” Tony smarts back breathily, and he pushes Steve to sit on the bench, spreading his legs to kneel on between them. Steve’s back presses against the cool wall of the shower room, a stark contrast to the steaming water, making him hiss.
Tony is gripping Steve’s thigh with one hand, the pressure strong enough that it would leave marks if Steve didn’t heal at an accelerated rate. He can’t help but feel the small twinge of disappointment in knowing that he can’t be marked by Tony. Those thoughts don’t last long, though, they dash away when Tony goes to massage and gently squeeze Steve’s balls with the hand that no longer needs to hold his dick, what with Tony’s head still bobbing relentlessly.
The strong, hot spray of water pounds against Steve’s chest and back, massaging away the rest of the tension in his muscles. He rolls his shoulders, too stubborn to turn the water any colder, wanting to feel the burn of it against his skin. Not wasting any time, he grabs for his clean washcloth and the body wash that Tony says makes him smell like the kind of home you want to come back to. He breathes in deeply, nostrils flaring, and the thick heady smell of it fills his nose as he works the soap into a lather on his body. The heat of the water makes the bathroom steam with it’s familiar perfume.
won’t get clean,” Tony says, his answer indicating that he knows exactly what Steve is asking for. His voice cracks at the end, proving to Steve just how much this is affecting him too. Steve doesn’t have to be told, he automatically makes quick work of cleaning  Tony off just as deliberately. Tony’s more vocal about how much he’s enjoying the kneading and passes of the wash cloth on his skin.
Natasha had actually become the go-between for Steve and Tony when they first made amends during the Blip. Steve once found himself stuck in a private space alone with Tony, tension almost too much to bear. The attempts to break the silence were at first awkward dances to figure out what was still considered a safe topic. But after awhile, they both slowly remembered they were actual friends before everything had gone to shit and things finally weren’t so bad.
“Mmm, but you taste so good.” He huffs in such a deep, husky voice, grazing his teeth more firmly against that very spot again, eliciting an even louder moan from Tony. By this point, they’re both very hard and straining, but Tony finally gets the shower going, and turns to push Steve into the spray before following him in. Right away, Steve notes that some of the grime on their bodies begin to wash away, save for a few spots that will definitely require the use of soap.
“You were amazing,” Steve says as he runs his fingers through Tony’s hair, savoring the warm after glow. He never knew it could be this good.
Soon Steve is bucking his hips up to meet Tony’s mouth. He’s so close, so very very close. But he wants Tony to come with him, so he reaches for Tony’s dripping cock. Squeezing and pumping, Tony moans around Steve’s dick, which makes Steve go faster.
"She's — Nat's — she's gone. She's gone Tony." It’s all Steve manages to choke out before another wave of sobs overcome him. Tony just pulls him into an embrace, rubbing his back soothingly, his chin resting on top of Steve's head. And Steve falls into it.
Steve watches as Tony's suit recedes back to wherever it is the nano-tech armor resides. A small flicker of something stirs in Steve's heart, and he thinks maybe he's not completely lost to the world. Tony has his usual black tank top and nicely-fitting undersuit pants underneath; an image that would usually make Steve’s mouth water, now lacks its usual beckoning pull.
That was all it took. When he heard her name, it was like a cold bucket of water was poured over him. All of the warmth he was finally getting used to again snuffs out like a candle. Tony tenses from where he stands by the coffee machine, but doesn’t say a word. Bucky glances Steve’s way, with genuine sympathy and concern written across his features.
"Would you... could you join me? I don't want to be alone." It’s the first full sentence Steve has been able to utter since leaving the battlefield, his voice raw from the hours of sobbing. The prospect of being with Steve in the shower really seems to get Tony going, his face full of desire.
A year after that first encounter, Steve became good friends with Tony again, which then turned into something romantic. It hadn’t gone as far to turn sexual, though they were excited for that part to come (pun very much intended). With all they’d been through, they knew that their emotional connection needed work before a physical connection was brought into the relationship.
This morning isn't any different. He's not sure when he woke up, but he's laying in bed, facing the floor to ceiling windows to his right, sheer curtains covering them, letting the sunlight in to dance across his face. He feels the warm presence of Tony pressing up behind him, Tony’s face smearing drool as it smooshes against the back of Steve's bare shoulder. This is normal, laying in bed long before the alarm goes off, eyes open but unseeing. He takes a deep breath. A tear runs down his face as his fingers idly draw patterns on the strong forearms of the human embodiment of his whole world. The motion anchors him, if at least a little.
Steve releases Tony’s hand to take the stool by Wanda and he watches with fondness as Tony circles around to get his usual cup of coffee, ruffling Peter’s hair on his way. Tony would make an amazing dad. Well, he is actually. Peter has basically become a son to him, and Steve just hopes that this bit of light can stay for Tony, because he deserves something good to stay. Steve was so busy looking at the pair with fondness that he didn’t notice Bruce standing before him, plate in hand.
The list of morning tasks take up all the space in his mind, leaving no room for feelings of any kind. Truly, Steve could make the walk to the bathroom in his sleep, and he looks like he does, the way he moves around the room like a zombie.
When Steve finishes, he reaches down and around to firmly squeeze Tony’s ass with his unoccupied hand, while he strokes Tony’s dick with the hand still holding the wash cloth. Tony’s knees wobble, but Steve supports him as he bites and sucks on the junction between Tony’s neck and shoulder, knowing he’ll be sporting a mark there for awhile.
With every brush of tongue and lips, every press of their bodies, Steve feels a little more whole. He can’t get enough, his hands grip Tony tighter, enough to bruise, and he moans, moving them backwards into the shower.
, Steve thinks, as Tony pays extra close attention to his chest and ass. But before he can go to where Steve really wants him, Tony goes back up to clean his face and wipes away the worst of the mess as Steve lets out a whimper.
The shower in the penthouse isn’t like any other Steve had been in before. One of the many pros to being Tony Stark's boyfriend is having access to luxuries one can't forget. It’s about the size of a small bathroom, with multiple shower heads and an inlaid bench built into the walls. Perfect for shower sex.
Even though Steve has been there more times than he can count on his two hands — having used it whenever he went into the city for his therapy group after he and Tony became a thing — with the state Steve’s in, Tony has to lead him to the penthouse private bathroom. Steve is still barely responsive under the weight of depression and exhaustion.
Steve almost misses Tony’s look of pleased surprise, and the warmth in his chest spreads with the thought that he finally did something right. They continue on like that, shuffling around each other to snag articles of clothing they deem appropriate for the days activities. Sharing small, sweet moments that make the energy light. Is it truly possible that today is the day that things get better? And maybe it’s wishful thinking, but Steve would like to believe that it is.
They eventually get up after trading kisses a few more times to rinse off before making their way to the bed. They gently dry each other off, in part because of the immense love that they feel for each other, but they are also now both exhausted. They climb into the immaculate bed that they've now shared countless times when Tony had to make business trips for SI. The sheets are soft silk that soothes against their clean, hot skin, like a sigh.
“Okay, sweetie, now wait.” Tony manages to get out, he’s holding his hands up. This was not what Steve was expecting or wanting and it stuns him. He takes a few steps back, unable to say anything, slightly hurt that Tony isn’t letting him indulge in this. Tony’s eyebrows crease in concern, probably noticing Steve’s misty eyes.
He hasn’t been at the Stark Tower since the endeavor to save the world started six months ago, and he’s never stayed for long periods of time with Tony. The thought is fleeting as they shoot through the sky.
Once Tony finishes undressing, Steve drags his eyes up to lock gazes with Tony and watches as Tony’s eyes drop down to where Steve’s biting his lip, and then a little further to his now half-hard and leaking dick. Tony licks his lips, still entranced with the ever hardening view, and then looks back up, eyes filled with lust.
“I don’t want to let people down, but I don’t want to dishonor her. And then I just miss her, I- I miss her so fucking much it hurts.” He’s hyperventilating now, unable to get enough air into his lungs.
"We still got the tower honey." Tony responds, and Steve can only nod, no further persistence of needing to know the plan. Steve knows his actions, or lack thereof, will show the severity of it all, but he doesn’t care. Tony, still in his suit, braces Steve in his arms bridal style, and blasts them up into the sky. The whole ride over is silent, except for Tony confirming with FRIDAY that the tower can accommodate them and they'll have the space to themselves. Steve had somehow forgotten about the tower in the chaos of his muddled mind.
Instead of answering right away, Tony’s hands clasp the sides of Steve’s face. His eyes are starry with emotion when he leans forward to press another gentle kiss to Steve’s lips. “And I love you Steven Grant Rogers. I’m truly the lucky one, so very very lucky to have you. I’m not going anywhere, not even Satan himself can convince me to leave you.” The words settle a small part inside Steve and he closes his eyes as Tony leans forward to rest their foreheads against each other.
Tony does have a point, and maybe Steve has just felt the pressure of everyone more because of his...grieving, but he has to agree that the tower has been a little crowded lately. Ever since the “Blip” it’s been all hands on deck to rebuild and repair the damage done from the battle. The people assembled in the kitchen now have been the constants, but sometimes the others (Captain Marvel, Rhodey, some of the Guardians, Thor, and Ant Man) will come and check in or give updates on their own missions.
So there, on the battlefield, he just falls to his knees, the helmet clutched in his hands tumbling to the ground beside him. Tears stream down his face as the full force of his anguish hits him. The tears turn into sobs. His hands cover his face and his body hunches over as he pictures Nat’s beautiful, carefree smile. The one that she reserved just for him.
That’s why the news of her sacrifice hit everyone so hard. For Steve, he had lost his best friend, it was truly like he lost his other half.
Tony touches down and gently places Steve on his feet. The flight granted Steve time to bring himself back a little. Well, at least enough to stand on his own. He feels better now that he's let out the sorrow that was eating him alive, but he also just feels like a shell of a person.
"That was — I mean — wow." Tony breathes out, and Steve has to agree, "Wow is right. Better than I expected. And what I expected was already pretty incredible to begin with." They both chuckle at that.
He shuts the water off abruptly, hand carelessly reaching outside of the shower to grab his towel. He dries his body as he steps out, the towel tied around his waist by the time he reaches the vanity again. The wet glass feels cool under his hand when he swipes away the fog that collected there during his shower. He doesn’t give himself the chance to take in the tired expression he has, going straight into brushing his teeth. He needs to wake Tony up soon so they can both be ready at a reasonable hour. Steve can smell breakfast being made already.
Steve’s gaze slides over to Clint, who is slightly hunched over his plate of food. While Wanda, less fervently, eats her own food beside him in silent comfort. It’s as if Clint has adopted her into his own family. Their dynamic has definitely helped Wanda integrate smoothly into the team.
Leaning forward, he brushes his lips up to Tony’s cheek, planting soft kisses in a trail to his ear. The sensations elicit a hum from Tony, his mouth curving into a smile.
It happened to Natasha first. Steve can still remember how she thrashed in his arms, her voice was hoarse as she screamed and cried at a no longer existent enemy. Her eyes were squeezed tight, and tears streamed down her cheeks as she uselessly pounded her fists against his chest. It had only taken a moment for Steve to come to his senses enough to hold her closer and rub her back in comfort. He whispered into her hairline reminders that she was safe and no one could hurt her anymore until she finally relaxed back into him.
“More,” is all Steve can manage when Tony pauses, the bastard. Long gone are those dark, overpowering thoughts; all Steve can think about is Tony.
The time Steve spends in the shower, though short, is where the real “magic” happens. It’s where he goes from barely able to put one foot in front of the other to someone who can pass as doing just fine. He scrubs his face with the still soapy washcloth, as if to plaster on the mask of nonchalance he now regularly wears.
“I’m so close baby, but I want you to come with me. I want you to come for me.” Steve murmurs into Tony’s ear, and Tony moans around Steve’s dick again, hips slowly bucking into Steve’s hand. All of these sensations tap deep into Steve, a seductively dark and possessive part of him rising up to take the controls. He reaches around and slaps Tony’s ass, loving how it moves and how the sound echoes off the tile walls. Tony’s cry is muffled by the thickness of Steve’s dick, and Steve can’t help but smirk at the power he has.
For most people, this would be a peaceful moment to enjoy the little things, but all it is for Steve is frozen, silent torture. He wishes he could be normal and just cozy right back up in bed and be content, but he always wakes up at the same time every morning. His mind alert and flooding with memories of Nat that are now tarnished with the thought of her crumpled and crushed body, whose soul is lost to the stone that returned with Clint instead of her. He's powerless against the onslaught of horrific what-if’s. He's putting all his energy into not breaking down so that he doesn’t move, not wanting to disturb Tony. He’s completely at the mercy of his unforgiving mind. His eyes fill with more tears and the light that’s filtering through the curtains turn to blurs of golden color.
He hears a deep scream, but his head is ringing and he can’t determine whether it’s his own or Bucky’s. Fuck, Steve may have lost his best friend, but Buck lost his wife.
Steve jolts at the sudden abrasive noise coming from his alarm, the hold of the paralyzing torture breaking. His arm moves of its own accord to come up and smack against the top of the offensive device, effectively silencing it, but he doesn’t remove his hand. Once he manages to calm his racing heart, he blinks a few times to clear the remaining tears. His eyes are the only thing that move as he squints to look at the bold red numbers floating on the nightstand. The clock reads 7:30 A.M. He heaves a deep sigh, releasing the tension that’s been coiling in his body since he first woke.
He has to blink against the sudden brightness of the room, the light beams from the spotlight bulbs in the ceiling and the self illuminating mirrors. The hard soles of his slippers softly tap against the white tiled floor, before Steve toes them off to stand on the spongy grey bath mat in front of the mirrors. He begins to shave, not needing to put any focus into the movements as he uses the attached, smaller mirror to see from all angles. When he’s sure that he got everything, patting away the remaining shaving cream, he hangs his head between his arms braced on the vanity.
Turning back into the bedroom, it’s apparent that Tony hasn’t made any signs of waking soon on his own. His bare form is still sprawling out on the bed in the same position Steve left it in. Tony has always been the kind of sleeper that will take up the whole bed if able, or cling onto the first person to join him in it: Face squishing into the mattress, just barely missing the mark of the pillow, the sheet only covering his much appreciated ass, with one arm coming around to rest his hand on the back of his head, one leg slung over a wayward pillow.
"Okay, yeah sure. Whatever you need Steve, I'm here. I'm not going anywhere." Tony rotates his body to face Steve again and comes back over, slowly bringing his hands up to Steve's still uniformed chest. He leans up to gently kiss Steve's lips, lingering just enough to comfort and express his love, before breaking the kiss to rest his forehead against Steve's.
The worn in slippers scuff across the carpet, the only sound filling the room as Steve makes his way over to the bathroom with deliberate steps. As he passes the foot of the bed, he also passes the door to the rest of the tower. For now, there isn’t any signs of life from the other side. Steve is usually the first to wake, but not the first to emerge into the common area.
“I want that gorgeously smart mouth wrapped around my hard dick. I want you to suck me off until I come for you.” He pants into Tony’s ear, and Tony groans in response.
“What do you want Steve? What do you need?” Tony’s questions brush against Steve’s ear seductively, making him shiver. All the things Steve has always wanted to try flash through his mind, but one image sticks.
“I think you just don’t like to share,” Steve prods back. This something they haven’t done in a while, the banter. Steve wasn’t open to it before, but now it warms his heart.
Even after things mended over with Tony, Steve’s friendship with Natasha held strong. They shared inside jokes, which turned team movie nights into Steve and Nat laughing at something obscure, like the word pancakes. The team would wear confused looks in response, while Tony held a small smile.
Steve notices that Tony’s shoulders relax a bit, a small sigh of what must be relief escaping him. It makes sense that Tony was nervous, he’s never been one for a serious heart to heart; and before, it was only Natasha that would be able to get through to Steve. Tony scoots closer, planting a small kiss of Steve’s forehead before hugging him close.
However, to Steve’s dismay, Tony looks like he prepared for this. “I’m not stupid, Steve, I know that you’ve been struggling with Natasha’s death. I also know that you’ve been using sex as a coping mechanism. Hell, Steve, I’m sure the whole team has noticed something is up!” He takes a deep breath to calm himself, eyes closing briefly.
“Please,” Steve whimpers out, hips rocking slightly forward in attempts to just feel the heat of Tony’s enticing mouth. And then Steve is thanking all known gods and deities because Tony obliges. Leaning down, he presses his tongue flat against the underside of Steve’s base. Shaft still held in place, he slowly, oh-so-slowly, licks up, flicking the tip of Steve’s dick with the tip of his tongue to steal the precum that has gathered there. A deep moan rips out of Steve’s mouth.
Steve’s eyes go around the room filled with the people he now calls family, his cheeks aching from holding a smile longer than he has in awhile. It’s almost like a veil has been lifted as he looks around with the lighter energy the morning has gifted him with, his heart full of love towards everyone there.
Steve feels Tony grappling to do the same to his own aching and neglected cock, and Steve can’t help the deep, rumbling moan that escapes him. He feels Tony’s dick jerk in response within his firm grasp. Steve knew it was going to be good, but wow, this is better than anything he could have ever imagined.
“Don’t tell me I got all prettied and cleaned up for you, just to have you choose the bed over me,” Steve makes his voice deep and sultry in Tony’s ear, just the way he loves it.
“I’m not saying this to shame you. It would be shitty for me of all people to try and shame you for something I was very notorious for. I’ve played a big part in this as well. I guess I allowed myself to believe I was all you would need to get through this, but I’m not. And rightly so! I’ve enjoyed all this, but you need to get help Steve. I love you, and I can’t bare to see you like this,” Tony rushes out, leaving no room for Steve to interrupt, not that he would. Tony’s cheeks puff out with a deep breath, he looks nervous, slightly tense and he waits for Steve’s response.
For a moment longer Steve’s gaze bore through him, right to the back of his skull. Then his eyes flew back to Peter. Tony still couldn’t breathe right, but it was getting easier, knowing that Steve should’ve, would’ve dropped everything if he had been able to.
“Yes, I’m sure Daddy’s got it covered, Pete” Steve added for good measure and yet again Tony was glad to have him by his side where parenting was concerned. He had a way of stoically delivering bad news, or at least news that Peter didn’t want to hear about. Like right now, when he looked disappointed that the grocery shopping was already done. Tony didn’t know where he’d gathered that strong interest in buying food, but he had it.
“It has to stand here,” he pats his hand right where he wants his present to be displayed and Steve immediately complies, “and the drawing on the-“
Steve follows the glance only to find Tony placing a finger over his mouth as if he wants to shush their son, but actually says, “He wouldn’t allow me to give you anything else. So you have our ball of sunshine here to thank that you won’t get a private island this year.”
Steve most certainly hasn’t. Bucky’s gaze shortly darts between Steve and Nat, but ultimately lands on the woman again.
“Uh, sorry. I’m a little overwhelmed. This is…” He clears his throat, taking in the mechanical picture yet again. He’s almost as moved as the first time he’s lain eyes on it. “This is so… awesome, I can’t believe you two really made this for me.”
“Christmas miracle,” Tony says quietly, sliding his hands around Steve’s middle and resting his chin on his shoulder. Steve agrees with an equally quiet hum. Peter will always be their little Christmas miracle. They were able to sign the adoption papers just three days before Christmas, only four months after the boy’s birth. Ever since, this time of the year is doubly special for them.
“How about,” he suggested as a way of distraction, “we go upstairs and see what’s left in the fridge for dinner?”
“He’s not listening,” the boy whispers into the phone and now Steve actually has to turn away because the smile splits his face. He hears Tony’s soothing timbre, but can’t make out actual words. What he can hear, though, is his kid saying, “You can count on me, Daddy” with utter conviction.
He should’ve seen the outcome to that, really, but he’s surprised by Tony’s fingers tightening again.
“The one where you told Dad about how Billy ruined your shared project and Ms. Knight didn’t believe you, was the one I watched over and over until I could recite it by heart because I loved the sass going back and forth between you so much.”
His hand travels up higher on Tony’s thigh. Tony turns a little, opens his legs a little wider to give Steve some room for activities they have neither the time nor the privacy for, but that feel nice nevertheless. They’ve taken too long already which only becomes more obvious when Peter calls over, “Dad! Papa’s present! Come on!”
Bucky straitens his back. “I’m a former assassin. I can work this.” He’s off before Steve can complain about the presence of alcohol in his house when they’re expecting kids.
it’s going up on the fridge,” Steve finishes, dragging his hand over Peter’s head again before he gently pushes him back towards the tree to open his presents. This time the kid goes way more willingly. Moments later he’s all absorbed with unwrapping. Steve’s glance finds Tony’s across the room and mouths, “Love you”, earning himself a smirk and a finger beckoning him closer again. As always he doesn’t hesitate a second.
At that Bucky laughs out loud, full-bodied, a hand over his chest and with his head thrown back. “No! No, he’s taking a couple of vets out for lunch. Do something nice since most of them are pretty shaken up by the events of the year. But I’m sure Valerie’s with them, too.” He winks.
“Then you should thank God your hair doesn’t gray.” Tony smirks at him before he leans in for a kiss, all soft and with feeling. Pete makes a strange noise they both ignore before pulling apart and resuming the cuddling.
“Sweetheart, I get it, I know it hurts, no one is asking you to act like you’re fine. But I need you to talk to a professional who can help you find closure. I’m worried about you.”
They walk a few steps into the still bedroom, Steve’s empty gaze sweeps the expanse of it. His attention snaps back over to Tony when he feels him release his hand and turn to leave. Automatically panic wells up in Steve at the prospect of being alone, and without registering it, he reaches out to grasp Tony's arm.
“Don’t do that,” Tony begs. “You’re cute, but you’re also gross with alien guts and blood. I personally would be able to enjoy your dick in my mouth more if you were clean.” This makes Steve outright laugh, but it also turns him on even more, the idea of Tony kneeling before him so vivid. Only Tony could  make him laugh and feel aroused at the same time.
Tony smirks up at him and again obliges, twirling his tongue around the head of Steve’s dick, then going to tease his slit, licking up the now never ending precum. Steve grants Tony a gasp as he watches Tony go back to licking up and down his shaft, and planting open mouthed kisses to his base.
They first land on Bruce, who is going between the stove and the island, with Peter enthusiastically explaining some kind of science theory he’s learning about in school. The two of them have been getting along so well, something Steve is very thankful for, because selfishly that means he gets more time with Tony. Steve must admit though, the kid is hard to dislike. He’s smart, passionate, and sweet. It makes sense that he would get along so well with Bruce, and how Tony couldn’t resist taking the young prodigy under his wing.
When Steve’s attention is finally drawn over to the island to see what seat is available, he's met with a mixture of raised eyebrows, grins, and curious glances. Steve raises his own eyebrow in question, and with a shake of some heads, the team goes back to what they were doing. Everyone’s already crowded around the island, chowing down on what is most likely Bruce’s genius in the kitchen.
“I don’t even know where to go for that,” Steve admits. His thoughts aren’t spiraling as much as they were before, and he’s actually able to focus on the conversation. Tony is smiling softly at him, his eyes shining with a bit of relief. He’s still rubbing Steve’s arms, probably not even aware that he is anymore.
In the moment of their victory against Thanos and his army, there’s a mixture of relief and utter joy that runs through them. All except Steve. Sure, he feels the elation that it’s finally over — he even yanks his helmet off to get a better view of their triumph — but when he instinctively turns to hug Natasha in celebration, his heart is met with a cold wall.
“You like that, baby? You like being spanked?” Steve eggs on, the dirty talk coming so easily. Tony can only whimper as he sucks harder, and that’s what pushes Steve over the edge.
“Steve,” Tony manages to moan when Steve grazes a particularly sensitive spot with his teeth. “We have to actually make it
His head falls back with a thunk as he feels Tony’s hand wrapping around him. Momentarily he closes his eyes, before opening them again to look down at Tony when there isn’t any progression. He finds those gorgeous brown eyes looking back, Tony’s mouth hovering  open just above the tip of Steve’s now leaking cock, eyebrows quirked in silent question.
“God, Tony, your mouth feels ‘mazing. S’ fucking good.” Steve’s eyes open blearily, his voice slurs with the praise that pours out, the stimulation so overwhelmingly good. Tony just hums, going back to take Steve into his mouth now that he’s somewhat caught his breath, his head bobbing in Steve’s lap.
“Tony,” he pants. Tony’s ministrations against Steve’s ass and chest have only made standing still for Steve that much harder… literally.
The damage had left the whole compound ruined, forcing the team to relocate back to Stark Tower. Everyone has their own level for their quarters, but there’s one level, the communal area, that they all share, it’s kitchen getting the most attention whenever Bruce is around. It’s been nice, having the whole team all in one building again.
Every time after that, Steve would eagerly relay the new development in his relationship with Tony to Natasha for him to be met with a “told ya so” look. It took Steve longer than it should have to realize that perhaps Natasha was the one to thank for those suspiciously prolonged moments of privacy that the two men were gifted.
“Hey hun, it’s time to get up now.” Steve pets Tony’s hair, his words mimicking the soothing motion. Tony isn’t a morning person, and Steve has learned that this is the best way to wake him without any painful consequences.
“You’re always trying to make me eat. What, are you trying to fatten me up for some weird kink I don’t know about yet?” Steve does his best to give a disapproving scowl but loses the battle and starts chuckling himself. It’s been one of Tony’s never-ending jokes, he was very surprised to learn of the many kinks Steve possesses, and hasn’t been able to let it go, much to Steve’s chagrin.
Steve believes he's successful in fooling everyone, even Tony, who is never one to complain when Steve becomes insistent and desperate with his hands and mouth. Or at least that's what Steve tells himself, because facing the fact that everyone notices, encompasses more than he can handle. He holds tight to it not being  their place to push when they catch him zoning out during their mission debriefs, even if it is becoming a concern.
Extracting himself from Tony’s vice like grip has become second nature at this point, and it allows Steve to easily swing his legs over the edge of the bed so that he can sit. Tony only stirs for a little bit, mumbling something incoherent before turning over and falling back asleep. Steve braces his hands on either side of his thighs as he slightly hangs his head, eyes focusing on some random spot on the floor. Feet blindly move around the soft carpet to snag his way-ward slippers where they burrow. The first destination of the day lays directly behind him.
Everyone else on the team was patient with them when faced with their distant demeanor — to an extent. Nat, however, always understood where Steve was coming from, knew when to let subjects drop without hesitation. Steve did the same for her.
"Everything okay, babe?" Tony says over his shoulder, concern written across his features. Steve knows that Tony hates to leave him like this, but they haven't crossed into the physical aspect of their relationship yet. And Steve gets that. Tony wouldn't want to take advantage of this situation just to get some, but Steve can't help but say it.
Tony is just as frozen, eyes wide and barely breathing. What feels like minutes pass, which must be only seconds, before Tony’s focus returns, and he swallows. “I’m sober. I didn’t… am I dreaming? I’m gonna be really upset if I’m dreaming.”
The elevator doors open and Steve is greeted by a cacophony of noise from the entire team and a few other guests yelling “surprise!” Initially, he’s mostly shocked by how loud they can all actually be when they put their minds to it.
Steve can feel his heart sink - but he keeps the smile on. “Oh, wow. Tony this is… this is great. Thank you.” He says, sounding like he’s hearing himself from twenty feet away. “You did all of this for me? You really didn’t have to…” He says, still with more confidence and happiness than he’s actually feeling.
Tony smiles, softly, and leans down to catch Steve’s eyes. “Oh yeah? I knew I was your favorite.” He winks, and Steve can feel his heart skip. “I bet you say that to all the guys who throw you parties on days that you hate.” The other man is smiling now, but Steve can hear Tony’s heart rate increase, and his own speeds up in response.
Steve can feel one of his eyebrows raise as he glances around at everyone. “Sorry? I… I don’t understand.”
“I know you may not want to hear this because it involves your father, but Tony this day - all those years ago - was one of the worst days of my life. You have to imagine how scared I was - they didn’t even know if I would survive, and there was a good chance that I wouldn’t.” He pauses, swallowing and bracing himself for the rest of what he wants to say. “What happened in that chamber was the worst pain I have ever felt in my entire life. At that point, I knew that I would either make it through or die trying. They tried to stop, but I lied and told them that I was okay. That I could do it. Honestly, I had no idea if I would make it. I knew that realistically I had nothing left to lose. Ma was gone, and… I wanted so badly to do something about what was going on in the war. It was the stupidest decision I have ever made - but I lived. I lived and the thing that everyone thought was impossible actually happened. It worked, and your father was one of the first people I saw when I came back out. He and Erskine were thrilled - it was the best day of their lives. Until...”
“Tony is working on something for you, and my orders are to get you out of the tower for the day.” She says, her voice dripping with mock disdain. She actually sounds… pleased.
They head back to the tower, where Steve is escorted back to his floor by Natasha - who looks no different than she did hours ago, Steve doesn’t know how she does that - and told to shower and get ready for a “small gathering”.
He assumes he’s not over-dressed, and he texts her to say he’s ready and asks if he’s allowed to come to the common floor.
Steve pauses, realizing that might be the most honest he has ever heard Tony be, and the anger just rushes out of him - the idea of hurting Tony making him nauseous. He wants to say more, but words are lost on him now that Tony is standing there looking like his heart is about to shatter.
He bites his bottom lip - clenching his jaw again - and takes a deep breath in and out through his nose. He’s suddenly so tired, and angry, he doesn’t even really want to get into it - but she doesn’t seem ready to let him go just yet.
“I… we all care about you, Steve.” Tony’s even quieter now, hand sliding off of Steve’s shoulder and back to his own side - and Steve can feel the heat from where Tony’s hand was.
“What?” He asks, tone not as nasty as he wants it to be - since it could be anyone, and he hates the idea of actually snapping at Natasha or Tony if they came to him for something important.
Having gotten pretty damn good at hiding his emotions, Steve wanders around the party and mingles with people like a pro. He’s thankful that people are using this as an excuse to just get drunk on good booze and eat good food, and not asking him about that day all of those years ago. He tries not to think too hard about it, and just have a good time. Tony had tried, after all. Not thinking about what this day really means to Steve, only about what it means to everyone else.
“It really is. The kid is so much like Tony, just without all the self destructive tendencies,” Steve smiles back as he responds, not caring if his love for the two made him look soft. It was then that Steve looks down to the plate that Bruce holds out to him. His smile quickly slips from his face.
“I think - I think I want to try and talk. Maybe not to a therapist, at least not yet. But I do want to talk. I have been meaning to talk to Bucky.”
The mantra he runs through in his head when he wakes up every morning: as he drags himself from the warm cocoon of Tony’s embrace, as he takes a soldier's shower, as he dresses. The moments before Tony joins him, Steve is alone, and the falsehood of being okay doesn’t need to be performed . It's almost as if Steve has become a robot in disguise.
“Fibmurmins,” Tony mumbles out, lips barely moving with effort to make coherent speech. His eyes don’t even flicker with recognition that the Steve talking isn’t a dream. Five more minutes his ass. Steve expects this. In fact, he was hoping for this.
Steve’s eyes are watering again and his pulse is racing so loud that he’s sure Tony can hear. He has an irrational fear that if Tony leaves, he'll never see him again either. He just wants to feel something, anything but this dread that’s threatening to drown him.
This also happens every morning. The alarm is a saving grace and a weight of dread all at the same time. He’s no longer stuck in the depressing film of his mind, but now he has to pretend like nothing is wrong for the next 15 or so hours.
Steve stretches his body out, slowly, as to not jostle Tony. He revels in the feel of muscle being pulled taut. It’s one of those luxurious stretches that has your hands interlacing high overhead, feet point like a dancer, while your legs and arms shake with a satisfying clench. The renewing blood flow makes Steve feel as if his body has finally woken from its previously paralyzed state. It’s a good start, he must admit. The fresh feeling is what he focuses on to keep himself from just staying in bed all day. There are only so many obvious indicators of depression he can get away with, and sleeping the day away is not one of them. If his usual tossing and turning can even be considered sleeping.
The sight makes Steve quirk a smile. There’s no way he could love someone more, he thinks as he shuffles over to the soundly sleeping man. The closer he gets, the more he’s able to hear Tony’s even breathing whistling out of his mouth. Steve crouches the best he can with only a towel covering him, right before Tony.
The kid had been awed when they’d flown to Laniakea (don’t ask, curse of a billionaire owning an island in the Pacific, naming it tacky things like ‘immeasurable heaven’) last year. Had his husband really seen the need for another one the kid would’ve been flabbergasted and not mischievous. He’s even trying to hide the giggles behind his hands and that’s enough to tell Steve he’s on the wrong track.
The tension was still there, but grew more and more restless by the second. He didn’t know where his Papa was going with this. Tony did. He tried to hide the smile and all his love for the man it stood for in his shoulder.
With the Thanos issue at hand, it had been fairly easy to squash the rising depression and dread, but now that it’s over, Steve doesn’t have anything to keep himself from falling down that dark hole.
“Fuck, I’m coming Tony.” Steve grunts out as he explodes into Tony’s mouth, hips jerking ever so slightly with the force of his orgasm. Tony swallows every last drop as he comes soon after into Steve’s hand, both moaning in pleasure. Their bodies slump when the orgasms pass. Steve resting his head on Tony’s back, and Tony resting his head on Steve’s thigh. They’re both panting from the exertion.
He’s Captain America for fuck’s sake. He should be the embodiment of strength, but the only thing he gives Tony is a tiny nod as he hiccups out, "Wh- where are we supposed to do that? The- the base is destroyed."
Expressing the turmoil of emotions has Steve feeling more calm, his mind doesn’t feel like a busy beehive anymore. And though the ache is still there, the weight of it lighter. He takes a deep breath.
Steve really had, he’s even gotten so far as to standing outside his door, but the idea of having what he thought may be one of the most difficult conversations while seeing the hurt and sympathy on his childhood best friend’s face always drove him away.
“That’s fine, baby, I can easily work it out for you to see my therapist. But only if you feel comfortable with it. For now, I think it’s best if we try and change the way you cope with this grief. Instead of automatically going to sex, try writing what you feel, work on a project, hell, Steve you don’t even talk about her. Talk to anyone about her. If a therapist is too daunting for you right now, I know Barnes would be more than happy to talk to you,” Tony keeps his voice gentle and calm, as if speaking any louder might spook Steve away. He constantly keeps his hands braced on Steve’s forearms as a way to ground him.
Knowing that he didn’t hurt Tony in any way, Steve nods, lips quirking just slightly, “Yeah, I think that’s a good idea.” Tony smiles in kind, giving Steve a gentle kiss.
After things with Tony fell apart, Steve had become incredibly close to Natasha. Both were able to relate to feeling like an outsider or like they didn't quite belong; Steve for not being from this time period, and Natasha for having more difficulty accepting any kind of familial bond.
"Oh sweetheart. I know, I know." There isn't anything else Tony can say. What do you say to someone who just lost one of the most important people in their life?
“Steve, Steve are you okay? Talk to me babe, what’s going on?” There’s panic and fear in his voice. Tony’s most likely assuming that Steve’s been injured with him hunching over like this, and who can blame him? Tony’s inquiries slowly stop. He brings his hands from Steve’s shoulders to gently grasp Steve’s wrists, slowly pulling them down to reveal Steve’s tear streaked and swollen face. Tony’s face isn’t frozen with panic but sympathetic and questioning.
Steve curls up in bed first with Tony joining soon after as he says, “Goodnight, FRIDAY,” and the lights slowly dim out. He curls around Steve, spooning him, arms wrapped around his middle, holding him close and kissing his shoulder. Tony must assume Steve is already asleep, exhausted from all that has happened.
She later confessed she had been mortified, because she never allowed herself to show her weaknesses. He then told her that he struggled with nightmares too, and that he wouldn’t tell anyone. It pacified her enough in the moment, but she didn’t feel more resolved until Steve went through the same thing. After that, they truly felt most comfortable with each other.
Tony makes his way back over to Steve, his hand outreached and face gentle. "Come on big guy, there's a shower and bed with your name on it just inside." His pet name makes Steve's mouth quirk in a slight, quick smile. Tony seems to notice like he does with everything, and a look of accomplishment and hope crosses his face.
Tony breaks the kiss to Steve’s brief dismay, turning to type the settings he wants into the shower command panel. Steve just redirects his attention to Tony’s jaw, neck, and throat. He knows he’s coming off as desperate, but he can’t find it in himself to care. He feels like a dead man who’s just found his source of life. His ministrations make Tony fumble with pressing the right keys on the screen, delaying the start of a very promising shower.
“Oh, Pete, that’s not-“ Tony took a deep breath. Gently he turned Peter around in his lap, brushing Peter’s cheeks softly with his thumbs. “You’re not- It’s not because of you, baby. I just… I was…” The words got stuck in his throat and wasn’t that just wonderful. “I… I just miss Papa.”
“I’m sorry I’ve been moping, Pete.” The small arms around his neck only tighten, which, no. “I promise I’ll try not to anymore.” Anything in his power.
The kid doesn’t wait long for their reaction, though, and instead scrambles right back off the bed and out the door, probably hoping his dads will follow him. It takes them another minute to move. Steve pulls himself up first, much to Tony’s displeasure.
His thumb gently traced the vibranium-titanium alloy band that made up his and Steve’s wedding rings. Best damn nine years of his life, he decided. And, if it were up to him, the first of many, many more to come.
Steve’s stunned silent as soon as he lays eyes on his present, even before he’s put a single finger on it. For a second he doesn’t dare to do so in fear of breaking it. But then his son asks him to get it out, Papa, and who is Steve to deny the kid?
“You’re not allowed!” the kid interrupts him yet again, and with way more vigor than Steve had expected. For a moment he’s stunned by Peter’s stern look, the way his whole body trembles a little with the anger he’s trying to keep in that he can only blink at his son. The silence between them stretches on until the small body in front of him basically deflates.
Softly Steve kissed him on the lips like he was hoping it was enough to tune down Tony’s latent anger, but oh boy was he wrong about that. Tony was hot on his heels, following his boys. He already went through all the possible injuries Steve could suffer from internally, starting with tissue damage and broken ribs right through to internal bleeding. And yet again Steve stopped his thoughts with a kiss, deeper and more intense this time. It worked to distract Tony for about seven seconds before he pushed at Steve’s chest with a sour look. Steve only looked smug, though he did place another kiss on Tony’s cheek as if he wanted to apologize.
The words are the most serene call if Steve has ever heard one, never mind that Steve would follow his husband to the ends of the Earth, and even beyond. Has already done that, actually, so it’s not a hardship to be led out of their son’s room and, after a short detour to the kitchen where Tony presses a hot cup of punch into his hands, out on the balcony.
“I love being your incorrigible man,” Tony says in that soft tone that makes Steve’s heart bloom. His smile wobbles a little.
Tony didn’t know what to say, was lost for words, and that was a rare occasion as it was. He couldn’t believe that what he’d actually hoped for, the only thing he’d wished for this year, seemed to become true right that instant.
“You’re not going to find anything,” Steve whispered into Tony’s hair and that didn’t sound reassuring.
When little arms closed around his chest, the Cap plushie squeezed between them, it didn’t lighten any of the pain that had started to make itself a home there. And it had nothing to do with the usual hole from where the arc reactor used to be.
Hands raised in defense, Tony leans back again. Steve can see in the crinkles around his eyes that he’s stifling the smile. A little smile on his own lips, he concentrates on lifting the lid to finally see the contents of the box.
Tony directed his glance back to his husband. He hadn’t known about that. A long lost sense of panic raised its ugly head, one that Tony hadn’t thought he’d get to see again.
It broke Tony’s heart to see his son so crestfallen, even though he bravely nodded. And all just because he didn’t know what to say. The anger probably showed in his heated stare he threw over Peter’s head into the camera. Steve should by all means see that Tony was unhappy with him being away for such long periods of time most of the year. So long in fact that it started to affect his relationship with their son.
Peter continued as if Tony hadn’t said anything at all. “It’s ok to feel sad when they’re not around, and I feel sad that Papa’s not here. And you feel sad, too, and that’s alright. It’s normal to miss someone you like.”
The boy stood in the middle of the room, Christmas tree in his back, and looked torn between shame, regret and reluctant joy. Tony hadn’t seen his face with emotions that mixed since he’d come home from preschool and told them some of the other kids had teased him because of his parentage.
It made Tony and Steve chuckle at the same time. Which finally seemed to convince the boy that they were covered for the holidays, at least as far as food was concerned.
Steve smiles. “Absolutely,” he says warmly as the decision settles in his mind. “Hey, what do you say to actually going out right now and buying one?”
“Then I’ll have to pick the one from three and a half weeks back, the first Sunday in Advent. The one where you showed me the snowmen you crafted and painted in preschool. You looked so happy and proud of yourself, and all I wanted to do was kiss your cheek at tell you how much I’d loved one of those on my desk. That was the one that made me miss you the most because I wanted to tell you how proud I was.”
“Well.” Steve took another moment before he continued. Tony could see the tension in Peter’s shoulders rising with every beat.
Steve just wants to propose they settle down with a book or a movie and cuddle on the couch some more when the kid is seemingly struck by lightning and struggles to get out of his arms. Steve has trouble not letting him fall, surprised by the sudden change of pace, but over the years he has managed to accommodate rather well. He suspects the kid has a plan of his own.
Tony understood the remark. After all, he’d never set foot into a kitchen before they’d had Peter besides for coffee. But since they’d had an infant around and Steve had been unnecessarily caught up at his day job at SHIELD Tony had taken it upon himself to get a warm meal on the table at least once a day. FRIDAY had been an enormous help with that, preventing not only once that he’d set the whole kitchen on fire.
Thankfully he doesn’t have to coax an answer out of his mind because his son dashes into the room again, this time jumping on the bed and dragging at both Tony and Steve.
“You were talking about something hard,” Peter interrupted, looking much too serious for a preschooler. “You were talking about being alone. I heard, Daddy. Am I that bad? If I am I promise to be better. I can be better, Daddy, I know I can. Just please don’t be sad anymore.”
Faster than both Tony and Steve could react the boy had struggled free from their embrace, jumped off the couch and glared at him with fire in his eyes. “So you didn’t watch them! You can’t even pick one!”
“There was even one that made me cry. The video you made FRIDAY record without your Dad knowing it.”
“The serum’s already taking care of it. Stop worrying.” Again, whispered into the side of his face where Peter couldn’t hear. The boy was already babbling in rapid fire speech he must’ve inherited from Tony, wasn’t really paying attention to the two of them, but already planning out their Christmas anew. Tony only glared at Steve when Peter had finally turned his back on them, bouncing happily over to the Christmas tree and dragging his Papa along with him, now that he finally had him back.
As they all sit together at the table (almost doubled in length this year to make sure everyone’s maintaining their distance), Steve for the first time since Buck’s birthday in March feels normal. Or at least as normal as it’s going to be for a while longer. Tony’s by his side, sliding his hand on Steve’s thigh from time to time to ensure both of them stay grounded. Not like their son. Peter’s practically buzzing, vibrating in front of their family, the decorated tree and all the presents lying under it.
Sighing heavily Tony took a couple of steps back and eyed his work. Tilting his head a little to the side his hands wandered towards his hips.
Steve laughs, even though it’s a little winded still. “I do, baby, I do. Thank you so much.” He leans down to kiss the top of his son’s head before leaning over to do the same to Tony’s mouth. “Thank you,” he whispers against his husband’s lips.
Peter blinked a couple of times, eyes darting over Tony’s face and their surroundings as if he couldn’t look his Daddy in the eyes. He buried his face in the Cap doll, like he wanted to block everything out, but a moment later he had to come up for air. The question rushed out right after, totally ignoring Tony’s questions.
“And I thought he was exhausting when he was barely two.” The way Tony’s lips move over the bare skin of his chest makes ripples run down Steve’s spine. He almost can’t hear his husband’s muffled words, so distracted is he.
“Don’t know what to say.” His voice was barely more than a whisper. All Tony could do was tightening his arms around his son for comfort.
remember I’m still the face that’s plastered on all the promotional posters, along with my name.” He falls silent for a moment, before saying the words Steve knew he would say next. “Nothing against Pep and her many wonderful ways, but… you know the press coverage is higher when I do the charity work.”
“Do you…” Pete’s voice is too small for having achieved such an incredible feat. “Papa, do you like it?”
When he’d calmed down somewhat Steve added, “Only you, Tony Stark,” he came closer, still showing off those perfectly white teeth in a huge grin, “can manage such a sentence while your brain short circuits out.” His hand landed gently on Tony’s cheek and pulled him closer. Tony let him, mistletoe in his hand completely forgotten.
Sharing a look and a smile with his husband, Steve took two careful steps and pulled Tony against his side, pressing his lips to his temple before letting their son pull him away towards the tree that was still missing tinsel and the star on top, as Peter happily informed him.
For a moment Tony was struck. He hadn’t said that - or had he? He couldn’t remember. Far worse though, was that Peter had obviously heard it. Now, he had to save what was left to save.
“Pete, I still have some work to do. Someone needs to bribe Santa for all those presents your Papa is going to get. But I’ll tell you a secret.”
Tony had enough control over his emotions that he didn’t outright start bawling. But he couldn’t help squeezing his son back and burying his nose in the soft brown locks.
With a smile he thumbed the remaining tears and stains from Peter’s cheeks. The little boy shook with the amount of air he greedily sucked into his lungs and actually was silent for a couple of moments.
, with his son safely wrapped in his arms, but the traitorous nook in his heart missed another pair of arms slung around him so badly. He knew that it was a big parent no-no to rely on your kids for comfort, he’d read that in the countless parenting books years ago, and Tony would reverse their roles back to normal in a second, but for that one moment he just clung to Peter in his arms.
He hasn’t even really finished the sentence before the kid disentangles himself from Steve’s arms and dashes into the living room. With a fond chuckle Steve gets back up and follows Peter. On his way towards the decorated tree he passes by his husband, takes his hand and squeezes tightly, dragging Tony with him where Peter already stands, almost at parade rest, holding out a present wrapped in red and blue paper with a white ribbon around it. That is clearly Tony’s touch. Probably payback for something only Tony Stark can get annoyed over.
Tony frowns at this, pouting slightly. Steve's resounding laugh booms in an echo around the communal floor, making the team look up from whatever conversation or food they were having.
Once they decide to retreat to the penthouse and bid everyone good-night, Steve overly realizes Peter’s on a precarious edge, hovering either on the keyed-up side or the overfatigued and tired-out one. Sometime during getting into his PJs and going to the bathroom to brush his teeth it’s a weird mix of both. As soon as he’s tucked in under the covers, though, he’s out like a light.
To exactly no one’s surprise Peter threw first Steve and then Tony a suspicious look. Obviously he was trying to find another excuse to get out of the house, totally unaware of the crowds of people that would be out doing exactly what Tony had learned to avoid: last minute shopping, be it groceries or Christmas presents.
That the kid is even aware of how close to Bruce’s birthday they actually are (or how close that is to Christmas) is a miracle, Steve thinks. He wouldn’t have thought Peter to have a grasp of that already. Sure, he’s a smart kid, but usually he still lives from day to day, maybe until the weekend if they have something planned, but Steve can’t argue with his logic. They are close to Bruce’s birthday and Steve hasn’t even started decorating yet, a task he usually starts with as soon as Natasha’s birthday’s over.
Steve knew his kid is quick, but he’s still surprised when he throws himself at Steve in a flash, grabbing for the phone. Steve’s so perplex that he almost lets him, but in the end holds out a finger, indicating Peter should wait, and when the boy does, puts Tony on speaker.
miss you, babe.” Another sigh that he couldn’t stop. He bit his lip again, but even though he tried really hard to hold it back, the words left his mouth in a barely suppressed murmur. “You shouldn’t have taken that mission.” Which was immediately followed by, “Crap. I didn’t want to say that. I’m sorry, I know how important this stuff is to you, it’s just…” He hid his eyes behind his hands. “Being a single parent most of the time is just… hard, I guess.” Shortly his gaze snapped to the other monitor where - Tony felt the blood in his veins turn to ice. Pete was gone.
“Hi kid.” He needed a moment to clear his head enough to forget his previous panic about Peter’s whereabouts before he motioned for the kid to come closer. Which Peter did without hesitation. Thank God for small miracles.
“It’s ok, baby. You don’t have to say anything if you don’t want to or can’t think of something. You can just sit here with me and show Papa you’re there. That ok?”
Tony had never believed in Christmas spirit, but right now, face buried in the crook of Steve’s neck, Peter’s hair slightly tingling at his nose, the lights of the Christmas tree annoyingly cheerfully blinking away in the background, he thought that maybe it was time to change that attitude.
Tony thought he hated that, too. It’s not that he’d needed his husband, but the last years it had been easier. Especially concerning not to spiral down to dark places like he’d had before their relationship had started.
Steve ignores Tony’s near-silent, gleeful snickering while he apologizes to his son who is probably the only one trying to pay attention to the Tooth Fairy swooning over Jack Frost’s shiny teeth.
, and that had nothing to do with him being prude, thank you), but Peter’s giggling makes him abandon that idea rather quickly.
This year everything’s different. Peter knows that. Everybody knows that. A global pandemic can’t be argued away just like that after all. Knows that his Dad is away a lot lately. He sees him on the news more often than personally and sometimes Steve wants to deck his husband really hard for it. Then he tends to remember all the charity work he himself is doing, all the times Peter is in the care of other people, even though they’re their family, too, and wants to be angry at the world at large at the unfairness of it all and apologize profusely to his son and his husband and every member of his family for ever thinking that.
He’s still tense when he sits down next to his son, but Peter soon manages to distract him. With his babbling and sudden joyful, almost put-on mood he should be more suspicious of the kid’s motives, but he’s so strongly reminded of Tony that Steve decides to not look too closely. Instead he lets himself be swept away, lets himself get lost in working with his hands and helping his son along with his works, supplying advice about Natasha’s soon-to-be sparkly unicorn ornament and Pepper’s canvas-sized painting depicting all of the Avengers clustered around a massive, decorated Christmas tree on the common floor. At that point Steve realizes they haven’t even done
With a fond smile he watches Peter dash off only to return with his arms full of different papers, pencils and other things to do arts and crafts. He’s even carried along one of the boxes Steve keeps small parts in that don’t fit anywhere else, like paperclips, googly eyes, brass fasteners and the likes, though he can’t help but be impressed with his son.
His smirk meets that of his best friend. Bucky still looks a little ruffled, but ready for some down-time.
At which Steve simply shoves him towards the edge of the bed. “Out. Get out of my bed.” Thankfully Tony’s awake enough by now that he doesn’t fall, but simply laughs while scrambling off. Steve shakes his head, but soon joins in his jovial mood. It’s Christmas after all and he’s actually dying to find out what they’ve come up with.
“You’re going to love it.” Tony’s fingers dance back from his side to his stomach. Steve feels one of his eyebrows jump up.
Tony couldn’t decide what emotion weighed out the others. Hurt, anger, disappointment and worry all swirled together in his stomach. It was a bad time getting in front of a screen and recording a message, he knew that, cognitively, but he did it nevertheless.
Together they got out the Christmas decorations and started to turn the boring green thing into something to rival Peter’s Uncle Bruce - spectacular and full of color. On the outside Peter was excited, but Tony could sense something, or rather someone, was missing dearly.
Steve didn’t leave his personal space while stretching up to hang the mistletoe. Under different circumstances Tony would’ve found it hot that he did it one-handed, but the accompanied flinch made him pause and frown. Steve never flinched, at least not from simple physical tasks like hanging up a damn mistletoe.
