‘Same thing.’
‘Bruce is here? And Thor?’ Tony jumps up and grimaces as the action makes the arc reactor grind against his ribs. Peter is by his side in an instant, ready to support him should he need it, and they make their way to the elevator.
‘So this is mine,’ Peter points to the door as they walk past, ‘and Ned and MJ are usually in these two.’
‘The kid literally held my
‘Hey!’ Tony shouts, moving to intercept her and sending them both spiralling out of the window. Unfortunately she manages to grab the end of Vision’s cloak on her way out, bringing him out with them. Spinning them around Tony tries desperately to throw her off and grab onto Vision, but she’s determined not to let the humanoid go, and the three of them spiral down the side of the lab and towards the hard ground below. He can hear Wanda and Bruce shouting their names, and on one of their spins he thinks he sees the young woman following them down, her power controlling her decent.
Something in that sentence stung. ‘Didn’t seem to be doing any harm
‘Wade,’ Peter’s eyes catch the missing trouser leg, ‘what happened to your leg?’
‘Works for me,’ Peter says, then proceeds to drag Wade out of the common area.
Bucky looks at him with a small frown, then a look of comprehension dawns on his face and he bursts out laughing. ‘Seriously Stevie? How can you be
Natasha breathes a sigh of relief once the door to the car closes and she slumps in her seat, closing her eyes against the thumping in her skull.
Peter rubs his forehead where a headache is starting to form and tries to ignore the gnawing in his stomach.
Tony laughs and shakes his head, looking between Steve’s outstretched hand and the door to the venue. Steve begins to lower his hand, thinking the billionaire is going to refuse the dance, when he hears a soft ‘oh screw it’ and there’s a warm, callused hand in his own. He doesn’t give the other man time to reconsider and pulls him closer, moving them in time to the music.
‘This is decidedly more serious that you first thought isn’t it?’ Stephen raises an eyebrow at him, then waves off whatever reply Stark is about to give. ‘Later. Right now I need to sort out the transfer of my patient. You have a new arm ready I assume?’
‘I did want to reach through and ask once or twice,’ he grins and taps his forehead, ‘but I didn’t want to distract you from what I know was an important milestone for you and Thor.’
‘May!’ Peter may possibly be even brighter red than Steve right now.
what are you doing? Ugh! Come here,’ he picks his baby cousin up again and sits down on the sofa with here. ‘No, no protests. Now give me a second and… Karen! Can you get some pictures up of the team please? I think it’s time for a bedtime story.’
‘Vis!’ she shouts, her power dancing at her fingertips before she can second guess herself. ‘Get everyone away.’ Her power wraps around the debris, and she strains against the weight. ‘Hurry!’
Wade’s jaw is still firmly set, but he looks a little more likely to listen. ‘Just…someone from my past who I killed. A long time ago.’
‘Now,’ Loki claps his hands, effectively ending the argument and having everyone’s attention turn to him, ‘these are the first few steps.’ He proceeds to gradually teach the team the steps to the dance, ensuring everyone was confident before moving on to the next stage; he’s slightly smug when he notices Thor is struggling just as much as Steve is, and teases his brother about it often, which helps to ease the discomfort in Steve’s shoulders as well he’s pleased to notice.
‘Answer me,’ he growls. ‘What are you doing here and drawing attention to yourself?’
The smug grin Lautenus gives him in answer does not fill him with confidence. ‘Of course dear brother-’
‘Missed you too, sunshine. Now let me guess: Cap sent you to make sure I didn’t get his best friend arrested?’ he hopes he keeps the bitterness out of his last statement. It’s not that he feels any kind of anger or jealously towards Bucky any more, the guy’s become a good friend in the time he’s been here. If he’s honest with himself, which he is more often than people realise, he’s upset that Steve hasn’t been in touch.
‘Oh not too bad,’ she says, ‘so far everyone I’ve spoken to has been polite. Though I’ve been sticking to Vision’s side like the plague. Apparently I’m not allowed to follow him to get drinks though.’
‘I guessed as much,’ Tony smirks, handing one of the drinks to her and the other to the spy at her side. ‘So, Fury, I’ve just been speaking to Carol and she told me this amazing story about a certain creature called Goose and your missing eye.’
Peter’s nervous. He’s not heard from Wade in nearly a week, and every time he phones the merc it goes straight through to answerphone. So now he’s contemplating walking into the building opposite and, honestly, he’d much rather face the Vulture again.
The team introduce the Guardians to ice skating, followed by carollers. But the carols don't quite go according to plan.
‘Damn it.’
‘Scott Lang’s just turned up in a cab, boss. Captain Rogers and Mr Wilson have already gone to meet him.’
‘Yeah, come on, we’ll swing by and get cheeseburgers.’
‘Oh shut it,’ he shoves her through the door, a small smile betraying him. The bar is busy but Peter still recognises some of the faces from the last time he was here; he directs Wanda to the bar and gives Weasel a small smile as the man raises an eyebrow at him.
‘Well see these energy signatures? They reminded me of blood in a human body right? So if we can control the energy going to the wound we might be able to do something so-’
‘Alright let me wriggle back then I can get you mostly out.’ As he starts to move back there’s a horrible vibration through the building and the debris above them starts to groan.
‘The kid is
‘We should probably get ready to go upstairs,’ Steve says, regret in his voice.
A/N: Hi everyone! I'm doing double updates from now on so I shall leave this and go and get the next chapter ready to post!
Steve’s not sure he’d be able to cope either. He’s not sure
‘Aren’t you supposed to be coming in separately though?’ Peter points out.
‘Hit me with a sedative,’ he says, feeling the strength returning to his limbs already. ‘I don’t think they know I’m Spider-Man so they only gave me enough for a normal person. Already starting to wear off.’ He looks around and notices one man out cold on the floor, another is lying not far from him, his face is turned away but there’s a suspicious looking red patch starting to grow underneath the body. ‘What did you do?’
‘And now,’ the Headmaster returns to the microphone, ‘we have a history presentation from Peter Parker. Come on up, Peter.’
‘Thanks, Captain Rogers I’ll be there in a minute,’ Peter says, relief evident on his face.
‘And you, Peter. Thank you for giving me another chanccccce.’
‘Hail HYDRA.’
‘We already have,’ Zemo chuckles, then turns to Bucky. ‘Knock them all out and bring them in.’
‘What other options, Buck?’ Steve’s whisper is hard, fear making its way into his heart.
Steve laughs and gives him another kiss. ‘That’s very true. The only person allowed to carry you away from our bed is me.’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘I love you too,’ Steve replies against his lips and kisses him again.
‘So what are we going to do?’ Steve asks. ‘Surely with this we can take him down once and for all?’
Natasha looks at him as he struggles to answer and takes pity on him. ‘Hydrophobia,’ she replies.  ‘From his time in Afghanistan.’
‘If he’s so busy why does he have time to warn you about mentioning food fights around Thor?’ Peter asks.
‘Who’s Ajax?’
‘What do you think it is, Wade?’ Steve asks. When the merc doesn’t respond he sighs in frustration. ‘I can’t agree to send a member of the team with you if I don’t know what they’re getting themselves into. That’s just irresponsible leadership and I won’t endanger anyone that way. And it’s obviously dangerous, Wade, because you won’t even contemplate taking Peter with you.’
‘People are
Steve bursts out laughing. ‘I told you he’d get you back for it eventually.’
‘I’m just hoping we get acknowledged by the team when we arrive, then we get to be as cool as you will be for this entire trip,’ is Ned’s response.
‘Well I didn’t exactly trust Vision to cook when you were in hospital. The guy doesn’t have taste buds. No offense, Vis.’
‘Which is exactly why I still pay her,’ Tony sighs in relief. ‘Your brother’s in the best hands we can give him Thor.’
‘Nah, not really,’ he reassures him, ‘you’ve just been confused and unsure, and you’ve been listening to your doubts more than you have the man who loves you.’
‘Seconded!’ Tony shouts from the kitchenette. ‘What?’ he says at Steve’s frown. ‘You know I fully agree with everything Bucky is saying. The only reason I’m not over there right now is because you literally threatened to leave our bed for a week.’
is breaking my perfect record.’
‘Yeah Baby Boy?’
Peter scowls at him. ‘Who made you my babysitter? I’ve got enough of them already thank you very much.’
Bucky shakes his head. ‘Nope, ne- HEY!’ he wipes the dough from his face and scowls at the teenager. ‘What was that for?’
The look his friend gives him Steve can’t quite place before the other soldier gives a quiet laugh. ‘Oh Stevie, you’re even more oblivious than you were before the war.’
‘Join you in leaning against the wall?’ Natasha asks with a raised eyebrow.
‘Good idea,’ Matt says, putting away his billy clubs. ‘We’ll head back to mine.’
‘He’s not going to risk it at any rate,’ Rhodes agrees, looking over at Steve. ‘Tony taking the blame for Berlin-’
‘Peter,’ Wanda’s voice is filled with tears and Bucky squeezes her hand again, ‘I saw the nightmares they gave you.
‘December 19
He tears his seatbelt off and jumps out of the cab, running around to the back door and flings it open as Natasha climbs out of her own.
‘Tony! You can’t just disappear at your own party,’ he knows that voice.
‘Tony-’
He frowns when he sees it’s an unknown number and turns, taking a few steps back from the soldier to give himself some space. When he opens it his blood runs cold. There’s a picture of Peter, taken through a school window, sat at his desk looking up at the teacher, a pencil in his hand as he takes notes. Underneath is a short message:
‘You’ve not got a suit, Steve,’ Tony reminds him, ‘you going to be alright letting me take the biggest hits since mine is here?’ He taps his reactor.
‘Morning. FRIDAY says you’re going to check on Strange?’ Natasha asks.
Against his better judgement Peter nods, crossing his arms over his chest. ‘You’ve got two minutes. If you start spouting the same stuff as Mr Stark I’m leaving mid-sentence.’
Laura smiles in thanks and takes her and Clint’s mugs of coffee, leaving him alone again in the kitchenette. He starts making pancakes, humming softly to himself and trying not to feel too happy with himself. A pair of arms sneak their way around his middle when he’s making the third pancake and he looks over his shoulder.
‘Peter,’ he says, shaking her hand. ‘I’m an intern with Stark Industries. But sometimes I go up to help at the facility, hence why I know Wanda so well.’
‘And the money?’ she asks.
‘Thank you. Sorry I called you up like this.’
?’ Steve asks.
‘Why is everyone calling it that?’ he mutters. ‘Can we move on please?’
Bucky?’ she demands.
. Do you want to eat tonight or tomorrow? I know for a fact your super-soldier stomach is going to start protesting if we don’t get this finished within the hour.’
‘But if you were to take someone as consort who was not a Jotun, or who could not produce an heir, you would be leaving behind a succession crisis and that is not going to help keep things stable now,’ Bucky finishes quietly for him.
Tony sighs. ‘No idea. I guess…maybe he’s right and Venom kept some of him like Pete kept some of Venom. Maybe when they joined again he saw enough to know he could trust him. I don’t like it-’
‘Err…where did Loki and Bucky go?’ he asks when he gets back.
‘I don’t want to walk into your workshop and find you with another puzzle on your neck,’ Rhodey’s soft voice adds and Tony has to fight the rising guilt at the memories that raises.
Tony grins at the raccoon. ‘Never underestimate our ability to find space, Rocket. Next important question: do we trust Bucky to go Christmas tree shopping this year?’
‘What we going to do about the fan, Tony?’ Rhodes asks.
was bad with talking to myself,’ Wade grumbles.
‘All done for you, Peter,’ his AI replies as his aunt opens the door.
Peter looks over to see Strange kneeling by a sobbing Wanda; he catches the doctor’s eye and sees him nod. All remaining fight leaves his body. Wanda broke the conditioning.
‘Maybe next year we can have a team quiz?’
Wade meets his eyes and there’s a lost look in them that Peter hasn’t seen in a long time. ‘Baby Boy there’s something I should have told you a while ago, but I wasn’t sure how to. After this mission it’s clear I’ve got to tell all of you just…just promise me you’ll never doubt that I love you alright?’
There’s a chorus of agreement for the plans and Sam can’t help the smile that tugs at his mouth as they all lean in to the plans hovering in front of them. Everyone looks a little more relaxed as the conversation turns to good natured arguments on how much of the basement Tony was allowed to keep for his workshop and whether Bruce was allowed some of the attic for his lab or if he had to share the basement with Tony.
years older,’ Peter rolls his eyes and he can’t help but smile at the slight relax of the teen’s shoulders.
‘I know,’ Peter cuts him off more sharply than he means to. ‘I just want to make sure. Just in case.’
‘No but we need a talk,’ he says, stepping into the room. ‘Fuck off, Weasel.’
‘Sure we do,’ Wade says, voice that cheerful tone he only gets when he’s about to do something
‘What the hell happened?’ Bucky asks again.
Natasha manages to do as she’s instructed, praying as she does to a god she doesn’t believe in that she’s not making any of his injuries worse. The Wakandan materialises back at her side and hands her a gun.
‘And who is telling Loki?’
There’s a rumbling sound. A little like thunder, and a little like an out of control train. Everyone on the battlefield pauses, as a kaleidoscope of colour shoots down from the sky. The skies above them turn dark and angry, and lightning flashes. Tony can’t help but grin.
‘Yeah, you ended up being his childhood hero,’ Rhodes smiles at the look on Steve’s face. ‘Apparently he even dressed up as you one Hallowe’en to go trick-or-treating with kids from his school. Howard had your old shield from when you were doing the shows and let Tony use it for his costume.’
‘Oh boy,’ Tony grins.
‘Don’t know. No attackers since the bomb. Stay down,’ his sentences are short as he takes in their surroundings. A handgun already out. ‘You got any-’
‘Asgardians are no cowards,’ Loki growls. ‘But neither do we take lives unnecessarily.’
’ Tony cuts across him with a sigh, trust the soldier to immediately go tactical, ‘I mean… I mean
‘Fine,’ Peter agrees, rolling his neck to loosen some of the tension.
Rosie gurgles and laughs, blond hair curling around her head like a halo and her blue eyes smiling.
Bucky laughs. ‘Thanks, Thor. Sometimes it’s difficult to see where we failed the first time-’
‘But, Tony-’
‘Only when it’s physically impossible to get them to leave,’ Weasel replies. ‘This little punk nearly ripped Buck’s arm off last time he was here.’
‘This is basically your version of swiping on Tinder,’ she retorts.
‘Right, sorry. Yeah I’ve met him a few times on patrol. He’s not taking jobs in the city, he’s just… I don’t know. I think he wants a new start.’
‘Thor if you wanted to go get
drinks after that…’
‘Hey!’
‘Nope,’ Rhodes chuckles, ‘Jarvis as in Edwin Jarvis, Howard’s old butler.’
‘Course you don’t,’ the inventor scoffs.
Barnes, decorated World War Two veteran and former Howling Commando, so we can get this ballet recital over with.’
‘We’re fine, where are you?’ Steve reassures him.
‘He’s really trying to get back the Avengers’ popularity back isn’t he?’ Ned comments, putting down a finished model.
Tony grins at the term, it’s only the second time Peter’s called him that and he absolutely loves it when he does. The first time he’d been half asleep, this second time he’s drunk, but one day he’s hoping he’ll hear it when Peter’s fully conscious. ‘Anytime. You think you’re alright to climb back into bed yet?’
‘Are you alright?’ she asks, turning to kneel down next to them and checking them over.
until we get back. Understood?’
‘Is it just me,’ Nick Fury says, entering the room, ‘or are we still more interested in fighting each other rather than planning how we will be defending ourselves against the bastard that intends to wipe out half the universe? Now I suggest you all pipe down and sit your arses down so we can start
back where they could keep an eye on them and where I wasn’t potentially going to put you guys at risk? Come on-’
‘Are you asking me if I’m intending to marry him instead of Captain America?’ Peter notices the tightness around Tony’s eyes that gives away the man is not happy. He’s become very good at reading his mentor’s moods so as not to annoy him. That’s a definite warning sign.
‘Wade?’ Bruce’s voice makes him pause. ‘If you had the choice would you go back to your dimension?’
a superhero,’ the man says, tightening his arm around his waist, ‘trust me I’ve seen you in action enough times to know. But you want to know how I realised just how special you really are, Baby Boy? You’re the only person since I got my scars to look at me without some form of shock on your face.’ Peter looks up at the man in surprise, and only sees sincerity in his brown eyes. ‘I took off my mask and you
‘You wouldn’t let me,’ Tony points out as everyone else digs in. ‘Plus it meant I had a good excuse not to do one of the jobs.’
‘Would that have been because Ultron was trying to make sure he could control the stone?’ Peter pipes up from behind them, where he’s watching everything in apparent wide-eyed wonder.
Tony speaks to May Parker and tells the team Spider-Man will be visiting more often; and Bucky tries to look after Tony since he won't look after himself.
A knock at his door pulls him from his thoughts. ‘Come in,’ he calls, rolling onto his back so he can see the door without having to get up.
‘Let me guess: Honeybear won right?’ Tony smirks, handing Steve a steaming mug of coffee.
‘Nat?’
‘Something isn’t right,’ he mumbles to Steve. ‘They may not have finished what they started, but she’s been through hell.’
Thank you to everyone again who has left kudos on this story, a huge thank you to everyone who has left comments, and of course to everyone who is still sticking with it! I really do appreciate any comments that are left as they've generated a couple of small scene ideas and plot points for me, so please do keep leaving them.
he tells himself, wondering if Tony Stark has ever
‘Yeah, just in a way I’m going to miss this place,’ she laughs. ‘You two going to wait at the facility for us to get back or you going to wait at home?’
Tony barks a laugh. ‘Nope just can’t stand the silence.’
Natasha’s eyes go back to Tony, and she finds him staring straight back at her; she opens her mouth to say something, then stops at the barely perceptible shake of the head from the inventor. Then she notices his fingers. One hand is half covering the reactor, like he used to when he was feeling threatened out of the suit, but his index finger is tapping away.
‘I don’t remember a lot of that,’ he tells Strange, ‘when Venom was in control I didn’t know what was happening.’
Steve promises himself, catching Tony’s eyes and giving him a small smile before turning his attention back to the film.
‘Wakanda Forever!’ the guards respond and hurry to do as they’ve been commanded.
‘Stay safe,’ Wanda says as the call ends and their faces disappear. Tony wishes more than anything he could just leave the trial now, but he needs to be on the stand again tomorrow.
‘Come here, soldier,’ he whispers, beginning to lose his vision, ‘hold on to me. Keep me with you.’
‘And…and I’m scared that maybe that’s just something I’m telling myself. That the truth…’
‘Scared because you’ve already revealed your secret superhero identity to two people already and you’ve got not even got through twenty-four hours of this trip and you think you’re going to end up revealing it to everyone?’
‘Any clues from the markings?’ Tony asks.
‘This is one I
‘Stop,’ she cuts him off, voice hard.
‘Yes, Captain.’
‘Oh my god!’ Peter buries his head in a pillow. ‘That’s it we’re cancelling the school trip. He’s going to out me within a day!’
‘Seven.’
‘I don’t think he would have been overly surprised actually,’ Tony’s voice is quiet, eyes gazing back even more than before. Then he shakes his head and clears his throat, laying down his cards. ‘Read ‘em and weep boys.’
‘No one,’ he turns to the other team members in the common area, ‘is to touch any of that until Peter is finished. Or I’ll get FRIDAY to lock you in your rooms.’
‘Just….buy me….enough time…to stand up,’ he gasps out, trying to block out the pain coursing through his body.
‘They have families,’ Tony explains. ‘Let them come back on the understanding they are retired and are not to return to the field in any way unless called upon by us. Their equipment could be left with a neutral party that both sides can trust.’
Thankfully it doesn’t take them much longer to get the situation under control. Within the hour Natasha’s informing them they’re heading back. Sam notices Peter sneak out the door while everyone else’s attention is taken up, but decides not to stop him. He probably needs some time alone before Tony gets back.
‘Perhaps we should sit and explain,’ Valkyrie suggests. ‘I am Valkyrie, this is Thor, and we have just come from Earth where there is a team preparing to face Thanos, three of the Stones are already in their possession and they are attempting to discover more about their nature in order to use them to defeat Thanos when he arrives. We know Thanos has already taken the power stone from Nova and laid waste to the planet.’
‘But brother-’
‘That’s true,’ Nick says, ‘and the main focus for now should be Thanos. You read through and see if you’re happy with everything suggested, let me and T’Challa know if there’s anything you think should be changed or if you have any questions. Then let
that if something like New York happened again they couldn’t sit around and wait for a panel to make a decision or too many lives would be lost.
‘I thank you Spiderling for your kindness towards my brother,’ Thor says.
‘What the hell is this?’ Rocket asks, holding up his sweater, a racoon face decorating the front surrounded by a variety of guns.
‘Stop it!’ Bucky yells, lashing out with a leg and sending Loki staggering backwards.
‘We had to put him in the Hulk containment chamber,’ Shuri laughs, ‘it was the only way to stop him storming downstairs.’
‘So,’ he turns to his boyfriend, ‘she’s not as scary as you thought right?’
‘You and me both,’ she grins, flipping her dagger as she reaches for another apple.
Tony raises both eyebrows so high they nearly disappear into his hairline. ‘I’m sorry, what?’
‘Here, Tony,’ Loki appears in front of him with a glass of something dark blue, ‘I’m taking some to Thor too.’
‘I’m not entirely sure how that would come up in conversation in the first place,’ he rolls his eyes, sighing happily as Steve runs his hands up his sides and down his back. He winces a little as some of the muscles in his lower back protest at his movement.
Clint looks at him, face open for the first time in their entire acquaintance. ‘Thanks, Loki.’
‘Ah Anthony how nice of you to join us. I was just about to give young Peter here a job interview.’
‘Good point. I’m an angel really. I deserve a medal.’
‘Hey!’ the barrel of a gun suddenly appears in Peter’s face and he jumps back, resisting the urge to set off a web shooter. ‘What did I tell you little shits about talking?’
yeah,’ he admits, ‘but you’ve got to admit it is funny seeing Fury nearly burst a blood vessel.’
Despite his best intentions, Peter’s walk falters and he knows no matter what he says next Deadpool isn’t going to believe. Not unless he tells him the truth. ‘What are you talking about? I’ve had a long patrol-’
‘We already promised to protect your people,’ Steve reminds him, ‘and we will continue to do so. The same goes for Loki.’
‘Boss would you like me to alert Captain Rogers?’
‘Yeah well you’ve been all sorts of impossible so far, Baby Boy. I really wouldn’t be surprised by anything you pull out of the bag any more. Now I really do think we should get you home before you manage to convince me to remove
‘None of them have deserted me, I just don’t always choose to use them,’ then he raises an eyebrow. ‘And you’re avoiding the question which means I’m right.’
Tony doesn’t argue, doesn’t say anything else, just let’s Steve continue his ministrations. Slowly, very slowly, the genius relaxes as Steve focuses on getting rid of the grime and dried blood from his body until he’s finally clean and Steve can pull out the plug, letting the filthy water flow down the drain as he reaches for a towel. He doesn’t let Tony stand up, just bends down and scoops him up out of the tub, wrapping the towel around him and taking him back to the bed.
Despite everything Steve chuckles, remembering the words from their first battle. ‘Yeah, but we picked you up a cheeseburger so I hope you can forgive us.’
‘Any news on why he was taking longer than anticipated?’ Tony asks.
the merc’s words and tone come floating back to him. Now he thinks maybe he can place some of the emotions in that voice: sadness and guilt. Peter suddenly realises how much he
‘Where the hell is Wade?’ Wanda asks. ‘And what the hell is that thing?’
‘He’s not the only one,’ Sam agrees.
‘Well we might just have a look anyway,’ the second man says. Before Peter can try to get Wanda to move he hears the sound of guns cocking.
‘He’s good,’ Wanda answers before Tony can do more than open his mouth. ‘He was caught up in that hostage situation not that long after I arrived,’ she explains, ‘when we were getting the hostages out of them one snuck up behind me and he took them out. Without him I’d be dead.’
Rhodes laughs. ‘Unfortunately not, she’s going to spend it with my aunt this year and have a quiet one. I offered to join them but….well my aunt isn’t doing too good and I think Mama wants to spend it just the two of them.’
‘Where are you going? Which friend?’
‘Well you aren’t supposed to still be out here.’ They turn to see a smiling Pepper Potts, hands on her hips and shaking her head as the rest of the wedding party follows her. She’s in the same dress as Natasha and she looks just as stunning.
‘What do you remember about them?’ Bucky asks. ‘You knew them at a different time to us, it’d be nice to hear about them.’
‘I can do it,’ Natasha volunteers, ‘makes sense to have a man and a woman.’
Love always,
‘Surprisingly well,’ the trickster laughs, ‘though there were a few…’
‘James Buchanan Barnes don’t you think that argument is going to work on me.’
‘What’s going on?’ Sam asks, once they’re all in the room. ‘Why are we not waiting for Luke, Caesar and Paul to get back?’
‘We talked because we were
That’s the one that finally convinces him, and he half falls and half jumps into Tony’s hug, letting the inventor hold him so tight it nearly hurts and run a hand through his hair. ‘Or,’ this time Tony’s voice is quiet so only he can hear, ‘that the first time you called me “Dad” was when you’d had a nightmare after Wade left when you were first free of Venom and I carried you back to spend the night with me and Steve. It was the best thing I’d ever heard in my life and I promised myself I’d do everything I could to live up to it.’
Bucky shakes his head mutely, still trying to process the information Tony has just given him. He’s never heard the story of how the inventor became Iron Man, and now he regrets not getting Steve to tell him.
‘I was still smarter than them,’ he says.
I'd love to hear your thoughts on who the enemy is and where you think the series is heading next. As always let me know if you have any requests. The next instalment is done, so I'll start posting that in a couple of weeks but I think the next thing to be posted after that will be something different. I'm struggling to get the writing flowing for this series again, so like before I'm going to work on one or two short projects to get the creativity flowing again before coming back. Hopefully I'll manage to do it all before I finish posting the next instalment so it won't even be that big of a gap for you. Let me know if there's any requests for different projects! I'm thinking of another fairytale so if there's any preferences let me know - I'm contemplating a WinterIron one this time for a bit of a change.
‘We’ll head out and meet you as soon as my time on the stand is finished,’ Tony says.
‘Nothing coming up, Peter. Only reports of police being called to intervene in domestic disputes, and I wouldn’t suggest getting involved in those,’ the AI responds.
‘So you agree I
As always here's your sneak peek:
‘I don’t see what everyone has against Doctor Strange,’ Peter huffs.
‘If he managed to convince Fury he was trustworthy, why would Pete not trust him?’ Sam counters.
There’s a small smile on Loki’s face. ‘Are you bargaining or threatening, Stark?’
Thank you so much to everyone who has left kudos, you have no idea how much it makes me smile when I get an email to say I've had some left. Also huge thank you to seireidoragon for leaving a review! I really appreciate all the support.
‘Hey! There you are!’ he looks up as Wade hurries towards him down the corridor. ‘I was wondering where you’d scurried off to Spidey.’
‘For you maybe,’ Shuri rolls her eyes and Tony has to bite back a grin at the offended look on the archer’s face. ‘But the trail leads back to a
to. You’re one of my best friends, Tony, and I’d like to think I know you pretty well too. But that means we also know how to push each other’s buttons, so when we start having a small disagreement it just spirals.’
‘How’s things going with that girl you’re seeing?’
‘Hmm… I thought so. And we’ve also got Wade Wilson.’
‘But it would-’
‘Are you ready or what, Barnes?’ she rolls her eyes.
Peter puts his phone away and looks over at Deadpool. ‘They on your list already?’
‘You better not still have a knife under the mattress.’
.’ At Steve’s raised eyebrow he adds. ‘Ok a week. I wouldn’t last a month. I’d last a week.’
Loki grins. ‘I thought you’d never ask.’
‘Look, I’ll be honest,’ Tony starts pacing, ‘Pepper, that’s my assistant,’ he says to Steve, ‘who is basically my mom at this point, doesn’t think I should be telling you this but I think you deserve to know considering how much this has affected you. So I’m hoping you’ll keep it quiet until I’ve got everything sorted out.’
Quill lets out a sigh. ‘Alright yeah, it’s a lot to take in and process. It’s weird because I don’t have that many memories of Christmas as such, and I’m wondering if this is anything like what I used to do or not. Plus there’s kind of a bit of pressure on with the rest of the Guardians here and I’d be saying about how great Christmas is…’
‘HYDRA has him!’ Bucky roars. ‘I’m not going to sit back and stick to the Accords and let them do to him what they did to me.’
‘I am fine, thank you for the offer.’
Fuck I hope Barnes got out, or there is no way I’m going to be able to go back and face the Avengers.
‘I am?’ Thanos asks, though he doesn’t appear to be too concerned.
‘You didn’t let me get to them yet.’
Love you all!
worked on them?’ Steve asks, shocked that he’s been so lucky as to find one of the very people he needs to speak to.
Natasha raises an eyebrow at him from where she’s nursing a cup of coffee in one of the chairs. ‘What have you done now?’ she sighs.
‘Hulk helped!’
‘Brother! You wound me!’
‘Huh,’ Bruce blinks at the youngster, ‘that’s not a bad idea, kid. What made you think of it?’
‘Sounds fair,’ Tony says. ‘But those of us with powers or enhanced abilities have to hold them back. For fairness’ sake obviously.’
‘She did a lot better having you here to bounce off of anyway,’ Natasha adds, ‘literally in one or two cases. Though if you two continue to make as much progress as you did today we may have to get a professional tutor in for you.’
She pauses, wondering how best to word what she’s been battling with in her mind for years now. ‘I don’t really know their full potential,’ she admits, ‘and I don’t know if I can control them or not and I’m worried…I’m worried that
‘You guys alright? Okay stupid question: are you guys still in once piece?’
‘I need your help,’ he admits, voice small.
‘There’s been plenty of talking going on,’ she replies, raising an eyebrow, ‘and I’m pretty sure we’ve both been involved.’
‘You mean I’m not supposed to look like I’m covered in wallpaper paste?’
‘You’re not dating an alien are you?’
Here's your sneak peek at the next chapter:
Tony waves him off. ‘Honestly I should be thanking you. The fact that it’s been so successful has meant the board is happy to give me the go ahead to put more focus into it.’
as well as the team, Tony.’
‘Yeah: we got to find them, sure. We’ve also got to be prepared for the fact that we might not find them until
‘He did,’ Peter told her. ‘I was there when he died. I tried to stop the blood but I couldn’t.’
Matt nods. ‘Follow me to my office, Peter. Foggy? Don’t breathe a word of this to anyone.’
He pauses to consider. ‘We wait. It’ll be getting hungry soon, then it’ll be a case of following the bodies. Be patient. It certainly isn’t.’
‘Alright kids, around the field, round the back of the facility and finishing back here. We all ready?’ Steve asks, the other three nod. ‘Alright on your marks, set…go!’
so much yelling.
‘I know, but the thing is,’ Clint pauses, running his glass between his hands as he leans on the balcony rail, then he sighs, hanging his head, ‘the thing is I realised that, well, perhaps I wasn’t being the most rational holding on to this hatred when you’d proven that you’re not the same person you were when you attacked New York.’
‘Love you, Pete.’
As they get to the top they freeze. The soldier raises his gun and aims it at them. ‘Now why don’t you stop running around kids? We haven’t got time to play tag.’
Vision smiles slightly and nods, standing up to leave. ‘Not that you’ll need it, but good luck Tony. I hope Captain Rogers appreciates what you’ve been doing as much as we do.’
‘I thought they were going to get into a fist fight,’ Steve laughs shaking his head. ‘Thank God Gabe stepped in before I had to.’
Peter frowns as the driver pulls up outside the building, the flags of Wakanda flying above the doorway. ‘Why are we here? We’re supposed to go to a hotel.’
‘Now, now, Barton it’s only in the spirit of the challenge, I swear,’ he cackles, dodging another apple and unfortunately missing catching Scott as he leaves with Cassie.
‘I was just doing what I was told,’ he mumbles.
‘Merry Christmas everyone!’ Clint yells as he and his family enter the common area, the kids running up to give Natasha a hug with shouts of greeting.
‘I’m here, Lokes,’ Tony lands next to him, walking at his side and Loki will never tell him how grateful he is. ‘You have something of ours,’ the billionaire says to their enemy, pointing at Lorena.
‘Oh man I just want to see Black Panther! Do you think he’ll be over from Wakanda for the trip?’
‘As you wish,’ the trickster replies, and Tony thinks he hears him move towards the kitchenette.
‘No,’ Sam throws down the sandpaper. ‘No I won’t leave it, Bucky. The way he looked at you when we did the dancing last week? You can’t tell me he doesn’t want you.’
As always here's your sneak peek:
‘I can’t believe you had a food fight without me, Baby Boy. I mean, really it hurts, cuts me real deep. How could you even think to start something like that without me? I honestly thought it was you and me to the end, you know? And then you go and do something like this? I’m not sure we can ever move on from this. It’s just-’
‘That was entirely your fault,’ Rhodes frowns at him, ‘you were the one getting the drinks and I
‘Hey, Tony,’ Peter says from behind his mask.
‘Can we focus please?’ Steve frowns at the rest of the team. ‘Come on Pete, put your mask on and Tony’ll get Karen to block out your sight.’
‘If this is where I think it is,’ Strange smiles, ‘you really are a genius, Tony Stark.’
‘Don’t know what?’ he asks, suddenly feeling rather nervous.
‘I don’t want you to,’ I throw back. Maybe pissing off the personification of death is not the best idea in the world, but I’ve never been known for my brilliant ideas. Not where my pissing off people is concerned anyway.
‘Who’s already been chosen?’ Steve asks.
project.’
‘Well… yes!’
‘Pete-’
‘I thought you said we were heading to bed?’
Interesting note on Loki using Mjolnir: I did a little bit of research and there is apparently one alternate reality where Loki is the one who wields Mjolnir instead of Thor.  I wasn't sure about having Loki able to wield Mjolnir all the time in this story, as I think he still has some way to go, but in that moment he just wanted to be worthy enough to save his brother, so he was able to use the hammer. Let me know what you think of that.
‘Got you,’ he pants, ripping open the drawer and pulling two out. He’s not taking any chances in case something happens to this one.
you. Just until the circus,’ he gestures towards the gates of the facility where the journalists they’d had to drive through earlier had been camped, ‘has left. For
There’s no response.
Tony frowns. ‘How did I not know this?’
The sound of a gunshot rings out and Peter looks down, expecting to see some sign of a bullet. When he looks back up the man has crumpled to the floor. ‘Pool!’ he spots the mercenary behind the men. They turn around and the merc sends off a few more rounds, felling a soldier with each shot.
Peter groans as Steve laughs behind him. ‘No, you’re not,’ he reassures him, ‘Captain’s orders.’
Dr Higgs and get her to help look over him alright? Make sure they’re in one of the private rooms. Ross
‘What time are we leaving tomorrow?’ Bruce asks as he takes a sip of his tea.
‘You shouldn’t have made such a fuss about taking off the mask,’ he laughs, then dodges out of range of the merc and into kitchen to see if there was anything he could help with.
In answer there’s an ear splitting roar. He and Natasha look at each other.
‘Any last words Spider-Man?’ one of them asks.
Ross lets out a bark of laughter. ‘You’re following to heel like a dog, Stark. And the Council thinks you’re a leader of the team! At the end of the day you’re nothing without that suit, so you’ve just got to fall into step like a good little soldier.’
‘Well, uh, I see you already know Mr Parker, Mr Osborn, so why don’t you two buddy up for the day? Mr Parker
‘What
‘You did well to fight it like you did,’ the man comments. Then they are back in the library at the Sanctum.
‘Wade,’ Tony says again. ‘Take it off.’ They have a staring contest which, for some reason, Wade decides to let him win. He sighs and puts the gun down on a shelf and then grips the top of the mask before pulling it off, looking down at the floor as he feels the other man’s eyes on him.
‘Need a lift?’ Tony grabs hold of Steve, lifting both of them into the air and heading towards the hut where they’d left Thanos.
‘I’m with Steve,’ Tony says. ‘Otherwise we’ll end up having both super soldiers on the same team and no one wants that.’
As he takes his seat in his next lesson, shaking his head at Ned’s curious look, a new wave of dread catches him and he holds in a groan and resists the urge to smack his head on the desk.
Tony blinks. Then the slurry voice registers in his sleep fogged brain. ‘Peter are you drunk?’
The others had engaged the army, while he, Steve and Thor had faced Thanos, hoping to get the gauntlet from him. It hadn’t gone so well. Hence why he and Steve are now in the middle of fighting the army with the others.
‘I tried to cheer Wanda up and ended up getting a book thrown at me,’ Bucky grumbles.
Steve and Tony have a heart-to-heart as Tony continues to try and protect the team at the cost of himself. Peter gets a detention, and sees Deadpool again for the first time since the 'incident'
Tony frowns when he notices the redhead falling into step next to him. ‘Where are you going?’
‘He didn’t,’ Rhodes laughs, ‘I’m pretty sure Pepper looked over the plans and made sure to add some storage space knowing how much of a collector he is.’
Natasha laughs at the look on Tony’s face. ‘Yeah, he’s going to ruin the competition when you let him take over SI. You’ve created a monster Tony Stark.’
A/N: Hi everyone! Wow nearly at the end of this story; I'll be really really interested to hear what you all think about this chapter and where you think this next series is going to go. This was my answer to my own question of: how can I make the Deadpool films fit into the MCU with no X-Men around. It also then gave me ideas for where to go with some of the future instalments - which are also starting to give me headaches with the planning!
‘Why don’t you go for a nap when we get back?’ he suggests. ‘I’ll keep an eye on Steve if you want.’
‘Try not to annoy everyone, we’re not exactly ready for a war,’ Valkyrie smirks at him.
‘Now remember,’ Rhodes says in his full Colonel voice, ‘no one is buying or winning any trees without permission from me and Sam. Understood?’
‘It is indeed, and I must admit I am enjoying making my way through it all. It might be more fun with a study companion though, if you’d ever care to join me? Something tells me you would enjoy making your way through the books as much as I do.’
‘Just who
She nods and blinks quickly to try and get rid of the tears that are building.
end up controlling me instead of the other way around. We still don’t know what exactly HYDRA did to me and Pietro to give us our abilities. How do I know that I can control my powers if I let them go free?’
‘If you insist,’ Steve mock-sighs, ‘though I’m not sure how I’ll cope.’
Peter stills and tries not to pout. ‘I wasn’t fidgeting-’
did Wanda see Wade scars?’ Tony’s voice is dangerous and Peter tenses, eyes going wide as he looks to the girl for help.
‘No my title is Winter Soldier.’
‘Captain, the boss is just arriving,’ FRIDAY says.
dinner and you can have both Papa Stark and Mommy Spider hearing it. Not to mention I’d love to know what Wanda would do if she knew her adopted little brother was-’
Just then a great hulking beast that Bucky honestly has no idea how to start describing crashes through the opening in the barrier and barrels through their forces, scattering fighters from both sides in all directions.
‘Good idea,’ Wanda says, gesturing for the others to join them, ‘I’ll make hot chocolate.’
Peter can’t help a small smile and a roll of his eyes. ‘I’m not
‘I thought I already said: our mutual friend. Now open up.’ Still keeping hold of the gun, Wade opens the door and steps back to let Tony Stark enter his apartment. He closes it behind the man, watching as he surveys his apartment.
Once he’s gone Bucky looks at Steve. ‘Please don’t tell me you’re falling for Tony Stark.’
‘Huh,’ Tony blinks, ‘that’s what I do when Steve’s droning on about tactics and shit.’
‘-no he
Loki grins through the link.
‘No Tony,’ Steve says, placing his hands on the shorter man’s shoulders. ‘Please let me do this. You came into my life like some kind of Prince Charming and saved my best friend’s life, got me out from under Rumlow and gave us all a job here. Just let me do something back for you.’
As always here's your sneak peek:
‘Mr Stark can we have a photo?’
‘You mean you weren’t born in your tribe?’ Wanda asks, her voice is a lot quieter now than it ever was before, and Peter has to resist the urge to pull her into a hug.
‘Depends. Where are you taking me?’ the billionaire lifts a suggestive eyebrow.
T’Challa laughs. ‘No indeed, but I should not be surprised that she managed it.’
‘Yes Mr Wilson, sir,’ Ned squeaks. ‘Peter managed to push me out of the way.’
‘Wow I’m an idiot,’ Peter mutters, earning him a chorus of laughter from the team.
But the defenders are falling before the sheer weight of numbers, and the Jotuns are tiring as their barrier is attacked from the inside.
‘Permanent,’ she finishes for him. ‘Like it was somewhere we could stay and make our own. If…’ she pauses, taking in the expression on Tony’s face, ‘if you don’t mind, Tony?’
Tony rubs firm circles into his temples with one hand, the other keeps track of where he is on the screen in front of him. ‘You think these are the best new locations?’ he looks up at the Wakandan king.
‘I would not recommend that course of action,’ Thor growls.
‘Thor wanted to start a drinking contest, but Laura said they couldn’t do it with the kids around and Carol pointed out it would be rude to exclude the people who couldn’t make it today so they’ve decided to do it at New Year. I think even Fury is thinking of getting involved.’
A whisper of material against something solid. Reacting on pure instinct, Peter sends a web towards whatever the solid thing is and pulls. Vision lets out a sound of surprise and Peter’s only just able to dodge out of the way as the humanoid crashes into the place he was just standing.
, Steve thinks, but doesn’t say anything. He agrees.
‘Dammit I must be feeling bad,’ he mutters to himself, ‘if I’m admitting Cap was right.’ He closes his eyes and tries to hold back the tears, he’s promised himself he wouldn’t let these bastards see him cry. ‘Steve,’ he whispers, ‘please hurry.’
Bucky nods again, a small painful smile of complete understanding on his lips. As Tony starts to leave he hears the soldier say, ‘Tony? The person who makes the gun doesn’t kill the person either.’
remote and
Bucky comes to stand next to him, watching him work in silence. In spite of everything he finds the other’s quiet presence comforting. When he reaches for something to the side, a strong grip holds his wrist and spins him round; before he can protest he’s pulled into an embrace.
Peter’s excited shout and Wanda’s big smile are all the answer he needs. ‘I think you’re taking after her with your sentimental ways,’ Natasha teases him, and he just scowls at her. As he passes Steve to follow the two youngest members to the kitchenette he gives the soldier’s shoulder a squeeze. ‘Thanks, Cap.’
‘Shut the
‘What the fuck did you just say?’
‘Those two would be sickening if it wasn’t so sweet,’ Wanda laughs.
‘Yeah anyway I should probably get moving because if we pass an ice cream parlour you know Loki’s going to insist we go in so, yeah, bye,’ and with that he takes off down the corridor before Sam’s even made it down the ladder.
Please let me know what you think! I'll try not to do quite so many horrible heart breaking moments in the future.
‘But when did you even learn how to knit in the first place?’
‘You better, I’ve missed you Steve.’
‘How long will you need to get things in order here?’ Steve asks the god of thunder.
‘We’re not finding out who’s in the lead?’ Bucky questions.
‘Tony-’
‘I didn’t realise the mugger had a gun. I didn’t have my web shooters then and didn’t have any way to get rid of it. Uncle Ben must have been passing by, he came in the alley and the mugger shot him instead. I couldn’t- I didn’t-’
‘No,’ Wanda narrows her eyes, ‘we’re here to make sure you can’t take power from anyone ever again.’
you?’
Wade throws his training sticks to the side and holds his hands up in surrender. ‘Alright, no more for today.’
‘That is definitely not how it happened,’ Steve rolls his eyes. ‘But we’ll tell you more later, there’s a lot more to the story than us finally getting together.’
‘How about you both get back into bed and I’ll tell you the story of the young prince and princess from the faraway land?’
‘Sorry, Mr Stark, but you said you needed help and I didn’t want to keep you waiting.’
he thinks, aiming at one of the tyres and sending a shot into it that blows it, sending the vehicle off course for a few metres, before the driver gets it under control. ‘Damn it! Alright let’s turn this thing.’ He aims at the remaining tyres and manages to blow them, but not before the vehicle launches itself up the steps with enough force to then send it sailing straight through the doors.
‘What! Why?’
‘No!’ Tony leans back to the podium. ‘Need I remind you that not that long ago you would all happily sing the praises of Sargent James Barnes, the only member of the Howling Commandos to have given his life in service to his country. When I came back from having been tortured in Afghanistan you were all full of sympathy; this for the man who you nicknamed “The Merchant of Death”.  So let me ask you a question: why can’t you give sympathy to a decorated war hero who went through more than I ever did?’
‘I’ve already got one thanks,’ he says, pulling his phone out of his pocket. ‘And I’m running late.’ He grabs MJ’s arm and steers her and Ned around Hammer.
‘Move!’ she shouts, diving into him and sending them both flying as a giant green blur flies over them and heads into the forest.
‘You alright, kid?’ he turns to see Bucky standing in the doorway.
‘Sorry Bucky you’re on your own.’
The door opens behind them. ‘Tony don’t you dare tell me you went ahead and talked about the damn band,’ Steve’s frustrated voice comes from the doorway.
Wade groans, closing his eyes and letting his forehead rest against Peter’s. ‘You’re
Tony opens his mouth, obviously to tell the AI not to answer, but her voice cuts him off. ‘The boss has gone to bed three nights in the past week, Colonel.’
‘You’ve been listening to me too well,’ she grumbles, turning to look out over the training room and letting one of the grenades go, deciding to spend some time moving it around and looking at the changes Tony has made to her glove rather than setting it off straight away.
Next up from me though, is the next instalment in my main series 'Restoration' and it's my take on Infinity War and End Game.
‘Can I at least get FRIDAY to order in pizza?’ Tony asks. ‘I’m starving.’
Wade smiles back and raises his near empty beer bottle in a toast. ‘Wouldn’t dream of it my beautiful Widow.’
Peter just sighs and lets him go, trying to push down the doubts that, despite Wade’s words, are still clouding his mind.
He reaches out and places a hand on Tony’s shoulder, feeling the man relax under his touch. ‘I’m sorry I hurt you, Tony.’
Watery brown eyes look back at him and Peter nods. ‘I understand,’ he whispers, wiping at his eyes with his sleeve.
‘I’m sorry I never told you about your parents,’ his voice is quiet, barely a whisper now, and it hurts to talk past the emotion he’s desperately holding back. ‘I told myself I was sparing you, but I was being selfish and sparing myself. I’m so sorry for everything, Tony.’
‘Yep,’ he pops the ‘p’ and stretches. ‘Just. Next time you want hand written invitations
sake, Wanda, not mine. You don’t want to have to deal with the vultures, trust me. Let
‘Shit! Cap we got incoming!’ Clint says. ‘One vehicle heading this way at speed. We need to go now if we’re going to get away without a fight.’
Steve opens his mouth to reply then frowns and closes it, before saying quietly. ‘So did I.’ They look at each other in surprise for a couple of moments. ‘How long has it been since you slept through?’
‘What are you doing here Tony?’ Natasha asks.
‘None, I am hoping inspiration will hit soon,’ he sighs in response.
‘What, no scotch?’ At Steve’s glare Tony holds his hands up in surrender and takes the medicine. ‘Sorry,
‘Tell me we have the ones responsible,’ the king looks up at him with tear filled angry eyes. ‘Tell me we have the ones responsible for her death.’
Do let me know what you think in the comments. Thank you so much to everyone who has left comments and kudos, I really do appreciate your feedback. I know there's a couple I still need to respond to so keep an eye out for those replies soon.
He sighs and lays on his back, one arm behind his head and the other drumming a beat on the reactor with his fingers. ‘I guess, with everything that happened before, I was worried how some of the team would react.’
‘Want to give some weaving a go?’ Tony suggests, holding up some semi-weaved sticks; as he does one of the ends unhooks and nearly smacks Sam in the face.
‘Oh good now there’s two of them,’ Okoye mutters, casting a look at her king out of the corner of her eye.
‘Let’s go,’ he whispers. Without giving the merc a chance to keep up he launches himself through the door, webbing two of the five occupants. ‘Hey guys, mind if we join the party?’
‘-it’s about knowing you can still be looking out for them if anything does happen to you,’ she puts a comforting hand on his knee. ‘I know, Tony. But you are eventually going to have to tell Peter, even if it’s just so he can prepare himself to take over SI. You know I’ll do everything to support him I can, but if it comes as a shock to both him
‘We have a final draft all ready to go, T’Challa is ready to call a meeting at the UN as soon as you give the word,’ she responds, handing him a tablet with the document on. ‘Any last alterations?’
‘Yes I know. You are also an accomplished sniper are you not?
‘Perfectly,’ he grins at her, ‘now can we get this over with?’
‘Pete!’ Ned says, trying to reach his friend to help him up.
‘And if we try and keep him away he’s just going to find a way to get there anyway, and he’ll probably get himself into a lot of trouble doing it,’ May sighs. ‘Alright, we can move it up to every two weeks,’ she gives a small laugh. ‘Do you know how disappointed he’s been that he’s not been able to come up while you’ve been helping the Winter Soldier?’
Tony sits up, feeling his heart pounding against his chest. ‘FRIDAY-’
‘Oh quit being a baby,’ Natasha laughs, ruffling Peter’s hair. ‘He’s not that bad when I train him. You just need to keep him focussed.’
‘What did you do? Come straight here?’ Steve asks.
‘Pete? Let’s sleep,’ Wade suggests, pulling him down for another kiss, ‘and your secret is safe with us, I promise.’
Loki grumbles. ‘I detest that show solely for that reason.’
‘Oh no,’ Sam laughs, standing up on his own skates and holding out a hand to Quill. ‘Come on, Star Lord, we’re going to get you skating.’
‘Thank you,’ comes the quiet reply. Loki simply nods and gives a half smile before turning and leaving.
‘Anything else you want to add, Peter?’ Tony asks him.
‘Not unless there’s one in this suit. Oh,’ Bucky blinks as his armour lights up, Steve’s copying him, ‘wow Tony really is a genius.’
‘What’s with the Spanish Inquisition?’ he asks.
‘Yeah right,’ he replies, a small smirk on his face. ‘And you’ll stop with all the mouthy comments.’
‘You didn’t think the team would be on their way?’
‘We could have certain bases specialising in research,’ Bruce sounds a little excited at this proposition. ‘And have them based in the countries where the leading experts are.’
‘Anything yet, Rhodey?’ Steve asks, hands curling and uncurling in fists at his side.
‘You got it,’ the raccoon cackles, as Scott shrinks down and Bruce bends to pick him up so he can perch on his shoulder.
‘Yeah come on Spidey, I heard most of your report. I doubt directing tourists to Central Park is fucking taxing.’ There’s a slight pause. ‘Is it to do with the hostage situation the other day?’
‘I know you are my opponent,’ he replies.
‘Let me clear it with Fury and then I’ll let you know when you can go,’ Steve tells them.
Steve holds Tony’s gaze for a few moments then nods. ‘I understand. When we come back, when we get everyone back, then we’ll tell everyone. Pepper first.’
‘Steve? Babe look at me,’ Tony puts gloved hands to Steve’s face and forces him to look at him. ‘You don’t have to do this. You can go sit with Rhodey and Vision if you want.’
‘May,’ Stewart laughs, coming in and rescuing Peter, ‘I think Peter would have said something by now if he wasn’t sure of anything. Now let’s go because the sooner we go the sooner we can get back and spend some more time with Peter.’
‘What about him?’ Bucky asks, feeling the god’s arm tighten around my shoulders.
‘Yeah one inside your own heads,’ Tony’s now standing in front of him, offering a glass of something that Loki believes is whiskey. It does always seem to be the other’s go-to drink after all. ‘Steve said he didn’t hear a word pass between the two of you, but the glares you were giving each other were making him nervous. And hey you should be proud of yourself for being able to make Steve sweat just from a look. I think only Nat’s been able to do that before now.’
Tony looks away and back at the screen in front of him. ‘Let me worry-’
‘Steve, we have a machine that can do that you know?’ he hears the spy sigh.
‘I couldn’t just leave you in here, Tony.’
‘One of them is Hulk?’ Tony offers as a finish to his AI’s sentence. ‘Shit, we need to get Hulk contained and I don’t have Veronica.’
‘Glad to be of service,’ Bucky rolls his eyes. ‘Maybe I’ll tell you the story if you tell me one about one of the hunts you
Asgard I found creatures who were not quite so concerned about taking the feelings of hurt and rejection I felt and twisting them to their own ends.’
‘Oh come on, Lokes-’
As always here's your sneak peek:
Daredevil?’ she asks, incredulous.
‘He left, Tony, without a backwards glance.’
‘Killed who?’
‘Tony be careful,’ Rhodes’ voice warns him, prompting him to take a deep breath.
‘I know we can,’ Bucky growls.
‘Clint?’ Rhodes’ voice comes through faintly.
‘Why does nobody trust me?’ Bucky asks.
‘No I tend to get rid of the nightmares before they turn up to haunt him, kind of like I’m doing with you, fuckwit.’
‘Bucky may have stolen some but I think most are left.’
‘Not helping,’ he grumbles as Rhodes chuckles from the other sofa.
‘Just get the other two stones,’ he gasps out. Clint looks up at Natasha who nods.
‘Bingo. And you remember what happened after that?’
Then he hits the water.
‘Let’s hope so,’ his guest grumbles. ‘What of Hammer? You think they got anything out of him yet?’
‘According to this report, Stark, you’re saying the initial findings of your sessions with James Barnes suggests that you should be able to cure him of the brainwashing’ one of the councilmen says.
‘Would I?’
T’Challa grips Tony’s shoulder. ‘Where will you go?’
‘Thank
‘Nearly done, Mr Stark,’ he replies. ‘I just um… hey Mr Stark? Can you give me a hand with my algebra? I’m not very good at it.’
‘Hey Parker, finally decided to join us then?’ Flash says, pushing in front of Peter in the line. ‘Should I be asking you what’s good here or do you not normally get to eat with the other workers? How was your afternoon of filing Tony Stark’s reports by the way? Or did he actually let you do something fun seeing as we were here?’
‘Peter, we all make mistakes on missions. Things go wrong,’ Steve’s voice is tight, ‘hell we wouldn’t be in the position we’re in now if we were all perfect. The important thing is we put them right when they do go wrong. Out of all of us, you’re the one who has shown that the most, and hell kid you’re still younger than most of us were when we started in our roles. Except perhaps, Nat.’
Tony gets a gauntlet on, sedative dart ready, but doesn’t raise it yet and just continues with the sequence.
‘Pete…you don’t have to be strong around us you know,’ he says, gripping the teenager’s shoulder.
’ Wade asks.
‘Spidey baby!’ the excitable shout is all the warning Peter gets before a red blur tackles him and they both go tumbling over the side of the building.
‘Would you mind accompanying me in the opening of the dance?’ Loki asks, arriving at his shoulder.
deal with them, I’ve had a lifetime of practise,’ he gives her a small smile which she hesitantly returns and then nods.
‘Everyone remembers Cap’s,’ Rhodes gives him a look. ‘Something to do with it being July the fourth.’
‘I swear to be impartial, as is required of me,’ she adds. ‘Only physical weapons may be used. The fight is to the death. May luck be with you both.’ Loki actually believes she means it. ‘When you are ready you may begin.’
‘That’s not a bad idea,’ Steve agrees. ‘Let’s ask him when he’s next here.’
Steve simply nods. Tony speaks up from next to him. ‘I hope you are right, ma’am. I’d hate for one of our team to be put in such a situation again, and I hope you can understand when I say there would be serious consequences.’
‘I hope it is,’ the soldier’s breath ghosts over his face, ‘and if it isn’t don’t wake me up.’
‘I will not offer this to you again, Wade Wilson.’
‘I could look at getting the house at Long Island sorted though,’ Tony grins, smiling spreading as the excitement on Steve’s face grows, ‘make sure the grounds are dog-escape-proof. Then maybe we could have a couple of guard dogs.’
‘Yes. No. Kind of.’
'I don't know,' he admits, eyes scanning every car he can see; he reaches into his pocket for his phone to give Sam a call. He knows what's coming before it happens, but he can't stop it without being too fast for a normal kid. As the boys come closer he nudges Ned out the way and takes the full force of the shove from both of the boys; he doesn't catch himself, falling to the floor and wincing at the pain in his knees and hands.
‘Why wouldn’t we?’ Tony frowns slightly.
expecting. Do you think you could climb through the ventilation system to get to their flag?’
‘Seriously though Pool, what’s your plans for Christmas?’ he asks as he returns to his spot next to the older man.
May’s face falls and she nods, her crossed arms now hugging herself. ‘I just don’t know how to keep him safe when he’s Spiderman.’
‘You can tell a lot of things from someone’s face,’ Mama smiles at him, ‘if you know what you’re looking for.’
Wade nods and sighs. ‘Obviously the fuckers didn’t sell it like that, I only found out after they’d made this mess of me. Turns out my healing abilities are attacking the cancer as quickly as it can form; unfortunately that means I get the side effects.’
He finishes his catches in the main room with Laura and the children as they leave for bed, even catching Cassie before he teleports away from the apple Clint launches at his head.
Loki brings his own knife up to block Bucky’s, grabbing hold of the other wrist to hold him at bay. ‘I am Loki, son of Odin,’ he responds, ‘I am King of Jotunheim, and a prince of Asgard. You know me, for you have seen into my mind.’
‘I agree,’ Steve nods, ‘but I’m glad we found these guys.’
‘I can’t cope if they’re going to be like this all the time,’ Bucky grumbles, heading towards the piles of pizza and pulling out a slice.
They’re silent for a few moments and they mull over the problem. Wanda tries but if she’s honest she’s getting a little tired, and is starting to worry they’ll never find a solution.
They turn their attention back to the three women talking on the show. ‘But you have to admit, Val, the teen does look a
‘In the flesh,’ he answers, doing a flip to try and convince himself he’s as cocky as he’s acting. ‘I’m here to do a deal with you.’
‘That’s true,’ Wanda muses. ‘We’ve already weakened the connections through targeting the actions linked to the words, and with healing recent scarring as well as old it may have weakened the connections even more.’
‘Me?’
‘And Peter? Try to remember we all love you. I’m sorry I keep treating you like a kid, I don’t mean to. In my defence though, I did meet you when you were fourteen-’
Stark laughs. ‘My assistant would you believe. She’s the only one who can actually get me to do the stuff that needs doing and not murder me in the process. She’s also a saint and one of my best friends. Speaking of which,’ he sighs again and comes over to the bed, ‘I had one of yours pay me a visit and tell me what was going on. I’m sorry.’
‘Thank you,’ Vision sighs with relief, returning the hug. ‘Thank you.’
‘Your jokes are getting worse with age,’ Sam shoots back. ‘Why would I take part in a race that includes you and Steve? I got lapped enough times by the Man with the Plan when I first met him, I don’t need to add any more to the list thank you. Besides I’ve got some prep to do for my support group tomorrow morning.’
‘But the physical course is also good for agents to learn where our weaknesses are as well,’ Steve brings the conversation back on track, ‘for example Wanda and Doctor Strange are incredibly powerful magic users, however they are not physically strong so have to use their powers to compensate that. For agents to know where physical abilities end and powers then need to take over is another key piece of information for field work.’
He shakes his head. ‘Only a day or so before you got Tony back,’ and he tells her about their first date, blushing bright red when he tells her they kissed and she squeals.
‘Proxima Midnight,’ Loki says when they finally reach the figure who had come to speak with them; she’s tall and dark skinned, with burning red eyes and Tony just gets the chills being near her, ‘the last of Thanos’ children.’
‘Just go, will ya?’
‘I mean I want to talk to you about some things that are just between us,’ he tries again, finally looking up at her.
Thor’s roar of greeting towards Strange brings their attention back to the room, and Bucky finds his gaze sweeping the room for one of the still missing members.
‘Not much, but I’ll do what I can,’ he replies, and Steve can hear the sound of the archer’s bow being drawn through the comms. A few moments later there’s the sound of an explosion and, looking out of the window, he can see the vehicle has overturned and figures are climbing out of the wreckage.
‘Well you seemed so determined to get the arc reactor back to being a permanent feature,’ Hammer says, taking the only seat in his cell and putting his feet on the bed, ‘I just
He swears there’s tears in her eyes that she blinks away before she presses a kiss to his cheek, and he’s glad the helmet isn’t up. She doesn’t say anything, just goes to stand by Clint.
‘Bucky,’ Sam’s tone is warning, ‘leave off.’
‘Sorry I know you would have preferred
alive, he’s behind this and they’re continuing Weapon X which means we could end up having to face a whole fucking army of mutants under the control of a British psychopath. This site is supposed to be their main test site. If it’s him he’ll be here.’
‘What if he’s collapsed?’
‘We did try to get hold of the Guardians of the Galaxy,’ Natasha added, ‘but for one thing they aren’t the most diplomatic group out there,’ Peter stifles a laugh, ‘and we couldn’t get through to them on the comms. Which means they’re either out of range or they’re on a job.’
‘You are no soldier,’ he counters, dodging under a punch. ‘A soldier goes where he is told and does what he is told and does not question,’ he echoes the words from one of their first friendly interactions, ‘he is a cog in a larger machine and is useful only in the number of him there are. You are no solider,’ he kicks Bucky’s knee, sending him to a kneeling position, ‘you are a warrior.’
He’s starting to wish he hadn’t spent so much time awake before getting captured. Maybe Steve had been right.
‘Tones…you sure about this?’ Rhodes voice is quiet.
‘That’s the first time you got that right,’ she says as he releases her and takes off his mask. She’s smiling. ‘I told you that you were overthinking it.’
‘Buck are you-’
‘Man this is boring,’ Scott sighs as he sits down next to Bruce’s elbow. ‘See anyone yet?’
‘What do you mean he ghosted you?’ Steve asks.
‘We’ve got a situation,’ Fury explains, ‘and with my entire team about to be busy in two separate places I need someone to take care of it.’
Bruce is laughing in relief. ‘Oh you guys are in trouble now!’
Peter nods, then decides that she’s probably worked most of it out anyway so comes clean. ‘He joins me on a couple of patrols each week, but he only helps if I have to take on any criminals. He’s my friend.’
Please keep safe all of you.
‘I think if we draft a good enough letter we’ll keep them on our side, but we’ll have to be careful not to shout too loud or they’ll start pulling on the leash.’
‘It’s all about managing people,’ Pepper shrugs her shoulders, ‘we’ve never had a problem and we meet up for coffee every month without fail.’
‘Bucky?’
‘Oh no you don’t!’ Loki goes to stand in front of his brother. ‘That will just make things worse! You can come with me and make sure that, should he manage to reach the facility, he does not accidentally hurt anyone left there.’
‘You got a point to any of this Hammer?’
‘Weird Sister? Really? Does she know you call her that?’
‘Now that is a threat that actually scares me,’ Steve laughs, following the other two.
‘What?’ Steve asks from next to him, getting FRIDAY to bring up the lights.
Tony smiles as he watches Peter finish zipping up his suitcase and sit on the bed next to him. ‘I’m positive. You deserve this break after everything that’s happened the last few months, not to mention after saving my life,’ he ruffles the brown hair. ‘Besides it’ll be better for you to be out of the media circus of the trial, we don’t want you getting any more attention now they’ve finally lost interest.’
‘You stole my line!’ the captain whines at Tony, then takes off down the field. Again scarlet light curls around the ball and Sam finds it back at his feet ready to fire it in past Tony.
‘Anyone heard from Strange?’ Tony asks.
Tony pulls him in for a hug, which he easily returns, hiding the tears that are leaking from his eyes in the material of the man’s shirt. ‘Not sure just yet if I’m honest.’
‘I win!’ he crows, all but falling into the room. ‘Hey Mama!’
‘Alright sure thing Mr…. Tony.’ Peter speeds off before he can say anything else.
’ he rolls his eyes, not moving away from Wade’s embrace. ‘We’re having a discussion here.’
don’t tempt me.’
There’s silence on the other end of the phone. ‘
‘Peter,’ he offers his hand with a small smile. ‘I’m one of the Stark Interns. I was wondering if Mr Murdock is available? I really need to speak him.’
‘Nat. I know you said to Bucky about trying with her again after you helped him realise his dreams weren’t actually dreams but memories.’
loves you. And as far as he’s concerned, the world can crash and burn as long as you are safe and you are happy. I also think that if he didn’t really love and respect you he wouldn’t be waiting for you to turn eighteen to sleep with you. I don’t think he’s doing it just because of the team either, I think he’d do it regardless of if we were around or not.’
The mercenary frowns and glares at the vigilante. ‘Because he’s my friend you cock-sucking mother fucker. And strangely enough I do actually care about my friends.’
‘Brother?’ Thor’s weak voice comes from over Loki’s shoulder and the trickster spins to look at him.
Peter’s still trying to control his shaking.
‘No it’s fine,’ Wade surprises Peter by cutting her off. ‘It’s not like they’re easy to ignore. Short answer: cancer.’
He’d started with the wormhole as that was where most of his nightmares started. He’d even shown them what he’d seen with the same machine they’d used with Bucky. But nothing could convey the cold he’d felt going through that wormhole, the sense of loss at not being able to contact Pepper and then losing JARVIS. How the last thing he’d thought he’d ever see would be the sight of that massive army, illuminated by the exploding nuke, and not knowing if it would be enough to wipe them all out.
Tony nods. ‘I need to speak with him,’ he muses, ‘make sure he knows he has my blessing.’
‘You mean Murdock of Nelson and Murdock?’ Tony asks.
when he comes into view. ‘What the
‘Sounds like the kind of crap Rumlow would come out with,’ Steve snarls.
‘Tony?’ Bucky copies him. ‘Tony!’
He takes a few steps back, blinking his eyes against the material of his mask and trying not to focus on the fact he can’t see. His hip catches one of the benches and he stumbles to the side. ‘I’m not sure about this,’ he says as he catches his balance.
‘Why don’t you tell me what’s on your mind and then we can both get some sleep?’ Wade suggests, one hand going to Peter’s hair and massaging his scalp, helping to move his muscles from forcibly to actually relaxed.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘We managed to take out the base and-’
Peter turns the beautiful ornament in his hands, all silver and gold across the clothing, and a serene smile on her porcelain face. The girls must have spent the most on this decoration. He looks up as the two girls come back over from the kitchenette where they’d just gotten a mug of hot chocolate each.
They continue sparring, evenly matched thanks to Wade’s mutation and years of experience fighting as a merc, combined with training with the team, against Peter’s extraordinary reflexes and spidey-sense, now improved with his own hours of training.
‘You going to take that ridiculous mask off or am I going to have to do it for you?’ the man demands.
‘You’ve been busy,’ the red head comments, ‘May showed me your room.’
The pattern repeats as the chatter continues in the background. Her eyes widen a little, then go back to look at Tony’s face. She sits back down in the chair she’d vacated, carefully picks up her pencil and, cautiously, copies the pattern onto the paper without looking down. She sees a tiny smile in Tony’s eyes.
Wade bursts out laughing and shakes his head. ‘I think I’m rubbing off on you.’
‘Mistletoe!!!’ Wade shouts excitedly, before running off, grabbing Peter’s hand and dragging him towards the forest. ‘We’ll go get everyone Cap-e-tan!’
‘Oh come off it, Wade,’ Francis laughs as he takes a step back. ‘Don’t tell me that’s
‘I didn’t do right by you then,’ Steve sighs, ‘I’m fixing that this time around. No more hiding what we feel, we do it all out in the open for everyone to see.’
‘On it!’ Peter shouts.
impressed, never mind you,’ Clint says. ‘There’s not many people who can take us out.’
‘Oh god,’ his eyes go wide, ‘it’s not Bucky is it? Please tell me it’s not Bucky.’
exactly that happened, has to have been not long after he’d returned with Thor.
‘Something along those lines,’ Steve smirks. ‘It’s weird isn’t it?’ How different the Commandos are to the Avengers? The Commandos were some of our best friends, but-’
‘It is remarkable how people change is it not?’ they slip into a silence that is surprising in how comfortable it is. ‘The care you two have for each other has not changed though,’ he adds.
The coffee pot is just finishing as he reaches it. He smiles to himself and reaches into one of the cupboards to find a mug. ‘Thanks, FRIDAY. I appreciate you having it ready for me,’ he tells the AI as he starts to pour the hot liquid.
‘He obviously said something to you as well that made you angry, Buck, so I doubt you’re the only guilty party here.’
‘We’re going home,’ he replies. ‘In more ways than one,’ he mutters to himself, raising a hand in farewell to T’Challa as they lift off from the rooftop of the Wakandan Embassy. ‘Sam? Can you check on Steve for me?’
That little voice pipes up again as he heads out of his door, following the smell of dinner and deciding the voice doesn’t need an answer.
‘But it will be the place where someone linked to HYDRA is holed up,’ Clint replies, ‘so it’s a good place to start.’
‘You want him to?’ Peter looks at the trickster who is looking slightly irritated.
‘Not as Spider-Man,’ Tony says, ‘but you can definitely come as our intern.’
‘Yeah yeah, that and you needed my wings,’ he replies.
‘You keep that up your face is going to get stuck like that,’ he jokes as he passes the Winter Soldier.
you tell us?’ Fury demands.
‘Dum Dum called Monty’s scotch pigs piss, and Monty told him it was better than whatever animal had pissed out the bourbon he’d been given.’
A/N: Hi everyone. Hope you enjoyed this chapter! So only one person actually suggested Wade as a possibility - how could you doubt him?
Fury falls asleep and Strange decides to bow out, already at the stage where he has to stay at the facility rather than risk a portal back to the Sanctum. The Cloak carries him to his room as Wade fireman lifts Fury to his. By the time he gets back T’Challa has also decided to bow out and preserve his dignity, though his sister is showing no signs of doing the same..
‘Please tell me you aren’t knitting them yourself,’ Sam stares at the merc.
‘I’m sure old Tin Can will come up with some kind of machine to help us along if we get pushed for time,’ Wade says, bringing his axe down to rest on the ground. ‘I’m more worried about how we’re going to get the fu-‘ at Steve’s frown the mercenary changes mid-word, ‘-thing down in the first place without destroying anything.’ Then he glares at Bucky who is laughing at him. ‘Oh shut it, Elsa, at least I’m trying.’
‘I still have no idea what Tony was thinking when he agreed to sending
‘I’ve tried to convince him before but he won’t-’
‘Then you obviously aren’t being
A/N: Hi everyone. I hope you enjoyed these two chapters and they've brought some entertainment for you during the world-wide lockdown.
‘I figured that Bucky had developed feelings for you before we got back,’ she says, ‘back when you were still trying to break his brain washing,’ at his raised eyebrow she shrugs, ‘I could see it on his face when he spoke about you. When we got back I realised you weren’t entirely adverse to the idea, but-’
‘Considering out of the two of us I’m the one who doesn’t have a long history of going off by myself and doing whatever the hell I want regardless of what others say I think I’m probably in the best position of the two of us. Or do we need another Ultron incident?’
‘I wouldn’t count on it,’ a voice behind them says. The two of them spin around, Peter with his web shooters ready to fire and Deadpool with his katana in hand.
‘Already at a hospital and Fury’s dealing with keeping it quiet. As soon as we can assess who was experimented on we’ll move them to a more secure place and the others can go home,’ she responds.
‘Peter agreed with me!’ Tony counters. ‘Besides it’s not Christmas until you’ve seen Hans Gruber fall from a building.’
‘Divide their attention, this is a good plan,’ Drax agrees.
he muses,
‘Although I’m sure my genius could come up with something, let’s not test it,’ he suggests.
Steve rounds the corner only a few steps ahead of Bucky, the sound of a fight reaching them down the tunnel before they can see it. He almost runs into the blond’s back, barely catching himself before sending them both sprawling, instead he stumbles around Steve’s side and takes in the scene in front of him.
‘What?!?’
‘Why is every time you ask for help, Red, my Baby Boy ends up in trouble?’ Wade demands, looking up at the vigilante.
Tony makes some phone calls to get some help, Peter gets some dating advice, and Steve and Tony have a long over-due conversation
‘I just want to help, if you would just let me-’
‘And you?’ Wade asks.
‘Is there enough space for all of us?’ Peter asks, coming and leaning tiredly against Tony’s side. He’s not sure if it’s a gesture of support, Peter seeking comfort, or a mixture of both. Whatever the reason he struggles to speak past the lump of tears.
With a sigh, and knowing he won’t get any peace until he does, Peter tells the girl everything; starting with when he first met Deadpool on patrol, all the way up to meeting him for tacos to get information on HYDRA.
Tony taps his cards on the table as he thinks. ‘I was pretty young at the time, we didn’t see them so much as I got older, but they were the ones to teach me to play. Used to entertain me with stories of you two as well,’ he adds with a grin.
Captain America may have swapped the Howling Commandos for the Avengers, but Steve Rogers still missed his old teammates. The only person who knew them like he had was Bucky; he’d been wanting to ask Tony about what he remembered about the Commandos from his childhood but hadn’t had the courage yet. He still wasn’t sure why. Now he thinks he and Tony and Bucky should sit down and have that discussion together.
Natasha nods. ‘Fury’s just arrived, Sam, Bruce and Rhodey are staying here and I contacted Clint so he’s on standby should they need back up.’
‘Stick up for me.’
‘God,
‘I’m never late, that’s Tony,’ he protests.
life is too short for that kind of crap.’
‘Right, yeah,’ Bruce still looks thrown but shakes himself back into focus. ‘So Thanos turns up and demands the Tesseract; we didn’t realise Loki had taken it from the vaults.’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘One chance, Nat,’ he cuts her off. ‘One chance.’
Tony pauses, then start to unbutton his shirt and turns around.
to talk to him. Which he knows is ridiculous, but there’s a small voice in the back of his mind telling him that Tony should be including him in more of the conversations.
‘I’ve got an idea,’ Peter says slowly.
‘I thought you said we were sharing them all?’ Wade points out with a grin.
Tony tries not to laugh, but it’s really hard. ‘Why don’t you tell her yourself when you’re back?’
‘Take him away before he tries to propose again,’ Valkyrie all but begs her.
‘Yes you may finish drinking first, woman with strange markings on her face, before we go to the ship,’ Drax says.
‘I was hoping you could help me decide on what gift to get Wanda this year,’ the humanoid admits, ‘I’m afraid I’m having some difficulty in deciding what to do.’
‘Excuse me, miss?’ Steve asks the nurse at the station. ‘Could you tell me where Sergeant James Barnes is please?’
There’s so much talking Steve isn’t sure who is saying what. He helps Tony to his feet, both of them are shaking, both of them have tears of exhaustion drying on their faces. ‘Steve we have to-’
‘Tony all you had to do was write people’s
‘Stop, kid,’ Bucky sighs, and he’s surprised at the man’s tone. It almost sounds like he’s holding back tears. ‘Please don’t start apologising.’
‘Bucky,’ Loki is suddenly standing next to him, a hand on his flesh arm, ‘why are you shutting me out?’
Bucky grins as they climb in the car. ‘Perfect. Tony and I are trying to convince Steve to let us play tonight. We can teach you and then Mr Grumpy over there has no reason to complain.’
‘Nothing to forgive, Baby Boy, as long as you stay with me.’
‘Don’t raise your voice at me! I’ve just-’
Peter all but jumps through the door. Natasha’s at the controls and Sam is checking his jet pack at one of the seats. ‘Wow, hi guys. What’s the mission?’
she thinks back to the first film night they’d had with the teenager,
His guest just smirks and raises an eyebrow. ‘Let’s not start that game when you’re the one who lost our latest project. What about getting hold of Spider-Man since Wilson seems so friendly with him?’
Tony gives a sour laugh. ‘Oh yes they can, Cap. They have numerous times in the past. At least they remembered to feed me.’
‘Nope,’ Sam laughs.
‘No, and even if I did I wouldn’t tell you because I imagine you’d send him off on some stupid task just to annoy him,’ Steve replies.
, Deadpool had become a friend to him. Right now he just wants a friend.
‘The hell I can’t,’ the other voice responds, and Bucky gets his answer when the door to his room is opened and there’s Doctor Blake standing the doorway with none other than-
Tony bursts out laughing at the look on Natasha’s face. ‘Well it isn’t Miss Romanoff, Nat,’ he supplies.
‘Can we focus more on what we’re going to do to get Peter out of the spotlight please?’ he huffs.
‘We have blood to spare,’ she replies, gesturing behind her at the army massing at the tree line, then turns and walks back towards them.
Please do let me know what you think of these chapters. I'm hoping to finish writing this story next week so I should be able to start getting a lot more chapters up. The idea is to have it all up and posted by the new year.
‘I can’t Tony, I-’
'Peter!' he doesn't think, he just moves in front of the teenager, the knife piercing through his armour and he feels it sink deep into his stomach.
want to listen to that fucker droning on right now. Not when I can’t shoot him in the eye.
‘It’s better if you see for yourself,’ Vision replies, and pushes open the door, gesturing for Steve to go first.
Tony pulls his hand away. ‘Tails! Strange chooses first.’
Tony nods. ‘He got on the ship with me, he followed me even though I
‘Nat?’
‘T’Challa…’ Tony lands next to Thor, pulling his helmet back. ‘T’Challa, I…’ he breaks off with a shake of the head.
‘Peter,’ Sam’s soft voice, ‘you
‘Why me?’ Bucky asks. ‘Why not you?’
‘And I’ve been getting your punk ass out of trouble just as long,’ Steve rolls his eyes, trying not to grin at the laughter he can see in Tony’s eyes.
‘Oh please,’ the soldier rolls his eyes, ‘if I wasn’t a good shot Steve would have been killed within his first three missions with the Commandos.’
‘Wade?’
‘Settle down, kid,’ the man who has him says as he starts to struggle. The man manages to get his mask off and shoves the end of the gun into his face.
‘But-’
‘No I volunteered,’ she winks at them and then heads back over to where Thor is sorting through the presents.
‘I think you may have started something truly terrifying,’ Loki laughs.
‘So…why is this the one attached to me then?’
‘Your friend’s right you need to go,’ he says, obviously still trying to catch up with what’s happening. ‘Then we need a discussion on just how appropriate your nickname is Spidey.’
‘Thanks, FRI.’
Love always,
Strange allows him to sit in silence while he works up the courage to say what he needs to.
‘WADE!’
‘Oh man,’ Peter groans as a body slams into the figure and sends them both flying into a wall, ‘I am in
‘Don’t make her more dangerous than she already is,’ he groans. MJ just sticks her tongue out in reply. ‘Real mature MJ,’ he laughs. ‘Have you been introduced yet?’ He gestures to Matt.
‘Steve told me to give you at least an hour to get your head straight, I snuck out while he was making coffee so I’m going to be in trouble when we get back,’ is Tony’s greeting as he closes the door behind him and sits on the bed.
‘Seems to be the tradition now,’ she responds, ‘and Clint always joins us the day after so it means I still get to see the family.’
‘Different how?’ Rhodes asks.
The document that cost him any future chance with Pepper. But that might just bring back the rest of the team.
‘As ready as I will ever be,’ comes the reply.
Tony gives a small laugh. ‘You know, I used to sneak down after Mom went to bed to play with Dad and the rest of the Commandos. Guess this means I’ve now played with the whole set.’
‘That your partner or your Mom?’ Bucky asks.
‘I got him,’ Tony says, and lands next to Peter.
Tony chuckles and gestures for him to enter the Quinjet that’s resting on the rooftop just behind him. ‘Let’s go Spider-Man.’
Tony winces. ‘I was trying not to be so blunt.’
‘We should- we should get back before they send out a search party,’ Tony says, clearing his throat as he takes a few steps back.
Peter realises he’s shaking and his breath catches in his throat as he tries to swallow back the tears. Then there’s a pair of warm arms holding him and he’s holding on to the front of Tony’s shirt, desperately holding back tears as he tells him everything. The name calling, the constant harassment from Flash, the older boys he’s now got involved, all the way up to the incident that Bucky and Sam had seen earlier and his feelings about not being able to help his best friend.
‘Let’s keep it a secret from the others though,’ Steve suggests, ‘we can surprise them with it.’
‘Where’s the best place for me to enter?’ Nebula asks the teenager.
made.’
‘No boss, there’s one more body underneath the rubble but I’m not sure you’ll be able to get a positive ID by sight.’
‘Let us know if you need help, Doc, this team always has each other’s backs,’ he claps the man on the shoulder as he turns to say goodbye.
‘Are you sure I can’t call Mr Stark?’ she asks him for about the hundredth time.
‘Brave woman,’ Loki laughs. ‘What did you receive Tony?’
‘You know, I think I might head to the bar,’ Bucky says, face tense again and a little green at the two youngest members’ antics.
Loki smirks.
‘Usually the more traumatic the better,’ Vision supplies.
A few of the Council members look surprised and Ross gives a derisive snort. ‘Oh this should be good,’ the Secretary General says.
‘You get hit twice and you’re out,’ Tony shouts out across the snow covered grounds. ‘And FRIDAY will be checking and tell you when you’re out.’
‘Go on, enough mushy stuff, you need to go see your boyfriend.’
‘Alright, but don’t moan when you have to watch three rom coms in a row,’ she giggles.
he eventually asks her.
-Then why can I feel your anxiety?- he challenges.
‘Wow she’s intense,’ Harry comments.
‘Oh Weasel? But I mean…’
‘Why? What’s going on?’ Peter asks, looking between the three of them.
The merc turns to look at him just as there’s groaning from above their heads. ‘Bucky! Get out!’
There’s a ringing silence. ‘My king,’ the female Jotun steps forward and sinks to one knee in front of Loki, ‘you have won the duel, and you may now claim the throne as yours. What are your orders?’ The other two Jotuns follow her example and sink to their knees.
‘We’ll explain on the way,’ Tony says. ‘Alright, Nat, you know where we’re going.’
he growls into her ear.
Thor talks about some of the different worlds that he has encountered, and Peter can see everyone hanging on his every word; the Asgardian has a way of describing things that can make even the most mundane things sound incredible. His booming voice, however, is starting to affect Peter’s headache.
‘Hey Loki? Am I doing this right?’ Peter asks from the stove where he’s been put in charge of watching the syrup, it needs constant stirring and Loki has done more than his fair share of watching the syrup in the past.
A huge roar, and Hulk bursts out of the last of the debris, landing in front of them with a satisfied huff once he sees both of them are safe. The War Machine armour glides over and seamlessly melds itself to Rhodes’ form.
. I…’
Tony feels like his world is coming crashing down around him. ‘No…no I got it out. It wasn’t supposed to go back in. Steve, please- Steve tell me it can come out. There must be someone we can contact, there must be someone who can get it out. Tell me- please- Steve tell me we can get it out. Steve,
‘We’re fine. Let’s get to the jet,’ Steve says, turning to look in the direction of the car just in time to see a fist coming for his face and ducking out of the way. He backs off and straightens up, shield in place to defend himself and comes to face to face with his attacker.
‘Any plan on
Peter deals with waiting for Wade to recover and the team take the opportunity to properly meet their new allies
‘I didn’t realise you still had this place,’ his friend replies.
Wanda shares some of her fears with Vision. Loki and Tony get separated from Steve and Bucky.
‘Maybe you do not feel that I do, but I feel I should all the same. I
‘Good?’ Steve looks like he’s not entirely sure what’s going on. ‘But-’
‘He does realise I have no reservations over stabbing or shooting him in his last eye right?’ Wade asks.
‘Hey when I make a promise I tend to keep it,’ Tony shrugs.
‘Screw you Barnes.’
Flash just scowls at her before running off before he gets left behind. Harry glaring at his back. ‘Hey Pete, would you be pissed off if I decked that guy?’
scared of an unhappy Natasha,’ Tony mock-whispers.
‘I looked into the future at all possible outcomes of the coming conflict,’ he tells them, sounding a little breathless.
Peter looks at the man, wearing a pair of black trousers and a dark blue shirt that only just fit around his toned body, and a look of complete uncertainty on his face. He takes hold of the man’s hand and gives it a squeeze. ‘Come on, Pool, you know you can ask me anything,’ he says softly.
‘I would join them, but I’ve seen how happy he is with you around. So all I’m going to say is: don’t screw this up, keep him happy and keep him safe and I
‘You sure we’re going to have enough?’ Valkyrie asks him from where she’s peeling some more apples ready for Wanda and Natasha to slice.
‘It’s my personal security team I need to replace,’ Tony answers, Miss Potts is standing to the side having placed the paperwork on the table, and is watching everything like a hawk. Steve is struck by how protective she seems of Tony.
‘You made this for me?’ she asks. ‘Why?’
‘And why is that?’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Nat broke my nose!’ Bucky sulks.
‘I don’t have time for your smart mouth, Stark,’ Ross glares at him. ‘It was either the army or you to be called in and I thought this might be a good little test to see how your newest member is fitting back into the team.’ He turns to look at her and Wanda manages to hold his gaze. ‘The police have already tried sending in three negotiators. All of them have been sent out dead, and the perpetrators are using advanced weaponry, possibly made from alien remnants from the Battle of New York.’
‘We shall see what they have to say,’ T’Challa says. ‘Who will come with me?’
As the door closes behind her Tony mutters, ‘FRIDAY give me ears.’
‘Fuck,’ Wade says again, pushing Peter away from him and taking a few steps back. ‘No, no, no I can’t be doing this. You’re

‘I think before we take any more questions,’ the Headmaster says, ‘can I request that we keep them as
‘Until your minds have stabilised,’ Strange adds, ‘we won’t be able to break the connection without risking permanent mental damage.’
‘Wade put the wreath on the damn door,’ Peter sighs. ‘Bucky stop trying to strangle Wade with the lights! You know that won’t work.’
‘Miss-’
‘We can’t just push it, we better get some rope,’ Steve sighs. ‘I’ll run back and get some-’
Peter asks.
‘Well we’ve worked through enough complexes already, I’m sure we’ll work through his,’ Natasha gives a weak smile.
Tony feels his breath catch. The man has gone straight to the thing that’s causing him the most turmoil; even though the reactor has been changed to one of his own inventions, free of palladium and powered by Yinsinium, he still feels he’s being pumped full of poison. To have Steve touching it like it was something precious, especially since he’d had a nightmare last night of the shield sticking out of it, is confusing. ‘Proof that Tony Stark used to have a heart?’
‘Tell me about growing up,’ he says, closing his eyes. ‘Loki helps me when I’m in there by letting me go through the link and be with him. But it doesn’t stop them hurting my body and I need to find a way to relax so it can heal up as much as possible before they come back for me. So, tell me about you growing up. Tell me about your brother.’
‘Let’s go,’ Steve says, ‘where are you Vision?’
hero, baby boy.’
The Battle of Wakanda begins, with the opening giving the Avengers the upper hand. Until they realise some of the team are in danger.
‘Well everyone can agree you’ve definitely improved me,’ Tony says quietly, pressing a kiss to the spot between his shoulder blades and continuing his ministrations. Steve’s happy to just relax into his partner’s touch and their quiet conversation for the rest of the evening.
‘Thank god, I’m beat,’ Bucky yawns. Then says something suitably threatening to a prisoner that Tony ignores.
Peter would be lying if he said he wasn’t completely drained by the time they sat down to dinner that evening. He’s pretty sure the rest of the team haven’t been told about his little breakdown that afternoon as no one mentions anything, and no one seems to treat him differently. Well except Wanda being a bit more ‘big sister’ with him; he’s not even sure he minds it that much.
Sam’s just taken over from Steve sitting at the genius’ bedside, the man is currently sleeping soundly, and the sound of the argument in the common room reaches his ears before he can see the participants.
T’Challa has a country to run.’
‘What’s makes you say something’s happened?’ Tony counters.
(See the end of the chapter for
‘How do we know it’s a girl?’ Vision asks, tone genuinely curious. ‘Why could it not be a boy?’
‘Just… you’ll see,’ Steve says, not very good at lying. ‘Now go on, hurry up or dinner’ll be cold by the time you’re done.’
‘They always used to tell ghost stories at Christmas,’ the man points out, giggling as Peter takes a swipe at him.
‘So, you’re saying my friends wouldn’t have been in danger if I’d just joined up right from the start?’ Peter asks, forcing his voice past the lump in his throat.
‘Oh god who thought it was a good idea to get Nick drunk?’ Tony groans, he looks to Wanda when she returns to her seat. ‘How close is Fury to being out?’
‘Clint just let us explain,’ the blond tries again. Before he can add anything else there’s a
Loki joins Natasha next to the doctor and looks him up and down. ‘You need to be careful using so much magic, you know it takes its toll on you.’
‘Go get some sleep, Nat,’ Steve repeats his advice. ‘Please.’
‘Which means Tony is going to pull an all-nighter and be sitting in the quinjet waiting for everyone tomorrow morning,’ Rhodes rolls his eyes.
‘I should like to repeat this too,’ Loki smiles.
He sees both Tony’s and Steve’s faces drain of colour, and knows exactly how they feel.
Tony isn’t sure what he feels at those words and he and Peter scramble for the door. ‘Get her inside FRI!’ he shouts as he runs. ‘Get Steve and Sam. Go through every single camera she’s passed in the last forty-eight hours and make sure she hasn’t been followed.’
‘Considering I am a form of technological life myself, I am not sure what you could make that would surprise me,’ Vision says, and Tony swears that humanoid is learning sarcasm better than JARVIS ever did.
‘Welcome to Nelson and Murdock,’ she says, catching sight of him and coming over, ‘just take a seat and we’ll be with you as soon as- oh wait I know you! You were at the gala.’
‘I know I’m crazy, Cap, but I’m not crazy enough to turn this down.’
His bullet narrowly misses my face and by the time I turn back to him he’s disappeared again.
Now he’s alone, and this is going to be the hardest part: being patient and waiting for the party to be in full swing before heading over there. He does everything he can think of to kill time, but it just seems to go by at half speed. Eventually he gives up, deciding he can walk part of the way and give himself time to work out what he’s going to say when he gets there.
‘Do you all carry guns with you all the time or am I just lucky?’ Tony asks. He raises an eyebrow at Luke and Blake. ‘Well who are you two going to point yours at?’
‘Ah don’t mention it. I realised after the last one that it was getting hard for you travelling back after a long mission so thought it might help a bit.’
he thinks, stretching a leg with a grimace to try and get some life back into it.
quiet, but I was in a Council meeting. What’s happened?’
A beanie is pulled down over their hair and a pair of sunglasses covering their eyes, but Tony knows they’ve seen him. A small head gesture towards the park behind them and they start walking. Without a second thought Tony follows.
‘Err… why?’ Bucky asks.
Someone lands between us, crouching down as they land, one arm extended behind them. Superhero landing!
Beside her Deadpool laughs. ‘Actually I’m much more used to that reaction. Thanks Snowflake that actually makes me feel better.’
‘I’d be willing to bet,’ Sam says with a grin at Tony, ‘that he manages to get everyone before the challenge is over.’
Tony doesn’t comment on the nickname, just walks by them and heads upstairs.
It doesn’t take them long. There’s something about the pattern of the attacks that’s familiar. Steadying. And Peter feels himself calming down and getting into a pattern of defence and counter attack and, slowly, his senses return.
Wanda lifts her hand, wiggling her fingers with a smile as red light dances around her finger tips. ‘Leave that to me.’
‘Rhodey you’re making this weird,’ Tony groans.
T’Challa considers him in silence. ‘Steve showed me the new Accords,’ he says eventually, voice even.
‘Oh Pete told me about his crush ages ago,’ Wanda waves the question off.
. But he couldn’t stop. He’d promised Vision he’d get Wanda home. Get them all home.
‘Just crawl!’ Clint fires back, nearly braining himself as he pushes himself back to give Rhodes space to crawl with one arm, the other still linked with his own so he can haul the man along. Hulk’s roar of warning not needed as everything above them starts to shift.
‘Any news?’ Tony looks up and asks Natasha.
if everyone agrees. One person isn’t happy? We don’t do it.’
‘Wait you can do that?’ Peter asks, eyes wide. ‘Can you teach me how to do it?’
‘I can’t believe I’m doing this,’ Loki sulks into his food.
‘Yeah, Sam text earlier to say he’s going to be waiting down the road with Sergeant Barnes so he doesn’t cause another scene.’
Sharon's smile of greeting turned into a frown. 'Unfortunately not a general social call. I'm here to see him,' she gestures at Tony.
‘Sorry,’ he says, latching himself onto the side of the building. It’s then he notices a familiar form flying towards them and grins. ‘Hey Sam! Can you take her somewhere safe for me?’
‘Oh, I love Led Zepplin!’ he hears himself say. Then Tony presses pause, looking at him with an expectant eyebrow.
to say that where he could hear?’
The leader shrugs. ‘Well if he doesn’t mean anything to you, then he’s not any use to me,’ he holds the gun a little straighter and turns to Peter. ‘Any last words, kid?’
‘If you think I’m wearing any of those ridiculous outfits you have another thing coming,’ Valkyrie’s voice drifts down from the other end of the table.
‘Your help is greatly appreciated all the same,’ T’Challa tells him, ‘I appreciate it cannot be easy in such a situation where you are not able to do as much as you would like.’ Strange just inclines his head in acknowledgment. ‘And of course,’ the king says, turning to one of the newer faces, ‘we would have been lost but for your tribe’s support, Princess Ororo.’
, I knew this was going to happen-’
‘Not Wisecracker Wilson?’ Rhodes asks from behind Tony.
Thor talks about some of the different worlds that he has encountered, and Peter can see everyone hanging on his every word; the Asgardian has a way of describing things that can make even the most mundane things sound incredible. His booming voice, however, is starting to affect Peter’s headache.
‘We- I- Ned,
‘Stop it!’ Bucky yells, lashing out with a leg and sending Loki staggering backwards.
‘Wait, what? Are you saying-’
She shakes her head. ‘I didn’t want him to push me and end up getting hurt because of it.’
Vision nods. ‘Losing the team hit him harder than I think even he realises. Now that we’re all back together, he’s going to do everything he can to make sure everyone’s happy here.’
He barely has the energy to struggle against the immovable grip at his neck. He sees Wanda, watching the fight impassively.
‘You want us to do
‘Still sore that I made you miss?’ Wade jokes. ‘Come on Hawkeye, we all have performance issues sometimes.’ Tony tries to hold back his groan. Of course Wade had to choose that moment to open his mouth.
‘Steve with Thor’s hammer.’
And suddenly Bucky is in a room, decorated in the Wakandan style, with the faces of their team surrounding him.
‘Children!’ Loki shouts and they both turn to look at him. ‘Can we save this for another time please? Preferably one I am
Tony laughs, suddenly extremely grateful to his friend for insisting they actually have this meeting face-to-face and at the facility. As Pepper had said it was far too long since they’d had a proper chat. Sharing some of the antics that had been going on at the facility was helping ease some of the tension in his shoulders.
‘Vis… never mind,’ Wanda sighs.
‘If he gets to know the team he can work with us much easier when he has to. Then he can go back to being the neighbourhood superhero.’

‘Thank you, ma’am,’ he says, talking past the lump in his throat. He watches the family pull out, waving goodbye as they leave the parking lot.
‘I shut it down when I escaped,’ Wade answers, looking down at the table. ‘They were trying to make “super slaves” to sell to the highest bidders.’
she thinks as Peter leaves his friends and comes to join her. There’s a big smile on his face as he pulls her into a tight hug and she feels the tightness in her heart ease a little. Ever since they lost Vision she’s been finding reasons to spend extra time with Peter, his openness and natural enthusiasm and optimism always help to ease her grief for a short time. She’s lucky Wade is so understanding of her stealing his boyfriend so much.
‘Wong I want you to hold him in place with your magic,’ Steve says. ‘Tony, Wanda, Vision I want you to put all your power into him. We need him gone. We can’t risk keeping him for questions.’
Both children had made amazing progress since they’d first arrived, and they had weekly meeting with Doctor Banner, a child psychologist whose mild manner and easy smile both children had quickly fallen in love with. There were very few nights, however, when they’d both sleep through without one or both of them waking up from nightmares; and there were some nights, like tonight, where they were going to struggle to get to sleep as memories came back to haunt them.
‘So did some of his best,’ he points out.
‘Oh look roasted chestnuts!’ Wanda interrupts, with an eyeroll at Tony who just grins back.
‘Oh that’s alright. I’ll get working on the rest of the webs. Man there really is more fluid in those shooters than I thought.’
‘Stop being a sore loser Clint,’ Natasha shakes her head, laughing at the archer roughly wiping at his mouth.
‘When we’ve been testing the security on it,’ Peter counters desperately.
‘Wow,’ Harry says as the door to his room opens, ‘this is way cooler than at home.’
‘Uh, yeah? Tony, man, these things are awesome!’
Then Quill goes to stand next to her, looking at the carol sheet and joining in. ‘Come and behold him, born the king of angels.’
‘Steve, honey, you are drunker than I actually thought was possible for you to get. As the one in this relationship who is an
‘You’re going to be horrendous to live with for the first month when they start dating aren’t you?’ Steve sighs.
,’ Ned huffs, closing his books and shoving them into his bag.
‘Errr….’ He looks at the two gunmen who now both have their weapons facing him. ‘Let’s hope Mr Stark definitely put that in, because I don’t think I’m going to get much of a choice here.’
‘Yeah, but that was before he knew who I was,’ Tony sighs, playing with one of the pens on his desk, ‘now I have no idea how he’ll be around me.’
‘We’re seriously the only ones awake?’ he moves to get his own mug. ‘And why do you assume I’ve done something?’
‘Way to be supportive,’ Wanda glares at him.
‘Sorry, miss,’ Peter casts a quick glance at the board, making sure they hadn’t covered anything new. ‘We were just having a short debate as to whether seeing his father’s ghost is the first sign of Hamlet going mad or not. I said yes but Ned argued no seeing as everyone else can see him too.’
Tony pauses, considering his options; there’s at least five more that he
have a tantrum,’ Loki snaps from his spot on one of the sofas, his brother is sitting next to him obviously trying to calm the dark haired man down.
‘Why are all your friends smarter than you?’ Bucky asks.
‘I didn’t,’ Sam says.
‘Hey Cap? Why’d you give me a load of reading for Christmas?’
Bucky grabs Steve by the shoulder and pushes him back towards their original car, making his meaning crystal clear, then does the same for Thor before scooping up Wanda’s motionless body and following behind them.
changed them?’
‘Bucky Barnes?’ one of the young girls asks. ‘You’re one of the Avengers!’
‘You will not stop me from claiming the prize my master seeks,’ the alien hisses at him. It raises its spear and Tony reaches up to stop it mid-strike, the suit struggling against the alien’s strength.
‘I’m landing,’ Natasha growls, and the landing is definitely more bumpy than usual. There’s a race to get to the doors, and everyone stumbles out, only Sam staying behind with Peter’s friends.
‘I did? When did I do that?’
‘Wait.
‘Yeah tell me about it,’ Peter groans, stretching his shoulder back. ‘I’m still not sure what that tree is made of, but it certainly isn’t wood.’
‘So, you
‘Tony? What’s wrong?’ the soldier’s voice is soft, filled with concern.
Bucky says something to her in Russian that Tony doesn’t understand, raising his glass in a toast and downing his drink in one, the red headed assassin following his example.
‘What was that?’ Steve presses when Tony doesn’t add anything else.
‘Peggy?’ Rhodes says, looking at Tony in surprise. ‘Tony not-’
‘Uh oh,’ he squeaks as Tony says his full name.
Tony barks out a laugh. ‘Brilliant, kid, absolutely brilliant.’
‘Just how often do you have to meet with them?’ Sam asks.
‘-are coming with me is that he knows HYDRA and can create just as much destruction as I can. And your Mo-’
A/N: Hi everyone! I hope you're all staying safe. Well here's the new chapter and I hope you enjoy it. Thank you so much to everyone who has left comments so far, I'm glad you all seem to be enjoying my latest ramblings.
thought to mention it?’ he asks the others. ‘No one thought to bring it up and ask what I thought?’
‘Wade you alright?’
‘None of your damn business. Now if you don’t mind I have a game to win,’ he growls, spinning around and pots his last three balls one after the other. ‘Anyone else want a game?’
‘Oh for the love of…I need the bar,’ Steve groans. ‘And I
He tries not to grin at the confused look on the mercenary’s scarred face as he opens the pack of paper. ‘Well I mean it might but you know I’m not the best at focussing and there’s a
‘Are you intending to use the cell phone at all this evening, or are you just going to look at it?’ a monotone voice says from the side.
‘No!’ Wanda screeches, but she’s not quick enough to stop Thanos grabbing Vision by the throat and ripping the Mind Stone from his head.
‘Mr Murdock I’m really sorry to bother you-’
all I remember Rocket, alright?’
‘Well, I was thinking,’ he traces patterns with his finger over Steve’s chest, ‘when it’s time to drop Peter back tomorrow after we’ve done all the decorations, maybe we could go into the city as a team and do something. I was thinking of taking everyone ice skating, renting the rink out after hours so we don’t have to worry about super strength hurting anyone, or us getting carried away. But obviously if you don’t want to we can think of something else, there’s plenty to do in New York after all. Maybe we could-’
Peter feels a sinking in his stomach. ‘You had a job didn’t you?’ He turns to look back out over the city.
‘He told me not to,’ he admits. ‘He said not to worry you and… and he told me to be more careful in the future.’
‘He…they’ve done it.’
‘If something’s happened on Asgard it could be Thor’s come here seeking sanctuary,’ Steve muses out loud, ‘or it could be there’s trouble and he’s stopped here to warn us with a band of warriors.’
‘At least you know how to keep me quiet,’ he grins as the soldier pulls away.
A/N: Hi everyone. Sorry I'm a little late updating this week. I'm going to try and update every Friday, but if you don't see a post it'll definitely be here by Saturday.
‘With the kid you’ve practically adopted,’ Steve points out.
‘We starting or what?’ Sam shouts.
‘Why is it my fault they dragged you shopping?’ Bucky demands from his spot on the wall that Peter’s webbed him to, one hand trying to prise off the webs from his metal arm and chest.
‘I just want to go out for a couple of hours,’ he’s now sat in the doctor’s office trying to convince him to let him go and see Peter give a presentation at his school. ‘
‘We better get her out of here,’ he mutters to Steve, ‘before it gets too much for her.’
‘And Clint will stay here for the drinks,’ Bucky grins.
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter considers giving an affirmative, but then pauses. Could he take out Deadpool? ‘I’m not sure,’ he answers truthfully. ‘I’d like to think I could, and if he was threatening to hurt people I’m sure I could at least keep him tied up. But if he did go rogue I’d have to call the Avengers.’
‘Isn’t it?’ Sam cuts him off. ‘Don’t bullshit me, Bucky. I’m not taking it any more. You don’t think you deserve happiness because of all the people you killed? What about the guy over there that used to build weapons for a living and got named the Merchant of Death? What about the borderline insane merc who killed more people than probably the rest of this team combined? You’re saying they don’t deserve to be happy and make their partners happy?’
‘If they did it could give us an idea of how they’re powered,’ he replies, dragging over the piece of furniture. ‘We may be able to find a way to neutralise it and possibly destroy one of the stones; then Thanos wouldn’t be able to collect them all and complete his plan.’
and… well look at me!’
‘Steve,’ Bucky turns serious again and puts a hand on his shoulder, ‘Tony is absolutely crazy about you; anyone with eyes can see that. The tension between the two of you is ridiculous, I’m surprised you’ve just been releasing it through arguments. I’d have got to the ripping the clothes off stage ages ago, but that’s just me.’
‘Help the Avengers can’t give you?’
‘But-’
‘You alright?’ Hope asks her, balancing a box on her hip.
‘Oh thank god for Deadpool,’ Steve sighs.
‘Begin,’ FRIDAY says, and all hell breaks loose.
The soldier smiles and nods, stepping out onto the ice before he can second guess himself. Tony gently leads him around the rink, giving his hand a squeeze every so often, and never once letting go. Even when the other start to race up and down the centre, the two of them stay in their own little world.
‘As for our next step,’ he stares at the picture of Spider-Man, holding the bridge sign as a shield and spinning the fallen droid like he’s swinging Thor’s hammer, ‘I’d like you to contact our friend in the US. Tell him to move back to the east coast and that he needs to play his trump card. Get close to the boy that is linked to the team, get the information we need. Spider-Man is becoming a nuisance, he was key in bringing down Ajax’s latest mission, although he did well in finding a way to bring it around and get under Deadpool’s skin. From what all our sources can tell us, that
‘We got back and had an argument,’ he chokes out between his sobs. ‘Then they turned up. He managed to deal with most of the helicopters, but I got one down to the ground and he said to check everyone was out the fight. Then I got hit by a rotor and one of them grabbed me and said they were taking me to their boss. Tony,’ he broke off with another sob, then took a deep breath. ‘He told them to leave me and he’d go with them.’ Steve feels like someone’s grabbing onto his lungs. ‘Nat? Please tell me he’s here. He didn’t go right? He’s still here? Nat, please. Please, he has to be.’ Natasha shushes him and pulls him back into a hug, rocking him backwards and forwards.
He cuts him off by pressing a kiss to his lips. ‘Steve, we could have the mother of all armies arrive on our doorstep tomorrow. No more waiting around and putting off what we want, alright? I’m ready for this, I’m pretty sure
Training with Natasha is still one of his favourite things to do in the training room, on a par with finally being able to train properly with Steve. It’s still strange to think the skinny kid from Brooklyn that he used to have to pick up and dust off from whatever alley he’d gotten beaten up in that time is now able to hold his own against him, even beat him.
‘Wait you’re the guy who went giant on us in Berlin?’ Peter’s eyes go wide. ‘Dude that was
Steve’s only response is to laugh.
Tony laughs. ‘Babe I will
‘Hey, Doc,’ Peter greets him sheepishly.
He shrugs. ‘I may have been a little more…thorough than with many others. I couldn’t resist the opportunity to tease him in the future.’
Tony smirks at her. ‘Iron Man was a theory once, Hermione. What about we give the theory a shot?’ Wanda laughs and nods, feeling tired but wanting to at least give it a go before calling it a day. Tony’s smirk falls from his lips and he looks at her in concern. ‘You sure you’re up to this? We can always do this tomorrow.’
‘Tony,’ Wanda’s voice makes him pause in his task, but he still can’t turn to face her. ‘You’ve done
smarter than them.’
,’ Tony rolls his eyes. ‘If you don’t make sweet love to me until neither of us can walk straight I’m going to kick you out of the bedroom for a
‘I suggested Tony be the third,’ Nick says, ‘but he was adamant the team voted and suggested T’Challa as an alternative.’
‘Why is the reactor still in my chest?’ he asks, fear tightening around his throat and making his voice sound strained. ‘Were they waiting for me to heal up from everything else before putting my body through the surgery?’ When the soldier doesn’t respond Tony starts to panic, the monitors telling both occupants that his heart rate was increasing. ‘Steve why haven’t they taken it out?’
‘Thank you.’
‘Alright what about soccer then? Should be slightly less scary for you Sam,’ Steve grins.
Wanda’s still laughing as they reach the common area. Loki take the opportunity to twirl her around under the mistletoe, dipping her back and then, as he pulls her up placing a soft kiss to her lips. Once she’s upright again, a slightly shocked look on her face, he tells her. ‘You are too fair to be so sorrowful, let your heart heal, little witch, you deserve to laugh more.’
He looks up at Tony’s nervous question and loses himself in those brown eyes all over again. No matter how many times he’s looked at him, Steve can never get enough of those eyes. Tony’s face might be a perfect mask, especially to the media, but Steve’s always been able to read everything in his eyes. Tony’s hand goes to the back of his neck, pulling him closer for another kiss, the other goes to the front of his shirt, clenching in the fabric and pulling him forwards as Tony lays back on the bed.
promise to you, Tony.’
As the two soldiers go back to the training mat, Sam with them this time, Tony notices a new person entering through the door and catches Natasha’s eye, gesturing towards them with his head and then nodding towards Bucky. The smile and answering nod he gets tells him that she’s on the same wavelength as him.
‘Definite challenge,’ Wade agrees, grinning at an exasperated Peter. ‘What do you think, Widow? Just the head?’
‘Where’s everyone else? Usually there’s at least a couple of people in here watching TV or reading, or something.’
Tony raises an eyebrow. ‘And that is?’
Peter deals with an excitable fan, and Bucky prepares to head back to America.
‘Hawaiian!’ Wade pipes up from his spot next to the teen.
