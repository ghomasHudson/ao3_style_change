"Yeah. Yeah, we're just... hanging out."
Well, then. It looked like Tony was going home with Steve. Not like there weren’t a million empty beds at Gryffindor. He untangled himself carefully, feeling a twinge at the little noise of protest Tony made. After a few seconds of deliberation, he carefully lifted him off the couch, bridal style, tucking Tony’s head against his shoulder. He was heavier than Steve expected, but nothing he couldn’t handle.
"Cover up and hold the flashlight. I'll carry this kid until he can walk. We need to get going. There is an entire group of people waiting in the dark for a back up generator that is never going to come online." Steve picked Josh up in a bridal hold and took the lead.
“Tony!” Steve almost shouted, mortified to the depth of his being that Tony somehow knew the nature of his sinful thoughts.
“That’s where they stash their stash? Is that why it’s so heavily guarded? Wait, how do you know?”
“We can do better than that.”
That was a bit of a sore point. Tony felt responsible for his witches, he did, even though he hadn't asked for them, but he really felt much more responsible for Steve. It didn't even compare.
Oh holy hell,
“Come on, Clint, let's go spar.” Natasha held out her hand to Hawkeye. Who didn't budge.
"Depends on whether he secretly has the hots for Natasha. Then she'd be number one. What do you think, Nat? Does he want in your pants?" Clint waggled his eyebrows at her.
“I wanted to say thank you for the suit. It's great. And thank you for... liberating my shield for me. I trust Ms Williams would have gotten it eventually, but it feels really good to have it back.” Steve sounded almost shy.
Steve doesn't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing as Tony stumbles clumsily out of Steve's double bed, but he is too tired to care much. He's asleep before Tony has left the room.
for you!" He turned to Tony with a look of mild horror on his face. "Oh my God, you're going to break his heart. You're going to do that thing you do when someone tries to get close to you and pretend you don't care and run for the hills. I mean, run to Vegas and try to drink yourself into a coma. With strippers and such... Jesus, Tony, you can't do that to him! Everyone is going to hate you when you do that to him!"
“I’m going back to the US,” Tony said.
“It ate Clint’s Bon Jovi cassette.”
“One would think,” Tony said, although as far as he knew the Fae could be notorious for being dead beat dads. “What happened?”
"Arrangements? Tell me this isn’t going to involve fireworks and dancing elephants and the Dodgers moving back to Brooklyn."
Steve wouldn't be able to even if he wanted to. He's too high on endorphins to even consider it.
Steve sighed. "Yes, it is. If you want to, I can order the others to not take that spot, so it doesn't offend your sensibilities to take an order from me. But you'll still end up in that spot."
His bladder wakes him up at 2 am. He shuffles out into the hallway, but stops with his hand on the knob of the bathroom door when he notices a strip of light coming from under it. He's suddenly wide awake. Tony. He swallows and turns to go wait in his bedroom, when the light abruptly vanishes and the door opens and Steve has to press himself to the wall to let Tony by.
“Okay, so just for the sake of argument, who is this Porter fellow and what is the deal with Hydra?”
“The cats are good.” Off to splendid start, he was. What else? What else? “They didn’t like the flight. They really didn’t. I’m telling you, I am never flying with five cats again. Brucie yowled for seven hours straight, I think he may have extra narrow ear canals or something, I’ll have to ask the vet…” Tony babbled on, wondering if this really was what Steve wanted to talk about. Steve was nodding, so maybe it was? No, it wasn’t. It was like they were stuck in that courtroom again, talking about all that shit with impassive faces. Except for the eyes. Steve’s eyes were hungry. They were latched on to Tony, devouring the sight of him, probably not even listening to anything he was saying. And why the hell Was Tony still on the opposite side of the limo from him? He trailed off…
Tony lifts his face and Steve can hear him wipe his his face on his wifebeater as he shuffles closer on his knees. A foil package rips.
“Actually,” Tony cocks his head, “why don't you just keep watching the game and let me do my thing. Never mind me.”
Tony was still cursing the filthy little traitors when they were stomping the snow off their boots in the entrance way. Steve wasn’t listening, he could only stare at Tony’s bright eyes and ruddy cheeks and nod in what seemed appropriate places. When they were ready to go back up, McGonegall was standing there with that small smile on her lips.
Oh. This was about Steve. This was only Steve's second Christmas out of the ice. Tony had no idea what he'd done last year, he'd been a little busy with people that could turn into fire and rescuing Presidents, but it had probably been rough on Steve. He didn't have decades of practice dealing with loss and loneliness. Not that having Tony around would make any difference to Steve, Tony thought, because he was shit at being good company during the holidays. But apparently it was painful to Steve if anyone was alone, even Tony. Even if Tony didn't care.
“Wife? Girlfriend?” Tony inquired, “She left? Died?”
"Still," he managed, "I don't think it was like that. It was like... Like you feel about the Iron Man armor. Like I was something that he created and was proud of, but not like I was an actual person for him to like or dislike. Imagine if you had only one set of the armor and you had no way of making another one and you lost it. How long would you keep looking for it?"
Tony looked at him oddly. Then he shook his head wearily. “Don't worry about it, I've gone without food for much longer than this. I am not even hungry.”
"So it's in a castle on an island in the Western sea, a bit to the north of here," concluded Steve.
"And then the Big Guy would smash your tree and your cookies would be the last of your worries. Honestly, Clint." Bruce gave him a sad smile. "Actually, I feel a little angry just thinking about it..." With that he snapped a cookie in half. "Whoops. Sorry." He quickly shoved one half in his mouth and tossed the other to Sam, who followed suit.
“I said, don't lie to me, before you know it you'll be talking about the good old days in Albion.”
Swell. That was just swell.
“No, Tony, I
"In that case, have you tried my brother Arthur's court? He may have behaved atrociously towards me, but he has a fine nose for picking the bravest of men, I have to admit. They are generally considered the best in land."
“For what? For not letting you break Clint’s little heart?”
He turned to Phil.
“You can’t expect me to wait three more weeks to redo the processor! What the hell am I going to do for three weeks?!”
"Excellent, thank you. Black Widow? This is Captain Rogers, United States Armed Forces, are you in a position to confirm how many assailants we are dealing with?
“He’ll be receiving with me.”
"How do we get back here? Tell me! Now! Or your ear goes with me."
“Merlin, Tony, that wasn’t a horcrux, was it? You didn’t kill part of Bruce’s soul, did you?”
"This is really very undignified, you pulling me like I am three years old. Why am I on the ice, Cap? I was perfectly happy as a landlubber."
“You know that Little Match Girl story? That’s me, Tony. That’s me getting to be a part of normal life with you and your roommates for one evening, and then freezing to death when the illusion burns out.” He stood and shrugged his jacket on. Then he picked up his duffel bag and faced Tony, who was still hugging his knees, high up on the bed. Tasha was butting her head against his ankles and meowing for food. Tony ignored her.
, he couldn't afford. The fucking palladium in the arc reactor was going to kill him sooner than he thought and the last series of failed attempts at finding a substitute had failed quite spectacularly just yesterday. So he was a little on edge and these smug assholes on the dais were just presenting themselves as sitting ducks, really.
“If you call me Uncle Steve in public, I will end you.”
“We’re not even going to talk about that, so just don’t. I gotta get back to my shift at De Wijnhaven. Thank you for your help, Steve. ” Steve nodded and started walking, already reaching into the bag. Tony watched him go, knowing he had no choice but to let him.
Silence fell again.
Tony could have sworn he had designed the ventilation system in the tower so that the workshop was on a completely separate system. Just in case something blew up in a particularly noxious way, with the separate systems they wouldn't have to replace the entire office staff of Stark Industries when it happened. It was sure to be more economical in the long run.
“Then you know it isn’t that simple. Maybe I would have considered the long term ramifications a bit more carefully if I hadn’t been dying?”
Steve jumped down from the ladder and went for his shoes. He sat himself  down heavily on the loveseat under Tony’s bed, so Tony couldn’t see him. Tony flopped onto his back and studied the ceiling. Fuck, fuck,
"We don't know that they are witches for sure." Steve tried to sound reasonable. "They also said the demon was thirty foot long and he isn't even any bigger than me. And he's not a demon."
Tony sighed and sat back down on the bed.
And that was how three Avengers ended up freezing their asses off on the top of Stark tower watching Falcon whooping and doing loop-de-loops over the city's Christmas light displays. It was the weirdest start of the holiday season that Tony could remember. Not the worst, though. Not the worst.
Tony was not a good skater. In fact, he might well be worse than Clint, who was clutching the railing more often than not. He had explained this to Steve, but Steve's solution had been to hold on to Tony's hands while slowly skating backwards, allowing Tony to find his footing somewhat.
"So it does. But her boat is black, like the horse. And if it turns out she has no ill intentions, then it won't harm her anyway, right?"
Making it up as he went along, he came to a hover right over the woman's head and turned to face the mob. He smirked behind the face plate as they staggered back a few paces and their expressions changed from rage to confusion to fear. But then they cycled back to rage and surged forward again, shouting gibberish and throwing rocks at him. He raised his arms and fired the repulsors at their feet to push the crowd and their torches away from those dry branches.
She looked pointedly at the armor. See, Tony knew she wasn't stupid. “That is my armor. It's, uh, possessed. But I am not. And it is not very powerful unless I am in it.”
“He likes redheads?” Tony asked Steve.
Tony watched Steve take a step back as he aimed the repulsor at him. At
“Little busy, Romanov.”
“Good thing I came prepared then.” Tony digs out several foil wrapped packages out of his pocket and tosses them on the bed next to Steve. “How do you want to do this? Gonna open yourself up for me? Or you want me to do it?”
Steve slid his right hand into the front of Tony's lounge pants and cupped his balls. Tony sucked in a sharp breath. "No. It means you need to get back to bed while you still can," Steve whispered in his ear.
"What?"
Steve hesitated, torn between his two duties. Tony frowned at him.
. And which you don't now! When you need to know what I think, you need to fucking talk to me, not decide what is best for me all by yourself. I hate it when people think they know what is best for me." Tony paused for breath, then barreled on. "If this relationship is to work you have to stop retreating into your own head."
In retrospect, Tony should have left Steve at home for the congressional hearings. Steve didn't laugh and eyeroll his way through those, like he had a t the expo. He was serious and grim, standing behind Tony. Tony didn't know if Steve thought the armor should be given over or not, but he obviously didn't approve of Tony's flippancy while denying them. Tony would have loved to tone it down for him, but there was more at stake here than Steve knew. It'd be out of character, for one, and if he started acting out of character, there'd be scrutiny and
. I didn't tell you to fuck the man. That was all your idea. I was just... pleasantly surprised you seemed to be 'getting along' and was disinclined to break up that particular party."
"I cannot access my databases, either, Sir." JARVIS sounded mournful. "I only have the actual data you've uploaded to the suit." The way he said it, Tony had a sense he might possibly come to regret deleting a bunch of data to make room for the entire StarkTunes music library recently. It had been an emergency, of course. He'd been stuck on a long boring Avengers mission without a particularly obscure Black Sabbath bootleg he was jonesing to hear, and the experience had been so traumatic, he'd had to make sure that would never, ever happen again. Still. Now he was wondering what he had decided to delete. And if it would be relevant in his current situation.
He turned again to leave, and this time, he didn’t pause when Tony spoke. “I won’t,” Tony said, so quietly that Steve could barely hear him.
Steve squared his shoulders. “Mine.”
Or at least, not a good one.
Tony glanced up at him, looking somehow more exhausted than he had three days ago. “Depends,” he said. “You got your lawyer with you?”
He felt himself barreling ever closer to that edge, careening out of control while Tony worked him in tight circles just under the head of his dick. He felt hazy and fevered and perpetually on the brink, until Tony pressed a kiss to his ear and issued a command.
“What?” Rhodes said, glancing between them. “Why?”
Only stared, emotions he couldn’t begin to name forming a knot in his throat.
“Yes.”
Steve exhaled sharply. “Not like that—” he started before cutting himself off. He wasn’t going to get into this. Not here, not now. “I’ll talk to you later.”
Steve shook his head. “Same reason you are,” he said, and Rhodes smiled, something softening in his expression.
Tony arched a disbelieving eyebrow. “No?” he asked, with a small smirk. “You’re not here to interrogate me on what went wrong and what the chances are that Rumlow’s victims will get any kind of justice?”
“I’ll hex your lips shut permanently.”
“No. I heard you. You’re not fucking with me, are you?”
He didn’t have to wait long. When he heard the key in the lock he suddenly felt sick to his stomach. What the hell was he going to say? There probably weren’t a lot of precedents. He stood up and wiped his hands on his jeans.
"So do I," he countered and then they were off.
plan. See, if you'd-"
"I had my suspicions. A military serum expert named Steve Rogers? That looked a carbon copy of the old Captain America? It wasn't rocket science. Don't know how the man survived, but -"
"Tony?" He tried. "JARVIS? Can you hear me?"
"What do you mean a hermit said?" he finally managed, hoping none of that had shown on his face.
"Should we expect any larger than usual charges for 'personal entertainment' to be charged to the company account, Mr. Stark?" How she could convey so much venom in such a sweet tone of voice was a mystery to Tony. It would serve her well once he'd made her CEO, but dammit, she wasn't the boss yet.
Natasha pursed her lips a moment. "What did you do to him?"
There was a perfunctory knock on the doors and then Morgaine strode into his sanctuary. Tony turned toward her.
“Doing what?” The voice was flat.
He looked at Steve who had come to stand leaning with his back against Tony's workbench, arms crossed and smiling widely. Tony ignored the now familiar swoop in his stomach and glared at him. "And you need to not subvert my A.I."
The next time he woke up, Steve was still sleeping, but he'd managed to mostly disentangle himself in the process, so Tony's extraction was more successful this time around. He snuck off to take a shower.When he came back a slightly flustered Pepper was trying to make a much more flustered Steve do the walk of shame.
“Goodbye, Tony. Thanks for everything.” He opened it. “You’ll have to catch that last cat by yourself though. I can’t come back this time.”
Steve dug into his food with a grim determination. Maybe he could hang out with the younger kids this year. That would be alright, wouldn’t it? He looked up from his food and found Tony’s eyes on him, a sullen look on his face. Averting his eyes, he caught three of the 13 year olds staring at him. They giggled and blushed and started elbowing each other. Right. Maybe not. Despondent, he turned back to his food.
She gave him a slightly less dour look that meant she was pleased with his assessment. “Good. I will fly him around the battlements tonight then.” She made to leave.
Tony slammed back into the lab after Clint and Natasha had deposited him on the top of Stark Tower and called for JARVIS to set him up with a video call to Fury. For once, Fury didn't make Tony wait.
"I am sure I have no idea, Sir. Mr. Barton is indeed baking, but the workshop's ventilation system is not connected to the kitchen."
"Pasta is the only thing I have, but I can make a pasta casserole?"
scenario.
“Yeah, I think I can do that.” Um, that came out sounding a bit breathless. Forcing his voice back under control, he asked: “Shall we go, then?”
"Yeah, no. Maybe if you'd shown up in dockers, loafers and a pink polo shirt, but here you are looking like you're just stopping over on your way to shoot up a college campus. Steve stays. Talk or don't talk, I don't care."
Tony was doodling on his notepad when someone dropped heavily into the seat next to him. Suppressing a surge of annoyance at his personal space being invaded, he glanced to his right. Dark hair, some kind of mall cop uniform, and a prosthetic left hand that was laying lifelessly on a muscled thigh. It took a second for him to connect the dots. Could it…?
? Why didn't
"It's James. Pleasure is all mine, Captain Rogers."
Tony avoided the press like the plague. He no-commented his way through a few events and acted with complete indifference towards what was already being dubbed 'the trial of the century'. Which was a little premature since they hadn't even reached the twenties yet. There were days he absorbed every little detail of the trial, even watched all the commentaries. And there were days when he could not stand to hear one more word about it and he lost himself in rebuilding the armor yet again, pretending like he didn't feel like he was teetering on the edge of a cliff.
Another unidentified object was sailing towards Steve’s head. This time he ducked and didn’t change it to forget-me-nots until it had almost hit Tony’s bike. Tony shouted in outrage and then it was
“And now you’re here because…?”
"We've stopped the bleeding. Maybe God will grant him a chance to heal so he can devote his youthful prowess to His service. I would not not deny him that chance, be it small or large," he tried.
He forced himself to focus on the boner killer zombie in the center of the fight, who still showed no signs of anything affecting it at all. Percival slipped and stumbled and the thing lunged for him, but Steve caught it square in what passed for its face with the shield. He hit it with a force that should have shattered any bones the thing had, but that only distracted it long enough to miss Percival. Tony first thought the knight had slipped on the water their cloaks had been dripping all over the church floor but then he noticed that the thing left footsteps that were shinier than the puddles of water. What the hell was that? It didn't look like blood, it wasn't dark enough. But whether it was ichor or embalming fluid or whether the thing was wetting its pants, Tony had no clue. It didn't actually matter, he thought, the important question was, was it flammable? Apart from actually going to get a sample and analyzing it, which wasn't going to happen, he could only think of one practical way to find out.
The Avengers all looked at each other and then settled on Sam. Who pointed at himself in surprise. "Me? You think he feels the strongest about me?"
“But I
"Do you have a way to get into contact with your commanding officers? Have they said anything, these last few days?"
Dinner is... okay. Steve feels awkward and torn, and has to occasionally tamp down his urges, but Tony is good at filling silences, even if he eyes Steve sharply from time to time. By the time they're done, Steve feels almost back to normal.
Tony shut his mouth, his throat closing up in misery.
There is no trace of Tony when he gets downstairs.
“No, you’re paying me to hunt cats, apparently.”
Tony stared at him for a long moment. “Yours,” he said, almost as if mulling the word — and all its implications — over.
Steve blinked, not following the rapid change in topic. “Fifth Amendment,” Rhodes said easily, clearly picking up on whatever Steve had missed.
“Tony—”
“No,” Steve said, stung.
Not until tonight, at least.
“Funny,” Bucky said, his grin widening. “I thought that was your job.”
A frantic tap on his shoulder was warning enough, issued with the understanding that Steve may want something different than what was about to happen. A laughable assumption, really, but he appreciated the thought — enough to take Tony deep into his throat and hollow his cheeks on the way up, earning him more swearing that sounded sweeter than a symphony before the taste of earth and salt welled up on his questing tongue.
“That ruling was for a new trial after the verdict had been returned,” Tony said. “This was determined before we even got to the verdict.”
“Captain Rogers,” he said, holding out his hand for Steve to shake.
“Mistrial,” Steve said grimly.
“I think the Takings Clause has a better chance of standing up in Court, if you use a close reading of
Tired of pretending that Tony Stark hadn’t stopped his life on a dime and split his life into two inalterable pieces — before the firebrand prosecutor and after.
“Yeah,” Tony consoled him in a rough whisper, “Yeah, I know.”
“I know,” Steve said. “I’m going to go talk to Tony, see if I can get to the bottom of it.”
“Whatcha doing?”
It was with hardly another syllable of protest that Steve watched Tony spit in his hand and wrap it roughly around the length of him. Tight, hot. Shaking slightly with the release Steve had given him only moments before, and surely it was that knowledge more than the physical sensations themselves that had him jerking into the firm grip.
Tony shook his head. “You said it yourself, the only thing we’ll end up doing is tearing ourselves apart,”
Steve snorted and shook his head. “After he almost prosecuted you for perjury?”
“Can I come in?”
What Steve was surprised to see was that the crystal decanter full of whiskey in the back corner of the room was still full, its glasses unused and empty.
The fact that he had murdered three innocent bystanders didn’t help either.
Steve swallowed, hard, and jerked his head in a nod.
Tony nodded slowly. “Thank you.”
Tony slammed the file down on his desk. “God
“I’ll bet you do,” Tony muttered.
“To IAB.”
“Then I’ll see your Takings Clause and raise you
But he believed in actions, not rhetoric, and so it was with a passionate kiss that he first captured Tony’s lips and then left him in the name of something better — namely the slow, tantalizing drag of his mouth down the length of Tony’s body before earning his first impressions of the shape of him. Hard and thick, twitching to be nearer the molten heat of Steve’s breath. For all their rivalry, for all their flirting masquerading as bickering, Steve could only conjure up the utmost affection for the man beneath him and it was that affection that multiplied tenfold when first he allowed his tongue to seek its prize.
Steve glowered at him. “I’m not toeing any line,” he said. “I’m stating the facts.”
Steve half-smiled. “That’s LAPD,” he said. “NYPD’s motto is Faithful to Death. And I intend to uphold that.”
Something dark flashed across Tony’s face. “Orders?” he repeated, his voice dangerously low. “What orders would those be?”
“Oh, nothing,” Steve said with forced casualness. “The Rumlow verdict is due back today, and the local news is doing its usual Tony Stark love fest.”
Clearly Tony had no intention of going back in front of news cameras after the mistrial had been declared.
“And with
Tired of fighting, tired of keeping his distance.
Steve almost smiled. “No, I don’t.”
Steve sighed and stood, grabbing his suit jacket from the back of his chair. “I know that,” he said, tugging it on. “But this is just how the justice system goes sometimes.”
“Tony—”
“Sure, use this as an excuse to go talk to your boyfriend,” Bucky grumbled, but his usual teasing tone didn’t quite come through, his expression still dark.
He was floating.
“Secondly,” Tony said again, raising his voice to speak over Steve, “when the situation that Barnes provoked escalated, he drew his firearm in violation of NYPD policy. Thirdly, he shot Rumlow unprovoked.”
He half-turned, his heart beating painfully in his chest.
“I get it,” Steve said, because he did.
Steve had no response to that.
Not now though.
“You took an oath,” Tony said, without any real heat. “To serve and protect.”
“Steve.” Steve forced himself to look at Tony, to meet his eyes. “Yes or no.”
“And last time I checked, I don’t take orders from you.” Steve shot back. “So why don’t you try talking to me instead of trying to force me out of your office?”
“I went to Harvard,” Tony said, his expression pinched. “Where in addition to partying, I was busy learning about the judicial system you and I both swore to uphold.” Steve shook his head but Tony didn’t let him interrupt. “But you’re right, I wouldn’t know what it was like to have someone there to take care of me because my parents were dead.”
“Just watch the game, Steve. Just watch the game.”
And normally Steve was more than content to let that process play out, whether in one of their offices, or in a bar after work hours, or wherever, under rare circumstances, they found themselves alone.
Tony laughed, and Steve felt himself finally relax, just slightly, at the sound he hadn’t even realized he’d been waiting to hear. “Sorry,” Tony said, aimed more at Steve than Rhodes. “Long day. Needed to clear my head.”
Bucky’s smile widened. “Like you would’ve let him.”
Swept away and helpless as his climax overtook him, rocked him from head to toe as muscles clenched and he spurted into Tony’s hand. It was torture and rapture simultaneously, and in turns painful and euphoric to the extent that his vision whited out and he threatened to collapse. It went on and on, until he had nothing left to give the man who still held him.
And then, against his will, reality seeped in the cracks in his foundation left by the seismic shift of Tony’s mouth against his ear.
“I’m saying that you have no idea what it’s like to be out there with a target on your back and the potential for anyone to have a gun aimed at you,” Steve said, his voice tight.
“Then you’ll want a lawyer.”
It was a quiet day at the precinct, the kind of day that might tempt him to relax, but he had learned a long time ago that quiet days rarely stayed that way, and normally preceded trouble. To distract himself from that fact, he turned on the TV in his office to watch the local news coverage of a trial he’d been following from the beginning.
“I know that—” Tony said, more irritated than normal, and Steve tuned back into the conversation, in case he needed to step in.
Tony, of course, had spent the better part of his life avoiding the sound of silence. It was why he talked so much, Steve thought. To quiet the thoughts that tend to roar if nothing else is around to drown them out. It was without turning to look at Steve that his lips parted; hardly enough to allow the breath that passed through.
“You can’t seriously be considering pursuing charges here.”
His eyes jerked up, sky blue to earthen brown, and Steve knew just what he was being given when Tony’s hand covered his own and his hips arched into the weight of their touch. This man had never allowed himself to be vulnerable, knowing all too well the consequences of letting your guard down. This,
Tony suddenly couldn’t seem to meet his eyes. “The decision to bring charges isn’t up to me alone.”
Steve shook his head slowly. “I can’t — I can’t turn my back on Bucky,” he said, because he couldn’t. No matter what else may happen, he couldn’t do that. “Maybe I wish I could, but—”
“Are you—”
“Tony—“ Steve started softly.
Steve’s mouth went dry. “I don’t—”
“What is there to discuss?” Steve asked, watching as Tony downed his glass of whiskey in one go. “Brock Rumlow murdered three innocent bystanders rather than let himself be peacefully arrested, and now he’s dead. There’re a lot of people who would call that justice.”
Steve swallowed and shook his head. “Why does it matter?” he asked, a little desperately. “Hindsight is always 20/20, and—”
It happened so fast Steve could hardly track the movement.
Steve was tired.
“Rogers,” Steve said, at the same time Tony answered his phone with a lazy, “Go for Stark.”
“The facts?” Tony repeated, with scorn. “You want the facts, Cap? Because I can tell you the facts. First and foremost, Sgt. Barnes had no reason to be harassing Rumlow, who had been released on bail with no additional investigation pending. Secondly—”
Tony glared at him. “He was unarmed.”
And then Steve went back to work, and discernible language ceased. Their communication devolved purely into the physical, with scrabbling fingers through his combed hair and a long hand placed so gently on the back of his head to guide him. Up and down, again and again. Steve enjoyed the taste far more than he would have been willing to admit in different circumstances and it was with an undeniable zeal that he brought Tony up and up, winding him ever higher in the name of inciting the freefall.
Steve’s heart seemed to be beating painfully fast in his chest. “I — I lied.”
it, Steve, what the hell do you think you’re going to accomplish with this?” he demanded. “You’re not going to help Barnes. The only thing you’re gonna do is get your ass thrown into jail for perjury!”
Steve closed his eyes, squared his shoulders, and walked away.
Steve tuned them out after that point, for the most part. He didn’t mind letting Tony and Rhodes work through this without his input. In fact, under any other circumstance, he would love seeing Tony’s mind at work, trying to solve a logic puzzle.
,” Tony insisted in a voice so dripping with sarcasm that it even managed to wrench a smile from someone so perilously close to orgasm that it felt inevitable.
The TV cut to an interview with Tony from a few years ago, and Steve propped his chin on his hand as he watched. “As I’m sure everyone knows,” Tony was saying, flashing his trademark smile at the camera and interviewer, “my father’s legacy is complicated. He spent his career working in the best interest of his clients, and that included keeping what he thought were innocent people out of prison. After his death, I learned the truth the hard way, that, whether directly by his hand or not, many criminals walked free. And I saw that I had become a part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability. I had my eyes opened. I came to realize that I had more to offer this world than just—”
Whatever story he was about to launch into was interrupted by his phone and Steve’s cell going off simultaneously.
Tony nodded before squaring his shoulders. “Then like I said, you should go.”
“Do I seriously need a lawyer with me just to talk to you?”
He looked like he wanted to say something in response to that, but before he could, they had arrived at Tony’s office, where a rather-frazzled looking Jarvis waved them in without a word.
Tony pushed him away, and had Steve not still been pliant from his orgasm he might’ve resisted. As it was, he rocked back on his heels, blinking at Tony, who suddenly couldn’t seem to meet his eyes as he buttoned his shirt and pulled his pants up. “You should—” Tony’s voice broke, and he cleared his throat. “You should go.”
“He killed—”
“Does it change the way you see me?”
“It does,” Tony told him. “It means you’re still the man that I thought you were, and that matters a hell of a lot.” He cocked his head, just slightly. “Or at least, it matters to me.”
“And you’re no longer a soldier, Rogers, and this isn’t a war,” Tony shot back. “There are laws and systems in place for a reason and it’s not on you — or Barnes — to circumvent those laws.”
“You know I wouldn’t,” Steve said with a chuckle. “You good holding down the fort here, Sgt. Barnes?”
He had never felt more like it.
Both Tony and Steve sobered instantly when they listened to the respective people on the other end, and Rhodes glanced between them, his brow furrowing. “What’s going on?” he asked, when both Steve and Tony had finished their clipped conversations.
And it left them right back where they had started.
Not that it mattered. Steve couldn’t quite string together any words, feeling every word of the call he had just gotten like a punch to his stomach.
It was one of his favorite things to watch, all the more so when he had finally realized that that was why Tony looked at him the way he did. Steve knew he was easy to dismiss, former Army officer, currently NYPD officer. “A big, dumb puppy,” someone had once called him, and Steve had laughed it off, knowing too well that most people weren't willing to look past the job or the muscles to really seem him. But Tony never looked at him that way. Tony looked at him like he was a never-ending puzzle, something Tony was determined to discover every possible solution to.
Steve didn’t answer him, looking past him at Tony, who still couldn’t quite seem to meet his eye. “I need to go deal with this,” he said, feeling numb.
The man in front of him was intoxicating, all expensive cologne and wiry muscle beneath finely tailored suits. The sensation of lightheadedness only intensified as his fingers tripped up the length of fine buttons that fitted Tony’s vest across his abdomen. They parted easily, letting his questing fingers through to the pristine white shirt beneath. He could feel the jump and bunch of muscle under his touch, could feel the way Tony’s long torso stretched and flexed to be nearer his caress, and for a moment Steve considered a prayer of thanks.
“Don’t remind me,” Tony said sourly. “Rhodey, did I ever tell you—”
“In a sworn deposition, where you put your hand on a Bible and swore to tell the truth, the full truth and nothing but.”
Steve gaped at him, completely lost for words.
He turned the volume on the TV up, listening as the reporters turned the conversation to Tony. “—the State’s case has been helmed by New York County District Attorney, Tony Stark. The son of legendary attorney Howard Stark, Tony quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant mind. At age 8, he wrote his first
Steve exhaled sharply. “You don’t get to play that card—“
“Just answer one question for me,” he said, sounding tired, defeated. “If it had been you, if you had been standing where Barnes was, would you have taken that shot?”
“So that’s it?” he said. “Because I support my friend, you and I can’t—”
“But that’s exactly why I need to go.” Dark eyes found his, jolted wide in surprise.  Had he thought Steve meant the job? The city entirely? Maybe he had. “I think you and I both know this won’t go anywhere good. We shouldn’t pretend that it won’t end with us on opposite sides, trying to stay together while we tear each other apart.”
He knew what Tony meant.
Steve groaned. “Don’t remind me.”
Rhodes grinned, though it looked more like a grimace. “Sorry about the drunken sailors about to descend on your city,” he said. “No one knows what to do with them.”
Tony rolled his eyes, but his angry flush had already started to recede, and a smile was even tugging at the corners of his mouth. “After what the Maryland District Court found in
That thrill had finally come to fruition now, with the attorney he so admired pressed against him so tightly he could feel their shared arousal in every gasped breath he managed to steal.
“Tony,” Steve repeated, even quieter this time, but Tony just shook his head.
Steve jerked upright, glancing guiltily at the doorway. “Oh, hey Buck,” he said, fumbling for the remote.
“Go, Captain.”
Tony nodded, half-smiling. “Yeah, I’m sure you do,” he muttered, for the first time making his way over to the whiskey and pouring himself a generous three fingers. “So,” he said, for the first time turning fully to Steve, “what can the New York County DA’s office do for the NYPD, Captain?”
So he fell back on the only reason he had left. “He was following orders.”
“Clearly not.”
He didn’t.
Warm and weightless somewhere firmly free of the constraints of earth while his heart beat a stunted staccato against his ribs. Blood pumped thickly through his veins and roared in his ears and in all his life, Steve Rogers had never felt more like he was precisely where he needed to be.
“There are no sides,” Steve told him. “And I know you’re doing what you believe in. So…” He paused, kicking his lips, weighing what he wanted to say against what he should. “So no matter what, I promise you, if you need me, I’ll be here.”
“No you don’t,” Tony said, looking at him evenly.
Steve opened his mouth to answer and closed it again.
He didn’t get there in time. Bucky perched on the edge of his desk, crossing his arms in front of his chest as he looked at the TV. “Slacking on the job, huh?” he said with a grin. “What’re you watching that’s so important?”
Rhodes nodded. “Ok, but the Supreme Court held that under Rule 606(b)—”
“Out on bail?” Bucky repeated. “Steve, he killed three people!”
It occurred to him as they savored, as their hearts raced, that Steve should stop this. He should pull away, he should create the physical distance he needed even if emotional distance was beyond his ability.
Bucky gave him a sloppy salute. “Aye, aye, Cap’n,” he said sarcastically, and Steve just shook his head as he was already halfway out the door, mind on Tony Stark and not on the dark look that once again clouded Bucky’s expression.
“Depends on what you want to talk about.”
He hadn’t known Brock Rumlow when the man worked on the force, had only met him after the arrest warrant had already gone out, but he had read enough of his file to know that from his conduct as a police officer, Rumlow was the worst of the worst, a glaring example — among far too many — of why public trust in NYPD was at an all-time low.
“I know that, too!” Tony snapped, his face red, his expression dangerous. He turned to look out the window, his arms crossed tightly in front of his chest, and Steve glanced at Rhodes, who didn’t seem concerned yet.
Perfect to stay there with his hip digging into the corner of the hard mahogany desk, perfect to taste the expensive whiskey on the man’s mouth, more than perfect to finally find out just how well they fit together. Somehow he knew they would, had known it from the first moment Tony had ever leveled eyes the color of swirling topaz on his own and had, with mock formality, called him “Captain”. The single word had sparked a thrill in his blood those years ago and it had only ever intensified with every case, with every late night. With every bitter argument and long look that came after.
“Which doesn’t render him incapable of provoking Bucky.”
They weren’t a mistake. This wasn’t a mistake. Steve would find a way to convince Tony that his trust was not misplaced.
Steve stared at him. “What are you talking about?”
, God,” he rasped, the profanity bringing a pleased heat to Steve’s face as he pulled off.
And there it was.  Title over familiarity, professionalism despite the fact that only minutes ago they had been breaking apart in each other’s arms.  Steve knew that there was no argument he could make that would change Tony’s mind, just as there was nothing Tony could say to change his. So he swallowed, hard, and he turned to leave, though he paused when Tony said, in a pained voice, “Steve—”
“Looks like there won’t be a retrial after all,” Tony said, conspicuously avoiding looking at Steve.
Even if his method of clearing his head normally involved going to a gym and pounding the dust out of a punching bag, not swapping a complicated legal problem for a different, also complicated legal problem.
“Shit,” Bucky echoed, his smile disappearing entirely. “So what does that mean?”
It was the best he could do under the circumstances, because then Tony pulled him closer and put his mouth to Steve’s ear. Talking fast and low, too fast and low for Steve to understand more than every third word or so. What he could understand, though, was Tony’s lips moving over the tender skin of his earlobe. Over and over, hot breath lighting nerves he didn’t know were so responsive only seconds before.
“And you don’t get to tell me that I can’t play that card,” Tony interrupted. He stared at Steve, something unreadable in his expression. “Do you know what I have wanted, ever since my parents died? I have wanted to see their killer in court. I have wanted to stare him down and watch him admit in front of everyone what he did. That he — that he murdered my parents for, I don’t even know, drug money, probably.” He broke off, his eyes wet, and looked down at his desk for a long moment. Steve couldn’t seem to bring himself to interject, his expression troubled as he watched Tony. When Tony looked up again, his eyes were dry. “All I ever wanted was my day in court, and my turn for justice.”
So rather than think himself into turning back, before he could force himself to step away from Tony’s grasping embrace, he did something he’d thought about more times than was decent for a man in his position. He ran his palms from Tony’s back, over strong shoulder blades down to his tapered waist and beyond. The tiny, rough inhale Tony took from his mouth as Steve’s hands passed over his ass was indecent. It made his head swim, forced his heart into a gallop and his mind to conjure just what sounds the man in front of him would make when at last Steve would sink into his waiting body.
Tony snorted a laugh and drew a hand across his face. “Sometimes I want to punch you in your perfect teeth,” he admitted. “Because you’re the perfect soldier, the perfect cop, the perfect
Rhodes gave him a look. “The Maryland bump stock ban didn’t include confiscation, and you know it.”
When sensitivity was certain he pulled away, wiping at his mouth only to bestow kisses on the jutting hipbone directly in his line of sight. Tony jumped at the first touch of skin and then trembled like gooseflesh had erupted over the length of his body. Which, of course, only made Steve do it again. And again, once more mapping the contours of a body he was only just introduced to moments ago.
He didn’t have an answer to that.
Tony came with a strangled shout, fingers tangled in Steve’s hair and pulling hard enough to send pain erupting over his scalp and rolling down his shoulders like liquid fire. Pleased and something approaching proud, Steve kept up his attention and worked the attorney through the crest of his orgasm, softly humming as the man’s essence filled his mouth and was swallowed down.
“Don’t say that,” Tony said and it wasn’t hard to hear the fire in his voice.
“Sgt. Barnes is—” Tony started but Steve cut him off.
Steve shook his head, a muscle working in his jaw. “Bucky is my oldest friend,” he said, his voice low, almost desperate. “I know you can’t possibly understand what it was like to be a poor kid growing up in Brooklyn but even when I had nothing, I had Bucky.” His glare deepened. “And while you were busy partying at Yale or wherever, he was always there to take care of me.”
It was with that hint of a challenge that he found the button of Tony’s fly, parted it. Lowered the zipper and lifted his eyes to find Tony reclined on elbows and staring intently. Pupils blown, dilated wide with the arousal Steve could feel waiting for him beneath fabric. For a moment they paused, staring. The captain asking permission and the prosecutor weighing his desire to give it. Steve had almost stepped away before a single word stopped him in his tracks.
A big, dumb puppy, someone had called Steve once.
“Language,” Bucky admonished, though his smile faded at the look on Steve’s face. “What is it?”
“Probably a lot of things,” Steve said. “But I’m not here for that.”
Which was never a good thing.
“That’s a nice spin on the story, Cap,” Tony said, his voice dripping in sarcasm as he poured himself another drink. “Glad to see you’re toeing the party line.” He drained half his drink before adding, “Like the good soldier you are.”
“There’s a song about that,” Steve said mildly as they headed toward Tony’s office, and Rhodes laughed before glancing sideways at him.
“We’re as good as we’re going to get, Happy.” That would have to do, since there was no chance in hell they could manage looking like they didn’t just have sex. “Ready when you are.”
. They both ran around like maniacs flinging whatever they could find and shouting the most ridiculous things they could think off. Pillows bounced off walls, and oranges. Steve got hit in the back by a football and Tony got hit in the face by a teddybear. A box of paperclips exploded above his head and showered Steve in colorful bits of metal He retaliated with glitter, which made Tony curse creatively. Half an hour later they were both out of breath from running and laughing. Steve sagged down to the floor with his back against the wall, holding up his hands in surrender. Tony plopped down in front of him, panting, with glitter in his hair and a wicked grin on his face. He held out a brown feather.
kind of thing. You gotta do what you gotta do. I understand that. I do.”
“You a good Christian boy?” Tony's whisper has an edge to it now, and his fingertips are trailing down Steve's abdomen. The feathery touch makes him shiver. He scrunches his eyes shut, forcing himself to keep breathing through his nose.
“I don't do Biology. That involves mucus.” Tony pretended to study his phone.
Unable to get up (unless he wanted to dislodge cats, which always ended with him on the wrong end of small sharp claws) he mentally pictured Bruce’s room and tried to figure out where to put his desk and loveseat. He’d have to get a bed, because Bruce had taken his own. Or maybe he should have another loft bed built. Then he could get a slightly bigger couch and create a corner for the cat boxes and maybe even one of those cat trees, so they’d stay out of the curtains. That was only going to work though if he got a corner desk and put his Pentium tower on some shelves, else he’d be blocking the radiator…
“We do.”
. He grits his teeth as Tony slides out, dick still somewhat hard and before he can register what's happening, Tony manhandles him onto his back and swallows down Steve's cock. He shouts and arches up into the wet heat and comes immediately down Tony's throat.
“Oh, for chrissakes, Steve. I already know your demon dreams were about me. I don't care! I mean, shit, I care... but -”
Lancelot flushed. Gaheris, who had a tenuous hold of his temper at the best of time, punched Dinadan between the shoulder blades and growled at him to not insult his brother. This caused Dinadan to almost drop his end of the litter and Galahad groaned in pain at the jolt.
"But he already knows the story! Wasn't he there?"
“Compulsion. It’s past midnight, but I don’t
"So they all went?"
“You don't need them, Iron Man. You still have everything that is important.”
"Is he dead?" Percival inquired.
Okay then.
"I have an unfortunate sense of humor," said Tony dismissively, "Sir Stephen can bear witness to that, if you want. But I thought the Grail was a cup."
Tony made a grumpy noise at that, but it wasn't long before his breath evened out in sleep. Steve pressed his face into Tony's hair and let out a shuddering breath. Of all the stupid things he had done in his life, falling in love with Tony Stark had to be at least in the top three.
Natasha stood up and pushed her chair in, then leaned on the backrest.
“Liar,” grinned Tony. “You can’t wait to get me home for ninety-seven-off. After we sleep for 24 hours, anyway. And shower for two more. Also: food.
“Dramatic,” mumbled Steve.
"Your concern for my well being is heart warming, Captain. Especially since you're barely acknowledging my existence otherwise. Truly, the cockles of my heart are tickled pink, or something."
"Go right ahead, big boy. I'll stay with the horses." This shouldn't take too long anyway.
"I guess so." Steve drummed his fingers on the table. "I still need to find Bucky, though. I wish he would let me find him."
Tony tried not to smile too widely at that.
“Poor you,” Tony smirks.
"Um, Cap? I think you just came out on national television."
“Yeah, no. I'm sure my ego could take the dent, big as it is, but that's still not really something I'd enjoy.”
As he started coming down from his high, he felt Steve slam up one more time before moaning a broken "Tony!" into his ear and finding his own shuddering release. Boneless, they toppled over on the bed, a sweaty, sticky, panting mess, grinning stupidly at each other. Endorphins were the bomb.
Clint came over to look at what he had. "You got ten already."
"But you have so many of them, Tony, they've got to be a dime a dozen, tops."
"I am pretty sure I have sinned in ways you can not imagine, pal." Tony muttered and he was pleased to see Steve bite down on a smile. Meanwhile, Percival was gracefully thanking the hermit for his advice and asking for directions to Scunthorpe. Apparently, one did not simply walk directly to the Grail. Not without detours, anyway. Tony hoped fervently there weren't going to be that many of them, though. He was hiding it well, he thought, but the way the arc reactor was losing power was a constant source of worry and he really didn't have a year to spend on gallivanting around this backwards theme park.
"That'll do it," said Steve. When Tony looked at him questioningly, Steve raised an eyebrow as if Tony should know what he was talking about and that was ridiculous because nobody ever ignored Tony, not if he could help it any way. Not since his father--
Bucky shook his head. “Like hell,” he said bluntly. “If this is justice—”
“No, I’m the one who wants to do my job,” Tony interrupted, unfazed by the man’s nearness.
Rhodes turned to Steve, his eyes wide. “Bucky?” he asked, for verification.
“What other choice do I have?” Steve demanded, letting his arms fall to his sides as he strode forward.  Stopping himself before he could get any further than the side of his desk, any closer to the man behind it. “You’re the one who wants to convene a Grand Jury and—”
“I think you did.” Tony delivered the words calmly, dispassionately, so opposite from how they had just been wrapped around each other that Steve felt like his head was spinning. “I think you meant it and I think you were right to.”
For all his strength, he found himself weakened by the man in his arms. Rendered incapable of rational thought or action once Tony licked into his mouth and dug blunted fingertips into his side like he knew Steve might try and leave, never speaking of his again.
Steve shook his head. “It wasn’t unprovoked,” he said, his voice low.
Tony tasted warm, of earth and soap and fabric. He was also incredibly responsive, thrusting up with the slightest touch of Steve’s tongue to his straining flesh. It took the strategic placement of Steve’s hand on the dip of Tony’s waist to keep him in place long enough for his taste to turn into a consumption of all that earthen heat. It felt like a brand that lit him up from the inside out, only intensified by the sound of Tony’s long moan from above him.
“Because you would rather side with a criminal over justice,” Tony interrupted loudly. “Yeah, because of that, you and I can’t.”
The sound of traffic outside the window, Tony’s terrible talking paperweight digging into his palm and chirping its disapproval. The tender press of lips against his throat. That old thrill was still singing in his blood at volumes he’d never before experienced, making his skin prickle in heightened awareness and his knees threaten to buckle. If he could have, he might have chosen never to move from their embrace.  He would have made an entire lifetime on that desk if it meant keeping Tony close and in this warm glow forever.
“Go?” Steve repeated, hastening to follow Tony’s lead and get his clothes back in place, even if he had no intention of leaving. After all, while he had figured Tony wasn’t the type to need or want cuddling or breakfast after sex, Steve was still too much of a gentleman to just zip his pants up and walk away. “What do you mean, go?”
“Yes or no.”
Because he knew that this was a puzzle that Tony blamed himself for.
Then teeth sunk into the tender skin of his earlobe and he was lost.
? Something about that argument overturning a century of jurisprudence—”
“And it didn’t come out during voir dire?”
“Then, the passing of a titan. After Howard Stark’s tragic death, Tony Stark took over as partner at Stark, Ransom and Richards LLP. Expected to continue his father’s legacy of managing acquisitions and defending high-profile clients, Tony instead rejected that path, stepped down as partner at his father’s firm and became a prosecutor, putting the kind of people his father once defended behind bars and developing a reputation for pursuing justice above all. When he ran for District Attorney, Mr. Stark made police accountability a centerpiece of his campaign, making the Brock Rumlow case personal.”
Tony shook his head. “No,” he said quietly, tossing his pen on his desk before scrubbing a hand across his face. “Not against you.”
“I mean, go, leave, disappear, vamoose.” Tony waved a hand in the direction of his doorway.
Never a man known for his patience, Tony squirmed and pulled Steve standing again. Into the bracket of his thighs, where he could hold Steve close and kiss the taste of himself from Steve’s mouth with hardly a hesitation. Steve’s vision swam, his knees grew weak. He was certain he was hard enough to separate the zipper at his front but Tony felt the need to help anyway, jerking it roughly down and releasing hot flesh into his grasp.
Steve gaped at him. “A Grand Jury?” he demanded, incredulous. “You’re considering convening a Grand Jury?”
Steve’s lip curled in derision. “Oh, sure, it’s real easy to do your job when you’re big man behind a desk in your fancy suits all day.”
Steve lifted his chin, just slightly. “Yes.”
And he had never felt that more acutely than right now.
“He wasn’t harassing him,” Steve said exasperatedly. “Bucky just wanted to follow up—”
The day after he moved into the castle, he picked up his first witch.
"Of course I am, but I think he'd run if I asked him that."
He tilted his head at it and said: "Come on. Let's sit down with these."
"You know, it's really unhealthy to hold grudges like that."
"Steve, it isn't that I don't want you on the team. You'd be perfect. It's. It's just. You and me, it'd never work. You haven't seen me at my worst. You have no idea what you're getting into. I'm rude and obnoxious, I don't know how to deal with problems that can't be solved by building something or throwing money at it, I hide in my workshop because I am emotionally constipated, I don't eat, sleep or shower and then take things out on everyone else, I can't follow orders to save my life. Literally. I drive people nuts, Steve. I am a nightmare to put up with. It'd never work, you'd get sick of me so fast and then then whole situation would be... horrible." Tony had been staring at his hands the entire time he spoke. If he'd looked at Steve he'd never had been able to say anything except
"No, no! The movie thing where Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett are in the bow and.... Don't tell me you've never seen
"So," Tony starts, "what's for dinner, babydoll?"
"Where's your bed, Tony?"
“Yes, mom.” But Tony said it without his usual sarcasm. The bitterness from last night seemed to have worn itself out.
“That wouldn’t work. They know Rhodey. They know what he is and isn’t. You’re an unknown factor, they won’t know what to make of you. You’re the cog in the wheel! The sand in the sandwich! A big fat middle finger to pureblood arrogance!”
"Oh!" Cecilia looked taken aback, "well, when the light is on it is not much of a problem, because there is only a small part of the corridors accessible, and they will find us or another tour group, but in the dark it can be scary."
Draco discreetly pointed in Tony’s direction and Harry’s eyes followed. First they went comically wide and then he started grinning. He looked at Steve, who wished he could sink through the floor.
“Barnes took that away from these victims,” Tony said, jabbing a finger at the stack of casefiles on his desk. “And whatever else you may think, it’s not his place to play judge, jury and executioner. Brock Rumlow was unarmed, and your friend gunned him down.” He met Steve’s eyes. “You don’t get to stand here and call that justice.”
Turning, Tony looked at him through new eyes. Seeing something new to him, perhaps, though Steve had always been certain he was a terrible poker player and the way he felt about the prosecutor was etched into the slowly deepening creases of his eyes.
“It means Rumlow’s out on bail until the State decides if they want to try him again.”
Perhaps he should have been embarrassed at being felled so easily, but it wasn’t just any man bringing him to his knees — it was a man with his own corner in Steve’s mind, possibly in his heart. The heart beating like hell to get out of his chest and closer to Tony as he worked Steve over with a sure hand. Alternating between decadently rough and tantalizingly slow, tight and little more than a caress. It was driving him crazy, making his hips jolt and buck seemingly at random. Forever looking for a rhythm and unable to find it.
Tony’s expression tightened, even though Steve could read the resignation in his eyes. He had known that Steve wouldn’t agree.
“Jesus,” he murmured, breathless.
“That doesn’t matter—”
Tony pounded the rest of his drink before crossing back to his desk. “Interesting that you would say that, Captain,” he said, digging through his files before pulling the one he was apparently looking for out. “Because you told IAB that you told Sgt. Barnes to stay at the precinct. And that you never so much as issued an armed and dangerous warning on Rumlow.”
Then, abruptly, Tony turned back around. “Bump stock ban.”
“He’s not my boyfriend,” Steve sighed distractedly, though he eyed Bucky warily. “You ok, Buck?”
Tony buttoned the top buttons of his shirt and tightened his tie, moving it back into place, before unrolling his shirt sleeves, buttoning the cuffs with nimble fingers. “I’m talking about what hasn’t changed. I’m talking about Sgt. Barnes being indicted for murder. I’m talking about you lying under oath. And how much more complicated all of that would be if you and I were sleeping with each other.”
NYPD Captain Steve Rogers leaned back in his desk chair, tempted to prop his feet up on his desk like his favorite prosecutor was wont to do, but his rigid training from his time in the Army wouldn’t quite let him. Not in the workplace, at least, though he had been known to put his feet up on the coffee table at home from time to time.
“He needs help!” Steve snapped. “He needs a lot of help, and he’s not going to find that in jail. And whatever you may think, sending him there doesn’t get justice for anyone.”
“Yes.”
“I mean, if you had answers, I’d take ‘em,” Steve said. “But I’m not the one who’s going to have the NYPD brass breathing down his neck.”
It had been three days since Steve had seen Tony, since they had gotten the call, but it felt like years. He hated to admit it, because it wasn’t like they were dating, it wasn’t like he had any right to, but he had missed him. As he had sat through numerous meetings with Internal Affairs and the Commissioner’s office, the only thing he had wanted to do was text Tony, or stop by his office, or something.
"Me," Tony blurted. "Well, not me in the literal sense," he continued before Steve could make a hooker joke. And he would, but it would be a horribly awkward one and Tony couldn't handle that level of adorkable while he was stone cold sober. "We’re selling Tony Stark products that aren't weapons. They're a hard sell when that's all you're known for."
"Sure." Tony knew he sounded odd, but he was doing a pretty good job considering that he felt like the world had just tilted on its axis.
“I see.” Nothing changed in the elf’s expression but Steve could have sworn Jarvis was surprised. It made him a tad uneasy.
“Yes. Stupidly so.”
"How? Find an airport?"
Tony’s extremely witty retort was lost in the scuffle of chairs, when everyone stood up for the entry of some Military bigwigs, Steve and Rhodey. Steve was wearing a cheap suit, and not the military uniform that he’d worn when Tony had testified, and Tony didn’t know if that meant anything and that was frustrating as all get out. Steve’s eyes scanned the crowd and as they landed on Tony a little bit of the tension went out of his shoulders.Tony pulled himself together and smiled at him encouragingly.
