"Before you fuck me? Come on, you're a big boy, you were swearing up a storm earlier." Tony giggled as Steve glared at him. "Put some on your fingers and you stick 'em inside me. After that, everything else is black and white."
"Good morning to you, too, Stark. Just decided to cook everybody some breakfast." She replied. She turned off the stove and placed the bacon onto the plate, nestling up next to the eggs. She grabbed the plate and the glass of orange juice and held them out for him to take. "I was going to have JARVIS tell you that I made you breakfast, but since you're already here, might as well join the rest of us." He smiled and took the plate and glass from her, making his way over to the table and sitting down at the end of the table next to Bruce, who smiled at him as he sat down.
"Oh God, Tony do that again, please!" Steve begged, his breathing ragged and his voice needy. The genius smirked.
After the shopping mall, Tony decided to do something less extravagant. A simple walk down the street towards his favorite Italian restaurant would suffice. He watched as the super soldier's eyes roved the sidewalks, watched as the cars passed by, the wind jostling his hair in different directions, if anything he thought Steve was having fun, or rather, he was excited. He happily let Steve hit his arm a few times and let him talk about the old days from 1940's Brooklyn, where the movies theaters used to be dance halls, and all the fancy restaurants used to be a place where you could drive your car, park in the parking lot and just relax with your friends while listening to classical music and rollerblading. There was a small warmth flowing through Tony's chest at how giddy Steve was, but he wouldn't say out loud just how adorable he thought the blonde was, no those feelings wouldn't be brought up anytime soon, or so he hoped.
"You hungry?" He asked. Of course, Steve was hungry, but he didn't want to voice that thought to the man in front of him. Too many thoughts ran through his head, and how he so desperately wanted to reach out and pull Tony close, wanting to feel his body against his, tell him how sorry he was and that he wishes they could start all over again, that he could make up for what he did. But he didn't say anything, he just sat there, empty blank blue eyes staring at his form.
The dinner table was already set, the food was already done cooking and all that was left was to serve it. He wanted to make something fancy for tonight, but he decided against that and just made something plain and simple. Spaghetti with garlic bread was about as plain and simple as he wanted it to be, he'd do the more fancy stuff later. Or maybe, he should've done it tonight considering today was the day he was going to ask Tony out. Ugh, there was so much going on inside of his head that he almost forgot to take the garlic bread out of the oven, nearly burning it.
"Were you the one who saved him?" He asked, looking at her intensely. She nodded her head as she stood up, dusting the snow off her thigh-high black dress. "I swear to god if you're one of those things and you're just messing with my head I'm going to-".
"You're right birdbrain, but I stayed up all night with Capsicle. It was a rough night for the guy." Tony admitted, stabbing his eggs with his fork and bringing them to his mouth. Wanda hummed in response, a small nod of her head for confirmation. The chair next to Clint was soon occupied by Natasha, who only had a cup of coffee to accompany her.
While the words "I love you" are typically said between a couple, and generally in the simplest terms means exactly what it says, the words themselves hold a special power. The simple phrase of "I love you" when said to a friend is much different from that of when said to a lover; for that which saying those words to a friend can mean a simple "thank you", or a "words cannot express how much you mean to me". In the context of saying it to a significant other, they are those most beautiful sets of words in a sentence someone can say. "I love you" is in the context of "you are the one I want to spend the rest of my life with", or rather "there's no one else but you". This is what it means to him because love is very different for everyone and it cannot be the same for everyone. Everyone's definition of love is different, and for him, it comes with knowing that your heartbeat so quickly for one person, and your palms get sweaty, you find yourself nervous and stutter a lot- which is ironic because he actually has a condition that makes him stutter- and you generally want to get to know this person more. He never thought that after Peggy, someone who he did indeed have feelings for and loved deeply, despite not ever saying the words to her, that he would ever find love with anyone else.
That killed him heavily on the inside, but on the outside, he tried not to show it. He knows that Steve's an artist, he's seen all the drawings, and he knows how much this will kill the super-soldier. He won't be able to draw, and he knows that drawing is one of Steve's most favorite things to do. It gives him tranquillity, peace of mind from the stress their lives have been given, hell, it even gives him peace from the genius when he's being just a tad more annoying than usual. Not being able to use his eye for drawing is like Tony not being able to use his hands for tinkering. And it's even more shitty that he has to be the one to tell Steve when he wakes up.
"I love you," Steve whispered, thumb brushing over Tony's lips, pulling his bottom lip low enough to see his teeth. He struggled to lean upwards, wanting to feel those lips on his once more. The genius met him halfway, already getting the message. His heart was on fire, but not out of pain because that implies that what's happening right now is hurting him. No, it was a fire of passion, making his heartbeat just a little faster as he enjoyed Steve's soft lips against his, how he enjoyed the way the soldier bit his bottom lip and pulled back at the same time, letting go and watching his bottom lip bounce for a few seconds before becoming still. "So beautiful."
And Tony, his sweet, supportive, understanding Tony was doing everything he could to be there for him. He kept telling him that it was going to be ok after he came back from therapy, graciously waiting just outside the room for him to be done. He hugged him, kissed his cheek, kept promising that no matter what they'll get through this together. And Steve, well he believed him, but he also just offered a small smile, a lazy hug, or a sad nod and walked away from him, and each time Tony didn't follow.
"Because I l-love you. And you're s-so p-perfect." It made the other male smile warmly, looking down at the placement of Steve's hand on top of his own.
There were no more words needed between the two as they held onto each other. The day carried on and everything was peaceful. Somewhere along the way, when the rays of the setting sun turned from an orangish hue to pure white of the rising moon, the two closed their eyes, bodies pressed gently together, smiles on their face as they slept. And while the rays of the rising sun slipped through the cracks of Steve's bedroom window, waking up both occupants, they continued to lay there, smiles on their face and just thankful that after all of the dangerous things they've gone through, they were finally back in each other's arms, and they couldn't be happier.
"Alright, so fill us in and then we'll fill you in on what you missed in the past two hours," Clint spoke, sitting next to him, getting comfortable.
"Got nothing to say? To me, obviously, since you're able to talk to them with no problem!" His voice started to rise a tad bit. He clenched his jaw, curled his hands into fists, and steeled his expression, trying to act as if what the genius is saying doesn't affect him in the slightest, even if his vision is getting just a tad bit blurrier by the second. "Ya know, I kinda think I like you not speaking. I don't have to hear your pathetic excuses of why the fuck you think, that talking to anybody that isn't me is right. I've been working my ass off to help you, and this is how you repay me? Maybe you should stay like this, it's for the better." And it's those words that make him leave in anger, in anguish.
"Thank you, T'Challa. It means a lot." Tony said. And how sweet it was for Tony to tell T'Challa what was on his mind because sometimes, the genius just knew what he was thinking and what he wanted to say.
He thought to himself. Yes life was very strange for Tony, he got the Arc Reactor in his chest from a cave in Afghanistan, thanks to a terrorist organization known as the Ten Rings, made the first Iron Man suit, dated Pepper, mutually broke up with Pepper; well more of less she broke up with him, but it hurt less to say they did it mutually. He really couldn't blame her, and despite the break up they were still best friends, he's just glad she's happy and understands that his life is too dangerous for her, and she'd rather feel safe, or at the very least not have to worry about whether Tony is going to die or not. He gets it, he really does, but it still hurts a little to this very day. If only he were different, or better, or maybe even-
It's a fickle thing, really; people either live without it, whether they're starved of it from parents, or a loved one, or simply because it's their own personal choice and a way of life to stay away from being so close to another person, and some crave it like a drug. Essentially that's what some consider love; a drug you end up addicted to, maybe like cocaine or heroin, but not as extreme and only leaves you with a broken heart rather than dead in the ground.
"Do you wanna tell us about it?" Bruce chimed in. He stared at his plate for a few seconds before turning his gaze onto his teammates, who looked at him and waited patiently for his answer. He didn't exactly know where to start; there were a lot of things to say really, but trying to create a sentence was proving to be a difficult task. Should he start with what happened in the lab, or should he try to express how annoyed, frustrated, and perturbed he truly felt. Should he talk about how fucked his relationship is now, and how downright unfair it was? Should he not mention those things at all, and just label it off as nothing? He could feel a wave of word vomit scratching at his throat, climbing its way out, and before he knew it, that's when all the words just came pouring out.
The scalpel falls from my hands, and my body dips forward towards the ground. Instead of being met with hard ground, I felt arms wrap around me. With what little consciousness I had, I could see the girl from earlier, Wanda, her face full of concern and worry, and a hint of fear. She put my arm around her shoulder, keeping my body upright as she started to walk forward.
"Steve..." Tony said weakly. The soldier gave all of his attention to the dying man in his arms, eyes glassy with unshed tears, one hand holding Tony while the other grabbed his hand, lacing their fingers together. His head rested in Steve's lap, letting him look at the crying soldier above him.
He stood up off of his stool, and the first step he took was met with wobbly legs, causing him to hold onto his desk for dear life.
"Stop!" I yelled. Everything faded and I found myself back in the chair, Wanda standing off to the side, a smile on her face, and Tony, sitting in my lap with a huge grin on his face. I was panting, my head snapping in every direction, eyes trembling, wide and filled with panic. I felt my hair being pulled, my head snapping back and looking up, Tony's eyes staring back at me as he towered over me.
A flash of scarlet filigree fluttered past my eyesight, and I felt myself slowly slip away. My body relaxed against the chair and the scene before me changed, Tony and Wanda fading away in the background as I looked down at myself. The binds holding me to the chair were gone, and the wounds I suffered seemed to have disappeared as well. I looked up and studied my surroundings, and it suddenly hit me as to where I am.
"I love you, too, Tony," Steve whispered back, kissing the side of Tony's head. And he, too, smiled at the fact that Steve had chosen him, loved him for who he was and not what he possessed; didn't care how wealthy he was, or how intelligent he was, because to Steve he was just a human who deserved to be loved like everybody else.
"You can ask about it, but I don't wanna talk about my father. Asshole never did anything good for me in my life, so I have nothing good to say about him. I would also like to not ruin your good image of him."
"Boss," Friday's voice cut through the silence, "there seems to be a mass quantity of vehicles approaching the perimeter of the compound."
He hears booted footsteps coming close to his location, and he takes his hands away from his face to see Natasha, with her short blonde hair, straight posture, and all-black jumpsuit that hugs her body perfectly, coming over to him.
"That's for Steve." He spat. The creature simply chuckled darkly and smirked, looking Tony dead in the eye.
"Tony," Bruce's calm voice reached his ears, his gaze locking on the good doctor who had a small smile on his face, "we're Avengers. We get into dangerous situations all the time. They come after you, or any of us, they come after all of us. We're here for you, and we're gonna stay by your side. Trust us." He sighed and looked at his teammates. They stood there, eyes fixated on him, small smiles on their face. Bruce was right, they were in this together and the stress and anger Tony felt was slowly starting to dwindle.
The way his lips moved perfectly against Steve's, how the soldier moved his hand from his cheek to the back of his head, deepening the kiss, it just felt so perfect. If it wasn't for the fact that Steve's life is on the line, it might've been more perfect, but they forgot about it for just this
And he laughs bitterly at himself. Those were the same words he told Tony, and he now knows how he felt when he told Tony that they'd win or lose together. And right now, he felt like a loser. He felt like he not only lost his eyesight, or his ability to speak, or his life, but he lost the most important thing to him- the love of his life.
how everything turned out to be. Why did it have to be Steve? Why couldn't it have been me?" Nobody said anything, they just looked at him with sad smiles on their faces. They understand where he was coming from; without any hesitation, they would have taken his place in a heartbeat, even Wanda, who was the part of the cause as to why Steve is the way he is. "I can't touch him, if I try to he flinches from me. If I try to come anywhere near him he whimpers and flinches, he thinks I told him that if he loves me he should kill himself for me; which, by the way, he almost did. How do I handle that? I mean, he came down to the lab and we've made some progress, but things are never going to be the same for Steve and me, hell, things are never going to be the same for Steve. I just wanna bubble wrap him and protect him, but that's a horrible idea."
"T-Thank y-you." He stutters. Bucky and Nat just smile, and they don't force him to say anything else, and he's ok with that. He joins them on the couch, just forgetting about his problems, forgetting about his inner turmoil, forgetting what troubled him just for this moment to enjoy the only ounce of peace he's gotten in a while.
kissing him. He pulled back and rested his head against Steve's, their noses touching only slightly, and big bright smiles plastered on their faces. They both panted for air, neither letting each other go as they enjoyed the little space between them.
Steve turns his head to look at Tony, and it's hard for him to make out what he's seeing. It's all blurry and blob-like. What he can make out through his right eye, he can't put into words. He sees Tony perfectly through his left, sitting there with tear-stained cheeks and a sad smile on his face, but through his right eye he cannot make out the genius features. There's also this irritating little white spot that he has to blink multiple times to get away, and when it's there it makes the genius appear milky; as if, instead of blurry, he has cloudy vision. He hopes that this isn't temporary, because he doesn't know how he'll cope if he can't see Tony properly with both eyes, or if he can't draw either.
To the genius it was surreal in a way; the first time he'd been in a hospital- or rather a hospital-like situation that involves surgery, because a cave in Afghanistan is most definitely not a hospital, he was the one being operated on and received a makeshift plate in his chest that was powered by a car battery. He was then in another hospital situation where he had surgery done on him to remove the shrapnel from his chest, which was the same day he finally stopped having to rely on the Arc Reactor to keep him alive- but that very day birth experimentation to find a replacement Arc Reactor since he felt way too naked without the contraption on his chest. In a way, the Arc Reactor became a part of him, relatively speaking because, well, it
"H-He kept asking me where you were and I... I-I couldn't tell him that. I wasn't going to tell him where you were. S-so, then he put the collar around me and shocked me, b-but then it got worse." Tony paused for a few seconds, closing his eyes and biting his lip as fresh tears spilled from his tear ducts and down his cheek, staining his pants with small water droplets. "When the collar wasn't e-enough to make me talk h-he..." And it was painful for him to talk about it because he sobbed again, gasping for breath.
Realistically he should stop with the whole blaming himself thing, but he couldn't always help taking full responsibility for what he did. He also wasn't going to succumb to self-deprivation because while he does take responsibility for what he has done, he still doesn't fully regret what he did. He desired to help his best friend because Bucky has always been there for him, and maybe this was his chance at redemption when he failed to be there for Bucky when he was dangling off the side of a train, his life literally hanging in the balance of all things. He wasn't going to suppress or dissuade what he did, because then he'd just be lying to him. But, looking at the broken down, self-deprecating, self-destructive, former confident, snarky, all-around most interesting man he's ever met, he's been consumed by guilt.
When his tongue protrudes from his mouth and licks the hot sensation on his neck where his teeth just were, does his body shiver again, but this time it's much more violent. The hot sensation of his teeth against his neck, mixed in with his breath that soon is replaced by the cold, wet sensation of his tongue sets his body into overload and he all but moans out the soldier's name in response.
That's where things took a turn. It was when that blonde, blue-eyed beauty named Steve Rogers started entering his lab, with promises of food and coffee, but only if he came out of his lab and slept like a proper human being. It was a trap, which is what he first thought of in his mind when the soldier started pestering him and refusing to leave, standing his ground and even going so far as to drag Tony away from his tinkering much like Pepper used to. In a way, Steve was Tony's Pepper, and maybe at the time he thought with their growing friendship or, relationship, it was all too confusing for him at the time, that maybe he might be Steve's Peggy. But Peggy was soft, with a steely, no shits given attitude she carried with her everywhere. She was calculating, clear-minded, intelligent, and Tony, well he for sure was intelligent and calculating, but also the opposite of Peggy. He was reckless, self-destructive, always putting up metaphorical masks where his face is and walls where his heart was to protect himself from letting someone get too close. It worked wonders for him until Steve tore down everything he worked for.
"My powers are very strong, and they bring out the worst thoughts in a person's mind. I'm not even sure I could get into his mind to bring forth any good thoughts he might be suppressing." She explained.
Suddenly, a bright light flickered right above him, finally letting him see the expanse of the room he was in.
He inched his way towards the back of the bed, pulling back one of the pillows and dipping his hand between the bed and the frame, fingers brushing over a hardcover. He retracted his hand and held Steve's sketchbook in his hand.
"Do you have a plan?" Steve spoke softly. Tony opened his mouth to speak, but upon looking into Steve's eyes, he closed his mouth. He took the time to not just stare into those ocean eyes of his, but he really got a look at how Steve was feeling. He wasn't kidding when he said that Steve's eyes convey all his emotions; like a mirror would portray not just your reflection back at you, because beyond that it shows your soul through your eyes at how you're truly feeling. He also wasn't kidding when he said that Steve wears his heart on his sleeves, not so much like a medal you would let everyone else see, because that's not what Steve's heart was to Tony, it was a precious little gem he wanted to care for, to protect and let only his eyes see how bright it truly was. It's not that he was mesmerized by his eyes; which of course Tony usually was, but this time he saw the little strands of emotion, the bits, and pieces Steve wanted to lock away, but his eyes betrayed him.
Eventually, the recording is finished and stored on the flash drive, and then next comes the information on Ross, as well as a digital copy of the accords. He'll read everything later, but for now, he has to get out of here. He retrieves the flash drive once everything is fixed, shoving it into his pocket as quickly as he can.
"Yes, Steve, you have." Tony was no idiot, obviously, he was a genius on many standards even far greater than just math and science. It probably didn't take a genius to see that Steve was having a difficult time still adjusting to his new life, and the way he carried himself through the tower, well, Tony could obviously see he wasn't happy. "From the moment you entered the tower, I've only ever seen you smile once, and that was when I made you your room."
"That I am not sure of either. However, if they were able to get their hands on some of our weapons, then they might have infiltrated HQ disguised as someone else."
"I bet 50 bucks that you'd be the one to ask Steve out, and Nat bet Steve would be the one to do it."
It kills him so deep on the inside like a knife was just embedded into his chest and it's slowly being dragged downwards, creating unbearable pain and tension in his chest that he can't breathe. He hates the fact that Steve is so scared, and he's begging the genius to help him, but he doesn't know how.
Tony is an inventor, and without the use of his hands what can he possibly do? A genius's biggest tool besides their hand is their mind, and the hands they have are the extra tools they use to craft such amazing inventions and ideas. Without the use of his hands, what's the point in being a genius if one of your greatest tools is broken.
do anything like that to you. I love you, Steve. I'm willing to start all over again and take this at
Regardless, he felt happier, in a way. He stopped thinking about all the negatives that happened, and just only cared about the man he loved sleeping peacefully. Tomorrow, Tony was willing to at least make some sort of attempt at talking to Steve, but truthfully he knew that tomorrow things would most likely be different because life can be unexpected. For now, he was just going to accept that tonight, he at least made some sort of progress.
"You look like shit, too." Tony joked. Clint groaned as pain coursed through his body, a hand gently pushing him back down as he tried to sit up properly.
"Thanks, Tony." The genius smiled back at him, nodding his head and grabbing his mug from its place next to him. He chugged his own coffee down within a matter of minutes, earning himself another cup before starting to walk away from the area, most likely to finish up repairs on his Iron Man suit. The super soldier looked around and realized how empty it became once Tony left, and the small smile on his face shortly turned into a frown. He looked down at the half-empty mug, dumping out the rest of the contents before setting the mug back into the shelf from once it came after he washed it of course.
"Peggy was very special to me, I loved her very much. She had this fiery personality about her that just attracted me to her, and I wanted to hold her and cherish her. When we kissed I wanted to kiss her again and I was ready to spend my life with her. You," he trailed off, looking Tony straight in the eye, smiling brightly and giving a low chuckle before speaking again, "you're special, too. I like the way you ramble, I could listen to you for hours and not tell you to shut up. I like that we have things in common, and I like that despite the facade you put on for everybody else, deep down inside you have a heart made of gold, and you care about people. If only people actually knew the real you that I do, they would see what I see." The smile on Tony's face reached his eyes, and it did something to Steve. He wanted to see it more, and the thought intrigued him. Tony was different compared to Peggy, but there were also some similarities. Where Peggy had wavy brown hair that rested gently on her shoulders, soft to the touch, Tony's hair was a little more curly, mixed with oil grease due to working in the lab for countless days and nights. Where Peggy was graceful, mixed in with a fiery personality and hands also soft and gentle to the touch, Tony was more flamboyant, sarcastic, loud, and cunning, his hands were calloused and rough, but Steve didn't mind that.
His footsteps felt heavy, his heartbeat was loud in his ear, his eyelids closing slowly, his breathing shallow. Why was he feeling like this? Why was his body reacting like this? His head turned slowly to look at his surroundings, everything seemed so far away, out of reach. He blinked a few times, stumbling over his own feet, causing him to lean against a wall to steady himself. He pushed himself off the wall, body swaying, sweat cascading down the side of his face, his hands touched the cold metal of the door that led him into the medical room. Gasps were heard, but black spots started dancing around his vision as someone rushed over to him.
He smiled at the AI's courtesy, Steve always appreciated how courteous Tony's AI was despite his creator being the complete opposite. He sighed and got up from his bed, his legs wobbly putting him off-balanced just a bit.
But then suddenly the door to his room opens, but he doesn't think anything of it. It's when he smells the sizzling crispy bacon, and sees the half blurry, half-clear, short, and slightly muscular build of his favorite brunette walk through the door with a plate of bacon, eggs, pancakes lightly drizzled in syrup, and two pieces of buttered toast resting gently on the eggs, accompanied by a cup of orange juice, did he think that maybe he didn't dream that the brunette was in his room. Maybe this time he actually was in his room and got up early to make him breakfast.
"You can take me into custody if you really want to, but right now his life is more important. We need to hurry." He nodded his head and started walking back the way they came, meeting his teammates along the way. They saved the questions for later, their main goal was to get Steve on the Quinjet and back to S.H.I.E.L.D. medical.
"Wait." Tony suddenly said, panting as he pulled back from the kiss. "Are you sure you wanna do this? We can wait if you-"
He looked down at the sleeping form of Steve, whose head was rested neatly and gently in his lap, a small smile on his face. His fingers flowed through his blonde locks as he slept, making sure the soldier was as comfortable as he could be. It was a breakthrough that Steve was willing to let Tony get this close to him despite all that has happened, but it was even more touching that he trusted that Tony wouldn't hurt him. Of course, there was still going to be tension; though it's very understandable and Tony is willing to accept that. Things are not going to be the same in their relationship, despite knowing that he's with the real Tony, the trauma he experienced with the doppelganger is too much to forget. It's detrimental, is what it is, but these are the sacrifices Tony is willing to make; he's willing to take things slow and work his way up to get Steve to trust him completely again, of course, it's not fair to him, but he's not going to push Steve into anything he isn't comfortable with. He's somewhat ok with him flinching if Tony hugs him, or makes any advances on touching him, he's going to have to work on accepting that maybe Steve might not be as affectionate, but that's ok, these things take time.
The scene before him resembled the sight he saw when he flew that nuke into the portal; Chitauri leviathans and soldiers littered in the starry sky around him, flying towards the portal that led towards Earth. And there, right in front of him, he watched himself gaze into the figures of his dead teammates, their bodies nothing more than decorations on the cold hard ground. He watched himself relive his nightmare, watched himself break down as his eyes gazed upon Steve. The blonde lay there motionless, his shield cut in half, blood trickling out of his nose as his eyes stared upwards, locking with Tony's. He felt himself start to tear up as the scene faded before his eyes, and soon enough he was back in his lab, Wanda and Steve looking at him. He smirked slightly, "did you enjoy the show?"
He waits, and waits, and waits, but he never shows, and once again he thinks he's to blame. That somehow in the grand scheme of things it's all his fault. Even as his eyes flutter shut, and his cheeks and sheets are stained with his tears, he continues to wait, and wait, and wait.
"How do I look, punk?" Bucky said, smirking at him. He was dressed in all black, from a black vest he wore over a tight skinned black shirt and black army pants. His semi-short black hair stopped at the top half of his neck, just like he remembered when he first saw him as the Winter Soldier. His metal arm complimented all the black he wore, and he was glad he was on their side this time because he looked like he was dressed to kill.
"We just arrived. Black Widow and Hawkeye are about to land this thing. We'll meet you-". An explosion sounded in Tony's ear where Steve's voice used to be, causing his eyes to widen and a chill to go down his spine.
As he looked around the room, even towards the desk he found no breakfast, but instead his sketchbook sitting there neatly. He doesn't know what he's supposed to expect, but realistically he expected some sort of affectionate good morning, but instead was just met with no Tony, no food, nothing really except what he already owned or was given in this room. It brought down his mood as he sat up, eyes focused on the silver, cold tiles his feet were resting on.
"Oh... Hey, Cap." Tony said awkwardly. Why was he here? Why was he awake at this time? No, that was a stupid thing to question, but he shouldn't be here, he should still be in his lab. "Uh... Sorry, I'll just go." He opened his mouth to try and say something, anything to get the genius to stay, which in return caused Tony to stop and wait for him to speak, but nothing came out. He watched a hurtful expression across Tony's face, making its way to his eyes. He walked towards Steve to get past him, and he had tears in his eyes as he heard the small whimper and saw the small flinch when he came within proximity to the soldier.
He could feel something soft against his back; whether it was silk or cotton, or any other form of material, he didn't know, but as his senses came back to him, and he could feel the material against the few inches of exposed skin on his forearm- which was to him weird at first until he noticed that the cuffs he once wore were no more, and he confirmed it to himself that he was on a bed of some sort if the sheet he concluded to himself was anything to go by.
"You like that?" Steve whispered seductively into his ear, causing Tony to nod his head and moan again. "You like the way I touch you like this? Only I get to do this, right?"
"That he would need me to tell you guys all about how they work. He knows he doesn't own me, right?"
"No, it was a lot different than that. I was a little girl when I first learned of the name Stark. I was only ten years old in Sokovia, eating dinner with my family, laughter, and smiles filling the table. Then that same fateful day, it all changed." He watched as she inhaled a shaky breath, her footsteps slowing as she spoke again. "A mortar shell hit my family's building, killing my mother and my father. All I had left that day was my brother as we hid under our bed while the building around us crumbled. That's when another shell entered through the window, it read "Stark Industries" on the side, and I thought we were going to die too, but it never went off. We counted the days, waiting for you to kill us, but we were saved."
"Well you'd think with all my money and my smarts people would want to be my friend. Actually, it's pretty funny, because even today people only like me for my superior intellect and my money, but getting back to the topic at hand," he cleared his throat and placed his now empty plate on the nightstand next to the mug before continuing, "I was the smallest kid in my class, and people took advantage of that. I spent a lot of my days being pushed around, shoved into lockers, people really despised me for being smart. Hell, even the teachers did because I would always correct them when they said something stupid."
"Mr. Stark, we need you to come down to S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ right away." Fury's voice boomed. He looked behind him and saw Steve stir slightly.
"Earth to Steve." He blinked and turned his gaze on the genius, who chuckled as he looked at him. "Guess the coffee maker wins." He grabbed a mug from the top cabinets littered on the walls, placing the mug under the coffee machine, pressing his pointer finger on one button, and watching as his cup filled to the brim with dark liquid. Steve swore his scowl deepened, and his suspicion was confirmed when he saw the genius look at him with a questioning gaze, one eyebrow raised. "Did you want to go first?"
"Don't worry about it, I can always just infect Fury's little organization with viruses that'll take him years to get rid of. Actually," he looked off to the side, his lips slowly curling upwards into a sinister smile, his eyes sparkling with mischief, "that doesn't sound like a bad idea at the moment."
The hatred, once a roaring flame that crackled and popped in his heart with bright and hungry hues of orange mixed in with a touch of yellow, diminished to a white and sullen, satiated stature. It was like the hatred he had never existed, and the love that was so microscopic, the size of an amoeba, started to grow just slightly inside, harvesting the flame of hatred that was now white into a sort of light pinkish color- and oh God does he feel everything coming back to him and how he hates it. How he hates falling for this man who has hurt him on such a deep emotional level that he cannot function properly without him. He craves Steve's touch and all the soft words of reassurance, all the proud looks in his eyes, and the long, loving gazes he always gave, accompanied by the most perfect smile that showed off his perfect white teeth.
"Well, with a tower full of superheroes who care for each other, do you really think we'd let you hurt Steve? Well, let you hurt Steve again, for that matter?" Bruce did have a point, they'd all be on his ass about why he hurt the blonde. Shit, just Natasha visiting him alone and asking him what he did, without killing him was enough for him to realize that if he did fuck up again, it would be more than just Natasha having a word with him. He isn't quite sure if the big guy would be up to talking.
"It's cute knowing that we have a dishwasher that you could use rather than watching you hand washing things. I guess you really like to remember those old days still, hmm?"
"You sure," Steve questioned, taking his seat across from Tony, "I feel like it's too plain. I really feel like I should've made you steak, or lobster, or some sort of Italian dish."
Before he knows it he reaches the door and the wall slides sideways, revealing the metal door behind it. He touches the cold metal knob, hand resting there. He sighs heavily before carefully, ever so slowly pushing the door open.
"That means a lot to me, Tony, thank you. If I may ask, what brought about this sudden urge to apologize?"
"What's going on in that pretty little head of yours, Stark?" Clint's soft voice reached his ears. He moved back and let himself lay sideways on the stretcher, staring at the empty one across from him that Nat was brought on earlier in the day. He didn't want to tell them what was going on inside his head, it was nothing but chaos going on in there. He groaned in frustration and clicked his teeth, frustration turning into irritation as he let out an angry huff of breath. His foot started to shake a little bit and his eyes started scanning the room, looking at anything except his teammates.
"Breakfast in bed. I got up pretty early to make some food for you. Well, food for everybody, but mostly you." He walked over to the bed and placed the mug down on the nightstand near Tony, handing him the plate which the genius happily took.
That's realistically what Tony was more scared of- not being able to hold his lover's hand because he couldn't curl his fingers. It was such a simple gesture, but it spoke so much inside his own head, and the thought of being incapacitated and not performing that action scared him.
The world went black, and the only thing Tony heard in his ear was static, where Steve's beautiful voice used to be.
I would never trade what we have for anything in the world. You've stuck by me through thick and thin, and I will always do the same for you. I see a life with you, and I'm willing to go through everything and anything with you. So," he trailed off, opening the box to reveal a black ring with a silver band wrapped around the middle, a white star that was cut down the middle due to the silver band, "will you marry me?"
"Anything seems out of the ordinary?" Tony asked as he heard the creak of metal from their comms. He swore as softly as he could when red words that said "DENIED" came into his vision. This must be one heavily encrypted code for him to not be able to break it this easily, but he wasn't going to give up.
"I'm sorry." A cold feminine voice laced with venom spoke into the room, and only then did he realize while he didn't feel anything. His eyes were still open, looking into the beautiful brunette locked away inside the cell, and he realized that he was still alive. He looked over his shoulder and saw Ross, clutching the area where his heart was, blood trickling from the wound and staining his hand in crimson, his body hunched over just slightly. "Did I step on your moment?"
"Cap! Cap, please answer me!" He pleaded. There was no answer, just pure static coming into his ear. He grits his teeth, first in anger, then in anguish. His eyes wouldn't leave the destroyed vehicle the others used to get here, because that's where Steve was, that's where his team was, and he watched as they fell to their doom.
"Ooh, fuck!!" Tony yelled, closing his eyes and gritting his teeth in pain. Holy shit Steve was stretching him out badly, even after he prepped him too. "Don't you dare pull all the way out." He warned the soldier. He felt the blonde stay still, stopping himself from pulling out all the way. Tony opened one of his eyes, gazing into concerned blue ones. "Ok, ok... You can move now." He said after he got adjusted. Steve intertwined their fingers before he slowly pushed back in. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's neck, his legs finding their place around his waist, his head burrowed into his shoulder. The pain slowly started to turn into pleasure as Steve continued to bury himself inside Tony, a moan laced with pleasure hitting his ear as the super-soldier buried his entire length inside of him.
The ride was long, but he didn't care because he held Steve's hand all the way to S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ, placing soft kisses on the back of his hand, as well as rubbing it with his thumb. The ride was long, but the operation they took him to was longer, and it just brought forth all the panic, all the terror, all the negative emotions he was suppressing when he was kissing Steve.
"No, you're wrong." He slowly lifted his eyes to meet the trembling brown ones of the genius, his own eyes null void of any emotion. "Captain America is nothing but a persona, he's not an actual person. Steve Rogers, he's an actual person. A genuine, selfless, down-to-earth person, who is 10 times better than I will ever be. And anybody who ever uses you just because you're Captain America, they're a piece of shit." There was a hint of a smile on Steve's face, and the dark blue that clouded his eyes turned a tint brighter. It made Tony feel good inside, he also realizes that he doesn't feel as emotionally introverted when it comes to Steve. He still feels it, don't get him wrong, but it's just not as strong.
shouldn't be classified. If that were the case, then Tony would have already had the data present for him to relay to the others.
"I can just see the fear written all over you. Why don't I help magnify that fear by giving you a first-hand experience of what the mind stone can really do?" He was too scared to move, he watched as the scepter moved closer to his face, a blinding yellow light staring at him in the face until he willed his eyes shut. Specs of white and black danced around behind his closed eyelids until they suddenly stopped, but when he opened his eyes, everything was different.
"Oh please, Rogers. Did you actually think he cared about you? He brought you here the first time, and he brought you here the second time to meet your end. How else do you think I knew you were at the compound? He played you, Rogers. And you couldn't see past any of that."
"What you're wearing now is fine, just follow me, but close your eyes." He said, already grabbing his hand and leading him towards the exit of his lab. He didn't really have much to say, so he just shrugged his shoulders and closed his eyes, trusting the super soldier to be his eyes while he's temporarily blind.
"So far it's just like the last time. Nothing for miles, dead silence, the only thing different is that it's cold." Natasha relayed the information. "We're coming up on a structure that looks pretty abandoned, it's like a bunker or castle, or something like that."
More than that, however, he wanted Steve to suffer, which is why he did what he did. He made Steve come over under pretense, only for him to have gotten locked up. The fucked up part about it all, besides the fact that he knew he betrayed Steve and saw the destroyed look in his eyes, was that he actually
"I was only gone for a few minutes, babe." The soldier chuckled at his response, shaking his head and continuing to smile, blue eyes staring into brown ones.
"Why would I need to worry about Capsicle? He's safe at home with Wanda." The way the smirk never faltered from the creature unnerved Tony, and he could see the other knew it was too as its smirk grew.
"You... You told me I was weak. You hurt me." Tony swallowed the lump in his throat, listening to every word Steve told him about what he dealt with back at the bunker with the fake copy of himself. "You made her," he pointed at Wanda, "look into my mind and made me relieve all these horrible things I wanted to forget. You told me that if I loved you... I would kill myself for you." He gasped loudly, a feeling of nausea creeping its way upwards. Those sick bastards took advantage of Steve when he was down and out of his mind, and to make matters worse, they tried to make him kill himself, and he thinks that Tony was the one who- oh god, he understands everything. That's why he's having a hard time trying to be anywhere near him.
"Well, he went on his mission with Nat and Clint, and I know you've been a little happier than usual. Even Steve's been happier than usual. So, I'm curious if there's more to this than just hanging out because the last time Steve's been this happy is when we were hanging out for movie night."
"Just wondering if you're free later. I have something in mind if you're up for it." He didn't have any plans for later in the day, but it was hard to voice his answer when he focused in on the way the soldier's hands were sliding up and down his hip ever so slowly, fingers dipping a little bit into the helm of his boxers.
"Then I will help you." She felt a small nudge against her side, and when she looked down, she saw a claw with a cup of coffee held out to her. "Oh, what is this? And thank you, I appreciate it." She said, taking the mug.
"Please, fuck me, Tony!" He chuckled softly, repositioning himself to get as comfortable as possible before he slowly, ever so agonizing pushed himself inside of Steve. He groaned and bit his lip at how tight he was, how his walls were clenching and constructing his cock as he entered. He stilled as he buried himself all the way in, but Steve already started moving just a few seconds after, signaling that he wanted Tony to move. He obliged, pulling out slowly before pushing in once more, using every bit of self-control to not snap his hips hard against Steve and risk hurting him.
His chest tightened, and a lump formed in his throat. He willed his eyes away and let out a shaky breath. He couldn't look at the screen right now, because he was feeling too much all at once and if he continued to look his resolve would crack and he'd go running into that room and apologizing to Steve. And of course, there were things Tony wanted to apologize to him for because he knows he messed up in all of this, but it was his stubbornness and pride that kept him from doing so. He wanted it to be justified that what he was doing to Steve was okay, because he was hurting, and projecting that onto Steve was right. But truthfully it wasn't right to him.
like Steve, which made this more realistic than it needed to be as it closed its eyes once more, white light blinding the genius yet again. This time, when he was able to look again, he saw the creature was dressed up in Steve's Captain America outfit.
"What is it, Stark?" He heard the deep voice of Fury in his ear. He had forgotten for a moment that he had told Friday to call the super spy, so his voice did take him by surprise for a second.
The collar continued to shock him, even as Tony stood up and made his way back over towards the door and left the room, slamming the door behind him in the process. He willed his legs to respond through the pain, bringing his knees close to his chest so that he could rest his head against them, clasping his hands together and putting them on the back of his head, groaning ever so slightly as the pain was starting to become just a little too intense.
"Here ya go, Cap." He took the mug Tony held out to him, one hand wrapping around the mug, bringing it to his lips, and enjoying the sweet sensation of steamy liquid scaling his tongue, creating a blazing trail as it traveled down his throat. He removed the cup from his lips, a ghost of a smile making its appearance on his face.
"Clint said he spotted some Hydra agents on the move, upon further inspection he was correct. They were moving some weapons to a different location, and when we apprehended them, they were S.H.I.E.L.D. weapons."
"I told you, you're not bad at them, and even if you were I'd still happily go through it with you. However, I do wanna kiss you again."
He watched her walk away from him, the sound of her boots once again filling the hallway. He knows that she's right and that he should talk things out with Steve, but after what he just did would that really be a smart idea? He needs to make things right for missing five days' worth of Steve time, for five days treating him with a cold shoulder.
"The TV's right in front of you, Steve." She remarked. He looked at her from his peripheral, noticing the way she continued to look at the TV as she spoke to him. He always took in the way that she seemed more laid back than usual, one foot tucked under her kneecap, elbow resting on the armrest of the couch, head gently resting in her open palm, it was an unusual, yet scary cool, to Natasha that still left much mystery to this woman.
He won't cut Steve out of his life, he'll be there every second for as much, and as long as he can. If he has to stay up every night to make sure the soldier is ok, then by God he will do just that. He will continue to love him through this period of what might be the worst thing to happen to Steve, because to the genius, while the Quinjet crashing and putting him here should realistically be the worse thing to happen to Steve, or even the plane crash that cost him seven decades of his life, the possibility of not being able to speak, not being able to see properly and draw is what truly terrifies him.
Good things can only last so long, however, and as quick as it came it was taken away in an instant. The Quinjet rumbled and rocked in the air, red warning lights flashing inside and all around him. He panicked, turning his head to the side, noticing the right-wing of the jet was broken, smoking, and on fire.
Steve's eyes were glazed, darkened by lust. A string of saliva connected from the tip of his dick to Steve's lip, and he could vaguely feel his hot breath against his member. It sent shivers down his spine and made him throb more. Steve smiled and licked his lips, his eyes staring into Tony's.
It felt nice to receive a smile from Tony, and it felt just as nice to smile back. He missed this feeling; the warm, engulfing feeling of happiness that wrapped its ghostly arms around his heart, keeping it safe. And it was that feeling that made him think, that maybe, just maybe, Tony didn't fully hate him. That he was slowly getting his genius back.
He thought as he made his way back to the elevator. Once the doors opened again to his desired destination, he hurried over towards the spare guest room where Wanda has been staying until Tony can get around to making her, her very own room. To his surprise, the room was completely untouched, everything perfectly in the same place as it should be.
Tony shifted again, this time slamming his fist down on top of the stick shift. The car roared louder as reactor-powered engines sped them over 200 miles an hour toward a hill. Tony weaved to dodge the rain of bullets coming down, accelerating as much as he could as they flew up the hill. Once they got air, the tires retracted and flattened, whirring to life as they doubled as large rotary turbines, allowing for takeoff.
, was the only thought in Tony’s head as he sat in the playhouse, hugging Natasha, who was currently perched on his lap despite being bigger than Tony. He watched through the window as Steve scolded Bucky, who in turn was arguing back.
“Imagine learning that there are more than three states of matter after being told there’s only three for most of your schooling. Learning that something so simple as
He laughed and laid down on the bed, pulling Tony on top of him to wrap his arms around him. JARVIS immediately dimmed the lights, leaving them to bask in the soft glow of the reactor as they sniffled and snuggled.
“That’s it. Nice and easy, just like you learned,” Steve whispered between kisses, smiling when the hands on his shirt started to relax their grip, “You’re doing so well, sweetie. I’ve got you. I’ve always got you.”
Staying pressed up against Steve’s ridiculously muscular arm attached to his ridiculously muscular body in a very tiny hospital bed should have been a foreseeable problem for someone of his age, but Tony accepted the ache from being pressed up against the plastic rails of the bed and the hard muscle. Steve’s warmth more than made up for it, and now with PJ spread out over their laps to sleep, he felt no reason to try and shift. Instead, he carded his fingers through PJ’s hair, unable to help a smile when the child grunted and rolled over to press his face into Tony’s stomach.
“We do have things to do this morning, my love,” Steve murmured into his ear, “As much as I want to stay here wrapped around you, we promised the others we would get up for group training today.”
He pulled his best friend into a hug, scraping his blunt nails against his scalp to get Steve to relax in his arms. Though they’d known Steve had had asthma and various other ailments for a long time and had to be careful because of them, his latest diagnosis of mild scoliosis had really kicked him down since he’d had to buy a new backpack and quit the soccer team.
PJ gave Tony a wary look, and with a small huff, let Steve pick him up. He gave a sad wave as he was carried off, causing the other to bite his lip to keep from smiling too wide. Tony turned back to his food, realizing how hungry he was as he started to chow down. Even after one sandwich was done, he stood from the table and went over to the kitchen counter, making himself a second sandwich to eat. He’d just cut the crusts off of the sandwich when familiar footsteps came into the kitchen stopping just behind him.
The arm under him tightened and moved his arm out and up, slightly rolling Peter onto his side and in toward Tony’s bare chest. Tony turned to glare at Steve, who blinked innocently and offered a sweet, patient smile, but he knew
I could think of to keep in this man’s good graces, and what happens? He just up and decides to not fucking talk to me unless it’s a mission or training. No more drawing in the shop, no more personal blanket during movie nights…hell, he hasn’t even been eating that specialty butter pecan ice cream I found that he really loves. What the fuck is this? Did he think I wouldn’t notice? I notice everything, he knows this, he knows I would notice, he
. I would do anything for you, you know that,” Rhodey interrupted quietly, putting a hand on Tony’s shoulder, “And yes, that seems to include taking extra time off, but I don’t mind. I like spending time with you, and I want to be able to say I was there for you when you needed me most. I already screwed that up once, and I won’t do it again. Alright?”
It was his threat--or maybe his tone, he was not sure--that finally got through. Steve growled loudly and shook, managing to get his feet up onto the wall to push. The extra force from his thighs allowed him to rip the manacles out of the stone wall and he fell to the ground on his hands and knees. The sound of the metal clanging against the ground was almost deafening; Peter startled awake and began to wail, at which Steve looked up, ready to pounce. If he had not been expecting it, Tony was sure he would have not made it out of the cell, as he barely got out the door and locked it before Steve leaped toward them. The Prime banged up against the bars and howled, sounding more distressed than angry.
Bruce seemed a bit surprised, but he muttered a ‘you’re welcome’ and hightailed it out of the room. Tony watched him leave, only to turn his gaze to Steve’s clouded one.
“It’s certainly possible,” Bruce said upon returning, one of Tony’s smoothie thermoses in hand to give to Steve, “We’ll find out. I’m guessing that the stress of the crash plus Steve’s natural tendency to care for the team added to it. And if he prefers to bottom for Tony, that may have caused his body to decide that perhaps he needs to lactate.”
“Why did you say that I am Peter’s only parent? Did you bond with me under the assumption that you would not also become his parent?”
“Back left pouch, the third one,” Steve panted, moving his hands up to fondle Tony’s pecs, “It’s the bottle.”
Steve let out a dry laugh that turned into a cough. He winced when he turned onto his side, but it melted into a lazy smile and put Tony’s fears at ease.
This was Steve’s second Christmas without his dad. Last year had been awful; Miss Sarah only had a landline as it was, and Tony could clearly remember the night when their own phone rang, and a sobbing Steve had asked to speak to Tony. He was allowed an extra two hours past his bedtime to stay up to talk to him, but he still felt like that hadn’t been enough. They hadn’t talked about it since, but because it was nearing that time again, Tony wondered if he should say something.
“We finished outfitting the Prime’s room for you,” Thor explained with a smile, stepping back to allow Steve to help Tony up, “I hope it is too your liking—if you need anything else, I will do my best to have it arranged and brought to you.”
“Just a little longer, I promise,” he soothed as he reached over to give Steve a good scrub, “Peter will be happy to see you, yeah? I am sure he misses your arms. He always looks so comfortable when he is bundled up with you.”
Finding a not-so-filthy blanket, Tony swiped it up before returning to the room he dubbed the “tube room,” handing the blanket over to Natasha.
“Sorry, darling, we do have to wait,” he said regretfully, reaching down to still Steve’s hips, “I want to take my time with you and not rush this. We will have the whole night to ourselves, yeah? Surely you can hold on for a few more hours.”
Tony turned to leave only to smack into Natasha’s chest, grunting as he stood in the redhead’s one-arm hold. Sighing loudly in defeat, he looked down, seeing the littlest monster innocently standing next to Nat.
“Enough, Steve.” Tony heard himself say, surprising everyone in the room, “Peter and I will go elsewhere so you can be alone and rest.”
“Where are you going?” Tony heard himself ask, watching Steve stand as a heaviness like a stone settled in his gut.
When Tony woke up, he knew something was wrong. The room was hot and sticky, much like a humid summer morning, except he knew it was the middle of autumn and long past when these mornings came through. He groaned and tried to move, only to realize that the familiar weight that had been sleeping on his chest for the past week was gone. Scared, he sat straight up and heaved, clapping a hand over his mouth on instinct. After a moment, he spotted the babe: Peter was above the head of his bed in a crib, sound asleep. He had a thought about Steve moving
Her eyes flickered to Tony for only a second, but it was enough to make him feel nervous about what she would do to a person had someone else not been involved. He swallowed and stepped closer to Steve, holding Peter a little tighter when she raised an eyebrow.
Tony laughed harder and leaned into Steve’s shoulder, feeling the heat radiate off the man’s face. He sighed happily and pulled away, grabbing Steve’s hand to guide him toward the staircase. He felt…
“Limos are awesome!” Sam yelled, laughing with the others as Jarvis opened the door and the children streamed in.
“Okay, to be fair, you didn’t tell me anything, and from what the others said, I really thought he knew and you were just beating yourself up until you eventually coaxed yourself out of even going for the relationship,” Rhodey explained gently, putting a hand on Tony’s knee, “Tones, dude, he’d be good for you. And maybe you could loosen him up a little.”
He growled in response and nosed at Peter’s cheek, pleased to hear the babe’s soft babbles. With one part of his pack checked over, Steve returned to Tony and scented his way back up his body, only to stop at the bonding glands on his neck. He flicked his tongue over them and Tony whimpered at the feeling.
I think there will be one or two more chapters left. Here's to trying to finish this before the New Year.
Moving his gaze up from PJ to Steve, Tony took in the Captain’s sad smile and fond look at the child between them. He stayed quiet, silently encouraging the other to continue.
“Good gods,” he muttered to himself, pushing the heel of his hand into his crotch to try and tamp down the unintended side effect of his ‘treatment’, “I must be cursed.”
“Sweetheart, I married you in preschool. This is just a technical formality,” Steve said, grinning at Tony’s watery laugh, “We can go to the City Clerk right now, sign the paperwork and everything. We don’t have to tell anyone if you want to keep it between us. We can graduate as
Once he stopped talking, Bucky and Clint stared at him and then Tony, about to give out cheers at not finishing, when Steve held up his hand.
—Sorry, Dummy just tried to help PJ escape out of his playpen. I had to build that, y’know, the kid can tear up kid toys like nothing I’ve ever seen. I was totally right about the super strength, so he’s definitely your kid—”
The elevator began to move, leaving Tony with his thoughts: earlier, the team had agreed that the best plan forward would be to divide the team into two groups. One would stay at home with Tony as a protectorate for PJ and JARVIS, and the other would infiltrate the Sahara base. The problem was no one could decide who was best suited for each task, as there was no good information about the Sahara base.
He laughed more and happily kissed Steve over and over again, thankful that what he thought would be a gruesome day turned out okay. Peter seemed to agree with the sentiment and gurgled his thoughts, earning just as many kisses from both Steve and Tony.
“So that’s how you did it, huh? What if I just kick you out now? The good Captain won’t be able to slow up in time before he runs you over and shoves your broken ribs into your heart,” the goon purred, flicking the chip out of the truck, “We’ll still have the kid, and we got by before without you.”
Steve stared at Tony for a good thirty seconds before mouthing ‘what the hell,’ then sinking down in his chair and grunting at the pain. Tony covered it with a loud cough, smiling when Coulson looked over at them suspiciously. As soon as he turned away, Tony looked back over at Steve, trying not to laugh at his obvious pout.
He turned to her and expected a fight, but she stared back at him until he averted his eyes in defeat. Steve immediately started to sulk and left, presumably to change clothes. Tony made a surprised noise and turned to Natasha to grin at her. Watching her put Steve in his place always caused a stirring in his stomach, even though he thought he should feel jealousy instead.
When he dropped the engineer’s portrait off, stuck firmly to the Etch-A-Sketch, he told Tony to try a bit harder next time he wanted to be embarrassed. Tony merely smirked up at Steve, a mysterious twinkle in his chocolate eyes.
Tony couldn’t help but smile again, happiness swelling in his heart and making him feel warm and fuzzy. Steve must have noticed, because he bumped their shoulders together and pushed the cup back, making Tony eat his own share as well.
“Sweetheart, I do, but I also do not want to get pregnant and you know that that’s what my body is built for in a heat,” he said weakly, “I--I cannot risk it, not right now. You know this. With the threat of Howard on the horizon, we cannot afford to have any sort of liability.”
“Good news is that there aren’t any other living subjects, like PJ,” the archer said, “We managed to find written documentation of each of the subjects they created, and the only surviving one from those documents is PJ. There were traces of electronic records, but from what we’ve seen so far, they don’t have anything to do with this piece of the project.”
“He knows the city well. He wants to know what you fear that would make you leave behind a wealthy home,” he explained.
He guided Steve to the tub and sat him on the edge, hesitantly pulling his hands away to make sure the Alpha would sit upright. After grabbing the surgical scissors from the medkit and more alcohol, Tony stepped into the tub to stand behind Steve and begin cleaning the head wound.
“I can walk. We should grab cloaks, though. The winter has nearly set upon us and the chill comes much faster here than it did in Ma’atan,” Tony said, “We should bundle up Peter as well. I do not want him to get sick by accident.”
Fury’s one eye glanced around the room and settled on Tony; a small smirk tugged up the corner of his lip, causing Steve to tense up.
“I’ll take it back for a few months so it smells like me again, and by that time, it’ll be completely vomit-free, and you’ll be fine,” he said, smiling at Tony’s sheepish grin, “Don’t worry, buddy. I’ll get it back into tip-top Rhodey shape.”
Not even Steve’s exclaimed “Tony!” could keep Bucky from cackling in laughter, standing up to drag Rhodey out with a yelled “Have fun!” before the door swung shut.
The amused look of disbelief Steve shot his way had Tony in stitches. He was still giggling as they walked into the room they used for training, causing the others to turn their heads with matching smiles of their own.
“I cannot believe that you would do that to me!” He half-whispered, trying to keep his voice down for Peter’s sake, “To—to take me when I cannot fight back, or say no—”
“Gods, you scared me,” he murmured, “What hour is it? It cannot be morning, it is still dark outside.”
“Ah, c’mon, Cap. You just have to spend time with him, that’s all,” Tony said, drying his hands and hopping up onto the counter to watch the other, “He really does like you. I just think it’s in his nature to be afraid first and curious second. He’ll need time, but he’ll come around.”
“Looks nothing like Steve?” Natasha interrupted, raising an eyebrow, “No, but he definitely looks like you.”
“You know, we really do,” Steve admitted, slipping a hand into Tony’s back pocket, “We really, really do.”
Rhodey snorted and made grabby hands at him. “Okay, Mama. Hand him over. I want my daily allotment.”
Steve talked fast and with increasing volume, gesturing as if hand motions would somehow allow Tony to understand him. He, of course, could not understand the frantic shouting, so he put a hand on the back of Peter’s head and started to bounce the babe, murmuring to him softly in an attempt to keep the babe calm. Eventually, Steve cottoned onto the fact that Tony was not listening and growled deep in his register, almost forcing Tony to his knees.
Bucky’s voice filtered through the door before it was rudely kicked open and both men trudged in, taking their places in the chairs by the bed. Bucky snorted at the sight of them curled up together, but Rhodey paid it no mind, collapsing into the chair with a wheeze.
. The thought that Steve would kill Rhodey if he escaped like this made him nauseous, so Tony attempted to block out his conscience and rely on instinct. Ever so carefully, he slowly reached out a hand, delicately laying it on Steve’s abdomen, just above the largest shackle. Immediately, the Alpha tensed and growled, but the force behind it was weakened.
“Tony,” Sarah interrupted gently, moving to his other side to pick up his hand, “You can’t handle it, love. No one can. It’s not right to treat anyone in that manner, especially not you, darling.”
He turned his head to cough loudly, his entire body wracking with the force. After a moment, he slumped back and sucked in a deep breath, just as Steve ran back in with Thor and a new man in tow.
Tony sniffled and pulled back, peeking down to check on the baby. Surprisingly, Peter was calm and drowsy against his chest, slowly chewing on his own fist.
Steve ducked his head, and even if they were not bonded, Tony could feel the shame roll off of him in waves. Careful to not splash water onto the floor, Tony scooted forward to embrace him, tucking the Prime’s face into his neck. He comforted him and rubbed his back until the water began to chill to an unpleasant temperature. They shared a few soft kisses as they cleaned up, dried off, and dressed, leaving them to hold each other until Tony’s stomach interrupted the moment.
“I should have grabbed your dolly from Bruce,” He tutted, pushing the bowl and spoon away so Peter could no longer try to grab them, “You just like causing mischief this morning, hm?”
Steve’s concerned face looked quite sickly in the light of a single candle, so Tony carefully placed a hand on the side of his neck. He stroked his thumb across Steve’s jawline and frowned at the Prime’s lack of response.
of it. I—I better understand what is happening now, so I think I will be okay with it. I did not know that I could even
Steve refused to look up, brushing off the excess hair once he was done the trim. Satisfied, he put the scissors away and retrieved more wipes, taking to his new task like a new mission: anything to focus on to push out the crushing fear that threatened to send him into an inconsolable panic. He started cleaning up Tony’s neck, then ran down his arms and hands, carefully cleaning under his fingernails before picking up the scissors again to carefully trim his nails down. If it weren’t for his superhuman ability to remain steady, he probably would have cut Tony’s fingertips off.
“Young Sir. I’m glad to see that you are awake,” He said softly, “Ana has been asking after you. She’s kept her hands busy with all sorts of sweets that I’m sure you’ll want to try once you return home.”
The Prime Alpha carefully shuffled in and closed the door, kicking off his shoes and garments until he was down to his trousers. Then, he crawled in under the warm furs, hesitating to put an arm around Tony.
, to the point that it might have been mildly annoying. Hell, he would have taken silent agreement over this; it made him feel like he had to choose between them, which really meant choosing between Peter’s safety and Rhodey, and there was no question who he would pick. Troubled by the thought, Tony looked away from Steve, closing his eyes to try to fend off tears.
“I was not always this way. As a child I was thinner and shorter, seemingly stuck in adolescence until a few summers past. Sure, I was of a bloodline destined for kingship, but I was a wisp of a man. It was not until I worked for this body that I could even find someone to court, and by that point, they wanted me for the throne,” Steve continued, “I still think of myself as that scrawny child, so when it comes to you, I guess I lose myself and want to keep you hidden away, where no one could take you from me. Because, you see, they could do it easily, as many in the kingdom are richer or smarter or more handsome than I.”
The boy’s stomach growled in response, at which Tony laughed softly, leaning up to press a kiss to PJ’s cheek. The movement tugged on his ribs, making him groan as he laid back down, hand automatically moving to his injury.
,” Tony hissed through gritted teeth despite every cell in his body wanting to tell Steve the truth in a desperate plea for comfort.
Steve slumped back down into the bed with a nod, attempting to curl back up to Tony’s warmth. Tony placed a pillow into his arms and kissed his temple, laughing when the man grumbled.
sorry I hurt you, son,” Steve whispered, shoulders slumping, “I—I didn’t mean to, and I know you don’t know that since you’ve been hurt so much, and I know an apology won’t
He sat up and stretched, turning to check on Steve. The Alpha was still asleep, so he scooped Peter up and tip-toed into the bathroom with the hope that they would be quiet enough to let the man sleep in a little. First, he had to strip them both--he was still covered in soot and their cuddling had gotten it on Peter. Tony hated to have the boy change out of his clothes, as he had taken on his father’s tendency to prefer nudity and fussed every time he had to be redressed. For now, though, Peter was happy to be rid of his clothes and hop into a warm bath.
A clothing stall with cloaks caught his eye, but before he could head over, a cold hand on his left arm startled him. He turned and blinked at the young woman who was talking quite animatedly.
“He’s my husband, I’m not leaving him,” Steve said sharply, unable to mask the swell of emotion in his voice.
“You do not like it when daddy does not pay attention to you, huh?” He soothed, nuzzling at Peter’s cheek and kissing him there, “I apologize, my love. I will try to be more awake tomorrow so we can spend time together. Perhaps Steve will take us out to see the city, if we ask.”
He smiled fondly as he reflected on the memory, moving behind Tony to start scrubbing down his battered back.
Tony thunked his head back against the headrest of his chair, sighing in loud annoyance to steel himself from turning around to give Steve a piece of his mind.
Tears clouded his eyes, so he reached up to rub them away. It was not fair to not be able to share this precious thing with his Alpha-- something else Howard took from him. Responsibility for the baby came first, and he knew it would be foolish to have another target that could be exploited. They already had to worry about Peter; he was not sure that Steve could survive having two children be put in danger, and he told him as such.
“He will be alright after he finishes eating,” Tony explained, smiling at his genuine concern, “He needs time and patience, is all. Perhaps I will show you how to feed him one day, yes?”
. Theoretically, he knew that they were a fairly peaceful people, but Howard’s voice chanted inside of his head and hands
“C’mon, get him up. The others have got whatever the hell this thing is, I’m sure Tony will want it back when he wakes up,” Bucky said, resting his hand on the back of Steve’s neck, “Up, soldier. We need to get him to a hospital.”
“No! No hospitals, I can’t—I can’t go to a hospital,” Tony panted, trying (and failing) to push Bucky away, “I don’t—I’m fine, really—”
Clint shrugged his approval, followed by a hum from Bruce and a knowing look from Natasha. Turning to Steve, Tony swore the Captain looked a little red, but he chalked it up to the heat in the Avengejet’s cabin.
“Fuck, s’hot,” Tony groaned, attempting to thrust his hips up faster than Steve’s slow strokes, “C’mon, I need it, I need
“I didn’t. Kind of. Pep had me read books way back when, since we had a few scares back in the day,” Tony answered, picking at his nails, “I never actually
“Can you feel me, Steven? Buried deep in your gut?” He purred, “You like feeling my thick cock filling you up?
Tony stuck his tongue out at him and sunk into his seat, tapping his fingers against his desk as he watched the clock on the wall tick by. They had Phys Ed today, which meant that Tony had to meet up with Natasha (as planned) and use her makeup (not fun). He also hoped she managed to snag her mom’s setting powder, so the concealer wouldn’t run when he got sweaty. Last time that had happened, Steve had almost noticed the bruising on his arms, and that shit was not going to fly this time.  It was bad enough that here he was, wearing a long-sleeved turtleneck in the middle of April, just to hide the purpling handprints on his body from Steve.
He was tired, but they wouldn’t let him sleep. They stuck a needle in his arm and gave him something that he wanted to pronounce, but his tongue felt heavy in his mouth. It felt like hours before a knock on the door caused him to sluggishly lift his head, only to smile as Sarah walked in with Steve running up to his bedside. Without prompting, he scrambled up onto the bed, ignoring Sarah’s chastising to delicately slot himself up against Tony’s side. Humming softly, Tony let his head plop over to rest on top of Steve’s, subconsciously snuggling into his warmth.
Feeling hands on his shoulders, Tony instinctively ducked away, scrabbling away until his back hit the side of his wardrobe. Feeling dizzy, he panted heavily, his hand going up to cover his reactor.
“I do not want to leave you here when you are hurting like this,” Tony murmured, grabbing a bar and tilting his head against it, “I might be a little angry, but I know it was all a misunderstanding. I do not blame you for getting so heated… if it had been somebody else you were fighting with, perhaps I would have enjoyed it.”
Tony swore he heard his neck crack since he turned his head so quickly. He must have looked like an idiot, gaping and all, but a grin quickly filled his face and lit up his eyes, not unlike when he suddenly was graced with a brilliant idea.
Tony highly doubted that, but he nodded anyway, leaning up to kiss her on the cheek before leading the group through the house and to the kitchen. Unsurprisingly, Jarvis was already there, slicing the cake up into children-appropriate portions.
“I was, but…something came up. We’re talking through it,” He sighed, patting Tony’s foot, “It’s just a little squabble. He’ll come around and see that I was right, then we’ll be back on track for a ring. I promise.”
“Silly boy. Have we not been feeding you?” Tony teased as he cleaned off his and Peter’s hands with a rag.
Steve hummed and nodded, his short mohawk falling forward onto his forehead as he ducked his head to eat. Pleased that the subject had been dropped, Tony attempted to finish his meal while prying Peter’s free hand off of his spoon every time it came near him.
Letting Steve take it in for a moment, Tony finally looked him in the eye, surprised to see gentleness.
Steve sluggishly picked his head up and blinked, furrowing his brow as if confused at the question. Tony sucked in a breath once he saw how dilated Steve’s eyes were, hoping it was only from his scent and not from shock.
He paused, rolling the plan around in his head for a moment. Deciding that it was good enough to see if he could determine if Tony returned his feelings, Steve slipped on moccasins, hoping that he could pull it off.
“I told you, I don’t do that anymore,” Steve said from down the hallway, padding into the bedroom with Bucky in tow, “It’s good that he’s eating, though. Is something wrong?”
entered Tony’s head, rooting themselves deep into his psyche where he knew that he would have nightmares just from hearing those descriptions. By the end of the multi-page ordeal, Tony had reached across the divide to clasp Steve’s hand, bracing his elbow on his knee so he could hide his face in his other hand. Steve wasn’t faring much better, his shaking shoulders betraying the emotion he was desperately trying to hide. He dropped his head, letting his tears fall and stain his pants.
,” he cursed as she ran fingers over the deep bruising on his side, “Broken ribs, definitely broken—”
“This isn’t getting anywhere,” Tony finally admitted, his heart breaking to watch the child be so afraid, “We’ll be here all night like this.”
was part of the deal. Curious, he attempted to concentrate, pretending he was sending happy thoughts into Steve’s head. Steve only raised an eyebrow and moved his legs again, letting go of Tony’s hand so he could properly position him.
Tony sighed loudly, but Steve already had his baby blues ready, poking out his bottom lip as he fluttered his eyelashes. He watched Tony cave, making a tiny smirk curl up his lips when he sighed again.
—not necessarily good versus bad, but more of good versus evil, y’know? Even when it gets you into trouble, you hold your ground. Like Aunt Peg used to say, right? You have a duty to root yourself and say—”
It was meant to be a joke, but Steve stood, sliding out his hand from between Tony’s hand and PJ’s back.
“You should be in bed,” He answered, “If you rip the stitches, Colonel Rhodes is going to eat me alive.”
Tony sighed. It was not uncommon for Alphas to become lovesick off of Omega pheromones. They became pliant and dopey, like children besotted with one another. Truly, he loved that Steve could be so soft, but this was a moment where he needed his new bondmate to have his head on straight.
“Reading time? Alright, let me get adjusted here and we can read a little. Do you mind if Auntie Pep stays?”
“Then I want Bucky to babysit me since Steve isn’t on my side,” he decided, smirking when Steve’s face fractionally dropped, “Yeah, that’s right. I’m trading you in for the shinier model.”
Dashing Steve from his head, Tony heard PJ before he ever arrived at the boy’s door; hurrying up his pace, he nearly flung the door open, seeing the child writhing in twisted pain, eyes shut tight as small whimpers escaped his mouth.
“Stevie and I went to bootcamp for the summer,” he explained with a shrug, “Well, the second half, anyway. It was tough shit, but it helped me fill out. You should see him. Growth spurt kicked in at the same time, he’s a
It was quiet again after that, and with Tony’s hand still on his thigh, Steve’s mind was racing to decipher the pieces of the conversation like he was cracking a cryptogram.
“We’ll go to medical. But someone needs to bring a bag of stuff down for him. I’m not going to be leaving him alone anytime soon,” He continued.
“Back before I woke up, I memorized foraging booklets before I set out with the Commandoes, just in case we ever got into a similar situation,” Steve explained, grinning when Natasha used her batons to flip the cakes, “They’re really johnny cakes, not pancakes, since there’s no yeast or anything in it.”
“Oh, Tony,” Pepper said sympathetically, shaking her head, “He’ll be back in a month. Then you two can do all the finger-painting you want. I bet he’ll be impressed that PJ knows his colors.”
Timid as could be, the boy shuffled under the spray, shaking despite the warmth of the water. Tony quickly cleaned the boy up, whispering to him the whole time to try and soothe his nerves.
Steve tilted his head and regarded him, so Tony ducked his head and continued to scrub, stopping where the water lapped just above his waist. Before he could dip his hand under the water, Steve suddenly grabbed his wrist and tugged up, forcing Tony to look at him. He offered a reassuring smile and took the soap from Tony’s hand, waving him away.
“I’m offended,” Tony laughed, pulling away to give Steve his dried suit, “Suit up, Captain. Let’s go join the others.”
“Maybe it’s best if he knows now,” he offered, moving to stand a little closer to him, “Tony, he’s not going to hurt you, or PJ. He’ll probably be overwhelmed, but we all are. You can’t hide this from him and PJ doesn’t know any better. If you really want to keep him, it’d be best to identify who his immediate family is first. And that includes Steve. Besides, even if you
“I thought you didn’t like blueberries, Steve,” Sam accused, stuffing a piece of a mozzarella stick into his mouth.
“Fine. But you’re still not allowed to say anything about it, understand?” he said seriously, pinching Steve’s nipple.
Whipping around, Tony blinked, seeing that the boy with shaggy brown hair—Bucky—was standing next to him, peering at the page clutched to his chest. Reluctantly, Tony held it out, and Bucky looked it over, nodding with an approving hum.
The scrapes of chairs on stone floors filled the chamber as the Warlords exited, leaving the room to the small family. Tony took the opportunity to cuddle closer to Steve’s chest and moved Peter so he was tucked between them. He smiled softly once he felt a hand slide down his arm, keeping them safely cradled.
?” Tony whispered, eyeing the Warlords as they dismounted and led their horses to be taken by stableboys, “Is that it? No great toasts? No glory in victory?”
“Shhh, darling. We were not talking about you, I promise,” he murmured, attempting to stave off Peter’s sniffles, “You must really be ready for that nap, huh? Would you like to go nap with Uncle Bruce? Hm? We can get your dolly from your bassinet first.”
Almost automatically, Steve’s hand found Tony’s, and he squeezed lightly; it had become sort of their ‘thing’ whenever they wanted comfort. Tony immediately turned in to hug Steve, thankful for his latest growth spurt so he could finally tuck his face into Steve’s neck without having to go up on his tiptoes. They stayed in the hug until Mr. Coulson called them all to get ready for curtain, at which Steve pulled back with a sniffle.
woman. I don’t own her,” Bucky snorted, crouching down to PJ’s level, “Hi, squirt. I’m James. But you can call me Bucky.”
“Sorry. You’re the smart one, so you answer the questions first,” was all he said before joining Bruce and Clint to nearly sprint out of the room.
Tony huffed at that, frustration evident on his face. With a sigh, he stepped out of his armor, setting it to sentry mode before circling the tube.
“Full,” Tony said, pushing the plate over to Steve, “You eat the rest. I do not think I could eat another bite, lest I risk ripping my new clothes.”
machines. Saving the world is just one of the many things on your already impressive resume. And, Tony—you’d still be a hero without the suit. You were a hero when you got out from under Howard, you were a hero when you built Dum-E and JARVIS, and you were a hero when you saw what was happening in Afghanistan and stopped it. You didn’t need, and you don’t need, the suit. I mean, it’s very nice, but you are the real hero. I mean, people don’t steal you away from me to get to the suit. They try to get you because you’re
Peter always smelled of warm spice and apples, so he was easily recognizable by scent alone. Tony peeked open an eye to check on his sleeping boy and felt relieved to see that he had stayed asleep. Once Steve climbed into the bed, Tony curled up around his boy and let Steve hold them both, creating a little family cocoon. It would have been nice, but Peter began to stir and woke up, immediately bursting into tears once he realized who he was with.
“Can I go in? I do not think he would hurt me, and he definitely would not hurt Peter…. plus, the babe has not let out a peep since we have been down here. He is good about knowing when there is danger.”
put himself in danger for both Peter and me,” he continued, “He snuck his way onto the search party to see if he could get information about my well-being, and instead ended up getting captured. Please, he is--”
He took his time disembarking, not wanting to accidentally trip or disturb the babe in any way. Feeling the eyes of the Avengers, plus those of Fury and the remaining SHIELD agents on his back, Tony kept his head tucked against PJ’s cheek, keeping one hand on the back of his head to keep the boy supported correctly.
of me, lay back down, you maniac—Tony was just going to tell me about when you two started boinking,” Rhodey explained, holding his finger out toward Tony to get him to stay down.
Steve looked up and choked, finding Rhodey collapsing onto the floor next to him, clearly shaken up. Without letting go of Tony, he drew the other man into a one-armed hug, grateful for the momentary comfort.
He could feel Steve gently massaging the cream around him and inside of him. Slowly, the pain began to ebb away, numbed enough to be more than bearable. He barely felt Steve’s fingers slip out and he sighed quietly, letting the Alpha re-dress him and pull the furs back down to cover him.
“You are right. It is not fair of me,” he mumbled, “I am sure my mother, the gods rest her soul, would hit me upside the head for having double standards, especially for my mate.”
It was quiet until Bucky cleared his throat, pretending that he didn’t see Steve’s shoulders tighten.
Technically, he was not worried at all about the actual training. He and Rhodey had sparred often as children and he turned into a reasonably decent brawler, especially once Rhodey had joined the Royal Guard and picked up some new moves to try on him. The fighting part was easy. Fighting with
“Well, yeah. He’s at the pre-boarding school age. I was quiet and fairly reserved then. Steve was a monster until the army,” he said, sitting down carefully as to not spill the rest of his cocoa, “He always got into fights and ran around like a madman despite being a shrimp with enough disabilities to be the poster child for ADA pamphlets.”
“Possibly,” T’Challa answered with a nod, “Shuri got in touch with Vision and Dr. Banner, and the three of them have pinpointed an outpost similar to the one you originally infiltrated. However, it is deep in the Sahara Desert, so we suspect that it is a much larger complex than what scans are showing. Plus, it’s an ideal location for keeping hostages, as they cannot possibly escape and survive in the desert for very long.”
“Pete, no,” Tony scolded lightly, sitting down so he could peel the baby’s hands away from Steve’s finger, “We need to get you something to chew on, my love. Hands are not supposed to be in mouths.”
“Well, I talked to the nurses. Rumor is it the doctors will give you the all clear soon. I may have told them that we signed you up for therapy in the States already and that we need to get you home,” he said, smiling when Tony perked up, “Pepper will meet us when we land with fast food and the limo to take you all back to the Tower.”
Tony looked to Thor and reached out, taking Peter back into his arms. He showed the baby to Steve, smiling when the Warlord relaxed once he could see that the babe was calm. In fact, Peter gurgled and moved an arm to wave at Steve, attempting to grab at his beard. Enthused, Steve leaned down, laughing at the baby’s weak grip. Tony’s heart filled with warmth at the sight.
Finally finished... Unbeta'd. Comments and kudos are really appreciated. Ask me questions over @avengersasssemble on tumblr.com.
Tony let out a slow breath, attempting to melt back into the hospital bed. He tried to take it all in, make sense of it, but his brain was slow and foggy, no doubt from whatever they’d put in his drip. Sniffling, he turned to look at Bucky, gently squeezing his hand back.
“I’m fine,” Tony interrupted, putting his hands up as he moved back to the chair on the opposite side of PJ’s bed, “Just…I’m fine.”
“I can take care of him if I’m hurt, but I appreciate the help,” Tony interrupted, seeing the gesture as a half-apology, “Thank you, Steve.”
allowed to walk all over him and Peter. Annoyed, Tony scooted over in the bed and wriggled his way out of Steve’s arms, growling when he tried to reach for them. Tony curled his arms over Peter protectively, flushing slightly under the Alpha’s gaze.
Surprise and barely-contained excitement washed over Steve’s face, setting his blue eyes alight. Tony could feel the happiness spread through the bond, causing him to shake his head fondly.
Skidding to a stop, he faced the three HYDRA agents that stepped out of the shadows, only to turn and see five more agents in his peripheral; Tony took one last look at the Tower before easing his stance into a less aggressive one, swallowing to calm his nerves.
gotten lost, he took everyone down to the home movie theatre, grinning when they all started to chatter again, squishing themselves onto the large couch.
leave. You don’t sit next to me at movie nights anymore, you don’t come down to the lab to draw, hell, you’ll only spar with me if Nat forces you to,” Tony spat out.
“Look, man, just because it’s the Air Force doesn’t mean we’re formal and uptight,” Rhodey grunted, an easy smile resting on his face anyway.
At the mention of his name, the boy poked his head up and made a reach for Tony. Natasha carefully put him back down on the bed; he grabbed up his elephant as he scrambled to Tony’s side, tucking himself underneath Tony’s arm.
Of course, Steve pushed the plate back and talked, motioning to Peter and then to Tony. Seeing that he was not understanding, Tony frowned, trying to think up a way to communicate. After a moment, he picked up one of the pieces of meat, holding it out to Steve. The Alpha looked at the offering and then at Tony, and after Tony opened his mouth a little, Steve got the hint and carefully wrapped his lips around Tony’s fingers, pulling back to chew and swallow.
He jerked forward when Steve’s fingers gently massaged his rim and he had to bite down on his lip to keep from whimpering. It did not hurt as much as it had that morning, yet Steve’s fingers were still just as big, and now he could focus on them without being distracted by the pain. This was the
“Can you make sure Ste—that the Prime stays away? Tell him I can spread the sickness or whatever you can think of. I have barely been here a day and that man has already pushed me into doing… things… I had
“That’s good. It is not fair that we are told not to read by people who are not Omegas. Or, even by other Omegas. It’s a basic right.” She spoke like Pepper and I realised that what I had been bought to was nothing less than a rebellion.
I would not develop breasts until pregnant, even then that would be due to swelling from the production of milk, due to my male physical build. Part of me felt glad about this part of my body. Dara’s breasts were large, and as a Beta, she would not be given the courtesy given to Omega women. Men ogled her in the streets, sometimes saying lewd things.
Pepper grinned. “Thank you, Tony…” She stuck her tongue out at Natasha, who looked at my in mock shock.
Pepper couldn’t find out for me what had become of Rhodey. It was best to assume he was dead; any other thought would be worse than that of death. Suffering with the thought of Rhodey bring dead was devastating, but I knew that I had my chance at Totleigh to get ready to avenge his demise. I would make sure the world knew about Rhodey and the unjust way in which he was treated by the powerful ones in our society.
In the three ceremonies that I had been two at that point in my life, there had been basket upon baskets of presents, so much so that early morning the next day, the Alpha and Beta relatives had to make four trips to the ceremony centre in order to pick up the items.
I wondered why, since most of my father’s work took place in the city, we did not live there. My mother claimed it was because she couldn’t stand the ‘city air’. My father mentioned something gruffly about the ‘corrupt rebels running amok’. Dara told me in her soft voice that it was really about keeping my ‘unware of the bad things that happen to Omegas’. She had told me that with a knowing smile, before darting back off to the kitchen.
“Tony? Tony, what is it?” Aunt Peggy started checking my body, probably for signs that I had been attacked after all. I yanked my vessel away from her hands.
Natasha had told me this story when I was slightly older, around fourteen. I had begun my heat recently, though that is a story for later, and for once, I began to hate my body. It was these thoughts that allowed Natasha to tell me this story.
“Loki, this is dangerous.” Thor whispered as he watched his younger brother pick up a dragon-steel daggar, the cool metal shining against the fire that roared in the hearth. The Alpha let out a snort.
Miss Drayton, an elderly woman who had Dara’s position as ‘nanny’ before the events I am about to reveal, took pity to my circumstances. At first, milk. Then cream, then porridge. All liquid-based and just about palatable. My mother, who had seen my sudden downhill turn in health as a punishment from the lord for speaking about becoming a knight, did not know at first what Miss Drayton was doing. Instead, she believed the return in energy was a sign that the lord had changed my mindset into becoming more Omega. Whatever it means to become ‘more Omega’ in the first place, heaven knows not I.
“Don’t act silly. James Rhodes. The Alpha who’s been raping you.” He said kindly, softly. “Of course, as Lord, I need to get proof. Your father gave me permission so-“
Obadiah breaks past my hymen with a brutal thrust of his finger and I scream into his hand. It hurts! It hurts, it is only a finger, but it hurts me so badly. I have not ever been penetrated by anything and… He moves his finger around harshly.
Soldiers had stations along the main roads, and on all turn-off points that led the individual to other villages and farms.
I really did not know. My confused expression must have been visible, because Rhodey visibly winced. “Tony, your dad makes sure that the only people who get good jobs are wealthy and healthy and are Alphas.”
The thug bled to death as Natasha sobbed against another dead body, this one with several stab wounds. Still warm.
“Oh Thor…” Heimdell shook his head, a small smile on his lips. “You truly are high-spirited. No, you must go with Bruce Banner. I promise you, Thor, you can return one day. And perhaps, well, perhaps you can be ruler.”
My father and Obadiah worked together to ensure that my ‘re-education’ was kept strictly as knowledge between themselves, my mother and Dara. It was yet another reason for shame to be brought upon him and as an excuse he told his associates that I was simply at a boarding school in Europe, learning how to run a house smoothly and please an Alpha of the highest standards.
I nodded solemnly, dropped the clean fork onto the table and trailed up the stairs to my room. I closed my eyes.
Not one person ever explained to me the etiquette of getting along with others. Truth be told, I would sit sour-faced as a child whilst the Omega children of my father’s associates would rummage through my toys, my clothes, my trinkets. They would violate my world, only to be invited back by my father after declaring he and the dark, blurred associate were good friends and therefore I must be the best of friends with the gremlin children.
I assumed not to the last one. Match Makers were busy people and as much as I wanted to believe that I was special, it occurred to me that there was no possible way I could be as unique as I wanted to believe I was. Pepper probably wanted to give this opportunity to all of her clients.
“Tony, please…” She stroked my hair back. “Listen, Rhodes is a good cadet. He listens well. And do not think he won’t be getting a good telling off for this. He should know better. But you cannot fantasise about having a life with him. It will not happen. There is no possibility of it happening.”
She held my hand as she guided me down the stairs, back to the parlour where my mother sat knitting. She looked up from the repetitive craft and gasped.
Brunnhilde had gathered some sort of soft spot for Thor over the years spent training him. Naturally, when the warrior was initially informed that she would be teaching the Omega Prince to fight, she felt annoyed.
Natasha went and took my bags, whispered a quick word to the driver, handed him money, watched him leave and close the gates. Every action she performed was done with such precision…
“Um… I can make wood stuff… Like, um… Chairs? I can design good though. I have the correct tools to design at home, not so much build… Sir.” I added the sir on at the end, like Pepper did. It was the wrong thing to do, it appeared, as the doctor’s body went stiff as the word left my mouth.
It was a difficult task, and one that made me feel quite angry on the inside. It should be simple! An office! What resided in an office?
With a tired sigh, I pulled on the cords and the blouse. I looked odd. Too small for the trousers. They were probably Natasha’s or Pepper’s, anyhow. It made sense they wouldn’t fit a ten-year-old.
I carriage my bag indoors, exclaimed ‘hello’. I heard Dara’s voice from the kitchen. I went upstairs, opened the door, walked in, struck my oil lamp.
It still was constricting and made my waist impossibly small once again, but this time it didn’t feel sore or to too tight, even as she pulled at the stays with a light grunt. The cream colour met nicely with my flesh and I blushed as I caught my expression in the mirror. For the first time, my body appeared attractive to my own eyes.
“I’m afraid not, Madam Stark. I must travel back to the city for a meeting this evening. It has been an absolute pleasure meeting you and Tony.”
“I’ll sort it, Tony… Now, go and get in the carriage.” She ordered gently, flicking my nose. I nod, clambering up the steps into the handsome oak travelling carriage, tracing the velvet padding with my forefinger.
“He keeps us safe from outer influences, you see.” She stroked my hair with heavy sigh. She wished my hair was longer. “He punishes those who don’t try their hardest to make sure we’re safe. Lord Stane is like God.”
Skittish and afraid to disturb his soliloquising of his hard day working out deals with the City, she would raise her hand to the level on her nose, a silent indication that she may have more than just a simple to nod to contribute to the evening.
Rhodey’s voice was soft and encouraging, yet never really patronising. At first, when he was teaching me how to build and he was reciting the Weekly Post (the village’s first and only newspaper) to him in a calm, even voice, he seemed to believe that he could help me in terms of education, too.
She told me that I was more than welcome, got back into her carriage and left the estate, turning right to the city.
That evening, Dara told me that a week on Thursday, Miss Potts would pick me up in the morning and I would not be back until Friday evening.
He let out a soft yelp as I landed full bottomed on his lap. His book dropped down the side of the armchair and I took in a deep breath, awaiting a telling off about acting proper. He was still an Alpha, after all. And had every right to belittle me.
It was repetitive and bought about a sweet sort of comfort between the two of us. I especially enjoyed the action after he had complimented my intellect, where the squeeze was for something that should, truthfully, have landed me in prison.
Odin’s funeral was in the summer, when the lilies and the tulips danced in the low breeze. Trees created shade, reaches of shadow in the high sun.
Pepper tidied away her books and notes and pencils and thanked my mother with a handshake. I walked her to the door.
I asked her again for information regarding where precisely we were going. Totleigh Manor, she responded.
I cry and whine and sob as he continues to jab and roughen me up. He is sweating, too, and he keeps making strange faces, His penis is rubbing up against my thigh, and he finally stops, with one final jab. His crotch feels warmer and I understand now that he had ejaculated.
“Get off my nephew at once, Rhodes!” Auntie Peg’s voice filled the room. Despite the fear still struck in me, my shoulder relaxed. Aunt Peggy could be reasoned with. Aunt Peggy was good.
Silence. I feel a little sick. I do not understand what is being said, what they mean by ‘the one’, or what my potential might be.
“I’d claw him if he did.” I replied. Natasha snorted. Pepper continued to laugh. I opened my mouth to speak once more when there was a knock at the door.
Obadiah removes his finger and waved it in front of me. It is covered in slick and blood and sweat. He removes his other hand from my mouth and roughly jerks my head into a kiss. He doesn’t care that I am sobbing uncontrollably. Instead, he finishes the kiss, licks his finger clean, and gives on final sniff.
“Show me what you build, Tony. I’ll come again when your father is out of the village on business. Show me what you build.” He ruffled me hair then. It was the first time anybody had ever done that to me. I felt the warmth radiating off his hand, the callouses on his fingers, the heavy weight of the gesture.
Not that being an Omega is necessarily a bad thing; I am granted emotional-attachment, the right to go stir-crazy. These are my rights as an Omega. Certainly, I will never take them granted, at least never again.
It was the sort of place you expected a rich family to live, with staff and a nanny. Unlike my home, though, it was personal and homely. My house felt empty. Everything was for show, including myself. My mother was a little porcelain doll. I was being turned into one, too.
It isn’t my story to tell, not in the way he told me that day under the veranda, whilst the rain played in tandem to his tale.
“Leave the love life antics to Pepper, you goose.” She swatted my arm playfully. I let out a soft laugh. Like I have said; Dara is a close friend, a great friend, even if society says she cannot be anything other than a maid. “Mother is certainly keeping you on, then?”
And strangely enough, I could imagine it like the fire in the hearth in our cottage was giving off real heat. The freshly caught rabbit sizzling away as I curled into Rhodey’s side, maybe pregnant.
It was not until she reached the bottom step that she noticed the utter silence. Dread knotted in the pit of her stomach, like a poisonous snake wrapping itself around prey. She crept silently to the door, creaking it open with miniscule pushes.
“True, that is certainly true. Perhaps it was a blip on her part?” Pepper shrugged. “Or maybe she wanted to help you develop skills that were not sewing or knitting?”
Trembling, I put my fingers against my birth canal and pull them back out. Red. It smells like copper.
“Fresh, like an unpicked rose.” He comments, the tone so lazy. As if he is flower picking. A finger, the index finger on his right hand, prods my labia. I whimper and he crushes me down. His nails are dirty and long and they scratch as he strokes the very beginnings of pubic hair.
“Aunt Peggy, I do not want to belong to another Alpha.” I told her with a sort of tone that indicated that I was heart-broken. What does a ten-year-old know of heart-break?
… Then I run up to my room. There is a desk, obviously. I sit on it, grab a piece of paper, and spew out the words I know onto a page.
It looked pathetic; I knew that. Dejected, I quickly allowed the fat to snap back into place and pulled the corset up for decency.
My mother hated the fact Auntie Peg taught me how to read and write. She told Peg that I was not her child, and that if I was then the military would take me away from her and give me to a more deserving Beta family.
“Tony, you’re amazing. And smart and you know words I do not and you can do anything you want… and you’re trapped her. You don’t feel it now ‘cause you’re young and they keep you away from everyone. But they wanna ship you to some old rich man who will not care about you or your brains.” A tear ran down his cheek. I opened my mouth to speak but he shook his head.
“Pepper, do you dance?” I asked. The read head shook ‘no’. “I can dance, Mother said I had to prepare for my wedding.”
The delicacy that was displayed by the drawings within the book itself transferred over to the writing. It was tiny. And the guttering candle did not help. I squinted my eyes, trying to read. It was only fuelling my frustration! I wanted to be able to read the diary, I truly, deeply did. But the writing was withered and hard and-
Natasha walked through, hair up in a complicated bun that looked relaxed and serious at the same time; it suited Nat well. She gave me a smile, and the scent of a warm stew followed through with her. “Back so soon?” She asked, crossing her arms. “Pepper really did turn you into one of us, huh?”
I wonder now if what I loved was Rhodey, or the freedoms that came with being his. I suppose it was a mixture of both.
And thus the two grew together, Loki and Thor, Thor and Loki, the brothers who unsuited physically to their genders.
I think I felt a sense of authority over her at first. I could laugh at myself for it now, of course, but when I was that young and that new to this secret world of freedom, Natasha was a shock to the system.
To answer some questions: Tony is a Male Omega in this work. If you are not familiar with the Omega verse, or are interested in my version of the Omega verse, then I can write a section for this. And yes, The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood is an inspiration for this work. Other inspirations come from Carol Ann Duffy's poetry Anthology The World's Wife, Khaled Hosseini's The Kite Runner and Jim Hall's poetry collection, Boy. The piece is set in the past, the 19th century, but is an AU that focuses on tradition the treatment of certain members of society.
Obadiah sniffs again and moans as he rubs against the entrance. I sob, a scratchy, thick sob. “They should bottle this scent up, sell it to the whores.” He declares. He rubs me more, creating friction and I feel bile rise up to my throat. I am sweating, and it stinks and he’s touching parts of me that are not his to touch. I urge myself not to throw up.
I was going to be her redemption, she told me, hugging me close. It was not often Natasha hugged me. Pepper, yes. Others, yes. But she seemed to fear hugging me.
Thor was sleeping when the sound of metal on metal and clattering on the floor awoke him. He jumped up, ready to fend off the attacker. The sound of footsteps crept close, as did the smell of smoke and the sound of heavy breathing.
The Courts of Justice were to the left and Father often frequented there as a Decider. Deciders were all rich Alphas that the government felt best understood what to do with criminals. My father did not ever really speak about what happened at the Courts unless Lord Obidiah Stane was there, since he was OverLord of the institution.
“With all due respect, Madam, all cloth used prove to be nothing more than strips of cut-away clothing from far finer, more beautiful clothing. There is a reason I have been entrusted with such a position so early in my life and I would appreciate if you would perhaps install a little bit of trust in me. For your son’s sake more than my own, may I add.” She ran the monologue with precision and a short-cutting tongue that only served to further drag the point across to my mother’s narrowed vision of life. I could tell she had spoken those words more or less the same before. No wonder she had become a Match Maker at 16. She proved to be persistent enough to become one.
Other Alphas the village have taken to drink in the past. Most lose everything and are kicked out of their communities. I wish my father wasn’t the anomaly to that pattern.
Natasha noticed me looking at the stacks of books longingly and laughed. “Can you read?” She asked me. I wondered if she was wanting to mock me, but there was no trace of malice in her eyes or tone.
I looked up at her, shocked. I wasn’t often on the receiving side of gifts. Why give a gift to somebody who could have everything they would ever need or, more importantly, want? My father let me entertain myself mostly, and allowed the staff to take me to the shopping district. I owned one of everything an Omega was allowed to play with, even a few Alpha-designed toys that were kept away under the stairs.
Her voice, her attitude, it was misguided in its misery. It led to her, presumably, destruction. A place in Stane’s fortress of fucking Redirection.
I wanted to know who I was. Dr. Banner was the person who could help me find out. Why couldn’t I come up with a simple idea?!
“Sounds like a trick that most certainly backfired, then.” Pepper replied. What? Dara, attempting to trick me?
Before my fifth birthday, the roles you are made to take do not matter. Why would a young Omega worry about the circumference of their waist when the entire world was there for endless exploration? Alphas get more time to live in their fantasy worlds, however; Alphas have to grow before they can take on their roles as protectors and providers. ‘Become a soldier, keep your neighbours safe’. That is what the recruiters would say, attracting young Alphas towards it.
It wasn’t until a nightdress was pulled down over my head that I finally responded in a manner that did not resemble a child’s doll. I grabbed her hand, pulling Dara close. She appeared shocked, but sat beside my anyway.
It was scandalous yet beautiful to me, at the age of seven, to see Omegas, my sex, acting this way. My mother would avert her eyes, shielding herself from the sights.
“Madam Stark, I believe that I have a much better method that will stop the skin from becoming dry, blotchy and irritated. It will certainly prove to be far less painful than what the wet rag-
“The present is inside the box, silly.” He cooed at me. I flushed red and opened the box. Another box was resting inside. I tried not to look hurt as I took it out and opened it.
I was slightly perplexed when my mother had reacted so strongly to my drawings when I was around seven. My father had left a pencil and paper on the kitchen side, forgotten during his spitting argument with the Gardener, a young Alpha who I remember stealing roses from the garden for any Omega that took his fancy. I had fun, clumsily holding a pencil and drawing little marching stick figures.
She had wandered briefly why the blade was so sharp. She later found a diary being kept by one of the younger Omegas, talking about how they were going to kill the band. They understood that they were not truly free, and that freedom had to come through death. The blade was their only hope, and so they had been sharpening and working on the blade whilst caring for the other weapons. Why a shaving blade?
“Alphas can’t control themselves around fresh Omegas.” He said, Dara’s chicken soup matted into his grey beard. It made me feel so queasy. “Omegas twist it all around to suit them. They think we do not know, but we do.” He gave a curt, angry nod of his bald head as if it was furthering his point. I could see the sweat collating within the folds of fatty flesh on the back of his head. “So this Omega, fifteen, pregnant and unable to name the father, cries ‘rape’! All Omegas cry rape, but my clients cannot rape when their thinking capacities are hindered. This Omega boy worked in a tavern his parents owned, too. Full-fleshed and handing out beer to hard-working, respectable Alphas. Deserved what happened.”
An Omega of six tender years, she was lively yet gave a sort of bite with her attitude. She entertained me more than anything; I admired how she freely spoke. ‘That’s an awful coloured dress, I would be ashamed to be seen in it’.
“Miss Potts, will it help me get somebody good?” I asked her suddenly, with hushed tones. The pain us Omegas go through is expected to be suffered silently; it is the Alphas and Match Makers that verbalise such things.
Thor never seemed bothered. He spent most of his time with his friends. Though Odin had a slight suspicion that his son was perhaps slightly too close to the Warrior Sif – he chose not to comment and, instead, kept a close eye on their relationship.
He smiled at me, toothy and wide. I felt embarrassed at that smile. He was a handsome boy, small muscles forming, ready to take shape into Alphahood. He and the other Alpha, a 15 year old named Maria who was, in all accounts, quite terrifying, placed the workbench and accessories in the middle of my room. Dara paid the two and sent them on their way.
If I eloped with James Rhodes, then I would be given the opportunity to be my own person. I craved for the freedom.
We did not go the left, down South towards the city.  We had gone right, a path nobody ever went besides soldiers. I assumed that there were more cities and villages, but further away and therefore not worth travelling to.
“Then, we’ll see in six months how well it works, Miss Potts. Would you like a cup of tea?” She went to refill Pepper’s tea cup but was stopped with a curt shake of the head.
Yet I would be forgotten. I’d watch the Omegas present themselves, like a selection of fine jewellery. Alphas would give them gestures, and the Omega would either ride back to the stables or lurk around, waiting for a thumbs up and the swish of a wrist. So, I’d watch this strange type of courting before I knew what was happening.
