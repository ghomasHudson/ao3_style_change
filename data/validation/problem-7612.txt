The image shimmered again, and Steve was in his sweatpants and a T-shirt, settling his hands on a smiling Tony’s hips, drawing him closer for a kiss.
“I’m going to take us to California,” he said instead, watching Steve’s eyes widen. Yup, he recognised
“Of course not,” Rhodey, sighing. “I’m not that lucky.” He sounded too tired to argue.
He cast a glance at the closed bedroom door, behind which - he hoped - the kid was still safely asleep.
“I want the doctor to take a look at you before we head down. I can’t believe you flew
Tony thought, exhausted. He had no time to spare for Barnes’s feelings, not when the kid was in danger of doing himself an injury. “OK, that’s enough, no kicking!” He grabbed Steve by the wrists - mindful of the catheters, and the dislodged face mask - and hauled him up into his lap. “No more yelling, everything’s fine,” he said, drawing the trembling child into a hug. His hand automatically went to cup the back of Steve’s head as he flung himself into Tony’s embrace. If he closed his eyes, he could hear Jarvis’s quiet voice, gentling him through his nightmares. He pitched his voice low, aiming for that same quiet tone of parental reassurance. “That’s it, now. Everything’s fine. I’m here.”
. “He doesn't know me,” he said, finally, helplessly. “He's just grabbed on to the nearest adult. Once he's back to normal…” Rogers would put him through a wall for having witnessed him like this, Tony was fairly certain. Despite his protestations of complete transparency, Rogers had never been big on sharing even before Tony had realised he’d actively hidden the whole Winter Soldier fiasco.
fault. He fed Tony another ice chip. “It very nearly wasn’t. D’you know how dangerous blood-thinners are with a concussion? You had a fucking cerebral haemorrhage, for fuck’s sake, you coded twice before they were able to stabilise you! Why the hell didn’t you say something?”
It... did not go great.
Barton chewed his lower lip. “He…. he concurs with Tony’s assessment. He wants to know what restraints the Princess has come up with.”
“Well,” he said faintly, staring in horror at the pile of bodies. “That’s a special level of fucked up.”
No, he couldn’t think that way. Things were already muddy enough without this; no, all he had to do was figure out a way to… well, fix things. Magically. Or - if he had his way - scientifically.
“No,” Tony said. “No, it wasn’t him.” He’d kept the suit on but had opened up the chest plate, rubbing at the ache in his chest, from the tight knot beneath the sternum up to the lump in his throat, a numb line radiating pain across his ribcage.
And his father had not hesitated. Tony owed his existence to just that moral expediency; he owed his freedom to those men willing to take on the stains of killing on to their own souls for his benefit.

If he’d been dancing the tarantella and waving the flag, Tony would still be fucking petrified.)
He was asleep.
Dammit, he hadn’t expected to miss
, Tony thought with disgust - and Mordo was sat at the table alongside everyone else. Of course, he had Wanda on one side on him and Barnes on the other, so perhaps T’Challa hadn’t entirely lost the plot.
“Your sugar plum has far less patience for your bullshit now that they’re weaning me off the good drugs,” Rhodey said matter of factly. “Come on, out with it.”
The gray on the edge of Tony’s vision recedes by inches as he stares down at the worktop. Tony swipes away the screensaver and in its place materialize a pair of rotating schematics, facing each other like combatants. His notes scroll down the side, prodding into the relevant sections with thin implements. They look like puppets, held up by textual string.
“You were?” That
“You said a bad word,” Steve whispered, pale and miserable where he’d hurriedly stood and grabbed a hold of Tony’s leg, and Tony -
-” He should have known that this was not something that would be physically possible. All he’d wanted was to make sure that someone was keeping Steve occupied during the consultation...
“No?” She let her hand drop and leaned back in her chair. “Then why are you holding your tea like that?”
Comments are love.
He shook his head. Nothing he could do about it now; better make use of what time he had with Jane Foster and the Princess. “Like the bracelet, huh? That blew me away, by the way, it’s phenomenal work. Talk me through it?”
Tony thought. He kept face as relaxed as possible. “I need some way to keep our mutual friend away from the kid. There’s only a couple that come to mind, and I’m gonna need help with either one.” Because the only way Tony could think of this becoming an even bigger clusterfuck than it currently was if Ross decided to stick his nose in.
Wilson rubbed at his eyes and fought the yawn. “He’s in post-op, they’re still doing their assessments. But they’re optimistic the surgery was successful.” He looked away for a moment, as if steeling himself. “How’s Steve?”
“Quinjet’s standing by to get us to Wakanda,” Barton said. His gaze was thoughtful as he watched Tony struggle to get back into the armour without dropping the sleepy child in his arms. “I figured you could make your way back from there, once we get Steve settled down.”
He looked out of the window, his fingers carding through Steve’s tousled hair, thinking. Damnit, he’d probably have to talk to Barnes about this. He might have some idea about what Steve had thought as a child.
Tony knew that look; had faced it across conference rooms and training rinks. He had less than a rat’s ass chance in hell of getting anything useful out of Steve once their esteemed leader was in that mood, and he doubted that the kid would be any more cooperative. He hesitated for another moment, trying to figure out what he could say, but in the end it was a lost cause. “OK, well… I’m just down the hall if you need me,” he said and patted Steve’s shoulder again. He slid out of the bed and eased the kid back down on the pillows, fluffing them behind him a little to give him a little bit more elevation for his chest. “Just - just call if you need something,” he said finally, lost.
Tony’s discomfort. “Vision checked in, everyone is apparently OK. There’s been another attack, though, so - well, you get the idea.” He looked down at where Wanda was still sat on the ground slowly rubbing the back of her head. “Wanda, you alright? You didn’t hit your head or - or anything?” The pain in his chest hadn’t eased, tight as a vice around his ribcage. He wanted - he didn’t know what. He wanted to call Vis and talk to Steve; he wanted to get back there and check on Steve himself; he wanted -
And they’d have to make some contingency plans, in case things were not resolved as swiftly as Tony hoped. Sure, he’d promised to Barton he’d look after Steve -
“Tony, please,” he says instead, so fucking
Rhodey met his gaze with an effort for a moment before looking away again. “Sam put me in touch with some guys he knows,” he muttered. “I didn’t want to… there might have been a paper trail if I’d gone down the official route, and…”
“OK, that’s… that’s fine. You don’t have to, that’s fine. It’s OK to not want to talk about scary things.” God knew, he hadn’t been big on sharing when he’d been this age.
M’Baku blinked at him from where he stood in the doorway, his mouth open in surprise. “Which parts?”
He took a step back. “I can’t,” he said, soft and quiet. “It’s too much to ask. You can’t force it. I can’t - this isn’t something I can deal with while Rogers is in absentia.”
Tony held up his arms as if to demonstrate.
“Yeah?”
And after the war?
(See the end of the chapter for
They’d never do it. They’d tell him to turn away and come home and
“But you won, right?” Tony asked, a trifle skeptically. “You beat back Tweedledum through the Looking Glass and all is saved?”
, he thought, bitter.
His brow furrowed, he dropped off to sleep to the sharp pinch of the IV catheter sliding in to the back of his hand.
(He’d had those thoughts himself; of course he had. If he’d died on Yinsen’s operating table, maybe Yinsen would still be alive; maybe Rhodey would still be able to walk; maybe Pepper would be safe; maybe the world would be better if -)
Not for himself. Not for the sake of a friendship he’d never been entirely sure had been there. And not for her, either; not for her sake, or her peace of mind. But for Steve? For Steve asleep, dressed in Tony’s AC/DC T-shirt, wrapped in a linen burrito, his clothes carefully folded and his little sneakers within reach, the nightlight on until Tony could get home…
“You have children holding on your legs,” Tony said, blinking. (They were also both mostly covered in green paint.)
Better bombs. Smarter bombs. A larger stick with which to threaten the end of the other guy’s world.
The therapist looked up from where he’d been scrutinising Tony’s chart. “Yes, that would be fine.”
“If being part of SHIELD accomplished nothing else,” Barton drawled, “it did teach our fearless leader the value of leaving copious records.”
“In my defence,” Barton said, laughing, “I did actually know that.” He lifted up the colouring book. “Are you going to help Steve with his colouring in after your physio? I’m sure that’s good for his recovery, right?” His eyebrows were raised meaningfully, as if he was hinting so heavily that even Vision would be able to spot it.
He left them to it, the two vipers, and stomped back to the pilot’s console, easing himself into the co-pilot’s seat. “FRI,” he murmured, pulling the faceplate down and tuning out everyone else, “call Steve.”
. The Bartons had all disappeared within days of the Raft break-out, and Tony had no fucking idea where they were. He'd
He blinked again, and suddenly the shamed look had drained from the child’s face, leaving only terror behind.
screw up.”
Between him and Barton, they got Steve to the medical table at the back of the quinjet, while Romanoff slid back into the pilot’s seat and got them back in the air in a hurry. There wasn’t a whole lot of useful medical equipment available - the kits were stocked primarily for battlefield medicine and trauma, and so were heavy on the bandages and medical-grade surgical glue, and light on pretty much everything else. After a lot of rifling they managed to find a couple of small canisters of albuterol, presumably for damaged airways or for post-gas exposure. He got a dose of that into Steve, bracing him against his chest so he had something to push against as he coughed and wheezed. Barton tore through the med kit until he came up with one lone packet of Tylenol probably left over from a civilian evacuation or something, and managed to convince the half-asleep Steve to get a quarter of a crushed-up tablet down him with a drink of water.
You'll be pleased to know that my vague idea of what the bad guys are up to is now a much more fleshed-out idea of dastardly deeds and evil shenanigans. Although still ridiculous. (And yet semi-canonical, all the same. Marvel, ilu.)
Barton’s expression had settled into something carefully bland. “I was, uh, actually referring to you leaving without saying your goodbyes. Unless you think that’s gonna put you in Nat’s good books?”
He closed his eyes for a moment.
The warm feeling lasted for approximately ten seconds before the implications hit him: they’d all gathered, and so they’d all be in Wakanda when he arrived. All of them gathered in one place, and evidently able to do so without splitting into camps, without falling into violence -
. “It is just that… you remind me of someone.”
After a moment, Tony’s arms tightened. “OK,” he whispered. “You win. I’ll stay.”
OK. He's a
“I don’t need any medication, and you didn't answer my question,” he demands instead, hating himself a little. He knows it's weak. He's sat on the floor, Rogers carefully keeping him upright, and DUM-E is already wheeling over to try to investigate if he's OK. He has one hand tangled in the soft cotton of Rogers’s T-shirt, and the other is clutching a meaty bicep.
Oh, Christ. “He thought you were trying to hurt me,” he said slowly, horror dawning. He hadn’t dreamed it, then, the child screaming and screaming… And then they’d left him with Barnes, while Steve’s only constant in this strange, terrifying new world was taken away. “Christ, Barton.” He stroked a hand over Steve’s head, noting the tear marks on his cheeks and deep circles under his eyes. The poor kid must have been scared half to death.
Rhodey looked sceptical. “They didn’t have one open before?”
Tony thought.
It took almost ten minutes of the push and pull, of the swordsman’s power testing the bracelets and Wanda tightening her grip on him. It wasn’t just raw power that was at stake, of course; they didn’t want him incapacitated if they could use him. They just wanted him… contained. Wrapped up tight inside the dampeners, held and contained and
1) Shuri's amazing lab was trashed completely in Black Panther, so although there is still advanced tech throughout Wakanda, it's not as miraculous as we saw in the film until the lab is re-made.
“Ah. I do have some inkling of it, yes. But I dislike having to guess.”
Tony got to his feet smartly. “Your majesty. Haven’t seen you for a while.” He stopped just shy of accusing T’Challa of avoiding him.
(He didn’t want to do that again. He didn’t want to pretend anymore that those he lo- cared about were still in his life.)
Silently, the two of them exited, leaving the others behind. Tony looked at Shuri. “Princess. Do I want to know?”
. “In ancient times, in a far-away country called England, there lived a boy called Arthur,” he started, his voice soft and low. “Arthur was the son of the king. But some bad men wanted to hurt Arthur, so he was sent far away to live with the king’s best friend - this OK?”
Steve had said indignantly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Something in his tone of voice seemed to make Rhodey frown in concern. He leaned forward, filling the screen. “Hey, I took you in, didn’t I? That worked out OK.”
price, then. Not just one that he can't pay; one that he can't convince others to pay on his behalf, either. Oh, Tony’s not going down the route of having Captain fucking America rob Peter to pay Paul. (Or indebt himself to T’Challa to get this from Tony.) No: with a price this high, there's no hiding it.
Rhodey smiled. “Well… no promises, but their initial assessment seems to be that there’s definitely some improvements they can eke out. The damage doesn’t get too severe until the sacral spinal cord, so…” Colour flooded his cheeks. “Well, they think - you know. With a couple of procedures, I might be able to get rid of the catheter.”
After a long moment, Natasha seemed to relax infinitesimally. “All right. I understand.” She stood up as Tony did, and waited for him to offer his hand. “Good luck, Tony,” she said, her tone even, clasping both her hands around his, squeezing gently. “I will stay in touch.” She hesitated, then quickly reached up and pressed a kiss to his cheek as he stared at her, startled. She stepped back, reddening slightly, then tipped a small smile down at Steve, and bent to embrace him as well. “And you, Steve. Stay well.”
He’d always thought Steve too young for everything put on his shoulders - had thought him ill-prepared and too green for it, for all that he’d survived combat - and now, in this state…
So my headcanon for why Rhodey isn't magically healed by the Wakandan tech is that:
She sighed. “Tony. Seriously. What’s going on?”
Tony thought, and it was a knife between his ribs. “Of course I like you,” he said, tightening his arms around Steve’s thin frame. “I just… I’m not quite sure if the feeling is mutual.”
You went after a seven year old with a fucking sword, so you do not get the benefit of any doubt. You get to lay out everything you know,
Barton’s smile got wider. “As it turns out, Amazon Prime delivers to Jabariland. Who knew?”
“I’ve learned not to take any of that for granted,” Romanoff said, in the air of one imparting great wisdom, laughing a little as Tony rolled his eyes in response. “Besides,” she said reasonably, “that, and his pop culture knowledge - thanks for that, by the way - gives us a useful lever.”
“FRIDAY,” Tony says again, and runs out of words. He grits his teeth.
Tony looked away. “What, I can’t just call my sugar plum and check on his dick?”
come out and accused Wilson of blaming him and Steve for Rhodey’s injury, but…
Romanoff tapped at the screen. “Attack number four was where things got interesting.” Everyone leaned forward at that one, staring at the little dot flashing over Moscow. “The Moscow attack resulted in twelve dead, and one survivor,” Romanoff said quietly. The image on the right changed from the Interpol case file to a video of a small blonde-haired boy, clearly in a hospital bed, talking quietly into the camera. “
; you made me sign the damn papers so if you think I’m just going to hand him over -”
always
“... thanks.” Tony managed a smile, surprise melting through him. “I mean - yeah. I appreciate it. I think this is the best shot we have, but… thanks.” It was something to bear in mind, maybe. That not everyone was falling into line behind Barnes on this.
"FRIDAY, take a note, to be delivered in the event of my incursion being detected - I, Tony Stark, being of sound mind and - okay, you know what, that sounds like a will. Scrap that." He closed the briefing pack and tossed the tablet on the nearest chair, heading for the door. "I'll think of something on the way."
Before he knew what he was doing, Tony activated the repulsors, barrelling through the portal in the split-second before it closed.
Romanoff raised an eyebrow at him. “I really have no interest in any schoolmarm fantasies you may have, Tony; that’s between you and your confessor,” she said crisply. She called up the screen again, and a world map came up with red dots picked out across it. One of the dots was on the location of the south Ossetia base. “I’ll be brief. We’ve had an unexpected breakthrough in the last few hours, which leads us to believe that this incident was not an isolated one. Similar events have occurred across six other locations over the last four weeks. There are indications that further events are forthcoming, and we therefore have a tight deadline on this.” She tapped at the screen and the locations flashed, a date appearing beside each of them.

. With an effort, Tony swung his legs over the side of the bed, struggling with the medical gown - when the hell had he been put in the gown and where the hell was his undersuit? He fucking hated hospitals, and not just because of their tendency to pilfer - oh, there it was, tucked under the bed. Well. Well, okay… “I need to see him.” He managed to get himself upright, leaning heavily on the arm of Rhodey’s wheelchair. “Where -”

“They don’t know what else to do,” Rhodey says quietly. “They were talking about a check-in for the survivors, but… there’s a high risk that they’ll miss the most vulnerable. The homeless, the elderly, the abused. This way is slower, but at least they won’t… they won’t...” He’s looking down at his own list, one much longer than yours. (You have Bucky on your list, and Sam, but Clint had arrived - thank god, thank
But his eyes were already closed, sleep dragging him under, Steve a warm and comforting weight against his chest.
“Yeah, but Wanda and Barnes are also here, so…” Barton shrugged. “The others don’t need me right now, they have it in hand. Dr Foster has a theory and we’re waiting to see if it pans out; there’s a whole lot of waiting until then. And I figured the two of you needed a friendly face.”
Sleep had not been an easy commodity to come by, recently. Not with everything that had happened.
The king looked away for a moment. “Dr Stark, I do not mean to presume, but I feel that I should clear up some misapprehensions on your part with respect to your teammates.”
Pepper had said to Tony in the aftermath of the bombing, of Berlin, of
“Give me a minute.” There was strain in Wanda’s voice, her hands clenched. Her own bracelet sat open on the table in front of her, inert, as she focused.
Tony closed his eyes, forcing his hand to open. He breathed deep, the pebble sitting fat and heavy in the centre of his palm. “Resume playback.”
Tony said, hoarse. He clenched his fists.
- “Yeah, if - if you’re up to a little trip, Barton.”
So yeah, it was entirely possible that Nat’s position had been laid bare for him. He just couldn’t bring himself to taker her word on it, no matter how appealing it might have been to think that she was just looking out for them.
Hadn’t Tony made his own promises? Hadn’t he promised Steve, again and again, that he’d do everything he could? That he’d look after him, that he’d keep him safe?
OK?” He shook Tony’s arm slightly to underscore his point, then let go. He forced a wide smile on his face. “Capisce?”
,” he wailed, and that seemed to be what threw open the floodgates. He sobbed as if his world had ended, his arms wrapped around his thin chest in a vain effort to - what? Stop? Or - and Tony’s heart sank - or to comfort himself, because he'd already figured out that the strange man he was with wasn't going to be any help on that front.
Peggy would have known what to do. She would have known what to say to fix this, to keep them both safe.
Rogers’s complexion goes from healthy farm-boy to bloodless corpse in a matter of moments. “Rhodes.” His back straightens, as if readying himself for an execution.
And Tony… Tony was done trusting her judgement. For the good of the team; sure. For Rogers’s sake; absolutely. But for Tony’s sake, for Tony’s well-being? No, he knew exactly where he ranked on her priority list.
But no, that made no sense. Tony wasn't doing 'this', whatever 'this' was. No, it was just... it was just…
“My institutions are
That’s… not what he’d meant at all.
Tony thought, and looked at her sharply. “What’s so funny?”
Well, there were two equally gruesome possibilities.
He didn’t want Barnes touching him. He didn’t want Barnes that close, as if he could
He’d done that before, when things had been bad. In the weeks after his parents had died, he’d laid in bed and closed his eyes and told himself that as long as he didn’t get up, as long as he didn’t have to speak to anyone else, there was nothing different in his world.
They walked out together, heading back down the corridor towards the smell of blood.
Tony didn’t fight the glass of water or the painkillers, accepting them both with a grimace. “What’s going on? I remember the attack - sort of - and then arriving at the mountain.” The giant mountain guy, he remembered him as well. Shit, maybe he really
He raised a hand to his chest, rubbing absentmindedly at the ache there.
Tony coloured a little at that, looking down at Steve.
Tony held up a hand. “Don’t. Just - don’t.”
He dreamed.
“OK, sure, but… I don’t get why any of it was necessary. Why do they need Steve? If they needed an irradiated body, why not use corpse number twenty-eight? Or, hell, just make a few more corpses? And if it was something specific about Steve’s blood, there are now samples of it from here to fucking
OK, in retrospect, the fact that Barton wasn’t allowed to smack him in the head quite clearly didn’t prevent him from pinching Tony in places no man should be pinched. He totally should have seen that one coming.
Which was something that Tony had been wondering about himself. He could explain a few days away as a business meeting, but… “What exactly would explain me being out of the country for any length of - oh, you are kidding me! Rhodey, seriously?
he reasoned.
“Hey, come on, now. Come on.” Tony awkwardly gathered up the bundled child in his arms, easing the bedlinen away from his red and blotchy face. “Covering your face up like that won’t help your breathing. Come on, now.”
A hand landed over Tony's, squeezing gently. Tony didn't notice.
And on that note… “Okay, then, let’s go meet your designated torturer.”
“You drank kale shakes back at the Tower, Tony, OK? You drank shakes made out of
“Back home?” Steve brightened so much it was almost painful to watch. He sat up and hugged his knees, suddenly wide awake.
“I’ll bet.” He shook his head. It was uncanny. Barnes looked exactly like - but that made sense. No one memorable, no one who was known to be an employee of Stark Industries, but if there was a question raised around the identity of Tony’s new bodyguard, doubtless all any digging would turn up was that an ex-bodyguard had been re-hired. Tony would bet his eye-teeth that his employment would be backdated to before Tony ever left US soil.
Tony cleared his throat, trying to get his thoughts in order. A few hours ago, they’d had nothing. This wasn’t something they’d found from reviewing the security footage leading up the attack. Where had the information come from? “And how is it that you just
“Tony?”
translated roughly into,
He fled without waiting for an answer, grabbing the discarded knife and practically running down the corridor.
a voice said, and Tony looked down at his open chest, at the smashed reactor and exposed muscle.
Well, maybe the events of the last few days were to blame for Tony not catching on more quickly. He felt himself flush. “Yes, of course,” he murmured.
Tony stared at the screen, not answering.
, he thought, irritable.
“I want to take him to the US,” Tony said; a statement, not a question. He had more to say -
The source of the sound - a small boy, bare-legged and dwarfed by the Captain America upper body armour - peered tearfully out from beneath one of the discarded doors. He was blue-lipped, almost frozen.
All of a sudden, he got it, what had Rhodey so happy. His knees suddenly felt weak with relief. “Rhodey. Thank God.

Steve shrank away from his expression, hiding behind Tony again.
Tony stared at Hill for a long moment, unsmiling. “Hi there.”
birthday.” He held up his arms to demonstrate the immensity of the occasion, narrowly escaping clouting Tony about the head in his enthusiasm. “
“You're not.” Rhodey’s voice was sharp. “Tony, I love you, but you need to stop thinking your opinion is the deciding one, here. T’Challa explained the situation, and I agreed to come over. And yeah, I get a bonus medical consult with the brightest minds of the most advanced nation in the world as a side perk. Either one of those reasons would have been enough to guarantee my attendance. Both of them at the same time? It's a no-brainer, Tones.”
“Still not sorry,” Tony said, and activated the boot repulsors, aiming for the open sky above, Steve held safely in his arms.
“Feel free to try,” Barton sniped. “The moment you build me a faster plane, I will fly it, but until then,
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony held up a finger. “Hold that thought.”
Tony thought. For all that Barnes had clearly taken Tony’s earlier words to heart and was trying to connect with Steve, seeing him in this state was probably not doing his mental state any favours. A little too familiar to the face in his memories, and yet completely uninterested in being best buds; that was bound to be both confusing and painful.
His mouth was dry. “I know that.”
Rhodey shakes his head. “With him, I think they’ll force the full seven years.”
Of course he wouldn’t have reacted well to being held or strapped down; Tony knew his nightmares well enough to know exactly what he would have flashed back to. “What happened?”
He bit his lip and looked down.
A tiny nod, almost invisible against Tony’s shoulder.
“And…”
Psychiatrist, social care worker, SVU investigator, whatever - someone who’d know what to do with him.
He was -
Barton had the grace to look away at that. “I thought it was a bad idea, and I still do,” he muttered. “I argued against it. I wanted to tell you; Christ, Tony, you have to believe that. But you’d just had fucking brain surgery! I knew if I said something you’d be trying to get into the suit, and -”
One elegant shoulder rose and fell. “What happened didn’t happen because the universe - or anyone else - has it out for you, Tony. Anymore than what’s happening now is a giant conspiracy to endanger Steve. Sometimes, sometimes…” She bit her lip. “Sometimes, people get it wrong. Sometimes they screw up. Sometimes
Telling Steve was infinitely harder.
Don't fly after surgery, kids. Seriously, don't. (Yes, Sam is on the team going off to find the child-killer. No, this isn't a fun time for Sam or for Rhodey.)
the child’s.” She locked gazes with Natasha.
“I need your help,” T’Challa said without any preamble. “Captain Rogers has been off the grid for twelve hours, and he missed his designated check-in four hours ago. We have been unable to get in contact, and I fear that he may need assistance.”
Barton gave him the finger and reached out his other hand, activating the pebble, effectively silencing any riposte.
And that, it appeared, was that. T’Challa left, taking the scary general away with him, Barnes following with Maximoff at his heels. Presumably they’d be in contact later to arrange - oh
Steve made a distressed sound and cuddled closer in sleep. Tony’s arms tightened around him. “How much longer?”
a small, poisonous voice inside Tony said,
He should have known better. Dammit, he should have known better! It was human nature, and it’s not like he was above it himself. Wouldn’t he trade Barnes, Maximoff, Lang, the whole fucking lot of them, for just ten more minutes with his mom? Wouldn’t he trade them all for the chance to bring back those he loved?
There was an even longer hesitation. “Deal,” Steve said finally. His nose scrunched up. “I saw it, anyway. Don’t need to see it again.”
A corner of Rhodey’s mouth twitched. “I’m tempted to make you say it, asshole.”
“Stay safe,” she said. She seemed to be debating something internally, then suddenly stepped forward and embraced him. She let go of Tony - who had been too startled to move - then knelt down and wrapped her arms around Steve briefly. “You too,” she murmured, and kissed his forehead.
A sweetly poisonous voice inside Tony asked.
The glowy shield flashed bright across Tony’s vision as it moved - confusingly, incomprehensibly - from being on Tony’s right side, below him, to suddenly being on his left, and above him. It came down, once, twice, the impact across the HUD sharp and jarring, making Tony see stars as his head rang. The shield lifted for a third time, and started to come down - the edge, this time, sharp as any knife - heading unerringly towards the vulnerable eye-slits in the face-plate.
The child folded himself into his arms.
OK. Who the hell did Barton think he was, to hold him down when Tony didn’t want to be held down? When - when -
“Huh.” Barton glanced over his shoulder furtively. “So this Hong Kong temple…”
She held up her teacup in a mock-salute and settled back at the table, Barton sliding into the empty seat beside her. “Take your time.”
Tony wanted to ask,
God, Tony had missed him. “Rhodey,” he exhaled, almost a laugh. He fought the urge to drop his face in his hands. He was so
Wilson came back into the room, pushing a wheelchair. “Come on, then, sleeping beauty, let’s go see your shrunken prince,” he said with only minimal sarcasm. He patted the wheelchair seat.
Pepper squinted at him and said nothing. Tony had the uncomfortable feeling that she knew he was pulling this out of his ass. He opened his mouth to fill the awkward silence.
He hadn’t wanted to wait until later in the day. It was nearly noon already; for all that they were flying west-wards, they’d need to get going soon unless they wanted to fly through the night. (Tony really, really didn’t want to fly through the night with a scared child, having done that once already.)
to greet me when I arrive.”
Rhodey laughed. “Bet you never thought you’d be saying that about another guy’s dick.”
Tony really was wishing they’d tied up and gagged the guy and left him in the fucking hold. He could see Wanda stiffen in her seat, very pointedly
“Her Royal Highness Princess Shuri relayed her compliments, and has issued an invitation for you and your ward to join her at your earliest convenience.”
“Thank you,” Tony said again, putting the tablet down on the coffee table and offering his hand to shake.
Lang made a sceptical noise. “Sorry to butt in,” the guy really needed to quit apologising for his existence, Tony thought with exasperation, “but is unshrinking the Cap really the priority right now? Mr Stark seems to have a handle on things with him, and - well, whoever turned that base into an abattoir wasn’t kidding around. Don’t we need everyone on this?”
Tony sprawled down next to him, feeling exhausted already. “We’re going on a field trip.” He looked at where Steve was still busily making green handprints on the paper (and the table), not having noticed him yet. “How was he?”
Barton shrugged. “The others are already tracking down all the available leads. Well, OK, in between helping out where needed - there’s this thing in northern Burkina Faso, near Gorom-Gorom, and - Anyway, neither one of you is in any fit state to defend yourselves, so…”
Tony thought, appalled. And again, the shame hit. Because if Wanda was too young, then so was Peter. And Tony had barely hesitated before bringing him in.
“Well,” Tony said weakly, staring, “in my defence -” - he was probably hallucinating, because surely no one was that big without some serum enhancement. The guy was - in a word -
“Oh, I do want to,” Steve said, his eyes wide, his words coming in a torrent, as if he couldn’t - quite - keep them all back. “I really tried, I swear I did, I tried really hard! But I
“Wake up,” Barton said, and Tony flailed awake again.
“Fri?”
“Wake up, Stark. Stark!”
(He doesn’t know what to do.)
“Everything’s fine, Stark.” Wilson smiled tiredly. “I’ll get Jim to call you once he’s rested up a bit. You guys doing OK over there?”
Tony hated it when she did that. He had a vague inkling that she tended to do it when she felt vulnerable, which would hint at her being genuinely worried about him. That said, he had no illusions about her own awareness of her tells. It could be a double-bluff. “Anyway. We’ll stay in touch, obviously, but - look, guys, and I can’t believe I’m echoing Lang here, but this isn’t a discussion. Steve and I are heading out in ten - no, eight - minutes, so…” He spread his hands. “This was more by way of a ‘can’t stay for dinner’ message.”
Hill gave him what could only be described as the stink-eye. “Also, Ross called.”
“Yeah. Good to see you.” They shook hands briefly. Hill raised an eyebrow at Barnes. “And you must be… Tony’s old bodyguard. Ms Potts mentioned you’d rejoined the team. Joe, right?”
Steve looked up at him and nodded. He was dressed in his thin pyjamas, his feet bare. His lips were already starting to turn blue from the cold.
He checked the clock. It was gone seven; Steve would need feeding before long. He stuck his head around the bedroom door. “Hey kiddo, how’s that packing going? You all ready?”
Really, he had no one to blame for the resulting smack but himself.

“Oh, shut up, Rhodey,” Tony said, irritable. “Don’t you even start.”
“I can’t do this,” Tony heard himself say, as if from far away, and his hand tightened around the pebble, terminating the playback.
turned out,” Tony muttered. His free hand rose to rub at his sternum unconsciously.
“FRIDAY, suit.” The suit assembled around him as he hurried back into the bedroom and carefully caught hold of the sleeping Steve. “Kid, wake up. Come on, Steve, I need you to wake up now.”
“Damn you,” Tony whispered. His voice caught on the sob. “This isn’t fair, it isn’t
“Are you
Wilson stared at him. “Well, she gave them to you.”
“Not keen on life under ISIS, probably,” Tony prompted gently. His thumb stroked gently over the back of Rhodey’s hand.
A small voice asked, and he quashed the thought ruthlessly. No. This wasn’t a Lovecraftian horror; there were no Old Gods to placate with a blood sacrifice.
“If we catch him.”
“That still splits us into two,” Romanoff noted. “Tony and Rhodey need to remain here, as do Wanda and Bucky. My suggestion is that everyone else,” she inclined her head towards T’Challa, “including you, your majesty, if you can spare the time, work on the bigger threat.”
Tony looked around the room and suppressed a smile.
He’d hoped… but no, it was too much to ask for. He closed his eyes and dug the heels of his hands against them, trying to blot out the image that immediately sprung up.
“Stand down, Stark,” M’Baku growled, and closed one large hand around Mordo’s bicep. “He is not going anywhere without a guard. We are in control, here. There is no need for panic.”
Tony had said, because it had been the only thing
Comments are love.
Finally, I've added Black Panther as a fandom tag but haven't added any characters other than T'Challa (yet). I'm adding character tags only when they've had sufficient page time. But I'm really pleased that this fic should fit - with only tiny little tweaks - shortly after the Black Panther film takes place, and I can start to use some of the wonderful characters we met, in particular Okoye.
Barton returned a few minutes later with an armful of sniffling child. “Mister!” The kid sobbed, and more or less flung himself at Tony. Only Barton’s steel hold on him prevented him from landing on Tony’s chest, face-first. Instead he was lowered gently to Tony’s side so he could crawl up to wrap an arm around Tony’s neck, Barton’s admonishment to be gentle going unheard. He looked up at Tony, disconsolate, face streaked with tears and snot. “You’re alive!” His voice was shaky with hiccuped sobs.
Tony thought. If Wilson had snuck back into the US, it made sense that he’d head back to the area he knew best. And if he was going back for someone… it would explain why he’d split with Rogers, even with that whole hero-worship thing going on. If he had someone to get home to...
But the flaw in Tony's reasoning (and what Steve is fixating on) is that he believes he would always be able to trust the morality and ethical integrity of those making those decisions, at least more than he trusts his own. Whereas Mordo is saying that the most learned of the sorcerers would not only agree with him, but that he could have gathered them all up in an army and turned up that way. So, that should have been the end of it, right? The experts, who understand all the stakes, who are willing to make that call, say that Tony has to hand Steve over, and... well, Tony knows himself enough to wonder whether he'd do so, or whether he'd take one look at that unanimous vote and say,
just one fucking
Parts of the call with Rhodey were originally planned for earlier in the fic but I needed to give him a bit more time in recovery. I wanted to give him some tangible gains from the surgery, but we know that canonically that he is still using the braces later on so obviously he couldn't have all the damage repaired. But he should be mostly recovered from surgery - certainly enough to be in the room having opinions, even if he's not well enough to be back in the suit yet - so that adds him and Sam back in the mix. I took my guidance on Rhodey's reactions from a variety of websites re: the mental impact of life-changing events, but would welcome input from anyone better informed, especially if I've managed to get it completely wrong.
Tony reached out and grabbed hold of the little hands, holding them against Steve’s side. “I just meant, we can get you something you’d like,” he said, forcing a little bit of gentleness into his voice. “But you don’t have to give this back, it’s yours as well.” Of course Steve would assume the clothes were a loan, the kid had grown up underfed and sickly, raised by a single mother with limited means. Doctors were only when someone got ‘real sick’. “We can get you anything you’d like.” He let go, then patted Steve’s shoulder cautiously.
“I have thirty-two dead guards who would disagree with that statement,” T’Challa said, his voice eminently reasonable. “Who are you, and what do you want with the child? I will not ask again.” At that, M’Baku shifted silently from foot to foot.
“Yeah,” Tony said into Steve’s hair, trying to peel the kid away from where he was plastered against his side. “He’s been turned into a munchkin. Maybe six years old?”
“You said we were friends,” Steve sobbed, his whole body shaking. “You said it, but you don’t like me at all!”
Not much in the way of story notes this time out. I spent a good month or so going back and forth on who would accompany Tony when he went back to the US. Tony's main allies were deliberately unavailable, and I knew that Barnes would have to be along as keeping Steve safe would require some serious fire-power, but the question of Barton went all around the houses before he finally muscled his way in and said that he was doing it, so that was that. (I'd originally intended Scott to want to go back to SF so he could see his family. But actually having him stay away for that little bit longer makes more sense IMO as this fic is set immediately after Black Panther in terms of timeline.)
he said, soft and ashamed, almost inaudible.
he had said, as if he acknowledged the weight of what he had tried to do, and yet would do it again at the first opportunity.
“Lunchtime. We’re going to chase the sun all the way out to California. How’s that sound?” He laughed at the way Steve’s eyes widened and pointed at the little table in the living room corner where he’d placed the breakfast tray delivered earlier. “Go on, time for food first, and then we’ll go say our goodbyes.” He thought for a moment. He really wasn’t looking forward to that conversation.
“Steve,” he managed. His vision was almost entirely gone, now, and the cold was fast receding as well. “And I’m not swooning, I’m just, I’m just -”
Coney Island Boardwalk opening in 1923, so it's perfectly feasible - at least in theory - for a poor family in the mid-20s to have made a special birthday trip out there to partake of the amusements.
"Four hours, baby girl. Not a moment earlier." He wasn't going to have Vision unavailable in the event of a major attack for nothing other than a poor cellphone signal.
Not for the first time during the call, Tony wondered whether it was a good idea to share what had happened outside of their immediate circle. But if the last few months - OK, years - had taught him anything, it was that secrets had a way of getting out, and that if you sat on them too long, they tended to blow up from underneath you. And Tony really, really didn’t want to find out what would happen if both teams (deployed and Wakanda-based) were somehow incapacitated; or, worse, if T’Challa was injured or killed.
No, Tony wasn’t father material. (No matter if he might have - once - wished otherwise.) It was probably for the best. Who’d trust him to raise a child, anyway? He smoothed Steve’s hair back from his face, smiling at the instinctive squirmy wriggle this prompted. “He’s not mine.”
Hell on earth. Why didn’t I think of that? I mean, it’s not like any of this is verifiable, right?” What the hell kind of creature was this Umar, if this guy was likening running into her to an encounter with a
Some references to child death.
“A concussion would likely be an improvement,” Rhodey muttered. He leaned back in the chair, narrowing his eyes at Tony. “This is… not the best time for this conversation.”
“You certainly smell like it,” Barton muttered, but he brought the coffee over and sat back down at the table.
, but he couldn’t do anything. There wasn’t enough room in his head for him, and the thing-that-wasn’t-him was still there, still trying to cocoon him in softness, and he shoved harder at it, almost frantic.
“Yeah, OK. Thanks.” He wasn’t sure what to do with the advice, admittedly, but he did appreciate Wilson
Something - someone? - moved in his peripheral vision and he flinched instinctively.
Then having a kid who looked like his BFF telling him that he wasn’t Bucky Barnes was probably going to do a number on him.
!” There was something frantic in the way he said that, the cup of ice chips clattering, Barton’s eyes wide as if bracing himself against the possibility of it, as if even saying it could make it true.
What were his options, really? He could let things take their course, letting the child be buffeted by the various forces exerted on him. Mordo might have a way of fighting Umar, and Steve might be a weapon in that - or he might not. Wanda might figure out a way to turn Steve back if Tony let her get close enough (
T’Challa cleared his throat noisily and Tony managed to snap his mouth shut over whatever else wanted to spill out.
“Wow, that’s a lot of… red.” It looked like someone had bled Avengers all over the kid.
Okoye says, "Good evening. Do you speak English?" in Cantonese. Again, I am reliant on phrasebooks so if I got it wrong, please let me know. The
“I figure I can protect Steve more effectively when I’m not in a crippled suit.” Tony stared back at her. “Legolas and the murderbot are no lightweights in the carnage department, either. And I also figured you guys might keep an eye on the West Coast. You know, just in case.”
The swordsman actually laughed at that. “You seem a decent fellow, Mr Stark. I hate to kill you.”
The small face scrunched up in thought, the knife wavering. “I don't know you. And I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.”
And Wilson… well, Wilson had his own beef with Steve, and that beef was probably Rhodey-shaped.
“Spit it out, Barton,” Tony said tiredly. “I’m really not in the mood to play the brain damaged idiot any longer.”
Tony thought through the sick feeling in his stomach.
say. And because, because -
please,
He hears Rogers sigh a little as he turns towards the door. “Tony,” Rogers says and then pauses. His whole body is rigid, as if braced for a blow. “Uh… if there isn't anything to be done...”
Okay, now was probably not the best time to get into that. He needed to check on the kid first, and then he’d corner Rhodey and -
Tony dug the heels of his hands into his eyes, groaning at the pressure. “What’s the score? FRIDAY didn’t give me much before we were sent to the Lonely Mountain and Apollo Creed’s welcoming committee. I thought this was meant to be a safehouse?”
“I did nothing.” He reached up and wrapped both hands around the gauntlet. “Let go of me.” When Tony did not, his expression hardened, the familiar golden spark of his magic flickering around his wrists. “I did not harm any of them. I could have, and I did not. Let
Well, if the young princess had someone as sensible as T’Challa looking out for her, he was sure she’d have a better time of it than he had. Especially if T’Challa’s view of ‘suitable company’ had thrown her in the way of Jane Foster.

but no, that was the selfish, hurt part of him talking. Rhodey needed

At the front of the room Barton just face-palmed. “Yeah, this is gonna go
The mountains, much as the snowy preview had promised, turned out to be fucking freezing.
It would have been Barton against, Tony realised, Barnes for, and then which way would the rest of them have split? He’d bet his eyeteeth they hadn’t told Rhodey, because if he’d known, he would have been contact. Hell, he would have been
Beside him, Romanoff gave a small sigh and took the chair to his right, reaching under the table to pat him on the thigh.
And... well, it might be a bit of a crutch, but he needed to do something before he was ready to face it. “I’m going to make another call, I’ll be right back. Do
He’d bet his bottom dollar that Barton had suggested it as a topic to the kid.
A flight course was laid out for him, away from the palace and towards the mountains just barely visible in the distance.
Between them, Happy and Pepper had managed to hit more or less every point he’d hoped he would be able to skirt over. And this one… well, it hadn’t been a pleasant negotiation, and he was still of two minds about it. How would they react, knowing what they did? He winced. “Um…”
“Vis, take Steve, will you? We need to meet with -” Romanoff looked down at Steve, still half-hidden behind Tony, “with the King.”
She nodded. “And I just wanted to stop being afraid. I never wanted -” She held up her wrist, displaying the bracelet. “I just - I wanted to show you this. I asked the Princess for it. I described what the collar had done, and I asked for… it doesn’t…” She shook her head frustrated. “I’m not telling it right. I just wanted to tell you that you don’t have to be afraid.” She touched the sleek metal of the bracelet gently, tracing the elegant curl of the design etched into it. “It’s not like the collar. It doesn’t hurt. And I - I chose it. I asked the Princess to make it so that… So it’s…”
No, Barton had a copy of the data Tony had gathered on the bodies and the arrangement of the limbs.  He could handle it. Tony could just send through anything relevant the doctors found in their examination of the kid and…
“Close the door on your way out,” he says abruptly, attention back on the worktop screensaver. (Not that Rogers will know it's a screensaver. For all he knows, it's a new weapons system.)
“Oh, hey now. Hey, there's no need to cry,” he tried desperately, scooting across to awkwardly pat Steve on the back and nearly toppling him over. Christ, the kid was a stick. He could probably pick him up, he certainly looked small enough… Gingerly, ready to drop him if he so much as made a peep of discomfort, Tony reached into the suit and gathered Steve up in his arms. “There, now,” he tried again, passing a hand over Steve’s back. He could feel the press of ribs against his fingers, and he shivered. Too thin, too fucking thin… “I’m sorry I yelled. I didn’t mean it. It's going to be okay.”
For a moment, Rhodey and Tony stared at each other over the kid’s head. Then, “wow, he sure is the spitting image of his older self, huh? I’m gonna leave this one in your capable hands, Tones; don’t worry, I’ll check in with Pep for you -”
But instead, instead…
“The fifth attack was in Volgograd, another thirteen dead. The sixth was in Ossetia.” She tapped the screen, and a seventh dot appeared, hovering over Tajikistan. “The seventh was yesterday, in Dushanbe. Twenty three dead.” Images flashed through on the right-hand side: close-ups of the bodies of the victims, of the writing on the walls, of the limbs and entrails carefully arranged.
Something he would do again, without hesitation.
Had forcing him to see Steve’s nightmares been her own attempt to force a detente, or had it simply been an attempt to ‘correct’ his nightmares?
Barton was frowning. “You said he’s not sleeping well, but he’s slept a lot. Like - a
his HEAT instructor had told him when Tony had first started doing visits to fun places like Iraq and Afghanistan.
No wonder the FAC Chair was spitting nails. The sub’s financials may have been at arms-length, but they still produced group accounts for the time being. It didn’t look good however you looked at it. “What does Pepper say?” He could see Barton side-eyeing him and wondered what he was making of the whole conversation.
Maximoff seemed similarly spooked. “No - I am imposing, I should -” She scrambled to her feet and backed away. “Um - let me know when - if - you want me to try to undo the magic - I mean - just - let me know -”
The doctor stood, slotting the tablet against the foot of the bed. “OK, well, I’ll leave you in the therapist’s capable hands. Agent Barton, you’ll be around, yes?”
Okoye gave a stiff nod. “We are reviewing all security footage from all of the previous attacks,” she said. “Now that we know we are looking for a woman, one who has been at all sites, it may lead to visual identification.”
At Steve’s enthusiastic nod, he got to his feet.
? When did that happen? I wasn't aware I
Steve nodded numbly, staring up at Tony as he closed down the face-plate and ran back out.
“What will you do, if the link between the two of them re-establishes itself?”
“Tony -”
... Fuck. He’d take literally
“Your teammates,” T'Challa continued without pause, talking over Tony, “did not stay in Wakanda for longer than a few hours. They came here to safely deliver Ms Maximoff. And then they departed.”
Tony stared at him mulishly and stayed silent.
like me.”
Because - stretched out on the child-sized bed - was Steve, looking even paler than he had been during the flight over. There was a mask over his face, an IV catheter in his arm, and another trailing away from underneath his gown.
“Oh, piss off,” Rhodey laughed, that dimple back again. He made a rude gesture with one hand. “Go look after that kid. I’ll keep things under control here.”
God, he was tired. He’d just close his eyes for a little bit, and…
An army convinced it was right, fighting for what they believed was the greater good. The thing that would spare the world untold horrors.
of it are green. Those are avocado. The orange bits are mango. And the red bits are some sort of local berry.”
if nothing else, Rhodey had managed to get that one lesson hammered into him by graduation.
He couldn’t move, and Barnes was here, and there was someone with him - someone helpless, someone he had to protect - and he couldn’t move, and
Comments are love.
Comments are always appreciated.
Because it's one thing to have those in charge make a call that you disagree with, but you can live with. It's another to have that call be a nuke dropped on NYC, or a sacrifice of a child, or something equally morally abhorrent. And maybe that morally abhorrent choice is the right one (and I definitely had thoughts re: Cabin the Woods here, where I spent the entire ending yelling "Are you kidding me???" at the screen). (See also Buffy's admirable and yet entirely ridiculous choice to protect Dawn when the world was ending - it's entirely understandable. And if Giles had hit her over the head and then wrung Dawn's neck, I'd understand
Steve looked up from examining his new sneakers, with their red base, gold laces and triumphant Iron Man motifs. “My shoes have your armour on them,” he said solemnly. He still had a rasp to his voice, and the mask was hanging loosely on an adjustable strap around his neck, but at least the nebuliser had been switched out to a portable one in the form of a kid-sized backpack. Someone had clearly given him a bath before getting him all ready because he was clean and his hair had been neatly combed to one side.
Whatever Rogers wanted to say could wait.
“How d’you think M’Baku got you down here, anyway?” Barton picked idly at his nails as the doctor left the discharge papers on the desk and exited. As the door closed behind her he shifted a little, moving up off the door frame so that he was blocking the door more effectively.
“Well,” Rhodey said, smiling a little, “It’s not actually a lie. If anyone digs deep enough, all they'll get are my medical records.”
He should have said something to Barton about that at the time. Hell, Fury should have, or Steve, or… well,
He left Rhodey to make small-talk and hurried back into the sleeping area. Steve had managed a couple of hours of sleep, and his meds must be about due in any case.
Which… no. “Rhodey, have you had someone spotting you when you’ve been doing these? Back in the US, I mean?” He had a bad feeling about this. Wilson wouldn’t have let Rhodey’s form get this disorderly; no fucking way. And the physio would observe and correct during the sessions, but if Rhodey couldn’t feel what was happening to his hips below a certain point, he’d have no way of knowing his alignment was off when he was doing his exercises at home. Wherever ‘home’ was. (Wilson’s place? Andrews base? He still didn’t have a straight answer.)
. He'd spent a sizable portion of the sixteen days since the break-out looking, and he had no idea whether the lack news meant that Barton himself was with them, or Romanoff. Whether the lack of news was a good sign.)
Tony shook his head to clear it. “I - all right,” Tony said, hating how uncertain he sounded. “I’ll do the physio.” Because, really, what were his options? The Wakandan court had ruled him able to take care of Steve; if he was badly hurt, they could easily rule the other way. And if Steve was with someone else, some
Tony chewed his bottom lip, hesitating. He could tell Wilson, or he could finish the call, but he couldn’t just… “So… hypothetically, if I was to listen to those recordings Nat gave me…”
Tony thought suddenly.
“You should probably think of it as a retirement party,” Barton said, grinning. “They’re just jealous you’re heading off to have babies in the suburbs while the rest of us do the real work.” He shrugged again, then turned and went back to the cockpit and the pilot’s seat.
“I know, Steve. I wish I could fix it for you. But it’s gonna take a little while longer.” He reached out and carefully stroked Steve’s hair back from his face, so it wasn’t hanging in his eyes. “And in the meantime, you’ve been a bit ill, what with running around barefoot in that cold place, so we’re just giving you some medicine to make you all better. OK?” He didn’t know why he was asking. It was not OK at all, obviously; the poor kid must be scared out of his mind, and the hospital set-up was probably not helping.
Because everyone was
Steve looked up at him in wonder as the suit heating elements kicked in, cranked up a little higher than normal to compensate for the open chest plate.
He was in Siberia, and Steve was laughing as he -
OK, maybe she didn’t
Tony stared at him. Whatever he had prepared himself for - whatever atrocity Rhodey might have seen, whatever nightmare might have prompted this - it hadn’t been anything like
Tony covered Steve’s ears with one hand, tucking his head against Tony’s shoulder. “I’m glad that my extreme mental trauma is amusing for you. Anything else you want to poke fun at?”
“Yes, that's - that's exactly right. This is just my armour. It helps me fight bad guys.”
. “I need to see Rhodey walking. You give him that - you help me put that right - then -”
Tony’s vision is almost entirely grey, now, and he can hear his heart thundering in his chest. It's not fast, but it is loud, so loud it almost drowns out the rushing sound in his ears. “The way I see it, your boy - your
So, yeah, he’d sent an encrypted data squirt via FRIDAY, and rousted Pep and Happy from bed. If something went catastrophically wrong, between them, they’d make sure things were taken care of. Themselves, the bots, the company and the staff, the kids and their families -
” He looked back at the closed door behind him - Vision having closed it behind him with pantomimed emphasis - and then back at the screen. “Mr Vision was with me when it happened, and I remember bits of what happened, but not all of it,” he said. He’d shifted so he was too close to the screen, cutting off the top of his head and giving Tony a view of his neck and ears and not much else. “I think Mr Vision was scared, because he went away and didn’t come back again. Miss Natasha is watching me now.” He scooted back down so only his eyes showed, filling the entire screen. “But I do remember, bits of it, I told him all I could.” He seemed to be pleading with Tony to understand that he had done his best, that he had pulled together all the recollections he had of something terrifying; something
Tony's options re: Steve and the US are fairly numerous actually, but most of them he wouldn't want to use because it would draw Ross's unwanted attention. Better to just keep below the radar for as long as possible.
“Out of foil?”
No one had a reasonable answer to this. Vision floated a couple of ideas, primarily to do with temporal mechanics, and Romanoff wondered why the temporal event had gone down at the base in the first place - was it the location, or had the attacker needed anything specific that was there? (Of course, there was no footage of the attack itself - the security system had been disabled beforehand.) Wilson thought they should go over the intelligence that Rogers had used in the first place, in case he’d been drawn there by the same thing that had attracted the attacker. (This wasn’t unreasonable, and a small, mean part of Tony was pleased at how surprised Wilson looked when Tony said he agreed.)
Oh, god, it didn’t bear thinking about. Looking after a kid version of Steve was one thing; having to deal with there being no resolution to all that had gone down between them…
Tony just had enough time to think, and his eyes squeezed shut reflexively.
Darkness swamped him, mottled red and black.
,” he said, shouldering his way into Mordo’s personal space, crowding him back against the wall of the quinjet, “just
He resisted the urge to reach back and add to Barton’s headache by thwacking him around the head. It had taken him three hours to go through Dr Foster’s - and Shuri’s - results and conclusions, and nothing in the data set was remotely encouraging. The portals caused significant disturbances to organic matter in the vicinity. The disturbances manifested in radiation signatures, which were, of course, trackable - hence the swordsman’s ability to track Steve down in Birnin Zana. The samples of Steve’s blood collected at the hospital had continued to exhibit those same radiation signatures, and Barton had collected samples from the attack site they had been too late for while Tony had been unconscious - same result. But why the hell was the swordsman after Steve in the first place? What possible use could he have with him that he couldn’t accomplish with any of the other dead, and more easily accessible, victims?
(Not like…)
The look on Tony’s face did not seem to be reassuring; Barton frowned, expression growing more pinched, and looked away.
She looked… older.
Of course, there were also additional home-grown risks he’d have to consider.
He slept.
"Cap? You here?" He called out again. "Steve! Come on, show yourself, Rogers! Steve!"
“What?”
Tony’s smile didn’t waver. “For you, I’m always available.”
he wondered.
mine.”
Tony hoisted him up in his arms, all his earlier resolutions of treading lightly and carefully forgotten in his panic. “Don’t look at it, come on -” He manhandled the small body back down the corridor, ignoring Steve’s vociferous protests the entire way until he was back at the main control room.
Steve looked down at his foot, held firmly in Tony’s grip. “So… if someone steals me…”
A quick investigation of the supply pallets he’d passed on his way in through the base revealed cold weather survival kits clearly pilfered from UNICEF and Medecins Sans Frontieres (they even had the “funded by…” logos, including Stark Industries for one set - they must have been routed through the relief organisation). Survival blanket, one-size-fits-all blanket, a LifeStraw and Plumpy’nut packages. He grimaced at the latter but collected a stack of them, figuring that the kid could probably do with the emergency nutrition. Come to think of it, the adult Steve Rogers would have found the Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food offerings a blessing in disguise; he’d always complained how he couldn’t get enough food post-battle. They’d tried nutrition bars (mostly sugar), protein shakes (impractical, and who the hell had the space to carry them around?) and even baby food (just… no); in the end they’d opted to follow up missions with a trip down to the nearest open restaurant. But something like the RUTFs could probably fill that niche, and get them stable enough to get back to base immediately after alien battles or similar.
Another exhale. “He’s having flashbacks,” Rhodey said, very quietly. “He doesn’t… he can’t sleep from them. His whole day is already tied up with me, and with Rogers, and with everything else. I don’t want him to…. He doesn’t have the space to…” He couldn’t seem to find the words to finish his sentence, instead sinking back down into another stretch.
“Well,” Tony said, gathering the child up and settling him against the suit on his hip, “that’s certainly an elephant right there. I’m impressed. Where’d you see one of those?”
Barton looked up and smiled at her humourlessly. “I’m at your disposal, ma’am. Don’t worry, he so much as sneezes and I’ll get him to a doctor if I have to carry him bridal-style.”
Tony wanted to ask.
wasn’t that how the saying went? As long as he didn’t have to look at it, he wouldn’t be tempted.
It wasn’t as though he was exempting himself from that category; he’d lied plenty to Rhodey and to Pepper, both for their own good and when he couldn’t find the words to make himself understood. He’d lied to his dad compulsively; he’d lied to his teachers, to senators, to
Rhodey closed his mouth and mimed a zipper over his lips.
He powered up the jet as silently as he could, letting FRIDAY take control of the autopilot. “FRI, we may need a quick getaway, get us set up, please.”
Right on cue, the therapist appeared, as if summoned by Tony’s sheer recalcitrance. “Don’t worry, this is the last one,” he said, dropping his bag on the floor beside Tony’s bed and pulling out his tablet. “Then we can move on to personal grooming.”
“You are literally the most annoying man on the planet,” Barton had said in exasperation. “Will you just - stay put for a
Tony blinked after him. Wilson? What was Wilson doing -
Steve watched him with wide eyes.
“And with that attitude, there isn’t a court in the land that would convict me,” Barton snapped. He fed Tony another ice chip with as much passive aggression as he could muster. “Congratulations, you were the first patient at the not-yet-complete Jabariland Clinic. Dhakiya had to scramble a neurosurgical team from Birnin Zana because we couldn’t fucking move you, on account of your brain being turned into Swiss cheese! You’ve been in a medically-induced coma for 24 hours, Tony, we thought you were fucking
Not that he wanted the kid to be sick, of course. When he thought of him as a kid. When he thought of him as a kid, he wanted to go yell at his doctors about upping his meds, or getting him an extra blanket, or maybe arranging for some toys to be delivered to his bedside - not that T’Challa hadn’t already beaten him to that, but anyway. No, when he thought of Steve as a
He glanced across at where Barton was lingering in the doorway with a constipated look on his face.
“He’s fine,” Barton soothed, face pale, pressing him back down. “Rhodey’s fine. Steve’s fine. Everyone else is fine.” He grabbed for the pebble on the little table by the bed, thumbing it until it flashed red. “You just took a bit of a blow to the head, so we’re going to get you checked out, OK?”
The red light came again, the photos melting one by one.
“I am sure the king has good reason to -”
and then Steve was leaning down and kissing him.
Rhodey would tell him to lay down on the wire, if it came down to it, Tony had no hesitation over that. Rhodey would lay down his own life; hell, he’d already made the sacrifice play. Tony had no hesitation over following Rhodey’s orders into doing the same.
“So, how did the grand farewell go?” Barton asked with a raised eyebrow at Tony’s disgruntled expression. He leaned against the wall, arms folded.
He felt a pang of guilt as he thought it. Rogers’s actions had nothing to do with the kid; it wasn’t healthy to lump him in with all that had gone wrong between them. It’s not like the kid had any choice about being there.
He hesitated, then went to check on the suit quickly. It had locked in to the facility coordinates, and FRIDAY would make sure to get it back safely despite all the various knocks it had taken. Still, it didn’t hurt to check. (Knowing his luck, the repulsors would cut out when the suit was over a hotel or tourist group.) “FRIDAY, keep an eye on it, would you please, I don’t want a front page with
Steve was awake and dressed by the time Tony went to collect him, the stack of signed papers from the Family Court of Birnin Zana releasing one Steven Grant Rogers into his temporary custody tucked under one arm, and Rhodey hovering near the door.
Galahad? …
“What just happened?” Tony asked, dazed.
!” And damn Romanoff, too; Nat had always known how to go for the throat with him, hadn’t she? Between her shoving these recordings at him, and Barton shoving the kid at him, what was he supposed to do when he was so thoroughly outflanked? What the hell did they want from him? Was he supposed to just roll over and - what? - forgive and forget?
“Oh,” Hill said, her lip curling in what might have been mistaken for a smile if Tony didn’t know enough to be fucking terrified. “I told him.”
(He wasn’t
Mordo had his hands up almost before Tony was through the portal, Okoye and Master Minoru a split-second behind. “Peace, Stark. I do not wish to fight you.” He had an odd look to him, his shoulders slumped and tension in the line of his body, as if he did not believe his own words - or that he knew them to be futile.
Barton’s death-grip on Tony’s knee had turned into a sort of approving pat, and Tony fought the urge to pull away. “Stop fondling me,” he muttered instead, and Barton gave a short laugh under his breath.
“I’ll steal you right back.” He patted Steve’s knee reassuringly. “OK?”
Somehow, he wasn’t surprised to find Maria Hill waiting for him in the limo. Something about the arrangements had been niggling at him ever since they landed. Pepper wouldn’t have handed over the design of the cover story to just
The house Pepper - or possibly Hill - had picked for them was a fairly luxurious-looking three-storey building, with impeccable security and boring decor. Tony vaguely recalled staying there once or twice when spending longer than a couple of days on site; generally he stayed in Malibu and commuted, but sometimes it was easier to just work through the night and grab a few hours’ sleep in on-site housing.
Well, far be it for Tony to get in the way of a good makeover montage. “Always remember that you can either wear statement lips or dramatic eyes, but not both,” Tony advised on the way out, then went to collapse back in the seat beside Steve’s. The kid was still asleep, which wasn’t surprising given all the activity of the day, the time difference, plus the albuterol dose he’d needed mid-way through the flight. He mumbled under his breath as Tony retook his seat and wriggled so that he was half-draped on Tony’s arm and drooling on his shoulder. Tony smoothed his hair back from his face and leaned back in his seat, waiting for Barnes and Barton to turn into strangers and let them know it was safe to disembark.
in Wakanda.
“Which must be such a shock, considering what a swell first impression you normally make.”
Well, he’d deal with that later. Tony had plenty on his plate before dealing with the trauma of the sleeping arrangements. And the fact that T’Challa - or whoever - had decided that because Steve had yet to freak out over the Iron Man suit, that meant it was ok to put the HUD faceplate on his fucking
, and based on that, Tony would bet money that he wouldn’t have been expecting the remnants of the Avengers to come to his rescue. No, he must have been as convinced of the finality of their sundering as Tony was.
“Ah.” That seemed to clarify several points for Minoru. Something perilously close to grief flickered across her face for a moment. “I understand now. The ‘Steve’ whose welfare you needed to reassure yourselves of, earlier.” She looked back at Tony, inclining her head thoughtfully as she stared up at him. “Very well. When the time is right, we shall… discuss it.”
for - for -
He grimaced. “I don’t know why I’m surprised. That woman seems to have kept in contact with everyone except me.”
Was he hurt? Or just frightened? Tony had more or less snapped at him when he’d put him back to bed. Hell, maybe he was just hungry. Did kids cry when they were hungry? (Babies did, sure, but when did that stop?) He had plenty of vocab at his disposal, though; wouldn’t he have asked? (Did he know to ask?)
Maybe Steve wasn’t the only one with baggage.
There was a longish pause while FRIDAY queried back with the palace, during which time Tony’s brain helpfully provided him with a variety of scenarios, up to and including a 100% casualty rate, a room full of kiddified Dora Milaje, Scarlet Witch and Winter Soldier, and a selection of other horrors hopefully limited to the pages of a Lovecraft novel. He scanned the edge of the distortion field around the palace, looking for any signs of smoke or movement. What was the Wakandan protocol in case of an attack? In the US an attack on a secure building would trigger a lock-down, but with an attacker able to literally walk through walls… If they got through this, he’d need to get himself in a room with the Joint Chiefs. He’d bet his bottom dollar that no one had done any contingency planning for what to do if the attackers stopped observing the laws of physics. The closest anyone had come to it had been Nick Fury’s little tesseract side-project, and look how well
And, somehow, Obie’s voice in the back of his head,
Tony made the mistake of glancing across at the small, earnest face peering intently at him. Steve’s hair was a floppy mess over his forehead, and he was still dressed in the red Iron Man T-shirt that had evidently been declared his favourite. (How they’d managed to get one in Jabariland, he had no idea - although he had a sneaking suspicion that Dhakiya had sent an entire care package of the child’s things the moment that Okoye had relocated them.)
Tony stayed where he was, knees locked inside the armoured shell of the suit, hoping that the pain in his chest wasn’t a heart attack.
Tony thought, and fought the urge to reach out. (Barton, he was sure, wouldn’t want his weakness to be seen by others.)
“Yeah, I guess I see why you’d have to tell yourself that, on account of having to live with yourself and all,” he said instead, and settled back in his seat.
Tony debated mentioning the fact that he’d had to explain to Steve what the situation was, but both Hill and Barnes were looking at him with interest at this point so he opted to keep quiet. He’d mention it to Barton later. He’d know what to do with upset kids; hell, he must have had experience explaining these things to Cooper, right?
do it would be… unconscionable.” He sounded regretful, as if it had been a particularly unpleasant duty he had been forced - by conscience or by compulsion - to discharge. A duty he regretted the necessity of, if not the fulfillment of it.
And, just like that, her expression was all business. “What kind of favour?”
He cleared his throat, looking down at the towhead leaning against his shoulder. “Hey. Why don’t you get dressed and then help me pack, huh? You can help me pack up your drawings so they don’t get crumpled.”
He smoothed Steve’s hair back from his forehead and stood, walking to the adjoining room and closing the door gently behind him.
Steve’s face fell. “Why not?”
Tony looked away, feeling more self-conscious than before. He’d never really looked at Maximoff before, dimly aware that she was young and a teammate (sort of) and damaged (definitely) and… well, looking hadn’t really been the done thing in those circumstances. (He hadn’t wanted to make her nervous. Uncomfortable. Angry.) He was surprised to see the stress lines on her face, carving themselves into her forehead and around her mouth in sharp little grooves. No crow’s feet around her eyes, but whatever few years she’d lived had left their mark on her. Well, they all had their scars, he supposed.
the curl of his lip seemed to say.
No wonder Wilson was furious. No wonder he looked at Tony like
“I -” Tony looked back down at where the child was cuddled against his side. He’d refused to sit in a separate chair and so Tony had simply made room for him in his own, sitting tilted to one side slightly so that Steve could squeeze in against him.
, as he’d tried and failed to explain how everything had gone wrong so spectacularly. How he hadn’t been able to keep the team together.
, he’d told Rhodey. As if
Tony held up one hand in the scout’s salute, the other busy sliding his shoes on. “I promise. Any heart attacks whatsoever and I’ll definitely have someone stick a thermometer in me.”
After a moment, Barton stepped away, shaking his head. “I don't know why I bother.” He shoved a finger in Tony’s face. “You didn't fuck it up so far. Just try to resist the urge to set anything on fire in the next few days, okay? We can handle the rest for a bit. The whole team is on this; all the two of you have to do is just sit tight.”
“Ah,” Master Minoru said, settling down behind an ornate desk. “Please, sit.”
They exchanged a few more pleasantries - Happy had a quick update for him on Peter’s latest escapades, which seemed to include honest-to-god rescuing a cat stuck up a tree - and he rung off, feeling considerably happier and more prepared. Pepper would figure things out. So what if he was planning to turn up on her metaphorical doorstep with a seven year old tomorrow?
And because this is what friends did. (No matter how much it hurt.)
“I could really do with Shuri’s help,” Tony said, almost stumbling over his words. He looked away. “I can’t do anything here. We need to get Steve to her lab, I need to be able to confer with Shuri and Jane Foster without having to hold things up to a video screen or try to guess at what interventions we can try. I need access to that lab, and to their research.”
No no
The clear defensive advantage of Jabariland was part of the reason why Tony was OK with being confined to bedrest for a little bit. Well, not
“I think you are making a mistake,” Wanda said quietly.
for some fucking reason, and Tony can't -
His hands were trembling. He touched the carefully-drawn blonde hair of the woman, his fingers tracing the waxy crayon marks. He didn’t know when Steve had drawn it. Was it a new drawing? Something he’d done to help process the shock of having to stay in the present? Maybe it wasn’t as rosy as it appeared and Tony’s focus should be on the presence of Sarah Rogers, rather than the Iron Man holding Steve’s hand firmly. Or maybe Steve had drawn this back in Birnin Zana.
“So,” he said quietly, “it turns out I’ve screwed up even more than I thought I had. But I guess you knew that.” Steve didn’t seem to have much to say to that, his chest rising and falling in regular movements.
It had taken all of his strength to delete his mom’s greeting from the answerphone that Christmas. The temptation to ring home - to hear her voice saying they were away from the phone, but please leave a message and they would
Tony spun around. “Did you know about this?” He bit out. Then, “what am I even saying; it’s a double-cross, so yeah, you were probably the architect. What, did you run out of people to turn on so you figured kids are fair game now?”
“Nothing.” He smiled again, almost avuncular in his concern. “It is just that… you do not trust yourself to make that choice. Nor anyone else, either, no matter what you say. If I had brought an army with me, if I had brought all those who have my powers and my knowledge, and together we had come for the child… your answer would have been no different. I find that amusing, given the circumstances.” He sat back in his chair and closed his eyes, looking by all appearances ready for a nap. “Amusing, and a little sad.”
If looks could kill, Tony would likely be a smouldering pile right about now. “You know,” Wilson said, his voice tight, “you are so exactly like him. I don’t think I realised just how much before now.”
It would have been better to argue. Better to say that Wilson’s feelings were irrelevant next to Rhodey’s. Better to say that Wilson had plenty to feel guilty about, and that helping Rhodey with his physio would probably help address some of that. “He’s not taking it well, huh,” Tony said instead, watching Rhodey slowly straight up again.
As if there was a choice.
When Steve looked up, there was nothing of the child he had been in his eyes.
Not many notes on this one, other than to reference
Nat seemed convinced that the older Steve was somehow ‘in there somewhere’, and that he had - however temporarily - been allowed to shine back through. Barton thought that this was bullshit, and had argued fairly cogently that Steve had not looked in the least bit altered.
And then Steve was in a room and Howard was there (so impossibly young) and an older man, someone he trusted, someone he cared about, and Steve wasn’t fast enough (he was never fast enough), and the older man was falling, blood on his hands and in his mouth, and he was looking up at Steve -
Rhodey shrugged again. He wouldn’t meet Tony’s eyes. “It happens,” he said. As if it was everyday. As if it was something that just…
Bucky is easy; Bucky can wait. (It sounds terrible - it
“... and that’s revolting.”
“Right.” That was a relief, at least. Tony rubbed a hand over his face and struggled to sit up without dislodging Steve, clinging limpet-like to his side. “Well, that’s good, I guess. Did you catch the name of the guy I fainted on? I should probably apologise...” Had he been a Lord? For some reason Tony was fairly sure the guy was a Lord.
And Tony…
“Heads up, Cap’s been shrunk into a kidlet,” Barton offered, closing the door and stowing their gear away. “Suggest we get him unshrunk as soon as possible. Also, something seriously freaky went down in that base. It’s Lovecraftian levels of fucked up in there.” He glanced across to where Steve was slumped in Tony’s arms. “Uh, messed up,” he corrected himself.
He went to the suit and opened up one of the side-panels on the right thigh, pulling out a tiny tracker. He held it up for Steve to inspect. “This is a - it’s like - it makes a secret sound that only my suit can hear,” he decided at last. “It’s a little tricky because we’re underground right now, and large amounts of rock can cause problems, but in most cases, if you have this on you, I’m going to be able to find you.” He carefully tucked it into the seam of one of the tiny sneakers, hidden out of sight. “So you make sure to wear these shoes whenever you’re going anywhere, OK? And that way I’ll be able to find you.” Ideally, he’d stick the thing on the kid somewhere a bit more permanent, but there really weren’t the facilities for a subcutaneous implant here.
“I hope Wakanda believes in clotheslines,” he muttered, and set the suit to scan for any movement following the wind direction. Maybe they’d get lucky and come across a blanket or a sweater pegged up to dry outside.
“You swooned like an overwrought Victorian maiden,” Barton said placidly, and held up a glass of water. “Now take your painkillers like a good boy, and get some sleep. The entire team is here, not the mention the scary Amazon army, and there’s a whole bunch of yelling happening right now that I promise you, you’ll want to be asleep for. Apparently the politics here are just as much fun as those at home, and I don’t know about you, but I’m not real keen on getting stuck in the middle of it all.”
“I - ok. Sure, Rhodey.” Tony climbed to his feet slowly. He cast one last look at the small, sleeping form on the bed before following Rhodey down the hallway, away from the PICU.
Comments are always treasured.

- which meant that he’d be fine to be around the kid for the most part. T’Challa had also provided the services of a couple of the Dora Milaje - who were
hoped that he hadn’t been such a bad friend that Rhodey wouldn’t have wanted to confide in him, but he knew it wasn’t that simple. Rhodey had been with him through the worst times of Tony’s life, and he still hadn’t been able to bring himself to say anything about the palladium poisoning.)
a grown-up,” Tony said coldly, a little irritated at this unnecessary critique of his rescuing skills. “And your pal’s in no shape to mount a rescue.” He grimaced at the stricken look on Steve’s face. “We’re gonna be evacuated to him soon, and you can see him as much as you like then. But try and stay in the suit, ok? I don’t want you turning back into a Capsicle before then.”
And then, some days. Some moments. His doctor - his
“No one is handing anyone over,” T’Challa broke in. M’Baku tugged Mordo out of the way and T’Challa stepped in front of the prisoner, putting his body in between Tony’s repulsor and its target.
The swordsman smiled at that, amused. “He is not a child. And I have no intention of killing him.”
“... For instance. Other fight options are also available.”
the narcissist.” At Barton’s incredulous look, he shifted the kid in his arms, carefully arranging the mask back over the tiny face, still mutinous and exhausted in sleep. “Yeah, OK, he probably made a few false moves with Barnes, fine. But those two worked like a fucking unit back in Si-Siberia,” and he hoped to God that Barton hadn’t caught the stutter there, “and Barnes managed to snap out of Hydra’s best fucking programming at the sight of him, right? So no way did Barnes say that Rogers had driven him away; sorry, I don't buy it. That’s your saviour’s guilt complex at work.” He shrugged. “That’s the problem with having nice, clean moral absolutes your entire life; you meet one shade of grey and it beats you bloody.”
That’s right, he couldn’t take the meds anymore. He couldn’t -
Sleep did not come easily. He tensed at every small noise, getting up four times in the night to check on Steve and make sure that he was OK.
Well, that issue was being resolved, one way or the other. This particular apocalypse clearly didn’t need him in the field (at least until they figured out where said field was), and he was no good to anyone moping about in a cave in Wakanda. That way madness lay. No, going back to the States was the right move, he was sure of it. He had a lot more in the way of options there, not to mention resources, allies and commitments.
Mordo inclined his head in acknowledgement. He seemed to find sitting next to Wanda just as distasteful - a little hypocritical, Tony thought, for someone who seemed just as much a magic user as she was. Perhaps there was more than one kind of magic, or maybe Mordo had a different beef with her?
I brought milk, lemon and sugar as I wasn’t sure how you -”
, and there were extenuating circumstances.”
Rogers’s gaze is wary. “Avenues for what? If this is about the Accords -”
Rhodey rolled his eyes. “Thanks for the reminder, I forgot I was in such illustrious company.”
, because he wasn’t the one dealing with this. Because all the literature said that everyone was different, that clinical depression was a possibility, that the cocktail of negative feelings would take months to work through as people settled into their new normality. Because it had taken Rhodey weeks to tell him this, in confidence, and he didn’t want to betray that trust by getting this wrong.
Comments are love.
Romanoff shook her head. “The route they’re taking, and the impact on the victims, implies that someone is using them to power something, or to open something, in preparation for a larger event. But we are unclear as to what. And - it goes without saying - that we need to get ahead of the attacker. The attacks are escalating.”
Those chairs… had not been there a moment ago.
“Now, more than ever. Your recent absence has not made you any friends among the other Board members, and especially among the FAC. Pepper has been working overtime to calm him down. Something about a missing derogation on the BARF design?” She spelled it out B-A-R-F, her entire expression indicating that no power on this earth would be able to compel her to just call the fucking thing BARF as God (and Tony) had intended.
Steve looked up at him, the familiar clear blue of his eyes unwavering.
Barnes nodded. “Alright. But, Stark, listen -”
It took Happy a little longer to get it, but then his expression also fell. He didn’t look mad, oh no. He looked
had been involved in the cover-up…
- it might be a good idea for him to try to mend some bridges with Wilson, for Rhodey’s sake. And it looked like Wilson was thinking along the same lines.
“Steve! C’mere!” A small form hurtled out of the closet -
Little wonder that there hadn’t been any serious move to get Barnes set-up with babysitting duties; in the event that the kid’s affections had been transferred, Tony had little doubt that T’Challa would have placed Steve with child services and arranged for carefully-supervised visits by the Soldier. In retrospect, possibly it was a smart move on the kid’s part to not attach himself to the one man who wouldn’t be allowed near him unsupervised. But that didn’t remove the immediate problem. “And what happens when Ross finds out that I have in my custody a seven year old Steve Rogers?”
"Steve?" He managed.
Tony fought the urge to laugh. His stomach was clenched into a painful knot, his chest heaving. He desperately wanted to close the faceplate, to have the familiar screen be the barrier between him and Romanoff’s disconcerting presence, but he couldn’t quite figure out a way to do so without it being a cowardly move. “I wonder what Rogers would say if he knew you shared his secrets so easily,” he said instead, trying to find her soft underbelly. “That you’re all on board with dangling him in front of a sword-wielding maniac. That - that you put him in my care. Christ, I thought you had it out for me, but maybe this is what you think friendship is like, huh? Flaying someone so they have no armour left. Too hard to break out of your pattern of looking for that goddamned weak spot.”
Maybe Barton was sticking around because he wanted to check that Steve was OK. Maybe he wanted to talk to Tony. Or maybe he just needed someone he didn’t need to smile for, just for a little while longer, before he went to his room and called his kids.
. Well, Tony was going to get a
, are you kidding me? You think I’m just going to let you hand Steve over -”
he thought, but did not say. (He still had not answered any of Peter’s messages. Better the kid have some time to cool off. Better he think Germany was an aberration, a mistake.)
“I will help,” Maximoff said after a moment. She hadn’t looked up from her clenched hands for the entire duration of the slide show. “If it was Hydra, I may recognise some of them. They may have been… it may have been someone from the programme.”
He made a mental note to make sure Steve put on socks before they left, though. The kid had had enough sniffles and upper respiratory infections to last a lifetime.
Steve said, his voice heavy with grief, and the vice around Tony's chest tightened another notch.
Shuri brightened again.
“It can fly again?” Steve asked, anxiety plain in his voice.
She'd just shaken her head.
“This is so fucking adorable, I think I just threw up a little in my mouth,” a very familiar voice said from far too close.
Tony still found that vaguely disturbing. To start with - when Steve had been ill - he’d chalked it up to any sick child’s natural reticence to walking. But now, with Steve back on his feet and no such convenient excuse, he was starting to wonder. Surely he hadn’t done this with his mother? For all that he was a thin, sickly child, he was still as heavy and cumbersome as a sack of potatoes. There was no way anyone as thin as Sarah Rogers had been - judging by the one photograph a much younger Tony had seen in his history books - had been able to carry a child this large around. “You’re affectionate this morning,” he said after a beat. He looked down at the tow-headed child in his lap.
Barton raised an eyebrow.
for him.
Rogers grimaces again, looking even more uncomfortable. “Uh. It was actually Rhodes. Ms Potts isn't… she's still not speaking to me.”
My God, that’s fantastic news.” It was a world away from the cautious optimism he’d been nursing, and what he’d read in the spare updates FRIDAY provided. “They’re sure? Full function?”
, your doctors are gonna murder me.”
He got down on one knee so he was facing the kid face-on. “OK, kid, I wanna be straight with you here. I’m not sure how much the doctor told you. Obviously, until we figure out how to turn you back into an adult, we can’t leave you on your own, you need someone to be in charge of you.”
The thought came unbidden, intended for a different recipient than the child lying quiescent on the bed.
Sending him back to live the same life of pain and loss and trauma, to watch his mother die anyway, and to live through the horror of war….
There was an almost imperceptible pause before FRIDAY answered. “His majesty, King T’Challa, is on the line for you, boss. He apologises for the late hour. He says it's urgent.”
, for the love of God.
He was on his feet without remembering how he got there, and he was looking for the source of the voice. That voice… it was a threat, somehow. He had to… he had to…
Steve was silent for a long time. “Does that mean - if I’m supposed to be him - is that why we’re not going back home? Because it’s not there anymore?”
in his hands (from where? Tony doesn't have chocolate in his workshop. Has he been carrying it around the entire time?) and he's trying to get Tony to accept it. Because Tony is clearly a child, to be placated with sweets. (Or an invalid, to be distracted with medicines. Either one is unacceptable at this moment.)
Tony closed his eyes, the cool metal soothing against his skin. “... You should have told me. I don’t care if I was concussed, or post-op, or bleeding from my fucking brain. Something like this? You should have told me.”
Still. The kid had been having nightmares even before he’d narrowly escaped being shish-kebabed, and now he kept Tony in his line of sight at all times. Was that normal? And his play, that didn’t quite seem right, either. Barton had brought across some toys along with the crayons and other art supplies, but Steve hadn’t shown any special inclination to investigate them until Tony had upended the entire box that morning in an effort to find something to keep him occupied. There were Legos, and marbles, a baseball and catcher’s mitt, something else that seemed designed to just make noise (honestly, Barton’s kids were getting their very own drum kits the moment this whole mess was resolved) and Steve had dutifully looked at them all and then… tidied them.
Steve twisted a little in Tony’s arms so he could see the cover of a the book. He sniffled and nodded, settling himself down. “OK,” he whispered.
Like hell. There was no chance this guy was here for anyone other than the kid. Not when he’d had to get through God knew how many guards to make it to this point. Now was definitely not the time to be looking for a de-escalation solution. “Sorry, not sorry,” Tony said, and fired a repulsor blast at his head.
“They do that,” M’Baku agreed. He nodded back at the group of children. “You will also have one shortly, I think.”
“He is not physically injured,” Vis murmured, his voice guarded. “There has been another attack, we are not sure where, precisely. The portal connection seemed to affect the child this time more than previously, we are not sure why. He is unharmed, but…” A small, strange hesitation. “If you are back soon, that would be… beneficial for him.”
Steve shook his head, as if to clear it.
Steve brightened visibly. “Bucky? He’s here?”
“You have to do this,” she finished sadly. “Tony. You know that’s not true, right? You don’t owe him anything. You can absolutely say no.”
He said it matter of factly, like he was completing a check-in, or a grocery list.
“Hey.” Tony put his hands on the child’s shoulders and drew him in for a hug, bedding and all. “I promise, OK? I’ll be back in two days.” He drew back, smoothing down Steve’s hair. “I need you to be brave for Vision, OK? I need you to listen to what he says.”
His relationship with Rogers had clearly had a lot more weight in Tony’s mind than it had in Rogers’s, and Tony would do well to remember it. It was pointless to wish after something that had clearly never existed outside of Tony’s imagination. He was just missing Rhodey, that was all. He was missing Rhodey, and projecting that - and every recent clusterfuck that had landed on his head - onto a man who had, at best, tolerated him for the sake of a long con.
“That’s the one. He’s been harassing me ever since, you know? I made him the suit so he’d be a little safer, but…” Tony shook his head. “He’s on his own out there - he was on his own starting out, and he’s been getting into bigger and bigger trouble - and I just…” he shrugged. “I don’t know. I think I may have made a mistake. Maybe I should have just put a lid on it, kept him small, local, you know?”

is in his workshop, announced quietly and without any fanfare by FRIDAY. Tony really would have preferred for this conversation to happen a little later - say, fifty years into the future, with Tony safely dead and buried - but Rogers has never really paid attention to Tony’s preferences on that front.
’s ends - and Tony was not OK with that. Barton, he’d more or less made peace with (barring an appointment with a fist sometime in the future). But Romanoff…
He’d found it funny.
Next time - we hear back from our deployed team.

“Just lemon is fine,” Tony interrupted, looking out into the empty hallway before closing the door. He could have sworn that there were guards stationed nearby, but… Hadn’t Dhakiya said that there were guards available and within earshot? What did ‘earshot’ mean in this instance? (And how long would it take them to reach the rooms, if…) “I guess you know this part of the palace pretty well, huh?”
Yeah. The
He sighed, and rolled up his sleeves. “Come on, kiddo, let’s get you cleaned up.”
“Alright. You stay there for a little bit, I’m just going to -”
“Shhhh.” From one child to another.
He didn’t seem to understand how to play with them, Tony thought, and had half-wondered a couple of times whether he should step in, and, well
RE: Tony's priority list - I get a bit frustrated with portrayals of the whole of the Avengers as being uniformly at the top. Tony is human, and he would have his favourites just like anyone else. If it came down to choosing between Sam and Rhodey, he wouldn't hesitate. *shrug* Learning to accept and manage those limits is pretty important if you're planning on leading people into battle, though.
Okoye snorted at that but did not protest, pushing into the shop and heading for the back.
point, the whole lot of them had wormed their way into his heart, like an infestation he was helpless to defend against - he didn’t trust her. In battle, sure, but not to have his back. On the list of people she cared about, he imagined he came fairly low on the totem pole, perhaps a step or two higher than Justin Hammer.
“That’s what we thought about the palace guard, and now they’re sushi. And anyway, the fucker’s using some of portal techno- I did
Not until now. These last few weeks, these last few days. Those hours on the quinjet, his hands tight on the armrests, bartering away the scraps of his soul to whoever might be listening to keep Steve safe until he got him back.
today, and I have many feelings. Luckily, as this fic is set before S-M: Homecoming, pretty much nothing in IW impacts it at all. There may be small elements of non-compliance as obviously I started this before IW, but I hope it doesn't spoil your enjoyment of the fic.
The grey recedes a little, his vision creeping back in tiny increments. His grip on the worktop loosens. He can do this.
the small part of Tony still endlessly impressed with the Wakandan tech noted. He was still trying to get to his feet, his ears ringing and his vision blurring. The fucker had managed to get a few good hits in there, and in between his bruised chest and his ringing ears, even the suit didn’t seem enough to keep him upright.
“Steve? Come on, buddy -”
- although that last was probably well-deserved, considering - and to anyone in authority. He’d lied to Steve - child Steve - almost daily, reassuring him repeatedly that everything would be OK, that if he was only patient for a little while longer, he’d be looked after and safe.
Lang didn’t wait for an answer, addressing Steve directly. “Steve? Kiddo, do you want to go with Dr Stark?”
“About an hour ago,” Vision said with a smile. He was wearing a human guise, the red and green - and the cape - cloaked effectively behind a blonde, blue-eyed innocence. Tony wouldn’t have been able to pick him out of a crowd if he didn’t know what he was looking for. “The need for subterfuge expired after we knew the trap had worked. It is good to see you recovered from your injuries.” He looked down at where Steve was hiding against Tony’s leg. “We have not met, Steve,” he said softly. “I am a friend of your older self. My name is Vision.”
The worst thing was, Barton was right: it might be a shitty plan, but they didn’t have anything better available.
Tony clenched his fists and forced himself to keep walking.
He let the doctor tug him away from where T’Challa had turned to Romanoff and Barton.
He tasted something bitter in the back of his throat. “To talk me out of it?”
“Much like your power,” T’Challa observed with a smirk. “I do hope you are… comfortable.”
An hour or so later, Mordo spoke up again. “My apology is quite genuine,” he said, his voice barely a murmur above the low hum of the jet in flight. “Circumstances dictated my actions, but that does not mean that I am blind to the consequences of them. I had understood that you were sheltering your friend. I had not grasped that you viewed him as…” He faltered at the look in Tony’s eyes. “That is, that the impact would be quite so profound.” He shifted a little in his seat, stilling when Wanda’s eyes snapped to him at the movement. “Perhaps I should have tried a different approach.”
Why the hell did the kid sound so uncertain about that? “And I’m one of them, that’s right. In fact, we have a plan to stop that man from hurting you. But there’s something I want to do just in case we have a problem, OK?”
?! Tony, look at me, are you OK?” Rogers at least has the courtesy to grimace the moment that inanity leaves his lips. “Stupid question, sorry. Uh… FRIDAY mentioned that you had, uh, medication for your heart. Is it here? Should I get it? Or, some water? Or…”
Behind him, T’Challa exhaled. “Dr Stark -”
“Sorry,” Wilson said, looking unrepentant. He nodded at the sleeping Steve. “So I hear you’re gonna be babysitting for a while.”
Of course it was. Chances were, this guy was one of the people responsible for the pile of dead bodies piled up high from Lapland southwards.
Tony sighed. “Right, well. It’s not like I have a lot of choice.” He looked down at the exhausted child in his arms. “Steve, buddy? We’re going to have to go someplace else now, to keep away from the bad guy. Are you going to be OK if I carry you for a bit?”
“Oh, well, if
He made himself a pot with the little French press provided in the kitchenette and sat back down at the desk with the box of data. Rogers’s audio records were in one corner of the box on what he assumed was the Wakandan equivalent of a thumb drive (either that, or Romanoff had given him some decorative rocks by mistake).
“Definitely a magic user,” Barton said, his voice tight. He glanced at Tony and looked away when he accidentally made eye contact. “And whatever it is they’re planning, it’s not small potatoes.”
He had an hour, right? He could wait until Barton or whoever came down to get him. It wasn’t like the kid had anyone else, after all. Sure, they’d get Barnes thawed out pretty quickly, but until then, Tony could stay here. What could it hurt?
Tony squinted at him. “FRIDAY provided the quinjet,” he said flatly. “Right. Rather than sending Vision, or -” or Rhodey, he’d been about to say, but snapped his mouth shut before it could escape.
He shook his head to clear it. “That’s the king’s sister, huh?” He set the data packet aside. “She’s something else. Do I want to know why T’Challa’s been keeping her under lock and key?” Well, keeping her away from Tony, anyway. That said, T’Challa himself had been scarce during Tony’s stay at casa del M’Baku, so maybe it was just a side-effect of the information shut-down.
There was a pause during which Tony looked down at Steve, and Steve looked at Barton, and Barton - Tony had the horrible feeling - was looking at Tony. “... yeah,” Barton said eventually, clambering up to his feet with zero grace. “I’m here to rescue you. You must be Steve?” It somehow came out as a question.
As if he’d ever been able to talk Steve - any version of him - into anything.
T’Challa smiled a little. “He will not. Data protection is taken very seriously in Wakanda, and medical records have our highest protection. No one will be able to access them. And there is no reason for General Ross to suspect that the Captain is now a child.” He got to his feet; everyone automatically followed suit. “I believe we have planned for all eventualities, Dr Stark. On balance, this is the approach that will provide optimum results. Please do sign all the forms the Child Safeguarding Team provide, and I will leave to you, Sergeant Barnes and Ms Maximoff to decide on what approach to take to attempt re-aging the Captain. Colonel Rhodes, thank you again for your assistance. Everyone else - thank you all for coming, please be ready to depart in two hours.”

He’d take his wins where he could get them.
Mordo’s face hardened at this, recognition flickering in his eyes.
she said, repentant.
There was a strange look in Mordo’s eyes at that. “An apt choice of words. Tweedledum… well, let us say that although Tweedledum was safely beaten back, Tweedledee is still here, and eager to reunite with her sibling.”
Mordo was by the crates, and they’d been away less than an hour. But the bracelets were off. The bracelets were
The flight back took approximately five hours, if you went by Barton’s chronometer, or eighteen days, if you went by Tony’s measure of subjective time. “Come
And so Rhodey had been forced to hide it, and Wilson had watched him hiding it, and… “That’s why he’s against the Accords?” He said, incredulous. “Because he’s pissed about how the US armed forces treat the troops and the vets?”
, if the vaguely approving look he got at this was any indication. He rather thought that Steve would protest, but maybe the kid had realised that walking barefoot was gonna be just as miserable now as it had been before. At any rate, he wrapped his arms around Tony’s neck and didn’t protest the embrace, slumping against Tony’s shoulder immediately.
kid to watch, and then the security to organise… So who is going to be watching your back while you walk around with a giant target strapped to it?”
“I realize that there is a price, Tony. I'll pay it, whatever it is.”
If it had been Tony in Steve’s shoes, if his nightmares had been broadcast, his journal opened, his childhood on display for all the world to see, would he have been able to look anyone in the eyes again?
Tony opened his mouth to reply and then closed it again slowly.
God, huh?” He was half-out of his seat without even being aware of it, twisting around so he could glare at Mordo, the self-righteous, arrogant son of a bitch.
How could he have forgotten. His hand reached out, smoothing the blonde hair, checking for injuries. “Steve, how is he?”
Steve stared back at him, his eyes wide and wet, and nodded solemnly.
he thought.
“After you,” Master Minoru said with a smile, and waved them both through the portal.
and there was no healing factor; he hadn’t been breathing properly and depending on how starved of oxygen his blood had been, he could have had fucking
“That’s not a great idea,” Rhodey said, trying to push him back on to the bed. “Tones, listen -”
“He’s been pretty out of it,” Wilson said through gritted teeth. “Fever, and - you know.”
Well, it didn’t matter what he’d thought. His sleep seemed to be either deep and soothing, or hellish and full of nightmares, no in-between. It was a toss-up what he’d get on any given night. And - he looked down at the child still asleep on his chest - maybe the nightmares did make a certain amount of sense. It wasn’t as though he could busy himself in work and put the whole fucking mess to the back of his mind. No, his whole day was now Steve-focused. Well, child-focused, anyway; his brain still found it most comforting to treat the child as a separate person from the adult.
Comments are always welcomed and treasured.
was here -
Barton just shrugged. “It’s no big deal.”
“Now, we all know that I won the lottery when they were handing out brains, but somehow, Cap, you still manage to get people on your side, even if your argument is an entire farm’s worth of manure. I might be a merchant, but then you're a snake oil salesman, peddling your outdated, golly-gee-shucks model of patriotism to the masses.”
“Didn’t your mother ever tell you it was rude to stare?”
Came from the baby monitor a couple of minutes later and Tony jumped, startled.
He felt irrationally angry; he didn’t need anyone’s opinion, and certainly not their approval! Especially not with all the history between them. He bit his tongue and seethed quietly, not making eye contact. At least, he thought morosely, it would be a
She shook her head, her expression changing into one of dismay. “I - oh. I didn’t realise. I’m sorry. Stark - Tony - I’m
“Or, I back you up, and Barton stays at home to mind the baby instead,” Tony cut in, scowling. He looked at Barton, quiet at his side. “You’ve been silent all through this. You change your mind about us holding hands and running off into the sunset to make daisy chains?”
other
“OK, I guess we can do this the hard way,” Tony said, and reached for the guy instead. He didn’t have a whole lot of options fighting in close quarters (and he wasn’t going to use the unibeam unless absolutely necessary, as there was a good chance it would take out half the palace) but even if he couldn’t use the repulsors, that didn’t mean that he didn’t have offensive weapons available to him. The suit’s structural integrity was strong enough to let him crush the guy’s head like an eggshell.
Barton had said during one of their last debriefs before he’d retired. They'd had to evacuate a school bus of children, and it had… not gone especially well. The youngest kids had been so terrified, they'd crawled under the seats and refused to come out. Tony had ended up dragging the entire bus out of the line of fire because it had been easier than ripping it apart to look for the kids.
Tony sprawled on the ground, looking up at Wanda. Her hair was a loose halo around her face, her eyes red. She held the scepter in her hands.
(See the end of the chapter for
Mordo, who was looking back at him with perfect understanding and not responding. Finally, he sighed, and spread his hands. “The Ancient One,” he said. There was a small smile on his lips, oddly sad. “And believe me, please, I am fully aware of how flawed my reasoning is to both blame her for withholding information from us, and to yet miss her, and wish that she was here to make this choice for me instead. That I could continue for a little while longer in my state of blissful ignorance. But there is no one else, Mr Stark. There is no higher power I can appeal to, no more profound judgement I can trust. There is just - me.”
“What?” Tony asked, despite himself. He looked down at the child. “Steve?”
“Dr Stark, I hope that you will be sensible and take all reasonable precautions,” the doctor said, signing off on the discharge papers with a scowl on her face. “Do not, under any circumstances, hit your head on anything. Repetitive head injury syndrome is a very real risk in your case. You should have your regular doctor examine you as soon as you are back in the US; I have taken you off the anticoagulants for the moment which means that the risk of heart attack and blood clots due to the atrial fibrillation is elevated. I recommend several weeks of restricted movements -” she rolled her eyes at Tony, who had started to pull his shoes on the moment she had signed the paperwork, “but I will settle for a promise that you will get emergency medical attention if you feel any further disturbances in your heart rhythm.”
Shuri leaned forward. “Yes, I thought so too. External, right?”
The Stark Industries facility was heralded by retinal scans and voice-prints, which made Tony briefly wide-eyed with panic before he remembered that Pepper would have sorted all of that out for them in advance. In any case, only the adults were required to be passed through; Steve slept through the whole thing. Once inside, they pretty much had the run of the place, although obviously any secure areas such as the residences or the R&D labs had additional security in place.
For all they knew, it could be another Asgardian. Hadn’t SHIELD run into a who posse of them back when Thor had first come to earth? Presumably there was more than one way to come to earth.
Tony grimaced. “Remind me again when it’s down to fifteen minutes.” He needed to find out what the hell had happened. But before then - “keep scanning for danger, and let me know if you detect any activity.”
Barton folded his arms and scowled at him. “In case you forgot, Steve’s been missing for over a day. No comms, no nothing. And then you go to get him, and then you also drop off the grid after sending a distress case with
This is the part they don’t tell you about.
“You know, that’s still creepy,” he called out. Barnes did not seem perturbed by this.
he thought.
Tony took his hand away after a moment and watched him for a little while.
“And yet you are my associates?” The woman said archly. She flipped her long braid back over her shoulder and nodded at the teacher. “Please, continue.” She led them through the training room and into what was probably a back office, except that it had a view of the fork in the streets outside, which…
. Is there something we need to discuss?”
Tony jolted awake a few hours later to the unmistakable feeling of someone pressing down on his bladder. The weight sprawled out on him shifted a little in sleep and managed to wedge a knee even more firmly into Tony’s abdomen.
“No. Well - his albuterol. But nothing to make him sleep. His breathing’s too tight for that. Anyway, this isn’t unusual for him, he sleeps a lot.” Tony had wondered about it a couple of times, but Steve had had so much disruption and trauma in his relatively short time with them that if the kid wanted to hibernated he wasn’t going to argue. There was nothing medically wrong with him - other than his lungs - and the Wakandan doctors had thought him well enough to stay outside the hospital. Tony was admittedly not going to feel settled about it until he had the opinion of his own doctor, Pepper, Rhodey’s mom and possibly a signed note from God, but he wasn’t about to make any of that public. “The doctors said it was normal.”
"Boss, have you made a decision about back-up?"
“Tony? What are you - oh.”
“Yeah, no, I’m not OK with this.” He didn’t fucking care what sort of yarn this guy was spinning. Not after what he’d tried to do to the kid.
Rhodey stopped speaking, his mouth hanging open.
“I…” He coughed. “I have to go to a meeting in a little bit. But…” They’d said that they were waking up Barnes, right? “Your pal will likely be at the meeting as well. What say I bring him down with me afterwards?” He tapped the face mask. “Hopefully they’ll have mask off you by then, and you’ll be breathing more easily. Yeah?” And then Barnes could take over, and Tony could… He’d just...

?” Tony took a deep breath and let it out slowly, his hands clenched into fists underneath the table, conscious that Steve was watching all of this with wide eyes from his vantage point on the floor. “I think it’s a little bit more than

This was so completely 180 to what Tony had thought they were discussing that all Tony could do was blink at him, stunned.
Oh, well. It
The banks will not release the funds without a death certificate. The registrar will not issue one without a medical certificate. The doctor will not issue one for a missing person. There can be no funeral because there are no bodies, and you can’t have a memorial for someone not legally dead. (Not yet.)
, Tony thought with a smile. He caught Hill’s gaze. Of course, there was one thing that Hill wouldn’t mention but which had to be foremost on her mind. Ross could be stalled by polite iciness only as far as he allowed the trappings of legality to hold him. Put one toe out of line and he had a whole host of extra-legal alternatives open to him.
A couple of familiar faces were waiting for them at the end of the corridor, flanked by four guards.
Many thanks to phnelt for both the Palo Alto research and for suggesting Maria Hill as Tony's liaison at the SI west coast facilities.
“Off,” Tony gasped, and kicked at the swordman’s hand, trying to at least knock the fucking sword away. “Your name wouldn’t be Inigo Montoya, would it?” How was the guy moving so fast? It wasn’t even the combination of the sword and the glowy shield of doom; the guy was never where physics and ten years of solid hand-to-hand fighting had told Tony he would be.
“Yeah,” Tony said, his gaze fixed on the burning blue of the sky outside. He could feel Barton’s eyes on him. “Steve’s OK. He just had a bit of a nightmare. You know what kids are like.” His hands clenched and unclenched on the armrests.
“Or a photostatic veil,” said Romanoff slowly.
“A couple of testimonials wouldn’t go amiss,” Barton drawled from his seat beside Romanoff. His fingers were drumming on the table. “Maybe a video recommendation or two.”
So, that was it - Barton had put the two of them in touch, presumably around the time he’d gone to ground. “You did good.” Tony watched Steve sleeping, the gentle rise and fall of his chest.
“I gotta say, ‘we’re all shit at everything’ is not really the sterling defence you seem to think it is.” No matter how true it might be.
Tony stared back at Lang, nonplussed. Wanda had a similarly confused expression on her face; Natasha looked carefully blank.
Well, he wasn’t wrong on that score. Tony just hoped to god that it wasn’t Loki. The last thing they needed was a crazy Asgardian in the mix.
T’Challa held his gaze unblinkingly. “None of those individuals are in Wakanda. Nor do I have a way of reaching them.”
Barnes looked at him out of the corner of his eye. “He’s not coming at all, kid. This is just a precaution. It’s…” he seemed to struggle for the right words for a moment before inspiration hit. “It’s misdirection. He’s headed in the opposite direction.” He managed to make eye contact for a second before looking away again.
. “There’s over three billion people missing, how can they do that?”
It came out sad, somehow; as if she’d been hoping for something that now remained out of reach. Tony felt an odd pang of regret at that. He quashed it, straightening his back, feeling absurdly under attack. The warm glow from earlier hadn’t entirely faded, and he’d have liked it to continue just a little longer, thank you very much.
They sat.
“Please.”
Rhodey nodded slowly, not fighting him on this even a token amount.
The truth of it was, even in the best of all worlds - where they stopped Umar, where Mordo turned out to not be a double-crossing bastard, where there was no collateral damage - they had no guarantee of what would happen to Steve.
“...Yeah.” Well, at least there was a recording of what had gone down.
Happy nodded seriously. “Don’t worry, boss. I’ll make sure he’s OK. And if this thing drags on, if you have to bring him back with you -”
M’Baku looked like he was trying hard not to laugh.
He was half-way through re-assembling the boot, the filaments repaired or replaced with the fast-dwindling emergency supplies in the thigh compartments by the time that Steve crept out of the bedroom, fully dressed and in his Iron Man sneakers, up on his tiptoes in exaggerated stealth. He looked up and smiled. “Hey, kid.” He reached out to ruffle Steve’s hair. It was easier to keep the adult Steve and the child Steve separate in his mind when he had the kid version in front of him. He was so different in so many ways from the adult that his personhood, for lack of a better term, was more easily apparent.
farewell.
Steve did not seem especially buoyed by this praise, looking down at his sneakered feet.
He stared at Tony and sniffled, letting go of the knife with one hand to drag his forearm across his face, managing to transfer both his snot and the majority of his camouflage make-up onto his oversized uniform sleeve.
The child was dead, and it was his fault. He must have looked away, or he must have failed, somehow. He must have done something wrong, because the child was dead, and it was on
“Oh!” Shuri said, brightening. “Well, that’s when we irradiated with gamma radiation. You can see that -”
"Boss, it might not be the best option to attract the attention of whoever was here," FRIDAY said in his ear, sounding worried.
“You’re trying to buy his love with art supplies,” Tony said irritably, carding a hand through Steve’s hair and feeling obscurely guilty over the expression on Barton’s face. “It won’t work, you know. He’s just using you to get his crayon fix.”
Barnes didn’t really count - Tony trusted him about as far as he could throw the quinjet - and Barton was… well, things were still complicated with Barton. He wished that Rhodey could be there, or Pepper. He wished that he had someone he could discuss this with who wouldn’t have a personal stake in the answer falling one way or the other.
“That’s not true,” he said. “I - that’s not true.” His grip tightened on the thin porcelain.
See him interact with Barnes? See? He was totally interacting. Nothing strange or strained here, nope.
That sounded wrong. Didn’t it? Wasn’t Rhodey back in the US? Or… no, wait...
On reflection, Tony thought that he was pretty OK with any of them.)
He cast about for something to say. “Hey, so, once you’re better, I bet you’ll be able to see your Bucky again. That’d be … something, right?” That was probably the kindest way he could put it.
(It's actually a 3D holographic version of Pong. He likes Pong. Pong is playing across his worktop, and it's actually a lot more soothing than it has any right to be.)
“Boss?” FRIDAY said, sounding as surprised as it was possible for her to be. “Are you okay? Is the suit damaged? This line is not entirely secure,” she added chidingly before he could speak.
Tony, what the
as bait?”
“Yeah. There’s a lot of that going around.” Rhodey wheeled himself back to the table, Tony following repentantly in his wake.
He couldn’t quite make himself believe it. Every time he drifted off, something would startle him to wakefulness and sending him stumbling from his bed to creep into Steve’s room, as if watching the rise and fall of his chest could somehow provide proof positive that he was OK, that something hadn’t gone horribly wrong.
“Okay, you just… you stay put for a while.”
“Don’t worry, doc, I’ll make sure he does his exercises,” Barton assured the doctor, squeezing Tony’s knee.
(He does. He knows fairness has nothing to do with whether Steve lives or dies; that some unseen skeletal hand could reach in and snatch the sleeping child for its own as easily as it had spared the man.)
. Tony was on his knees in an instant, leaning forward and pressing his hands in between Rhodey’s hips and the sides of the wheelchair to check the bandages. “Are you ok? Was there any damage during the flight?” Dammit, what was he thinking? He should have checked on Rhodey immediately!
Tony stared blindly at the last flickers of sunlight as they rose above the clouds, his vision blurring into soft focus.
Wazungu is the plural of ‘mzungu’, a common word for ‘foreigner’ or ‘white skin’ in the Bantu language of the African Great Lakes. Black Panther seemed to confirm my vague feeling that in the MCU, Wakanda is the north-west part of Tanzania, i.e. west of Lake Victoria, albeit with significantly different topology!
After a moment, Barton snorted. “Don’t worry about it. I’m just making sure you keep our appointment in the gym.” His lips quirked in a smile. “Drink the fruit shake, Tony.”
Steve nodded and demonstrated putting the mask up. “I used one when I got real sick once and mom took me to the doctor. I put it over my face and breathe real hard, and then medicine gets in me.”
“I’m just -”
lawn, goddammit, however well-intentioned. He closed it again.
Okoye did not seem particularly pleased to see Tony, barely sparing him a glance as she glared daggers at the swordsman on the screen. “He is stubborn,” she said, sounding frustrated. “They are both stubborn.” She said something else in a language Tony didn’t recognise, but by inference thought was not particularly complimentary about either T’Challa or M’Baku’s sense of self-preservation. Beside her, one of the other Dora smirked. The Jabariland warriors behind them looked long-suffering.
Getting him back to the suite was a bit of a problem. If they put him in the wheelchair, he’d be able to see pretty much all of the hospital on his way out. But the hospital - like all hospitals - wouldn’t let him walk, in case he split his head open on his way out or something. Rhodey had even offered to have him in his lap (absolutely out of the question; God alone knew what that sort of weight jostling his pelvis would do when he was so soon out of hospital) and Steve had insisted that he could absolutely walk, he was feeling better, he could do it, and then Tony lost what little patience he’d had to start with and picked him up again.
