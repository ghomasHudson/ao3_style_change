Clint listened raptly, and he felt his heart sink at the news. While they'd managed thus far without the god, the idea that he definitely wasn't going to show up was a massive letdown. "So that leaves us with trying to find a way to kill Loki on our own. The hammer-"
Victor caught the subtle shift in Barton's line if sight as the man worked out a strategy. The feral mutant smirked as he took a deep breath, scenting the two before him. "Well, you two are close," he said, "in more ways than one." He barely winced as another arrow lodged in his chest, instead leveling a glare at Clint. "Guess that means that if I get one, I get both."
The sound of the blast had completely thrown Clint's concentration, and an arrow fluttered side-to-side and across lanes. He'd expected something far more laser-like and far less explosive. Looking at the glowing edges of the decapitated mock-up, Clint realized Scott's ability was all of the above. "Jesus," he muttered, lowering his bow as he surveyed the damage.
"I'll thank him too, but right now, I'm thanking you. Without you and Agent Fitz, we'd be even worse off than we are. Thank you. This didn't work out the way any of us wanted," Steve added quietly, voice thick, "but we're going to get Loki, and we're going to take him down. I promise."
"Half an hour," Simmons agreed. "I could use a shower." She'd spent most of her time holed up in the lab. Jarvis had given Fitz-Simmons access to a few files which Tony had authorized the release of. She knew that most of the good stuff belonged to Stark Industries, but even Tony's lesser formulas and files had proved utterly fascinating. The young woman ignored Fitz' warning glare entirely as she made her way upstairs. After a quick shower, she changed into a sundress that was attractive without looking like she was trying too hard. For once she left her hair down. All in all the preparation took just over fifteen minutes, and Simmons sighed when she glanced at the clock. There were definite downsides to being almost pathologically punctual. She grabbed her purse and headed downstairs anyway, knowing she'd never manage to focus on anything long enough to be worth spending the few minutes doing more than waiting.
Every mention of Steve's pain was like a knife in Tony's gut, but he knew better than to tell Loki; the god would just use it as a weapon against him. "Pretty sure you tried to steal from SHIELD, and they just got there in time to stop you from taking it," Tony managed, trying to keep his breathing even as his eyes watered from the yanks to his hair. It wasn't working well. He was terrified. Loki might not have been a literal god, but Tony was more than smart enough to know that in comparison, Loki was the closest thing to a god that actually existed. Not to mention, being unable to see well was nerve-wracking in and of itself. "And killing you's the only way we can make sure you're not going to keep coming back and playing with people's heads."
Tony whimpered needfully as he rocked his hips against Steve's, gasping as their cocks slid perfectly together. "Never gonna... leave," he gasped in agreement to Steve's rambling. He buried his face into the wet skin of the blonde's neck, panting helplessly. He was far too eager to last long but he fully intended to spend the next day... or maybe week or month... curled up in Steve's arms, and he needed the release and the intimacy with his lover far too much to hold back.
Tony kept a straight face, but his larynx bobbed at the glimmer of green in Bruce's eyes. The shorter scientist moved away a moment later, and Tony cleared his throat. "I'll catch up with you. I'm taking a few hours to myself first," he said, glancing down at Steve and quirking a faint smile.
"Getting real close to it now," Clint muttered, moving to stand next to Stark and glaring at him. "Push one more button, and I swear to god, I'll break your neck if it's the last thing I get to do." The archer was a few inches shorter than Tony, but the set of his jaw and the look in his eye made him about twice as intimidating.
When she rested her legs over his, he grabbed one of her feet and started to run his fingers over the arch, trying to soothe the no doubt tired, sore muscles. He looked up at the last words. "I appreciate it," he said, his smile turning a little sad. He wanted to tell her that she could do exactly that, but he knew better. He knew what the answer would be. They both did. He pressed his lips together and focused on rubbing her feet. "I guess it's alright. Just kind of... I think I will give him a high-five actually. Make the bastard blush," Clint decided.
Steve just smiled in response and licked a drip of precum from the head of Tony's cock. He loved watching Tony fall apart. The man looked at him like he was a dream come true, and it was a feeling he could happily get used to. There were a lot worse things in the world to be than Tony Stark's fantasy. "You tell me if you're having trouble keeping still. I can always stop," Steve teased. Despite the words, he took Tony's hips in his hands and held them firmly as he slowly began to swallow Tony's length from tip to base.
Logan retracted his claws, looking amused. "Remember that," he warned before heading back to his room.
The kiss was enough to leave Phil pleasantly breathless and to bring a blush to his cheeks. He didn't miss Natasha smirking to herself, but she kept her gaze on the screen, giving them a faint illusion of privacy despite the fact that she was more or less inside their personal space. Considering how close the three of them were - they'd tried every sexual combination possible between themselves - it didn't feel as horribly embarrassing as it probably should have. It made Phil self conscious, but it didn't stop him from laying another slow, sensual kiss on Clint's lips.
"That's comforting. Really." It wasn't like Logan to not have an escape plan, but Scott knew that if it really came down to it, the mutant would do whatever he needed to do to escape. Part of him still couldn't believe that of everyone in the universe who could have come to his rescue, it had been Logan in the end. "Maybe for today we just stay in, get really drunk - or, well, I get really drunk - and we try to forget we're supposed to do any fucking thing at all." It sounded like bliss in a way, though Scott suspected that after so much time in captivity, he probably should have wanted to go running through open fields or something instead.
"Just a fetish, huh?" Clint replied, looking amused more than anything. He sobered a little when Phil mentioned his resurrection. It was his turn to reach out and catch hold of the other man's hand. "I'm less worried about postal, more worried about it sticking. I don't think I'd be okay with it... un-sticking," he said the last slowly. He'd worded it intending to keep the comment light, but it hurt to say it. His hand tightened on Phil's as if afraid his handler might suddenly vaporize. "I don't think I can go through that again. Especially not now."
"Tonnyyyy," Steve whined, forcing himself to try and remember how to string more than a few words together while Tony's hand was wrapped around his cock. "Haven't I been tortured enough today?" He knew he was just this side of pouting, but if ever there was an appropriate time for it, this seemed like it. "Promise I'll return the favor." When that still wasn't enough to make Tony give in, Steve met his gaze evenly. "You were going to give me a blow job."
"To be fair, I think I was too busy internally freaking out to really get into it," Coulson answered with a short laugh. He'd been able to feel the power, but he hadn't let himself experience it. He hadn't been in a position of having to use the damn thing the way Clint had. The second they entered the infirmary, medics were putting them through their paces. As expected, Coulson was deemed intact after a few stitches. The nurse was kind enough to slip him some painkillers for the soreness that was to follow, and he drifted over to the stretcher Clint was seated on. "You gonna live?"
To his credit, Tony didn't make a single sound at the bite, though he could tell he was going to need some concealer for it later. "Deal," he agreed, reaching around Logan to grab at Steve's belt, "but both of you are overdressed."
As much as he didn't want to say it, Scott forced himself to proceed. "What if he’s right? What if it's so small that neither one of us sees it?" Logan had, one way or another and for one reason or another, let the god into his mind. That could mean absolutely nothing, or it could mean a whole lot of bad things. He put a hand on the man's chest in a gesture he hoped might placate Logan. "And if Loki is in your head or mine, how the hell would you even know if he didn't want you to? I'm not saying I think we should do anything - you seem like you to me - but I don't want to dismiss it either. If these people are your team, maybe you should trust them a little."
"Carbs when you're dehydrated. Protein fucks up the kidneys," the archer replied around a mouthful of food. He glanced between the clerk and Phil. "You two're gonna haveta explain the donuts and flour thing. Unless it's kinky. Then I'll pass."
Bucky managed a little smile. "Well, I feel okay when you're around," he replied. As badly as he wanted to keep Steve to himself, his words were true. Steve helped keep him grounded while everything else in the world made little sense. A frown shadowing his features, Bucky leaned forward and whispered conspiratorially, "How well do you trust these people?" He glanced around as if he could still be overheard. "Are you sure they're not going to get rid me once they learn everything locked inside my head?"
Clint gave Phil a mock look of betrayal. "Whose side are you on, anyway?" he asked, managing to look completely victimized. He couldn't keep the show up for long, though, with Phil holding him so nicely. He stretched up and kiss Phil's neck, up to the man's lips, lingering there a moment before he remembered they sort of had an audience. Blushing, he looked away. "Sorry. Impulse. And stuff." He leaned back to prop his head against Phil's shoulder, wrapping an arm around Nat's waist and being careful that his hand didn't wander higher or lower.
Clint smirked, raising an eyebrow when May walked behind him. "You think your soul's in here anywhere?" he asked, rummaging through a collection of jars and grimacing at some of their contents. The woman reminded him uncomfortably of Natasha when they'd first met.
Logan pressed in close to Steve, closing the distance between them as much as he could without getting in the way of the blonde's steady thrusts. As Logan slowly pushed his finger into Steve's waiting entrance, he gave Steve a few good, hard bites on the shoulder.
Darien took only a few more strokes to find his release. He gasped and moaned into Clint's mouth, the sound breaking free at the end of the kiss, and his cum splashing over Clint's hand. It was strange to sit exposed in the middle of the kitchen getting jerked off by someone he'd only known for a few days, but it wasn't bad strange. Darien cursed at the sound of footsteps on the other side of the counter and hurriedly grabbed for a towel as he tucked himself back into his slacks.
Just looking at the thing sent a shudder through Scott, but he forced himself to nod, the motion jerky. He knew if he didn't let Clint do it and do it quickly, he wasn't going to let the man do it at all. He closed his eyes and took an uneasy breath. "Go ahead." That Fury had already made preparations to put him into custody should it be needed wasn't exactly surprising. //It's practical,// Scott reminded himself. The blindfold weighed heavily against his face after the freedom he'd been enjoying, and Scott tried not to panic as the door to the cell closed behind Clint.
Clint smiled, feeling a little more at ease with the more familiar situation. Coffee with his handler wasn't unusual. Being told 'anything but country' was also pretty normal. He flipped through the options on the player until he found an artist he knew, stopping at Florence + the Machine and then kicking himself a little at the overly romantic choice. //It's just good music. Don't get all weird.// He pulled up a stool at the bar and watched Coulson go about prepping the coffee. He started to try for smalltalk, then realized there was nothing that he could bring up immediately that didn't seem awkward. "So... you think Stark's any closer to figuring out how to off Loki?" he finally ventured. Bringing up work wasn't the best option necessarily, but discussing his amusement at Nat's antics or anything else that had happened since they left the firing range seemed like an even worse idea.
Tony arched an eyebrow, pleasantly surprised by Steve's show of faith. They were definitely making a lot of headway toward becoming solid teammates. Although he greatly enjoyed their abrasive, teasing relationship, Tony realized that the antagonism had to end. "Alright then, a movie it is," he agreed, tossing a sly wink in Steve's direction. "There's quite a nice selection to choose from, but I think I have something right up your street." The screen came to life and Tony settled back as a digitally remastered copy of a vintage Laurel and Hardy film began to play. "You up for some popcorn?" he asked, giving Steve a gentle nudge.
Natasha pushed the door open quietly and slipped over to Tony's bedside. According to his doctor, the drugs should have been out of his system a good half hour before. Keeping her hands carefully to herself, the woman ventured, "Tony?"
Tony shifted back a little and looked at Steve like he might have a fever. "Hang on; rewind. Did you seriously just invite me to give you an under-the-table BJ the next time we're out to dinner with the team?" he asked, looking like he was pretty sure he'd died and gone to the best heaven possible. "Because I seem to recall someone insisting there was no way we were going to do anything in a restaurant bathroom unless there was a solid deadbolt on the door, and I'm pretty sure that under a table is gonna be way less privacy."
"Doctor's orders. You're in the chair until you're up to Tony's room. Then I pretend that I haven't seen you doing anything at all that you shouldn't be doing," Coulson assured. "Just play along for a few minutes."
Tony lingered behind Steve. He'd been about to call up his own suit when Clint had finally backed down. As the rest of the team started off for the plane, Tony hung back, his hand on Steve's arm to keep the blonde with him and give them some privacy to talk as they walked back. "Glad to see the armor's working." He gave his lover a faint smile. "Looks good on you." He raised an eyebrow, noticing something else as well. "You look like you've put on some weight."
Logan raised an eyebrow at the archer, then cautiously approached Victor, whose blood was pooling around his head. Logan looked his brother over, then glanced back to Nat. "It'd take more than that to kill 'im, but he's gonna take a minute to start breathin' again. Might wanna put some handcuffs on 'im."
It was the better part of an hour before a doctor appeared again. The man looked haggard but less fearful than before. "Captain Rogers is in stable condition. We still have him on oxygen since he's having some difficulties breathing, but his heart rate is normal. We hope he'll be waking up sometime in the next few hours." The man hesitated, looking the group over. "I don't think too many visitors would be a good idea."
He stared back at her like she was a complete idiot for a moment before catching on and forcing a smile instead. "Oh, sure. Not a problem. Just because he's actually managed to kill more than one member of the Avengers in the past, and he controls minds and... Jemma, really, what can an examination-"
Clint watched her suspiciously, backing away until his legs hit a gurney. The hammer hadn't dulled his ability to tell when someone was hiding something. Especially when it was Simmons. The woman was the worst liar on the planet, he was certain. He almost hadn't noticed Bruce sidling up to the young woman, and his gaze turned to the man.
"He'll be fine," Pepper's voice assured from just behind him before her own hand slid into his. "He's survived worse."
As he finished his speech, the room erupted in a roar of applause. Tony smiled, nodded and bowed to the assembled group. Was it his imagination, or was Steve clapping the loudest? Then, there came another sound. Barely perceptible, like the buzzing of a gnat. Too late Tony recognized the noise. It was a shot. From high above, the glittering chandelier snapped from its chain, plummeting down and pinning Tony.
"Fury said I wasn't allowed to design any. Something about not wanting rocket packs attached," Tony's voice came over his comm. He buzzed over the pair one more time - scanning the area for Loki - before settling next to Steve. He blasted off a split second later, though, as an elephant charged them, narrowly missing the pair. Settling back on the ground and watching the pachyderm disappear into the city, Tony winced inside his helmet. "Well, that's gonna ruin someone's day. I think Loki's been watching too much Jumanji." He knew Loki would likely show his face sooner than later but was surprised that the god wasn't already making an appearance. //You'd think me flying around all over the place would get his attention. Shiny, and all.// "You think he forgot us?"
"Oh, I can hide it well enough." A moment's thought and Loki's skin looked as normal as ever, pale but unmarred by any trace of blue. "As it turns out, however," the blue faded back in, "even I balk at the idea of spending every waking moment hiding behind a mask. You'll notice I was only willing to wear the good Captain's face for so long." Loki stalked over to Stark, glaring down at him. "At the moment, neither one of us knows what you've done with that weapon. For a man who seems so adverse to the idea of death, you seem ever eager to wake monsters."
Feeling the weight of the things he wasn't telling his new team, Scott nodded haltingly. "Let's get through everything with Loki, then we'll figure it out."
Steve wasn't sure if it was the words themselves or the fact that Tony was whispering in his ear, but Steve's breath caught. He couldn't turn his head because if he did Tony would be far, far too close. "Think I'll stick with clothes," he answered in a tone that was meant to be light and teasing but came out breathy and nervous instead. Logically he knew that Tony was just trying to get a rise out of him. The unfortunate part of that was just how well it was working. "Thanks for the help. Um, with the computer."
Tony tensed, glancing up at Steve and caught in a rare moment of being at a loss for words. "It is hard to picture," he eventually replied. "You won't find very many." Shaking off the sobering thoughts of his father, Tony reminded himself that Steve had actually known the man. "Anyway, I'm tired of holding this towel up, so I'll go and change while you get settled in here." With that, he turned on his heel and started out of the bedroom, but not before dropping the towel and offering Steve a shameless view of his departing backside.
Natasha managed a flickering smile at the kiss, the words, the perfect mess that was the way Clint told stories. She nodded and breathed through the pain, knowing it wasn't physical. The doctors had said as much. It was in her head. All of it was in her head. The realization threatened to make her spiral off again, and Nat forcefully stopped it. "He was in my head. Loki. He wanted to know... something... I don't know what." She took a slower breath. "I think he found it."
The coffee cup more or less disappeared under the hoodie, and Clint sighed before finally looking up and offering Darien a faint smile. "Thanks," he said. When Darien strayed a little too close, he caught the man by the sleeve and pulled him into a quick, rough kiss. The contact was possessive, not warm, and Clint punctuated it with an appreciative slap on Darien's ass. "Working already."
"You don't," Natasha countered breezily. "You don't hate either one of us. That's why Clint didn't put an arrow through my head to start with."
Victor snorted. "You will be. Because you're gonna remember this. You'll never forget it," he growled, groaning as he slowly worked himself into Phil's body. It was a tight fit, and the near total lack of lube didn't make it comfortable. But that wasn't the point.
Steve had barely finished the soft plea when Tony's hand was around the man's shaft, his lips at the blonde's neck. "You know you're maddeningly sexy, right? I've mentioned that, haven't I?" he asked, stroking his lover slowly. "Love seeing you turned on, watching you cum..." There was something about making someone so seemingly clean cut look so debauched that Tony found it irresistible.
The quiet confession was harder to hear than the yelling, and Steve tried to find the right words to ease the situation. The truth was that Bucky had a point. If things had happened a different way and at a different time, his own reactions would have been entirely different. He’d spent half his youth being in love with Bucky without ever realizing it. But things were different. Despite Tony cutting him off entirely, Steve cared more than he really knew how to express. “It isn’t fair. This whole thing,” Steve agreed with a sigh. “It’s not fair to you or to me or to Tony. It isn’t, and… I’m not helping. Not the way you need me to.” He glanced around the room, at the boxes still littering the space. “I thought things could go back to being the way they were - just us being roomies and looking out for each other, and that was stupid. It’s a different time and a different place. Nothing’s the same. I’m sorry. I… I should get my stuff, get back to my old room. I’m making it worse right now, and that’s the last thing I want to do.”
Coulson snapped to his feet the second the doors opened. The doctor looked exhausted, which was a terrible sign considering it had been less than ten minutes. A sick feeling of fear washed through him. "Status?"
"Jarvis, cancel the drunk excuse. Steve, I think Joe Public knows about everyone else I've kissed, so I'm not worried about what other people know," Tony explained. Really, it barely mattered anymore. As far as his social life was concerned, the most shocking thing Tony could think of would probably be met with an adoring grin, shrug of the shoulders, and a comment along the lines of "That's Tony Stark!" At least, as far as most people were concerned. Fury seemed able to get his eyepatch in a twist no matter how many times Tony managed to push the bounds of human decency. //Or inhuman decency,// he reminded himself, flicking a look at Logan.
Steve gritted his teeth together and counted to ten before he tried again. Tony was hard to deal with at the best of times. Yelling wouldn’t help even if Steve knew he might feel better doing it. The aftermath wouldn’t be worth it. “You’re sorely mistaken if you don’t think I’ll throw you over my shoulder and carry you out of this room. Killing yourself isn’t going to make you feel better any faster.” After a moment of thought, he reached out and rested a gentle hand on Tony’s shoulder. “Talk to me, Tony. I know I can’t make it go away, but I can listen.”
Clint couldn't help but laugh a little, mostly because it almost felt absurd in his mind that someone would want to keep him around in any of the senses that Phil meant. "I suppose, but you're going to have to feed me, water me, and walk me twice a day," he returned easily, his usually gruff voice even rougher from sleep. His hand slid down Phil's chest, resting on his stomach as he leaned up to brush their lips together, careful to stop breathing long enough to avoid giving Phil a dose of his morning breath. "I am a pretty big responsibility, though. I've even been told I'm a pain in the ass."
"Pancakes," Steve agreed, reluctantly drawing back from the embrace. He knew it wouldn't always feel wrong or strange. He didn't want to get used to being the man he'd left behind, but Steve knew that he could with Tony's help. "I'll make us some coffee if you handle the food." He felt better moving around Tony's kitchen doing something boring and normal. Catching the tension on Tony's face, Steve caught the man's wrist and gave a gentle tug. "I know this is weird, but I'm not going to break. I don't want you to either."
Phil chose not to point out that the lack of an armrest created a new sort of awkward situation, but he knew that the concern was mostly on his own part. Clint had no reason to feel awkward. The movie started soon enough, and he was glad of the distraction. It was the perfect kind of stupid, overdone and often poorly acted and funny more often than not. He chuckled at the right spots and did everything in his power to think about only the screen and not at all about the mess still waiting for them at the Tower.
Tony couldn't help the somewhat undignified whimper that slipped out of him at that last. "Fuck, Steve," he breathed, hand tangling in Steve's hair to jerk him into a rough kiss. "It's entirely too hot when you talk dirty," he decided, using his weight to more or less pin Steve to the bed. He nibbled at Steve's neck before starting to slowly kiss his way downward, nipping at the blonde's slender body before he slid his hands down to part his lover's ass cheeks. Tony's tongue was prodding lightly at Steve's entrance before the blonde could have a chance to figure out what was coming.
"They're good, actually. Bobby's probably taken over for me," Scott admitted with a hint of a smile. "He's stronger than people thought. Rogue is too, she's just... she's got a lot to figure out. She'll get there." The young woman was continually looking for a way out instead of a way to use what she had. Eventually she'd have to realize there was no way out. "She's not stupid. She'll put it together. Bobby can help if she'll let him. The rest... is messy. That's my fault, not theirs. It's why I left. I had a role there that I'd always fit into. When I stopped fitting, I stopped knowing how to handle things. I stopped knowing the next step. You can't lead other people if you don't even know where you're going, and things got messy on all fronts."
Scott watched Steve go with a sense of relief. He moved into Logan's personal space as soon as the Captain headed out. "You okay?" He knew strolls down memory lane rarely did anything to make Logan feel good. The strange thing was the way he'd been watching Steve, a predatory flicker of something that made Scott think uncomfortably about some encounters they'd had involving Jean. "Sounds like we're in reserve until he has a chance to talk to Fury. We could go back to bed if you want." Scott said no more, uncertain if Logan would want to bury himself in the dark and sleep or do something else entirely. Given the thoughts he might've waded through to provide Steve even the small sliver of information, he knew it could go either way.
"Well, whoever your boss is, you'd think he'd get you some clothes. I mean, where're your gonna put that gun when you're done with - " Tony was cut off by Jarvis's proximity detector squealing at him just before something massive slammed into him and knocked him to the ground. The loud growl that accompanied the attack had him convinced it was a lion until four thin metal claws cut through his face mask like butter, stopping millimeters from his eyes. Tony managed to get one hand under himself and fire off the thruster, sending dirt flying one way and himself and his attacker another.
"Yeah, we did," Tony said, hooking a finger under Steve's chin to urge him up into a kiss. It was just a peck on the lips, then another, then Tony lightly nibbled at the plush lower lip. He caught the soft flesh gently between his teeth and tugged before finally pressing his mouth fully to Steve's. Tony couldn't help but feel a little nervous. He was afraid he'd hurt Steve, push him too far. He realized suddenly that it must have been what his lover had gone through every time they'd had sex. //Shoe's on the other foot,// he reflected as his hands slowly tugged Steve's shirt upward, letting him run his hands over the blonde's lean back.
True to his promise, Steve stayed by Tony's side all night and all through the next day. Night was already falling by the time Tony badgered the doctors into granting his release. It didn't hurt that he had Steve there promising to look after him and not let him overtax his healing body. If he'd had his own way, Steve would have insisted Tony stay in the hospital, but the place was depressing enough that he didn't want to stay himself. Instead he hovered by Tony's side, gathered his things, led him out to the car, and even sat next to him in the backseat on the drive home.
Natasha reached out and rubbed a hand over the man's back. "It's okay. We've all been doing it the past few days," she offered quietly, knowing the tears were coming long before they actually did. Tony Stark was not the kind of man who was easy to like, but once he was under your skin, he stayed there. Over the years she'd known him, even Natasha had grown strangely fond of Stark. So slipping into a seat next to Steve and holding him in a loose hug felt perfectly natural even though some of the others at the table looked at her in obvious surprise. Natasha didn't mind bucking people's expectations. In fact she rather enjoyed it.
Tony couldn't hold back a shudder at the touch or the ragged gasp that followed it. "Well, might as well make the best of it, right?" he blustered, though the quaver in his voice betrayed him. He wasn't so scared of dying as he was of what Loki would do with him until he did. Steve already thought he was dead, a thought which hurt Tony more than anything else. All that was left was for him to make sure that Clint and Phil lived. "At least I'll be a good-looking corpse." Tony had to swallow back a sense of nausea and remind himself of the teammates his sacrifice would save.
"Well, this is very deja vu," Tony sulked as he took over the chair and wheeled himself towards the bedroom. "At least you didn't threaten to tase me while looking unnervingly excited at the prospect. I guess we all grow up a little, Coulson." Stopping at his bedroom door, he twisted in his chair. "Supernanny's on channel twelve. No raspberry scones, and there's probably nothing in the fridge, but you're welcome to whatever you find. And stay out of my scotch." With that, he disappeared into his room.
Logan obliged, having completely forgotten - or ceased to care - about his lover's already well-used condition. He drove into Scott mercilessly, relishing the strangled cries of pleasure and moans from his lover, the way the man clawed at the bedding, the way he begged. Logan cried out in utter pleasure, cumming hard and flooding his lover with seed as he gripped Scott tight against him.
"In more than one way, yes," Tony answered, returning Steve's grin with one of his own. After all the teasing, he was already half hard, and he immediately dragged Steve into a long, hungry kiss. He drew back, eyes hooded and lips parted as he sighed heavily. "I need you," he murmured, the words emphatic rather than pleading as Tony held tight to the other man.
The conversation had gone over Steve's head almost as soon as it started. He didn't like the look Bruce was giving Tony, though. Whereas Tony often talked over his head on purpose just to keep him from being entirely in the loop, Bruce tried to keep most of what he said accessible to everyone listening - at least as much as he could with part of the audience being as technically uncertain as Steve. "English?"
It was a nice thought, really, staying in the ducts, but it wasn't practical. He heard Natasha make a sound of pain and anger as someone apparently got hold of her, and he swung himself down, lining up a shot on Creed that was as likely to piss the guy off as take him down. The tranq rounds in the barrel weren't likely to slow him down for more than a few seconds, but it would give Clint time to recover. He squeezed the trigger while searching for Natasha. He spotted her tangling with a guy whose tongue looked longer than half the building. She looked more revolted than worried, so Phil kept his attention with Clint. The last thing he was willing to do was leave Barton in the lurch to save his own ass.
Tony gripped Loki's hips roughly, more than aware by then how much the god appreciated some pain. He guided Loki's hips, doing his best to thrust up to meet the movements, trying to strike that perfect spot inside his partner's body. Tony could feel himself getting close, and began pressing kisses, bites, and licks in equal measure on any skin he could reach, worshiping the god in the only way Tony Stark was ever going to. He watched Loki's face closely, all but forgetting the odd cast to the god's skin as Tony found himself beginning to moan with each shift of Loki's hips.
Steve stared. He couldn't stop. Until Tony raised an eyebrow and he realized that he was staring. Then he blushed, swallowed, and gestured vaguely to the box he'd left by the door. "I, uh, was just wondering what room you'd like me to take." //Don't stare. Don't stare.// Sure that he had himself back together again, Steve tried to smile casually. "Didn't mean to interrupt your shower."
"Eh, I don't know that it's true. I just know Coulson had a collection of Cap cards that he apparently was butthurt about Fury destroying in the name of faking his death. And Stark was sayin' the guy's a big fan." He shrugged. "For all I know, the dude's the most normal one here."
"Everyone else who knows is dead," she pointed out. "That's how you can tell you're special." Natasha wasn't prone to sentiment of any kind, but she felt a certain softness when it came to Clint and his happiness. "Sleep. I'll make coffee in the morning."
The mutant shifted appreciatively against Tony's fingers, refocusing enough to pull Steve in for another breathtaking kiss.
Claws slowly eased from Logan's forearms, more in preparation for a fight than anything, but the timing was right, "Want some?"
Clint felt sure his stomach knot and wondered if part of this guy's schtick was reading minds. He tried to come up with a decent reply, but found himself stumped for once.
“You worry too much," she answered, smiling just the same. It hurt to know that she couldn't offer all that he truly needed. "I'll always come back." As badly as she wanted to lose herself in the comfort Clint offered, it wasn't the time. "We should check on Steve. Stark looked bad. Coulson may need help keeping him from killing the medical staff."
Clint stared hard at the other man for a few moments before lowering the weapon and putting it away. "We kind of figured," he answered, still watching Scott's every move. "Especially after I had to shoot him." Clint perched on one of the kitchen chairs, apparently relaxed. "So, what are we missing?" he wanted to know.
Logan wasn't having it. He leaned in close to Stark and looked him hard in the eye, their noses millimeters from contact. "You say one fucking word to him about what happened, and I'll personally present Loki with yer liver as a souvenir," he growled, no amount of jest in his voice.
Clint felt a little bad for embarrassing Coulson even further. Though it was kind of amusing to see the guy so flustered. The mention of him with Natasha made him tense. His moments with her always felt so exposed, anyway. Knowing someone else had seen some of them... //Couldn't be helped, he reminded himself.// "Well, if I'm honest, I have to say I'm impressed you can still make eye contact," Clint said, trying to lighten the subject a bit. "Like I said before... Glad it was you, not someone else."
Half hard and dying to make Clint follow through with the promise. Phil gripped Clint's hand tightly, sharing the tension. The last thing he wanted was for Clint to think it was lack of interest keeping him from saying yes. Unfortunately he knew better. He knew that no matter how anonymous a moment felt, there were always eyes. The only eyes he wanted on Clint's body anymore were his, so Phil knew he'd have to be at least a little patient. "When we get back, I'm going to take the longest, coldest shower of my life."
"He's seein' things," Logan refuted. SHIELD didn't have psychics, and there was nothing that could be proven. It was his word against Nat's, and she was obviously in a lot worse shape than him. "I haven't done anything to hurt SHIELD." It was halfway a truth. He hadn't done anything on purpose. He'd hoped that what he'd done was harmless.
Though an odd feeling still lingered in the air, Scott waved the apology off. "The team's more important."
Not above a little begging when it got what he wanted, Tony had already taken a breath to do just that when Steve's hand slid over his aching length. The blonde's voice, raspy with arousal, combined with his touch, served to drive that breath from Tony's lungs in a long, low moan. "Ohfuckyes," he breathed, one hand clutching at Steve's shoulder as he arched into the contact. The sting of the marks Logan had left on him were easily forgotten with the rush of sensation. Tony bit back the urge to tell Steve how much he'd needed this. He didn't want to see what effect that might have with Logan present. Instead, he leaned in and nuzzled Steve's throat, pressing a few kisses and bucking his hips against the man's hand in a silent plea.
Logan was glad he'd decided to let Scott have full control. The man was an expert at picking up his cues, doing just the right things without Logan saying a word and barely making a sound. Logan couldn't keep silent for long, though. He was soon moaning softly with every perfect shift, every flick of Scott's tongue and shift of his lips. "Nngh... God..." He was getting close, and he managed to warn Scott of as much. The hand that had been roaming, trying to touch every bit of his lover, settled on Scott's shoulder, gripping him lightly as Logan's breath caught in his throat.
Scott almost choked on the beer. He sputtered and tried to smile, feeling uncertain and confused and more than slightly flattered. "Thanks." It was the most coherent thing he could think of, and Scott felt glowingly proud of himself for having managed that much grace given the situation and his level of inebriation. "I guess maybe I should hold off on picking somebody up until I don't wake up screaming or whatever. Not everybody's as understanding as you are." Scott realized the way that sounded a second later given their current topic of conversation. He almost corrected himself but didn't. If Logan could be comfortable calling him attractive, he wasn't going to stumble all over himself talking about the fact that they'd slept together - even if it had been very literal sleeping.
Tony shifted uneasily in his chair. It was going to be a little difficult explaining everything without telling them Loki's secret and a bunch of other things he was pretty sure didn't need to be shared. "Look, Loki had a chance to kill me. We talked." He held up a finger when Fury looked ready to ask for details. "Personal stuff, Nick. I'm not here to air his dirty laundry," he said even as Fury gave him a look that suggested he'd like to strangle Tony himself. "Bottom line is, you can do all the brain scans you want on me, or whatever else it takes, but I came to this conclusion on my own. You should, at the least, leave him alive. But I think he'd be a valuable SHIELD asset, as well."
He barely realized when Jarvis shut the feed off because he was too busy sobbing into his folded arms, heedless of how uncomfortable it was resting his head on the cold metal. When he finally came around to the world outside his own head again, he heard Jarvis saying, "Keep trying, Sir. If Mr. Stark could learn, anyone can."
Seeing Tony go pale a second before he began to shiver, Steve looked up only to find Natasha already holding out an airsick bag as he settled Tony into a seat on the jet. "We'll be home soon," he assured, helpless to do more than that. He hated feeling so useless, but until they got back to the tower, there wasn't much to do but strap Tony in and try to make sure he was comfortable.
Victor scowled. "Can I keep the archer? He was fun." Getting a threatening glower from Loki, the mutant scowled but nodded. "I'll have 'em out of here as soon as I get clothes on." He smirked at Loki. "Call me?" he teased before ducking back into his room to change.
Scott snorted at that. "Not so much. Not that I object to getting laid, but... First problem is that she's terrifying. Second problem... I don't know. I need something to get me out of myself, and going after somebody who looks like Jean's little sister doesn't exactly sound like the right follow up." He paused and took a long drink. "I need change. I came here because I need change. I don't want to let myself start doing the same things over again. What's the point? What the hell's the point then?" The idea of letting leaving his life behind and going through hell be for nothing was disheartening. Scott shook his head and squared his jaw resolutely. "I'm not doing it like that again."
Tony nodded, feeling numb as the reality set in. Not only was he going out without Steve and without a guarantee of success, but he was going out there as team leader. Everyone was going to be depending on him. He glanced at Steve as he pulled on one of his high tech bodysuits and meandered into the bathroom to take care of his morning routine. Some people were going to be depending on him in ways that weighed more heavily.
"There's a difference between being physically vulnerable and being mentally vulnerable," Steve pointed out sharply. He could tell Clint wasn't going to back down on the issue, and he could see by the set of Coulson's shoulders that he wasn't going to either. The idea of a screaming match in the middle of the cafeteria didn't particularly appeal to him considering how much of a mess the team had been in the eyes of SHIELD already. "You get a say, Clint, but it isn't your call, and you know that already."
Steve could barely begin to express his gratitude. "I owe you. Big. Like, waxing Lola for a year or..." He shook his head, still smiling, and gave Tony's hand a squeeze.
"Mmmm..." Just the thought of a nice, cozy cabin and nights spent curled up in front of the fire with Tony left him feeling better even if cold wasn’t his favorite by and large. "The cabin. Definitely." Knowing Tony it would be a "cozy" ten bedroom mansion, but it was the thought that counted. "You, me, chilly nights, a warm fire? That sounds pretty close to perfection if you ask me. Then we can get mostly naked and go hang out at the beach next vacation." It was presumptuous to assume that they'd be together for more than one vacation, for long enough to make that happen, but it felt right. Steve believed they would be, and it was as simple as that.
When they got there, Clint was reluctant to leave Phil's side, but he knew he needed to. They both needed their privacy for the whole process. The docs gave him an intrusive once over before deciding he needed an antibiotic shot and stitching up about half the claw marks in his back. They wanted an immediate psych evaluation as well, but Clint begged them off, pleading exhaustion. They did insist on him getting a shower and handed him some simple grey sweats and a white shirt to change into.
By the time they got back to base, Phil wasn't sure which thing warring for its share of the stress he felt really won out. First there was the god who'd killed him, then there was the psychotic mutant who'd raped him, and then there was Clint clinging to an evil Asgardian weapon like it was a teddy bear he didn't intend to let go of. He rose the second May had the plane stilled. "Barton, Logan, Romanov, with me. Let's get that in a cell in the deepest, darkest corner of SHIELD we can find. If he's lucky he'll survive long enough to end up in the Fridge." It was a big if the way Clint was eyeing the mutant, honestly.
"Uh, okay," Darien answered. He was amazed and creeped out to find a closet full of things precisely fitted to him. He chose a pair of jeans and a dark button down with no idea where they were going or why. It seemed like a good sign that Clint wasn't sick of him and that he wasn't afraid to go out in public either. It meant Clint didn't think he was going to run the first chance he got. Frankly Darien had nowhere to run to. They both knew it. "What exactly is the plan?" he asked as he pulled on a pair of docs that, yes, fit him with disturbing perfection.
Tony pushed himself up painfully - the sudden movements hadn't done anything for his injuries - just to see where his reflexive throw had landed. "Uhh... oops."
Steve faltered and more or less stopped breathing for several seconds. The air rushed back into his lungs with an audible gasp, and Steve tried to find something to say. On top of everything else, Steve felt himself drifting into a strange parody of a fantasy he’d let go of when Bucky was lost. Tony had revived it in a way, dragging up feelings and questions he had buried carefully. “You wouldn’t?” The words could have easily been a joke. Steve wanted to tread lightly.
No response was forthcoming, but Steve entered the room a few moments later with a bag full of soda and a stack of pizza and breadsticks. "Hey, sorry - they took forever." He stole a kiss from Tony and then set the pizza down on the barest counter he could find. "I hope nobody-" Steve fished his phone out of his pocket once his hands were free and nodded at the message there. He leaned in to whisper into Tony's ear, "You can meet me somewhere tonight," before ducking away and pulling some paper plates out of the bag. "Dig in, folks. I got cheese, pepperoni, and some kind of special thing with lots of vegetables."
"It would be stupid not to," Natasha answered simply after it had all been laid out for her. Logan and Scott were falling apart, and she didn't want to do the same. "Something tells me it won't hurt more or less whether I'm in a cell or out of one." Behind her eyes the pressure swelled and ebbed, sometimes too much for her to bear and sometimes a mild throb at the back of her mind. "And I'll be safer - you'll be safer - if I'm in one."
Tony nodded at that, unsure whether his being awake was really such a good thing after all. “Whatever those meds were, they knocked me out big time. And that never happens. I’ll have to make a note to take a doggy bag home.” Flippancy came to Tony with the ease of breathing. He’d always fallen back on it when things got too serious. Not only did it help him to think, but it also managed to put everyone around him off guard. “Do you think they’ll be springing me out of here soon?” he wondered aloud. “I’d really like to get back to work on some things; important things.”
"You could start with me," Tony offered as Logan dove in to raise a hickey on Steve's neck. The smallest of the three of them managed to wiggle between Logan and Steve.
Though he knew there were probably meetings going on, Steve doubted he could keep his cool, and he didn't really want to have the team see him falling apart. Instead he headed upstairs to the living area that the Avengers were all intended to share once the apartments were done and the others moved in. He ordered JARVIS to bring up any information that had been gathered on the attack, but before the anything could come up on the large television screen, another image popped up.
"Y-yes," Scott managed, shuddering in response to the stinging pleasure of Logan's teeth digging into his skin. He knew there would be a mark, knew even as it happened that Logan was reclaiming him, and the primal nature of that thought was shockingly hot. "Fuck, Logan... fuck..."
Bucky's blind rage gradually faded. When his senses returned, he blinked as if waking from a dream. Instead of being seated at the table, he was on his feet. Agent Coulson stood right across from him, aiming a weapon at him. //What the hell...?// Bucky raised his hands in the universal sign of surrender. "Hey, look... I don't know what just happened, but I'm not going to give you any trouble." No sooner had he gotten the words out of his mouth than Bucky was hit by another migraine. He squeezed his eyes shut and held his head in his hands. The pain crippled to him to the point where he fell to his knees.
Logan looked more annoyed than usual. "I have four phrases and a kung fu grip." He tried to focus on how much Clint was irritating him instead of the fact that they were in an airplane.
Sometimes when they met, both of them so often leaving for other ventures soon after, Nat couldn't bring herself to draw things out. She demanded more the second they came together. She enjoyed the harsh, quick times with Clint fucking her against the nearest wall or over the closest table. Times like this were nice too, times when they had enough leeway to enjoy it. "I'm going to cum at least once before you get to fuck me," Nat said, her attention back to Clint. "Keep that up and you'll get what you want in no time. We both know I can wait as long as it takes, but I'd really rather not wait."
"Fury probably won't care. The Council's gonna have their skivvies in a twist, though," Clint noted. "I'll just be glad when he'll let me have beer again." He sagged back in his seat, relaxing from the tension he hadn't noticed had crept up on him. It felt better to have made some sort of move in a useful direction. "So, what's the deal with those two back there? Xavier and Grey? What's their... mutant... thing?"
Steve found himself nodding, too shocked to think of a proper response. “Yeah. I will. I will,” he assured, seeing a flicker of doubt in Bucky’s eyes. The whole thing would take a lot of thinking, but Steve wasn’t ready to close any doors.
Though she hated to interrupt the moment, Simmons quietly cleared her throat. "Captain? I'm afraid I need to check your vitals as well. It shouldn't take a moment." Thanks to Stark's equipment, the process was quick and relatively painless regardless of what they needed to know.
Clint rolled his eyes in a way that would've made Tony Stark proud. "It's a thing humans get when we drink too much. Happens the next day? Hurts a lot?"
"Fair enough," Tony admitted, leaning in to nip at Steve's neck. He had to remind himself to trust Steve to tell him if anything was too much. His hand stroked more firmly over Steve's cock as he started working his lover's neck. He nipped and then sucked at the spot right below Steve's ear, raising a hickey before he drew back with a faint smile. "You'll still be wearing that one in the morning." It was kind of a satisfying thought in spite of the reasons for it.
Tony felt that Steve had gone to a hell of a lot more trouble than that, and he wanted the other man to know how much he appreciated the effort. "Not too shabby for an old guy," agreed Tony. "I can't remember the last time I consumed anything that wasn't 100 proof." The painful reminder of barricading himself against the whole world was not what they needed for the night. Tony quickly banished the memory and flashed Steve a warm smile. "I can't exactly guarantee I won't be making a pig of myself. A stunningly gorgeous pig, but a pig all the same."
"Thanks. Try to keep up with the upkeep... maintenance... regular washing," Steve muttered as he flipped the cap on the bottle and coated his fingers. It wasn't that he wanted to rush, it was just that they were in the back of a car, and it would eventually get uncomfortable. The feeling of Tony's ass pressing against him and the way it tightened and then gave way to his fingers... well, that he wasn't going to be uncomfortable with any time soon. Steve swallowed hard. The muscles clenching down around him felt like heaven. "I have no idea what I was just saying. None."
Fury had lived up to his name. He was angry at Loki, not at them, but since the team was present, they were the ones who bore witness to the Director getting as close as he ever did to truly losing his cool.
"You really are," Phil answered, palming Clint's cock for a moment before fumbling with his zipper between them and shoving down his underwear until he could feel the other man hot and hard in his hand. He reversed their positions in a heartbeat, shoving Clint against the wall and then sliding to his knees. He'd taken a second to tuck himself back into his underwear first but not much else. It was more important to show Clint just how wanted he was. Suspecting that the other man didn't have the patience for a lot of screwing around, Phil went for it, sucking Clint down to the base in one go, his eyes locked on the other man's face.
Logan nodded his understanding. He could relate, in a way. Sometimes even a shithole apartment was better than having to see the same damned people every day even on your day off. He really wanted Scott in his bed every night, but he was able to tolerate having him a few doors down. The idea of Scott being a half hour away or on the other side of town made Logan uncomfortable. He wasn't going to protest, though. He could understand Scott's need for privacy. "I'm sure SHIELD would pay ya enough to get a decent place," he said, deciding on his order and then setting the menu aside.
Though inside he bristled at the question, Steve forced himself to nod, "Yes. My credentials haven't changed. My skills haven't changed."
"You know, I'm pretty sure he's a couple of triggers from 'homicidal maniac'," Tony remarked without any apparent concern. He grudgingly moved his gaze to Coulson. "So... What'm I supposed to say? 'I kissed a boy, and I liked it'?"
"Asking a god - well, someone who pretends they are a god - for anything? Pretty high on the weird scale," Fitz agreed. He could barely wrap his head around everything that had happened over the past few days. It was a bizarre turn to be faced with gods and monsters and to accept that they were entirely real and apparently part of the new order.
The idea of leaving cut Tony like a knife, but he knew Steve was right. They both needed the rest. Tony risked leaning up a little to press another kiss to Steve's forehead as he held the pad in hand, smiling at the last footnote. The relaxed, caring smile was one he hadn't worn in a long, long time, but it came unbidden when Steve professed his love, even in writing. "Alright. I'll go rest. For you. Just you," he promised. He started to hand the notepad back to Steve, then stopped. He carefully tore the small corner off, the last two words Steve had written, folded it neatly, and then placed it into his wallet. "Love you, too," he returned as he did so. He pressed one more kiss to Steve's forehead, then drew back a little and quirked an eyebrow at the blonde. "You’ve gotta get out of here before I get better. I think there were plans about what I was gonna do to you once I get the stitches out," he said, winking a before he carefully rolled the wheelchair back out into the hallway with Coulson. "Any chance of catching a lift back to my room?" he asked.
"It sounds that way." It had actually sounded mostly like made up words, but saying so would have been rude, and Steve wasn't the type to be rude without provocation, so he kept the opinion to himself. "Does it really look like the gun'll do enough to take Loki down this time?"
Phil rolled his eyes but couldn't help a flash of fondness. He always enjoyed working with Clint and Natasha because there was an odd sort of synergy between them, each possessing something that the other lacked. Clint definitely had most of the energy. For someone who could sit, barely breathing, for hours while he waited for a target, Clint was a mass of fidgeting nerves most of the time. Phil reached out, popping open a panel on the dash, and pointed to a more up-to-date interface than the one displayed on Lola's otherwise vintage-looking radio. "There's a week's worth of music programmed in there. If you can't find something you enjoy, I despair of your taste."
Realistically Coulson knew that Clint was probably screwing with his head. Less realistically he found himself unable to resist using his grip on Clint's hips to close the last of the distance between them. "This the kind of moving you had in mind?" Of course Clint felt as good as he looked. He was all heat and hard muscle, and Coulson couldn't keep himself from wondering what it would be like to explore the same thing without clothes in the way.
Phil blinked. The comment was as out of left field as he expected from Clint. "You're not wrong," Phil answered. "If he wasn't so busy trying to dominate the human race, he could try the theater." Phil wondered if Thor really saw something worth saving in Loki or if he just wanted to. "I try to remind myself that being that crazy starts somewhere. It's hard to think of him as the victim, though."
"Ohh, unresolved sexual tension. Well, understandable. I'm pretty magnetic," he decided, happily snuggling up to the other man. He winced as his stitches tugged, squirming to get close to Steve without pressuring the bandages or sutures. "Just... A little... Ok, ok... and good." He sighed. "Well, I thought you were an uptight ass. But... well, hard to resist that ass. And..." Tony looked away, feeling faintly nervous. "I guess, when I woke up after... after the whole vortex thing, the look on your face was... it stuck with me. I'm not sure how to... Weird, having someone care that much when they didn’t have to." New York had pretty well done in what was left of his relationship with Pepper. That had left Tony even more fixated on the way Steve had been looking at him when he'd been jolted awake.
They managed to get the last large party horseshoe booth in the joint, Logan and Scott toward one end, Clint flanked by Nat and Phil on the other. Clint ordered himself a stout, then raised an eyebrow when Logan ordered a beer for himself as well. "I thought you couldn't get drunk?"
"Should work. Vodka and chocolate - she likes the dark stuff that's barely sweet," Steve pointed out. He nuzzled in close to Tony and kissed his lips softly only to leave off to take another sip of wine. They weren't in a hurry. For just one night they were pretending that they had forever. They had the life they were trying to plan together. Steve let himself live in that moment, let the fuzzy warmth of the alcohol take him over as he melted against Tony's side. "I love the moments like this. We need lots and lots of moments like this."
Clint sighed quietly and nodded. "Yeah. But we're gonna need a cab," he said, a smirk slowly replacing his look of irritation. He could have a discussion with Nat about trying to manipulate him into dating his handler later. Still somewhat buzzed and full of endorphins from the orgasm, irritation was more easily replaced with amusement at the idea of what the whole situation implied. "I think she went home with Logan and Summers. Like, went home, home," he said, a bit of admiration in his eyes. He wouldn't have figured Summers would have gone for it. At all. //Leave it to Tash.//
Bruce nodded, reluctantly letting go of Jemma's waist only to place his hands on her shoulders. "I'll do that. But get what rest you can. We may need you two to solve things long-range for us." He gave her a gentle squeeze, then pulled her in for another kiss before offering her one last smile. "I'll see you tomorrow. Have some coffee ready for me when we get back. I get the feeling there won't be time before we leave." With another wave, Bruce disappeared down the hallway.
They were on the outskirts of the city, and Logan didn't want to camp too close to the slave operation and arouse suspicions, so he made a point to get a good hour's worth of road behind them before he picked a hotel. Fortunately, not many people were stirring so late, and it was easy to sneak Scott into the room he'd reserved without catching someone's eye. Logan handed Scott a change of his clothes. "They might be a little big, but they'll cover ya," he said.
"For him to get Tony." Steve swung his legs off the bed and glared at Coulson as the man put a hand on his chest. "It was Bucky. It-"
Steve let himself breathe again as the room settled into awkward silence. He wanted to leave. He wanted to leave the room and take Tony away. He also didn't want to leave the team alone with Loki. Given that most of them were together, it was as good a time as any to fill them in. "Loki's going to be staying here for awhile with Thor as a bodyguard. He's... well, he's more or less asked for asylum, and we're granting it on a trial basis."
"Best description I can come up with. It actually drains cellular energy. Normal person, it'd kill them with one or two trigger squeezes," Bruce explained, gesturing to the image floating in the room as Tony wrapped his arms around himself and sagged back into his wheelchair. "If I try it, the big guy turns up, makes a mess." He glanced at Tony. "We tried. With controls," he added before Coulson could protest.
"Oh, of course. I'll keep checking things out, and if I find anything that's at all amiss, I'll let you both know immediately, but," Jemma assured hurriedly, "I don't anticipate any issues."
If he'd wanted to stop, Darien might have pointed out that Clint could use some shutting up from time to time too. Instead he kept working and let himself get off on Clint's obvious arousal. It didn't take feeling Clint's cock pulsing in his throat to know the guy enjoyed every last move he made.Clint was hot and willing and more adventurous than most of the guys Darien had found over the years: all in all a damn nice change of pace. His hands slid back to grab Clint's ass and force the man in deeper. He also happened to have one of the sexiest asses Darien had been privileged to see.
Tony opened his mouth to argue, then shut it again. //Oh, right. Amnesia.// "Anyway, you don't seem like the sort of guy to just sit around doing nothing."
Scott, who had suited up for the occasion though he'd warned Fury it might be the last time for a long while, shook his head. He didn't want to talk. He wanted to find Loki and kill the god, preferably painfully. It was a grudge match, and he also wasn't about to let Logan go and get himself killed - even temporarily - without being by his side. He felt for Steve, who would be grounded for the mission and stuck listening in. "I always thought Grand Central looks better with a skylight anyway. Let's do this."
Fitz smiled at the suggestion as he poured himself a healthy glass of pure caffeine and sugar. "Don't see why not. And we are gorgeous subjects if I do say so myself."
"Did you draw the short straw?" It was meant lightly. Bucky imagined there weren't that many SHIELD agents lining up to babysit him, and he honestly could not blame them. After all, he was an unstable time bomb waiting to go off. "I still don't remember anything," Bucky confided, “so there's not a whole hell of a lot of questions I can answer." A sudden wave of boyish shyness came over him, and he apologized, "I'm sorry. Guess I'm not the best company in the world."
Logan groaned, meeting Steve with an eagerness that matched the blonde's. Logan could feel some of the strength that Steve had at his disposal through that contact, and it was as impressive as it was arousing. The feral mutant realized then how much restraint Steve must have had to exercise to kiss Tony without hurting him and was grateful for his healing factor. //He could probably break Stark in half without even meaning to,// Logan thought as his hands tangled anxiously in Steve's shirt, and he made an effort to give as good as he got.
"Stark, do you know where - " Fury noticed Steve in the frame and stopped dead. "Found you both, then. I think you two should get back to the tower."
Steve let the words sink in, let them push past the momentary terror at the idea that maybe he wasn't really what Tony needed, that they could never be alike enough for it to work. He chose consciously to believe Tony's words and the warmth of his arms instead. "I love you too. I love you so much, Tony." He breathed in the scent of the man and then shifted so that he could kiss Tony's lips, slow and soft, tasting and enjoying the light contact. After a moment, he snorted and pressed his face against Tony's neck. "Movie night is going to suck."
"There's nothing to talk about," Tony sighed with a dismissive wave of his hand. Unfortunately the gesture caused the computer schematic he had been trying to concentrate on to fly across the room. "I know it's strange that an exceptionally charismatic guy like me is at a loss for words. Hard to believe, right?" Tony honestly didn't mean to be so short and discourteous to Steve. The other man meant well, but this was something Tony could not talk about or deal with, possibly ever. In fact, the only time he managed to blot out the memory of what had happened was in the bottom of a bottle.
"Let's get out of the shower. I'm clean. At least as much as I'm going to get showering with you. I can't stop touching enough to bother with my hair." Scott brushed his lips to Logan's shoulder as he shut off the water. "So this whole me with no glasses thing is going to make it a lot harder to sleep through meetings." He tossed Logan a towel and started to dry off his hair. "That'll take some getting used to."
"The only memories I have about drinking... they aren't good ones," Steve answered with a wistful smile. "I usually stick to pop." He knew it was nothing that endeared him to anyone. Once upon a time, abstaining from vices had been a virtue. Now it was looked at as being uptight or dated. Of course, in many ways Steve was both, and he was coming to accept the perception as a daily part of life. The last time he'd even tried drinking was after Bucky died, and that was the last thing he wanted to think about. "Believe me, Tony can put back enough that you won't notice I'm skipping it. He has vices enough to cover most of the team, actually." Bruce was usually the only other member of the Avengers who tended to hold back with him. Steve appreciated it even if the real reason was just Bruce keeping himself in check. "You get used to it."
It was several moments before Tony got hold of himself, and he groped around blindly until he managed to get his hand on the box of tissues and clean himself up a bit. "Love you," he murmured shakily, his hands sliding over Steve's arms as he settled back into the bed. He burrowed in close to Steve, feeling as if he couldn't get any closer. Falling silent, he felt exhaustion tugging at him. He wanted to stay awake, but it was a losing battle, and he fell asleep after murmuring the words a second time.
Clint relaxed a little, too, and nodded, worry creasing his brow. "She's... awake. Coherent. But... She's afraid she's been compromised. She seems alright to me, but... she's in a lot of pain, and the docs say there's nothing physically wrong with her." He was terrified when he thought that they might not be able to undo whatever Loki had done. Nat had obviously been in a lot of pain.
Tony cupped Steve's face and pulled him upwards for a long, slow kiss that might've been a bit more intense than appropriate considering they were about to walk out the door. "You can do this. *We* can do this. And if anyone feels the need to act like an ass, I'll adjust them." Realistically, without his suit, Tony was probably going to be the least capable person in the room aside from Steve, but he was also pretty sure that a few sharp words would be all it would take to quell any notions anyone might have of being less than respectful to their leader.
"They did in grad school, Tony. They were just admiring your work," Bruce responded before the two had to defend themselves again. Not that they seemed incapable of such, but without a decidedly thick skin, Tony was tiring. And they needed Fitz-Simmons not tired.
Thor gave the archer an approving thump on the back. "That is the spirit, Hawk!" he decided, though he couldn't help the unease he felt at the strange bloodlust in Clint's eyes when the man looked up at him.
"You seem to be confusing me for someone you know. That's not a good idea. This isn't going to be comfortable for you." He took a few steps closer and nodded in the direction of the camera. "If you want to play to your audience, that's where you should look. I've given you a dose of sodium pentathol - truth serum, if you prefer." The man wore jeans and a white t-shirt, casual, unassuming, and utterly strange in the clinical surroundings.
//Yeeeeeep. I'm definitely going nuts. Hallucinating, even. This is all a dream. Well, somewhere it turned into one.// "I, uh... okay," Tony allowed, not sure of what else to say or why he kept getting distracted by his captor's nude state. //Maybe if I could think with my higher brain functions.// "Just, y'know, don't kill any of my friends when they show up. That'd be a start. And fix whatever that hammer's done to Barton."
The touches seemed to leave trails of tingling heat in their wake, and Logan rumbled, nuzzling Scott's neck. He grabbed a handful of Scott's firm ass and pulled him closer. "Not tired yet, hm?" he asked, clearly amused. It was hot, how much Scott wanted him. Being able to inspire that kind of lust in someone was a powerful feeling, and Logan's animal half could definitely understand and appreciate the primal nature of such pull.
The man barely got the words out. A barely traceable flicker of motion, and there was a knife in Clint's hand. He made a few quick slashes across the other man's face, following him as he stood and tried to back away. Clint tangled his free hand in the man's hair and held the knife to his throat. "Next time, I take your life," he growled. It was a lie, mostly, but no less effective for it. A deft flick of the wrist, and he sheared off a good sized chunk of the thug's ear before shoving him away. The whole attack had taken seconds, and Clint barely looked stressed for it. He glanced casually around the bar as if making sure no one else had anything to add, but most had the sense to avoid eye contact, and no one looked remotely interested in even helping the defeated thug up off the floor.
Darien knew that. He just stared up at Clint's flushed face and hollowed his cheeks. It was good being used, though not for the reasons most people would've assumed. Okay, yes, maybe he was a bit of a masochist, but he didn't want to be hurt. Darien just enjoyed pushing the limits and finding out how far his mind and body could go. It was part of the reason he'd been so ready to engage in criminal activity before SHIELD found him. Dragging Clint in again, a hard jerk to the man's hips to show him just what to do, Darien wondered exactly what kind of mess he'd gotten himself into this time.
"This is where it gets fun." Bobby quickly iced the door they'd come in through shut. "Should buy us a second or two. Let's see if we can find the hammer before they find us."
Relieved to hear that Xavier was open to hearing what they had to say, Phil recounted briefly what had happened and how Natasha had been taken captive. "Loki knows more than we do. He has whatever Logan had, and that means we're already a few pages behind in this story. We can't afford to be. We're all on even ground when it comes to Loki and what to expect from him, but the X-Men know Magneto. You could help us come out of this with a lot fewer casualties if it gets ugly."
“We all are. He’s stronger than he looks. Just make sure you take care of yourself too.” After a pause filled with Natasha studying him like a bug under a microscope, the woman added, “Bruce says you have another visit you can make if you’re up to it.”
Soon enough the Avengers would be no more of a threat than any other humans, fancy toys or no. Toys could only take a man so far. Heart, it seemed, was their true strength. Loki intended to tear their hearts to shreds and leave their minds bleeding. Then he would step in and see that the planet full of mewling monkeys finally had a leader worth following.
“No,” Bucky protested, reaching for Steve’s arm. “No, please don’t go.” He shook his head despite the dull ache that had settled inside of it. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said anything. I didn’t mean to turn on you like that.” Ashamed of himself and feeling more lost than ever before, Bucky sighed heavily and melted deeper into the sofa. “Everybody wants me to remember what happened, but these little bits that come back to me make me not like myself very much.” He glanced up, his eyes filled with sadness. “I mean, look at how I blew up at you,” Bucky pointed out. “I never would have acted like that before.”
The tension in the room had ratcheted up so quickly it made Steve's head spin. He held up a hand. "Guys? We came here to have a drink and relax, not to pick apart each other's habits. You need to play nice." Even though the music pumping through the speakers wasn't his usual, Steve rose and offered, "Want to dance?" Maybe if he could at least separate the two men for a few minutes, things could go back to a base level of animosity.
Phil gritted his teeth together. It was frustrating to not have a better option than playing along, but he wasn't about to let Clint get hurt. He finally met the man's gaze, silently apologizing for not having a solid plan B. "I think I'd prefer alive too, so let's work with that," he agreed tersely.  "Agent Barton, behave yourself. I think at the moment discretion is the better part of valor." At least until they had a decent enough opening to allow them to eviscerate the mutant and remind him that messing with SHIELD wasn't actually a good idea. "You might want to remind your boss that he wasn't capable of killing me last time. I don't see why he thinks he'll be anymore talented this time."
Steve managed a genuine smile at that, "There aren't a lot of people who would consider someone who fought in World War Two young, so I'll take that as a compliment."
Before Phil could answer, the door swung open of its own accord, and a striking redhead stood before them. The woman smiled warmly. "Forgive me for being a bit overly polite, but I saw you on the security feed when I was walking by. Agents Coulson and Barton?"
Natasha slid a third finger home, stretching Scott wider and still licking at his hips, his thighs, whatever she could reach. It was delicious to see Scott's hips rising and falling with the stimulation. His bruises were fading, and his body seemed ready for more.
Tony clinked glasses, "Cheers," before taking a slow drink. It was a fruity Shiraz, one of his best. He wanted to see Steve buzzed, relaxed. He wanted them to take the night and enjoy it to the fullest. Not to mention, the light pink wine looked just incredible against Steve's lips. "You know, I think I'd like this night to last forever."
"Hey, you signed the waiver when you decided not to sleep on the couch," Logan muttered, rolling over and closing his eyes.
"Nat did a pretty good job." Phil still went pink just thinking about it. "You'll figure it out. I'm not usually watching myself, so I don't know what makes me turn the most red." It was actually kind of nice, though, the idea of Clint learning about him. More than that, the idea of Clint wanting to learn about him. Knowing Clint wanted to sleep with him was mind blowing. Knowing that Clint wanted to actually get to know him was something else entirely. "I'm in a pretty good mood right now with a hot guy to cuddle and a nice day and decent music. If you wanted to play twenty questions, this would be the time."
Phil groaned at the joke but had to allow, "I've noticed, actually." He'd more than noticed, but in light of the evening, he supposed Clint knew that already. It had been difficult watching Clint and keeping things professional. It was actually a little hard having Clint straddling his lap and keeping things from getting out of hand. "You should watch out for that. Next time the scar could be bigger. Look what happened to me when I decided to get cute." He smiled ruefully and continued his explorations until his fingers landed on a smaller scar at the top of Clint's shoulder. He'd seen it before a million times. "I remember that one. South America. The extraction team was late... natives got restless. I hated being on the wire for that. Then I saw it, and you were barely even bleeding, and you were grinning because you took out three of them by yourself. Then I wanted to kill you myself."
He drove toward a cordoned off street just shy of the suburbs and found them a spot in a huge dirt lot. As they approached, the signs proclaimed the 'Sins and Needles Festival' in garish letters. "Maybe it's because getting tattoos is something we aren't really encouraged to do, but I find them fascinating. Plus this is more about artists selling work and music..." He trailed off, hoping that the excursion was one to Clint's liking as well. "I thought it might be interesting."
"Good plan." Tony didn't know how much time they had, but he was going to make a bee-line for his suite and spend every last minute tangled up with Steve in every sense he could think of.
"You're about to tell me you're getting up," Steve muttered against Tony's chest, "and I'm not entirely sure I approve." He wondered how many times they'd have to save the world before they earned a real breather. Steve shifted and blinked sleepily before he pushed himself into a sitting position. He was stiff from lying in the same position all night, but it had been well worth it. "Guess it wouldn't be very patriotic of me to tell you to stay in bed with me until lunchtime, huh?"
"I don't know," Phil answered earnestly. He was glad to see Clint perking up at the possibility of progress. He didn't like seeing the man down. Clint was too vital and too brash. Dimming that was a crime against the man's nature.
Steve very nearly ran smack into Logan as he rounded the corner on his way out. "Hey! Sorry. I volunteered for a food run." Seeing the look on Logan's face, he sobered at once, smile fading. "What's wrong?"
It didn't take long to get to their drop zone, and Tony flew himself over. As they gathered up, Tony noted that Bruce was still Bruce. "You gonna suit up?"
Scott begged off, sharing a quick smile with Natasha. "I'm guessing you want to see the real thing?"
"Translation is that apparently Tony thinks he and the suit just weren't close enough," Bruce answered, still giving Tony his most judgmental stare.
"Oh, I think you'll be fine," Tony replied with one of those smirks that said he was definitely up to something. "Shall we?" Again without waiting for a response, Tony moved for the door, and the bouncer standing guard moved the velvet rope aside and waved the three of them in.
Clint straightened, looking less upset and more like he was honestly surprised by the offer. "A cup of coffee sounds good," he finally agreed as a cab pulled up to the curb. He piled in, leaving the door open for Coulson to follow. While it obviously wasn't unusual for him to spend a night on Phil's couch or even have a cup of coffee together, he hadn't expected the agent to immediately want more time with him. He'd halfway expected Coulson to avoid eye contact or discussing what they'd just done in any context for a week, after which he figured they'd get back to eye contact and that'd be it. Immediate and further interaction of any kind hadn't really crossed his mind. //Really must be drunk. This seems crazy.// He knew he was only buzzed at most. //Maybe... No. Don't be dumb.//
The thought was a sobering one, and Steve couldn't help looking away. He suddenly felt a lot less hungry and a lot more terrified. It took only moments for him to get ahold of himself for the sake of everyone else in the room, but the knot of anxiety lingered inside. He didn't want Logan to die either, not even temporarily, but it was better than what could happen to Tony. "I'm glad you guys are working out the kinks." Steve was frankly starting to wonder if their best bet wasn't handing Clint the hammer and letting him beat Loki into a bloody pulp. He kept the idea to himself. It was dangerous too, and for all they knew Clint would end up just as dead.
Loki shifted slightly on Stark's lap. The kisses they shared were languid and almost gentle at first. For the briefest of moments Loki allowed himself to enjoy a fantasy of his own, the idea that the man was there by choice and honestly wanted him. It was at least half true. While his lips pressed to Tony's, Loki's fingers pushed the mortal's shirt up his torso. He broke the kiss just long enough to get Stark free and then dive in once again.
"Mostly. Usually. About eighty percent of the time," Tony replied, tugging his sleeves back into place. "Bio-adaptive nanomachines. You'll like it."
"I think we can manage one better than that. There's a pull out in our room." Tony had been kind enough to find them a suite in an Americanized hotel so that Steve wouldn't have one more set of things to feel completely lost about. "Which Tony can sleep on," Steve added after a beat. He was so drunk already that he wasn't likely to know the difference, and it sounded like it had been awhile since Logan had slept in a proper bed. Steve slid from his stool and offered an arm to Tony. "I know better than to think you're walking out of here unassisted without giving yourself a concussion."
"Oh, I'm stag tonight," Tony commented with a nonchalant wave of his champagne flute. "But I don't intend to go home alone," he added, leaning in conspiratorially. Wearing a cocky half-smile, Tony pressed the extra glass into Steve's hand. "These shindigs aren't really my thing, but I had to put in an appearance. Boring, really. But you, my friend,” he paused, stabbing a finger at Steve's chest, "have just made this night a lot more interesting." Tony slugged down his champagne, casting his eyes over the room as if searching for something interesting. His attention returned to Steve, and he suggested airily, "Want to blow this pizza stand and come back to my place? I can promise you a better time."
"It's only gonna get better," Steve promised. He used Tony's distraction as the perfect moment to slide a third finger inside his body. The more Tony groaned and writhed, the more impatient he grew, but waiting would be worth it when he finally slid home. Just the thought of that tight, hot ass around his cock and Tony's muscular legs wrapped around him drew a groan from Steve. He was kissing the man's neck aimlessly just to keep some sort of focus on the moment. Shifting so that his lips were against Tony's ear, he murmured, "I can't wait to be inside you."
"Probably luckier for you that you missed," Bruce muttered, feeling a drop of sweat trickle down the back of his neck. He wasn't exactly interested in letting the Hulk off the leash. At all. But he was fairly sure another bullet in his general direction would do the trick.
"The good news is that I'm pretty terrible unless we're talking lame wedding dancing." Scott shrugged and stood. "Let's do this." He'd polished off his second beer, and the buzz had Scott feeling far better spirited.
Frigga drew herself up, offering Bruce a faint smile before lifting a hand. Her spells would not hold the man for long. She had yet to figure out whether his imperviousness had to do with his mutation or something else, something innate inside him that made him less susceptible to such things. With all the will she could muster, Frigga cast a spell to bind the man to the floor. "If you have means to restrain him, now would be the time."
"By which he means more or less impossible. You can't profile what's not there," Tony added, moving to stand and grab something only to be shoved back into his chair by Steve. He gave the other man an exasperated look before wheeling himself over two feet and grabbing another tablet off the table. "It's like the energetic equivalent of a black hole."
The words were enough to do away with most of Phil's motivation to move again. Ever. He swallowed thickly and turned Clint's head toward his again. A kiss was the only real answer he could think of to those words. Food could definitely wait. He had something far more interesting. Maybe getting arrested for indecent exposure wouldn't be that bad. Maybe he possessed enough self control to not end up dragging Clint into his lap. Maybe.
Loki reached for some oil from the nightstand and added it to the mix, smoothing it first over Stark's back and then down. Slick fingers gripped his ass and worked the muscle there before dipping between. The man was pliable and relaxed beneath him. Really Stark was rather lovely. He'd be worth fucking if nothing else. "Up on your knees. Let me open you up." Loki did his best to speak as little as possible. The whole point was for Stark to lose himself in fantasy, and Loki had no idea what Steve Rogers might say at such a moment, what platitudes he would spout to his lover. Frankly he didn't care. Loki rested himself against Tony's back so that the man could feel his hardness. "See what you do to me?"
Tony's passion was nothing short of intoxicating. Loki soon gave up on any thoughts of holding himself back and claimed Tony with all the heat and desire that the man inspired. He was a thing of beauty, broken and mortal as he was. "Cum for me," he ordered firmly, wondering if he'd managed a tone as commanding as the one Rogers probably used in the field when he needed to bring the man to heel. "Show me how much you need this." For a moment Loki considered dropping the facade in time for the main event but decided against it. He rather enjoyed having Tony giving himself up to the experience. There was no sense ruining the moment.
Logan picked a ribeye for himself, along with a nice craft beer. The waitress seemed quietly taken with them both, which Logan couldn't help but find amusing, at least until he remembered Jean's words. //"Girls always flirt with the bad guy, Logan; they don't take him home."// Recentering his attention on the moment at hand, he tilted his head at Steve. "So, I get the feelin' that in spite o' all the girls that throw themselves at you, you're still single. Nothin' caught your eye yet?"
Scott leaned into Logan's side. He liked the heat that always radiated off of the other man. His lips parted against Logan's in a silent plea for more. Things were crazy at the tower, and he knew they'd have a hell of a lot more problems to face come morning, but that didn't mean they didn't deserve the break. He kind of loved that the break involved Logan kissing him like it was the most important thing he'd do all night.
Scott nodded. "Thank you." With the prospect of a real night's sleep in relative safety before him, Scott felt utterly exhausted. He shuffled into the bathroom and stripped away what little he wore before standing under the warm flow of the water. It hurt against the torn flesh of his back, but the pain was tolerable. For once it wasn't a new hurt, it was an old one being cleansed, and Scott savored even the sting. He haltingly cleaned himself from head to toe and then pulled the clothes on. The boxers more or less fit thanks to some forgiving elastic, and though Scott was swimming in the t-shirt, it felt nice. He'd never thought he would find the smell of Logan comforting, but he did just the same. By the time Scott headed back into the bedroom he felt almost human. "I'll tell you about it in the morning. If you want to know," he allowed quietly.
Phil paled and managed in a calm if slightly strained tone, "Then we may have a problem." The idea that after everything, the stupid hammer, picking it up once, could be the thing that unraveled Clint... he couldn't really even think it. He couldn't bring himself to look at Clint and try to see what the archer was thinking.
Clint tended to rise early as well, but he made it a point not to shine. He'd had his morning workout and shower but still looked ready to kill anyone who tried to be overly cheerful with him. Wearing a pair of beat-up jeans, a white t-shirt, and a baggy gray zip-up hoodie left hanging sloppily open, he slouched into the kitchen and made a beeline for the coffee. He put a pile of sugar in it, skipped the cream, and settled at the bar. A few sips into his coffee, he seemed to animate a bit more and glanced at Steve. "Morning. Thanks for the coffee," he said, trying to not stare too long at the other man. He had no delusions that Steve would be interested in a roll, and frankly got his fair share of sex from Nat, but anyone with a pulse could appreciate the view. Honestly, Clint had a difficult time imagining anyone not being at least peripherally interested. As he started to drag his attention back to his coffee, Clint hesitated.
Tony knew he should say no, knew that the only thing he should be doing in his bed was sleeping, and only as much as he absolutely had to. He also knew that he wasn't about to say no. "Yeah, definitely," Tony agreed. He grasped Steve's chin in his hand, looking into bright blue eyes and smiling. "Matter of fact, if I don't come home tonight, promise you'll come save me. I don't think long-term Fitz-Simmons exposure's good for anyone." He knew Steve probably wanted to spend as little time out where people could see him as possible; Tony also wasn't willing to let his lover hide himself in Tony's room all day long. Especially when Tony wasn't in it. He leaned in for another slow kiss, resisting the urge to use his hold on Steve's hip to pull the man into his lap. He was pretty sure he wouldn't have the self discipline at that point to behave.
Coulson managed to keep from screaming. Even after his office door shut and he crossed over to sit behind his desk, he didn't scream. "I'll start with the good news: Logan and Summers are both contained. No one was severely injured or killed." He gave Clint a moment to think, just long enough for him to get truly uncomfortable, and then continued, "When it took you longer than fifteen minutes to bring someone from an upper floor to a lower floor, I checked in. I was worried that we might be shampooing pieces of you out of the rug. Instead, as it turns out, you were drinking with and then sleeping with the person you were sent to apprehend. I could try to come up with some elaborate reasons for why that might make sense, but I'd really love to hear you attempt to explain it."
"He seems, uh, colorful," Scott allowed. "Kinda hard seeing him being the kind of guy who'd end up hooked up with Captain America."
"I could go for that." Scott caught a flash of uncertainty on Logan’s face and assured, "I'll keep my hands to myself." As much as he wanted to pretend that he was on a completely even keel, Scott knew better. He knew that he'd sleep a hell of a lot more comfortably if he wasn't alone staring at the dark. No amount of alcohol could completely chase away the ghosts he was running from.
The memory sent a chill down Phil's spine. He still remembered Maria's voice as close to panicked as he'd ever heard it telling them that Barton had been compromised. "Maybe you can deal with it, but the rest of us don't want to. I'm not taking that call again." Trying to lighten the mood again, Coulson observed, "At least they're willing to help. It's more than we had before. It's not much, but it's more." With the files Xavier was sending, they'd have a better outline of what their enemies could do and thus how they could counter some of it. "Right now I'll settle for all of us getting out of this alive and sane... and having it go smoothly enough that Fury doesn't have us drawn and quartered for doing this."
"Jarvis is programmed to be more human so people are more comfortable interacting with him," Tony explained. "And, y'know, I need someone who I can irritate without driving them away forever."
It hurt, it did, but not enough for Steve to want Logan to stop or even slow down. He caught his breath in uneasy pants instead and clutched at Logan's shoulders. "Little lube might be nice," he observed, knowing that enhanced healing or not he'd regret it soon enough if there wasn't something to ease the way. Logan was even less talkative than seemed to be his norm, but Steve didn't mind. What they were doing required more action than words. It had taken all of a few seconds for Logan to established who was topping. Steve had no protest with that either. It had been a long time since he had a strong man willing to take charge with him. It was one thing being all but a walking sign that screamed "SUB!" when he was younger, but Captain America was apparently always supposed to top, and Steve preferred a bit more variety on his sexual menu.
Steve had to remind himself to catch his breath. It was important to keep breathing. He drew the air in and then out again as he savored the sensation of Tony's lips on his skin. "Love you so much." He wanted absolutely nothing more than to stay in Tony's arms for the foreseeable future, but at least they had a night. They had some time for one another. Enough time that Tony apparently felt it was fine to tease. Steve couldn't help smiling despite that fact. "You're a tease, Stark. A horrible tease."
Steve let Tony ride the release through before he let go himself. Frankly he'd barely managed to wait that long. It felt like heaven to finally cum with Tony still clenching around him. He gasped his lover's name but otherwise managed to follow Tony's example of keeping quiet. Steve sat up and dragged Tony with him to avoid collapsing on top of the man and crushing him. "I'm not letting go of you tonight." Even through the climax the idea of sleeping with Tony close had held fast. "In fact, if things that feel as good as tonight keep happening, I might not let go at all."
Phil leaned into the touch and the kiss. The embrace started out very nearly chaste. They were testing the waters. Slowly they found the perfect position, the perfect place to rest their hands. He didn't really care who was watching. After a brief bout of trying to hide himself away in high school, Phil had given up on it. He'd hated every second of trying to be something he wasn't even if what he was didn't happen to fit the mold his parents had wanted for him. He slid his tongue gently against the seam of Clint's lips, asking for entrance, for permission to test the boundaries a little more.
Logan made a sound somewhere between a grunt and a sigh as he watched Scott's mouth slide over his cock. His lover had the most amazing lips, and watching them slide along his shaft was enough to challenge even Logan's control. His hand slid into Scott's hair, hanging on and careful not to interfere with Scott's movement. Logan's other hand covered one of Scott's, and the mutant let his head fall back on the couch for a moment as he panted his pleasure. "You look amazin' down there," he murmured softly.
Coulson agreed with the assessment. Something was off about Logan, and if the look on Scott's face was any indication, he knew it whether he wanted to or not. The thought made him frown, but he found himself smiling again when he looked over at the couch. Clint had never hesitated to use his office as a waystation. It happened organically over time. At some point, Coulson's office had simply become Clint's second bedroom. Apparently the theory applied to his suite as well. Not that he minded. Coulson actually felt a jolt at how little he minded and snapped his gaze back to the screens. The intimacy of the moment being shared onscreen wasn't lost on him, and he sighed softly. It was never good to feel something going off the rails when the collateral damage was spread out right in front of him before it even happened.
