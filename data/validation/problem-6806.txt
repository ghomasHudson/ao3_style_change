The words are so full of suspicion and poorly hidden animosity, Steve considers bailing.  Clearly a win and some shawarma hadn’t smoothed over all their differences.  But Steve’s faced worse than a cranky Stark and he’d rehearsed his words all the way from DC to New York so he knows exactly what he wants to say.
“And we’ll take him off the list,” Bucky adds.  He reaches for a pen so he can draw a line through Bruce’s point value.  “Now that we know his name it seems like kind of a dick move.”
“If I’ve got astronomy questions while the documentary is on, you’ve got to answer them without trailing off or acting like it’s no big deal you know the answer off the top of your head.  No playin’ dumb.  Not with me.”  Steve softens his words by tugging Tony a couple of inches closer. “Deal?”
sorry to wake you,” JARVIS says, his voice quietly filling Steve’s bedroom room. “Agent Romanoff is requesting entry to your quarters. She is most insistent.”
Miraculously, Tony doesn’t argue.  He climbs into the passenger seat and buckles himself in.  He’s still weak, and he’s definitely got the shakes.  Steve knows this can’t be easy.  That Tony must be absolutely miserable.
Clint begins pulling the parts out for the scanner next and James watches him like Clint is unwrapping a bomb.  Maybe something worse than a bomb, since Bruce has gotten the distinct impression that James wouldn’t be all that disconcerted by an actual weapon.
Two are Steve’s work. The first is the view from the top of the tower since the previous week Tony had mentioned missing New York. The next was a drawing, done in pencil, of Tony’s workshop. Steve had drawn it one of the days he’d gone to visit the bots, and he liked how it turned out. Even without Tony there, his presence lingers. Steve had included details he hadn’t seen, like a mug of coffee, and papers scattered on the desk and the ground. Like Tony had just stepped out of the frame for a moment but he planned to be right back.
because one, that’s not true, and two because it’s maybe a little true.  Sam’s only been around for seven weeks and Steve’s nearly gotten him killed a dozen times so he wouldn’t blame Sam if he walked. Nat can be hard to read.  The Strike team was
“I reallllly don’t think you’re going to like it.  And my ma always said it’s harder to say no to someone who put in some effort. ‘Course she was telling me that for my art school interviews but it stuck.”
“Ugh, nooooooo,” Tony groans.  “Whatever I said that made that face happen, I take it back.  I surrender.  I will buy you a pony.  Just stop looking so woebegone.  I’m begging you.”
It’s small talk.  He ought to be better at it, but he isn’t, so he takes a huge drink to keep from blurting out any follow up questions.  He’d pay a lot of money to be half as smooth one on one as he is when he’s charming crowds.  Intimate conversation is not his strong suit.
“No idea,” Bruce says, keeping the scanner brick where it is so he can continue to observe. So he can track the injuries, and solve the impossible puzzle, and
“You give me way too much credit,” Tony says.  “I thought it would be mountains of paperwork, and even then, Pepper’d say no.  I’m one sexual harassment case away from losing the company.  I didn’t want to fuck everything up.”
Tony puts a hand on Steve’s elbow and squeezes.   Steve lets out a breath he didn’t realize he was holding.
“It was a guess,” Bruce offers. “Not even an educated one. Maybe wishful thinking on Steve’s behalf. He’s got friends out looking for you.”
“And I’m not watching you stare at a computer screen for another 24 hours in a row like a goddamn zombie.  It’s not bringing him back.”
There’s a look on Clint’s face that gives away just how much it means to him that Bruce values his opinion. If Bruce was a hugger he’d have reached for Clint, but he isn’t so he just walks past him to the fridge and pulls out two bottles of beer instead. He slides one down the counter to Clint, and then opens the other for himself.
“So this is what we’re doing then,” Bruce says.  “If that all sounds okay-- Steve?  You’ve known him the longest. I don’t mean to dismiss that.”
“If I’d known you were going to be this impressed by my old essays, I’d have dug some up sooner.  If I tell you I won a prize for my translation of parts of The Divine Comedy, would that turn an after-dinner walk into ice cream?”
Bruce reaches for the swinging arm of the new scanner and brings it to rest about a foot over James’s face.
“Then what’s the truth?” Tony asks.  He’s not upset.  “Because believe it or not, I’ve got some experience with classified information.  And I’m not going to hold it against you that you told an automatic lie because you couldn’t tell some man you’d just met the whole and absolute truth about your life.  That makes a lot of sense, actually.”
The glare James gives him would be intimidating if Bruce didn’t swear he saw a hint of grudging fondness in it somewhere.
“No one’s touching my hair,” Bruce chimes in.  “Or my porn for that matter. I like my porn on paper and my hair on my head, thanks. James, the same can go for you.  Feel free to tell Clint to fuck off if you’d rather cut your hair yourself. Even if he’s already got the scissors in his hand. You aren’t obligated to let him do anything you don’t want, even if you've already given him permission.”
“You think that was Bucky Barnes?” James asks. He doesn’t sound as offended by the name, now. It's more like he’s talking about an old acquaintance than an old enemy.
Steve turns a playful glare on him. “And this is Tony Stark. Which I’m sure you already know. Do you want to say hello, Tony?”
“Everything and more.”  Tony laughs against him, and presses a kiss to Steve’s shoulder.  “Dr. Gerber’s going to shit himself.”
Tony shrugs.  “They wouldn’t have if you could touch them.  The real stuff’s in storage upstate.  There’s a lot.  You might want to go through it first to see what you want to take with you.  Anything else can stay secure in Stark storage until you’re living in something bigger than an apartment.  I’ll have JARVIS send you the address and you can pick up security credentials on the way out so you can go back as often as you want.  It’s all yours.  Go wild.”
“Who said anything about the Hulk?” Clint asks. “Cooking with Bruce. You already do a running commentary the whole time you’re in the kitchen. Live out your Rachael Ray dreams. You know you want to.”
His rude comment is cut off by a rough shove to the shoulder, and surprise of surprises, it doesn’t come from Steve.  Clint pushes Brock hard enough that Brock hits the nearest wall with a loud thud.  Hard enough that dust from the ceiling shakes down into their hair.
The thing is, once you know Tony’s tells, it’s easy to see when you say something that upsets him.  Everything about Tony’s face goes to a look Steve used to think of as ‘rich kid wise ass.’  Except since that talk with Pepper about Shayla’s interview, Steve’s known better.  What he used to interpret as bravado or contempt, he now knows is more often than not, Tony’s way of hiding hurt feelings.
“No,” Steve says, then looks at the smoothie in his hands and he can’t help making a face.  “I’m not sure this is edible.”
“He’s looking for Bucky Barnes,” James growls. “And that ain’t me.  Him wantin’ his friend back isn’t gonna change a thing.”
Again, no beta since this is a giftfic for the world's best proofreader, Imafriendlydalek!  Sorry you're stuck seeing all my mistakes!
“Thank you,” Tony says, with real gratitude.  He can't hide that he’s a little shaken up by the conversation.  He’s just not sure if he’s more shaken up by Obie trying to sabotage his safety, or by having two strangers protect him for years, without his knowledge.
“I live with Sam, remember?” Steve reminds him, looking pained and amused at the same time.  “I usually give him and Nat an hour or two to wear themselves out before I go home.”
“Circus wisdom,” Clint explains. “We had a bear that rode a little tricycle. Mean as shit. I hated that thing.”
James drops his head back to the pillow, and glues his eyes to the ceiling. “You don’t know what I deserve.”
Steve leans in and presses his lips to Tony’s.  He lingers there, moving his other hand to the small of Tony’s back and Tony is more than happy to go along with this plan.  He deepens the kiss and tugs at Steve’s shirt until they’re pressed flush against each other and Tony can close his eyes and lose himself in the oh god yes of their first kiss.
“Maybe talk before you write me off as gone?” Tony says.  “I mean, I did stick around for Murder-Ride 2016.  I feel like I should get credit for not shooting you.”
“You know, when I’m the voice of reason in the whole ‘take care of yourself’ argument, you have hit some bad kind of rock bottom. Just eat the damn BannerBar. I promised your partners in crime I’d keep you fed and watered till they’re back in the states.”
The question is like a punch to the gut.  The night Steve and Jarvis had bonded over destroying the sex tape had given Steve a glimpse of how much Jarvis cares about Tony.  But in this moment, he has no doubt that Jarvis is capable of more care than Steve thought possible from a machine.  What he’s hearing sounds like love.  Because what
“Okay.  So he’s getting sex.  What are his partners getting out of it?” Steve asks.  “If Shayla’s telling the truth, the sex isn’t anything to write home about.”
Steve lets Tony go first, keeping his eyes on the alley, until Tony is safely down. Then Steve joins him. They wait beside a dumpster, well out of sight.
“Howard wasn’t a drunk when I knew him,” Steve says, wanting to explain.  “We were in the war and for a long time he was like... like a breath of fresh air.  Like someone so smart and so special, the war couldn’t touch him.  When I see similarities between the two of you, that’s what I see,” Steve says.
“I loved him and that scared him,” she says, her posture deflating a little.  “He didn’t think he deserved me.  He pushed me away emotionally and I stayed.  He pushed me away by shutting himself in his workshop for days at a time and I stayed.  So he did the one thing he knew would put an end to things.  He got blind drunk and he cheated on me.  And then when he confessed it all, he kept telling me it wasn’t personal.  It wasn’t about me.  I’d always been enough.  It wasn't my fault. It was all on him.”
Things have been better between Tony and Steve since that day in the tower.  Tony isn’t as hostile.  Steve isn’t as quick-tempered.  They work well as a team in the field.  Steve accompanies Tony on a Children’s Hospital visit one sunny spring day.  They stop for milkshakes after and Tony laughs until tears stream down his cheeks when Steve orders a large Iron Man to go along with his cheeseburger.
Tony’s voice is cut off as the elevator doors close in Steve's face.  He’s been dismissed.  Which is fine.  It prevents Steve from saying anything else embarrassing or stupid.
Tony watches as Steve turns and picks up their dirty napkins and starts to pour all the leftover beer into the now empty pitchers.  Tony realizes with no small amount of surprise that Steve is bussing the table, so the server won’t have to.  And since Tony’s not an asshole, he joins him, and scrapes leftover fries onto one of the platters and then stacks the empty plates while Steve stacks the cups.
Natasha and Clint are in the same room to recover, which makes it far easier to pile in and fuss over them.  They’re both groggy, but happy to see their friends.  Bruce kisses Natasha on the forehead then takes a seat on Clint’s bed.  Steve mirrors that exactly, greeting Nat and then moving to check on Clint.  He can see from the way she’s looking at Tony that she wants a moment of privacy with him.
Tony nods, pulls out his phone and types in the code he’s programmed.  For a second nothing happens, then the first giant distraction blast shoots soil and rock 100 feet straight up into the air before a ridiculous BOOM sounds around them. The rest of the explosions cascade from there-- like the world’s noisiest Rube Goldberg device.
“No to the Wal-Mart and no to the tractor,” Nat says.  “Yes to a Piggly-Wiggly and an old Chevy pick-up.”
Natasha climbs onto the bed with the grace of a cat and steps over Steve before wedging herself into the corner where the wall meets the mattress.
Steve fights the urge to ask for more in depth information.  Tony’s being as open as he can, and they’ve got all the time in the world; Steve doesn’t need every question answered tonight.
Pepper, Rhodey and Steve stare at Tony who appears entirely unfazed by the news. He’s eating his breakfast and they’re all still staring so Tony lifts his hands in a sort of ‘what were you expecting’ gesture. He still has a piece of waffle speared to his fork.
“Home?” Tony asks. “I kind of love that. No. I don’t kind of love it, I really love it. I’m going to have someone cross stitch it onto a pillow for you.”
“No address,” Sam deadpans.  “Believe it or not, he’s working hard to stay off my Christmas Card list.”
Steve shakes himself from this line of thought as he pulls into the private entrance to Tony’s personal garage.  All the cars are where Tony had left them.  And they are gleaming clean.
“Injuries need to be noted in my field report,” Steve sighs.  He’s tired.  He needs to eat.  He just wants to get the damn paperwork done.  At least he knows what a SpongeBob is; he doesn’t need to waste time looking it up.  “I swear, between you and Barton, I’m never going to finish one of these things on my first try,” he mumbles, mostly to himself.
“You’re trolling me,” Tony insists, turning carefully on his heel toward the elevator.  “I am being trolled by the star-spangled man with a plan.  In my own bedroom.  J, order us some pizza?”
He can’t even fathom the depths of how much he may or may not be fucking this up. Is it good James stayed? Sure, probably. Is it a sign James has gone from one set of assholes telling him what to do, to a more well-intentioned set of assholes? Absolutely. There really isn’t a better description of Team Barton-Banner than that.
“So what’d you decide? Cut or no cut?” Clint asks.  “Like Bruce said, it’s not going to hurt my feelings if you change your mind. Your body-- your hair-- your choice.”
“I think maybe I shouldn’t,” Steve says. Bruce can hear what kind of a sacrifice that is. Can hear the weight of Steve’s unhappy resolve. “I want to give James his best shot at calming down quickly. That doesn’t involve me.”
The same smile Bucky's always using to get his way.  It melts Bucky's resolve like a hot knife through butter.
“I have them, too,” Steve says, sparing Tony from any more than that simple thanks.  “I don’t know if they’re official panic attacks or just something similar.  This last time it was fireworks that set it off.  It made for a rough birthday.”
Clint does look impressed. Bruce actually smiles into his beer at the visible awe on his face. There really aren’t many people who can surprise the Amazing Hawkeye.
There are no words for the level of delight on Tony’s face when Steve confesses his bout of jealousy. They’re in bed, and they were about to go to sleep, except now Tony’s bouncing on the mattress with excitement.
She drops her voice to a lower pitch and says in a vaguely Brooklyn accent, “Feet off the dash.  We’re only
“Hey James, buddy?” Clint asks. “Maybe don’t kill me with those? I’m not gonna hurt you, I’m gonna keep my hands where you can see them and sit down real slow.”
“We’ll talk again soon,” Bruce promises, and then he shuts off the call before things get any worse.
Steve sounds like the least-nefarious person Tony’s ever met and Tony feels like a complete idiot, because yes, he does have a gun. He has the weapon Natasha had handed him in the apartment tucked into the waist of the back of his jeans. He’d forgotten it was there in his panic.
“We can talk as much as you want,” Steve assures him. “I mean, I’m sure it’d be good for me, too. It’s not something that comes naturally. So where do you want to start?”
“I’d forgotten,” Tony says.  “I didn’t cheat, I swear.  I just... it wasn’t important and so I forgot about it.”
“That’s where I’m going to stop you,” Tony says.  “Me and Rhodey have something we call the No Judgement Zone and it’s just what it says on the box.  This whole conversation is judgement free.  So you want to tell me how much this sucks?  Because you can.  Even though we both know Barnes wasn’t acting of his own volition and it isn’t nice to hold that against him, for as long as it takes us to get where we’re going, have at him.  No one’s ever going to know but me.”
“Sap,” Tony accuses, elbowing Steve lightly in the ribs. The soft smile on Tony’s face chases away any semblance of an insult.
And if James caring about what happens to an old sack of clothes isn’t proof that deep down inside him there’s hint of a kid who was born around the Great Depression, Bruce doesn’t know what it is.
“Oh, I approve fine,” he says.  “But someone has to be the judge and I’m the only one who won’t cheat.”
Now it’s Tony’s turn to roll his eyes.  “Yes, you’re taller.  Howard never got around to spiking my Frosted Flakes with Super Soldier Serum.  It was a huge oversight on his part.”
They stop for lunch about two hours in, and once they’re off the ice and out of their skates, Tony checks his phone. He’s got a text from Steve he hadn’t heard come in. When he sees it, he smiles.
“You’ll get it sticky,” Steve snaps, and snatches the BannerBar away from Tony just to make him stop. “How is eating this sponge going to be useful?”
Steve cuts off the TV as the audience joins her in her mean-spirited laughter.  The whole lot of them can go straight to hell.
They play a game with something that actually resembles rules this time. Tony’s the better skater, and the better shooter, but Steve is obviously better at defense. Tony can’t help his running narrative that’s half smart-ass commentary and half game calling. By the end of the match it’s probably close but neither of them are keeping score.
Tony’s expression is unreadable.  “J, get the good Captain on his way.  I’m sure there are at least a dozen cats up in trees between here and Brooklyn that need saving.  Law of averages...”
Tony knows his social security number.  He memorized it when he was three and he’s known it ever since.  But people don’t have a lot of reason to stick around if they don’t think Tony needs them so he’d told Pepper he didn’t know it.
“I don’t think Tony would do that,” Bruce says gently. “I really don’t.  You’re safe here, James.  Or at least as safe as any of us can ever be.”
If Tony likes being tied up, Steve could work with that.  Soft rope.  Easy-to-tug-free knots.  It wouldn’t have to be like a prison camp.
Steve tugs Tony down, so they can both sit on the floor where they are easily reachable.  Dum-E seems adorably determined to trace a heart on top of Tony’s head.
He doesn’t miss the way Tony ducks his head, a little shyly, and Steve’s pleased he can still get this reaction.
“You might be surprised,” Bruce says. “Now, try to lay as still as you can. It’ll be painful if you fling yourself off.”
Steve groans. “Does that make it time for the Dance Cam or the Kiss Cam or the Hockey Hockey Hockey song on your home ice?”
When he finishes at the bar (he doesn’t even want to think about how much of Tony’s money he’s poured down the drain) Jarvis directs him to the kitchen, then to Tony’s workshop, and then to his office.  The alcohol is never very hidden because Tony’s never had a reason to hide it.  None of his recent boyfriends or girlfriends showed concern about the amount that he drank.
Eventually the man sits down, more obviously favoring his leg when he has to shift his weight to do it. He ends up facing Bruce, with his back to the door, and that feels odd in the same way it felt odd to see him moving toward the barn out in the open. Bruce has spent enough time around Clint and Natasha that he thinks sightlines are just a given with assassins. So either the soldier doesn’t care if he gets shot in the back of the head, or he’s good enough that he doesn’t need the reassurance of a view.
Tony collapses next to Steve at the center of the rink and enjoys the chill from the ice below him. He’s sweaty and gross and still wearing a few parts of his fundraiser suit underneath his hockey gear. It’s great.
“I need to go,” Steve says apologetically. “It was great meeting you, though. I can’t tell you how happy I am to know Boop lived a long, happy life. And here. Let me write down my phone number. I’d love for you to meet Tony. Maybe you could come by the tower sometime?”
“I’m pretty sure that’s the most American thing I’ve done all night,” Steve points out.  “Except maybe breaking down the door and threatening to kick someone’s ass.  Come on.  You can cover up with my suit jacket so the press doesn’t get a picture worth printing. I can patch up your cheek with what we’ve got in the tower if you trust my medical skills.”
“You’re not even mad at me,” Tony says incredulously.  His body is practically vibrating with frustration.  “Why are you being so decent about this?  And I swear to God if you tell me you’re doing it for America I’m jumping out of this car.”
Steve can barely string three words together in their debrief because they’ve all changed into civilian clothes by then and he can see Tony’s got faint rope burns around his neck, and some bruises there, too.  The meeting lasts all of five minutes before Steve calls it to a close, stands, and flees the room like the table's on fire.
“I was just thinking... they’re expensive. The really good art pads, I mean. I know that’s not a problem for me.  I can afford whatever at this point, or if I couldn’t I’d just need to mention it once and you’d make sure I had one by dinner.”
They arrive at the burger place, which is a total hole in the wall.  Steve stares at the window-papered door with marked skepticism.
“I asked because... I guess, I wanted you to know I’ve been treated like my body isn’t mine more times than I can count. Sometimes I’m still not even sure it is, if I’m being honest. So when I keep asking you questions, and keep confirming that we’re good here... that’s a lot of my own issues surfacing. I’m sorry about that. I’m kind of a disaster.”
An off-handed ‘good for you’ is not at all what Steve intends to say, but it’s habit now.  People make so many assumptions about his moral standards, it’s the easiest way to help them understand he doesn’t give two shits about what they get up to in their free time.
Tony makes a face, but doesn’t argue Steve’s point.  They’ve both read that particular family therapy pamphlet more than once.
Steve doesn’t find the 20 dollar bill Tony somehow tucked into the pocket of Steve’s hoodie until he’s on his way home.
“Boop was an amazing woman and she was kind to me at a time when I was lost and confused and alone. Very, very patient. She’d have had to have been, because I didn’t know any more about how to get around a woman’s body than I did about how to navigate Albuquerque.”
He’s already pretty sure he knows the answer. Knows that Tony wouldn’t resort to bribery. That he’s changing. Getting better. Risking more.
to keep you out of it.  And once things are a little more settled and it’s time to go on the offensive, me and you can hunt down that chair and turn it into goddamn splinters if that’s the kind of thing that strikes you as a good time.”
“He’s an idiot,” the soldier says. For a moment he sounds as young and frustrated as he looks. “I could have killed him. He was going to let me kill him. I... I couldn’t let that happen.”
It’s almost 4 AM.  Steve stands, doesn’t say anything because he doesn’t want to interrupt, and heads up to the penthouse to grab some coffee and a snack.  He makes it back to the lab in under 10 minutes.
Steve picks up his bagel, gives Tony a nod, and exits quickly.  Jarvis has the elevator door already open for him.
Bruce regrets not having asked Steve more about it when he had the chance. Not that he’s ever been Steve’s physician; SHIELD and then hospital doctors have had that responsibility. Bruce isn’t even a medical doctor despite his knowledge of biology. There is absolutely no reason Bruce should have followed up with Steve, and there’s no reason to feel guilty for lacking answers now. It doesn’t matter. Logic is guilt’s bitch.
“Pretty sure the whole criminal underworld watching Iron Man beg to be let go while he takes it from behind would have been a threat to our credibility, if nothing else.”
“You’ve pissed off enough people that consequences are a given,” Steve says.   He thinks of the close friendship Bruce and Tony had enjoyed before all this, and how hard that’s going to be to earn back.  “I don’t see why I should add to your misery.”
When Steve’s at the buffet, Tony’s getting a refill of what is hopefully water. (Steve might not like the guy, but he’d also been sad to hear about the drinking relapse.) When Tony’s at the buffet, Steve makes sure he’s somewhere else.
“I thought they would tell you,” Steve says helplessly.  “And I’m not... good at talking about this stuff.  I don’t have much practice.”
They fall into silence.  Steve isn’t sure where to go from here.  Howard’s presence still hovers over them like a cloud.  A shadowy unknown.  And it’s confusing because that’s so far removed from the Howard that Steve knew.  His Howard could brighten any room.
“Haven’t looked,” James says, his face and eyes aim straight ahead. “The leg is functional,” he adds a little hesitantly, as if he’s concerned Bruce might assume otherwise from this report.
“I don’t know if I could,” Steve admits.  “Some of my friends... Hydra’d captured them and when I found them they were strapped to beds.  Tied up in cages.  Kind of ruined the whole bondage thing for me.”
They walk out of the hidden room into the basement, then up the stairs and into a flurry of activity.  Clint’s on the phone talking in what sounds a lot like Mandarin Chinese.  Bucky’s got papers strewn across the table, printouts of some sort, that he’s cross-referencing with the words on his laptop screen.  A large (mostly empty) sleeve of Fig Newtons sits between them.
“No.  You really don’t,” Steve insists.  “We can take this car out for the day but I’m bringing it right back.  It’s yours.”
Slightly more hopeful beeps this time.  Bruce reaches out a hand to pet Dum-E’s long, metal arm, and Dum-E beeps again, cheerfully.
Tony and Steve stay frozen in place right up to the point they hear a crash and Clint scream, “My figgies! Nooooo!”
Everything is fine right up until a few mornings later when it occurs to Tony that Steve touches everyone but him.  Not in a way Tony thinks is meant to inspire jealousy (although it does.)  Just in an ‘I’m Steve Rogers and these are my friends and I’m a tactile person’ sort of way.  Tony can’t even blame Steve for how miserable it makes him (watching the security feeds up in his office) because Steve is doing exactly what Tony asked him to do.  Distance between them is what’s good for the company.  And no matter how much Tony hates it, it was the right move.
Steve knows that’s what Tony’s saying. And he also knows this is how ugly things start. How the next words he chooses are crucial. And how everything they’ve learned in therapy is about to be put to the test.
“To embarrass you?” Steve asks.  “Or do you mean to make you do things in private you don’t want and then announce it to a table full of strangers.”
He heads up the stairs and Steve dutifully follows like Tony knew he would.  He leads Steve down the hall to the room they’ll be sharing, and just as Tony expected when Steve steps inside he can’t help but laugh.
“He turns into a total bag of dicks any time you’re in the room,” Clint says.  “I like him fine when we’re alone.  I can’t stand him when he’s within a hundred feet of you.  Or Nat.”
Bruce nods and for the first time in a long time, doesn’t let self-doubt make him think his friend doesn't really mean it.
“Well, that’s good?” Bruce says, realizing then what an obvious mistake he’s made. “I can call him back and tell him I can meet him down the road. I should have asked for your permission before I invited him to the house.”
They decide to make the video in Tony’s workshop. Despite Tony’s numerous complaints about camera quality and angle, Steve insists they use his phone’s video function. He wants this to be real. He’s not the least bit worried about production value.
“I’ll do it,” Tony volunteers.   He might as well make himself useful until Bucky gives him something else to do.
“Think we found something,” Bucky says.  He nods toward the empty chair in front of the spare computer and waits for Tony to take it.
“Ugh, nooooo,” Steve complains, though now he’s laughing too. “I’m never going to get that out of my head. I need brain bleach. Or a time machine.”
He looks at the screen and there’s a texted picture from Bruce, of Clint on the porch of the Swiss Chalet, kneeling next to a bucket of what looks like cow shit, laughing hysterically.  At the edge of the frame Tony sees the legs of who must be Bucky Barnes, standing and watching..
“Don’t suppose Tony’s mentioned anything about James to you?” Clint asks, before James can respond. There’s something off in his tone. He's worried. “Cause this is a little more complicated than you know.”
“I believe Captain Rogers feels much the same about Sergeant Barnes,” Jarvis continues.  “For him, less than two years have passed since they last met.  Yet all those memories, he bears alone.”
Steve pulls out his cell phone and taps out a message. Tony’s phone beeps and when Tony reads the screen, it’s a group text.
They move to the sofa and Jarvis orders them dinner from SoupSoupSoup.  They watch a game show while they wait.  A security guard brings up their food to the penthouse and looks surprised when Steve’s the one standing there waiting at the elevator.  The man gives him a courteous nod and hands over the large, brown, paper bag.  Steve thanks him before the lift doors slide closed.
They try new combinations of their favorite milkshakes every time they meet up. Steve’s new favorite is the Iron Widow. Clint insists on buying an Avenger Special which is every one of them all mixed together. The smell makes Steve gag. Tony and Bruce are purists. They refuse to mix and match, though Bruce will sip whatever Clint’s having occasionally.
They’re half way through their feast when Mae drops off the milkshake menu. True to her word, the Iron Man is back in its spot. Tony reads the list then looks up at her.
“I want it cut. I want--” It’s painful to listen to James drown in the effort of words. “I want it shorter. It’s always in my face. Tactical disadvantage.”
Steve has to avert his eyes when he notices the sort of gray-purple of the flacid ham in Tony’s sandwich.  He pushes his own McMuffin to the center of the table.
“If it makes you feel better, my crush on you was the reason I got added to the stupid points list in the first place.  The guys kept trying to set me up on dates and I kept... pining.”
“I think we should stop for the night,” Steve says.  “Wait until we’re with Dr. Gerber to see if he can help."
Steve looks disappointed.  “Well, that’s a reason.”  He sighs, puts his hands on his knees, and then pushes himself up off the desk.  “I’ll let you get back to your work.  I’m sorry for disturbing you.”
“I appreciate you telling me, whatever you can,” Steve says. “Tony said you’ve been incredible through all this.  I don’t think I’ll ever be able to thank you enough.”
“Despite the fact that some of you will never be able to see him as anything other than his mistakes, Tony Stark is a good man, invaluable as an Avenger and a national hero.  Thank you.  You’re dismissed.”
!” Steve apologizes, dropping to his knees to help tug Tony out from under the platform.  “Are you okay?”
Natasha had been helping Steve prop Tony up, but now she and Bucky are closer to the street hailing cabs.
“No.  Sanitation is a lost cause,” Bruce says. “We’ve been doing our best, but it’d be a joke to worry about a sterile environment now. Do you have somewhere in mind?”
“We all have those moments,” Clint says. “Don’t feel like you’ve got to run off just cause we’ve seen one.”
Bruce reaches for the water bottle and sips at it, trying to wash those memories away. The symbolism of the water doesn’t do much to calm his pulse, but a buzz from his phone helps. He pulls it out of his pocket and sees a selfie of Tony grinning brightly while giving the thumbs up sign.
“Then thanks, definitely,” Steve amends. “I saw you were suspended, too. Didn’t expect anyone else from the league to be here tonight. And then I thought maybe you were avoiding me.”
Steve leaves the door cracked and listens as Tony rustles and thumps around (undressing, Steve assumes) and then the water starts.  It’s the shower, not the low tap, so at least Steve doesn’t have to worry Tony’s going to drown.
Steve trails off.  “You wouldn’t have read about it in the papers, because to the rest of the world it never happened.  It was the first time we met Natasha.  She worked for another agency, but she was brought in as an expert.  We got orders to blow up a building, but when we got there, the building wasn’t empty.  It was apartments.  There was a day care.  I was leading the mission and I did the only thing I could think to do.  I sent Bucky and Clint in to pull the fire alarms.  Once the building was empty, we set off the explosives, but in the time it took to get the civilians out, the guys we were after got away.  The mission was a failure.”
This doesn't feel like rejection, more like disbelief.  Steve pulls over to the side of the road and puts the car in park.  He wants to have this conversation without distraction.
Bruce may be frozen, but James is not.  Somehow, despite his injuries and the blood and the pain, James shifts into a crouch, with the knife held in one hand.  If Bruce didn’t know him, he wouldn’t recognize James as the same person.  James’s eyes no longer belong to their quiet companion from the last few days.  They belong to a predator and they are trained with an ultra-focused malice on Bruce and Clint.
They finally land and Happy’s there to meet him.  He’s clearly not happy to see his boss, but he’s willing to help Steve get Tony in a town car and then to drive them to the tower loading dock so no one will realize Tony’s back in town just yet.  Then it’s up to Steve to carry Tony into a service elevator and get him up to the penthouse.
But he doesn’t think he can have it. Tony doesn’t need to say as much out loud for Steve to hear how it hangs in the air.
“Because Clint is our guest.  And those Fig Newtons are for him,” Nanna adds.  “I bought you Oreos.”
Tony’s got about the best forearms Steve’s ever seen.  They are attached to great looking arms in general.  Steve doesn’t have a lot of words for the way watching Tony beat at metal with a hammer warms up his insides, but he does have the memories of the few times before the ice when he had gone to his knees for men who made him feel a whole lot less. Their memories are nothing compared to this.
“He’s gonna be a lot less stable if he wakes up and we’re still up in the air,” Clint says. “Gotta do something about that.”
Steve grabs his phone from the nightstand and they tilt in close, their bare shoulders just visible at the bottom of the frame, as Steve snaps the selfie. Both of them have mussed up hair, and sleepy smiles, and there is no mistaking the content and relaxed way they lean into each others' touch.
“Because I want to talk and I sure as shit don’t want what I have to say to end up on the internet.  And even if this thing has a camera...”  Tony reaches under the steering wheel, pulls out a set of wires and then yanks.  “It won’t be listening.”
They've quieted down a little by the time Bruce joins them, and he isn't surprised to find James and Clint sitting at the dining room table with a huge array of weapons sitting out on display.  Bruce doesn't know where they got them and he isn't going to ask.
When Steve hands the third picture over, Tony looks confused. It’s several hearts drawn on one page. They differ in size and get more steady from left to right.
The others introduce themselves as well, so now Tony knows that Kate is the energetic brunette, and Natasha is the redhead who moves with the grace of a dancer.  Clint needs no introduction, but introduces himself anyway, with all the enthusiasm of a contestant on The Dating Game.
The bill comes for the drinks, and everyone starts to dig in their pockets to piece together the cash.
It’s late.  Tony hadn’t come to bed so Steve goes looking at him.  He’s in his workshop, still fiddling with the Iron-Nest.  Iron-Eggsy is off to the side, still in one piece.
“Just don’t drink anything they try to hand you in a cup, and you’ll be fine,” Tony says. He hesitates. “How’s everyone else doing?”
“What about guns for Nanna and Kate?” Tony asks.  “Do you happen to have something undetectable here incase you need to make a worst case scenario exit.”
“It’s 7:42 in the morning, sir.  The weather today will be sunny, with a chance of rain in the late afternoon.  The high is expected--”
“I’m sorry this got weird,” Steve says, as he picks up something clean from the pile and pulls it on.  “And that people are trying to kill you.”
“I bought you breakfast to thank you,” Steve says, as he steps into Tony’s workshop and places one of the two paper McDonalds’s bags in his hand onto the table in front of Tony.  He adds a large McDonalds coffee next to it.
“If you’re with Rhodey that means no other man can swoop in and steal you away, Pep,” Tony says. “This works out great for me. I’ve always figured some day you’d have to drop me when you found someone to put a ring on it. Now that’s not going to happen.”
Tony’s elevator opens and Steve and Natasha step out.  Natasha is all business.  Steve looks like he’s about to be sick.
At least the trunk isn’t a tight fit. There isn’t much room for movement but he and Steve aren’t stuffed in like two sardines in a tin. That’s one consolation. The other consolation in this shitshow of a life of his, is that there’s no shovel in the trunk. Unless they’re gonna dig the hole by hand, they are probably not planning to kill him right away and bury his body. Or kill him at all.
And God does he flaunt it for the next minute and a half.  Steve’s showered with plenty of guys-- that’s part of Army life.  He has never showered with anyone so intent on
He’s trying to be honest.  To lay something out for Tony he hasn’t shared with anyone else.  Something he thinks Tony might understand after his own ordeal in the desert.  Except Tony’s just glaring at him with that awful look on his face, and he’s not saying anything.
Straw flies everywhere as Clint starts dragging weapons out of his crate.  Natasha’s excited enough that she’s moving quickly, too.  And really so are Steve and Tony.  This is too much fun to delay.
“Tony, so help me, I swear, if you say Doctor Hulk one more time you’re going to meet him,” Bruce warns. “And I don’t think you’d like his bedside manner.”
It seems like the type of story that ought to remain private.  Especially when Sean points out that Tony was drunk at the time and a ‘total slut for it’.  For some reason, that’s what gets the biggest laugh.
“The sedative you used,” Bruce says. “Can it be extracted from the bullets and injected some other way?”
“Katie’s going to be more pissed if we don’t get our asses in gear,” Bucky reminds him.  “What with her depending on this distraction to you know-- live and all.”
Steve smiles at that. “Well, you’d better get used to it. I intend to keep you very happy for as long as you let me.”
“No bet. I’m with you on two out of three,” Tony says.  “But if that really is a sink, and you somehow get me to agree it was a good idea to rip it out of the wall and pack it for our slumber party, I’ll owe you a burger and fries.  How’s that?”
“You wanna blow this popsicle stand?” Tony asks. “I’ve got a car here, and I swear I haven’t had anything stronger than a water with lime.”
When he finally removes the pillow, it's because his lungs are burning from lack of air. Clint is still there, watching him, with a look Bruce doesn’t entirely understand. Fondness, maybe? It’s confusing.
“Do you want to have to hold all our Avenger team meetings in a jail cell?” Steve asks.  “Because that’s where this is going to land me.”
Except that’s not true. If he were popular, at least one of the assholes on his team would have bothered to call him or check in with him since his suspension. But no one had. No one cares that he’s gone, and if they do care at all, it’s just because they’re pissed they’ve lost a star player. It isn’t about Tony.
“Bruce needs coffee,” Bruce says with a yawn. He does fistbump her though, and that gets a huge smile from Kate. “After coffee, I will weigh in on whatever this is.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony says, as he turns to face Steve. “I was an ass. Such a giant ass, and I don’t deserve your forgiveness for that but if you’d consider it-- I’d like to make it up to you. Fix things. Or at least end things in a way that isn’t incredibly shitty and terrible. I mean you’re here. That’s-- that’s something, right?”
Dum-E chirps happily, and by the time Steve lowers his phone, Tony’s composed half of his resignation letter in his head.
Natasha smiles. “Couldn’t leave you losers alone for too long. There’s no telling what kind of trouble you could get into. And speaking of trouble, where’s Bruce?”
“You’re right,” Tony says.  “Because she was too good for me from the start.  And when she couldn’t figure that out on her own, I did the one thing I knew would hurt her badly enough that she’d get a clue.  I’m fucked up.  I don’t work right.”
He’d been skeptical when she’d presented him with a quilt of his own, but she’d gotten down on her knees and looked him in the eyes and explained that when she was five her mother had made her the quilt that now lay on her bed.  That it was the only thing she had left from her family and that she really wanted to keep it safe in her room.
“Can you move toward Tash?” Clint asks. “She isn’t clear. Can’t cover you both unless I grow another set of arms.”
“That makes a lot of sense,” Bruce says, and honestly, the conversation solves another word problem Bruce has been struggling with. “So skin arm and metal arm is how you’d like us to talk about your arms? I haven’t been sure how to differentiate them in conversation without being rude.”
“Then he deserves better than you,” Howard says. “Because whether it’s me blackballing him with the owners, or it’s you, and your reputation, dragging him through the press, the end result is the same: You keep this up and his career is over.”
Steve makes an alarmed gagging sound because that was a visual he didn’t need.  Ever.  And Tony never fails to be delighted when he gets that reaction, so he gives Steve a small smile.
“If I was Bucky, what would you say to me?” James asks.  “M’not him so don’t get your hopes up.  But if I was?”
“You did, Sir,” Jarvis agrees. “SHIELD agents are experiencing unprecedented uptime and productivity. I assure you there was no harm done.”
Tony tilts his head forward so his forehead is resting against Steve’s.  “I don’t want to fuck this up.  I do that a lot.  Too much.”
For a man Bruce has never met, Sam proves himself quickly. Bruce doesn’t miss the obvious military training and most days that would set him on edge. In the middle of a crisis, Sam’s discipline is appreciated. The work on James is too much for one person. Clamps are needed, and suction. A scope. Pliers. Some industrial wire cutters. Bruce can’t imagine trying to make this happen on any other plane in the world. Tony, bless his mechanic’s heart, has enough random tools on the Quinjet they could open an Auto Supply store and it looks like they’re going to need every last one of them.
“We can move out to the porch after breakfast,” Clint says.  “That way the wind can do some of the work and we won’t have to sweep up.”
of you, taking back control. Either way, you get to choose what these malfunctions mean to you, and Clint and I will help you go from there.”
“If you and James understand this stuff, maybe you should practice scanning on me first,” Clint offers. “It doesn’t look too likely to bake me or blow me up.”
“I remember her,” Steve confirms. “I had the biggest crush on Boop when we first met. She was a beautiful person, inside and out. And one of my first friends in the USO.”
James lowers his face. He ends up putting both hands on the cushion he’s sitting on and  bracing himself there.
“We just haven’t decided if sincere is enough to earn back our trust,” Clint says.  “We aren’t gonna let people shit talk him, though.  Not while he’s your boyfriend and Bruce’s Science Buddy. If nothing else, Tony’s family by extension.”
Hammer was giddy at the prospect.  Clapped and gushed and offered the guy a few hundred-thousand dollars right there on the spot.
Tony shakes his head.  “I try not to do that.  I get it all the time, you know?  People read about me and they think they know me.  They make assumptions.  I guess I just wanted to... start fresh.”
“Okay, fine,” Steve continues.  “I’m a little mad at him.  Bucky.  Fuck.  I mean James-- I know it’s not his fault and it’s completely unfair--”
“How long does James have?” Clint asks, interrupting Bruce’s guilt spiral while tapping rapidly at his phone.
“I mean it.  Listening to you talk about the things you’re passionate about?  I feel like you could have kept all of us mesmerized for hours.  Science talk was all the rage back then.  Or we were giant nerds.  Could have been that, too.  Probably a mix of both.”
Bruce thinks about his next words carefully.  He doesn’t want to guilt Tony into this.  He also doesn’t want anything bad to happen to James.  He settles for the truth.
Steve makes a growly sort of huff under his breath and Tony can see that his knuckles are white where he’s gripping the paper.  Tony digs his toes into the floor and then wheels himself away from Steve a few feet.  He’s not afraid Steve will hurt him.  Steve
Clint drops his bag on the table and begins to rustle through it. He pulls out a small, beat up laptop, and hands it over to James.
Tony glares at him.  “That’s what’s got your star spangled panties in a twist?  I just thought it was the great depression or something.  Seriously?  You’re worried I’m going to think you’re a gold digger?”
about it,” James says, with a little bit of accusation and some humor. “Go ahead. Touch me however. But make it obvious where it’s gonna be so I don’t get jumpy.”
“I know,” Tony says.  “And I appreciate it.  But if you’ll let me have this, I’ll keep working on the rest.  And I’m not ever going to doubt your intentions.  Your sanity, sure, but not your intentions.”
James’s breath evens out in a forced way that Bruce guesses is from 70 years of learning how to shut down panic attacks before anyone notices. His body is rigid and tense and his eyes slide to Clint. There’s fury there along with the fear. Clint seems incredibly fragile sitting close to James the way he is. Breakable. Easy to kill. The Other Guy is not a fan.
Steve maybe falls a little bit in love right then.  Steve's maybe already been falling in love with him a little bit already.
“You don’t owe him anything. You don’t owe me anything. So when I put this out here-- take it or leave it,” Bruce says, wanting to be extremely careful about applying any pressure at all. “Even though you aren’t Bucky Barnes, that doesn’t leave you as a no one. I’ve enjoyed meeting you. I think you seem interesting and I hope I get to know you better before you decide to leave. Steve might like that, too. He’s a good guy.”
“Yeah.  I watched them,” Steve confirms.  “They were on the news channels for days.  And in the papers.  You were on the radio, too.  And the internet.  It was hard to miss.  You were very thorough.”
He leans his forehead against Tony’s and when he pulls back, Tony cracks up. The serious moment dissolves.
“You’ll love it,” Clint promises Tony, breaking free of Bucky so he can linger for a moment to fall in step with Tony.  “It’s kind of a dive, but they keep a table for us on Friday nights and fries are on the house.”
“No, I don’t,” the soldier says wearily. “I don’t fuckin’ know him. Bucky Barnes knew him and I’m not Bucky Barnes.”
“Fine, on art,” Tony says, lifting his hands in a sort of confused surrender.  “Is there something else I can help you with, Captain Obvious?”
“I am incredibly aware of that,” Tony says.  “It is totally an Area of Awareness.  Consider me secure.”
“He’s a keeper,” Tony declares. “Aren’t I always saying not enough people are willing to harass you, Banner?”
Tony’s shoulders tremble.  He’s crying.  Steve tugs the door shut behind him to protect Tony’s privacy.  There’s a crowd gathering.
“If James is up for it, I’d like to give him some more of the IV nutrition first,” Bruce says. “Then I’ll go collapse somewhere.”
Steve had phoned ahead and talked to Mae and she’d agreed to lock the doors once they are inside. Any diner patron can leave, but no one else will get in until Tony and Steve are finished eating. Mae offered to do more, but Steve turned her down.
He’d loved this quilt.  He’d taken it with him when he’d gone to MIT.  The night his parents had died he’d cocooned himself in it and shut out the world.  He’d stayed with Rhodey’s family for a few weeks after that, and when he’d left the Rhodes home to move back into his parents’ empty house he’d left the blanket behind.
“Side project. Mostly Bruce’s. Redefining food as we know it. Just eat the damn thing. If you’re going to mope around the tower indefinitely you can at least make yourself useful.”
“Keep your mouth shut about Stark,” Clint warns, all of his usual friendly nature gone.  His eyes are hard.  There’s no room for argument.
“Suit yourself,” Steve says.  There’s finality in his voice.  One more person Tony has disappointed.
James looks no more trusting this time than he looked before. He still unwraps it like a bomb.  He still sniffs it cautiously. But when he takes a bite, it’s a proper bite, and not the nibble from earlier.
“There’s no rush,” Steve says. “While you’re in here, focus on being in here. When you’re ready to come home, Clint’s not going to know what hit him.”
“Well, it’s not for any brilliance on my part,” Bruce says. “I’m worried I might really be screwing him up, Steve.”
Steve tilts his head in curiousity and the kid looks down. “My name’s Steven. After my father. After his father. All named for you.”
When they arrive at the penthouse, it’s spotlessly clean and the air is lemony stale.  The whole place smells like citrus cleaner and closed windows. Steve wanders around, carrying Tony, until he finds the master bedroom, walks through it to master bathroom and then places Tony carefully in the bathtub, fully clothed.
JARVIS had texted Clint an address overnight, so he’s the one to share it with James and Bruce. The texts Bruce receives over the course of the morning and during his hike are all from Tony and mostly they’re GIFs. When interpreted one after the other as a story, they seem to indicate that the occupants of the tower are having a rough morning.  Progressively as: Depressed Cat, Frantic Cat, Grumpy Cat, Drinking Blankly from the Sink Cat (Bruce hopes that’s a metaphor), Gives Zero Fucks Cat, and then back to Depressed Cat again. There’s also a random picture of a falcon, but Bruce isn’t even going to attempt to interpret that one.
Steven nods enthusiastically. They take a table and Steve completely loses track of time. It’s fascinating. He’s happy to hear that Boop had married a serviceman, and that she’d had four children with him. Those children had given her a dozen grandchildren, and when she passed in 2010, she’d been surrounded by a huge family who loved her.
They spend most of the rest of the evening in silence.  Comfortable silence at least.  Steve gets Tony a glass of water and Tony doses off without having eaten a single bite of pizza.  Steve carefully tucks the blanket around him before he leaves.  He stops by the security counter on the way out, and gets the pass for the warehouse in upstate New York.  The guard strongly suggests Steve make an appointment for that visit, as the Stark Industries Head of Security doesn’t like surprises.
Steve’s only met Colonel Rhodes a handful of times.  When he meets him in late January at a military event and asks if he has a minute to talk about Tony, Rhodes looks unhappy.
“Hydra isn’t looking for me. I went down with the helicarrier. They won’t be looking for you either. They have other objectives.”
Bruce can’t shake the feeling he ought to call his friends.  He won’t, because James clearly isn’t ready for it, but it’s a thought that itches in his brain while they walk.  It feels a lot like guilt.
“You know you’re going to tell us,” Steve sighs.  “One hundred points if you can keep it secret for one whole minute.”
The questions continue as Tony gets back to work.  Steve only worries for a minute that the distraction will derail Sam’s wings before it’s obvious Tony’s second wind has reinvigorated the process.
“Or you and Steve can go sit on the back porch and talk,” Bucky says, without looking up.  “That’s probably a thing that should happen.”
“Just thought you could use some normalcy.  TV.  Beer.  It’s what me and Rhodey do.  Guess that wasn’t a thing back when you hung out with friends.”
Steve ran until he was out of breath, and then walked the rest of the way to get himself back to his apartment. He showered and had just dressed and stepped out when he heard the front door. Two sets of footsteps.
It figures, really. The Starks are a Hockey Dynasty. And the Stark family owns everything from a skate factory all the way up to a professional hockey team, and a piece of the pie everywhere in between. Plus they’d had money even before hockey was in the picture. That’s why they have a fancy skyscraper named after them in downtown Manhattan.
“I know,” Clint says. “And it’s all good. I’m not keeping a record of wrongs here. I am gonna go take a walk, though. You okay here?”
“S’good,” James says, once they’re walking down the path that will lead to a road that will lead to the address Tony has texted. “Everything else causes a malfunction.”
“But I wouldn’t,” Nanna chimes in.  “If they’ve got employees, someone has to come around to clean the toilets”
Bruce is sitting on the floor of an old barn, waiting for a text back from Tony, when he first sees the flash. A man is approaching from a distance, with a bare, metal arm angled to reflect the sunlight directly into Bruce’s eyes. It feels deliberate. Without question he knows who has found him. It’s the Winter Soldier.
There is silence from the bathroom, and then the front door flies open and Clint’s standing there in nothing but a towel and a triumphant grin.
Bruce pulls out his phone. He dials Steve’s number and hopes to god he answers it so Bruce doesn’t have to leave the most awkward voicemail ever. Steve picks up on the first ring.
Bruce puts down his phone and telegraphs his movements as he sits it on the ground. They both need to prove that violence isn’t imminent.
“He did because of HYDRA,” Tony cuts him off.  “I’ve had six weeks to stew, Steve.  Six weeks to hate him, and pity him, and everything in between. I’m not saying I’m over it, but I’m definitely at a spot where he doesn’t need to be the elephant in the room anymore.  That wasn’t doing me much good anyway.  So... what’s he like?  What’s he going to be like when I meet him?  If he’s you know... him... and not all murdery.”
Tony can feel his eyes crossing in confusion.  "Am I going to regret asking why you're taking creeper shots of Dr. Banner?"
Tony shakes his head.  “He’d have had to be around to do that.  Mom wasn’t a fan of needy children.  Or of me in general.  She wanted me to deal with them on my own.”
The childlike way Clint’s face lights up at James’s approval is frankly adorable. Bruce has the good grace not to point it out. Rather than go get dressed, Clint sits down on one of the bar stools, in a way that will give Bruce an eyeful if he doesn’t keep his face turned toward James.
“Fuck old ladies,” Tony whispers in return. “Get some octogenarian venereal disease. Pine for a hot young ass, like mine.”
Though now Steve sees that although he’s come around a different direction he could have taken the elevator up two floors and ended up near where he is now.   Steve tries the door and it doesn’t open.  He knocks and waits.
“You know, if you set the house on fire and I die, that kind of negates the part where you’re trying to keep me alive,” Tony comments.
“Saw Stark out in the halls,” Clint says.  “Whatever he said about last night-- you did the right thing.  I was about three seconds from putting an arrow through Sean’s balls.”
“Interested?” Bruce asks. “It’s fine with me either way. I won’t be offended if it isn’t your style.”
“I have found the video you’re referencing.  Sir was highly inebriated and I do not believe his initial consent would be considered valid by a court of law.  Even if it was, he revokes that consent within minutes and continues to revoke it to the end.  However, I have standing instructions not to alert the police when I detect criminal activity of this nature.”
Sir appears sober. Ms. Potts and Colonel Rhodes accompanied him home and left shortly after, at Sir’s request.
“I want a life,” James says, sounding sad. “Don’t know how possible that’s gonna be since Stark’s got every right to want to see me locked up.  I won’t fight it, if that’s why he’s here. I know that’s what I deserve.”
“Before we start, I want you to know, I’m not here to take sides. I’m not here to pull punches, either.  I’m blunt.  Pussyfooting around your issues is going to get you exactly nowhere.  Think you can handle that?”
Bruce glances back at James, and then up at the screen. His pulse quickens as he remembers all the ways he’s failed friends in the past. And yet these people-- these strong, brave, intelligent people-- know an awful lot about him and yet they’re looking to him for the guidance here. Maybe good intentions do count for something. Maybe he doesn’t ruin everything he touches.
“Oh my god, you two are seriously having a pissing contest over spooning, while we’re fleeing for my life. With tacos. Who even are you?”
It’s quiet after that. Eventually, Bruce hears Steve and Tony arrive. They stay out of sight. About an hour passes before Tony texts him.
“We don’t need to keep it serious, to keep you safe,” Clint says. And damn it, he’s being all gentle and apologetic about it. “We could do this in our sleep. Steve was--”
“You look fine to me,” Bruce directs to Bucky. “Functional. I’m not an actual medical doctor-- I feel like maybe we should all keep reminding ourselves of that,” he adds. “If we’re only a half hour out, I think as long as James feels up to continuing, I can look him over more closely once we’re indoors.”
It takes Bruce a while to get to sleep after he showers and lays down in bed. Clint’s words bounce around in his thoughts until finally exhaustion wins sometimes around 2 am. When he wakes the next morning to light streaming through the window, he hears sounds of life outside the door. He can’t make out what’s being said, but he hears two voices he know are James and Clint (mostly Clint). There are dishes clanking, and Clint laughs. Bruce can smell meat cooking. He stays in bed an extra few minutes to enjoy the peaceful feeling that comes with starting out the day knowing everyone’s alive and in one piece.
“I-- Okay. Okay,” Steve says. He sounds stunned. Possibly in shock. “I’m in New York. I’ll be at the tower. Bruce can tell you which one.”
Bruce leans back on his elbows and watches the sun filter through the leaves. For the first time in a long time he thinks about Betty. He remembers picnics under maple trees, and giggled promises, and warm summer wind. The romantic feelings are gone now, but the memories left behind are good. Thinking about her doesn’t sting like it used to. Bruce doesn’t recall when that changed.
The door is still open.  There’d been no reason to close it, though now Tony thinks that maybe they should.  He makes a move to do so, but Steve gets to him first and drags him into a rough kiss.  They keep it up until Tony’s a little dizzy from lack of air and pulls away.  He’s not done though, and only takes a few deep breaths before he grabs at Steve and yanks him back in for more.
Sure, Bruce has his suspicions. James has said and done several things that indicate a post-depression American upbringing and an inside knowledge of what a stubborn punk Steve Rogers can be. That’s still not proof.
Rhodey looks confused and then grudgingly pleased. “Does this friend have something to do with that text from Bucky Barnes?”
“Everything we need and more, Sir,” JARVIS confirms.  “I am sending you the most pertinent information now.”
“It was... something,” Steve sighs. “But can we not? I don’t think it’s a good idea to get my hopes up.”
“Turn on damn IceTalk,” Bucky says, making a slapping motion toward Steve to spur him into action. “They’re playing the same thing over and over.”
Steve got to the closet, and with no prompting whatsoever from JARVIS, smoothed his hands over the blankets and chose Ana’s quilt.
“You’ve got my blessing,” Tony says easily, and with a sincere enough smile they know it’s true. “Though you need to get your heads checked for worrying about my feelings in the first place. I don’t deserve that kind of consideration.”
That’s when there’s a blast overhead. Cars fly off the roof, fiery and twisted and embed themselves in nearby buildings or hit the ground with deafening bangs. The parking garage is on fire.
He’s not upset at Clint’s suggestions.  Steve’s relaxing by the second and Tony can’t help but think Clint has a gift for getting inappropriate at the times they all need it most.
Steve is enthralled.  Days could pass, and Steve’s pretty sure he’d be content right where he is.  At least until Tony yawns.
“That was perfect,” Steve tells Tony, when they’re in the elevator.  “I-- I don’t know how I could be happier.”
Tony shifts away from Steve to make room for Bruce to sit between them.  Bruce only hesitates for a second before he joins them on the couch and the grateful look in this eyes over this small kindness is almost more than Steve can take.  He leans in a little against Bruce’s side, and he can see that Tony’s doing the same.  They can’t be there for Clint and Natasha just yet, but they can take care of Bruce.
“Playboy, right,” Steve says, sounding as unimpressed now as he did the first time he’d heard it.  “Why play dumb?  What do you get out of it?”
The elevator comes to a stop and Tony stares at Steve with a new kind of wonder.  It’s not the science.  Well-- it’s a little the science.  But it’s more that Tony’s always looked at Steve in a certain light and made a lot of assumptions and now Steve’s admitting that he not only loves planetariums, but he’s a total nerd about it.
“Oh,” Tony says, sounding miserably sad.  “Right.  That makes sense.  He hates me...  that’s good.  Can you leave now?”
Tony starts doing interviews with anyone who will have him on their show or put them on the front page of their newspaper.  He reveals things he ought to keep quiet.  About all of them.  No one, not even Bruce, is spared.  Tony’s words are brutal.  He’s got a knack for knowing exactly what to say that will cause the maximum amount of emotional damage while skirting the edge of anything classified.
Which settles it. Steve stays. The guest room is huge and the bed is comfortable and Steve sleeps better than he has in weeks.
Nanna’s voice is soft and accented.  French, Tony thinks.  French mixed with Brooklyn. What a combination.  She gives Clint the first hug, once the door shuts behind them, and then she hugs Steve and Bucky.  Tony doesn’t miss how she holds them.  He struggles to meet her eyes when she finally turns to him.
There’s no way he’s going to out Tony, even to his two best friends. So he’s got to keep Tony’s confession to himself.
“You practicing for the Victoria’s Secret runway, or just really, really proud?” Tony asks, as he gives Clint a nudge to move him forward and out of the middle of the stream.
Bucky, Bruce and Clint end up in the back seat and Tony and Steve sit in the middle row.  Steve squeezes Tony’s thigh and gives him a relieved smile.
Jealousy isn’t fun. Ending the night together because in the end this is where they both belong? That’s fucking excellent.
“If you aren’t comfortable with this, I can stop at any time,” Bruce assures James. “There are other ways.”
Both parties shall notify Stark Industries Human Resources Department if the status of their relationship changes by way of parting, or by marriage.
“That’s better,” Rhodey says. “And tomorrow, Jenny and I will come by after breakfast. She’s been begging to skate. You could join us?”
They drink and they watch Star Trek and Steve is transfixed.  Tony makes a lot of jibes about the special effects and the fashion and the genius kid (who Steve suspects hits a little too close to home), but Steve can feel how much it means to Tony that he does enjoy the show.  He enjoys it a lot.
Steve winks and Tony sticks out his tongue.  He takes a few steps backward so he can peel off what he’s wearing and replace it with the world’s best t-shirt and some battered sweatpants.  Steve finishes changing, too.  Tony doesn’t even try to hide exactly what seeing Steve undressed does for him.
Still, it isn’t much of a threat. It sounds a lot more like a warning and the sort you get from someone who is so lost and confused that they’d rather push you away than deal with the problems at hand.
“Look at you, embracing your doctor status finally,” Clint teases, scooching in comfortably against the pillows. “Better be careful or Tony’ll sign you up for med school.”
Tony whines at the loss of weight against him and Steve looks down apologetically.  “Bucky’s not wrong.  This is serious.  Didn’t mean to get us distracted.”
Clint nods, pushes back from the table and walks into the kitchen slowly and deliberately. James isn’t looking but Clint is telegraphing every movement and making a good bit more noise than necessary.
“Well that’s not new information,” Tony reminds him.  “Come on, sit down.  Let me finish this call, and then we’ll-- I dunno.  Figure out a way to get us all drunk.  Or-- something--”
So he settles for carefully lifting Tony up to reposition him to lay flat on the couch, and then wedges a throw pillow under his head.
He’s only concerned because they’re a few hours out from a fight with some bouncing robots and he hadn’t seen Tony take any rough hits this time around.  Nothing strong enough to breach the armor and cause the dark purple mark around Tony’s wrist.
Tony gets a text from Clint around 2PM on Friday, asking if he wants to get drinks after work.  Tony immediately agrees, then sort of wishes he hadn’t because he’s been having so much fun he doesn’t want to ruin his inclusion in the game by having these people meet him and not like him.
Bruce is done with his inspection in under five minutes.  It’s going to take James longer since he’s peering suspiciously in every closet, pulling out every drawer, and inspecting under the beds with a thoroughness that leaves Bruce confident if there’s so much as an ant in the house, James will find it and escort it out the door.
“You didn’t kill Steve,” Bruce says carefully. He wants to tread lightly here, since he imagines the soldier’s conditioning makes a failure unacceptable. “You rewrote your mission. That’s... it’s incredible, honestly.”
“Every day I learn something new,” Bruce says. The admiration in his voice isn’t a bit false. Sometimes Clint really is a wonder. “I cut my own hair. Always have.”
“Has he been drinking?” Steve asks.  The thought of that happening because Steve left Tony behind in the states makes Steve’s chest clinch tight.
Steve relents.  “Sometimes I think I might be in over my head, but that’s not a reason to give up on somebody is it?  And even if it was, I wouldn’t.  That’s not how I’m wired.  When I’m in, I’m all in.  To the end of the line.”
Steve knows a smart woman when he meets one and Pepper Potts is right up there with Peggy Carter.  He’s not going to argue.
But no. They’ve got a one game final, so winner takes all. It’s bad ‘cause Bucky’s out. It’s bad because they’re playing Tony’s team. And it’s bad because if Steve can’t keep his shit together for the next three periods, it’s gonna be the biggest loss the Stars have ever experienced.
“Not Tony Stark,” James says, finally turning his face to look at Bruce before pointing halfway up a separate mountain, a mile or so away. “Him.”
“Human Resources,” Tony starts again, making no more sense on his second attempt than he had on his first.  “They have a form we could sign.  I know it seems way too official just for us to be able to flirt, but if you-- I mean, if flirting is something you’d be interested in exploring.  There’s a waiver for that.”
“I think she’d be impressed if I could tell a Monet from a jar of mayo,” Tony admits.  “Why do you care?”
“It doesn’t matter,” Tony says.  “Yes, I might know more about art than I let on.  Enough to contribute to a conversation.  But I’d just be embarrassing myself.  My legacy.  So I leave it to my friends.”
“I don’t know how it’s going to feel seeing Barnes for the first time, but I’m not dreading it.  And I do hope Bruce and Clint can make some magic happen.”
JARVIS is about to show you some scans of James’s shoulder and chest.  Something’s not right and I’m hoping you can spot the problem.
“I’m with the Winter Soldier,” Bruce says quietly. “He’s the reason I needed a place to stay.  And  before Clint explained the situation, I was hoping you could send me some lab equipment to assess him because he’s injured and that seemed like the right thing to do right up until the part where Clint told us he murdered your parents.”
“If you come with us to New York you won’t be a prisoner.  You won’t be a slave.  None of us would ever deliberately make you do
“Good. Then you can sit down and rest,” Bruce says, before correcting himself to make it less of an order. “If you want to sit, that is. It might be good for you? There are some frozen vegetables here that we can use for an ice pack.”
“Yesssss....” Clint coos from the background on the other end of the line.  “Hearing you cuss is just the best.”
+100 x 8 or 9 (I’ve lost track) to Tony for Getting Steve Laid. Over and over. So much sex, seriously guys, you don’t even know.
“You don’t need the chair,” Bruce agrees as he starts to ease his fingers from his vice grip on the kitchen table.  Hulk shape disaster averted for now.
And from what Bucky can tell, Stark’s doing an excellent job. It’s very possible Steve over-reaches for her slapshot on purpose, or maybe the kid’s just that good.
Now Tony’s at home, trying to ignore the butterflies in his stomach, because Starks don’t get nervous, they just don’t.
“That explains it,” Bruce says, glancing toward Natasha, who smirks. “Thank you, Nat. For helping Clint, and for the pick up.”
It comes out as nearly a shout and Steve has to force himself to keep his hands steady in his lap so he doesn't accidentally slam a fist through the car door.
“You lost a lot of blood,” Bruce says as reassuringly as he can. “It may take a little time for you to be up and moving.”
Nanna’s house is a brick-front townhouse, built along a street of similar brick-front townhouses.  Every door is nearly the same shade of green, some more faded than the others.  There are flowers in nearly all the window baskets, and trellises with ivy.
“You’re definitely alive,” Steve says.  “And a lot better off with those assholes out of the way.  That was incredible by the way.
Clint and James halt, then leave the path to take cover under a large tree nearby. Bruce joins them a minute or so later. He’s parched and out of breath. James and Clint look like they’ve been lounging poolside all afternoon. Neither seem exerted.
He kisses Tony everywhere he can reach.  His neck, his arms, his chest, his stomach.  He lets his fingers ghost over Tony’s skin.  He can feel what this is doing to Tony, and Steve’s body is definitely mirroring that.  He doesn’t want to rush, though.
Steve still takes on missions for SHIELD but he’s choosy now. He only leaves the country when absolutely necessary and when he’s overseas, he works fast. When he’s home, he and Tony date. They watch movies, they make pasta, they laugh. Steve accepts a $200,000 Maserati for his birthday with very little fuss. (Once Steve lays eyes on the shiny, blue sports car he’s in love.) (They’ll have to pry the keys out of his cold, dead hands.) (He’s dating a billionaire. Still not used to that.)
“I was putting together weapons while most kids my age were still playing with baby rattles,” Tony affirms. “I won’t shoot anyone I don’t intend to shoot.”
The bedroom door opens before Bruce can reply and James steps out in pajama bottoms. He's frowning and he's got a serious case of bedhead. It makes him look a lot less intimidating.
Might as well pass along the message of hope.  Considering everything they’ve all lost, it’s about the only thing they’ve got left.
“Oh.  Right.  Yeah, obviously,” Tony snarks.  “Can’t have Captain America looking up gay porn.  The world might end.  The rivers will run with blood.  All the kittens will die.”
“Fine. But don’t say I didn’t warn you. I just got off the phone with Sam Wilson. They’ve got a goalie out for the rest of the season.”
It helps that Tony doesn’t seem any more comfortable spending time with Steve.  By unspoken agreement, they avoid each other except out of absolute necessity in the field or with a strained sense of awkward politeness at charity functions.
She raises a hand to silence any objections and then turns her back on them to strip down to just her bra and underwear, and then she glances back over her shoulder to glare at them until they look away.
“Fine.  We can be friends, I guess.  But just for the record,” James says, turning to look at Clint with a mischievous gleam in his eyes.  “You ever fuck me over, I’m gonna shoot you in the face, friend or not.  And unlike your other pals, I don’t miss.”
Their intrusion is exactly why Pepper has always insisted it’s not a great idea to hold press conferences in lobbies.  Obie had always been something of a stickler for the aesthetic and Tony couldn’t be happier Stane still holds to his asshole ways.
And for the first time Bruce gets the feeling this isn’t so much a warning as a genuine question. James has got fears and insecurities, just like the rest of them. That he’s learning to express them is a big step.
“The Other Guy can sense danger. Sometimes. If I’m paying attention. You wouldn’t register as danger.”
“I more meant rolling the material up over the injury,” Bruce says. “I mean if you’re more comfortable with having them off, that’s fine. Whatever you want. The hay might be itchy is all.”
Steve laughs.  Really, honestly laughs.  This is so much better than the misery of the past few weeks.
He’s black and blue in places that haven’t been black and blue since he was in Junior Hockey. He’s been playing like he’s got nothing to lose, and the scores and his injuries seem to speak for themselves.
Clint sticks out his tongue at her and then runs a hand over his own chest ridiculously. “Just cause you can’t handle this heat.”
Steve’s biggest challenge during these weeks is mostly the exhaustion that comes from working a full time job with SHIELD, Avenging when necessary, and spending his weekends outside of the city. He drives upstate on Saturday mornings, they have couples therapy until lunch, and then Steve naps in Tony’s room while Tony does the rest of his rehab therapy on his own.  They eat dinner together, and then Steve leaves to go to the nearest hotel.  He returns Sunday for their usual visit, and that’s when they do their couples therapy homework from the day before.
“I had a roommate in college,” Tony says. “He and his daughter are the company I’m expecting. And I can’t believe I’m saying this, but do you think you could do me a favor?”
Steve’s the Captain of the other team, and Tony’s his first pick. Tony beams at him as he joins his side, and Sam makes loud gagging noises. Which gets him picked by Bucky. Clint goes to Tony’s team and that’s it. Three on three.
Tony and Steve disappear from all the monitors and so do Nat and Sam, along with Tony’s chatter.  Clint’s eyes are still open, but just barely.
"You might be wondering why we're making this video," Steve says, looking back toward the camera. "This isn't publicity, this is personal and I don't want to draw it out so here it is: I'm bisexual. Always have been. It wasn't something we talked about back when I joined, it was something that could risk my career and put my friends careers in jeopardy. I'm grateful this is no longer the case."
“You don’t need to apologize,” Bruce says easily. “James wouldn’t have asked for your opinion if he didn’t want your honest perspective.”
James gives up any attempt at sitting and flops back down, the heaviness of his arm more apparent now that he has no control over it. His whole body pulls to the left.
She picks up a gun and loads it expertly, with the sort of fluid muscle memory that gives Tony the impression she could do all of this blindfolded.
“I’m going to do everything I can to make sure he’s safe and healthy,” Steve says.  “I promise, I’ll take the best care of him I can.”
For someone like Tony, who has spent a lifetime feeling like an outsider even within his own company, it’s the epitome of what he’s always wanted: Friends as family.
Steve can see the concern in his eyes.  Probably because Steve doesn’t talk about this stuff enough.  After all these months, this shouldn’t be a surprise to Tony. It's Steve's fault that it is.
As an artist, he’s struck by the image of Howard standing at a desk, hands splayed wide over rocket designs, in full science mode.  And there across from him, a dark-haired child, no taller than the desk, trying to get his attention.  In Steve’s mind’s eye, Howard can’t see Tony over all the Captain America memorabilia stacked between them.  It’d make for a gorgeous painting, but a lonely childhood.
Steve takes off running toward Natasha’s last known position and God help any AIM minion who gets in his way. He gives the shield a heavy swing. He has no time for their shit.
“I’ve watched weeks worth of footage of you.  Maybe months.  And I’ve never seen you smile like you smiled at those texts.”  Steve lets the words hang out there for a moment and reaches up like he’s going to touch the spot where Tony hit his head.  When his hand gets close, he hesitates.  “Sorry. I know you asked me not to--”
Tony stands and offers Steve his hand to pull him to his feet.  He leans in and kisses Steve sweetly on his lips and when he pulls away it’s only a few inches.
Tony’s phone dings again and this time he grabs for it like a lifeline.  He reads through Bruce’s housing request and he’s overwhelmed with relief.  The task is a distraction from the ugly place in Tony’s soul that had opened up six weeks ago and continues to fester on the daily.
This is why Tony is going to hell.  This is why Tony hates himself nearly as much as he hates the Winter Soldier.  This is why Tony isn’t sure he hates the Winter Soldier at all.
“Glad you made a friend,” Bucky says. “Even if it’s the one person in the league gettin’ more shit than you right now.”
“A minute out,” Sam responds. He’s a flurry of steady, practiced motion as he drops to his knees next to James. He empties out his pouch onto the ground and he grabs the rubbing alcohol and some dark gauze. “Doctor Banner, can you give me an assist here? I need an extra hand.”
Bruce laughs. “I guess that’s one way of putting it. Or he’s hard-wired to value life. It’s not a bad thing, at least I don’t think so. But it’s a frustrating thing if you’re the sort of person who wants to keep him safe.”
"I wasn't sure if you wanted to see me or if you wanted your space," Steve explains, searching for an answer. "It’s good to see you though, James. I'm glad you're alright."
“Fuck salad,” Tony says, as Steve lowers the phone.  “We’re getting burgers and fries.  And we’re getting the hell out of Brooklyn.  I’m making an executive decision to say goodbye to these ghosts and get us back to my home turf.  That cool with you?”
Getting James out of the Quinjet without needing to wait for him to wake is less complicated than Bruce fears. Just like Clint had suggested, they land on a remote plot of land with nothing but an old farmhouse surrounded by miles upon miles of corn.
“Bucky and I had an island,” Steve says.  “Not-- I mean, obviously not a real island.  That’s just what we’d say when we’d tell each other somethin’ confidential.  “This has got to stay on the island.”  Don’t even remember how it started...”
“Bisexual,” Steve offers.  “But yes.  It’s a thing.  A true thing.  And if they want to make up some story about what the two of us were doing in here, that’s on them.”
The water turns off.  Tony peeks his head out a moment later.  His eyes are tired and there are traces of red in them.  He doesn’t look happy to see Steve.  He looks miserable.
“The opinions of people who don’t know us don’t count,” Steve says.  “The people who know us both understand exactly what I see in you."
Steve hadn't realized they were serious.  He’d met the woman only once, and that was more than two months ago.  She’d seemed nice.  Smart.  Pretty.  And now she’s leaving bruises.
Steve nods. “A couple of the guys have asked who I’m texting, but Clint and Bucky are the only ones who know. I wanted to tell Sam Wilson, the team athletic trainer? I know I can trust him. But I wasn’t sure... I mean we’ve been kind of vague about what we want. Until today.”
“National treasure, my ass,” Tony grumbles.  “There’s no way whoever dubbed you that had ever met you.  Come on.  Tell me I’m right.”
“Your mother is smart,” Tony says. “You should always listen to her. You better tell her that I said that.”
“I’m not overly fond of guns,” Bruce says, reaching past Steve and selecting a big one.  “But I started in the military.  I know what to do.”
And it’s a good thing it’s a light bump, since Tony’s pretty sure Steve’s hips could put a man through a brick wall if he put any force behind them.  And isn’t
In addition to being an ass, Sean is loud.  His tone is unpleasant and he’s rude to the waitstaff who stop by to refill the water and change out their dirty plates for clean ones.
“Absolutely,” Steve agrees.  “Take whatever you need.  All that’s on there are my old AP English essays, and no one-- and I mean no one-- wants to read my thoughts on Macbeth.”
“You’re going to make me walk to rehab because I’m not impressed by your naive little crush?” Tony snaps.
Bruce makes a face, still not entirely sure the archer isn’t plotting to give him a mohawk just so Clint can go around saying mo-hulk for a month. But James nods.
“Stark has plenty of valid reasons not to trust me,” Natasha says.  “But he ought to be nicer to you,” she directs to Steve.  “You,” she adds, nodding toward Clint with a bright smile, “are your own bag of dicks.  No one needs to be nice to you.”
“We’re in the trunk of a car that smells like a cemetery,” Steve says. “I’d probably be more concerned if you weren’t freaking out. Maybe we can start over?”
The quiet in the room stretches out on under Cap’s unrelenting glare.  When Steve speaks again, his voice is low and deadly serious.  This is not the Captain America these people think they know.  This is Steve Rogers: protective, battle-hardened and mad as shit that these assholes think they’re going to bully a member of his team.
Tony finds the stairs to the basement in the kitchen, and then follows them down to look for the fire extinguisher.  The basement is unfinished, with a concrete floor and cinderblock walls.  There’s a washer and a drier that have seen better days, and there’s a garden hose rolled neatly off to the side.  But what gets Tony’s attention is a huge, old-fashioned safe, sitting locked in the corner.
He gathers up their beer bottles, figuring he’ll recycle them downstairs.  That’s really all that needs done to clean up, but Steve finds himself still standing in the penthouse a few minutes later, watching the rise and fall of Tony’s chest.
Apart from his Sunday afternoons spent upstate, Steve’s life is mostly back to normal. The Avengers train together during their days and hang out most evenings. Occasionally they fight some bad guys and everything turns out okay.
It looks like Tony’s going to stop there, but then he speaks again. This time his eyes flick straight to the camera.
Steve won’t talk to SHIELD without talking to Clint and Natasha first.  They meet for milkshakes on a Wednesday afternoon while Tony’s in a board meeting.  It’s no surprise when Bruce joins them as well.  He and Clint share a side and Natasha slides in next to Steve.
JARVIS usually reserves his sass for Tony.  Steve’s always wondered why Tony enjoyed that so much but now he sort of gets it.
“This talking thing is hard but I like it a lot better than when everything I do makes you want to yell at me,” Steve says.
There’s an old, antique-looking dresser pushed against the south wall, and Bruce gives one of the knobs a sharp tug.  The drawer slides out more easily that he expects and the clothes inside are unmistakably Barton’s.  There’s something endearingly Clint about storing a dozen Hawkeye-themed novelty t-shirts in the bedroom of a top secret safe house.  Some people might mistake that for cluelessness, but Bruce knows better.  It’s a statement, a ‘come and get me’ middle finger from a man who’s got exactly zero fucks to give. Bruce enjoys that a lot. He tugs on one of the bright purple t-shirts and a pair of dark sweats, then sets off down the stairs.
They drink the wine as they eat and chat.  Some of what they talk about is work.  Some is about the Avengers.  When they talk about Tony, Steve is relieved by how obvious it is that they care about their friend.  They will do (and have done) almost anything to protect Tony, often against his wishes.  Steve tells them a little about his own experience with that, leaving out the sex tape since it feels too private, but unloading all the rest.  By the end of their entrees Steve feels like he and Pepper and Rhodey have been friends for years.  They understand each other.
When he sees the streak of red and gold above them, he’s not sure he has ever been more glad to see Tony.
“I’m fine,” Bruce says. He is. He’s not smashing anything so he’s got to be fine, right? “Really. And good call on a new place. I’m getting antsy here, I think.”
“Why are you doing, this?” Tony asks.   It hurts.  It’s causing him physical pain to know whatever this is, it’s going to be ripped away from him as quickly as it was given.
Tony looks wrecked in the best way possible.  His lips are cherry red, and his hair is sticking up wildly, and he’s staring at Steve with the same sort of wonder as the first time he’d seen Dum-E’s art.  Like Steve is something beyond special.
Tony’s brain can not decide. His thoughts swing wildly between fear and faith at breakneck speed. He is a pendulum of doubt. A merry-go-round of misgivings. Because maybe this isn’t a monumental miscalculation of trust. Up until an hour ago he’d have trusted Steve with just about anything.
There’s silence at the table.  A genius, a super soldier, the queen of spies, and Colonel Sanders... all stumped.
“Don’t kink shame me, Captain Prude.  Let me enjoy this daydream.  You as the starving artist, me as the benevolent patron.”
He moves up again, letting his forehead drag up Tony’s sternum and over the arc reactor.  Tony’s making all kinds of whimpers and gasps and soft moans.  He can’t lay still. It’s driving Steve crazy in the best possible way.
“And what about the metal on the download chips?” Tony asks.  “The detectors Bucky mentioned would pick them up, even on a cleaning crew.”
Tony takes his time driving to the burger place.  Steve’s got a lot to get out, and Tony’s going to let him do it.  Honestly, it’s probably equally cathartic for them both.
He’s really not sure if it was loud enough to wake Tony up, and this is a mansion, and he should just ring the bell. Except now he can’t ring the bell because he already knocked.
Steve takes a few seconds to meet Tony’s eyes. “I was hoping maybe you would be a friend. And don’t worry. I won’t say a word. Not to anyone.”
James starts thinking more for himself, Steve and Tony do what might pass for flirting, and Clint and Bruce have the very best intentions.
Steve is 100% respectful of Tony’s initial refusal.  A week passes and they text constantly, and they spend time together as friends and Steve even helps Tony steal Clint’s stapler so Tony can seal it in some industrial grade jello before putting it back. (+10 points).
Bruce slings the strap of the duffel over his shoulder and approaches from the side. “Is the injury internal or external?”
He turns the screen toward them to show them a picture that’s not Bucky Barnes but could definitely be his first cousin.
Steve flinches slightly at the comment because up until two weeks ago his nickname had been Captain America because he was so damn wholesome, and now he’s outed as gay and he punches
“This is good,” Bruce says out loud. “A few more rounds on the IV and I think he could be up and walking around. Tony, Steve-- did you guys catch that?”
“Nothing,” Steve mumbles, when Tony lets go. “Enjoy your menagerie. Distract me with more of that and I’ll let you move on to bigger scores. Llamas. Hippos. An elephant. A zoo. I’ll help.”
It’s permission to take the call alone. It could be trust. Or it could be James doesn’t want to hear Bruce talk to the son of his murder victims. Or James doesn’t want Bruce letting in the cold air from outside since he’s on the couch without a shirt. Bruce doesn’t ask for clarification. He needs to get the call over with before Steve gets to Tony first. He sits on the wooden porch floor and leans against the chalet wall and calls his friend.
It’s a shocking thing to hear.  Tony would have given his right arm to be friends with someone like Steve in High School.  To have not been the thirteen year old prodigy to whom no one would give the time of day.  To have been invited into a room like this to laugh, and flip through dirty magazines and... do whatever it is normal high-schoolers do in bedrooms.  Tony isn’t even sure what that is.
“Hopefully these are an end to world hunger,” Bruce says. “But if that doesn’t work out, they’re something James can eat without feeling sick. You can try one, if you want.”
“Doctor Banner sends his regrets but he’s unable to join you.  His project won’t allow him to leave the lab.”
“Anyway, we went to McDonalds and we talked through breakfast and once I saw past all the weird layers of cocky bullshit I liked him,” Rhodey explains.  “He agreed to tutor me if I’d buy him breakfast once a week.  Then after all that bargaining, he still tried to pay because he was worried I didn’t have the money. We’ve been stuck with each other ever since.”
“I won’t,” Steve says.  He sits down on the other side of the bed and pulls out his phone.  “I’ll read.  You rest.”
“What other choice did I have, Pepper?” he asked, throwing his hands up in the air.  “No matter what anyone says, I didn’t
Besides, he’s already kept him later than he’d intended, and doesn’t he owe it to him to do whatever he can to hasten things along now? “Yeah, that’s fine. I don’t mind.”
“There was a war going on!” Steve said, defensive and disapproving.  “I’m sorry if my first priority wasn’t—”
“The pilot just called.  They’re expecting an hour’s delay because of the weather.  You want me to stop somewhere, or would you prefer to keep going?”
No. There hadn’t been enough time for a doctor to perform anything but the most superficial of tests.
Alright. From the footfalls, he could tell there were the standard four people coming their way, which in and of itself wouldn’t be a problem, but he’d have to be careful to avoid letting one of them sound the alarm.
Captain America glanced at him over his shoulder.  “I can’t talk about—are you—do you work for SHIELD?” he asked nervously.
“What do you want, Steve?” Tony asked, his breath swirling over Steve’s skin, and Steve remembered the day Tony had hinted he was attracted to him, how uncertain he’d been in response, how he’d avoided talking to Tony about it, because he hadn’t known what he wanted.
What if the reason Dr. Stark acts the way he does is because he doesn’t want anything to do with him?
He doesn’t think Steve actually wants more inside of him, although maybe he’s wrong. Maybe Steve wants as much as he can get.
But Tony still wasn’t looking at him, was typing something at rapid speed, and Steve wasn’t entirely sure that he’d heard what he’d thought he’d heard, but he was completely certain that he wasn’t going to disobey, so after a moment’s hesitation, he did what Tony wanted.
I wanted to thank all the people who've commented and left a kudos over the course of this fic so far. I was staring at the the numbers the other day and just thinking, wow. Wow, guys. And I really, really, really appreciate all the support, even though this has been the slowest updated story of all time. You guys keep me going, through when I thought I was leaving fandom, in the middle of moving and having no internet, and struggling through tons of writer's block, and seriously, you guys are the best.
and trying to do who the hell knew what—it couldn’t be what Steve was thinking; it couldn’t—and maybe it wouldn’t have been so bad if he could see what they were, but Tony’s arms kept him from looking, and—
He revised that estimate about a minute later when Steve had him in a classic Schoolboy pin straight out of the glory days of professional wrestling.
Talk shop? Next time? Steve searches his eyes for mockery or condemnation, but they’re just filled with warmth instead, and it’s all Steve can do not to throw his arms around Tony and hold on for dear life. He can’t believe he’s this lucky, that Tony doesn’t mind they just had to sneak out of a coffee shop because Steve has slick drying on this thighs, and he doesn’t want to question his good fortune, but he can’t help but ask plaintively, “How can you even
But as Tony dimmed the lights and settled down like they were actually just going to sit there and watch a show, he wondered if Tony’s plans included making him wait until he was ready to claw his way out of his own skin. If so, it wasn’t going to take long. Steve knew that anticipation made things better, but he was already so keyed up that it was starting to feel like torture. And he knew, he
“Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What's your thing? Pilates?” Tony asked, and Steve knew there were other people watching and they were pretending to have never met, but it was jarring nonetheless. As if Tony didn’t know what Steve did to train.
“Now, we’ve talked about watersports before, and it fell into your ‘willing to try but not terribly excited about’ bucket, however, that was a while ago. If you’ve changed your mind and this, hell, if anything I’ve told you about, is a hard ‘no,’ then we’ll do something else. Punishment isn’t an excuse to ignore your limits, and I do have a backup plan ready. I won’t hold it against you.”
He murmured Tony’s name helplessly, reaching back to grab a handful of fur as the pleasure rocked through him in endless waves, surging and cresting higher and higher, and he didn’t realize he was coming until he felt hot splashes hit his chest, his cock jerking in the air, and Tony let out a rumble of what sounded suspiciously like satisfaction.
In the past, he’d wished more than once that the serum didn’t require that he orgasm as part of his body’s daily maintenance. While he could push it off a day or two if he was willing to put up with the consequences, had done so a few times during the last several days while Tony was recovering, having Tony touch him now, having Tony
He turns the two of them so they’re upright, somehow losing his grip on the wings in the process, but that ends up working in his favor, because his Angel spreads them out on top of the water, and it makes it much easier to keep them both afloat.
—but he can’t. It doesn’t matter that Tony’s right there, or that they’re in public, or that Steve’s never even thought about a fucking machine before, because it’s all he can think about now. About Dr. Stark’s hands pulling him to the end of the exam table and leaving him bare and open as he maneuvers the machine to the right height, choosing which size and settings to use on him while Steve lies there, panting with a combination of nervousness and anticipation. Steve feels like he’s drowning in shame and arousal as he grips the bottom of his chair to keep from reaching out, and he clenches his thighs together in a pitiful effort to contain the problem, like he can’t feel the warmth seeping across his seat.
He does cover his lap with the sheet once he’s sitting down though. It’s just … manners not to wave his erection around.
“Tell me your safeword,” he said, and Steve looked surprised, but Tony had already told him once that safewords were for more than just the bedroom, and he wanted Steve to know he could use it now. Besides, he actually did want to introduce an element of D/s in their kiss, and Steve needed to know he could choose to say no.
For the longest time after Tony spoke, Steve barely moved, just … just sat there as Tony took off his blindfold and started undoing all his restraints. He kept his eyes closed, even though he didn’t have to, because he didn’t know how he was supposed to face Tony, how he was supposed to—
He broke off as Steve shook his head, the movement small but all too revealing. “Steve, look at me. Please.”
“No way,” Tony said, shimmying the rest of the way out of his clothes and making Steve lose his train of thought.  “We’re in the back corner of the building.  They won’t start looking for us for at least another five minutes.  Plenty of time.”
But that was somehow even more disturbing, and without conscious thought, everything changed once again until Stark was above
Actually, he has no idea what "captain of my pants" means now that he thinks about it, but he knows what he wants it to mean, and really, that's all that matters.
“I should have …” He took a fortifying breath. “I should’ve said my safeword then.” He didn’t know why it hurt so much to admit that he’d needed to, but it did, like a betrayal of what he was for Tony. Of the man he’d always thought himself to be. He knew how important safewords were, but he’d always imagined he could handle whatever the world threw at him and still be able to take more.
Eventually, he’d decided that if Stark had actually noticed how quiet things were, he probably would've been more bothered by it than Steve was. Stark was the type of person who liked to be surrounded by noise, even if it was just the radio or the television in the background, and he wouldn’t have gone out of his way to inconvenience himself for something so inconsequential as having a chattier dinner companion.
He enjoys himself so much that he (mostly) forgets about the fact that Tony is in much better shape than a doctor has any right to be, and he lets himself get lost in Tony’s eyes and voice and smiles.
Dr. Stark gives him another one of those reassuring smiles, says, “Alright, here we go,” and then covers both of Steve’s pecs with his large, warm, rough hands.
“I have to go,” Steve blurts out desperately before Tony can finish his sentence, as if the damage isn’t already done, a veritable flood of slick pulsing out of him at the thought of Tony putting his hands all over him right now. “I just remembered something I have to do. At home. By myself.”
“I’m sure it’s fine,” Steve said flatly, and oh jeez, he was still annoyed with Tony trying to touch Natasha’s breasts.  And possibly propositioning Thor’s body.  Whatever, special circumstances!  It wasn’t like this kind of stuff happened to them every day.
Steve’s control is a lovely thing to behold, but it’s even lovelier when it lays in tatters at Tony’s feet.
—but all yelling at Tony did was to shut his ears, and if Steve forced him to stay, it’d just drive Tony further away from him.
It was a struggle to wipe away all the doubts that were clamoring to be heard, but he concentrated on Steve, warm and eager beneath him, on remembering the feelings of surprise and budding joy that had clung to him all day.
Thor could recall when he first began to view Loki as more than a burden, when Loki’s quick way with words turned from being something he scorned to something he admired.  It’d been during one of their annual visits, three hours of cold and inactivity as Loki read from some heavy tome and Thor seethed over the injustice of his companions going on a week-long hunting trip without him.
“I want a punishment,” Steve said, and Tony could take some satisfaction out of how uncomfortable Steve appeared as he said it, but only a little.
He hadn’t ever expected to get this. And now that he knew what it felt like to hold Steve, it would just hurt that much more later.
“The only thing you’re allowed to do in the bathroom by yourself is use the toilet. I’ll brush your teeth, and I’ll give you a bath, and if you need to masturbate, I’ll give you the chance to do that as well.”
He hadn’t broached the idea of Stark being his Dom in name only yet. He’d been waiting, wanting to give them both more time to interact and to show Stark that he was adjusting to his new life. Not that everything was perfect, because it wasn’t, and not that Steve could pretend he was completely over what had happened to him. He wasn’t that good of an actor, and he doubted Stark would’ve believed him anyway. But he’d wanted to show that he was getting better.
, boredom would seem like the worst thing imaginable.   That’s the reason behind all the Subs and the cars and the parties, isn’t it, to keep yourself
Tony takes a sip from his tumbler, staring into the fireplace and reminiscing about the first time Steve had come over.  They’d ended up sitting in these chairs, drinking and talking, and after a couple of hours, it’d somehow turned into a drinking contest, with Tony confident that he could put Steve under the table without too much trouble because while Steve was bigger, he’d had years of practice on his side.  The next thing he’d known, he’d been waking up in his bed with the mother of all hangovers and a note on the pillow saying Steve had had a wonderful evening but maybe Tony should learn how to handle his liquor.
The growl Tony made then had Steve squeezing his eyes closed as he scrambled to roll over quickly, his stomach clenching in excitement and something that skittered the border of fear. Tony sounded feral, beastly, and Steve knew he was angry at being pushed away. The thought shouldn’t have made him shudder, but he did anyway, some primal part of him recognizing the danger and wanting to cower in the face of it, to submit, and he brought his legs up underneath him, raising himself up to his elbows and knees, offering himself to Tony.
“Oh, I’m starting to want you to make me,” Tony said, irritation coloring his voice, and Steve was glad. Was Tony upset that he didn’t want his support?
Tony runs a hand through his hair to brush it away from his forehead. “I’m not ashamed,” Tony says. “Howard just thinks it would be better for my game to avoid distractions.”
“Clearly science must not do for you what it does for me then,”  Steve teases.  “I like to listen to him talk.  Like to listen to you talk.”
“Nothing catches me off guard,” Natasha smirks. “I think you’re thinking of Clint Slow Reflexes Barton.”
"Jarvis, where's Bruce's office?" Tony asks, as he pushes away from his desk.  "And what time is it?"
It’s hard for Tony not to want to walk close.  It’s hard not to let his mind replay the moment when Steve’s hands settled on his hips and by the time they get to the office, all these thoughts aren’t the only thing that’s hard.
Did Bucky go through with the cyberstalking after all? Or is he just making this up in order to give Steve a kick in the ass?
He realizes he’s going a little overboard when he’s fluffing his pillows for the third time—although looking back, he hadn’t really needed to deep-clean his oven—but he can’t help it. He’s spent the past few days looking forward to the date an entirely appropriate amount, he feels, but now that there’s little more than an hour to go, it’s like he’s being attacked by a lifetime supply of nerves all at once.
Steve’s legs are outright shaking when Tony adds the second slim vibrator, and yeah, it won’t be long now.
“Number three is around meals. We eat together, or at the very least, we’re in the same room during meal times.”
Steve wishes he could say that he stays silent for this at least. There’s no hiding that he’s orgasming, not when Dr. Stark’s fingers are inside of him and Steve’s cock is bare and jerking against his stomach; nevertheless, he wants to say that he salvages what dregs of his pride are left to him and doesn’t reveal just how intense his orgasm is.
“Showers were mandatory by the end anyway; we both smelled like a distillery, and I accidentally knocked over a full bottle, so there was alcohol everywhere.  And yes, it was together, but that’s just because I wasn’t sure you wouldn’t fall and break your head or something.  Although for future reference, you’re all hands when you’re drunk.  Not normally attractive in a person, although, you know,
He glanced at the clock. Just a little past seven. It felt like so much later, but then, the whole day had crawled by, and he thought it was going to pass that much slower waiting for Stark to come back.
He started simply, skimming soapy hands across Steve’s shoulders, his neck, with tracing the span of his back and following the curve of his spine. He appreciated the quiet groan Steve let out more than he could say, the drop of Steve’s head as he offered himself up to Tony. Steve was so fucking gorgeous that it hurt his heart to look at him.
Okay, so I left an A/N in Nostalgia AU AU, so I'll leave one here as well. I can only work on updating one fic at a time, so what I'm thinking is I'll work on updating the fic that gets the most comments/kudos when I post a chapter. I mean, I'll still try to update the other fic as well, but it won't get as much attention. But this way I'll know which fic readers are more excited about, because the more you guys are into a fic, the more I want to write it. And I won't say that Nostalgia AU AU is winning right now, but...
They’re so sensitized that it begins to feel like Dr. Stark is almost pinching them as he rolls and is pulling from further and further from his body, and Steve does everything he can to keep any more noises trapped behind his lips, but his back is coming off the table, and his heels are starting to slide against the leather as his legs move without permission, and his fist accidentally rubs against his cock, and he’s going to come, he can’t help it, it hurts but feels so good, and it’s Dr. Stark, it’s Dr. Stark touching him and watching him, and Steve doesn’t mean to, but it’s too much, it’s too—
Steve hears a sharp inhale, and he looks up to meet wide eyes, which are much closer than they’d been a second ago.
“We could,” he said hoarsely, leaning forward just to feel Tony keeping him back, and he pressed into Tony’s fingers, wanting him to pinch harder. “We could try that.”
But if Tony didn’t want to beat him and didn’t like doing it, then there was no chance in hell that Steve was going to ask him to.
Steve sighed, knowing he wasn’t going to get any more sleep. He rubbed grainy eyes and then rolled out of bed in order to pack what few things he’d left out the night before.
He thought that he’d made up for it since, but he still didn’t know what the whole thing had been about. At the end there, Steve had kind of looked like—but that was impossible, that was just Tony letting his anger color the situation. Whatever the cause, Steve hadn’t acted any differently around him since then other than some extra wariness that had disappeared by the next morning, so he couldn’t really complain, especially since that incident aside, they’d been getting along pretty well.
Steve swallowed, thinking again about Tony’s fingers curling around his throat, about how at ease Tony had been, sitting above him.
“Just kidding.  I turned you down.  Twice.  Sorry, but I don’t marry drunk people I just met, no matter how hot and kinky they are or how many times I had to defend my virtue from your advances.  I know,” Tony says, shrugging, “I obviously have the wrong priorities in life, but what can you do?  I was just here to offer advice and moral support and an extra pair of hands.”
Except when Steve glances uncertainly at Tony, the expression on Tony’s face isn’t amused or put off. If anything, it’s—
“Just listen,” he begged, but he didn’t know what he could possibly say at that point to get Tony to look at him like he mattered again.
He hadn’t thought about what it’d be like to have Steve’s hips trapped between his knees, how the flutters of Steve’s hands as he tried to figure out where to put them would make his heart ache, how it’d feel to have Steve open so willingly for him.
For those of you that are REALLY into tentacle sex, prepare to be disappointed, because I did not go very hardcore on this. I know, what even, right? I just wanted to write it. But then got tired of writing it. So. Yeah.
It felt amazing, better than it’d ever had, and it took an embarrassingly short amount of time before Tony was teetering on the edge of climax as Steve swallowed around him again and again. His hand came to a rest on Steve’s neck, and Steve moaned, the vibrations running up and down Tony’s cock as Steve pressed into Tony’s grip, silently begging for more. It made him want to forget his original plans. It was already going to be a long night after all, and what was life without a little spontaneity? He’d still end up using Steve to his heart’s content, because he wanted to, because Steve had given him permission to, and for once, Tony was inclined to believe him.
But he’d gotten a few odd looks from some of the personnel, to the point that he was all too conscious of a weight that had never been there. He knew that Stark got a lot of leeway from Fury—had seen with his own eyes the way Stark talked to him—but how many black marks were too many?
“I do, Steve,” Tony said, because even at his lowest, he’d never thought Steve had maliciously intended to make him suffer.
“I need to wash,” Steve said, although he didn’t get up. He felt boneless. He did manage to raise his hand, however, resting it just beneath his collarbone, and he wondered if he actually sounded huskier than normal, or if that was just his imagination. He swallowed, savoring the sting in his throat.
“Too much?” Tony asked solicitously, and Steve shook his head, even though he couldn’t decide if it was the truth or not.  He felt a little lightheaded and shivery, sweat starting to bead on his skin, and the pressure felt tremendous.
It’s ironic in one way, because Steve actually hates the idea of using a condom, wants to experience every last inch of Tony as he spears him open, wants Tony to have first-hand proof of exactly how wet Steve gets for him, and wants to feel Tony’s come leaking out of him afterward. He knows, however, that as a doctor—he tries not to whimper and fails miserably—Tony would argue if Steve told him to go without, and Steve can’t stand the thought of delaying this any longer.
“That’s great, Pepper. Steve looks at me. Amazing. Sometimes, it’s even without malice in his eyes, but—”
His words seem to ring in the silence, and Fury folded his hands together in front of him, looking at Tony consideringly. “You have my word,” he said at last, calm and apparently completely sincere, and the turnabout had Tony floundering.
“I . . . suppose,” he said, and he wondered if he should reveal that Steve had smiled at him. Twice.
Tony looked at him for a long time, his eyes moving from Steve’s face to his hands, his shoulders, and then back to his face again, and Steve couldn’t have explained why it was so hard to meet Tony’s gaze, but it took everything he had not to look away.
home, and know that Tony would say the same.  But the more shopping they did, the more he started wondering if maybe they were taking things too fast.
“Oh sure! Take your time,” Tony says, smiling easily, and as always, Steve finds himself smiling back, but …
Tony had said he shouldn’t worry about reciprocation, but that was impossible. He didn’t know about nowadays, but when he was growing up, Doms came more frequently than Subs. It was just one of those things, a way for Subs to serve, and Steve . . . he wasn’t going to be a bad Sub, didn’t
Except Tony used his grip to draw Steve’s head back, away from him, and he opened his eyes, confused and worried.
He walked through the main doors of Stark Tower and nodded to Lisa behind the front desk, to Dave at the security desk, and to the two guards he wasn’t familiar with yet as they walked the halls. He normally tried to stop and say hello to Lisa and Dave at least, but he was in a hurry to get upstairs. He would’ve liked to stay in that morning to spend time with Tony, but while he didn’t normally go in every day—other than the week before when he’d been transferring offices and then preparing to get Dr. Martin—there’d been things he needed to wrap up post-mission. He’d done everything he could to get all his meetings and paperwork finished as soon as possible, but it was still almost three o’clock, and since Tony had been sleeping when he left, he hadn’t had a chance to talk to him yet today.
“Steve,” Tony croaked, breaking his silence in response to the pain in Steve’s voice. He wanted to say more, but he couldn’t get anything out past the block in his throat.
“Tony?” he gasps and realizes he’s got his arms wrapped around Tony.  He lets go in a hurry and tries to shift away, but that’s when he realizes he’s
“What have you been up to?” Steve asked, and then immediately wondered if he sounded half as accusing as he thought he did, even though he’d meant it innocently. He wished he could dispel the suspicion lurking in the back of his mind, wished it’d never become an issue in the first place.
“Don’t you remember what it was like after he left?” she asked, and it was funny to think she’d been the one to push him towards Steve back in the beginning, considering how opposed she was to the idea of them together now. Too bad he wasn’t laughing.
He stared down into blue eyes made brilliant by shock and horror, and he thought maybe that wouldn’t be a bad thing.
He’d been honest with Tony when he’d said he’d liked giving him a blow job, running his hands up and down Tony’s legs while he’d bobbed his head up and down, tasting Tony and knowing his concentration was all on him.
He blinked and swallowed, and it was oddly just as embarrassing reaching for the vibrator as it was to hold himself open, although he couldn’t say why. Maybe it was just that it was something new and he’d gotten—not
by all of it, like he’d never thought anyone would do this for him before, or like he’d just hadn’t realized how good it could feel, and Tony—
, Steve thought, wishing he could explain. The muscles in his legs and buttocks flexed helplessly at Tony’s proximity, embarrassing and no doubt obscene, and he found himself moving his finger away before he realized. He’d never have thought that he’d do something like this without any prompting—but knew that he’d do ten times more if Tony wanted him to.
“I could just get them by myself?” he suggested, although the idea of setting foot outside of the penthouse seemed incredibly daunting just then. “Save you the trip.”
Not because Steve didn’t want to. He did. He thought about it a lot actually. Probably more than was … reasonable … if he were being completely honest. He still hadn’t done it yet, though.
older than he is—then the team can humor him until they figure out a way to get him back to his own universe.
“Look, I really missed you guys, maybe not as much as I thought I did before spending four days of being locked up in here, but still, a lot, really and truly,” it said, and Steve remembered that tired tilt of his mouth, the rigid line of shoulders that spoke without words that Tony wasn’t going to give up without a fight, “but I’m starting to miss alone time more, real alone time, not just time where it’s me and all the cameras pointing at me.”
“Yes, yes, I can see that,” she said thoughtfully. “You’ve got a little something …” She gestured to a dab of mustard on his cheek.
“It seems my brother is attempting to distract us from searching for him,” Thor says, looking oddly sheepish.  “Be not troubled, friend Steve.  Loki’s transformation spells were always for mischief and not harm, and they never lasted longer than the time it took the sun to travel across the sky.”
“Steve,” Tony said, and the way his face fell was further proof that Steve had to go through with this.
Without meaning for them to, his thoughts turned to Tony, about what he’d do if he and Tony were ever in the same situation—
hopeless, and Steve does what Dr. Stark wants, spreading himself wide and then wider still because there’s something about obeying, about offering himself up for whatever Dr. Stark intends to do to him that feels so right that he even drops his hands by his sides, not wanting to hide any part of himself.
Steve could feel his face go from a mostly normal temperature to scorching hot in under a second. There were mini suns in his cheeks.
By the time he had finally gotten up—and only then because Stark had told him it was time for dinner and he’d already made it clear there was no getting out of meals—Steve had been calm about the whole matter.
The other Steve Rogers, however, is different.  His mother had been hit by some type of alien ray on the way to the hospital to give birth, so he’s had all his abilities from the moment he was born.  Super strength, faster healing, the only big difference it seems between the two of them is that he can fly.  Which means he spends a lot of time in the air with Tony.
“It was still just once when I was seeing Peggy,” Steve said, and he felt a pang at the thought of that period of his life, but the conversation was too strange to really dwell on it.
Steve had been reluctant to accept the clothes afterward—it was against company policy or something else equally inane—which Tony had found oddly endearing (but then, he finds everything Steve does endearing, and he’s going to make himself gag, he really is), but he’d insisted.  He likes seeing Steve in nice clothes, likes peeling him out of them even more, and Tony can admit that he gets a bit of a thrill knowing Steve’s wearing them especially for him.
“Alright,” Tony said softly, and Steve wondered at the tiredness he heard in his voice until he remembered that Tony hadn’t been sleeping, that the only reason they were in the position they were in now was because he’d planned on putting Tony to bed. He probably shouldn’t have let things get this far, considering all that, he thought with a twinge of shame at his selfishness, but it was too late to back away now without making giving Tony the wrong idea and possibly straining their relationship further.
“I don’t know what sort of person I am,” James says. “Can’t stop thinking I’m a weapon. Can’t stop counting doors and windows and thinking what I could use in here to cut your throat. It’s all jumbled in my head. Louder now, maybe, since the static is gone.”
“I wouldn’t have guessed,” Clint says kindly (Bruce really does not believe him.) “So what do you say? Tomorrow morning want to play barbershop?”
Not in the way Steve thinks.  Tony feels greedy for his time now.  Pleased with anything that’s going to keep Steve on the lab sofa until the early morning hours.
Rhodey leans over and tugs Pepper into a side hug.  Steve looks away giving them their privacy but it takes only takes Pepper a few seconds to regain her composure and for Rhodey to shift back to sit forward in his seat.
“Do you think Gerber lays in bed at night and just gets off on thinking up the most impossible talking points ever?” Tony asks.  “Like ohhhh-ohhhhh-ohhhhh this is good.  This is going to make one of them cry... Maybe both... Real tears... Ahhhhhhhhhhh.”
“I don’t like being handed things,” Tony says.  He’s actually mostly past that with Steve, but in the face of anger it’s a reflex.
“Bruce texted?”  Steve asks, trying hard to make his tone even.  Keep it uncomplicated by the sort of desperate misery he’s cocooned himself in.  This morning’s reading has been rough.  It’s difficult to shake it off long enough to make words work in a polite direction.
They’re sitting on one of the porch swings in front of the giant rehab house (mostly) alone. The receptionist can see them from inside, and the guard can see them from the gate, but no one is listening. After Pepper left, Steve walked inside and the receptionist asked him to wait on the porch. When Tony had walked out a minute ago, looking unbruised and well-rested, Steve’s face had broken into a smile that he could not suppress. The huge, awful weight he’d been carrying around for the last month had lifted.
Clint rides shotgun (both because he calls it on the way to the van and also because he is quite literally holding a sawed-off shotgun in his lap) and Steve, Bruce and Tony are on the floor in the back.  This may be the most dangerous part of the plan, since transporting volatile chemicals in milk jugs and old whipped cream tubs breaks about a thousand transit safety rules.
After SHIELD falls, Bruce manages to go a month and a half without trouble. He ends up in the Alps on a whim, with no real thoughts on a destination apart from Shit Shit Shit Run. Maybe it was watching
“If it’s all the same, I’d kind of like to see your lab,” Steve says, sounding a bit shy to make the request.  “I always wanted to get up close with a robot.  If it’s not too much to ask, I’d like to see yours.”
Steve stops and looks down at the floor.  When he looks up his eyes have softened slightly.  His tone is less irritated.
There's a pause and a deep intake of breath. Tony can picture Steve in crystal clarity, setting his jaw stubbornly as he plows through the painful words ahead. "But then-- I mean, you know now obviously-- he’s alive. He’s some assassin fairy tale called the Winter Soldier. And then before I knew he was alive, I saw some information on a screen that might connect him with your parents. But Nat and I were at an old Army base and about three seconds later Hydra was blowing us up. I haven’t had the chance to sort it out yet-- I’ve been in the hospital-- and all Nat could find me was one old file-- It’s mostly in Russian--”
“Or you could say fuck it and come have a spa day with me and Sam,” Natasha suggests.   “We’ve got a place we know is safe.”
“Maybe try a drink of water?” Bruce directs to Clint. He’s definitely not going to trust his own legs to stand and move just yet.
Bruce starts to open his mouth but James interrupts him by declaring “You’re back in the bath, Barton!”
“I’m glad you like those,” Bruce says, glad for a reason to change the subject. “I can’t say for sure, but you look like you’ve healed up more than a typical person would expect overnight. You might have stayed injured as long as you did because your body didn’t have anything in it to use for repairs.”
“I’d like to think having some faith in people isn’t always pure stupidity.”  Bruce contemplates his next words carefully before speaking.   “The first time I met Steve he shook my hand. Which probably doesn’t sound like much but-- that’s just not the reaction I expect. Or get. Ever.  People who know what I am run away if they have any sense of self-preservation. And I can’t really put into words how I feel about the people who don’t run.”
"Is there a reason why you called? Not that I’m not happy to hear from you but just… did something happen with..."
“It’s not as big of a deal as it sounds,” Clint consoles.  “I’ve tried to kill her; Bruce has tried to kill her. We’ve all pretty much tried to kill each other once or twice. It’s practically an initiation into the Avengers at this point.”
“You didn’t have to step in,” Steve says, assuming Clint did so because he was worried Steve was going to throw Rumlow through the nearest brick wall.  “I’ve already figured out I can’t punch every asshole who’s got something bad to say about my boyfriend.  That would involve a bus tour across America and I don’t have the time.
“That sounds terrible,” Bruce says. “And brutal. And inhumane and immoral and I would need a thesaurus to finish this sentence. But all of that-- it doesn’t change that I still need to look at your knee, James. And to get the equipment I need to talk to Tony, and really, I need to talk to Tony either way.”
“You’ll see me when I’m ready,” James chastises. “Stop chasin’ me. And stop bein’ stupid with your safety.”
Jonathan doesn’t need to be told twice.  He drops the keys and dodges around Steve, running from the room like Steve might change his mind.
He turns his back and starts to walk away but Steve still isn’t letting it go because of course he isn’t.
“Could use some friends inside Stark Industries right now,” Pepper cuts him off.  “If you want to do him a favor, sign.”
Steve looks an awful lot like he wants to say no. Like he’d much rather wake up from this nightmare than have to keep on living through it. But like the American Hero he is, Steve takes the chair across from Tony, and when he speaks it’s clear his mind’s made up.
There’s a muffled voice speaking to Steve, then the phone is shuffled around and Natasha’s on the line without introduction.
Natasha’s smile turns slightly mischievous.  “Yes,” she says.  “Love is for children; diamonds are forever.  He’s not sticking it wherever he wants though.  I’ve got standards.”
“It wouldn’t be Steve,” James cuts him off. He sounds terribly offended that Bruce would even suggest it.
“Barton-- I could use some help thinning the crowd over here if you’ve got a minute,” he says into his comm.
“I want...” James says, then trails off. Indecision flickers across his face. Whatever he wants, it’s a difficult ask. “Is Steve out there?”
James does seem more at ease with a weapon in his hands, even if the look he gives Bruce is full of offense. “I could defend myself fine without it.”
James nods, picks up a few things from the table, and disappears down the hall. It's hard for Bruce not to worry. Bruce doesn’t know if James has a complicated relationship with water due to any HYDRA torture.  He doesn’t know if the metal arm needs special care if it gets wet.  He can’t even be sure that Bucky’s been given the option of a bath in the last 70 years or what decade hot water taps were invented.
“I thought we established that we aren’t giving one single fuck what people are thinking tonight?” Tony asks with the sort of grin that can only mean trouble. But the good kind of trouble, Steve thinks.
Steve smiles. “What about tomorrow? There’s a chance I’ll be reinstated Monday and I don’t want you to miss out. I could come back. Drop it off.”
Whatever Tony has set up, the look of enthusiasm in his eyes means Bruce is going to want to headdesk repeatedly when he sees it. Still, it is undeniably awesome that he has a friend. And that that friend is Tony Freaking Stark.
The door unlocks, and Steve doesn’t hesitate to step inside.  He doesn’t know what set Tony off and honestly, he’s expecting blood since JARVIS’s concerns are running high enough to override his creator’s settings.  He’s definitely expecting angry shouting when he barges in.  What he doesn’t expect is to see nothing much at all.  One side of the bedspread has been dragged over the edge of the pristinely made bed and Steve can hear sharp, rapid breathing coming from the other side of the mattress.  Hidden from view, and definitely Tony.
“He’s been texting me updates from the Piggly Wiggly,” Bruce says. “It looks like they’re having fun.  I just hope they’re managing to have it discreetly.”
“Not a lock that’s going to keep those two out.  They’ll be up here any minute and Clint will bring popcorn and say he’s gonna watch.  They might even jump in bed with us because they’re idiots like that.  We’ve got to go help.”
Only back then, Bucky was there to pour some water down his throat or to remind him he needed to eat dinner, and oh yeah-- duck punk, they’re shooting at you! That last line was usually delivered with a slap to the back of the head.
“I won’t really braid your hair,” Bruce assures him, in case that’s what has James worried. “We were being ridiculous. I didn’t mean to make you feel uncomfortable.”
“If I thought for a second that Operation Shake and Wake would work, it'd be the new Plan A,” Tony says consolingly.
The spy twins turn their eyes on him.  Apparently it’s a suspicious opinion, judging by their matching expressions of disbelief.
have notified Stark Industries Human Resources Department that they entered into a consensual relationship on or around
Steve hands her his StarkPad and she reads over his notes.  “You know... no matter how we play this, to Barnes it’s going to be a trap.  I still think it’s the way we proceed.  We just need to prepare for some resistance.”
The congratulations continue when they get to work. Tony walks Steve to his desk, and Bucky has coffee waiting for them. Starbucks coffee.
He walks over to Steve, picks up a plate, and hurls it at the Quinjet ramp with as much force as he’s capable.  It shatters into dozens of pieces.
Bruce puts down the baton and James stares at it like he’s trying to see through it. Or set it on fire with his thoughts. It’s hard to tell.
“Shit,” Bruce apologizes quickly. “I’m sorry James. I know you aren’t Bucky and I didn’t mean to imply that you are.”
It wasn’t until later that night, after Steve had gotten several more strikes in than normal during their sparring—just because he’d been distracted, and not out of some weird sort of penance, even if Steve
?” she asked, and in hindsight, this was one of those instances where jumping to the punch line hadn’t been in his best interests after all.
Okay, short, short chapter, but real life has been...and the summer is basically a time of no writing for me, and I've been getting a lot of requests for an update, AND you guys know how much I love my cliffhangers, so here we are.
If Steve had known Dr. Stark was the only doctor who could see him today, he might not have come, because he’s gotten a few inappropriate erections during his appointments with Dr. Edwards, but he’s never had one before they even got started.
He loved Tony. And he knew Tony loved him. But he was so scared of messing up again and driving Tony away that he knew it was only a matter of time before he did it anyway.
All the papers were blank, maybe spilled out of a printer or just dropped by agents as they’d pulled things out, and those he picked up and piled neatly on the corner of a desk. He dusted, swept, and then mopped, and he put everything he could away, although the pile of trash grew steadily, because SHIELD had been careless with the things they didn’t want.
It wasn’t that Steve had swept him off his feet or kissed him passionately or gotten on his knees in front of him, nothing so obvious. He’d just brushed his fingers over Tony’s shoulders in passing and smiled at him, sweet and easy, had sat next to him on the couch with the empty cushions on the other side of him a silent testament of what they were to each other, and it’d left Tony reeling.
For the prompts "Near-death confessions" (cap_ironman bingo) and "relying on the enemy" (avengers_tables).
All he did, however, was say, “Then I imagine you’re going to be very, very bored.  I thought that was what you were trying to avoid in the first place—”
The rest of him didn’t want to ever move again, wanted to soak up Tony’s touch for as long as he could, as much as he could, because he knew he wouldn’t ever get it again.
Tony came around to the front, and Steve dragged his gaze up to meet Tony’s, trying to school his features, and nodded jerkily.
“I’m sorry,” he said, not wanting Tony to feel obligated to let him come, especially since Tony wanted to see him
“Sure, but I’m not going to spend three months being miserable just because ole Cap here decides he’s going to make my life hell.”
Tony started using his nails. Steve twitched, biting his lip. Why did Tony touching him there feel so good?
Tony waved his hand dismissively. “As long as the door isn’t locked, you can stop in whenever you want.”
There was some small, miniscule chance that JARVIS had contacted Pepper or Happy and that one of them had patched him up, but Tony couldn’t imagine any scenario where Steve would’ve patiently waited on the sidelines for someone else to show up when a person had basically passed out right in front of him.
“I’m not. I wouldn’t do that to you, Tony,” Steve said, taking a step closer, and he was going to ruin him when he left again. Tony already knew it. “I missed you. That’s the only reason I’m here.”
“My . . . my car broke down about two miles east of town,” the man said, oddly tentative even though his eyes were running all over Tony like he didn’t know where to look first but couldn’t bear to miss any of it.  “The sheriff said I should come here, that you can fix just about anything.”
because he couldn’t do a backflip into a triple-somersault double-layout what-the-hell-ever incredibly painful looking split thing, and then come bouncing back and two seconds later and have him down on the ground.
When Stark had told him he had a checkup scheduled, Steve hadn’t really thought much about it. He’d seen too many doctors in his life, before and after the Serum, to worry about one more.
get up, Tony.” Steve’s voice cracked. “You shouldn’t be down here, especially while you’re still recovering.”
.  There goes Steve’s tip for the night, fucking hell.  “What were you thinking canceling tonight?  I was already downtown by the time I got the call!  I could’ve been too late!  I could’ve been—”
Steve was standing outside his door at seven in the morning when Tony—scratch that, when Tony’s driver came by.  He said good morning to Happy and peered into the backseat where Tony was sprawled, nursing a huge cup of coffee, sunglasses firmly in place.
It’s a struggle to clear his head, and Steve blinks up at the ceiling. His torso is balanced precariously halfway off the table, he realizes, and he’s trembling. Oddly enough, his legs are nearly straight instead of folded up, and he thinks he vaguely remembers kicking out as he came, wrenching the stirrups out of place.
Tony carefully moved closer—his bed had never felt this wide before, each conquered inch more intimidating than the last—checking frequently to make sure he wasn’t in danger of waking Steve. His eyes remained closed, though, and Tony let out a long breath.
“Oh,” Steve said, his mind going blank for a second before filling with all sorts of images that made him grateful he was alone.
“But you . . . I didn’t . . .” Steve looked at Tony’s erection, which hadn't gone down as much as he would've liked, but then he hadn't exactly been thinking the purest thoughts, had he?
“Because we were both willing to ignore it.” He gave the bottle a swirl before tipping it back for another mouthful. He wiped his lips with the sleeve of his shirt. “Because the alternative was what you were trying to avoid in the first place,” he said, and it was a sharp reminder that Steve might be a card-carrying member of SHIELD now, but there’d been a time when they’d done what they could to throw him to the wolves—even if the wolf, in this case, had been Tony.
It was unfair, Steve knew. Tony had never so much as hinted that he was unhappy with their sex life, even though all they’d done so far was use their hands and rubs against each other. Well, that and twice now, Tony had gone down on him.
“Impossible,” he said again but found himself looking into the observation room where Steve and Joe (“My father’s name was Joseph,” Steve had said as he’d stared down at the kid.  “Yeah, I
“Excuse me,” Tony said, butting in even though he knew he shouldn’t, because it wasn’t like that had ever stopped him before.  “I couldn’t help but eavesdrop, what with standing right here and everything, but you did not seriously just say that having a Dom was the same as being in lockdown in the military.”
The feeling only lasted until he started getting ready to shower. Alone. Tony was in his own bathroom, and he’d told Steve, “Meet you in 15 at the elevator,” before closing the door. That had carried Steve into his own room, but now that Tony was out of his sight, he realized
Every month, Tony pays an exorbitant fee to an extremely discrete company that makes sure he is never without companionship when he wants it.
“Steve? Look, I’m just going to undo all of these, and we can—” Steve hunched over the next strap as best as he could, shaking his head wildly. “Hey, nothing’s wrong, alright? This obviously didn’t work out, and we should—will you—
He’d thought when Tony had told him to take off his clothes that it meant Tony was still attracted to him, but Tony wasn’t even looking at him. He hadn’t touched Steve at all since he’d gotten home, and Steve missed it, his skin tight and aching for the barest brush of Tony’s fingers. What if being naked was just a way to add to Steve’s humiliation rather than out of any real desire on Tony’s part?
“How was ending our contract like that best for me?” he asked incredulously, the words escaping before he could prevent them.
thing Tony’s ever done towards him—putting things in Steve’s ass doesn’t really count, since that’s Tony’s job—but it’s proof; actual proof that Tony is attracted to Steve, and it’s a good thing Steve’s already wearing a towel, because it catches the slick that starts leaking out of him.
He couldn’t blame him for it, though. If caring about a person was the trust that he wouldn’t hurt you, or if he did, he’d do his best to not hurt you more than you could bear, Steve had already shown Tony he didn’t deserve his affection.
It’s just. Dr. Stark is unfairly attractive with his smile and his impeccably-trimmed goatee and his gorgeous brown eyes and strong, callused hands, and more than anything, Steve kind of wants to bury his face in his neck as Dr. Stark buries his cock in Steve’s—
He’d always put Steve first, from the very first day when he’d taken on a Sub he hadn’t planned on and then gave him a list of rules that included telling Tony one thing he wanted every day.
“The only reason I’d leave would be to use the bathroom, but that’s right down the hall, and I’ll be back immediately. I even put in a mini-fridge, so I have everything I need for the day. That brings us to the next point: your nutritional needs. I’m going to give you water periodically, and every few hours—” hours?—”we’ll stop and feed you a shake. They’re not the most satisfying things ever, but you’re not going to want to eat anything heavy while we’re doing this.”
“Don’t worry about that right now. It can wait for a little while longer. Are you alright?” Tony asked, his eyes searching Steve’s, and Steve nodded uncertainly. Tony wasn’t acting upset, but after seeing how good he was at hiding things, Steve wasn’t sure if that was actually true or just what he wanted to believe. “Thank you for telling me what you needed. It means a lot to me that you would.”
“Steve,” Dr. Stark says, pressing down firmly against his chest, pinning him down when Steve tries to curl up in a way that does not make anything better. “Steve, it’s okay, it’s
He smiled, quite innocently he thought, when Steve looked over his shoulder at him, but perhaps not quite innocently enough if the the way Steve’s eyes widened were any indication. Still, Steve did it, taking a deep breath and resting his left knee on the tile, hesitating for a second before adjusting his stance to leave himself open without Tony even having to ask.
He’d kept the enema in a little longer than the suggested time, wanting to be as clean as possible, and then showered afterwards. He felt empty now. And … off somehow, although he would’ve been hard-pressed to explain why. Not that he wanted to. He was relieved that it was over, though, although it just made him even more nervous as to what to expect. What was he going to do that he needed to be … cleaned out?
“Research,” he repeated disbelievingly. “Well, that’s great, but—we never really talked about discipline before.”
After the Serum, he’d been too busy to train with anyone, first undergoing test after test to see what he could do, and then later, touring the United States to generate money for the war effort. Even after he’d teamed up with Bucky and the Howling Commandos, he’d been getting so much real-life experience that sparring had become unnecessary.
At least he could take comfort in the fact that Tony was making sure he knew what was going to happen, that Tony had planned everything out and was still taking care of him, even though he was angry.
“You didn’t even ask me!” he burst out, and it was still there: the hurt and impotent rage from discovering his life had been turned upside down once again without any input from him. “I was right there! But you didn’t even give me a choice—”
The subsequent “I love you” hadn’t been planned—not that the first had been either. But the second had been completely spontaneous, because Steve hadn’t been able to keep quiet after seeing Tony’s face. He didn’t ever want to see that expression on Tony again.
Was Tony … was he sick? Had Steve somehow not noticed he was ill? With everything that had happened, he could believe he’d been that blind, but when he thought furiously back over the past hour, he couldn’t remember Tony sniffling or seeming feverish or unusually cold. Was he just tired? Had he not been sleeping?
“Sure, anytime you want,” Tony said, wondering if he should ask—not sure he wanted to know the answer.
“Woah, you’re heavier than you look,” Tony said, and before Steve could respond, he asked, “You okay? Are you hurt anywhere?”
“What?” Steve asked, glancing at Tony with such an expression of shock and worry that Tony didn’t know what to think.  When had he become important enough to Steve to deserve that look?  “Something happens to Tony?”
Recovering. He searched Steve’s eyes, looking for any signs of pity or contempt, but all he saw was worry; worry and tons of guilt, and damn it, they were obviously going to have to talk about that, but just … just not right now. He couldn’t face the idea of sorting through it all, knew that if he tried in his current mindset, he’d start getting angry and defensive, had already proven that when Steve asked about his back, and that was the last thing they needed at this point.
He knew he’d done everything right, and that felt … that felt better than it should’ve, considering how small the task itself was.
“A bet?” Steve tries to pay attention, because he’s honestly interested in the answer, without paying
“I’m going to shower. We’ll talk when I get out,” Tony said, and Steve nodded jerkily, taking a step back so he wouldn’t be in Tony’s way.
Even now, looking back, he could justify each and every action, because he hadn’t known, hadn’t had any way of knowing what would happen, and maybe he could’ve put more trust in Nick and in Tony, but he’d never been one to blindly go along with what he’d been told to do.
“Clint, hi,” he said, surprised but pleased. He hadn’t seen Clint in months, but he was one of those people that was just easy to be around, their interaction seemingly picking up right where they left off each time they got together.
He remembered seeing her on the first day of training, watching her put Hodge in his place, because some Subs wouldn’t—couldn’t—respect a person until they’d been forced to their knees.  For all that Hodge had been part of his squad and as a result, someone Steve would’ve given his life for, Steve hadn’t exactly liked him.  He’d met his type too many times before—been beaten up by them too many times before—Subs that were bullies at heart and more interested in ensuring their place at the top of the pecking order than they were in their fellow man.
, overwhelmed and desperate, like the best part of a porno with none of the acting behind it. He kept jerking away with pained whines, like he couldn’t handle it, and then coming right back, opening up under Tony’s tongue and flexing around him. But while Steve’s hole was starting to relax, the tension in the rest of his body just increased, his muscles getting more and more rigid until his thighs were nearly damn well vibrating. But no matter how far gone Steve was, he never moved out of the position Tony had demanded of him, kept his hands right where they were on the wall, and Tony rewarded him for it, reaching up to tug and pinch at Steve’s nipples—doing it even harder when Steve just got louder in response.
Still, it didn’t mean anything, not really. Steve knew some people said all sorts of things in the heat of the moment, and while he wouldn’t have pegged Tony as the type, it wasn’t as if he knew
But why now? Tony wanted to ask. What had prompted Steve to come back to New York nearly a year later? If he’d really missed him so much, why hadn’t he missed him before? Where had he been when Tony had needed him?
Tony stopped keeping track of the time and let Steve’s warmth start to seep into him. Steve was surprisingly comfortable to hold—although he supposed Steve could’ve been the world’s worst hugger, and he wouldn’t have minded.
“We’ve decided,” Nick said, glancing at Tony, “that it’d be better if the two of you weren’t in a fledgling contract in the middle of all of this. Too many complications, especially since we can’t guarantee that you’ll both be in the same location if there’s a firefight. Considering how high-profile this is going to be, the last thing we want to do is flaunt the law and then have NASR coming after us and the US government.”
It got worse from there. They argued. It was all they seemed to be able to do when they were together.
Steve didn’t respond, but Tony could see the way the idea gave him pause, that Tony had told anyone about him. Before Steve could become bitter that Tony had been bragging about his latest conquest—and if there was one thing he was sure about Steve right now, it was that Steve was ready to twist his words until they were in the worst possible light—Tony said, “You and I will have to figure out what we want to make public, of course, but Pepper and Happy are like family to me, closer than, like my right and left hands. There was no way I could keep the information from them.”
Tony smile then, soft and amused, and stepped closer until their bodies were almost touching. “You thought right,” he said, gently tugging Steve’s head down until their foreheads were resting against each other and he could feel Tony’s breath across his lips. “I’ve got
Being truthful, however, was . . . intimidating. He hadn’t expected to get along with Tony, let alone like him. The possibility of, of more was—
Steve shook his head slowly. What could he say? Any explanation just incriminated him more, emphasizing his lack of faith, and how was he supposed to convince Tony he could change when he failed at every turn?
nice boy this year.  Or a naughty one, depending on which you like better,” Tony said, leering cheerfully.
He clenched his jaw, keeping back all the words he wanted to say that wouldn’t accomplish anything, while all the things he
“I know guys with none of that worth ten of you. Yeah, I've seen the footage. The only thing you really fight for is yourself,” he said, because the only reason any of this had happened was because Tony wanted into the Avengers, and here he was. “You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.”
It made another pang of jealousy shoot through Steve because when it came down to it, he and Tony weren’t actually
He hadn’t fought when Tony had knocked into him from behind, disoriented just enough that Tony had them both in the air before he could react. He hadn’t protested then either, just rolled his eyes, assuming that Tony wanted to do a victory lap of some kind before he put him back down. Even when Tony had finally stopped flying and made it clear that Steve wouldn’t be getting down any time soon, Steve hadn’t been too concerned, because he’d thought, how bad could whatever Tony was planning be?
“Honor,” Steve whispered, his hips rolling into the mattress, and Tony could see the goosebumps rising on his skin.
The straps had been impersonal, just material sliding over his skin, hooking into the other side and tightening automatically. Tony had been close as he’d latched them in, but there hadn’t been any contact. For the band around his waist, however, Tony’s hand reached around from him and smoothed it against his stomach, and Steve had wanted Tony to touch him, did want it, didn’t think there’d ever be a time he wouldn’t.
“Steve! Hey, it’s okay, you’re fine,” Dr. Stark says, crowding close and reaching out to stop him from getting down and cleaning up his mess. It’s not okay, though, it’s not, there’s something
“That’s not what I asked.” He gripped the base of the vibrator and pulled slightly so that Steve was squeezing around the knot instead of the thinner part beneath it, forcing the vibrations even faster and making Steve cry out and his knees buckle, so he was completely bent over the table.
The first time he’d killed someone up close, slitting a guy’s throat in the middle of the night, he’d kept eye contact the whole time.  He’d seen the fear, the panic, the anger and denial, and he’d let his victim see him, too, the excitement of the hunt, the worry that he was going to be caught, the rush that went through him at the kill, and even the guilt that he was taking a life.  The connection between the two of them had been amazing, profane and profound, and with the body still warm, he’d known that he’d wanted to do it again.  He’d needed to do it again.
At last! The move is done! I've been without internet for like a week now--the HORROR--and to celebrate being connected again, here, have some unfinished fic. :)
“You mean Ms. Peggy Carter.” Dr. Saunders looked back at him, expression as serene as ever, and he hated it. “Did you know she lives here in D. C.?”
How many years would’ve passed by then?  How many graves would he have to visit?  How many lives would he have missed out on?
Maybe, he thought, staring down at his cock which had seemed to acquire a mind of its own, Tony had been right about his minimum changing.
That’s probably going to change, though. Ideally, he’d just be able to push the driftwood with its cargo along, but with those wings, the Angel would slide off as soon as Tony started moving. He doesn’t have any braided seaweed on him either, so he’s going to have to swim with his arms around the Angel in order to keep the wings mostly closed and minimize drag. That means his tentacles will doubtlessly tangle up around the Angel’s legs, which is going to slow them down like crazy, but at least he’s not wearing any of the funny clothes that Humans always have on.
offended.  Like there was any way in hell SHIELD could’ve had enough money to afford him.  Had the guy even
Life really only came back into focus once they were finally back at SHIELD, Natasha and Clint leading the way in order to avoid reporters, and the quiet moments of savoring a job well done got lost under the barrage of questions as soon as they walked into the building. Where had they been? What had they been doing? Had they come across any living Chitauri? Was anyone hurt?
It would’ve been more of an accomplishment if he hadn’t argued with himself the whole time, but … he could forgive himself for being worried. He’d just wanted Tony to be alright.
It didn’t take much for his wandering mind to dwell on all the what-ifs that might’ve prevented the very thing he was there to mourn: what if Steve had just done a little more, what if Dr. Strange had told them what to expect so they could’ve planned for it, what if Tony had flown to Carol with the Stones instead of using them himself?
Luckily, Tony had no problem letting Steve carry more than his fair portion of their weight, and it really wasn’t too bad.
He rolls his eyes.  It's not that Tony was ever particularly effusive with "please" and "thank you" before, but they seem to have completely disappeared from his vocabulary recently.
“Sorry, this has to be uncomfortable for you, Steve,” Dr. Stark says, and it is, fuck, but there’s also a hot line of slick sliding down between his cheeks, and Steve doesn’t know how to respond. “I’m sure Dr. Edwards doesn’t take this long as it’s really rare for a man of your age and health to have any prostate issues. During a routine exam, your physician would check the inferior end of the prostate—the closest end—and that would be sufficient. Unfortunately, I need to rule this out as being the cause of your symptoms, and in order to do that reliably, I have to examine your whole prostate, not just part of it.”
Tony was witty and kind, was incredibly handsome and used to dating beautiful Subs, and the only thing that made Steve special was the reason he’d left Tony in the first place.
He was hopeful, however, that Tony would invite him into his bed that night—although maybe Steve would take the opportunity to ask instead. Of course, there were many things he’d like to ask for. Maybe he should get Tony to clarify rule six for him. It’d been so long since he’d set out his list that Steve wasn’t sure if he recalled it exactly. Had Tony said he needed to tell him one thing he wanted every day, or
Since I'm taking an indefinite break from writing Stony, have some fic I never finished. I've got like 2 or 3 more of these I'll post.
I apologize for the extremely short (half or even a third of a) chapter.  It would’ve been longer, but this is my last chance to remind you guys about the auction happening on tumblr to raise money for AO3.  You can find my page
He was kind of tempted to go a little kamikaze on Steve in retaliation--the worst pain of his life, really--but he controlled himself and started by rubbing Steve’s shoulders.
“I have access to very limited mission data. In your case, I’ve chosen not to read it, and unless I get an alert that something requires my attention, I will continue to not read it.”
He sat quietly as Tony reached for the conditioner and tried not to shiver at the feel of Tony’s fingers massaging his head. He found himself staring up at Tony’s face, even though they were both naked, even though there were other things that should’ve grabbed his attention. Tony wasn’t even looking back at him, focusing on his hands and what they were doing, and that oddly felt right to him, at least for that moment. It felt like permission to look his fill, without Tony asking why or what he was doing, and Steve soaked it all up while he could.
“The fact that he’s being nicer to you has to be promising, though, right? Maybe he’s trying to let you know that he’s interested in your interest.”
Fuck, the sleep had helped, but his brain was running at a snail’s pace; he was nowhere near back to normal; it felt like he was a breath away from panicking; and there was no way he could handle any of it.
Steve moaned, flinching back and grabbing Tony’s wrist, but rather than stopping him, he pressed Tony’s hand even harder against him, whimpering in the process.
Everything had changed, however, when he’d found out about Peggy.  She was still alive.  She didn’t have a Sub.
“Tony,” he begged, because no matter how good it felt, he needed more.  He would’ve thought that any touch would be enough to push him over, but after having been denied for so long, it was like his body was afraid the opportunity would be stolen away from him once again and refused to let go.
Well, shit. That was . . . unexpected. Did Steve like the command? The tone? The words themselves? Tony was going to have to think about that more when they were finished, but for right now, he had things to do.
“Don’t stop,” Steve gasps frantically, his fingers tugging Tony’s head back. “Please don’t stop kissing me.”
When the cinnamon rolls arrived, he asked JARVIS to let Tony know and then set the box on the counter, the sweet smell pervading the room.
He wasn’t even wearing a collar. He’d mentioned it before they’d left, but all Stark had done was cock an eyebrow and ask, “Do you
Steve moans and shudders against him, and it’s only then that Tony realizes two of his tentacles are awfully close to Steve’s groin and another three have both of Steve’s nipples in their grasp and are popping on and off of them as they fight for space.
nervous,” he admitted, and it still felt uncomfortable to talk, but he wondered how much of that was because Tony had said he owed him three days of silence and how much because he dreaded going over all the ways in which he’d hurt Tony.
“I excel at many, many things, Steve,” Tony said, raising the spoon with a flourish that had red sauce splattering everywhere, “but cooking isn’t one of them. I can, however, make a mean pot of boiling water,” he said, taking another lid off a neighboring pot to demonstrate.
“Welcome to your new home,” Tony said, throwing open the doors to his penthouse and spreading his arms to show off all the glory.  And his pad was nice, too.
She’d pointed out that Tony was on the news all the time, was linked with stars and musicians and Subs from all over, and it was always the same gossip of were they or weren’t they, and how long would it last this time? While Captain America would be recognized on the street, most people didn’t know who Steve Rogers was. Everyone, however, knew Tony.
Like all omegas, he has bigger nipples than betas or alphas, and he’d been wrong: Dr. Stark’s smile did
He blinked several times in order to clear his blurry vision, almost wishing he hadn’t when the all too familiar ceiling came into focus. He hadn’t slept in his own room for over a month, but he’d memorized all the tiny dips and divots in his supposed “prison” a long time ago.
He didn’t make a conscious decision to walk forward and open the door, but suddenly he was staring at Tony—a Tony who was no longer in the suit. Steve couldn’t stop himself from scanning him over, and although he looked tired and upset and there were a few bruises and scratches on him, that was all.
Steve just … he needed to know that Tony wanted him still. Just that. He knew he didn’t deserve any kind of praise or tenderness, but just … just that one thing.
That . . . could’ve gone better, Steve thought and decided that since Tony had left, it wouldn’t be bad for him to sit down.
They didn’t talk about it, and maybe that was a bad thing or maybe not, but he wanted Steve to know that he could count on Tony’s affection, and not only that, he could take as much or as little as he needed. Tony wasn’t on any kind of schedule—well, the hugs were, one in the morning before breakfast and one at night before bed, but other than that. He was busy all the time, but only because he liked being busy, so if Steve wanted five minutes or ten—not that they ever lasted that long, but they could—then Tony was more than happy to give it to him.
Tony hadn’t allowed himself to hope when Steve had come back, had refused to acknowledge how hard it must’ve been for Steve to breach the distance between them—
“Why didn’t you get yourself off why you were blowing me?” Tony asked, and Steve licked his lips nervously.
He watched as Loki grew, his muscles filling out and the clumsy awkwardness of a colt turning into the confident power of a stallion.  Long accustomed to the unforgiving climate of their planet, Jotun eschewed most clothing, save what modesty dictated, and there came a time when Thor yearned to touch that exposed flesh, to trace the scars that marked Loki as a warrior with his hands as well as his eyes.
He honestly didn’t know why he didn’t call Tony to tell him that night, too numb, too shocked by it all perhaps. Tony definitely didn’t deserve to hear about it from anyone else, however, and Steve resolved to tell him after his meeting with Pierce, to make the time, no matter what else was going on.
He blinks and realizes his head is a lot closer to the Angel’s head than it should be and that he’s slowed down a lot.
Tony’s large enough that he can’t avoid Steve’s prostate, and Steve’s hips jump each and every time the head of Tony’s cock hits it, his legs shaking nonstop at the abuse. A part of him wants to beg Tony to wait, to give him a chance to recover so everything isn’t so sharp and overwhelming, like he’s being shoved toward climax instead of led, but he doesn’t. He won’t, ever.
Tony nearly started crying when Steve stopped, the sudden relief almost too much to deal with. He wasn’t sure what stopped him—the fear that it’d trigger Steve again, the desire to not be weak in front of him, the need to be a good Dom in this at least—but he was grateful for it.
A shameful and disgusting part of him almost hoped Steve would say no, would get up and leave as Steve was no doubt dying to do, because Tony didn’t want to be hurt anymore, wanted the pain to be over so he could at least start to pretend that he’d eventually heal.
It had been said so casually that it’d taken Steve a second to realize that meant he was under constant surveillance, and by then, Stark had already continued. “That being said, however, I have no intention of asking him to show that information to me, just like I would never watch any of the camera feeds from your or any guest’s bedroom. Unless there were an emergency or an assassination attempt or someone brought home a hot pair of twins.” He’d waggled his eyebrows. “In which case all bets are off. You can believe that or not, but if you want privacy, I can have Happy take you to an internet cafe where you can be all anonymous and secretive, although, once again, JARVIS could hack their servers anyway, which means absolutely nothing to you but just accept that Big Brother is watching and say screw it.”
“Given enough time, I could probably do … that,” he said with a slight curl of his lips. “We have an extensive library, and there’s probably something in there that would help. Unfortunately, time isn’t on our side. The longer Tony stays in this form, the more animalistic he becomes. He won’t lose what makes him Tony, but he’ll be quicker to react than to think, and the urges that come with being a wolf will start becoming impossible to ignore.”
“If it helps at all,” she said, sitting down as well and touching his knee, “I don’t think Steve hates you as much as you think he does.”
“I’m sorry I didn’t offer these to you before, but I only just remembered I had them in my cabinet. They’ve been sitting in there for weeks, so they shouldn’t smell much, if at all. Are they all right?” Dr. Stark asks, causing Steve to freeze—and how had he not noticed he was nuzzling his face in the fabric, what the fuck—and stare up at him.
“In the living room,” JARVIS said, and Tony let out a long breath, the voice that had whispered that Steve was already gone, that Steve had left him yet again, going momentarily quiet.
“It’s alright, Steve. You’re alright,” he said, hoping he didn’t sound as choked up to Steve as he did to himself. “Thank you for telling me that and for apologizing.”
He tried to tell himself it’d be alright as he rushed through his own shower. JARVIS would let him know if Tony needed help.
“You already know what I agreed to.” At his blank look, Steve said, “Even if you don’t want to sign a new contract, Tony, that doesn’t mean you can’t reference our old—”
“I hope you don’t mind that I went ahead and set everything up,” Tony says, and Steve looks up to see a trace of concern on his face. “I thought you might prefer—”
“You’re going to be late getting back,” Tony said, his voice coming out embarrassingly rough, but that was fine, because Steve needed to know how much he affected him, no matter how much it exposed Tony in the process.
He realized that his leg was bouncing up and down, and he took a deep breath, making himself stop. He wished they were there already. Wherever there was.
He hadn’t counted on Tony deciding that after being denied Steve’s cock, he’d lick Steve’s ass instead.
“That’s good,” Dr. Stark says absently, and Steve shivers at the indirect praise, wants to hear more of it, wants Dr. Stark to tell him how to be even better. “Open your legs a little wider for me, please.”
“How are you feeling today?” he asked, moving a stool with wheels closer to the exam table and putting the computer he was holding onto the counter.
